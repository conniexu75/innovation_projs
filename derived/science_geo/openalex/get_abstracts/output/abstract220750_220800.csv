https://openalex.org/W2053150532,"The principal lipids in animal cell lipid droplets are cholesterol, cholesterol ester, and triglyceride, but the protein composition of this compartment is largely unknown. Here we report on the proteomic analysis of lipid droplets. Using a combination of mass spectrometry and immunoblotting, we identify nearly 40 specifically associated proteins in droplets isolated from Chinese hamster ovary K2 cells grown in normal medium. The proteins fall in to five groups: structural molecules of the droplet-like adipose differentiation-related protein; multiple enzymes involved in the synthesis, storage, utilization, and degradation of cholesterol esters and triglycerides; multiple, different Rab GTPases known to be involved in regulating membrane traffic; signaling molecules such as p50RhoGAP; and a group of proteins that do not fit any classification but include proteins often found in caveolae/rafts such as caveolin-1 and 2 and flotillin-1. The proteome of droplets isolated from cells grown in the presence of oleate is largely the same except for an increase in the amount of adipose differentiation-related protein, caveolin-1, and a protein thought to be involved in phospholipid recycling called CGI-58. Based on the protein profile, the lipid droplet appears to be a complex, metabolically active organelle that is directly involved in membrane traffic and possibly phospholipid recycling. We propose the name adiposome for this organelle.

We propose the name adiposome for this organelle. Lipid droplets are generally regarded as simple storage depots for neutral lipids in animal and plant cells. Their morphologic appearance gives the impression they are inert cellular inclusions that derive metabolic sustenance solely from their association with smooth endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, or peroxisomes (1Fawcett D.W. The Cell. 2nd Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1981: 655-667Google Scholar). This is especially true in professional fat storing cells of plant seeds and adipose tissue where they occupy much of the cytoplasmic space. Plant and animal lipid droplets are coated with proteins that may regulate their size. Plant oleosins, a large family of structurally related proteins, form a capsule around seed lipid bodies (2Londos C. Brasaemle D.L. Schultz C.J. Segrest J.P. Kimmel A.R. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 51-58Google Scholar). By contrast, a family of four proteins (ADRP, 1The abbreviations used are: ADRPadipose differentiation-related proteinCHOChinese hamster ovaryGAPGTPase-activating proteinpAbpolyclonal antibodymAbmonoclonal antibodyDAPI4′,6′-diamindino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochlorideEMelectron microscopeHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyHPLC/MS/MSHPLC with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometryERendoplasmic reticulumPATperlipin, adipaphilin, TIP47.1The abbreviations used are: ADRPadipose differentiation-related proteinCHOChinese hamster ovaryGAPGTPase-activating proteinpAbpolyclonal antibodymAbmonoclonal antibodyDAPI4′,6′-diamindino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochlorideEMelectron microscopeHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyHPLC/MS/MSHPLC with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometryERendoplasmic reticulumPATperlipin, adipaphilin, TIP47. perilipin, S3-12, and TIP47) that share a 100-amino-acid-long region of homology at the N terminus called the PAT domain are associated with the periphery of animal lipid droplets (3McManaman J.L. Zabaronick W. Schaack J. Orlicky D.J. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 668-673Google Scholar). ADRP, perilipin, and S3-12 are expressed highly in adipocytes. Unlike perilipin and S3-12, ADRP is expressed ubiquitously. Both the oleosins and the PAT domain proteins may function as barriers that control the lipolysis of core lipids (4Murphy D.J. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 325-438Google Scholar). adipose differentiation-related protein Chinese hamster ovary GTPase-activating protein polyclonal antibody monoclonal antibody 4′,6′-diamindino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride electron microscope high pressure liquid chromatography HPLC with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry endoplasmic reticulum perlipin, adipaphilin, TIP47. adipose differentiation-related protein Chinese hamster ovary GTPase-activating protein polyclonal antibody monoclonal antibody 4′,6′-diamindino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride electron microscope high pressure liquid chromatography HPLC with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry endoplasmic reticulum perlipin, adipaphilin, TIP47. Apparently oleosins and PAT domain proteins are not strictly required for the generation and stability of a lipid droplet because these proteins are not found in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) lipid droplets (5Athenstaedt K. Zweytick D. Jandrositz A. Kohlwein S.D. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6441-6448Google Scholar). Instead, the predominant proteins in the lipid droplet fraction of these cells are enzymes involved in sterol and triglyceride metabolism. The localization of these enzymes to yeast lipid droplets suggests that the droplet is a metabolic organelle with a central role in lipid homeostasis. There are indications that metazoan lipid droplets might also be metabolically active. For example, cholesterol ester-rich lipid droplets in macrophages (6McGookey D.J. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1156-1168Google Scholar) as well as cytosolic lipid droplets in mammary epithelial cells (7Wu C.C. Howell K.E. Neville M.C. Yates III, J.R. McManaman J.L. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 3470-3482Google Scholar) appear to contain cholesterol esterase, and an NAD(P)H steroid dehydrogenase-like enzyme has been localized to the surface of lipid droplets in CHO K2 cells (8Ohashi M. Mizushima N. Kabeya Y. Yoshimori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36819-36829Google Scholar). A cycle of cholesterol ester hydrolysis and re-esterification (9Brown M.S. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9344-9352Google Scholar) has also been mapped to cholesterol ester droplets (6McGookey D.J. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1156-1168Google Scholar). The caveolae marker protein caveolin (10Pol A. Luetterforst R. Lindsay M. Heino S. Ikonen E. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1057-1070Google Scholar, 11Tauchi-Sato K. Ozeki S. Houjou T. Taguchi R. Fujimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44507-44512Google Scholar) was recently localized to lipid droplets, and a truncated version of this protein appears to lower the amount of cholesterol specifically in caveolae (12Roy S. Luetterforst R. Harding A. Apolloni A. Etheridge M. Stang E. Rolls B. Hancock J.F. Parton R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 98-105Google Scholar), which suggests a direct role for lipid droplets in supplying cholesterol to this membrane domain. In an effort to obtain more information about the metabolic activity of lipid droplets, we have isolated droplets from CHO K2 cells grown in normal medium and used both proteomics and immunoblotting to identify proteins enriched in these fractions. pAb α-caveolin 1, mAb α-RalA, mAb α-RalB, mAb α-flotillin 1, mAb α-EEA1, mAb α-clathrin, and mAb α-Rab5 IgG were purchased from BD Biosciences. pAb α-Rab 1, mAb α-transferrin receptor, and pAb α-alkaline phosphatase IgG were from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). mAb α-ADRP IgG was from Research Diagnostics Inc. (Flanders, NJ). pAb α-GRP-78 IgG was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). mAb α-KDEL receptor IgG was from Stressgen (Victoria, BC, Canada). pAb α-sec 61 IgG was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). mAb α-filamin, α-actin IgG, and Oil red O were from Sigma. mAb α-cyclophilin A IgG was from Affinity Bioreagents, Inc. (Golden, CO). mAb α-cytochrome oxidase IgG and 4′,6′-diamindino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride (DAPI) were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). mAb α-stomatin IgG was a gift from Dr. R. Prohaska of the University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria. Microscopy—CHO K2 cells were grown on coverslips for 2 days. Cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.6, for 45 min at room temperature. After washing with 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, cells were processed for Oil red O staining using Oil red O at a concentration of 220 mg/ml. Finally, each coverslip was washed 10 min with deionized water, stained with 17 μg/ml DAPI for 5 min, and washed for 10 min with deionized water. Coverslips were mounted on glass slides with Aqua-Polymount (Polysciences Inc.). To visualize the isolated lipid droplets with the light microscope, the fraction was embedded in collagen. Vitrogen (Cohesion, Palo Alto, Ca), 0.2 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.6, 0.1 n NaOH, and the lipid droplet fraction was mixed in a ratio of 1:0.125:0.125:0.75. The mixture was spread on a coverslip in a uniform layer and allowed to solidify for 15 min at 37 °C. Coverslips with the spread sample were fixed with 3% paraformadehyde for 45 min at room temperature and stained with Oil red O for 30 min. Finally, the coverslips were washed with deionized water and mounted on slides with Aqua-polymount. To visualize isolated lipid droplets by whole mount EM, a drop of the fraction was placed on a Formvar-covered, carbon-coated nickel grid and fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, for 10 min, 1% OsO4 in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, for 15 min and stained with 0.1% tannic acid for 10 min and 4% uranyl acetate for 10 min. After each step, the grids were washed with deionized water. To prepare thin section images of the droplets, a sample of the fraction was mixed with collagen (Vitrogen) and solidified at 37 °C. The sample was then cut into 1-mm3 blocks and fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, for 30 min and 1% OsO4 in the same buffer for 1 h. The fixed material was embedded in Epon, sectioned, and viewed with a JOEL 1200 electron microscope. Mass Spectrometry—The protein bands of interest were excised from the gel and in-gel digested with trypsin. HPLC/MS/MS analysis of the resulting tryptic peptides was performed in a LCQ DECA ion-trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) coupled on-line with a capillary HPLC system (Agilent 1100 Capillary Pump, Agilent Technologies, San Jose, CA) and nanospray source. Two μl of the peptide solution in buffer A (5% acetonitrile, 94.9% water, 0.1% acetic acid (v/v/v)) was manually injected into and separated in a capillary HPLC column (50-mm length × 75-μm inner diameter, 5-μm particle size, 300-Å pore diameter) packed in-house with Luna C18 resin (Phenomenex, St. Torrance, CA). The peptides were eluted from the column with a gradient of 25-80% buffer B (90% acetonitrile, 9.9% water, 0.1% acetic acid (v/v/v)) in buffer A over 10 min; the eluted peptides were electrosprayed directly into the LCQ mass spectrometer. The MS/MS spectra were acquired in a data-dependent mode, which determined the masses of the parent ions and fragments of the strongest ion. The resulting spectra were searched for protein candidates in the NCBI non-redundant protein sequence data base with the program MASCOT search engine (Matrix Science Ltd., London, UK) (13Zhang W. Zhou G. Zhao Y. White M.A. Electrophoresis. 2003; 24: 2855-2863Google Scholar, 14Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Google Scholar). For any peptide with a score higher than 25, we manually analyzed the spectrum to ensure the accuracy of the identification. In the manual analysis, the criterion used for a true identification was that all the major peaks in the spectrum had to match the theoretical peptide fragment, and mass errors were within 0.5 kDa. Typically, 1-7 tryptic peptides were identified for each protein. CHO K2 cells are a common tissue culture cell line that normally accumulates small lipid droplets as they approach confluency (Fig. 1A). A standard procedure was developed for isolating these droplets from confluent cells. The most important step in this procedure (see supplemental data A) is to wash the fractions multiple times to remove contaminating membranes and cytosol. Samples of the fraction mounted on glass slides embedded in a collagen gel matrix were stained with Oil red O (Fig. 1B). These fractions contained numerous droplets varying in size between 0.13 and 1.4 μm. In some images, the droplets appeared to be connected together like beads-on-a-string (Fig. 1B, between arrows). Whole mount electron microscopy showed that strings of various sized droplets (Fig. 1C, red arrows) were connected by thin (10-20 nm) tubules. Finally, we examined these fractions by standard thin section EM. The predominant structures were irregularly shaped droplet remnants that had partially collapsed because of the extraction of lipids during the embedding process (Fig. 1D). Contaminating membranes, mitochondria, or peroxisomes were not evident. In addition, the droplet remnants were not surrounded by an obvious lipid bilayer. Based on the EM analysis, the fractionation method appears to produce a fairly pure population of lipid droplets. This was confirmed by the gel electrophoresis pattern. The CHO cell lipid droplet fraction (Fig. 2B) had a relatively simple protein profile consisting of at least 12 bands that were unique relative to the cytosol starting material (Fig. 2A). This banding pattern was highly reproducible (compare gel patterns in Figs. 2 and 4) and independent of the cell type used to isolate the droplets (Fig. 2C). This suggests these are the signature proteins of this fraction.Fig. 4Effect of oleic acid on the signature protein profile of isolated lipid droplets. CHO K2 cells cultured to confluency were grown 16 h in the presence (lane 2) or absence (lane 1) of 100 μm oleic acid. At the end of the growth period, the lipid droplet fraction from each set of cells was isolated. Equal protein loads (5 μg/lane for A and 10 μg/lane for B) of the two fractions were separated by gel electrophoresis and either processed for immunoblotting with the indicated antibody (A) or stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue to show the protein profile (B). The arrow indicates the band identified by mass spectrometry as CGI-58.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Each of the 12 bands was excised from the gel and processed for HPLC/MS/MS peptide mapping. The mass spectra for peptide identifications were manually analyzed to ensure the accuracy of the protein identification. Thirty-seven proteins were identified in these 12 bands (Table I). Four of these proteins had previously been found associated with lipid droplets (Table I, Group 1, Lipid droplet-associated), thus validating the accuracy of the purification and proteomic techniques. All but six of the remaining proteins (Table I, Group 5, Miscellaneous) fell into three groups. The largest group consisted of enzymes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism (Table I, Group 2, Lipid metabolism). A second set of three proteins consists of known signaling molecules (Table I, Group 4, Signaling). Remarkably, the third group was a set of 11 molecules that are thought to play a role in regulating membrane traffic (Table I, Group 3, Membrane traffic). Two proteins we detected but did not include in the table were judged to be contaminants (tubulin and HSP 71). Each group of proteins provides new insights into the function of lipid droplets.Table IProteins associated with isolated CHO K2 cell lipid dropletsBand No.GroupNumber and nameSizeYeastGI No.kDa1(1) Lipid Droplet Associated(1) S3-12139No101812046(2) ADRP45.3No263476696(3) PDI42.8No128388582(4) BIP72.4No250654510(2) Lipid Metabolism(5) S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase-phospholipid methyltransferase28.2ERG6209035059(6) Diaphorase I34.1No197451508(7) 17 β-hydroxysterol dehydrogenase 7*33.4No203851968(8) 17 β-hydroxysterol dehydrogenase 1132.8No167165977(9) Short chain dehyrodgenase/reductase family34YIM4319808445(10) Related to plant lipases47.3YMR313213132745(11) Squalene epoxidase*63.7ERG166781271(12) Acetyl-CoA carboxylase*167SLC1285107832(13) Acyl CoA Synthetase 4*74.4FAA461723412,3(14) Lanosterol synthase*83ERG7263469077,8(15) Palmitoyl-protein thoesterase34.6No66794516(16) Alcohol dehydrogenase43.1No236233371,4(17) Fatty acid CoA ligase 3*80.4FAA12847991311(3) Membrane Traffic(18) Rab 122.4No2769243111(19) Rab 223.5No1094694010(20) Rab 5c23.4No1860618211(21) Rab 723.5No667959910(22) Rab 1022.5No771008610(23) Rab 11a24.4No839412711(24) Rab 11b24.5No667958310(25) Rab 1423.9No1839032311,12(26) Rab 1823No675525810(27) Sec2224.7No67554487,8(28) α-SNAP33.2No1338539210(4) Signaling(29) RalA23.5No95070255(30) P50 Rho GAP50.4No221226499(31) 14-3-3 protein29.2No263449148(5) Miscellaneous(32) Related to prohibitin and stomatin33.2No66716225(33) Unknown protein52.3No284369381(34) Unknown protein193282049568(35) Dolichyl-phosphate β-glucosyltransferase40.2No263259388(36) VDAC-132.3No107204042(37) AAA family protein82.5No26351449 Open table in a new tab Group 2, containing 13 of the 37 proteins (35%), consists of enzymes involved in controlling the synthesis or storage of cholesterol and fatty acids. Three of the enzymes (numbers 11, 13, and 14) are homologues of proteins that had been identified previously in yeast lipid droplets (5Athenstaedt K. Zweytick D. Jandrositz A. Kohlwein S.D. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6441-6448Google Scholar). Another five (numbers 5, 9, 10, 12, and 17) are related either by sequence or by function to yeast lipid droplet-associated proteins. Six of the proteins in this group (Table I, *) are regulated by sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) (15Horton J.D. Shah N.A. Warrington J.A. Anderson N.N. Park S.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12027-12032Google Scholar). Protein number 10 is of special interest. It contains a 168-amino-acid-long PATATIN domain, which is common to a family of plant seed storage proteins that have phospholipase and esterase activity (16Shewry P.R. Ann. Bot. (Lond.). 2003; 91: 755-769Google Scholar). One family member is a lipid droplet-associated phospholipase A2 involved in plant seed fat mobilization (17May C. Preisig-Muller R. Hohne M. Gnau P. Kindl H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1393: 267-276Google Scholar). Adiponutrin, a recently identified adipocyte-specific membrane protein (18Baulande S. Lasnier F. Lucas M. Pairault J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33336-33344Google Scholar), also has a PATATIN domain. The yeast droplet-associated triacylglycerol lipase YMR313c (Table I) contains a PATATIN-like domain, too (19Athenstaedt K. Daum G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23317-23323Google Scholar). Multiple copies of another plant protein motif, the LEA (late embryogenesis abundant) domain, are present in proteins numbers 1 and 2 (Table I). Thus, both animal and plant lipid droplets attract proteins with conserved peptide domains. The presence of group 2 proteins in lipid droplets may be important for efficient storage and mobilization of lipids. The role of group 3 proteins, by contrast, suggests that lipid droplets are targets for membrane traffic. At the bottom of the signature gel for the lipid droplet fraction (Fig. 2B, asterisks) are three bands that contain nine different Rab GTPases. The most abundant is probably Rab 18 because it was the only protein detected in band 12. The principal function of Rabs is to control membrane traffic by regulating vesicle movement (20Hammer III, J.A. Wu X.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 69-75Google Scholar) and fusion (21Seabra M.C. Mules E.H. Hume A.N. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 23-30Google Scholar). Rab 1 and 2 regulate ER-Golgi traffic, whereas the other Rabs regulate endosomal traffic. Also included in group 3 are Sec22 and α-soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) attachment protein, which are proteins involved in vesicle-vesicle targeting and fusion (22Hay J.C. Scheller R.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 505-512Google Scholar). The three proteins in group 4 are well known signaling molecules. RalA is a small GTPase with multiple regulatory functions. One function that might be relevant for lipid droplets is the regulation of membrane traffic in polarized cells (23Moskalenko S. Henry D.O. Rosse C. Mirey G. Camonis J.H. White M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 66-72Google Scholar). P50RhoGAP is also interesting because it contains a sec14 domain and has GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity toward multiple members of the Ras family. Sec14 is a yeast phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (PTP) (24Bankaitis V.A. Malehorn D.E. Emr S.D. Greene R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1271-1281Google Scholar). A homologue of sec14p, Sfh3p, has been localized to yeast lipid droplets (25Schnabl M. Oskolkova O.V. Holic R. Brezna B. Pichler H. Zagorsek M. Kohlwein S.D. Paltauf F. Daum G. Griac P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 3133-3145Google Scholar). Finally, 14-3-3 proteins are a ubiquitous group of signaling proteins involved in many regulatory functions (26Ferl R.J. Manak M.S. Reyes M.F. Genome Biol. 2002; 3 (reviews3010.1-3010.7)Google Scholar). Group 5 contains proteins that did not fit easily into a single category. Protein 32 is related to a group of proteins that have been localized to lipid rafts (see below), but their function is not known. VDAC-1 is a porin that has also been detected in lipid rafts (27Bathori G. Parolini I. Tombola F. Szabo I. Messina A. Oliva M. De Pinto V. Lisanti M. Sargiacomo M. Zoratti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29607-29612Google Scholar), although it is usually considered to be a mitochondrial protein. Recently, an alternatively spliced form of VDAC-1 has been described that is targeted to ER and Golgi apparatus membranes (28Buettner R. Papoutsoglou G. Scemes E. Spray D.C. Dermietzel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3201-3206Google Scholar). Protein 33 contains a domain found in ubiquitin regulatory proteins, and it is a homologue of Fas-associated factor 1 (29Imai Y. Nakada A. Hashida R. Sugita Y. Tanaka T. Tsujimoto G. Matsumoto K. Akasawa A. Saito H. Oshida T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 1282-1290Google Scholar). Interestingly, protein 37 is an AAA (ATPase-associated with various activities) ATPase family member; this family consists of proteins involved in regulating proteasome function, membrane traffic, and organelle biogenesis (30Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: F13-F19Google Scholar). Finally, protein 35 is an ER enzyme that synthesizes dolichol-β-glucose phosphate for complex glycoprotein biosynthesis. Immunoblot Verification—We used immunoblotting to verify and extend the mass spectrometry data (Fig. 3). Equal protein loads of total membrane (lane 1), cytosol minus lipid droplets (lane 2), cytosol plus lipid droplets (lane 3), lipid droplets (lane 4), and a fraction enriched in ER-Golgi elements (lane 5) were separated by gel electrophoresis and probed with different sets of antibodies. The first set (Fig. 3A) contained antibodies directed against established marker proteins for various intracellular compartments (ADRP for lipid droplets: actin, cyclophilin A, filamin, clathrin, for cytosol; KDEL receptor, GRP-78, and sec61 for the ER; cytochrome oxidase for the mitochondria; transferrin receptor and alkaline phosphatase for plasma membrane; and EEA1 for endosome). These immunoblots clearly show that the lipid droplet fraction contains the ER marker sec61 as well as the droplet marker ADRP but appears not to be contaminated with cytoplasm, mitochondria, endosomes, or plasma membranes. The ER luminal chaperones BIP (GRP-78) and protein disulfide isomerase (data not shown) were present in all fractions, indicating that the isolation procedure disrupts the integrity of the ER. None of the fractions were positive by immunoblotting for the two Golgi markers grasp65 and GM130 (data not shown). We also did not see any evidence of KDEL receptor in this fraction, which is a protein found in the Golgi-associated intermediate ER compartment and the Golgi (Fig. 3). Finally, an antibody directed against the peroxisomal import sequence SKL did not detect by immunofluorescence the presence of any peroxisomes in the lipid droplet fraction (data not shown). We conclude that the lipid droplet fraction is largely free of contaminating organelles but contains elements of the ER. An unexpected result of the proteomic analysis was the finding that three prominent bands in the 23-29-kDa region of the gel (Fig. 2B, bands 10-12) contained multiple different Rab GTPases (Table I). We verified this result by immunoblotting with antibodies directed against Rabs 5a and 11 (Fig. 3B). Both were highly enriched in the lipid droplet fraction. Another protein in the band 10 proteome was Ral A. Immunoblots showed that both Ral A and Ral B were highly enriched in the lipid droplet fraction too. Rabs and Ral A regulate membrane traffic, but we found no evidence for either endosomes or Golgi membranes in the droplet fraction. However, immunoblots showed that these fractions were highly enriched in both caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 (Fig. 3B), consistent with the possibility of caveolae/raft traffic to these sites. Another raft marker is flotillin-1 (31Fivaz M. Vilbois F. Pasquali C. van der Goot F.G. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 3351-3356Google Scholar). Immunoblotting showed three isoforms in the total membrane, only one of which was detected in the lipid fraction. Flotillins belong to the prohibin family of proteins. Another member of this family was detected in the mass spectrometry analysis (number 32). Stomatin, a third member of the family, was not detected in the immunoblotted fractions (B). Functional Verification—The constellation of proteins found associated with the isolated lipid droplets suggests that they are a metabolically active compartment involved in membrane traffic. If this is the case, then one would expect the droplet to respond to the lipid composition of the culture medium. We tested this idea by looking at changes in the protein profile of the droplet when cells were grown in the presence or absence of 100 μm oleic acid for 16 h (Fig. 4). The lipid droplet fraction was isolated and processed for either immunoblotting (Fig. 4A) or gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4B) to identify changes in the protein profile. There was a marked increase in the quantity of ADRP in the fractions (Fig. 4A) isolated from oleate-treated cells, which matches the increase we saw in the amount and the size of the lipid droplets (data not shown). Immunoblotting also detected an ∼2-fold increase in the amount of caveolin-1 in this fraction (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, the overall protein profile of the lipid droplet fraction from the two sets of cells was remarkably similar (Fig. 4B). We noted two reproducible changes in response to the presence of oleate: a 50-kDa band the size of ADRP was markedly increased, and a new band was present in the ∼40-kDa region of the gel (Fig. 4B, arrow). The new band was identified by mass spectrometry as CGI-58 (NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) GI number 13385690). CGI-58 belongs to the esterase/lipase/thioesterase family of proteins that are characterized by the presence of an α/β hydrolase fold (32Lefevre C. Jobard F. Caux F. Bouadjar B. Karaduman A. Heilig R. Lakhdar H. Wollenberg A. Verret J.L. Weissenbach J. Ozguc M. Lathrop M. Prud'homme J.F. Fischer J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 69: 1002-1012Google Scholar, 33Lai C.H. Chou C.Y. Ch'ang L.Y. Liu C.S. Lin W. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 703-713Google Scholar). Recently, defects in the CGI-58 gene have been identified as the cause of Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive form of ichthyosiform erythroderma (32Lefevre C. Jobard F. Caux F. Bouadjar B. Karaduman A. Heilig R. Lakhdar H. Wollenberg A. Verret J.L. Weissenbach J. Ozguc M. Lathrop M. Prud'homme J.F. Fischer J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 69: 1002-1012Google Scholar). Patients with this disorder typically accumulate abnormal numbers of lipid droplets in multiple tissue cells. Importantly, this enzyme may regulate the recycling of triacylglycerol-derived mono- and diacylglyerols to specific phospholipids (34Igal R.A. Coleman R.A. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 31-43Google Scholar). The picture of the CHO K2 cell lipid droplet that emerges from these studies is of an intracellular compartment enriched in specific sets of proteins. Overall the lipid droplet fraction contains very little protein, so we do not know what proportion of each identified species is in this compartment relative to other locations in the cell. For example, lipid droplets contain very little of the total cellular caveolin-1 despite an immunoblot signal that is as strong as the total membrane. The high relative amount of each protein, however, implies that the protein has a specific function in the droplet. Based on the protein profile, the droplet appears to contain the molecular machinery to synthesize, store, utilize, and degrade various lipids derived from the enzymatic activity of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase. In addition, this compartment may be directly involved in membrane traffic (multiple Rabs) and possibly phospholipid recycling (CGI-58). The proteome suggests, therefore, that the lipid droplet is not a simple cell inclusion but a complex, metabolically active organelle. Accordingly, we propose the name adiposome for this organelle. CHO K2 and yeast cell adiposomes have strikingly similar proteomes that emphasize common functions in lipid metabolism. The yeast adiposome proteome, however, lacks ER markers. Although it is possible that ER may contaminate our preparations, an association between ER and adiposomes has been documented in several morphological studies (35van Meer G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: F29-F34Google Scholar). The thin tubule structures we see connecting the strings of lipid droplets in Fig. 1C may be special elements of ER. The biggest surprise in the proteomic analysis was finding multiple Rab GTPases in adiposomes. Rabs are generally thought to be compartment-specific, GTP-dependent switches that control the intercompartmental flow of membrane (21Seabra M.C. Mules E.H. Hume A.N. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 23-30Google Scholar). One explanation for the presence of so many Rabs is that 'adiposomes are a traffic hub or way station for multiple membrane pathways. For example, the maintenance of membrane lipids in various trafficking pathways may require frequent visits to this compartment. Membrane traffic to adiposomes could explain the presence of caveolae markers. Membrane traffic could also explain the paradoxical relationship between TIP47 and adiposomes. TIP47 is 47% homologous to ADRP, and under some conditions, associates with adiposomes in multiple animal species (36Miura S. Gan J.W. Brzostowski J. Parisi M.J. Schultz C.J. Londos C. Oliver B. Kimmel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32253-32257Google Scholar). Yet the protein also is a Rab9-interacting protein that appears to control mannose 6-phosphate receptor movement from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (37Diaz E. Pfeffer S.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 433-443Google Scholar). Maybe it also regulates membrane traffic to adiposomes. We thank Troy Henry for the valuable technical assistance and Brenda Pallares for administrative assistance. We are particularly grateful to Dr. Jay Horton, who helped us identify proteins in the fraction that had genes regulated by sterol regulatory element binding protein, and to Dr. Joachim Seemann, who helped us detect the Golgi apparatus.

It is recognized that immune myeloid cells express Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which play a major role in detecting microbes and initiating innate immune responses. In contrast, little is known concerning the expression of TLR in pulmonary epithelial cells per se, their distribution within the cell, their function, and the signaling pathways involved. In this work, we demonstrated by reverse transcription-PCR and/or immunoblot that TLR4 and the accessory molecule MD-2 are constitutively expressed in distinct human alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells. We further characterized by flow cytometry, biotinylation/precipitation, and confocal microscopy the intracellular localization of TLR4 in these cells. Despite this intracellular compartmentalization of TLR4, pulmonary epithelial cells were responsive to the TLR4 activator lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent Gram-negative bacteria-associated molecular pattern. Using respiratory epithelial cells isolated from TLR4 knock-out and wild type mice, we demonstrated that TLR4 is the actual activating receptor for LPS in these cells. Furthermore we showed that this cell response to LPS involves a signaling complex including the kinases interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK), p38, Jnk, and ERK1/2. Moreover, using vectors expressing dominant-negative forms of MyD88 and TRAF6, we established that LPS-induced activation of respiratory epithelial cells is largely dependent on TLR4 signaling intermediates. Altogether these data demonstrate that TLR4 is a key element in the response of pulmonary epithelial cells to molecules derived from Gram-negative bacteria. The intracellular localization of TLR4 in lung epithelia is expected to play an important role in the prevention of the development of chronic inflammatory disease.

Altogether these data demonstrate that TLR4 is a key element in the response of pulmonary epithelial cells to molecules derived from Gram-negative bacteria. The intracellular localization of TLR4 in lung epithelia is expected to play an important role in the prevention of the development of chronic inflammatory disease. The lung is constantly exposed to invading particles and potential pathogens. To cope with this pressure, the lung has evolved a sophisticated defense mechanism designed to clear offending agents while inducing a minimum amount of concomitant inflammation. At first, mechanical defenses constituted by the mucociliary escalator participate in the removal of material from the tracheobronchial tree (1.Foster W.M. Pulm. Pharmacol. Ther. 2002; 15: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Then resident and recruited phagocytes in the lower respiratory tract and alveoli ingest particulate matter and pathogens that circumvent this first line of defense. Pulmonary epithelial cells also maintain mucosal integrity by modulating local immune responses. Thus, these cells respond to a range of stimuli by producing biologically active mediators, including cytokines and chemokines, that influence airway inflammation (2.Diamond G. Legarda D. Ryan L.K. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 173: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). In professional immune cells, including monocytes, macrophages, T cells, and dendritic cells, many receptors participate in microbe detection. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 1The abbreviations used are: TLR, Toll-like receptor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MyD, myeloid differentiation; TRAF, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; Jnk, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; p38, p38 kinase; IL, interleukin; KC, keratinocyte-derived chemokine; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; DN, dominant-negative; IRAK, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase; RT, reverse transcription; FCS, fetal calf serum; sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin, sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)hexanoate; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RANTES, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted.1The abbreviations used are: TLR, Toll-like receptor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MyD, myeloid differentiation; TRAF, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; Jnk, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; p38, p38 kinase; IL, interleukin; KC, keratinocyte-derived chemokine; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; DN, dominant-negative; IRAK, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase; RT, reverse transcription; FCS, fetal calf serum; sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin, sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)hexanoate; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RANTES, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted. represent a conserved family of innate immune recognition receptors that play key roles in detecting microbes, initiating innate immune responses, and linking innate and adaptive immunity (3.Barton G.M. Medzhitov R. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2002; 270: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 4.Takeda K. Akira S. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 733-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Among these stimuli, the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria contains lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent proinflammatory pathogen-associated molecular pattern. The response to LPS is initiated upon its interaction with TLR4 in conjunction with the accessory molecules MD-2 and soluble or membrane-bound CD14 (5.Beutler B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2002; 270: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The response is then transduced via the interleukin (IL)-1 receptor signaling complex, which includes two essential adaptor proteins, myeloid differentiation (MyD)88 and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF)6 as well as the serine-threonine kinase known as IRAK. Other components involved in this signaling pathway include mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (Jnk), and p38 kinase (p38) (6.Takeuchi O. Akira S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2002; 270: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 7.O'Neill L.A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2002; 270: 47-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). This signal transduction pathway further coordinates the induction of multiple genes encoding inflammatory mediators and co-stimulatory molecules (8.Hoffmann E. Dittrich-Breiholz O. Holtmann H. Kracht M. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2002; 72: 847-855PubMed Google Scholar). Various studies have provided evidence that TLR4 plays a critical role in myeloid cells (9.Hume D.A. Underhill D.M. Sweet M.J.

Thus, TLR4 is expressed in intestinal (12.Cario E. Brown D. McKee M. Lynch-Devaney K. Gerken G. Podolsky D.K. Am. J.

(Berl.). 2001; 189: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, the signaling pathways involved in the activation of these epithelia by LPS remain poorly defined. Furthermore little is known concerning the expression of TLR4 (18.Schulz C. Farkas L. Wolf K. Kratzel K. Eissner G. Pfeifer M. Scand. J.

Here we demonstrate that TLR4 is constitutively expressed in distinct human alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells and describe the intracellular localization of this receptor. We also establish that LPS-induced stimulation of these cells is dependent on the activation of TLR4 signaling intermediates such as MyD88, IRAK, TRAF6, and MAPK. Reagents and Antibodies—RPMI 1640, F-12K nutrient mixture (Kaighn's modification), Dulbecco's modified Eagle's, and Ham's F-12 cell culture media; antibiotics; glutamine; Hanks' balanced salt solution; and trypsin-EDTA were from Invitrogen. Fetal calf serum (FCS) was from Hyclone (Logan, UT). Leupeptin, aprotinin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, benzamidine, paraformaldehyde, rhodamine-phalloidin, and LPS from Pseudomonas aeruginosa were from Sigma. Fluorescence mounting medium was from Dako (Glostrup, Denmark). The EZ-link sulfo-NHS-LC-biotinylation kit, immobilized neutravidin-agarose beads, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin and secondary antibodies were from Pierce. Anti-TLR4 antibodies used in this study included the rabbit polyclonal antibody H80 directed against an internal region of human TLR4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and the murine monoclonal antibody HTA125 generously provided by Prof. K. Miyake (Saga Medical School, Saga, Japan). The anti-human CD14 antibody (clone MY4) was purchased from Coulter (Miami, FL). The anti-human β-actin antibody was from Sigma, and the anti-phospho-Erk1/2 and anti-phospho-Jnk antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The anti-phospho-p38 was purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). The anti-human CD87 antibody (clone 3932) was from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT). Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled anti-murine and anti-rabbit antibodies were obtained from Dako and Rockland (Gilbertsville, PA). The human recombinant cytokines TNFα and IL-1β were purchased from Immugenex Corp. (Los Angeles, CA). Cell Culture—The human promonocytic cell line U-937, the human alveolar epithelial cell line A549, and the human tracheobronchial epithelial cell lines BEAS-2B and 16-HBE were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The human tracheal epithelial cell lines CFT-2 and NT-1 were a kind gift from Dr. A. Paul (INSERM U402, Paris, France). CFT-2 was derived from primary tracheal epithelia homozygous for the common cystic fibrosis mutation ΔF508, and NT-1 was derived from normal primary tracheal epithelial cells (20.Lemnaouar M. Chastre E. Paul A. Mergey M. Veissiere D. Cherqui G. Barbry P. Simon-Bouy B. Fanen P. Gespach C. Picard J. Eur. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 23: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). U-937 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% antibiotics, 2 mm l-glutamine, 4.5 g/liter glucose, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 1 mm HEPES at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. A549, 16-HBE, and BEAS-2B cells were grown in F-12K supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% antibiotics, 1% l-glutamine, and 10 mm HEPES, and CFT-2 and NT-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (v/v) supplemented with 10% FCS. Isolation and Primary Culture of Murine Pulmonary Epithelial Cells—Pulmonary epithelial cells from pathogen-free C57BL/6 mice were isolated according to a modified protocol of Corti et al. (21.Corti M. Brody A.R. Harrison J.H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In brief, lungs were perfused with 10 ml of RPMI 1640 medium (supplemented with 1% antibiotics and 2 mm l-glutamine) through the pulmonary artery until they were cleared of blood. Bronchoalveolar lavages were performed using 5 × 1 ml of PBS, 1 mm EDTA to remove alveolar leukocytes. One ml of 0.1% protease type XIV (Sigma) was instilled into the lungs through the trachea. Lungs were then removed and placed in a sterile tube containing 2 ml of RPMI 1640 medium (supplemented with 1% antibiotics and 2 mm l-glutamine) and incubated at 4 °C overnight for enzymatic digestion to occur. Lung tissues were further teased apart in RPMI 1640 medium, 10% FCS in a Petri dish. The cell isolate was passed through a 100-μm filter, and pulmonary epithelial cells were purified as follows. Collected cells were counted and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C at the appropriate ratios with magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) CD45 and CD90 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany), two antigens highly expressed by leukocytes and fibroblasts, respectively. Cells were then washed and diluted in PBS, 0.5% FCS, and CD45minus/CD90minus cells were negatively selected by passing the antibody-coated cell suspension through a column on an AutoMACS magnetic cell separator (Miltenyi Biotech). Pulmonary epithelial cells thus obtained were plated on Primaria 96-well plate (4 × 105 cells/well, BD Biosciences) in RPMI 1640 medium, 10% FCS. After 24 h, cells were stimulated for 6 h by 1 μg/ml LPS, and KC and IL-6 levels were measured in the resulting supernatants. RT-PCR—Cells were grown on a cell culture flask (Techno Plastic Products, Trasadingen, Switzerland), and total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France). DNase treatment was performed using 4 μg of extracted RNA, 1 μl of DNase I (Amersham Biosciences), and 0.5 μl of RNasin (Promega, Madison, WI) in a total volume of 20 μl in the manufacturer's buffer. cDNA was obtained by incubating RNA with 1 mm dNTP (Eurobio, Les Ulis, France), 1.5 μl of hexamers as primers, 20 units of RNasin (Promega), and 300 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase RNase H minus (Promega) in a total volume of 50 μl in the manufacturer's buffer for 1 h at 42 °C and 10 min at 70 °C. PCR was performed using specific primers (Genset, Evry, France) for human TLR4 (sense, 5′-TGG ATA CGT TTC CTT ATA AG-3′; antisense, 5′-GAA ATG GAG GCA CCC CTT C-3′) and for human MD-2 (sense, 5′-GTT ACT GAT CCT CTT TGC ATT TGT AAA GCT TTG GAG-3′; antisense, 5′-TCT AGA CTA ATT TGA ATT AGG TTG GTG TAG GAT GAC AAA C-3′) (14.Cario E.

As an internal control, we used primers for the detection of human β-actin (sense, 5′-AAG GAG AAG CTG TGC TAC GTC GC-3′; antisense, 5′-AGA CAG CAC TGT GTT GGC GTA CA-3′). Amplifications were performed in a Peltier thermal cycler apparatus (MJ Research, Watertown, MA) using Q-BioTaq™ polymerase (Qbiogene, Illkirch, France). For the detection of TLR4 and MD-2, the thermocycling protocol was as follows: 95 °C for 3 min, 36 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 45 s, annealing at 56 °C for 45 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. For the detection of β-actin, only 30 cycles were applied, and the temperature of annealing was 62 °C. Amplification products were resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. Gels were recorded after amplification with an Ultra-Lum system (Ultra-Lum, Claremont, CA). Immunoblotting—Epithelial and monocytic cells were washed once with cold PBS and then lysed on ice in a lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA) supplemented with protein inhibitors (100 μm leupeptin, 10 μm aprotinin, 20 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm benzamidine) and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Samples were further solubilized prior to electrophoresis by adding SDS (2%, v/v), and disulfide bonds were reduced with 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol. An equal amount of protein (15 μg) was fractionated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% acrylamide gel, and proteins were further electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Optitran BA-S 85, Schleicher & Schuell) and probed by immunoblotting using specific antibodies as specified in the figure legends. Bound antibodies were detected using the ECL+ immunoblotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Concerning the biotinylation experiments, TLR4 expression at the cell surface was assessed by labeling A549, BEAS-2B, and U-937 cells with 1 mg/ml cell-impermeant sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin for 30 min. Then cells were incubated with PBS, 50 mm glycine to stop the reaction, washed three times with PBS, and solubilized with the above lysis buffer for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation for 30 min at 18,000 × g at 4 °C, the total protein concentration was determined using the Pierce protein assay, and 100 μg of protein were immunoprecipitated for 1 h at 4 °C with neutravidinagarose beads. After centrifugation, supernatants, corresponding to cytosolic fractions, were collected. Next beads were washed four times with the lysis buffer, and proteins were eluted using 2% SDS and further resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 10% acrylamide gel. After electro-transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane, TLR4 was detected using a specific antibody (H80, 0.5 μg/ml). CD87 expression was also assessed under the same conditions to validate the biotinylation protocol as this receptor is known to be expressed both in the intracellular and surface compartments of pulmonary epithelial cells (24.Drapkin P.T. O'Riordan C.R. Yi S.M. Chiorini J.A. Cardella J. Zabner J. Welsh M.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Molecular masses were considered with respect to calibration standards included in each gel. IRAK Immunoprecipitation and Kinase Assay—BEAS-2B cells were stimulated by 1 μg/ml LPS for 0, 5, 15, 30, and 60 min. Cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed on ice in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors). Cell debris were pelleted by centrifugation at 18,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. The protein concentration in the supernatants was determined according to the Pierce method. Equal amounts of extracts were incubated with 1 μg of a polyclonal rabbit anti-IRAK antibody (Bio Vision Research Products, Palo Alto, CA) for 2 h at 4 °C on a rotor. Fifty microliters of 50% protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) were then added to each sample and incubated for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged briefly in a microcentrifuge, and the beads were washed once with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm benzamidine). The beads were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in a final volume of 20 μl in the presence of 2 μg of myelin basic protein (Sigma), 100 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). SDS sample buffer was then added to protein G beads and boiled for 5 min. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. The gels were dried, and the intensity of the radioactive signal was quantified using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and NIH Image Version 1.62 software. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter Analysis—Epithelial and monocytic cells were dispensed at 1 × 106 cells/ml in conical bottom 96-well plastic plates (Nunc A/S, Roskilde, Denmark) and were further centrifuged at 100× g at 4 °C for 10 min. Cells were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution, 0.5% bovine serum albumin supplemented with 1 mm Ca2+ and Mg2+ before adding a saturating concentration of HTA125 antibody (5 μg/ml) or with non-immune IgG as control isotypes for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were further washed and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with the corresponding secondary FITC-conjugated antibody (10 μg/ml). For intracellular staining, cells were fixed and permeabilized by incubating cells for 90 min on ice with a solution of PBS, 3.2% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% Tween 20 prior to incubation with a primary anti-TLR4 antibody (H80, 5 μg/ml) and FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies (10 μg/ml). Finally plates were centrifuged as above, cells were resuspended in the same buffer, and fluorescence analysis was performed using a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Immunostaining and Confocal Microscopy Analysis—Both human primary bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar and bronchial epithelial cell lines were used for these experiments. A549 and BEAS-2B epithelial cells were cultured on 22-mm glass cell culture coverslips (CML France, Nemours, France). Cells were washed three times with a solution of PBS and then fixed for 15 min in a PBS, 3.2% paraformaldehyde solution. After washing under gentle shaking, cells were permeabilized for 5 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 and washed, as before, prior to incubation with primary and secondary antibodies as described in the figure legends. In control experiments, cells were incubated with nonimmune IgG as control isotypes. Rhodamine-phalloidin staining was used to visualize the actin cytoskeleton. Finally the cells were washed extensively with PBS, and the coverslips were mounted in fluorescence mounting medium. Primary epithelial cells were obtained by brushings performed on lobar bronchi of surgical lung resections. The lobectomy was performed in a context of peripheral subpleural malignant tumor. The proximal bronchial mucosa was evaluated as normal on gross examination. Each brushing was accomplished by very light gliding along the surface of the airway with a 1-mm cytology brush. The brushing sample was immediately placed in RPMI 1640 medium. Cells were then gently set down on coverslips by gentle cytocentrifugation and further processed as described above. Confocal microscopy was performed with a 63×/1.4 oil objective lens on a confocal microscope (model LSM 510, Carl Zeiss France, Le Pecq, France) using laser excitation at 488 and 543 nm. Transfection and Reporter Gene Studies—BEAS-2B cells were seeded at 8 × 104 on 24-well plates (Costar, New York, NY) 48 h before transfection using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each sample contained 100 ng of a NF-κB-luciferase reporter plasmid (kindly provided by Dr. A. Israel, Pasteur Institute, Paris, France) and 50–500 ng of either vector expressing dominant-negative form of MyD88 (MyD88-DN (25.Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M.

The empty plasmid pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) was used to maintain the total plasmid quantity constant at 600 ng. After 24 h, cells were left untreated or stimulated for 6 h at 37 °C with 1 μg/ml LPS or 50 ng/ml TNFα. Luciferase activity was measured in the cell lysates as described previously (27.Philpott D.J. Yamaoka S. Israel A. Sansonetti P.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 903-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) using an EGNG Berthold luminometer. Results are expressed as relative luciferase units. IL-8, KC, RANTES, and IL-6 Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Human IL-8, IL-6, and RANTES and murine KC and IL-6 concentrations in cell culture supernatants were determined using DuoSet enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance between the individual groups was analyzed using the unpaired Student's t test with a threshold of p < 0.05. Identification of Components of the LPS Receptor Complex in Pulmonary Epithelial Cells—TLR4 is the primary signal transducer involved in LPS signaling (5.Beutler B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2002; 270: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). RT-PCR was used to assess the expression of this receptor in distinct unstimulated human respiratory epithelial cells. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-differentiated U-937 cells (macrophage-like cells) have been shown previously to express TLR4 and were used as a positive control for this receptor (Fig. 1, lanes 1). As shown in Fig. 1, left panel, TLR4 is clearly expressed at the mRNA level in both human alveolar (A549) and tracheobronchial (BEAS-2B, 16-HBE, and NT-1) epithelial cell lines. A high level of expression is also observed in CFT-2, a human tracheal cell line with several phenotypic characteristics of cystic fibrosis respiratory epithelia (20.Lemnaouar M. Chastre E. Paul A. Mergey M. Veissiere D. Cherqui G. Barbry P. Simon-Bouy B. Fanen P. Gespach C. Picard J. Eur. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 23: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). RT-PCR analysis of β-actin expression confirmed the quality of all mRNA preparations used for RT-PCR. Human TLR4 is also detectable in all five epithelial cell lines as an ≈110-kDa protein (Fig. 1, middle panel). An immunoblot for β-actin demonstrated similar gel loading. The apparent discrepancy between mRNA and protein expression of TLR4 is consistent with previous studies using intestinal epithelial cells (28.Abreu M.T. Arnold E.T. Thomas L.S. Gonsky R. Zhou Y. Hu B. Arditi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20431-20437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) and suggests that expression of this receptor at the mRNA level may not be directly correlated with its protein level. Current research findings suggest that the activation of the innate immune system involves complex associations of receptors depending on cell types and bacterial stimuli. The LPS receptor complex of mononuclear phagocytes is composed of TLR4, MD-2, and CD14. To gain insight into the mechanism of LPS recognition by pulmonary epithelial cells, we first analyzed the expression of the accessory molecule MD-2 by the two cell lines A549 and BEAS-2B. Using RT-PCR, we observed that mRNA for MD-2 is expressed in these epithelial cells (Fig. 1, right panel). The presence of the MD-2 protein was not checked due to the lack of a specific antibody. Concerning the presence of CD14, this molecule was detected by flow cytometry at a low expression level at the surface of BEAS-2B cells (not illustrated). By contrast, CD14 protein staining could not be detected either on A549 cells (not shown) or in primary polarized bronchial epithelial cells (see Fig. 4, lower panels). Intracellular Localization of TLR4 in Pulmonary Epithelial Cells—We first demonstrated by flow cytometry the absence of cell surface staining of TLR4 using A549 and BEAS-2B cells (Fig. 2, left panels). Positive staining of the monocytic cells U-937 confirmed the quality of the anti-TLR4 antibody and the flow cytometry protocol used (Fig. 2, inset). By contrast, using a mild fixation and permeabilization protocol, we identified significant levels of cytoplasmic TLR4 in pulmonary epithelial cells (see Fig. 2, right panels). As an independent measure of the intracellular presence of TLR4 in these cells, surface proteins were labeled by a membrane-impermeable form of biotin. Biotinylated proteins were then extracted with neutravidinagarose beads followed by an immunoblot with an anti-TLR4"

A hallmark feature of IL-17 is its ability to induce expression of other cytokines and chemokines. In addition, IL-17 potently synergizes with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) to up-regulate expression of many target genes, particularly IL-6. Despite the many observations of IL-17 signaling synergy observed to date, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that underlie this phenomenon. In the osteoblastic cell line MC-3T3, we have found that IL-17 and TNFα exhibit potent synergy in mediating IL-6 secretion. Here, we show that at least part of the functional cooperation between IL-17 and TNFα occurs at the level of IL-6 gene transcription. Both the NF-κB and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP; NF-IL6) sites in the IL-6 promoter are important for cooperative gene expression, but NF-κB does not appear to be the direct target of the combined signal. Microarray analysis using the Affymetrix mouse MG-U74v2 chip identified C/EBPδ as another gene target of combined IL-17- and TNFα-induced signaling. Because C/EBP family members are known to control IL-6, we examined whether enhanced C/EBPδ expression is involved in the cooperative up-regulation of IL-6 by IL-17 and TNFα. Accordingly, we show that C/EBPδ (or the related transcription factor C/EBPβ) is essential for expression of IL-6. Moreover, overexpression of C/EBPδ (and, to a lesser extent, C/EBPβ) could substitute for the IL-17 signal at the level of IL-6 transcription. Thus, C/EBP family members, particularly C/EBPδ, appear to be important for the functional cooperation between IL-17 and TNFα.

Gurney A.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 71: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar). IL-17 is produced almost exclusively by activated T cells and is found predominantly in the T cell memory compartment (2.Fossiez F. Djossou O. Chomarat P. Flores-Romo L. Ait-Yahia S. Maat C. Pin J.J. Garrone P. Garcia E. Saeland S. Blanchard D. Gaillard C. Das Mahapatra B. Rouvier E. Golstein P. Banchereau J. Lebecque S. J. Exp.

In contrast, its receptor is ubiquitously expressed, making almost any cell a potential target of this cytokine (4.Yao Z. Fanslow W.C. Seldin M.F. Rousseau A.M. Painter S.L. Comeau M.R. Cohen J.I.

IL-17 has been implicated in a number of inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, allergic skin immune responses, and inflammation-induced bone loss (6.Albanesi C. Cavani A. Girolomoni G. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 494-502PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Kotake S. Udagawa N. Takahashi N. Matsuzaki K. Itoh K. Ishiyama S. Saito S. Inoue K. Kamatani N. Gillespie M.T.

Y.). 2001; 28: 378-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this cytokine amplifies the immune response by triggering the production of cytokines (IL-6, TNFα, and IL-1β), chemokines (RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted), MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1), MIP-2/IL-8, and GROα), cell-surface markers (RANKL and ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule-1)), and pro-inflammatory mediators (prostaglandin E2, nitric oxide, and cyclooxygenase-2) (reviewed in Ref. 1.Aggarwal S. Gurney A.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 71: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is clear that a major role of IL-17 is to interact with the cytokine network, trigger the release of inflammatory mediators, and thereby provide a link between T cell activation and inflammation. One of the main IL-17 signaling targets is the cytokine IL-6. Like most cytokines, IL-6 exerts pleiotropic biological effects, including induction of acute-phase proteins, B cell differentiation, and bone turnover (reviewed in Ref. 12.Taga T. Kishimoto T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 797-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). Expression of IL-6 is controlled at many points, particularly at the level of transcription; and consequently, numerous inflammatory agonists induce its expression. Indeed, the IL-6 promoter has been described as a biosensor for environmental stress and is activated by bacterial endotoxins; viruses; cell-surface molecules; hormones; and inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, TNFα, and transforming growth factor-β (13.Vanden Berghe W.

Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 796-803PubMed Google Scholar). IL-6 expression is also negatively controlled by glucocorticoids, estrogen, and androgens (17.Bellido T. Jilka R.L. Boyce B.F. Girasole G.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The receptor signaling pathways leading to IL-6 gene expression result in the activation of several transcription factors, including NF-κB, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP; NF-IL6), and AP-1 (14.Eickelberg O.

IL-17 has been shown to induce secretion of IL-6 in a variety of cell backgrounds, including macrophages, fibroblasts, osteoblasts, epithelial cells, and chondrocytes (4.Yao Z. Fanslow W.C.

Res. 1999; 14: 1513-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, the production of IL-6 is dramatically increased when cells are treated with IL-17 together with other pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-1β and TNFα (2.Fossiez F. Djossou O. Chomarat P. Flores-Romo L. Ait-Yahia S. Maat C. Pin J.J. Garrone P. Garcia E. Saeland S. Blanchard D. Gaillard C. Das Mahapatra B. Rouvier E. Golstein P. Banchereau J. Lebecque S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2593-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar). Importantly, the combination of IL-17 with TNFα and/or IL-1β better reproduces the microenvironment of most inflammatory diseases (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis), where all of these cytokines are present at elevated levels and probably act cooperatively or synergistically (reviewed in Refs. 24.Miossec P. Arthritis Rheum. 2003; 48: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar and 25.O'Dell J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 310-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In humans, antibodies to TNFα or soluble TNF receptor molecules are effective treatments for rheumatoid arthritis (25.O'Dell J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 310-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 26.Feldmann M. Brennan F.M. Elliott M.J. Williams R.O. Maini R.N. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 766: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, in a mouse model of arthritis, combining TNFα blockade with agents that also block IL-1β and IL-17 was found to be even more effective in controlling synovial inflammation and bone resorption than blocking TNFα alone (27.Chabaud M. Miossec P. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 1293-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Although numerous studies have addressed how inflammatory agonists work individually to drive IL-6 expression, far less is known about how they function in concert. IL-17 has been shown to exhibit signaling synergy with other cytokines or agonists in various systems (e.g. Refs. 6.Albanesi C. Cavani A. Girolomoni G. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 494-502PubMed Google Scholar and 28.Katz Y. Nadiv O. Rapoport M.J. Loos M. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2000; 120: 22-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 29.Shimada M. Andoh A.

Gahl G.M. Frei U. Jorres A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5814-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), yet the molecular mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon remain unclear. For example, cooperation between IL-17 and interferon-γ has been demonstrated in keratinocytes (6.Albanesi C. Cavani A. Girolomoni G. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 494-502PubMed Google Scholar), corneal fibroblasts (32.Maertzdorf J. Osterhaus A.D. Verjans G.M. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 5897-5903Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and pancreatic periacinar myofibroblasts (33.Takaya H. Andoh A. Makino J. Shimada M. Tasaki K. Araki Y. Bamba S. Hata K. Fujiyama Y. Bamba T. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 2002; 37: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Similarly, IL-17 and CD40L synergistically enhance IL-6 production in renal epithelial cells (34.Woltman A.M. de Haij S. Boonstra J.G. Gobin S.J. Daha M.R. van Kooten C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 2044-2055PubMed Google Scholar). One partial mechanism of synergy in this system is IL-17-induced upregulation of CD40 surface expression, yet other mechanisms such as convergence of signaling pathways probably exist. Furthermore, combinations of IL-17 and TNFα were shown to enhance mRNA transcript stability of IL-6, cyclooxygenase-2, and GROα (29.Shimada M. Andoh A. Hata K. Tasaki K. Araki Y. Fujiyama Y. Bamba T. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 31.Witowski J. Pawlaczyk K. Breborowicz A. Scheuren A. Kuzlan-Pawlaczyk M. Wisniewska J. Polubinska A. Friess H. Gahl G.M.

Acta. 2002; 1591: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), events that are probably dependent on MAPK signaling pathways (35.Andoh A. Shimada M. Bamba S. Okuno T. Araki Y. Fujiyama Y. Bamba T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1591: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 36.Andoh A. Hata K. Araki Y. Fujiyama Y. Bamba T. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 10: 631-634PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, cooperation in cytokine signaling clearly occurs at multiple levels. In this study, we have addressed the mechanism by which IL-17 and TNFα control synergistic expression of IL-6 in osteoblastic bone cells. Using microarray analysis, we identified C/EBPδ (NF-IL6β) as a target of the combined action of IL-17 and TNFα and show that this transcription factor appears to be involved in mediating cooperative transcriptional activation of the IL-6 gene by these cytokines. Cell Culture, Reagents, Stimulations, and ELISAs—Mouse calvaria-derived osteoblastic MC-3T3-E1 cells, wild-type MEFs (kindly provided by Dr. Wen-Chen Yeh), and C/EBPβδ–/– MEFs were cultured in α-MEM (Sigma) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Gemini Bioproducts, Woodland, CA), penicillin, streptomycin, and l-glutamine (Invitrogen). Recombinant human IL-17 and TNFα were obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). For stimulations, cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/ml in α-MEM and 10% FBS. Following attachment, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, incubated in α-MEM and 0.3% FBS overnight, and stimulated with the indicated cytokines for the designated time periods. Supernatants were analyzed in triplicate for IL-6 by sandwich ELISA (eBioscience and Pharmingen) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Microarray Analysis—MC-3T3 cells were grown to confluence in T-175 flasks (∼107 cells/sample). They were then incubated for 16 h in α-MEM and 0.3% FBS and stimulated with TNFα (2 ng/ml) alone or together with IL-17 (200 ng/ml) for 2 h, and total cellular RNA was prepared using the RNeasy kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA). Relative mRNA levels were assessed using the Affymetrix murine gene MGU74Av.2 chip, which contains all sequences in the Mouse UniGene Database (Build 74) that have been functionally characterized. Samples were processed into cRNA, hybridized to chips, and scanned at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute Gene Expression Core Facility (Buffalo, NY). Data sets were analyzed using Microarray Suite software (Version 5.0). Northern, Western, and EMSA Analyses—For Northern blotting, MC-3T3 cells or MEFs were incubated for 16 h in α-MEM and 0.3% FBS and stimulated for 2 h with the indicated cytokines. Total RNA was prepared using the RNeasy kit. RNA (10 μg/sample) was separated on a 1.4% denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gel; transferred to nylon membrane (Zeta-Probe, Bio-Rad); and probed with 32P-labeled cDNA probes corresponding to C/EBPδ (kindly provided by Dr. L. Vales), murine IL-6 (kindly provided by Dr. Heinz Baumann), and GAPD (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA). Probes were labeled using the Megaprime labeling system (Amersham Biosciences). For Western blotting, cells were stimulated as described above, and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (37.Gaffen S.L. Lai S.Y. Xu W. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Goldsmith M.A. Greene W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7192-7196Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 38.Latchman D.S. Rickwood D. Hames B.D. Transcription Factors: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1993: 1-26Google Scholar). Samples of nuclear extracts normalized to equal concentrations (20–40 μg/sample) were boiled in SDS sample buffer, separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blotted with antibodies to C/EBPδ (sc-151, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or α-tubulin (TU-01, Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). EMSAs were performed as described previously (37.Gaffen S.L. Lai S.Y. Xu W. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Goldsmith M.A. Greene W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7192-7196Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) with nuclear extract (10 μg/lane) and 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe (105 cpm/lane). The sequence of the wild-type NF-κB oligonucleotide probe (top strand only) is 5′-CAAAGATTTATCAAATGTGGGATTTTCCCATGA-3′, and the mutant NF-κB sequence is 5′-CAAAGATTTATCAAATGTAATATTTTCCCATGA-3′ (mutation site underlined). The anti-p65 antibody used for supershifting was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-109). To assess band intensities quantitatively, gels were scanned on a Bio-Rad GS-700 scanning densitometer and analyzed using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). The ratio of the intensity of the experimental bands relative to the control GAPD or tubulin bands was assessed, and the values of the unstimulated samples were subtracted from the experimental samples (as described in the legend to Fig. 4). Transfections and Luciferase Assays—For luciferase assays, 0.5 × 106 MC-3T3 cells were seeded on 12-well plates and cotransfected with the 1–2 μg of the indicated luciferase reporter plasmids using Lipo-fectAMINE (Invitrogen). The IL-6 promoter series linked to luciferase was kindly provided by Dr. O. Eickelberg (14.Eickelberg O. Pansky A. Mussmann R. Bihl M. Tamm M. Hildebrand P. Perruchoud A.P. Roth M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12933-12938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and the (NF-κB)5-luciferase reporter was provided by Dr. Xin Lin. Where indicated, cells were cotransfected with a 10-fold excess of a control vector (pCMV4) (39.Andersson S. Davis D.N. Dahlback H. Jornvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or pCMV5-C/EBPβ or pCMV5-C/EBPδ (generously provided by Dr. Lynn Vales) (40.Vales L.D. Friedl E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42438-42446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In all cases, 10 ng of the Renilla luciferase plasmid (kindly provided by Dr. Xin Lin) was cotransfected as an internal standard. Cells were then stimulated with the indicated cytokines for either 6 h (with the (NF-κB)5-luciferase reporter) or 24 h (with the IL-6-luciferase reporter) and lysed, and supernatants were analyzed for luciferase activity using an Orion MPL2 luminometer (Berthold Detection Systems, Oak Ridge, TN). For reconstitution of C/EBPβδ–/– MEFs, 0.5 × 105 cells were transfected with 2 μg of the indicated plasmids in Lipo-fectAMINE, and supernatants were analyzed for IL-6 as described above. IL-17 Synergizes with TNFα to Induce IL-6 Secretion—Similar to findings in other cell types (4.Yao Z. Fanslow W.C. Seldin M.F. Rousseau A.M. Painter S.L. Comeau M.R. Cohen J.I. Spriggs M.K. Immunity. 1995; 3: 811-821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar), we found that IL-17 induced the production of IL-6 in MC-3T3 cells in a dose-dependent manner following a 24-h stimulation (Fig. 1A). Surprisingly, very high levels of IL-17 (400–500 ng/ml) were needed to trigger maximal IL-17-induced IL-6 secretion. However, in the presence of low serum levels (0.3% FBS), even the highest amount of IL-6 secretion was still quite minimal, particularly in comparison with strong IL-6 inducers such as IL-1β or IL-17 plus TNFα (Fig. 1, A and B) (data not shown). In contrast, IL-17 triggered at least 5-fold higher levels of IL-6 than when cells were incubated in high concentrations (10%) of FBS (data not shown). Thus, IL-17 alone is a poor inducer of IL-6 secretion, although it is likely that IL-17 can function cooperatively with an unknown factor in serum to stimulate IL-6 expression. Accordingly, all subsequent experiments were performed following an overnight preincubation in low serum (0.3%) to eliminate the effects of confounding factors in serum. Although a relatively high concentration of IL-17 (200 ng/ml) was insufficient to induce dramatic IL-6 secretion under low serum conditions (Fig. 1A), we found that this concentration of IL-17 could potently synergize with a suboptimal dose of TNFα (Fig. 1, A and B). Note that the term synergy is defined as an effect greater than the sum of the that observed with either cytokine alone. It should also be noted that “suboptimal” concentrations of TNFα were determined empirically for each batch of cytokine and ranged between 0.02 and 2 ng/ml (Fig. 1B) (data not shown). Importantly, IL-17 did not trigger secretion of endogenous TNFα in these cells, 2M. J. Ruddy, unpublished data. and the medium alone did not contain residual IL-6. This functional cooperation between IL-17 and TNFα signaling occurred rapidly, with synergistic levels of IL-6 produced as early as 2 h post-stimulation (Fig. 1B). Functional Cooperation between IL-17 and TNFα Occurs Partially at the Level of IL-6 Transcription—Although signaling synergy between IL-17 and TNFα has been reported previously (6.Albanesi C. Cavani A. Girolomoni G. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 494-502PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Katz Y. Nadiv O. Rapoport M.J. Loos M. Clin. Exp.

Immunol. 2002; 169: 5897-5903Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), the mechanisms that underlie this phenomenon remain poorly understood. To determine whether these cytokines function synergistically or additively at the level of IL-6 gene transcription, we transfected a 651-bp region of the IL-6 promoter fused to the luciferase reporter gene (14.Eickelberg O. Pansky A. Mussmann R. Bihl M. Tamm M. Hildebrand P. Perruchoud A.P. Roth M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12933-12938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) into MC-3T3 cells and measured luciferase activity in response to IL-17, TNFα, or both cytokines together (Fig. 2A). Both IL-17 (200 ng/ml) and suboptimal levels of TNFα stimulated detectable reporter gene activity, whereas both cytokines together triggered an approximately additive increase in activity. This finding was highly reproducible and indicates that, although enhancement of IL-6 transcription does not entirely account for the signaling synergy between IL-17 and TNFα, it is at least partly responsible for the cooperative effects of these cytokines in regulating IL-6 expression. The IL-6 promoter contains binding sites for several transcription factors previously identified to be important for its regulation, including AP-1, C/EBP, and NF-κB (Ref. 14.Eickelberg O. Pansky A. Mussmann R. Bihl M. Tamm M. Hildebrand P. Perruchoud A.P. Roth M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12933-12938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar and references therein). Using promoter constructs specifically mutated at these sites, we found that the AP-1 site was not necessary for IL-17/TNFα-induced promoter activity (Fig. 2A and Table I). Note that the slight enhancement of overall reporter activity with the pIL-6-Luc651ΔAP-1 construct was not routinely observed. In contrast, in the IL-6 promoters containing mutations at the C/EBP or NF-κB sites, the overall magnitude of stimulation by IL-17, TNFα, or both cytokines together was greatly reduced. Interestingly, however, the constructs were still slightly stimulated by IL-17 or TNFα alone, and the cytokines together enhanced promoter activity still further (Table I). Thus, the NF-κB and C/EBP transcription factors appear to play important roles in regulating IL-6 gene expression, and they are also important, although perhaps not sufficient, for the cooperative action of IL-17 and TNFα.Table I-Fold increases in normalized luciferase activity values from Fig. 2ApIL-6-Luc651pIL-6-Luc651ΔAP-1pIL-6-Luc651ΔC/EBPpIL-6-Luc651ΔNF-κBUnstimulated1.01.01.01.0IL-171.92.21.71.4TNFα2.02.41.51.2IL-17 + TNFα4.04.32.11.9 Open table in a new tab Because the IL-6 promoter contains a binding site for NF-κB that is important for its transcription (19.Libermann T.A. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2327-2334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and because both IL-17 and TNFα have been reported to activate the NF-κB signaling pathway (4.Yao Z. Fanslow W.C. Seldin M.F. Rousseau A.M. Painter S.L. Comeau M.R. Cohen J.I. Spriggs M.K. Immunity. 1995; 3: 811-821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 41.Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 45-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar), we assessed whether IL-17 and TNFα together promote any increase in NF-κB activity by using a reporter construct containing five tandem NF-κB consensus sites cloned upstream of luciferase. IL-17 induced only minimal reporter gene activity with this construct, whereas TNFα triggered a much more marked enhancement of luciferase activity (Fig. 2B). Similarly, IL-17 and TNFα together did not show any enhancement of luciferase activity compared with TNFα alone at any concentration of IL-17 or TNFα used (Fig. 2B) (data not shown). We also examined the DNA-binding activity of NF-κB in MC-3T3 cells by EMSA using a probe encompassing the NF-κB site from the IL-6 promoter (Fig. 2C). IL-17 alone induced no detectable NF-κB-DNA binding in MC-3T3 cells even at very high concentrations of cytokine (Fig. 2C, second lane) (data not shown), whereas even low levels of TNFα (2 ng/ml) triggered substantial binding to the NF-κB probe (third lane). This binding was specific, as it did not occur when a mutant version of the NF-κB site was used (seventh through tenth lanes) and was competed specifically with an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide probe (data not shown). The band was further confirmed to contain NF-κB by supershifting the complex with an antibody to the p65 subunit of NF-κB (sixth lane). IL-17 and TNFα together did not promote significant enhancement of NF-κB-DNA binding compared with TNFα alone. (Note that, although the fourth lane shows a slight increase in DNA-binding activity, this was not a reproducible finding (data not shown).) Therefore, IL-17 and TNFα act in an additive manner to activate the IL-6 promoter. However, although both the C/EBP and NF-κB sites appear to be important for IL-6 gene expression, the direct target of functional cooperation does not appear to be NF-κB itself. IL-17 and TNFα Up-regulate C/EBPδ—To define further the molecular mechanism by which IL-17 and TNFα cooperate, we used microarrays to assess differences in gene expression in MC-3T3 cells stimulated with suboptimal concentrations of TNFα alone compared with TNFα and IL-17 together. We examined the shortest time point at which synergistic signaling leading to IL-6 production was apparent, viz. 2 h post-stimulation (Fig. 1B). Synergistic signaling was confirmed by showing that there was a 5-fold increase in IL-6 secreted from the IL-17/TNFα-stimulated samples compared with the TNFα-stimulated samples (Fig. 3A).

Recent analyses of human and mouse databases provided evidence that human and mouse genomes contain genes for still another novel CA isozyme hereby named CA XIII. In the present study, we modeled the structure of human CA XIII. This model revealed a globular molecule with high structural similarity to cytosolic isozymes, CA I, II, and III. Recombinant mouse CA XIII showed catalytic activity similar to those of mitochondrial CA V and cytosolic CA I, with kcat/Km of 4.3 × 107m–1 s–1, and kcat of 8.3 × 104 s–1. It is very susceptible to inhibition by sulfonamide and anionic inhibitors, with inhibition constants of 17 nm for acetazolamide, a clinically used sulfonamide, and of 0.25 μm, for cyanate, respectively. Using panels of cDNAs we evaluated human and mouse CA13 gene expression in a number of different tissues. In human tissues, positive signals were identified in the thymus, small intestine, spleen, prostate, ovary, colon, and testis. In mouse, positive tissues included the spleen, lung, kidney, heart, brain, skeletal muscle, and testis. We also investigated the cellular and subcellular localization of CA XIII in human and mouse tissues using an antibody raised against a polypeptide of 14 amino acids common for both human and mouse orthologues. Immunohistochemical staining showed a unique and widespread distribution pattern for CA XIII compared with the other cytosolic CA isozymes. In conclusion, the predicted amino acid sequence, structural model, distribution, and activity data suggest that CA XIII represents a novel enzyme, which may play important physiological roles in several organs.

Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) 1The abbreviations used are: CAs, carbonic anhydrases; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DAB, 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride. are zinc-containing metalloenzymes that catalyze reversible hydration of carbon dioxide in a reaction CO2+H2O⇆H++HCO3-. CAs are produced in a variety of tissues where they participate in several important biological processes such as acid-base balance, respiration, carbon dioxide and ion transport, bone resorption, ureagenesis, gluconeogenesis, body fluid generation, and lipogenesis (1.Sly W.S. Hu P.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 375-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 2.Parkkila S. Parkkila A.-K. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1996; 31: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The CA isozymes differ in their kinetic properties, their tissue distribution, and subcellular localization. The mammalian α-CA gene family has been reported to include at least eleven enzymatically active isoforms with different structural and catalytic properties (1.Sly W.S. Hu P.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 375-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 3.Hewett-Emmett D. Tashian R.E. Mol. Phylogenet. Evol. 1996; 5: 50-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Four of the active CA isozymes are cytosolic (CA I, II, III, and VII), four are membrane-associated (CA IV, IX, XII, and XIV), two are mitochondrial (CA VA and -VB), and one is a secretory form (CA VI). In addition to these isozymes with measurable CA activity, there are several proteins with homologous “CA-like” domains. These include e.g. carbonic anhydrase-related proteins (CA-RP)-VIII, CA-RP-X, CA-RP-XI, and receptor-type protein-tyrosine phosphatases (RPTP) β and γ (3.Hewett-Emmett D. Tashian R.E. Mol.

A common feature for these CA-like proteins is that some of the critical histidine residues in the active site are missing, and the zinc ion, which is necessary for the enzymatic activity, is not bound to the molecule. Recent exploitation of mammalian genomic data has allowed researchers to search for novel proteins including new isoforms of the existing protein families. The mouse CA13 cDNA sequence had been submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) data base by the Dr. Hewett-Emmett group in 2000. By comparing sequences, we also identified a human cDNA sequence, which appeared to encode human CA XIII protein. Based on the predicted amino acid sequence of human CA XIII and the known tertiary structure of CA I (9.Chakravarty S. Kannan K.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 298-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), we designed a computer-based model for the structure of CA XIII. We also studied the distribution of CA XIII gene and protein expression in a number of human and mouse tissues. Mouse CA XIII was produced in Escherichia coli, and the kinetic and inhibition data for the recombinant enzyme was measured using a colorimetric method. Phylogenetic Analysis—The sequence alignment of CAs was performed with ClustalW (10.Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55989) Google Scholar). The phylogenetic analysis was done with PAUP* 4.0 (11.Swofford, D. (2001) PAUP* 4.0 Sinauor AssociatesGoogle Scholar). The majority rule consensus tree was obtained by three bootstrap runs with different random seeds. The dataset was bootstrapped 1000 times for each run. Structure Modeling—The model of human CA XIII was based on the structure of the human CA I at 2.0 Å resolution (9.Chakravarty S. Kannan K.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 298-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) (PDB entry 1CZM). The model was built with the program InsightII (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA). Amino acid substitutions were built using a side chain rotamer library. The initial model was refined with Discover™ in a stepwise manner by energy minimization using the Amber™ force field. First, the newly built loops were refined with 500 steps of minimization with a fixed and a free backbone, respectively. Then, all side chains with a constrained backbone were minimized for 500 steps, followed by another 1000 steps of minimization for the whole model. Kinetic and Inhibition Measurements—Initial rates of CO2 hydration were measured with an SX.18MV-R Applied Photophysics stopped-flow instrument (Oxford, UK) by the changing pH indicator method (12.Khalifah R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 2561-2573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phenol red (at a concentration of 0.2 mm) was used as an indicator, working at the absorbance maximum of 557 nm, with 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 10 mm Tris, and 0.1 m Na2SO4, following the CA-catalyzed CO2 hydration reaction for a period of 10–100 s. Saturated CO2 solutions in water at 25 °C were used as substrate (12.Khalifah R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 2561-2573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stock solutions of inhibitors (1 mm) were prepared in distilled-deionized water with 10–20% (v/v) Me2SO (which is not inhibitory at these concentrations), and dilutions up to 0.1 nm were made thereafter with distilled-deionized water. Inhibitor and enzyme solutions were preincubated together for 10 min at room temperature prior to assay, in order to allow for the formation of the enzyme-inhibitor complex. Triplicate experiments were done for each inhibitor concentration, and the values reported throughout the study are the mean of such results. Inhibition constants were calculated as described earlier (13.Scozzafava A. Menabuoni L. Mincione F. Briganti F. Mincione G. Supuran C.T. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 4542-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Antibodies—The anti-mouse CA XIII serum was raised by Innovagen AB (Lund, Sweden) in a rabbit against a synthetic peptide (AC-) DG-DQQSPIEIKTKEC (-COOH), which was designed based on the predicted amino acid sequence of mouse CA XIII. This peptide was found to be identical in the predicted human CA XIII sequence (Fig. 1), and thus, the same antibody was also used to detect the human orthologue. Both mouse and human CA13 cDNA sequences are available in GenBank™ (accession numbers AF231123 and AK095314). Rabbit antisera against human CA I and II have been produced and characterized earlier (12.Khalifah R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 2561-2573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-mouse CA II antibody was raised against mouse CA II produced in E. coli. The specificity of the antibody was confirmed using blood lysates from both normal and CA II-deficient (Car-2–/–) mice (data not shown). Western Blotting—30 μg of protein from human colon, human liver, and mouse colon total homogenates or 20 μl of purified fraction from ProBond™ or inhibitor affinity chromatography were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions according to Laemmli (13.Scozzafava A. Menabuoni L. Mincione F. Briganti F. Mincione G. Supuran C.T. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 4542-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The separated proteins were stained by Colloidal Coomassie Blue (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) or transferred electrophoretically from the gel to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Invitrogen) in a Novex Xcell II blot module (Invitrogen). After the transblotting, the sample lines were detected by WesternBreeze chromogenic immunodetection system (Invitrogen) or ECL method (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The first antibodies were usually diluted 1:1000. His-tagged CA XIII was detected using anti-CA XIII serum or anti-HisG antibody (1:5000). In the control experiments, preimmune serum (1:1000) or a mixture of anti-human CA I, anti-human CA II, and anti-mouse CA II sera were used instead of the anti-CA XIII serum. Additional control experiments were also performed in the presence of the blocking peptide (1:1000 diluted antibody plus CA XIII peptide, 100 μg in 10 ml). Immunohistochemistry—Immunoperoxidase staining for human CA XIII was performed using the biotin-streptavidin complex method. In the mouse tissues, the localization of CA XIII was examined by both immunoperoxidase and immunofluorescence methods. Human and mouse tissue samples fixed in Carnoy's fluid and embedded in paraffin were cut at 5 μm sections and placed on microscope slides. The biotin-streptavidin complex method included the following steps: (a) pretreatment of the sections with undiluted cow colostral whey (Biotop, Oulu, Finland) for 30 min and rinsing in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS); (b) incubation for 1 h with the primary antiserum or preimmune serum diluted 1:100 in 1% bovine serum albumin-PBS solution (BSA-PBS); (c) incubation for 10 min with biotinylated second antibody (Histostain-plus, Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA); (d) incubation for 10 min with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Histostain-plus, Zymed Laboratories Inc.); (e) incubation for 3 min with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) solution (Liquid DAB substrate kit, Zymed Laboratories Inc.). The sections were washed three times for 5 min in PBS after incubation steps b and c and four times for 5 min after incubation step d. All of the incubations and washings were carried out at room temperature. Anti-human CA II serum was used as a positive control. Additional control staining was performed in the presence of the corresponding peptide (1:100 diluted anti-CA XIII serum plus 100 μg of peptide/100 μl of BSA-PBS). The sections were finally mounted in Neo-Mount (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The stained sections were examined and photographed with a Zeiss Axioskop 40 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany). Mouse CA XIII was immunostained by the biotin-streptavidin complex method by employing the following steps: (a) pretreatment of the sections with undiluted cow colostral whey (Biotop) for 40 min and rinsing in PBS; (b) incubation for 1 h with the primary antiserum or preimmune serum diluted 1:100 in 1% BSA-PBS; (c) incubation for 1 h with biotinylated second antibody diluted 1:300 in 1% BSA-PBS (ZyMax goat anti-rabbit IgG, Zymed Laboratories Inc.); (d) incubation for 30 min with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin diluted 1:750 in PBS (ZyMax, Zymed Laboratories Inc.); (e) incubation for 1 min with DAB solution (9 mg of DAB in 15 ml of PBS plus 5 μl of H2O2). The sections were washed three times for 10 min in PBS after incubation steps b and c and four times for 5 min after incubation step d. All of the incubations and washings were carried out at room temperature. Preimmune serum and anti-mouse CA II serum were used for control purposes. Mouse tissue sections were also stained by the immunofluorescence method and analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The steps in the immunofluorescence staining were as follows: (a) pretreatment of the sections with undiluted cow colostral whey (Biotop) for 40 min and rinsing in PBS; (b) incubation for 1 h with the primary antiserum or preimmune serum diluted 1:100 in 1% BSA-PBS; (c) incubation for 1 h with fluorescein-conjugated second antibody diluted 1:200 in 1% BSA-PBS (Alexa Fluor 488 F(ab′)2 fragment of goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L), Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The sections were washed three times for 10 min in PBS after incubation step b and four times for 5 min after incubation step c. The sections were finally mounted in glycerol. The immunofluorescent sections were examined with a confocal laser scanning microscopy (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). PCR Methods—The expression of human and mouse CA XIII mRNAs were examined using cDNA kits purchased from BD Biosciences (Palo Alto, CA). The cDNAs included in MTC™ panels were used as templates for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using CA XIII gene-specific primers. The human MTC™ panel II and mouse MTC™ panel I (BD Biosciences) contained first strand cDNA preparations produced from total poly(A) RNAs isolated from a number of different tissues. Two primers for amplifying human CA13 cDNA were chosen based on the human cDNA sequence (accession number AK095314), which appeared to encode human CA XIII; forward 5′-ACAACGGTCCTATTCACT-3′ (nucleotides 83–100) and reverse 5′-CAGGATATGTCCAGTAGT-3′ (nucleotides 623–640), which generated a 557-bp product. The primers were produced by Sigma Genosys. To amplify mouse CA13 cDNA, three primers (Sigma Genosys) were chosen based on the mouse CA13 sequence published in GenBank™ (AF231123); forward (F1) 5′-GTCCCTGCCACAGGCTCT-3′ (nucleotides 3–20) and reverse (R1) 5′-TGCACAAGAGGCTTCGGA-3′ (nucleotides 712–729), which generated a 730-bp product. Forward primer F1 together with reverse primer (R2) 5′-ATACATTGGGGCAAATCT-3′ (nucleotides 993–1010) generated a full-length 1008-bp amplification product. Primers for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH, BD Biosciences) were used to monitor the quality of the cDNA samples. 5 ng of total cDNA was used as a template for PCR. All the reagents for PCR were from BD Biosciences. The PCR reactions were amplified on the thermal cycler (Gene Amp PCR system 9700, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The PCR amplification for human CA13 was performed using a three-step method. The PCR cycling parameters consisted of denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 33 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 50 °C for 30 s and extension at 72 °C for 1 min 30 s, followed by final extension at 72 °C for 3 min. The PCR amplification for mouse CA13 with primer F1 and R1 was performed using a two-step method recommended by the manufacturer. The PCR cycling parameters consisted of denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 33 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s and extension and annealing at 68 °C for 2 min, followed by final extension at 68 °C for 3 min. The PCR amplifications for mouse spleen and 17-day-old embryo with primers F1 and R2 were also performed using a three-step method consisting cycling parameters of denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 33 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s and extension at 72 °C for 1 min 30 s, followed by final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gel containing 0.1 μg/ml ethidium bromide with DNA standard (100 bp DNA Ladder, New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Sequencing the PCR Products—The PCR products from the human thymus, mouse spleen, and mouse 17-day-embryo were purified from agarose gel using GFX™ PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification kit (Amersham Biosciences). The sequencing was performed using ABI PRISM™ Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reactions Kit, version 2.0 (Applied Biosystems) following the protocol of the manufacturer. First, 5 μl of DNA template was mixed with 4 μl of Terminator Ready Reaction Mix (Applied Biosystems) and 1.6 pmol of the primer was added to the reaction mixture. Second, the reactions were amplified by cycle sequencing on the Gene Amp PCR system 9700 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems). The cycling parameters consisted of 25 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 10 s, annealing at 50 °C for 5 s and extension at 60 °C for 4 min. Third, after cycle sequencing, the extension products were purified by ethanol precipitation method recommended by the manufacturer. After purification the samples were resuspended to Template Suppression Reagent (Applied Biosystems) and denatured according to the manufacturer's protocol. The sequencing was finally performed on the ABI PRISM™ 3100 Genetic Analyser instrument (Applied Biosystems). Expression and Purification of the His-tagged CA XIII—The full-length PCR product from mouse 17-day-embryo was cloned into the E. coli TOP 10 bacterium using pTrcHis TOPO TA expression kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. First, the PCR product was cloned into the TOPO vector and then the recombinant vector was transformed into E. coli. The transformed bacteria were incubated overnight at 37 °C on LB (Luria Bertani) plates containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 0.5% glucose. Several colonies were picked for analysis of positive clones. First, the colonies were cultured overnight in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 0.5% glucose at 37 °C. Then the plasmids were isolated using QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The isolated plasmids were analyzed by restriction analysis and by sequencing. The restriction analysis was performed using two restriction enzymes, BamHI and HindIII (New England Biolabs), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The sequencing was performed using ABI PRISM™ Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reactions Kit, version 2.0 (Applied Biosystems) following the protocol of the manufacturer. The sequence primers, Xpress Forward primer and pTrcHis Reverse primer were from Invitrogen. E. coli TOP 10 strain transformed with pTrcHis plasmid containing mouse CA XIII cDNA was grown at 37 °C in 50 ml of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 0.5% glucose to an O.D of 0.6 at 600 nm. The inducer, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, was then added to a final concentration of 1 mm and then the culture was incubated at 37 °C. The cells were harvested after 5 h by centrifugation, and the pellet was frozen at –80 °C for later use. For large scale expression the bacteria were grown in 1 liter of LB medium. The bacterial cell pellet was resuspended in 160 ml of lysing buffer (50 mm NaHPO4, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 8.0) and 160 mg lysozyme (Sigma) was added. The resuspended cells were incubated on ice 30 min and lysed by pipetting. Bacterial cell components were removed by centrifugation (13,000 rpm, 15 min, +4 °C). The supernatant was directly applied onto either Invitrogen′s ProBond™ -purification system or conventional CA-inhibitor affinity chromatography purification. The ProBond™ is a nickel-charged agarose resin that has been designed to purify recombinant proteins containing a polyhistidine sequence. The ProBond™ purification was performed under native conditions according to Invitrogen's protocol. The bound enzyme was eluted using 250 mm imidazole, pH 8.0. The inhibitor affinity chromatography was performed using the carboxymethyl (CM) Bio-Gel A (BioRad Laboratories, Richmond, CA) coupled to p-aminomethylbenzene-sulfonamide. The gel was washed using 10 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl and the bound enzyme was eluted using 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.6, containing 0.5 m sodium perchlorate. The purified His-tagged CA XIII was visualized by two methods: Colloidal Coomassie Blue protein stain (Invitrogen) and Western blotting. Phylogenesis and Structural Model of CA XIII—Fig. 1 shows the amino acid sequence alignment of human CAs including the novel isozyme, CA XIII. All three histidine residues (His-94, -96, and -119) known to be critical for CA enzymatic activity are conserved in the predicted human and mouse (data not shown) CA XIII sequences. The phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 2) showed that CAs form three distinct clusters. CA I, II, III, V, and VII are clustered together as cytosolic/intracellular CAs. The second cluster includes extracellular and membrane-bound isozymes CA IV, VI, IX, XII, and XIV. The CA-RP VIII, X, and XI belong to the third cluster. The novel CA XIII is most closely related to CA I, II, and III with about 60% sequence identity, and thus, is clustered as cytosolic/intracellular isoform. In Fig. 3, the surfaces of three CAs (human CA I (1CZM), human CA II (1CNX), and human CA XIII) are colored according to the hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties of amino acids. The superimposition of these structures indicates that the location of the inhibitor binding pocket is conserved. The sulfonamide-type inhibitors are located inside the cavity and are bound to the zinc and the hydrophobic patch of the active site. The sequence similarity between the template (human CA I) and the target (human CA XIII) was 77%. A sequence identity above 50% generally guarantees that the modeled protein structure is correct at a level comparable to that of an x-ray crystal structure (16.Sanchez R. Sali A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 206-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The sequence alignment showed that the three Zn2+ coordinating histidine residues are conserved in CA XIII molecule. Therefore, the Zn2+ ion was directly merged into the structural model. The quality of the final model was checked using the three-dimensional profiles verification (17.Luthy R. Bowie J.U. Eisenberg D. Nature. 1992; 356: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2610) Google Scholar) and PROCHECK (18.Rodriguez R. Chinea G. Lopez N. Pons T. Vriend G. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional profiles verification method showed that the three-dimensional/one-dimensional scores of our model were always positive, which are within the range of scores for x-ray structure determinations. Additionally, PROCHECK confirmed that the model of human CA XIII had good geometric structural parameters. Catalytic Activity and Inhibition by Sulfonamides and Anions—Table I shows the kinetic parameters for the CO2 hydration reaction catalyzed by several α-CAs including recombinant mouse CA XIII.

Open table in a new tab CA13 Gene Expression—CA13 gene expression was investigated by PCR amplification of commercially available sets of cDNAs produced for selected human and mouse tissues. Human CA XIII mRNA was expressed in the thymus and small intestine, testis, spleen, prostate, ovary, and colon (Fig. 4). No CA XIII transcript was detected in the human leukocytes. In the mouse tissues, the positive signals were detected in the spleen, lung, kidney, heart, brain, skeletal muscle, testis, 7-day-old embryo, 11-day-old embryo, 15-day-old embryo, and 17-day-old embryo (Fig. 5). No CA XIII transcript was detected in the mouse liver.Fig. 5Mouse CA XIII mRNA expression analyzed by PCR amplification. The strongest signals were detected in the spleen, lung, kidney, 7-day-old embryo, and 17-day-old embryo, followed by the heart, brain, skeletal muscle, testis, 11-day-old embryo, and 15-day-old embryo. No signal was detected in the liver. All cDNAs were amplified using intrinsic primers (A) and spleen and 17-day-old embryo were selected to amplify a 1008-bp fragment representing full-length CA13 cDNA (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Sequencing the PCR Amplification Products—Automated sequencing of the PCR products confirmed that correct CA13 sequences were amplified from the cDNAs of human thymus, mouse spleen, and 17-day-old mouse embryo. The primers for mouse CA13 were designed to obtain a full-length cDNA, while the corresponding human PCR product represented only a partial one. For sequencing the PCR product of human CA13 cDNA was amplified forward from the 5′-end, while mouse CA13 was amplified from both the 5′- and 3′-ends covering the whole coding sequence. The results clearly indicated that the PCR fragments represented CA13 cDNAs in both species. Localization of CA XIII in Human and Mouse Tissues— Immunoreactivity of anti-CA XIII serum was confirmed by Western blotting. Single, 30-kDa polypeptides were detected in the human and mouse colon, while the signal in the human liver was barely apparent (Fig. 6). The control experiments using preimmune serum or peptide blocking were negative. The immunolocalization studies for CA XIII revealed three major features on this novel enzyme: First, CA XIII showed an intracellular staining pattern, typical for cytosolic proteins. Second, there were distinct differences in the distribution of CA XIII between human and mouse tissues. Third, CA XIII was found in a number of different tissues in both species. Although the distribution of CA XIII resembles that of CA II in several tissues, we found some differences that make CA XIII unique with respect to its localization. In the human alimentary tract, CA XIII was found in a number of tissues from the salivary glands to the large intestine. In the submandibular gland, CA XIII was expressed in serous acinar cells and duct epithelial cells (Fig. 7). Compared with CA II, CA XIII showed stronger signal in the duct epithelium. In the gastric mucosa, CA XIII showed only very weak staining in the surface epithelial cells of the body"

Exposure of cells to certain nitric oxide (NO) donors also induces HIF-1α expression under nonhypoxic conditions. We demonstrate that exposure of cells to the NO donor NOC18 or S-nitrosoglutathione induces HIF-1α expression and transcriptional activity. In contrast to hypoxia, NOC18 did not inhibit HIF-1α hydroxylation, ubiquitination, and degradation, indicating an effect on HIF-1α protein synthesis that was confirmed by pulse labeling studies. NOC18 stimulation of HIF-1α protein and HIF-1-dependent gene expression was blocked by treating cells with an inhibitor of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or MAPK-signaling pathway. These inhibitors also blocked NOC18-induced phosphorylation of the translational regulatory proteins 4E-BP1, p70 S6 kinase, and eIF-4E, thus providing a mechanism for the modulation of HIF-1α protein synthesis. In addition, expression of a dominant-negative form of Ras significantly suppressed HIF-1 activation by NOC18. We conclude that the NO donor NOC18 induces HIF-1α synthesis under conditions of NO formation during normoxia and that hydroxylation of HIF-1α is not regulated by NOC18.

However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate HIF-1α expression and transactivation in response to NO donors are poorly defined. In this study, we found that NOC18 induces HIF-1 activity by increasing HIF-1α protein synthesis via PI3K- and MAPK-dependent pathways.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Reagents—Hep3B cells, HEK293 cells, and HCT116 cells were maintained in minimal essential medium with Earle's salts, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and McCoy's 5A medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin.

Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21166-21172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g to pellet cell debris. For HIF-1α and HIF-1β, 100-μg aliquots were fractionated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and subjected to an immunoblot assay using mouse monoclonal antibody against HIF-1α (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) or HIF-1β (H1β234; Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO) at 1:1000 dilution. Signal was developed using ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). For phosphorylated protein, HEK293 cells or HCT116 cells were serum-starved (0.1% fetal bovine serum for 24 h) and treated with NOC18, and 50-μg aliquots were analyzed using specific antibodies (1:1000 dilution) (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Signal was developed by using ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences).Inhibitor Treatments—PD98059, LY294002, genistein, or rapamycin was added 1 h before exposure to NOC18 or 1% O2. CHX was added to the medium of HEK293 cells that were treated with NOC18, GSNO, or DFX for 4 h, and whole cell extracts were prepared at 15, 30, and 60 min.RT-PCR—The protocol of RT-PCR is described elsewhere (33.Ang S.O. Chen H. Hirota K. Gordeuk V.R. Jelinek J. Guan Y. Liu E. Sergueeva A.I. Miasnikova G.Y. Mole D. Maxwell P. Stockton D.W. Semenza G.L. Prchal J.T. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed, and RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). 0.5 μg of total RNA were subjected to first strand cDNA synthesis using the SuperScript II RT kit (Invitrogen) with random hexamers. cDNAs were amplified with TaqGold polymerase in a thermal cycler with the following primer pairs: HIF1A, GAAAGCGCAAGTCCTCAAA and CTATATGGTGATGATGTGGCACTA; VEGF, CCATGAACTTTCTGCTGTCTT and ATCGCATCAGGGGCACACAG; GLUT1, GGGCATGTGCTTCCAGTATGT and ACGAGGAGCACCGTGAAGAT; 18 S, ATCCTGCCAGTAGCATATGC and ACCCGGGTTGGTTTTGATCTG. For each primer pair, PCR was optimized for cycle number to obtain linearity between the amount of input RT product and output PCR product. Thermocycling conditions were 30 s at 94 °C, 60 s at 57 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C for 25 (HIF1A), 27 (VEGF), or 14 (18 S rRNA) cycles preceded by 10 min at 94 °C. PCR products were fractionated by 3% Nusieve agarose gel electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized with UV.Metabolic Labeling Assay—The protocol is described elsewhere (8.Laughner E. Taghavi P. Chiles K. Mahon P.C. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3995-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar). Briefly, a total of HEK293 cells were plated in a 10-cm dish, and 24 h later the cells were serum-starved for 20 h. The cells were pretreated with 500 μm NOC18 or 100 μm DFX for 30 min in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. [35S]Met-Cys was added to a final concentration of 0.3 mCi/ml, and the cells were pulse-labeled for 20–40 min and then harvested. Whole cell extracts were prepared, and 1 mg of extract was precleared with 60 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 1 h. 20 μl of anti-HIF-1 antibody H1 67 was added to the supernatant and rotated overnight at 4 °C. 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose was added, rotated for 2 h at 4 °C, pelleted, and washed five times with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer. The samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film.Immunoprecipitation Assay—Cells were harvested in 200 μl of lysis buffer (Dulbecco's PBS (pH 7.4), 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and Complete protease inhibitor) and drawn through a 20-gauge needle four times. The lysate was incubated on ice for 1 h, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min. The cleared lysates were brought to a volume of 1 ml with lysis buffer followed by a 2-h incubation with 20 μl of anti-HA (Roche Applied Science) or anti-FLAG (Sigma) affinity matrix beads at 4 °C on a rotator. The beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer. Protein was eluted by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis (16.Mahon P.C. Hirota K. Semenza G.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2675-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar).In Vitro HIF-1α-VHL Interaction Assay—Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-HIF-1α(429–608) fusion protein was expressed in E. coli as described (16.Mahon P.C.

Biotinylated methionine-labeled proteins were generated in reticulocyte lysates using the TNT T7 coupled transcription/translation system using Transcend biotinylated tRNA (Promega). 25-μg aliquots of HEK293 cell lysate were preincubated with NO donor or DFX for 30 min at 30 °C, 2.5 μg of GST-HIF-1α(429–608) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. A 5-μl aliquot of in vitro translated biotinylated VHL protein was mixed with 4 μg of GST fusion protein in a final volume of 200 μl of binding buffer (Dulbecco's PBS (pH 7.4), 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation followed by the addition of 10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) and incubation at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were pelleted, washed 3 times in binding buffer, pelleted again, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and visualized using streptavidin-labeled horseradish peroxidase and ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences).In Vitro Ubiquitination Assay—HEK293 cells were washed twice with cold hypotonic extraction buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and lysed in a Dounce homogenizer. The cell extract was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was stored at 70 °C. Ubiquitination assays were performed as described previously (33.Ang S.O. Chen H. Hirota K. Gordeuk V.R. Jelinek J. Guan Y. Liu E. Sergueeva A.I. Miasnikova G.Y. Mole D. Maxwell P. Stockton D.W. Semenza G.L. Prchal J.T. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). 2 μl of HA-HIF-1α that was in vitro translated (TNT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System; Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine was incubated at 30 °C in a volume of 40 μl containing 27 μl (50 μg) of cell extract, 4 μl of 10× ATP-regenerating system (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm ATP, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 300 mm creatine phosphate, 0.5 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase), 4 μl of 5 mg/ml ubiquitin (Sigma), 1 μl of 150 μm ubiquitin aldehyde (Sigma), and HA-HIF-1α was recovered using anti-HA-agarose beads, which were then mixed with SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. The eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.Reporter Gene Assays—Reporter assays were performed in Hep3B cells and HEK293 cells (32.Hirota K. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21166-21172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 34.Itoh T. Namba T. Kazuhiko F. Semenza L.G. Hirota K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). 5 × 104 cells were plated per well on the day before transfection. In each transfection, the indicated dose of test plasmids, 200 ng of reporter gene plasmid, and 50 ng of the control plasmid pTK-RL (Promega), containing a thymidine kinase promoter upstream of Renilla reniformis (sea pansy) luciferase coding sequences, were premixed with Fugene 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). In each assay, the total amount of DNA was held constant by the addition of empty vector. After treatment, the cells were harvested, and the luciferase activity was determined using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). The ratio of firefly to sea pansy luciferase activity was determined. For each experiment, at least two independent transfections were performed in triplicate.X-gal Staining—HEK293 cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with 1% formaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde solution, washed twice with PBS, and then treated with an X-gal staining solution (5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.04% X-gal) at 37 °C (28.Harada H. Hiraoka M. Kizaka-Kondoh S. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2013-2018PubMed Google Scholar).RESULTSNO Donors Activate HIF-1 under Nonhypoxic Conditions—To study the effect of NO on HIF-1 activation, we tested several NO donors. NORs and NOCs spontaneously release NO with different kinetics (see “Experimental Procedures”), whereas GSNO and SNP require cellular thiol for NO release. HEK293 cells were exposed to the compounds for 1–4 h at 20% O2, harvested, and subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-HIF-1α or anti-HIF-1β antibody (Fig. 1A). Neither NOR4 nor NOR5 induced HIF-1α protein accumulation (lanes 2–5). In contrast, exposure of cells to NOC18 or GSNO efficiently induced HIF-1α protein accumulation comparably with 100 μm DFX (lanes 6–8, 12, and 13). SNP did not induce HIF-1α accumulation (lanes 10 and 11). Expression of HIF-1β was not affected by NO donors or DFX. NOCs induced accumulation of HIF-1α with quite different kinetics as compared with GSNO. NOC18-induced accumulation was detected as early as 30 min and lasted no less than 8 h. The effect of GSNO peaked at 1 h (lane 8) and was lost by 4 h after the addition (lane 9).NOC18 induced HIF-1α accumulation in a dose-dependent manner up to 500 μm (Fig. 1B). Induction by GSNO was saturated at a concentration of 100 μm. The accumulation of HIF-1α induced by NOC12, which releases NO by the same mechanism as NOC18 but has a different NO-releasing time constant, was stronger than that induced by NOC18 at 30 min at a concentration of 250 μm (Fig. 1C, top panel). However, the induction of HIF-1α was dose-dependent such that the effect of 40 μm NOC12 was weaker than 500 μm NOC18 (Fig. 1C, bottom panel).We screened other cell lines for the effect of NO donors on HIF-1α protein levels. 500 μm NOC18 induced HIF-1α accumulation in Hep3B human hepatocellular carcinoma cells and HCT116 human colorectal carcinoma cells as strongly as 100 μm DFX (data not shown). NOC18 also induced HIF-1α in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (data not shown). These results indicate that the effect of NOC18 on HIF-1α expression is observed in multiple transformed and primary cell types.We investigated by RT-PCR whether NO donors induced gene expression downstream of HIF-1. VEGF and GLUT1 mRNA expression was induced by NOC18 treatment under nonhypoxic conditions (Fig. 2). In contrast, HIF-1α mRNA expression was not affected by NOC18 treatment, indicating that the effect of NOC18 occurs at the level of HIF-1α protein expression. HEK293 cells were transfected with the reporter p2.1, containing a HIF-1-dependent HRE, or p2.4, containing a mutated HRE. NOC18 induced HRE-dependent gene expression in a dose-dependent manner comparably with DFX or 1% O2 (Fig. 3, A and B). The mutated reporter p2.4 was not activated by NOC18 (Fig. 3B), and expression of a dominant negative form of HIF-1α reduced p2.1 reporter gene expression (Fig. 3C), providing evidence that the gene activation was HRE- and HIF-1-dependent. NOC18 also induced dose-dependent transcription of a reporter gene containing the VEGF promoter encompassing nucleotides –2274 to +379 relative to the transcription start site (Fig. 3D).Fig. 2Effect of NOC18 on expression of HIF-1 target genes. HEK293 cells were treated with NOC18 or DFX for 24 h, and total RNA was isolated. Expression of VEGF, GLUT1, and HIF-1α mRNA and 18 S rRNA was analyzed by RT-PCR.View Large"

Although expanded polyglutamine triggers disease, functional properties of host polyglutamine proteins also must influence pathogenesis. Using complementary in vitro and cell-based approaches we establish that the polyglutamine disease protein, ataxin-3, is a poly-ubiquitin-binding protein. In stably transfected neural cell lines, normal and expanded ataxin-3 both co-precipitate with poly-ubiquitinated proteins that accumulate when the proteasome is inhibited. In vitro pull-down assays show that this reflects direct interactions between ataxin-3 and higher order ubiquitin conjugates; ataxin-3 binds K48-linked tetraubiquitin but not di-ubiquitin or mono-ubiquitin. Further studies with domain-deleted and site-directed mutants map tetra-ubiquitin binding to ubiquitin interaction motifs situated near the polyglutamine domain. In surface plasmon resonance binding analyses, normal and expanded ataxin-3 display similar submicromolar dissociation constants for tetra-ubiquitin. Binding kinetics, however, are markedly influenced by the surrounding protein context; ataxin-3 that lacks the highly conserved, amino-terminal josephin domain shows significantly faster association and dissociation rates for tetra-ubiquitin binding. Our results establish ataxin-3 as a poly-ubiquitin-binding protein, thereby linking its normal function to protein surveillance pathways already implicated in polyglutamine pathogenesis.

Most acquired and inherited neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by abnormal protein folding, processing, and/or aggregation (1Michalik A. Van Broeckhoven C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 173-186Google Scholar, 2Taylor J.P. Hardy J. Fischbeck K.H. Science. 2002; 296: 1991-1995Google Scholar, 3Perutz M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 58-63Google Scholar). This is particularly well documented for the polyQ diseases, a group of at least nine dominantly inherited disorders in which expanded CAG repeat mutations encode abnormally long polyQ tracts in the various disease proteins (1Michalik A. Van Broeckhoven C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 173-186Google Scholar, 4Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 217-247Google Scholar). It is widely agreed that expanded polyQ triggers disease, but precisely how it causes neuronal dysfunction and cell death remains elusive. Expanded polyQ is prone to misfold and aggregate, forming intraneuronal, ubiquitin-positive inclusions. These inclusions also sequester components of the proteasome and other proteins, including molecular chaperones. Studies from a wide range of cell and animal models implicate the quality control machinery of the cell, notably chaperones and the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, in disease pathogenesis (1Michalik A. Van Broeckhoven C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 173-186Google Scholar, 5Opal P. Zoghbi H.Y. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 232-236Google Scholar, 6Bonini N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although it is clear that expanded polyQ triggers disease, host protein context must also contribute to pathogenesis in unique ways for each disease (8La Spada A.R. Taylor J.P. Neuron. 2003; 38: 681-684Google Scholar). Other than sharing polyQ, the nine disease proteins are entirely unrelated and likely serve different functions in the cell. For example, the polyQ disorders Huntington disease and spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (also known as Machado-Joseph disease, or SCA3/MJD) manifest with very distinct clinical and pathological features. Most likely this reflects the fact that the two gene products, huntingtin and ataxin-3, bind different protein partners and function in distinct cellular pathways. Accordingly, a full understanding of each polyQ disease will require that the functional properties of each host protein also be defined. In the current study we explore the function of the SCA3/MJD disease protein, ataxin-3 (9Kawaguchi Y. Okamoto T. Taniwaki M. Aizawa M. Inoue M. Katayama H. Nakamura S. Nishimura M. Akiguchi I. Kimura J. Narumiya S. Kakizuka A. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 221-228Google Scholar). The smallest of the polyQ disease proteins, ataxin-3, resides both in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it binds the nuclear matrix (10Tait D. Riccio M. Sittler A. Scherzinger E. Santi S. Ognibene A.

Despite in vitro studies that have successfully modeled ataxin-3 protein folding (14Bevivino A.E. Loll P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11955-11960Google Scholar), relatively little is known about its functional properties. Some studies suggest that ataxin-3 negatively regulates gene expression events (15Chai Y. Wu L. Griffin J.D. Paulson H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44889-44897Google Scholar, 16Li F. Macfarlan T. Pittman R.N. Chakravarti D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45004-45012Google Scholar), perhaps by inhibiting histone acetyltransferases, but there is no direct evidence that ataxin-3 functions as a transcription factor or cofactor. An important clue to its possible function surfaced in a recent bioinformatics study, revealing that ataxin-3 contains predicted ubiquitin interaction motifs, or UIMs (17Hofmann K. Falquet L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 347-350Google Scholar). These short motifs have been shown to mediate ubiquitin binding by UIM-containing proteins, many of which function in nonproteasomal ubiquitin pathways such as vesicular trafficking (18Bilodeau P.S. Urbanowski J.L. Winistorfer S.C. Piper R.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 534-539Google Scholar, 19Raiborg C. Bache K.G. Gillooly D.J. Madshus I.H. Stang E. Stenmark H. Nat.

The existence of predicted UIMs in ataxin-3 is especially intriguing because ubiquitin-proteasome pathways have already been implicated in SCA3/MJD and other polyQ diseases (7Berke S.J. Paulson H.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 253-261Google Scholar, 21Chai Y. Koppenhafer S. Shoesmith S. Perez M. Paulson H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 673-682Google Scholar, 22Cummings C.J. Reinstein E. Sun Y. Antalffy B. Jiang Y. Ciechanover A. Orr H.T. Beaudet A.L. Zoghbi H.Y. Neuron. 1999; 24: 879-892Google Scholar). Moreover, ataxin-3 has a property unique among polyQ disease proteins in that the normal ataxin-3 protein localizes to neuronal protein inclusions known as Marinesco bodies, ubiquitin-rich aggregates found in normal aged brain (23Fujigasaki H.

The presence of UIMs in ataxin-3 raises the intriguing possibility that ataxin-3 is normally a ubiquitin-binding protein and that its colocalization to ubiquitin-conjugated protein inclusions is mediated by this property. Using in vitro and cell-based methodologies, we now establish that ataxin-3 is indeed a poly-ubiquitin-binding protein, with binding mediated by UIMs situated near the polyQ tract. Our results, which confirm and extend recently published studies by others (28Donaldson K.M. Li. W. Ching K.A. Batalov S. Tsai C.C. Joazeiro C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8892-8897Google Scholar, 29Doss-Pepe E.W. Stenroos E.S. Johnson W.G. Madura K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6469-6483Google Scholar), suggest that ataxin-3 differs from some UIM-containing proteins in that it binds poly-ubiquitin chains but not mono-ubiquitin. Our studies further reveal that binding kinetics are markedly influenced by surrounding protein context. Plasmid Constructs—The ataxin-3 expression constructs pcDNA3-myc-Atx-3(Q28) and pcDNA3-myc-Atx-3(Q84) were described previously (26Chai Y. Koppenhafer S.L. Bonini N.M. Paulson H.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10338-10347Google Scholar). Plasmid pcDNA3-myc-Atx-3(Q64) was generated by reverse transcription-PCR amplification of the 3′ segment of ataxin-3 cDNA from patient lymphoblastoid cells and subcloning the sequence-verified product into pcDNA3-myc-Atx-3 (Q28) (15Chai Y. Wu L. Griffin J.D. Paulson H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44889-44897Google Scholar). pcDNA3-myc-Atx-3(QHQ) was generated through splice overlap extension PCR using primers that eliminated the CAG repeat. pcDNA3-myc-Atx-3(Q50) was generated during a PCR reaction as a spontaneous reduction to an intermediate length repeat of 50. pHis8-Atx-3(Q22)-WT, pHis8-Atx-3(Q22)-S→Ax3, pHis8-Atx-3-Nterm were kindly provided by Dr. Claudio Joazeiro (Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation, San Diego, CA). pGEX-4T1-Atx-3(QHQ), pGEX-4T1-Atx-3(Q28), pGEX-4T1-Atx-3(Q50), pGEX-4T1-Atx-3(Q64), pGEX-4T1-Atx-3(Q84) were constructed by digesting the corresponding pcDNA3-Atx-3 expression plasmids with BamHI and cloning the released ataxin-3 fragment into pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Biosciences). pcDNA3-myc-Atx-3(Q22)C-WT and pcDNA3-myc-Atx-3(Q22)C-S→Ax3 were generated by PCR amplification using pcDNA3-myc-Atx-3(Q22)-WT or pcDNA3-myc-Atx-3(Q22)S→Ax3 as the template DNA, respectively; the PCR product was then digested with BamHI/NotI and subcloned into pcDNA3-myc plasmid. pHis8-Atx-3(Q22)C-WT and pHis8-Atx-3(Q22)C-S→ Ax3 were constructed by digesting the corresponding pcDNA3-myc-Atx-3 plasmids with BamHI/NotI and subcloning the released ataxin-3 cDNA into pHis8 expression vector (kindly provided by Dr. Claudio Joazeiro, Novartis). All plasmids generated by us were verified by restriction enzyme digest and sequence analyses. Cell Transfection and Co-immunoprecipitation—Methods for cell culture, transfection, immunofluorescence, co-immunoprecipitation, and Western blot were described previously (15Chai Y. Wu L. Griffin J.D. Paulson H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44889-44897Google Scholar, 21Chai Y. Koppenhafer S. Shoesmith S. Perez M. Paulson H. Hum. Mol.

Stably transfected, doxycycline-inducible PC6–3 cell lines were generated as described previously (30Miller V.M. Xia H. Marrs G.L. Gouvion C.M. Lee G. Davidson B.L. Paulson H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7195-7200Google Scholar). The clones PC6–3-ataxin-3(Q28)#33, PC6–3-ataxin-3(Q84)#18, and PC6–3-ataxin-3(Q108)#9 were chosen because they were tightly inducible and exhibited robust ataxin-3 expression. For the ataxin-3/ubiquitinated protein co-immunoprecipitation experiments stably transfected, doxycycline-inducible PC6–3 cell lines were induced with doxycycline for 24 h and then treated with 10 μm lactacystin overnight. The cells were solubilized with nondenaturing lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, 0.02 m HEPES, 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with 200 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 230 μm leupeptin, and 5 μm pepstatin A. Cell lysates were precipitated with polyclonal rabbit anti-MJD or pre-immune antiserum (1:1000) (31Paulson H.L. Das S.S. Crino P.B. Perez M.K. Patel S.C. Gotsdiner D. Fischbeck K.H. Pittman R.N. Ann. Neurol. 1997; 41: 453-462Google Scholar), and the precipitates were immunoblotted with monoclonal mouse anti-ubiquitin (1:1000; Zymed Laboratories Inc., S. San Francisco, CA) or monoclonal mouse ataxin-3 antibody, 1H9 (1:2000; kindly provided by Y. Trottier). Protein Purification—Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged and histidine (His)-tagged constructs were transformed into BL21 competent cells. For His-tagged constructs and GST-tagged constructs single bacterial colonies were grown at 37 °C in LB solution containing ampicillin either overnight (His constructs) or for 4–5 h (GST constructs). When cultures had reached an A600 of 0.6–0.8, expression of the fusion protein was induced by adding 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Amersham Biosciences) and continuing growth for another 2 h. Cells were recovered by centrifugation and resuspended in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors (200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 230 μm leupeptin, and 5 μm pepstatin A), and the cells then lysed on ice using a sonicator. Samples were centrifuged for 5 min, and recombinant GST- or His-tagged fusion proteins were then purified from the supernatant with GST or His MicroSpin™ purification modules (Amersham Biosciences). Protein concentration was measured by the Bio-Rad protein assay. Before surface plasmon resonance studies, purified proteins were placed into Slide-A-Lyzer mini-dialyzer units (Pierce) and dialyzed in running buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% P20 surfactant) for 4 h. Ubiquitin and Poly-ubiquitin—Bovine ubiquitin was purchased from Sigma and used without further purification. K48-linked di- and tetraubiquitin were synthesized as described (32Chen Z. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21835-21842Google Scholar) and purified by cation-exchange and gel-filtration chromatographies (33Yao T. Cohen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36862-36868Google Scholar). Some tetra-ubiquitin chains were made by an alternative procedure and contained ubiquitin (K48C) at the distal end (34Piotrowski J. Beal R. Hoffman L. Wilkinson K.D. Cohen R.E. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23712-23721Google Scholar); in the experiments reported here these behaved indistinguishably from the fully wild-type tetraubiquitin chains. GST and His Pull-down Experiments—For GST or GST-tagged ataxin-3, purified protein (final concentration, 10 μm) was incubated in 40 μl of incubation buffer (50 mm NaHEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μm pepstatin A, and 230 μm leupeptin), 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads, and ub, ub2, or ub4 (final concentration, 5 μm). For His-tagged ataxin-3, purified protein (final concentration, 10 μm) was incubated in 40 μl of incubation buffer, with 20 μl of Ni2+-charged chelating Sepharose resin, and ub, ub2, or ub4 (final concentration, 5 μm). The mixture was rotated for 1 h at 4 °C, then the resin beads were centrifuged and washed 4 times with incubation buffer. Bound proteins were eluted in 20 μl of Laemmli sample buffer, boiled 5 min, and analyzed by Western blotting with monoclonal antiubiquitin (1:1000; Zymed Laboratories Inc.), monoclonal ataxin-3 antibody 1H9 (1:2500), or monoclonal anti-histidine (1:500; NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA) antibody. Biosensor Binding Experiments—Surface plasmon resonance measurements were performed using a BIAcore 3000 instrument (BIAcore, Piscataway, NJ). All experiments were done at 25 °C using a constant flow rate (10 μl/min) of running buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% P20 surfactant). The tested ligands were di-ubiquitin (ub2) and tetra-ubiquitin (ub4) (20 μg/ml for each), each of which was immobilized on CM5 sensor chips by the standard amine-coupling method recommended by the manufacturer. Various concentrations of purified, dialyzed analytes (i.e. His-tagged or GST-tagged ataxin-3 variants) were injected onto the ub2- and ub4-coupled surfaces as well as onto a negative control surface for 90 s. After this incubation analyte solutions were replaced with running buffer for 90 s. Regeneration of the sensor chip for subsequent injections was accomplished by 1 pulse of 10 mm glycine, pH 2.0. The association, dissociation, and regeneration phases were followed in real-time by monitoring changes in signal expressed in resonance units. All experiments were repeated at least two or three times. Signals generated in the control flow cell were subtracted from signals in the ataxin-3 flow cell. Sensorgrams were analyzed using BIAevaluation software, version 3.1. This program uses a global fitting analysis method to determine rate and affinity constants for each interaction. Ataxin-3 Contains UIMs and Binds Tetra-ubiquitin in Vitro—As shown in Fig. 1A, ataxin-3 contains a highly conserved, amino-terminal “josephin” domain, a predicted coiled-coil region, a polymorphic polyQ tract, and either of two C-terminal domains generated by alternative splicing (35Albrecht M. Hoffmann D. Evert B.O. Schmitt I. Wullner U. Lengauer T. Proteins. 2003; 50: 355-370Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of ataxin-3 (Fig. 1B) also contains three predicted UIMs (17Hofmann K. Falquet L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 347-350Google Scholar), two closely spaced just before the polyQ tract, and the third found only in the C terminus of the alternatively spliced form. All three predicted UIMs contain the critical conserved elements of this recently described motif, including a cluster of acidic amino acids, a conserved leucine, and a nearly invariant serine. Studies of other UIM-containing proteins indicate that the serine residue is often essential for ubiquitin binding (17Hofmann K. Falquet L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 347-350Google Scholar, 28Donaldson K.M. Li. W. Ching K.A. Batalov S. Tsai C.C. Joazeiro C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8892-8897Google Scholar). The presence of predicted UIMs in ataxin-3 led us to test whether ataxin-3 coprecipitates ubiquitinated proteins (Fig. 2). Stably transfected PC6–3 neural cell lines that express normal or pathogenic (i.e. expanded) ataxin-3 were incubated with or without the proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin, to induce a buildup of ubiquitinated proteins. Cells were then lysed in nondenaturing lysis buffer and immunoprecipitated with anti-ataxin-3 antibody. The resultant immunoprecipitates were then probed on immunoblots with an anti-ubiquitin antibody that recognizes mono-ubiquitin and poly-ubiquitin. As shown in Fig. 2, both normal and expanded ataxin-3 coprecipitated ubiquitinated proteins, which electrophoresed on gels as a high molecular weight smear. Reprobing blots with an antibody specific for poly-ubiquitin revealed a similar high molecular weight smear (not shown), indicating that normal and expanded ataxin-3 bind poly-ubiquitinated proteins either directly or indirectly. The presence of three predicted UIMs in ataxin-3 suggested to us that ataxin-3 co-precipitates ubiquitinated proteins by directly binding to ubiquitin conjugates. To test this we performed in vitro binding assays between recombinant ataxin-3 (Fig. 1C) and mono-ubiquitin (ub), K48-linked di-ubiquitin (ub2), or K48-linked tetra-ubiquitin (ub4). Bacterially expressed GST-ataxin-3 fusion proteins were purified (Fig. 3A), then used in glutathione pull-down experiments to assess ataxin-3 binding to ub, ub2, and ub4. For initial experiments we used the originally published ataxin-3 isoform (9Kawaguchi Y. Okamoto T. Taniwaki M. Aizawa M. Inoue M. Katayama H. Nakamura S. Nishimura M. Akiguchi I. Kimura J. Narumiya S. Kakizuka A. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 221-228Google Scholar) that contains only the first two UIMs, because this isoform has been most extensively studied. As shown in Fig. 3B, K48-linked ub4, but not ub or ub2, co-precipitated with GST-ataxin-3, indicating direct binding of ub4 to ataxin-3. Even with the shortest possible washes during co-precipitation (∼4 min), we were unable to detect ataxin-3 binding to ub or ub2 (not shown). Accordingly, all further precipitation assays focused on ub4 binding. In Vitro Analysis of the Role of PolyQ and UIMs in Ubiquitin Binding by Ataxin-3—Additional glutathione pull-down experiments with recombinant ataxin-3 lacking a polyQ domain (QHQ only) demonstrated that a polyQ tract was not necessary for ub4 binding by ataxin-3 (Fig. 3C). Moreover, ataxin-3 that contained expanded polyQ domains of 50 or 84 repeats still co-precipitated Ub4 (Fig. 3C), indicating that the pathogenic form of ataxin-3 retains the capacity to bind ubiquitin. The amount of ub4 coprecipitated by expanded ataxin-3, however, appeared to be reduced. This suggested that polyQ expansion leads to quantitative differences in ubiquitin binding, a possibility that is directly tested later in biosensor binding studies. To determine whether ubiquitin binding by ataxin-3 is mediated by the UIMs, we performed further binding studies with a His-tagged, alternatively spliced form of ataxin-3 containing a normal polyQ domain and all three UIMs. His-ataxin-3 proteins were purified from bacterial lysates by nickel affinity chromatography, then incubated with ub, ub2, or ub4 followed by a second round of affinity purification. As with GST-ataxin-3, His-ataxin-3 did not bind (i.e. co-precipitate) ub or ub2 (data not shown) but did bind ub4. Accordingly, only data obtained with ub4 are displayed in Fig. 4. Full-length ataxin-3 co-precipitated ub4 as did the C-terminal half of ataxin-3 containing all three UIMs but lacking the josephin domain. In contrast, the N-terminal half of ataxin-3, which contains the conserved josephin domain but no UIMs, did not co-precipitate ub4. Thus, ub4 binding localizes to the UIM-containing, C-terminal half of ataxin-3. To test the importance of UIMs in ubiquitin binding by ataxin-3, we performed similar studies with His-ataxin-3 in which the critical serine residue in each UIM was converted to alanine. This alanine-substituted ataxin-3 failed to bind ub4 (Fig. 4). Moreover, a C-terminal ataxin-3 fragment containing the same three alanine-substituted UIMs showed very little, if any, ub4 binding in this assay. Thus, one or more UIMs is essential for ubiquitin binding by ataxin-3. Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis of Ubiquitin-ataxin-3 Interactions—The preceding co-precipitation studies provided us with a qualitative assessment of ubiquitin binding by ataxin-3 but did not permit rigorous analyses of binding properties. Even relatively subtle changes in ubiquitin binding kinetics or affinity could have significant implications for disease pathogenesis in SCA3/MJD. Because expanded ataxin-3 appeared to bind relatively less ub4 in our glutathione pull-down assays (Fig. 3C), we next sought to determine whether expansion of polyQ does in fact alter ubiquitin binding by ataxin-3. We used the BIAcore 3000 instrument to monitor binding between (poly)ubiquitin and ataxin-3 proteins, manifested as changes in surface plasmon resonance. In our case, ubiquitin conjugates were immobilized on the CM5 sensor chip and recombinant ataxin-3 represented the analyte, which was injected across the surface of the chip at various concentrations (0–1600 nm). An analysis of changes in surface plasmon resonance that occur when ataxin-3 is injected across the chip provides a measure of the (poly)ubiquitin binding kinetics. Ub2 and ub4 were attached to different quadrants of the same sensor chip, permitting simultaneous acquisition of binding data for both ubiquitin conjugates (ub could not be attached successfully to the sensor chip). In our initial BIAcore studies ataxin-3 did not bind ub2 (data not shown), consistent with our earlier co-precipitation results showing that ataxin-3 does not bind ub or ub2 but only ub4. Thus, all further BIAcore studies focused on binding to ub4, although in all experiments we also simultaneously collected negative binding data with ub2. Ataxin-3 reproducibly showed high affinity binding to ub4 (Fig. 5). When ataxin-3 was washed off the chip the slow change in surface plasmon resonance indicated a relatively slow dissociation. The calculated equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) was 2.0 × 10-7m (Table I). The N terminus of ataxin-3 did not bind ub4, confirming that the domain responsible for binding poly-ubiquitin resides in the C-terminal half of ataxin-3. Ataxin-3 with alanine-substituted UIMs also showed no detectable binding across a broad concentration range. Thus, BIAcore analysis confirmed that one or more UIMs are essential for ubiquitin binding by ataxin-3.Table IKinetic parameters for binding of ataxin-3 variants to K48-linked tetra-ubiquitin ka indicates the association rate constant, kd indicates the dissociation rate constant, and KD indicates the equilibrium dissociation constant. The values correspond to the mean ± S.D. of two independent experiments.AnalytekakdKDm-1s-1 × 104s-1 × 10-2m × 10-7His-atx-3-Q22-WT1.92 ± 0.060.39 ± 0.032.02 ± 0.11His-atx-3-Q22C-WT7.74 ± 0.163.67 ± 1.244.78 ± 1.73GST-atx-3-QHQ1.80 ± 0.070.79 ± 0.044.40 ± 0.42GST-atx-3-Q283.91 ± 0.020.99 ± 0.012.57 ± 0.04GST-atx-3-Q641.69 ± 0.320.93 ± 0.085.55 ± 0.49 Open table in a new tab Because all three UIMs map to the C terminus of ataxin-3, we next tested whether the C terminus alone could recapitulate all aspects of ubiquitin binding by ataxin-3. As shown in Fig. 6 and Table I, the C terminus still bound ub4 with high affinity. The kinetics of binding, however, differed from that observed with full-length ataxin-3. The on and off rates for ub4 binding were much faster for the C terminus than for the full-length protein. The off rate in particular was more than 9-fold faster for the C terminus, and the on rate was ∼4-fold faster. The calculated KD for ubiquitin binding by the C terminus remained in the submicromolar range (Table I). Having established a quantitative ubiquitin binding assay, we then tested whether polyQ expansion alters binding properties. For these experiments, we used a GST fusion of the ataxin-3 splice variant that contains two UIMs, since this isoform has been used most extensively in studies of polyQ protein aggregation (15Chai Y. Wu L. Griffin J.D. Paulson H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44889-44897Google Scholar, 21Chai Y. Koppenhafer S. Shoesmith S. Perez M. Paulson H. Hum. Mol.

Ataxin-3 containing either no polyQ tract (QHQ), a normal tract (Q28), or a modestly expanded tract (Q64) were all tested for ub4 binding. An expanded repeat length of 64 glutamine residues is well within the disease repeat range (55–84), yet not so large as to confound our ability to express and purify recombinant protein. As shown in Fig. 7 all three ataxin-3 proteins bound to ub4 with nearly identical binding curves. For all three the calculated binding kinetics and affinities were similar (Table I). The fact that GST-ataxin-3 with two UIMs had similar binding properties to His-ataxin-3 with three UIMs suggests that both major ataxin-3 splice isoforms bind poly-ubiquitin with similar affinity. The data also suggest that the third UIM is dispensable for ubiquitin binding by ataxin-3, consistent with recently published results by Donaldson et al. (28Donaldson K.M. Li. W. Ching K.A. Batalov S. Tsai C.C. Joazeiro C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8892-8897Google Scholar). In this study we have established that the SCA3/MJD protein ataxin-3 is a poly-ubiquitin binding protein. Our results, which confirm and extend recent studies published by others (28Donaldson K.M. Li. W. Ching K.A. Batalov S. Tsai C.C. Joazeiro C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8892-8897Google Scholar, 29Doss-Pepe E.W. Stenroos E.S. Johnson W.G. Madura K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6469-6483Google Scholar), define an intrinsic property of this disease protein that should lead to a better understanding of its primary cellular functions. Moreover, because the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway has already been implicated in polyQ disease pathogenesis (7Berke S.J. Paulson H.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 253-261Google Scholar), the findings described here raise the possibility of important links between normal ataxin-3 biology and mechanisms of neurodegeneration in SCA3/MJD and other polyQ diseases. Many UIM-containing proteins participate in nonproteasomal ubiquitin pathways, often by interacting with mono-ubiquitinated substrates. In the assays we employed, however, ataxin-3 showed no capacity to bind mono-ubiquitin or diubiquitin. In solution, UIM peptides bind mono-ubiquitin with relatively low affinity, with dissociation constants approaching the millimolar range (38Fisher R.D. Wang B. Alam S.L. Higginson D.S. Robinson H. Sundquist W.I. Hill C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28976-28984Google Scholar). It is, therefore, possible that low affinity binding to mono- or di-ubiquitin would have been missed in our pull-down assays, as they require extensive washes of the resin-bound complexes. The absence of real-time binding to Ub2 in our surface plasmon resonance studies argues against this, although the relatively low concentrations of ataxin-3 used in these studies (1.6 μm being the highest) do not allow us to exclude this possibility entirely. Based on our data, we favor the view that ataxin-3 exclusively binds poly-ubiquitinated substrates. UIMs 1 and 2 of ataxin-3 flank one another in the protein, reminiscent of many other proteins with two UIMs (e.g. several epsins). In such proteins the UIMs may cooperate to present the surface that mediates ubiquitin binding. Further surface plasmon resonance analyses with ataxin-3 engineered to contain a single functional UIM should provide insight into the molecular determinants that underlie the specificity for polyubiquitin. Another factor that may regulate ubiquitin binding is intermolecular interaction either between ataxin-3 monomers or between ataxin-3 and other cellular proteins. In immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid studies ataxin-3 interacts with itself and with other proteins. 2Y. Chai, N. Bonini, and H. Paulson, unpublished observations. Moreover, ataxin-3 sediments broadly through sucrose density gradients, presumably partly within large protein complexes of unknown composition (15Chai Y. Wu L. Griffin J.D. Paulson H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44889-44897Google Scholar). If ataxin-3 forms homodimers in cells, the topography of the UIMs presented by such a complex could modulate ubiquitin binding specificity. Similarly, in larger protein complexes ataxin-3-interacting proteins might alter the accessibility of the UIMs, further modulating ubiquitin binding by ataxin-3. Clearly, a full understanding of ataxin-3 interactions with ubiquitin requires more information about the quaternary structures adopted by ataxin-3 in cells. All our in vitro binding studies were performed with K48-linked poly-ubiquitin, the most common ubiquitin-ubiquitin linkage in cells. A critical issue will be to determine which other forms of poly-ubiquitin, if any, can bind ataxin-3 and, equally important, what kinds of ubiquitin-ataxin-3 interactions actually take place in the cellular milieu. The fact that only ub4 binds to ataxin-3 in vitro does not rule out the possibility of physiologically significant interactions with shorter poly-ubiquitin chains or even mono-ubiquitinated proteins in living cells. Further studies employing techniques to assess ataxin-3/ubiquitin interactions in intact cells will be needed to address this issue. The delivery of ubiquitinated substrates to proteasomes typically requires a minimum chain length of four ubiquitin molecules linked via K48 (39Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Google Scholar). The tight association of ataxin-3 with K48-linked poly-ubiquitin suggests that it participates in some manner in the ubiquitin- and proteasome-dependent degradation pathway. As we were writing this study, Madura and co-workers (29Doss-Pepe E.W. Stenroos E.S. Johnson W.G. Madura K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6469-6483Google Scholar) reported that ataxin-3 binds to the proteasome directly, implying that ataxin-3 modulates ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation through its ubiquitin binding properties. Although an interpretation of this result consistent with the model of Madura and co-workers is that excess ataxin-3 inhibits the delivery of ubiquitinated substrates to the proteasome, we have not detected proteasome impairment in ataxin-3-overexpressing cells that also express a reporter protein for proteasomal degradation. 3H. Paulson and S. S. Berke, unpublished observations. Based on a bioinformatics approach, Hofmann and co-workers (40Scheel H. Tomiuk S. Hofmann K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 2845-2852Google Scholar) recently suggested another possible ubiquitin-linked function for ataxin-3; that the highly conserved josephin domain of ataxin-3 possesses the predicted catalytic triad of amino acids found in ubiquitin-specific proteases. Indeed, since the completion of the current study, experimental evidence supporting this prediction has been reported (41Burnett B. Li F. Pittman R.N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 3195-3205Google Scholar). Studies in cells expressing mutated versions of ataxin-3 (i.e. lacking either functional UIMs or the catalytic triad) will be needed to define the precise role or roles ataxin-3 plays in normal ubiquitin pathways. What are the physiological consequences of ubiquitin binding by ataxin-3? Its ability to bind poly-ubiquitin suggests a mechanism by which ataxin-3 is recruited to ubiquitin-positive inclusions. More than perhaps all other polyglutamine proteins, ataxin-3 is readily recruited to polyglutamine inclusions in various model systems and is sequestered in Marinesco bodies, the ubiquitin-rich neuronal inclusions found in normal aged brain (23Fujigasaki H. Uchihara T. Koyano S. Iwabuchi K. Yagishita S. Makifuchi T. Nakamura A. Ishida K. Toru S. Hirai S. Ishikawa K. Tanabe T. Mizusawa H. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 165: 248-256Google Scholar). Donaldson et al. (28Donaldson K.M. Li. W. Ching K.A. Batalov S. Tsai C.C. Joazeiro C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8892-8897Google Scholar) recently showed that ataxin-3 lacking functional UIMs is no longer efficiently recruited to inclusions in transfected cells, supporting the view that ubiquitin binding facilitates ataxin-3 recruitment to inclusions. This then begs the question, What function does ataxin-3 serve in inclusions? As a poly-ubiquitin-binding protein, does ataxin-3 aid the cell in handling aggregated protein within inclusions? And does the ubiquitin binding property of ataxin-3 modulate its own tendency to form insoluble inclusions? Answering these questions will require further studies, including analyzing polyQ protein aggregation in cells where ataxin-3 expression is suppressed and expressing UIM-mutated forms of ataxin-3 in cellular and animal models to assess their effect on polyglutamine aggregation and toxicity. An issue relevant to SCA3/MJD pathogenesis is whether polyQ expansion in ataxin-3 alters ubiquitin binding in intact cells. Although our in vitro studies did not reveal a major polyQ length-dependent change in ubiquitin binding, the behavior of the purified proteins may differ substantially from that of the same proteins in a living cell. Expanded polyQ, for example, could alter ataxin-3 interactions with other proteins, which in turn would affect its ability to bind poly-ubiquitin. Even subtle changes might over the decades-long course of disease contribute to pathogenesis. Finally, our studies highlight the importance of protein context in polyQ disease. It is increasingly clear that the details of pathogenesis in any polyQ disorder are partly determined by the full sequence of the disease protein and its biological functions (8La Spada A.R. Taylor J.P. Neuron. 2003; 38: 681-684Google Scholar). The fact that full-length ataxin-3 and the C-terminal fragment of ataxin-3 differ markedly in ubiquitin binding kinetics suggests that N-terminal regions of the protein influence ubiquitin binding. Indeed, the N-terminal josephin domain of ataxin-3 is the most highly conserved part of the protein and is itself linked to ubiquitin pathways. This domain mediates ataxin-3 interactions with HHR23A/B (42Wang G. Sawai N. Kotliarova S. Kanazawa I. Nukina N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1795-1803Google Scholar), the human homologs of Rad23, a yeast protein that may negatively regulate ubiquitination (43Ortolan T.G. Tongaonkar P. Lambertson D. Chen L. Schauber C. Madura K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 601-608Google Scholar, 44Raasi S. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8951-8959Google Scholar), and the josephin domain may form a ubiquitin-specific protease (40Scheel H. Tomiuk S. Hofmann K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 2845-2852Google Scholar, 41Burnett B. Li F. Pittman R.N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 3195-3205Google Scholar). The altered ubiquitin binding kinetics we observed could reflect differences in the oligomeric state of ataxin-3, as discussed above. Alternatively, the N terminus of ataxin-3 may constrain the allowable structures adopted by UIMs in ataxin-3. Further binding analyses of mutant forms of ataxin-3 coupled with experiments to assess the sizes of protein complexes should provide insight into this issue. We thank K. Donaldson and C. Joazeiro for providing plasmids and advice in protein purification. We also thank B. Morrison for assistance and S. Raasi and C. Pickart for advice with the BIAcore studies, T.

Members of this gene family mediate interferon induction of gene transcription and the response to a large number of growth factors and hormones. Extracellular ligand binding to transmembrane receptors causes the intracellular activation of associated tyrosine kinases, phosphorylation of Stat molecules, dimerization, and translocation to the nucleus. Prolactin-induced phosphorylation of Stat5 is a key event in the development and differentiation of mammary epithelial cells. In addition to the crucial phosphorylation at tyrosine 694, we have identified an O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) as another secondary modification essential for the transcriptional induction by Stat5. This modification was only found on nuclear Stat5 after cytokine activation. Similar observations were made with Stat1, Stat3, and Stat6. Glycosylation of Stat5, however, does not seem to be a prerequisite for nuclear translocation. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed a glycosylated peptide in the N-terminal region of Stat5. Replacement of threonine 92 by an alanine residue (Stat5a-T92A) strongly reduced the prolactin induction of Stat5a glycosylation and abolished transactivation of a target gene promoter. Only the glycosylated form of Stat5 was able to bind the coactivator of transcription CBP, an essential interaction for Stat5-mediated gene transcription.

Darnell Jr., J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 651-662Google Scholar). After binding of these ligands to their cell surface receptors Stat proteins are activated by tyrosine phosphorylation. Cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, Janus kinases (Jak), and members of the Src kinase family, mediate Stat activation (2Reddy E.P. Korapati A. Chaturvedi P. Rane S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2532-2547Google Scholar). Tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat monomers can form dimers through reciprocal phosphotyrosine SH2 interactions; dimers translocate to the nucleus, bind to specific DNA-promoter elements, and induce target gene transcription (3Bromberg J. Darnell J.E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2468-2473Google Scholar). Seven Stat family members, Stat1, Stat2, Stat3, Stat4, Stat5a, Stat5b, and Stat6 have been found in mammalian cells. They have diverse biological functions including roles in cell differentiation, development, proliferation, apoptosis, and inflammation (4Bromberg J. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 161-169Google Scholar, 5Dumon S. Santos S.C. Debierre-Grockiego F. Gouilleux-Gruart V. Cocault L. Boucheron C. Mollat P. Gisselbrecht S. Gouilleux F.

Constitutively activated Stat proteins have been observed in tumor cells, where they are able to contribute to the transformed phenotype (7Bowman T. Garcia R. Turkson J. Jove R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2474-2488Google Scholar).The regulation of Stat activity is not restricted to tyrosine phosphorylation; serine phosphorylation has also been found to be important (8Darnell J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Google Scholar). The C-terminal regions of Stat1, Stat3, Stat4, and Stat5 contain phosphorylated serine residues required for full transcriptional activation (9Beuvink I. Hess D. Flotow H. Hofsteenge J. Groner B. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10247-10255Google Scholar). Members of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) family, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK have been implicated in the serine phosphorylation of Stat1, Stat3, and Stat5. Beuvink et al. (9Beuvink I. Hess D. Flotow H. Hofsteenge J. Groner B. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10247-10255Google Scholar) showed that serine 779 is a major phosphorylation site of Stat5a; the same is true for serine 725 (10Decker T. Kovarik P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2628-2637Google Scholar).N-Acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is a sugar residue that is used as a frequent post-translational modification of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. One molecule of GlcNAc is linked as a single monosaccharide to the hydroxyl group of serines or threonines and is not further elongated. Like phosphorylation, modification by O-GlcNAc is highly dynamic (11Comer F.I. Hart G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 161-171Google Scholar, 12Zachara N.E. Hart G.W. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 431-438Google Scholar) and can give rise to functionally distinct subsets of a protein. Proteins modified by O-GlcNAc can also be modified by phosphorylation (13Comer F.I. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29179-29182Google Scholar). Over 50 proteins with O-GlcNAc modifications have been identified including RNA polymerase II, RNA polymerase II-associated transcription factors, nuclear pore proteins, the tumor suppressor protein p53, and c-Myc (14Comer F.I. Hart G.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7845-7852Google Scholar, 15Miller M.W. Caracciolo M.R. Berlin W.K. Hanover J.A. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 51-60Google Scholar, 16Shaw P. Freeman J. Bovey R.

Common sequence motifs, at which O-GlcNAc modifications occur in these diverse proteins, have not been identified (18Hart G.W. Haltiwanger R.S. Holt G.D. Kelly W.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 841-874Google Scholar), and O-GlcNAc modification of tyrosine residues has not been observed.The attributes of O-GlcNAc modification are distinct from those of complex carbohydrates (19Wells L. Vosseller K. Hart G.W. Science. 2001; 291: 2376-2378Google Scholar). O-GlcNAc modification of proteins is known to change in response to T cell activation, insulin signaling, glucose metabolism, and cell cycle progression (20Liu K. Paterson A.J. Chin E. Kudlow J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2820-2825Google Scholar, 21Konrad R.J. Mikolaenko I. Tolar J.F. Liu K. Kudlow J.E. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 31-41Google Scholar, 22Mauvais-Jarvis F. Ueki K.

Plyte S. Potter J. Yang Y. Tsang E. Ruland J. Iscove N.N. Dennis J.W. Mak T.W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5092-5104Google Scholar); characteristics consistent with a function in signal transduction. O-GlcNAc modification is a dynamic process and inducible enzymes responsible for the attachment (O-GlcNAc transferase, OGT) and for the removal (O-GlcNAcase) of this sugar moiety have been found in the nucleus and the cytoplasm of cells. The genes encoding these enzymatic activities have been cloned and characterized (24Lubas W.A. Hanover J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10983-10988Google Scholar, 25Gao Y. Wells L. Comer F.I. Parker G.J. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9838-9845Google Scholar). The N terminus of OGT contains multiple tetratricopeptide repeats that mediate protein-protein interactions, which are critical for substrate recognition (24Lubas W.A. Hanover J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10983-10988Google Scholar, 26Kreppel L.K. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32015-32022Google Scholar, 27Shafi R. Iyer S.P. Ellies L.G. O'Donnell N. Marek K.W. Chui D. Hart G.W. Marth J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5735-5739Google Scholar). Inactivation of the OGT gene in mouse cells has shown that OGT is required for embryonic stem cell viability and mouse ontogeny (27Shafi R. Iyer S.P. Ellies L.G. O'Donnell N. Marek K.W. Chui D. Hart G.W. Marth J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5735-5739Google Scholar). Deglycosylation is also important, and the prevention of the removal of O-GlcNAc from proteins has been shown to be toxic to cells. This can be achieved by microinjection or overexpression of the galactosyltransferase enzyme causing the capping of the O-GlcNAc sugar residues, which then cannot be removed by the O-GlcNAcase (28Fang B. Miller M.W. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 263: 243-253Google Scholar). O-GlcNAcase activity can also be potently inhibited by O-(2-acetaminido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene)amino-N-phenylcarbamamate (PUGNAc). PUGNAc is an O-GlcNAc analogue that prevents cycling of O-GlcNAc on proteins without significantly altering N-linked glycosylation or UDP-GlcNAc levels (29Haltiwanger R.S. Grove K. Philipsberg G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3611-3617Google Scholar). PUGNAc inhibition rapidly increases O-GlcNAc levels in cells and testifies to the dynamic nature of this modification. Altered O-linked GlcNAc metabolism may play a role in human diseases including neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes mellitus, and cancer (12Zachara N.E. Hart G.W. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 431-438Google Scholar, 30Hanover J.A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1865-1876Google Scholar).In the present study we show that the transcription factor Stat5a is modified by O-GlcNAc. The glycosylated form of Stat5 was mainly found in the nucleus of hormone-induced cells. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed an O-GlcNAc-modified peptide from the N-terminal region of Stat5a comprising threonine 92. Mutation of threonine 92 to an alanine (Stat5a-T92A) resulted in the loss of Stat5 glycosylation and failure in the transcriptional induction of a reporter gene construct. This loss of function is most likely due to the inability of Stat5a-T92A to interact with the coactivator of transcription CBP. Tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of Stat5a-T92A and the ability to specifically interact with its DNA response element were not impaired.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture, Transient Transfections, and Luciferase Assays—Sf9 cells were grown in ExCell400 medium without fetal calf serum. HC11 mammary epithelial cells were grown and treated with lactogenic hormones as described previously (31Wartmann M. Cella N. Hofer P. Groner B. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31863-31868Google Scholar). COS7, HeLa, and 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. Transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate method. 2 μg of plasmid-DNA of pMX-mStat5a, pcDNA3.1-mStat5a-T92A, pcDNA-PrlR, pCMVCBP or GR were used in the transfection experiments. The transfected genes were expressed for 48 h before the cells were harvested. To monitor the prolactin-dependent transcriptional activation and transfection efficiency, the β-casein luciferase reporter construct (2 μg) was cotransfected with an expression vector encoding the β-galactosidase gene (0.5 μg) driven by the CMV promoter. DNA was adjusted to 20 μg with sonicated salmon sperm DNA (Stratagene). COS7 cells were harvested 1 day after transfection; the cells were treated with 5 μg/ml ovine prolactin for 16 h before harvesting. Luciferase activity was determined in triplicate samples using the luciferase assay system as described previously (32Stoecklin E. Wissler M. Moriggl R. Groner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6708-6716Google Scholar). Total light emission was measured during the first 30 s of the reaction using a luminometer (Berthold Microlumat).Preparation of Whole Cell Extracts, Cytoplasmic, and Nuclear Fractions—Cells were grown on 100-mm Petri dishes, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped off the dish, and resuspended in 100 μlof X-400 lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, 20% glycerol, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm pefabloc, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin. After three cycles of freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing, extracts were centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge. Supernatants were collected and stored at -70 °C. For the preparation of cytoplasmic and nuclear cell extracts, stimulated cells were quickly chilled in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were collected and solubilized in buffer A containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm NaO3VO4, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 μg each of aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin per ml. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 2 min. The supernatants were recovered and considered as cytoplasmic extracts. The pellets were extracted with buffer B containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 350 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm NaO3VO4, 20% glycerol, 1 μg each of aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin per ml, pH 7.9 with 0.5 ml of buffer B for 5 × 107 cells. After three cycles of freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing, extracts were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatants were quickly frozen and stored at -70 °C and considered as nuclear extracts.Sf9 Cell Infection, Cell Lysis, and Protein Extraction—Sf9 cells were grown in spinner flask suspension culture and split 1:4 the day before baculovirus infection. Baculoviruses encoding for mouse Stat5a and Jak2 were used at a multiplicity of infection of 10 plaque-forming units/cell for each virus. 60 h post-infection, the cells were harvested, washed two times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed for 15 min on ice in a buffer containing 10% glycerol, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.2% Nonident P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm NaO3VO4, 2 mm DTT, 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzesulfonyl fluoride, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, and aprotinin. The cells were centrifuged at 4,000 rpm at 4 °C, and supernatants were quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70 °C. Stat5 proteins were purified on a Stat5a immunoaffinity column, eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5. pH neutralization after elution was carried out with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0 as described previously (32Stoecklin E. Wissler M. Moriggl R. Groner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6708-6716Google Scholar). Eluted protein extracts were stored at -70 °C.Galactosyltransferase Assay—In the galactosyltransferase assay, radioactively labeled UDP-galactose was transferred to a terminal GlcNAc sugar residues. The reaction was followed by PNGase F treatment in which N-linked sugars were removed. The remaining labeled proteins contained O-linked sugar residues.Stat5 protein was labeled with UDP-[6-3H]galactose (38.5 Ci/mmol) with autogalactosylated bovine milk galactosyltransferase (GalTase) as described previously (33Roquemore E.P. Chou T.Y. Hart G.W. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 443-460Google Scholar). Ovalbumin (chicken egg white, fraction V, Sigma) served as a positive control in the labeling reaction. Labeled proteins were treated with PNGase F enzyme (Sigma).Avidin-Biotin Complex-DNA binding (ABCD) Assay—Stat5 proteins were analyzed for their ability to specifically interact with the Stat5 DNA response element. DNA binding assays were carried out with the biotinylated Stat5 binding site present in the bovine β-casein promoter. Recombinant non-glycosylated, glycosylated Stat5a, or wild-type mStat5a or mStat5a-T92A expressed in transfected cells were incubated with the biotinylated DNA oligonucleotide for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with streptavidin-coupled beads for 30 min at 4 °C and constant agitation. Beads were pelleted and washed three times with washing buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm NaO3VO4,1mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. Bound Stat5 was eluted under denaturing conditions, separated by SDS-PAGE (7.5%) and visualized by Western blotting with polyclonal Stat5a antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.).Immunoaffinity Purification, Tryptic Digestion and Mass Spectrometry of Recombinant Stat5a—Purified recombinant Stat5a was modified with galactosyltransferase and radioactively-labeled UDP-galactose. Peptides were generated by proteolysis with trypsin and purified by RP-HPLC. RP-HPLC fractions were counted in a scintillation counter, and only radioactive fractions were used for mass spectrometry. MALDI-TOF mass spectra were acquired in the positive ionization mode using Hewlett-Packard G2025 mass spectrometer. Peptide samples were prepared for MALDI-TOF MS by diluting the sample solution with CHCA matrix solution (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto) to a final concentration of 0.1–1.0 pmol/μl. Mass spectra were calibrated using a mixture of standard peptides (34Greis K.D. Hayes B.K. Comer F.I. Kirk M. Barnes S. Lowary T.L. Hart G.W. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 234: 38-49Google Scholar).PUGNAc and Glc/GlcN Treatment of HC11 Cells and Immune Fluorescence Microscopy—PUGNAc treatments were performed by replacing the media on subconfluent plates (80%) with fresh complete RPMI 1640 containing PUGNAc (40 μm), or glucose (5 mm) and glucosamine (7 mm). Stock solutions of PUGNAc were made in MilliQ water and sterilized prior to use. 16 h post-treatment cells were washed 2× with PBS and lysed or fixed for immunofluorescence experiments.For immunofluorescence experiments cells were fixed in 95% methanol for 10–15 min. Fixed cells were washed two times for 10 min with PBS, then for 20 min with PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20, followed by a wash step for 5 min with PBS. Coverslips were blocked for 30 min at room temperature with cold jellyfish gelatin. Cells were incubated with a 1:400 dilution of polyclonal anti-Stat5a antibody (primary antibody) overnight at 4 °C, followed by three wash steps for 10 min at room temperature with PBS. Secondary antibody incubation with anti-rabbit rhodamine (1:400) was performed for 2 h at room temperature, followed by three wash steps for 10 min at room temperature with PBS. Cell nuclei were visualized using DAPI staining.Immunoprecipitation, Lectin Affinity Chromatography, and Western Blot Analysis—Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method. Stat5a was immunoprecipitated from 0.2 to 0.5 mg protein of whole cell extract with a specific antiserum (rabbit anti-mouse Stat5a, Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and captured by incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads. CBP protein or glucocorticoid receptor was immunoprecipitated from 0.5 to 1.0 mg of protein of whole cell extracts with anti-CBP antibody or anti-GR antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitation of O-GlcNAc-modified proteins was performed with a specific monoclonal O-GlcNAc antibody using Protein G-Sepharose (CNB). Lectin affinity chromatography was carried out with wheat germ agglutinin-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) using 2.0–4.0 mg of whole cell protein extract. Lectin beads were incubated with protein extracts for 1 h at room temperature. Glycosylated proteins were eluted off the bead with 1 m GlcNAc for 10 min at room temperature. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5%), and Western blot analyses were performed as described previously using polydextran membranes (Schleicher und Schuell). Membranes were incubated with a monoclonal phosphotyrosine-specific Stat5 antibody (1:5000, Zymed Laboratories Inc.), Stat5a antiserum (1:5000, Zymed Laboratories Inc.), or O-GlcNAc antiserum (1:1000, NanoTools).Coimmunoaffinity Chromatography Experiments—COS7 or 293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding Stat5a-T92A and the PRL receptor, CBP, or GR. Two days after transfection, the cells were treated with 5 μg/ml ovine PRL for 30 min before harvesting. Whole cell extracts were prepared as described above. Protein extracts from cells expressing transfected CBP or GR (293T cells) were incubated together with protein fractions containing glycosylated or nonglycosylated Stat5 from Sf9 cells, or Stat5a-T92A with 2 μg of CBP-specific antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 C and constant agitation. Protein A-Sepharose-coupled beads (Pierce) were added for 1 h. The beads were pelleted and washed three times with incubation buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm NaVO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT). The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE (7.5%), and the Western blots were developed with antiserum specific against the C terminus of Stat5a (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and reprobed for equal protein loading with CBP or GR antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).RESULTSStat5a Is Modified with O-Linked N-Acetylglucosamine Residues—Post-translational modifications serve as on-off switches or modulators of protein activity. Many cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins such as transcription factors, RNA polymerase II, oncoproteins, nuclear pore proteins, viral proteins, and tumor repressor proteins have been found to be modified by O-GlcNAc at serine and threonine residues (11Comer F.I. Hart G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 161-171Google Scholar). We have investigated the modification of Stat5a by O-GlcNAc in HC11 mouse mammary epithelial cells. These cells are responsive to lactogenic hormone induction and express Stat proteins endogenously (35Ball R.K. Friis R.R. Schoenenberger C.A. Doppler W. Groner B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2089-2095Google Scholar). Treatment of HC11 cells with prolactin, insulin, and dexamethasone (DIP) causes the activation of Stat5 and milk protein expression.To detect O-GlcNAc modification of Stat5 enzymatic reactions were used. Whole cell extracts of HC11 cells were immunoprecipitated with an antibody directed against the C terminus of Stat5a. Immunopurified Stat5a was treated with bovine galactosyltransferase in the presence of UDP-[6-3H]galactose. In this reaction the radioactive sugar moiety is transferred to terminal N-acetylglucosamines (GlcNAc), irrespective of their O- or N-linkage. Subsequent treatment with the endoglycosidase PNGase F removes the N-linked but not the O-linked moieties. The radiolabeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography upon gel electrophoresis. Stat5a was strongly labeled with [6-3H]galactose in the galactosyltransferase reaction (Fig. 1A, lane 5), and only a part of the label could be removed by PNGase F treatment (Fig. 1A, lane 6). The protein band with the molecular weight of about 50 kDa in Fig. 1, lane 5 corresponds to the heavy chain of the IgG antibody used in the Stat5a immunoprecipitation reaction. Because N-acetylglucosamine sugar residues are not charged and Stat5 is most likely modified with only one or two sugar residues, no change in the electrophoretic mobility of Stat5 is observed after PNGaseF treatment.We conclude that Stat5a contains O-linked GlcNAc. Ovalbumin served as a positive control for the labeling reaction and showed a complete removal of N-linked sugars in the PNGase F reaction (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2). The protein band with the molecular weight of about 50 kDa in Fig. 1, lane 5 corresponds to the heavy chain of the IgG antibody used in the Stat5a immunoprecipitation reactionActivation of Stat5a Induces Its Modification with GlcNAc Residues—O-GlcNAc transferase is expressed ubiquitously and has been found in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus of mammalian cells. Its TPR domain is thought to mediate protein-protein interactions (36Kreppel L.K. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9308-9315Google Scholar) and the activity of the enzyme can be directly regulated by the concentration of UDP-GlcNAc (24Lubas W.A. Hanover J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10983-10988Google Scholar). We employed wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) lectin affinity chromatography assays to study the glycosylation status of endogenous Stat5 in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus of HC11 mammary epithelial cells grown in the absence and presence of lactogenic hormones (Fig. 1B). WGA lectin has a specific affinity for terminal GlcNAc residues and allows the separation of Stat5a into glycosylated and non-glycosylated fractions (37Yamamoto K. Tsuji T. Matsumoto I. Osawa T. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 5894-5899Google Scholar).Stat5a was visualized in the individual fractions by gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. WGA-bound, glycosylated Stat5a was preferentially found in the nuclear fraction of HC11 cells (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4) and increased after lactogenic hormone stimulation of the cells (lane 4). The lower molecular weight proteins observed may represent proteolytic fragments. O-GlcNAc competition in the WGA binding reaction confirmed the specificity of the interaction. No Stat5 was retained when 200 mm GlcNAc was added (data not shown). The translocation of total Stat5 to the nucleus upon hormone treatment of the cells is apparent in Fig. 1B, lanes 5–8. Only 10% of the protein introduced in the WGA affinity chromatography assays (lanes 1–4) have been used in these Western blot experiments. Stat5a was found glycosylated mainly in the nuclear fraction after hormone stimulation indicating that glycosylation of Stat5a might be a hormonally regulated process or occur as a function of its nuclear translocation.Stat1, Stat3, and Stat6 Are Also Modified by O-GlcNAc— Seven Stat family members have been identified in mammals, Stat1, Stat2, Stat3, Stat4, Stat5a, Stat5b, and Stat6 (38Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Google Scholar). We performed lectin affinity chromatography experiments to investigate if O-GlcNAc glycosylation is a feature restricted to Stat5 or if other members of the Stat family also exhibit this modification. Stat1, Stat3, Stat5b, and Stat6 were activated in HC11 cells by treatment with IFN-γ, EGF, prolactin or IL-4, respectively. Whole cell protein extracts were prepared and subjected to WGA affinity chromatography. WGA-bound and immunoprecipitable Stat molecules were detected by Western blotting (Fig. 1C). O-GlcNAc modification of Stat1, Stat3, Stat5, and Stat6 was found after cytokine treatment.Glycosylated Stat5 Fractions Are Tyrosine- and Serine-phosphorylated and Are Able to Bind DNA—To explore possible effects of Stat5 glycosylation on DNA binding and phosphorylation, we used purified Stat5a obtained from insect cells infected with recombinant baculoviruses. We have previously shown that tyrosine phosphorylated, activated Stat5a can be obtained from extracts of Sf9 cells simultaneously infected with baculoviruses encoding Stat5 and Jak2 (39Beisenherz-Huss C. Mundt M. Herrala A. Vihko P. Schubert A. Groner B. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 183: 101-112Google Scholar). Sf9 cells properly carry out post-translational modifications of recombinant proteins such as the tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5 or the O-GlcNAcylation of human cytomegalovirus basic protein 1 and keratins 8, 13, and 18 (40Greis K.D. Gibson W. Hart G.W. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 8339-8349Google Scholar).We investigated whether the glycosylation of Stat5 is compatible with phosphorylation of the molecule. For this purpose we prepared glycosylated and non-glycosylated fractions of Stat5a by WGA affinity chromatography. The WGA-bound fraction was eluted under native conditions with 1 m GlcNAc and considered as the glycosylated fraction. The flow-through contained non-glycosylated Stat5. Stat5 was immunoprecipitated from these fractions. Upon electrophoresis and blotting the filters were probed with antisera specific for tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat5, antisera specific for Stat5 phosphorylated at serine 779 or antisera specific for O-GlcNAc (Fig. 2). We observed that glycosylated and non-glycosylated Stat5a isoforms were recognized by phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine 779-specific antibodies (Fig. 2, A and B). The specificity of the antibody directed against phosphoserine 779 was established by Beuvink et al. (9Beuvink I. Hess D. Flotow H. Hofsteenge J. Groner B. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10247-10255Google Scho"
https://openalex.org/W2016259832,"The type V TGF-beta receptor (TbetaR-V)/IGFBP-3 receptor mediates the IGF-independent growth inhibition induced by IGFBP-3. It also mediates the growth inhibitory response to TGF-beta1 in concert with other TGF-beta receptor types, and its loss may contribute to the malignant phenotype of human carcinoma cells. Here we demonstrate that TbetaR-V is identical to LRP-1/alpha2M receptor as shown by MALDI-TOF analysis of tryptic peptides of TbetaR-V purified from bovine liver. In addition, 125I-IGFBP-3 affinity-labeled TbetaR-V in Mv1Lu cells is immunoprecipitated by antibodies to LRP-1 and TbetaR-V. RAP, an LRP-1 antagonist, inhibits binding of 125I-TGF-beta1 and 125I-IGFBP-3 to TbetaR-V and diminishes IGFBP-3-induced growth inhibition in Mv1Lu cells. Absent or low levels of LRP-1, as with TbetaR-V, have been linked to the malignant phenotype of carcinoma cells. Mutagenized Mv1Lu cells selected for reduced expression of LRP-1 have an attenuated growth inhibitory response to TGF-beta1 and IGFBP-3. LRP-1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts lack a growth inhibitory response to TGF-beta1 and IGFBP-3. On the other hand, stable transfection of H1299 human lung carcinoma cells with LRP-1 cDNA restores the growth inhibitory response. These results suggest that the LRP-1/TbetaR-V/IGFBP-3 receptor is required for the growth inhibitory response to IGFBP-3 and TGF-beta1."
https://openalex.org/W1980184756,"Extracellular deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregates in the brain represents one of the histopathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aβ peptides are generated from proteolysis of the amyloid precursor proteins (APPs) by β- and γ-secretases. β-Secretase (BACE1) is a type I integral membrane glycoprotein that can cleave APP first to generate C-terminal 99- or 89-amino acid membrane-bound fragments containing the N terminus of Aβ peptides (βCTF). As BACE1 cleavage is an essential step for Aβ generation, it is proposed as a key therapeutic target for treating AD. In this study, we show that small interfering RNA (siRNA) specifically targeted to BACE1 can suppress BACE1 (but not BACE2) protein expression in different cell systems. Furthermore, BACE1 siRNA reduced APP βCTF and Aβ production in primary cortical neurons derived from both wild-type and transgenic mice harboring the Swedish APP mutant. The subcellular distribution of APP and presenilin-1 did not appear to differ in BACE1 suppressed cells. Importantly, pretreating neurons with BACE1 siRNA reduced the neurotoxicity induced by H2O2 oxidative stress. Our results indicate that BACE1 siRNA specifically impacts on β-cleavage of APP and may be a potential therapeutic approach for treating AD.

Despite an intensive search for therapeutic intervention, no drug has proven effective in combating this devastating neurodegenerative disease. The cause of AD is virtually unknown, with age being one of the only clearly defined major risk factors. The pathological hallmarks of AD include severe brain atrophy, neuronal loss, neurofibrillary tangles, and senile plaques composed of aggregated amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides (1.Whitehouse P.J. Struble R.G. Hedreen J.C. Clark A.W. Price D.L. CRC Crit. Rev. Clin. Neurobiol. 1985; 1: 319-339PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, all known mutations that are associated with early onset AD enhance Aβ42 production (2.Price D.L. Tanzi R.E. Borchelt D.R. Sisodia S.S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 461-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Thus, the amyloid cascade hypothesis has been proposed based on the speculation that Aβ42 production plays an early and critical role in the pathogenesis of AD (3.Hardy J.A. Higgins G.A. Science. 1992; 256: 184-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (5201) Google Scholar, 4.Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Gandy S.E. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1995; 8: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 5.Selkoe D.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 924: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). When aggregated, these amyloidogenic peptides may elicit inflammatory and neurotoxic responses in the brain, which are believed to result in the clinical manifestations of AD. Aβ peptides are generated from the sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), a type I transmembrane protein, by β-secretase in the ectodomain and by γ-secretase in the transmembrane region (6.Selkoe D.J. Schenk D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2003; 43: 545-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). A C-terminal membrane-bound fragment of 99 or 89 residues (C99/C89, βCTFs) is produced by β-secretase cleavage of APP, which is subsequently cleaved by γ-secretase within the transmembrane domain to release the Aβ peptides and APP intracellular domain. APP can also be cleaved by α-secretase in the ectodomain, which precludes its processing by the β-secretase pathway. Much effort in drug development has been aimed at reducing the generation or aggregation of Aβ peptides, among which inhibition of β-secretase or γ-secretase activity has been the focus of industry. BACE1 was identified as the β-secretase that cleaves APP within the ectodomain (7.Yan R. Bienkowski M.J. Shuck M.E. Miao H. Tory M.C. Pauley A.M. Brashier J.R. Stratman N.C. Mathews W.R. Buhl A.E.

A close homolog of BACE1 (BACE2) exists in the mammalian genome and shares ∼60% similarity with BACE1. BACE1 is expressed in all tissues, with the highest level of expression in the brain. The BACE1 protein is an intracellular type I transmembrane protein detected in the trans-Golgi network and endosomes. In brain samples of AD patients, the protein level and activity of BACE1 have been shown to be up-regulated (11.Fukumoto H. Cheung B.S. Hyman B.T. Irizarry M.C. Arch.

The essential role of BACE1 in the generation of Aβ peptides is demonstrated by the finding that no Aβ peptides can be detected in mice with homozygous deletion of bace1 (14.Roberds S.L. Anderson J.

Interestingly, bace1-null mice do not exhibit any developmental abnormalities or outward behavioral phenotypes. These features render BACE1 an obvious target for anti-amyloid therapy. Hong et al. (16.Hong L. Koelsch G. Lin X. Wu S. Terzyan S. Ghosh A.K. Zhang X.C. Tang J. Science. 2000; 290: 150-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar) reported the crystal structure of the ectodomain of BACE1 encompassing the catalytic domain co-crystallized with a peptide inhibitor. The overall structure of the enzyme is similar to that of other aspartyl proteases, with the notable difference that the BACE1 active site is more open and less hydrophobic. This feature of BACE1 poses challenges for the development of small molecule inhibitors. In this study, we inhibited BACE1 activity in cultured neurons and Aβ animal models using small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology. We show that BACE1 siRNA efficiently inhibited the generation of APP βCTFs and the secretion of Aβ peptides. Furthermore, BACE1 siRNA reduced Aβ production in neurons derived from transgenic mice harboring the Swedish APP mutant (APPsw). However, the subcellular distribution of APP and presenilin-1 did not appear to differ in BACE1 knockdown cells. Importantly, H2O2 oxidative stress caused marked increases in BACE1 expression, and pretreatment of neurons with BACE1 siRNA lessened H2O2-induced neurotoxicity. These results indicate that BACE1 siRNA specifically affects the β-cleavage of APP and hint at the potential therapeutic value of this approach for combating AD. Anti-APP antibody was from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. Anti-BACE1 and anti-BACE2 antibodies were from Calbiochem. Anti-presenilin-1 antibody was from Chemicon International, Inc. Anti-actin antibody was from Sigma. siRNAs corresponding to the BACE1 gene were designed as recommended (17.Elbashir S.M. Martinez J. Patkaniowska A. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T.

For experiments using cell lines, cells were transfected with siRNA or the indicated constructs using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM I for 24 h, and then the medium was changed back to growth medium for additional incubation. For experiments using primary cultures, 2-day in vitro cortical neurons were transfected with siRNA using LipofectAMINE 2000 in Opti-MEM I for 1.5 h. Subsequently, the medium was changed back to neurobasal medium (Invitrogen), and neurons were cultured for additional periods of time before further treatment.

Primary cultures of mouse embryonic cortical neurons were prepared as described (21.Niethammer M. Smith D.S. Ayala R. Peng J. Ko J. Lee M.S. Morabito M. Tsai L.-H.

In brief, dissociated embryonic neurons from embryonic day 15 (E15) C57BL/6 or APPsw Tg pregnant mice were plated onto poly-d-lysine/laminin-coated 24-well plates or coverslips and maintained in neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 supplement (Invitrogen), 1 mm l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin sulfate. Wild-type APP coding sequences were subcloned into the replication-defective HSV vector pHSVPrpUC. The resulting recombinant plasmid was packaged into viral particles in the packaging line 2-2 following the protocol described previously (22.Lim F. Hartley D. Starr P. Lang P. Song S. Yu L. Wang Y. Geller A.I. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 460-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The virus was then purified on a sucrose gradient, pelleted, and resuspended in 10% sucrose, and the titer of the recombinant virus was determined. Primary cortical neurons from E15 mouse embryos were cultured at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates. Two days after plating, neurons were cotransfected with fluorescein-labeled RNA duplex and BACE1 siRNA using LipofectAMINE 2000 for 1.5 h. In some experiments, 1-day in vitro culture was cotransfected with green fluorescence protein and pSilencer hairpin siRNA using calcium phosphate for 15 min. The medium was changed back to neurobasal medium after transfection. After a 72-h incubation, neurons were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, blocked, and permeabilized in 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min. Permeabilized neurons were incubated with anti-BACE1 antibody for 1 h at room temperature and subsequently incubated with Alexa Fluor® 568-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Images were captured using a Nikon inverted microscope linked to a DeltaVision deconvolution imaging system (Applied Precision). Wild-type Neurons Expressing Recombinant Human APP—Primary cortical neurons from E15 mouse embryos were cultured at a density of 4 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates. Two days after plating, neurons were transfected with siRNA using LipofectAMINE 2000 for 1.5 h. The medium was changed back to neurobasal medium after transfection. Neurons were incubated for another 48 h and then infected with HSV expressing human APP for 24 h. Cell lysates were prepared for examining βCTF generation by Western blot analysis. Conditioned media were collected and subjected to sandwich ELISA (BIOSOURCE). APPsw Cortical Neurons—Primary cortical neurons from E15 APPsw Tg mouse embryos were cultured at a density of 4 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates. After 2 days in vitro, neurons were transfected with siRNA using LipofectAMINE 2000 for 1.5 h, and the medium was changed back to neurobasal medium after transfection. After a 48-h incubation, the culture medium was changed again, and neurons were incubated for another 24 h. Subsequently, cell lysates and conditioned media were collected for examining βCTF and Aβ generation. Data were analyzed by t test using GraphPAD Prism. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. Primary cortical neurons from E15 mouse embryos were cultured at a density of 1.2 × 106 cells/10-cm plate. Two days after plating, neurons were transfected with siRNA using LipofectAMINE 2000 in Opti-MEM for 1.5 h. The medium was changed back to neurobasal medium after transfection. After a 72-h incubation, cell homogenates were collected in 1 ml of homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors) by 20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer, followed by an additional 20 strokes in a 1-ml syringe fitted with a 23-gauge needle. Lysates were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min to generate the post-nuclear supernatant. The post-nuclear supernatant was then adjusted to 25% OptiPrep (Nycomed/Axis-Shield) with 50% OptiPrep in homogenization buffer. The resulting mixture (2 ml in 25% OptiPrep) was placed at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube (14 × 89 mm) and overlaid successively with 1 ml each of 20, 18.5, 16.5, 14.5, 12.5, 10.5, 8.5, 6.5, and 5% OptiPrep in cold homogenization buffer. The gradients were centrifuged at 27,000 rpm for 18 h at 4 °C in a SW 41 rotor (Beckman Instruments). Fractions (500 μl) were collected from the top of the ultracentrifuge tubes and analyzed by Western blot analysis. Cell viability was examined using the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution cell proliferation assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Briefly, primary cortical neurons from E15 mouse embryos were cultured at a density of 4 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates. After 2 days in culture, neurons were transfected with BACE1 siRNA1 using LipofectAMINE 2000 for 1.5 h (with fluorescein-labeled RNA duplex as a control). The medium was changed back to neurobasal medium after transfection. Neurons were incubated for another 72 h and then treated with 10 μm H2O2 for 6 h. 1.5 h before the end of the H2O2 treatment, 100 μl of MTS colorimetric reagent was added to each well of the neuronal culture. Subsequently, the culture media were collected, and soluble formazan products derived from reduction of MTS by active cells were measured spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 490 nm. We chose 19-nucleotide mRNA sequences that are conserved between human, rat, and mouse BACE1 (but not BACE2) and designed four specific siRNAs against these target sequences (Fig. 1). To test the specificity of these siRNAs, we cotransfected CAD neuroblastoma cells with BACE1 siRNA, human BACE1 or BACE2 cDNA, and human APP cDNA. A non-silencing fluorescein-labeled RNA duplex (fluorescein-labeled siRNA) that does not overlap with any known mammalian genome sequence was used as a negative control. As shown in Fig. 2A, siRNA1 proved most efficient in reducing BACE1 expression, with an efficiency of 99% after 24 h of treatment. siRNA3 also reduced BACE1 protein levels by 90%, whereas siRNA2 and siRNA4 reduced BACE1 expression by ∼70 and 50%, respectively. Correspondingly, the levels of C99/C89, the two major BACE1 cleavage products of APP, were also decreased. In contrast, none of the four siRNAs affected BACE2 expression (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Effects of siRNAs on human BACE1 and BACE2 expression in CAD neuroblastoma cells and HEK293 cells. A, CAD cells were cotransfected with human APP, BACE1, and BACE1 siRNAs for 24 h. APP and BACE1 protein levels were examined by Western blot analysis. A >90% reduction in BACE1 protein levels was observed in the BACE1 siRNA-treated samples. B, the siRNA sequences chosen were specific to BACE1 and did not act on BACE2 mRNA. CAD cells were cotransfected with human APP, BACE2, and BACE1 siRNAs for 24 h. APP and BACE2 protein levels were analyzed by Western blotting. C, HEK293 cells were transfected with BACE1 siRNA for 48 or 72 h. Endogenous BACE1 and BACE2 expression levels were examined by Western blot analysis. The blots were reprobed with anti-actin antibody to verify protein loading. expo., exposure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also tested the efficacy of these siRNAs in suppressing endogenous human BACE1 and BACE2 expression in HEK293 cells. Similarly, we observed the strongest reduction in BACE1 expression by siRNA1 and siRNA3, whereas expression of BACE2 was not affected by any siRNA sequences tested (Fig. 2C). These observations demonstrate that both recombinant and endogenous human BACE1 expression can be reduced using specific siRNAs. We next investigated whether BACE1 siRNAs also affect the expression of endogenous BACE1 in mouse primary cortical neurons. Dissociated mouse cortical neurons were treated with the four siRNAs for 1.5 h. BACE1 levels were evaluated 72 h after siRNA treatment. We observed a 70% reduction of BACE1 in siRNA-treated neurons, but not in control fluorescein-labeled RNA-treated neurons (Fig. 3A). The down-regulation of BACE1 by siRNA could also be demonstrated by immunocytochemistry. We cotransfected mouse primary cortical neurons with BACE1 siRNA and fluorescein-labeled RNA duplex as a transfection indicator. We noticed that >90% of the neurons were fluorescein-positive (Fig. 3B), indicating that siRNAs were efficiently introduced into primary cortical neurons. In addition, the expression of BACE1 was reduced by up to 50% by the cognate BACE1 siRNA in most of the neurons. We also tested the effects of these siRNA duplexes in a short hairpin structure. Sense and antisense sequences of BACE1 siRNAs were cloned as hairpin structures into the pSilencer vector using the protocol suggested by the manufacturer (Ambion Inc.). The resulting pSilencer constructs were then introduced in conjugation with human BACE1 cDNA into CAD cells. Like siRNA duplexes, hairpin siRNAs could inhibit BACE1 protein expression (Fig. 3C). We observed the highest efficacy of BACE1 protein reduction with pSilencer-siRNA1 and pSilencer-siRNA3. In parallel experiments, primary cortical neurons were transfected with green fluorescence protein and pSilencer-siRNA constructs. We found that pSilencer-siRNA1-transfected neurons (as indicated by green fluorescence protein) exhibited diminished BACE1 staining, whereas neurons transfected with a nonspecific hairpin siRNA sequence displayed robust BACE1 immunoreactivity (Fig. 3D, white arrowheads). Together, these results demonstrate that specific siRNAs can down-regulate endogenous BACE1 expression in primary cortical neurons. As BACE1 cleavage of APP is the initial step for Aβ generation, we investigated the consequence of reducing endogenous BACE1 expression on APP processing. Mouse primary cortical neurons were transfected with cognate BACE1 siRNA for 1.5 h. In some experiments, neurons were infected with HSV expressing recombinant human APP (HSV-APP) to facilitate detection of Aβ generation. 72 h after siRNA treatment, we observed a significant reduction in the protein levels of BACE1 cleavage products of APP (C99/C89) in both non-infected and HSV-APP-infected neurons (Fig. 4A). To determine whether the reduced C99 levels impacted on secreted Aβ, we measured Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42) in the conditioned media of neurons infected with HSV-APP. The conditioned media of neurons without HSV-APP infection were used as background and were subtracted from the ELISA reading for all Aβ measurements. Fig. 4 (B and C) shows that BACE1 siRNAs effectively reduced Aβ secretion. There was a significant reduction of 40–60% in Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42) secretion compared with control samples. We also tested the effects of siRNA on BACE1 expression and APP processing in primary cortical neurons from transgenic mice expressing the Swedish double mutation (K670N/M671L) of human APP (APPsw). Similarly, introducing BACE1 siRNA1 or siRNA3 into APPsw cortical neurons led to a decrease in BACE1 protein expression (Fig. 5A). Correspondingly, C99/C89 generation (Fig. 5A) and Aβ secretion (Fig. 5, B and C) were reduced. Together, these results support the principle of reducing Aβ peptide generation using the BACE1 siRNA approach. Although β-cleavage of APP is carried out by BACE1, little is known about the regulation of this cleavage event. It was previously suggested that APP, BACE1, and presenilin-1 are assembled in the same transport vesicles (23.Kamal A. Almenar-Queralt A. LeBlanc J.F. Roberts E.A. Goldstein L.S. Nature. 2001; 414: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), yet it is still not clear whether BACE1 plays any role in the trafficking and/or subcellular localization of APP and presenilin-1. We determined whether suppression of BACE1 and subsequent APP CTF levels using siRNA changes the subcellular distribution of APP and presenilin-1. Control and BACE1 siRNA1-treated cortical neurons were fractionated using an OptiPrep gradient, which separates organelle membranes according to vesicular density. siRNA treatment efficiently lowered BACE1 protein levels (Fig. 6). Importantly, there were no changes in APP and presenilin-1 protein levels and subcellular distribution after siRNA treatment. These results further support the specificity of BACE1 siRNA. Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of AD. Many oxidation products, including hydroxyl radicals (·OH), accumulate in AD brains. H2O2 treatment, an experimental system used to induce oxidative stress, has been widely applied to the study of oxidative stress-induced neurodegenerative responses. H2O2 induces intracellular accumulation of Aβ in neuroblastoma cells (24.Misonou H. Morishima-Kawashima M. Ihara Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6951-6959Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). It is currently unclear how H2O2 induces Aβ generation. We treated primary cortical neurons with 10 μm H2O2 for 6 h and found that both the BACE1 protein and its products (βCTFs) were significantly increased, accompanied by a decrease in full-length APP levels (Fig. 7A) (25.Tamagno E. Bardini P. Obbili A. Vitali A. Borghi R. Zaccheo D. Pronzato M.A. Danni O. Smith M.A. Perry G. Tabaton M. Neurobiol. Dis. 2002; 10: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). We also measured Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42) in the conditioned media of neurons infected with HSV-APP and found a corresponding increase in Aβ generation after H2O2 treatment (Fig. 7B). In addition, cell death was induced after H2O2 treatment as determined by MTS assay (Fig. 7C). Interestingly, transfecting neurons with BACE1 siRNA1 lowered the BACE1, βCTF, and Aβ induction levels following H2O2 treatment (Fig. 7, A and B). Importantly, pretreatment with BACE1 siRNA1 reduced H2O2-induced cell death (Fig. 7C). Together, these data show that suppression of BACE1 expression may protect neurons from oxidative stress-induced cell death. The discovery that siRNA can specifically suppress targeted gene expression and be delivered effectively to disease models opens new perspectives in molecular therapeutics. As BACE1 cleavage of APP is the first step in Aβ biogenesis, BACE1 has been proposed as a key therapeutic target in treating AD. In this study, we have shown that endogenous BACE1 expression in neurons can be suppressed by synthetic siRNAs and by short hairpin RNAs transcribed in vivo from DNA templates carried by the pSilencer vector. Importantly, inactivation of BACE1 by RNA interference leads to decreased βCTF and Aβ production in primary cortical neurons prepared from wild-type as well as APPsw Tg mice. While our manuscript was in preparation, Basi et al. (26.Basi G. Frigon N. Barbour R. Doan T. Gordon G. McConlogue L. Sinha S. Zeller M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31512-31520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) published a similar study demonstrating that selective inactivation of endogenous BACE1 by RNA interference results in decreased secreted APPβ and Aβ secretion by HEK293 cells stably expressing recombinant wild-type APP or APPsw. However, the previous work did not show suppression in any neuronal system where the highest expression of BACE1 is observed. Furthermore, we have shown that BACE1 siRNA not only suppressed the increase in BACE1 seen with H2O2 treatment, but also enhanced cell survival. H2O2 serves as a model for oxidative stress, which increasingly appears to be involved in the pathogenesis and progression of AD (27.Markesbery W.R. Carney J.M. Brain Pathol. 1999; 9: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 28.Behl C. Davis J.B. Lesley R. Schubert D. Cell. 1994; 77: 817-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2052) Google Scholar). We found that oxidative stress induced BACE1 expression and significantly increased βCTF (C99/C89) and Aβ generation. This supports previous studies demonstrating that oxidant agents induce the accumulation of intracellular Aβ (Triton X-100-insoluble) and increase Aβ secretion in neuroblastoma cells (24.Misonou H. Morishima-Kawashima M. Ihara Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6951-6959Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). We also observed a corresponding decrease in full-length APP and α-secretase product, C83 levels after H2O2 treatment. It is possible that H2O2 treatment led to a shift in APP processing from the α-secretase to β-secretase pathway. It is not clear to us why there is no corresponding increase in full-length APP levels after BACE1 siRNA treatment. As oxidative stress also induces caspase activities, it is likely that the remaining decreased full-length APP level after siRNA treatment is a result of APP processing by caspases. The mechanisms underlying increased BACE1 expression by oxidative stress are unknown, but activation of β-isoforms of protein kinase C (29.Paola D. Domenicotti C. Nitti M. Vitali A. Borghi R. Cottalasso D. Zaccheo D. Odetti P. Strocchi P. Marinari U.M. Tabaton M. Pronzato M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 642-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and alterations in calcium homeostasis (30.Mark R.J. Lovell M.A. Markesbery W.R. Uchida K. Mattson M.P. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 31.Fowler C.J. Ando Y. Tiger G. Neurochem. Int. 1998; 33: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) have been proposed as possible mediators. These signaling events regulate trafficking of APP or APP derivatives, which may lead to increased exposure of APP to β- and/or γ-secretase. Interestingly, we found that pretreating neurons with BACE1 siRNA lowered the BACE1 levels induced by H2O2. At this stage, we cannot rule out the possibility that oxidative stress affects BACE1 levels through stabilization of the protein. However, as the effects of siRNA have been well documented, and we did observe a decrease in BACE1 induction levels after BACE1 siRNA treatment, it is possible that BACE1 induction by H2O2 is also regulated via a transcription-dependent mechanism. Importantly, an improvement in cell viability was also observed. This finding suggests that increased BACE1 expression by oxidative stress may trigger further downstream responses, which can be prevented by reducing BACE1 levels with siRNA. The increase in BACE1 products, particularly Aβ, contributes to cell death in this model. The specificity of siRNA is underscored by its differential effects on the suppression of BACE1 versus BACE2 expression. Using siRNA designed according to the conserved nucleotide sequence between human, rat, and mouse BACE1, we successfully reduced the expression of recombinant human BACE1 and endogenous human and mouse BACE1 without changing the protein levels of recombinant or endogenous BACE2. Both BACE1 and BACE2 make a second cleavage within the Aβ sequence; however, the BACE1 cleavage product remains amyloidogenic, whereas the BACE2 product does not (32.Yan R. Munzner J.B. Shuck M.E.

Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9712-9717Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Therefore, inhibiting BACE2 is not desirable, and RNA interference provides the specificity to selectively suppress only one of the BACE isoforms. Previous studies have shown that no apparent adverse effects are observed in bace1-deficient mice (14.Roberds S.L. Anderson J. Basi G. Bienkowski M.J. Branstetter D.G. Chen K.S. Freedman S.B.

Similarly, we found that suppression of BACE1 expression by siRNA did not change the subcellular distribution of APP and presenilin-1, indicating that loss of BACE1 elicits no profound cellular defects. However, another BACE1 substrate (α2,6-sialyltransferase) has been reported (34.Kitazume S. Tachida Y. Oka R. Kotani N. Ogawa K. Suzuki M. Dohmae N. Takio K. Saido T.C. Hashimoto Y. J. Biol.

Despite this caveat, most data support the possibility that inhibition of BACE1 may not be toxic to animals or humans. Together, our findings that siRNA can specifically suppress BACE1 expression and that loss of BACE1 using siRNA elicits no profound cellular defects support BACE1 as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of AD. At this juncture, improved delivery methods for siRNAs need to be developed to bring this approach to fruition. We thank Dr. R. Neve for generation of recombinant HSV, Dr. Z. Xie for culturing mouse primary cortical neurons, and Dr. K. D. Swanson and C. Frank for discussion and critical reading of the manuscript."

The mechanisms/factors that negatively regulate NF-κB in the human gut and the pathways leading to the sustained NF-κB activation in gut inflammation remain to be identified. Pretreatment of normal human intestinal lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) with transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) resulted in a marked suppression of TNF-α–induced NF-κB p65 accumulation in the nucleus, NF-κB binding DNA activity, and NF-κB-dependent gene activation. TGF-β1 also increased IκBα transcripts and protein in normal LPMC. In marked contrast, treatment of LPMC from patients with inflammatory bowel disease with TGF-β1 did not reduce TNF-induced NF-κB activation due to the overexpression of Smad7. Indeed inhibiting Smad7 by specific antisense oligonucleotides increased IκBα expression and reduced NF-κB p65 accumulation in the nucleus. This effect was due to endogenous TGF-β1. TGF-β1 directly stimulated IκBα promoter transcriptional activity in gut fibroblasts in vitro, and overexpression of Smad7 blocked this effect. These data show that TGF-β1 is a negative regulator of NF-κB activation in the gut and that Smad7 maintains high NF-κB activity in gut inflammation by blocking TGF-β1 signaling.

The excessive mucosal immune responses in gut inflammation are characterized by increased synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines, which activate the NF-κB pathway in the gut wall (1Fiocchi C. Gastroenterology. 1998; 115: 182-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1858) Google Scholar). For example, the activity of the p65 subunit of NF-κB is enhanced in the mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), 1The abbreviations used are: IBDinflammatory bowel diseaseCDCrohn's diseaseILinterleukinTNFtumor necrosis factorTGFtransforming growth factorLPMClamina propria mononuclear cellsUCulcerative colitisCHXcycloheximideTPCKN-p-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chlorometyl ketoneEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assay.1The abbreviations used are: IBDinflammatory bowel diseaseCDCrohn's diseaseILinterleukinTNFtumor necrosis factorTGFtransforming growth factorLPMClamina propria mononuclear cellsUCulcerative colitisCHXcycloheximideTPCKN-p-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chlorometyl ketoneEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assay. and inhibition of NF-κB with a specific p65 antisense oligonucleotide is effective in preventing/treating experimental models of IBD and efficiently down-regulates cytokine production by intestinal macrophages from Crohn's disease (CD) patients (2Neurath M.F.

Many important questions remain regarding the biochemical pathways that lead to the sustained NF-κB activation in gut inflammation. NF-κB is up-regulated by a large number of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1, IL-18, TNF-α, all of which are produced in excess in inflamed bowel (1Fiocchi C. Gastroenterology. 1998; 115: 182-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1858) Google Scholar). In contrast little is known about the mechanisms/factors that negatively regulate NF-κB activity in the normal and inflamed human intestine. Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is a multifunctional cytokine capable of regulating the growth, differentiation, and function of immune and non-immune cells (5Letterio J.J. Roberts A.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 137-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1658) Google Scholar). TGF-β1 initiates signaling through the ligand-dependent activation of a complex of heterodimeric transmembrane serine/threonine kinases, consisting of type I (TGF-β1 RI) and type II (TGF-β1 RII) receptors (6Piek E. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2105-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). After TGF-β1 binding, there is phosphorylation and activation of TGF-βRI by the constitutively active and auto-phosphorylated TGF-βRII (6Piek E. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2105-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Activated TGF-βRI then directly phosphorylates Smad2 and Smad3. Smad2 and Smad3 associate with Smad4 and translocate to the nucleus where Smad protein complexes participate in transcriptional control of target genes (7Heldin C.-H. Kohei M. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3326) Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of the Smad3 gene is associated with diminished responsiveness to TGF-β1 (8Yang X. Letterio J.J. Lechleider R.J. Chen L. Hayman R. Gu H. Roberts A.B. Deng C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1280-1291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant mice exhibit a massive infiltration of T cells and pyogenic abscess formation in the stomach and intestine (8Yang X. Letterio J.J. Lechleider R.J. Chen L. Hayman R. Gu H. Roberts A.B. Deng C.

FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2105-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). The antagonistic Smad, Smad7, associates with the ligand-activated TGF-βRI and interferes with the activation of Smad2/Smad3 by preventing interaction with TGF-βRI (9Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y. Cai J. Xu Y.Y. Grinnell B.W. Richardson M.A. Topper J.N. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Wrana J.L. Falb D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1165-1173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Smad7 in the gut of patients with IBD blocks TGF-β1 signaling (10Monteleone G. Kumberova A. Croft N.M. McKenzie C. Steer H.W. MacDonald T.T. J. Clin.

Studies in animals have shown that defective TGF-β1 activity promotes and/or exacerbates chronic intestinal inflammation (11Strober W. Fuss I.J. Blumberg R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 495-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the molecular mechanisms underlying the counter-regulatory effects of TGF-β1 in the gut are not known. Studies using cell lines have demonstrated that TGF-β1 can either promote or inhibit NF-κB activation (12Han S.H. Yea S.S. Jeon Y.J. Yang K.H. Kaminski N.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

In this study we investigated functionally if TGF-β1 negatively regulates NF-κB in human intestinal LPMC and if the chronic activation of the NF-κB pathway seen in IBD LPMC is due to impaired negative regulation of the TGF-β1 signaling pathway due to enhanced Smad7 expression. Patients and Samples—Mucosal samples were taken from resection specimens of 15 patients with moderate-to-severe CD. In nine patients the primary site of disease was the colon, and in six both the terminal ileum and colon were involved. Eleven patients were receiving mesalazine and/or antibiotics, and five were on corticosteroids. The indication for surgery was a chronic disease, unresponsive to medical treatment. Mucosal samples were also taken from four patients with active ulcerative colitis (UC) undergoing colectomy; all were receiving mesalazine and steroids. Age-matched controls included normal colectomy specimens from 17 patients with colon cancer. Local ethical approval was obtained. Isolation and Culture of Lamina Propria Mononuclear Cell—LPMC were prepared as described previously (16Monteleone G. Biancone L. Marasco R. Morrone G. Marasco O. Luzza F. Pallone F. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 1169-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), and an aliquot was immediately used for extracting cytosolic and nuclear proteins. The remaining LPMC were resuspended in RPMI 1640 (Sigma, Dorset, UK) supplemented with a serum replacement reagent HL-1 (Biowhittaker, Wokingham, UK) and cultured in the presence or absence of TGF-β1 (final concentration ranging from 1 to 5 ng/ml, Sigma) for 1–28 h and then stimulated with medium or TNF-α (5 ng/ml; Peprotech EC Ltd., London, UK) for the indicated times. To examine whether the regulatory actions of TGF-β1 on IκBα were direct or not, LPMC were cultured with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX, 10 μg/ml final concentration, Sigma) for 12 h and then stimulated with TGF-β1 for further 1–2 h. In other experiments, IBD LPMC were resuspended in RPMI 1640 supplemented with HL-1 and cultured in the presence or absence of a Smad7 antisense or control sense oligonucleotide (both used at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml) for 24 h in the absence of lipofectamine (10Monteleone G. Kumberova A. Croft N.M. McKenzie C. Steer H.W. MacDonald T.T. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 601-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Smad7 antisense and sense oligonucleotide sequences have been reported previously (10Monteleone G. Kumberova A. Croft N.M. McKenzie C. Steer H.W. MacDonald T.T. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 601-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). In four separate experiments, IBD LPMC were treated with the Smad7 antisense in the presence or absence of a neutralizing TGF-β1 antibody (5 μg/ml; R & D Systems, Abingdon, UK). After 24 h, an aliquot of LPMC was used for extracting proteins for analysis of Smad7. The remaining cells were extensively washed, resuspended in RPMI 1640 plus HL-1 and cultured in the presence or absence of TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) for 7–14 h and then stimulated with TNF-α. Finally to examine the effect of NF-κB activity on Smad7 expression, IBD LPMC were stimulated with N-p-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chlorometyl ketone (TPCK, 10 μm, Sigma), an inhibitor of NF-κB activation, or ethanol (vehicle) for 5 up to 24 h. RNA Extraction, cDNA Preparation, and Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Total RNA, cDNA preparation, and RT-PCR were carried out as indicated previously (16Monteleone G. Biancone L. Marasco R. Morrone G.

RT-PCR products were electrophoresed in 1% agarose gel containing 0.3 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear protein-DNA binding studies were carried out for 20 min at room temperature in a 20-ml reaction volume containing 10 mm Tris, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (all from Sigma); 50 fmol of biotin labeled oligonucleotides-containing probe; and 10 μg of nuclear proteins. The DNA probe was prepared by annealing the two consensus oligonucleotides (forward, 5′-AGTTGAGGGGAGTTTCCCAGG-3′; reverse, 5′-CGGACCCTTTCAGGGGAGTTGA-3′), which were labeled at the 3′ end with biotin using a commercially available kit (Pierce). The binding specificity was confirmed by incubating the nuclear protein samples with unlabeled NF-κB probe or nonspecific oligonucleotide of the IL-2 gene (IL2G) (5-ACAACGCGTGAGCTCTCTAGAAAGCATCATCTCAACACTAACTTGATAATTAAGTGCCTCGAGCA CA-3′) in 100-fold molar excess to compete binding. In antibody-blocking assays, a monoclonal anti-human NF-κB/p65 or p50 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or control isotype IgG antibody (Dako Ltd., Milan, Italy) (both used at a concentration of 2.5 μg) were incubated with the nuclear proteins for 45 min before adding the DNA probe. A 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel was used for electrophoretic separation. After blotting to a membrane, labeled oligonucleotides were detected with a chemiluminescence EMSA kit (Pierce). Protein Extraction and Western Blot Analysis—LPMC were homogenized and cytosolic extracts collected in buffer A containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mm EGTA. Nuclear extracts were prepared by solubilizing the remaining nuclei in buffer C containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 10% glycerol. Both buffers were supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethanesulphonyl fluoride (all from Sigma). For the detection of cytosolic and nuclear NF-κB/p65, 10 μg/sample of cytosolic or nuclear proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. p65 was detected using a rabbit anti-human NF-κB/p65 (1:500 final dilution) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG monoclonal antibody (Dako) (final dilution 1:2500). The reaction was detected with ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences, Amersham, UK). To confirm equal loading and transfer of proteins, Ponceau S (Sigma) staining was performed. After detection of nuclear p65, blots were stripped and analyzed for histone-1 using a mouse anti-human histone-1 monoclonal antibody (1:300 final dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by a goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:1500 dilution, Dako). Both IκBα and IκBβ were detected by Western blotting using a rabbit anti-human IκBα or IκBβ antibody (both used at 1:500 final dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Blots were stripped and reblotted for β-actin as indicated previously (10Monteleone G. Kumberova A. Croft N.M. McKenzie C. Steer H.W. MacDonald T.T. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 601-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Smad7 was analyzed using a specific rabbit anti-human Smad7 antibody (1:500 final dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc 11392). Goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:20,000 dilution, Dako) was used to detect primary antibody binding and immunoreactivity visualized with a chemiluminescence kit (Pierce). Western blots or PCR gels were scanned on a densitometer and values expressed in arbitrary units. Differences in band intensity were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. Plasmid DNA—All plasmid DNA was prepared using a commercial DNA extraction and isolation kit (Maxiprep, Qiagen, Crawley, UK). A luciferase reporter vector containing nucleotides –332 to +35 of the human IκB-α gene promoter was provided by Professor Ron Hay (School of Biology, St. Andrews University, St. Andrews, UK). The control Renilla luciferase vector pRLTK was purchased from Promega (Southampton, UK). The Smad7-pcDNA3 expression vector was kindly provided by Prof C.-H. Heldin, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala, Sweden, and was used as described previously (17Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.-H. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar). Transfections and Reporter Gene Assays—Primary gut fibroblasts (18Bajaj-Elliot M. Poulsom R. Pender S.L.F. Wathen N.C. MacDonald T.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1473-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) were transfected by the non-liposomal Effectene protocol (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase assays were performed using a dual luciferase kit (Promega). IκBα promoter-driven expression of firefly luciferase (pIκBα-Luc) was normalized for differences in transfection efficiency by measurement of the activity of a co-transfected Renilla luciferase vector (pRLTK). Primary gut fibroblasts were transfected with 0.5 μg of wild type pIk Ba-Luc, 1 μg Smad7 expression vector, or pcDNA3 control vector and 100 ng of pRLTK per 5 × 105 cell sample. After 16 h transfected cells were either incubated with 1 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 2, 4, or 24 h or left untreated. Cells were harvested, lysed, and luciferase activity determined and normalized to pRLTK activity and expressed as the fold induction of untreated control cell sample ± S.E. of three independent transfections. TGF-β1 Inhibits NF-κB Activation in Normal LPMC—Stimulation of cells with TNF-α alone resulted in a marked nuclear translocation of p65 (Fig. 1A). Preincubation with TGF-β1 prevented the TNF-α-induced p65 nuclear translocation (Fig. 1, A and B), with no change in the content of cytosolic NF-κB (not shown). Stimulation of normal LPMC with TNF-α also enhanced specific NF-κB DNA binding activity (Fig. 1C). Super-shift assays showed that TNF-α enhanced both p65/p50 heterodimer and p50 homodimer. Preincubation of LPMC with TGF-β1 reduced the TNF-α-induced NF-κB DNA complexes, with a more marked effect on p65/p50 heterodimer (Fig. 1C). As TNF-α up-regulates IL-8 transcription through an NF-κB-dependent mechanism (19Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5551) Google Scholar), we established whether TGF-β1 inhibited IL-8 gene expression. As expected TNF-α-treated LPMC displayed a strong increase in IL-8 RNA transcripts (Fig. 1D). However TNF-induced IL-8 transcripts were markedly inhibited by pretreatment with TGF-β1 (Fig. 1D). TGF-β1 Inhibits NF-κB/p65 Nuclear Translocation and Induces IκBα in Normal LPMC—One potential mechanism by which TGF-β1 suppresses NF-κB activation could be related to its ability to prevent nuclear translocation of p65. IκBα protein was analyzed in cytosolic extracts isolated from LPMC preincubated with TGF-β1 for 7 h and then treated with TNF-α for various times. In untreated LPMC, the cytoplasmic IκBα signal almost completely disappeared after 20 min of treatment with TNF-α and returned to the original level after 40 min of stimulation (Fig. 2A). Pretreatment of LPMC with TGF-β1 for 7 h increased IκBα expression and subsequent stimulation with TNF-α led to no reduction in IκBα (Fig. 2A). The key change in LPMC pretreated with TGF-β1 (compared with cells pretreated with medium) prior to TNF-α was a substantially higher IκBα/β-actin ratio at all time points after treatment (Fig. 2B). Cytosolic extracts were prepared from normal LPMC treated with TGF-β1 for various times and analyzed by Western blotting. TGF-β1 treatment resulted in enhanced IκBα protein expression for up to 28 h (Fig. 3A). TGF-β1 also increased IκBα transcripts in normal LPMC (Fig. 3B). The effect of TGF-β1 on IκBα transcripts did not depend on the synthesis of new proteins as TGF-β1-mediated IκBα induction was not inhibited by CHX (Fig. 3C). In contrast TGF-β1 did not affect IκBβ protein expression ((Fig. 3A).Fig. 3A, TGF-β1 enhances IκBα protein in normal LPMC. Upper panel, representative Western blot showing IκBα in cytosolic extracts from normal LPMC cultured in medium (UNST) for 7 h or TGF-β1 for the indicated time points. One of five representative experiments is shown. After detection of IκBα, the membrane was stripped and incubated with an IκBβ antibody (middle panel). The membrane was stripped and incubated with a β-actin antibody (lower blot) to ascertain equivalent loading of the lanes. Inset, quantitative analysis of the IκBα/β-actin ratio. TGF-β1 significantly increased IκBα at all times (p < 0.01). B, TGF-β1 induces IκBα transcripts in normal LPMC. Representative agarose gel showing IκBα and β-actin RNA transcripts in normal LPMC. LPMC were either left untreated (UNST) or treated with TGF-β1 for the indicated time points and then analyzed as experimental procedures. One of three representative experiments using cells from different patients is shown. C, pretreatment of normal LPMC with CHX does not affect TGF-β1-induced IκBα. Normal LPMC were cultured with CHX and then stimulated with TGF-β1. Two of four representative experiments using LPMC from different normal controls is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) LPMC from Patients with IBD Exhibit High NF-κB/p65 Nuclear Accumulation and Low Cytosolic IκBα—Abundant immunoreactivity for NF-κB/p65 was seen in nuclear extracts from IBD LPMC in comparison with control samples (Fig. 4A). Importantly, the high p65 nuclear accumulation documented in IBD LPMC was associated with a reduced cytoplasmic IκBα protein expression compared with normal LPMC (Fig. 4B). Two bands, likely corresponding to the basal and phosphorylated form of IκBα, were seen in IBD LPMC samples (Fig. 4B). We next determined if TGF-β1 could inhibit NF-κB activation in cells from IBD patients. The already high nuclear NF-κB/p65 increased modestly after stimulation with TNFα (Fig. 5A). However pretreatment with TGF-β1 had no effect (Fig. 5A). Likewise TGF-β1 did not reduce DNA binding activity in extracts of IBD LPMC (Fig. 5B).Fig. 5TGF-β1 fails to inhibit NF-κB activation in IBD LPMC.A, representative Western blots showing NF-κB/p65 in nuclear extracts from IBD LPMC. LPMC were either cultured with medium or TGF-β1 for 7 h and then stimulated with medium or TNF-α for 30 min. After detection of p65, the membrane was stripped and incubated with a histone-1 antibody (lower blot). Two of five representative experiments analyzing LPMC isolated from three patients with CD and two with UC are shown. Inset, quantitative analysis of the p65/histone-1 ratio (n = 8 patients/group).

Treatment with Smad7 antisense inhibited Smad7 protein expression (Fig. 6A). Both unstimulated and Smad7 sense-treated LPMC exhibited low cytosolic IκBα and high levels of nuclear p65 (Fig. 6, B and C). In antisense treated LPMC, however, there was a marked increase in cytosolic IκBα and reduced nuclear p65 immunoreactivity (Fig. 6, B and C), which was prevented by a neutralizing TGF-β1 antibody, suggesting that inhibition of Smad7 allows endogenous TGF-β1 to inhibit NF-κB. Addition of a control IgG to the antisense treated IBD LPMC did not reduce cytoplasmic IκBα or increase nuclear p65 (not shown). NF-κB DNA binding activity was used to verify the effects of antisense on Smad7. IBD LPMC pretreated with medium or sense oligonucleotide and then cultured in medium alone showed high NF-κB binding activity (Fig. 6D), which was slightly enhanced by treatment with TNF-α and only modestly decreased by pre-treatment with TGF-β1. IBD LPMC treated with Smad7 antisense showed reduced NF-κB binding activity when cultured with medium alone. In these cells, stimulation with TNF-α resulted in a high NF-κB binding, which was prevented by TGF-β1 (Fig. 6D). Smad7 Controls TGF-β1 Induction of IκBα—In immune-mediated gut damage, tissue degradation is mediated by matrix metalloproteinases produced by local fibroblasts (20Monteleone G. MacDonald T.T. Wathen N.C. Pallone F. Pender S.L.F. Gastroenterology. 1999; 117: 1069-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), which also participate in the pro-inflammatory cytokine cascade (21Rogler G. Gelbmann C.M. Vogl D. Brunner M. Scholmerich J. Falk W. Andus T. Brand K. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 2001; 36: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition gut fibroblasts can be grown in culture, making them ideal for transfection studies. Primary gut myofibroblasts were therefore transfected with a construct carrying the luciferase reporter gene under the transcriptional control of the human IκBα promoter (pIκBα-Luc) or with a control vector pRLTK. Sixteen hours after transfection, cells were incubated with TGF-β1 for 2, 4, or 24 h. TGF-β1 increased transcriptional activity by ∼2.5- and 3.5-fold after 2 and 4 h (Fig. 7). Cotransfection with a plasmid encoding Smad7 abolished this effect (Fig. 7). Inhibition of NF-κB Does Not Change Smad7 Expression in IBD LPMC—Signaling through NF-κB induces Smad7 in fibroblast cell lines (22Bitzer M. von Gersdorff G. Liang D. Dominguez-Rosales A. Beg A.A. Rojkind M. Bottinger E.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 187-197PubMed Google Scholar), so we analyzed whether the sustained NF-κB activity seen in IBD LPMC could contribute to Smad7 induction. IBD LPMC were treated with TPCK, an inhibitor of NF-κB activity, and then analyzed for Smad7. As expected 5-h treatment of IBD LPMC with TPCK inhibited NF-κB/p65 nuclear translocation, but there was no change in Smad7 (Fig. 8), indicating that regulation of Smad7 in IBD LPMC is different from that documented in fibroblast cell lines (22Bitzer M. von Gersdorff G. Liang D. Dominguez-Rosales A. Beg A.A. Rojkind M. Bottinger E.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 187-197PubMed Google Scholar). In this work we show that TGF-β1 is a powerful negative regulator of the transcription factor NF-κB in the human intestine. We first demonstrated that pretreatment of normal LPMC with TGF-β1 blocked the TNFα induced nuclear translocation of p65, and this was associated with induction of IκBα. Both NF-κB binding activity and expression of the NF-κB-dependent IL-8 gene by TNF-α were inhibited by preincubation of LPMC with TGF-β1. In marked contrast, TGF-β1 was unable to inhibit NF-κB activation in IBD LPMC. It is highly likely that the high Smad7 seen in the inflamed mucosa of IBD patients (10Monteleone G. Kumberova A. Croft N.M. McKenzie C. Steer H.W. MacDonald T.T. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 601-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) is the major contributor to this failure of negative regulation. Indeed decreasing Smad7 with an antisense oligonucleotide allowed endogenous TGF-β1 to up-regulate IκBα and lower NF-κB accumulation in the nucleus. In response to NF-κB activating stimuli, IκBα is phosphorylated by upstream kinases, ubiquitinated and finally degraded by the proteasome pathway. After degradation, IκBα protein is, however, rapidly re-synthesized through a mechanism, which is partly dependent on NF-κB activity (19Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5551) Google Scholar). Since LPMC treated with TGF-β1 show a level of IκBα higher than that seen in both untreated or TNF-α-stimulated cells, and previous studies have shown that TGF-β1 stimulates IκBα in epithelial and B cell lines (14Sovak M.A. Arsura M. Zanieski G. Kavanagh K.T. Sonenshein G.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 537-544PubMed Google Scholar, 15Arsura M. Wu M. Sonenshein G.E. Immunity. 1996; 5: 31-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), we focused our experiments on the possibility that TGF-β1 could induce IκBα synthesis in LPMC. Indeed, treatment of LPMC with TGF-β1 increased IκBα protein and mRNA. Furthermore, we showed that TGF-β1 enhanced IκBα promoter transcriptional activity in primary gut fibroblasts, clearly indicating that TGF-β1 controls IκBα gene expression. The mechanism by which TGF-β1 stimulates IκBα transcription is not known; however, sequence analysis of the human IκBα promoter revealed the presence of 4 potential TGF-β/activin-inducible CAGA box elements (data not shown). The presence of multiple CAGA box elements has been described for several TGF-β-inducible promoters and in the plasminogen activator inhibitor-type gene promoter have been demonstrated to interact with Smad3/Smad4 and to be required for TGF-β1 responsiveness (23Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). The fact that overexpression of Smad7 in gut myofibroblasts blocked the TGF-β1-induced IκBα promoter activity supports the role of Smad3 pathway in regulating IκBα expression. Another critical question remains as whether as TGF-β1 influences NF-κB activation directly or via other cytokines. Indeed, it is known that TGF-β1 can stimulate IL-10 production in some cell systems and that IL-10 inhibits TNF-α-induced IκBα degradation in both monocytic and intestinal epithelial cell lines (24Maeda H. Shiraishi A. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 73-78PubMed Google Scholar, 25Schottelius A.J.G. Mayo M.W. Sartor R.B. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31868-31874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). We think this is unlikely. First, treatment of normal LPMC with TGF-β1 did not enhance IL-10 RNA transcripts (not shown). Second, an increase in IκBα RNA induction in response to TGF-β1 occurs after a very short time (i.e. 1 h of stimulation), thus making improbable the involvement of other TGF-β1-induced cytokines. TGF-β1 is one of the most widely distributed cytokines that acts on virtually all cell types and their function. Particularly, TGF-β1 plays an important role in the control of immune homeostasis and prevention of mucosal inflammation (11Strober W. Fuss I.J. Blumberg R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 495-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). TGF-β1 knock-out mice develop a severe multiple organ inflammatory disease, in which the lymphocytic infiltration of the affected organs is associated with increased production of inflammatory cytokines (26Shull M.M. Ormsby I. Kier A.B. Pawlowski S. Diebold R.J. Yin M. Allen R. Sidman C. Proetzel G. Calvin D. Annunziata N. Doetschman T. Nature. 1992; 359: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (2615) Google Scholar). Abrogation of TGF-β1 signaling in T cells alone is sufficient to break T and B cell homeostasis and induce T cell-mediated inflammatory lesions in various organs, including the intestine (27Gorelik L. Flavell R.A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 171-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Finally, it has been demonstrated that the loss of TGF-β1 activity results in the induction and/or amplification of pathogenic responses responsible for the development of experimental colitis resembling either CD or UC (11Strober W. Fuss I.J. Blumberg R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 495-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar, 28Hahm K.B. Im Y.H. Parks T.W. Park S.H. Markowitz S. Jung H.Y. Green J. Kim S.J. Gut. 2001; 49: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Consistent with this we have recently shown that in both CD and UC there is diminished TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling, due to high Smad7 (10Monteleone G. Kumberova A. Croft N.M. McKenzie C. Steer H.W. MacDonald T.T. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 601-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The data in the present study confirm and expand on the major role of Smad7 in IBD. Treatment of IBD LPMC with Smad7 antisense caused a dramatic drop in NF-κB/p65 nuclear accumulation which was paralleled by an increase in IκBα expression. Such an effect was likely due to the restored ability of IBD LPMC to respond to endogenous TGF-β1. Indeed, treatment of IBD LPMC with a neutralizing TGF-β1 antibody prevented the Smad7 antisense-mediated inhibition of NF-κB activation. Furthermore, abrogation of Smad7 by specific antisense DNA resulted in a complete inhibition by TGF-β1 of the TNF-α-induced NF-κB binding DNA activity. Activation of NF-κB/p65 seems to play a key role in the pathogenesis of colitis (2Neurath M.F. Becker C. Barbulescu K. Gut. 1998; 43: 856-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 3Schreiber S. Nicolaus S. Hampe J. Gut. 1998; 42: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 4Neurath M.F. Petterson S. Meyer zum Buschenfelde K.H. Strober W. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 998-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). In keeping with this, we showed that IBD LPMC exhibited high p65 nuclear accumulation, which was associated with reduced expression of cytosolic IκBα. In addition, the demonstration that TGF-β1 negatively regulated NF-κB activation in normal LPMC and that treatment of IBD LPMC with a specific Smad7 antisense resulted in an inhibition of NF-κB activation allowed to delineate a scenario in which defective TGF-β1 signaling due to exaggerated Smad7 helps maintain high NF-κB activity, thereby expanding the local inflammatory response in IBD. Blocking Smad7 might be a useful way to dampen mucosal inflammation in IBD."
https://openalex.org/W2138496162,"Molecular misreading of the ubiquitin-B (UBB) gene results in a dinucleotide deletion in UBB mRNA. The resulting mutant protein, UBB+1, accumulates in the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer disease. In vitro, UBB+1 inhibits proteasomal proteolysis, although it is also an ubiquitin fusion degradation substrate for the proteasome. Using the ligase chain reaction to detect dinucleotide deletions, we report here that UBB+1 transcripts are present in each neurodegenerative disease studied (tauo- and synucleinopathies) and even in control brain samples. In contrast to UBB+1 transcripts, UBB+1 protein accumulation in the ubiquitin-containing neuropathological hallmarks is restricted to the tauopathies such as Pick disease, frontotemporal dementia, progressive supranuclear palsy, and argyrophilic grain disease. Remarkably, UBB+1 protein is not detected in the major forms of synucleinopathies (Lewy body disease and multiple system atrophy). The neurologically intact brain can cope with UBB+1 as lentivirally delivered UBB+1 protein is rapidly degraded in rat hippocampus, whereas the K29,48R mutant of UBB+1, which is not ubiquitinated, is abundantly expressed. The finding that UBB+1 protein only accumulates in tauopathies thus implies that the ubiquitin-proteasome system is impaired specifically in this group of neurodegenerative diseases and not in synucleinopathies and that the presence of UBB+1 protein reports proteasomal dysfunction in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W1980261795,"Tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease, are neurodegenerative disorders in which tau protein accumulates as a consequence of alterations in its metabolism. At least three different types of alterations have been described; in some cases, an aberrant mRNA splicing of tau exon 10 occurs; in other cases, the disorder is a consequence of missense mutations and, in most cases, aberrant tau hyperphosphorylation takes place. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) has emerged as a key kinase that is able to interact with several proteins involved in the ethiology of Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies. Here, we have evaluated whether GSK-3 is also able to modulate tau-mRNA splicing. Our data demonstrate that GSK-3 inhibition in cultured neurons affects tau splicing resulting in an increase in tau mRNA containing exon 10. Pre-mRNA splicing is catalyzed by a multimolecular complex including members of the serine/arginine-rich (SR) family of splicing factors. Immunofluorescence studies showed that after GSK-3 inhibition, SC35, a member of the SR family, is redistributed and enriched in nuclear speckles and colocalizes with the kinase. Furthermore, immunoprecipitated SC35 is phosphorylated by recombinant GSK-3β. Phosphorylation of a peptide from the SR domain by GSK-3 revealed that the peptide needs to be prephosphorylated, suggesting the involvement of a priming kinase. Our results demonstrate that GSK-3 plays a crucial role in tau exon 10 splicing, raising the possibility that GSK3 could contribute to tauopathies via aberrant tau splicing.

Tau is a brain microtubule-associated protein that promotes microtubule stability (1Drubin D.G. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2739-2746Google Scholar, 2Caceres A. Kosik K.S.

Tau plays a key role in the morphogenesis of neurons, and to a lesser extent, the morphogenesis of glial cells, where it is also present at low levels (3Schoenfeld T.A. Obar R.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1994; 151: 67-137Google Scholar). The human tau gene contains 16 exons from which different tau isoforms are generated by alternative splicing (4Andreadis A. Brown W.M. Kosik K.S.

The presence of exon 10 results in tau with four repeat microtubule-binding sequences (4R), whereas the alternatively spliced isoforms without exon 10 have only three of these sequences (3R).A group of neurodegenerative disorders is referred to as tauopathies because tau protein is assembled into aberrant aggregates in the brains of affected individuals (11Buee L.

One of these tauopathies, frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism associated to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), 1The abbreviations used are: FTDP-17frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism associated to chromosome 17GSK-3glycogen synthase kinaseADAlzheimer's diseaseSRserine/arginine-richRTreverse transcriptionPBSphosphate-buffered salineDIVdays in vitro.1The abbreviations used are: FTDP-17frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism associated to chromosome 17GSK-3glycogen synthase kinaseADAlzheimer's diseaseSRserine/arginine-richRTreverse transcriptionPBSphosphate-buffered salineDIVdays in vitro. is an inherited dementia that occurs as a consequence of tau mutations in both coding and non-coding regions (12Hutton M.

Most exonic mutations are single amino acid substitutions that result in the reduced ability of tau to interact with microtubules (8Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Biochem. Soc.

Oostra B.A. Goedert M. van Duijn C.M. Heutink P. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 414-421Google Scholar). Thus, alteration in the tau 4R/tau 3R proportion of isoforms is sufficient to trigger neurodegeneration in frontotemporal dementia, and probably, this might also play a role in other neurodegenerative disorders such as progressive nuclear palsy or corticobasal degeneration, which are characterized by an increase in tau 4R isoforms (11Buee L. Bussiere T. Buee-Scherrer V. Delacourte A. Hof P.R. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2000; 33: 95-130Google Scholar). Thus, gaining insight to the regulation of alternative splicing of human tau exon 10 has been of critical interest (15D'Souza I. Schellenberg G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17700-17709Google Scholar, 22D'Souza I. Schellenberg G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26587-26599Google Scholar).RNA splicing is a complex mechanism wherein five different small nuclear ribonucleoproteins, components of the spliceosome, play a role together with other factors (23Lamond A.I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 493-501Google Scholar, 24Green M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 559-599Google Scholar). Among these other factors are a family of proteins called SR proteins because they contain an arginine- and serine-rich domain in their C-terminal portion that influences the selection of alternative splicing sites (25Fu X.D. Mayeda A. Maniatis T. Krainer A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11224-11228Google Scholar, 26Zahler A.M. Neugebauer K.M. Lane W.S. Roth M.B. Science. 1993; 260: 219-222Google Scholar).Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK-3) has emerged as a key kinase that is able to interact with many of the proteins involved in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common of tauopathies, as well as other tauopathies (27Grimes C.A. Jope R.S. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 391-426Google Scholar). GSK-3 is a serine/threonine kinase originally identified due to its role in glycogen metabolism regulation and which is most abundant in the central nervous system (28Woodgett J.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2431-2438Google Scholar). GSK-3β accumulates in the cytoplasm of AD pretangle neurons and in tau deposits in most tauopathies (29Ferrer I. Barrachina M. Puig B. Acta Neuropathol. (Berl.). 2002; 104: 583-591Google Scholar), and its distribution in brains staged for AD neurofibrillary changes is coincident with the sequence of development of these changes (30Shiurba R.A. Ishiguro K. Takahashi M. Sato K. Spooner E.T. Mercken M. Yoshida R. Wheelock T.R. Yanagawa H. Imahori K. Nixon R.A. Brain Res. 1996; 737: 119-132Google Scholar, 31Pei J.J. Braak E. Braak H. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Winblad B. Cowburn R.F. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 58: 1010-1019Google Scholar). GSK-3β has been shown to phosphorylate tau in most sites hyperphosphorylated in AD-tau in transfected cells (32Lovestone S. Reynolds C.H. Latimer D. Davis D.R. Anderton B.H. Gallo J.-M. Hanger D. Mulot S. Marquardt B. Stabel S. Woodgett J.R. Miller C.C.J. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 1077-1086Google Scholar). Overexpression of GSK-3β in the brain of conditional transgenic mice resulted in tau hyperphosphorylation and somatodendritic localization of tau (33Lucas J.J. Hernandez F. Gomez-Ramos P. Moran M.A. Hen R. Avila J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 27-39Google Scholar). Furthermore, β-amyloid toxicity has been shown to be mediated by an increase in GSK-3 activity (34Phiel C.J. Wilson C.A. Lee V.M. Klein P.S. Nature. 2003; 423: 435-439Google Scholar, 35Munoz-Montano J.R. Moreno F.J. Avila J. Diaz-Nido J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 183-188Google Scholar). All these data point toward GSK-3β as a key enzyme in regulating tau metabolism. Here, we have studied whether GSK-3 activity, apart from affecting tau phosphorylation, also affects the regulation of alternative splicing of tau exon 10, the other main alteration found in tau metabolism in neurodegenerative disorders.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies—The following antibodies were used: according to the residue numbering of the longest human tau isoform of 441 amino acids, antibody PHF-1 (a gift from Dr. Peter Davies) recognizes tau protein when serines 396 and 404 are phosphorylated. Sources of commercial antibodies were: anti-GSK-3β (Transduction Laboratories), anti-GSK-3α/β(pY279/216) (BioSource), anti-SC35 (Sigma), and anti-β-tubulin (Sigma).Primary Culture—Primary cultures of cortical neurons were prepared according to modifications of established procedures (36Martin-Aparicio E. Yamamoto A. Hernandez F. Hen R. Avila J. Lucas J.J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8772-8781Google Scholar). Briefly, pups were sacrificed at postnatal day 1. Cortical tissue was then dissected and dissociated individually from each pup with the papain dissociation system (Worthington Biochemical Corp.). Cortical neurons were maintained in neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1% B-27, 5% fetal calf serum, 0.5 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin and grown on 3 μg/ml laminin (Sigma) and 10 μg/ml poly-l-lysine-coated cover plates. The cells were incubated in 95% air, 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator at 37 °C.Immunofluorescence—After treatments, cell cultures were fixed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing paraformaldehyde (4%) for 30 min. After several washes with PBS, the cells were preincubated in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1% fetal calf serum for 30 min. After a brief wash with PBS, they were incubated for 1 h with primary antibodies at the following dilutions: anti-SC35 (1/100), anti-β-galactosidase (1/1000), anti-GSK-3β (1/50), anti-PHF-1 (1/100), anti-GSK-3α/β(pY279/216) (1/200). Cultures were extensively washed and then incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody, conjugated either with fluorescein isothiocyanate or with TexasRed (Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 45 min. For some experiments, TexasRed-phalloidin (Molecular Probes) was included with the secondary antibody to visualize F-actin. After washing, they were immediately mounted with Fluoromount. Immunofluorescence was performed using confocal scanning microscopy (Bio-Rad) coupled to a vertical microscopy Axioskop2 (Zeiss).In Vitro Kinase Assays—To immunoprecipitate SC35, 500 μg of cerebral cortex was incubated with 5 μg of mouse monoclonal anti-SC35 in immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.4 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Nonidet P-40) overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. Extracts were incubated with 5 μg of rabbit anti-mouse (Dako) for 2 h and then with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) for another additional 1 h at 4 °C. The immobilized immune complex was washed twice with immunoprecipitation lysis buffer and then resuspended in kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm Mg2Cl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 250 μm ATP, 20 mm LiCl, and 1 μm okadaic acid) to prephosphorylate with “cold” phosphate the sites phosphorylated by coimmunoprecipitated kinases different from GSK-3. The sample was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with shaking and then passed over a G-25 sizing column to remove ATP and LiCl. Afterward, the sample was phosphorylated in the same kinase buffer but with 10 μm ATP (1000 cpm/pmol of [γ-32P]ATP; Amersham Biosciences), and 0.1 μg/μl recombinant GSK-3β (Sigma). The samples were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C, and Laemmli sample buffer was added to stop the reaction. Samples were boiled for 5 min, and proteins were separated in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were vacuum-dried and autoradiographed. The phosphorylated bands were quantitated with a densitometer.A peptide corresponding to residues 180-197 of SC35 protein, SC35180-197 (RSRSRSRSRSRSPPPVSK), as well as a prephosphorylated form P-SC35180-197 (RSRSRSRSRS(P)RSPPPVS(P)K), were chemically synthesized by Neosystem S.A. (Strasbourg, France). The phosphorylation assay was carried out in a final volume of 50 μl at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm NaCl. Phosphorylation was initiated by 0.1 μg/μl recombinant GSK-3β and [γ-32P]ATP plus MgCl2 (50 μm (1 μCi of assay medium) and 10 mm, respectively, final concentrations). SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to stop the reaction, and samples were electrophoresed on a 15% SDS gel. The gels were vacuum-dried and autoradiographed. The phosphorylated bands were quantitated with a densitometer. The difference between the kinase activity in the presence or absence of 20 mm LiCl was considered to be a measure of GSK-3 protein kinase activity.Reverse Transcription of RNA and Polymerase Chain Reaction (RTPCR)—Exon 10 splicing was assayed by RT-PCR as reported previously (37Montejo de Garcini E. Corrochano L. Wischik C.M. Diaz Nido J. Correas I. Avila J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 299: 10-14Google Scholar). Total RNA from different primary cultures was prepared using the reagent TRIzol (Invitrogen) and following the supplier's protocol. Reverse transcription was performed using the First cDNA synthesis kit (Roche Applied Science) on 5 μg of RNA with oligo(dT) primers. PCR was performed with the oligonucleotides R1 (5′-GGCGAATTCGGATCCATGCCAGACCTGAAGAATG-3′) and R2 (5′-GGCCTGCAGTTACTCGCGGAAGGTCAGCTTGTG-3′). The amplifications were performed basically with the following protocol: 30 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. The PCR products were resolved on a 1.8% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Two populations of RNA (coding for tau proteins containing three or four tubulin-binding motifs) are detected. The exon 10- (tau 3R) and exon 10+ (tau 4R) products as amplified by RT-PCR are 301 and 401 bp, respectively. As a loading control, RT-PCR for hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase was performed for each sample. The used primers for murine hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase were 5′-CCTGGTTAAGCAGTACAGCC-3′ and 5′-TCAAGGGCATATCCAACAACA-3′. The amplification protocol was: 20 cycles with denaturation for 15 s at 95 °C, annealing for 30 s at 60 °C, and elongation for 1 min at 72 °C. Differences among groups were analyzed by Student's unpaired t test to determine significant differences between means.RESULTSGSK-3 Inhibition Results in Decreased Tau Exon 10 Alternative Splicing in Cortical Neurons—Alternative splicing of exon 10 was investigated in cultured cortical neurons. Similar to early postnatal brain development, there is a progression in the expression from 3R tau expression to both 4R tau and 3R tau in cortical cultured neurons (Fig. 1A). At the first day in vitro (DIV1), almost all the tau mRNA detected by RT-PCR (96 ± 3%) is exclusively the isoform 3R-tau (Fig. 1, A and B). At DIV3, a change in tau mRNA splicing takes place, and 4R isoforms can be detected by RT-PCR. More precisely, at DIV3, exon 10 is present in 15.9 ± 1.5% of total tau-RNA (Fig. 1, A and B). These studies demonstrate that the mechanism for the developmental regulation of the splicing of tau exon 10 is also present in cultured cortical neurons. We next studied the effect of incubation of neurons with the GSK-3 inhibitors lithium (35Munoz-Montano J.R. Moreno F.J. Avila J. Diaz-Nido J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 183-188Google Scholar, 38Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Google Scholar) and AR-A014418 (AR-18) (39Bhat R. Xue Y. Berg S. Hellberg S. Ormö M. Nilsson Y. Radesäter A.-C. Jerning E. Markgren P.-O. Borgegård T. Nylöf M. Giménez-Cassina A. Hernández F. Lucas J.J. Díaz-Nido J. Avila J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45937-45945Google Scholar) on the 3R and 4R proportion of tau isoforms. We first verified that 20 mm LiCl in the culture medium efficiently inhibited GSK-3 in the primary cultures. As shown in Fig. 1, C and D, tau phosphorylation at the GSK-3-dependent epitope recognized by antibody PHF-1 (40Otvos Jr., L. Feiner L. Lang E. Szendrei G.I. Goedert M. Lee V.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 39: 669-673Google Scholar, 41Cho J.H. Johnson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 187-193Google Scholar) was reduced to background levels. Lithium treatment was done in the presence of 10 mmmyo-inositol to avoid any effect of the inositol depletion caused by inositol monophosphatase inhibition (35Munoz-Montano J.R. Moreno F.J. Avila J. Diaz-Nido J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 183-188Google Scholar). The same analysis was carried out with 33 μm AR-18, a concentration that inhibits tau phosphorylation in tau transfected cells (39Bhat R. Xue Y. Berg S. Hellberg S. Ormö M. Nilsson Y. Radesäter A.-C. Jerning E. Markgren P.-O. Borgegård T. Nylöf M. Giménez-Cassina A. Hernández F. Lucas J.J. Díaz-Nido J. Avila J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45937-45945Google Scholar). We then analyzed whether the inhibition of GSK-3 by lithium and AR-18 treatments affects the expression of tau exon 10 at different culture times. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, RT-PCR analysis on RNA isolated from control-, lithium-, and AR-18-treated cultures showed that GSK-3 inhibition resulted in increased proportion of 4R isoforms. These data demonstrate that alternative splicing of exon 10 is regulated by GSK-3.The Nuclear Distribution of SC35 Is Sensitive to GSK-3 Activity—Pre-mRNA splicing is catalyzed by a multimolecular complex including members of the SR family of splicing factors. These splicing factors usually concentrate in nuclear speckles. Taking into account that one of the two exon splicing enhancers present within tau exon 10 consists of a potential SC35-binding element (22D'Souza I. Schellenberg G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26587-26599Google Scholar) and that GSK-3 activity affects tau pre-mRNA splicing, we analyzed the effects of GSK-3 inhibition on the subcellular localization of SC35. Cortical neurons in culture (DIV3) displayed a diffuse predominantly nucleoplasmic staining pattern for SC35 (Fig. 2A) as evidenced by confocal microscopy analysis. However, after GSK-3 inhibition with lithium, SC35 accumulates in nuclear speckles (Fig. 2B). A similar effect was observed with the more selective GSK-3 inhibitor AR-18 (Fig. 2C).Fig. 2SC35 nuclear localization. Cortical neurons were incubated for 12 h in the absence (A and D) or presence of 10 mm LiCl (B and E) or 33 μm AR-18 (C and F). Cultures were fixed at DIV3. The localization of SC35 was determined by indirect immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibody SC35 and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (green, A-C). Actin was labeled with TexasRed-phalloidin (red, D-F). Neurons were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Bar, 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)SC35 Is Phosphorylated by GSK-3β in Vitro—The effect of GSK-3 activity on SC35 localization raised the possibility that this SR protein might be a substrate for phosphorylation by GSK-3. We therefore tested the ability of GSK-3 to phosphorylate SC35. SC35 was immunoprecipitated from brain homogenates (Fig. 3A), and the immunoprecipitate was incubated with recombinant GSK-3β in the presence or absence of lithium as well as AR-18. After resolving the samples on SDS-PAGE and exposing them to autoradiography, we observed a significant increase in32P incorporation in SC35 (about 2.5-fold over control; Fig. 3, B and C). The radioactive incorporation was mediated by GSK-3β as it was inhibited by lithium chloride and the more selective inhibitor AR-18.Fig. 3GSK-3β phosphorylation of SC35 in an in vitro kinase assay. As shown in A, protein from total forebrain was incubated with (lane 1) or without (lane 2) mouse monoclonal anti-SC35 (dilution, 1/100). ECL detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) were used for immunodetection. Immunoprecipitated samples were then resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and tested with monoclonal anti-SC35 (1/100) antibody. As shown in B, immunoprecipitated SC35 protein was incubated in the absence or presence of purified GSK-3β plus [γ-32P]ATP as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The assay was done in the absence or presence of GSK-3β inhibitors (20 mm LiCl or 33 μm AR-18). The samples were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and exposed to autoradiography. C, quantitative data showing the increase in32P incorporation in immunoprecipitated SC35.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The motif (S/T)XXX(S/T) is a consensus site recognized by GSK-3, especially when it is phosphorylated in +4 S/T (42Frame S. Cohen P. Biondi R.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1321-1327Google Scholar). Such a motif is present in tandem in the N-terminal site of SC35 (Fig. 4), suggesting that it is the region phosphorylated by GSK-3β. A peptide corresponding to predicted phosphorylation sequences was synthesized (Fig. 4A, residues 180-197). Fig. 4, B and C, shows that unphosphorylated peptide is a poor substrate for the kinase. However, when the same experimental protocol was carried out with primed peptide, a strong incorporation of radioactivity that was inhibited by lithium was observed (Fig. 4, B and C). In fact, the P-SC35180-197 peptide is a substrate for the kinase as good as GSM peptide, a peptide from glycogen synthase that is widely used to study GSK-3 activity (43Ryves W.J. Fryer L. Dale T. Harwood A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 264: 124-127Google Scholar). The radioactivity incorporated in SR-18P peptide, in our experimental conditions, is 270 ± 50 cpm nmol-1 min-1, whereas the radioactivity incorporated in GSM peptide is 340 ± 35 cpm nmol-1 min-1.Fig. 4Domains and putative GSK-3 phosphorylation sites on SC35 protein. Phosphorylation by GSK-3β is shown. A, gray box, Arg/Ser-rich (RS domain); shaded box, Gly-rich (Hinge region); white box, RNA recognition motif. Underlined amino acids are putative GSK-3 phosphorylation sites. The SC35180-197 peptide is shown underline. Data from Swiss Protein Database accession number for SC35 from Mus musculus Q62093. As shown in B, GSK-3β phosphorylates a primed peptide (P-SC35180-197) to a significantly higher extent than unprimed peptide (SC35180-197). As a control, GSK-3β was incubated with a substrate as well recognized as GSM peptide (43Ryves W.J. Fryer L. Dale T. Harwood A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 264: 124-127Google Scholar). The effect of 20 mm LiCl in the assay is shown.

https://openalex.org/W2060790972,"From a study to understand the mechanism of covalent interaction between collagen types II and IX, we present experimental evidence for a previously unrecognized molecular site of cross-linking. The location relative to previously defined cross-linking sites predicts a specific manner of interaction and folding of collagen IX on the surface of nascent collagen II fibrils. The initial evidence came from Western blot analysis of type IX collagen extracted by pepsin from fetal human cartilage, which showed a molecular species that had properties indicating an adduct between the α1(II) chain and the C-terminal domain (COL1) of type IX collagen. A similar component was isolated from bovine cartilage in sufficient quantity to confirm this identity by N-terminal sequence analysis. Using an antibody that recognized the putative cross-linking sequence at the C terminus of the α1(IX) chain, cross-linked peptides were isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography from proteolytic digests of human cartilage collagen. They were characterized by immunochemistry, N-terminal sequence analysis, and mass spectrometry. The results establish a link between a lysine near the C terminus (in the NC1 domain) of α1(IX) and the known cross-linking lysine at residue 930 of the α1(II) triple helix. This cross-link is speculated to form early in the process of interaction between collagen IX molecules and collagen II polymers. A model of molecular folding and further cross-linking is predicted that can spatially accommodate the formation of all six known cross-linking interactions to the collagen IX molecule on a fibril surface. Of particular biological significance, this model can accommodate potential interfibrillar as well as intrafibrillar links between the collagen IX molecules themselves, so providing a mechanism whereby collagen IX could stabilize a collagen fibril network.

Collagen type IX is a member of the fibril-associated collagen with interrupted triple helix (FACIT) 1The abbreviations used are: FACIT, fibril-associated collagen with interrupted triple helix; COL1, COL2, etc., triple helical collagen domains; NC1, NC2, etc., non-triple helical domains; CB9,7, cyanogen bromide peptide; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; LC, liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; mAb, monoclonal antibody. family of collagen molecules, which share homologous domains and are all believed to function in the extracellular matrix in association with collagen fibril surfaces (1.Shaw L.M.

Chem. 2003; 278: 24521-24525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), always in co-existence with type II collagen. A special role for collagen IX in the organization of type II collagen fibril networks has apparently evolved, which for articular cartilage seems to be essential for the long term normal functioning of joints. The evidence for this comes from the study of genetic defects. Mutations in all three collagen IX genes have been linked to a chondrodysplasia syndrome (multiple epiphyseal dysplasia), which features early onset osteoarthritis (13.Chapman K.L. Briggs M.D. Mortier G.R. Pediatr. Pathol. Mol. Med. 2003; 22: 53-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). All three chains of the vertebrate collagen IX molecule, α1(IX), α2(IX), and α3(IX), contain intermolecular cross-linking sites, each with chain-specific properties (3.Wu J.J. Eyre D.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 123: 1033-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 4.Eyre D.R. Apon S. Wu J.J. Ericsson L.H. Walsh K.A.

J. 1996; 314: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). All the cross-links are of the lysyl oxidase-mediated type, formed from modified lysine residues between type IX and type II collagen molecules or between type IX collagen molecules. The first evidence for this was an observation that type IX collagen triple helical domains purified from pepsin digests of bovine articular cartilage contained pyridinoline cross-linking residues (3.Wu J.J. Eyre D.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 123: 1033-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The concentration was higher on a mole/mole basis than in type II collagen isolated from the same tissue. Further analysis showed that the most abundant cross-links in fetal cartilage were divalent keto-amines, the same intermediates found on the pathway to pyridinoline formation within collagen fibrils (6.Wu J.J. Woods P.E. Eyre D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23007-23014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the structures of cross-linked peptides isolated from type IX collagen showed one class that had derived from the reaction of a hydroxylysine aldehyde in the N-telopeptide of type II collagen to a hydroxylysine at the N terminus of the triple helical COL2 domain (4.Eyre D.R. Apon S. Wu J.J. Ericsson L.H. Walsh K.A. FEBS Lett. 1987; 220: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 5.van der Rest M. Mayne R. J. Biol.

All three chains, α1(IX), α2(IX), and α3(IX), were able to cross-link to the α1(II) N-telopeptide. In addition, the α1(II) C-telopeptide was similarly cross-linked to another site in the middle of the COL2 domain but only to α3(IX) (4.Eyre D.R. Apon S. Wu J.J. Ericsson L.H. Walsh K.A. FEBS Lett. 1987; 220: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 6.Wu J.J. Woods P.E. Eyre D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23007-23014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Diab M. Wu J.J. Eyre D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Studies on fetal human cartilage showed this same pattern of collagen IX cross-linking as in bovine cartilage (7.Diab M. Wu J.J. Eyre D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). From both human and bovine tissues, cross-linked peptides were also identified that had originated from an interaction between two type IX collagen molecules and in yields that indicated about an equal prominence as for IX-to-II linkages (6.Wu J.J. Woods P.E. Eyre D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23007-23014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Diab M. Wu J.J. Eyre D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The IX-to-IX cross-links were from the NC1 domain (C terminus) of α3(IX) to the same COL2 site (in α1(IX) or α3(IX)) to which the α1(II) N-telopeptide could link. Of all the cross-linked peptides isolated from collagen IX, only two had properties that showed an origin from a lysyl oxidase-generated aldehyde in the type IX collagen molecule itself. These peptides had linked α3(IX)NC1 to a site in α1(IX) or α3(IX)COL2. All others were apparently based on precursor hydroxylysine aldehydes in α1(II)N- or C-telopeptides. From transmission electron microscopy we know that type IX collagen molecules physically decorate the surface of type II collagen fibrils in developing cartilage (14.Vaughan L. Mendler M. Huber S. Bruckner P. Winterhalter K.H. Irwin M.I. Mayne R. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 991-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) and are most concentrated on the thinnest fibrils (15.Hagg R. Bruckner P. Hedbom E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) that form the network or basket around chondrocytes (16.Poole C.A. Gilbert R.T. Herbage D. Hartmann D.J. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 1997; 5: 191-204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). From the yield of cross-linked peptides we know that most of the collagen IX molecules in cartilage, even in fetal tissue, occur in covalent linkage to type II collagen fibrils (6.Wu J.J. Woods P.E. Eyre D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23007-23014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Diab M. Wu J.J. Eyre D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The lack of extractability of collagen IX in protein denaturants confirms this. The relative yields of the different cross-linked peptides also predict that most collagen IX molecules are also linked to each other. These various observations make it challenging to present a molecular model that can explain how, in a network of fine collagen fibrils coated with collagen IX molecules, IX-to-IX molecular links can be so abundant when the opportunity for fibril-to-fibril surface interactions would seem to be relatively limited. Any viable molecular model of heterofibril assembly needs, however, to accommodate the cross-linking stoichiometry. Here we provide evidence for an additional, major site of interaction between types II and IX collagens that further constrains how the molecules can be organized but from its position suggests how the collagen IX molecules are folded on the surface of the collagen II polymer to accommodate all the cross-links. Preparation of Human Collagen Samples—Ribs, knees, and hip were harvested and minced from 94- to 98-day-old human fetuses (Central Laboratory for Human Embryology, University of Washington). The minced tissue samples were extracted in 4 m guanidine HCl, 0.05 m Tris, pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitors (2 mm EDTA, 5 mm benzamidine, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm phenanthroline) at 4 °C for 48 h to remove proteoglycans and non-cross-linked proteins. The tissue residue was washed with water, suspended in 3% acetic acid, and digested with pepsin using a ratio of 1:50 (w/w) (pepsin:wet tissue) for 24 h at 4 °C. Pepstatin was added to stop the reaction, and the digest was centrifuged to remove insoluble tissue. The solubilized collagen was then precipitated with 2.2 m NaCl to remove most of the pepsin. After precipitation, the collagen was resuspended in 3% acetic acid, dialyzed, freeze-dried, and then digested with CNBr in 70% formic acid under N2 for 24 h at room temperature. The CNBr digest was freeze-dried. Column Chromatography—Monoclonal antibody 2B4 was used to prepare an affinity column. This mouse antibody was originally prepared to recognize a proteolytic cleavage product in the C-telopeptide domain of type II collagen as a neoepitope (17.Atley L.M. Shao P. Shaffer K. Eyre D.R. Trans. Orthop. Res. Soc. 1998; 23 (Abstr.): 850Google Scholar). The recognized epitope is at the C terminus of the sequence EKGPDP in which a C-terminal proline is essential for antibody binding. Proteolysis of collagen II is required at this peptide bond, and the cleavage methods used in the present study (pepsin, CNBr, and bacterial collagenase) do not generate this epitope from type II collagen (17.Atley L.M. Shao P. Shaffer K. Eyre D.R. Trans. Orthop. Res. Soc. 1998; 23 (Abstr.): 850Google Scholar). The natural C terminus of the human α1(IX) chain ends in a similar sequence, NKGPDP (National Center for Biotechnology Information accession number gi 3510535) to which 2B4 also binds (see “Results”). 2D. R. Eyre, T. Pietka, M. A. Weis, and J.-J. Wu, unpublished observations. Purified monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2B4 was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) and packed into a 1.0 × 10.0-cm column (Bio-Rad). Freeze-dried CNBr digests of fetal human cartilage were reconstituted in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, and passed through the mAb 2B4 affinity column under gravity. The column was sequentially washed with 25 mm Hepes, 125 mm NaCl, pH 7.2, and 25 mm Hepes, 125 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.2. Three pools, 1) the pass-through, 2) the combined washings, and 3) the bound fraction, were assayed by SDS-PAGE. The bound peptides were eluted with 100 mm glycine, 100 mm NaCl, pH 2.5. Eluted peptides were freeze-dried and resolved by reverse-phase HPLC (C8 column, Brownlee Aquapore RP-300, 4.6 mm × 25 cm) using a linear gradient (0–35%) of acetonitrile:n-propyl alcohol (3:1, v/v) in aqueous 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The reverse-phase HPLC fractions were assayed by SDS-PAGE and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Gel Electrophoresis and Electroblotting—Collagen digests, affinity column pools, and reverse-phase HPLC column fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using the method of Laemmli (18.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207516) Google Scholar). For N-terminal microsequencing, peptide bands were transblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Sequi-Blot, Bio-Rad) using a MilliBlot-SED electroblotting apparatus. For Western blot analysis, peptide bands were transblotted to another polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Westran, Schleicher & Schuell). Western Blot Analysis—Transblotted membranes were incubated with monoclonal antibodies 2B4 and 1C10. 1C10 recognizes a sequence-specific epitope (GFTGLQGLP, residues 933–941 of the α1(II) helical domain) in denatured α1(II)CB9,7 (19.Ellsworth J.L.

Following incubation with the primary antibodies, Biotin-SP-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) was applied followed by incubation with ExtrAvidin®-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma). The Western blots were developed using bromochloroindolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium. Bacterial Collagenase Digestion—Freeze-dried, pepsin-solubilized, 2.2 m NaCl-precipitated human fetal cartilage collagen was reconstituted in 50 mm Hepes with 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.2, at a concentration of 3 mg/ml. The sample was heated for 15 min at 60 °C to denature the collagen and then cooled to 37 °C. High purity bacterial collagenase (Sigma) was added at a ratio of 1:500 (enzyme:collagen), and the digest was incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. Phenanthroline was added to a final concentration of 5 mm to stop the reaction. The target cross-linked peptide was then affinity-purified on the 2B4 column as described above for the CNBr peptide, run on the reverse-phase HPLC C8-column described earlier, and monitored for 2B4 reactivity by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Fractions containing 2B4 immunoreactivity were analyzed by LC/MS. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Reverse-phase HPLC fractions were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (1:10, v/v) and coated on polystyrene microtiter plates (Nunc MaxiSorp). After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin (w/v) in Tris-buffered saline (0.15 m NaCl, 0.02 m Tris, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.5), plates were incubated with either 2B4 or 1C10 followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) to detect bound primary antibodies. Plates were washed with 0.15 m NaCl containing 0.05% Tween 20 (v/v) between each step. Color was developed using 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine dihydrochloride, and absorbance was measured at 450 nm using either a Titertek Multiskan-plus plate reader or a Bio-Tek ELx800 plate reader. N-terminal Sequence Analysis—Peptides were subjected to N-terminal sequencing on a Porton 2090E gas phase sequencer equipped with online HPLC analysis of phenylthiohydantoin derivatives. Mass Spectrometry—Stained (Coomassie Blue G-250) protein bands excised from SDS-polyacrylamide gels were subjected to tandem mass spectrometric analysis after in-gel digestion with endoproteinase Asp-N or trypsin using an established procedure for in-gel protease digestion (20.Kinter M. Sherman N.E. Desiderio D.M. Nibbering N.M.M. Protein Sequencing and Identification Using Tandem Mass Spectrometry. John Wiley & Sons, New York2000: 153-160Google Scholar). Recovered peptides were analyzed by nanobore LQ (Vydac C8 MS 0.3 mm × 15 cm) with on-line electrospray sample introduction into an ion-trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan LCQ Deca XP). Tandem spectra were analyzed by Sequest software to identify peptides searching against a National Center for Biotechnology Information-derived data base of collagen genes (21.Eng J.K. Ashley L. McCormack A.L. Yates III, J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5471) Google Scholar) to identify tryptic and endoproteinase Asp-N linear sequences. The cross-linked peptide recovered by 2B4 affinity from a bacterial collagenase digest of pepsin-solubilized fetal cartilage collagen (see above) was located by screening the MS data from the LC/MS profile for appropriate mass ranges and fragmentation (MS/MS) patterns. Immunohistochemistry—10-μm-thick frozen sections from 16.7-week human fetal femoral head and adult (25-year-old) human articular cartilage (from femoral head) (Northwest Tissue Center) were fixed in ice-cold acetone for 5 min and treated with 2 mg/ml porcine testicular hyaluronidase (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5, at 37 °C for 30 min. The sections were probed with mAb 2B4 (1:1000 dilution of 1.1 mg/ml) using biotin-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody and developed using the Vectastain Elite ABC and VIP substrate kits (Vector Laboratories). The staining pattern of the tissue was documented with a Nikon Micro photomicroscope equipped with a Photometrics Sensys CCD digital camera. mAb 2B4, which was prepared against the type II collagen C-telopeptide domain, recognizes the cleaved C terminus of the sequence EKGPDP (17.Atley L.M. Shao P. Shaffer K. Eyre D.R. Trans. Orthop. Res. Soc. 1998; 23 (Abstr.): 850Google Scholar). It also binds with a high affinity to a similar sequence encoded by COL9A1 (National Center for Biotechnology Information accession number gi 3510535, Ref. 22.Pihlajamaa T. Vuoristo M.M. Annunen S. Perala M. Prockop D.J. Ala-Kokko L. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) that occurs at the C terminus of the chain (NKGPDP). Thus, using mAb 2B4 for Western blot analyses of collagen preparations from human cartilage enriched in type IX collagen, the anticipated selective binding to the intact α1(IX) chain and to cross-linked peptide fragments of it was confirmed. Fig. 1 shows 2B4 binding to intact α1(IX) chains in a 4 m guanidine HCl extract of human fetal cartilage (Fig. 1a) and to components of the pepsin-solubilized collagen from the same tissue (Fig. 1b). In Fig. 1b the mobilities of the two strongly immunoreactive bands running above the α1(II) chain, one before and the other shifted lower after disulfide cleavage, had properties suggesting an interaction product between the disulfide-bonded COL1 trimer from type IX collagen and the α1(II) chain. On a duplicate gel/Western using another antibody, 1C10, which is specific for an epitope in the α1(II) chain (see “Experimental Procedures”), the presence of α1(II) in the 2B4 immunoreactive bands was confirmed (data not shown). Fig. 2 shows that fetal cartilage matrix reacts strongly with mAb 2B4, whereas adult cartilage does not.Fig. 2Immunohistochemical comparison of fetal and adult human cartilage using the 2B4 antibody. Frozen sections of fetal cartilage (a) showed a much stronger, uniform staining of extracellular matrix compared with adult articular cartilage (b), consistent with the known 10-fold higher content of type IX collagen in fetal cartilage. Collagen IX in adult tissue is also seen to be most concentrated pericellularly.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm this molecular identification by sequence analysis, a large batch of pepsin-solubilized collagen was prepared from fetal bovine cartilage. A similar minor band, which shifted to lower molecular weight on reduction, was detected in a Coomassie Blue-stained gel, and a fraction containing this material was enriched by molecular sieve chromatography (Fig. 3). Sequence analysis of the N termini of the excised, reduced bands gave two running sequences, one matching the N terminus of the α1(II) chain generated by pepsin (23.Wu J.J. Lark M.W. Chun L.E. Eyre D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5625-5628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the other matching a sequence at the N terminus of the COL1 domain of α1(IX). Having established cross-linking between the COL1/NC1 domain of type IX collagen and an α1(II) chain, we then sought the exact sites of interaction. We used human cartilage for these experiments; 2B4 does not recognize the bovine α1(IX) chain, which presumably differs in sequence at the C terminus from human α1(IX) NC1. 4J.-J. Wu and D. R. Eyre, unpublished data.Fig. 4 shows Western blots of CNBr digests of cartilage matrix (Fig. 4a) and of pepsin-extracted collagen after immunopurification on a 2B4 affinity column (Fig. 4b). The main product from the immunopurified pool ran slightly slower than uncross-linked CB9,7. This mobility is consistent with a cross-link between the α1(IX)NC1 domain (bearing the 2B4 epitope) and α1(II)CB9,7. The COL9A1 sequence encodes a methionine that would be cleaved by CNBr to release a short C-terminal peptide, QAGQRAFNKGPDP, containing the putative cross-linking lysine and the 2B4 epitope (22.Pihlajamaa T. Vuoristo M.M. Annunen S. Perala M. Prockop D.J. Ala-Kokko L. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A mAb 2B4 immunoaffinity column was used to enrich and purify the cross-linked NC1 to the CB9,7 fragment for sequence analysis. Fig. 5a shows the elution profile of the resulting affinity-purified material on reverse-phase HPLC monitored by 220 nm absorbance and pyridinoline fluorescence. Fig. 5, b and c, show Western blot analyses across the fractions using mAbs 1C10 (CB9,7 helical sequence specificity) and 2B4. The results are consistent with a cross-link from α1(IX)NC1 to a site in CB9,7. To confirm this, the remainder of fractions 47–52 was pooled, run on SDS-PAGE, and transblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the Coomassie Blue-positive band corresponding to the 2B4 immunoreactive band was subjected to N-terminal sequence analysis. Essentially two running sequences were observed as shown. One is from the N terminus of α1(II)CB9,7 (GPSGPAGARGIQGPQGPR). The second is from the pepsin-generated NC1 fragment with evidence of two cleavage products, the main version, AGQRAFN, and a lesser form beginning FN. Immunopurification from a CNBr digest of total fetal cartilage collagen (guanidine HCl-insoluble tissue) gave similar results except that the NC1 domain had the N-terminal sequence QAGQRAFN, the product of CNBr cleavage, rather than the two products (minus Q and minus QAGQRA) from pepsin-solubilized collagen. The 2B4 affinity-purified CB fragments were excised from SDS-PAGE and analyzed by in-line HPLC/ion-trap mass spectrometry (LC/MS) after endoproteinase Asp-N or trypsin digestion (data not shown). The results of this peptide analysis confirmed the identity of CB9,7, but the cross-linked peptide itself was not identified in the MS profile of the LC eluent. Final identification of the two lysine residues involved in the divalent cross-link was confirmed by digesting a pool of pepsinsolubilized type II collagen from fetal human cartilage with bacterial collagenase and using the 2B4 affinity column to isolate the α1(IX)NC1-containing peptide. The peptide fraction was analyzed by nanobore HPLC/electrospray mass spectrometry. Fig. 6 summarizes the results of this analysis, which identifies the basic composition of the two peptides cross-linked through their lysine residues. The MS results showed the presence of two forms of essentially the same cross-linked peptide that differed in mass of the cross-linking residue by two water molecules. One form matches the mass of the open chain ketoamine cross-link, hydroxylysino-ketonorleucine. The other, minus 37 mass units, equal to two water molecules and an additional proton, would fit the pyrrole structure shown (Fig. 6d), but other condensed structures are possible to explain this mass difference. The Western blot results in Fig. 1a establish the specificity of mAb 2B4 for the human α1(IX) chain and lack of recognition of intact α1(II) chains from the same cartilage extract. These and other observations indicate binding of 2B4 to the expressed natural C terminus of the α1(IX) chain but not to the same pentapeptide cross-linking sequence (KGPDP) in the α1(II) C-telopeptide domain. The latter is recognized only after it becomes C-terminal through proteolysis, for example through degradation by matrix metalloproteinases as has been reported (17.Atley L.M. Shao P. Shaffer K. Eyre D.R. Trans. Orthop. Res. Soc. 1998; 23 (Abstr.): 850Google Scholar). This specificity was important to establish since 2B4 was raised to recognize the proteolytic neoepitope in degradation products of type II collagen (17.Atley L.M. Shao P. Shaffer K. Eyre D.R. Trans. Orthop. Res. Soc. 1998; 23 (Abstr.): 850Google Scholar), potentially explaining the novel immunoreactive bands in Fig. 1b. It seemed more likely, therefore, that α1(IX)NC1 was responsible for 2B4 binding to these components from fetal cartilage. Adult human cartilage did not reveal such bands or significant immunoreactivity of α1(II) chains when similarly analyzed (not shown). The results of Fig. 2 further support this specificity with a lack of significant staining of adult cartilage when 2B4 was used for immunohistochemistry on frozen sections, whereas fetal cartilage stained strongly throughout the matrix. These findings indicate that 2B4 binds to a native epitope in type IX collagen but not in undegraded type II collagen and are consistent with the much higher content and uniform distribution of type IX collagen in fetal cartilage matrix (10% of total collagen) compared with adult cartilages (1% or less of total collagen (6.Wu J.J. Woods P.E. Eyre D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23007-23014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Eyre D.R. Wu J.-J. Niyibizi C. Cohn D.V. Glorieaux F.H. Martin T.J. Calcium Regulation and Bone Metabolism. Elsevier Science Publishers, New York1990: 188-194Google Scholar)). The recovery of a similar pool of II-to-IX cross-linked chains from fetal bovine cartilage (Fig. 3) shows that this property is not restricted to human fetal tissue, and the sequencing results confirmed the component identities suspected from SDS-PAGE mobility and Western blotting. The predicted molecular identity was of an α1(IX)COL1 domain with its NC1 sequence still attached to which an α1(II) chain was cross-linked. Incomplete cleavage of the NC1 domain by pepsin would explain the 2B4 immunoreactivity of both the minor molecular species (α1(II) chains cross-linked to NC1 with COL1 still attached) and α1(II) chains (those having a cleaved NC1 domain cross-linked to them). The latter short sequence would not significantly alter the mobility of α1(II) on SDS-PAGE, being of similar length to the pepsin-cleaved α1(II) telopeptides. This conclusion was confirmed by the results of analysis of CNBr peptides before and after immunoaffinity purification (Figs. 4 and 5). The lack of significant fluorescence in the cross-linked peptide (Fig. 5), the N-terminal sequencing results, and the mass spectral data (Fig. 6) taken together identify the site of cross-linking between two lysines and the cross-link as a divalent keto-amine with no evidence of pyridinoline (trivalent) cross-link formation at this locus from α1(IX)NC1. The pyridinoline cross-links found in type IX collagen were all formed between collagen II telopeptides and the COL2 domain (4.Eyre D.R. Apon S. Wu J.J. Ericsson L.H. Walsh K.A. FEBS Lett. 1987; 220: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). These results establish a major, previously unrecognized site of intermolecular cross-linking between types IX and II collagen molecules in cartilage. Compared with known cross-linking sites in type IX collagen (4.Eyre D.R. Apon S. Wu J.J. Ericsson L.H. Walsh K.A. FEBS Lett. 1987; 220: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 5.van der Rest M. Mayne R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1615-1618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Wu J.J.

J. 1996; 314: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) defined sites of linkage from type II collagen telopeptides to the triple helical COL2 domain of type IX collagen. Based on evidence that COL1, the triple helical domain most conserved in sequence across all FACIT collagen family members (25.Fitzgerald J. Bateman J.F. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 26.Gordon M.K. Gerecke D.R. Dublet B. van der Rest M. Olsen B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19772-19778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), together with the NC1 domain and its conserved cysteine pair is physically responsible for the interaction of collagen IX molecules with fibril surfaces (26.Gordon M.K. Gerecke D.R. Dublet B. van der Rest M. Olsen B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19772-19778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we speculate that the identified covalent bond from α1(IX)NC1 to type II collagen is the first cross-link to form (both in the interaction pathway and in evolutionary terms). This is shown in a molecular model of the proposed interaction and packing of collagen IX molecules on the collagen II fibril surface (Fig. 7) that best fits the spatial distribution of all the sites of covalent cross-linking. It is similar to one of a series of models proposed by Miles et al. (27.Miles C.A. Knott L. Sumner I.G. Bailey A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) on theoretical grounds and before the current NC1 link to type II collagen was identified. In it, the COL1 domain folds back through NC2 so that it lies antiparallel to the COL2 domain. This arrangement gives the correct linear distances and the required antiparallel relationship between COL2 and the type II helix to accommodate both the new cross-link and those reported earlier (4.Eyre D.R. Apon S. Wu J.J. Ericsson L.H. Walsh K.A. FEBS Lett. 1987; 220: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 6.Wu J.J. Woods P.E. Eyre D.R. J. Biol.

Particularly notable is the correct linear juxtaposition of collagen IX molecules on the fibril relative to each other (staggered axially by D (67 nm) the distance by which collagen molecules are staggered in banded fibrils) to allow IX-to-IX intermolecular cross-links to form between α3(IX)NC1 and the COL2 N terminus. The previously reported interaction sites for α3(IX)NC1 on COL2 are in α1(IX) and α3(IX) (6.Wu J.J. Woods P.E. Eyre D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23007-23014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Diab M. Wu J.J. Eyre D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 28.Ichimura S. Wu J.J. Eyre D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 378: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The abundance of IX-to-IX cross-links can be explained, therefore, by an interaction of adjacent type IX collagen molecules along the fibril surface. The periodicity of collagen II molecules acts as a template for this interaction. As shown (Fig. 7) the model also has the potential to allow interfibrillar links between collagen IX molecules when the opportunity arises between intersecting nascent fibrils coated with collagen IX molecules. Proving the existence of such interfibrillar bonds will be a challenge, but immunoelectron microscopic observations have previously been interpreted as showing evidence for focal concentrations of collagen IX at sites of fibril intersection in the matrix of developing cartilage (29.Muller-Glauser W. Humbel B. Glatt M. Strauli P. Winterhalter K.H. Bruckner P. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1931-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) as well as a periodic distribution along thin fibrils (14.Vaughan L. Mendler M. Huber S. Bruckner P. Winterhalter K.H. Irwin M.I. Mayne R. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 991-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Each chain of the vertebrate collagen IX molecule has evolved its own distinctive pattern of cross-linking interactions in the collagen heteropolymer. The α1(IX) chain (COL9A1) is probably the ancestral form. Deletion of this gene in mice produced a functional knock-out of collagen IX protein despite normal expression of COL9A2 and COL9A3 mRNA (30.Hagg R. Hedbom E. Mollers U. Aszodi A. Fassler R. Bruckner P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20650-20654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). There is also evidence for a homologue of α1(IX) in a basal chordate (31.Vizzini A. Arizza V. Cervello M. Cammarata M. Gambino R. Parrinello N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1577: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It seems likely that α2(IX) (COL9A2) and α3(IX) (COL9A3) in higher vertebrates are the result of gene duplications and subsequent mutations that have added and altered functional cross-linking properties. With regard to the cross-link to type II collagen based on α1(IX)NC1 identified here, it is notable that the α3(IX)NC1 sequence was shown to be cross-linked exclusively to the COL2 domain of a second type IX molecule (6.Wu J.J. Woods P.E. Eyre D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23007-23014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Is this an evolved function from that of ancestral α1(IX)NC1? We do not know, but we do have preliminary evidence that a lysine residue in α2(IX)NC1 also can link to type II collagen at the Lys-930 locus. 5J.-J. Wu, unpublished observations. If so, the NC1 domains of all three gene products have retained a cross-linking function. Using synthetic peptides, it was previously shown that the NC1 domain sequences and the C-terminal portion of COL1 contain all the information needed for heterotrimer formation (32.Mechling D.E. Gambee J.E. Morris N.P. Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Mayne R. Bachinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13781-13785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Clearly collagen IX has evolved to be a highly specialized covalent adapter of polymeric collagen type II fibrillar networks in cartilages and certain other tissues of higher vertebrates. During avian corneal development, selective proteolysis of collagen IX has been observed coincident with matrix swelling (33.Fitch J. Fini M.E. Beebe D.C. Linsenmayer T.F. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 212: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism for the swelling of cartilage collagen after joint injury is suspected, and stromelysin-1 (matrix metalloproteinase-3), a candidate protease, is known to cleave at a specific site in all three chains of the NC2 domain of type IX collagen (23.Wu J.J.

Snake venoms are an attractive source of molecules that have unique biological activities. VEGF homologous potent hypotensive factor (HF) was isolated from Vipera aspis aspis (Aspic viper) venom (20Komori Y. Nikai T. Taniguchi K. Masuda K. Sugihara H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11796-11803Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It has been reported that HF induces dramatic hypotension compared with VEGF165 and other growth factors (20Komori Y. Nikai T. Taniguchi K. Masuda K. Sugihara H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11796-11803Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), but the detailed characterization of its potent activity remains to be resolved. Toxin Purification—Vammin was purified by five successive chromatographic steps as follows: 200 mg of Vipera ammodytes ammodytes venom (Sigma) was dissolved in 2 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The venom sample was applied onto a Superdex 200pg gel-filtration chromatography column in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Fractions containing vammin were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using anti-HF antiserum and loaded onto a Hi-Trap™ heparin HP column using the same buffer. The column was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The vammin fractions were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and applied to a Q-Sepharose HP column. The flow-through fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm imidazole HCl at pH 6.0 before loading onto a SP-Sepharose HP column. The column was separated by a linear NaCl gradient at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Finally, the vammin-containing fraction was purified with a Mono S column. For the purification of VR-1 and HF, a similar isolation method to that for vammin was employed. Measurement of Hypotensive Effect of Toxins—These are provided in Supplementary Fig. 1. Here we isolated two anti-HF antiserum reactive proteins, vammin and VR-1, from the venoms of Vipera ammodytes ammodytes (Western sand viper) and Daboia russelli russelli (also known as Russell's viper), respectively. The primary structures of vammin and VR-1 were determined by peptide sequencing. The pyrrolidone ring was opened by methanolysis because N-terminal residues of both intact proteins were blocked by a pyroglutamyl residue. Each chain of vammin comprised a total of 110 amino acid residues, while the number of residues in each chain of VR-1 was 109. As expected, the primary structure of vammin and VR-1 shared identity with members of the VEGF family, and the cysteine knot motif, a characteristic of the VEGF family proteins, was completely conserved (Fig. 1). The sequence identities with human VEGF165 were 47.6 and 48.1%, respectively (Fig. 1). Calculated molecular weights were 25,129 and 25,093 for vammin and VR-1, respectively, as homodimers (Fig. 1). In vitro studies reveal VEGF165 to be a potent and specific mitogen for vascular endothelial cells (3Ferrara N. Henzel W.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 161: 851-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar, 4Plouet J. Schilling J. Gospodarowicz D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3801-3806Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 5Conn G.

We analyzed the growth factor activity of snake venom VEGFs on cultured vascular endothelial cells and found that they could stimulate endothelial proliferation with an EC50 of ∼100 pm, as well as that of VEGF165 (EC50 of ∼70 pm) (Fig. 2a). It is interesting to note that there is a marked difference on the maximal growth level between snake venom VEGFs and VEGF165. VEGF165 induced endothelial proliferation at a level of 190.1 ± 16.1% compared with the control, while vammin induced endothelial proliferation at a higher level of 265.9 ± 17.8% compared with the control (Fig. 2a). These data strongly suggest that snake venom VEGFs stimulate endothelial proliferation through a distinct mechanism from VEGF165. Next we examined the potent effects of snake venom VEGFs in vivo. Intravascular administration of vammin (0.3 μg/g) resulted in very rapid and drastic hypotension (Fig. 2b). Hypotension reached a maximal level within 3–5 min (Fig. 2b) and was clearly dose-dependent (Fig. 2c). Injection of 30 ng/g vammin induced significant hypotension, and the maximal effect was observed at 0.3 μg/g administration (Fig. 2c). The dose-response curve shows a more distinct hypotensive effect for diastolic blood pressure (DBP) than systolic blood pressure (SBP) (Fig. 2c). EC50 values for DBP and SBP were 24 and 29 ng/g, respectively. VR-1 also induced dramatic hypotension, as with HF (see Supplemental Data). EC50 values for VR-1 and HF were 10 and 15 ng/g on DBP and 15 and 18 ng/g on SBP, respectively. The maximal decreases in blood pressures were 56.0 ± 6.8% in DBP and 24.7 ± 5.2% in SBP for vammin (n = 3), 48.4 ± 1.7% and 16.7 ± 1.1% for VR-1 (n = 3), and 52.0 ± 1.9% and 24 ± 5.9% for HF (n = 3), showing that the three toxin proteins essentially possessed an equally efficacious effect on blood pressures, although VR-1 was slightly less than the others. In contrast, VEGF165 induced only a slight decrease in blood pressure (83.5 ± 3.9% decrease in mean arterial pressure compared with 60.6 ± 4.1% in vammin, Fig. 2d), indicating snake venom VEGFs exhibit stronger activity than VEGF165 even in vivo, which is similar to growth factor activity in vitro. Next we attempted to determine the pathway responsible for inducing hypotension. Snake venom VEGFs appear to affect peripheral blood vessels, for example, via a nitric oxide (NO)-mediated effect because of the rapid and preferential effect on DBP. Pretreatment with Nω-nitro-l-arginine (l-NNA), a NO synthase inhibitor, completely blocked toxin protein-induced hypotension but pretreatment with phenylephrine, an α-adrenoreceptor agonist, did not (Fig. 2e). These data strongly indicate that snake venom VEGF-induced hypotension is probably mediated by NO. Recent studies revealed that human VEGF165-mediated hypotension is endothelium-dependent and that VEGF165 stimulates NO production via at least three different pathways in vascular endothelial cells: 1) up-regulation of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) protein level over ∼12 h to 4 days via protein kinase C (PKC) activation (21Hood J.D. Meininger C.J. Ziche M. Granger H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H1054-H1058PubMed Google Scholar, 22Shen B.Q. Lee D.Y. Zioncheck T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33057-33063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), 2) transient activation of eNOS by Ca2+/calmodulin upon intracellular Ca2+ release (23Gelinas D.S. Bernatchez P.N. Rollin S. Bazan N.G. Sirois M.G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 137: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and 3) enhancement of eNOS activity by phosphorylation of serine 1177 over ∼30 min (24Michell B.J. Chen Z. Tiganis T. Stapleton D. Katsis F. Power D.A. Sim A.T. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17625-17628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Hypotension induced by snake venom proteins was very rapid and sustained for at least ∼30 min (Fig. 2b). Therefore, we next sought to determine whether the pathway of eNOS activation is involved in the phosphorylation of eNOS on serine 1177 by immunoblot analysis using phosphoserine 1177-specific antibody on cultured vascular endothelial cells. Vammin exposure (1 nm) stimulated eNOS phosphorylation of serine 1177, and the time course exhibited a maximal effect at 5 min and returned to basal levels within 60 min (Fig. 2f). These data indicated that snake venom VEGFs produce nitric oxide via activation of eNOS by phosphorylation of serine 1177, similar to VEGF165, despite their strong hypotensive activity. To obtain a detailed biochemical characterization of potent activity of snake venom VEGFs, we performed receptor-ligand binding experiments using surface plasmon resonance assay. As shown in Fig. 3a, human VEGF165 associated with the two immobilized VEGF receptors, Flt-1-IgG and KDR-IgG, with high affinity in a rapid and time-dependent manner. The calculated association (ka) and dissociation (kdiss) rate constants and dissociation constants (Kd) were similar to previous reports (Table I). Vammin also exhibited a high affinity of binding to immobilized KDR with a Kd of 4.11 × 10-10m (Fig. 3b) but no affinity of binding to immobilized Flt-1 (Fig. 3a). The binding parameters of snake venom VEGFs are summarized in Table I. VR-1 and HF also interacted with KDR with high affinity similar to VEGF165 but not with Flt-1. In addition, we tested the binding ability of snake venom VEGFs to other VEGF receptors, Flt-4 (VEGF receptor-3) (25Joukov V. Pajusola K. Kaipainen A. Chilov D. Lahtinen I. Kukk E. Saksela O.

Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2048) Google Scholar); however, we could detect no specific binding ability to either receptor (Fig. 3, c and d). These findings strongly indicate that snake venom VEGFs have unique and highly specific binding properties clearly distinct from VEGF165.Table IKinetic parameters for binding of snake venom VEGFs to immobilized VEGF receptors Association and dissociation of various concentrations of snake venom VEGFs to immobilized VEGF receptors.

In this study, we demonstrated that snake venom VEGFs specifically bound only KDR with essentially an equal affinity to VEGF165 (Fig. 3) and exhibited a more potent biological effect than VEGF165 (Fig. 2, a and d). Recently, it has been reported that five viral VEGFs bind KDR 2.6-fold less avidly than mouse VEGF164 (corresponding to human VEGF165), although they have comparable biological activity to VEGF164 (31Wise L.M. Ueda N. Dryden N.H. Fleming S.B. Caesar C. Roufail S. Achen M.G. Stacker S.A. Mercer A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38004-38014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Flt-1 is thought to be involved in the inhibition of the biological effect of VEGF through several mechanisms (32Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 33Gille H. Kowalski J. Yu L. Chen H. Pisabarro M.T. Davis-Smyth T. Ferrara N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4064-4073Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Taking these factors into account, the potent effects of snake venom VEGFs are hypothesized to reflect their action directly through KDR without the requirement of Flt-1, because the entire loss of Flt-1 binding ability does not lead to the loss of binding activity to KDR. In addition, some viral VEGFs are shown to interact with neuropilin-1, although their binding abilities exhibit significant variation (30Wise L.M. Veikkola T. Mercer A.A. Savory L.J. Fleming S.B. Caesar C. Vitali A. Makinen T. Alitalo K. Stacker S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3071-3076Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 31Wise L.M. Ueda N. Dryden N.H. Fleming S.B.

From this point of view, snake venom VEGFs can classified as a new member of the VEGF family, which has highly specific receptor selectivity to KDR. Most of the important residues for receptor binding are highly conserved in snake venom VEGFs, but some critical residues involved in Flt-1 binding are altered to other amino acid residues. First, Tyr25 in VEGF165 (corresponding to the 13th amino acid in vammin) is replaced by Ala. Recent studies showed that an alanine mutation at this position results in an ∼20-fold decrease in Flt-1 binding without affecting KDR binding (34Pan B. Li B. Russell S.J. Tom J.Y. Cochran A.G. Fairbrother W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 769-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 35Muller Y.A. Li B. Christinger H.W. Wells J.A. Cunningham B.C. de Vos A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7192-7197Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Second, three amino acids (His86, Gln89, and Ile91) in the third loop of VEGF165, which are known to be involved in the complex formation with Flt-1 (36Wiesmann C. Fuh G. Christinger H.W. Eigenbrot C. Wells J.A. de Vos A.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 695-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), are replaced by Arg74, Ser77, and Lys79 in vammin, respectively. Third, one of three negatively charged residues in the second loop (Asp63, Glu64, and Glu67 of VEGF165), reported to be critical for Flt-1 binding (37Keyt B.A. Nguyen H.V. Berleau L.T. Duarte C.M. Park J. Chen H. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5638-5646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), are changed to a positively charged residue (Lys55) in snake venom VEGFs. In total, 5 critical residues involved in Flt-1 binding are altered in snake venom VEGFs. We postulate that it is through these variations between mammalian and snake venom VEGFs that snake venom VEGFs acquired their unique and specific receptor selectivity. In conclusion, we report the characterization of VEGF molecules from snake venoms. Snake venom VEGFs exhibited highly specific binding to KDR with essentially an equal ability to VEGF165 but did not bind to other VEGF receptors at all, and the binding to KDR alone resulted in potent biological activity. As both proteins are comparatively rich in venom (0.4–0.6% of total venom protein), they make very useful and attractive tools for studying vascular biology, such as determining specific signal transduction of KDR. During the course of our attempt to determine the mechanism of potent activity of VEGFs derived from snake venoms, the discovery of two new snake venom VEGFs, namely svVEGF and ICPP, was reported by two groups (Fig. 1) (38Junqueira de Azevedo I.L.

Snake venom VEGFs form the sixth group of the VEGF family, and we propose the new group name “VEGF-F” or alternatively “F-VEGF” for snake venom VEGFs. We anticipate that further analysis will elucidate the binding mechanism of these receptor-selective VEGFs and facilitate the design of new pharmaceutical treatments based on novel receptor specific ligands.

https://openalex.org/W2024048778,"Angiotensin II (ANG II), a key regulator of blood pressure and body fluid homeostasis, exerts mitogenic effects on endothelial cells. We therefore hypothesized that ANG II could be a mediator between homeostatic changes within the vascular perfusion bed and growth factor-driven angiogenesis. In the present study, we applied the alginate implant angiogenesis model in mice with normal ANG II levels, elevated ANG II levels by transgenic overexpression of angiotensinogen (AOGEN), or in AT2 receptor-deficient mice. We demonstrate that a decrease in the amount of circulating ANG II by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril or the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan induced a stimulation of in vivo angiogenesis implying an inhibitory function of ANG II through the AT1 receptor. However, the strong increase of angiogenesis in AOGEN-transgenic mice compared with mice with normal ANG II levels suggests additional stimulatory activity. We showed that the ANG II-induced stimulation of angiogenesis is linked to the AT2 receptor as an impaired induction of angiogenesis was obtained in AT2 receptor knockout mice. These findings provide the first evidence that the AT2 receptor mediates a stimulation of in vivo angiogenesis and indicate that ANG II is a humoral regulator of peripheral angiogenesis involving two receptor subtypes with opposing actions."
https://openalex.org/W2137154584,"Kappa opioid receptor (KOR) desensitization was previously shown to follow agonist-dependent phosphorylation of serine 369 by G-protein receptor kinase (GRK) and β-arrestin binding in transfected cells. To study the in vivo effects induced by phosphorylation of KOR(S369), C57Bl/6 mice were administered single or repeated doses of the KOR agonist, U50,488, and isolated brain glycoprotein was probed with an antibody, KOR-P, that specifically recognized phosphoserine 369 KOR. Western blot analysis using KOR-P antibody showed that labeling intensity increased after either single or repeated treatment of mice with U50,488 by 59 ± 22% and 101 ± 29%, respectively. In contrast, there was no change in labeling intensity by nonphosphoselective KOR antibodies following acute or chronic in vivo treatment with kappa agonist. Moreover, mice lacking GRK3 showed no increase in KOR-P labeling and developed significantly less analgesic tolerance following treatment with kappa agonist. The result suggests that tolerance to kappa agonists includes phosphorylation of serine 369 within KOR by GRK3. Recovery of analgesic potency and reduction of elevated KOR-P labeling in wild-type mice both required 2 weeks to return to base line. Consistent with these results, in vitro phosphorylation by GRK3 of KOR isolated from tolerant mice resulted in 46 ± 7% less 32P incorporation than in KOR isolated from untreated mice. In addition, in vitro 32P incorporation returned to base line levels only in KOR isolated from tolerant mice allowed to recover for 2 weeks. The coincident reversal of analgesic tolerance and slow return to a basal phosphorylation state matched the regeneration rate of functional kappa receptors following irreversible antagonism and suggested that receptor replacement rather than dephosphorylation was required to restore sensitivity."

However, it is unclear whether PKCϵ activation represents a final common pathway for cardioprotection versus one branch of a network of cellular mechanisms that preserve myocardial integrity. Distinction between alternative models would establish the importance of this signaling molecule as a therapeutic target for prevention of ischemic heart disease. Previous efforts to test PKCϵ function as a requirement for cardioprotection were limited by toxicity and poor specificity of in vitro inhibitors of phosphorylation activity (6Zhao J. Renner O.

The functional significance of PKCδ activation during myocardial ischemia reperfusion is controversial. For example, Chen et al. (13Chen L. Hahn H. Wu G. Chen C.H. Liron T. Schechtman D. Cavallaro G. Banci L. Guo Y. Bolli R. Dorn II, G.W. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Contradicting these reports are investigations of pharmacological preconditioning in which PKCδ activation was shown to be essential for cardioprotection. For example, Kudo et al. (15Kudo M. Wang Y. Xu M. Ayub A. Ashraf M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H296-H301Google Scholar) found that beneficial effects of adenosine A1 receptor agonist pretreatment were associated with PKCδ up-regulation and blocked by isozyme-selective antagonists such as rottlerin. Fryer et al. (12Fryer R.M. Wang Y. Hsu A.K. Gross G.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H1346-H1353Google Scholar) observed that δ1-opioid receptor agonist treatment reduced infarction size during coronary artery occlusion in association with PKCδ translocation to cardiac myocyte mitochondria, effects that were also blocked by rottlerin (12Fryer R.M. Wang Y. Hsu A.K. Gross G.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H1346-H1353Google Scholar). In this study, we examined hearts from PKCϵ knock-out (KO) mice under physiological conditions and during ischemia reperfusion. PKCϵ expression was clearly not a requirement for normal development because null-mutant mice could not be distinguished from their wild-type littermates by general appearance or cardiovascular function. However, acute cardioprotection induced by ischemic preconditioning or α1-adrenergic receptor stimulation was blocked in PKCϵ KO hearts. Targeted disruption of the PKCϵ gene increased expression and activation of PKCδ in cardiac myocytes. However, PKCδ activation in the absence of PKCϵ expression did not alter resistance to ischemia-reperfusion injury. These results support PKCϵ activation as an essential component of cardioprotection and an important target for prevention of the pathophysiology associated with coronary artery disease. Our data favor PKCδ function as a mediator of normal cardiovascular development, particularly in the context of compromised PKCϵ signaling. Animals—Mutant mice lacking PKCϵ were originally derived by homologous recombination in J1 embryonic stem cells (16Khasar S.G. Lin Y.H. Martin A. Dadgar J. McMahon T. Wang D. Hundle B. Aley K.O.

F1 generation hybrid C57BL/6Jx129SvJae heterozygous progeny were then intercrossed to generate F2 generation hybrid wild-type and PKCϵ-null littermates for study. Male mice 12–16 weeks of age were used for experiments. Animal care and handling procedures were in accordance with established institutional and National Institutes of Health guidelines. Cardiac Myocyte Culture Model—Left ventricular myocytes were cultured using modification of the method described by Zhou et al. (17Zhou Y.Y. Wang S.Q. Zhu W.Z. Chruscinski A. Kobilka B.K. Ziman B.

Excised hearts were cannulated via the aorta for retrograde perfusion with Ca2+-free buffer containing (in mmol/liter) NaCl 120, KCl 5.4, MgSO4 1.2, NaH2PO4 1.2, glucose 5.6, NaHCO3 20, 2,3-butanedionemonoxime 10, taurine 5, and type B collagenase 1.5 mg/ml (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ). Myocytes were resuspended as described previously (17Zhou Y.Y. Wang S.Q. Zhu W.Z. Chruscinski A. Kobilka B.K. Ziman B. Wang S. Lakatta E.G. Cheng H. Xiao R.P. Am. J.

Medium was changed to minimal essential medium with Hanks' buffered salt solution containing transferrin (10 ng/ml) and insulin (10 ng/ml). This protocol yielded 80% rod-shaped myocytes with defined sarcomeric striations viable at pH 7.2 for 48 h. In Vivo Hemodynamic Measurements—Systolic blood pressure and heart rate were measured in conscious mice after training using a non-invasive computerized tail cuff system (VisiTech Systems, Apex, NC). Results are expressed as the means of three independent daily measurements with at least 15 of 20 successful analyses each (18Rokosh D.G. Simpson P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9474-9479Google Scholar). Echocardiographic studies were performed on conscious mice after training using a 15-MHz linear array transducer and commercially available imaging system (Acuson Sequoia c256, Mountain View, CA). Cardiac catheterization was performed in closed-chest mice after the administration of ketamine. A Mikrotip™ pressure-transducing catheter (Millar Instruments, Houston, TX) was inserted into the right carotid artery and advanced retrograde into the left ventricle. Heart rate, aortic pressure, and left ventricular pressures were monitored continuously using a chart recorder with signal conditioning units (Gould Electronics, Hayward, CA). Ex Vivo Ischemia-reperfusion Model of Myocardial Infarction—Excised hearts were cannulated via the aorta and perfused on a Langendorff apparatus using Krebs-Henseleit solution containing (in mmol/liter) NaCl 118, KCl 4.7, CaCl2 2.5, MgSO4 1.2, KH2PO4 1.2, NaHCO3 24, glucose 5.5, sodium pyruvate 5.0, and EDTA 0.5. Hearts were paced at 6 Hz, and left ventricular (LV) developed pressure (LVDP = LV systolic pressure - LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP)) was measured using a micromanometer (Millar Instruments) passed into a polyvinylchloride balloon in the LV cavity (19Zhou H. Karliner J.S. Gray M.O. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H165-H174Google Scholar). Base-line hemodynamic parameters were recorded during 20-min equilibration before hearts were subjected to 20-min global ischemia and 30-min reperfusion. Wild-type and PKCϵ KO hearts were pretreated with 2-min global ischemia (transient ischemic preconditioning, TIP) or 2-min phenylephrine (PHE) infusion (20 μmol/liter) followed by a 5-min washout prior to index ischemia reperfusion. In separate experiments, wild-type and PKCϵ KO hearts were preconditioned with four cycles of 4-min global ischemia and 6-min reperfusion (4-CYCLE IP). Hearts isolated from C57BL/6J mice were pretreated with PKCϵ agonist peptide (YGRKKRRQRRR-HDAPIGYD), antagonist (YGRKKRRQRRR-EAVSLKPT), or scrambled antagonist (YGRKKRRRQRRR-LSETKPAV) infusion (1 μmol/liter) with no washout period before ischemia reperfusion. Peptides were synthesized at the University of California San Francisco Biomolecular Resource Center using N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) chemistry. All of the peptides were purified (>95%) by preparative reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (19Zhou H. Karliner J.S. Gray M.O. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H165-H174Google Scholar). Creatine kinase (CK) activity in coronary effluent collected during reperfusion was measured using a commercial kit (Sigma) and corrected for flow rate and wet heart weight. After reperfusion, hearts were perfused with 1% triphenyltetrazolium chloride solution, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, and sectioned (20Jin Z. Zhou H.Z. Zhu P. Mochly-Rosen D. Messing R.O. Goetzl E.J. Karliner J.S. Gray M.O. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: H1970-H1977Google Scholar). Planimetry of viable (stained) and necrotic (unstained) tissue was performed using NIH Image software. Infarction size was corrected for the weight of each heart section. Protein Kinase C Assays—Western blot analysis of PKC isozyme expression was performed as described previously (19Zhou H. Karliner J.S. Gray M.O. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H165-H174Google Scholar). Left ventricular tissue was homogenized, and samples of the 100,000 × g supernatant and Triton X-100-extracted pellet fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. PKC distribution was determined using isozyme-selective primary antibodies (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) and enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Biosciences). In separate experiments, intact mitochondria were isolated from individual mouse hearts using differential centrifugation protocols (21Maklashina E. Sher Y. Zhou H.Z. Gray M.O. Karliner J.S. Cecchini G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 6-12Google Scholar) and subjected to Western analysis. Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described previously (5Dorn II, G.W. Souroujon M.C. Liron T. Chen C.H. Gray M.O. Zhou H.Z. Csukai M. Wu G. Lorenz J.N. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12798-12803Google Scholar, 11Gray M.O. Karliner J.S. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30945-30951Google Scholar). Myocytes were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. Cells were incubated with PKC isozyme-selective primary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies. In selected experiments, cells were stained with MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) prior to fixation. Fluorescent images of labeled myocytes were acquired using a Leica TCS confocal laser-scanning microscope system (Leica Lasertechik, Heidelberg, Germany). Statistical Analysis—Results are reported as the means ± S.E. Comparisons between groups were made using one-way ANOVA or repeated measures ANOVA as indicated. Differences were confirmed using a Bonferroni post hoc test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Normal Base-line Morphology and in Vivo Cardiac Function in PKCϵ KO Mice—Because PKCϵ activation is important for physiological myocardial development in other mouse models (1Mochly-Rosen D. Wu G. Hahn H. Osinka H. Liron T. Lorenz J.N. Yatani A. Robbins J. Dorn II, G.W. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1173-1179Google Scholar, 2Wu G. Toyokawa T. Hahn H. Dorn II, G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29927-29930Google Scholar), we were surprised to find that hearts from PKCϵ KO mice were normal in weight and appearance (Table I). Furthermore, cellular volumes of myocytes isolated from PKCϵ KO hearts were no different from wild-type cardiac myocytes (22,275 ± 958 versus 24,565 ± 918 μm3; n = 4, p = not significant) as measured electronically with a Coulter counter (22Said S. Tamura T. Gerdes A.M. BioTechniques. 1998; 25: 522-525Google Scholar). Therefore, targeted disruption of the PKCϵ gene had no obvious effect on overall heart morphology or individual cardiac myocyte size.Table IData are expressed as the mean ± S.D.; n = 6–8/groupWild-type micePKCϵ KO miceMorphometric assessment Body weight (g)38 ± 536 ± 2 Heart weight (mg)167 ± 15152 ± 30Non-invasive hemodynamics (no anesthesia) Heart rate (beats/min)679 ± 28655 ± 43 Systolic blood pressure (mm Hg)109 ± 6100 ± 11Echocardiographic analysis (no anesthesia) Heart rate (beats/min)620 ± 107689 ± 56 Left ventricular ejection fraction (%)81 ± 279 ± 3 Left ventricular mass (mg)100 ± 1891 ± 14Diastole Left ventricular internal dimension (mm)3.15 ± 0.372.87 ± 0.12 Interventricular septum thickness (mm)1.20 ± 0.241.15 ± 0.04 Posterior wall thickness (mm)1.23 ± 0.091.20 ± 0.22Systole Left ventricular internal dimension (mm)1.17 ± 0.250.99 ± 0.13 Interventricular septum thickness (mm)1.88 ± 0.101.93 ± 0.07 Posterior wall thickness (mm)1.69 ± 0.151.60 ± 0.24Invasive hemodynamics (ketamine anesthesia) Heart rate (beats/min)368 ± 72383 ± 81 Mean arterial pressure (mmHg)78 ± 1469 ± 16 LV systolic pressure (mm Hg)90 ± 1287 ± 15 +dP/dt (mm Hg/s)9,138 ± 2,8108,844 ± 3,005 LV end-diastolic pressure (mm Hg)5.4 ± 1.44.9 ± 2.0 Open table in a new tab PKC activation also regulates myocardial contractility through direct phosphorylation of myofilament proteins (23Burkart E.M. Sumandea M.P. Kobayashi T. Niu M. Martin A.F. Homsher E. Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11265-11272Google Scholar). However, we found no difference in base-line hemodynamic function between wild-type and PKCϵ KO mice during in vivo catheterization (Table I). Non-invasive techniques performed in conscious mice validated results obtained using invasive approaches. First, there were no differences in left ventricular mass or contractile function between groups measured using two-dimensional and M-mode echocardiography (Table I). Second, tail cuff measurements of systolic blood pressure and heart rate were normal in PKCϵ KO mice (Table I). Loss of Cardioprotection in PKCϵ KO Mice—PKCϵ activation in cardiac myocytes induces resistance against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (4Ping P. Zhang J. Pierce W.M. Bolli R. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 59-62Google Scholar, 5Dorn II, G.W. Souroujon M.C. Liron T. Chen C.H. Gray M.O. Zhou H.Z. Csukai M. Wu G. Lorenz J.N. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12798-12803Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether PKCϵ activation is required for the beneficial effects of acute ischemic or pharmacological preconditioning. Here we investigated cardioprotective signaling using buffer-perfused hearts from wild-type and PKCϵ KO mice to eliminate potential confounding effects of PKCϵ gene disruption on pulmonary, vascular (24Littler C.M. Morris K.G. Fagan K.A. McMurtry I.F. Messing R.O. Dempsey E.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: H1321-H1331Google Scholar), and central nervous system (25Hodge C.W. Raber J. McMahon R. Walter H. Sanchez-Perez A.M. Olive M.F. Mehmert K. Morrow A.L. Messing R.O. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1003-1010Google Scholar) functions. We observed no differences in LVDP between wild-type and PKCϵ KO hearts (84 ± 3 versus 86 ± 3 mm Hg; n = 18, p = not significant), confirming measurements made during in vivo catheterization. Prolonged ischemia reperfusion severely impaired LVDP recovery (Fig. 1A) in both groups of hearts (20 ± 4 versus 19 ± 3 mm Hg; n = 6, p = not significant). Independent laboratories have shown that pretreatment with brief ischemia, here termed TIP, prevents cardiac injury during prolonged ischemia reperfusion in association with PKC activation (9Mitchell M.B. Meng X. Ao L. Brown J.M. Harken A.H. Banerjee A. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 73-81Google Scholar, 10Kawamura S. Yoshida K. Miura T. Mizukami Y. Matsuzaki M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H2266-H2271Google Scholar). In this study, we found that TIP improved LVDP recovery during reperfusion (Fig. 1B) in wild-type hearts (61 ± 3 versus 20 ± 4 mm Hg for controls; n = 6, p < 0.05). However, the beneficial effects of TIP on contractility did not develop in PKCϵ KO hearts (Fig. 1B). Cardioprotection in association with PKC activation has also been observed after stimulation with pharmacological agents such as adenosine A1 receptor agonists (15Kudo M. Wang Y. Xu M. Ayub A. Ashraf M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H296-H301Google Scholar), δ1-opioid receptor agonists (12Fryer R.M. Wang Y. Hsu A.K. Gross G.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H1346-H1353Google Scholar, 26Huh J. Gross G.J. Nagase H. Liang B.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H377-H383Google Scholar), ethanol (19Zhou H. Karliner J.S. Gray M.O. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H165-H174Google Scholar, 27Chen C.H. Gray M.O. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12784-12789Google Scholar), sphingosine-1-phosphate (20Jin Z. Zhou H.Z. Zhu P. Mochly-Rosen D. Messing R.O. Goetzl E.J. Karliner J.S. Gray M.O. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: H1970-H1977Google Scholar), and α1-adrenergic receptor agonists (9Mitchell M.B. Meng X. Ao L. Brown J.M. Harken A.H. Banerjee A. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 73-81Google Scholar, 28Cohen M.V. Yang X.M. Liu G.S. Heusch G. Downey J.M. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 273-278Google Scholar). Here we pretreated with PHE at concentrations selective for α1-adrenergic receptor stimulation and improved LVDP recovery during reperfusion in wild-type but not PKCϵ KO hearts (Fig. 1C). Similarly, TIP and PHE prevented pathological elevation of LVEDP after ischemia reperfusion only in wild-type hearts (Fig. 1, B and C). Our study next focused on whether improvement of LVDP recovery was associated with reduction of myocardial necrosis (29Cohen M.V. Yang X. Downey J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H1754-H1761Google Scholar, 30Xi L. Hess M.L. Kukreja R.C. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 186: 69-77Google Scholar). We observed that 20-min ischemia and 30-min reperfusion produced extensive infarction in both wild-type and PKCϵ KO hearts (Fig. 2A). TIP reduced infarction size (Fig. 2B) in wild-type hearts (27 ± 3 versus 47 ± 3% LV mass for WT controls; n = 6, p < 0.05). However, effects of TIP on infarction size were blocked in PKCϵ KO hearts (Fig. 2B). Similarly, PHE reduced infarction in wild-type hearts to 29 ± 3% LV mass (n = 6, p < 0.05 versus WT controls) but did not induce protection in PKCϵ KO hearts (Fig. 2C). Creatine kinase activity in coronary effluent validated measurements of infarction size (Fig. 2). PKCϵ Activation Is Required for Acute Cardioprotection in C57BL/6 Mice—Although the PKCϵ KO mouse model is a powerful tool for investigation of cardioprotective signaling, we sought alternative approaches for inhibition of PKCϵ function. Chen et al. (13Chen L. Hahn H. Wu G. Chen C.H. Liron T. Schechtman D. Cavallaro G. Banci L. Guo Y. Bolli R. Dorn II, G.W. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11114-11119Google Scholar) previously used modulators of PKC isozyme translocation in ex vivo rat hearts to examine the effects of PKCδ and PKCϵ activation on creatine kinase release during ischemia reperfusion. Gustafsson et al. (31Gustafsson A.B. Sayen M.R. Williams S.D. Crow M.T. Gottlieb R.A. Circulation. 2002; 106: 735-739Google Scholar) recently confirmed that trans-activating protein-mediated protein transduction delivered cardioprotective peptides into buffer-perfused rat hearts, including cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions. In this study, we added a peptide agonist of PKCϵ translocation (5Dorn II, G.W. Souroujon M.C. Liron T. Chen C.H. Gray M.O. Zhou H.Z. Csukai M. Wu G. Lorenz J.N. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12798-12803Google Scholar, 32Souroujon M.C. Mochley-Rosen D. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 919-924Google Scholar) linked to amino acids derived from the protein transduction domain of human immunodeficiency virus transactivating protein protein (33Schwarze S.R. Ho A. Vocero-Akbani A. Dowdy S.F. Science. 1999; 285: 1569-1572Google Scholar) to perfusate for 20 min before global ischemia. PKCϵ agonist pretreatment did not affect the subcellular distributions of PKCα and PKCδ in left ventricular lysates (Fig. 3A). However, agonist infusion increased the proportion of PKCϵ localized to 100,000 × g particulate fractions (0.63 ± 0.02 versus 0.46 ± 0.02 for controls; n = 3, p < 0.01), indicating activation (3Dorn II, G.W. Mochly-Rosen D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 407-429Google Scholar, 34Kraft A.S. Anderson W.R. Nature. 1983; 301: 621-623Google Scholar). In independent experiments, we found that TIP did not alter the subcellular distribution of PKCα but increased the proportion of PKCδ (0.54 ± 0.02 versus 0.40 ± 0.02 for controls; n = 3, p < 0.01) and PKCϵ (0.57 ± 0.06 versus 0.37 ± 0.03 for controls; n = 3, p < 0.05) in particulate fractions (Fig. 3B). PKCϵ antagonist had no effect on TIP-induced translocation of PKCδ (Fig. 3C). However, the antagonist blocked translocation of PKCϵ to particulate fractions (64 ± 2 versus 117 ± 12 density units for scrambled antagonist; n = 3, p < 0.05), indicating degradation of activated isozyme not bound by its anchoring proteins or receptors for activated C-kinase (3Dorn II, G.W. Mochly-Rosen D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 407-429Google Scholar). Scrambled PKCϵ antagonist had no effect on the subcellular distributions of the PKC isozymes examined. Therefore, trans-activating protein-mediated protein transduction delivered selective activators and inhibitors of PKCϵ function into mouse hearts. Ping et al. (4Ping P. Zhang J. Pierce W.M. Bolli R. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 59-62Google Scholar) developed transgenic mice in which cardiac expression of constitutively active PKCϵ induced resistance to ischemia-reperfusion injury. Dorn et al. (5Dorn II, G.W. Souroujon M.C. Liron T. Chen C.H. Gray M.O. Zhou H.Z. Csukai M. Wu G. Lorenz J.N. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12798-12803Google Scholar) established that PKCϵ activation caused by transgenic expression of PKCϵ agonist peptide in mouse hearts also caused sustained cardioprotection. Here we found that pretreatment with PKCϵ agonist improved LVDP recovery (Fig. 4A) in normal hearts from C57BL/6 mice (66 ± 4 versus 28 ± 4 mm Hg for controls; n = 6, p < 0.05). PKCϵ agonist pretreatment also reduced infarction and creatine kinase release caused by ischemia reperfusion (Fig. 4A). Thus, direct activation of PKCϵ translocation through acute modulation of interactions with anchoring proteins mimicked the cardioprotective effects of ischemic and α1-adrenergic receptor-mediated preconditioning. We previously used inhibitors of PKCϵ translocation in a neonatal rat cardiac myocyte model of hypoxic preconditioning to show that PKCϵ activation was necessary for acute protection against hypoxia-induced cell death (11Gray M.O. Karliner J.S. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30945-30951Google Scholar). Ping et al. (35Ping P. Zhang J. Cao X. Li R.C.X. Kong D. Tang X.L. Qiu Y. Manchikalapudi S. Auchampach J.A. Black R.G. Bolli R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: H1468-H1481Google Scholar) later observed that adenovirus-mediated expression of dominant-negative mutant PKCϵ in isolated rabbit cardiac myocytes also blocked protection during simulated ischemia. In this study, pretreatment of intact heart with PKCϵ antagonist had no effect on base-line contractile function. However, inhibition of PKCϵ translocation blocked improvement of LVDP recovery after preconditioning (Fig. 4, B and C). Selective PKCϵ inhibition also prevented TIP- and PHE-mediated reduction of infarction size and creatine kinase release. Scrambled PKCϵ antagonist had no effect on cardiac contractility, infarction size, or creatine kinase release. Thus, PKCϵ activation was necessary for the acute protection of intact myocardium against ischemia-reperfusion injury in C57BL/6 mice. Contra"

Treatment of PV with systemic corticosteroids is life-saving, but the mechanism of the therapeutic action has not been fully understood. We have developed an animal model that demonstrates that methylprednisolone (MP) can block PV IgG-induced acantholysis, decreasing the extent of keratinocyte detachment in the epidermis of 3–5-day-old nude mice from 77.5 ± 0.6 to 24.1 ± 1.5% (p < 0.05). We hypothesized that in addition to immunosuppression, MP may exhibit direct anti-acantholytic effects in epidermis, and we compared the effects of PV IgG and MP on KC. The use of DNA microarray showed that PV IgG down-regulated and MP up-regulated expression of the genes encoding keratinocyte adhesion molecules, antigen-processing proteins, regulators of cell cycle and apoptosis, differentiation markers, Na+,K+-ATPase, protein kinases and phosphatases, and serine proteases and their inhibitors. Overall, PV IgG decreased transcription of 198 genes and increased transcription of 31 genes. MP decreased transcription of 14 genes and increased transcription of 818 genes. Specific effects of PV IgG and MP on keratinocyte adhesion molecules were further investigated by Western blot and immunofluorescence assays. By immunoblotting, MP increased the protein levels of E-cadherin and desmogleins 1 and 3 by 300, 180, and 40%, respectively. Specific staining of KC for E-cadherin and desmogleins 1 and 3 increased by 235, 228, and 148%, respectively. In addition, PV IgG increased the level of phosphorylation of E-cadherin by 42%, β-catenin by 37%, γ-catenin by 136%, and desmoglein 3 by 300%, whereas pretreatment with 0.25 mm MP abolished phosphorylation of these adhesion molecules. These results suggested that therapeutic effects of MP in PV include both the up-regulated synthesis and post-translational modification of the keratinocyte adhesion molecules.

Experimental results obtained in vitro, in skin organ culture or epidermal cell monolayer, and in vivo, in neonatal Balb/c mice, demonstrated that binding of pemphigus antibodies to the cell surface of KC causes these cells to separate from one another and round up (acantholysis) (1.Bellone A.G.

Prior to the development of synthetic corticosteroid hormones (CH) in the late 1940s, PV was almost invariably a fatal illness (5.Lever W.F. Medicine (Baltimore). 1953; 32: 2-123Crossref Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The prognosis of the disease has improved dramatically because of the introduction of glucocorticosteroid drugs in the treatment of pemphigus patients. Systemic administration of CH allows for establishing control of acantholysis in the skin and oral mucosa of the patient during the acute stage of the disease (6.Holubar K. Fellner M.J. Rook A.

Thus, although modern treatment of pemphigus with CH is life-saving, the patients suffer from severe side effects and complications. Alternative therapies that foster keratinocyte adhesion and/or specifically antagonize the effects of pemphigus autoantibodies are desperately needed. A modified synthetic corticosteroid agent with a specific anti-acantholytic therapeutic action or a novel non-steroidal drug that mimics anti-acantholytic effects of CH should replace CH in future treatment of pemphigus. This goal cannot be achieved without a better understanding of the mechanism of therapeutic action of CH in pemphigus. The enigma of glucocorticosteroid efficacy in pemphigus stems from the following facts: 1) although it is possible to maintain pemphigus patients in remission using immunosuppressive drugs without CH (14.Lever W.F. Schaumburg-Lever G. Arch. Dermatol. 1977; 113: 1236-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 15.Lever W.F. Schaumburg-Lever G. Arch. Dermatol. 1984; 120: 44-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 16.Stemm C. Thivolet J. Eur. J. Dermatol. 1995; 5: 664-670Google Scholar), initial treatment of PV relies on the high dose of systemic CH, up to 500–1000 mg of prednisone daily (“pulse therapy”) (14.Lever W.F. Schaumburg-Lever G. Arch. Dermatol. 1977; 113: 1236-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 17.Ahmed A.R. Graham J. Jordon R.E. Provost T.T. Ann. Intern. Med. 1980; 92: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar); and 2) the doses required to stop blistering and the maintenance doses of CH in many patients are usually much higher compared with those ordinarily used to control other autoimmune diseases (18.Myles, A. B., and Daly, J. R. (1974) Corticosteroid and ACTH Treatment: Principles and ProblemsGoogle Scholar). There are several lines of evidence that high doses of systemic CH control acantholysis via actions that are not limited to the immunosuppressive properties of these drugs but harbor direct anti-acantholytic effects on KC. First, although the major decline in antibody titers occurs 3–4 weeks after glucocorticosteroid administration (19.McMillan R. Longmire R. Yelenosky R. J. Immunol. 1976; 116: 1592-1595PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Saxon A. Stevens R.H. Ramer S.J. Clements P.J. Yu D.T. J. Clin.

Investig. 1973; 52: 2629-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), clinical lesions in PV patients usually improve much more rapidly, within 24–48 h after initiation of a high dose, “pulse” therapy with methylprednisolone (MP) or dexamethasone, when the titer of pemphigus autoantibodies remains unchanged (22.Werth V.P. Arch. Dermatol. 1996; 132: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Hashimoto K. Singer K. Lazarus G.S. Br. J.

Chaidemenos G.C. Panagiotides D. Karakatsanis G. Int. J. Dermatol. 1995; 34: 438-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Second, local administration of glucocorticosteroid agents, such as a very potent topical corticosteroid 0.05% clobetasol propionate cream, reportedly can alone initially control cutaneous lesions in mild cases of PV (27.Dumas V. Roujeau J.C. Wolkenstein P. Revuz J. Cosnes A. Br. J. Dermatol. 1999; 140: 1127-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Third, both MP (28.Swanson D.L. Dahl M.V. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1983; 81: 258-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and hydrocortisone (29.Jeffes E.W.D. Kaplan R.P. Ahmed A.R. J. Clin. Lab. Immunol. 1984; 4: 359-363Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar) have been independently shown to block PV IgG-induced acantholysis in skin organ cultures at the doses used in the acute stage of treatment of PV patients. Since in either experiment antibody-producing cells were not added to the system, the glucocorticosteroid agents did not exhibit their anti-acantholytic effects by way of acting upon lymphocytes. How CH counteracted the acantholytic effects of PV IgG on KC, however, remained to be elucidated. Cell-to-cell adhesion of KC is mediated by three types of intercellular junctions: tight (zonula occludens), adherence (zonula adherens), and desmosomal (macula adherens). The classical cadherins are accumulated in the adherens junctions and bind to each other homotypically, whereas desmosomal cadherins mediate intercellular cohesion via desmosomes (reviewed in Refs. 30.Kowalczyk A.P. Bornslaeger E.A. Norvell S.M. Palka H.L. Green K.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1999; 185: 237-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Vasioukhin V. Fuchs E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 76-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 32.Kitajima Y. Clin. Exp. Dermatol. 2002; 27: 684-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Classical cadherins interact via their highly conserved cytoplasmic domain with the group of catenins (Cat; α, β, and γ), which link cadherins to the actin microfilaments. Desmosomal cadherins bind to the keratin intermediate filaments via the plakoglobin (also known as γ-Cat). It has been proposed that assembly and disassembly of desmosomes may be regulated by extracellular Ca2+ through reversible protein phosphorylation involving both protein kinase and protein phosphatases (33.Pasdar M. Li Z. Chan H. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 30: 108-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of classical cadherins on tyrosine disables the adherence type junctions leading to cell-cell detachment (34.Behrens J. Vakaet L. Friis R. Winterhager E. Van Roy F. Mareel M.M. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar, 35.Volberg T. Zick Y. Dror R. Sabanay I. Gilon C. Levitzki A. Geiger B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1733-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Experimentally inhibiting tyrosine-specific phosphatases results in a major change in cell morphology manifested by rapid rounding-up of the cells followed by reorganization of the cell monolayer (35.Volberg T. Zick Y. Dror R. Sabanay I. Gilon C. Levitzki A. Geiger B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1733-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In addition to phosphorylation of desmoglein (Dsg) (36.Rees D.A. CIBA Found. Symp. 1987; 125: 1-273PubMed Google Scholar), desmocollin (37.Parrish E.P. Marston J.E. Mattey D.L. Measures H.R. Venning R. Garrod D.R. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 96: 239-248PubMed Google Scholar), and desmoplakin (38.Mueller H. Franke W.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 163: 647-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), assembly/disassembly of desmosomal junctions also involves phosphorylation of the keratin and vimentin intermediate filaments (reviewed in Ref. 39.Eriksson J.E. Opal P. Goldman R.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). For example, phosphatase inhibitors lead to a collapse of the cytoskeleton by promoting disassembly of the intermediate (cytokeratin) filament networks and accumulation of “soluble” hyperphosphorylated structural proteins (40.Lee W.C. Yu J.S. Yang S.D. Lai Y.K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 49: 378-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 41.Vikstrom K.L. Lim S.S. Goldman R.D. Borisy G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Although it has been postulated that binding of pemphigus IgGs to the desmosomal cadherins Dsg 1 and 3 interferes with cell-cell adhesion due to steric hindrance (42.Amagai M. J. Dermatol. Sci. 1999; 20: 92-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), binding of pemphigus autoantibodies to KC is not restricted to the desmosomal areas (43.Takahashi Y. Patel H.P. Labib R.S. Diaz L.A. Anhalt G.J. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1985; 84: 41-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 44.Bedane C. Prost C. Thomine E. Intrator L. Joly P.

Acantholysis in both skin and organ cultures treated with pemphigus IgGs starts from intracellular events such as retraction of tonofilaments, followed by widening of the intercellular space at the non-desmosomal areas with desmosomes remaining intact (45.Hashimoto K. Lever W.F. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1967; 48: 540-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 46.Wilgram G.F. Caulfield J.B. Lever W.F. J. Investig.

Fitzpatrick T.B. Eisen A.Z. Wolff K. Freedberg I.M. Austen K.F. Dermatology in General Medicine. 2nd Ed. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1979: 310-317Google Scholar). Furthermore, PV IgG binding to KC evokes biochemical effects associated with rearrangement of the cytoskeleton and adhesive units (50.Kitajima Y. Inoue S. Yaoita H. Br. J. Dermatol. 1986; 114: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been elucidated that PV IgG causes formation of Dsg 3-depleted desmosomes (51.Aoyama Y. Kitajima Y. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 67-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and that this process is associated with increased phosphorylation of this desmosomal cadherin (52.Aoyama Y. Owada M.K. Kitajima Y. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 2233-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the use of the synthetic corticosteroid agent dexamethasone, which can exhibit differential regulation of cadherin expression and reorganize adherens junction proteins in various cell types (53.Foty R.A. Corbett S.A. Schwarzbauer J.E. Steinberg M.S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3586-3589PubMed Google Scholar, 54.Woo P.L. Ching D. Guan Y. Firestone G.L. J. Biol.

Biochem. 2000; 77: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), has been shown to reverse the proinflammatory cytokine-induced abnormalities in the expression of E-cadherin (E-Cad), β-cat, and γ-Cat in human bronchial epithelial cells (56.Carayol N. Campbell A. Vachier I. Mainprice B. Bousquet J. Godard P. Chanez P. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 26: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that PV IgG and CH exhibit acantholytic and anti-acantholytic effects, respectively, by producing reciprocal effects on the expression/function of keratinocyte adhesion molecules that mediate intercellular cohesion in the epidermis. In this study, we demonstrate that administration of MP decreases the extent of PV IgG-induced acantholysis in the skin of 3–5-day-old nude mice. To understand the mechanism responsible, we compared effects of PV IgG and MP on KC. The use of DNA microarray assay showed that PV IgG decreased transcription of 198 genes and increased transcription of 31 genes. MP decreased transcription of 14 genes and increased transcription of 818 genes. Among many others, PV IgG down-regulated and MP up-regulated expression of the genes encoding the adhesion molecules Dsg 3 and periplakin. Changes in the adhesion molecule gene expression at the protein level were further investigated using the semi-quantitative Western blot (WB) and indirect immunofluorescence (IF) assays, showing that treatment with MP increases relative amounts of E-Cad, β-Cat, Dsg 1, and Dsg 3 in keratinocyte monolayers. Apparent discrepancies between results obtained in the WB and IF assays suggested that post-translational modifications of adhesion molecules in MP-treated cells might also play a role. This hypothesis was corroborated by the results showing reciprocal modulation of the phosphorylation of keratinocyte adhesion molecules by PV IgG and MP. Thus, both PV IgG and MP can affect epidermal cohesion in pemphigus through a combination of their genomic and the non-genomic effects on KC. Pemphigus and Control IgG Fractions—The results reported herein were obtained in experiments using pooled IgG fractions isolated from sera of five well established PV patients and from sera of healthy people purchased from Sigma. All IgG fractions were isolated using 40% ammonium sulfate followed by dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Sigma), lyophilized, weighed, and reconstituted in PBS, as detailed elsewhere (57.Nguyen V.T. Ndoye A. Shultz L.D. Pittelkow M.R. Grando S.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 1467-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 58.Nguyen V.T. Lee T.X. Ndoye A. Shultz L.D. Pittelkow M.R. Dahl M.V. Lynch P.J. Grando S.A. Arch. Dermatol. 1998; 134: 971-980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This study had been approved by the University of California, Davis, Human Subjects Review Committee. The diagnosis of PV was made based on the results of both comprehensive clinical and histological examinations and immunological studies that included direct IF of the skin biopsies of patients, indirect IF of the sera of patients on various epithelial substrates, immunoblotting, and immunoprecipitation, following standard protocols. The titers of anti-keratinocyte antibodies in the sera of PV patients ranged from 1:80 to 1:1280 by indirect IF on the monkey esophagus substrate. All 5 sera contained high levels of both anti-Dsg 1 and anti-Dsg 3 autoantibodies determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, as described previously (57.Nguyen V.T. Ndoye A. Shultz L.D. Pittelkow M.R. Grando S.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 1467-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay values ranged from 46 to 170 for anti-Dsg 1 antibody and 83–229 for anti-Dsg 3 antibody. The cut-off value was 20. Animal Model for Quantitative Evaluation of the Potential Anti-acantholytic Effect of MP—Three-day-old littermates of the progeny of pairs of homozygous athymic nude mice breeders (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were divided into two groups. The positive control pups were unmarked and injected intraperitoneally with 7 mg/g of body weight of PV IgG alone. Experimental pups were marked on their forehead with permanent ink and injected with 15 μg/g of body weight of MP (Solumedrol; Pharmacia & Upjohn) 2 h prior to injecting PV IgG. A group of mice received a second dose of PV IgG together with MP on the 2nd day and were observed for development of gross skin lesions. Approximately 24 h after the first injection, the pups were euthanized using CO2 to quantify the extent of acantholysis microscopically. The euthanized animals were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, cross-sectioned at the umbilicus level, and embedded into the OCT compound (Miles Scientific, Naperville, IL). Each block was coded with a number, stained by hematoxylin and eosin, and evaluated by light microscopy by an experimenter that was blind to the experimental conditions used. Five random microscopic fields in each skin section were captured at magnification ×10, using a Macintosh computer attached to an Axiovert 135 inverted microscope (Zeiss). The images were printed, and the extent of acantholysis was computed directly on the prints by measuring the length of the areas in the epidermis in which suprabasal cell detachment spread along more than 4 adjacent basal cells. In each image, the extent of acantholysis was expressed as the percent of the total length of the epidermis in the print. The extent of acantholysis was then computed for each animal, and the data are presented as mean ± S.D. At the end of experiments, the codes were broken so that the results could be related to each experimental condition used. DNA Microarray Assay—The cultures of normal human KC were started from neonatal foreskins. The cells were isolated from the epidermis and grown in 75-cm2 flasks (Corning Glass) at 37 °C in serum-free keratinocyte growth medium (KGM) containing 0.09 mm Ca2+ in a humid 5% CO2 incubator, as detailed elsewhere (59.Nguyen V.T. Ndoye A. Grando S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29466-29476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). On the day of the experiment, ∼80% confluent second passage cultures derived from three different donors were washed and fed with fresh KGM containing either 1 mg/ml PV IgG, 1 mg/ml normal IgG, 0.25 mm MP, 1 mg/ml PV IgG after 2 h of pretreatment with 0.25 mm MP or no additions (control), and incubated for 8 h at 37 °C in a humid 5% CO2 incubator. The doses of PV IgG and MP used in this study were chosen based on results published previously (60.Grando S.A. Dahl M.V. J. Eur. Acad. Dermatol. Venereol. 1993; 2: 72-86Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar) showing that similar concentrations of PV IgG induce reversible acantholysis in keratinocyte monolayers, and that the 0.25 mm concentration of MP inhibits pemphigus acantholysis in skin cultures (28.Swanson D.L. Dahl M.V. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1983; 81: 258-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), respectively. The exposure time points were selected based on the results of pilot studies that revealed appreciable acantholysis in PV IgG-treated keratinocyte monolayers after 8 h of exposure and the absence of acantholysis in cultures pretreated with MP (data not shown). These cell cultures were then used to extract mRNA used in the DNA microarray assay, as well as total cell proteins used in WB assay described below. These experiments, as well as in vivo experiments, tested the ability of MP to block or attenuate rather than to reverse the effects of PV IgG, as CH do not reverse PV IgG-induced acantholysis. The DNA microarray assay was performed using the Affymetrix hU95Av2 arrays (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) in accordance to the Affymetrix protocol. In order to identify genes with differential expression, the interdonor experimental variability was corrected by pooling RNA from different cell donors per each treatment condition (61.Kaminski N. Allard J.D. Pittet J.F. Zuo F. Griffiths M.J. Morris D. Huang X. Sheppard D. Heller R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1778-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Keratinocyte mRNA was isolated using the Oligotex Direct mRNA kit (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA), and double-strand cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript Choice system (Invitrogen) primed with the T7-(dT)24 primer. Biotin-labeled cRNA was prepared using the BioArray High Yield RNA transcript Labeling Kit, P/N 900182 (Affymetrix) and hybridized in the Affymetrix Hybridization Oven 640 for 16 h. The arrays were washed, stained with an antibody, washed again using the GeneChip® Fluidics Station 400, and scanned with the Agilent GeneArray Scanner (all from Affymetrix). The data were analyzed using the Microarray Suite version 5.0. In order to identify genes differentially expressed under experimental conditions, the genes whose ratios were higher than 2-fold were retained for comparison. Comparison results from data analysis were provided as the Expression value that serves as a relative indicator of the level of the expression of a transcript, the Detection value that serves as an absolute indicator of the level of the expression of a transcript that is either present or absent, the detection p value, the Signal Log Ratio (SLR) value, from which the fold change (FC) in a gene expression can be calculated (FC = 2[SLR]), and the Change value that serves as an absolute indicator whether the expression of a gene increases (I) or decreases (D). Because the software uses two different expression analysis algorithms to calculate the SLR and the Change value, a change in the expression of a gene is only considered to be meaningful if these values agree with each other. For example, an I value should be provided with SLR >0 and a D value be provided with SLR <0, in addition to a p for the Detection value. Semi-quantitative IF Assays—The PV IgG deposits in the epidermis of experimental and control mice were visualized by incubating cryostat section of mouse skin for 1 h at room temperature with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated (FITC) donkey anti-human IgG antibody (Pierce), as detailed elsewhere (58.Nguyen V.T. Lee T.X. Ndoye A. Shultz L.D. Pittelkow M.R. Dahl M.V. Lynch P.J. Grando S.A. Arch. Dermatol. 1998; 134: 971-980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To visualize adhesion molecules in KC treated with MP, the second passage normal human foreskin KC were grown to confluence in 4-chamber microscope slides (Lab-Tek Chamber Slide System, Nalge Nunc International Corp., Naperville, IL) in KGM containing 0.09 mm Ca2+ (Invitrogen), fed with fresh medium (control) or medium containing 0.25 mm MP (experiment), and incubated in a humid 5% CO2 incubator overnight. The monolayers were washed thoroughly with cold PBS and stained, first with primary antibodies to the keratinocyte adhesion molecules E-cad, Dsg 1, β-Cat, γ-Cat (BD Biosciences), or Dsg 3 (Serotec Ltd., Washington, D. C.) and then with appropriate secondary FITC-conjugated antibodies (Pierce). The specificity of antibody binding in indirect IF experiments was demonstrated by omitting the primary antibody. The IF images were acquired using a computer-linked, video-monitored Axiovert 135 fluorescence microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a CCD video camera (Photon Technology International, Monmouth Junction, NJ) and analyzed using an image analysis software package purchased from Scanalytics (Fairfax, VA). The relative amounts of keratinocyte membrane proteins targeted by PV IgG in murine skin and adhesion molecules expressed by human KC in vitro were estimated by the semi-quantitative IF assay described previously (62.Zia S. Ndoye A. Nguyen V.T."
https://openalex.org/W1984725499,"Recently we showed evidence that mutation of Tyr-335 to Ala (Y335A) in the human dopamine transporter (hDAT) alters the conformational equilibrium of the transport cycle. Here, by substituting, one at a time, 16 different bulky or charged intracellular residues, we identify three residues, Lys-264, Asp-345, and Asp-436, the mutation of which to alanine produces a phenotype similar to that of Y335A. Like Y335A, the mutants (K264A, D345A, and D436A) were characterized by low uptake capacity that was potentiated by Zn2+. Moreover, the mutants displayed lower affinity for cocaine and other inhibitors, suggesting a role for these residues in maintaining the structural integrity of the inhibitor binding crevice. The conformational state of K264A, Y335A, and D345A was investigated by assessing the accessibility to MTSET ([2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]-methanethiosulfonate) of a cysteine engineered into position 159 (I159C) in transmembrane segment 3 of the MTSET-insensitive “E2C” background (C90A/C306A). Unlike its effect at the corresponding position in the homologous norepinephrine transporter (NET I155C), MTSET did not inhibit uptake mediated by E2C I159C. Furthermore, no inhibition was observed upon treatment with MTSET in the presence of dopamine, cocaine, or Zn2+. Without Zn2+, E2C I159C/K264A, E2C I159C/Y335A, and E2C I159C/D345A were also not inactivated by MTSET. In the presence of Zn2+ (10 μm), however, MTSET (0.5 mm) caused up to ∼60% inactivation. As in NET I155C, this inactivation was protected by dopamine and enhanced by cocaine. These data are consistent with a Zn2+-dependent partial reversal of a constitutively altered conformational equilibrium in the mutant transporters. They also suggest that the conformational equilibrium produced by the mutations resembles that of the NET more than that of the DAT. Moreover, the data provide evidence that the cocaine-bound state of both DAT mutants and of the NET is structurally distinct from the cocaine-bound state of the DAT.

The critical physiological role of DAT has been illustrated by targeted disruption of the DAT gene in mice, which resulted in multiple deficits and profoundly altered dopaminergic neurotransmission (4Giros B. Jaber M. Jones S.R. Wightman R.M. Caron M.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 606-612Google Scholar, 5Gainetdinov R.R. Caron M.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2003; 43: 261-284Google Scholar). Furthermore, the DAT has been the focus of much attention because it represents the principle target for the action of widely abused psychostimulants such as cocaine and amphetamine (3Norregaard L. Gether U. Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Dev. 2001; 4: 591-601Google Scholar, 6Chen N. Reith M.E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 405: 329-339Google Scholar). dopamine transporter human dopamine transporter norepinephrine transporter serotonin transporter 2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-fluorophenyl)tropane methanethiosulfonate [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]-methanethiosulfonate transmembrane segment wild type intracellular loop. dopamine transporter human dopamine transporter norepinephrine transporter serotonin transporter 2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-fluorophenyl)tropane methanethiosulfonate [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]-methanethiosulfonate transmembrane segment wild type intracellular loop. The DAT is a prototypic member of the class of Na+/Cl–-dependent transporters, along with neurotransmitter transporters, including the norepinephrine (NET), serotonin (SERT), γ-aminobutyric acid, and glycine transporters (3Norregaard L. Gether U. Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Dev. 2001; 4: 591-601Google Scholar, 6Chen N. Reith M.E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 405: 329-339Google Scholar). This family of transporters is believed to contain 12 putative transmembrane segments (TMs) connected by alternating extracellular and intracellular loops (ICLs) with an intracellular location of the N and C termini (Fig. 1) (3Norregaard L. Gether U. Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Dev. 2001; 4: 591-601Google Scholar, 6Chen N. Reith M.E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 405: 329-339Google Scholar). A high-resolution structure is not yet available for DAT or any related transporter, and our insight into the packing of the 12 helices remains limited (3Norregaard L. Gether U. Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Dev. 2001; 4: 591-601Google Scholar, 6Chen N. Reith M.E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 405: 329-339Google Scholar). The first series of proximity relationships have only quite recently been described in the tertiary structure of the human DAT (hDAT) (7Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Google Scholar, 8Loland C.J. Norregaard L. Gether U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36928-36934Google Scholar, 9Norregaard L. Visiers I. Loland C.J. Ballesteros J. Weinstein H. Gether U. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15836-15846Google Scholar). Interestingly, an increasing amount of evidence suggest that the DAT exists in the membrane as an oligomeric structure, but the functional significance of this still needs to be clarified (10Hastrup H. Karlin A. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10055-10060Google Scholar, 11Kilic F. Rudnick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3106-3111Google Scholar, 12Schmid J.A. Scholze P. Kudlacek O. Freissmuth M. Singer E.A. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3805-3810Google Scholar, 13Norgaard-Nielsen K. Norregaard L. Hastrup H. Javitch J.A. Gether U. FEBS Lett. 2002; 524: 87-91Google Scholar). Transport of substrate mediated by Na+/Cl–-dependent transporters is energetically coupled to the transmembrane sodium gradient maintained by the Na+/K+-ATPase (14Rudnick G. Reith, M.E.A Neurotransmitter Transporters: Structure, Function, and Regulation. 1st Ed. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 73-100Google Scholar). Accordingly, binding of Na+ (two ions in case of DAT) together with substrate is assumed to trigger a critical conformational change that leads to transition of the transporter from an “outward” facing conformation in which the substrate binding site is exposed to the extracellular medium to an “inward” facing conformation in which the substrate binding site is exposed to the intracellular environment (14Rudnick G. Reith, M.E.A Neurotransmitter Transporters: Structure, Function, and Regulation. 1st Ed. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 73-100Google Scholar). This allows for the release of substrate and sodium and potential return of the empty transporter to an outward facing conformation (14Rudnick G. Reith, M.E.A Neurotransmitter Transporters: Structure, Function, and Regulation. 1st Ed. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 73-100Google Scholar). A prerequisite for such an alternating access model is the existence of both external and internal “gates,” that is protein domains that undergo significant conformational changes during the transport cycle and are capable of occluding access to the substrate binding site from the extracellular or intracellular environment, respectively. Currently we know rather little about these putative gating domains, although the application of the substituted cysteine accessibility method has identified several conformationally active regions of the transporter (15Ferrer J. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9238-9243Google Scholar, 16Chen N. Ferrer J.V. Javitch J.A. Justice Jr., J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1608-1614Google Scholar, 17Chen J.G. Rudnick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1044-1049Google Scholar, 18Androutsellis-Theotokis A. Ghassemi F. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45933-45938Google Scholar, 19Androutsellis-Theotokis A. Rudnick G. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8370-8378Google Scholar). We also know very little about the molecular mechanisms governing the equilibrium between the distinct conformational states in the transport cycle, although this must be tightly regulated for proper transporter function. Interestingly, we have recently identified a tyrosine (Tyr-335) in the third ICL of hDAT that may play a key role in regulating this conformational equilibrium (20Loland C.J. Norregaard L. Litman T. Gether U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1683-1688Google Scholar). This inference was primarily based on the observation that mutation of the tyrosine alters completely the effect of Zn2+ at the previously identified endogenous Zn2+ binding site in the hDAT (Refs. 7Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Google Scholar and 8Loland C.J. Norregaard L. Gether U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36928-36934Google Scholar and Fig. 1). In the WT, Zn2+ acts as a potent non-competitive inhibitor of transport via interaction with three residues on the extracellular face of the transporter (Fig. 1) (7Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Google Scholar). In marked contrast, in the Tyr-335 mutant (Y335A) this inhibitory Zn2+ switch is converted into a stimulatory Zn2+ switch, i.e. the transporter only displays efficient uptake in the presence of Zn2+ (20Loland C.J. Norregaard L. Litman T. Gether U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1683-1688Google Scholar). We inferred that mutation of Tyr-335 produced a constitutive shift in the distribution of conformational states in the transport cycle and that this shift could be reversed in part by Zn2+. A major alteration of the conformational equilibrium in Y335A was further supported by a substantial decrease of up to 150-fold in the apparent affinity for cocaine and related inhibitors and a parallel increase of up to 20-fold in the apparent affinity for substrates (20Loland C.J. Norregaard L. Litman T. Gether U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1683-1688Google Scholar). We proposed that Tyr-335 is part of a network of intramolecular interactions, possibly in the gating domains themselves, that is important for stabilizing the transporter in a conformational state that maintains the structural integrity of the inhibitor binding site and to which extracellular substrate can bind and initiate transport (20Loland C.J. Norregaard L. Litman T. Gether U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1683-1688Google Scholar). If this hypothesis is correct, mutation of other residues might display a similar phenotype as the Y335A mutation, due to their participation in the same network of regulatory intramolecular interactions. In this study, we have sought to test this hypothesis and accordingly to identify additional intracellular residues with a similar phenotype as Y335A. In agreement with our prediction, we identify three residues of 16 mutated charged or bulky residues on the predicted intracellular face of the transporter with such a phenotype. These residues are either in the same loop as Tyr-335, ICL 3, or in the “adjacent” ICL 2 and ICL 4. Furthermore, we establish a structural read-out of the conformational state of the mutant transporters by using the reactivity of a cysteine engineered into position 159 in TM 3. This position was chosen based on recent observations by Rudnick and co-workers (17Chen J.G. Rudnick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1044-1049Google Scholar) in the homologous SERT and NET indicating that the accessibility of the corresponding residue (position 155 in NET and 179 in SERT) to the positively charged sulfhydryl-reactive compound MTSET ([2-(trimethylammonium)-ethyl]-methanethiosulfonate) is dependent on whether the transporter assumes an outward facing conformation or an inward facing conformation. Consistent with our hypothesis, the accessibility data provide direct structural support for an alteration in the conformational equilibria of the mutant transporters that can be reversed in part by Zn2+ Site-directed Mutagenesis—We generated a synthetic hDAT (syn-DAT) gene that encodes a protein with an amino acid sequence identical to that of hDAT WT, but the nucleotide sequence was altered to increase the number of unique restriction sites and to optimize codon utilization. The nucleotide sequence of this construct and its generation will be described elsewhere. 2L. Shi and J. A. Javitch, manuscript in preparation. We have used this synthetic construct in previous work, and its expression and function are identical to DAT encoded by the wild type DAT gene (10Hastrup H. Karlin A. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10055-10060Google Scholar, 21Saunders C. Ferrer J.V. Shi L. Chen J. Merrill G. Lamb M.E. Leeb-Lundberg L.M. Carvelli L. Javitch J.A. Galli A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6850-6855Google Scholar). The E2C background was generated by mutation in the synDAT background of Cys-90 and Cys-306 to alanine. These two endogenous cysteines were previously demonstrated to be accessible to charged sulfhydryl reagents applied extracellularly (15Ferrer J. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9238-9243Google Scholar). This construct was designated “E2C,” because the two extracellular cysteines were mutated. The synDAT gene and synDAT E2C gene were subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) using the restriction sites for KpnI and XbaI. All mutations were generated by two-step PCR mutagenesis using Pfu polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI) with either synDAT WT or synDAT E2C as templates. The mutant PCR fragments were digested with the appropriate enzymes and cloned into the expression vector, purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and ligated into the vector using the TaKaRa ligation kit (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan). All mutations were confirmed by restriction enzyme mapping and DNA sequencing using an ABI 310 automated sequencer according to the manufacturer's instructions. Indexing of Residues—A generic numbering scheme for amino acid residues in the family of Na+/Cl–-coupled transporters has recently been proposed to facilitate direct comparison of positions between the individual members of the transporter family (22Goldberg N.R. Beuming T. Weinstein H. Javitch J.A. Bräuner-Osborne H. Schousboe A. Structure and Function of Neurotransmitter Transporters. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2003: 213-234Google Scholar). According to this scheme the most conserved residue in each transmembrane segment has been given the number 50, and each residue is numbered according to its position relative to this conserved residue. For example, 1.55 indicates a residue in TM1 five residues carboxyl-terminal to the most conserved residue in this TM (Trp1.50). For the DAT, the most conserved residues in each transmembrane domain is as follows: TM1, Trp-84; TM2, Pro-112; TM3, Tyr-156; TM4, Cys-243; TM5, Leu-287; TM6, Gln-317; TM7, Phe-356; TM8, Phe-412; TM9, Gly-468; TM10, Gly-500; TM11, Pro-529; TM12, Gly-561. The generic numbers for residues mutated in this study are (in superscript): Arg-601.26, Glu-611.27, Phe-1232.61, Ile-1593.53, Lys-2604.67, Lys-2645.27, Tyr-3356.68, Tyr-3437.28, Arg-3446.29, Asp-3456.30, Asp-4218.59, Glu4288.66, Asp-4369.18, Glu-4379.19, Phe-4389.20, Asp-50710.57, Tyr-51911.40, and Tyr-57812.67. In E2C we have mutated Cys-901.56 and Cys-3066.39. Expression in COS-7 Cells—COS-7 cells were maintained at 37 °C in 10% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 0.01 mg/ml gentamicin (all from Invitrogen). WT and mutant transporters were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells by the calcium phosphate precipitation method as previously described (23Johansen T.E. Scholler M.S. Tolstoy S. Schwartz T.W. FEBS Lett. 1990; 267: 289-294Google Scholar, 24Gether U. Marray T. Schwartz T.W. Johansen T.E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 241-244Google Scholar). [3H]Dopamine Uptake Experiments—Uptake assays were performed as modified from Giros et al. (25Giros B. el Mestikawy S. Godinot N. Zheng K. Han H. Yang-Feng T. Caron M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 383-390Google Scholar) using 2,5,6-[3H]dopamine (7–21 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Biosciences). The uptake assays were carried out 2 days after transfection of transiently transfected COS-7 cells. Twenty hours after transfection, the cells were plated in poly-d-lysine-coated 24- or 12-well dishes (1 or 3 × 105 cells/well, respectively) depending on the expression level of the particular mutated transporter to achieve an uptake level of 5–10% of total added [3H]dopamine. Prior to the experiment, the cells were washed once in 500 μl of uptake buffer (25 mm HEPES adjusted to pH 7.4 upon addition of 130 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4,1mml-ascorbic acid, 5 mm d-glucose, and 1 μm of the catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor Ro 41-0960 (Sigma) at room temperature. Non-labeled compounds (dopamine, norepinephrine, Zn2+, CFT (2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-fluorophenyl)tropane), cocaine, or GBR 12,909) were added to the cells at the indicated concentrations. When the cells were co-incubated with 10 μm Zn2+ and the indicated non-labeled compound, Zn2+ was added to the uptake media prior to the addition of non-labeled compound. Uptake was initiated by addition of 50–90 nm [3H]dopamine in a final volume of 500 μl of uptake buffer. After 10 min of incubation at 37 °C, the cells were washed twice with 500 μl of ice-cold uptake buffer, lysed in 300 μl of 1% SDS, and left for 1 h at 37 °C. All samples were subsequently transferred to 24-well counting plates (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) followed by addition of 600 μl of Opti-phase HiSafe 3 scintillation fluid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The samples were counted in a Wallac Tri-Lux β scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Nonspecific uptake was determined in the presence of 1 mm dopamine (RBI, Natick, MA). All determinations were performed in triplicate. [3H]Norepinephrine Uptake Experiments—Assays were performed as described above for [3H]dopamine uptake experiments, except that the [3H]dopamine was substituted by 40–80 nm [7,8-3H]norepinephrine (6–12 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Biosciences). Surface Biotinylation—Biotinylation of cell surface proteins was performed essentially as described (26Granas C. Ferrer J. Loland C.J. Javitch J.A. Gether U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4990-5000Google Scholar) by reaction with the membrane impermeant amine-specific biotinylating reagent sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce). Transfected COS-7 cells were seeded in poly-d-lysine-coated 100-mm cell culture dishes (Corning) at 2.5 × 106 cells/dish and grown for 24 h before the experiment. The cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline/Ca-Mg (pH 7.3), before treatment with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (1.5 mg/ml) at 4 °C for 40 min in phosphate-buffered saline/Ca-Mg followed by three washes with TBS (0.05 m Tris, pH 7.4, 0.3 m NaCl) and three washes with phosphate-buffered saline/Ca-Mg. The cells were solubilized in 1 ml of solubilization buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, with 1.0% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmN-ethylmaleimide, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Diagnostics)), scraped off and left for 30 min at 4 °C with constant shaking. Lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the protein concentration in the supernatants was determined using the BCA assay kit (Pierce). Monomeric avidin beads (175 μl) (Pierce) were added to 500 μg of total protein from each sample. The volume was adjusted to 1.0 ml with solubilization buffer and the samples were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were washed four times with 800 μl of solubilization buffer, before elution with 50 μl of 2× loading buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 10% SDS, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, and 0.2% bromphenol blue) for 30 min at 37 °C. The eluates (25 μl) were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10%) and immunoblotted with the rat monoclonal antibody MAB 369 directed against the NH2 terminus of the hDAT (Chemicon) diluted 1:1000. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using goat anti-rat horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000) and Pico Luminescence (Pierce). Quantification of bands was performed by densitometry measures using Scion Image (Scion, Frederick, MD) using film exposures that were in the linear range. MTSET Experiments—Two days after transfection, cells seeded in 12- or 24-well plates were washed once with 500 μl of uptake buffer (see above). The cells were subsequently incubated with 0.5 mm MTSET ([2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate) (Toronto Research Chemicals, Toronto, Canada) (unless another concentration is indicated) at 37 °C for 10 min. The stock MTSET solution was freshly prepared in H2O and immediately diluted 10-fold by application to the transfected cells into a final volume of 500 μl of uptake buffer. After incubation, the cells were washed twice in 500 μl of uptake buffer before initiation of [3H]dopamine uptake, performed as described above. The effects of substrates and blockers on MTSET reactivity were investigated by the addition of 100 μm dopamine or 10 μm cocaine immediately prior to the addition of MTSET. Subsequently, the cells were washed twice in 500 μl of uptake buffer before initiation of [3H]dopamine uptake assay. Data Calculations—Uptake data and binding data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis using Prism 3.0 from GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA. The IC50 values used in the estimation of Km for uptake were calculated from means of pIC50 values and the S.E. interval from the pIC50 ± S.E. The KI values were calculated from the IC50 values using the equation KI = IC50/(1 + (L/Km)), L = concentration of [3H]dopamine. One-way analysis of variance followed by Newman-Keuls multiple comparison post-hoc test was used for statistical comparisons of the response to MTSET treatment. To achieve an exact measure for the low specific transporter-mediated [3H]dopamine uptake for the E2C I159C/Y335A mutant with no Zn2+ present, an uptake experiment on mock-transfected COS-7 cells was performed in parallel. The nonspecific uptake in these cells was subtracted from the total uptake in E2C I159C/Y335A expressing cells. The nonspecific uptake was less than 20% of total uptake in E2C I159C/Y335A. Mutation of Selected Intracellular Residues in the hDAT—To identify residues that upon mutation might display the same phenotype as our previously described Tyr-335 to alanine mutation (Y335A), we selected 16 residues distributed throughout the intracellular domain of the hDAT (Fig. 1). First, we selected a series of tyrosines and phenylalanines that were either conserved in all or in many of the mammalian Na+/Cl–-coupled transporters (Fig. 2): Phe-123 in ICL 1; Tyr-343 in ICL 3; Phe-438 in ICL 4; Tyr-519 in ICL 5; and Tyr-578 in the COOH terminus (for the generic number of these residues according to the numbering scheme proposed by Goldberg et al. see indexing under “Materials and Methods”). Next we selected a series of highly conserved charged residues because we hypothesized that such residues might be involved in important intramolecular interactions critical for maintaining the proper conformational equilibrium of the transport cycle. The selected residues included: Arg-60 and Glu-61 in the NH2 terminus; Lys-260 and Lys-264 in ICL 2; Arg-344 and Asp-345 in ICL 3; Asp-421, Glu-428, Asp-436, and Glu-437 in ICL 4; and Asp-507 in ICL5. As is apparent from the alignment in Fig. 2, our selection of residues was representative but was not a comprehensive selection of all the conserved intracellular residues in the DAT with a bulky or charged side chain. The selected residues were mutated to alanine one at a time and functionally characterized after transient expression in COS-7 cells. As shown in Table I, all the mutants were functional as assessed by measurement of [3H]dopamine uptake. Like 335A, several mutants, including K264A, D345A, D436A, F438A, and D507A, displayed a substantially lowered Vmax (<10% of WT). Also similar to Y335A, the K264A, D345A, and D436A mutations displayed lower Km values than the WT (7–9-fold) but this was not the case for F438A and D507A, which had Km values similar to the WT (Table I). Of the mutants, only one (D421A) had a Km value higher than the WT (8 versus 1.7 μm, Table I).Table IUptake characteristics of hDAT and mutant transportershDAT mutants[3H]DA Vmax[3H]DA Km (S.E. interval)nZn2+ IC50 (S.E. interval)nCFT KI (S.E. interval)nfmol/min/105 cells ± SEnmμmnmhDAT wt9700 ± 4001.7 (1.5-1.9)100.7 (0.5-0.9)744 (40-48)6R60A3000 ± 6001.20 (1.15-1.26)30.6 (0.40-0.8)328 (23-33)3E61A4000 ± 7001.2 (1.0-1.4)40.33 (0.28-0.39)325 (24-26)3F123A2300 ± 5000.87 (0.82-0.93)40.6 (0.5-0.7)321 (20-23)3K260A3900 ± 9001.0 (0.6-1.6)40.5 (0.2-0.9)327 (23-32)3K264A260 ± 400.16 (0.13-0.19)6Potentiation5220 (170-290)8Y335AaData taken from Ref. 20.16 ± 30.13 (0.10-0.17)9Potentiation52600 (2300-3100)5Y343A2900 ± 5000.5 (0.4-0.6)30.87 (0.85-0.90)350 (40-65)3R344A2000 ± 3001.3 (1.1-1.5)30.63 (0.59-0.68)321 (16-27)3D345A350 ± 300.18 (0.16-0.19)7Potentiation5250 (230-290)3D421A3100 ± 12008 (6-9)32.2 (1.4-3.4)3400 (250-660)3E428A1240 ± 2700.49 (0.43-0.56)41.1 (0.9-1.4)376 (66-88)3D436A450 ± 1500.20 (0.16-0.25)5Potentiation5130 (90-190)3E437A1940 ± 4400.6 (0.5-0.8)40.2 (0.1-0.4)433.6 (33.0-34.3)3F438A47 ± 131.0 (0.3-4)31.97 (1.90-2.04)3NDbND, not determined.0D507A850 ± 3801.1 (0.7-1.6)30.6 (0.4-0.8)320 (12-32)3Y519A1360 ± 4000.7 (0.5-0.9)40.8 (0.7-1.0)469 (65-74)3Y578A5800 ± 14001.2 (1.0-1.6)50.7 (0.6-0.8)429 (23-34)4D436A/E437A40 ± 100.08 (0.07-0.10)3Potentiation3100 (60-150)3a Data taken from Ref. 20Loland C.J.

Open table in a new tab Effect of Zn2+on Intracellular Mutants—The effect of Zn2+ on [3H]dopamine uptake mediated by the mutants was subsequently investigated. In the hDAT WT, Zn2+ is a potent non-competitive inhibitor of [3H]dopamine uptake showing a biphasic inhibition curve with an IC50 for the high affinity phase of around 1 μm and >1000 μm for the low affinity phase (Ref. 7Norregaard L.

This cytokine also induces the production of several types of reactive oxygen species, including H2O2. With the use both of HeLa cells expressing wild-type or dominant negative forms of the cytosolic peroxidase peroxiredoxin II and of mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient in this protein, we evaluated the roles of H2O2 in the activation of MAPKs by TNF-α. In vitro kinase assays as well as immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific for activated MAPKs indicated that H2O2 produced in response to TNF-α potentiates the activation of JNK and p38 induced by this cytokine but inhibits that of ERK.

The responses of cells to extracellular stimuli are mediated by a complex system of intracellular signaling. Such signaling thus controls many aspects of cell function, including proliferation, differentiation, and death. Protein kinases and phosphatases are common components of signaling pathways and regulate the function of proteins by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, respectively. Oxidants and antioxidants have also been increasingly recognized as important signaling molecules that modify protein function through oxidation and reduction of redox-sensitive amino acid residues such as cysteine and methionine.

This cytokine induces both proapoptotic and prosurvival effects that are achieved through the activation of various signaling pathways, including those mediated by caspases, nuclear factor-κB, and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). The MAPK pathway is a common signal transduction system and typically comprises a MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK), MAPK kinase (MAPKK), and MAPK. MAPKs function in intracellular signaling by phosphorylating a wide range of effector proteins, most notably transcription factors. On the basis of their structures, MAPKs have been classified into three multimember subfamilies: c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs), p38 MAPKs, and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs). Although the outcomes of MAPK activation depend on the nature of the extracellular signal and on cell type, ERKs tend to influence cell proliferation and survival, whereas JNKs and p38 MAPKs primarily function in responses to stressors such as apoptotic stimuli (4.Martindale J.L.

Like many other extracellular stimuli, TNF-α induces the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), including the superoxide anion (O2·¯) and hydrogen peroxide (7.Meier B. Radeke H.H. Selle S.

The ROS thus produced participate in various TNF-α signaling pathways. A role for ROS in TNF-α-induced activation of JNK and p38 has been demonstrated by various observations. Thus, antioxidants such as N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and thioredoxin (Trx) block TNF-α-induced activation of JNK and p38 in various cell types (8.Lo Y.Y. Cruz T.F. J. Biol.

In contrast, the role of ROS in TNF-α-induced ERK activation has been less well characterized. NAC was shown to inhibit TNF-α-induced activation of ERK as well as of JNK and p38 in macrophages (17.Chan E.D. Winston B.W. Uh S.T. Wynes M.W. Rose D.M. Riches D.W. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 415-422PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, ROS produced in cardiac fibroblasts in response to angiotensin II (18.Sano M. Fukuda K. Sato T. Kawaguchi H. Suematsu M. Matsuda S. Koyasu S. Matsui H. Yamauchi-Takihara K. Harada M. Saito Y. Ogawa S. Circ.

Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2313) Google Scholar) promote the activation of all three types of MAPK through redox-sensitive mechanisms. The ROS initially produced by mitochondria or by NADPH oxidase is O2·¯, which is then converted to H2O2 enzymatically or nonenzymatically. It seems that O2·¯ and H2O2 act differently in signaling pathways as suggested by that T cell receptor-induced ERK activation was enhanced specifically by H2O2 but not by O2·¯, whereas T cell receptor-induced cell death was mediated by O2·¯ but not by H2O2 (20.Devadas S. Zaritskaya L. Rhee S.G. Oberley L. Williams M.S. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). In addition, various stimuli, including TNF-α induce the production of nitric oxide (21.Stadler J. Stefanovic-Racic M. Billiar T.R. Curran R.D. McIntyre L.A. Georgescu H.I. Simmons R.L. Evans C.H. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3915-3920PubMed Google Scholar). Given that antioxidants (such as NAC and Trx) and inhibitors of ROS production (such as diphenyliodonium and dominant negative Rac) affect the intracellular concentrations of several oxidants, including O2·¯, H2O2, and various NO derivatives, studies with these reagents are not able to identify the oxidant species that participate in receptor signaling. Recent study also reveals that NAC inhibits TNF-α-induced NFκB activation not by scavenging ROS but by lowering the affinity of the receptor to TNF-α (22.Hayakawa M. Miyashita H. Sakamoto I. Kitagawa M. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. Karin M. Kikugawa K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3356-3366Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). In contrast, O2·¯ and H2O2 are selectively removed by superoxide dismutase and catalase, respectively, and studies with cells overexpressing these enzymes suggest that both O2·¯ and H2O2 participate in a variety of receptor signaling pathways. For example, overexpression of Mn2+-dependent superoxide dismutase resulted in inhibition of TNF-α-induced activation of caspases, nuclear factor κB, and JNK (23.Manna S.K. Zhang H.J. Yan T. Oberley L.W. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13245-13254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), indicating the O2·¯ acts in various TNF-α signaling pathways. Although the effects of catalase overexpression on TNF-α-induced activation of MAPK pathways have not been described, the effects of catalase on MAPK pathways activated by other stimuli appear to be dependent on stimulant and cell type (19.Sundaresan M.

Instead of catalase, we overexpressed peroxiredoxin (Prx) in these cells to eliminate H2O2 selectively. A dominant negative form of Prx was also constructed to study the effects of diminished H2O2 elimination. Members of the Prx family of peroxidases catalyze the reduction of H2O2 with the use of reducing equivalents provided by Trx (28.Chae H.Z. Robison K. Poole L.B. Church G. Storz G. Rhee S.G. Proc.

Six mammalian isoforms of Prx, which are distributed differentially within cells, have been identified: Prx I, II, and VI are localized to the cytosol; Prx III is restricted to mitochondria; Prx IV is secreted; and Prx V is located in mitochondria and peroxisomes. Prx enzymes are abundant in most cell types (31.Chae H.Z. Kim H.J. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. 1999; 45: 101-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). All Prx proteins exist as obligate homodimers with two identical active sites, and they all contain a conserved Cys residue, corresponding to Cys51 in mammalian Prx I and II, in the NH2-terminal portion of the molecule (28.Chae H.Z. Robison K. Poole L.B. Church G. Storz G. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7017-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, 29.Rhee S.G. Kang S.W. Chang T.S. Jeong W. Kim K.

Most Prx proteins, including four (Prx I–IV) of the six mammalian isoforms, contain an additional conserved Cys residue in the COOH-terminal region that corresponds to Cys172 of mammalian Prx I and II. The Prx enzymes that contain two conserved Cys residues are known as 2-Cys Prxs to distinguish them from the small number of 1-Cys Prxs, which contain only the conserved Cys in the NH2-terminal domain. In 2-Cys Prx enzymes, the NH2-terminal conserved Cys is oxidized by H2O2 to cysteine-sulfenic acid (Cys51-SOH), which then reacts with Cys172-SH of the other subunit of the homodimer to produce an intermolecular disulfide (32.Chae H.Z. Uhm T.B. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7022-7026Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Reduction of the disulfide intermediate is mediated by Trx. In addition to examining the effects of overexpression of wild-type or dominant negative forms of Prx in HeLa cells, we have compared the TNF-α-induced activation of MAPKs in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from wild-type and Prx II knockout animals. Our observations indicate that TNF-α-induced activation of JNK and p38 is positively regulated by H2O2, whereas ERK activation in response to this cytokine is inhibited as a result of H2O2 production. Antibodies, Plasmids, and Reagents—Mouse monoclonal antibodies to the FLAG epitope (M2) were obtained from Sigma; rabbit polyclonal antibodies to JNK1 (C-17), to p38 (C-20), to ERK2 (C-14), and to ASK-1 (H-300) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; and rabbit polyclonal antibodies to phospho-JNK, phospho-ERK, and phospho-p38 were from New England Biolabs. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to human Prx I, II, or III have been described previously (33.Kang S.W. Baines I.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6303-6311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Recombinant human TNF-α was from Life Technologies, and 2′,3′-dihydro-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) and 5(and 6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (CM-H2DCFDA) were from Molecular Probes. An Escherichia coli expression plasmid encoding a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein of c-Jun-(1–79) was provided by N. Holbrook (Yale University Medical School); mammalian expression vectors encoding hemagglutinin epitope (HA)-tagged forms of JNK3 and ERK2 were by J. M. Kyriakis (Harvard University Medical School) and S. Gutkind (National Institutes of Health), respectively; pGEX-4T-1/SEK1 (K129R) was from L. Zon (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard Medical School). A mammalian expression vector for wild-type Prx II, pCRIIWT, has been described (34.Kang S.W. Chae H.Z. Seo M.S. Kim K. Baines I.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6297-6302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). A vector encoding a dominant negative form (C52S,C172S) of Prx II, pCRIIDN, was constructed by standard PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis with pCRIIWT as the template. To add a FLAG tag to the NH2 terminus of Prx II, we prepared a 53-nucleotide primer (5′-AAGCATATGGACTACAAGGACGATGACGATAAGGGTGCCTCCGGTAACGCGCG-3′, FLAG coding sequence underlined) and performed PCR with pCRIIWT or pCRIIDN as the template. The resulting PCR products were subcloned into pCR3.1-Uni to generate pCRIIWT-FLAGN and pCRIIDN-FLAGN, respectively. Construction of a Retrovirus Encoding Prx II—A full-length cDNA for human Prx II was cloned between the XhoI and BamHI sites of a bicistronic retroviral vector (pLXIN, Clontech). The resulting construct was introduced by transfection into RetroPack PT67 cells (Clontech), which were then cultured in the presence of G418 (500 μg/ml) to establish stable retrovirus-producing cell lines. The isolated virus clones were evaluated for the extent of Prx II expression induced after infection of Prx II–/– MEFs. The titer of the chosen clone was ∼2 × 106 plaque-forming units/ml. Cell Culture—The generation of Prx II–/– mice has been described (35.Lee T.H. Kim S.U. Yu S.L. Kim S.H. Park do S. Moon H.B. Dho S.H. Kwo K.S. Han Y.H. Jeong S. Kang S.W. Shin H.S. Lee K.K. Rhee S.G.

The cells were genotyped by Southern blot and PCR analysis of genomic DNA; the PCR primers were 5′-GCTTGGGTGGAGAGGCTATTCG-3′ and 5′-GTAAAGCACGAGGAAGCGGTCAGCC-3′ for the neo cassette and 5′-GATGATCTCCGTGGGGCAAACAAAAGTGAAG-3′ and 5′-ATGGCCTCCGGCAACGCGCAAATCG-3′ for the wild-type allele (35.Lee T.H.

Blood. 2003; 101: 5033-5038Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). MEFs, NIH 3T3 cells, and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with either 10% calf serum (NIH 3T3 cells) or 10% fetal bovine serum (MEFs and HeLa cells) as well as with penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 units/ml). NIH3T3 and HeLa cells were continuously passaged for 2 months after thawing. For generation of stably transfected cell lines, HeLa cells (1 × 106 in 60-mm dishes) were transfected with 6 μg of either pCR3.1, pCRIIWT, or pCRIIDN with the use of SuperFect (Qiagen) and were selected by culture in the presence of G418 (1 mg/ml). The selected clones were maintained in medium containing G418 (0.2 mg/ml). In Vitro Kinase Assays—HeLa cells (1 × 106) that had been maintained in DMEM containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 24 h were stimulated with TNF-α (15 ng/ml), washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and then lysed for 20 min at 4 °C in 1 ml of a lysis buffer containing 25 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0), 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, microcystine-LR (20 ng/ml), 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin (5 μg/ml), and leupeptin (5 μg/ml). For the ASK1 assay, the same lysis buffer used above except that dithiothreitol was omitted. The cells were scraped and further disrupted by vigorous vortex mixing for 1 min. The lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min, and the resulting supernatants were incubated first for 1 h on ice with 1 μg of antibodies to JNK1, to ERK2, or HA, or 4 μg of antibodies to ASK1 and then, after the addition of 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences), overnight at 4 °C. The beads were isolated, washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with kinase reaction buffer (20 mm MOPS-NaOH (pH 7.2), 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.1% Triton X-100), and then incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in 40 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 37.5 μm unlabeled ATP, 0.6 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 6 μg of GST-c-Jun-(1–79) or myelin basic protein (MBP) (Sigma), or 1 μg of GST-SEK1 (KR) as substrate. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 25 μl of 3× SDS sample buffer, and samples were then heated at 95 °C for 5 min and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and the radioactivity incorporated into GST-c-Jun-(1–79), MBP, or GST-SEK1 (KR) was quantified with an image analyzer (PhosphorImager, Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was subsequently subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to JNK1, to ERK2, to HA, or to ASK1 to evaluate the amount of immunoprecipitated kinases. Immunoprecipitation—Crude cell lysates (500 μg of protein in 1 ml) were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B, after which the resin was removed by centrifugation and the resulting supernatants were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 1 μg of antibodies to FLAG. Immune complexes were then isolated by precipitation with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B for 3 h at 4 °C, washed four times with lysis buffer, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Construction of a dominant negative form of Prx II-2-Cys Prx enzymes, which exists as a dimer with the monomers arranged in a head-to-tail manner, and their catalytic cycle requires the formation of intermolecular disulfides between the NH2-terminal conserved Cys (Cys51 of Prx II) of one subunit and the COOH-terminal conserved Cys (Cys172 of Prx II) of the other subunit. We reasoned that a double mutant of Prx II in which both conserved Cys residues were replaced with serine might form a catalytically inactive dimer with wild-type (WT) Prx II and thereby act in a dominant negative manner. To determine whether the Prx II(C51S,C172S), or Prx II(DN), mutant forms a dimer with endogenous Prx II(WT) in cells, we subjected NIH 3T3 or HeLa cells to transient transfection with an expression vector for FLAG-tagged Prx II(WT) or FLAG-tagged Prx II(DN) and subsequently immunoprecipitated the FLAG-tagged proteins with specific antibodies. Endogenous Prx II coprecipitated with either FLAG-Prx II(WT) or FLAG-Prx II(DN), and the mutation did not affect the amount of associated endogenous Prx II (Fig. 1A). These results thus suggested that dimerization between endogenous and FLAG-tagged Prx II proteins does not require disulfide formation. The association between the endogenous and FLAG-tagged Prx II proteins increased with time after transfection and was maximal after transfection for 36 h (Fig. 1A), which was the longest time interval examined. Even at this time point, however, the extent of coprecipitation of the endogenous protein was less than that expected from random dimerization with the FLAG-tagged proteins (Fig. 1A), probably because of the long half-life (>3 days) of Prx II (data not shown) and because dimerization occurs only between those molecules synthesized concurrently. Both FLAG-Prx II proteins also interacted with endogenous Prx I (Fig. 1A), albeit to a lesser extent than with endogenous Prx II; the amino acid sequences or Prx I and II are 87% identical. However, targeting of FLAG-Prx II proteins to mitochondria by expression from the pShooter vector (Invitrogen) did not result in a detectable association with the endogenous mitochondrial Prx III (75% identical to Prx II), even though the targeting was successful (data not shown). To examine whether the Prx II(DN) mutant acts in a dominant negative manner in cells, we measured the intracellular concentration of H2O2 with the use of the oxidant-sensitive fluorescent probe DCF (36.Bae Y.S.

In contrast, the TNF-α-induced accumulation of H2O2 was more pronounced in cells expressing FLAG-Prx II(DN) than in control cells (Fig. 1B), indicating that the mutant protein acts in a dominant negative manner by forming a catalytically incompetent dimer with the endogenous enzyme. Effects Prx II(WT) and Prx II(DN) on TNF-α-induced MAPK Activation—We investigated the effects of ectopic expression of Prx II(WT) or Prx II(DN) on TNF-α-induced MAPK activation in HeLa cell lines stably transfected with the corresponding vectors. The level of Prx II expression in all such cell lines obtained was ∼1.5- to 2.5-fold that of control cells transfected with the empty vector (Fig. 2A). Although we performed several rounds of transfection and G418 selection, we were not able to isolate cell clones expressing the recombinant protein at higher levels. Two clones of each type (CT2 and CT4 for control cells, WT4 and WT12 for Prx II(WT)-expressing cells, and DN10 and DN15 for Prx II(DN)-expressing cells) were chosen for use in subsequent experiments. Untagged Prx II, rather than FLAG-Prx II, was expressed in the WT and DN cell lines, because modification of the NH2- or COOH-terminal regions of the protein inactivates its peroxidase activity. We were thus not able to estimate the extent of heterodimerization between endogenous Prx II and Prx II(DN). Given that mutation of the two conserved Cys residues did not affect heterodimerization and that the abundance of Prx II(DN) was higher than that of endogenous Prx II, more than half of the endogenous protein in DN10 or DN15 cells was likely present in an inactive (heterodimeric) form. We attempted to assess TNF-α-induced changes in H2O2 levels in HeLa cells. Although we treated the cells with up to 100 ng/ml of TNF-α, the increase in DCF fluorescence was too small to allow the assessment of Prx effect (not shown). This was probably because H2O2 is more rapidly eliminated in HeLa cells than in NIH3T3 cells such that not enough H2O2 is accumulated for DCF oxidation. In the commonly used DCF assay method such as that employed for the NIH cells above (see Fig. 1B), because of the limit of sensitivity, it is necessary to allow accumulation of H2O2 for several minutes after agonist stimulation before DCF is introduced to the cells to measure the H2O2 produced. In fact, the concentrations of Prx enzymes are much higher in HeLa cells than in NIH 3T3 cells (not shown). Therefore, we modified the assay to capture the effect of Prx II: HeLa cells were incubated with DCF and TNF-α simultaneously, with DCF oxidation monitored at different time points, in hopes that the H2O2 produced in response to TNF-α would be quenched by DCF before being eliminated by antioxidant enzymes. The shortcoming of the modified procedure is that H2O2 cannot be measured at various times after TNF-α treatment, because DCF and TNF-α are applied simultaneously. Nevertheless, the experiment revealed that DCF oxidation was inhibited by the expression of Prx II(WT) but enhanced by the expression of Prx II(DN) (Fig. 2B). We examined the TNF-α-induced activation of JNK1 in CT2, WT4, and DN10 cell lines. The kinase activity of immunoprecipitated JNK1 was measured with a GST-c-Jun-(1–79) fusion protein as substrate. The TNF-α-induced activation of JNK1 was inhibited by ∼30% in WT4 cells, but was increased about 2-fold in DN10 cells, compared with that apparent in CT2 cells (Fig. 2C). When similar experiments were carried out with CT4, WT12, and DN15, JNK1 activity was reduced by ∼40% in WT12 cells but was increased by ∼60% in DN15 cells compared with that in CT4 cells (data not shown). Given that JNK activity is correlated with the extent of phosphorylation of Thr183 and Tyr185, we also assessed TNF-α-induced JNK activation in CT4, WT12, and DN15 cells by immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific for JNK1 or JNK2 phosphorylated at these two sites (Fig. 2D). The extent of phosphorylation of both p54 and p46 isoforms of JNK1 and JNK2 did not differ substantially between CT4 and WT12 cells but was increased about 2-fold in DN cells. We also studied JNK activation in HeLa cells transiently expressing Prx II(WT) or Prx II(DN) together with HA-tagged JNK3. The kinase activity of HA-JNK3 immunoprecipitated with antibodies to HA was thus measured after treatment of the cells with TNF-α. Overexpression of Prx II(WT) resulted in a small, but dose-dependent, decrease in JNK activity, whereas transient expression of Prx II(DN) had no effect on JNK activity (Fig. 2E). This lack of effect of Prx II(DN) is likely attributable to the fact that, unlike in stably transfected cells, only a small fraction of endogenous Prx II is able to form heterodimers with newly synthesized mutant molecules in the transiently transfected cells (Fig. 1A), and the TNF-α-induced increase in H2O2 was therefore not sufficient to enhance JNK activation. We also examined the activation of p38 in response to TNF-α in the stably transfected cell lines CT2, WT4, and DN10.

https://openalex.org/W2070881021,"Imatinib has emerged as the lead compound for clinical development against chronic myeloid leukemia. Imatinib inhibits the kinase activity of Bcr-Abl, which functions by enhancing the proliferation of hematopoietic precursors and protecting them against apoptosis. Imatinib induces apoptosis of Bcr-Abl positive cells, but how the drug effectively kills these cells remains partially understood. We show here that in K562 cells imatinib i) abolished Bcr-Abl phosphorylation and activity and as a consequence Erk1/2, JNK, and AKT activation; ii) induced mitochondrial transmembrane permeability dissipation; iii) activated caspases 3, 9, and 8, demonstrating that the effect of imatinib is integrated at the mitochondrial level; and iv) triggered caspase-dependent cleavage of Bcr-Abl. Interestingly, imatinib-mediated apoptosis was accompanied by erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. Moreover, phorbol esters inhibited imatinib-induced cell death and promoted differentiation toward the megakaryocytic lineage. Finally, we determined by c-DNA array analysis that more than 20 genes were modulated by imatinib. These genes are involved in both cell death and differentiation programs, and some of them have never been reported before to be expressed or involved in erythroid differentiation. Our results demonstrate that imatinib is responsible for a major modification of the genetic program resulting in death and/or differentiation of K562 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2068703154,"Fas-associated factor-1 (FAF1) is a Fas-binding pro-apoptotic protein that is a component of the death-inducing signaling complex in Fas-mediated apoptosis. Here, we show that FAF1 is involved in negative regulation of NF-κB activation. Overexpression of FAF1 decreased the basal level of NF-κB activity in 293 cells. NF-κB activation induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin-1β, and lipopolysaccharide was also inhibited by FAF1 overexpression. Moreover, FAF1 suppressed NF-κB activation induced by transducers of diverse NF-κB-activating signals such as TNF receptor-associated factor-2 and -6, MEKK1, and IκB kinase-β as well as NF-κB p65, one of the end point molecules in the NF-κB activation pathway, suggesting that NF-κB p65 might be a target molecule upon which FAF1 acts. Subsequent study disclosed that FAF1 physically interacts with NF-κB p65 and that the binding domain of FAF1 is the death effector domain (DED)-interacting domain (amino acids 181–381), where DEDs of the Fas-associated death domain protein and caspase-8 interact. The NF-κB activity-modulating potential of FAF1 was also mapped to the DED-interacting domain. Finally, overexpression of FAF1 prevented translocation of NF-κB p65 into the nucleus and decreased its DNA-binding activity upon TNFα treatment. This study presents a novel function of FAF1, in addition to the previously known function as a component of the Fas death-inducing signaling complex, i.e. NF-κB activity suppressor by cytoplasmic retention of NF-κB p65 via physical interaction.

Niu L.T. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11894-11898Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). FAF1 is able to enhance Fas-induced apoptosis. It has also been demonstrated that FAF1 can initiate apoptosis in the absence of any extrinsic death signals when overexpressed (2.Ryu S.W. Kim E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 1027-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Recently, FAF1 has been demonstrated to be a component of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) in Fas-mediated apoptosis (3.Ryu S.W. Lee S.J. Park M.-Y. Jun J.I. Jung Y.K. Kim E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24003-24010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Although FAF1 has demonstrated its apoptotic potential, it does not contain typical death motifs such as the death domain, death effector domain (DED), and caspase recruitment domain. Instead, FAF1 has sequence motifs that are present in the proteins of the ubiquitination pathway (4.Becker K. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Mattmann C. Tschopp J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). FAF1 has two ubiquitin-homologous domains in its N terminus and a domain (the UX domain) homologous to proteins involved in the ubiquitination pathway. The three-dimensional structure of the UX domain of FAF1 as determined by NMR analysis demonstrates its structural similarity to ubiquitin (5.Buchberger A. Howard M.J. Proctor M. Bycroft M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Despite the amino acid sequence and structural similarities to ubiquitin, functions related to the ubiquitination pathway have not yet been assigned to FAF1. Members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor (TNFR) family such as Fas, TNFR1, and TNFR2 play critical roles in various cellular responses, including cell survival and apoptosis (6.Kitson J. Raven T. Jiang Y.P. Goeddel D.V. Giles K.M. Pun K.T. Grinham C.J. Brown R. Farrow S.N. Nature. 1996; 384: 372-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 7.Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3038) Google Scholar). The initiation of signal transduction by these receptors requires adapter proteins to trigger cytoplasmic signal transduction cascades. The adapter proteins are not always specific to certain types of receptors. For example, the adapter molecule FADD is recruited not only to Fas, but also to TNFR1 and death receptor-3 (8.Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Yu G.L. Lyons R.H. Garg M. Duan D.R. Xing L. Gentz R. Ni J. Dixit V.M. Science. 1996; 274: 990-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). TRAF6 can act as an adapter for the interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor as well as for TNFR2 (9.Cao Z. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar, 10.Song H.Y. Regnier C.H. Kirschning C.J. Goeddel D.V. Rothe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9792-9796Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Different signaling cascades initiate depending on the combination of adapter molecules recruited to the receptors. In TNFR1 signaling, the recruitment of the TRADD·FADD complex leads to the activation of the caspase cascade, resulting in apoptosis, whereas that of the TRADD·TRAF2 complex leads to the activation of NF-κB, resulting in survival (11.Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar, 12.Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar). FLICE-associated huge protein (FLASH) was identified by yeast two-hybrid assay using the duplicated DEDs of caspase-8 as probes, and its DED-recruiting domain interacts with the DED of FADD (13.Imai Y. Kimura T. Murakami A. Yajima N. Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. Nature. 1999; 398: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). FLASH is recruited to the Fas DISC, which is composed of Fas, FADD, and caspase-8. Overexpression of FLASH could potentiate Fas-mediated apoptosis after stimulation, and FLASH has a role in TNF-mediated NF-κB activation via a TRAF2/NIK/IKK-dependent pathway (14.Choi Y.H. Kim K.B. Kim H.H. Hong G.S. Kwon Y.K. Chung C.W. Park Y.M. Shen Z.J. Kim B.J. Lee S.Y. Jung Y.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25073-25076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). FAF1 is similar to FLASH and FADD. Like FLASH, FAF1 binds to the DEDs of FADD and caspase-8 (3.Ryu S.W. Lee S.J. Park M.-Y. Jun J.I. Jung Y.K. Kim E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24003-24010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). FAF1 demonstrates similarity to FADD because both bind to Fas and caspase-8 directly and can enhance Fas-mediated apoptosis (15.Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar, 16.Strasser A. Newton K. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, FADD contains the death domain and DED death motifs, whereas FAF1 does not. Both FLASH and FADD can induce NF-κB activation (13.Imai Y. Kimura T. Murakami A. Yajima N. Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. Nature. 1999; 398: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 17.Hu W.H. Johnson H. Shu H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10838-10844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). We are interested in whether FAF1 modulates the NF-κB pathway as do FLASH and FADD. NF-κB is activated by various stimuli, including TNF, IL-1, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (18.Baldwin Jr, A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). NF-κB regulates the expression of genes involved in the immune response, inflammatory process, and apoptosis (19.Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar, 20.Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3464) Google Scholar). NF-κB signals subsequently activate two subunit kinases, IKKα and IKKβ (21.Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar, 22.Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M.

Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of IκB proteins leads to their ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26 S proteasome. After degradation of IκB, free NF-κB translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and activates NF-κB-dependent genes (24.DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated whether FAF1 is involved in NF-κB activity modulation. We demonstrate that FAF1 can inhibit NF-κB activation by divergent signals, including TNFα, IL-1β, and LPS. This suppression of NF-κB activity is contributed by the protein interaction between FAF1 and NF-κB p65, leading to the inhibition of NF-κB activation by preventing the translocation of NF-κB p65 to the nucleus. Plasmids—Human FAF1 and its deletion mutant expression vectors were described previously (2.Ryu S.W. Kim E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 1027-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). pRK-TRAF2, pRK-TRAF6, pRK-TNFR1, pcDNA3.1-NF-κB-p65, the Ig-κB-luc plasmid, the pGL2-cIAP2–247-luc plasmid (25.Hong S.Y.

Lee (Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea). pFLAG-IKKβ was a gift from Dr. Hiroyasu Nakano (Juntendo University, Tokyo, Japan). The AP-1-luc plasmid and the pFC-MEKK1 expression vector were purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) (26.Park K.J. Choi S.H. Lee S.Y. Hwang S.B. Lai M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13122-13128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For construction of antisense FAF1, the primers used for PCR amplification were 5′-GAACTCGAGATGGCGTCCAACATGGAC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-GCGCGAATTCTTACTCTTTTGCTTCAAGG-3′ (reverse primer). The amplified fragments were digested with XhoI and EcoRI and introduced into the pFLAG expression vector in an antisense orientation relative to that of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. Cell Lines and Transfections—293, NIH3T3, and NIH3T3-p65–/– cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/10-cm plate, allowed to attach overnight, and then transfected with the indicated constructs using the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (2.Ryu S.W. Kim E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 1027-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Luciferase Reporter Gene Assays—To determine whether FAF1 modulates NF-κB activation by various signals, 293 cells were transfected with 1 μg of test plasmid, 0.1 μg of Ig-κB-luc reporter plasmid, and 0.1 μg of CMV-β-galactosidase plasmid. To demonstrate that the action of FAF1 on NF-κB is specific, 0.1 μg of AP-1-luc plasmid, 0.5 μg of pGL2-cIAP2–247-luc plasmid, and 0.5 μg of pGL2-cIAP2–247(mκB1,3)-luc reporter plasmid were tested as controls. The total DNA concentration in each transfection was kept constant by adjusting with the empty vector. Cells were left untreated or were stimulated at 36 h post-transfection with TNFα (20 ng/ml), IL-1β (20 ng/ml), or LPS (100 ng/ml) for 6 h. The cell lysates were assayed for luciferase activities according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Madison, WI). Transfection efficiencies were normalized by measuring β-galactosidase activities. Immunoprecipitation and Antibodies—At 48 h post-transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and then sonicated using a Branson Model 450 sonifier. The cell lysates was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min, and the protein concentrations of the cell lysates were determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. 100 μg of supernatant was incubated for 4 h with 1 μg of anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (mAb) M2 (Sigma). The samples were further incubated with 30 μl of protein A/G Plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed five times with lysis buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Immunocomplexes were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and analyzed by Western blotting using the appropriate primary antibodies and secondary antibodies coupled to peroxidase. Proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). The antibodies used were as follows: anti-FLAG mAb M2, anti-β-tubulin mAb, and anti-β-actin mAb (Sigma) and rabbit anti-p65 polyclonal antibody (pAb) H10 and polyclonal anti-goat and anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Mouse anti-FAF1 mAb was provided by Dr. Jong-Seok Lim (Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Daejeon, Korea). For detection of endogenous binding between FAF1 and NF-κB p65, 293, NIH3T3, and NIH3T3-p65–/– cells were treated with or without TNFα for 30 min. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer, and 100 μg of supernatant was incubated with anti-FAF1 mAb and mouse IgG1, respectively, for 4 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were collected by incubation with protein A/G Plus-agarose for 2 h at 4 °C and then analyzed by Western blotting as described above. GST Pull-down Assay—293 cells were transfected with 1 μg of pcDNA3.1-NF-κB-p65 by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. At 48 h post-transfection, cells were harvested in lysis buffer as described above. GST-FAF1 deletion mutant fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells and purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Peptron, Daejeon) as specified by the manufacturer. For binding assay, 100 μg of cell lysate was incubated with 1 μg of either GST or GST-FAF1 deletion mutant fusion protein for 4 h at 4 °C in lysis buffer. Samples were washed four times with lysis buffer, and the bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blotting with rabbit anti-NF-κB p65 pAb H10. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—293 cells were transfected with pFLAG-FAF1 and harvested, and nuclear extracts were then prepared as described previously (27.Lee S.Y. Reichlin A. Santana A. Sokol K.A. Nussenzweig M.C. Choi Y. Immunity. 1997; 7: 703-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed as described (26.Park K.J. Choi S.H. Lee S.Y. Hwang S.B. Lai M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13122-13128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, synthetic oligonucleotides were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP and incubated with nuclear proteins (4 μg) at room temperature for 30 min in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.5), 5% glycerol, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 5% Nonidet P-40) for 20 min at room temperature, and the protein·DNA complexes were loaded onto a 5% native polyacrylamide gel and detected by autoradiography. To measure NF-κB activation, an end-labeled, double-stranded, NF-κB-specific oligonucleotide probe containing the two NF-κB tandem repeats derived from the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat (5′-ATCAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCG-3′) was used (27.Lee S.Y. Reichlin A. Santana A. Sokol K.A. Nussenzweig M.C. Choi Y. Immunity. 1997; 7: 703-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). For control experiments, the region from bp –66 to –48 upstream of the surfactant protein A2 gene transcription initiation site, which contains the GT box (5′-TCTCAGGGGTGGGGAAGAA-3′), was used (28.Young P.P. Mendelson C.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1082-1093PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Fractionation—Nuclear and cytosolic fractions were isolated by differential centrifugation as follows. To prepare the nucleus, 2 × 106 cells were lysed in lysis buffer for 15 min at 4 °C to swell the cells. The cells were passed 10–12 times through a 21-gauge needle, and cell lysates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was solubilized with 200 μl of lysis buffer and used as the nucleus. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to separate the cytoplasmic fraction from the membrane fraction. The supernatant was immediately subjected to Western blot analysis. Overexpression of FAF1 Inhibits NF-κB Activation—To test a possible involvement of FAF1 in the NF-κB activation pathway, we first examined whether overexpression of FAF1 can modulate NF-κB activation using a transient transfection system. As shown in Fig. 1A, overexpression of FAF1 inhibited TNFα-induced NF-κB activity as well as its basal transcriptional activity in 293 cells. Direct targeting of FAF1 expression using antisense FAF1 increased the basal level of NF-κB activation as well as NF-κB activation induced by TNFα. Inhibition of NF-κB by FAF1 was decreased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). To test the specificity of FAF1 for NF-κB, we examined whether FAF1 can modulate the activity of other TNFα-induced transcription complexes such as AP-1. The experiment using the AP-1-luc reporter plasmid showed that FAF1 did not affect AP-1 activity in the presence or absence of TNFα (Fig. 1C, left). As an additional validation regarding the specificity of FAF1 for NF-κB, we experimented using the luciferase reporter containing the NF-κB-binding sites of the cIAP2 promoter (pGL2-cIAP2–247-luc) and the luciferase reporter containing mutant functional NF-κB-binding elements (pGL2-cIAP2–247(mκB1,3)-luc) (25.Hong S.Y.

The cIAP2 gene is transcriptionally regulated by TNFα and other stimuli activating NF-κB. As shown in Fig. 1C (middle and right), FAF1 down-regulated the transcription of pGL2-cIAP2–247-luc, but did not change that of pGL2-cIAP2–247(mκB1,3)-luc. These results verify the specificity of FAF1 for NF-κB. Next, we questioned whether the down-regulation of NF-κB activity is influenced by caspase activation. To address this question, NF-κB activation by overexpression of FAF1 was measured in the presence of a pancaspase inhibitor (benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone) and in cells in which FAF1 and CrmA, a poxvirus-derived specific inhibitor of caspase-8, were cotransfected (29.Zhou Q. Snipas S. Orth K. Muzio M. Dixit V.M. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7797-7800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1D, our data confirm that the down-regulation of NF-κB activity by FAF1 is independent of caspase activities. FAF1 Suppresses NF-κB Activation via Multiple Pathways—We questioned whether FAF1 can exert its negative regulatory effect on diverse NF-κB-activating signals. When overexpressed, FAF1 inhibited TNFα-, IL-1β-, and LPS-mediated NF-κB activation (Fig. 2A). To further determine how FAF1 modulates NF-κB activity, we tested whether FAF1 inhibits NF-κB activation mediated via various signal transducers known to be NF-κB activators downstream of the TNFR superfamily and IL-1 receptor. As shown in Fig. 2B, when overexpressed, FAF1 inhibited TRAF2-, TRAF6-, and MEKK1-mediated NF-κB activation, suggesting that FAF1 might function at a point where divergent signals merge in the NF-κB activation pathways. Certainly, FAF1 inhibited NF-κB activation by overexpression of IKKβ, a component of the IKK complex where divergent NF-κB-activating signals converge, suggesting that FAF1 might function in the IKK complex and/or its downstream components in the NF-κB activation pathway. Indeed, FAF1 inhibited NF-κB activation by overexpression of NF-κB p65, one of the end point molecules in the NF-κB activation pathway. This suggests that NF-κB p65 might be the target molecule upon which FAF1 acts. FAF1 Interacts with NF-κB p65—Based on the fact that FAF1 inhibits NF-κB activation by overexpression of NF-κB p65, we investigated whether FAF1 can physically interact with NF-κB p65. 293 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-NF-κB-p65 with or without pFLAG-FAF1. At 48 h post-transfection, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG mAb. Fig. 3A illustrates that FAF1 can interact with NF-κB p65 directly in 293 cells. To investigate whether FAF1 and NF-κB p65 are endogenously associated, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using total cell lysates. As shown in Fig. 3B, endogenous NF-κB p65 was co-immunoprecipitated with FAF1 from 293 cell lysates induced by TNFα for 30 min. However, anti-FAF1 antibody did not co-immunoprecipitate NF-κB p65 from the lysates of untreated 293 cells. The same experiment was performed with NIH3T3 cells, and equivalent results were obtained. However, no immunoprecipitation of FAF1 was detected in NIH3T3-p65–/– cells. These results suggest that the TNFα signal might have facilitated FAF1 and NF-κB p65 interaction in the cell. The DED-interacting Domain (DEDID) of FAF1 Interacts with NF-κB p65—To determine the FAF1 region responsible for the interaction with NF-κB p65, GST pull-down assay was performed using GST-FAF1 fusion proteins. The extracts of 293 cells transfected with NF-κB p65 were incubated with either GST or GST-FAF1 deletion mutant proteins (Fig. 4A). GST-FAF1 DEDID (amino acids 181–381) and GST-FAF1 bound to NF-κB p65 (Fig. 4B), implying that the DEDID is sufficient for binding. It is worth mentioning that the DEDID is the region where the DEDs of FADD and caspase-8 also bind. To determine whether the binding affects NF-κB activity, pFLAG-FAF1 and pFLAG-FAF1-DEDID were transfected, and NF-κB activity was measured. When overexpressed, the FAF1 DEDID and FAF1 demonstrated NF-κB activity-inhibiting potential (Fig. 4C). FAF1 Inhibits Nuclear Translocation and Decreases the DNA-binding Activity of NF-κB—To determine how FAF1/NF-κB p65 interaction modulates NF-κB activity, we examined the influence of FAF1 on NF-κB activity in gel shift experiments (Fig. 5A). An inducible protein·DNA complex was observed in the nuclear extracts upon TNFα treatment for 20 min. As expected, overexpression of FAF1 decreased significantly the DNA-binding activity, whereas FAF1 had no effect on GT box binding to DNA with or without TNFα treatment (Fig. 5B). We further confirmed the effects of FAF1 on the translocation of NF-κB p65 into the nucleus of 293 cells with or without TNFα stimulation by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5C). TNFα stimulation increased the protein levels of NF-κB p65 in the nucleus. However, FAF1 overexpression decreased significantly the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65, suggesting that FAF1 interferes with NF-κB activity by preventing the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 from the cytoplasm. Our previous study showed that FAF1 functions as a component of the Fas DISC in Jurkat cells (3.Ryu S.W. Lee S.J. Park M.-Y. Jun J.I. Jung Y.K. Kim E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24003-24010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In this study, we carried out experiments to examine whether FAF1 proteins can modulate the signal transduction pathway leading to NF-κB activation, which is required for anti-apoptotic signals. Our study discloses a new function of FAF1. FAF1 negatively regulates NF-κB activation by various extracellular stimuli. This is caused by the cytoplasmic retention of NF-κB p65 by FAF1 via physical interaction. The modulation of NF-κB activation by death-inducing molecules has been reported. FADD, caspase-8, and FLASH were reported not only to induce cell death, but also to activate NF-κB (14.Choi Y.H. Kim K.B. Kim H.H. Hong G.S. Kwon Y.K. Chung C.W. Park Y.M. Shen Z.J. Kim B.J. Lee S.Y.

However, pro-apoptotic molecules such as ASK1 and prostate apoptosis response 4 negatively regulate NF-κB activation (33.Camandola S. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 61: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 34.Mochida Y. Takeda K. Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Amagasa T. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Ichijo H. J. Biol.

Because a pro-apoptotic FAF1 protein inhibits NF-κB activation as do the ASK-1 and PAR-4 proteins, FAF1 can be added to the list of NF-κB-down-regulating proteins with apoptotic potential. There are other proteins that interact with NF-κB p65. Wu et al. (36.Wu W.S. Xu Z.X. Hittelman W.N. Salomoni P. Pandolfi P.P. Chang K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12294-12304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) reported that the promyelocytic leukemia protein PML, a pro-apoptotic protein, represses NF-κB transactivation by interacting with NF-κB p65 in the nucleus. In addition, histone deacetylase-1 and p202 also negatively regulate the transcriptional activity of NF-κB by interacting with NF-κB p65 (37.Min W. Ghosh S. Lengyel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 38.Ashburner B.P. Westerheide S.D. Baldwin Jr, A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7065-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Those are nuclear proteins. In this respect, FAF1 presents a new regulatory mechanism for inhibition of NF-κB activation, i.e. preventing nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 from the cytoplasm. The interaction between FAF1 and NF-κB p65 has been confirmed in two different cell types, i.e. 293 and NIH3T3 cells. The interaction occurred in TNFα-treated cells, but barely in untreated cells, showing that FAF1/NF-κB p65 interaction is tightly regulated and also stressing the physiological importance of this interaction. It is well known that the TNFα signal degrades IκB and frees NF-κB. Thus, it is conceivable that IκB inhibits FAF1/NF-κB p65 binding and that degradation of IκB by the TNFα signal would free NF-κB to bind to FAF1. The DED is a pro-apoptotic signaling domain that mediates NF-κB activation (17.Hu W.H. Johnson H. Shu H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10838-10844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 30.Chaudhary P.M. Jasmin A. Eby M.T. Hood L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5738-5746Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). DED-containing proteins such as caspase-8, caspase-10, and Casper can activate NF-κB. One regulatory mechanism of the DED in the NF-κB pathway occurs via the physical interactions of DED with NF-κB pathway components. Caspase-8 interacts with multiple proteins in the NF-κB pathway, such as receptor-interacting protein, NIK, IKKα, and IKKβ (30.Chaudhary P.M. Jasmin A. Eby M.T. Hood L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5738-5746Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), and activates NF-κB. The FAF1 DEDID interacts with the DEDs of FADD and caspase-8 (3.Ryu S.W. Lee S.J. Park M.-Y. Jun J.I. Jung Y.K. Kim E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24003-24010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Binding of FAF1 to caspase-8 might prevent caspase-8 from binding to the NF-κB pathway components. If FAF1/caspase-8 binding inhibits the interactions of caspase-8 with NF-κB pathway components, FAF1/caspase-8 binding would also reduce the positive influence of caspase-8 on NF-κB activation. Thus, in addition to FAF1/NF-κB p65 binding, FAF1/caspase-8 binding might have additional negative effects on NF-κB activation. FAF1 down-regulates NF-κB activation and promotes apoptosis as a component of the Fas DISC. Even though both activities will drive cells in a pro-apoptotic direction, the relationship between these two activities and whether they converge in the same apoptotic effector molecule are not clear. However, these two activities seem to occur independently based on the fact that down-regulation of NF-κB occurred in the presence of caspase inhibitors. This study shows that FAF1 is involved in dual signaling mechanisms, one via the Fas DISC and the other via down-regulation of NF-κB. Thus, the combined action of the FAF1 protein may enhance the efficacy of receptor-mediated cell death. We thank Dr. Tae H. Lee for various plasmids and helpful suggestions."

In addition to modulation of IKK activity, the NF-κB pathway is also regulated by other processes, including the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of various components of this pathway and the post-translational modification of factors bound to NF-κB-dependent promoters. In this study, we explored the role of the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of components of the IKK complex in the regulation of the NF-κB pathway. IKKγ/NEMO was demonstrated to shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus and to interact with the nuclear coactivator cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP). Using both in vitro and in vivo analysis, we demonstrated that IKKγ/NEMO competed with p65 and IKKα for binding to the N terminus of CBP, inhibiting CBP-dependent transcriptional activation. These results indicate that, in addition to the key role of IKKγ/NEMO in regulating cytokine-induced IKK activity, its ability to shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus and to bind to CBP can lead to transcriptional repression of the NF-κB pathway.

In addition to IKKα and IKKβ, an additional factor known as IKKγ/NEMO is also critical for the activity of the IKK complex. IKKγ/NEMO was initially identified in a genetic complementation assay as a factor that can restore NF-κB activation in cells that are resistant to a variety of stimuli that normally induce the NF-κB pathway (12Yamaoka S.

In humans, mutation of a single copy of the IKKγ/NEMO gene is associated with a syndrome known as incontinentia pigmenti, an X-linked defect that results in lethality in males and granulocytic infiltration of the skin in females (28Smahi A. Courtois G. Vabres P. Yamaoka S. Heuertz S. Munnich A. Israël A. Heiss N.S. Klauck S.M. Kioschis P. Wiemann S. Poustka A. Esposito T. Bardaro T. Gianfrancesco F. Ciccodicola A. D'Urso M.

Another syndrome has been described in humans that is due to mutations in the putative zinc finger domain in the C terminus of IKKγ/NEMO that impair, but do not eliminate, NF-κB function, resulting in an X-linked immunodeficiency syndrome characterized by hyper-IgM production and hypohydrotic ectodermal dysplasia (29Jain A.

Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 67: 1555-1562Google Scholar). Thus, both biochemical and genetic studies indicate a critical role for IKKγ/NEMO in regulating NF-κB activation. Recently, we (32Yamamoto Y. Verma U.N. Prajapati S. Kwak Y.T. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 2003; 423: 655-659Google Scholar) and others (33Anest V. Hanson J.L. Cogswell P.C. Steinbrecher K.A. Strahl B.D. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Nature. 2003; 423: 659-663Google Scholar) demonstrated that, in addition to the cytoplasmic role of the IKK complex, one of its components (IKKα) can also function in the nucleus to stimulate cytokine-induced expression of NF-κB-responsive genes. IKKα was found to interact with CBP and, in conjunction with p65, is recruited in a cytokine-dependent manner to NF-κB-responsive promoters, where it is critical for the phosphorylation and subsequent acetylation of specific residues in histone H3 to activate gene expression (32Yamamoto Y. Verma U.N. Prajapati S. Kwak Y.T. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 2003; 423: 655-659Google Scholar, 33Anest V. Hanson J.L. Cogswell P.C. Steinbrecher K.A. Strahl B.D. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Nature. 2003; 423: 659-663Google Scholar). The nuclear levels of IKKα result from its ability to shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus in a CRM1-dependent fashion (34Birbach A. Gold P. Binder B.R. Hofer E. de Martin R. Schmid J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10842-10851Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that IKKγ/NEMO is present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of HeLa cells and that leptomycin B treatment increases its nuclear localization. This observation suggests that IKKγ/NEMO constitutively shuttles between cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments in a CRM1-dependent manner, as has been demonstrated for other proteins involved in the regulation of the NF-κB pathway (35Huang T.T. Kudo N. Yoshida M. Miyamoto S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1014-1019Google Scholar, 36Johnson C. Van Antwerp D. Hope T.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6682-6693Google Scholar, 37Rodriguez M.S.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7088-7095Google Scholar). Mammalian two-hybrid and in vitro binding assays demonstrated that nuclear IKKγ/NEMO bound to the N terminus of CBP, repressing NF-κB-regulated genes. These studies indicate that IKKγ/NEMO, like IKKα, can regulate NF-κB-dependent gene expression via its interactions with factors in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Cell Lines and Reagents—HeLa and 293 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) and IKKγ/NEMO-/- cells were gifts from Drs. Xiaodong Wong and Michael Karin, respectively. These cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories), 2 mml-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. Polyclonal antibodies directed against IKKα (sc-7182), IKKβ (sc-7607), IKKγ/NEMO (sc-8330), p65 (sc-372), and CBP (sc-583) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Monoclonal antibodies directed against IKKγ/NEMO and transcription factor IIB (BD Biosciences), the Myc epitope (Pharmingen), the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (12CA5, Roche Applied Science), and the FLAG epitope (M2, Sigma) were used in immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. Donkey anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, and anti-goat antibodies conjugated to either fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or rhodamine Red-X were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. Plasmid Constructs—The pCMV5 expression vectors encoding FLAG- or Myc-tagged IKKα, IKKβ, IKKγ, or p65 or HA-tagged CBP were described previously (32Yamamoto Y. Verma U.N. Prajapati S. Kwak Y.T. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 2003; 423: 655-659Google Scholar, 40Yamamoto Y. Kim D.W. Kwak Y.T. Prajapati S. Verma U. Gaynor R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36327-36336Google Scholar, 41Yin M.J. Christerson L.B. Yamamoto Y. Kwak Y.T. Xu S. Mercurio F. Barbosa M. Cobb M.H. Gaynor R.B. Cell. 1998; 93: 875-884Google Scholar). Gal4-CBP constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Tucker Collins, and fusions of the VP16 activation domain with IKKα, IKKβ, or IKKγ/NEMO were constructed in pCMV5 as described previously (32Yamamoto Y. Verma U.N. Prajapati S. Kwak Y.T. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 2003; 423: 655-659Google Scholar). Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-CBP fusions were constructed by generating the desired fragments from full-length CBP using PCR and subsequently cloning these fragments with GST into the pGEX vector (42Gerritsen M.E. Williams A.J. Neish A.S. Moore S. Shi Y. Collins T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2927-2932Google Scholar). All PCR products were verified by DNA sequencing. Expression and Purification of GST-CBP Fusion Proteins—Recombinant GST-CBP fusion proteins were expressed in bacterial strain BL21 and lysed in HMK buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and the bacterial lysates were incubated with 0.5 ml of packed glutathione-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. After three washes, the GST fusion proteins bound to the glutathione beads were stored at 4 °C in HMK buffer. Protein expression was assessed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Luciferase Reporter Assays—293T or HeLa cells were plated at 50% confluence in 6-well tissue culture plates. After 24 h, the cells were transfected using Genejuice transfection reagent (Novagen) with the indicated DNA constructs and a Gal4-luciferase reporter. A Rous sarcoma virus-β-galactosidase expression vector was included in the transfection assays to control for differences in transfection efficiency, and a pCMV5 plasmid was added to standardize DNA quantities. Between 30 and 36 h post-transfection, the cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the reporter activity was measured using the luciferase assay system (Promega). All transfections were performed in duplicate and repeated at least three times. Protein Association and Western Blot Analysis—For GST pull-down analysis with endogenous proteins, whole cell lysates were prepared from HeLa cells in lysis buffer A (40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 6 mm EDTA, 6 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)), and equal protein amount of cell lysate were mixed with beads containing equal protein amount of GST-CBP or -GST and incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rotatory shaker. Following incubation, the beads were extensively washed with HMK buffer, with HMK buffer with 500 mm NaCl, and with HMK buffer with 0.1% Triton X-100, respectively, before a final wash with HMK buffer. Proteins bound to the beads were eluted by adding protein loading buffer and heating to 100 °C for 5 min and resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel; transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences); and probed with antibodies to IKKα, IKKβ, IKKγ/NEMO, and p65. For GST pull-down analysis with transiently expressed proteins, expression plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged IKKα, IKKβ, IKKγ/NEMO, and p65 were transfected into 293T cells. Thirtysix hours post-transfection, whole cell lysates were prepared in PD buffer and incubated with GST-CBP or GST beads, and assays were performed as described above, with the Western blots being probed with anti-FLAG antibody. For immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis, 293T cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding HA-tagged CBP in combination with FLAG-tagged IKKα, IKKβ, IKKγ/NEMO, or p65 or Myctagged IKKγ/NEMO as indicated. Cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer B (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm NaF, and 10 mm Na3VO4). Immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-FLAG antibody or mouse IgG as a control, and the precipitates were captured on protein A-agarose beads and extensively washed. The bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE; transferred to nitrocellulose membrane; and probed with anti-HA antibody 12CA5, anti-FLAG antibody M2, or anti-Myc antibody as indicated. Western blots were analyzed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) after labeling with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antimouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—The cellular localization of IKKα, IKKβ, IKKγ/NEMO, and p65 was analyzed using both endogenous as well as transiently expressed proteins. For these experiments, HeLa cells and MEFs alone or transfected with expression vectors encoding the indicated Myc epitope-tagged constructs were cultured on coverslips and either untreated or treated with leptomycin B (Sigma) at final concentration of 10 ng/ml for 2 h. Coverslips were washed two times with PBS, and the cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min, followed by a brief permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS. The cells were blocked for 30 min with 3% normal donkey serum in PBS and then incubated for 1 h with primary antibodies as indicated in the figures (diluted 1:50 to 1:200 in 1% normal donkey serum in PBS). The coverslips were washed three times with PBS and then incubated for 1 h with secondary antibodies conjugated to FITC or rhodamine Red-X (diluted 1:400 in 1% normal donkey serum in PBS). Nuclei were visualized by staining for lamin B. Samples were washed three times and then treated with Aquamount (Polyscience), and the results were analyzed using an MRC 1000 laser scanning confocal microscope (Bio-Rad). Cellular Localization of IKKγ/NEMO—Immunofluorescence studies were performed with untreated HeLa cells to analyze the localization of IKKα, IKKβ, IKKγ/NEMO, and p65. As demonstrated previously (32Yamamoto Y. Verma U.N. Prajapati S. Kwak Y.T. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 2003; 423: 655-659Google Scholar), IKKα was localized predominantly in the nucleus, whereas both IKKβ and p65 were localized predominantly in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A). IKKγ/NEMO was found to be localized in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Fig. 1A). As a positive control, TNFα stimulation was found to induce the nuclear translocation of p65, but did not significantly change the cytoplasmic or nuclear distribution of IKKγ/NEMO or IKKα (data not shown). Next, we addressed whether IKKγ/NEMO can constitutively shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, as do other components of the NF-κB pathway, including IKKα (34Birbach A. Gold P. Binder B.R. Hofer E. de Martin R. Schmid J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10842-10851Google Scholar), NF-κB-inducing kinase (34Birbach A. Gold P. Binder B.R. Hofer E. de Martin R. Schmid J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10842-10851Google Scholar), and IκBα and p65 (35Huang T.T. Kudo N. Yoshida M. Miyamoto S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1014-1019Google Scholar, 36Johnson C. Van Antwerp D. Hope T.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6682-6693Google Scholar, 37Rodriguez M.S. Thompson J. Hay R.T. Dargemont C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9108-9115Google Scholar, 38Tam W.F. Lee L.H. Davis L.

HeLa cells were treated with leptomycin B, a selective inhibitor of CRM1-dependent nuclear export (43Ossareh-Nazari B. Bachelerie F. Dargemont C. Science. 1997; 278: 141-144Google Scholar, 44Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Google Scholar), and the localization of IKKγ/NEMO, IKKα, IKKβ, and p65 was then determined. In the presence of leptomycin B, both IKKγ/NEMO and p65 became predominantly localized in the nucleus, without marked changes in the distribution of IKKα and IKKβ (Fig. 1B). To confirm these results, we next evaluated the distribution of Myc-tagged IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ/NEMO expressed in HeLa cells in both the presence and absence of leptomycin B. Similar to the results seen with endogenous IKKγ/NEMO, transfected Myc-tagged IKKγ/NEMO became predominantly localized to the nucleus following leptomycin B treatment (Fig. 2B). No significant change in the distribution of IKKα or IKKβ was noted following leptomycin B treatment (Fig. 2B). Next, we characterized the cellular localization of several Myc-tagged IKKγ/NEMO constructs in the presence and absence of leptomycin B treatment. Expression vectors encoding Myc-tagged wild-type IKKγ/NEMO, an N-terminal truncation mutant (IKKγ/NEMO-(101-412)), and two C-terminal truncation mutants (IKKγ/NEMO-(1-358) and IKKγ/NEMO-(1-306)) were analyzed following their transfection into HeLa cells. All of these IKKγ/NEMO constructs, except IKKγ/NEMO-(1-306), were predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and become localized to the nucleus following leptomycin B treatment (Fig. 3). In contrast, IKKγ/NEMO-(1-306) was present predominantly in the nucleus in both the presence and absence of leptomycin B (Fig. 3). Classical nuclear export sequences contain leucine-rich domains with variations of the motif LXXXLXXLX(L/I) (39Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7088-7095Google Scholar, 43Ossareh-Nazari B. Bachelerie F. Dargemont C. Science. 1997; 278: 141-144Google Scholar, 44Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Google Scholar). IKKγ/NEMO contains the sequence LLXXXLXXL between residues 328 and 336, which is similar, although not an exact match, to a consensus nuclear export sequence. These experiments suggest that a region in the C terminus of IKKγ/NEMO is involved in regulating its nuclear export. IKKγ/NEMO Interacts with CBP—The results of the immunofluorescence studies indicate that IKKγ/NEMO translocated to the nucleus either constitutively or in response to a yet unidentified stimulus. However, no previous studies have indicated a nuclear role of IKKγ/NEMO. Recently, we (32Yamamoto Y. Verma U.N. Prajapati S. Kwak Y.T. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 2003; 423: 655-659Google Scholar) and others (33Anest V. Hanson J.L. Cogswell P.C. Steinbrecher K.A. Strahl B.D. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Nature. 2003; 423: 659-663Google Scholar) demonstrated that IKKα can interact with the N terminus of the coactivator CBP, resulting in the phosphorylation and subsequent acetylation of histone H3, leading to increases in NF-κB-dependent gene expression. Because the N terminus of CBP is also the site of p65 interaction, we hypothesized that IKKγ/NEMO might also interact with CBP to alter NF-κB-regulated gene expression in a manner similar to IKKα and p65. First, the interaction of IKKγ/NEMO and CBP was characterized using the mammalian two-hybrid system. HeLa cells were transfected with a Gal4-luciferase reporter and Gal4-CBP constructs in conjunction with VP16 fusions with IKKγ/NEMO, IKKα, IKKβ, or p65. We have demonstrated previously that the fusion of VP16 with either IKKα or p65 can interact with Gal4-CBP to stimulate luciferase reporter activity (32Yamamoto Y. Verma U.N. Prajapati S. Kwak Y.T. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 2003; 423: 655-659Google Scholar). Luciferase reporter activity assayed at 30-36 h post-transfection demonstrated strong interactions of IKKα, IKKγ/NEMO, and p65 with the N terminus of CBP and only a minimal association of IKKα and IKKγ/NEMO with the C terminus of CBP (Fig. 4A). IKKβ did not interact with CBP (Fig. 4A). It is interesting to note that p65, IKKα, and IKKγ/NEMO could all interact with the N terminus of CBP. Next, the interaction of IKKγ/NEMO with CBP was characterized using in vitro binding assays of HeLa cell lysate with either GST or GST-CBP. HeLa cell lysate was incubated with either GST-CBP or GST immobilized on glutathione beads, and the bound proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis with antibody directed against IKKα, IKKβ, IKKγ/NEMO, or p65. There was strong interaction between IKKγ/NEMO and CBP, which was comparable with those seen with p65 and IKKα (Fig. 4B). Consistent with our previous results (32Yamamoto Y. Verma U.N. Prajapati S. Kwak Y.T. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 2003; 423: 655-659Google Scholar), there was no interaction between IKKβ and CBP (Fig. 4B). Similar experiments were also performed with 293T cell extracts prepared from cells transfec"
https://openalex.org/W2004124455,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a Gram-positive bacterium, encodes a secreted Dsb-like protein annotated as Mtb DsbE (Rv2878c, also known as MPT53). Because Dsb proteins in Escherichia coli and other bacteria seem to catalyze proper folding during protein secretion and because folding of secreted proteins is thought to be coupled to disulfide oxidoreduction, the function of Mtb DsbE may be to ensure that secreted proteins are in their correctly folded states. We have determined the crystal structure of Mtb DsbE to 1.1 Å resolution, which reveals a thioredoxin-like domain with a typical CXXC active site. These cysteines are in their reduced state. Biochemical characterization of Mtb DsbE reveals that this disulfide oxidoreductase is an oxidant, unlike Gram-negative bacteria DsbE proteins, which have been shown to be weak reductants. In addition, the pKa value of the active site, solvent-exposed cysteine is ∼2 pH units lower than that of Gram-negative DsbE homologs. Finally, the reduced form of Mtb DsbE is more stable than the oxidized form, and Mtb DsbE is able to oxidatively fold hirudin. Structural and biochemical analysis implies that Mtb DsbE functions differently from Gram-negative DsbE homologs, and we discuss its possible functional role in the bacterium.

Protein disulfide bonds are often buried and serve to stabilize protein structures. However, partially exposed disulfide bonds in the active sites of protein-disulfide oxidoreductases have a variety of mechanistic roles in protein folding, electron transport, and bioenergetics in organisms ranging from prokaryotes to humans. Most disulfide oxidoreductases contain a conserved thioredoxin-like domain such as in thioredoxin, eukaryotic protein disulfide bond isomerase, glutaredoxin (1Martin J.L. Structure. 1995; 3: 245-250Google Scholar), peroxiredoxins (2Schroder E. Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2465-2468Google Scholar), and disulfide bond-forming proteins (Dsb). 1The abbreviations used are: Dsbdisulfide bond-forming proteinsMtbM. tuberculosis; Rv number, Sanger center notation for each gene in Mtb.1The abbreviations used are: Dsbdisulfide bond-forming proteinsMtbM. tuberculosis; Rv number, Sanger center notation for each gene in Mtb. Except for peroxiredoxins, all of these proteins share a common sequence motif (CXXC) at their active sites.One such family of disulfide oxidoreductases is the Dsb proteins, which are best characterized in Escherichia coli. These proteins reside in the periplasmic space of Gram-negative bacteria (Fig. 1a) and are necessary for the correct folding of many cell envelope proteins (3Missiakas D. Raina S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2465-2471Google Scholar). E. coli DsbE is a thioredoxin-like protein, involved in cytochrome c maturation (4Grovc J. Busby S. Cole J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 332-341Google Scholar). DsbE has been implicated in the reduction of the thiol ether linkers to the heme of apocytochrome c (5Reid E. Cole J. Eaves D.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 51-58Google Scholar), prior to heme ligation by CcmF and CcmH (4Grovc J. Busby S. Cole J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 332-341Google Scholar, 6Fabianek R.A. Hofer T. Thony-Meyer L. Arch. Microbiol. 1999; 171: 92-100Google Scholar). E. coli DsbD is a cytoplasmic transmembrane protein responsible for maintaining DsbE in its reduced state in the periplasm (7Stewart E.J. Katzen F. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5963-5971Google Scholar). E. coli DsbC is a homodimer with disulfide bond isomerase activity that is also kept reduced by the transmembrane protein DsbD (8Rietsch A. Bessette P. Georgiou G. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6602-6608Google Scholar, 9Bessette P.H. Cotto J.J. Gilbert H.F. Georgiou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7784-7792Google Scholar). In contrast, E. coli DsbA is a monomer that catalyzes the oxidation of reduced, unfolded proteins (10Bardwell J.C. McGovern K. Beckwith J. Cell. 1991; 67: 581-589Google Scholar, 11Joly J.C. Swartz J.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10067-10072Google Scholar). DsbA is reoxidized by the transmembrane protein DsbB, which is in turn oxidized by components of the electron transport pathway (12Missiakas D. Georgopoulos C. Raina S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7084-7088Google Scholar, 13Bader M. Muse W. Ballou D.P. Gassner C. Bardwell J.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 217-227Google Scholar). Dsb proteins, in particular DsbA, have been shown to be involved in virulence in toxin-secreting Gram-negative bacteria such as Vibrio cholerae (14Hu S.H. Peek J.A. Rattigan E. Taylor R.K. Martin J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 137-146Google Scholar, 15Manning P.A. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 192: 63-70Google Scholar), Yersinia pestis (16Zav'yalov V.P. Chernovskaya T.V. Chapman D.A. Karlyshev A.V. MacIntyre S. Zavialov A.V. Vasiliev A.M. Denesyuk A.I. Zav'yalova G.A. Dudich I.V. Korpela T. Abramov V.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 571-578Google Scholar), Shigella sp. (17Yu J. Kroll J.S. Microbes Infect. 1999; 1: 1221-1228Google Scholar), and E. coli (18Zhang H.Z. Donnenberg M.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 787-797Google Scholar). Gram-positive bacteria do not have a periplasm, and proteins that are secreted from the cytoplasm are either cell wall-associated or extracellular. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the only Dsb proteins present are homologs to E. coli DsbE (Mtb DsbE or Rv2878c, also known as MPT53) and its redox, transmembrane protein partner, E. coli DsbD (Mtb DsbD or Rv2874), which are depicted in Fig. 1b. The presence of Dsb proteins in Gram-positive bacteria, such as M. tuberculosis, suggests that these proteins are necessary for the correct folding of cell wall-associated and extracellular secreted proteins. Hence, studies of Mtb DsbE may give some insights into the virulence of mycobacteria.M. tuberculosis is a pathogenic bacterium that is responsible for tuberculosis, which is the world's leading cause of adult death by a bacterial infectious disease, with 3 million deaths and 10 million new cases per year (19Raviglione M.C.

A promising group of potential drug targets is the secreted proteins of M. tuberculosis, which are important in the induction and escape from host immune responses and virulence. Mtb DsbE is one such uncharacterized secreted protein. This work presents an example of protein structural analysis leading to functional information.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPurification and Crystallization—A recombinant plasmid producing the mature DsbE (without the signal peptide, residues 30-159) in pQE30 (Qiagen) was constructed as described previously (23Manca C. Lyashchenko K. Wiker H.G. Usai D. Colangeli R. Gennaro M.L. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 16-23Google Scholar). The purification of Mtb DsbE has been previously described (24Wiker H.G. Michell S.L. Hewinson R.G. Spierings E. Nagai S. Harboe M. Microb. Pathog. 1999; 26: 207-219Google Scholar). The purified protein was dialyzed into 0.5 m NaCl and 0.1 m Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, for crystallization trials. The protein crystallized in 2.2 m NH4SO4, 5% isopropyl alcohol, 20% glycerol; the crystals were mounted; and diffraction data were collected under cryoconditions identical to the crystallization conditions. The selenomethionine Mtb DsbE protein was prepared as previously described (25Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Google Scholar) and crystallized under identical conditions to the native protein.Data Collection and Structure Determination and Refinement—A selenomethionine-substituted Mtb DsbE crystal diffracted to 1.5 Å, and a native crystal diffracted to 1.1 Å, both having unit cell dimensions of 60.7 × 60.7 × 80.0 Å with one monomer per asymmetric unit in space group P43212. Data were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (26Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 276: 307-326Google Scholar) and multiwavelength anamolous diffraction phasing proceeded by the usual methods of heavy atom location (SHELDX, available on the World Wide Web at shelx.uni-ac.gwdg.de/SHELX/, maximum likelihood phase refinement (27Collaborative Computational Project 4 Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar), and density modification (28Cowtan K. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 487-493Google Scholar)). Phase extension to 1.1 Å permitted automated model building for all but five residues of the protein with ARP/WARP (29Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Google Scholar) and was refined using SHELXL. Model building was done in O (30Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar), and the final model includes all 134 residues of the monomer.

Pairwise alignments were calculated by the Smith-Waterman algorithm. Similar protein structures were searched for using DALI (31Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Google Scholar) and aligned with combinatorial extension (32Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 739-747Google Scholar). Electrostatic and surface area calculations were performed with WebLabViewer.Oxidation and Reduction of Mtb DsbE—To oxidize Mtb DsbE, 10 mm GSSG was added to Mtb DsbE in 0.5 m NaCl and 0.1 m Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The oxidized protein was then isolated by gel filtration in its original buffer. To reduce Mtb DsbE, 100 mm dithiothreitol was added to Mtb DsbE in 0.5 m NaCl and 0.1 m Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The reduced protein was then isolated by gel filtration in its original buffer. To ensure total reduction or oxidation, samples of the treated Mtb DsbE were run on an SDS-PAGE gel with no dithiothreitol present, because oxidized samples migrate faster than reduced samples under nonreducing conditions.Redox Properties of Mtb DsbE: Comparison with Glutathione—The in vitro redox state of Mtb DsbE was assayed as described (33Rossmann R. Stern D. Loferer H. Jacobi A. Glockshuber R. Hennecke H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 249-254Google Scholar, 34Loferer H. Wunderlich M. Hennecke H. Glockshuber R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26178-26183Google Scholar). In this assay, the change in fluorescence intensity (excitation wavelength 280 nm) was measured at the wavelength of maximum emission (356 nm for Mtb DsbE). Experiments were carried out in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 1.0 mm EDTA. Oxidized and reduced Mtb DsbE were incubated at 25 °C in the presence of 0.1 mm GSSG and varying concentrations of GSH (0-10 mm) for 12 h before recording the fluorescence emission on a Spex Fluorolog (Jubin Yvon-Spex). The equilibrium concentrations of GSH and GSSG were calculated according to Equations 1, 2, 3,[GSH]=[GSH]0-2R[DsbE]0(Eq. 1) [GSSG]=[GSSG]0-R[DsbE]0(Eq. 2) R=(F-Fox)/(Fred-Fox)(Eq. 3) where [GSH]0 and [GSSG]0 represent the initial concentrations of GSH and GSSG, R is the relative amount of reduced protein at equilibrium, [DsbE]0 is the initial concentration of Mtb DsbE in the oxidized form, F is the fluorescence intensity, and Fox and Fred are the fluorescence intensities of completely oxidized and reduced protein. The equilibrium constant Keq was estimated from nonlinear regression analysis of the data according to the Nernst equation (Equation 4).R=([GSH]2/[GSSG])/(Keq+[GSH]2/[GSSG])(Eq. 4) From the equilibrium constant and by using the glutathione standard potential (E′0 GSH/GSSG = -240 mV) (35Aslund F. Berndt K.D. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30780-30786Google Scholar), the standard redox potential (E′0) was calculated with Equation 5.E0'=E0GSH/GSSG'-RTnFlnKeq(Eq. 5) in which F represents Faraday's constant, n is the number of electrons transferred, and RT is the product of the gas constant and the absolute temperature.Redox Properties of Mtb DsbE: Comparison with Disulfide Bond Isomerase Protein, DsbC—The redox potential of Mtb DsbE was determined by the method of protein-protein redox equilibria developed by Aslund (35Aslund F. Berndt K.D. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30780-30786Google Scholar), as modified by Collet and Bardwell (36Collet J.F. Riemer J. Bader M.W. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26886-26892Google Scholar). The protein used as a standard was E. coli DsbC, which has a redox potential (E′0)of -135 mV (37Zapun A. Missiakas D. Raina S. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5075-5089Google Scholar). In short, equimolar amounts of oxidized DsbC and reduced Mtb DsbE were incubated in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 350 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA at 25 °C. After different time points, samples were analyzed by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (2695 separations module; Waters). The oxidized and reduced forms of each protein were separated on a Phenomenex Primesphere 5-μm C8 column (buffer A: 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water; buffer B: 30% methanol, 60% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). Separation of oxidized and reduced forms of DsbC and Mtb DsbE was achieved using a linear gradient from 53 to 62% B over 450 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. For evaluation of the redox potential, peak areas were analyzed using PeakFit (Systat), and the redox potential was calculated as described previously (35Aslund F. Berndt K.D. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30780-30786Google Scholar).Determination of pKaof Cys36—The pH-dependent ionization of the Cys36 thiol (solvent-exposed) was followed by the specific absorbance of the thiolate anion at 240 nm as described earlier (9Bessette P.H. Cotto J.J. Gilbert H.F. Georgiou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7784-7792Google Scholar). As a control, the pH-dependent absorbance for the oxidized form of Mtb DsbE was recorded. To avoid precipitation artifacts and to minimize buffer absorbance, a buffer system consisting of 10 mm K2PO4, 10 mm boric acid, 10 mm sodium succinate, 1 mm EDTA, and 200 mm KCl (containing 100 μm dithiothreitol for the reduced protein) was used. The pH (initial value of 8.5) was lowered to 2.2 by the stepwise addition of aliquots of 0.1 m HCl, and the absorbance at 240 and 280 nm was recorded and corrected for the volume increase. Samples had an average initial protein concentration of ∼30 μm. The pH dependence of the thiolate-specific absorbance signal (S = (A240/A280)reduced/(A240/A280)oxidized) was fitted according to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (Equation 6), in which SAH represents the corrected absorption intensity of the fully protonated form, and SA - is that of the fully deprotonated form.S=SAH(SA--SAH)/(1+10(pKa+pH))(Eq. 6) Determination of Unfolding/Folding Equilibrium—The reversible guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl)-induced unfolding/folding of Mtb DsbE was performed by measuring the CD ellipticities at 222 nm (38Hennecke J. Spleiss C. Glockshuber R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 189-195Google Scholar). The spectrum of the reduced form was recorded in the presence of 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. For unfolding equilibrium, Mtb DsbE (final concentration of 7 μm) was dissolved in difference concentrations of GdnHCl and incubated for 3 h at 25 °C. Data were analyzed according to the two-state assumption (39Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Google Scholar, 40Wunderlich M. Jaenicke R. Glockshuber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 559-566Google Scholar). The standard changes of folding free energy were calculated according to Equation 7.ΔGfold0=-RTlnKeq(Eq. 7) The difference in stability between the oxidized and reduced forms of DsbE protein was calculated as in Equation 8.ΔΔGfold=ΔGfold,ox0-ΔGfold,red0(Eq. 8) Oxidase activity of Mtb DsbE: Refolding of Hirudin—Hirudo medicinalis hirudin (Sigma) refolding was performed as described (41Hennecke J. Sebbel P. Glockshuber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1197-1215Google Scholar). Reduced, unfolded hirudin (28 μm) was incubated with 84 μm oxidized Mtb DsbE in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA at 25 °C. At different time points, 100-μl samples were removed, and the reaction was quenched by the addition of 20 μl of formic acid and 20 μl of acetonitrile, respectively. The samples were than analyzed using a Phenomenex Primesphere 5-μm C18 column using a gradient from 30 to 37% D with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 70 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Buffer C was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in an aqueous solution, and buffer D was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 80% acetonitrile. Peaks were detected using the Waters W474 fluorescence detector with 274-nm excitation and 325-nm emission wavelength settings.RESULTSOverall Structure of Mtb DsbE—The crystal structure of Mtb DsbE consists of a main domain that contains a thioredoxin fold, with its distinct structural motif consisting of a fourstranded β-sheet made up of β3, β4, β6, and β7 and three flanking α-helices corresponding to α3, α5, and α6 (Fig. 2a). In addition to the thioredoxin fold domain, a short 310-helix (α1), two β-strands (β1 and β2), and another short 310-helix (α2) appear at the N terminus. A long α-helix (α4) and a β-strand (β5) (forming a five-stranded β-sheet) are found after the β3-α3-β4 motif of the thioredoxin fold.Fig. 2Three-dimensional structure of Mtb DsbE and sequence comparisons of DsbE homologs.a, ribbon diagram of the monomer. α-Helices, 310-helices, and β-strands are shown in red, purple, and blue, respectively.

This image was generated using RIBBONS. b, The Mtb DsbE active site; a view of the final 2Fo - Fc electron density map at the active site region. The electron density is contoured at 1.2σ. The distance between the two Cys sulfur atoms is 3.69 Å. This image was generated using RIBBONS. c, sequence comparison of DsbE homologs. The first and second diagrams depict the B. japonicum DsbE monomer (blue; sequence also in blue) and the Mtb DsbE monomer (red; sequence also in red) in terms of secondary structure elements, respectively. Residues labeled with a number sign have two distinct conformations in the Mtb DsbE structure. Residues with a dollar sign are the residues that form a hydrogen bond between α-helix 3 and β-strand 3. The sequence alignment of DsbE homologs was made with ClustalW. The DsbE proteins cluster into two main groups, Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive bacteria, with the extremophile (D. radiodurans) separating the two groups. The yellow boxes show blocks of conserved residues in the Gram-negative bacterium that are not seen in Gram-positive bacterium.

A disulfide bond linking the two residues would be expected to have a distance of 2.03 ± 0.25 Å between the two Sγ atoms (42Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Google Scholar). The cysteines adopt a right-handed hook confirmation at the N terminus of helix α3, which is consistent for the active site cysteines in the thioredoxin superfamily fold. Only the Sγ atom of Cys36 in the dithiol is exposed on the protein surface, whereas Sγ of Cys39 is buried, which is usual for a thioredoxin superfamily protein. The sulfur atom of Cys36 is stabilized by hydrogen bonds to the Oϵ1 atom of Gln100 (3.05 Å) and to the amide nitrogen atom of Pro37 (3.34 Å) and the amide nitrogen atom of Phe38 (3.35 Å); the Sγ atom of Cys39 is not in a hydrogen-bonding network but does have a hydrophobic interaction with conserved cis-Pro101 (4.15 Å) as does Cys36.Crystallographic Dimeric Contacts—There is a crystallographic homodimeric interface that could possibly be in the transient heterodimer interface for oxidoreductase activity, especially since the interface is in the vicinity of the CXXC active site region. The surface area of each monomer is 6400 Å2, and the buried surface area of each monomer at the interface is 600 Å2, which is ∼10% of the total surface area and corresponds to a transient homodimeric interface (43Nooren I.M. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 991-1018Google Scholar). A π-cation interaction occurs between the aromatic ring of Trp35′ and the active site, Cys36 (the prime on position 35′ indicates that this residue is on the neighboring molecule). Arg64 from one monomer buries itself into the other monomer, forming hydrogen bonds with symmetry-related residues. The NH1 and NH2 atoms of Arg64 both hydrogen-bond to atom Nϵ1 of Trp99′ and the oxygen atom of Asn117′ respectively, via a water molecule, and both hydrogen-bond to the oxygen atom of Gln100′. Furthermore, the Nϵ atom of Arg64 interacts with the oxygen atom of Pro118′. Other notable homodimer interface hydrogen bonds are atom Nϵ1 of Trp99 to atoms Oϵ1 of Gln100′ and to the oxygen atom of both Val97′ and Pro98′. There are also hydrophobic interactions seen between the rings of Trp99 and Trp92′.Structural Comparisons—The known structure with the highest structural similarity to Mtb DsbE is Bradyrhizobium japonicum CcmG/DsbE (B. japonicum DsbE) (44Edeling M.A. Guddat L.W. Fabianek R.A. Thony-Meyer L. Martin J.L. Structure. 2002; 10: 973-979Google Scholar), a Gram-negative bacterial DsbE periplasmic protein. The alignment of the two structures gives a root mean square deviation over backbone atoms of 1.8 Å. The structure with the second highest similarity is B. japonicum TlpA (45Capitani G. Rossmann R. Sargent D.F. Grutter M.G. Richmond T.J. Hennecke H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 1037-1048Google Scholar), which is involved in the maturation of cytochrome aa3 (root mean square deviation of 2.1 Å). Fig. 3, a-c, shows the structural similarity between the three proteins, Mtb DsbE, B. japonicum DsbE, and B. japonicum TlpA, respectively. The most obvious difference between these three proteins is that the active site cysteines in the B. japonicum DsbE and B. japonicum TlpA structures are in their oxidized states but are in their reduced states in the Mtb DsbE structure.Fig. 3Ribbon diagrams of Mtb DsbE and two of the proteins with similar structures.a-c, ribbon diagrams of the structures with the active site cysteines indicated with an arrow. These images were generated using RIBBONS. a, Mtb DsbE; b, B. japonicum DsbE; c, B. japonicum TlpA. It should be noted that all three structures have similar topology, although in Mtb DsbE the active site is in its reduced form, whereas in B. japonicum DsbE and B. japonicum TlpA the active sites are in their oxidized form.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Gram-positive Mtb DsbE Protein Functions Differently from Gram-negative DsbE Proteins—The function of DsbE homologs in Gram-positive bacteria has not previously been characterized. A phylogenetic tree derived from prokaryotic homologs to E. coli DsbE shows that the Gram-positive and Gram-negative DsbE homolog proteins cluster into two groups with the extremophile Deinococcus radiodurans separating the two groups (data not shown). The divergence of Gram-negative and Grampositive DsbE homologs and the difference in redox state of Mtb DsbE and B. japonicum DsbE crystal structures suggest that Gram-positive DsbE and Gram-negative DsbE homologs may function differently.Determination of the Redox Potential of Mtb DsbE—To further characterize Mtb DsbE, the redox potential relative to that of glutathione was determined, which compares the ability of reduced glutathione to transfer electrons to a protein. The Keq of Mtb DsbE is ∼0.25 ± 0.2 mm (Fig. 4a). The corresponding standard redox potential (E′0) calculated for Mtb DsbE is -128 ± 12 mV. In comparison with the standard redox potential for E. coli DsbA (-124 mV) (46Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 717-726Google Scholar), which is an oxidant, and E. coli thioredoxin (-269 mV) (35Aslund F. Berndt K.D. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30780-30786Google Scholar), which is a reductant, the standard redox potential for Mtb DsbE (-128 mV) suggests that DsbE is an oxidant. In contrast, the standard redox potentials for Gram-negative DsbE proteins (-217 to -175 mV) (47Li Q. Hu H. Xu G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 849-853Google Scholar, 48Fabianek R.A.

Knaff D.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10172-10176Google Scholar) correspond to these proteins being weak reductants. Since Mtb DsbE is an oxidant and Gram-negative DsbE proteins are weak reductants, this reinforces the hypothesis that Gram-negative and Gram-positive DsbE proteins function differently.Fig. 4Biochemical Characterization of Mtb DsbE.a, redox equilibrium of Mtb DsbE with glutathione.

In mycelia, the azgA gene is, like other genes of purine catabolism, induced by uric acid and repressed by ammonium. Its transcription depends on the pathway-specific UaY zinc binuclear cluster protein and the broad domain AreA GATA factor.

Homologues of unknown function are found in plants, fungi, bacteria, and Archaea. In A. nidulans, genes coding for proteins involved in purine utilization, including transporters, are under a dual control, induction by uric acid and nitrogen metabolite repression (2Gorfinkiel L.

We also report the first application of a heterologous transposition tool developed in our laboratory (18Li Destri Nicosia M.G. Brocard-Masson C. Demais S. Hua Van A. Daboussi M.J. Scazzocchio C.

Nitrogen sources were at the following concentrations: 5 mm urea; 5 mm ammonium L (+) tartrate; adenine, guanine, hypoxanthine, and uric acid, 0.1 g/liter (around 700 μm).

Selection of azgA– mutants was on 700 μm 8-azaguanine medium. Transposition Mutagenesis—To ensure that all azgA– mutants obtained in the transposon-carrying strains originate from independent events, colonies arising from single spore isolates were pre-grown on hypoxanthine as nitrogen source. Colonies were inoculated into medium containing 700 μm 8-azaguanine on 5 mm urea as sole nitrogen source. One resistant sector was isolated per colony.

Hartl D.L. Genetics. 1988; 120: 621-623Google Scholar) was carried out with the Expand long template PCR system kit (Roche Diagnostics) using oligonucleotides 5′-GCGGCCACGTCGTTTTAATCG-3′ and 5′-AACCTGTCAACGCAAATCGC-3′. The resulting product was subjected to a second PCR using nested oligonucleotides 5′-ACCGTAATGAAGGCGTAAGT-3′ and 5′-ACGCCCCGCAGACCTTCTTC-3′. The resulting product was cloned in pGEM™-T easy vector (Promega). 5′ and 3′ RACE Analysis—The start and the end of transcription of the azgA gene was determined using the 5′/3′ RACE kit (Roche Diagnostics). In the 5′ RACE experiment, the cDNA was obtained using the specific oligonucleotides 5′-ACCGAGTAAAGTCAAACCG-3′, 5′-GTTGCGCATGAAACGGATAT-3′ and 5′-AGGTCTTCGGCTGGACAG-3′. In the 3′ RACE experiment, the initial cDNA was obtained using the specific oligonucleotide 5′-TCTCCGCCTGTTACAGCATT-3′. Two rounds of nested PCR reactions were then carried out using oligonucleotides 5′-CGGTCTGACATCATGTATGA-3′ and 5′-CCGGTATCTGCTTCTTCAT-3′, respectively, to increase specificity. The resulting product was cloned in the pGEM™-T easy vector (Promega). Sequence Determination—Sequences were determined using the “Big Dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction with AmpliTaq DNA polymerase” kit on an ABI310 sequencing apparatus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The azgA gene was sequenced on both strands using two independent clones. When necessary a third clone was sequenced. Transformation Techniques—Transformation of E. coli was performed by electroporation with a MicroPulser™ (Bio-Rad). Transformation of A. nidulans was according to Ref. 29Tilburn J. Scazzocchio C.

Purine Transport Assays—[3H]Hypoxanthine uptake was assayed in conidiospores at 37 °C (3Diallinas G. Gorfinkiel L. Arst Jr., H.N. Cecchetto G. Scazzocchio C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8610-8622Google Scholar, 30Tazebay U.H. Sophianopoulou V. Cubero B. Scazzocchio C. Diallinas G. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 132: 27-37Google Scholar). Initial velocities were corrected by subtracting background uptake values, measured in the triple azgA–uapA–uapC– mutant. Competition assays were performed in the simultaneous presence of [3H]hypoxanthine (1 μm) and 300 μm non-radiolabeled putative competitors. Competition by l-ascorbic acid was performed at 300 μm and 5 mm. The apparent Michaelis constant (Km) and maximal velocity (V) values for [3H]hypoxanthine were determined from double reciprocal plots of the initial uptake rate plotted against substrate concentrations (1–13 μm). The concentration of adenine resulting in 50% inhibition of [3H]hypoxanthine uptake (K50) was obtained at constant [3H]hypoxanthine concentration (1 μm) and adenine concentrations from 0 to 200 μm. All transport assays were carried out in at least three different experiments. In each experiment three measures were taken for each point and standard errors were calculated. Radiolabeled [G-3H]hypoxanthine (specific activity 13 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. In Vivo Characterization of the AzgA Transporter—The early mutants in the AzgA transporter were obtained as spontaneous sectors resistant to the toxic analogue 8-azaguanine. These strains were cross-resistant to purine and showed severely reduced growth on adenine, hypoxanthine, and guanine as nitrogen sources (1Darlington A.J. Scazzocchio C. J. Bacteriol. 1967; 93: 937-940Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the time course of hypoxanthine uptake for an azgA+ and an azgA– strain. Hypoxanthine uptake showed hyperbolic kinetics in relation to substrate concentration (not shown). The apparent Km and V for hypoxanthine were calculated to be 1.4 ± 0.5 μm and 1.2 pmol/min 107 conidiospores, respectively. Although the Km characterizes this transporter, V depends on the absolute quantity of transporter inserted into the membrane. The latter depends on growth conditions but is also under developmental control. 4S. Amillis, G. Cecchetto, V. Sophianopoulou, C. Scazzocchio, and G. Diallinas, unpublished results. Thus this parameter is contingent to the exact conditions of the experiment (see “Experimental Procedures”). The high toxicity of 8-azaguanine allowed investigation of the specificity of the AzgA transporter by growth competition experiments. Guanine, hypoxanthine, adenine, 2-aminopurine, and 2–6-diaminopurine protect completely from 8-azaguanine toxicity. Guanosine protects moderately (13Scazzocchio, C. (1966) Ph.D. Thesis, University of Cambridge, CambridgeGoogle Scholar). Adenine competes for hypoxanthine uptake with a Ki of 3.0 ± 0.6 μm. Table I shows competition of hypoxanthine uptake by a number of metabolites. These data agree very well with the plate competition tests. A surprising feature is that 8-azaguanine does not compete with hypoxanthine uptake. Thus the in vivo inhibition of growth by 8-azaguanine was re-investigated. The analogue inhibits growth on solid media at concentrations as low as 7 μm and all azgA– mutants tested are resistant to concentrations as high as the solubility limit. At the standard concentration of 700 μm 8-azaguanine, 7 μm hypoxanthine affords clear protection, which confirms that the AzgA protein has a much higher affinity for hypoxanthine than for 8-azaguanine (not shown). Allopurinol, an isomer of hypoxanthine, does not compete with hypoxanthine uptake, and this agrees with experiments that suggested that this analogue is taken in by the UapA and UapC transporters. 5C. Scazzochio and H. N. Arst, Jr., unpublished results. The human ascorbic acid transporter is a member of the NAT family (8Tsukaguchi H. Tokui T. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Chen X.Z. Wang Y.

Competition of hypoxanthine uptake by l-ascorbic acid is shown in Table I. 300 μml-ascorbic acid did not compete with hypoxanthine uptake but 5 mml-ascorbic acid reduced hypoxanthine uptake to 35%.Table ICompetition of [3H]hypoxanthine uptake by excess unlabeled purine-related compounds or ascorbic acid in an azgA+uapA–uapC–strainUnlabeled competitor[3H]hypoxanthine uptake rate%None100 ± 3Hypoxanthine7 ± 0.5Xanthine119 ± 9Uric acid113 ± 8Adenine9 ± 1Guanine40 ± 3Thymine120 ± 9Cytosine71 ± 4Uracil103 ± 7Adenosine94 ± 5Guanosine46 ± 3Inosine66 ± 3Thymidine78 ± 5Cytidine106 ± 8Uridine79 ± 32-Thioxanthine74 ± 36-Thioguanine45 ± 28-Azaguanine104 ± 128-Azaxanthine35 ± 25-Fluorouracil71 ± 45-Fluorouridine82 ± 55-Aminouracil71 ± 6Caffeine65 ± 4Allopurinol98 ± 7Ascorbic acid72 ± 5Ascorbic acid (5 mm)30 ± 3 Open table in a new tab Genetic Characterization of azgA—Scazzocchio (13Scazzocchio, C. (1966) Ph.D. Thesis, University of Cambridge, CambridgeGoogle Scholar) had characterized 11 azgA non-complementing alleles. One allele, azgA4 was still available. This was located in linkage group V, in agreement with the location of the lost allele azgA1. azgA4, chosen as the representative allele was mapped more precisely in chromosome V and was loosely linked to the lysB, nudC, and nicA genes. The nearest marker is lysB (23.5 ± 2.4 centimorgan). 11 new putative alleles (azgA208 to azgA219) were selected as 8-azaguanine-resistant colonies after UV mutagenesis. A new allele (azgA201) was isolated as an 8-azaguanine spontaneous resistant sector. All these 8-azaguanine-resistant strains have impaired growth on hypoxanthine as nitrogen source. Crosses and complementation tests showed azgA4, azgA201, azgA212, and azgA217 to be allelic. Transpositional Cloning of the azgA Gene—Transformation with gene libraries or pools of cosmids from chromosome V failed to yield azgA+ transformants. To attempt transposon tagging of azgA we used strain CS2757 (see “Experimental Procedures,” Ref. 18Li Destri Nicosia M.G. Brocard-Masson C. Demais S. Hua Van A. Daboussi M.J. Scazzocchio C. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1330-1344Google Scholar). The CS2757 strain is deleted for the resident niaD gene, encoding nitrate reductase, and carries a single copy of a niaD transgene interrupted in its 5′-untranslated leader with a modified impala transposon from Fusarium oxysporum. It also carries the yA2 mutation, resulting in yellow conidiospores and the yA+ gene inserted in the transposable element. yA+ is normally expressed and thus this strain is unable to grow on nitrate as nitrogen source but has green conidiospores. On excision of impala the niaD leader will be restored and the strain will recover the ability to utilize nitrate. The characteristics of the strain and the strategy used are shown in Fig. 2. We selected 248 8-azaguanine-resistant mutants in the CS2757 strain. Of these, only one had become niaD+. This phenotype shows that the transposon has been excised from the niaD promoter, but not that it has inserted concomitantly in the azgA gene. This was shown as follows. The resulting strain CS3107 was crossed with a yA– strain (CS2748), and the progeny checked for conidiospore color, 8-azaguanine resistance, and ability to utilize hypoxanthine as nitrogen source. In 300 progeny analyzed, all strains resistant to 8-azaguanine and defective in hypoxanthine utilization (azgA–) were yA+, all azgA+ strains were yA–. Thus the transposon is genetically tightly linked to (and presumably the cause of) the azgA– phenotype. Complementation and recombination (4000 progeny tested) tests show that the transposition insertion and azgA4 are alleles. The new allele will be called azgA108. Thus we have tagged azgA with the impala-modified transposon. The precise location of the transposon in the azgA gene is described below and shown in Fig. 3.Fig. 3The azgA gene. The distribution of introns, and the position of a number of azgA– mutations is shown. Light gray, promoter region. Dark gray, 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of the azgA mRNA. Black, translated regions. White, introns. The 5′ start point is at –58 bp from the ATG. Polyadenylation occurs at +144 bp after the stop codon. Intron positions are in nucleotides from the ATG: intron 1, 91–191; intron 2, 296–370; intron 3, 1185–1234; intron 4, 1340–1385.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Molecular Characterization of the azgA Gene—We cloned the azgA gene by inverse (circular) PCR (28Ochman H. Gerber A.S. Hartl D.L. Genetics. 1988; 120: 621-623Google Scholar) using SphI-digested DNA from strain CS3107 and primers able to hybridize the impala::yA transposon sequences. Two nested series of primers allowed us to amplify a 3-kb DNA fragment containing the right and left boundaries of the known impala::yA sequence. This fragment was sequenced and shown to contain a sequence highly similar to the amino terminus of a Schizosaccharomyces pombe membrane protein of unknown function. We could thus assume that we have cloned the 5′ of the azgA gene. The missing 3′ sequences were obtained as a cDNA by a 3′ RACE experiment using RNA from the wild type strain and primers able to hybridize with the previously determined sequence. This cDNA included the 3′ terminus of the RNA. Then, the corresponding genomic DNA was amplified by PCR and its sequence determined. We then sequenced a 3013-bp fragment containing a 2012-bp open reading frame interrupted by 4 putative introns. The start point of transcription and the exact location of introns 1 and 2 were determined by the 5′ RACE experiment using RNA from the wild type strain grown on adenine containing medium (see “Experimental Procedures”). We amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR an internal cDNA fragment overlapping both the 5′ and 3′ RACE fragments. Sequencing this fragment allowed us to map the boundaries of introns 3 and 4. The exact position of the 5′ and 3′ mRNA termini and of the introns is shown in Fig. 3. The insertion of impala had occurred at the TA sequence at the 5′ splice site of intron 1 as shown by the inverse PCR sequence (see above). A 2.6-kb fragment overlapping the insertion point was amplified and used as a probe in Southern blots against DNA extracted from wild type, azgA4 and azgA108 strains. The wild type and azgA4 strains have identical restriction patterns, whereas the azgA108 strain pattern shows the presence of the transposon (data not shown). Thus the cloned fragment corresponds to the primary transposition event in the CS3107 mutated strain. The azgA sequence data have been submitted to the EMBL data base under accession number AJ575188. The whole 3013-bp fragment was amplified from total genomic DNA of the wild type strain and cloned in the pGEM™-T easy vector. The resulting plasmid is able to complement an azgA4 mutation in transformation experiments (results not shown). We find azgA in the recently released A. nidulans genomic sequence 6genome.wi.mit.edu/annotation/fungi/aspergillus, March 2003. in contig 1.156, Scaffold 12, which anchors this supercontig to chromosome V. No other homologues of azgA were found. Transposon Excision from the azgA Gene—The azgA108 allele results from an impala insertion exactly in the 5′ extremity of the first intron of the azgA gene. To obtain azgA+ revertants it is necessary for an excision event to generate sequences compatible with intron splicing. A azgA108 uapC201/401 double mutant (CS3108) was constructed (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). This is necessary as a single azgA– mutation shows residual growth on hypoxanthine, which enters via the UapC transporter (1Darlington A.J. Scazzocchio C. J. Bacteriol. 1967; 93: 937-940Google Scholar, 3Diallinas G. Gorfinkiel L. Arst Jr., H.N. Cecchetto G. Scazzocchio C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8610-8622Google Scholar). From this strain, we have obtained 6 revertants as strains able to grow on hypoxanthine as sole nitrogen source. To determine the footprints left by the excision of the transposon we amplified and sequenced for each revertant a 598-bp fragment overlapping the insertion. In four cases, the sequence was identical to the wild type one, whereas the two other strains show a TACATA footprint, comprising a TA duplication (characteristic of the Tc1-mariner family, of which impala is a member). This duplication does not affect intron splicing, as the wild type intron/exon junction (read as customary in the opposite, coding strand) GATGT is replaced by GTATGTATGT (duplicated sequence, including the TA in bold) that maintains a 5′ intron consensus splicing sequence. AzgA Defines a New Family or Subfamily of Membrane Proteins—No AzgA homologues of known function were identified. Many homologues of unknown function were found in data bases of fungi, plants, bacteria, and Archaea. AzgA is different from every previously described family of purine or pyrimidine transporters. The most similar proteins are found in Neurospora crassa and S. pombe, followed by two proteins of A. thaliana, and a second one of N. crassa (see Fig. 4A). No homologues are found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans, or Aspergillus fumigatus. Similar proteins were found in a large variety of prokaryotes such as the Archaea Pyrococchus abyssi, the cyanobacterium Trichodesmium erythaeum and Staphylococcus spp. or Pseudomonas spp. A related human gene was also identified as a cDNA (GenBank™ accession number AAK25745), corresponding to two EST sequences from heart tissue (accession number R15594 and T12436). This sequence was not found in either the human or mouse genomes, it is most similar to bacterial sequences and it is most probably a contaminant. A number of data bases classify transporters into discrete families. The Pfam data base (33Bateman A. Birney E. Cerruti L. Durbin R. Etwiller L. Eddy S.R. Griffiths-Jones S. Howe K.L. Marshall M. Sonnhammer E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 276-280Google Scholar) classifies AzgA and some of its homologues (i.e. that of S. pombe) as members of the NAT family that includes UapA and UapC (4de Koning H. Diallinas G. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2000; 17: 75-94Google Scholar). The BLOCK data base finds domains conserved between the NAT family and the AzgA homologues (34Henikoff S. Henikoff J. Genomics. 1994; 19: 97-107Google Scholar). The TransportDB 766.93.129.133/transporter/wb/index.html. includes transporters from a number of completely sequenced genomes, including 109 bacteria, 16 Archaea, and 6 eukaryotes, including S. pombe, N. crassa, and A. thaliana but not A. nidulans.

https://openalex.org/W2011847534,"ExoS (453 amino acids) is a bi-functional type-III cytotoxin of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Residues 96–233 comprise the Rho GTPase-activating protein (Rho GAP) domain, while residues 234–453 comprise the 14-3-3-dependent ADP-ribosyltransferase domain. Residues 51–72 represent a membrane localization domain (MLD), which targets ExoS to perinuclear vesicles within mammalian cells. YopE (219 amino acids) is a type-III cytotoxin of Yersinia that is also a Rho GAP. Residues 96–219 comprise the YopE Rho GAP domain. While the Rho GAP domains of ExoS and YopE share structural homology, unlike ExoS, the intracellular localization of YopE within mammalian cells has not been resolved and is the subject of this investigation. Deletion mapping showed that the N terminus of YopE was required for intracellular membrane localization of YopE in CHO cells. A fusion protein containing the N-terminal 84 amino acids of YopE localized to a punctate-perinuclear region in mammalian cells and co-localized with a fusion protein containing the MLD of ExoS. Residues 54–75 of YopE (termed YopE-MLD) were necessary and sufficient for intracellular localization in mammalian cells. The YopE-MLD localized ExoS to intracellular membranes and targeted ExoS to ADP-ribosylate small molecular weight membrane proteins as observed for native type-III delivered ExoS. These data indicate that the YopE MLD functionally complements the ExoS MLD for intracellular targeting in mammalian cells.

These data indicate that the YopE MLD functionally complements the ExoS MLD for intracellular targeting in mammalian cells. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen that causes life-threatening infections in cystic fibrosis patients, individuals with burn wounds, and the immune compromised (1.Giamarellou H. Int. J. Antimicrob. Agents. 2000; 16: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa involves both cell-associated and secreted virulence factors. P. aeruginosa produces four type-III cytotoxins (ExoS, ExoT, ExoU, and ExoY) that are delivered by bacteria directly into the eukaryotic cell (2.Frank D.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). ExoS is a bi-functional cytotoxin that encodes a 14-3-3-dependent ADP-ribosyltransferase domain in the C terminus and a Rho GTPase-activating protein (Rho GAP) 1The abbreviations used are: Rho GAP, Rho GTPase-activating Protein; YopS, Yersinia Outer membrane Proteins; MLD, membrane localization domain; MOI, multiplicity of infection; CHO, Chinese Hamster Ovary-K1; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; HRP, horseradish peroxidase. domain in the N terminus. In cultured cells, the Rho GAP domain stimulates actin reorganization (3.Pederson K.J. Vallis A.J. Aktories K. Frank D.W. Barbieri J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) while the ADP-ribosyltransferase domain causes cell death (4.Pederson K.J. Barbieri J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). ExoS is a Rho GAP for Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 both in vitro and in vivo (5.Goehring U.M. Schmidt G. Pederson K.J. Aktories K. Barbieri J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36369-36372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 6.Krall R. Sun J. Pederson K.J. Barbieri J.T. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 360-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Type-III-delivered ExoS localizes to intracellular membranes within eukaryotic cells (7.Pederson K.J. Pal S. Vallis A.J. Frank D.W. Barbieri J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Fusion of the first 107 amino acids of ExoS to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) directed this reporter protein to the perinuclear region of mammalian cells. Residues 51–72 of ExoS encode a membrane localization domain (MLD), which is both necessary and sufficient for localization within mammalian cells (6.Krall R. Sun J. Pederson K.J. Barbieri J.T. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 360-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Deletion of the MLD did not inhibit type-III secretion of ExoS from P. aeruginosa or type-III delivery into mammalian cells. Type-III delivered ExoSΔMLD was located in the cytosol of mammalian cells and expressed ADP-ribosyltransferase activity, but did not ADP-ribosylate Ras. This indicated that membrane localization of ExoS was required for the efficient ADP-ribosylation of Ras as well as a subset of small molecular weight membrane bound proteins. Type-III delivered ExoSΔMLD was cytotoxic for eukaryotic cells, uncoupling the ADP-ribosylation of Ras with ExoS-induced cell death. Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague, shares numerous features with Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis, including a tropism for lymphoid tissues and resistance to the host innate immune system. In addition to chromosomally encoded virulence factors, these three pathogens possess a common large virulence plasmid, which encodes a type-III secretion apparatus and several type-III cytotoxins (termed Yops (Yersinia outer membrane proteins)) (8.Michiels T. Wattiau P. Brasseur R. Ruysschaert J.M. Cornelis G. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 2840-2849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One type-III cytotoxin, YopE, has been subjected to considerable investigation, yielding a wealth of knowledge concerning its molecular and cellular properties. Straley and Cibull (9.Straley S.C. Cibull M.L. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 1200-1210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) initially determined that YopE contributed to the pathogenesis of Yesinia, while Wolf-Watz and co-workers (10.Rosqvist R. Forsberg A. Rimpilainen M. Bergman T. Wolf-Watz H. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 11.Schesser K. Frithz-Lindsten E. Wolf-Watz H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 7227-7233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) observed that YopE mediated a cytotoxic response on HeLa cells and macrophages that required the binding of the Yersinia to the host cell surface. YopE is synthesized in the cytoplasm of the Yersinia and the chaperone protein, YerA, binds and stabilizes YopE in a secretion-competent conformation. Wolf-Watz and co-workers (12.Hakansson S. Schesser K. Persson C. Galyov E.E. Rosqvist R. Homble F. Wolf-Watz H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5812-5823Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) showed that the first 11 amino acids of YopE were required for secretion out of the bacterium and that the N-terminal 49 amino acids were required for translocation across the eukaryotic cell membrane. Recently, Anderson and Schneewind (13.Anderson D.M. Schneewind O. Science. 1997; 278: 1140-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) implicated a role for an RNA intermediate in the secretion of YopE by the type-III apparatus, which has been controversial (14.Lloyd S.A. Norman M. Rosqvist R. Wolf-Watz H. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 520-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 15.Lloyd S.A. Sjostrom M. Andersson S. Wolf-Watz H. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Similar to ExoS, YopE is a GAP for Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 and utilizes an arginine finger to stimulate the GAP activity of the Rho GTPases (16.Von Pawel-Rammingen U. Telepnev M.V. Schmidt G. Aktories K. Wolf-Watz H. Rosqvist R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 737-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 17.Black D.S. Bliska J.B. Mol.

Cell Microbiol. 2001; 3: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The structure of the GAP domain of YopE is primarily α-helical and similar to ExoS, but does not have obvious structural similarity with the eukaryotic Rho GAPs (19.Evdokimov A.G. Tropea J.E. Routzahn K.M. Waugh D.S. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 20.Wurtele M. Wolf E. Pederson K.J. Buchwald G. Ahmadian M.R. Barbieri J.T. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Unlike the catalytic arginine of the eukaryotic GAPs, which is contained within a loop, the active site arginine of YopE and ExoS are located within an α-helix. A reporter system, which comprises YopE fused to the Bordetella adenylate cyclase, has been useful to measure YopE translocation into eukaryotic cells (21.Sory M.P. Cornelis G.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 583-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). There is limited characterization of the intracellular localization of YopE (22.Fields K.A. Nilles M.L. Cowan C. Straley S.C. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 5395-5408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Rosqvist R. Forsberg A. Wolf-Watz H. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 4562-4569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which prompted this study to define its intracellular location in mammalian cells. Materials—Chinese Hamster Ovary-K1 (CHO) cells (CCL-61) and HeLa cells (CCL-2) were from the ATCC. Tissue culture media and sera were from Invitrogen. Reagents for molecular and cell biological techniques were from New England Biolabs or Invitrogen, and chemicals were from Sigma, unless noted. CHO cells were cultured in F-12 complete medium containing 10% newborn calf serum, 7.5% sodium bicarbonate, and 2.5% penicillin/streptomycin. HeLa cells were cultured in Minimal Essential Medium with Earle's salts containing 10% fetal bovine serum, non-essential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, 7.5% sodium bicarbonate, and 2.5% penicillin/streptomycin. Transfections of DNA into mammalian cells used the LipofectAMINE PLUS transfer system. Experiments described in this study were performed with both HeLa and CHO cells with similar results, except Fig. 7 where only CHO cells were analyzed. This was due to the limited ability of tetanolysin to allow sufficient 32P-NAD to diffuse into HeLa cells to allow detection of ADP-ribosylated host proteins. 2M. J. Riese and J. T. Barbieri, unpublished results. Construction of ExoS and YopE Expression Vectors—pYopE-HA: forward and reverse primers, 5′-GAGATCAGAATTCATGAAAATATCATCATTT-3′ and 5′-GAGATCGGATCCTCACAAGCTGGCGTAGTCCGGGCACGTCGTAGGGGTAGGTCATCAATGACAGTAA-3′ were designed from the amino acid sequence of YopE (GenBank™ accession number Y00543) and the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag (underlined) and used to amplify YopE-HA, using the Yersinia pseudotuberculosis PCD-1 plasmid (obtained from Robert Perry, University of Kentucky) as template. The amplified product, which encoded a 5′-EcoR1 and a BamH1 site immediately 3′ to the stop codon, was subcloned into pEGFP-N1. pYopE1–84/GFP and pYopE1–84/HcRed: forward and reverse primers, 5′-GAGATCGAATTCTGATGAAAATATCATCATTT-3′ and 5′-GAGATCACCGGTTTTATGGCTCCCCTCCGA-3′ were designed from the amino acid sequence of YopE. DNA encoding YopE1–84 was amplified by PCR, using pYopE-HA as template. The amplified product encoded a 5′-EcoRI and a 3′-AgeI site was subcloned into pEGFP-N1 and pHcRed-N1 (Clontech) to express the N-terminal 84 amino acids of YopE fused in-frame with GFP or red fluorescent protein (HcRed). pYopE76–219-HA: forward and reverse primers 5′-GATCGAGAATTCGCCACCATGCATCGCATGTTCTCGGAG-3′ and 5′-GAGATCGGATCCTCACAAGCTGGCGTAGTC-3′ were designed from the amino acid sequence of YopE-HA and used to amplify YopE76-219-HA using pYopE-HA as template. The amplified product, which encoded a 5′-EcoRI and a BamH1 site immediately 3′ of the stop codon, was subcloned into pEGFP-N1. YopE54–75/GFP and YopE64–75: The fusion constructs 54–75/GFP and 64–75/GFP were engineered by subcloning double-stranded DNA encoding an ATG codon followed by DNA encoding residues 54–75 or 64–75 of YopE (GenBank™ accession number Y00543), respectively, in-frame into the 5′-EcoR1 and 3′-BamHI sites of pEGFP-N1. ExoSYopMLD: ExoSYopMLD was constructed by subcloning double-stranded DNA encoding residues 54–75 of YopE (GenBank™ accession number Y00543) into unique KpnI, BglII restriction sites in pUCP/ExoSΔMLD. ExoSExoMLD: ExoSExoMLD was constructed by subcloning DNA encoding residues 51–72 of ExoS into unique KpnI, BglII restriction sites in pUCP/ExoSΔMLD. PCR-derived constructs were sequenced to assure the fidelity of the amplified DNA fragment. ExoSMLD/GFP: DNA encoding deletion MLD/GFP fusion proteins were engineered by subcloning DNA encoding an ATG codon followed by the indicated sequence of the MLD fragment into the EcoRI-BamHI restriction sites of pEGFP-N1 in-frame with DNA encoding GFP. DNA was sequenced to verify the correct DNA sequence in the subclone. Mammalian Cell Fractionation—Cells were fractionated as earlier described (5.Goehring U.M. Schmidt G. Pederson K.J. Aktories K. Barbieri J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36369-36372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded in 85-mm plates and transiently transfected at 60–80% density with the indicated amount of effector DNA and 0.5 μg of reporter DNA (pEGFP-N1). 18–24 h after transfection, cells were harvested for 5 min at 1000 rpm in a clinical centrifuge (4 °C). Cells were washed in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted, washed in 10 ml of ice-cold buffer HB2 and suspended in buffer HB1. HB1 contains 250 mm sucrose, 0.5 m NaCl, 3 mm imidazole (pH 7.4); HB2 is HB1 plus Protease Inhibitor Mixture set III (Calbiochem) and 0.5 mm EDTA. Cells were broken by passage 20 times through a 25 × g needle. An aliquot of the whole cell lysate was boiled with sample buffer and frozen at –80 °C, and the remainder was centrifuged for 10 min at 2,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge (4 °C). The pellet (nuclei and unbroken cells) contained about 10% of the total HA reactive material and was not further analyzed. Post-nuclear supernatants were fractionated by centrifugation (68,000 × g in TLA 100.3 Beckman rotor for 30 min) into soluble (cytosol) and pellet (membrane) fractions. The pellet was suspended in an equal volume of HB2 + 1% Triton, suspended in a volume equivalent of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled, and stored at –80 °C. CHO Cell Permeabilization and Detection of ADP-ribosyltransferase Activity—CHO cells were permeabilized with tetanolysin (List Biologicals) using a procedure adapted from Ref. 24.Ahnert-Hilger G. Wegenhorst U. Stecher B. Spicher K. Rosenthal W. Gratz M. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar. At the first indication of rounding, P. aeruginosa-infected CHO cells (85-mm dishes) were washed with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (room temperature) and incubated in 6 ml of ice-cold HG1 buffer (20 mm PIPES, 2 mm Na+-ATP, 4.8 mm Mg(CH3COO)2, 150 mm potassium glutamate, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and KOH to obtain pH 7.0). Cells were incubated for 10 min (4 °C) with 2.4 μg of tetanolysin and washed with ice-cold HG1 buffer. Next, 6 ml of HG1 buffer containing 20 nm [32P]-(adenylate phosphate)-NAD (6 μCi) were added, and cells were incubated for 25 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were harvested in 0.5 ml of HB2 buffer and broken by passage 20 times through a 25-gauge needle. Unbroken cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation in clinical centrifuge at 2500 rpm for 5 min. Post-nuclear supernatants were fractionated as described above under “Mammalian Cell Fractionation.” Western Blot Analysis of Mammalian Cell Lysates—Fractionated or whole-cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE (13.5% separating gels) and probed with monoclonal antibodies against the HA epitope or GFP (Covance) and then with the secondary antibody goat α-mouse-HRP-IgG (Pierce). The blot was developed with ECL (Pierce, Super Signal) and imaged with x-ray film, which was quantified by densitometry. Microscopy—Cells were seeded in 24-well plates or 8-well microscope slides and transfected with 200 or 100 ng of effector DNA, respectively. 18–24-h post-transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, suspended in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were visualized using a Nikon-inverted microscope, using filter sets for either EGFP (HQ: F712, Nikon) or Hc-Red (DM575, Nikon). The final magnification prior to imaging was ×75, using a ×60 objective and a ×1.25 magnifier in the camera lens. Images were photographed with a Spot II CCD camera and cropped in Corel Photo-Paint 11. Cells transfected with identical amounts of DNA encoding EGFP or Hc-Red did not have detectable fluorescence using the reciprocal filter set when images were captured at identical exposures. Cell Cytotoxicity—CHO cells were seeded in 12-well plates and infected with P. aeruginosa PA103 ΔexoU, exoT::Tc containing (pUCP), (pUCPExoSΔMLD), (pUCPExoSYopMLD), (pUCPExoSExoMLD), or (pUCPExoS), at an MOI 8:1 (bacteria:CHO cell). Four hours postinfection, cells were washed with 1 ml of OPTI-MEM (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.), stained for 5 min with 0.4% Trypan Blue (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.), and visualized at ×20 with a Nikon-inverted microscope. The percentage of cells that did not exclude Trypan Blue was determined from three representative fields. The Minimal Membrane Localization Domain of ExoS—Previous studies showed that residues 51–72 were necessary and sufficient for membrane localization of ExoS, which was termed the membrane localization domain (MLD) (6.Krall R. Sun J. Pederson K.J. Barbieri J.T. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 360-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A series of internal and terminal deletion mutations were engineered within the MLD and expressed as GFP fusion proteins in HeLa cells (Fig. 1) to determine if the MLD represented a minimal localization sequence. Western blot analysis of cell lysates confirmed the expression of the deleted forms of the MLD-GFP fusion protein and showed that each fusion protein had a slightly slower migration rate by SDS-PAGE relative to native GFP (Data not shown). The fusion proteins were expressed at levels comparable to GFP. Deletion of either half or the first 5 N-terminal amino acids eliminated the ability of the MLD to target GFP to the perinuclear region of cells. In contrast, deletion of the C-terminal 5 amino acids of the MLD retained a limited capacity to localize GFP to the perinuclear region, but not as efficiently as the complete MLD (Fig. 1). This indicated that while a dominant component for membrane localization existed within the N terminus of the MLD, the complete MLD was necessary for optimal intracellular targeting of a reported protein. The N Terminus of YopE Comprises a Membrane Localization Domain in Mammalian Cells—To address the steady state expression of YopE in mammalian cells and determine if YopE had the propensity to localize to intracellular vesicles, YopE and YopE-(76–219) were subcloned with C-terminal HA epitopes into a mammalian expression vector and expressed in HeLa or CHO cells. Transfection of the equivalent amounts of DNA yielded steady state expressions of YopE and YopE-(76–219) that were about 50–75% of ExoS and ExoS-(78–234) (Fig. 2, inset). YopE was expressed as a doublet with an apparent molecular mass of ∼28 kDa, while YopE-(76–219) migrated as a single protein with an apparent molecular mass of ∼20 kDa. The expression properties of ExoS-(1–234) and ExoS-(78–234) were similar to that previously reported (7.Pederson K.J. Pal S. Vallis A.J. Frank D.W. Barbieri J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Both full-length and N-terminal forms of ExoS and YopE stimulated the rounding of both CHO cells (Fig. 2) and HeLa cells (data not shown). Subcellular fractionation showed that both ExoS-(1–234) and YopE were primarily membrane associated, while ExoS-(78–234) and YopE-(76–219) were present in the cytosol (Table I). This indicated that membrane localization was not required to stimulate actin reorganization (cell rounding) and that the N-terminal region of YopE, like ExoS, contained a membrane localization domain.Table IFractionation of ExoS and YopE in CHO cellsProtein% Pellet (membrane)% Supernatant (cytosol)ExoS1-23493 ± 67 ± 8YopE91 ± 49 ± 3YopE76-21916 ± 584 ± 2GFP13 ± 687 ± 7 Open table in a new tab Upon transient expression, the N-terminal 1–84 amino acids of YopE localized GFP (YopE1-84/GFP) to the perinuclear region of mammalian cells (Fig. 3). Subcellular fractionation of cell lysates followed by Western blot analysis using α-GFP antibody showed that YopE1-84/GFP localized to cell membranes and migrated as a ∼34 kDa protein, similar to the predicted molecular mass of 36 kDa (YopE-(1–84): 8.8 kDa + GFP: 27 kDa, data not shown). Direct fluorescence was used to determine if the N termini of ExoS and YopE co-localized upon expression in mammalian cells, using fusion proteins comprising the N-terminal 84 amino acids of YopE fused to a red fluorescent protein (YopE1–84/HcRed) and the N-terminal 107 amino acids of ExoS fused to GFP (ExoS1-107/GFP). Filter sets did not show overlap of fluorescence between the probes at the level of protein expression used in the analysis. The steady state expression and location of both fusion proteins were similar (Fig. 4). The merged image showed yellow fluorescent vesicles, indicating co-localization of the two probes, and vesicles with primarily green or red fluorescence. This indicated the presence of two populations of vesicle, vesicles that colocalized ExoS-(1–107) and YopE-(1–84) and vesicles that were enriched for one of the proteins. Similar co-localization of the N-terminal fusion proteins of ExoS and YopE was also observed in CHO cells (data not shown).Fig. 4Intracellular membrane localization of YopE and ExoS in mammalian cells. HeLa cells were co-transfected with 100 ng of pExoS1–107/GFP (upper left) and pYopE1–84/HcRed (upper right). Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were examined by fluorescent microscopy, using a HQ:F 712 filter (Nikon) to detect EGFP and a DM 575 filter (Nikon) to detect Hc-Red. The two images were merged (lower left).

The N-terminal hydrophobic amino acids are involved in protein secretion through the type-III apparatus, while residues 54–75 were tested for the ability to function as a membrane localization domain. Residues 54–75 of YopE were fused to GFP (YopE54-75/GFP) and analyzed for sufficiency of intracellular localization. The amount of YopE54-75/GFP that was membrane localized following subcellular fractionation was less than YopE1-84/GFP, but similar to ExoS51-72/GFP. This indicated that residues 54–75 constituted a minimal membrane localization domain of (MLD) YopE in HeLa cells (Fig. 3) and CHO cells (data not shown). Subcellular fractionation of cell lysates followed by Western blot analysis using α-GFP antibody showed that YopE54-75/GFP localized to cell membranes and migrated as a ∼31 kDa protein, similar to the predicted molecular mass of 29 kDa (YopE-(54–75): 2.4 kDa + GFP: 27 kDa, data not shown). YopE-(54–75) appeared to constitute a minimal MLD, as a fusion protein that contained YopE-(64–75) fused to GFP (YopE64-75/GFP) localized to the cytosol when transiently expressed in the pEGFP mammalian expression system (Fig. 3). Together, these studies define residues 54–75 as the YopE MLD. Functional Complementation of the YopEMLD and ExoS-MLDs—Experiments were designed to test the functional complementation between the MLDs of YopE and ExoS by measuring the ability of the YopEMLD to substitute for the ExoSMLD in targeting type-III delivered ExoS to ADP-ribosylate host proteins. Earlier studies showed that the ExoSMLD allowed type-III delivered ExoS to efficiently ADP-ribosylate Ras and other low molecular weight membrane bound mammalian proteins (6.Krall R. Sun J. Pederson K.J. Barbieri J.T. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 360-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, functional complementation between the two MLDs could be tested by measuring the ADP-ribosylation profiles of ExoS upon the substitution of the ExoSMLD with the YopEMLD. The ExoSMLD was replaced with the YopEMLD by subcloning DNA encoding the MLD of YopE into pExoSΔMLD, yielding ExoS-YopMLD. As a control, the ExoSMLD was also subcloned into pExoSΔMLD (ExoS-ExoMLD) and assayed for the ability to recover membrane localization and in vivo ADP-ribosylation profiles similar to wild type ExoS. Analysis of the secreted forms of the ExoS derivatives had showed that the introduction of either the YopEMLD or ExoSMLD into ExoSΔMLD yielded proteins which migrated more slowly by SDS-PAGE than ExoSΔMLD (Fig. 5). These data indicated that YopE MLD did not disrupt type-III secretion of ExoS by P. aeruginosa. Other control experiments showed that introducing the YopEMLD into ExoS also did not interfere with the ability of type-III delivered ExoS to elicit a cytotoxic effect on CHO cells (Fig. 6). In this experiment, CHO cells were infected with the indicated strain of P. aeruginosa at an MOI of 8:1 (bacteria:CHO cell). Four hours post-infection, the cells were stained with 0.4% Trypan Blue and examined by light microscopy.Fig. 6Type-III-delivered ExoSYopMLD is cytotoxic to CHO cells. CHO cells were infected with P. aeruginosa ΔexoU, exoT::Tc (pUCP), (pUCPExoS), (pUCPExoSΔMLD), (pUCPExoSYopMLD), or (pUCPExoSExoMLD) at an MOI of 8:1 (bacteria:cultured cells). Four hours post-infection, the cells were stained with 0.4% Trypan Blue and examined by light microscopy. The percentage of cells that were stained with Trypan Blue was determined in three representative fields. Error bars represent S.D. from duplicate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Analysis of the tetanolysin permeabilization experiment (Fig. 7) defined the effect of substituting the YopEMLD for the ExoSMLD. In this experiment, CHO cells were infected with the indicated strain of P. aeruginosa at an MOI of 8:1 (bacteria: CHO cell). Upon first detection of cell intoxication (cell rounding at ∼3.5–4 h post-infection), cells were permeabilized with tetanolysin and incubated with [32P]NAD. The cell lysate was then subjected to cell fractionation to identify membrane and cytosolic proteins that were ADP-ribosylated. Substitution of the ExoSMLD with the YopEMLD did not influence the amount of type-III delivered ExoS that was associated with CHO cells or the ratio of membrane-bound versus cytosol-associated type-III-delivered ExoS. Radiographic analysis of the membrane and cytosolic fractions showed that the various derivates of ExoS were auto-ADP-ribosylated, which indicated that substitution of the YopEMLD did not affect the intrinsic ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of ExoS and that the toxins were internalized. In addition, ExoS-YopEMLD ADP-ribosylated the same subset of small membrane bound proteins as ExoS and at an efficiency that was comparable to ExoS. The efficiency of ADP-ribosylation was determined by measuring the amount of radiolabel in a subset of small membrane-bound proteins divided by the amount of ExoS that was determined to be membrane bound by measurement of HA reactivity as shown in Fig. 7 (two independent determinations are shown). This calculation allowed the normalization of the amount of ExoS that was cell-associated, which varied among infection experiments. This indicated that the YopEMLD functionally complemented the ExoS MLD. Together, these studies showed that the YopE MLD expressed both physical co-localization and functional complementation in the targeting of ExoS in mammalian cells, despite the limited primary amino acid homology between the MLDs (Fig. 8). Early models did not address intracellular sites of delivery for the type-III cytotoxins. However, as detection systems became more sensitive, these toxins were found associated with intracellular membranes or organelles of mammalian and lower eukaryotic cells. YopM of Yersinia pestis was found to be localized to both the cytosol and nucleus by a brefeldin A sensitive mechanism dependent on microtubules (25.Skrzypek E. Cowan C. Straley S.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 1051-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). YpkA of Y. pseudotuberculosis, a Ser/Thr protein kinase, was observed to be targeted to the plasma membrane (26.Hakansson S. Galyov E.E. Rosqvist R. Wolf-Watz H. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 593-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The intracellular localization of YopE, a Rho GAP of Y. pestis, has been observed in the cytosol (22.Fields K.A. Nilles M.L. Cowan C. Straley S.C. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 5395-5408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and associated with intracellular membranes (23.Rosqvist R. Forsberg A. Wolf-Watz H. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 4562-4569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies by Haraga and Miller (27.Haraga A. Miller S.I. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 4052-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) showed that SspH1, a member of the bacterial LPX repeat protein family, localized to the mammalian nucleus and inhibited NF-κB-dependent gene expression. In addition, the utility of using yeast to characterize the function of type-III effector proteins has recently been reported (28.Lesser C.F. Miller S.I. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1840-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa ExoS is targeted to a perinuclear intracellular membrane compartment within mammalian cells (7.Pederson K.J. Pal S. Vallis A.J. Frank D.W. Barbieri J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) through the action of residues 51–72 (MLD) (6.Krall R. Sun J. Pederson K.J. Barbieri J.T. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 360-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Deletion of the MLD did not interfere with intracellular targeting of the Rho GAP domain, but did inhibit the ability of ExoS to ADP-ribosylate Ras and other small molecular weight membrane-bound proteins. In this study, residues 54–75 of YopE have been identified as the YopE MLD, which co-localized with the ExoS MLD and can functionally complement for the ExoS MLD in mammalian cells. Although there is little primary amino acid homology between the MLDs of ExoS and YopE (Fig. 8), the regions share common hydrophobic moments, which may represent the intracellular targeting determinant for each respective cytotoxin. Fractionation experiments, defined both 51–72 of ExoS and 54–75 of YopE as minimal MLD, but with less membrane-association relative to the full-length form of the respective toxin. This may indicate that the MLD within the fusion protein may not have the same orientation as the MLD in the native protein or that other regions of the toxin may also contribute to localization. This is currently being addressed. In the absence of the chaperone binding domain (residues 15–50), YopE is not translocated into cells by wild type Y. enterocolitica, but is delivered by the type-III apparatus into mammalian cells by a Yop effector multimutant bacterium (ΔHOPEM) (29.Boyd A.P. Lambermont I. Cornelis G.R. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4811-4821Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Boyd et al. (29.Boyd A.P. Lambermont I. Cornelis G.R. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4811-4821Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) proposed that the binding of SycE to YopE introduces a hierarchy of effector translocation by competition with other Yops. Although YopE residues 15–50 are sufficient for chaperone binding, crystallographic studies of SycE complexed to YopE showed that the chaperone spans residues 15–77 (30.Birtalan S.C. Phillips R.M. Ghosh P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 971-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Crystallographic studies of YopE bound to its chaperone, SycE, indicate that the secondary structure in this region is a β-strand followed by an α-helix (30.Birtalan S.C. Phillips R.M. Ghosh P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 971-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The β-strand of YopE 54–75 interacts with SycE through hydrophobic interactions with a hydrophobic patch of an amphipathic α-helix of SycE. In the absence of residues 50–77 of YopE, SycE is not required to promote translocation of YopE (29.Boyd A.P. Lambermont I. Cornelis G.R. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4811-4821Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) suggesting that this domain establishes the need for chaperone binding and that this domain maintains YopE in a secretion competent state prior to type-III delivery within P. aeruginosa. Previous studies identified residues 50–77 of YopE as a secretion inhibition domain that prevented translocation of YopE in the absence of its cognate chaperone (29.Boyd A.P. Lambermont I. Cornelis G.R. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4811-4821Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This inhibition was overcome by the binding of SycE, although the mechanism for this release has not been elucidated. In the absence of the secretion inhibition domain, SycE still binds to YopE and assists in YopE translocation, suggesting that residues 50–77 are not essential for chaperone binding or translocation (29.Boyd A.P. Lambermont I. Cornelis G.R. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4811-4821Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Similar to the ExoSMLD, the YopEMLD constitutes a hydrophobic region that may be responsible for aggregative properties of YopE. One explanation for the secretion inhibition behavior of residues 50–77 is that in the absence of SycE, the MLD is exposed and promotes intracellular aggregation of the toxin, which hampers YopE translocation by the type-III apparatus. The binding of SycE might prevent aggregation and allow for YopE to be secreted from the bacteria in an extended monomeric conformation. YopE and ExoS are biochemically indistinguishable with respect to their in vitro Rho GAP activity. Previous studies indicated that RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 were in vivo targets of the Rho GAP domain of ExoS (6.Krall R. Sun J. Pederson K.J. Barbieri J.T. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 360-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In contrast, dominant active (DA)-Rac reversed the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton elicited by YopE and DA-Rho reformed the stress fibers in YopE-treated cells, which suggested that RhoA and Rac1 were in vivo targets of YopE. Studies by Andor et al. (18.Andor A. Trulzsch K. Essler M. Roggenkamp A. Wiedemann A. Heesemann J. Aepfelbacher M. Cell Microbiol. 2001; 3: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and Black and Bliska (17.Black D.S. Bliska J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 515-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) also indicated that Rac and Rho were preferred targets of YopE based upon the ability of YopE to inhibit Rho GTPase signaling by ligand stimulation and the inhibition of cell rounding, respectively. These results have been corroborated in our laboratory. 3R. Krall and J. T. Barbieri, unpublished data. Several possibilities may account for differences between in vitro and in vivo activities of ExoS and YopE. ExoS and YopE could localize to distinct intracellular fractions providing unique Rho GTPases as targets or the catalytic domains of ExoS and YopE could dictate in vivo substrate specificity. We favor the latter model because ExoS and YopE localize to similar perinuclear regions of eukaryotic cells, suggesting the disparity between in vitro and in vivo activity is not due to a difference in intracellular targeting by the MLD. This was supported by the observed functional complementation of the YopE and ExoS MLDs. Bacterially-encoded Rho GAPs perform similar functions despite the lack of primary amino acid sequence similarity, which was explained by three-dimensional studies that showed these Rho GAP domains were similar and that catalytic residues are conserved (19.Evdokimov A.G. Tropea J.E. Routzahn K.M. Waugh D.S. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 20.Wurtele M. Wolf E. Pederson K.J. Buchwald G. Ahmadian M.R. Barbieri J.T. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The MLDs of ExoS and YopE also demonstrate low amino acid homology, but conserved functional secondary structure; a theme that is becoming more prominent as the molecular architecture and in vivo activities of bacterial toxins are resolved."
https://openalex.org/W2100524401,"The accessory HIV-1 Nef protein plays a key role in AIDS pathogenesis. We recently demonstrated that exogenous Nef triggers phenotypic and functional differentiation of immature dendritic cells (DCs). Here we investigated whether the Nef-induced DC differentiation occurs with morphological remodeling and have focused on the interference of Nef in the signaling pathways that regulates DC maturation. We found that exogenous Nef enters immature DCs, promoting their functional and morphological differentiation. Specifically, Nef promotes interleukin (IL) -12 release, which closely fits with nuclear factor (NF) -kappaB activation. Nef induces rearrangement of actin microfilaments, leading to uropod and ruffle formation. Moreover, Nef increases the capacity of DCs to form clusters with allogeneic CD4+ T cells, improving immunological synapse formation. Searching for molecules involved in Nef-triggered signaling pathways driving the DC maturation, we found that Nef targets Vav and promotes its tyrosine phosphorylation, associated with its nucleus-to-cytoplasm redistribution. This has a direct effect on Vav guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity for the small GTPase Rac1. We hypothesize that targeting Vav, Nef modulates both early signaling events (such as cytoskeletal rearrangement) and delayed responses (such as transcriptional regulation), promoting DC differentiation. Our results highlight how Nef may enhance T lymphocyte activation, thus fostering virus dissemination, manipulating the DC arm of the immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2037945409,"Structural and functional studies recently indicated that the erythropoietin receptor exists as a preassembled homodimer whose activation by ligand binding requires self-interaction of its transmembrane segment. Here, we probed the interface formed by the transmembrane segments by asparagine-scanning mutagenesis in a natural membrane. We show that this interface is based on a leucine zipper-like heptad repeat pattern of amino acids. The strongest impact of asparagine was observed at position 241, suggesting the highest packing density around this position, which is in agreement with results obtained upon mutation to alanine. Interestingly, the same face of the transmembrane helix had previously been shown to enter a heterophilic interaction with the transmembrane segment of gp55-P, a viral membrane protein that leads to ligand-independent receptor activation in infected cells. Further, functional characterization of an erythropoietin receptor mutant with asparagine at position 241 in a hematopoietic cell line showed that this protein could still be activated by erythropoietin yet was not constitutively active. This suggests that forced self-interaction of the transmembrane segments does not suffice to induce signaling of the erythropoietin receptor.

IUBMB Life. 2002; 54: 1-5Google Scholar). A recent example where TMS-TMS interaction has functional consequences is the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR), a single-span membrane protein (4Gurezka R. Laage R. Brosig B. Langosch D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9265-9270Google Scholar, 5Kubatzky K.F. Ruan W. Gurezka R. Cohen J. Ketteler R. Watowich S.S. Neumann D. Langosch D. Klingmüller U. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 110-115Google Scholar). The EpoR is a member of the hematopoietic cytokine receptor family. Signal transduction through the EpoR is crucial for the formation of mature erythrocytes (6Constantinescu S.N. Ghaffari S. Lodish H.F. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 10: 18-23Google Scholar, 7Wilson I.A. Joliffe L.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 696-704Google Scholar). Revising earlier models of receptor activation, recent evidence showed that the unliganded form of the EpoR extracellular domain exists as a preformed homodimer in an open conformation. Epo binding induces domain reorientation that is thought to be transmitted to the cytoplasmic domains to initiate intracellular signaling (8Livnah O. Stura E.A. Middleton S.A. Johnson D.L. Jolliffe L.K. Wilson I.A. Science. 1999; 283: 987-990Google Scholar, 9Remy I. Wilson I.A. Michnick S.W. Science. 1999; 283: 990-993Google Scholar). We have shown that a double point mutation (L240G, L241P) within the murine EpoR TMS disrupts its self-assembly as analyzed by the ToxR system. Importantly, this TMS mutation also impaired the signaling capacity of the mEpoR in hematopoietic cells. In addition, it abolished formation of disulfide-linked receptor homodimers of mEpoR mutant R129C and thereby abrogated its ligand-independent activity (5Kubatzky K.F. Ruan W. Gurezka R. Cohen J. Ketteler R. Watowich S.S. Neumann D. Langosch D. Klingmüller U. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 110-115Google Scholar). That the mEpoR TMS is essential for ligand-independent dimerization was also shown by immunofluorescence co-patching experiments in eukaryotic cell membranes (10Constantinescu S.N. Keren T.

A heterophilic interaction that has functional consequences, too, involves the TMSs from the mEpoR and the gp55-P envelope protein of the polycythemic strain of Friend spleen focusforming virus. This virus induces erythropoietin-independent proliferation of infected erythroid progenitor cells that is due to constitutive mEpoR activation following complex formation with gp55-P (11Li J.-P.

Because association of both single-span proteins is sensitive to sequence variations within their TMSs (13Chung S.-W. Wolff L. Ruscetti S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Fallon A. Shekar S. Henis Y.I. Smith S.O. Lodish J.F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3334-3347Google Scholar), gp55-P is thought to activate mEpoR signaling upon heterophilic interaction of their TMSs. Here, we have systematically analyzed self-interaction of the mEpoR TMS in the context of ToxR chimeric proteins. Anchored within the inner Escherichia coli membrane by heterologous TMSs, ToxR chimeric proteins self-assemble depending on the mutual affinity of the respective TMS as monitored by transcription activation of a reporter gene (16Langosch D.L. Brosig B. Kolmar H. Fritz H.-J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 525-530Google Scholar, 17Brosig B. Langosch D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1052-1056Google Scholar). Taking advantage of the previous observation that asparagine residues within TMSs drive their interaction by hydrogen bond formation (18Zhou F.X. Cocco M.J. Russ W.P. Brunger A.T. Engelman D.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 154-160Google Scholar, 19Choma C. Gratkowski H. Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 161-166Google Scholar), we determined the critical residue positions by asparagine-scanning mutagenesis. Interestingly, we find that the homophilic TMS-TMS interface is identical to the interface previously (15Constantinescu S.N. Liu X. Beyer W. Fallon A. Shekar S. Henis Y.I. Smith S.O. Lodish J.F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3334-3347Google Scholar) shown to interact with the gp55-P TMS. Further, we demonstrate that an asparagine residue at position 241 that induced strong homophilic interaction of mEpoR TMSs does not lead to ligand-independent receptor activity. Plasmid Constructs—Construction of plasmids pToxRmEpoR16 and its mutant L240G/L241P was described previously (5Kubatzky K.F. Ruan W. Gurezka R. Cohen J. Ketteler R. Watowich S.S. Neumann D. Langosch D. Klingmüller U. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 110-115Google Scholar). Plasmids mEpoR3.16.1, mEpoR4.16, mEpoR5.15, and mEpoR6.14 were constructed by ligating synthetic oligonucleotide cassettes encoding the desired sequences into the plasmid pHKToxR(TMIl4)MalE (20Kolmar H. Fritsch C. Kleeman G. Götze K. Stevens F.J. Fritz H.J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 61-69Google Scholar) or pToxR IV (21Gurezka R. Langosch D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45580-45587Google Scholar) previously cut with NheI and BamHI. Each site-directed mutant was constructed by the Kunkel method (22Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad T7 mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. All of the constructs were verified by dideoxy sequencing. The retroviral expression vectors pMOWS-mEpoR and pMOWS-HA-mEpoR were described elsewhere (23Swameye I. Muller T.G. Timmer J. Sandra O. Klingmuller U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1028-1033Google Scholar). The construct pMOWS-L241N was established by PCR mutagenesis using pMX-mEpoR as template and 5′-GCATGATCAGTCGACACCATGGACAAACTCAG-3′ as 5′-primer and 5′-GGCCAGATCTTCTGCTGCAGAGTCCGGCGGTGGGACAGCAGGGCCAGAACCGTATTCAACAGCGAGATGAGGAC-3′ as 3′-primer, and the fragment was subcloned into the SalI and BglII restriction sites of pBabe-mEpoR (24Klingmuller U. Bergelson S. Hsiao J.G. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8324-8328Google Scholar), yielding pBabe-L241N. pMOWS-L241N was generated by subcloning the XhoI and EcoRI fragment from pBabe-L241N into the corresponding sites of pMOWS-mEpoR. The construct pMOWS-HA-L241N was established by subcloning the PmlI and EcoRI fragment of pMOWS-L241N into the corresponding sites of pMOWS-HA-mEpoR. To generate pMOWS-R129C, a XhoI and EcoRI fragment of pMX-R129C (5Kubatzky K.F. Ruan W. Gurezka R. Cohen J. Ketteler R. Watowich S.S. Neumann D. Langosch D. Klingmüller U. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 110-115Google Scholar) was subcloned into the corresponding sites of pMOWS-mEpoR. All of the constructs were verified by dideoxy sequencing. ToxR Activity Assays—For pHKToxR(TMIl4)MalE vector constructs, plasmid-transformed FHK12 cells were grown for 24 h at 37 °C under shaking in the presence of 2% (w/v) maltose, 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and 33 μg/ml chloramphenicol. For ToxRIV vector constructs, plasmid-transformed FHK12 cells were grown for 24 h at 37 °C under shaking in the presence of 2% (w/v) glucose, 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, 10 μg/ml kanamycin, and 0.02–0.15% (w/v) l-arabinose as indicated in the figure legends. β-Galactosidase activities of cell-free extracts were determined as described previously (16Langosch D.L. Brosig B. Kolmar H. Fritz H.-J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 525-530Google Scholar) and are given in Miller units. Western Blotting and Growth Assays—Western blotting was done as described (16Langosch D.L. Brosig B. Kolmar H. Fritz H.-J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 525-530Google Scholar) with an antiserum recognizing the MalE moiety of the ToxR proteins. Functional complementation of MalE deficiency of PD28 cells by the periplasmic MalE domain of correctly integrated ToxR chimeric proteins was done as described (17Brosig B. Langosch D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1052-1056Google Scholar) by measuring the growth kinetics of expressing cells in minimal medium with maltose as the only carbon source. Growth assays with proteins encoded by ToxRIV vectors were done without induction because arabinose was found to inhibit uptake by PD28 cells of maltose. MalE complementation in these experiments thus rests on basal expression levels. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—An equivalent of 1 × 107 BaF3 cells stably expressing HA-tagged versions of the wild-type mEpoR or the mutant L241N were lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm NaF, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm aprotinin (Sigma), 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-EpoR antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After solubilization with sample buffer, the immunoprecipitates were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The proteins were detected using anti-EpoR antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as a primary antibody and protein A coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) and enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Quantification was performed with the Lumi-Imager F1 (Roche Applied Science). Cell Surface Expression—BaF3 cells expressing HA-tagged versions of the wild-type mEpoR or of the mutant L241N were incubated with rat anti-HA (Roche Applied Science) as primary antibody and with the secondary antibody anti-rat IgG coupled to Cy5 (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany). Proliferation Assay—BaF3 cells stably expressing the wild-type mEpoR or the mutants L241N or R129C were washed three times with RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) and plated at densities of 4 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates in the presence of Epo concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1 unit/ml or in medium without Epo. After 4 days, the cell numbers were determined using a Coulter counter and expressed as the percentage of growth obtained in a parallel well containing 5% Walter and Eliza Hall Institute conditioned medium as a source for interleukin-3 instead of Epo. Optimizing the Orientation of the mEpoR TMS within the ToxR Protein—Previously, stretches of 16 residues representing parts of the predicted TMSs of the murine and of the human EpoR have been shown to self-interact as assessed by the ToxR system (4Gurezka R. Laage R. Brosig B. Langosch D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9265-9270Google Scholar, 5Kubatzky K.F. Ruan W. Gurezka R. Cohen J. Ketteler R. Watowich S.S. Neumann D. Langosch D. Klingmüller U. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 110-115Google Scholar). In the present study, we initially determined the optimal orientation of the interacting face of the TMS relative to the DNA-binding ToxR domain. This orientation influences the coupling of TMS-TMS interaction to transcription activation as has been found in earlier studies with other TMSs (Ref. 16Langosch D.L. Brosig B. Kolmar H. Fritz H.-J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 525-530Google Scholar and results not shown). Therefore, we determined the effect of inserting the mEpoR TMS at different phases into ToxR chimeric proteins. These initial studies were performed using the original ToxR system where expression is driven by a constitutively active promoter (16Langosch D.L. Brosig B. Kolmar H. Fritz H.-J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 525-530Google Scholar). Assuming α-helicity of the TMS, stepwise insertion of four additional residues at its N terminus concurrent with stepwise deletion of four residues at its C terminus rotates the potential TMS-TMS interface by up to 4 × 100 = 400°, i.e. more than a full helical turn, relative to the ToxR domain. Accordingly, ToxR activities of four different constructs harboring 20 TMS residues each were compared with the mEpoR16 protein and its nondimerizing L240G/L241P mutant (5Kubatzky K.F. Ruan W. Gurezka R. Cohen J. Ketteler R. Watowich S.S. Neumann D. Langosch D. Klingmüller U. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 110-115Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1B, construct mEpoR4.16 that contained four additional N-terminal residues elicited a stronger ToxR activity than the original mEpoR16 construct and the other constructs with 20 TMS residues. Thus, the phase of the TMS appears to be optimal within mEpoR4.16, and this construct was therefore used for further analysis. Control experiments ascertained that the different ToxR proteins were expressed at comparable levels as tested by Western blotting of whole cell lysates (Fig. 1C). Further, we tested whether their concentrations in inner bacterial membranes were comparable by determining their ability to complement the deficiency in maltose-binding protein (MalE) of an E. coli deletion strain (PD28). This strain cannot grow in minimal medium with maltose as the only carbon source unless the C-terminal MalE-domain of expressed ToxR chimeric proteins is successfully translocated to the periplasmic space (17Brosig B. Langosch D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1052-1056Google Scholar). Because expression of all ToxR constructs tested here allowed for similar growth kinetics, i.e. maltose uptake (Fig. 1D), we excluded the possibility that the degrees of transcription activation are significantly influenced by differences in membrane integration of the ToxR proteins. A cytoplasmically localized construct where the TMS had been deleted (ΔTM) served as negative control. Identification of Interfacial TMS Residues by Asparagine-scanning Mutagenesis—In the absence of high resolution structures, protein-protein interfaces are frequently mapped by investigating the effects of site-directed point mutations on the degree of interaction. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis is usually used for this purpose because exchange of most residue types to alanine creates voids resulting in incremental reductions of protein-protein affinity, and thereby the critical residues can be identified. Because most mutations to alanine, as tested here, reduced self-interaction of the mEpoR TMS only slightly (see Fig. 3), we developed an alternative approach. This novel method is based on recent findings demonstrating that asparagine residues located within TMSs drive their self-interaction in apolar environments like a lipid membrane. This is due to the formation of strong hydrogen bonds between their side chains when water molecules are not available as alternative hydrogen-binding partners (18Zhou F.X. Cocco M.J. Russ W.P. Brunger A.T. Engelman D.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 154-160Google Scholar, 19Choma C. Gratkowski H. Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 161-166Google Scholar). We therefore reasoned that systematic replacement of the mEpoR TMS residues by asparagine would result in different enhancements of TMS-TMS affinity depending on whether the mutated position was closely juxtaposed to its counterpart within the helix-helix interface or not. Accordingly, we performed asparagine-scanning mutagenesis of the TMS within mEpoR4.16 and measured the resulting signal increases. For these analyses, chimeric ToxR proteins were expressed from the pToxRIV plasmid where transcription is under control of the arabinose promoter. The concentration of ToxR proteins within the bacterial membrane can thus be regulated by the concentration of arabinose in the culture medium (21Gurezka R. Langosch D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45580-45587Google Scholar). Because TMS-TMS interaction exhibits concentration dependence like any reversible protein-protein interaction, we tested the effect of the mutations at two different expression levels (Fig. 2A) where mEpoR4.16 elicited less transcription activation than upon constitutive expression (Fig. 1B). Comparing the wild-type sequence with the point mutants revealed that the different TMS positions responded to exchange for asparagine with different signal increases. Within the N-terminal six positions (Leu228–Ile233) only S231N showed a slightly increased signal (induction by 0.05% arabinose; Fig. 2A, lower panel). Much stronger signal increases were seen upon mutating residues Leu234–Ala245, and the strongest signals were of the order L241N > A245N > S238N >L234N. These residues are likely to constitute the mEpoR TMS-TMS interface. The mutation L241N was especially striking because it increased the signal by up to 22-fold and may correspond to a hot spot where packing density is maximal. Although the absolute signal strengths increased at higher arabinose concentration, the relative differences between the mutants and the wild type decreased. This suggests that induction by 0.05% arabinose shifts the concentration of ToxR proteins in the membrane toward saturation of the TMS-TMS binding isotherm where differences in affinity translate to smaller differences in self-assembly and transcription activation. Interestingly, these sensitive residues occupy a and d positions of an (abcdefg)n heptad repeat motif (Fig. 3) that is characteristic of leucine zipper interaction domains (25Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Google Scholar, 26Langosch D. Heringa J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1998; 31: 150-160Google Scholar). Accordingly, mEpoR TM helices appear to self-interact via a leucine zipper type of side chain packing. As above, we performed control experiments to exclude the possibility that the observed differences in transcription activation are due to differences in protein expression and/or efficiencies of membrane integration. Comparable expression levels and efficiencies of membrane integration were confirmed by Western blotting (shown for induction by 0.05% arabinose; Fig. 2B) and functional complementation of MalE deficiency (Fig. 2C), respectively. In addition, we tested whether the orientation of interacting TMS faces relative to ToxR domains is similar between mEpoR4.16 and the previously analyzed mEpoR16 construct (5Kubatzky K.F. Ruan W. Gurezka R. Cohen J. Ketteler R. Watowich S.S. Neumann D. Langosch D. Klingmüller U. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 110-115Google Scholar) where roughly one N-terminal helical turn is missing. To this end, we examined the effects of four consecutive asparagine mutations (L240N through V243N) within mEpoR16. Because L241N also gave the strongest signal increase with mEpoR16 (result not shown), we conclude that the orientation of the TMS interface is comparable in both constructs. As noted above, stimulation of TMS-TMS interaction was most pronounced for asparagines located from positions 234 to 245. We experimentally tested two potential explanations of this effect. First, we asked whether the low impact of asparagine at the N-terminal six positions might be due to steric hindrance of TMS-TMS interaction by the adjacent ToxR domains. Therefore, we inserted a flexible linker sequence (KGSGSGSK) between the ToxR domain and the mEpoR4.16 TMS and reinvestigated the effect of all asparagine mutations in the presence of the linker. We found that the distribution of β-galactosidase activities elicited by the different asparagine mutants was virtually identical to that seen in Fig. 2B (results not shown). Therefore, the insensitivity to asparagine mutation of the N-terminal six positions appears not to be related to steric hindrance of TMS-TMS interaction by the ToxR domains. Second, the observation that exchanging Leu241 to asparagine had a stronger effect than all other mutations suggested that the packing density at this position might be higher than elsewhere in the TMS-TMS interface. To test this possibility, we examined the effects of mutating residues at different a and d positions to alanine. In other words, we tested whether the increases in TMS-TMS affinity upon hydrogen bond formation (i.e. mutation to asparagine) would qualitatively be mirrored by affinity decreases caused by reduction of side chain volume (i.e. mutation to alanine). Upon induction by 0.15% arabinose, alanine mutations S231A, L234A, and S238A reduced the signal by similar extents (∼15–20%), whereas mutant L241A exhibited a decrease by ∼45% (Fig. 4B); position 245 is occupied by alanine already. Control experiments again ascertained that the different TMS mutations did not affect expression levels (Fig. 4C) and membrane integration (results not shown). Thus, the TMS appears to self-interact over its entire length, and position 241 may indeed be the site with the highest packing density within the interface. Biological Functionality of the mEpoR Mutant L241N—To assess whether an increase in self-interaction of the TMS by the mutation L241N could constitutively activate the mEpoR, we generated a mutant receptor harboring the L241N mutation in the TMS (mEpoR L241N). First, we examined expression of the mutant receptor in comparison with the wild-type mEpoR and analyzed BaF3 cells stably expressing HA-tagged versions of the wild-type mEpoR or the mutant mEpoR L241N by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with anti-EpoR antibody (Fig. 5A, left panel). Quantification of the immunoblot revealed that expression of full-length mEpoR L241N is 8-fold increased in comparison with the wild-type mEpoR, whereas the amount of the C-terminal degradation products (27Neumann D. Wikstrom L. Watowich S.S. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13639-13649Google Scholar) was reduced 2-fold. Despite this increase in the total amount of the mutant receptor, flow cytometric analysis showed that cell surface expression of mEpoR L241N (mean fluorescence intensity = 5.54 ± 0.26) is reduced by about 45% in comparison with the wild-type mEpoR (mean fluorescence intensity = 10.42 ± 0.46) (Fig. 5A, right panel). These data indicate that the TMS mutation renders the receptor more stable against proteolytic degradation and results in increased intracellular accumulation. Second, we evaluated the potential constitutive activation of the mutant receptor by comparing the abilities of the wild-type mEpoR, of the mutant mEpoR L241N, and of the previously established constitutively active mutant mEpoR R129C (28Watowich S.S. Yoshimura A. Longmore G.D. Hilton D.J. Yoshimura Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2140-2144Google Scholar) to support proliferation of the factor-dependent pro B cell line BaF3 in the absence or presence of Epo. Parental BaF3 cells and BaF3 cells expressing the wild-type mEpoR or the mutant receptors L241N or R129C were cultured in the presence of Epo concentrations ranging from 0 to 1 unit/ml for 4 days. As expected, BaF3 cells expressing the wild-type mEpoR showed Epo-dependent proliferation, whereas BaF3 cells expressing mEpoR R129C exhibited a substantial degree of Epo-independent growth (Fig. 5B). By comparison, BaF3 cells expressing mEpoR L241N did not grow in the absence of Epo. At a low (0.1 unit/ml) Epo concentration, proliferation of L241N-BaF3 cells was reduced by up to 50% in comparison with cells expressing the wild-type mEpoR. This reduced activity could be attributed to the reduced cell surface expression of the mutant receptor in comparison with the wild-type mEpoR (Fig. 5A, right panel). At higher Epo concentrations, proliferation of cells expressing the wild-type mEpoR or mEpoR L241N was comparable. Assuming that the L241N mutation increased noncovalent self-interaction of the mEpoR TMS in the BaF3 cell membranes, we conclude that strengthening TMS-TMS interaction by hydrogen bond formation is not sufficient to constitutively activate the mEpoR. Structural Implications—Our results suggest that mEpoR TMS residues Ser231, Leu234, Ser238, Leu241, and Ala245 occupy a and d positions of an (abcdefg)n heptad repeat motif. This type of repeat pattern is characteristic of soluble (25Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Google Scholar) and membrane-spanning (26Langosch D. Heringa J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1998; 31: 150-160Google Scholar) leucine zipper interaction domains where side chains at a and d positions tightly interdigitate, whereas e and g positions are located at the periphery of the helix-helix interface. This “knobs-into-holes” type of side chain packing results in positive crossing angles, i.e. left-handed helix-helix pairs. Accordingly, our data suggest that mEpoR TM helices cross each other at a positive angle. Asparagine at some b, c, e, f, and g positions also elicited significant signal increases relative to the wild-type sequence. In the framework of a leucine zipper, the distance between these positions would be too large for hydrogen bond formation to occur (Fig. 3B). Conceivably, the helices may adjust by local distortion or by rotation around their long axes, thus forming alternative, albeit energetically less favorable, interfaces with juxtaposed asparagines. Our data are compatible with this possibility because signals elicited by asparagines at the original e and g positions were above those at adjacent b, c, and f positions whose juxtaposition would require more drastic reorientations. A leucine zipper type of side chain packing has also been found to drive TMS-TMS interactions of phospholamban (29Simmerman H.K.B. Kobayashi Y.M. Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5941-5946Google Scholar) and of the influenza M2 proton channel (30Pinto L.H. Dieckmann G.R. Gandhi C.S. Papworth C.G. Braman J. Shaugnessy M.A. Lear J.D. Lamb R.A. DeGrado W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11301-11306Google Scholar). In contrast to leucine zippers, the TMSs of some other membrane proteins interact via residue patterns of the type (abcd)n, where a and d residues are interfacial. Examples of the latter include glycophorin A (31Lemmon M.A. Flanagan J.M. Treutlein H.R. Zhang J. Engelman D.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12719-12725Google Scholar), the M13 major coat protein (32Deber C.M. Khan A.R. Zuomei L. Joensson C. Glibowicka M. Wang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11648-11652Google Scholar), and SNARE proteins (33Laage R. Langosch D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 540-546Google Scholar, 34Laage R. Rohde J. Brosig B. Langosch D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17481-17487Google Scholar). Computer modeling (35Fleming K.G. Engelman D.M. Proteins. 2001; 45: 313-317Google Scholar) and NMR studies (36MacKenzie K.R. Prestegard J.H. Engelman D.M. Science. 1997; 276: 131-133Google Scholar, 37Smith S.O. Song D. Shekar S. Groesbeek M. Ziliox M. Aimoto S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6553-6558Google Scholar) showed that these TMSs adopt negative crossing angles. An unexpected observation made in this study was that asparagine had a much stronger impact on mEpoR TMS-TMS interaction when located in the central versus the terminal regions. This finding is likely to result from two overlapping effects. First, the central region around Leu241 may be more efficiently packed than the termini. This is supported by the fact that the disruptive effect of mutation to alanine was more pronounced here than elsewhere in the sequence. This explanation does not, however, resolve why alanines at positions 231, 234, and 238 have similar impacts, whereas asparagine exerts a much weaker impact at position 231 compared with the other a and d positions. Second, therefore, we suggest that the ability of asparagine to promote TMS-TMS assembly may be influenced by a polarity gradient in the lipid bilayer. As outlined above, enhancement of binding affinity between TMSs by asparagine results from formation of strong hydrogen bonds (18Zhou F.X. Cocco M.J. Russ W.P. Brunger A.T. Engelman D.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 154-160Google Scholar, 19Choma C. Gratkowski H. Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 161-166Google Scholar). Because hydrogen bonds are essentially electrostatic in nature, their strength critically depends on the polarity of the immediate environment. Consequently, a polarity gradient across the inner bacterial membrane may partially be responsible for the differential effect of asparagines on TMS-TMS assembly. Indeed, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy previously revealed a respective polarity gradient in model membranes (38Subczynski W.K. Wisniewska A. Yin J.-J. Hyde J.S. Kusumi A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7670-7681Google Scholar). Specifically, a membrane composed of mono-unsaturated phospholipids is highly nonpolar only at a central slab of its acyl chain region, and polarity increases toward peripheral regions. A similar picture emerged from neutron diffraction studies where it was found that the concentration of the strongly hydrophobic molecule hexane dissolved in a bilayer composed of unsaturated lipids peaked at its center and decreased toward its boundaries (39White S.H. King G.I. Cain J.E. Nature. 1981; 290: 161-163Google Scholar). The E. coli inner membrane with approximately equal fractions of saturated and mono-unsaturated phospholipids (40Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss R. Lin E.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. Vol. 1. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996Google Scholar) may exhibit a similar polarity gradient. Accordingly, TMSs are thought to experience the lowest polarity at their central regions, which in turn could account for increased strength of hydrogen bonding between asparagine residues from positions 234 to 245. In line with this, we detected a unequal distribution of the impact of asparagine also on self-assembly of a membrane-spanning oligoleucine sequence. This distribution was similar to the one seen here but not identical because it peaked exactly at the middle of the oligoleucine TMS at a site equivalent to mEpoR Ser238 (41Ruan W. Lindner E. Langosch D. Protein Sci. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). Thus, the position-specific ability of hydrogen bond-forming side chains to drive TMS-TMS interactions is not restricted to the mEpoR TMS. This conclusion is supported by a recent study addressing the effect of asparagine on self-assembly of a designed hydrophobic leucine zipper (42Lear J.D. Gratkowski H. Adamian L. Liang J. DeGrado W.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6400-6407Google Scholar). By analytical ultracentrifugation of corresponding synthetic peptides in detergent micelles, these authors showed that asparagine residues within the apolar region of the peptide provide a significantly larger driving force than an asparagine near the apolar/polar interface of the micelle. In sum, an increased density of side chain packing around Leu241 and a polarity gradient across the acyl chain region of the lipid bilayer may both contribute to the observed different impact of asparagine at different a and d positions along the TMS-TMS interface. Functional Implications—One interesting implication of the present study is that the same face of the mEpoR TM helix may alternatively mediate homophilic interaction or heterophilic binding to the TMS of gp55-P in cells infected with polycythemic Friend spleen focus forming virus. The disulfide-linked single-span homodimeric membrane protein gp55-P binds and activates the mEpoR, but not its human homolog, in an Epo-independent way. Constantinescu et al. (15Constantinescu S.N. Liu X. Beyer W. Fallon A. Shekar S. Henis Y.I. Smith S.O. Lodish J.F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3334-3347Google Scholar) have shown that functional interaction between gp55-P and the mEpoR depends on the TMS sequences of both proteins. Specifically, this heterophilic interaction requires Ser238 within the mEpoR TMS and Met390 of the gp55-P TMS. Therefore, both residues appear to be localized within the gp55-P-mEpoR TMS-TMS interface. Based on these experimental results, computational searching of low energy structures and model building provided a three-dimensional model of this interface and predicted that it corresponds to a left-handed leucine zipper stabilized by van der Waals' interactions (15Constantinescu S.N. Liu X. Beyer W. Fallon A. Shekar S. Henis Y.I. Smith S.O. Lodish J.F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3334-3347Google Scholar). Interestingly, residues Ser231, Leu234, Ser238, Leu241, and Ala245 that account for homophilic assembly of the mEpoR TMS as identified in the present study correspond precisely to the residues contacting the gp55-P TMS in this model. Thus, homophilic interaction of the mEpoR TMSs may compete with its heterophilic interaction with the gp55-P TMS in the membrane of an infected erythroid cell. How this heterophilic TMS-TMS interaction induces constitutive mEpoR activity is presently not clear. Further, we assessed whether enhanced TMS-TMS interaction would lead to constitutive mEpoR activation. When we characterized the proliferative activity of different variants of full-length mEpoR in a hematopoietic cell line, we found that the mutation L241N that had the strongest impact on TMS-TMS assembly in bacterial membranes did not induce Epo-independent receptor activity. Control experiments showed that the observed lack of constitutive activation is not due to reduced stability of the mutant receptor. The TMS mutation rendered the receptor more resistant to proteolytic degradation in the cell but resulted in reduced surface expression of the mutant receptor. It has been shown previously that cell surface expression is already quite inefficient for the wild-type receptor whose majority is retained intracellularly. We show that the mutant receptor is fully functional despite its decreased cell surface expression because it mediates wild-type level BaF3 cell proliferation at Epo concentrations of 0.5 or 1 unit/ml. Thus, the TMS mutation did not reduce stability of the receptor or its capability to convert Epo binding to intracellular signaling. Taken together, therefore, strengthening TMS-TMS interaction appears not to be sufficient for constitutive activation of the receptor. This notion is in agreement with the previous observation that exchange of the mEpoR TMS for that of the strongly homodimerizing glycophorin A resulted in a receptor that can be activated by Epo but is also not constitutively active (10Constantinescu S.N. Keren T. Socolovsky M. Nam H.S. Henis Y.I. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4379-4384Google Scholar). Several functionally related growth factor receptors were previously shown to be constitutively activated by TMS mutations in different hereditary diseases. For example, the neu tyrosine kinase receptor is activated by a substitution of Val664 within its TMS for a glutamic acid residue (43Weiner D.B. Liu J. Cohen J.A. Williams W.V. Greene M.I. Nature. 1989; 339: 230-231Google Scholar) that appears to induce permanent receptor dimerization by interhelical hydrogen bond formation (44Smith S.O. Smith C.S. Bormann B.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 252-258Google Scholar). The tyrosine kinase activity of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 is activated by a glycine to arginine exchange within its TMS in patients suffering from achondroplasia (45Webster M. Donoghue J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 520-527Google Scholar). Further, mutating Ser498 of the thrombo-poietin receptor TMS to asparagine rendered this receptor constitutively active (46Onishi M. Mui A.L.F. Morikawa Y. Cho L. Kinoshita S. Nolan G.P. Gorman D.M. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Blood. 1996; 88: 1399-1406Google Scholar), and mutation of Thr617 to asparagine within the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor TMS as found in patients with acute myeloid leukemia conferred growth factor independence in expressing cells (47Forbes L.V. Gale R.E. Pizzey A. Pouwels K. Nathwani A. Linch D.C. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5981-5989Google Scholar). Thus, stabilization of TMS-TMS interaction by hydrogen bond-forming residues may cause constitutive activation of some, but not all, types of growth factor receptors, pointing at subtle differences in activation mechanisms.

Although the roles of the TFB and TFIIB N-terminal domains in transcription initiation and start-site selection have been well characterized, the structural and mechanistic basis of these roles has remained undefined. In published work, systematic site-specific protein-DNA photocrosslinking has been used to characterize the structural organization of eukaryal transcription initiation complexes (43.Lagrange T.

Thomm M. Geiduschek E.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 782-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)). Here, we report the use of systematic site-specific protein-DNA photocrosslinking to define the structural organization of the part of an archaeal transcription initiation complex upstream of the transcription start site (positions –40 to +1; nontemplate and template strands), the part that contains binding determinants for RNAP subunits and general transcription factors. Our results confirm the anticipated high degree of homology between the archaeal and eukaryal transcription systems and identify an unanticipated interaction between the TFB N-terminal domain and promoter DNA in the transcription-bubble region, upstream of and at the transcription start site. The results immediately suggest a mechanistic basis for the role of TFB and TFIIB N-terminal domains in transcription initiation and start-site selection. PfRNAP—Under anaerobic conditions, frozen Pyrococcus furiosus cell paste (15 g, prepared as in Bryant and Adams (48.Bryant F.O. Adams M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5070-5079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) was resuspended in 82 ml of ice-cold 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 22 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol, and cells were lysed in two passes through a French press operating at 1200 p.s.i. After the addition of Polymin P to 0.4% w/v and stirring for 30 min at room temperature, the sample was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 4 h at 4 °C, the pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of the same buffer, and the sample again was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 4 h at 4 °C. The pellet was extracted 3 times with 100 ml of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1.2 m NH4Cl, 10 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol, extracts were pooled, ammonium sulfate was added to 70% saturation, the sample was stirred for 1 h on ice, and the sample was again centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 4 h at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was aerobically resuspended in 100 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm EDTA, and 20% glycerol) and dialyzed against three changes of 1 liter of the same buffer for 12 h at 4 °C (12–14-kDa molecular weight cut-off dialysis tubing (SpectraPor)). The sample was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The sample was loaded onto a 220-ml DEAE-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated in buffer A and eluted with 2 liters of a linear gradient of 100% buffer A to 100% buffer B (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 m KCl, 10 mm EDTA, and 20% glycerol). Fractions containing DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNAP) activity (49.Burgess R.R. Jendrisak J.J. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4634-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 50.Thomm M. Robb F.T.

The column was eluted with a 300-ml linear gradient of 15 to 100% buffer B. Pooled fractions containing RNAP activity were concentrated and dialyzed against buffer A for 12 h at 4 °C. The sample was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and loaded onto a Mono Q 10/10 column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was eluted with a 100-ml linear gradient of 10–100% buffer B. Pooled fractions containing polymerase activity were concentrated and stored as aliquots at –80 °C. Yield, ∼4.7 μg. PfTBP—Plasmid PfTBP/pT7–7, which encodes PfTBP under control of the bacteriophage T7 gene 10 promoter, was constructed by replacing the NdeI-BamHI segment of plasmid pT7–7 (51.Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2459) Google Scholar) with a NdeI-BamHI DNA fragment containing the PfTBP-coding sequence (prepared by add-on PCR using P. furiosus genomic DNA as template (a gift of F. Jenney, University of Georgia, Athens, GA)). Transformants of Escherichia coli strain BL-21 DE3 (Novagen) with plasmid PfTBP/pT7–7 were cultured at 37 °C in 4 liters of LB medium (Fisher) to an A600 of ∼0.9, induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to 0.1 mm, cultured an additional 4 h at 37 °C (A600 ∼ 2.0), and harvested by centrifugation at 300 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Cell pellets (10–12 g) were frozen and stored at –80 °C until used. Cells were thawed by suspension in 60 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.8), 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml DNase I) and were lysed by sonication; the lysate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 50 min at 4 °C. After incubation of the supernatant for 30 min at 70 °C, the sample was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 50 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was loaded onto a 2.5 × 10-cm Q-Sepharose benchtop column (Amersham Biosciences), the column was washed with 500 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8), and the column was eluted with a 150-ml linear gradient of 0–600 mm KCl in the same buffer. Pooled fractions containing PfTBP (50 ml; ∼300 mm KCl) were desalted into 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.8) and concentrated to 2 ml by ultrafiltration at 4 °C (200-ml ultrafiltration unit (Amicon) with YM3 membrane (Millipore)). The sample was loaded onto a 1 × 10-cm Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences), and the column was eluted with a 55-ml linear gradient of 0–600 mm KCl in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0). Pooled fractions containing PfTBP (5 ml; ∼400 mm KCl) were exchanged into 50 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.8), 500 mm KCl, concentrated by ultrafiltration through a YM3 membrane (Millipore) at 4 °C, and stored in aliquots at –70 °C. SDS-PAGE indicated an ∼21-kDa protein, corresponding to the expected molecular mass of PfTBP. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry revealed a single molecular ion series of 21,285 atomic mass units (predicted, 21,311 atomic mass units). The yield was ∼40 mg, and purity was ∼95%. PfTFB—Plasmid pMLtfb (52.Zeng Q. Lewis L.M. Colangelo C.M. Dong J. Scott R.A. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 162-168Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar), which encodes PfTFB under control of the bacteriophage T7 gene 10 promoter, was introduced by transformation into E. coli strain BL-21 DE3 (Novagen). Growth, induction, harvesting, lysis, and clarification were performed as described above for PfTBP. The supernatant was loaded onto a 2.5 × 20-cm phosphocellulose column (Whatman), the column was washed extensively with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8), and the column was eluted with 150 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.8) and 500 mm KCl. The sample was concentrated to ∼2 ml by ultrafiltration through a YM3 membrane (Millipore) at 4 °C and loaded onto a 2.6 × 60-cm Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences), and the column was eluted in 5-ml fractions of the same buffer. Pooled fractions containing PfTFB (20 ml) were stored in aliquots of 500 μl at –70 °C. SDS-PAGE analysis indicated a ∼34-kDa protein, corresponding to the expected molecular mass of PfTFB. The yield was ∼25 mg, and the purity was ∼95%. Derivatized Promoter DNA Fragments—M13mp18-gdh and M13mp19-gdh were constructed by replacement of the EcoRI-SphI segments of, respectively, M13mp18 and M13mp19 (New England Biolabs) by EcoRI-SphI DNA fragments containing positions –75 to +45 of the P. furiosus gdh promoter (prepared by add-on PCR using as template plasmid pLU479 (Ref. 8.Hethke C.

Thomm, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany). Promoter DNA fragments containing a phenyl azide photoactivable cross-linking agent incorporated at a single, defined DNA phosphate and containing an adjacent 32P label were prepared using M13mp18-gdh (for analysis of the template strand) and M13mp19-gdh (for analysis of the nontemplate strand) as templates by the method of Naryshkin et al. (47.Naryshkin N. Kim Y. Dong Q. Ebright R.H. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 148: 337-361PubMed Google Scholar), except that after the primer extension and ligation steps products were digested with FcpI and AvaII, 5′ overhanging ends were filled in using DNA polymerase Klenow fragment (Promega) and dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP (Amersham Biosciences), and 5′ phosphates at ends and nicks were removed using calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Promega; 3 units for 45 min at 37 °C) (filling of 5′ overhanging ends and removal of 5′ phosphates from ends and nicks significantly reduced nonspecific crosslinking by end- and nick-bound PfRNAP 2M. B. Renfrow, unpublished data.). Site-specific Protein-DNA Photocrosslinking—Reaction mixtures (43 μl) contained 0 or 2 nm PfRNAP, 1 nm PfTBP, 1 nm PfTFB, 1 nm derivatized promoter DNA fragment (200 Bq/fmol), and 40 μg/ml heparin in transcription buffer (40 mm HEPES (pH 6.5), 250 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 6 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.4 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.4 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 8% glycerol) at 70 °C. Reaction mixtures were prepared by the incubation of 2 nm PfTBP and 2 nm derivatized promoter DNA fragment (200 Bq/fmol) in 20 μl of transcription buffer for 10 min at 70 °C followed by the addition of0or2nm PfRNAP and 2 nm PfTFB in 20 μl of transcription buffer and incubation for 10 min at 70 °C. This was followed in experiments performed in the presence of PfRNAP by the addition of 3 μl of 583 μg/ml heparin and incubation for 2 min at 70 °C. Crosslinking, nuclease digestion, and product analysis were performed by a modification of the procedures of Naryshkin et al. (47.Naryshkin N. Kim Y. Dong Q. Ebright R.H. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 148: 337-361PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures were UV-irradiated for 60 s (11 mJ/mm2 at 365 nm) in a Spectrolinker XL-1000 UV crosslinker (Fisher). Reaction vessels were siliconized polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes contained within borosilicate glass culture tubes (16 × 100 mm) filled with water pre-equilibrated to 70 °C. Crosslinked polypeptides were identified by performing nuclease digestion (the addition of 2 μl of 100 mm CaCl2 and 10 units/μl DNase I (Sigma) and incubation for 10 min at 37 °C followed by the addition of 1 μl of 10% SDS and incubation for 5 min at 70 °C followed by the addition of 1 μl of 30 units/μl S1 nuclease (Roche Applied Science) and incubation for 10 min at 37 °C), SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography.

For each DNA fragment, we analyzed crosslinking both in the PfTFB-PfTBP-promoter complex and in the PfRNAP-PfTFB-PfTBP-promoter complex.

The first step of viral replication is, thus, the annealing of the primer tRNA onto the primer binding site located in the 5′ leader region of the viral RNA. This involves large rearrangements of both RNA structures and requires the chaperone activity of the viral nucleocapsid protein. We have developed a novel approach to analyze dynamically such RNA refolding events using heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy of mixtures of 15N-labeled and unlabeled large RNA fragments (up to 50 kDa). We have thus been able to characterize the detailed mechanisms of both heat- and nucleocapsid-mediated annealing and to identify previously unknown key steps. The role played by the nucleocapsid is 2-fold; it facilitates strand exchange at the level of the tRNA acceptor stem, presumably via its basic N- and C-terminal extensions, and it unlocks the highly stable tertiary interactions at the level of the TΨC loop, most likely by specific interactions involving its two zinc knuckles.

Structured RNAs have been found to be involved in an increasing number of fundamental biological functions. These structures are often quite plastic, and rearrangements of RNA folds have been described to act as switches or recognition elements in a large number of biological processes, mRNA splicing, translational control of gene expression, ribosome function, ribosome recruitment, antisense gene silencing, viral replication, retrotransposition. In several cases these structural rearrangements have been shown to require the action of “helper” proteins such as RNA helicases or RNA chaperones (1Staley J.P. Guthrie C. Mol.

A large amount of data has been gathered on the factors required for such RNA rearrangements in terms of nucleotide sequence or associated proteic factors and sometimes on the structure of the starting and final states. However, at a molecular level, very little is known regarding the actual dynamic mechanism of such refolding events. This is because it is technically difficult to track the sequence of fleeting events using classical structural biology techniques. So far the most successful approaches have used various types of fluorescence spectroscopy, which can provide useful dynamical data even for very short time scales (4Rist M.J. Marino J.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14762-14770Google Scholar, 5Bernacchi S. Stoylov S. Piemont E. Ficheux D. Roques B.P. Darlix J.L. Mely Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 385-399Google Scholar). However, it is difficult to derive detailed structural information from such analyses for regions of the molecule afar from the chromophore(s). The present study addresses the major structural RNA rearrangements that occur when tRNA3Lys, the primer of HIV-1 1The abbreviations used are: HIVhuman immunodeficiency virusPBSprimer binding siteNOESYtwo-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopyTROSYtransverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy. reverse transcriptase, is annealed onto the viral genome. This system has been characterized extensively by numerous biochemical and virological studies. The 18 nucleotides at the 3′ end of the tRNA are complementary to a segment of the 5′untranslated region of viral genome, the primer binding site (PBS). Within the viral particle the primer tRNA is already placed onto the viral RNA (6Jiang M. Mak J. Ladha A. Cohen E. Klein M. Rovinski B. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3246-3253Google Scholar) with which it forms extended secondary and tertiary interactions. In addition to the tRNA·PBS duplex formation, additional interactions have indeed been proposed to take place, in particular between the U-rich anticodon of the tRNA and an A-rich loop located immediately upstream from the PBS with the viral RNA (7Beerens N. Groot F. Berkhout B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4130-4137Google Scholar, 8Beerens N. Berkhout B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15474-15481Google Scholar, 9Isel C. Marquet R. Keith G. Ehresmann C.

This complex RNA assembly appears to be involved in the recruitment of reverse transcriptase and is required for efficient initiation of viral replication in vivo (12Zhang Z. Kang S.M. Morrow C.D. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1998; 14: 979-988Google Scholar). The formation of an initiation-proficient complex does not occur spontaneously at physiological temperature but requires the action of the viral nucleocapsid protein (3Barat C. Lullien V. Schatz O.

The mechanism by which the nucleocapsid promotes annealing of the primer tRNA and the exact sequence of events remain obscure. It was originally observed that in the absence of magnesium excess NC was capable of denaturing tRNA but that magnesium rendered tRNA resistant to this destabilization (14Khan R. Giedroc D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6689-6695Google Scholar). This suggested that NC could possibly act as an RNA helicase, at least under certain conditions. More recent studies using a variety of biophysical techniques show that this is probably not the case, and per se the NC cannot “open” tRNA3Lys (15Gregoire C.J. Gautheret D. Loret E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25143-25148Google Scholar, 16Tisne C. Roques B.P. Dardel F. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 443-454Google Scholar, 17Hargittai M.R. Mangla A.T. Gorelick R.J. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 985-997Google Scholar), although some degree of destabilization of RNA structures by NC has been observed (5Bernacchi S. Stoylov S. Piemont E. Ficheux D. Roques B.P. Darlix J.L. Mely Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 385-399Google Scholar, 16Tisne C. Roques B.P. Dardel F. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 443-454Google Scholar). It is, thus, likely that the viral RNA is also required to disrupt the primer structure, assisted by the chaperone activity of the viral nucleocapsid. The dynamic mechanism of this process is, however, still unknown as only the initial and final states have been characterized. Using heteronuclear NMR of RNA-RNA-protein complexes under controlled temperature conditions we have been able to observe the progressive formation of the HIV-1 reverse transcription initiation complex in a quasi-continuous fashion. In particular we have identified the nucleation site where the viral RNA starts invading the tRNA3Lys structure, and we have characterized previously unexpected intermediates and differentially annealed states. We were also able to characterize the different roles of the nucleocapsid in these various steps and to propose a detailed model of the NC-mediated annealing process. The viral protein plays a key role by “unlocking” stable tertiary interactions within the primer tRNA. Samples—Recombinant 15N-labeled tRNA3Lys was expressed in vivo and purified as previously described (18Tisne C. Rigourd M. Marquet R. Ehresmann C. Dardel F. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1403-1412Google Scholar). The PBS (18 nucleotides) and the HIV-1 A-rich loop (25 nucleotides) were purchased from either Dharmacon research or MWG Biotech. The sequences of RNA samples used in this study are indicated in Fig. 1. The HIV-1 viral RNA fragment (65 nucleotides) that contains both the PBS and the HIV-1 A-rich loop spans nucleotides 132-196 of the full-length viral RNA (HIV-1Mal isolate). The NCp7-(1-55) protein was obtained by chemical synthesis as already reported (19de Rocquigny H. Ficheux D. Gabus C. Fournie-Zaluski M.C. Darlix J.L. Roques B.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 1010-1018Google Scholar) and used as the zinc-complexed form (20de Rocquigny H. Gabus C. Vincent A. Fournié-Zaluski M.C. Roques B. Darlix J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6472-6476Google Scholar). Poly-l-lysine (molecular mass 4,000-15,000 g/mol) was from Sigma-Aldrich. Samples were dissolved in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 10% 2H2O. The interaction between the tRNA3Lys and the HIV-1 A-loop was carried out at 0.5 mm concentrations of each species in 100 mm NaCl and 5-10 mm MgCl2 according to a previous study that measured the equilibrium binding constant of tRNA3Lys complexed with the HIV-1 A-loop in various salt conditions (21Bajji A.C. Sundaram M. Myszka D.G. Davis D.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 14302-14303Google Scholar). The interaction between the tRNA3Lys and the PBS was performed in 300 mm KCl at an RNA concentration of 0.4 mm each for the temperature jump or 1 mm each for the progressively heated sample. The interaction between the tRNA3Lys and the PBS in the presence of NCp7-(1-55) protein was conducted as follows. tRNA3Lys at a concentration of 0.35 mm was first mixed with 2 eq of the NC protein, and reference NMR experiments (NOESY and transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy (TROSY); see NMR section) were first performed at both 15 and 30 °C; the sample was then taken out of the spectrometer, and 1 eq of PBS was added. Similar conditions were used for the study with 2 eq of the poly-l-lysine. For all experiments involving the addition PBS oligoribonucleotides to the tRNA sample, the two RNA solutions were cooled on ice before the mixing, and the sample was immediately transferred to the NMR spectrometer to minimize the start of the annealing process before data acquisition. For the temperature jump the tRNA3Lys·PBS mix was heated directly to 50 °C using the NMR spectrometer variable temperature unit. For the progressive heating procedure the tRNA3Lys·PBS mix was heated from 15 to 80 °C by increments of 5 or 10 °C, and NMR spectra were recorded at each step. At higher temperatures the exchange rate of imino protons with water is, however, increased and can severely broaden some peaks. Therefore, after recording experiments at each temperature step, the samples were subsequently cooled back to 15 °C, and NMR experiments were also recorded under conditions identical to the reference spectra. For the study of the formation of the tRNA3Lys·PBS complex in the presence of 2 eq of NC (or poly-l-lysine), the NMR sample were heated from 5 to 35 °C by steps of 10 °C to stay within physiological conditions and avoid denaturation of the protein. In all cases, when the tRNA3Lys·PBS annealing was completed, a stoichiometric amount of the A-rich loop RNA fragment was added to the sample, and a TROSY experiment at 15 °C was recorded in the presence of 100 mm NaCl and 5-10 mm MgCl2. The interaction between the larger HIV-1 viral fragment (65 nucleotides) and tRNA3Lys was performed at 1 mm concentrations of each species under the same buffer and temperature conditions as the tRNA3Lys·PBS complex. NMR—Two-dimensional spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance DRX600 spectrometer equipped with a standard triple resonance probe. Two-dimensional NOESY experiments in 90% H2O, 10% 2H2O were recorded at various temperatures (see above) with mixing times of 150 ms when the tRNA3Lys·PBS complex was not formed or 120 ms after formation of the complex. The spectral widths were 12,600 Hz in both dimensions. 512 t1 increments were recorded each with 2048 data points. The solvent signal suppression was performed using the “jump and return” sequence (22Plateau P. Guéron M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 7310-7311Google Scholar). 1H 15N TROSY (23Weigelt J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 10778-10779Google Scholar) experiments were carried out with 256 t1 increments and 1024 data points per increment. The spectral widths were 4500 Hz and 2494 Hz in the proton and nitrogen dimensions, respectively. NMR analysis of large RNA complexes remains technically challenging. We, therefore, proceeded by a stepwise strategy, analyzing smaller complexes first (see the RNA fragments used in Fig. 1) and then using the assignments and data collected on these for the larger assemblies. Selective 15N labeling of primer tRNA3Lys within the complex also allowed editing of signals from the other partners, and the use of TROSY improved the resolution on the large complexes. Assignment of thetRNA3Lys·PBS Complex—To be able to follow by NMR the appearance of the complex between the primer tRNA and the PBS, the first step was to assign the imino resonances of the RNA duplex corresponding to the PBS annealed to the acceptor and T arms of tRNA3Lys (Fig. 2a). For this purpose, we used the tRNA3Lys·PBS complex annealed in the presence of NC for 48 h at 35 °C, conditions which yield a unique, well defined assembly (see below). In the annealed complex, most of the resonances corresponding to the native tRNA3Lys fold have disappeared, including those specific of the tertiary structure, i.e. the T54-A58 reverse-Hoogsteen pair, the G18-Ψ55 interaction or the base triple C13-G22-m7G46. These are replaced by a new set of peaks (Fig. 2), which were assigned as follows: N1 of G and N3 of U can be easily distinguished by their 15N chemical shifts (Fig. 2, b and c). Because the PBS is not 15N-labeled, only the imino groups of tRNA3Lys are observable in the TROSY experiments, whereas imino signals of both tRNA3Lys and PBS are observable in NOESY experiments. U66 and U67 were readily assigned as two NOE-connected 15N-labeled uridines. U67 gives an NOE with an unlabeled guanine that, therefore, belongs to the PBS (G187), whereas U66 is connected to the 15N-labeled guanine G65. This pattern of connections can only exist in the context of tRNA3Lys·PBS complex. From G65, the assignment walk down to G194 is unambiguous (Fig. 2c); on the other side, G187 is weakly connected to G69 at 12.23 ppm (not shown). From G69 we could easily assign G70, G71 (15N-labeled), and G183 (unlabeled). At this step, the only peaks that remained unassigned were a non-labeled G at 13.25 ppm, connected to a 15N-labeled G at 12.96 ppm and to a non-labeled G at 12.37 ppm. This pattern corresponds to G181 (13.25 ppm), G73 (12.96ppm), and G180 at 12.37 ppm. U60 and G61 could not be assigned but possibly corresponds to some of the weak remaining G and U peaks seen in TROSY experiments. The assignments of most of the tRNA3Lys·PBS complex imino protons, thus, obtained were crucial because they demonstrate the existence of a fully annealed complex. The corresponding peaks were then used as a signature of the presence of the complex in the various NMR samples. The Heat-annealedtRNA3Lys·PBS Complex—To characterize the dynamics and the limiting steps of the annealing process, the behavior of a stoichiometric mixture of tRNA3Lys and the 18-nucleotide PBS was analyzed first as a function of temperature. The two RNAs were mixed on ice, and the sample temperature was gradually increased (see “Experimental Procedures”). The first significant event occurs at 15 °C, as weak peaks corresponding to U66 and U67 imino protons in the complex context start appearing on the NOESY experiments (not shown) and on the TROSY experiment where, additionally, the peak corresponding to U64 in the tRNA3Lys·PBS complex can also be seen (Fig. 3a). The lower part of the tRNA acceptor stem, which contains U66 and U67, thus appear to be the starting point of the formation of the tRNA3Lys·PBS complex. It is also possible that the unpaired GCCA 3′ terminus anneals with the PBS at this early stage, but this could not be unambiguously observed on our data, as only G73 carries a 15N-attached imino proton, and its resonance overlaps with that of G65 in the free tRNA. When the temperature was increased to 25 °C, all resonances corresponding to the annealed acceptor stem in the tRNA3Lys·PBS complex could be observed and increased in intensity, but the resonances corresponding to free tRNA3Lys remained clearly observable, indicating that both species co-exist in the sample in comparable amounts (Fig. 4). The ratio between the two species did not vary over several days, indicating that this situation corresponded to an equilibrium. A NOESY experiment recorded on the sample did not reveal any exchange peaks, but interestingly, all NOE cross-peaks originating from the acceptor stem imino protons had vanished in this experiment, including the strong G6-U67 intra-base pair contact (not shown), whereas all NOE connections could still be observed for the D and T stem imino protons. This indicates that the acceptor stem undergoes a faster conformational exchange that broadens the corresponding peaks down to the noise level. When the sample was heated above 40 °C and up to 60 °C, the ratio of the peaks corresponding to the free tRNA3Lysversus those of the tRNA3Lys·PBS complex decreased. However, the resonances corresponding to the tertiary interactions involving T54 and Ψ55 remained observable. Heating to 80 °C was required to obtain a complete disappearance of these peaks and a full conversion to the annealed complex form, as obtained above with the NC (Fig. 3, b-c). Gradually heating the complex, however, resulted in a mixture of two forms of the annealed complex, with conformational heterogeneity at the level of U66 and U67 (peaks labeled a or b on Fig. 3). Form a appears before form b upon heating. This heterogeneity is not observed when the sample is quickly heated to 50 °C or when it is annealed in the presence of NC where only form a is present. Depending upon the heating protocol, some structural heterogeneity can, therefore, be observed. The spectra of the final forms obtained by temperature jump or NC annealing are extremely similar, confirming previous studies using chemical and enzymatic probing (24Brule F. Marquet R. Rong L. Wainberg M.A. Roques B.P. Le Grice S.F. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. RNA (N. Y.). 2002; 8: 8-15Google Scholar). Nucleocapsid Mediated Annealing of the PBS—The formation of the initiation complex in the presence of the nucleocapsid protein was monitored in a similar fashion. Fig. 5a shows the superimposition of TROSY experiments of a sample containing tRNA3Lys with 2 eq of NCp7-(1-55) protein before and after adding a stoichiometric amount of the PBS. Over the time course of the experiments, ∼10 h, we observed the appearance of imino resonances characteristic of the duplex formed between the tRNA3Lys and the PBS. However, only a fraction of the primer tRNA molecules present in the sample was annealed to the PBS, and all the resonances of unannealed tRNA3Lys imino groups are still observable (Fig. 5a). Interestingly, ∼24 h later, only the resonances of the complex remained visible, with the exception of traces of T54 and Ψ55 peaks (Fig. 5b). Therefore, at 15 °C NC already mediates the slow formation of the initiation complex, even at a low ratio of protein per nucleotide. Heating the sample to 35 °C resulted in the disappearance of the T54 and Ψ55 resonances, even after cooling the sample back to 15 °C (see Fig. 2b). Thus, at physiological temperatures, the NC allows a complete annealing of the PBS to the primer tRNA by disrupting the stable TΨC/D loop interactions. It has recently been reported that poly-l-lysine can substitute for the NC protein in annealing tRNA3Lys to the PBS (17Hargittai M.R. Mangla A.T. Gorelick R.J. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 985-997Google Scholar), suggesting that this reaction could be dominated by electrostatic effects. The formation of the tRNA3Lys·PBS complex in the presence of poly-l-lysine was thus investigated under conditions identical to those used for the NC-mediated annealing. As for the NC, poly-l-lysine promoted rapid strand invasion of the tRNA by the PBS RNA fragment (Fig. 6). At 35 °C, all resonances corresponding to the acceptor and T stems had disappeared (not shown). However, poly-l-lysine failed to unfold the tertiary interactions within the TΨC loop, as the Ψ55 and T54 resonances remained observable (see the T54 resonance in Fig. 6b). Hence, the complex formed in the presence of poly-l-lysine is structurally different from that obtained with NC, as the tRNA structure is incompletely melted. Interaction between the A-rich Loop and thetRNA3Lys—In addition to the helix formed by the PBS and the 3′ end of the primer, the viral RNA contacts the anticodon base of tRNA3Lys via an A-rich loop located immediately upstream from the PBS (Fig. 1). Post-transcriptional modification of nucleotides within the tRNA anticodon have been shown to be crucial for this loop-loop interaction (9Isel C. Marquet R. Keith G. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25269-25272Google Scholar, 21Bajji A.C. Sundaram M. Myszka D.G. Davis D.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 14302-14303Google Scholar). The labeled tRNA used in these studies was expressed in vivo and, thus, contains several of these modifications, including 2-thiolation of the uridine in position 34 (s2U34) and threonyl-carbamoyl adenosine in position 37 (t6A37) (18Tisne C. Rigourd M. Marquet R. Ehresmann C. Dardel F. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1403-1412Google Scholar). Such a modified recombinant tRNA was shown to induce reverse transcription pauses at position +16 (18Tisne C. Rigourd M. Marquet R. Ehresmann C. Dardel F. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1403-1412Google Scholar), a hallmark of the A-rich loop/anticodon interaction also observed with natural tRNA3Lys but not with naked transcripts (25Isel C. Lanchy J.M. Le Grice S.F.J. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 917-924Google Scholar). We thus tried to find direct evidence for this interaction in samples containing both the 15N-labeled primer tRNA3Lys and an RNA oligonucleotide corresponding to the A-rich stem-loop (Fig. 1). In TROSY experiments, the additional A-U pairs predicted to mediate this interaction should become visible, as the corresponding imino protons are carried by the anticodon loop uridines of the tRNA, which is 15N-labeled. Whatever the conditions tested, free tRNA3Lys or tRNA3Lys annealed to the PBS either with or without NC and with or without Mg2+, we failed to detect any additional convincing uridine cross-peak in these experiments even at low temperature (5 °C). However, we consistently observed a strong reduction or even a complete disappearance of the NH peak corresponding to the threonyl moiety of t6A37 (not shown), which is located immediately next to these uridines within the anticodon (see Fig. 1). It should be emphasized that this resonance does not correspond to an imino group but to an amide group that is much less sensitive to chemical exchange with the solvent. It is in particular not sensitive to the addition of salt, NC, or Mg2+ or to temperature. Hence, its disappearance probably reflects a broadening resulting from conformational exchange at the level of the anticodon loop. It is, therefore, likely that this loop-loop interaction does take place within our NMR sample but that it is weak and the lifetime of the intermolecular A-U base pairs are too short to be directly detected (i.e. ≤1 ms). Interaction with the Whole PBS Region of the Viral RNA— Because tRNA3Lys makes extended interactions with the PBS, it was of interest to investigate its interaction with a larger RNA fragment encompassing both the PBS and the A-rich loop. The larger 65-nucleotide fragment shown in Fig. 1 was used because it recapitulates most of the structured regions present in the two-dimensional structure of the reverse transcription initiation complex reported by Isel et al. (11Isel C. Westhof E. Massire C. Le Grice S.F. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Marquet R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1038-1048Google Scholar), based on footprinting data. The results obtained with this larger RNA parallel those obtained with the smaller PBS fragment, with progressive strand invasion resulting in appearance of a new set of peaks. As the annealing proceeds the line widths of peaks in standard proton experiments (one-dimensional and two-dimensional NOESY) became very broad, in keeping with the large size of the complex (141 nucleotides, i.e. ∼50 Kd); however, the heteronuclear TROSY experiments remained sufficiently well resolved for analysis (see Fig. 7). The resonances corresponding to the annealed form appear at the same position as those observed for the minimal PBS fragment (compare Fig. 7 to Fig. 4). This indicates that the mechanism of annealing and the final structure of the tRNA are similar. There are, however, two major specific features that are worth pointing out. (i) Compared with the smaller PBS fragment, slightly higher temperatures (∼5 to 10 °C) are required to obtain the same level of melting of the tRNA, presumably because of an increased steric hindrance or because the viral RNA fragment folds by itself into a more stable structure. (ii) The t6A37 resonance disappears immediately upon mixing the two RNAs even before heating the sample. Thus, the A-loop/anticodon interaction seems to take place also with this larger viral RNA fragment. Furthermore, this event precedes the melting of the tRNA structure. In the present work we performed a detailed NMR analysis of the annealing between human tRNA3Lys, the primer of HIV-1 reverse transcription, and the primer binding site on the viral genome. To our knowledge it is one the first detailed mechanistic analysis of an RNA molecular rearrangement mechanism at the base pair level. It allows us to decompose the annealing process into a defined sequence of events and to delineate the role of the viral nucleocapsid protein at different essential stages. The melting process appears to start at the bottom of the acceptor and TΨC stem, close to the four-way junction of the tRNA cloverleaf structure. This may appear counterintuitive at first but becomes less surprising if one considers tRNA3Lys nucleotide sequence. The tip of the acceptor and TΨC stem are very G/C-rich and, thus, are expected to be very stable. Furthermore, the TΨC loop of the tRNA is strongly stabilized by an extended network of tertiary interactions. These two parts of the structure probably act as structural “locks” on the tRNA3Lys fold. The cloverleaf junction, on the other hand, is closed by weaker pairs, A7-U66, G6-U67, and A50-U64, which correspond to the first nucleotides that switch to the annealed form at 15 °C (Fig. 3a). This is, thus, a “weak spot” through which the viral RNA can invade the primer structure; furthermore, we previously showed that NC further destabilizes this region of the tRNA structure (16Tisne C. Roques B.P. Dardel F. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 443-454Google Scholar). Additionally, PBS binding to the unpaired 3′ end of the tRNA, which does not involve melting of the latter, could provide either help in maintaining the two RNAs in close proximity and/or provide a second route to acceptor stem invasion. Interestingly, at close to physiological temperatures, a large part of the annealing takes place spontaneously in the absence of NC (Fig. 3b and 4), although there is an equilibrium between the free and annealed forms that is progressively shifted toward the annealed form as temperature increases. Annealing then proceeds along the tRNA acceptor stem, as evidenced by the disappearance of the corresponding NOE cross-peaks at 25 °C. On the other hand, the TΨC loop, which is closed by 3 consecutive G-C and tightened by tertiary interactions with the d-loop, resists melting and strand invasion up to 60 °C. This is in keeping with reports that heat annealing at 60 °C results in less efficient reverse transcription priming than heat-annealing at 85 °C (26Rong L. Liang C. Hsu M. Kleiman L. Petitjean P. de Rocquigny H. Roques B.P. Wainberg M.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9353-9358Google Scholar). In this context the role of the nucleocapsid in the annealing process appears to be 2-fold. (i) It greatly facilitates strand exchange at low temperatures, thus favoring complete hybridization of the acceptor stem under physiological conditions. This is consistent with previous data which show that HIV-1 NC is capable of enhancing the annealing of nucleic acid strands by as much as four orders of magnitude (27Dib-Hajj F. Khan R. Giedroc D.P. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 231-243Google Scholar). (ii) It permits the complete melting of the TΨC “lock,” required to obtain a full annealing. The first of these two activities can be mimicked by poly-l-lysine, suggesting that the energy barrier in this process is mostly electrostatic and, thus, can be effectively countered by a polycationic polymer. This observation is in agreement with several reports that indicate that the N- and C-terminal basic extensions of the nucleocapsid protein play a dominant role in this strand exchange process (17Hargittai M.R. Mangla A.T. Gorelick R.J. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 985-997Google Scholar, 20de Rocquigny H. Gabus C. Vincent A. Fournié-Zaluski M.C. Roques B. Darlix J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6472-6476Google Scholar). However, the second TΨC unlocking activity is nucleocapsid-specific and cannot be reproduced using poly-l-lysine. This suggests that the zinc knuckles could alternatively play an important part in this essential step. Interestingly, in the currently available structures of NC complexed with nucleic acids (28Morellet N. Demene H. Teilleux V. Huynh-Dinh T. de Rocquigny H. Fournie-Zaluski M.C. Roques B.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 419-434Google Scholar, 29De Guzman R.N. Wu Z.R. Stalling C.C. Pappalardo L. Borer P.N. Summers M.F. Science. 1998; 279: 384-388Google Scholar, 30Amarasinghe G.K. De Guzman R.N. Turner R.B. Chancellor K.J. Wu Z.R. Summers M.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 491-511Google Scholar) most of the specific contacts between the protein and the nucleic acid occur via the zinc knuckles. Furthermore, the NC protein interacts preferentially with the acceptor stem and the TΨC loop of both human tRNA3Lys (31Tisne C. Roques B.P. Dardel F. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 557-561Google Scholar) and yeast tRNAPhe (32Khan R. Chang H.O. Kaluarachchi K. Giedroc D.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3568-3575Google Scholar), and this recognition is dependent upon the NC zinc knuckles structure (31Tisne C. Roques B.P. Dardel F. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 557-561Google Scholar). In addition, in the presence of a shortened NC containing only the zinc knuckles, NCp7 (12-53), the apparent lifetime of the reverse-Hoogsteen T54-A58 pair within the TΨC loop, is reduced by a factor of 2.5 (16Tisne C. Roques B.P. Dardel F. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 443-454Google Scholar), confirming the role of these knuckles in altering the stability of this part of the tRNA. It is thus reasonable to assume that the nucleocapsid protein interacts with the tip of the TΨC stem/loop using a similar binding mode as that previously reported for two other stem-loops within the viral RNA, SL2, and the SL3 encapsidation signal (29De Guzman R.N. Wu Z.R. Stalling C.C. Pappalardo L. Borer P.N. Summers M.F. Science. 1998; 279: 384-388Google Scholar, 30Amarasinghe G.K. De Guzman R.N. Turner R.B. Chancellor K.J. Wu Z.R. Summers M.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 491-511Google Scholar), where the knuckles make key contacts with the loop. Such a binding could have two non-exclusive effects on the tRNA3Lys structure. (i) It could directly destabilize the TΨC loop within the tertiary structure of the tRNA. Several of the important aromatic residues within the knuckles could insert themselves between the loop nucleotides, acting as opening wedges, as previously described (28Morellet N. Demene H. Teilleux V. Huynh-Dinh T. de Rocquigny H. Fournie-Zaluski M.C. Roques B.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 419-434Google Scholar). (ii) By binding specifically to an open form of the TΨC loop, it could displace the equilibrium toward the unfolded form of tRNA3Lys. The sequence of events that results from this model of the annealing mechanism is schematized in Fig. 8. The role of the A-rich loop/anticodon interaction in the annealing process is less clear. Our data shows that this interaction is weak and apparently independent of the hybridization between the PBS sequence and the 3′ end of the primer tRNA. It can precede the annealing, which is not surprising, given that this loop-loop interaction does not require any structural rearrangement in either of the two RNA partners. It could possibly serve two non-exclusive purposes. (i) It could act as a guide interaction, ensuring a pre-positioning of the two partners before annealing. (ii) It could provide an additional structural specificity element for recognition by the reverse transcriptase. The HIV system studied here involves large RNA fragments by NMR standards, up to 141 nucleotides. The combined use of selective labeling and TROSY nevertheless allowed us to obtain high quality data. This shows that this technical approach is viable and therefore applicable to other RNAs, thereby opening the way to dynamic studies of other systems, such as those involved other retroviral replication events or in spliceosome function. Up to now most studies focusing on RNA refolding events have addressed the questions of what were the factors required for annealing (in terms of nucleotide sequence, chaperones, biochemical conditions, etc.) and what were the folds of the initial and final states. None of these earlier works addresses the question of the mechanism, which is how annealing actually proceeds. The present work provides such dynamic information at the molecular level by dissecting the RNA rearrangement process into a discrete sequence of events. This provides key information in the context of retroviral replication, actually merging a large number of previous data into a rational framework. For instance our model reconciles apparently conflicting data, suggesting on one hand that annealing can be performed by NC variants containing only the basic N- and C-terminal extensions and lacking the zinc knuckles (17Hargittai M.R. Mangla A.T. Gorelick R.J. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 985-997Google Scholar, 20de Rocquigny H. Gabus C. Vincent A. Fournié-Zaluski M.C. Roques B. Darlix J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6472-6476Google Scholar) and, on the other hand, that intact zinc knuckles are required for forming initiation proficient complexes (26Rong L. Liang C. Hsu M. Kleiman L. Petitjean P. de Rocquigny H. Roques B.P. Wainberg M.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9353-9358Google Scholar). Our results show that annealing is indeed promoted by polycationic molecules such as poly-lysine, which mimics the knuckle-deleted NC, but that the complex formed is structurally different from that obtained with the native NC. In the former case the persistence of some tertiary structure in the tRNA could interfere with the recruitment or placement of the reverse transcriptase. The identification of these partially annealed states and rate-limiting steps also offers another interesting opportunity; acting on these intermediates could provide to a new means to interfere with a very early step in the AIDS virus replication. We gratefully acknowledge Dr. Nelly Morellet for many constructive discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2117831271,"Connector enhancer of KSR (CNK) is a multidomain protein that participates in Ras signaling in Drosophila eye development. In this report we identify the human homologue of CNK, termed CNK2A, and a truncated alternatively spliced variant, CNK2B. We characterize CNK2 phosphorylation, membrane localization, and interaction with Ras effector molecules. Our results show that MAPK signaling appears to play a role in the phosphorylation of CNK2 in vivo. CNK2 is found in both membrane and cytoplasmic fractions of the cell. In MDCK cells, full-length CNK2 is localized to the lateral plasma membrane. Consistent with previous reports, we show CNK2 interacts with Raf. CNK2 interaction was mapped to the regulatory and kinase domains of Raf, as well as to the carboxyl-terminal half of CNK2. CNK2 also interacts with the Ral signaling components, Ral GTPase, and the RalGDS family member Rlf. CNK2 interaction was mapped to the GEF domain of Rlf. The ability of CNK2 to interact with both Ras effector proteins Raf and Rlf suggests that CNK2 may integrate signals between MAPK and Ral pathways through a complex interplay of components."

Although there is no pronounced sequence similarity among the AAAP transporters, they all recognize certain amino acids or closely related compounds and are highly sensitive to alterations in intracellular or extracellular proton concentrations.The first mammalian AAAP transporter identified was the vesicular GABA transporter VGAT, also designated the vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter (VIAAT). VGAT mediates the transport of the two inhibitory neurotransmitters, GABA and glycine, and appears to be expressed solely in the brain. As a neurotransmitter/proton antiporter (4.McIntire S.H.

Both classes play important roles in the homeostasis of various neutral amino acids in different tissues.

Both systems are Na+-dependent co-transporters but differ with respect to the role of protons in the transport process. System N mediates H+ efflux during Na+-dependent amino acid influx (9.Chaudhry F.A. Reimer R.J. Krizaj D. Barber D. Storm-Mathisen J. Copemhagen D.R. Edwards R.H.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that transport activity of PAT2 is dependent on external pH and membrane potential and that the protein has the ability to transport in the reverse mode.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRNA Isolation and RT-PCR—Total RNA from different mouse brain regions (olfactory bulb, cortex, thalamus, cerebellum, and brain stem) and spinal cord was isolated with RNAwiz (Ambion), following the supplier's protocol. 5 μg of total RNA were reverse transcribed by using oligo(dT) as primer and the Retroscript kit (Ambion). 2 μl of each RT reaction were subjected to PCR reactions with the following primer pairs: 1) PAT2-F1 (5′-ATG TCT GTG ACC AAG AGT GCC-3′) and PAT2-B546 (5′-GCA GCT GAT GGT TGT GCT GTT-3′); and 2) GAPDH-F (5′-GAC CAC AGT CCA TGA CAT CAC T-3′) and GAPDH-B (5′-TCC ACC ACC CTG TTG CTG TAG-3′). PCR conditions were 94 °C for 1 min and 30 × (94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s).Anti-PAT2 Antibody Production and Western Blot—A polyclonal antibody raised against the peptide CLDLIKSGNSPAL (amino acid residues 457–469 of the mouse PAT2 protein, GenBank™ accession number AAM80481) with the N-terminal cysteine coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin was produced in rabbit (Davids Biotechnologie). The antibody was affinity-purified on the peptide linked to Affi-Gel.For Western blot analysis, 50 μg of crude protein prepared from mouse brain was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by transfer onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by using a semi-dry blotter (Bio-Rad). After blocking, the blot was immunostained with the anti-PAT2 antibody diluted 1:500 or the pre-absorbed antibody with the corresponding antigenic peptide. After washing with TBS, the blots were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:1000; Dianova) and detected by 3-amino-9-ethyl-carbazole staining.Heterologous Expression of PAT2 in Xenopus laevis Oocytes—Oocytes were handled as described previously (12.Boll M.

Briefly, steady state current-voltage (I-V) relationships were measured in incubation buffer (100 mm choline chloride or sodium chloride, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm Tris at pH 7.5–9) in the absence or presence of glycine. Oocytes were clamped at –60 mV, and I-V relations were measured using short (100 ms) pulses separated by 200-ms pauses in the potential range of –160 to 80 mV. All values are expressed as mean ± S.E.Giant patch clamp experiments were performed as described previously (20.Kottra G. Daniel H. J. Physiol. 2001; 536: 495-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) with patch pipettes filled with 10 mm NaCl, 80 mm sodium isethionate, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm Ca(NO3)2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) and an incubation buffer comprised of 100 mm potassium aspartate, 20 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) containing nothing or 20 mm glycine on the patch cytosolic surface. During perfusion, the membrane potential was clamped to –30 mV, and I-V relations in the potential range of –80 to 60 mV were measured in the same way as described for TEVC. For immunolocalization in oocytes, cells injected with the PAT2-cRNA were initially checked for expression of the transporter by measuring positive inward currents induced by 20 mm glycine using the TEVC method. Oocytes were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and processed for embedment in paraffin wax. Deparaffinized sections (10 μm) were used for immunofluorescence analysis.Immunodetection Studies—Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence detection of PAT2 were performed on deparaffinized brain or spinal cord sections from adult mouse transcardially perfused for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in buffer 1 (100 mm sucrose, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and washed for 5 min with buffer 1. Tissues were processed for embedding in paraffin wax. Antigen retrieval was carried out by incubating the slices in citrate buffer (pH 6) in a microwave oven. For immunohistochemistry, 5-μm sections were blocked for 20 min with 3% goat serum in TBS and incubated overnight with the affinity-purified anti-PAT2 antibody diluted 1:100. On the following day, sections were rinsed with TBS and incubated for 30 min with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (1:800; Dako), rinsed with TBS, and incubated for 30 min with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (1:300; Dako). After washing with TBS, the sections were stained for 5–10 min with DAB peroxidase substrate (Sigma). Control incubations in parallel sections were carried out by pre-absorption of the primary antibody with the corresponding antigenic peptide. For immunofluorescence analysis, 10-μm sections were blocked for 20 min with 3% goat serum and incubated overnight with the affinity-purified anti-PAT2 antibody diluted 1:100 or the affinity-purified anti-LYAAT-1 (1:500; kindly provided by B. Giros, INSERM U513, Créteil, France). Colocalization analysis was performed with 10-μm sections incubated overnight with the affinity-purified anti-PAT2 antibody diluted 1:100 and mouse anti-BiP/GRP78, mouse anti-GM130, mouse anti-Rab4, mouse anti-EEA1 (all diluted 1:50; BD Transduction Laboratories), goat anti-NR1, goat anti-gephyrin, goat anti-GAD65/67 (all diluted 1:25; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or goat anti-GLYT2 (1:250; Chemicon). Slices were rinsed with TBS and incubated for 30 min with the following: (a) Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:800; Dianova) and Alexa Fluor 633 goat anti-mouse IgG (1:1000; Molecular Probes); or (b) Cy5-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:500; Dianova) and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (1:500; Molecular Probes). Slices were rinsed with TBS and viewed using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (model TCS SP2; Leica Microsystems). Colocalization analysis was performed with a Multicolor software package (Leica Microsystems). All images were generated with Adobe Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe Systems).RESULTSA BLAST analysis of the murine PAT2 cDNA sequence with the expressed sequence tag (EST) data base revealed the presence of PAT2-EST clones obtained from the nervous system. Because in our previous report we could not detect the PAT2-mRNA in brain by using Northern blot analysis (12.Boll M. Foltz M. Rubio-Aliaga I. Kottra G. Daniel H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22966-22973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), we here applied RT-PCR analysis and show that the PAT2 mRNA was detectable in all nervous system regions analyzed. As shown in Fig. 1A, a 546-bp fragment was amplified from olfactory bulb, cortex, thalamus, cerebellum, brain stem, and spinal cord. The presence of the PAT2 protein in the brain was confirmed by using an anti-PAT2 antibody raised against 13 amino acids of the C-terminal sequence of the PAT2 protein. Western blot analysis using this antibody revealed the PAT2 protein to be present in the brain with an apparent molecular mass of 55 kDa (Fig. 1B). The specificity of the antibody was demonstrated by immunofluorescence studies in X. laevis oocytes after expression of PAT2 (Fig. 1, C–H) with water-injected oocytes as a negative control. Only in membranes of oocytes expressing PAT2, a fluorescence signal was detected (Fig. 1C) that was blocked when the anti-PAT2 antibody was pre-absorbed with the antigenic peptide (Fig. 1G).Immunolocalization of PAT2 in the Nervous System—Immunodetection studies revealed that the PAT2 protein is expressed in spinal cord and brain. As shown in Fig. 2A, in spinal cord, PAT2 is highly expressed in the gray matter and is not detectable in the white matter. The signals were abolished in an adjacent section by incubation with the antibody pre-absorbed with the antigenic peptide (Fig. 2B). In the anterior horn, PAT2 is present in motoneurons and interneurons (Fig. 2C) and in interneurons of the posterior horn (data not shown). In brain, PAT2 is found in various regions, with prominent expression in brain stem, cerebellum, hippocampus, hypothalamus, rhinencephalon, cerebral cortex, and olfactory bulb (Fig. 2D). In an adjacent section, signals were abolished by incubation of slices with the antibody pre-absorbed with the antigenic peptide (Fig. 2E). Colocalization studies using the glia marker GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) showed that the PAT2 protein is solely detectable in neurons and not in astrocytes (data not shown). High power magnification demonstrates the expression of PAT2 in neurons of the mitral cell layer and interneurons in the olfactory bulb (Fig. 2F) as well as in neurons of the cerebral cortex (Fig. 2G) and large neurons in brainstem (Fig. 2H).Fig. 2Immunohistochemistry in cross-sections of the spinal cord (A–C) and parasagittal sections of the mouse brain with an anti-PAT2 antibody (D–I).

In all regions, pre-absorption of the anti-PAT2 antibody with the antigenic peptide abolished the immunoreactivity on an adjacent section, as shown in panel I for brain stem. Scale bars in B, C, E, and I apply to A and B, C, D–E, and F–I, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cell-specific Expression of the PAT2 Protein—PAT2 is expressed in “NMDAergic” neurons in different regions of the central nervous system (Fig. 3A). PAT2 immunoreactivity is found in cells expressing the NMDA receptor subunit NR1, such as motoneurons and interneurons in the spinal cord and brainstem, Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex, neurons in the dentate gyrus, the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus, and neurons in different layers of the cerebral cortex (Fig. 3A). Moreover, a subset of neurons in the molecular layers of the hippocampal formation and the molecular and granular layers of the cerebellum show both NR1 and PAT2 immunoreactivity (Fig. 3, A and B). NR1 and PAT2 showed very similar staining intensities along the neuronal cell bodies; e.g. pyramidal cells of the hippocampal CA3 region stained stronger than the granule cells of the CA1 region. At higher magnification, a partial subcellular colocalization of both proteins becomes evident (Fig. 3B). This subcellular colocalization is probably due to the expression of both proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, as shown for PAT2 (see Fig. 4B) and previously for the NR1 subunit (27.Petralia R.S. Yokotani N. Wenthold R.J. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 667-696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No clear correlation of expression pattern was observed between PAT2 and the glycinergic marker protein GLYT2 (glycine transporter 2), the glycine-and-GABAergic marker gephyrin, and the GABAergic marker glutamate decarboxylase GAD65/67 (Fig. 3B). Whereas PAT2 is expressed at higher levels in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, the glycine and GABAergic markers displayed higher expression levels in the molecular and/or granular layer. Such differential expression patterns in the colocalization of PAT2 with proteins of the glycine and GABAergic systems were also observed in other regions of the brain (data not shown), suggesting that PAT2 plays no role in the inhibitory glycine and GABAergic system. The missing correlation with the GABAergic system is not surprising, because GABA displays only a very low affinity to PAT2 (12.Boll M. Foltz M. Rubio-Aliaga I. Kottra G. Daniel H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22966-22973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar).Fig. 3Cell-specific expression of PAT2.

Foltz M. Rubio-Aliaga I. Kottra G. Daniel H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22966-22973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, in neurons of the brainstem, PAT2 is found mainly in the somata, predominantly in the cytoplasma and probably also partially in the plasma membrane. Its distribution, therefore, differs from the distribution pattern observed for PAT1. Colocalization studies using antibodies against different intracellular marker proteins in cross-sections of spinal cord were carried out for determining the subcellular compartments in which PAT2 is localized. Various regions of the nervous system have been examined, and in all cases the PAT2 protein did not colocalize with the Golgi marker protein GM130 or the early endosome marker protein EAA1 (Fig. 4B). On the other hand, it partly colocalized with the endoplasmic reticulum marker protein BiP/GRP78 and the early and recycling endosome marker protein Rab4. Quantification of PAT2 immunoreactive puncta indicated ∼34 ± 3% (n = 12) and ∼31 ± 3% (n = 15) colocalized with the endoplasmic reticulum marker protein and the recycling endosome marker protein, respectively. Therefore, PAT2 is found in endoplasmic reticulum and recycling endosomes, whereas the remaining fraction is localized in other compartments, including the cell membrane.Functional Analysis of PAT2—Whereas in our previous report we demonstrated that PAT1 and PAT2 activities are generally dependent on extracellular pH and membrane potential (12.Boll M. Foltz M. Rubio-Aliaga I. Kottra G. Daniel H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22966-22973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), here we analyzed in more detail the kinetics of glycine transport (Fig. 5). Applying the TEVC technique in oocytes expressing PAT2, the glycine/H+ symport at saturating (10 mm) external glycine concentrations induced positive inward currents that increased by decreasing external pH from 9 to 7.5 (Fig. 5A). A further reduction of pH from 7.5 to 5.5 did not further enhance glycine currents (data not shown), and no current responses were observed in the water-injected oocytes. As shown in Fig. 5B, PAT2-mediated inward currents followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics when plotted as a function of apparent external proton concentration. The corresponding Eadie-Hofstee transformation (Fig. 5C) revealed an apparent half-maximal proton activation constant of 4.7 ± 0.2 nm and an Imax of 462 ± 12 nA. From this data it can be concluded that the external pH necessary for a hal"

More surprisingly, at sufficiently low supercoolings, foreign nano-particles exert no effect on the nucleation barrier of ice; it is as if they physically “vanished.” This effect, called hereafter the “zero-sized” effect of foreign particles (or nucleators), leads to the entry of a so-called inverse homogeneous-like nucleation domain, in which nucleation is effectively suppressed. The freezing temperature of water corresponds to the transition temperature from the inverse homogeneous-like nucleation regime to foreign particle-mediated heterogeneous nucleation. The freezing temperature of water is mainly determined by (i) the surface roughness of nucleators at large supercoolings, (ii) the interaction and structural match between nucleating ice and the substrate, and (iii) the size of the effective surface of nucleators at low supercoolings. Our experiments showed that the temperature of -40 °C, commonly regarded as the temperature of homogeneous nucleation-mediated freezing, is actually the transition temperature from the inverse homogeneous-like nucleation regime to foreign particle-mediated heterogeneous nucleation in ultra-clean water. Taking advantage of inverse homogeneous-like nucleation, the interfacial tensions between water and ice in very pure water and antifreeze aqueous solutions were measured at a very high precision for the first time. The principles of freezing promotion and antifreeze and the selection for the biological ice nucleation and antifreeze proteins are obtained.

The results provide completely new insights into freezing and antifreeze phenomena and bear generic implications for all crystallization systems. The question of how freezing occurs in micro-sized ultra-clean water droplets is of crucial relevance in agriculture and food and life sciences in phenomena like frost bite (cell damage due to ice freezing) (1Mutaftschiev B. Hurle D.T.J Handbook of Crystal Growth. North-Holland, Amsterdam, The Netherlands1993Google Scholar, 2Davies P.L. Sykes B.D. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Sci. 2002; 27: 101-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In most cases, freezing is mediated by minute foreign particles, including bacterial epiphytes. The understanding of ice nucleation under the influence of minute foreign particles is particularly important for the identification of novel technologies in controlling freezing and antifreeze in general. The eminent antifreeze effect results from antifreeze proteins found in the blood and tissues of organisms that live in freezing environments (2Davies P.L. Sykes B.D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 828-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In these organisms, the effect of freezing proteins is retarded, or the damage incurred upon freezing and thawing is reduced (2Davies P.L. Sykes B.D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 828-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 3Davies P.L. Hew C.L. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2460-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 4Knight C.A.

Applications of the antifreeze effect of these antifreeze proteins (AFPs), 1The abbreviations used are: AFPantifreeze proteinDIdeionizedINPice nucleation proteins. the capacity to inhibit ice crystallization, have been sought for maintaining texture in frozen foods, improving storage of blood, tissues and organs, cryosurgery, and protecting crops from freezing (4Knight C.A. Nature. 2000; 406: 249-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Freezing is a process of ice crystallization from supercooled water. In this process, water should undergo the stage of ice nucleation, followed by the growth of ice (1Mutaftschiev B. Hurle D.T.J Handbook of Crystal Growth. North-Holland, Amsterdam, The Netherlands1993Google Scholar). Actually, whether or not freezing takes place is determined to a large extent by ice nucleation. In other words, there would be no ice growth if ice nucleation did not occur. antifreeze protein deionized ice nucleation proteins. Despite their importance, the microphysical mechanisms responsible for the formation of ice nuclei under the influence of minute foreign particles are not very well understood. Because of the fact that ice nucleation is the initial and one of the most important steps in the freezing process, the question of whether ice crystallization is governed by homogeneous or heterogeneous nucleation bears significant implications for antifreeze, ice nucleation promotion, and freezing-related phenomena and activities. Spontaneous nucleation of ice from water, in particular below -40 °C, has in most cases been regarded as “homogeneous nucleation” (2Davies P.L. Sykes B.D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 828-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 3Davies P.L. Hew C.L. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2460-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 4Knight C.A.

This means that water is considered to be clean and “dust free.” It is supposed that, even though there are some minute foreign particles that occur in water, they don't exert any direct impact on nucleation. The key questions to be addressed are whether the effect of nano-particles can be neglected completely even at T < -40 °C, and if not, how they affect the nucleation and freezing of water. On the other hand, if heterogeneous nucleation inevitably takes place, it is believed (8Mullin J.W. Crystallization. Butterworth-Heinemann, Oxford1997: 182-194Google Scholar, 9Söhnel O. Garside J. Precipitation, Basic Principles and Industrial Application. Butterworth-Heinemann, Oxford1992: 41-76Google Scholar, 10Garside J. Nancollas G.H. Biological Mineralization and Demineralization. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2000: 23-35Google Scholar) to be dominant at low supercoolings (or low supersaturations), whereas homogeneous nucleation is believed to occur at very high supercoolings (or very high supersaturations). In this paper, we examine the effect of a trace amount of foreign nano-particles on ice nucleation in ultra-pure micro-sized water droplets and its implications for freezing and antifreeze in general. We also examine how antifreeze proteins change the surface characteristics of foreign bodies. Based on this, we should be able to obtain a new and comprehensive understanding of freezing promotion and antifreeze mechanisms. The experiments on ice nucleation were carried out by employing the so-called double oil-layer micro-sized microscopic crystallization technique (11Du N. Liu W.Y. Appl. Phys. Lett. 2002; 81: 445-447Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This technology allows the influence of the container on ice nucleation to be minimized, and the examination of ice nucleation kinetics under well controlled conditions. A micro-sized deionized (DI) water (18.2 mΩ) droplet (∼0.1 μl) was suspended between two layers of immiscible oil in a circular quartz cell (compare with the schematic illustration in Fig. 2) (11Du N. Liu W.Y. Appl. Phys. Lett. 2002; 81: 445-447Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To minimize the effect of foreign particles, the water and oils were filtered twice to remove foreign particles before they were injected into the cell. In our experiments, antifreeze protein III (AFPIII) was employed to control freezing. AFPIII is a protein with a compact, globular structure in which the overall fold comprises numerous short β-strands and one turn of α-helix (12Jia Z. Deluca C.I. Chao H. Davies P.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In our experiments, the lower layer of oil (oil 1, Silicon Oil AR 1000 from Fluka), which has a greater density than water, was injected into the quartz cell up to one-half of its volume. Next, a drop of pure water or a drop of an AFPIII solution was carefully injected onto the surface of the oil by using a micro syringe. Then, an oil (oil 2, 200/500 cS fluid from Dow Corning) with a density lower than that of water was injected to fill the cell, covering the water droplet and the oil layer beneath. A glass coverslip was then placed on the top of the cell to prevent evaporation. Because of the density differences, the water droplet was suspended between the two layers of immiscible oils. The ice crystallization was controlled by a Linkam THMS 600 heating and freezing stage, which is capable of controlling the temperature to 0.1 °C within a range from -192 to +600 °C where the cell was mounted. Nucleation was observed with a polarized transmitted microscope (Olympus, BX60-F) to which a three-charge-coupled device color video camera (Panasonic, KY-F55BE) with an S-VHS video recorder (Panasonic AG-MD830) was attached (11Du N. Liu W.Y. Appl. Phys. Lett. 2002; 81: 445-447Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Any ice crystal forming in the drop could immediately be detected by the polarized microscope. Each data set was repeated 3 or 4 times to check the reproducibility of the experiment. The Role of Minute Foreign Particles in Freezing—For the ultra-pure DI water, the freezing temperature (for a constant droplet volume) decreased progressively from 239.3 K to 235.2 K to 234.1 K as the pore size of the filters was reduced from 200 nm to 100 nm to 20 nm. This implies that, under normal conditions, it is almost impossible to completely remove foreign particles by filtration. The process of “homogeneous ice crystallization,” commonly referred to by authors (13Koop T. Luo B. Tsias A. Peter T. Nature. 2000; 406: 611-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar, 14Rasmussen D.H. J. Cryst. Growth. 1982; 56: 56-66Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 15Kanno H. Angell C.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1977; 81: 2639-2643Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar), is actually a foreign particle-mediated heterogeneous ice nucleation process promoted by a trace amount of foreign nano-particles. “Zero-sized” Effect of Foreign Particles—The nucleation process can be regarded as a kinetic process for ice nuclei to overcome the so-called nucleation barrier ΔG* under a given supercooling ΔT (ΔT = Tm - T, where T and Tm are the actual and the melting temperatures, respectively) (16Liu X.Y.

To explore the ice nucleation kinetics, we examined the correlation between the nucleation induction time τ, the time required for the first nucleus to appear in the drop of water with a given volume V, and the supercooling ΔT (ΔT = Tm - Tf, where Tm is melting temperature and Tf is freezing temperature) (16Liu X.Y.

For an optimal interaction and structural match between the nucleating phase and the substrate, m → 1 and f(m, R′) → 0 (compare with Fig. 2), meaning that the nucleation barrier is completely eliminated because of the occurrence of foreign particles. When f(m, R′) = 1 (extremely poor structure match/interaction between ice and foreign particles), the nucleation barrier is the highest (ΔG*homo) under the given conditions even when the foreign particles are still present, in which case the foreign particles do not play any role in lowering the nucleation barrier.Fig. 3A, dependence of the interfacial correlation function f(m, R′) on m and R′.

Let us first focus on DI water filtrated by a 20-nm filter (curve A). If freezing were first controlled by heterogeneous nucleation and followed by homogeneous nucleation as ΔT increased, we would have obtained for a nucleating system pair-wise intersecting straight-line segments in the ln(τV) versus 1/T(ΔT)2 plot: one segment with a small slope at low ΔT (or high 1/T(ΔT)2, the other segment with the highest slope at high ΔT (compare Equation 1: the slope is then κf(m, R′) = κ, as f(m,R')|max=1) (8Mullin J.W.

Lett. 2001; 79: 39-41Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In contrast to this expectation, we obtain at low ΔT (high 1/T(ΔT)2) a straight line segment with the largest slope within the measurable range of ΔT, whereas at high ΔT (low 1/T(ΔT)2), we obtain a straight line segment with a much smaller slope, the two straight line segments being joined by a curve (see Fig. 2). This implies that the nucleation barrier rises abruptly to the highest level (ΔG* ≈ ΔG*homo, f(m, R′) = 1) at low supercoolings, as if the foreign particles had “disappeared” (compare Equations 1, 2, and 8). Notice that the other three curves (B-D) share similar characteristics. Hereafter, we will call such an effect on nucleation revealed by foreign particles at low supercoolings the “zero-sized” effect. Inverse Homogeneous-like Nucleation and the Effective Curvature of the Surface Roughness of Foreign Body—To explain the above surprising results, we will analyze the influence of R′ on f(m, R′) and, consequently, on ice nucleation kinetics. R′ is actually the ratio between the radius of the local curvature of the foreign particles (substrate) and that of the critical nuclei rc (compare Equation 5 and Fig. 1). For a given crystallization system, R′ is proportional to ΔT (compare Equations 3 and 5). As shown in Fig. 3A, the f(m, R′) ∼ R′ diagram can be divided into three regimes based on R′ or ΔT. Regime I (linear regime): R′ » 1 (relatively large supercoolings and/or large Rs). In comparison to the critical nuclei, the foreign particles can be treated as a flat substrate. f(m, R′) then attains its lowest value and becomes a constant with respect to R′ (or ΔT), i.e. it assumes the form f(m). According to Equation 1, the plot of ln(τV) versus 1/T(ΔT)2 is a straight line because κ is constant for a given system (compare portion 1 of curve A in Fig. 1). Regime II (nonlinear regime): as ΔT deceases (or 1/T(ΔT)2 increases), rc becomes comparable with Rs (R′ ∼ 1) (compare Equation 3). The ln(τV) ∼ 1/T(ΔT)2 plot becomes a curve (compare the curved segment between portions 1 and 2 of curve A) as f(m, R′) varies with ΔT (or R′). Regime III (zero-sized regime): further lowering ΔT (or raising 1/T(ΔT)2) leads to a much larger rc than the radius Rs of the foreign particles or R′ → 0. In the case f(m, R′)max = 1, one has a straight line with the largest slope (line 2 of curve A in Fig. 1). In this regime, as suggested by the zero-sized effect, the particles behave then as if they had “vanished,” although they are still physically present in water. According to Equation 8, the occurrence of the particles does not lower the nucleation barrier with respect to that of genuine homogeneous nucleation. Notice that the nucleation in Regime III is still not genuine homogeneous nucleation. In the case of genuine homogeneous nucleation, one has f″(m, R′) = f(m, R′) = 1 and ln{f″(m, R′)[f(m, R′)]1/2BNo} = constant for the same system, meaning that only one ln(τV) versus 1/T(ΔT)2 plot can be identified in this case for the same system, such as DI water filtrated by a 20-nm filter (Fig. 1, curve A) and DI water filtrated by a 200-nm filter (Fig. 1, curve D). Nevertheless, in comparison to segment 2 in curve A and segment 2′ in curve D, one has two parallel straight lines instead of a single straight line. This means that the nucleation occurring at the “zero-sized” regime (Regime III) is still not genuine homogeneous nucleation, although the height of the nucleation barrier is equivalent to that of homogeneous nucleation. This result is attributed to the fact that the probability of nucleation around the foreign particles may still be higher than elsewhere within the water droplet because of the particle-induced molecular pre-ordering (19Liu X.Y. Appl. Phys. Lett. 2001; 79: 39-41Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Based on the fact that this homogeneous-like nucleation occurs at low supercoolings rather than at high supercoolings as expected previously (7Hare D.E. Sorensen C.M. J. Chem. Phys. 1987; 87: 4840-4845Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 8Mullin J.W. Crystallization. Butterworth-Heinemann, Oxford1997: 182-194Google Scholar, 9Söhnel O. Garside J. Precipitation, Basic Principles and Industrial Application. Butterworth-Heinemann, Oxford1992: 41-76Google Scholar, 10Garside J. Nancollas G.H. Biological Mineralization and Demineralization. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2000: 23-35Google Scholar), this type of nucleation is then referred to as inverse homogeneous-like nucleation. We convert the curves in Fig. 2 into f(m, R′) ∼ R′ (see the caption of Fig. 3B). According to Equation 1, the slope of the ln(τV) ∼ 1/T(ΔT)2 plot is κf(m, R′). If the inverse homogeneous-like nucleation takes place (Regime III, f(m, R′) = 1), one then has κf(m, R′) = κ. It follows that the experimental f(m, R′) ∼ ΔT curve can be obtained from the ratio between the slope of the ln(τV) ∼ 1/T(ΔT)2 plot and the corresponding κ at different ΔT. Because rc can be obtained from Equation 3 and κ, one of the most challenging and important steps in obtaining f(m, R′) ∼ R′ is to estimate the average local radius Rs of the rough surface of the foreign particles (compare Equation 5 and Fig. 2). As illustrated by Fig. 3A (e.g. m = 0.8), one has approximately R′ ≈ 1 or (rc)mid ≈ Rs at the midpoint of the ln[f(m, R′)] ∼ ln(R′) curve (-ln[f(m)]/2), enabling one to estimate, according to Equation 5, Rs from (rc)mid, which can be obtained from (ΔT)mid (compare Equation 3; (ΔT)mid is the supercooling of the midpoint (-ln[f(m)]/2) of the ln[f(m, R′)] ∼ ln(ΔT) plot). The values of Rs for various systems are listed in Table I. The ln[f(m, R′)] ∼ ln(R′) plots for these systems are given in Fig. 3B.Table IThe measured transition temperature (ΔT)mid and the radius of the local curvature of foreign particles for different systemsκ(ΔT)mid(rc)mid (= RS)KnmDI water (20-nm filter)1.2 × 10839.12.16DI water (200-nm filter)1.1 × 10833.92.43AFPIII 2.5 mg/ml (20-nm filter)0.32 × 10840.31.35 Open table in a new tab To check the above approach, we will compare the estimated Rs (= (rc)mid) with known Rs values for some specific foreign particles. Note that any intentionally added foreign particles could not serve for this purpose for the following reasons: (i) because the shape of the foreign particles is irregular, Rs cannot be equated with the size of these particles (compare Fig. 1); and (ii) the pre-existing foreign particles should be inactivated to eliminate their interference in the course of the investigation and subsequent analysis. The AFPIII (from A/F Protein Canada, Inc.) was selected as a specific foreign particle. Each AFPIII molecule has both a dominant hydrophilic and a dominant hydrophobic portion (compare Fig. 4A; Ref. 20Turnbull J. J. Appl. Phys. 1950; 21: 1022-1028Crossref Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). Our latest experiments 2X.-Y. Liu and N. Du, unpublished data. show that AFPIII molecules adsorb onto and cover the surface of foreign particles by orienting their dominant hydrophobic portions outwards (compare Fig. 4B), thus interrupting the interaction between the nucleating phase (ice) and the foreign particles. This can be seen from the rise in f(m) (from curve 1 → curve 2 in Fig. 3B) after adding 0.5 mg/ml AFPIII to the DI water filtrated by a 20-nm filter. As the concentration of AFPIII begins to exceed CAFPIII = 2.5 mg/ml, the molecules start to aggregate into some hydrophilic-like clusters (Fig. 4C) with an average diameter (2Rs) ≈ 2.8 nm (see our light scattering results in Fig. 5, A and B). In their role as new foreign particles, these hydrophilic clusters lower the nucleation barrier (Fig. 3B, compare 2 with 3). In Table I, for CAFPIII = 2.5 mg/ml, the radius Rs of the foreign particles (AFPIII clusters) is estimated to be 1.42 nm, based on the ln[f(m, R′)] ∼ ln(R′) plot, which is in excellent agreement with the results given in Fig. 4B.Fig. 5The size and the size distribution of AFPIII molecules and aggregates in DI water solutions filtrated by 20-nm filters. At the AFPIII concentration of CAFPIII = 0.5 mg/ml, only mono-protein molecules (∼1.1 nm) exist in the solution. At the AFPIII concentration of CAFPIII ≥ 2.5 mg/ml, apart from a small quantity of the mono-molecules, AFPIII molecules will aggregate to form clusters with the average diameter = 2.8 nm. The results were obtained by the dynamic light-scattering method, based on a Brookhaven BI-200SM light-scattering system with an He-Ne laser (632.8 nm) source and a photomultiplier tube detector.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The “Infinite” Nucleation Energy Barrier of the Inverse Homogeneous-like Nucleation and the Freezing Point of Water—The roughness (or Rs) of the pre-existing foreign nano-particles and their surface structural match with ice nuclei exert a profound impact on the freezing and antifreeze process, which has never been taken into account before. If the inverse homogeneous-like nucleation becomes a dominant process (Regime III), the nucleation barrier will rise drastically (compare Figs. 2 and 3B). For DI water (filtrated by a 20-nm filter), the nucleation barrier (ΔG*/kT) rises from 222 to 11,123 at ΔT = 40 K (compare with Fig. 4). Such a high nucleation barrier is almost equivalent to an “infinite” height of nucleation barrier. Because the nucleation barrier affects the nucleation rate exponentially (compare Equation 1), such a high ΔG*/kT makes the nucleation of ice in Regime III practically an impossible event at low supercoolings. Therefore, the initiation of freezing can only be possible when entering the particle-mediated nucleation re"
https://openalex.org/W2043249532,"Rho family GTPases play important roles in a variety of cellular processes, including actin cytoskeleton reorganization, transcription activation, and DNA synthesis. Dominant negative mutants of Rho GTPases, such as T17NRac1, that block the endogenous Rho protein activation by sequestering upstream guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) have been widely used to implicate specific members of the Rho family in various signaling pathways. We show here that such an approach could produce potentially misleading results since many Rho GEFs can interact with multiple Rho proteins promiscuously, and overexpression of one dominant negative Rho protein mutant may affect the activity of other members of the Rho family. Based on the available structural information, we have identified the highly conserved amino acid pairing of Asn1406Trio-Asp65Rac1 of the GEF-Rho GTPase interaction as the critical catalytic machinery required for the Rac1 GDP/GTP exchange reaction. The N1406A/D1407A mutant of Trio acted dominant negatively in vitro by retaining Rac1 binding activity but losing GEF catalytic activity and competitively inhibited Rac1 activation by wild type Trio. It readily blocked the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced lamellipodia formation and inhibited the wild type Trio-induced serum response factor activation. Moreover the mutant was able to selectively inhibit Dbl-induced Rac1 activation without affecting RhoA activity in cells. In contrast to the non-discriminative inhibitory effect displayed by T17NRac1, the Trio mutant was ineffective in inhibiting PDGF-stimulated DNA synthesis and Dbl-induced transformation, revealing the Rac-independent functions of PDGF and Dbl. These studies identify a conserved pair of amino acid residues of the Trio-Rac interaction that is likely to be essential to the GEF catalysis of Rho family GTPases and demonstrate that a dominant negative mutant derived from a Rho GTPase regulator constitutes a new generation of specific inhibitors of Rho GTPase signaling pathways.

The Rho family proteins consist of about 20 mammalian members including RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 (1Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Google Scholar). These Ras-related GTPases act as intracellular molecular switches that transduce diverse signals by cycling between the active GTP-bound and the inactive GDP-bound states, leading to cellular responses such as actin cytoskeleton reorganization, transcription activation, and DNA synthesis (1Van Aelst L.

They become inactivated when the bound GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP through their intrinsic GTPase activity that is further accelerated by a class of negative regulators, the Rho GTPase-activating proteins (7Moon S.Y. Zheng Y. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 13-22Google Scholar). In the GTP-bound state, Rho proteins are able to recognize specific effector targets and induce downstream molecular events (8Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Google Scholar). It has been increasingly appreciated that the spatial and temporal control of the GTP binding/GTP hydrolysis cycle of Rho GTPases is essential for their proper function in cells (9Symons M. Settleman J. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 415-419Google Scholar). guanine nucleotide exchange factor glutathione S-transferase Dbl homology Pleckstrin homology platelet-derived growth factor N-methylanthraniloyl GDP green fluorescent protein Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium serum response factor conserved region internal ribosome entry site tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. The Dbl family GEFs are large multidomain proteins that serve as signal-convergent or -divergent points of Rho GTPase-mediated signaling (4Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Google Scholar, 5Zheng Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 724-732Google Scholar, 6Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Google Scholar). It is estimated that over 80 Dbl-like molecules may exist in the human genome. The conserved Dbl homology (DH) domain in tandem with a Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of this family of Rho GTPase regulators constitutes the minimum structural module capable of activating Rho proteins in cells. The DH domain is responsible for the catalytic GDP/GTP exchange activity, while the PH domain has a supporting role for DH targeting and may affect the DH-Rho protein interaction directly or indirectly (5Zheng Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 724-732Google Scholar). Some of the GEFs display specific activity toward one Rho GTPase (e.g. FGD1 for Cdc42, Tiam1 for Rac1, and p115RhoGEF for RhoA), while others can activate multiple Rho GTPases promiscuously (e.g. Dbl and Ect2 can activate RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, and Dbs activates both RhoA and Cdc42) (4Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Google Scholar, 5Zheng Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 724-732Google Scholar, 6Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Google Scholar). It is likely that under physiological conditions each GEF is involved in a specific aspect of the Rho GTPase-regulated signaling process. But despite extensive effort by cell biological, genetic, biochemical, and structural approaches (5Zheng Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 724-732Google Scholar, 6Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Google Scholar), detailed mechanisms of the GEF reaction, regulation, and involvement of most GEFs in specific Rho signaling pathways remain unclear. Dominant negative mutants of Rho GTPases are widely in use to elucidate the role of individual Rho proteins in different signaling pathways. For example, microinjection of the dominant negative T17NRac1 (where Thr17 is replaced by Asn) into the cytoplasm of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts inhibited membrane ruffling elicited by PDGF (10Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Google Scholar), whereas dominant negative RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 could all inhibit serum response factor activation and G1/S phase transition of the cell cycle (11Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Google Scholar) and Ras-induced cell transformation (12Qiu R.G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M. Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Google Scholar, 13Qiu R.G. Chen J. McCormick F. Symons M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11781-11785Google Scholar, 14Qiu R. Abo A. McCormick F. Symons M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3449-3458Google Scholar). The proposed mechanism of the dominant negative mutant function is that it binds to its respective GEFs with high affinity and may sequester the endogenous Rho GEFs by forming a non-functional dominant negative Rho-GEF complex (15Feig L.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E25-E27Google Scholar, 16Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Google Scholar). It is often assumed by users of these mutants that a given mutant blocks only the specific pathway(s) that is activated by its wild type counterpart. Given the recent realization that many Dbl family GEFs, particularly the core DH-PH module that is responsible for Rho GTPase recognition and catalysis, are promiscuous in nature (5Zheng Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 724-732Google Scholar, 6Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Google Scholar), it could be expected that overexpression of one dominant negative Rho GTPase (typically 2-3-fold over the endogenous protein to be effective, Ref. 15Feig L.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E25-E27Google Scholar) might indiscriminately inhibit other Rho GTPase activities by sequestering multiple GEFs or one GEF that is capable of activating multiple Rho protein substrates, leading to incorrect conclusions. In the present studies we further examined the specificity issue of dominant negative Rho proteins. We show that dominant negative Rac1 could indeed cause nonspecific inhibition of RhoA activity in an onco-Dbl-transfected cell system. In the course of examining the catalytic mechanism of the Dbl family GEF function and investigating whether certain substrate-specific Dbl family GEFs can be engineered as dominant negative mutants for the dissection of Rho GTPase-mediated signaling pathways, we constructed a DH domain mutant of the GEF for Rac, Trio N-terminal DH-PH domains (TrioN), based on the available information of the three-dimensional structures of Dbl family GEFs. We report here the identification of a conserved pair of amino acid residues, Asn1406Trio-Asp65Rac1, of the TrioN-Rac1 complex that are essential for the GEF catalytic mechanism of Rac1 and present evidence that a TrioN mutant, N1406A/D1407A, behaves as a dominant negative to specifically block Rac1 activation in vitro and in vivo. Our results indicate that dominant negative mutants derived from a Rho GTPase regulator may constitute a new generation of specific inhibitors of Rho GTPase signaling pathways. cDNA Constructs—The DH domain point mutants of TrioN (T1244A, N1406A, and N1406A/D1407A; residues 1225-1537 of Trio) were generated by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of human Trio cDNA in pET15b vector by the polymerase chain reaction-based second extension amplification technique using the Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) with primers that contained the desired mutations (17Zhu K. Debreceni B. Li R. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25993-26001Google Scholar). The sequences of mutagenized cDNA inserts were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. The BamHI-EcoRI fragments encoding the DH-PH module of wild type or mutant TrioN were subsequently subcloned into the corresponding sites of pMX-IRES-GFP retroviral vector for recombinant retroviral production or pCEFL-GST vector for transient transfection (17Zhu K.

Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4671-4681Google Scholar, 20Zhang B. Zhang Y. Wang Z. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25299-25307Google Scholar). The concentration and integrity of purified proteins were estimated by the Bradford assay and Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE. In Vitro GDP/GTP Exchange Assay—The time courses for GDP/GTP exchange of Rac1 or D65ARac1 in the presence or absence of TrioN or TrioN mutants were determined by using the [3H]GDP binding nitrocellulose filtration method or by monitoring the fluorescence changes caused by nucleotide analog mantGDP dissociation from Rac1 (19Li R. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4671-4681Google Scholar, 20Zhang B. Zhang Y. Wang Z. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25299-25307Google Scholar). The GEF reaction buffer contained [3H]GDP- or mantGDP-loaded Rac1 protein with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm GTP, and 1 mm dithiothreitol supplemented with TrioN or TrioN mutants. Complex Formation Assay—Complex formation between His6-TrioN or TrioN mutants and GST-fused dominant negative Cdc42 (T17NCdc42) or Rac1 (T17NRac1) were carried out similarly to that described previously (16Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Google Scholar). Approximately 5 μg of each GST-fused small G-protein were immobilized on agarose-glutathione beads, washed three times in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 100 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA, and then mixed with 2 μg of purified TrioN proteins in the presence of bovine serum albumin (∼50 μg of total protein) for 1 h. The washed precipitates from the mixtures were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blot analysis using anti-His6 antibody (Roche Applied Science). The immune complexes were visualized by using chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Retroviral Expression of TrioN and Dominant Rac1 and Cdc42 Mutants in Cells—Wild type, N1406A/D1407A, and T1244A of TrioN, T17NRac1, and T17NCdc42 were expressed in NIH 3T3 or Swiss 3T3 cells by using the pMX-IRES-GFP vector, which expresses the green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a bicistronic mRNA (17Zhu K. Debreceni B. Li R. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25993-26001Google Scholar, 21Liu X. Constantinescu S.N. Sun Y. Bogan J.S. Hirsch D. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 20-28Google Scholar). Retroviral packaging and infection were carried out according to the described methods (22Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Google Scholar). Briefly, ecotropic Phoenix cells were transfected with individual retroviral vector, and the retroviruses were harvested 48 h post-transfection. The fibroblasts were infected with the retroviruses, and cells were harvested 72 h postinfection. GFP-positive cells were used for further analysis. In Vivo Rac1 and RhoA GTPase Activation Assay—The onco-Dbl-expressing cells were generated previously (17Zhu K. Debreceni B. Li R. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25993-26001Google Scholar, 18Vanni C. Mancini P. Gao Y. Ottaviano C. Guo F. Salani B. Torrisi M.R. Zheng Y. Eva A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19745-19753Google Scholar). The glutathione-agarose-immobilized GST-PAK1, which contains the p21-binding domain of human PAK1 (residues 51-149), and the GST-Rhotekin, which contains the site required for RhoA-GTP recognition of Rhotekin (residues 7-89), were expressed and purified in E. coli by using the pGEX-KG vector described previously (23Li R. Debreceni B. Jia B. Gao Y. Tigyi G. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29648-29654Google Scholar, 24Ren X. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells were grown to ∼90% confluence in DMEM containing 10% calf serum before being washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline once and lysis on the dish in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. Lysates containing equal amounts of total proteins were incubated with GST, GST-PAK1, or GST-Rhotekin (10 μg/sample) for 40 min at 4 °C under constant agitation. The lysate-incubated beads were then washed three times with the lysis buffer, and the bound Rac1 or RhoA was detected by anti-Rac1 or -RhoA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Fluorescence Microscopy—Log phase growing fibroblasts were seeded at a density of 1 × 104 cells/12-mm round coverslips (Fisher Scientific) overnight before fixation in phosphate-buffered saline containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were permeabilized in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min and stained for F-actin using rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes). Coverslips were mounted onto slides in 50% glycerol, Tris-buffered saline. Stained cells were analyzed by using a Leica confocal fluorescence microscope (17Zhu K. Debreceni B. Li R. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25993-26001Google Scholar). Transient Luciferase Reporter Assay—For determination of serum response factor-dependent gene expression, the SRF-luciferase reporter plasmid (Stratagene) that contains the promoter response elements of SRF was used in transient co-transfections with the pCEFL vector or pCEFL-N1406A/D1407A in the presence or absence of the wild type TrioN cDNA (in pKH3 vector, Ref. 17Zhu K. Debreceni B. Li R. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25993-26001Google Scholar). Transfection into NIH 3T3 cells was performed using LipofectAMINE reagents (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Analysis of luciferase expression in the co-transfected NIH 3T3 cells was carried out by using a luciferase assay kit from Promega. Transfection efficiencies were routinely corrected by obtaining the ratio of the luciferase and the β-galactosidase activities observed in the same sample. To assure that co-expression of wild type TrioN (hemagglutinin-tagged) was not affected by N1406A/D1407A, transfectants were analyzed by anti-hemagglutinin Western blotting in parallel. DNA Synthesis Assay—DNA synthesis was monitored by measuring incorporation of the artificial thymidine nucleotide analog 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) (Sigma) into newly synthesized DNA. The cells were cultured and synchronized as described previously (11Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Google Scholar). Release from S phase synchrony was achieved by washing the cells once with phosphate-buffered saline followed by two washes with DMEM for 5 min. BrdUrd (10 μm) was added to the medium upon release with 10% serum or PDGF (10 nm), and labeling was carried out for 16 h before the cells were fixed and stained with anti-BrdUrd antibody (BD Biosciences). Soft Agar Growth Assay—NIH 3T3 cells expressing GFP, onco-Dbl together with GFP, onco-Dbl with GFP and TrioN mutant N1406A/D1407A, T17NRac1, or T17NCdc42 were assayed for their capability to grow in soft agar as described previously (17Zhu K. Debreceni B. Li R. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25993-26001Google Scholar, 25Lin R. Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A. Manor D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 794-797Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 104 cells were suspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum and 0.3% agarose and plated on top of a solidified DMEM with 10% calf serum and 0.5% agarose. Cells were fed weekly by the addition of 1 ml of DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum and 0.3% agarose. Two and a half weeks postplating, colonies larger than 50 μm were scored under a microscope. Administration of Dominant Negative Rac1 Could Nonspecifically Affect RhoA Activity in Cells—The dominant negative mutants of Rac1 and Cdc42, T17NRac1 and T17NCdc42, are widely used to inhibit Rac- or Cdc42-regulated signaling pathways. They were derived based on the corresponding mutant of Ras, which is capable of sequestering Ras-specific GEFs and blocks endogenous Ras activity (15Feig L.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E25-E27Google Scholar). These mutants were shown to bind to the Dbl-like GEFs with high affinity in vitro (16Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Google Scholar) and to inhibit Rac-mediated lamellipodia formation and membrane ruffling or Cdc42-mediated filopodia induction in vivo (10Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Google Scholar, 26Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Google Scholar, 27Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1942-1952Google Scholar) Given the apparent existence of a large number of Dbl family GEFs in mammalian cells and the realization that many of them can bind to and activate multiple Rho proteins (5Zheng Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 724-732Google Scholar), we were concerned that non-discriminative application of these dominant negative Rho mutants in cells where abundant GEFs are expressed may produce misleading results. To address the possibility that expression of one type of dominant negative Rho protein may unbalance the activity of distinct Rho family members by sequestering a commonly shared GEF, we transduced T17NRac1 or T17NCdc42 into the NIH 3T3 cells expressing oncogenic Dbl protein and examined the effect on cell actin structure and endogenous Rac1 and RhoA activities. As shown in Fig. 1A, the cells expressing Dbl showed a more compact cell shape. Filament actin staining revealed extensive lamellipodia along the cell edges and the retaining stress fibers in the cells in accordance with the previous findings that Dbl can bind to and activate multiple Rho proteins including Rac1 and RhoA (16Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Google Scholar, 28Olson M.F. Pasteris N.G. Gorski J.L. Hall A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1628-1633Google Scholar). Effector domain pull-down assays showed that the levels of the GTP-bound Rac1 and RhoA were significantly enhanced in the Dbl-expressing cells compared with the parental cells (Fig. 1B). When T17NRac1 or T17NCdc42 was co-expressed in the Dbl-expressing cells, it appears that either protein could inhibit the lamellipodia and actin stress fiber formation (Fig. 1A). Moreover they effectively suppressed both endogenous Rac1 and RhoA activities that were up-regulated by onco-Dbl (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that the conventional dominant negative mutants of Rho GTPases may function nonspecifically to inhibit distinct Rho GTPase activities by sequestering Dbl-like GEFs that are promiscuous in substrate recognition. Identification of the Conserved Asn1406-Asp65 Pairing of TrioN-Rac1 as the Critical Determinant for GEF Catalysis—The Dbl-like GEFs outnumber Rho substrates by at least a 4 to 1 ratio (5Zheng Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 724-732Google Scholar, 6Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Google Scholar), and there is evidence that certain GEFs may play an important role in specifying Rho protein-mediated pathways (29Daniels R.H. Zenke F.T. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6047-6050Google Scholar). We rationalized that if the substrate-specific GEF mutants that preserve specific Rho GTPase binding but are catalytically compromised could be engineered, they might act dominant negatively in inhibiting individual Rho GTPase substrate and could be explored to specifically down-regulate Rho GTPase-mediated signaling. Previously we have characterized a large panel of point mutants of oncogenic Dbl made in the DH domain and mapped conserved region 1 (CR1), conserved region 3 (CR3), and a part of α6 of the DH domain as well as the DH-PH junction site that are exposed near the center of one side of the molecule as the important sites involved in the formation of a Rho GTPase interactive pocket (17Zhu K. Debreceni B. Li R. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25993-26001Google Scholar). The involvement of these areas of DH domain in substrate recognition has been further evidenced recently by a few x-ray structural complexes of GEF-Rho proteins (30Aghazadeh B. Zhu K. Kubiseski T.J. Liu G.A. Pawson T. Zheng Y. Rosen M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1098-1107Google Scholar, 31Liu X. Wang H. Eberstadt M. Schnuchel A. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Schkeryantz J.M. Janowick D.A.

Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 468-475Google Scholar). Based on the crystallography and structural mapping data, we focused in the present studies on the TrioN structural module that contains the N-terminal DH and PH domains of Trio and is specific for Rac1 (35Debant A. Serra-Pages C. Seipel K. O'Brien S. Tang M. Park S.H. Streuli M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5466-5471Google Scholar, 36Bellanger J.M. Lazaro J.B. Diriong S. Fernandez A. Lamb N. Debant A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 147-152Google Scholar), hoping to derive a TrioN mutant that could act dominant negatively on Rac1. We chose to examine two DH domain residues of TrioN in detail. One is Asn1406 at the C-terminal end of DH domain, and another is Thr1244 located in the CR1. These residues correspond to the Asn1232 and Thr1051 of Tiam1, respectively, and both are highly conserved among Dbl family members (Fig. 2A; Ref. 37Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Google Scholar). Asn1232 of Tiam1 forms a hydrogen bond with the conserved switch II residue Asp65 of Rac1 in the Tiam1-Rac1 complex (Fig. 2, A and B), and such a pairing appears to be highly conserved in all the available structures of GEF-Rho protein complexes (32Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Sondek J. Nature. 2000; 408: 682-688Google Scholar, 33Rossman K.L. Worthylake D.K. Snyder J.T. Siderovski D.P. Campbell S.L. Sondek J.

Thr1051 of Tiam1 is involved in van der Waals interaction with the switch I residue Val36 of Rac1 in the Tiam1-Rac1 complex; such a pairing is also conserved in the available GEF-Rho GTPase structures (32Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Sondek J. Nature. 2000; 408: 682-688Google Scholar, 33Rossman K.L. Worthylake D.K. Snyder J.T. Siderovski D.P. Campbell S.L. Sondek J.

We produced N1406A/D1407A and T1244A mutants of TrioN as well as wild type TrioN as His6-tagged fusion proteins and tested their GEF catalytic and substrate binding activities on Rac1 by reconstituting the purified components. As shown in Fig. 3A, the T1244A mutant remained partially active in stimulating [3H]GDP dissociation from Rac1, while N1406A/D1407A had lost the GEF catalytic activity completely. The latter mutant could actually further slow intrinsic [3H]GDP dissociation from Rac1, suggesting it retained the ability to interact with Rac1. Indeed a direct complex formation assay demonstrated that while T1244A only weakly interacted with Rac1, the N1406A/D1407A mutant mostly preserved the substrate binding activity under the assay conditions (Fig. 3B). A single point mutant of TrioN, N1406A, that contains mutation at the critical Asn1406, behaved similarly to the N1406A/D1407A double mutant (Fig. 2B and data not shown). These observations prompted us to further test whether the pairing residue of the substrate, Asp65 of Rac1, might also play a similar role in GEF catalysis. As shown in Fig. 3, C and D, the D65A mutant of Rac1 has completely lost the responsiveness to TrioN stimulation in a fluorescence-based GEF activity assay while still retaining the ability to bind to TrioN in complex formation. These results indicate that the Asn1406-Asp65 pairing of TrioN and Rac1 interaction serves as a critical structural determinant responsible for the GEF catalysis, consistent with the previous structural prediction from the Tiam1-Rac1 complex (32Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Sondek J. Nature. 2000; 408:"
https://openalex.org/W1991331166,"The water meniscus bisects the eyes of the ""four-eyed"" fish Anableps anableps, resulting in simultaneous vision in air and water. We compare the structure and macromolecular compositions of the Anableps dorsal (air) and ventral (water) corneas with the fully aquatic zebrafish cornea. The Anableps dorsal corneal epithelium is thicker (>20 cell layers), flatter (approximately 1.94 mm radius of curvature), and contains approximately 15-fold more glycogen (0.16 microg/microg water-soluble protein) than the ventral corneal epithelium (5-7 cell layers; approximately 1.63 mm radius of curvature; 0.01 microg glycogen/microg water-soluble protein), which resembles the zebrafish corneal epithelium. Gelsolin is the major water-soluble protein in the zebrafish (approximately 50%) and Anableps dorsal (approximately 38%) and ventral (approximately 21%) corneal epithelia, suggesting that gelsolin was recruited for high corneal expression before these two species diverged at least 100 million years ago and that abundant corneal gelsolin is not limited to aquatic vision. Anableps gelsolin, deduced from its cDNA, is 57% identical to zebrafish gelsolin. Paucity of Anableps corneal F-actin (consistent with high gelsolin) was confirmed by the absence of rhodamine-phalloidin staining. We suggest amphibious refraction and protection from UV irradiation and desiccation in air as selective constraints for the specializations of the Anableps dorsal cornea."
https://openalex.org/W2063183366,"The purposes of this study were to test 1) the relationship between two widely studied mitogenic effector pathways, and 2) the hypothesis that sodium-proton exchanger type 1 (NHE-1) is a regulator of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) activation in rat aortic smooth muscle (RASM) cells. Angiotensin II (Ang II) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) stimulated both ERK and NHE-1 activities, with activation of NHE-1 preceding that of ERK. The concentration-response curves for 5-HT and Ang II were superimposable for both processes. Inhibition of NHE-1 with pharmacological agents or by isotonic replacement of sodium in the perfusate with choline or tetramethylammonium greatly attenuated ERK activation by 5-HT or Ang II. Similar maneuvers significantly attenuated 5-HT- or Ang II-mediated activation of MEK and Ras but not transphosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor. EGF receptor blockade attenuated ERK activation, but not NHE-1 activation by 5-HT and Ang II, suggesting that the EGF receptor and NHE-1 work in parallel to stimulate ERK activity in RASM cells, converging distal to the EGF receptor but at or above the level of Ras in the Ras-MEK-ERK pathway. Receptor-independent activation of NHE-1 by acute acid loading of RASM cells resulted in the rapid phosphorylation of ERK, which could be blocked by pharmacological inhibitors of NHE-1 or by isotonic replacement of sodium, closely linking the proton transport function of NHE-1 to ERK activation.

These studies identify NHE as a new regulator of ERK activity in RASM cells. Activation of several major effectors has been linked to mitogenic stimuli. Two of those effectors are the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) 1The abbreviations used are: ERK, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase; Ang II, angiotensin II; BCECF, 2′-7′-bis[2-carboxymethyl]-5[6]-carboxyfluorescein; CaM, calmodulin; EGF, epidermal growth factor; ECAR, extracellular acidification rate; EIPA, 5-N-ethyl-N-isopropyl-amiloride; FLIPR, fluorescent imaging plate reader; 5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine; MEK, mitogen- and extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; MIA, 5-N-methyl-N-isobutyl-amiloride; NHE, Na+/H+ exchanger; NHE-1, type 1 NHE; PKC, protein kinase C; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; RASM, rat aortic smooth muscle cells. type of mitogen-activated protein kinases and Na+/H+ exchangers (NHE). ERK is one member of a family of kinases that participate in mitogenic signaling through complex phosphorylation cascades that convert cell surface signals into nuclear transcription programs. In the typical scenario, GTP-bound Ras, a small G protein, activates Raf kinase. In an alternative scenario, Raf is activated by protein kinase C or other signaling molecules. In either case, Raf phosphorylates and activates mitogen and extracellular signal-regulated kinases kinase (MEK), which in turn phosphorylates and activates ERK. Activated ERK translocates to the nucleus, where it activates a number of transcription factors such as Elk-1. Thus, this pathway can be depicted in a linear form as follows: Ras-GTP (or protein kinase C) → Raf-1 kinase → MEK → ERK. NHEs are expressed at the surface of all mammalian cells, serving to regulate cell volume, intracellular pH (pHi), and transepithelial transport of Na+ and acid-base equivalents (1.Putney L.K. Denker S.P. Barber D.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 527-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 2.Noel J. Pouysségur J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C283-C296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The signal transduction pathways involved in activating NHEs have been more elusive. Although ERK play relatively well defined roles in mitogenesis, those of NHEs are less clear in that NHEs are possibly permissive factors rather than absolute necessities for mitogenesis (3.Rozengurt E. Science. 1986; 234: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). Although it has been known for some time that mitogens typically activate both NHE and ERK in concert (2.Noel J.

In those studies, Ras most likely increased NHE activity by an up-regulation of NHE message and protein via ERK-regulated transcriptional processes. Recent work has shown that short-term activation of ERK leads to rapid stimulation of NHE-1 in multiple cell types (platelets, erythrocytes, fibroblasts, MDCK-11 cells, rabbit skeletal muscle, and cultured rat neonatal and adult ventricular cardiomyocytes) when activated by diverse stimuli, including angiotensin II (Ang II), cannabinoid ligands, aldosterone, and H2O2 (10.Aharonovitz O.

Hearse D.J. Avkiran M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 53: 470-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). ERK also has been shown to activate NHE-3 in kidney proximal tubule cells (23.Liu F. Gesek F.A. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 280: F415-F425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Tsuganezawa H. Sato S. Yamaji Y. Preisig P.A. Moe O.W. Alpern R.J. Kidney Int. 2002; 62: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). At least in some cases, the short-term stimulation of NHE by ERK is mediated by phosphorylation of NHE either by ERK itself or by p90rsk, a newly described ERK-activated kinase (16.Moor A.N. Gan X.T.

It has been suggested that activation of the Ang II receptor first leads to activation of the MEK-ERK-p90rsk pathway and that activated p90rsk in turn directly phosphorylates and activates NHE-1 in rat aortic vascular smooth muscle (RASM) cells. Subsequent experiments that have been performed in fibroblasts resulted in identification of NHE-1 serine 703 as a major target of serum-stimulated p90rsk (28.Takahashi E. Abe J. Gallis B.

However, it is still not clear whether Ang II-induced phosphorylation of NHE-1 takes place in RASM cells in vivo and whether this phosphorylation is physiologically significant. Nonetheless, there is clear evidence that ERK can increase the activity of NHE by increasing its expression and/or by stimulating the activity of existing NHE molecules. On the other hand, several groups have been unable to show any role for ERK in activating NHE in multiple cell types, including U937 cells (29.Gillis D. Shrode L.D. Krump E. Howard C.M. Rubie E.A. Tibbles L.A. Woodgett J. Grinstein S. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 181: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), human PMNs (5.Krump E. Nikitas K. Grinstein S. J. Biol.

Cell. 1998; 90: 477-485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), proximal tubule cells (23.Liu F. Gesek F.A. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 280: F415-F425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Ehrlich ascites cells (31.Pederson S.F. Varming C. Christensen S.T. Hoffmann E.K. J. Membr. Biol. 2002; 189: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), or Chinese hamster ovary cells (32.Garnovskaya M.N. Mukhin Y. Raymond J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Moreover, there is one report in which ERK was shown to mediate inhibition of NHE activity in MTAL cells (33.Watts III, B.A. Good D.W. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2002; 282: F1056-F1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Therefore, the ability of ERK to stimulate NHE activity has not been a universal finding. Despite the increasing interest in potential roles for ERK in the activation of NHE, surprisingly little is known regarding the role of NHE in regulating ERK. NHE is not involved in ERK activation in hepatic stellate cells (34.Di Sario A. Bendia E. Taffetani S. Marzioni M. Candelaresi C. Pigini P. Schindler U. Kleemann H.W. Trozzi L. Macarri G. Benedetti A. Hepatology. 2003; 37: 256-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) or Chinese hamster ovary cells (32.Garnovskaya M.N. Mukhin Y. Raymond J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast, there have been two reports that suggest that NHE might play a role in regulating ERK activation. Takewaki et al. (35.Takewaki S. Kuro-o M. Hiroi Y. Yamazaki T. Noguchi T. Miyagishi A. Nakahara K. Aikawa M. Manabe I. Yazaki Y. Nagai R. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1995; 27: 729-742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) presented some evidence that a potent antagonist of NHE-1 could partially inhibit stretch-induced activation of ERK in the cultured cardiomyocytes. In human gut cells, NHE inhibition suppressed both activation of the p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase and NFκB (36.Nemeth Z.H. Deitch E.A. Szabo C. Mabley J.G. Pacher P. Fekete Z. Hauser C.J. Hasko G. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2002; 283: G122-G132Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although it is clear that NHE and ERK can be activated in concert, the relationship between these two key mitogenic cellular proteins varies between cell types. 5-HT and Ang II have previously been shown to activate both NHE and ERK in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (37.Touyz R.M. Schiffrin E.L. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 639-672PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Garnovskaya M.N. Mukhin Y.V. Turner J.H. Vlasova T.M. Ullian M.E. Raymond J.R.

Benedict C.R. J. Vasc. Res. 2001; 38: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Recently we conducted a screen for signaling molecules that could be involved in activation of NHE in RASM cells and demonstrated that the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor and the angiotensin AT1 receptor activate NHE through a pathway that involves phospholipase C, elevated intracellular Ca2+, calmodulin (CaM), and Janus kinase 2 (38.Garnovskaya M.N. Mukhin Y.V. Turner J.H. Vlasova T.M. Ullian M.E. Raymond J.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7178-7187Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). NHE and ERK have each been proposed as key therapeutic targets for vascular illnesses, including myocardial infarction and reperfusion injury (41.Avkiran M. Marber M.S. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2002; 39: 747-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), ventricular fibrillation (42.Gazmuri R.J. Hoffner E. Kalcheim J. Ho H. Patel M. Ayoub I.M. Epstein M. Kingston S. Han Y. J.

Ther. 2001; 298: 469-476PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in the current study we investigated the role of NHE in ERK activation in vascular smooth muscle cells derived from rat aorta using 5-HT and Ang II as our primary test agents. Materials—Cell culture supplies were obtained from Invitrogen or Corning Costar (Cambridge, MA). Ethylisopropylamiloride (EIPA) and methylisobutylamiloride (MIA) were from RBI (Natick, MA). Angiotensin II, 5-HT, and probenecid were from Sigma. Phospho-ERK and phospho-MEK kits were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The Ras activation kit was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). W-7, GF109203X, PD98059, and ophiobolin were from Calbiochem. BCECF was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Black 96-well microtiter plates needed for the FLIPR were from Corning Costar. Black pipette tips were from Molecular Devices Corp. (Sunnyvale, CA). Measurement of Extracellular Acidification Rate (ECAR) by Microphysiometer—For all of the experiments, RASM cells were plated onto polycarbonate membranes (3-μm pore size, 12-mm size) at a density of 300,000 cells/insert the night prior to experimentation. After cells were attached to the membranes, they were growth arrested in serum-free culture medium for 20 h before the experiment. The day of the study, cells were washed with serum-free, bicarbonate-free Ham's F-12 medium, placed into chambers of a microphysiometer (Molecular Devices Corp.) (45.McConnell H.M. Owicki J.C. Parce J.W. Miller D.L. Baxter G.T. Wada H.G. Pitchford S. Science. 1992; 257: 1906-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), and perfused at 37 °C with the same medium or balanced salt solutions. For most studies, the pump cycle was set to perfuse cells for 60 s, followed by a 30-s “pump-off” phase during which proton efflux was measured from the 6th through the 28th seconds. Cells were exposed to the test agent for three or four cycles (270–360 s). Valve switches (to add or remove test agents) were performed at the middle of the pump cycle. Data points were then acquired every 90 s. The peak effect during stimulation was expressed as the percentage increase from baseline. ERK and MEK Assays—ERK and MEK phosphorylations were assessed by immunoblot using phosphorylation state-specific antibodies as previously described (46.Greene E.L. Houghton O. Collinsworth G. Garnovskaya M.N. Nagai T. Sajjad T. Bheemanathini V. Grewal J.S. Paul R.V. Raymond J.R. Am. J. Physiol. Renal. Physiol. 2000; 278: F650-F658Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47.Grewal J.S.

Cell Culture—RASM cells were obtained as described previously (48.Ullian M.E. Walsh L.G. Morinelli T.A. Cardiovasc. Res. 1996; 32: 266-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) by terminal harvesting of aortas from male Sprague-Dawley rats (150–275 g; Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) using anesthesia under a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Medical University of South Carolina. A 2-cm segment of artery cleaned of fat and adventitia was incubated in 1 mg/ml collagenase for 3 h at room temperature. The artery was then cut into small sections and fixed to a culture flask for explantation in minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 1% nonessential amino acids, 100 milliunit/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air-5% CO2. Medium was changed every 3–4 days, and cells were passaged every 6–8 days by harvesting with trypsin-EDTA. We have previously characterized these cultures by immunostaining as positive for intracellular cytoskeletal fibrils of actin and smooth muscle cell-specific myosin and negative for factor VIII antigens. RASM cells isolated by this procedure were homogeneous and were used in all studies between passages 3 and 7. Ras Assay—Ras activation was assessed by a nonradioactive Ras assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc) as previously described (49.Mukhin Y.V. Garnovsky E.A. Ullian M.E. Garnovskaya M.N. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 304: 968-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Quiescent RASM cell monolayers were pretreated with 10 μm MIA or vehicle for 30 min, stimulated with 1 μm 5-HT, 100 nm Ang II, or vehicle for 5 min, and lysed in a 1 ml/100 mm-dish of Mg2+ lysis buffer (MLB) (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Igepal CA-630, 25 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin each, 10% glycerol). Cell lysates were precleared by incubating with glutathione-agarose for 10 min at 4 °C. Precleared lysates (1 μg/μl total cell protein) were incubated with 10 μg of Raf-1 Ras binding domain (glutathione S-transferase fusion protein, corresponding to the Ras binding domain of Raf-1), and bound to glutathioneagarose for 30 min at 4 °C. The agarose beads were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with MLB buffer, resuspended in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunoblot analysis with monoclonal anti-Ras IgG. EGF Receptor Phosphorylation Assay—The phosphorylation state of EGFR was assessed by immunoprecipitation/Western blotting studies as previously described (49.Mukhin Y.V. Garnovsky E.A. Ullian M.E. Garnovskaya M.N. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 304: 968-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Quiescent RASM cells, grown in 100-mm dishes, were pretreated with vehicle or 10 μm MIA for 30 min. RASM cells were subsequently treated with 1 μm 5-HT, 100 nm Ang II, or vehicle for 5 min and lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, each). Cell lysates were precleared by incubating with a protein A-agarose bead slurry for 30 min at 4 °C. Precleared lysates (1 μg/μl total cell protein) were incubated with 4 μg of anti-EGFR polyclonal IgG (Upstate Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were captured by the addition of protein A-agarose bead slurry and incubation for 2 h more at 4 °C. The agarose beads were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with RIPA buffer, resuspended in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. After semidry transfer to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes, the membranes were probed with monoclonal antibodies to assess the phosphorylation state of EGFR or with EGFR antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc). Measurement of Intracellular pH—Intracellular pH (pHi) was measured in 96-well microtiter plates using a FLIPR fluorescent imaging plate reader (50.Schroeder K.S. Neagle B.D. J. Biomol. Screen. 1996; 1: 75-80Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The night prior to experimentation, RASM cells were plated at a density of ∼50,000 cells/well of black 96-well microtiter plates. The following morning, cells were washed with Hank's balanced salt solution and then loaded with 5 μm BCECF for one hour. Cells were washed four times with Hank's balanced salt solution containing 2.5 mm probenecid, 1% fetal bovine serum, and 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) with an automated platewasher (Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland). 20 min before the end of the loading phase, 20 mm NH4Cl was added to each well. Cells were then washed four times with the loading buffer containing 20 mm NH4Cl. In the FLIPR, cells were acid loaded by an ammonium chloride prepulse protocol. In this method, the extracellular buffer contains NH4+ and NH3 in an equilibrium that is essentially recapitulated in the cell interior. When the extracellular medium is changed to a buffer lacking NH4Cl, intracellular NH3 diffuses rapidly out of the cell, causing the cells to become acutely “loaded” with protons donated from NH4+ (51.Boron W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1977; 233: C61-C73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 96 wells were simultaneously illuminated for 0.3 s by an Argon laser (488 nm) set at ∼0.3 watt. Non-ratiometric fluorescence emission readings were obtained using a 540-nm bandpass filter at 1-s intervals. Calibration of the BCECF fluorescence response to changes in intracellular pH was performed on a separate 96-well plate of cells using the electroneutral H+/K+ ionophore, nigericin (52.Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar). Using this strategy, when the K+ concentration is equal on both sides of the plasma membrane, the intracellular pH is clamped to the same value as in the extracellular medium. For calibration, cells were washed and equilibrated with buffers of varied pH and 130 mm KCl (the estimated intracellular concentration of K+). Calibration plots were generated by equilibrating intracellular to extracellular pH by adding 20 μm nigericin (K+/H+ ionophore) to cells in various pH buffers. 5-HT and Ang II Activate Na+/H+ in RASM—We have recently shown that the 5-HT2A and AT1A receptors activate NHE in kidney mesangial cells and RASM cells, respectively (53.Garnovskaya M.N. Nebigil C.G. Arthur J.M. Spurney R.F. Raymond J.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 230-237PubMed Google Scholar, 54.Chen R. Mukhin Y.V. Garnovskaya M.N. Thielen T.E. Iijima Y. Huang C. Raymond J.R. Ullian M.E. Paul R.V. Am. J. Physiol. Renal. Physiol. 2000; 279: F440-F448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Fig. 1, we used proton microphysiometry to verify that 5-HT and Ang II each stimulate time-dependent increases in ECAR from monolayers of RASM cells (Fig. 1A). The increase in ECAR is because of proton efflux (and not bicarbonate uptake) because the cells were superfused with nominally bicarbonate-free media. Moreover, the increase in ECAR could be blocked by removal of sodium from the perfusate (Fig. 1B) or by preincubation with 5 μm EIPA or 10 μm MIA, inhibitors of NHE-1 and -2 (Fig. 1C). Thus, both 5-HT and Ang II stimulate sodium-dependent and EIPA/MIA-inhibitable proton efflux from RASM cells. Because NHE-1 is the only NHE expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells (55.Lucchesi P.A. DeRoux N. Berk B.C. Hypertension. 1994; 24: 734-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), 5-HT and Ang II most likely activate NHE-1 in RASM cells. We next used microphysiometry to establish that the activation of NHE was dependent upon the concentration of Ang II or 5-HT to which the RASM cells were exposed (Fig. 2). We also established that both ligands could activate ERK in our RASM cells by using a phosphorylation state-specific antibody that recognizes phosphorylated ERK1 and -2. Further, we compared the concentration-response relationships for the ability of Ang II and 5-HT to activate ERK and NHE (Fig. 2). Those experiments demonstrated that the concentration-response relationships for each agonist to activate NHE and to induce phosphorylation of ERK were virtually superimposable. This suggested to us that there might be a relationship between the two pathways in RASM cells. This was not surprising in that a number of previous studies have demonstrated a role for ERK in activating NHE in various cell types (10.Aharonovitz O. Granot Y. J. Biol.

Those studies showed that the MEK inhibitor blocked ERK activation without affecting NHE activity (Fig. 3, A and B). Similar results were obtained when the Ras-MEK-ERK pathway was inhibited using apigenin. Thus, it appears that i"
https://openalex.org/W2164445979,"RON is a receptor tyrosine kinase of the MET family that is involved in cell proliferation, cell survival, and cell motility in both normal and disease states. Macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP) is the RON ligand whose binding to RON causes receptor activation. RON is a trans-membrane heterodimer comprised of one α- and one β-chain originating from a single-chain precursor and held together by several disulfide bonds. The intracellular part of RON contains the kinase domain and regulatory elements. The extracellular region is characterized by the presence of a sema domain (a stretch of ∼500 amino acids with several highly conserved cysteine residues), a PSI (plexin, semaphorins, integrins) domain, and four immunoglobulin-like folds. Here we show that a soluble, secreted molecule representing the sema domain of RON (referred to as ron-sema) has a dominant negative effect on the ligand-induced receptor activation and is capable of inhibiting RON-dependent signaling pathways and cellular responses. Results suggest that the sema domain of RON participates in ligand binding by the full-length receptor. The ability of ron-sema to suppress growth of MSP-responsive cells in culture, including cancer cells, points to a potential therapeutic use of this molecule, and forced expression of it could potentially be used as a gene therapy tool for treating MSP-dependent types of cancer.

The ability of ron-sema to suppress growth of MSP-responsive cells in culture, including cancer cells, points to a potential therapeutic use of this molecule, and forced expression of it could potentially be used as a gene therapy tool for treating MSP-dependent types of cancer. The human receptor tyrosine kinases MET and RON (MST1R) (and their respective orthologs in other species) form a unique, two-member gene family that encodes proteins with identical modular structure that may perform similar functions. Oncogenic activating mutations of MET were discovered in hereditary renal carcinoma of the papillary type (1Schmidt L. Duh F.M. Chen F. Kishida T. Glenn G. Choyke P. Scherer S.W. Zhuang Z.

Invest. 2002; 109: 863-867Google Scholar). Oncogenic amplification and overexpression of MET were also reported previously (3Danilkovitch-Miagkova A. Zbar B. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 863-867Google Scholar). The involvement of RON in carcinogenesis is much less understood. We have recently discovered that RON is negatively controlled by the tumor suppressor protein HYAL2 and becomes activated in a ligand-independent mechanism upon HYAL2 removal, leading to cell transformation (4Danilkovitch-Miagkova A. Duh F.M. Kuzmin I. Angeloni D. Liu S.L. Miller A.D. Lerman M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4580-4585Google Scholar). An oncogenic function of RON was also demonstrated in a transgenic model (5Wang M.H. Wang D. Chen Y.Q. Carcinogenesis. 2003; 24: 1291-1300Google Scholar).RON is almost ubiquitously expressed (6Gaudino G. Avantaggiato V. Follenzi A. Acampora D. Simeone A. Comoglio P.M.

Cancer Drug Targets. 2003; 3: 31-40Google Scholar) in which RON kinase activity is deregulated. The extracellular part of RON is comprised of a sema domain, a PSI 1The abbreviations used are: PSIplexin semaphorins integrinsIPTimmunoglobulin-like fold shared by plexins and transcription factorsMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromideELISAphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideMSPmacrophage-stimulating protein.1The abbreviations used are: PSIplexin semaphorins integrinsIPTimmunoglobulin-like fold shared by plexins and transcription factorsMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromideELISAphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideMSPmacrophage-stimulating protein. domain (plexin semaphorins integrins (16Bork P. Doerks T. Springer T.A. Snel B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 261-263Google Scholar), also known as MRS domain (MET-related sequence) (17Artigiani S. Comoglio P.M. Tamagnone L. IUBMB Life. 1999; 48: 477-482Google Scholar)), and four IPT domains (immunoglobulin-like fold shared by plexins and transcription factors (16Bork P. Doerks T. Springer T.A. Snel B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 261-263Google Scholar)). The functional role of these domains remains unknown. The sema domain (whose presence in RON and MET makes them a unique family among the approximate 20 receptor tyrosine kinase families identified by the Human Genome Project) is represented by a block of ∼500 amino acids with 15 conserved cysteine residues intermingled with stretches of conserved amino acids and a conserved potential glycosylation site (18Kolodkin A.L. Matthes D.J. Goodman C.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 1389-1399Google Scholar). This domain is also present in semaphorins and plexins (a class of semaphorin receptors).Secreted semaphorins and their receptors were initially discovered by their ability to induce axon steering and collapse of the growth cone in vitro, but it is now evident their biological function is not confined to the neural system and involves at least the immune (19Hall K.T. Boumsell L. Schultze J.L. Boussiotis V.A. Dorfman D.M. Cardoso A.A. Bensussan A. Nadler L.M. Freeman G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11780-11785Google Scholar, 20Delaire S. Elhabazi A. Bensussan A. Boumsell L. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 1265-1276Google Scholar), cardiovascular, and skeletal systems (21Behar O. Golden J.A. Mashimo H. Schoen F.J. Fishman M.C. Nature. 1996; 383: 525-528Google Scholar) in vertebrates. Semaphorins are also overexpressed in metastasizing cancer cells (22Yamada T. Endo R. Gotoh M. Hirohashi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14713-14718Google Scholar, 23Christensen C.R. Klingelhofer J. Tarabykina S. Hulgaard E.F. Kramerov D. Lukanidin E. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1238-1244Google Scholar), possibly facilitating cell dissociation and survival. Because the sema domain of semaphorins mediates receptor specificity (24Feiner L. Koppel A.M. Kobayashi H. Raper J.A. Neuron. 1997; 19: 539-545Google Scholar), we reasoned that the sema domain of RON might contain the ligand-binding region.In this study, we show that two soluble molecules designed over the sema and sema + PSI domains of RON (referred to as “ron-sema” and “ron-PSI,” respectively) undergo correct post-translational processing and are secreted when expressed in mammalian cells. Both molecules inhibit ligand binding to the RON receptor (both α- and β-MSP-binding sites), indicating that the RON sema domain may contain the ligand-binding sites and mediate ligand-binding specificity. In addition, we found that these secreted soluble molecules have a highly specific dominant-negative effect on RON kinase activation. Such activity extends to inhibiting the proliferation of MSP-sensitive cells in culture, including cancer cell lines. This highlights the potential therapeutic use of the secreted soluble molecules ron-sema and ron-PSI to inhibit MSP-dependent tumor growth. The forced expression of these secreted soluble molecules could represent a gene therapy tool to treat MSP-dependent types of cancer.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Human recombinant α-β-heterodimeric MSP, free MSP α- and β-chains, and recombinant mouse MSP receptor RON/Fc chimera were from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Human EGF was from Invitrogen. Human recombinant HGF was a gift from Dr. P. Godowski (Genentech, San Francisco, CA). Rabbit and mouse anti-MSP antibodies were described previously (25Wang M.H. Skeel A. Yoshimura T. Copeland T.D. Sakaguchi K. Leonard E.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 54: 289-295Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-human RON (C-20), goat anti-human EGFR (1005-G), rabbit anti-human MET (C-28), and goat anti-mouse MET (SP260) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (Clone 4G10) and anti-FLAGM2 antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Monoclonal anti-phospho-MAPK antibody (E10) was from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Monoclonal anti-MAPK (ERK1/2) antibody was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Other chemicals were from Sigma or Invitrogen.Constructs and Cloning Procedures—ron-sema was amplified by PCR from RON cDNA with the primers 17 forward (5′-CAG CTC GCC TCG ATG GAG-3′) and 1583 reverse (5′-GGA AAA CCT GGT CCC CAG AGG-3′) in 1.5 mm MgCl2 under the following PCR conditions: 5 min at 95 °C; 35 times (1 min at 95 °C, 30 s at 64 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C); and 7 min at 72 °C. The PCR product (1549 bp, 519 amino acids) was cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen), sequenced, and cloned into the HindIII/EcoRV restriction sites of the pFLAG-CMV-2 expression vector (Sigma).ron-PSI was PCR amplified with the primers (ABI Applied Biosystems, Frederick, MD) 17 forward (5′-CAG CTC GCC TCG ATG GAG-3′) and 1762 reverse (5′-ACT GTG GGG GTG GAA CTC AGT AAG C-3′) in 1.5 mm MgCl2 under the same cycling conditions. The 1747-bp PCR product (578 amino acid) was first cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen), sequenced, and cloned into the HindIII sites of pFLAG-CMV-2 (Sigma). The primer location is given according to GenBank™ accession number X70040. Sequencing was performed with ABI 373 stretch automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Human MET cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. L. Schmidt (Laboratory of Immunobiology, SAIC-NCI, Frederick, MD).Cell Lines—HEK 293, HEK293T, MDCK, and colon cancer HCT116 cell lines were from ATCC (Manassas, VA). RE7 cell line (MDCK cells stably expressing human RON) was described previously (26Wang M.H. Ronsin C. Gesnel M.C. Coupey L. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. Breathnach R. Science. 1994; 266: 117-119Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in media containing 10% fetal calf serum according to ATCC recommendation.Transfections—HEK293 and HEK293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. For transient transfection, cells were grown to 80-90% confluence on 10-cm dishes and transfected with 30 μg of cDNAs of the empty vector or the ron-sema or ron-PSI construct using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 6 h after transfection, the medium was replaced by 6 ml/dish serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and cells were incubated for 3 days. The 3-day-old conditioned media were collected and analyzed for the presence of ron-sema or ron-PSI proteins by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. HEK 293 cells were similarly transiently transfected with human MET cDNA.Cell Stimulation, Immunoprecipitation, and Western blotting—Cells were starved overnight in serum-free medium and then stimulated for 15 min with 5 nm MSP or 50 ng/ml EGF or 100 ng/ml HGF diluted in preconditioned culture medium containing secreted ron-sema or ron-PSI. Preconditioned medium of non-transfected cells was used as negative control. After stimulation, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 units/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Insoluble material was removed by low-speed centrifugation. Supernatants were further analyzed. Molecules of interest were immunoprecipitated from cleared lysates by appropriate antibodies added with protein G-agarose to the lysates. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, immunoprecipitates were washed three times with HNTG buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol). 15 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer were added to each tube. After 5 min of boiling, precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Membrane-bound protein bands were visualized with appropriate antibodies according to standard Western blotting procedures. Cleared total cell lysates were used in SDS-PAGE and Western blotting for detection of MAPK activation.In Vitro Cell Proliferation Assay—RE7 cells (MDCK cells stably expressing the human RON receptor) (26Wang M.H. Ronsin C. Gesnel M.C. Coupey L. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. Breathnach R. Science. 1994; 266: 117-119Google Scholar) were plated (2 × 103 cells/well) in triplicate in 96-well plates and incubated with 5 nm MSP diluted in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus preconditioned culture medium containing secreted ron-sema or ron-PSI (final ratio 1:1). Conditioned medium of non-transfected cells was used as negative control. HCT116 colon cancer cells (2 × 103 cells/well) were distributed in duplicates in 24-well plates and incubated with or without 5 nm MSP in McCoy serum-free medium plus preconditioned culture medium containing ron-sema or ron-PSI (final ratio 1:1). Cell number was determined after 72 h by adding 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) into culture wells and measuring A570 2 h later. Cell number was determined from an MTT calibration curve specific for each cell line.ELISA—All of the experiments were performed as described previously (27Danilkovitch A. Miller M. Leonard E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29937-29943Google Scholar). ELISA microtiter plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with recombinant mouse MSP-receptor RON/Fc (mrRON/Fc) chimera (R&D Systems, Inc.) (100 μl/well at 0.5 μg/ml in carbonate-bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6). Unspecific binding sites were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (1 h at 37 °C). Subsequently, RON-coated ELISA plates were incubated for 2 h with a series of 2-fold dilutions of human recombinant MSP (highest concentration, 2 nm), free β-chain (highest concentration, 2 nm), or free α-chain (highest concentration, 100 nm) in culture medium from HEK293T cells transiently transfected with empty vector (negative control) or ron-sema cDNA construct. ELISA plates were then washed three times with Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20. Plates were then incubated for 2 h with rabbit polyclonal anti-MSP antibodies. Bound rabbit anti-MSP was detected by equilibration with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. Substrate 104 (Sigma) was used for quantifying alkaline phosphatase activity. A405 was measured with an ELISA reader. At least three independent experiments were performed. The effect caused by ron-sema on MSP binding, β-chain binding, and α-chain binding to mrRON/Fc was calculated in percent inhibition versus the effects of the control culture medium at each experimental point. The binding of MSP α- or β-chains in the presence of the blank medium (preconditioned medium of non-transfected cells) was counted as 100%.RESULTSThe Expression Constructs Designed over the sema and sema + PSI Domains of RON Are Correctly Processed and Secreted after Translation—The sema domain is characterized by the presence of ∼15 highly conserved cysteine residues interspersed in ∼500 amino acids (18Kolodkin A.L. Matthes D.J. Goodman C.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 1389-1399Google Scholar). The PSI domain contains eight conserved cysteines distributed in ∼50 residues. Initially, it was part of the definition of sema domain but because not all of the semaphorines contain a PSI domain, this modular structure was redefined (16Bork P. Doerks T. Springer T.A. Snel B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 261-263Google Scholar). The minimal consensus sequence for the PSI domain was described previously (16Bork P. Doerks T. Springer T.A. Snel B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 261-263Google Scholar, 17Artigiani S. Comoglio P.M. Tamagnone L. IUBMB Life. 1999; 48: 477-482Google Scholar) as C-X-(5-6)-C-X-(2)-C-X-(6-8)-C-X-(2)-C-X-(3-5)-C. To obtain a soluble molecule that could mimic the activity of ron-sema and sema + PSI domains, we amplified by PCR these regions from RON cDNA and cloned them into expression vectors. On the basis of a consensus sequence for the sema domain (16Bork P. Doerks T. Springer T.A. Snel B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 261-263Google Scholar), we designed PCR primers to amplify a cDNA stretch corresponding to the N-terminal part of the protein up to amino acid Phe-518 (this molecule is referred to as ron-sema in Fig. 1B). A region comprising up to amino acid Ser-578 was amplified for the longer sema + PSI domain (referred to as ron-PSI). All of the residues in the N-terminal sequence were amplified, starting from the first ATG to include the first 24 amino acids of the predicted signal peptide (9Ronsin C. Muscatelli F. Mattei M.G. Breathnach R. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1195-1202Google Scholar). An expression vector was chosen that provides an N-terminal FLAG but no artificial signal peptide. Western blot in reducing conditions of proteins immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies from the conditioned culture medium of HEK293T cells transfected with each construct, respectively, shows two bands of approximately 70 and 35 kDa. The upper bands (Fig. 1B, left panel) correspond to the uncleaved soluble molecules ron-sema and ron-PSI. The lower band (Fig. 1B, left panel) corresponds to the α-chain alone (derived from the predicted cleavage at the KRRR site), identifiable through the fusion with the FLAG epitope. The fragment of β-chain is released after the reduction of the disulfide bonds, which in the mature receptor connect the two chains together, and remains undetectable by anti-FLAG antibodies used in this experiment. The upper band migrates with a molecular weight higher than expected, most probably because of post-translational events such as N-glycosylation and N-myristoylation predicted by sequence analysis (28Bairoch A. Bucher P. Hofmann K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 217-221Google Scholar). In non-reducing conditions (Fig. 1B, right panel), the soluble molecules, consisting of α- and β-chain fragment held together by the disulfide bonds, migrate with a molecular mass slightly higher than 70 kDa. These results show that the constructs are translated and the resulting proteins are processed as expected with the final product conveyed to the cell membrane and released in the culture medium.The Soluble Molecule ron-sema Interferes with the Ligand Binding Activity of the Full-length Receptor—The extracellular part of RON is known to contain the ligand binding pocket; however, the site of RON interaction with its ligand MSP has not been mapped. We investigated effects of soluble ron-sema (and ron-PSI, data not shown) on the ligand binding activity of RON. The addition of MSP to RON-expressing cells causes the formation of ligand-receptor complexes. As shown in Fig. 2A, MSP can be co-immunoprecipitated with RON. The presence of ron-sema in the culture medium during cell stimulation with MSP reduces the amount of MSP co-immunoprecipitated with RON (Fig. 2A, lane 4).Fig. 2The sema domain of the RON receptor inhibits MSP binding to RON.A, RE7 cells were stimulated with 5 nm MSP for 15 min. in the presence of blank medium or preconditioned culture medium containing ron-sema-soluble molecule. Cells were then lysed, and the RON receptor immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with anti-RON antibodies. MSP presence in RON precipitates was detected by Western blotting (WB) with anti-MSP antibodies (upper panel). Lower panel, reblotting with anti-RON antibodies to estimate the amount of RON in precipitates (upper band, RON precursor; lower band, mature RON). Arrows on the right represent MSP band and the immunoglobulin G heavy chains band (IgH). Molecular mass markers is indicated on the right (in kDa). The optical density measurement of MSP bands in three independent experiments revealed approximately a 3-fold decrease of the amount of MSP co-immunoprecipitated with RON. B, the effect of medium containing ron-sema on the binding of recombinant (disulfide-linked α-β-chains) MSP or free α- and free β-chain to recombinant full-length RON adsorbed to the wells of a microtiter plate. ron-sema caused 50 and 63% inhibition of 0.05 nm β-chain and α-β-MSP binding to RON respectively, and up to 90% inhibition of 5 nm free α-chain binding to RON. Binding was determined by ELISA (see “Experimental Procedures”). Similar results were obtained with conditioned medium containing ron-PSI (data not shown). The data are presented as dose-response curves for the three ligands, each point being the amount of ligand bound in the presence of ron-sema, expressed as a percentage of the amount bound in the absence of ron-sema. Each value represents the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)MSP is a heterodimer comprised of α- and β-chains linked by a disulfide bond. Two binding sites for RON have been identified in MSP. MSP β-chain contains the high affinity binding site (29Wang M.H. Julian F.M. Breathnach R. Godowski P.J. Takehara T. Yoshikawa W. Hagiya M. Leonard E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16999-17004Google Scholar), whereas the α-chain contains a second low affinity receptor-binding site (30Miller M. Leonard E.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 1-3Google Scholar). Neither α- nor β-chain of MSP alone induces RON tyrosine phosphorylation and activation, indicating that both binding sites of MSP are required for biological activity (29Wang M.H. Julian F.M. Breathnach R. Godowski P.J. Takehara T. Yoshikawa W. Hagiya M. Leonard E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16999-17004Google Scholar).We used a competitive ELISA to investigate the effect of soluble ron-sema on the binding of recombinant disulfide-linked α-β-heterodimeric MSP and free α- and β-chains of MSP to recombinant RON receptor adsorbed to an ELISA plate (Fig. 2B). The binding of recombinant disulfide-linked α-β-MSP, free α-chain, and free β-chain to recombinant ron receptor is inhibited by the presence of ron-sema in the reaction mixture (Fig. 2B).The Soluble Molecules ron-sema and ron-PSI Inhibit MSP-induced Signaling and Cell Growth—Our finding that ron-sema (Fig. 2B) and ron-PSI (data not shown) inhibits MSP-binding to RON suggested that these soluble molecules might inhibit MSP-induced RON activation via competition for MSP binding. To investigate whether the soluble molecules ron-sema and ron-PSI may functionally interfere with the activity of the full-length receptor, we stimulated RON-expressing RE7 cells (26Wang M.H. Ronsin C. Gesnel M.C. Coupey L. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. Breathnach R. Science. 1994; 266: 117-119Google Scholar) with MSP in a culture medium containing either molecule (or none as a control). The RON receptor was then immunoprecipitated from these cell lysates with anti-RON antibodies and a Western blot performed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. The result shows a greatly reduced level of phosphorylation of the receptor immunoprecipitated from cells exposed to a conditioned culture medium containing ron-sema or ron-PSI molecules compared with the control (Fig. 3A).Fig. 3Supernatants containing ron-sema and ron-PSI inhibit MSP-induced RON signaling and cell growth.A, tyrosine phosphorylation of RON induced by MSP. RE7 cells were stimulated with 5 nm MSP for 15 min in the presence of blank or conditioned culture medium containing ron-sema or ron-PSI-soluble molecules. Cells were then lysed, and the RON receptor immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with anti-RON antibodies. RON tyrosine phosphorylation was detected by Western blotting (WB) with anti-phosphotyrosine (PY) antibodies (upper panel). Lower panel, reblotting with anti-RON antibodies to estimate the amount of RON protein in precipitates (upper band, RON precursor; lower band, mature RON). Molecular mass markers are indicated on the right (in kDa). B, MAPK activation induced by MSP. RE7 cells were stimulated with MSP as described above. Activation of MAPK was determined in cell lysates with anti-phospho-MAPK antibodies (upper panel). The amount of MAPK (lower panel, p42 and p44 ERK1/ERK2) was estimated by reprobing the membrane with anti-MAPK antibodies. Molecular mass markers are indicated in kDa to the right. C, cell proliferation induced by MSP. RE7 cells (2 × 103/well) were distributed in triplicate in 96-well plate and incubated with or without 5 nm MSP in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence of blank medium or conditioned medium containing either ron-sema or ron-PSI-soluble molecules. Cell number was measured after 72 h of cell culturing by adding MTT to culture wells and measuring A570 2 h later. The number of cells was determined with a standard calibration curve. Error bars, means + S.E. for three independent experiments. The inhibitory effect of ron-sema on RON and MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 3, A and B) seems stronger that its effect on cell proliferation (Fig. 3C) and vice versa for ron-PSI. This difference could be because of the different duration of the biochemical (15 min) and proliferation studies (3 days). In these conditions, it is likely that the relative stability of soluble ron-sema and ron-PSI are different and certainly affected by the cell type-specific proteases secreted in the culture medium (compare Figs. 3C and 4B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Ligand-induced RON-tyrosine phosphorylation is a key event leading to up-regulation of RON catalytic activity and consequent activation of intracellular signaling pathways that mediate the biological effects of MSP (31Wang M.H. Yoshimura T. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3436-3440Google Scholar). A decrease in RON tyrosine phosphorylation by soluble ron-sema or ron-PSI molecules resulted in the inhibition of RON-dependent signaling pathways.In RE7 cells exposed to non-conditioned medium, MSP induces a strong phosphorylation of MAPK (Fig. 3B), a kinase known to be part of signaling pathways that control MSP-dependent cell proliferation (reviewed in Refs. 32Danilkovitch-Miagkova A. Leonard E.J. Apoptosis. 2001; 6: 183-190Google Scholar, 33Santoro M.M. Penengo L. Minetto M. Orecchia S. Cilli M. Gaudino G. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 741-749Google Scholar, 34Santoro M.M. Collesi C. Grisendi S. Gaudino G. Comoglio P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7072-7083Google Scholar). When RE7 cells are exposed to ron-sema or ron-PSI, the level of MSP-induced MAPK phosphorylation is strongly reduced (Fig. 3B). This inhibiting effect on MAPK phosphorylation translates directly into cell proliferation inhibition. A growth rate experiment was performed on RON-transfected cells stimulated with MSP. Under the experimental conditions described, MSP has a strong mitogenic effect that is greatly reduced in the presence of soluble ron-sema and ron-PSI with ron-PSI causing a 3-fold reduction of growth compared with the control (Fig. 3C). These results show that the secreted soluble molecules designed over the sema and sema + PSI domains of RON are capable of inhibiting RON phosphorylation and therefore activation induced by MSP.MSP-induced RON activation in tumor cells including breast carcinoma-derived ZR75.1 cell line, colon cancer cell line HCT116, and lung carcinomas correlates with cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (14Willett C.G.

Following the observation of a relatively short distance between a carboxyl oxygen of Asp207 and the Nδ1(His235) in a 1.1 Å crystal structure of HbHNL, we here show by 1H and 15N-NMR spectroscopy that a short, strong hydrogen bond (SSHB) is formed between the two residues upon binding of the competitive inhibitor thiocyanate to HbHNL: the proton resonance of H-Nδ1(His235) moves from 15.41 ppm in the free enzyme to 19.35 ppm in the complex, the largest downfield shift observed so far upon inhibitor binding. Simultaneously, the D/H fractionation factor decreases from 0.98 to 0.35. In the observable pH range, i.e. between pH 4 and 10, no significant changes in chemical shifts (and therefore hydrogen bond strength) were observed for free HbHNL. For the complex with thiocyanate, the 19.35 ppm signal returned to 15.41 ppm at ∼pH 8, which indicates a pKa near this value for the H-Nϵ2(His235). These NMR results were analyzed on the basis of finite difference Poisson-Boltzmann calculations, which yielded the relative free energies of four protonation states of the His235-Asp207 pair in solution as well as in the protein environment with and without bound inhibitor. The calculations explain all the NMR features, i.e. they suggest why a short, strong hydrogen bond is formed upon inhibitor binding and why this short, strong hydrogen bond reverts back to a normal one at ∼pH 8. Importantly, the computations also yield a shift of the free energy of the anionic state relative to the zwitterionic reference state by about 10.6 kcal/mol, equivalent to a shift in the apparent pKa of His235 from 2.5 to 10. This huge inhibitor-induced increase in basicity is a prerequisite for His235 to act as general base in the HbHNL-catalyzed cyanohydrin reaction.

Short, strong hydrogen bonds (SSHBs) 1The abbreviations used are: SSHBshort, strong hydrogen bondLBHBlow-barrier hydrogen bondHNLhydroxynitril lyaseHbHNLHNL from Hevea brasiliensisNMRnuclear magnetic resonanceFDPBfinite difference Poisson-Boltzmann. occur when the pKa of a hydrogen-bonded donor matches the one of the acceptor. If the hydrogen bond is sufficiently short, the central maximum of the (more or less symmetrical) hydrogen atom potential along the line connecting donor and acceptor may fall below the vibrational groundstate, resulting in a delocalized hydrogen atom. This situation is then referred to as a “low-barrier hydrogen bond” (LBHB). 2The terms “short, strong hydrogen bond” and “low-barrier hydrogen bond” are being used almost synonymously in the literature. Low-barrier hydrogen bonds may occur in solutions and crystals of organic and inorganic compounds (1Perrin C.L. Nielson J.B. Ann. Rev. Phys. Chem. 1997; 48: 511-544Google Scholar). Their observation in the active sites of enzymes (2Cleland W.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 317-319Google Scholar, 3Frey P.A. Whitt S.A. Tobin J.B.

Science. 1994; 264: 1887-1890Google Scholar) has led to controversy concerning their significance for the mechanism of enzyme catalysis (2Cleland W.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 317-319Google Scholar, 3Frey P.A. Whitt S.A. Tobin J.B. Science. 1994; 264: 1927-1930Google Scholar, 4Cleland W.W. Kreevoy M.M.

It has been suggested that the energy gained by the transient conversion of a “normal” hydrogen bond into a short, strong hydrogen bond can be used to stabilize transition states of enzymatic reactions (2Cleland W.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 317-319Google Scholar, 3Frey P.A. Whitt S.A. Tobin J.B. Science. 1994; 264: 1927-1930Google Scholar, 4Cleland W.W. Kreevoy M.M.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4576-4584Google Scholar, 7Cleland W.W. Kreevoy M.M. Science. 1995; 269: 102-106Google Scholar). However, this energy gain (12Scheiner S. Kar T. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 6970-6975Google Scholar) and its relevance for enzyme catalysis did not remain undisputed (8Warshel A. Papazyan A. Kollman P.A. Science. 1995; 269: 102-106Google Scholar, 9Warshel A. Papazyan A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13665-13670Google Scholar, 10Ash E.L. Sudmeier J.L. De Fabo E.C. Bachovchin W.W. Science. 1997; 278: 1128-1132Google Scholar, 11Shan S.O. Loh S. Herschlag D. Science. 1996; 272: 97-101Google Scholar). There are indeed enzymes where a LBHB was observed that was shown not to be an inherent requirement for substantial rate enhancement (13Stratton J.R. Pelton J.G. Kirsch J.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10411-10416Google Scholar). Irrespective of their energetic relevance, low-barrier hydrogen bonds are useful diagnostic tools to indicate the matching pKas of a hydrogen bonded donor-acceptor pair, which was used to rationalize enzymic mechanisms (14Northrop D.B. Acc. Chem. Res. 2001; 34: 790-797Google Scholar). short, strong hydrogen bond low-barrier hydrogen bond hydroxynitril lyase HNL from Hevea brasiliensis nuclear magnetic resonance finite difference Poisson-Boltzmann. The occurrence of SSHBs has so far been reported for a considerable number of enzymes, including ketosteroid isomerase (15Zhao Q. Abeygunawardana C. Talalay P. Mildvan A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8220-8224Google Scholar, 16Zhao Q. Abeygunawardana C. Gittis A.G. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14616-14626Google Scholar, 17Ha N.C. Kim M.S. Lee W. Choi K.Y. Oh B.H. J. Biol.

Whitt S.A. Tobin J.B. Science. 1994; 264: 1927-1930Google Scholar, 6Cassidy C.S. Lin J. Frey P.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4576-4584Google Scholar, 19Kahyaoglu A. Haghjoo K. Guo F. Jordan F.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7378-7386Google Scholar), 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate-CoA ligase (21Tong H. Davis L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3362-3367Google Scholar), and cholinesterases (22Massiah M.A. Viragh C.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16200-16205Google Scholar). Their occurrence has typically been suggested by NMR spectroscopy (24Mildvan A.S. Harris T.K. Abeygunawardana C. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 308: 219-245Google Scholar, 25Lin J. Westler W.M. Cleland W.W. Markley J.L. Frey P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14664-14668Google Scholar). The exposure of the delocalized proton decreases the electron density around the proton nucleus, which shifts the NMR signal to very low field (higher frequency; typically 18-22 ppm (26Cleland W.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 382: 1-5Google Scholar)). Another NMR-observable quantity used to identify a short, strong hydrogen bond is the fractionation factor ϕ for the associated proton, defined as the equilibrium constant for the exchange of hydrogen by deuterium with the solvent (27Schowen K.B. Schowen R.L. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 551-606Google Scholar). ϕ depends on the relative strength of a hydrogen bond compared with the solvent, with values lower than 1 indicating stronger hydrogen bonds (24Mildvan A.S. Harris T.K. Abeygunawardana C. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 308: 219-245Google Scholar). Hydroxynitrile lyase (HNL) (EC 4.1.2.39) catalyzes the cleavage of cyanohydrins to hydrocyanic acid plus the corresponding aldehyde or ketone (Fig. 1A). The release of HCN serves as a defense against herbivores and microbial attack for a variety of plants (28Conn E.E. Stumpf P.K. Conn E.E. The Biochemistry of Plants: A Comprehensive Treatise. Vol. 7. Academic Press, New York1981: 479-500Google Scholar, 29Hickel A. Hasslacher M. Griengl H. Physiologia Plantarum. 1996; 98: 891-898Google Scholar, 30Wajant H. Effenberger F. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 611-617Google Scholar). In aqueous solution, cyanohydrin cleavage occurs spontaneously above pH 5, whereas the enzyme reaction also occurs at lower pH values (down to ∼pH 3; Ref. 29Hickel A. Hasslacher M. Griengl H. Physiologia Plantarum. 1996; 98: 891-898Google Scholar). This is technologically exploited for the enantioselective synthesis of chiral cyanohydrins (31Griengl H. Hickel A. Johnson D.V. Kratky C. Schmidt M. Schwab H. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1997; : 1933-1940Google Scholar, 32Klempier N. Griengl H. Hayn M. Tetrahedron Lett. 1993; 34: 4769-4772Google Scholar, 33Klempier N. Pichler U. Griengl H. Tetrahedron Asymmetry. 1995; 6: 845-848Google Scholar, 34Effenberger F. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1994; 33: 1555-1564Google Scholar, 35Kruse C.G. Collins A.N. Sheldrake G.N. Crosby J. Chirality in Industry. John Wiley and Sons Ltd., Chichester, UK1992: 279-299Google Scholar), making use of the reverse in vivo reaction. Structurally, the HNL from the tropical rubber tree Hevea brasiliensis (HbHNL) belongs to the α/β-hydrolase superfamily (36Wagner U.G. Hasslacher M. Griengl H. Schwab H. Kratky C. Structure. 1996; 4: 811-822Google Scholar) and has a prototypical catalytic triad consisting of residues Asp207, His235, and Ser80. However, the environment of this triad differs from other hydrolases. Based on a series of crystal structures of HbHNL with various substrates and inhibitors (37Zuegg J. Gruber K. Gugganig M. Wagner U.G. Kratky C. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1990-2000Google Scholar) in combination with modeling studies (38Gruber K. Poteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2001; 44: 26-31Google Scholar) and kinetic data (39Bauer M. Griengl H. Steiner W. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1999; 62: 20-29Google Scholar) a general acid/base reaction mechanism (Fig. 1B) was proposed. Key elements of this mechanism are (for the cyanohydrin cleavage direction) deprotonation of the OH-Ser80 by His235 and concomitant abstraction of a proton from the substrate hydroxyl by Ser80. The subsequent cleavage of the cyanohydrin is facilitated by the stabilization of the charge of the nascent cyanide through interaction with the positive charge of Lys236. A very similar mechanism devoid of a catalytic role for the active site lysine has been proposed independently for the similar and highly homologous HNL from Manihot esculenta (40Lauble H. Forster S. Miehlich B. Wajant H. Effenberger F. Acta Crystallogr. 2001; D57: 194-200Google Scholar, 41Lauble H. Miehlich B. Forster S. Wajant H. Effenberger F. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1015-1022Google Scholar). Irrespective of these differences, the question about the pKa of the catalytic base in the protein interior (42Harris T.K. Turner G.J. IUBMB Life. 2002; 53: 85-98Google Scholar) and its modulation during the enzyme-catalyzed reaction (17Ha N.C. Kim M.S. Lee W. Choi K.Y. Oh B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41100-41106Google Scholar) remained open. Thus, despite its similar three-dimensional fold, the reaction mechanism of this type of HNLs differs fundamentally from that of other α/β hydrolases, as it constitutes one of the rare examples where the triad does not act as a nucleophile. To obtain evidence about the protonation states in the active site, the HbHNL structure was refined against diffraction data collected to very high (1.1 Å) resolution (43Gruber K. Gugganig M. Wagner U.G. Kratky C. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 993-1000Google Scholar). The refinement yielded a rather short distance between the two residues of the catalytic triad (2.67 Å between Nδ(His235) and Oϵ(Asp207)). Difference density indicated a proton attached to Nδ(His235), with no density near Nϵ(His235)orOϵ(Asp207). Thus, the proton between His235 and Asp207 did not appear to be shared among the two heteroatoms, as it was observed in some other hydrolases (44Kuhn P. Knapp M. Soltis S.M. Ganshaw G. Thoene M. Bott R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13446-13452Google Scholar). Here we report NMR experiments that show that this “catalytic” hydrogen bond converts into a short, strong hydrogen bond upon addition of a strong competitive inhibitor mimicking the rate-limiting transition state of the enzyme reaction. To rationalize this NMR result, we performed Poisson-Boltzmann computations, which yield a consistent explanation for the occurrence of the SSHB. In fact, the results of the computations show how the occurrence of the SSHB is paralleled by a catalytically relevant increase in basicity of the general base upon approach of the transition state. Materials—Crude natural abundance HbHNL was obtained by Roche Applied Science in a 20 mm citrate phosphate buffer pH 6.5 (5300 units/ml and 59 mg/ml) and purified as reported (45Hasslacher M. Schall M. Hayn M. Bona R. Rumbold K. Luckl J. Griengl H. Kohlwein S.D. Schwab H. Protein Expr. Purif. 1997; 11: 61-71Google Scholar). For NMR measurements the protein was dialyzed against 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. For the isotopically labeled protein, 15N-ammonium sulfate, 13C-glycerol (Martek, Columbia, MD), and 13C-methanol (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA) were used for the minimal medium. Anhydrous potassium thiocyanate (KSCN), acetone, benzaldehyde, mandelonitrile, HCl, sodium hydroxide, and deuterium oxide (D2O, 99.8% at % D) were purchased from Merck. All solvents and reagents were analytical or reagent grade and were used without further purification. Enzyme Preparation—Wild-type HbHNL was labeled with 15N or 15N and 13C by expression from the Pichia pastoris strain 2386 GS115 H+M- pHILD1.17-HNL (Technical University Graz) in a minimal medium that has been slightly modified from the published fermentation procedure (45Hasslacher M. Schall M. Hayn M. Bona R. Rumbold K. Luckl J. Griengl H. Kohlwein S.D. Schwab H. Protein Expr. Purif. 1997; 11: 61-71Google Scholar). Instead of a bioreactor, shake flasks containing 0.4 m KH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 5, 0.1 g (15NH4)2SO4 per 200 ml minimal medium were used. In addition, the concentrations of trace elements were lower by a factor of four. The protein was purified by anion exchange (HiTrap Q HP, Amersham Biosciences) and gel filtration chromatography (Superdex200, Amersham Biosciences) as reported previously (45Hasslacher M. Schall M. Hayn M. Bona R. Rumbold K. Luckl J. Griengl H. Kohlwein S.D. Schwab H. Protein Expr. Purif. 1997; 11: 61-71Google Scholar). All samples were >95% pure based on SDS-PAGE analysis. Protein concentration was determined by the BCA assay (Bio-Rad). The 15N HbHNL sample was concentrated to 10 mg/ml (activity = 200 units/ml) and the 15N/13C double labeled HbHNL to 19 mg/ml with an activity of 321 units/ml. Hydroxynitrile Lyase Activity Test—Enzyme activity (39Bauer M. Griengl H. Steiner W. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1999; 62: 20-29Google Scholar) was measured following the cleavage of racemic mandelonitrile into benzaldehyde and HCN, at a substrate concentration of 12 mm and at an enzyme concentration of about 0.74 μg/ml. The assay was performed in 20 mm glutamate buffer at pH 5 and 25 °C, and the formation of benzaldehyde was monitored spectrophotometrically at 280 nm. In addition to the enzymatic reaction the base-catalyzed chemical reaction has to be measured separately and subtracted. The reaction was monitored for 2 min, and the enzyme activity was calculated from the slope in a plot of ΔE versus time. NMR Sample Preparation—For all measurements 600 μl of between 0.33 and 0.63 mm HNL in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 90:10% H2O/D2O were used. In the titrations with acetone, benzaldehyde, and thiocyanate, concentrations of 1-50 mm, 1-6 mm, and 0.2-1 mm were used, respectively. For the determination of the fractionation factors we used H2O/D2O buffer mixtures of 550:50 μl, 420:180 μl, 300:300 μl and 180:420 μl. The pH value was changed within the range pH 4-10 for the acid/base titrations. Starting from a sample with pH 7.01, titration involved steps of 3 to 5 μl of 0.1 m HCl or NaOH. The pH in the 5 mm NMR sample tube was monitored using an Orion Model 9803 NMR pH electrode. NMR Experiments—All one-dimensional 1H-NMR spectra were collected on a Bruker Avance DRX 500 MHz NMR spectrometer, where the water signal was suppressed using the WATERGATE sequence (46Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Google Scholar). Due to the fast relaxation of the protein signals, at least 1024 scans had to be acquired for each one-dimensional spectrum consisting of 16,000 data points. A 60° phase-shifted squared sine-bell window function was applied prior to Fourier transformation. The 1H-15N HSQC was acquired on a Varian Unity INOVA 600 MHz spectrometer with a 5 mm HCN triple resonance probe at 27 °C. For each of the 128 increments, 64 transients of 1000 complex points were accumulated and the data set zero filled to a final size of 2048 × 512 complex data points. In both dimensions 60° phase-shifted squared sine-bell window functions were used. To achieve maximum intensity for the signal belonging to the proton in the SSHB the carrier frequencies were shifted to 15.41 and 190 ppm for the 1H and 15N dimension, respectively. For the measurement of the fractionation factors of the deshielded proton resonances in free HbHNL and in the HbHNL·SCN- complex, the enzyme was dissolved in mixtures of protonated and deuterated water with the above H2O/D2O ratios. We started with the mixture containing the lowest D2O concentration, lyophilized it and resuspended it with the next mixture of H2O/D2O. The sample was equilibrated for 2 h at room temperature to allow complete exchange of the deshielded proton before the next spectrum was recorded. Each sample was measured twice and the signal intensities were averaged. A high field-shifted methyl signal was used as an internal standard to calibrate the signal intensities to compensate for the loss of enzyme during lyophilization and re-dissolution. The fractionation factor ϕ is defined as the equilibrium constant of the reaction (27Schowen K.B. Schowen R.L. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 551-606Google Scholar) as seen in the Equation 1 as follows.En-H+Daq⇌En-D+Haqϕ=[En-D][Haq][En-H][Daq](Eq. 1) By substituting the concentration of En - H with the directly proportional signal intensity I and expressing the [Haq]/[Daq] ratio with X, the mole fraction of Haq in the used H2O/D2O mixture, this equation can be rearranged as shown in Equation 2.I=Imax*Xϕ*(1-X)+X(Eq. 2) Here, Imax is the maximal peak intensity at X = 1.00 (24Mildvan A.S. Harris T.K. Abeygunawardana C. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 308: 219-245Google Scholar). The fractionation factor ϕ was calculated from the slope of a straight line obtained by least squares fitting the reciprocal measured signal intensities (1/I) as a function (1 - X)/X in the linearized form of Equation 2 as follows.1I=ϕImax(1-XX)+1Imax(Eq. 3) Calculation of Electrostatic Interactions—Electrostatic interaction and solvation-free energies were calculated using the finite-difference-Poisson-Boltzmann (FDPB) method as implemented in the program DelPhi (47Nicholls A. Honig B. J. Comput. Chem. 1991; 12: 435-445Google Scholar). The two values for the bulk dielectric constant were set to 4.0 (protein) and 80.0 (solvent), and an ionic strength of 0.145 m was assumed throughout. The scale of the grid was 2 Å-1. The ion exclusion radius was set to 2 Å and the probe radius (for surface calculations) to 1.4 Å. All calculations were performed with the eight structures of HbHNL currently available in the Protein Data Bank (codes: 1qj4, 1yas, 2yas, 3yas, 4yas, 5yas, 6yas, and 7yas) (36Wagner U.G. Hasslacher M. Griengl H. Schwab H. Kratky C. Structure. 1996; 4: 811-822Google Scholar, 37Zuegg J. Gruber K. Gugganig M. Wagner U.G. Kratky C. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1990-2000Google Scholar, 43Gruber K. Gugganig M. Wagner U.G. Kratky C. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 993-1000Google Scholar), and the resulting energy values were averaged. Water molecules and ligand atoms present in the structures were removed. In the case of alternate conformations, the higher occupied conformer was kept. Aspartate (except Asp207), glutamate, arginine, and lysine side-chains were modeled as charged. Tautomers and protonation states of histidine residues (except His235) were assigned by inspection. A special situation was encountered for the cationic pair, in which the aspartate is neutral but still acts as hydrogen bond acceptor. For the protein-bound pair, on either of the two carboxyl oxygen a proton would not find a suitable hydrogen bond acceptor, but possibly lead to unacceptable interactions with the protein (main-chain amide nitrogen atoms of Ile209 and Phe210; side-chain of Asn104). Neutralization of the Asp207 side-chain was therefore accomplished by modifying the charges only, without the addition of a hydrogen atom. For the FDPB-calculations in water, the entire amino acids for His235 and Asp207 were used in a conformation as observed in the respective HbHNL crystal structure (36Wagner U.G. Hasslacher M. Griengl H. Schwab H. Kratky C. Structure. 1996; 4: 811-822Google Scholar, 37Zuegg J. Gruber K. Gugganig M. Wagner U.G. Kratky C. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1990-2000Google Scholar, 43Gruber K. Gugganig M. Wagner U.G. Kratky C. Biol.

Observation of a Downfield-shifted 1H-NMR Signal—The observation of a short distance (2.67 Å) between Oϵ(Asp207) and Nδ1(His235) in the high-resolution crystal structure of HbHNL (43Gruber K. Gugganig M. Wagner U.G. Kratky C. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 993-1000Google Scholar) indicated the possibility for a short, strong hydrogen bond in the active site of this enzyme. A 1H-NMR spectrum was acquired between -3 to 22 ppm, and a signal was indeed observed at 15.41 ppm (Fig. 2). Because the large molecular size (60 kDa) of this homodimeric (48Hanefeld U. Stranzl G. Straathof A.J.J. Heijnen J.J. Bergmann A. Mittelbach R. Glatter O. Kratky C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1544: 133-142Google Scholar) protein prohibited a complete sequential NMR assignment, we had to resort to indirect ways to corroborate the assignment of the observed signal at 15.41 ppm to the proton attached to Nδ1(His235). Signal Assignment—The following empirical correlation between proton chemical shifts and hydrogen bond lengths in imidazolium·carboxylate complexes (23Viragh C. Harris T.K. Reddy P.M. Massiah M.A. Mildvan A.S. Kovach I.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16200-16205Google Scholar) is as followsD=1.99+0.198ln(δ)+(10.14/δ)5(Eq. 4) was used to deduce a heteroatom separation from the observed chemical shift and compare it with the crystallographically observed value for the Nδ1(His235)—Oϵ(Asp207) distance. The distance D obtained from the proton chemical shift δ = 15.41 ppm is 2.65 Å, in good agreement with the crystallographically observed (43Gruber K. Gugganig M. Wagner U.G. Kratky C. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 993-1000Google Scholar) distance of 2.67 Å. To ensure that the downfield signal belongs to a proton attached to a nitrogen nucleus, a 1H-15N-HSQC was acquired on a sample of 0.33 mm15N-isotopically enriched HbHNL. The proton and nitrogen carriers were placed at 15.41 and 190 ppm, respectively, to optimize the signal intensities in the region of the 15.41 ppm signal. The resulting two-dimensional spectrum is shown in Fig. 3, where the signal at 15.41 and 180.08 ppm is clearly visible. Attempts to correlate this signal to a nearby 13C nucleus in 15N, 13C doubly labeled HbHNL in a two-dimensional H-(N)-C correlation experiment (49Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy. San Diego, CA1996: 478-517Google Scholar) were unsuccessful, presumably due to the fast relaxation within this large protein and to the relatively small 1JNC coupling constants within histidine side-chains (50Blomberg F. Maurer W. Ruterjans H. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1977; 99: 1849-1859Google Scholar). The assignment of the 15.41 ppm signal was further confirmed by determining the shift induced by the presence of benzaldehyde in the active side. The crystal structure of HbHNL complexed with benzaldehyde has not yet been reported, but modeling studies (38Gruber K. Poteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2001; 44: 26-31Google Scholar) yield a stable solution which shows the aromatic ring 7.1 Å away from the H-Nδ(His235), as shown in Fig. 4A. This orientation was used to calculate (program SHIFTS (51Xu X.P. Case D.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 21: 321-333Google Scholar)) the change in chemical shift of the proton attached to Nδ(His235) induced by the ring current of benzaldehyde. The computed shift of -0.13 ppm compares well with the experimentally observed shift of the proton signal from 15.41 ppm to 15.22 ppm upon titrating 6 mm benzaldehyde into a solution of 0.6 mmHbHNL (Fig. 2C). In a control experiment, acetone was titrated into a solution of 0.6 mmHbHNL up to a concentration of 50 mm, which did not cause any shift of the downfield signal (data not shown). The Effect of the inhibitor Thiocyanate and of the Substrate Mandelonitrile—Although a chemical shift of 15.41 ppm for a H-Nδ(His) is clearly outside the “regular” range (10.1 ± 3.5 ppm, BioMagResBank, www.bmrb.wisc.edu (52Seavey B.R. Farr E.A. Westler W.M. Markley J.L. J. Biomol. NMR. 1991; 1: 217-236Google Scholar)), it is not yet a low barrier hydrogen bond, whose 1H-NMR signal is expected between 18-22 ppm (26Cleland W.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 382: 1-5Google Scholar). Because short, strong hydrogen bonds are often observed in protein conformations mimicking a transition state, we also titrated the strong inhibitor thiocyanate (Ki = 5.5 μm (37Zuegg J. Gruber K. Gugganig M. Wagner U.G. Kratky C. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1990-2000Google Scholar, 53Schall M. Isolation and Characterization of a (S)-Hydroxynitrile Lyase from Hevea brasiliensis. Karl Franzens Universität, Graz, Austria1996Google Scholar)) into a solution of 0.5 mmHbHNL. Upon addition of thiocyanate, the signal at 15.41 ppm disappears and a new signal appears at 19.31 ppm (Fig. 5), i.e. at a value characteristic for low barrier hydrogen bonds. A different behavior is observed when adding mandelonitrile, one of the substrates of HbHNL (Km = 3 mm (39Bauer M. Griengl H. Steiner W. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1999; 62: 20-29Google Scholar)). Upon titration of 0.1-3 mm mandelonitrile into a solution of 0.5 mmHbHNL, the signal at 15.41 ppm disappears and no signal beyond 13 ppm is observable. We assume that the dynamics of the HNL reaction prohibit the observation of H-Nδ1(His235), whose resonance shifts to several different positions during one reaction cycle. Hydrogen-Deuterium Fractionation Factors—We have determined the fractionation factors of unliganded HbHNL and of HbHNL complexed with SCN- by monitoring the intensities of the downfield-shifted signal in varying ratios of D2O/H2O. The reciprocal normalized intensities 1/I plotted versus (1 - X)/X are shown in Fig. 6 for H"

PheGlcIm binds to the barley β-d-glucan glucohydrolase ∼2 × 105 times tighter than laminarin, which is the best non-synthetic ground-state substrate found so far for this enzyme, 106 times tighter than 4-nitrophenyl β-d-glucopyranoside, and 2 × 107 tighter than glucose. The three-dimensional structure of the β-d-glucan glucohydrolase with bound PheGlcIm indicates that the complex resembles a hypothetical transition state during the hydrolytic cycle, that the enzyme derives substrate binding energy from the “aglycone” portion of the ligand, and that it also reveals an anti-protonation trajectory for hydrolysis. Continuous electron densities at the 1.6 σ level form between the three active site residues Asp95, His207, and Asp285, and the C6OH, C7OH, C8OH, and C9OH groups of PheGlcIm. These electron densities correspond to the most favorable interactions in the three-dimensional structure of the β-d-glucan glucohydrolase-PheGlcIm complex and indicate atomic distances equal to or less than 2.55 Å. The crystallographic data were corroborated with ab initio molecular orbital calculations. The data indicate that the 4E conformation of the glucose part of PheGlcIm is critical for tight binding and provide the first evidence for probable substrate distortion during catalysis by this enzyme.

The enzymic transformation of a substrate into product by glucoside hydrolases proceeds through a series of intermediates and oxocarbenium (cation) ion-like transition states and is mediated via distortion/relaxation cycles of a ground-state low energy 4C1 chair conformation of the substrate (1White A.

In our previous crystallographic work we used conduritol B epoxide, 2,4-dinitrophenyl 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-β-d-glucopyranoside (2F-DNPGlc) and 4I, 4III, 4V-S-trithiocellohexaose to identify catalytic amino acid residues and to define three key intermediates in the catalytic sequence (9Hrmova M.

The glucose product of the reaction does not immediately diffuse away from the enzyme surface, but instead remains bound at subsite -1. It is likely that this bound glucose is displaced from the active site by the incoming substrate during the first stage of the next hydrolytic event (9Hrmova M. Varghese J.N. De Gori R. Smith B.J. Driguez H. Fincher G.B. Structure. 2001; 9: 1005-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 10Hrmova M. De Gori R. Smith B.J. Fairweather J.K. Driguez H. Varghese J.N. Fincher G.B. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The second stage of the hydrolytic pathway involves C1-O glycosidic bond cleavage, which proceeds through a double displacement. The crystallographic analysis of a S-cellobiosyl-enzyme complex, supported by quantum mechanical modeling, suggested that the S-cellobiosyl-enzyme complex mimics an oxonium intermediate, rather than the enzyme-substrate complex (9Hrmova M. Varghese J.N. De Gori R. Smith B.J. Driguez H. Fincher G.B. Structure. 2001; 9: 1005-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that formation of a stable oxonium intermediate inhibits distortion of a glycosyl ring (11Smith B.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 2699-2706Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar).The data obtained in our previous work with the β-d-glucan glucohydrolase indicated that no significant distortion occurred either in the enzyme-product complex or in the covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate (9Hrmova M.

Fairweather J.K. Driguez H. Varghese J.N. Fincher G.B. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Similarly, no significant distortions could be detected in sugar conformations at subsites -1 or +1 of the S-glycosyl-enzyme complexes (9Hrmova M. Varghese J.N. De Gori R. Smith B.J. Driguez H. Fincher G.B. Structure. 2001; 9: 1005-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 10Hrmova M. De Gori R. Smith B.J. Fairweather J.K. Driguez H. Varghese J.N. Fincher G.B. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, crystallographic analyses of several other endo-acting glycoside hydrolases in complex with sugars indicate distortions of the glycosyl residue that is bound at the -1 subsite. It is also assumed that distortion during oxocarbenium ion-like transition state formation is a necessary part of catalysis (3Vasella A. Davies G.J. Böhm M. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 619-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar).To further investigate intermediates and to test whether ring distortions play a role during catalysis of the barley β-d-glucan glucohydrolase, the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme in complex with glucophenylimidazole (PheGlcIm) has now been solved. PheGlcIm is a representative of the glucoimidazoles (GlcIm), which are excellent chemical tools for studying three-dimensional structures that mimic transition states. For example, PheGlcIm is a nagstatin-type mimic of the reactive intermediate that can be isolated from culture filtrates of Streptomyces amakusaensis (12Aoyama T. Naganawa H. Suda H. Uotani T. Aoyagi T. Takeuchi T. J. Antibiot. 1992; 45: 1557-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), or prepared synthetically; nagstatin is an inhibitor of N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase (13Tatsuta K. Miura S. Ohta S. Gunji H. J. Antibiot. 1995; 48: 286-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). PheGlcIm has a trigonal anomeric center attached to an exocyclic N atom, which corresponds to the “glycosidic heteroatom,” and an endocyclic N atom of the tetrahydropyridine moiety. PheGlcIm possesses a conformation similar to that of gluconojiritetrazole, which in solid state or in D2O adopts a 4H3 conformation that is similar to 4E (14Ermert P. Vasella A. Weber M. Rupitz K. Withers S.G. Carbohydr. Res. 1993; 250: 113-128Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 15Heightman T.D. Vasella A.T. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1999; 38: 750-770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tetrahydroimidazopyridine-type inhibitors do not contain syn lone pair electrons at the “anomeric” N atom, but possess an anti-oriented, doubly occupied, non-bonding orbital at this heteroatom and are therefore suited as inhibitors of anti-protonating glycoside hydrolases (15Heightman T.D.

Fairweather J.K. Driguez H. Varghese J.N. Fincher G.B. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and the structure of PheGlcIm suggested that the inhibitor might be a useful mechanistic probe for the investigation of the enzyme-bound reactive intermediate and thus the transition state. It was expected that the tetrahydroimidazopyridine moiety and the phenyl ring would be located at the -1 and +1 subsites, respectively. The primary objectives of the present work were to analyze binding interactions of PheGlcIm in the active site of the barley β-d-glucan glucohydrolase by x-ray crystallography, to define the structure of a possible transition state complex, and to reconcile these findings with quantum mechanical modeling.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The glucose diagnostic kit, 4-nitrophenyl β-d-glucopyranoside (4NPGlc), gluconolactone, castanospermine, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.

The kcatKm-1versus pH profile was calculated from time-course curves at low 4NPGlc concentration (0.17 mm and 1/9 Km). Division of the pseudo-first-order rate constants by the enzyme concentration produced the final kcatKm-1 values (22Vocadlo D.J. Wicki J. Rupitz K. Withers S.G.

The Ki values at each pH were estimated using concentrations of inhibitor that were 0.4-3 times the Ki and concentrations of 4NPGlc substrate that were 0.5-1 times the Km constant. Dixon plots were used to determine the final Ki value at each pH. Substrate hydrolysis during both types of measurements never exceeded 10% of the initial substrate concentrations.

After ∼2 h at 4 ± 2 °C, the crystal was transferred into solution A with 11% (v/v) glycerol as a cryo-protectant. The crystal was subsequently mounted on a goniometer and flash-frozen to 100 K in a stream of nitrogen gas (Oxford Instruments, Oxford, England). Data were collected to 2.62-Å resolution using a rotating copper anode x-ray generator (MacScience Co. Ltd., Yokohama, Japan) operating at 40 kV and 50 mA, and a Rigaku Raxis IV detector (Rigaku/MSC, The Woodlands, TX) fitted with capillary optics (AXCO, Melbourne, Australia). A total of 80 data frames were collected using 1° oscillations and 1-h exposure times on a R axis II detector with crystal to film distance set at 120 mm. The diffraction data were integrated, scaled, and reduced using the HKL program (25Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38343) Google Scholar). Autoindexing determined that the primitive tetragonal crystals belonged to the space group P43212. Model refinement was performed with CNS (26Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clorc G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

Atomic B-factor values for the protein, water molecules, and carbohydrates were reset to an overall thermal parameter of 30 Å2. The residues within a 10-Å radius of the active site, excluding the bound glucose, were set to zero occupancy. The initial model used to locate the position of the protein in the unit cell was constructed with a restrained rigid body refinement technique from 15 to 3.0 Å. After a final round of the rigid body refinement, the crystallographic Rwork was 22.29%, Rfree was 27.40%, and the overall B value was 31.99 Å2. Geometrical positional refinement followed by individual B factor refinement was subsequently calculated using the β-d-glucan glucohydrolase model with a bulk solvent correction applied and a maximum likelihood method implemented. The electron density map was calculated from the observed structure factors and phases using the β-d-glucan glucohydrolase isoenzyme ExoI structure as the starting model (PDB accession code 1IEQ (9Hrmova M.

PheGlcIm was located in the active site pocket by examining a difference Fourier electron density map at a level greater than 4 σ. This showed peaks for the two rings of the PheGlcIm that were manually built into the electron density, using the graphics program “O” (28Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M.

A model of the active site was constructed from the side-chain groups of residues in contact with the inhibitor. Small molecule representations of the amino acid side chains were used; acetate for Asp95, Asp285, and Glu491, guanidinium for Arg158, methylammonium for Lys206, imidazole for His207, and indole for Trp434. All atoms of the inhibitor were included. The systems included 66 non-hydrogen atoms, and 49-51 hydrogen atoms, depending on the protonation state of the inhibitor and acetate representing Glu491. Restrained geometry optimization at the HF/3-21G level was applied, in which non-hydrogen atoms were restrained to their position found in the x-ray crystallographic analysis. Atoms were allowed to move 0.5 Å before restraints were applied; a harmonic restraint with force constant of 0.5 aJ Å-2 (mdyn Å-1) was used.Several protonation states of the models were considered. The acetate representing Glu491 was either ionized (corresponding to a charge of -1), or neutral. The protonation states of the inhibitor PheGlcIm were represented either by the ionized state, which corresponded to a charge of +1 and a proton on the ring N1 atom, or by a neutral form. Four configurations were considered as follows: 1, Glu491 and PheGlcIm ionized; 2, Glu491 ionized and PheImGlc neutral; and 3 and 4, Glu491 and PheGlcIm neutral, with the formal HOCO angle of 0° (see Table III).Table IIICalculated geometries of barley β-d-glucan glucohydrolase-PheGlcIm models evaluated by ab initio molecular orbital calculations with GAMESS-USQPheGleImaCharge on N1 of PheGlcIm.QGlu491bCharge on Glu491 acetate (cf. “Experimental Procedures”).RotamerGlu491Distances (Å)R(N1-Oϵ1)cDistance between Oϵ1491 and N1 of PheGlcIm.R(N1-Oϵ2)cDistance between Oϵ2491 and N1 of PheGlcIm.Experiment3.072.95Model 1+1−1NAdNA, not applicable.2.673.20Model 20−1NAdNA, not applicable.3.433.59Model 300Oϵ1491eThe formal HOCO angle is 0°.2.603.23Model 400Oϵ2491eThe formal HOCO angle is 0°.3.632.59a Charge on N1 of PheGlcIm.b Charge on Glu491 acetate (cf. “Experimental Procedures”).c Distance between Oϵ1491 and N1 of PheGlcIm.c Distance between Oϵ2491 and N1 of PheGlcIm.d NA, not applicable.e The formal HOCO angle is 0°.

The electrostatic component of the protein environment was included by incorporating partial atomic charges for all residues within 8 Å of the inhibitor, excluding those that were specified above. Partial atomic charges for amino acids were taken from the Solvent Interaction Potential (SIP) dataset (33Smith B.J. Hall N.E. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 1482-1493Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Ionizable residues Asp, Glu, Arg, and Lys beyond 8 Å had integer charges positioned at the Cγ, Cδ, Cζ, and Nz atoms, respectively.The effects of solvent on the relative energies of 1, 3, and 4 were determined through calculations of solvation energies. The electrostatic component of the solvation energies was calculated using the DelPhi program (Delphi 97.0 Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA (34Nicholls A. Hönig B. J. Comput. Chem. 1991; 12: 435-445Crossref Scopus (1162) Google Scholar)). Hydrogen atoms were added to fill in unsatisfied valencies using the InsightII package (InsightII 97.0, Molecular Simulations Inc., 1997). The positions of all hydrogen atoms were subjected to energy minimization, while keeping protein, inhibitor, and water atoms fixed at the positions determined by x-ray crystallography, by using the Discover program and conventional valence force field parameters (Discover 97.0, Molecular Simulations Inc., 1997). Electrostatic potential-derived charges (35Breneman C.M. Wiberg K.B. J. Comput. Chem. 1990; 11: 361-373Crossref Scopus (3953) Google Scholar) were calculated for the inhibitor at the HF/6-31+G(d) level and used to determine SIP atomic radii. Charges and radii for protein atoms were taken from the SIP data set of amino acids (36Smith B.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1999; 20: 428-442Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). All water molecules were removed for the calculation of solvation energies. The ionic strength was set to zero, and dielectric constant values of 1 and 78.54 were assumed for the solute and solvent, respectively. A grid of 197 × 197 × 197 points was used, yielding a grid resolution of 0.5 Å. This maintained a solvent boundary of at least 10.0 Å around the protein.Coordinates—The coordinates of β-d-glucan glucohydrolase with bound PheGlcIm have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (37Berman H.M.

Although 2F-DNPGlc, conduritol B epoxide, castanospermine, and gluconolactone all inhibit within the micromolar range, the Ki constants for glucoimidazoles are in the low nanomolar ranges (Table I) and in all cases show competitive inhibition (data not shown). Although variations of ∼1 order of magnitude in Ki values for various inhibitors have been reported (38Cozzini P. Fornabaio M. Marabotti A. Abraham D.J. Kellog G.A. Mozzarelli A. J. Med.

https://openalex.org/W1974472305,"Previous studies have indicated that the receptor for urokinase-type plasminogen activator, uPAR, can form functional complexes with integrin receptors thereby modulating integrin activity. In the present study, the role of uPAR in the regulation of α5β1-dependent polymerization of the fibronectin matrix was investigated. Incubation of fibroblast monolayers with the P-25 peptide, a uPAR ligand, resulted in a 12-15-fold increase in the accumulation of exogenous fibronectin in the cell layer. The exogenous fibronectin co-localized in the extracellular matrix with endogenous cell-derived fibronectin, and its deposition into the matrix was inhibited by blocking antibodies against the β1 integrin receptor. The P-25-dependent increase in fibronectin assembly was associated with a 7-8-fold increase in the expression of matrix assembly sites as well as a 37-fold increase in the rate of transfer of cell surface-bound fibronectin into a detergent-insoluble matrix. The effects of P-25 on the matrix assembly were attenuated by incubating cells with either phospholipase C or with antibodies against uPAR, confirming a role for uPAR in the P-25-dependent increase in matrix assembly. P-25-treated cells exhibited a 10-fold increase in the binding of the 120-kDa cell-binding fragment of fibronectin suggesting an increase in α5β1 affinity for fibronectin. Consistent with this, treatment of cells with P-25 also resulted in a 6-10-fold increase in the binding of two different monoclonal antibodies that recognize the active conformation of the β1 integrin. These results indicate that P-25 increases matrix assembly by altering the activation state of the α5β1 integrin receptor and suggest that changes in integrin activation affect both the number of matrix assembly sites as well as the rate of transfer of cell-bound fibronectin into a detergent-insoluble matrix. These data provide direct evidence that uPAR and integrin receptors synergistically regulate the levels of fibronectin in the extracellular matrix.

These data provide direct evidence that uPAR and integrin receptors synergistically regulate the levels of fibronectin in the extracellular matrix. The extracellular fibronectin matrix plays an important role in several cellular processes including adhesion, migration, differentiation, and growth (1.Hynes R.O. Fibronectins. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1990Crossref Google Scholar). The assembly of fibronectin into the matrix is a stepwise process that is dependent upon cell surface integrin receptors as well as appropriate cytoskeletal organization (2.Akiyama S. Yamada S.S. Chen W. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 3.Wu C. Chung A.E. McDonald J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2511-2523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the initial step of matrix assembly, soluble fibronectin binds to adherent cells through the amino-terminal domain of fibronectin, which binds to specific saturable sites on the cell surface (4.McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 5.Quade B.J. McDonald J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19602-19609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This site is often defined operationally by ligand binding assays using a radiolabeled 70-kDa amino-terminal fragment of fibronectin (4.McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Expression of 70-kDa binding sites is regulated by the α5β1 fibronectin integrin receptor as well as cytoskeletal tension (6.Fogerty F.J. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 7.Zhang Q. Magnusson M.K. Mosher D.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1415-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Fibronectin binding to the cell is followed by intermolecular homophilic binding events that contribute to fibril growth and detergent insolubility (8.Morla A. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 9.Hocking D.C. Smith R.K. McKeown-Longo P.J. J.

Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1081-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The expression of homophilic binding sites within matrix fibronectin can also be regulated by cytoskeletal tension providing a mechanism by which cells may incorporate soluble fibronectin directly into preformed fibrils (12.Christopher R.A. Kowalczyk A.P. McKeown-Longo P.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 569-581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Zhong C. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Brown J. Shaub A. Belkin A.M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 539-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). In most cells, assembly of the fibronectin matrix is dependent on the α5β1 integrin receptor for fibronectin. Assembly of fibronectin into the extracellular matrix requires that the integrin be in an appropriate activation state to support matrix assembly (3.Wu C. Chung A.E. McDonald J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2511-2523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Sechler J.L. Corbett S.A. Schwarzbauer J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2563-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Whether this matrix assembly-competent state reflects increased affinity of the integrin for fibronectin and/or postreceptor occupancy events necessary to support fibrillogenesis is not clear. Recent studies have suggested that integrin function can be regulated by the receptor for the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPAR) 1The abbreviations used are: uPAR, urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor; FN, fibronectin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DOC, deoxycholate; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium.

Peptides with known homologies to the integrin α subunits such as P-, α3-, and M-25, have been used to modulate uPAR-integrin complexes (30.Wei Y. Eble J.A. Wang Z. Kreidberg J.A. Chapman H.A. Mol.

This has led to the hypothesis that uPAR can form either cis- or trans-interactions with integrins on the surface of the same or neighboring cells, thereby affecting integrin function (32.Simon D.I.

Recently, high levels of expression of uPAR in human epidermoid carcinoma cells have been shown to be associated with an increase in adhesion to fibronectin and in an increase in fibronectin matrix assembly (29.Aguirre-Ghiso J.A. Liu D. Mignatti A. Kovalski K. Ossowski L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 863-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). However, nothing is known about the mechanism by which uPAR may regulate the assembly of the FN matrix. In the current study, we demonstrate that the addition of the P-25 peptide ligand for uPAR can up-regulate the polymerization of fibronectin in human dermal fibroblasts. In the presence of P-25, the rate of incorporation of cell surface-bound fibronectin into the detergent-insoluble matrix was increased 37-fold. P-25-treated cells exhibit a 7-8-fold increase in the expression of matrix assembly sites and in the level of activated α5β1 integrins. These results suggest that uPAR and α5β1 receptors coordinately and synergistically regulate the assembly of the fibronectin matrix.

Hayashi M. Cell Struct. Funct. 1988; 13: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Purified plasma fibronectin (400 μg), the 70-kDa fibronectin (100 μg), or the 120-kDa fragment (100 μg) was iodinated with 1 mCi of Na125I (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously (38.McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Iodinated proteins were mixed with bovine albumin, 1 mg/ml, dialyzed against Tris-buffered saline, and frozen at -80 °C until used. Fibronectin (1 mg/ml) was derivatized with Alexa Fluor 488 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Molecular Probes). Matrix Incorporation Assays—125I-Fibronectin assembly into a detergent-insoluble matrix was determined as described previously (38.McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Cultures were incubated with 125I-fibronectin (1 μg/ml; 1 × 106 cpm/ml) in DMEM at 37 °C in the presence of either P- or S-25. Incubation times and peptide doses and/or inhibitors are as designated in the figure legends. After incubation, cells were rinsed three times in PBS, and cell layers were scraped directly into 1 n NaOH to determine the total cell layer-associated fibronectin. In some experiments, the detergent-insoluble extracellular matrix was isolated by extraction of cell layers in 1% deoxycholate (DOC). DOC extractions were done in a 20 mm Tris (pH 8.8) buffer containing 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 2 mm iodoacetic acid. Cell layers were scraped into 1% DOC and centrifuged at 18,000 rpm for 30 min. To localize fibronectin, cell layers were incubated overnight with Alexa Fluor 488-derivatized plasma fibronectin (2 μg/ml) in serum-free medium containing 50 μm P- or S-25. Cell layers were rinsed, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton, and incubated with IST-9 antibody against cellular fibronectin, followed by goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 594-labeled secondary antibody. Fluorophores were visualized using an Olympus BMX-60 microscope equipped with a cooled LCD sensi-camera. Images were acquired using Slidebook Software (Intelligent Imaging Innovation, Inc., Denver, CO) and processed using Adobe Photoshop. Fibronectin Fragment Binding Assays—Cell layers were preincubated with peptides for 1 h prior to the addition of 125I-labeled 70-kDa fragment (100 ng/ml) or 125I-labeled 120-kDa (12.5-100 ng/ml) fragment in serum-free medium. Following incubation with fragments, cell layers were washed three times with PBS, solubilized in 1 n NaOH, and cell-associated radioactivity was determined by γ scintillation. Nonspecific binding of the 70- and 120-kDa fragments was determined in the presence of excess (50 or 100 μg/ml) unlabeled protein and was subtracted from total binding. Nonspecific binding typically ranged between 20 and 30% of the total. In some experiments, cells were plated directly onto substrates coated with either vitronectin or fibronectin. To minimize endogenous fibronectin levels during experimental procedures, cell layers were washed three times with serum-free DMEM and pretreated for 3.5 h with cycloheximide (20 μg/ml) in DMEM containing ITS+2 (Sigma) as described previously (39.Hocking D.C. Sottile J. McKeown-Longo P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To remove cell surface uPAR, cycloheximide-treated cells were suspended in PBS containing 0.9 mm Ca2+, 0.5 mm Mg2+, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm glucose, 20 μg/ml cycloheximide, and 1.0 unit/ml phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were replated onto coated substrates at 105 cells/well and allowed to adhere for 2 h. To coat substrates, fibronectin or vitronectin was diluted to 10 μg/ml in PBS and coated onto tissue plates (Corning/Costar) for 3 h at 37 °C. Determination of the Transfer Rate Constant—The transfer rate constant for fibronectin matrix assembly was determined as described previously (34.McKeown-Longo P.J. Etzler C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 601-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The transfer rate constant for matrix assembly defines the probability of surface-bound detergent-soluble fibronectin (pool I) being incorporated into the matrix (pool II) over a 1-min period, based on the equation, ([FN]I/[FN]II)=Ktt where [FN]I and [FN]II represent the concentration of FN in pools I and II, respectively, at time t. This equation can be solved by a straight line with a slope of Kt. Integrin Activation Assay—A1-F cells were grown to confluence in 48-well plates and then treated with P-25, S-25, or 2 mm MnCl2 in DMEM for 4 h. Cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin, and incubated with either 100 ng/ml of 9EG7 or 100 ng/ml of HUTS-4 antibody, which recognizes the activated conformation of the β1 integrin (40.Luque A.

Jeno P. Imhof B. Vestweber D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9051-9055Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). To assay for total β1 integrin, cells were incubated with P5D2, an antibody that recognizes all forms of β1 integrin. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated for 1 h with either goat anti-mouse HRP for P5D2 and HUTS-4 or goat anti-rat HRP for 9EG7. Freshly prepared substrate (0.1 m citrate buffer, 0.5 mg/ml o-phenylenediamine, 1 μl/ml 30% hydrogen peroxide (pH 5)) was added to each well, and the color was allowed to develop. The reaction was stopped with the addition of 2 n sulfuric acid, and the OD was measured at A490. Measurements were corrected for light scattering by subtracting the OD obtained at A630. To evaluate whether uPAR might regulate FN matrix assembly in skin fibroblasts, cells were incubated with increasing doses of a peptide, P-25, known to bind to uPAR and modulate activity of β1 integrins (24.Wei Y. Yang X. Liu Q. Wilkins J.A. Chapman H.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 28.Aguirre Ghiso J.A. Kovalski K. Ossowski L. J.

Science. 1996; 273: 1551-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). The addition of 50 μm P-25 to monolayers of skin fibroblasts resulted in an ∼15-fold increase in the accumulation of exogenous fibronectin into fibroblast monolayers as compared with control experiments done in the presence of a scrambled peptide, S-25 (Fig. 1A). Additional control experiments indicated that the scrambled peptide had no effect on basal levels of fibronectin matrix assembly (data not shown). Assembly of fibronectin into a matrix depends on the binding of the amino-terminal region of FN to matrix assembly sites on the cell surface (4.McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 42.McDonald J.A. Quade B.J. Broekelmann T.J. LaChance R. Forsman K. Hasegawa E. Akiyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2957-2967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the effects of P-25 on matrix assembly resulted from effects on matrix assembly-site expression, cell layers were incubated with the 70-kDa amino-terminal fragment of fibronectin in the presence of the P-25 peptide. Fig. 1B shows an increase in the binding of the 70-kDa fragment to cells in the presence of P-25 with levels of 70-kDa binding reaching 7-8-fold higher in the presence of P-25. The scrambled peptide, S-25, did not affect the binding of the 70-kDa fragment to cells. The binding of fibronectin to matrix assembly sites is then followed by intermolecular homophilic binding events that render the fibronectin detergent-insoluble (8.Morla A. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 9.Hocking D.C. Smith R.K. McKeown-Longo P.J. J.

Chem. 1991; 266: 10851-10858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the effect of P-25 on the assembly of fibronectin into the detergent-insoluble extracellular matrix, 125I-fibronectin was incubated with cell layers for 6 h after which matrix was isolated by extraction of cells with deoxycholate. Fig. 1C shows a dose-dependent increase in the assembly of 125I-fibronectin into the detergent-insoluble matrix in the presence of P-25. Between the doses of 10 and 100 μm P-25, there was a 5-40-fold increase in the level of fibronectin incorporated into the detergent-insoluble matrix. Incorporation of exogenous fibronectin into matrix fibronectin can be separated into two steps. In the first step, fibronectin is associated with the cells in a soluble, reversible manner (pool I). Cell-associated fibronectin is then transferred to a detergent-insoluble, irreversibly bound form (pool II) in the extracellular matrix (38.McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 44.McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. Mosher D.F. Fibronectin. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1989: 163-179Google Scholar). The rate of transfer of pool I-bound fibronectin into the detergent-insoluble matrix can be described by a transfer rate constant, Kt, which measures the probability of fibronectin moving from pool I to pool II over a 1-min period (34.McKeown-Longo P.J. Etzler C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 601-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Kt determinations for both P-25- and S-25-treated cells were determined over a 6-h period (Fig. 2). The Kt for S-25-treated cells was 0.000304 min-1. The Kt for P-25-treated cells was 0.01141 min-1, making the transfer rate constant for P-25-treated cells 37 times greater than that of S-25-treated cells. This result indicates that once fibronectin associates with cell layers, P-25-treated cells are 37 times more efficient than S-25-treated cells at transferring fibronectin into a detergent-insoluble matrix. Experiments were done to assess the localization of exogenous fibronectin within the cell layer following P-25 treatment particularly with reference to endogenous cell synthesized fibronectin. As shown in Fig. 3, the assembly of exogenous Alexa Fluor-derivatized fibronectin into the matrix has been enhanced in the presence of P-25 (compare A with B), and it co-localizes with endogenous cell-derived fibronectin as shown in C and D. Endogenous fibronectin was visualized using the IST-9 monoclonal antibody, which recognizes the alternatively spliced type III repeat, EDA, which is not found in plasma fibronectin (45.Carnemolla B. Borsi L. Zardi L. Owens R.J. Baralle F.E. FEBS Lett. 1987; 215: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The merged images shown in yellow (E and F) indicate complete co-localization with the endogenous matrix. Previous studies have shown that the adhesion of cells to vitronectin down-regulates the expression of matrix assembly sites on the surface of adherent cells (46.Kowalczyk A. McKeown-Longo P.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 152: 126-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 47.Hocking D.C. Sottile J. Reho T. Fassler R. McKeown-Longo P.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 368-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To determine whether P-25 could affect the expression of matrix assembly sites under these conditions, cells newly adherent to either fibronectin or vitronectin were incubated with the 70-kDa fragment of fibronectin in the presence or absence of the P-25 peptide. Fig. 4 shows that similar to previously published observations (47.Hocking D.C. Sottile J. Reho T. Fassler R. McKeown-Longo P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27257-27264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 48.Zhang Q. Sakai T. Nowlen J. Hayashi I. Fassler R. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 368-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), cells adherent to vitronectin exhibit a 50% decrease in the expression of 70-kDa binding sites as compared with cells adherent to fibronectin. The addition of P-25 to cells adherent to either vitronectin or fibronectin resulted in a severalfold increase in expression of 70-kDa binding sites. To verify that the effects of P-25 on matrix assembly-site expression were dependent on uPAR, adherent cells were pretreated with phospholipase C to remove uPAR prior to the addition of P-25. Treatment of cells with phospholipase C resulted in a 40% decrease in the amount of P-25-induced enhancement of 70-kDa binding sites on cells adherent to fibronectin and a 60% decrease in 70-kDa binding sites on cells adherent to vitronectin. Interestingly, phospholipase C had no effect on 70-kDa binding in the absence of P-25. Western blotting of phospholipase-treated cells indicated that ∼80% of uPAR was removed from the cell surface (data not shown). These results suggest that ligation of uPAR with P-25 rescues the inhibitory effect of vitronectin on the expression of matrix assembly sites. Experiments were also done to determine whether the P-25-enhanced incorporation of intact fibronectin into a detergent-insoluble matrix was dependent on uPAR. In these experiments, cells were preincubated with the R2 monoclonal antibody directed against uPAR prior to treatment with P-25. This antibody has been used in other studies to modulate the effects of uPAR on integrin function (28.Aguirre Ghiso J.A. Kovalski K. Ossowski L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 89-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, the R2 antibody was able to block ∼65% of the P-25-dependent increase in matrix assembly. The R2 antibody had no significant effect on mat"
https://openalex.org/W2039659863,"Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a member of the Tec family of kinases, which is a subgroup of the nonreceptor cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases. BTK has been shown to be important in the proliferation, differentiation, and signal transduction of B cells. Mutations in BTK result in B cell immune deficiency disorders, such as X-linked agammaglobulinemia in humans and X-linked immunodeficiency in mice. Although BTK plays multiple roles in the life of a B cell, its functional role in neuronal cells has not been elucidated. In the present study, we demonstrate that BTK activates transcription factor, cAMP response element (CRE)-binding protein (CREB), and subsequent CRE-mediated gene transcription during basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-induced neuronal differentiation in immortalized hippocampal progenitor cells (H19-7). The kinase activity of BTK is also induced by bFGF, and BTK directly phosphorylates CREB at Ser-133 residue, indicating that BTK has a dual protein kinase activity. In addition, blockading BTK activation significantly inhibits CREB phosphorylation as well as the neurite outgrowth induced by bFGF in H19-7 cells. These results suggest that the activation of BTK and the subsequent phosphorylation of CREB at Ser-133 are important in the neuronal differentiation of hippocampal progenitor cells.

Growth factors act by binding to cell surface receptors to elicit the regulation of cell growth and differentiation (1.Huang E.J. Reichardt L.F. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 677-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (3207) Google Scholar). This, in turn, triggers a variety of intracellular signaling pathways that ultimately control cell physiology. The activation of signaling cascades changes gene expression patterns through the functional modulation of various transcription factors. These processes allow cells to coordinate long term physiological adaptation. cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) 1The abbreviations used are: CREB, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein; bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; BTK, Bruton's tyrosine kinase; ca, constitutive active; CRE, cAMP-responsive element; EGF, epidermal growth factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FBS, fetal bovine serum; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Luc, luciferase; MALDI-TOF MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; PH domain, pleckstrin homology domain; PI-3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PP1, 4-amino-5-(4-methylphenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyridine; SH domain, Src homology domain; siRNA, short RNA interference; TK, thymidine kinase.1The abbreviations used are: CREB, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein; bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; BTK, Bruton's tyrosine kinase; ca, constitutive active; CRE, cAMP-responsive element; EGF, epidermal growth factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FBS, fetal bovine serum; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Luc, luciferase; MALDI-TOF MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; PH domain, pleckstrin homology domain; PI-3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PP1, 4-amino-5-(4-methylphenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyridine; SH domain, Src homology domain; siRNA, short RNA interference; TK, thymidine kinase. is a central transcription factor that mediates cAMP- and calcium-dependent gene expression through the cAMP response element (2.Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar). Moreover, CREB activity is regulated by multiple kinases after various kinds of stimulation. Many Ser/Thr kinases can phosphorylate CREB, including protein kinase C (3.Xie H. Rothstein T.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 1717-1723PubMed Google Scholar), Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (4.Matthews R.P. Guthrie C.R. Wailes L.M. Zhao X. Means A.R. McKnight G.S. Mol. Cell.

CREB is believed to be necessary for long term potentiation in invertebrates and vertebrates (9.Bailey C.H. Bartsch D. Kandel E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13445-13452Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the activation of CREB plays an important role in neuronal differentiation (10.Ghil S.H. Kim B.J. Lee Y.D. Suh-Kim H. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 11.Shimomura A. Okamoto Y. Hirata Y. Kobayashi M. Kawakami K. Kiuchi K. Wakabayashi T. Hagiwara M. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Specific roles for CREB in neuronal development have been found by manipulating CREB function in vivo and in vitro (12.Herdegen T. Leah J.D. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 1998; 28: 370-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) family kinases are members of a group of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, which include BTK, Tec, and Bmx. These kinases have a canonical pleckstrin homology (PH) domain at the amino terminus, followed by cysteine-rich and proline-rich regions, which together have been termed the Tec homology domain (13.Satterthwaite A.B. Witte O.N. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 175: 120-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The proline-rich portion of the Tec homology domain mediates interactions with the Src homology-3 (SH3) domains in vitro and may stabilize regulatory interactions with Src-type kinases in vivo (14.Cheng G. Ye Z.S. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8152-8155Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 15.Yang W. Malek S.N. Desiderio S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20832-20840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The expression of BTK is restricted to a subset of B cells and myeloid cell (16.Qiu Y. Kung H.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5651-5661Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and is involved in signaling of B cell antigen receptor, mast cell FcϵR, interleukin-5 receptor, and interleukin-6 receptor. Mutations in BTK are associated with X-linked agammaglobulinemia in humans and X-linked immunodeficiency and an impaired B cell proliferation in mice. A large number of proteins interact with BTK and are phosphorylated in a BTK-dependent manner. These include BAP-135, pp70, WASP, c-Cbl, Sam-68, vav, and EWS (16.Qiu Y. Kung H.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5651-5661Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Although these proteins are putative BTK regulators or effectors by virtue of their binding activity and/or BTK-dependent phosphorylation, there is no direct biological evidence that demonstrates their role in BTK signaling. Although BTK is expressed ubiquitously in nearly all cells of the hematopoietic lineages, only B cells have been shown to be vulnerable with respect to functional integrity. In addition, the molecular mechanisms underlying BTK activation in other cells, including neuronal cells, are not well understood. Interestingly, one of the genes in the breakpoint region of 7q11.23 in Williams-Beuren syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder with multisystemic manifestations, which is caused by a heterozygous deletion in 7q11.23, encodes BAP-135, a phosphorylation target of BTK (17.Perez Jurado L.A. Wang Y.K. Peoples R. Coloma A. Cruces J. Francke U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that the signal transduction mediated via BTK activation appears to be important for normal neural development. Recently it was shown that a small pool of BTK could translocate to the nucleus, although it continues to be present predominantly in the cytoplasm (18.Mohamed A.J. Vargas L. Nore B.F. Backesjo C.M. Christensson B. Smith C.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40614-40619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). BTK can also translocate to the plasma membrane upon growth factor stimulation (19.Nore B.F. Vargas L. Mohamed A.J. Branden L.J. Backesjo C.M. Islam T.C. Mattsson P.T. Hultenby K. Christensson B. Smith C.I. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To identify the upstream signal transduction pathways in which CREB functions, we sought to identify proteins that interact specifically with and directly phosphorylate CREB in vivo. In the present study, we demonstrate that CREB is a substrate for BTK phosphorylation. Interestingly, active BTK directly phosphorylates CREB on Ser-133, suggesting that BTK could be a member of dual specificity protein kinases that are capable of phosphorylating both serine/threonine and tyrosine residues. Mutations of BTK which impair its activation or the suppression of endogenous BTK by siRNA duplexes lead to the abolishment of BTK-dependent phosphorylation of CREB and to a significant inhibition of neurite outgrowth induced by neurogenic growth factor. These findings suggest that CREB lies downstream of BTK in a signaling pathway started by neurogenic bFGF, and CREB activation via BTK is important for neuronal differentiation in central nervous system hippocampal progenitor cells.

The hemagglutinin-tagged wild type or kinase-inactive BTK mutants (K430E, in which the Lys-430 in the kinase domain of BTK was mutated to Glu) were gifts from A. L. Roy (Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston). The double tyrosine-mutated BTK construct (pEGFP-BTK-2MT-Y223A/Y551F, in which Tyr-223 in the SH3 domain of BTK and Tyr-551 in the kinase domain were replaced by Ala and Phe, respectively) was generously provided by A. J. Mohamed (Karolinska Institute, Huddinge, Sweden). A eukaryotic expression vector encoding constitutive active BTK, pSR-MSVTK-caBTK, in which Glu-41 residue in the PH domain was replaced by Lys, was kindly provided by O. N. Witte (University of California, Los Angeles). A prokaryotic expression plasmid encoding bacterially recombinant GST-caBTK was constructed by inserting the NotI fragment of the caBTK sequence digested from pSR-MSVTK-caBTK into pGEX4T1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). The plasmids encoding v-Src (pMvSrc) and mutant Src (pcSrc295Arg) were gifts from D. Foster (Hunter College of the City University of New York). Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—The bait vector for yeast two-hybrid assay was constructed by subcloning the mutant CREB cDNA, in which RRPSY (from amino acids 130–134) was replaced by RRSLY, into pHybTrp/Zeo. Human fetal cDNA library subcloned into prey vector (pACT2) was purchased from Clontech. All yeast two-hybrid screening protocols were performed as described previously (20.Yang E.J. Ahn Y.S. Chung K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39819-39824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Sequencing of the inserts in positive library plasmids was performed using an automatic DNA sequencer (ALF express, Amersham Biosciences). Cell Culture—Immortalized hippocampal neuronal cells (H19-7) were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated cell culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS and 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin (21.Eves E.M. Tucker M.S. Roback J.D. Downen M. Rosner M.R. Wainer B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4373-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The cells were maintained at 33 °C under 5% CO2 and stimulated with 10 ng/ml neurogenic growth factor, bFGF, to induce neuronal differentiation, after being treated with serum-free N2 medium for 2 days, as described previously (22.Chung K.C. Gomes I. Wang D. Lau L.F. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2272-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To prepare the cell lysates, cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then solubilized in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, containing 1.0% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 137 mm NaCl, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 5 mm Na2EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 g/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cells were removed by scraping, and the supernatants were collected after centrifugation for 15 min at 14,000 × g at 4 °C. Primary cortical neurons were obtained from rat fetal brain on embryonic day 15 and triturated. Dissociated cells were plated in 24-well culture plates coated with 100 mg/ml poly-d-lysine and 4 mg/ml laminin and maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Eagle's salts, glutamine-free) supplemented with 21 mm glucose, 5% FBS (Biofluid), 5% horse serum, and 2 mm glutamine, at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere of 95% air plus 5% CO2. Plating density was adjusted to 105 cells/culture well. After 2 days, the culture medium was replaced with growth medium identical to plating medium, but lacking fetal serum, and then fed twice a week. The U937 cell line was cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and kept in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in 5% CO2 plus 95% air. SH-SY5Y cell line was grown on Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS and 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin. The cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C under 5% CO2 condition. Immunohistochemistry—Adult mice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Brains were removed and postfixed in the same buffer for 24 h at 4 °C. Thereafter, they were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose, frozen on dry ice, and sectioned on a cryostat. Serial coronal or sagittal sections (40 μm thick) were collected in a cryoprotectant solution (30% glycerol, 30% ethylene glycol, 40% 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4). Immunohistochemistry was performed by using polyclonal anti-BTK antibodies and developed using avidin-biotin technique (Elite ABC kit, Vector Laboratories). DNA Transfection and Luciferase Reporter Assay—H19-7 cells were plated at a density of 2 × 106 cells/well in 100-mm dishes, were transfected when 70∼90% confluent with suitable plasmid constructs using LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. The luciferase reporter construct, pCRE-TK-Luc, was transiently cotransfected with the kinase-inactive mutant BTK kinases (Y223A/Y551F, R28C, or K430E), and luciferase activity was measured using a luciferase assay kit (Promega) and a luminometer (EG & G Berhold, Germany). The CRE-lacking TK promoter construct (pTK-Luc) was used as a negative control throughout. Microinjection of H19-7 Cells—Around 4.5 × 104 cells were seeded to poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips placed on 6-well plate and grown at 33 °C. After the cells grew to the desired densities, anti-rabbit polyclonal anti-BTK antibody or anti-mouse control IgG (0.5 mg/ml) was microinjected with the injection buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 40 mm NaCl) containing 0.5% dextran rhodamine into the cell nuclei. Microinjection was done with an Eppendorf Micromanipulator 5171, Microinjector FemtoJet, and Olympus DP50 microscope. The cells were recovered in 10% FBS at 33 °C overnight before being shifted to 39 °C in N2 medium and were treated with 10 ng/ml bFGF. The cells containing dextran rhodamine were examined by immunofluorescence microscopy. Immunoprecipitation—1 μg of polyclonal anti-BTK antibody was incubated with 600 μg of cell extract prepared in lysis buffer overnight at 4 °C. 40 μl of a 1:1 suspension of protein A-Sepharose beads was added and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation. The beads were pelleted and washed extensively with cell lysis buffer. Bound proteins were dissociated by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and whole protein samples were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Western Blot Analysis—Whole-cell lysates were separated by electrophoresis through a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore, Japan). The membrane was blocked in TBST buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and 3% nonfat dry milk for 3 h, and then incubated overnight at 4 °C in 3% nonfat dry milk containing anti-phospho-CREB, anti-CREB, or anti-BTK antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The membrane was washed several times in TBST and then incubated with secondary IgG-coupled horseradish peroxidase antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). After 60 min, blots were washed several times with TBST and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Analysis of bFGF-induced Neuronal Differentiation in H19-7 Cells— H19-7 cells were grown on poly-l-lycine-coated 6-well dishes to reach 70∼90% confluence. The cells were transfected with 1 μg of mammalian constructs encoding wild type or dominant negative BTK mutants, such as kinase-inactive K430E or Y223A/Y551F mutant of BTK using LipofectAMINE reagent. The next day the cells were switched to N2 medium and cultured at 39 °C for 2 days. They were then treated with 10 ng/ml bFGF for 48 h, and any morphological changes were noted. Differentiated cells were defined as cells with a round and refractory cell body and at least one neurite of length exceeding the diameter of the cell body. In Vitro BTK Kinase Assay—H19-7 cells grown in serum-free N2 medium for 2 days at 39 °C were treated with bFGF. The cells were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer, and 600 μg of the proteins so obtained were incubated with polyclonal BTK antibody overnight at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were then added to 40 μl of a 1:1 suspension of protein A-Sepharose. After washing the samples three times in lysis buffer, kinase reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 60 min in 20 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 5 mm MnCl2, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 5 μg of acid-treated enolase, 10 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 5 μg of wild type GST-CREB or mutant GST-CREB S133A as a substrate. The reactions were stopped by adding SDS-sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Assay of Bacterially Recombinant Fusion GST-BTK Protein with Constitutive Active Kinase Activity—The Sepharose-4B beads prebound to bacterially expressed GST-BTK with a constitutive active kinase activity were prepared by using Bulk GST purification module (Amersham Biosciences). 30 μl of beads were suspended in 200 μl of binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 30 mm MgCl2, 40 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and mixed with 300 μg of either wild type GST-CREB or mutant GST-CREB S133A proteins for 2 h at 4 °C. After the bead pellet was washed twice with kinase buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 5 mm MnCl2, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, and 10 μm ATP, the pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of kinase buffer, and kinase reactions were carried out by adding 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 60 min. The reactions were terminated by adding of SDS-sample buffer, and the phosphorylated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Proteomic Analysis of BTK Immunocomplexes—The total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal anti-BTK IgG. After the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, bound proteins were dissociated by boiling of the beads in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the eluted whole proteins were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Next the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 dye followed by destaining overnight, and the individual protein band was digested. Each gel piece was then immersed in 100 μl of acetonitrile, dried under vacuum centrifugation for 10 min, rehydrated in trypsin buffer containing 1 μg/μl trypsin plus 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, immersed in 100 μl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, incubated for 18 h at 37 °C, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. In Vitro In-gel Kinase Assay—An 8.0% SDS-polyacrylamide gel was prepared in the presence of 50 μg/ml bacterial recombinant wild type GST-CREB or mutant GST-CREB-S113A proteins as a phosphorylation substrate. The total cell extracts were prepared after the stimulation of H19-7 cells with bFGF and applied to the gel. All gel renaturation and phosphorylation protocols were performed as described previously (22.Chung K.C. Gomes I. Wang D. Lau L.F. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2272-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Construction of siRNA Duplexes and Transfection—The siRNA duplexes for BTK were designed as described elsewhere (50.Heinonen J.E. Edvard Smith C.I. Nore B.F. FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 274-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The cDNA-targeted region and the sequence of the siRNA duplexes for BTK are as follows: targeted region (cDNA), 895-GGGAAAGAAGGAGGTTTCA-913; sense siRNA, 5′-GGGAAAGAAGGAGGUUU CAUU-3′; antisense siRNA, 3′-UUCCCUUUCUUCCUCCAAAGU-5′. The siRNA duplexes of BTK were transfected by using LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Identification of Novel CREB Kinase(s) Activated during Neuronal Differentiation in Immortalized Hippocampal Progenitor Cells—The conditionally immortalized hippocampal cell line (H19-7) was generated by transducing temperature-sensitive SV40 large T antigen into rat embryonic day 17 hippocampal cells (21.Eves E.M. Tucker M.S. Roback J.D. Downen M. Rosner M.R. Wainer B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4373-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Central nervous system progenitor H19-7 cells have the ability to differentiate terminally into neuronal cells, at a nonpermissive temperature (39 °C), in the presence of several agents, such as bFGF. Differentiating H19-7 cells express several neuronal markers, including neurite outgrowth and neurofilament proteins. In an earlier study we showed that CREB phosphorylation and subsequent CRE-mediated gene transcription play an important role during bFGF-induced neuronal differentiation in H19-7 cells (23.Sung J.Y. Shin S.W. Ahn Y.S. Chung K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13858-13866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CREB phosphorylation is not likely to be mediated by any of the previously known signaling pathways such as the MAPK, protein kinase A, protein kinase C, p70S6K, or Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase pathways. These findings suggest that the activation of a novel protein kinasesignaling pathway is required to induce bFGF-responsiveness (23.Sung J.Y. Shin S.W. Ahn Y.S. Chung K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13858-13866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the activation of two previously unreported CREB kinases of ∼76 and 120 kDa by bFGF was observed by in vitro in-gel kinase assay with recombinant GST-CREB fusion proteins as substrates. CREB phosphorylation on Ser-133 is considered to be a critical step in CREB transcriptional activation. Moreover, the modification of either the catalytic or the regulatory domain of the transcription factor is frequently used to enhance and to stabilize complex formation with its kinase in the yeast two-hybrid assay (24.Prigent S.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 124: 251-270PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Radhakrishnan I. Pérez-Alvarado G.C. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E.

Biol. 1996; 16: 694-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The same assay was performed to identify the upstream signal transduction pathways leading to CREB phosphorylation and to isolate the novel CREB kinase(s), using CREB as bait, in which the critically regulatory Pro-132 and Ser-133 residues were changed to Ser-132 and Leu-133. As a result of screening of human fetal brain cDNA library, many CREB-interacting proteins were identified, including histone deacetylase and Dyrk1A (20.Yang E.J. Ahn Y.S. Chung K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39819-39824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In addition, it was found that BTK specifically interacts with CREB in yeast cells (data not shown). Because the molecular size of BTK (77 kDa) is comparable with that of one of the novel CREB kinases (23.Sung J.Y. Shin S.W. Ahn Y.S. Chung K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13858-13866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and BTK plays an integral role in the differentiation and signal transduction directed by antigen-receptor in B cells, its functional role during neuronal differentiation was further examined. Specific Binding between Active CREB and BTK during Neuronal Differentiation in H19-7 Cells—First, we examined whether BTK is expressed in various types of mammalian primary and transformed neuronal cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, immunohistochemical analysis has shown that significant levels of BTK are expressed in a variety of mice central nervous system regions, such as neocortex, cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus. Furthermore, considerable levels of BTK protein are normally present in transformed neuronal cells. These includes human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line, immortalized rat embryonic hippocampal H19-7 cells, and rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line, compared with that in several immune B cells as a control (Fig. 1B). We also observed that BTK is enriched in the cell extracts from rat whole brain and cerebellum (Fig. 1B). These observations suggest that, outside of hematopoietic cells, BTK could play a role during cell differentiation and signal transduction in neuronal cells. To confirm the previous finding that bFGF exerts its stimulatory effect on the activation of CREB (23.Sung J.Y. Shin S.W. Ahn Y.S. Chung K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13858-13866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), Western blot analysis was performed using an antibody specific for the Ser-133-phosphorylated form of CREB. During the differentiation of H19-7 cells by bFGF, the Ser-133 residue in the CREB protein was phosphorylated, but endogenous CREB levels were not markedly changed (Fig. 1C). Then we examined whether BTK specifically binds to CREB in hippocampal H19-7 cells. The H19-7 cell extracts obtained after neurogenic bFGF stimulation were immunoprecipitated using anti-BTK antibodies and then blotted using anti-phospho-CREB antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1C, the expression of BTK is not markedly changed by bFGF. However, the addition of bFGF leads to a marked increase in the specific binding between BTK and phospho-CREB. Furthermore, when the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-phospho-CREB antibodies and analyzed by Western blot using anti-BTK IgG, it was found that the addition of bFGF resulted in specific binding between BTK and phospho-CREB (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that BTK interacts with active CREB in a speci"

The tt-dimer structure has been proposed previously (van den Akker, F., Zhang, X., Miyagi, M., Huo, X., Misono, K. S., and Yee, V. C. (2000) Nature 406, 101-104). However, no direct evidence is available to identify the physiological dimer form. Here we report site-directed mutagenesis studies of residues at the two alternative dimer interfaces in the full-length receptor expressed on COS cells. The Trp74 to Arg mutation (W74R) or D71R at the hh-dimer interface caused partial constitutive guanylate cyclase activation, whereas mutation F96D or H99D caused receptor uncoupling. In contrast, mutation Y196D or L225D at the tt-interface had no such effect. His99 modification at the hh-dimer interface by ethoxyformic anhydride abolished ANP binding. These results suggest that the hh-dimer represents the physiological structure. Recently, we determined the crystal structure of ANPR complexed with ANP and proposed a hormone-induced rotation mechanism mediating transmembrane signaling (H. Ogawa, Y. Qiu, C. M. Ogata, and K. S.

The hormonal actions of ANP are mediated by a cell membrane receptor carrying intrinsic guanylate cyclase (GCase) activity. The receptor occurs as a dimer of a single span transmembrane polypeptide containing an extracellular hormone binding domain and an intracellular domain consisting of an ATP-dependent regulatory domain and a GCase catalytic domain (10Chinkers M. Garbers D.L. Chang M.S. Lowe D.G. Chin H.M. Goeddel D.V. Schulz S. Nature. 1989; 338: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). ANP binding stimulates GCase activity and elevates intracellular cGMP levels. cGMP, in turn, mediates hormonal actions via cGMP-regulated ion channels, protein kinases, and phosphodiesterases (11Lincoln T.M. Cyclic GMP: Biochemistry, Physiology and Pathophysiology. R. G. Landes Company, Georgetown, TX1994: 57-82Google Scholar). The ANP receptor belongs to the family of GCase-coupled receptors which includes retinal GCases (12Lowe D.G. Dizhoor A.M. Liu K. Gu Q. Spencer M. Laura R. Lu L. Hurley J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Previously, we expressed the extracellular hormone binding domain of ANP receptor (ANPR) in a soluble form and purified by affinity chromatography (15Misono K.S. Sivasubramanian N. Berkner K. Zhang X. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 516-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We have found that the purified ANPR undergoes concentration-dependent self-association to a dimer and that this dimer formation is strongly enhanced by ANP binding. These findings suggest that dimerization of the receptor may play a role in signal transduction. We have also determined the crystal structure of the ANPR without bound ligand (apoANPR) (16van den Akker F. Zhang X. Miyagi M. Huo X. Misono K.S. Yee V.C. Nature. 2000; 406: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The ANPR contains two domains, the membrane-distal domain and membrane-proximal domain. In the crystal packing, the ANPR molecules can be found in two possible dimer pairs, which are the head-to-head (hh-) dimer associated through the membrane-distal domain and the tail-to-tail (tt-) dimer associated through the membrane-proximal domain. In our earlier report, we proposed the tt-dimer structure for the apoANPR based on the fact that the buried surface area for the tt-dimer interface (1,680 Å2) was larger than that for the hh-dimer interface (1,100 Å2) and that the crystallographic asymmetric unit contained a tt-dimer pair. However, there has been no direct evidence to determine which dimer form represents the true physiological structure. Recently, He et al. (17He X. Chow D. Martick M.M. Garcia K.C.

Nevertheless, the clearance receptor has considerable sequence homology with the corresponding extracellular and transmembrane regions of the ANP receptor and, consequently, is expected to have a similar overall structure. These investigators have found the C-type natriuretic peptide-bound complex occurring in a hh-dimer configuration and have proposed the apo-dimer structure in a similar hh-dimer configuration (16van den Akker F. Zhang X. Miyagi M. Huo X. Misono K.S. Yee V.C. Nature. 2000; 406: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been proposed that the hh-dimer may resemble the latent inactive state and the tt-dimer could represent the hormone-activated state (21van den Akker F. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 923-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, it remains unclear which of the hh- and tt-dimer structures represents the native ANP receptor dimer structure. In the crystal packing, the molecules make multiple contacts (crystal contacts) other than the true physiological contact. Some of these crystal contacts involve buried surface areas larger than that for the physiological dimer interface. For this reason, the physiological dimer structure cannot be identified from the crystal structure alone. Here, we report site-directed mutagenesis and chemical modification studies of residues involved in the hh- and tt-dimer interfaces which occur in the apoANPR crystal. By examining the effects of these mutations and modifications on the activities of the receptor, we have identified the hh-dimer to be the form that represents the native ANP receptor dimer structure. Remarkably, a certain single residue mutation in the hh-dimer interface caused constitutive activation of the GCase activity, whereas other mutations caused receptor uncoupling, suggesting a critical role of the dimer interface in ANP receptor signaling. Recently, we have determined the crystal structures of the ANPR bound with the hormone ANP. 2H. Ogawa, Y. Qiu, C. M. Ogata, and K. S. Misono, submitted for publication. By comparing this ANP-bound structure with the apoANPR hh-dimer structure, we have identified an ANP-induced structural change in the receptor and have proposed a hormone-induced rotation mechanism mediating transmembrane signaling by the ANP receptor. The results of mutagenesis and chemical modification studies are consistent with the ANP-induced structural change identified from the crystal structures and, hence, support the proposed signaling mechanism for the ANP receptor. Materials—The ANP peptide with residues 1-28 (ANP(1-28)), ANP(4-28), and 125I-ANP(4-28) were synthesized as described (22He X. Nishio K. Misono K.S. Bioconjug. Chem. 1995; 6: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin was obtained from Worthington (Lakewood, NJ). Ethoxyformic anhydride (EFA) was obtained from Sigma. All other chemicals used were of analytical grade or the highest quality commercially available. Site-directed Mutagenesis Studies with the Full-length ANP Receptor—cDNA encoding the full-length A-type rat ANP receptor was cloned in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) to obtain a construct designated pcDNA3-natriuretic peptide receptor A (15Misono K.S. Sivasubramanian N. Berkner K. Zhang X. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 516-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Residue mutations were introduced using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and pcDNA3-natriuretic peptide receptor A as the template. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transfection in COS cells was done using DEAE-dextran. Two days after transfection, cells were resuspended by trypsinization and were divided into multiwell plates. After an additional 2 days in culture, the cells were used for ANP binding and cGMP production assays. These steps help maximize the uniformity of the culture wells and the viability of the cells used in the assays. Assay of ANP Binding Activity—ANP binding activity of the full-length ANP receptor expressed on COS cells was assayed in 24-well cell culture plates as described previously (23Pandey K.N. Inagami T. Misono K.S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 8467-8472Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were incubated with 125I-ANP(4-28) (200,000 cpm/well) and varying concentrations of ANP(4-28) as a competing ligand at 0 °C for 1 h. After washing twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were dissolved in 1 ml of 0.2 n NaOH, and 125I radioactivity was counted in a γ-counter. Data were analyzed by iterative nonlinear regression analysis to calculate the dissociation constant Kd and binding site density Bmax. The ANP binding activity of the ANPR was measured in solution as described previously (15Misono K.S. Sivasubramanian N. Berkner K. Zhang X. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 516-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, an aliquot of conditioned culture medium or a column fraction was incubated with 125I-ANP(4-28) (200,000 cpm) in the presence and absence of 0.1 μm ANP(4-28) at 0 °C for 1 h. Protein-bound 125I activity was separated from the unbound by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-50 column and counted. Measurement of cGMP Production in Transfected COS-1 Cells—The transfected COS-1 cells in 6-well plates were incubated in 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine for 30 min at 37 °C. ANP was then added to a final concentration of 1 μm. After a 15-min incubation, the medium was removed, and cells were disrupted by two rounds of rapid freezing and thawing. cGMP was extracted with 0.75 ml of 4 mm EDTA, and the extract was boiled for 10 min and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min. A 50-μl aliquot of the supernatant was used for cGMP determination by radioimmunoassay as described previously (24Huo X. Abe T. Misono K.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16941-16951Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Expression of Wild Type and Mutant ANP Receptor Extracellular Domain—cDNA encoding the ANPR, representing amino acid residues 1-435, was cloned in pcDNA3 to obtain a plasmid construct pcDNA3-ANPR (15Misono K.S. Sivasubramanian N. Berkner K. Zhang X. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 516-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced using the mutagenesis kit and pcDNA3-ANPR as the template. COS-1 cells were transfected with the plasmid by the DEAE-dextran method. After transfection, the cells were cultured for a period of 2 weeks, harvesting the medium every 2 days. The culture medium was pooled, added with protease inhibitors (0.1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm EDTA), and centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 30 min to remove cell debris. The supernatant was collected, quickly frozen in a dry ice-ethanol bath, and stored at -80 °C until use. Detection of ANPR Dimerization by HPLC Size-exclusion Chromatography (SEC)—The conditioned medium from the cells expressing the wild type and mutant ANPR was concentrated 20-fold using an Ultra-free-15 Centrifugal Filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA). A 0.5-ml aliquot of the concentrated medium was separated on a TSK-G3000SW column (0.75 × 30 cm, Toso-Haas, Montgomeryville, PA) at room temperature in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl at the flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions of 0.2 ml were collected, of which 100-μl aliquots were used for measuring the ANP binding activity. To examine the effect of ANP binding on ANPR dimerization, 0.5 ml of the concentrated conditioned medium above was first incubated with 125I-ANP (200,000 cpm) at 0 °C for 1 h. The mixture was then separated by SEC, collecting 0.2-ml fractions. 125I radioactivity in the fractions was counted in a γ-counter. As the standards, the wild type ANPR purified by ANP affinity chromatography (15Misono K.S. Sivasubramanian N. Berkner K. Zhang X. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 516-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) was injected with or without prior incubation with a 2-fold molar excess of ANP(4-28). Effect of Histidine Modification by EFA on ANP Binding Activity—ANPR (1 μm) was reacted with 0.1 mm EFA in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 24 °C. At varying time intervals, 5-μl aliquots were taken and diluted immediately with 95 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.05% bacitracin to stop the reaction. Aliquots were used for ANP binding assay. Identification of Histidine Residues Modified by EFA—The ANPR (1 μm) in 250 μl of 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, was reacted with 0.1 mm EFA at 24 °C for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by directly injecting the reaction mixture onto a TSK-G3000SW size-exclusion column (Toso-Haas), which was eluted with 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. One-fifth of the ANPR fraction was heated at 60 °C for 30 s to denature the protein and treated with 10 units of peptide-N-glycosidase F (Oxford GlycoSystems, Oxon, UK) at 37 °C for 2 h. The fraction was then analyzed by mass spectrometry for the molecular weight to determine the number of ethoxyformyl moieties incorporated into the ANPR. The remaining fraction was digested with 1.0 μg of trypsin at 37 °C for 3 h and used for peptide mapping by LC/MS as follows. The digest above was separated on a Vydac C18 column (2.1 mm × 250 mm, Hesperia, CA) using a linear gradient of acetonitrile from 2 to 82% in water in the presence of 0.02% trifluoroacetic acid over a period of 80 min at a flow rate of 160 μl/min in a Hewlett-Packard model 1100 HPLC system (Kennett Square, PA). The column effluent was split at 1:9 ratio using a microsplitter valve (Upchurch Scientific, Oak Harbor, WA), and 1/10 of the effluent was passed into a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization source. The remainder of the effluent was collected manually while monitoring the total ion current on the mass spectrometer. Aliquots of the collected fractions were used for sequencing by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and by Edman degradation. The ion current was measured in the mass range of m/z 350-2,400 at 35-volt cone voltage and 6-s sweep time in the positive ion mode. The electrospray voltage was 3,500 volts and the source temperature at 70 °C. The nebulizer gas flow and drying gas flow were 10 liters/h and 300 liters/h, respectively. The resolution was set to gain sufficient isotope peak separation for doubly charged ions. These and other mass spectrometric analyses in this study were carried out on a Micromass Quattro II triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Manchester, UK) at the Cleveland Mass Spectrometry Facility, Department of Chemistry, Cleveland State University. Mass-Lynx 3.02 software (Beverly, MA) was used for data processing. Amino Acid Sequencing by MS/MS—A peptide sample was introduced directly into the mass spectrometer through a fused silica tube (100-μm inner diameter) at a flow rate of 2 μl/min. Electrospray and cone voltages were at 3,500 V and 40 V, respectively. The ion source temperature was at 70 °C, the nebulizer gas flow was 10 liters/h, and the drying gas flow at 250 liters/h. Precursor ion was selected by the first quadrupole (Q1), and collision-induced dissociation was effected with argon gas in the second (RF-only) quadrupole (Q2). Product ion spectrum was obtained by scanning in the third quadrupole (Q3) from m/z 50 to up to the molecular mass of the peptide in the positive ion mode. Edman Sequence Analysis—Edman sequencing was carried out in an Applied Biosystems model 477 protein sequencer (Foster City, CA) at the Macromolecular Structure Analysis Laboratory, Department of Biochemistry, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY. Modeling of the Protein Structures—The hh-dimer structure of apoANPR was modeled from the coordinates that were calculated from the tt-dimer coordinates (16van den Akker F. Zhang X. Miyagi M. Huo X. Misono K.S. Yee V.C. Nature. 2000; 406: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) (PDB entry 1DP4) by symmetry operation using the program O (25Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of ANP-bound ANPR complex has been determined in our separate study. 2H. Ogawa, Y. Qiu, C. M. Ogata, and K. S. Misono, submitted for publication. The buried surface areas were calculated with a 1.4 Å probe radius with CNS 1.1 (26Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L.

A.2002Google Scholar). Occurrence of Two Alternative Dimer Pairs in the ApoANPR Crystal Packing—In the crystal packing of apoANPR, two alternative dimer pairs can be identified (Fig. 1A). Those are the hh-dimer associated through the membrane-distal domain of the ANPR monomer (Fig. 1B) and the tt-dimer associated through the membrane-proximal domain (Fig. 1C). Previously, we reported the tt-dimer structure for the apoANPR (16van den Akker F. Zhang X. Miyagi M. Huo X. Misono K.S. Yee V.C. Nature. 2000; 406: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, there has been no direct evidence to determine which dimer form represents the true physiological structure. Fig. 2, A and B, shows the detailed interface structure for the hh-dimer and tt-dimer, respectively. The intermolecular contacts at the hh-dimer interface include a hydrophobic contact between Trp74 of one monomer (monomer A) and Trp74 of the other monomer (monomer B) (Trp74A-Trp74B), two hydrogen bonds His99A-Asp71B and His99B-Asp71A, and interaction between Phe96A and Phe96B aligned linearly head-to-head, likely sharing aromatic π-electrons (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, the contacts at the tt-dimer interface include hydrophobic contacts, Tyr196A-Tyr196B, Leu200A-Leu200B and Leu225A-Leu225B; hydrogen bonds, Asp194A-Asn221B, Asp194B-Asn221A, Arg201A-Ser269B, Arg201B-Ser269A, Arg204A-Asn228B, and Arg204B-Asn228A; and ionic interactions, Lys198A-Asp264B and Lys198B-Asp264A (16van den Akker F. Zhang X. Miyagi M. Huo X. Misono K.S. Yee V.C. Nature. 2000; 406: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The buried surface areas for the hh- and tt-dimer interfaces are 1,100 Å2 and 1,680 Å2, respectively. Both the hh- and tt-dimer interfaces involve multiple intermolecular contacts and a considerable surface area, making it unclear which dimer represents the native dimer structure.Fig. 2Close-up views of the hh- and tt-dimer interfaces.A, amino acid residues involved in the hh-dimer contact are shown in ball-and-stick model. Hydrogen bonds are shown by red dotted lines. B, two of the residues involved in tt-dimer contact (16van den Akker F. Zhang X. Miyagi M. Huo X. Misono K.S. Yee V.C. Nature. 2000; 406: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) are shown. These contact residues shown here were studied by site-directed mutagenesis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Uncoupling of ANP Receptor by a Mutation in the hh-dimer Interface—To identify the physiological dimer structure, we have carried out site-directed mutagenesis studies of the residues involved in the hh- and tt-dimer interfaces. We reasoned that a mutation in the physiological dimer interface would affect receptor signaling. We produced single-residue mutations in the hh- and tt-dimer interfaces in the full-length receptor and expressed the mutant receptors on COS cells. The effect of the mutation was then evaluated by measuring ANP binding and stimulation of cGMP production by ANP (Tables I and II).Table ISite-directed mutagenesis studies of the residues at the head-to-head dimer contactReceptor expressedKd for ANPcGMP producedEffects on signaling−ANP+ANPnmpmol/10 fmol binding siteWild type0.281.5 ± 0.3133.5 ± 27.0F96D0.211.3 ± 0.61.7 ± 0.8UncouplingV70D0.190.8 ± 0.351.9 ± 20.7SuppressionF96D/V70D0.342.3 ± 1.22.9 ± 1.0UncouplingH99D0.261.6 ± 0.33.0 ± 0.7UncouplingW74R0.5224.4 ± 9.9122.6 ± 39.3Constitutive activationD71R0.2215.0 ± 6.4123.2 ± 25.5Constitutive activation Open table in a new tab Table IISite-directed mutagenesis studies of the residues at the tail-to-tail dimer contactReceptor expressedKd for ANPcGMP producedEffects on signaling−ANP+ANPnmpmol/10 fmol binding siteWild type0.291.4 ± 1.197.1 ± 19.1Y196D0.361.5 ± 0.993.4 ± 9.1No significant effectL225D0.301.4 ± 1.2100.9 ± 17.5No significant effect Open table in a new tab The mutations introduced at the hh-dimer interface were Phe96 mutated to Asp (F96D), V70D, H99D, W74R, D71R, and a double mutation F96D/V70D (Table I), and those at the tt-dimer interface were Y196D and L225D. With all of the receptor mutants produced, their expression levels on COS cells were comparable with that of the wild type receptor (the average receptor density at about 5 × 104 sites/cell). The measured receptor density values were used to normalize the amount of cGMP produced to allow quantitative comparison as described previously (24Huo X. Abe T. Misono K.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16941-16951Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These mutations did not appreciably affect the binding affinity for ANP (Kd at 0.28 nm for the wild type, and from 0.19 to 0.52 nm range for the mutated receptors) (Tables I and II). The COS cells expressing the wild type receptor had a basal cGMP level at 1.5 pmol/10 fmol binding site (Table I). Incubation of these cells with 1 μm ANP increased the cGMP level to 133.5 pmol/10 fmol binding site, representing a ∼90-fold stimulation. The cells expressing F96D receptor mutant had a basal cGMP level at 1.3 pmol/10 fmol binding site comparable with the cells expressing the wild type receptor. However, incubation of these cells with 1 μm ANP did not cause a significant increase in cGMP. These results indicate that the F96D mutation caused the receptor to become uncoupled; namely, the receptor binds ANP but is unable to stimulate cGMP production. The cells expressing the receptor mutant V70D showed partial suppression of ANP-stimulated cGMP production. The double mutation F96D/V70D caused receptor uncoupling similar to F96D mutation, suggesting an essential role of Phe96 in ANP receptor signaling. Uncoupling of the ANP receptor was also observed by H99D mutation (Table I). Constitutive GCase Activation by Mutations in the hh-dimer Interface—The cells expressing W74R mutant had a basal cGMP level of 24.4 pmol/10 fmol binding site, which was 16-fold higher than that in the cells expressing the wild type (1.5 pmol/10 fmol binding site) (Table I). In the presence of 0.1 μm ANP, the cGMP level increased to 122.6 pmol/10 fmol binding site, a level comparable with that found with the cells expressing the wild type (133.5 pmol/10 fmol binding site). Similar results were obtained with the D71R mutant. The cells expressing D71R mutant had a basal cGMP level at 15.0 pmol/10 fmol binding site, which was 10-fold higher than that in the cells expressing the wild type receptor. ANP increased the cGMP level to 123.2 pmol/10 fmol binding site, a level comparable with that found with the cells express"

We have developed a strategy to determine the structure of sulfotransferase recognition sites which constitute these motifs. Stable isotope is first introduced into specific sites on HS with HS sulfotransferases and the modified HS is then digested into oligosaccharides of differing sizes. The overlapping oligosaccharides containing the introduced stable isotope are identified by changes in the m/z profiles by mass spectrometry, and their relationships are elucidated. In this way, the HS structures in the vicinity of the sulfotransferase recognition site are quickly determined and groups on precursor structures of HS that direct the action of HS sulfotransferases are pinpointed.

HS chains are first synthesized in the Golgi apparatus as repeated units of the disaccharide of a glucuronic acid and an N-acetylated glucosamine (GlcA-GlcNAc)n (1.Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar). The glucuronic acid can be epimerized to iduronic acid (IdoA). Incomplete sulfation at the 2-O positions of the uronic acids, and the 3-O, 6-O, and N positions of the glucosamine by various sulfotransferases results in structural diversity within HS (1.Esko J.D.

The sulfated motifs can bind to growth factors, cytokines, and morphogens as well as proteases in the extracellular matrix and regulate their activities (3.Conrad H.E. Heparin-Binding Proteins.

Although HS plays important roles in various biological processes, the structures of these biological motifs are obscure, due to the difficulties involved in obtaining homogeneous components and determining their structures. Cloning, expressing, and sequencing biopolymers have tremendously advanced our understanding of DNA and protein, but no similar methods are available for studying HS. In this report, we describe a novel strategy that permits us to quickly determine specific HS structures in the vicinity of the sulfotransferase recognition site for 3-OST-4. HS 3-OSTs are rare modification enzymes that helps to generate binding sites for proteins such as antithrombin III (2.Rosenberg R.D. Shworak N.W. Liu J. Schwartz J.J. Zhang L. J. Clin.

The delineation of sulfated motifs on the HS chain of proteoglycans will shed light on how cells interact with extracellular proteins, respond to extracellular signals, and initiate signaling cascade beginning on the cell membrane (15.Turnbull J. Powell A. Guimond S. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 75-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). This strategy relies on introducing a stable isotope of sulfate into specific sites on the HS chain by 3-OST-4. The mass-labeled HS is then digested into oligosaccharides and the overlapping oligosaccharides containing the stable isotope are identified by changes in their masses. Bovine kidney heparan sulfate, heparinase, and heparitinase I and II were obtained from Seikagaku America (Falmouth, MA). These enzymes were reconstituted at 0.3 milliunits/μl according to the manufacturer's direction. Iduronate-2-sulfatase was from ProZyme (San Leandro, CA). Heparan sulfate sulfotransferases 3-OST-4 and 6-OST-1 were cloned, expressed, and purified using a Baculovirus expression system as described previously (14.Shworak N.W. Liu J. Petros L.M. Zhang L.

Kuberan B. Rosenberg R.D. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). 33S and 34S stable isotopes were from Isonics Corp. (Columbia, MD). PAPS was prepared as described previously (16.Wu Z.L. Zhang L. Beeler D.L. Kuberan B. Rosenberg R.D. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Sample Preparation—Bovine kidney heparan sulfates were labeled with sulfotransferases in the presence of 34S, 33S, or [35S]PAPS. The labeling reaction was carried out in a 20-μl reaction with 10 μg of HS, 2 μl of 2× buffer (50 mm MES (pH 7.0), 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 5 mm MgCl2,5mm MnCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 0.075 mg/ml protamine chloride, 1.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), 1 μl of 2 mm [34S]PAPS, or 2 μl of [35S]PAPS (about 1.0 × 107 cpm) and 20 ng of expressed pure sulfotransferase. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, and the modified HS was purified with a DEAE column. The HS sample was loaded onto 0.2 ml of DEAE affinity matrix in a small purification column, washed with 2 ml of 0.25 m NaCl, 20 mm NaAc (pH 6.0), and eluted with 0.4 ml of 1 m NaCl, 20 mm NaAc (pH 6.0). The HS was then precipitated with 1 ml of ethanol and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min in a 4 °C room. Because the incorporation of [35S]PAPS into HS can be easily monitored, labeling with [35S]PAPS was performed in a parallel fashion. The labeled HS samples were then subjected to heparan sulfate lyase digestion at 37 °C for 2 h to completion according to Seikagaku's protocols. The digestion buffer contained 40 mm ammonium acetate (pH 7.0), 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 milliunit of enzyme. The digestion of the 35S-labeled HS was analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the digestion of the 34S- or 33S-labeled HS was analyzed by liquid chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Gel Electrophoresis and Autoradiograph—35S-Labeled HS and oligosaccharides were analyzed with 12.5% polyacrylamide gel (with 0.3% of bisacrylamide) electrophoresis. About 10,000 cpm of the sample was loaded onto each lane. The gel buffer contained 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and 1 mm EDTA, and the electrophoresis buffer contained 40 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 40 mm acetic acid, 1 mm EDTA. The gel was run at 10 volts/cm for 30 min with a SE 250 Mighty Small II gel apparatus (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco). After electrophoresis, the gel was transferred to a gel blotting paper and dried under vacuum. The dried gel was autoradiographed by a PhosphorImager 445SI (Amersham Biosciences). Flow Injection Capillary Liquid Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry—HPLC and mass analysis was described previously (17.Kuberan B. Lech M. Zhang L. Wu Z.L. Beeler D.L. Rosenberg R.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 8707-8718Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). An Ultimate capillary HPLC work station (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) was used for separation. UltiChrom software was used in data acquisition, analysis, and management. Dibutylamine was used as an ion-pairing agent. A gradient elution was performed using a binary solvent system composed of water (eluent A) and 70% aqueous methanol (eluent B), both containing 8 mm acetic acid and 5 mm ion-pairing agent. HPLC separations were performed on a 0.3 × 250-mm C18 column (MS 5 μm) (Vydac (www.vydac.com)). The flow rate was set to 5 μl/min. Sample volume of 6.3 μl was injected. The elution profile was 0% B for 5 min, 6% B for 19 min, 18% B for 17 min, 34% B for 13 min and 55% B for 16 min. After the run, the column was washed with 90% B for 15 min and equilibrated with 100% A for 28 min. Mass spectra were acquired on a Mariner BioSpectrometry work station electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Per-Septive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). Nitrogen was used as a desolvation gas as well as a nebulizer. Conditions for electrospray ionization-MS were as follows: nebulizer flow rate, 1 liter/min; nozzle temperature, 140 °C; drying gas (N2) flow rate, 0.6 liter/min; spray tip potential, 2.8 kV; nozzle potential, 70 V; and skimmer potential, 9 V. Negative ion spectra were generated by scanning the range of m/z from 99 to 2000. Total ion chromatograms and mass spectra were processed with the Data Explorer software, version 3.0. Calculation of the Molecular Weights and m/z Ratios of HS Oligosaccharides—The molecular weight of an HS oligosaccharide is the total weight of its functional groups and backbone structure (Fig. 1A). Based on major isotopes of 12C, 1H, 16O, 14N, and 32S, the basic disaccharide GlcA-GlcNH2 (C12H19-O10N1) has a molecular mass of 337.09; one sulfation increases the mass by 79.96 (-SO3-); one acetylation (-COCH2-) increases the mass by 42.01. Therefore, the molecular mass (w) of an oligosaccharide with a formula of (C12H19O10N1)p-(SO3)q(COCH3)t should be as follows, w=337.09p+79.96q+42.01t(Eq. 1) where p, number of disaccharide units; q, number of sulfates; t, number of acetyl groups. For an oligosaccharide with z negative charges due to loss of protons, the mass/charge ratio (m/z) will be as follows. m/z=(w-z)/z(Eq. 2) The m/z values of the observed oligosaccharides in our study were calculated with Equations 1 and 2 (Table I).Table IThe calculated m/z values of some common HS oligosaccharidesp123t001001112z121121222q0378.101416.05458.06795.15397.08586.632496.01247.50538.02833.10416.05875.11437.05605.60626.613575.96287.48617.97913.05456.03955.07477.03645.58666.584655.92327.46993.01496.011035.02517.01685.56706.5651072.97535.981114.98556.99725.54746.54 Open table in a new tab Because of the existence of minor natural stable isotopes, such as 13C, 18O, 15N, 33S, and 34S, the actual molecular mass of an oligosaccharide is a composite of w, w + 1, w + 2, w + 3, etc. Subsequently, the m/z value will also be a cluster of (w–z)/z, (w + 1)/z, (w + 2–z)/z, (w + 3–z)/z, etc., with neighboring values 1/z unit apart (Fig. 1B). Therefore, the distance between the neighboring peaks in a m/z profile reveals the number of the negative charge z on the molecule. Because the intensity of the peaks in a m/z profile is dependent on the natural abundance of each isotope, the ratio among the intensities of individual peaks is also a constant. In vitro incorporation of 33S or 34S will enhance the second or third peak respectively due to 1 or 2 mass units increase over the major isotope 32S (Fig. 1B). LC/MS Study of 3-OST-4-modified Heparan Sulfate—HS samples were first labeled with stable isotope 34S or radioisotope 35S by 3-OST-4 (16.Wu Z.L. Zhang L. Beeler D.L. Kuberan B. Rosenberg R.D. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and then digested with various heparan sulfate lyases. The digestions of the 35S-labeled HS were analyzed by PAGE (Fig. 2). It was found that heparitinase II alone generated 35S-labeled hexasaccharide (dp6) and tetrasaccharide (dp4); heparitinase was able to convert the dp6 to dp4; and heparinase was able to convert the dp4 to disaccharide (dp2). The sizes of the labeled oligosaccharides were determined with defined oligosaccharides (18.Wu Z.L. Zhang L. Yabe T. Kuberan B. Beeler D.L. Love A. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17121-17129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In a parallel fashion, the digestions of the stable isotope 34S-labeled HS were analyzed by LC/MS and all the 34S-labeled oligosaccharides were located on the HPLC chromatograms by examining the m/z profiles (Fig. 3). It was noted that actually two hexasaccharides (peaks a and b) and two tetrasaccharides (peaks c and d) were labeled with 34S in the heparitinase II digestion (Fig. 3A, upper panel). Mass profiles showed the two hexasaccharides with regular m/z of 685.62 and 725.62 and the two tetrasaccharides of 496.08 and 536.06, respectively (Fig. 3B). These results identified the two hexasaccharides as dp6–4S1Ac (four sulfates and one acetyl group) and dp6–5S1Ac (five sulfates and one acetyl group) and the two tetrasaccharides as dp4–4S and dp4–5S (four or five sulfates, respectively) (Table I). Addition of heparitinase to the digestion converted the two hexasaccharides to the two tetrasaccharides (Fig. 3A, middle panel). The further addition of heparinase converted the two tetrasaccharides to two disaccharides (peaks e and f) (Fig. 3A, lower panel). The disaccharide in peak e exhibited a regular m/z of 576.04 and z of 1 and was then identified as dp2–3S (three sulfates). The disaccharide in peak f exhibited a regular m/z of 785.19 and z of 1 and was then identified as a quasi-complex between dp2–4S (four sulfates) and dibutylamine, an ion-pairing reagent with the molecular mass of 129.15 (785.19–129.15 = 656.04) (Table I). Due to its high charge density, the dp2–4S has a strong tendency to form complexes with dibutylamine. When the above experiments were repeated with 33S labeling, the oligosaccharides identified above showed 33S incorporation (Fig. 3C). Determining the Variable Sulfation on the Oligosaccharides— Two disaccharides with three or four sulfates, two tetrasaccharides with four or five sulfates and two hexasaccharides with four or five sulfates were observed to contain 3-OST-4 introduced 34S. It was obvious that one particular sulfation was variable. To identify the site of this sulfation, HS samples were first modified by 3-OST-4, and then modified by other sulfotransferases (16.Wu Z.L. Zhang L. Beeler D.L. Kuberan B. Rosenberg R.D. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), both in the presence of [34S]PAPS. The doubly modified HS samples were digested with heparan sulfate lyases and analyzed by LC/MS. It was found that 6-OST-1 was able to convert the dp2–3S to the dp2–4S and the dp4–4S to the dp4–5S (Fig. 4). The enhancement of the peaks at 789.17 and 538.05 in the m/z profiles of the dp2–4S and dp4–5S indicated the incorporation of the second 34S into the dp2–3S and dp4–4S, respectively. This experiment showed that a 6-O-sulfate on the oligosaccharides was variable for the sulfotransferase activity of 3-OST-4. Determining the Structure of the 34S-Labeled Oligosaccharides—Two disaccharides, dp2–3S and dp2–4S, contained the 3-OST-4-incorporated 34S. Because only four positions on an HS disaccharide (2-O, 3-O, 6-O, and the N) can be sulfated by sulfotransferases, the dp2–4S must be fully sulfated. The fact that 6-OST-1 was capable of adding one sulfate group onto the dp2–3S indicates that the 6-O position in the disaccharide was not sulfated. Therefore, the two disaccharides have the following structure. ΔUA2S-GlcNS3S±6S Two tetrasaccharides dp4–4S and dp4–5S contained in vitro incorporated 34S. Because these two tetrasaccharides could be further converted into the two previously identified dp2–3S and dp2–4S by heparinase digestion, the only explanation for this phenomenon is that the dp4–4S and dp4–5S each lost a monosulfated disaccharide during enzymatic digestion. This monosulfated disaccharide is likely to be ΔUA-GlcNS, because this is a common disaccharide found in enzyme cleaved HS (1.Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar) and no monosulfated free amine containing disaccharide has been reported so far. Since heparinase cuts the GlcNS±6S-IdoA2S linkage (19.Linker A. Hovingh P. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 127: 75-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the tetrasaccharides should have the following structure. ΔUA-GlcNS-IdoA2S-GlcNS3S±6S The order of the disaccharides in the tetrasaccharides was also confirmed by treatment with the exo-enzyme iduronate-2-sulfatase, which removed one sulfate only from the dp2–3S or dp2–4S (Fig. 5) but not from the tetrasaccharides, indicating that the dp2–3S and dp2–4S should locate at the reducing sides of the tetrasaccharides. The oligosaccharides in peaks g and h were identified as a dp2–2S and a dp2–3S, as they had regular m/z of 496.04 and 576.02, respectively (Table I). Because these two disaccharides were derived from the ΔUA2S-GlcNS3S±6S by taking off the 2-O-sulfate, they should have the structures of ΔUA-GlcNS3S±6S. The dp2–3S in peak h and the dp2–3S in peak e had structures of ΔUA-GlcNS3S6S and ΔUA2S-GlcNS3S, respectively, and were eluted at slightly different time points. Two hexasaccharides dp6–4S1Ac and dp6–5S1Ac contained in vitro incorporated 34S and they could be converted by heparitinase to the previously identified dp4–4S and dp4–5S. It is apparent that each hexasaccharide lost one acetylated disaccharide ΔUA-GlcNAc (dp2–1Ac) during the enzymatic digestion. Because heparitinase cuts the GlcNAc±6S-GlcA linkage (20.Silverberg I. Havsmark B. Fransson L.A. Carbohydr. Res. 1985; 137: 227-238Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar), the two hexasaccharides should have the following structure. ΔUA-GlcNAc-GlcA-GlcNS-IdoA2S-GlcNS3S±6S We have developed a strategy to rapidly obtain the structure of HS in the vicinity of a specific sulfotransferase recognition site. This site is labeled with a stable sulfur isotope by the sulfotransferase. The modified HS is then digested with enzymes in a controlled manner to oligosaccharides of different sizes. The overlapping oligosaccharides containing the incorporated isotope are identified by mass spectrometry. The precise mass measurement also establishes the sizes of the oligosaccharides and the number of sulfate and acetyl groups on each oligosaccharide. The disaccharide arrangement in the oligosaccharides can be distinguished by substrate specificities of the heparan sulfate lyases and with the help of exoglycosidases and sulfatases. In this manner, the structure in the vicinity of the introduced isotope can be deduced. The size of the sequence obtained is dependent on the conditions and methods used for HS cleavage. More than one stable isotope and enzyme can be employed to explore the structural information on HS; for example, 33S can be incorporated by one sulfotransferase and 34S by another. In this way, the distance between the two recognition sites, and thus the relationship between the two sulfotransferases, can be established. Since most, if not all, heparan sulfate sulfotransferases have been cloned recently and all these enzymes can be assumed to possess different substrate specificities, it should be possible to obtain the structures in the vicinity of the recognition sites of all the sulfotransferases. The results will reveal the substrate specificities of those enzymes as well as how different critical groups direct the action of the subsequent sulfotransferases and eventually how the biological relevant motif structures on heparan sulfate are generated. Recently, we have also developed methods to in vitro synthesize functional HS structures with the cloned enzymes (16.Wu Z.L. Zhang L. Beeler D.L. Kuberan B. Rosenberg R.D. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 21.Kuberan B. Lech M.Z. Beeler D.L. Wu Z.L. Rosenberg R.D. Nat.

Chem. 2003; 278: 52613-52621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). With these technology advances, it is possible for us to define the biological functions of HS motifs by synthesizing the defined HS structures. It is interesting to note that the upstream half of the hexasaccharide structures ΔUA-GlcNAc-GlcA-GlcNS-IdoA2S-GlcNS3S±6S is non-sulfated and the downstream half is sulfated. At the disaccharide level, 3-OST-4 recognizes heavily sulfated disaccharides and generates tri- and tetra-sulfated disaccharides. Tetra-sulfated disaccharide is the most heavily sulfated disaccharide in HS and is also found in 3-OST-5 generated products (23.Mochizuki H. Yoshida K. Gotoh M. Sugioka S. Kikuchi N. Kwon Y.D. Tawada A. Maeyama K. Inaba N. Hiruma T. Kimata K. Narimatsu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26780-26787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The biological significance of this disaccharide is under further investigation. The 6-O-sulfate that resides in the same glucosamine residue where 3-O sulfation occurred was found to be variable, indicating that this particular sulfate is not required for 3-OST-4 recognition. The fact that this 6-O-sulfate was also found variable in 3-OST-1 and 3-OST-3 recognition (10.Liu J. Thorp S.C. Med. Res. Rev. 2002; 22: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) suggests that 3-O-sulfotransferases do not make contacts with this 6-O-sulfate during substrate recognition. We have also investigated the heparan sulfate structure at the vicinity of 3-OST-1 recognition site. Our current data (data not shown) confirmed the previously reported tetrasaccharide structure ΔUA-GlcNAc6S-GlcA-GlcNS3S±6S (24.Zhang L. Yoshida K. Liu J. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5681-5691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Comparing with the tetrasaccharide structure at 3-OST-4 recognition site (ΔUA-GlcNS-IdoA2S-GlcNS3S±6S), we found that the two internal sugar residues in the tetrasaccharides are different. We surmise that an N-acetylated glucosamine and a following GlcA are involved in directing the action of 3-OST-1, whereas an N-sulfated glucosamine and a following 2-O-sulfated IdoA are involved in the action of 3-OST-4. The differences on the HS structures recognized by the two sulfotransferases indicate that they have different biological functions. We are grateful to Professor M. Krieger and Dr. B. Kuberan for helpful discussions and comments. We also thank M. L. Marinelli and M. Leavitt for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2033067962,"Over the past decade, a wealth of knowledge has been obtained concerning the mechanisms by which interferons (IFNs) and other cytokines activate or down-regulate immediate early genes via the Jak/Stat pathway. In contrast, little information is available on interferon-activated gene expression in naïve cells compared with cells that have been desensitized and subsequently resensitized to the actions of these cytokines.

IFNα/β-stimulated formation of the transcription factor complex ISGF3 mediates gene induction by binding to an interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) located within the promoter of interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) (1Leaman D.W.

ISGF3 is composed of three proteins Stat1, Stat2, and p48 (IRF9). Stat1 and Stat2 are covalently modified by tyrosine phosphorylation after exposure of cells to IFNα/β and subsequently translocate to the nucleus where they interact with IRF9 (p48). The Jak1 and Tyk2 tyrosine kinases also are an integral component of these signaling cascades (3Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Google Scholar). They are activated by IFNα/β and are responsible for the tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat2. The mechanism governing interferon-induced transcriptional responses has now been extended to include a broad network of cytokine-regulated signaling systems that use tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat proteins to activate transcription of early response genes. interferon signal transducer and activator of transcription interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 interferon-stimulated response element interferon-stimulated gene of 54 kDa Janus kinase IFN-γ response region T-cell protein-tyrosine phosphatase phosphotyrosine phosphatase glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase suppressors of cytokine signaling electrophoretic mobility shift assay chromatin immunoprecipitation assay 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid mouse embryonic fibroblasts. interferon signal transducer and activator of transcription interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 interferon-stimulated response element interferon-stimulated gene of 54 kDa Janus kinase IFN-γ response region T-cell protein-tyrosine phosphatase phosphotyrosine phosphatase glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase suppressors of cytokine signaling electrophoretic mobility shift assay chromatin immunoprecipitation assay 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid mouse embryonic fibroblasts.

The SH2 domain-containing SOCS family of proteins (suppressors of cytokine signaling) are activated by a variety of cytokines including interferons and act as inhibitors of the Jak/Stat pathway. SOCS proteins bind to both tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors and Jaks, and mediate their ubiquitin-dependent degradation (11Kile B.T. Schulman B.A. Alexander W.S. Nicola N.A. Martin H.M. Hilton D.J.

In contrast to the SOCS proteins whose expression is up-regulated as a consequence of cytokine treatment, the PIAS (Protein Inhibitors of Activated STATs) proteins are constitutively expressed. This family of five nuclear proteins binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat dimers and prevents them from binding DNA (12Liu B. Liao J. Rao X. Kushner S.A. Chung C.D. Chang D.D. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10626-10631Google Scholar, 13Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K. Science. 1997; 278: 1803-1805Google Scholar). They have an additional function as SUMO E3-ligases whose substrates include c-Jun and p53 (14Kotaja N. Karvonen U. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 5222-5234Google Scholar, 15Schmidt D. Muller S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2872-2877Google Scholar). One aspect of cytokine regulation of the Jak/Stat pathway that has received little attention, is whether there are any changes in the regulation of immediate early genes in cells that have been previously exposed to a cytokine, have become refractory, and subsequently become re-sensitized to the cytokine. Understanding this process is significant in that in many pathophysiological settings cytokines can be repeatedly released in large amounts in response to both inflammatory and infectious insults. It is also relevant in terms of the therapeutic use of cytokines where the frequency of treatment of chronic conditions such as multiple sclerosis with IFNβ, should be optimized to intervals where cellular targets are not desensitized to actions of the drug. In order to understand the cellular effects of repeated cytokine exposure in greater detail, we have examined the IFNα/β-stimulated expression of ISG54. This gene is well known to be activated through an ISRE-dependent mechanism by type 1 interferons. It also has the advantage that the half-life of the mRNA is relatively short, so that re-induction of transcription can be easily monitored. The results from these studies clearly demonstrate that compared with naïve cells, cells previously desensitized to the actions of IFNβ show a dramatically altered response when re-exposed to this cytokine. Although previously desensitized cells display a robust induction of ISGs, this activation shows no detectable IFNβ-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1, and a reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat2. The lack of Stat1 tyrosine phosphorylation is due to the tyrosine phosphatase, T-cell protein-tyrosine phosphatase (Tc-PTP). Cells and Culture—Human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs), Tc-PTP–/– and wild-type mouse embryo fibroblasts obtained from matched littermates were all maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.), and containing 2 mml-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin (Invitrogen). Fresh human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated as previously described (16Finbloom D.S. Wahl L.M. Winestock K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22545-22548Google Scholar) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing with 10% fetal calf serum, and antibiotics. Both human IFNβ (Avonex) and murine IFNβ were obtained from Biogen Inc. Human and murine IFNγ were provided by Genetech Inc. RNA Assays—RNase protection assays were performed as previously described (17Petricoin E.F. Hackett R.H. Akai H. Igarashi K. Finbloom D.S. Larner A.C. Mol.

Briefly, total RNA was isolated with RNAzol B (Tel-Test Inc.). Antisense 32P-labeled RNA probes were synthesized by in vitro transcription using T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Inc.). 10 μg of RNA and 32P-labeled probes were incubated in hybridization buffer (80% formamide, 40 mm PIPES (19Awata T. Matsumoto C. Urakami T. Hagura R. Amemiya S. Kanazawa Y. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: 1159-1162Google Scholar), 400 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) overnight at 56 °C followed by digestion with T1 RNase (Ambion) for 1 h at 37 °C. After phenol:chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, protected RNA fragments were solubilized and subjected to electrophoresis on a 4.5% polyacrylamide-urea gel. RT-PCR was used to analyze ISG54 and GAPDH in wild-type and Tc-PTP-null MEFS. The primers for mouse ISG54 are: Forward, 5′-ATGAAGACGGTGCTGAATACTAGTGA-3 and Reverse, 5′-TGGTGAGGGCTTTCTTTTTCC-3′; mouse GAPDH: Forward, 5′-TGTTCCAGTATGACTCCACTCACG-3 and Reverse 5′-AGATGATGACCCGTTTGGCTC-3′; PCR conditions: 94 °C 5 min, 94 °C 1 min, 57 °C 1 min, 25 cycles 72 °C 2 min (20Poast J. Seidel H.M. Hendricks M.D. Haslam J.A. Levy H.B. Baron S. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 1035-1040Google Scholar). Preparation of Cell Extracts—Cells were lysed by vigorously vortexing for 20 s in dounce buffer (20 mm Hepes, 25 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm orthovanadate, 25 mm NaF, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). After centrifugation (1500 × g) at 4 °C for 10 min, supernatants were collected as cytoplasmic extracts. Nuclear extracts were prepared by resuspension of the crude nuclei in nuclear extraction buffer (20 mm Hepes, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm orthovanadate, 25 mm NaF, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) at 4 °C for 30 min, and the supernatants were collected as nuclear extracts after centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min. For whole cell extracts, cells were lysed in whole cell extraction buffer (20 mm Hepes, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm orthovanadate, 25 mm NaF, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). After centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min, supernatants were collected. Protein concentration was measured by the Bio-Rad/Bradford protein assay. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—Synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the ISRE of the ISG15 promoter (5′-GATCCATGCCTCGGGAAAGGGAAACCGAAACTGAAGCC-3′) and the IFN-γ response region (GRR) sequence of FcγRI promoter (5′-AATTAGCATGTTTCAAGGATTTGAGATGTATTTCCCAGAAAAG-3′) were used as a probes. They were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Inc.). Each 40-μl reaction mixture contained 5 ng of labeled oligonucleotides, poly (dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences), and equal amounts of protein in ISRE binding buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 1.25 mm MgCl2, 0.125 mm EGTA, 0.625 mm dithiothreitol, 5% Ficoll, 0.025% Nonidet P-40) or GRR binding buffer (12.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 125 mm KCl, 6.25 mm MgCl2, 1.25 mm dithiothreitol, 12.5% glycerol). The mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 30 min and then left on ice for 30 min. The DNA-protein complexes were subjected to electrophoresis on a 4.7% polyacrylamide gel in 0.25× Tris borate/EDTA at 285 V for 2.5 h and visualized by autoradiography (17Petricoin E.F. Hackett R.H. Akai H. Igarashi K. Finbloom D.S. Larner A.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 4486-4495Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Proteins in nuclear extracts, cytoplasmic extracts, or whole cell extracts were separated in SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. The membranes were probed with rabbit polyclonal antibody against either STAT1, phospho-STAT1 (PY 701) (Cell Signaling Technology), STAT2, or phospho-STAT2 (PY 689) (Upstate Biotechnology). Following hybridization, the membrane was washed and incubated for 30 min with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and subsequently developed by chemiluminescence using the ECL Western blotting system (Amersham Biosciences). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation PCR (ChIP)—ChIP were preformed as described by Paulson et al. (21Paulson M. Press C. Smith E. Tanese N. Levy D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 140-147Google Scholar). The Stat2 antisera were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (C-20). Stat1 antibody was generated in rabbits as previously described (22Larner A.C. David M. Feldman G.M. Igarashi K. Hackett R.H. Webb D.A.S. Sweitzer S.M. Petricoin III, E.F. Finbloom D.S. Science. 1993; 261: 1730-1733Google Scholar). To examine the effects of IFNα/β on naïve and previously desensitized cells, we used primary human fibroblasts because the transcriptional activation and inactivation of type 1 interferon-stimulated immediate early genes has been well characterized in these cells (23Decker T. Lew D.J. Cheng Y.-S.E. Levy D.E. Darnell J.E. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2009-2014Google Scholar, 24Larner A.C. Chaudhuri A. Darnell J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 453-459Google Scholar). In these studies we have chosen the mRNA encoded by the ISG54 gene for analysis, because its expression is known to be regulated by IFNα/β-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat2, and their subsequent binding to an ISRE in its promoter (25Reich N. Evans B. Levy D.E. Fahey D. Knight E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6394-6398Google Scholar). Furthermore, the half-life of the ISG54 mRNA is short (see Fig. 1A). Cells exposed to IFNβ for 2 h show a robust induction of ISG54 expression which, in the continued presence of IFNβ, remains elevated for 16 h (23Decker T. Lew D.J. Cheng Y.-S.E. Levy D.E. Darnell J.E. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2009-2014Google Scholar, 26Larner A.C. Jonak G. Cheng Y.-S.E. Korant B. Knight E. Darnell J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6733-6737Google Scholar). Incubation for an additional 6 h after removal of IFNβ from the media results in the complete disappearance of ISG54 mRNA (Fig. 1A, lane 4). Importantly, reexposure of the same cells to IFNβ for 2 h yields an induction of ISG54 that is similar to that of naïve cells (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 2 and 5). Incubation of both naïve and previously desensitized cells with actinomycin D and IFNβ prevents the induction of ISG54 (Fig. 1B), indicating that the increase in ISG54 mRNA levels triggered by the second cytokine exposure results from a transcriptional re-induction rather than an IFNβ-mediated stabilization of previously transcribed mRNA. Nuclear extracts prepared from naïve fibroblasts incubated with IFNβ for 30 min contain the transcription factor complex ISGF3 (composed of Stat1 and Stat2) or GRR (which contains only Stat1) (22Larner A.C. David M. Feldman G.M. Igarashi K. Hackett R.H. Webb D.A.S. Sweitzer S.M. Petricoin III, E.F. Finbloom D.S. Science. 1993; 261: 1730-1733Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C, lane 1 versus 2). Surprisingly, compared with naïve cells, the extent to which IFNβ is capable of activating ISRE binding is very much diminished in cells incubated with IFNβ for 16h followed by an additional 6 h without the cytokine, and subsequent re-stimulation with IFNβ for 30 min (Fig. 1C, compare lane 2 with 5). Moreover, we have not been able to detect any formation of a GRR binding complex in extracts prepared from previously desensitized cells (Fig. 1C, lower panel). To confirm the results of the EMSAs, we also directly examined tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat2 in the same nuclear extracts using phosphospecific antibodies (Fig. 1D). Naïve cells incubated with IFNβ for 30 min showed a significant amount of both tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat1 and Stat2 (Fig. 1D, lane 2, upper panels). Cells incubated with IFNβ for 16 h or those re-exposed to IFNβ after a 6 h recovery period showed no tyrosine phosphorylated Stat1 (Fig. 1D, lanes 3 and 5, upper panel). In contrast to Stat1, cells that had recovered for 6 h prior to re-exposure to IFNβ for 30 min showed clear induction of Stat2 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1D, lane 5). We have confirmed that the weak IFNβ-induced ISRE-binding complex seen in previously desensitized cells contains Stat2, but we have not been able to detect Stat1 in this complex (data not shown). As expected, there is an IFNβ-dependent nuclear translocation of these proteins, although there is some constitutive nuclear Stat1 in untreated cells (data not shown). It is notable that the amount of total nuclear Stat1 or Stat2 does not appear to diminish with extended incubation with IFNβ even though these proteins are subject to dephosphorylation. To directly examine the binding of Stat1 and Stat2 to the endogenous ISG54 promoter we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR analysis (ChIP). Human fibroblasts were incubated with or without IFNβ as described in Fig. 1, C and D. Cells were fixed with formaldehyde, chromatin was isolated, and immunoprecipitated with Stat1- or Stat2-specific antisera. Immunoprecipitated chromatin was then subjected to PCR with primers corresponding to the promoter of ISG54 (Fig. 1E). Incubation of cells with IFNβ for 30 min induced an increase in the binding of both Stat1 and Stat2 to the ISG54 promoter (lanes 6 and 7). After 16 h Stat1 was not associated with the promoter while there was still a small amount of Stat2 binding (lane 8). This is of interest since under these conditions there is likely a very low level of ISG54 transcription (data not shown). After removal of IFNβ for 6 h both Stat1 and Stat2 binding to the promoter were undetectable (lane 9). Incubation of previously desensitized cells with IFNβ induced an association of Stat2, but not Stat1 with the promoter. The amount of Stat2 bound to the promoter of previously desensitized cells varied from experiment to experiment, and ranged from 40 to 80% of naïve cells (data not shown). The amount of Stat2 that bound to the ISG54 promoter in previously desensitized cells correlated well with the degree to which Stat2 was tyrosine phosphorylated in previously desensitized cells. These results establish that primarily Stat2 and not Stat1 binds to the endogenous ISG54 promoter in previously desensitized cells. The experiments described above were performed using primary human fibroblasts. To determine whether the same pattern of transcriptional responses is seen in other primary cells, a similar experiment was performed using primary human peripheral blood monocytes. Monocytes isolated from healthy volunteers were purified by elutriation and treated as outlined above. IFNβ-stimulated induction of ISG54 mRNA showed a similar pattern in primary monocytes as was seen in primary fibroblasts. Cells incubated for 16 h with IFNβ, followed by a 6-h recovery period, showed a full transcriptional re-induction of the gene when re-exposed to IFNβ (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 2 and 5). Whole cell extracts prepared from monocytes under similar conditions were probed for tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat1 and Stat2 (Fig. 2B). As expected, both Stats showed increased tyrosine phosphorylation after 30 min of incubation with IFNβ (Fig. 2B, lane 2, upper panels), but only Stat2 tyrosine phosphorylation could be detected after 16 h in the presence of IFNβ followed by a 6 h recovery period, and retreatment with IFNβ (Fig. 2B, lane 5, upper panels). Interestingly, Stat1 and Stat2 displayed residual tyrosine phosphorylation after 16 h of incubation with IFNβ (lane 3), which differs from the pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation of these Stats seen in fibroblasts (see Fig. 1D). Probing the blots for total Stat1 and Stat2 (lower panels) revealed that the amount of Stat1 is increased in cells incubated with IFNβ for 16 h as interferons induce Stat1 gene expression (27Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Google Scholar). The observation that IFNβ does not stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 in previously desensitized cells, would lead to the prediction that genes that are activated by IFNβ through Stat1 GRR binding would not be induced in such cells. To test this hypothesis we examined IFNβ-induced expression of FcγR1 mRNA in primary human monocytes (Fig. 2C). The promoter region of the FcγR1 gene, which is activated primarily by IFNγ and, to a lesser extent, by IFNα/β, harbors a GRR which binds tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat1 (18Wilson K.C. Finbloom D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11964-11968Google Scholar, 28Pearse R.N. Feinman R. Ravetch J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11305-11309Google Scholar). Monocytes were incubated for 2 h with either IFNβ or IFNγ, or 16 h with IFNβ followed by a 6-h recovery period, and re-stimulation with IFNβ or IFNγ for an additional 2 h. FcγR1 mRNA was then analyzed by RNase protection using actin as an internal control. In naïve cells, both IFNβ and IFNγ stimulated the expression of FcγR1 (Fig. 2C, lane 1 versus 2 and 4). The induction of FcγR1 RNA by IFNβ is less than that by IFNγ because this gene is activated by Stat1, and IFNγ stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 far more effectively that IFNβ in primary monocytes. 2A. C. Larner, G. Feldman, and D. Finbloom, unpublished observations. Cells that were incubated with IFNβ for 16 h and subsequently allowed to recover for 6 h showed no FcγR1 mRNA (data not shown). Re-exposure of such cells to IFNβ failed to induce the expression of FcγR1 (lane 3). In contrast, IFNγ did induce the RNA, albeit to a lesser degree than in naïve cells (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 4 and 5). These results strongly support the notion that the IFNβ-stimulated transcriptional re-induction in previously desensitized cell is restricted to genes under the control of the ISRE enhancer. There are several potential mechanisms that could account for the selective decrease in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 compared with Stat2 in previously desensitized fibroblasts. One possibility is a selective inhibition of the upstream signaling events leading to Stat1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Conversely, a change in the relative activities of the respective tyrosine phosphatase(s) that dephosphorylate these proteins could also explain the observed results. To examine these possibilities, cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared from naïve and previously desensitized fibroblasts incubated with IFNβ for different times. EMSAs were then performed to assay formation of ISRE-binding complexes (Fig. 3A). As previously described (29Dale T.C. Ali Imam A.M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1203-1207Google Scholar, 30Levy D.E. Kessler D.S. Pine R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1362-1371Google Scholar), ISGF3 can be observed in the cytoplasm of IFNα/β-treated cells within 10 min (Fig. 3A, left panel, lane 3). Approximately the same amount of ISGF3 can also be seen in the cytoplasm of previously desensitized cells re-exposed to IFNβ for 10 min (Fig. 3A, left panel, lane 8). However, whereas a robust ISRE-binding activity exists in the nuclei of IFNβ-stimulated naïve cells (Fig. 3A, right panel, lanes 3–5), very little or no ISGF3 is detectable in the nucleus of previously desensitized cells (Fig. 3A, right panel, lanes 7–10). Furthermore, Western blotting for nuclear tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat1 and Stat2 in naïve or previously desensitized cells incubated with IFNβ revealed that only tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat2 was present in the nuclei of previously desensitized cells (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 1 and 2 with 3 and 4, and 5 and 6 with 7 and 8). These results suggest that formation of ISGF3 is not diminished in previously desensitized cells compared with naïve cells. Rather, it appears that the ability of these cells to accumulate the activated complex in the nucleus is impaired, suggesting the elevated activity of a Stat1-specific tyrosine phosphatase in previously desensitized cells. The observation that IFNβ-stimulated formation of ISGF3 could be detected in about the same amounts in the cytoplasm, but not in the nuclei of re-sensitized cells suggests an enhanced nuclear tyrosine phosphatase activity that dephosphorylates Stat1, and to a lesser extent, Stat2. To further examine this possibility, we assayed the rate of Stat1 dephosphorylation in naïve and previously desensitized cells under pulse-chase type conditions. IFNβ does not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 in previously desensitized cells, thus we used IFNγ to induce Stat1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Naïve or previously desensitized human fibroblasts (incubated with IFNβ for 16 h followed by a 6 h recovery period), were incubated with IFNγ for 30 min after which the kinase inhibitor staurosporin was added to halt any further tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1. Staurosporin has been used in a number of reports to analyze the rate of decay of tyrosine phosphorylated Stats (10ten Hoeve J. de Jesus Ibarra-Sanchez M. Fu Y. Zhu W. Tremblay M. David M. Shuai K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 5662-5668Google Scholar, 31Haspel R.L. Salditt-Georgieff M. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO. 1996; 15: 6262-6268Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts were prepared at various times after the addition of staurosporin and Stat1 DNA binding was assayed by EMSA using a probe corresponding to the GRR of the FcγR1 gene (Fig. 4) (18Wilson K.C. Finbloom D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11964-11968Google Scholar). The GRR binding activity elicited following 30 min of IFNγ stimulation was slightly less in previously desensitized cells compared with naïve cells (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 2 and 7). After addition of staurosporin, GRR binding significantly decayed but was still detectable after 50 min in naïve cells (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 2 and 5). However, in previously desensitized cells the GRR binding activity disappeared within 5 min after the addition of staurosporin (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 7 and 8). These results strongly support our model that an elevated tyrosine phosphatase activity directed against Stat1 is present in previously desensitized cells. To examine the subcellular location of this enhanced PTPase activity, nuclear extracts were prepared from naïve and previously desensitized cells incubated with IFNγ followed by the addition of staurosporin (Fig. 4B). In a manner similar to whole cell extracts there is a differential loss of the GRR binding complex in nuclear fractions from cells incubated 16 h with IFNβ. The enhanced PTPase activity toward Stat1 in cells exposed to IFNβ for extended periods suggests that these cells would also show altered sensitivity to IFNγ. The results presented in Fig. 2C support this model since IFNγ induction of FcγR1 RNA is diminished in monocytes incubated with IFNβ for 16 h compared with naïve cells. To examine this in greater detail, human fibroblasts were incubated with or without IFNβ for 16 h, allowed to recover for 6 h and then stimulated with different doses of IFNγ for 30 min. Nuclear extracts were prepared and"
https://openalex.org/W2097487315,"Epimorphin is a mesenchymal morphogen that has been shown to mediate epithelial-mesenchymal signaling interactions in various organs. We now show that epimorphin functions in hair follicle morphogenesis; using a novel ex vivo organ culture assay, we define a mechanism for epimorphin signaling that may provide insight into general developmental processes. We found that epimorphin was produced by follicular mesenchymal cells and bound selectively to follicular epithelial cells, and that treatment with recombinant epimorphin could stimulate procession of hair follicles from telogen (resting stage) to anagen (growing stage). Based on analyses of epimorphin proteolytic digests that suggested a smaller peptide might be able to substitute for the full-length epimorphin molecule, we determined that pep7, a 10-amino acid peptide, was capable of inducing telogen-to-anagen transition both in the culture assay and in the mouse. That pep7 showed maximal activity only when modified with specific sulfhydryl-reactive reagents suggested that a particular structural conformation of the peptide was essential for activity; molecular dynamics studies were pursued to investigate the active peptide structure. These findings define a previously unknown morphogenic process in the hair follicle that may have applications to many other organs."
https://openalex.org/W2028326489,"Using a cDNA microarray analysis, we previously found that exposure of a highly invasive ovarian cancer cell line HRA with bikunin, a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor, or bikunin gene overexpression markedly reduced phosphoinositide kinase (PI3K) p85 gene expression, demonstrating that PI3K may be a candidate bikunin target gene. To clarify how reduced levels of PI3K may confer repressed invasiveness, we transfected HRA cells with PI3K p85 antisense-oligodeoxynucleotide (AS-ODN) and compared the properties of the transfected cells with those of parental cells and sense (S)-ODN cells. We have also demonstrated previously that transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) stimulates urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA)-dependent invasion and metastasis of HRA cells. Here, we show that 1) TGF-β1 induced a rapid increase of the PI3K activity that was accompanied by increased expression (5-fold) of the uPA mRNA; 2) pharmacological inhibition of PI3K or AS-PI3K ODN transfection inhibited TGF-β1-stimulated Akt phosphorylation; 3) both PI3K pharmacological inhibitors and forced expression of AS-PI3K ODN reduced TGF-β1-stimulated uPA mRNA and protein expression by ∼70% compared with controls; 4) concentrations of PI3K inhibitors, sufficient to inhibit uPA up-regulation, inhibited TGF-β1-dependent HRA cell invasion; 5) the AS-PI3K ODN cells had a decreased ability to invade the extracellular matrix layer as compared with controls; and 6) when the AS-PI3K ODN cells were injected intraperitoneally into nude mice, the mice developed smaller intraperitoneal tumors and showed longer survival. We conclude that PI3K plays an essential role in promoting uPA-mediated invasive phenotype in HRA cells. Our data identify a novel role for PI3K as a bikunin target gene on uPA up-regulation and invasion."

The F-type proton-translocating ATPase/synthases are a family of enzymes primarily responsible for the oxidative phosphorylation of ADP to form ATP (1Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar, 2Capaldi R.A. Aggeler R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 154-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 3Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 300-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). These membrane-bound enzymes are found in the inner membranes of mitochondria, the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts, and the inner membranes of bacteria. The synthase uses energy from an electrochemical gradient of protons generated by a membrane-bound electron transport chain to drive the binding and catalysis of ADP and Pi and the release of ATP. The actual synthesis (or hydrolysis in the reverse direction) reaction of the triphosphate nucleotide occurs in one of three catalytic sites under tightly bound conditions (the “tight” site or site 1) with a Keq ∼ 1; thus, the energy provided by the proton gradient is used primarily to alter the binding of the substrates and products, and hence the “binding change” mechanism. Certain aspects of the enzymes are generally accepted. In the direction of hydrolysis, given an enzyme with three empty catalytic sites, MgATP binds to the first site with very high affinity (nanomolar range). Once bound, this nucleotide undergoes oxygen exchange with medium water (a process called unisite catalysis) as the nucleotide undergoes rapid cycles of hydrolysis and resynthesis. Release of ADP is very slow (4Boyer P.D. Cross R.L. Momsen W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 2837-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 5Penefsky H.S. Cross R.L. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1991; 64: 173-214PubMed Google Scholar). As the concentration of ATP is increased and approaches the Kd values for the remaining two sites, the rate of product release increases, a phenomenon called catalytic cooperativity (6Gresser M.J. Myers J.A. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12030-12038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The affinity of the second site for MgATP (micromolar range) is lower than the first, and the affinity of the third site is lower still (range, 10-100 μm). Thus, the binding of nucleotide exhibits negative cooperativity. There has been controversy recently regarding the necessity of substrate binding to subsequent sites for the activation of rapid catalysis. On one hand, it has been argued and demonstrated that some enzymes, particularly those from mitochondria and chloroplasts, display bisite activation, i.e. the binding of substrate(s) at the second site is necessary and sufficient to accelerate the enzyme from slow unisite catalysis to rapid rotational catalysis (7Zhou J.-M. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1531-1538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This does not exclude the occupation of the third site by a nucleotide but argues instead that there is (at any given moment) a single site with a single Km that must be occupied for rapid catalysis to proceed. In contrast to this, studies of purified mutant F1 sector from Escherichia coli suggest that for ATPase activity all three catalytic sites must be bound before rapid catalysis may proceed (8Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondrial and plastidic enzymes function primarily and perhaps exclusively as ATP synthases within their cellular contexts. Similarly, the enzyme from Paracoccus denitrificans, a photosynthetic bacterium, also functions almost exclusively as a synthase (9Perez J.A. Ferguson S.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10503-10518Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Other bacterial enzymes, in particular the well characterized enzyme from E. coli, have important roles both as a synthase and as an ATP-driven proton pump. This latter role is especially critical during growth on fermentable carbon sources when the cytoplasmic pH drops and rapid proton extrusion is necessary (10Booth I.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1985; 49: 359-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A consequence of these varying roles has been a greater focus on the synthase activity of mitochondrial and plastidic enzymes and on the ATPase activity of the E. coli enzyme. Because of these differences in experimental systems the debate has often been conducted across the line between ATPase and ATP synthase mechanisms, although important distinctions exist between the two activities. The ATP synthase assay has been used as a regular tool for many years in this laboratory, and over that time the protocol has been optimized so that we now obtain consistently high synthase activity from our E. coli membrane preparations. Here we present data on E. coli ATP synthase kinetics and determine the dependence on substrate concentration over a range of 2 orders of magnitude for both substrates, allowing comparison to previous data on the synthase activity of enzymes from mitochondrial and plastidic sources. Membrane Preparation—Everted E. coli membranes were prepared from strain LE392. Cells were grown in LB medium to an A600 of 1.5, harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min, and resuspended in 4 ml of buffer/g of cells in MOPS 1The abbreviations used are: MOPS3-(N-morpholino)-propanesulfonic acidACMA9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridineDCCDN,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimideCCCPcarbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone.-Mg buffer (50 mm MOPS, 10 mm MgCl2), pH 7.0. Cells were lysed by two passages through a French pressure cell at 16,000 p.s.i. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the membranes were collected by centrifugation at 38,000 × g for 1 h. Membrane pellets were resuspended in the starting volume of MOPS-Mg buffer containing 10% glycerol and again centrifuged for 1 h at 38,000 × g. At this stage the pellets could be frozen at -80 °C and remained stable for several weeks. For assays, membranes were resuspended in MOPS-Mg buffer to a final concentration of ∼25 mg/ml membrane protein. 3-(N-morpholino)-propanesulfonic acid 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone. ATP Synthesis Assay—The reaction was carried out in freshly made MOPS-Mg buffer, pH 7.5, in a final volume of 10 ml. Reactions were typically run at room temperature (22 °C). Vesicles (0.5 mg of membrane protein) were incubated with vigorous stirring for 2 min prior to the addition of NADH and then for 1 min in the presence of 2.5 mm NADH to allow the proton gradient to establish equilibrium before initiating ATP synthesis. Synthesis was initiated by the addition of ADP and Pi (100 μl of final volume added). At 10, 20, 30, and 40 s, 100-μl aliquots were removed and transferred to 400 μl of stop solution (1% trichloroacetic acid, 2 mm EDTA). To measure the ATP in each sample, 100 μl of Tris acetate buffer (100 mm Tris-HOAc, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.75) was added to a luminometer cuvette. Fifty microliters of luciferin/luciferase reagent (ATP bioluminescence assay kit CLS II, Roche Applied Science) were added to the cuvette, and the background signal (typically 0.0-0.1 mV) was read from the luminometer (LKB Wallac model 1250, Amersham Biosciences). An aliquot, typically 2 μl, of the stopped reaction mix was added, and the peak signal in the luminometer was recorded. Ten microliters of ATP (1.7 pmol of ATP) were subsequently added as an internal standard, and the new peak signal was recorded. The amount of ATP synthesized was calculated from a standard curve and corrected for quenching based on the internal standard. For all samples this quenching was less than 10%. ATP synthesis was linear over the 40 s under all conditions. Fluorescence quenching assays to measure proton gradients were conducted as previously described (11Tomashek J.J. Poposki J.A. Brusilow W.S.A. Arch. Biochemistry Biophys. 2001; 387: 180-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), with the ACMA concentration as indicated in the figures. Kinetic data were plotted as previously described (12Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady State Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, New York1975: 18-50Google Scholar). The Optimized ATP Synthase Assay—Our assay uses the proton-pumping NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I, product of the nuo operon) to pre-energize the membranes before the addition of synthase substrates (see under “Materials and Methods”). Fig. 1 shows a time course of ATP synthesis. A 1-min preincubation of vigorously stirred membrane vesicles with NADH produces an increase of 20-25% in the rate of ATP synthesis compared with a reaction in which NADH, ADP, and Pi were added simultaneously. Pretreatment of the membranes with 100 μm DCCD inhibits synthesis by >95% as does the inclusion of 1 mm CCCP in the reaction. Fig. 1 shows only the data from DCCD-treated cells, but the DCCD and CCCP curves are indistinguishable on this scale. Both DCCD and CCCP are added to membranes as ethanol solutions. The actual activities measured in this experiment were 0.52 μmol/min/mg for untreated membranes, 0.51 μmol/min/mg for ethanol-treated membranes, 0.012 μmol/min/mg for DCCD-treated membranes, and 0.005 μmol/min/mg for the reaction conducted in the presence of CCCP. These results show that vesicles are capable of respiration-driven ATP synthesis that is sensitive to both a protonophore and to a specific inhibitor of the ATPase. Preincubation with NADH significantly improves reaction rates. We tested a range of NADH concentrations and preincubation times and measured reduced ATP synthesis at either higher (5 mm, 7.5 mm) or lower (1.25 mm) NADH concentrations and for longer preincubation times (data not shown). A 1-min preincubation in 2.5 mm NADH produced the highest rates of synthesis. We routinely measure synthesis activity of 0.40-0.50 μmol/min/mg at room temperature (22 °C). We have also confirmed that there is negligible ATP present or synthesized 1) when the membranes are not energized, 2) without the addition of substrates, or 3) when the membranes are from strain LE392 Δ(uncI-uncC) (data not shown). The proton gradient behaves as a third substrate in the synthetic reaction. Therefore, before beginning a comprehensive kinetic analysis, we determined whether the proton gradient established by the electron transport chain was limiting. Research on plastidic enzymes, reproducibly energized with light, has shown that the Vmax of the synthesis reaction, but not the substrate Km values, is affected by variation of the ΔμH+ (13Strotmann H. Thelen R. Müller W. Baum W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 879-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Furthermore, extensive studies of mitochondria using the electron transport chain energized with either NADH or succinate have shown this method of energization is sufficient for valid kinetic analyses (14Yagi T. Matsuno-Yagi A. Vik S.B. Hatefi Y. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1029-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To examine the relationship between the proton gradient and the synthase activity, we performed our standard ATP synthase assay in the fluorimetric cuvette with ACMA to measure the proton gradient (Fig. 2). The experiment shown was performed in one-tenth the volume and with 10 times the amount of membrane and NADH to increase the signal to noise ratio. However, we also performed the experiment under conditions essentially identical to those for measuring synthesis rates (data not shown), and except for the higher noise, the results were the same. After pre-energizing with NADH, the addition of the synthase substrates (ADP + Pi) results in normal, maximal synthesis of ATP with no detectable deflection of the steady state proton gradient, as indicated by an unchanging fluorescence. This experiment demonstrates that once a proton gradient is established, the respiratory chain can respond to additional proton translocation during maximum ATP synthesis so that as the enzyme synthesizes ATP the resultant proton movement does not diminish the transmembrane protonmotive force under the conditions of these fluorescence quenching assays. Velocity Dependence on Concentration of ADP and Pi—To examine the effect of substrate concentrations on the rate of synthesis we conducted 49 ATP synthase assays, a matrix of seven concentrations for each substrate, covering a concentration range of 2 orders of magnitude for each. The primary velocity data are shown by the symbols in Fig. 3, A and B. Shown beneath the primary velocity plots are the analytical plots: double-reciprocal (C and D) and Eadie-Scatchard (E and F). We provide these for easy comparison with previously published literature. It is immediately obvious that for ADP the analytical plots are not linear and are apparently biphasic. The concave-down pattern in the double-reciprocal plots and the concave-up pattern in the Eadie-Scatchard plots typically indicate negative cooperativity of binding. For Pi, the double-reciprocal plots appear linear, but the Eadie-Scatchard plots reveal that at high concentrations of ADP, Pi appears to show negative cooperativity with either no cooperativity or positive cooperativity at lower concentrations of ADP. The affinity of the enzyme for both ADP and Pi depends on the concentration of the other substrate. From linear regression analysis of the double-reciprocal plots, we calculated an apparent KmPi of 150-450 μm, depending on the [ADP] (Fig. 3H). These values are lower than previously reported values (15Al-Shawi M.K. Ketchum C.J. Nakamoto R.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12961-12969Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 16Fischer S. Etzold C. Turina P. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Altendorf K. Gräber P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 17Wise J.G. Senior A.E.

Biochem. 1997; 243: 336-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For ADP we calculated separate apparent Km values for [ADP] of ≤166 μm and for [ADP] of ≥166 μm because of the apparent biphasic nature of the secondary plots. The apparent Km values are KmADP<166 ≈ 10 μm and KmADP>166 ≈ 60 μm, although this latter value rises sharply for [Pi] of <100 μm (Fig. 3G). These KmADP values are similar to those reported under conditions of saturating Pi (6Gresser M.J. Myers J.A. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12030-12038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Etzold C. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Altendorf K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 336-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 19Stroop S.D. Boyer P.D. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2304-2310Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 20Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14424-14427Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The apparent Vmax as a function of [Pi] is fairly constant (400 nmol of ATP/min/mg of protein) when [ADP] is >83 μm; below that level, it drops sharply. The apparent Vmax values for ADP at low and high [ADP] both show a smooth increase from low to high [Pi]. At the highest [Pi] for [ADP] of ≤166 μm, however, the apparent Vmax[Pi]=3200 = 341 nmol of ATP/min/mg of protein, whereas for [ADP] ≥166 μm the apparent Vmax[Pi]=3200 = 471 nmol of ATP/min/mg of protein. As seen in the data shown in Fig. 1 we occasionally have preparations with slightly higher activities. Studies of mitochondria and chloroplasts have dominated research on the kinetics of ATP synthesis by the F-type proton-translocating ATPase/synthases. Here we examine synthesis kinetics by the model enzyme found in E. coli. These data compare favorably with what has been observed previously, and they provide a new perspective for understanding the mechanism of the ATP synthase. The interactions of the enzyme with ADP and phosphate are obviously complex and inter-related. We have attempted to use our data to develop a detailed kinetic model for ATP synthesis with limited success, so we do not present it at this time. In addition to showing negative cooperativity and the biphasic nature of the enzyme-ADP interaction, our data clearly demonstrate the dependence of the Km for each substrate on the concentration of the other substrate. Increasing the concentration of either ADP or Pi reduces the Km for the other substrate. We replotted the data from Fig. 3, G and H, to measure how the concentrations of ADP and Pi affected the specificity constant, Vmax/Km, for the other substrate. Fig. 4 shows that at high ADP concentrations the Vmax/Km for ADP does not change with increasing Pi, but at lower ADP concentrations the Vmax/Km is strongly affected by the concentration of Pi. Because Pi increases the affinity of the enzyme for ADP and competes for binding to the enzyme with ATP but not ADP, these data support the idea that under certain physiological conditions phosphate can stimulate ATP synthesis even under conditions of relatively high intracellular ATP concentrations (3Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 300-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We also plotted the Vmax/Km for ADP versus [ADP] at two saturating concentrations of Pi. Fig. 5 shows that the Vmax/Km for ADP increases as the concentration of ADP decreases. Therefore, the enzyme is a better enzyme for ADP at lower ADP concentrations.Fig. 5Influence of ADP concentration on the Vmax/Km for ADP. The velocity versus substrate data for ADP collected in the presence of 3.2 mm Pi (▪) and 1.6 mm Pi (•) were used to calculate a Vmax and Km for each of five ADP concentrations, 664, 322, 166, 83, and 41.5 μm. Each set of values was calculated from a three-point linear reciprocal plot of the enzyme velocity at that ADP concentration and at the two adjacent ADP concentrations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We believe that this assay can help distinguish differences between the first order hydrolytic reaction and the second order synthetic reaction. During hydrolysis, it has been shown that all three sites of the E. coli F1-ATPase are occupied by nucleotide under conditions of rapid catalysis (8Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35422-35428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Whether this occupation is necessary for catalysis has been a topic of much debate (22Milgrom Y.M. Murataliev M.B. Boyer P.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1037-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 23Boyer P.D. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 39-42Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 24Senior A.E. Nadanaciva S. Weber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1553: 188-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). For the synthetic direction, having two substrates complicates the matter of site occupation. The biphasic nature of our data shows that whereas binding of ADP at the third site increases the Vmax of the enzyme this is not necessary for the enzyme to proceed with catalysis. Full occupation of two sites appears sufficient to promote complete catalysis and release of ATP especially because the Vmax/Km for ADP is higher at lower ADP concentrations whereas binding to the third site would be minimal. Occupation of the third site by ADP would further stimulate the rate. We therefore conclude that the enzyme can operate as a synthase in essentially two states: 1) under conditions of low intracellular ADP the enzyme has a lower Vmax but a significantly higher Vmax/Km for ADP, i.e. it is a better enzyme for ADP and is activated by increased Pi; and 2) under conditions of higher intracellular ADP the enzyme has a lower Vmax/Km for ADP and does not respond to changes in Pi but has a higher Vmax. Work on both the mitochondrial and plastidic enzymes have demonstrated a similar phenomenon. Research using submitochondrial particles from bovine heart mitochondria have demonstrated a two-Vmax, two-Km phenomenon similar to that which we observed for E. coli (14Yagi T. Matsuno-Yagi A. Vik S.B. Hatefi Y. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1029-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 20Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14424-14427Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Studies on plastids have also shown that binding of ADP to the third site increases the Vmax of the enzyme (7Zhou J.-M. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1531-1538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Boyer P.D. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 39-42Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Experimentally, conditions necessary to achieve a high, “three-site” Vmax would probably depend on the ΔΔμH+, which is a function of the rate of proton gradient formation by the respiratory chain and the rate of consumption by the ATP synthase as well as the volume of the membrane vesicles, vesicle leakiness, and the density of gradient-generating and -consuming proteins per unit area of membrane. The steady state ΔμH+ may, however, be only slightly affected as seen in the ACMA fluorescence-quenching data in Fig. 2 and in studies by other laboratories (14Yagi T. Matsuno-Yagi A. Vik S.B. Hatefi Y. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1029-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Previously, Etzold et al. (18Etzold C. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Altendorf K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 336-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) used the luciferase assay to measure the turnover number of the ATP synthase during synthesis by membrane vesicles of E. coli. They measured ATP synthesis rates of ∼0.060-0.10 μmol/min/mg of membrane protein at room temperature and 0.20 μmol/min/mg of membrane protein at 37 °C. They found that F1F0 makes up 3.3% of the E. coli membrane proteins, giving a turnover number of 13-33 s-1, considerably lower than those of other F-type ATPase complexes measured under optimal conditions. Specifically, they cited several studies of submitochondrial particles that gave turnover values of 400-600 s-1 and also studies in chloroplasts that produced turnover numbers of 200 s-1. Using an innovative approach they tested the hypothesis that the lower value produced by the E. coli ATPase was caused by an imbalance between the amount of enzyme and the respiratory capacity of the vesicles and that far more synthase existed than could be activated by the respiratory chain. In support of this hypothesis, they demonstrated that the turnover could be increased to 270 s-1 by inactivating a percentage of the ATPase with DCCD in order to produce a greater respiratory driving force for the remaining active, unmodified enzymes. Additionally, in vivo studies on growth rate and yield of E. coli containing increased or decreased amounts of ATPase also concluded that cells contain an excess capacity of enzyme and that decreasing the amount of ATPase resulted in an increase in the turnover number during synthesis (25Jensen P.R. Westerhoff H.V. Michelsen O. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1277-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In comparison, Al-Shawi et al. (15Al-Shawi M.K. Ketchum C.J. Nakamoto R.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12961-12969Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) measured turnover numbers in wild type membranes of 82 s-1 for ATP synthesis in non-DCCD-treated membranes and 425 s-1 for ATP hydrolysis. In our in vitro system, the NADH-driven steady state protonmotive force appears unaffected by maximum synthesis rates. After the protonmotive force has been established during the preincubation with NADH, the respiratory chain is able to respond to proton translocation by the synthase by pumping additional protons essentially in a one-for-one exchange. Furthermore, using the values from Etzold et al. (18Etzold C. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Altendorf K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 336-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) of 3.3% for the fraction of membrane protein made up of F1F0, our value of ∼0.5 μmol/min/mg of membrane protein translates into a turnover number at room temperature of 160 s-1. At 37 °C the value becomes greater than 200 s-1 (data not shown), which is comparable with the value cited for the chloroplast enzyme. It therefore appears as if, under these conditions, the ATPase is not present in excess of the respiratory capacity of the membrane vesicles. We cannot say what accounts for the significant (although less than 10-fold) difference in turnover number between these and previous studies (15Al-Shawi M.K. Ketchum C.J. Nakamoto R.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12961-12969Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 18Etzold C. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Altendorf K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 336-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The coupled assay depends on the activities of the ATPase and the enzymes of the respiratory chain in addition to the permeability of the membrane vesicles. Therefore, strain-specific differences in enzyme concentrations and activities and differences in the growth of cells or preparation of membrane vesicles, combined with the enhanced activity resulting from preincubation of vesicles with NADH, might all contribute to the differences in activities. Whatever the reason(s), this improved ATP synthase assay uses a NADH-driven protonmotive force that is unchanged even during maximum rates of ATP synthesis, enabling us to measure and dissect the kinetics of ATP synthesis in more detail than has previously been possible for E. coli.

https://openalex.org/W2145144258,"Expression of genes encoding structural myelin proteins marks the inception of the myelinating Schwann cell (SC) phenotype. Earlier embryonic SC as well as adult non-myelinating SC produce the intermediate filament glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP), which disappears from the myelinating SC. We previously observed that triggering of the gp130 receptor system by the IL6RIL6 ligand, comprising interleukin-6 (IL-6) fused to the soluble IL-6 receptor, induces myelin gene expression in rat embryonic dorsal root ganglia (DRG) cultures as well as in the murine melanoma cell line B16/F10.9. Study of target genes regulated by IL6RIL6 indicates a strong and selective induction of the transcriptional regulator C/EBP-δ in DRG cultures and in the F10.9 cell line. As shown here, silencing of C/EBP-δ mRNA and protein expression by introduction of small interference RNA-producing plasmids in the F10.9 cells prevented the induction of myelin protein zero (P0) and myelin basic protein (MBP) mRNAs by IL6RIL6. Doxycycline-regulated overexpression of C/EBP-δ was sufficient to induce accumulation of P0 and MBP mRNAs, the effect being selective, because C/EBP-δ did not affect several other genes strongly regulated by IL6RIL6. Interestingly, GFAP was inhibited by C/EBP-δ overexpression, leading to a modulation of the ratio between myelin gene products versus GFAP and suggesting that C/EBP-δ plays a role in the switch to a myelinating phenotype. The down-regulation of Pax3, also typical of the transition to myelinating cells, was observed after C/EBP-δ expression in correlation to P0 induction and to decrease of melanogenesis and cell growth. In cultures of dissociated cells of embryonic rat DRG, where we knocked-down the C/EBP-δ mRNA, we found an inhibition of P0 mRNA induction by IL6RIL6, showing that the role of C/EBP-δ on this myelin gene is not unique to the melanoma system."

TF is assumed to function alone as a ∼45-kDa monomer and is composed of three domains: an N-terminal unstructured domain containing a highly conserved ribosome-binding motif (called TF signature; GFRXGXXP, X can be varied) (6Kramer G.

TF has been shown to have a broad binding specificity and interact with both cytoplasmic and secretary nascent polypeptide chains which are as short as 57 residues (4Hesterkamp T. Hauser S. Lutcke H. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4437-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). TF assists the folding of RNase T1 by catalyzing isomerization of the proline residues, suppresses aggregation of glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and binds small peptides with low affinity (16Scholz C.

As demonstrated in experiments using permanently unfolded protein, the interaction of TF with unfolded protein is dynamic; TF binds and releases unfolded protein rapidly (19Maier R. Scholz C. Schmid F.X. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 1181-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The interaction of TF with substrate protein is independent of the presence of proline residues (17Huang G.C. Li Z.Y. Zhou J.M. Fischer G.

To gain insights into the mechanism of functions of TF, we have investigated the interactions between TF and denatured proteins by using TF from a thermophilic eubacterium, Thermus thermophilus (Tth-TF). Tth-TF arrests spontaneous folding of proteins, by forming a binary complex with denatured proteins, the complex can be isolated by gel-filtration. More importantly, formation of the binary complex is dependent on Zn2+ inherent in TF. Isolation of Tth-TF—Chromosomal DNA from T. thermophilus strain HB8 was isolated as described previously (23Motohashi K. Yohda M. Endo I. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17343-17348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A gene encoding Tth-TF was amplified by PCR to generate NdeI and EcoRI sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, of the coding region of Tth-TF. The digested PCR fragment was inserted between NdeI and EcoRI sites of pET23c, creating pET23c/TF. E. coli strain BL21(DE3), bearing plasmid pET23c/TF, was cultured at 37 °C for 16 h, and collected by centrifugation. Cells were suspended in 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, and disrupted by a French press. The crude extract was incubated for 10 min at 60 °C and centrifuged at 120,000 g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to a DEAE Toyopearl column (Tosoh, Tokyo), and eluted with 0-500 mm linear gradient of KCl in 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5. Fractions containing Tth-TF were pooled and supplemented with ammonium sulfate (1.3 m in final concentration). The solution was applied to a Phenyl Toyopearl column (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated in 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, containing 1.3 m ammonium sulfate. The column was eluted with 1.3-0 m linear reverse gradient of ammonium sulfate in 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5. Fractions of pure Tth-TF were dialyzed against 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, and stored at -80 °C until use. Other Proteins—A mutant GFP (F99S/M153T/V163A) that shows improved folding efficiency was used throughout this work and is termed GFP for simplicity. GFP and Tth-GroEL-GroES were purified as described previously (24Sakikawa C. Taguchi H. Makino Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21251-21256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 25Taguchi H. Konishi J. Ishii N. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22411-22418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RNase A and α-casein were purchased from Roche and Sigma, respectively. GFP Folding Assay—GFP (10 μm) was denatured in 50 mm glycine-H2SO4, pH 2.0, at room temperature for 2 min and diluted 100-fold with 1.2 ml of 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 200 mm KCl containing Tth-TF at indicated concentrations, or other components indicated. Increase in fluorescence at 510 nm with excitation light at 395 nm was monitored continuously with a fluorometer (FP-6500, Jasco, Tokyo, Japan). The reaction mixtures were stirred at 50 °C throughout the experiments. Gel Filtration Analysis—Acid-denatured GFP (100 μm) was diluted 20-fold with 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 200 mm KCl containing Tth-TF and incubated for 10 min at 50 °C. Final concentrations of Tth-TF in the mixtures were 10 μm (Fig. 3C) and 5 μm (Fig. 5B). The sample solutions (100 μl) were applied to a gel-filtration HPLC (Superdex™ 200HR10/300, ID 10 mm × 300 mm, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 200 mm KCl, and eluted at room temperature at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The absorbance at 280 nm and the GFP fluorescence (Ex 395 nm/Em 510 nm) were monitored. Fractions that were collected every 1 min were concentrated by Ultra-free-MC (Millipore) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Intensities of stained protein bands were quantified by Scion image (rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/), and the amount of proteins in each band was estimated by referring to the band intensities of control proteins of known quantities.Fig. 5Folding-arrest activity and binary complex formation of Zn2+-saturated Tth-TF with denatured GFP. A, effect of Zn2+-saturated Tth-TF and Zn2+-depleted Tth-TF on the folding of GFP. The concentrations of Zn2+-saturated Tth-TF, Zn2+-depleted Tth-TF, and GFP in the mixtures were 0.12, 0.1, and 0.1 μm, respectively. Other experimental procedures were the same as described in the legend of Fig. 1A. B, dependence of the degree of the GFP-folding arrest on the concentration of Zn2+-saturated Tth-TF.

Other experimental procedures were the same as those described in the legend of Fig. 2C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Element Analysis—Element analysis of metal ions bound to Tth-TF was carried out with inductively coupled plasma spectrometry (ICPS) (ICPS-8100, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The 1-element standards (Merck) were used for calibration, and 50 mm HEPES-KOH buffer, pH 7.5, treated with Chilex-100 (BioRad), was used as a metal-free control. Preparation of Zn2+-depleted and Zn2+-saturated Tth-TF—To remove endogenously bound Zn2+ from the purified Tth-TF, Tth-TF was denatured in 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, containing 6 m guanidine-HCl and 1 mm EDTA at room temperature. The denatured TF solution was dialyzed against 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA at 4 °C to allow refolding, and then applied twice to a desalting column (PD-10, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5. To obtain Zn2+-saturated Tth-TF, the Zn2+-depleted Tth-TF prepared as above was denatured in 50 mm HEPESKOH, pH 7.5, containing 6 m guanidine-HCl, and the mixture was supplemented with 1 mm Zn(CH3COO)2. The denatured Tth-TF was dialyzed against 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm Zn(CH3COO)2 at 4 °C to allow refolding and the solution was applied twice to a desalting column (PD-10) equilibrated with 50 mm HEPESKOH, pH 7.5, to remove free Zn2+. Titration of Zn2+-binding to Zn2+-depleted Tth-TF—The solution containing 40 μm Zn2+-depleted Tth-TF, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, and the indicated concentration of Zn(CH3COO)2 was placed on ice for overnight and applied to a 1-ml centrifuge-spin column of Sephadex G-50 equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8 (26Cross R.L. Nalin C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2874-2881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To the pass-through protein fraction, 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol was added at a final concentration of 100 μm and absorption at 500 nm was measured (27Banecki B. Wawrzynow A. Puzewicz J. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18843-18848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The amount of Zn2+ derived from TF was calculated using the standard calibration line. Other Methods—Concentrations of Tth-TF and GFP were determined spectrophotometrically. Extinction coefficients at 280 nm used for Tth-TF and GFP were 64,000 and 20,600 m-1 cm-1, respectively. The value for Tth-TF was determined by the quantitative amino acid analysis. The value for GFP was calculated based on the amino acid composition. Concentrations of other proteins were determined by the Bradford method with bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-PAGE was carried out using gels containing 13% acrylamide and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Isolation of TF from T. thermophilus—We searched for trigger factor (TF) homolog in the whole genome information of Thermus thermophilus, and found a gene encoding a protein with 404 residues (GenBank™ accession number AB125633) whose amino acid sequence showed similarity to that of E. coli TF (21% identity) (Fig. 1). The N-terminal domain of the protein had a TF signature sequence (X2/X9, 42GFRPGKAP48, underlined residues are conserved) that is essential for ribosome binding. Therefore, we concluded that this gene encoded the T. thermophilus TF (Tth-TF). We cloned the Tth-TF gene and overexpressed the protein in E. coli in the soluble fraction from which Tth-TF was purified to homogeneity. Amino acid sequencing of the purified Tth-TF gave the expected N-terminal sequence (MVAEILERSG). To confirm in vivo expression of Tth-TF in T. thermophilus, polyclonal antibody raised against the recombinant Tth-TF was used to estimate cellular contents of Tth-TF in the soluble fraction of T. thermophilus. Western blotting showed that about 0.2% of the soluble proteins were Tth-TF (data not shown). Tth-TF Inhibits Spontaneous Folding of Denatured Proteins—To check whether Tth-TF interacts with denatured proteins, we investigated the effects of Tth-TF on spontaneous folding of GFP by monitoring appearance of fluorescence (28Makino Y. Amada K. Taguchi H. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12468-12474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). When acid-denatured GFP, which has no fluorescence, was diluted into the buffer at neutral pH, the fluorescence was recovered spontaneously (Fig. 2A). At 50 °C, the yield of spontaneous folding was estimated to be ∼50% from the magnitude of recovered fluorescence. When Tth-TF was present in the dilution buffer, the recovery of fluorescence was reduced (Fig. 2A). Degree of the reduction increased in parallel with the amount of added Tth-TF; the 3.3-fold molar excess of Tth-TF completely suppressed the spontaneous folding of GFP. The folding-arrest by Tth-TF was not restricted to GFP. Guanidine-HCl denatured isopropyl malate dehydrogenase from T. thermophilus folded spontaneously at 25 °Cat ∼50% yield (25Taguchi H. Konishi J. Ishii N. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22411-22418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). But in the case where 12-fold molar excess of Tth-TF was present in the buffer, the spontaneous folding of isopropyl malate dehydrogenase was completely arrested (data not shown). Isolation of the Binary Complex of Tth-TF with Denatured GFP—We analyzed the folding mixture described in the previous section by gel-filtration HPLC (Fig. 3). The purified Tth-TF alone was eluted as a peak of ∼60 kDa, likely corresponding to the monomeric state (Fig. 3A), and native GFP was eluted as a peak of ∼30 kDa (Fig. 3B). When the mixture containing the folding-arrested GFP was analyzed, about half of Tth-TF was eluted as a new peak of ∼100 kDa (Fig. 3C). This new peak might correspond to the binary complex between Tth-TF and denatured GFP and, to confirm this, the protein components of the eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As expected, the ∼100 kDa peak fractions contained both Tth-TF and GFP (Fig. 3C). Based on the staining intensities of the bands calibrated individually with those of standard amounts of Tth-TF and GFP, the molar ratio of Tth-TF and GFP in the complex was estimated to be 1.0:1. The in-line monitoring of fluorescence of the gel-filtration HPLC showed that there was no GFP fluorescence at the ∼100 kDa peak areas, suggesting that the GFP in the binary complex with Tth-TF was in a non-fluorescent denatured state. Taken together, we conclude that Tth-TF arrests the spontaneous folding of GFP by forming a binary complex with denatured GFP. The interaction between E. coli TF and denatured proteins have been reported (17Huang G.C. Li Z.Y. Zhou J.M. Fischer G. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1254-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 18Patzelt H. Rudiger S. Brehmer D. Kramer G. Vorderwulbecke S. Schaffitzel E. Waitz A. Hesterkamp T. Dong L.

Acta. 2000; 1480: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) but, as far as we know, the binary complex between TF and substrate protein was isolated for the first time. Dynamic Nature of the Binary Complex—When excess amount of α-casein, a permanently unfolded protein, was added to the mixtures containing the folding-arrested GFP, folding of GFP resumed (Fig. 2B). The folding rate increased as the amount of added α-casein increased even though it was still slower than the rate of spontaneous folding when 187-fold molar excess of α-casein (550 μg) was added. On the contrary, native protein, such as RNase A, did not relieve the folding-arrest at all. These results suggest that the binary complex is in dynamic equilibrium between associated and dissociated forms. In the presence of excess α-casein, the binding site of Tth-TF might be filled with α-casein more often than denatured GFP, and denatured GFP can stay longer in the bulk solution where it initiates folding. This contention was further examined by the effect of chaperonin GroEL-GroES on the binary complex of Tth-TF and denatured GFP. We previously demonstrated that chaperonin from T. thermophilus (Tth-GroEL-GroES) mediated the folding of GFP in an ATP-dependent manner. The addition of Tth-GroEL-GroES to the mixture containing the folding-arrested GFP folding did not induce GFP folding but subsequent addition of ATP triggered GFP folding (Fig. 2C). It appears that as soon as the denatured GFP dissociates from Tth-TF, it is immediately trapped by Tth-GroEL-GroES where it initiates folding. Dynamic nature of the binary complex might seem contradictory to the fact that the binary complex can be isolated by gel-filtration. However, if the association is much more rapid than the dissociation (a small dissociation constant) and the flow rate of elution as well as the sample volume relative to the column bed volume is large, then even the complex in dynamic equilibrium can be isolated by gel-filtration. Requirement of Divalent Cation for the Activity of Tth-TF— During the course of the present study, we noticed that Tth-TF purified in the buffer containing EDTA had no or little folding-arrest activity (data not shown). Indeed, the folding of GFP resumed by addition of EDTA to the mixture in which folding of GFP had been arrested by Tth-TF (data not shown). These effects of EDTA strongly suggest requirement of divalent cation for the folding-arrest activity of Tth-TF. Therefore, we determined contents of divalent cations in our Tth-TF preparation by element analysis with the ICPS. The element analysis revealed that one mol of the purified Tth-TF contained 0.47 atoms of Zn. Other metals were negligible; 0.07 atoms of Cu, 0.02 atoms of Fe, undetectable levels of Mg, Mn, Ca, Co, and Cd. When O-phenanthroline, which preferentially chelates Zn2+ ion, was included in the assay mixture, Tth-TF failed to arrest the folding of GFP (data not shown). Half occupancy of Zn2+ in the purified Tth-TF prompted us to prepare Tth-TF that completely lost Zn2+. Tth-TF was denatured in 6 m guanidine-HCl and 1 mm EDTA, and refolded in a buffer containing EDTA. The resultant Zn2+-depleted Tth-TF failed to arrest GFP folding; ∼90% of GFP spontaneously folded in the presence of equal molar Zn2+-depleted Tth-TF (Fig. 5A). There was a possibility that Zn2+ would be required for stabilization of protein conformation of Tth-TF at a high temperature, 50 °C, rather than for folding-arrest activity itself. However, this possibility was unlikely because circular dichroism spectra (195-350 nm) of Tth-TF at 50 °C were not affected by the presence and absence of Zn2+ (data not shown). In addition, the Zn2+-dependent folding-arrest activity of Tth-TF was also observed at a lower temperature, 25 °C (data not shown). 1:1 Binding of Zn2+ to Tth-TF—We also prepared Zn2+-saturated Tth-TF. The Zn2+-depleted Tth-TF was denatured, supplemented with 1 mm Zn2+, refolded in a Zn2+-containing buffer, and separated from free Zn2+ by gel-filtration. The element analysis showed that the isolated Zn2+-saturated Tth-TF contained 1.3 atoms of Zn per mol of TF. The spectroscopic titration of bound divalent cations with a chelate reagent, 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol, confirmed the 1:1 binding of Zn2+ to Tth-TF (Fig. 4). The isolated Zn2+-saturated Tth-TF completely arrested the GFP folding at 1.2:1 (Tth-TF/GFP) molar ratio (Fig. 5A). Titration of the arrest yield of GFP folding versus various amount of Tth-TF gave a hyperbolic saturation curve with an apparent dissociation constant of the Tth-TF-GFP complex, 9 nm (Fig. 5B). The original untreated Tth-TF preparation required more than 2 moles of Tth-TF to achieve the complete folding-arrest of GFP (see Fig. 2A) and an apparent dissociation constant of 20 nm was obtained from the titration that was consistent with half occupancy of Zn2+ in the original Tth-TF preparation. In contrast to Fig. 2C, gel-filtration analysis of the Zn2+-saturated Tth-TF mixture of the arrested folding gave an elution pattern in which most Tth-TF was eluted as a binary complex with small tailing elution (Fig. 5C). Association of denatured GFP with Tth-TF at the peak fraction was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis and the Tth-TF: GFP molar ratio in the complex was estimated to be 1:0.8. These results lead to the conclusion that the folding-arrest activity of Tth-TF is dependent on Zn2+ bound to Tth-TF. Conclusion—In the present study, we have shown that Tth-TF arrests the spontaneous folding of denatured GFP and isopropyl malate dehydrogenase by forming a 1:1 binary complex, which can be isolated by gel-filtration but is in dynamic equilibrium between associated and dissociated forms. The stable but dynamic nature of the binary complex may be important for function of chaperones that do not utilize ATP in binding regulation (19Maier R. Scholz C. Schmid F.X. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 1181-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Stable nature helps TF to bind all the nascent substrate proteins at the exit of ribosome tunnel and dynamic nature enables TF to transfer the bound polypeptide to the next more efficient chaperones, which use ATP for binding regulation, such as GroEL. Another important message of this report is that the folding-arrest activity of Tth-TF is dependent on stoichiometric amount of bound Zn2+. Typical Zn2+-binding motif, such as Cys-rich zinc-finger motif in SecA, DnaJ, and Hsp33 or HEXXH motif in metallo proteinases (30Jakob U. Eser M. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2017758314,"Small differences in amplitude, duration, and temporal patterns of change in the concentration of free intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) can profoundly affect cell physiology, altering programs of gene expression, cell proliferation, secretory activity, and cell survival. We report a novel mechanism for amplitude modulation of [Ca2+]i that involves mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). We show that epidermal growth factor (EGF) potentiates gastrin-(1–17) (G17)-stimulated Ca2+ release from intracellular Ca2+ stores through a MAPK-dependent pathway. G17 activation of the cholecystokinin/gastrin receptor (CCK2R), a G protein-coupled receptor, stimulates release of Ca2+ from inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate-sensitive Ca2+ stores. Pretreating rat intestinal epithelial cells expressing CCK2R with EGF increased the level of G17-stimulated Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. The stimulatory effect of EGF on CCK2R-mediated Ca2+ release requires activation of the MAPK kinase (MEK)1,2/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1,2 pathway. Inhibition of the MEK1,2/ERK1,2 pathway by either serum starvation or treatment with selective MEK1,2 inhibitors PD98059 and U0126 or expression of a dominant-negative mutant form of MEK1 decreased the amplitude of the G17-stimulated Ca2+ release response. Activation of the MEK1,2/ERK1,2 pathway either by pretreating cells with EGF or by expression of constitutively active K-ras (K-rasV12G) or MEK1 (MEK1*) increased the amplitude of G17-stimulated Ca2+ release. Although EGF, MEK1*, and K-rasV12G activated the MEK1,2/ERK1,2 pathway, they did not increase [Ca2+]i in the absence of G17. These data demonstrate that the activation state of the MEK1,2/ERK1,2 pathway can modulate the amplitude of the CCK2R-mediated Ca2+ release response and identify a novel mechanism for cross-talk between EGF receptor- and CCK2R-regulated signaling pathways. Small differences in amplitude, duration, and temporal patterns of change in the concentration of free intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) can profoundly affect cell physiology, altering programs of gene expression, cell proliferation, secretory activity, and cell survival. We report a novel mechanism for amplitude modulation of [Ca2+]i that involves mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). We show that epidermal growth factor (EGF) potentiates gastrin-(1–17) (G17)-stimulated Ca2+ release from intracellular Ca2+ stores through a MAPK-dependent pathway. G17 activation of the cholecystokinin/gastrin receptor (CCK2R), a G protein-coupled receptor, stimulates release of Ca2+ from inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate-sensitive Ca2+ stores. Pretreating rat intestinal epithelial cells expressing CCK2R with EGF increased the level of G17-stimulated Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. The stimulatory effect of EGF on CCK2R-mediated Ca2+ release requires activation of the MAPK kinase (MEK)1,2/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1,2 pathway. Inhibition of the MEK1,2/ERK1,2 pathway by either serum starvation or treatment with selective MEK1,2 inhibitors PD98059 and U0126 or expression of a dominant-negative mutant form of MEK1 decreased the amplitude of the G17-stimulated Ca2+ release response. Activation of the MEK1,2/ERK1,2 pathway either by pretreating cells with EGF or by expression of constitutively active K-ras (K-rasV12G) or MEK1 (MEK1*) increased the amplitude of G17-stimulated Ca2+ release. Although EGF, MEK1*, and K-rasV12G activated the MEK1,2/ERK1,2 pathway, they did not increase [Ca2+]i in the absence of G17. These data demonstrate that the activation state of the MEK1,2/ERK1,2 pathway can modulate the amplitude of the CCK2R-mediated Ca2+ release response and identify a novel mechanism for cross-talk between EGF receptor- and CCK2R-regulated signaling pathways.

Calcium is an essential signaling molecule in G17-stimulated cell proliferation. In Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing recombinant CCK2R, an agonist-induced increase in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity and [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA requires a slow oscillatory increase in [Ca2+]i (17.Akagi K. Nagao T. Urushidani T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1452: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the rat pancreatic cancer cell line AR4-2J, a CCK2R-mediated increase in [Ca2+]i is required for formation of the Shc-Grb2-Sos protein complex and subsequent activation of MAPK (18.Daulhac L. Kowalski-Chauvel A. Pradayrol L. Vaysse N. Seva C. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Defining the molecular mechanisms involved in CCK2R regulation of [Ca2+]i is necessary to understand the proliferative effects of G17 on normal and neoplastic cells. Like G17, epidermal growth factor (EGF) also stimulates the proliferation of gastric epithelial cells (19.Miyazaki Y. Shinomura Y. Higashiyama S. Kanayama S. Higashimoto Y. Tsutsui S. Zushi S. Taniguchi N. Matsuzawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 20.Rutten M.J. Dempsey P.J. Solomon T.E. Coffey Jr, R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: G361-G369PubMed Google Scholar), and recently, the G17-related peptide CCK has been shown to synergize with EGF to stimulate DNA synthesis ([3H]thymidine incorporation), cyclin-D3 expression, and retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation in cells expressing both CCK2R and EGF receptors (21.Zhukova E. Sinnett-Smith J. Wong H. Chiu T. Rozengurt E. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 189: 291-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). EGF and the related growth factors transforming growth factor-α and amphiregulin bind to a family of receptors known as type I receptor tyrosine kinases. This family is composed of four related receptors: the EGF receptor (EGFR/ErbB1/HER1), ErbB2 (HER2/neu), ErbB3 (HER3), and ErbB4 (HER4) (22.Jorissen R.N. Walker F. Pouliot N. Garrett T.P. Ward C.W. Burgess A.W. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 31-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar). The synergistic effect of CCK and EGF on regulation of cell cycle progression indicates cross-talk between CCK2R- and EGFR-regulated signaling pathways; however, the point at which their signal transduction pathways converge has not been identified. Because a G17-induced increase in [Ca2+]i is one of the initial events in CCK2R-regulated signal transduction, the aim of this study was to determine the effect of EGF treatment on CCK2R regulation of [Ca2+]i. We report that EGF affects this very early step in CCK2R-mediated signal transduction by potentiating G17-stimulated Ca2+ release from intracellular Ca2+ stores. The potentiating effect of EGF is mediated by the MEK1,2/ERK1,2 pathway. This study identifies a novel mechanism by which changes in the basal activation state of the MEK1,2/ERK1,2 pathway regulate the amplitude of the CCK2 R-mediated Ca2+ release response. Cell Lines—For most experiments, we used a nontransformed rat intestinal epithelial (RIE) cell line expressing recombinant human CCK2R called RIE/CCK2R. These cells were routinely cultured in DMEM supplemented with 400 μg/ml G418 and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C. Other cell lines used included the rat pancreatic cancer cell line AR4-2J, the human prostate cancer cell line PC-3, and the human pancreatic carcinoid cell line BON. AR4-2J cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. PC-3 cells were cultured as recommended by the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). BON cells were cultured as described previously (23.Carraway R.E. Mitra S.P. Evers B.M. Townsend Jr, C.M. Regul. Pept. 1994; 53: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Intracellular Ca2+ Imaging—RIE/CCK2R cells were cultured on 25-mm glass coverslips in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. To load the cells with the Ca2+ indicator dye Fura-2, they were first washed with a physiological medium (KRH) containing NaCl (125 mm), KCl (5 mm), KH2PO4 (1.2 mm), MgSO4 (1.2 mm), CaCl2 (2 mm), glucose (6 mm), HEPES (25 mm), pH 7.4, and then they were incubated with 2 μm Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 50 min at room temperature. Single cell changes in [Ca2+]i were recorded using a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope (Garden City, NY) and a CCD camera (Dage-MTI, Inc., Michigan City, IN). Data points were collected every 1–8 s from ∼35 cells/coverslip and processed using ImageMaster software. Fluorescent ratios were converted into [Ca2+]i using the equation [Ca2+]i nm = Kd((R–Rmin)/(Rmax–R)) × β, as reported previously (48.Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Maximal (Rmax) and minimal (Rmin) values were determined following the addition of either 5 μm ionomycin or 5 mm EGTA, respectively. Analysis of statistical significance was performed using Student's unpaired t test. For multiple comparisons, one-way analysis of variance combined with the Tukey's post hoc test was used (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Values are presented as the mean ± S.E. and are considered significant at p < 0.05. Competition Binding—RIE/CCK2R cells were plated into 24-well plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. After 2 days, cells were cultured in DMEM without FBS for an additional 24 h. Following a 5-min pretreatment with either EGF (1 ng/ml) or vehicle (H2O), the cells were washed with binding buffer (DMEM, 25 mm HEPES, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and then incubated 1 h at room temperature in binding buffer containing 0.05 nm125I-labeled CCK-8 (specific activity = 2200 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and various concentrations of unlabeled CCK-8 (1 pm–1 μm). The binding assay was terminated by rinsing the cells with an ice-cold solution of phosphate-buffered saline and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. After washing, the cells were lysed with 300 μl of 1 m NaOH and transferred to a glass tube. The amount of bound radioactivity was measured in a Cobra II gamma counter (Parkard Instrument Company, Downers Grove, IL). Total binding averaged ∼6% of the total counts added to the assays. Nonspecific binding was defined as the amount of radiolabeled CCK-8 bound to the cells in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled CCK-8. Each data point was determined in triplicate and is represented as the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments. Nonlinear regression analysis was performed using Prism software (GraphPad Software). Western Blotting—RIE/CCK2R cells were plated into 12-well plates at a density of ∼100,000 cells/well in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. After 2 days, cells were incubated with DMEM ± FBS for 24 h, treated as described in the figure legends, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and solubilized in lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C. Protein concentrations of the supernatant were determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit. Protein (10 μg) from each sample was resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with an antibody to the dual phosphorylated forms of ERK1 and ERK2 (Anti-ACTIVE® MAPK, Cat. No. V8031, Promega, Madison, WI). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The total ERK content within the cell extracts was determined using an antibody that recognizes both active and inactive forms of ERK1 and ERK2 (Cat. No. SC-94, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Transient Transfection—RIE/CCK2R cells were grown on coverslips in 6-well plates. After 24 h, cells were transiently co-transfected with 1 μg of one of several mutant expression constructs (constitutively active MEK1 (MEK1*), dominant-negative MEK1 (dnMEK1) (Upstate Biotech, Lake Placid, NY), and K-rasV12G (Dr. Aubrey Thompson, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX)) and 0.1 μg of plasmid containing the cDNA for green fluorescence protein (pEGFP-C1, Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen). Twenty-four h post-transfection, the G17-stimulated Ca2+ response was measured in the EGFP-positive cells as described above. Transfection efficiency ranged from 10 to 20% of the cells and was assessed by counting the number of EGFP-positive cells/total cells in a microscopic field using a ×40 objective. Typically, 6–8 EGFP-positive cells were observed/field. Intracellular Ca2+ measurements were recorded from 32 to 48 EGFP-positive cells/experiment. EGF Potentiates G17-stimulated Increases in [Ca2+]i—The binding of G17 to CCK2R induced a rapid and transient increase in [Ca2+]i in RIE/CCK2R cells (Fig. 1A). To assess the effects of EGF on the G17-stimulated increase in [Ca2+]i, cells were cultured in medium without serum for 24 h. Under these conditions, the amplitude of the G17-induced Ca2+ response decreased by up to 50% (Fig. 1A). However, pretreating the serum-starved cells with EGF (1 ng/ml) reversed the inhibitory effects of serum starvation and increased the amplitude of the G17-stimulated Ca2+ response in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). Simultaneous addition of EGF and G17 (10 nm) had no effect on [Ca2+]i when compared with cells treated with G17 alone; however, pretreating cells for 3, 4, or 5 min with EGF significantly increased the amplitude of the G17-induced Ca2+ response when compared with serum-starved cells (Fig. 1B). Five min of pretreatment with EGF was sufficient to increase the amplitude of the G17-stimulated increase in [Ca2+]i to the level observed in cells continuously cultured in 10% FBS (Fig. 1B). To assess whether the effect of EGF on G17-stimulated increases in [Ca2+]i was mediated by the EGF receptor, we pretreated cells with the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1478. Pretreatment with AG1478 (200 nm) had no effect on G17-stimulated increases in [Ca2+]i when used alone but completely blocked the potentiation effect of EGF on the G17-stimulated Ca2+ response (Fig. 1B). These data indicate that EGF potentiation of the G17-stimulated increases in [Ca2+]i required EGFR activation. Because EGF can activate phospholipase-γ, resulting in the production of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (24.Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar), we assessed whether the potentiation effect of EGF on the G17-stimulated Ca2+ response was due to direct regulation of [Ca2+]i. Pretreating cells with EGF, up to a concentration of 25 ng/ml, had no effect on [Ca2+]i in RIE/CCK2R cells (Fig. 1C), indicating that its potentiation of the G17-stimulated Ca2+ response was not due to parallel regulation of [Ca2+]i. Pretreatment of RIE/CCK2R cells with EGF enhanced the efficacy of the G17-stimulated Ca2+ response but not the sensitivity. Pretreating serum-starved cells with EGF (1 ng/ml) for 5 min significantly increased the amplitude (efficacy) of the Ca2+ response induced by G17 over a broad range of concentrations from 0.01 to 100 nm (Fig. 2A). However, when the Ca2+ data was normalized to a percentage of maximum response there was no effect of EGF pretreatment on the EC50 value of the G17-stimulated Ca2+ response (Fig. 2B), suggesting that EGF was not altering the affinity of G17 for CCK2R. To examine this possibility, we performed a radiolabeled ligand binding analysis with and without pretreating the cells for 5 min with EGF (1 ng/ml). As expected EGF did not alter the IC50 value (affinity) of CCK binding to CCK2R (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the target of EGF action may be downstream of CCK2R. EGF Potentiation of the G17-stimulated Ca2+ Response Is Associated with an Increase in the Levels of Phosphorylated Extracellular Signal-regulated Kinase 1 and 2—An important intracellular signaling pathway regulated by the EGFR family is the mitogen-activated protein kinases. MAPKs are an evolutionarily conserved family of serine-threonine-directed kinases. Five subfamilies of MAPKs have been identified, which include ERK1 and ERK2, the c-Jun N-terminal kinases, the 38-kDa MAPKs, ERK5, and ERK-3s (25.Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2266) Google Scholar). The activities of MAPKs are regulated by upstream MAPK kinases, which are dual-specificity kinases that activate MAPKs by phosphorylating both the tyrosine and threonine residues present in the consensus sequence (TXY). Six MAPK kinase family members have been identified and are designated MEK1 through MEK5 and ERK-3 kinase. In many cell types, EGFR is coupled to the MEK1,2/ERK1,2 MAPK pathway through the Ras family of small GTP-binding proteins (26.Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). Serum starvation reduces the activity of the MEK1,2/ERK1,2 pathway; therefore, we hypothesized that this pathway may mediate the stimulatory effects of EGF on G17-stimulated increases in [Ca2+]i. To test this hypothesis, we first assessed the time and dose dependence of EGF treatment on the level of phosphorylated (activated) ERK1 (pERK1) and ERK2 (pERK2) in serum-starved RIE/CCK2R cells. EGF (1 ng/ml) induced a time- and dose-dependent increase in the levels of pERK1 and pERK2 (Fig. 3). A long exposure film revealed an increase over base-line levels of pERK1 and pERK2 as early as 2 min after EGF treatment (Fig. 3A). A shorter exposure of an extended time course showed that the levels of pERK1 and pERK2 further increased at 10 and 20 min and began to decrease at 30 min (Fig. 3B). A dose-response analysis at 5 min showed a dose-dependent increase in the levels of pERK1 and pERK2 (Fig. 3C). When compared with untreated control cultures, an increase in the levels of pERK1 and pERK2 was detected in cells treated with as little as 0.1 ng/ml EGF for 5 min. Maximum levels of pERK1 and pERK2 were observed in cells treated with 5 ng/ml EGF for 5 min. An assessment of the effects of EGF on G17-stimulated increases in [Ca2+]i revealed a good correspondence between both the time (Fig. 1B) and dose effects of EGF on ERK activation (Fig. 3C) and its potentiation of the G17-stimulated increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 3D). Together, these data suggest that EGF can increase the amplitude of the G17-stimulated Ca2+ response by increasing the activation state of the MEK1,2/ERK1,2 pathway. To further assess the role of the MEK1,2/ERK1,2 pathway in CCK2R regulation of [Ca2+]i, we next determined the effects of modulating the activities of MEK1 and MEK2 on G17-induced increases in [Ca2+]i. Inhibition of MEK1 and MEK2 Blocked the Potentiating Effects of Serum and EGF on G17-stimulated Ca2+ Release— Agonist binding to CCK2R induces an increase in [Ca2+]i that involves both the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate-mediated release of Ca2+ from intracellular Ca2+ stores and the influx of extracellular Ca2+ across the plasma membrane. The total increase in [Ca2+]i induced by G17 is the sum of Ca2+ from these two sources. Because a G17-stimulated release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores is required for Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane, we assessed the effects of MEK1,2 inhibitors on G17-stimulated Ca2+ release from internal stores. The amount of Ca2+ released from intracellular stores can be determined experimentally by bathing the cells in an extracellular solution without added Ca2+ and containing the Ca2+-chelating agent EGTA. Under these conditions, the change in [Ca2+]i induced by G17 stimulation is due to the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores alone. To determine whether the activities of MEK1 and MEK2 were required for G17-stimulated Ca2+ release, RIE/CCK2R cells cultured in 10% FBS were pretreated for 5 min with different concentrations of the MEK inhibitor PD98059. Pretreatment of cells with PD98059 caused a dose-dependent decrease in the amplitude of the G17-stimulated Ca2+ release response (Fig. 4A). A concentration of 1 μm PD98059 reduced the amplitude of the change in [Ca2+]i by 28% (from 310 ± 12.1 nm to 221 ± 12.3 nm) (Fig. 4B). Treatment with 10 μm PD98059 resulted in a 93% reduction in [Ca2+]i. Western blot analysis showed detectable levels of pERK1 and pERK2 in cells cultured in 10% FBS but not in cells pretreated with 10 μm PD98059 for 5 min (Fig. 4B, inset). A similar dose-dependent inhibition of the G17-stimulated Ca2+ release was also observed in cells treated with another inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2, U0126 (data not shown). The specificity of the chemical inhibitors for MEK1 was confirmed by transiently transfecting cells with a dominant-negative (kinase-dead) mutant of MEK1. To identify transfected cells, we co-transfected cells with an expression vector containing the cDNA for EGFP. G17-stimulated Ca2+ release was measured in EGFP-positive cells. When compared with EGFP-positive cells co-transfected with an empty expression vector, EGFP-positive cells co-transfected with dnMEK1 showed a significant decrease in the amplitude of G17-induced Ca2+ release (Fig. 4C). The peak change in [Ca2+]i decreased from 221 ± 24.4 nm (empty vector control) to 38.3 ± 12.2 nm (dnMEK1-transfected) (Fig. 4D). Although both the chemical inhibitors and forced expression of dnMEK1 reduced the peak levels of agonist-stimulated Ca2+ release, neither PD98059 treatment nor dnMEK expression affected base-line [Ca2+]i (Fig. 4, A and C), which is ∼100 nm. Together, these data demonstrate that inhibition of MEK activity is sufficient to reduce the amplitude of the G17-stimulated Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. To determine whether the MEK1,2/ERK1,2 pathway mediates the effect of EGF on CCK2 R-regulated [Ca2+]i, we assessed the effects of PD98059 treatment on EGF-induced potentiation of G17-stimulated Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. First, we determined the effects of PD98059 on the levels of pERK1 and pERK2 in serum-starved RIE/CCK2R cells. A long exposure film showed low levels of pERK1 and pERK2 in serum-starved cells compared with cells cultured in 10% FBS (Fig. 4E, lanes 2 and 1, respectively). Pretreating the cells with PD98059 (10 μm for 5 min) reduced pERK1 and pERK2 to undetectable levels (Fig. 4E, lane 3). Treatment of serum-starved cells with EGF (1 ng/ml for 5 min) stimulated an increase in the levels of pERK1 and pERK2, which was completely blocked by PD98059 (10 μm) (Fig. 4E, lanes 5 and 4, respectively). Analysis of G17-stimulated Ca2+ responses from cells treated the same way showed a good correspondence between the relative levels of pERK1 and pERK2 and the amplitude of the G17-stimulated Ca2+ release response. PD98059 treatment decreased both basal and EGF-stimulated pERK levels in serum-starved cells and also reduced basal and EGF-enhanced G17-stimulated Ca2+ release (Fig. 4F). Neither G17-stimulated Activation of the MEK1,2/ERK1,2 Pathway nor EGF Activation of the Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase Pathway Is Involved in the Potentiation of CCK2R-mediated Ca2+ Response—It is well established that in addition to regulation of [Ca2+]i, CCK2R is coupled to the MEK1,2/ERK1,2 pathway. We reported previously G17-stimulated increases in ERK activation in RIE/CCK2R cells (27.Guo Y.S. Cheng J.Z. Jin G.F. Gutkind J.S. Hellmich M.R. Townsend Jr, C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48755-48763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To determine whether G17 stimulation of the MEK1,2/ERK1,2 pathway plays a role in CCK2 R-mediated Ca2+ release, we compared the time courses of G17-stimulated Ca2+ release and ERK activation (Fig. 5). We found that the G17-stimulated increase in Ca2+ release from intracellular stores preceded a detectable increase in the levels of G17-stimulated ERK activation, suggesting that CCK2R-mediated activation of the MEK1,2/ERK1,2 pathway is not responsible for the potentiation of the G17-induced Ca2+ release response. EGF can activate other pathways in addition to the MEK1,2/ERK1,2 pathway, including the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway (22.Jorissen R.N. Walker F. Pouliot N. Garrett T.P. Ward C.W.

To assess the possible involvement of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway in EGF potentiation of G17-stimulated Ca2+ release, we pretreated cells cultured in 10% FBS with two commonly used inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, wortmannin and LY294002. Unlike the MEK inhibitors, which blocked the potentiation effect of EGF on G17-stimulated Ca2+ release, neither wortmannin (100 nm) nor LY294002 (10 μm) effected EGF potentiation of G17-stimulated Ca2+ release (Fig. 6). Wortmannin and LY294002 also had no effect on G17-stimulated Ca2+ release in the absence of EGF (Fig. 6). Together, the data support the conclusion that EGF potentiates CCK2 R-mediated Ca2+ release from intracellular stores by increasing the activation state of the MEK1,2/ERK1,2 pathway. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of PD98059 on G17-stimulated Ca2+ release in the absence of EGF suggests that altering the basal activation state of the MEK1,2/ERK1,2 pathway may be sufficient to modulate the efficacy of the G17-stimula"
