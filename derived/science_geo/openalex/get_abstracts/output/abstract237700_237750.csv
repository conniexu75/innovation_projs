https://openalex.org/W2095686972,"Arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) has shown considerable efficacy in treating hematological malignancies with induction of programmed cell death (PCD) type I, apoptosis. However, the mechanisms underlying the antitumor effect of As(2)O(3) on solid tumors are poorly defined. Previously, we reported that As(2)O(3) induced autophagic cell death (PCD type II) but not apoptosis in human malignant glioma cell lines. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the molecular pathway leading to autophagic cell death. In this study, we demonstrated that the cell death was accompanied by involvement of autophagy-specific marker, microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3), and damage of mitochondrial membrane integrity, but not by caspase activation. Analysis by cDNA microarray, RT-PCR, and Western blot showed that cell death members of Bcl-2 family, Bcl-2/adenovirus E1B 19-kDa-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) and its homologue BNIP3-like (BNIP3L), were upregulated in As(2)O(3)-induced autophagic cell death. Exogenous expression of BNIP3, but not BNIP3L, induced autophagic cell death in malignant glioma cells without As(2)O(3) treatment. When upregulation of BNIP3 induced by As(2)O(3) was suppressed by a dominant-negative effect of the transmembrane-deleted BNIP3 (BNIP3 Delta TM), autophagic cell death was inhibited. In contrast, BNIP3 transfection augmented As(2)O(3)-induced autophagic cell death. These results suggest that BNIP3 plays a central role in As(2)O(3)-induced autophagic cell death in malignant glioma cells. This study adds a new concept to characterize the pathways by which As(2)O(3) acts to induce autophagic cell death in malignant glioma cells."

The main pathway of endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi transport of ceramide is mediated by CERT, a cytosolic 68-kDa protein, in a nonvesicular manner. CERT contains a domain that catalyzes the intermembrane transfer of natural C16-ceramide. In this study, we examined the ligand specificity of CERT in detail by using a cell-free assay system for intermembrane transfer of lipids. CERT did not mediate the transfer of sphingosine or sphingomyelin at all. The activity of CERT to transfer saturated and unsaturated diacylglycerols, which structurally resemble ceramide, was 5–10% of the activity toward C16-ceramide. Among four stereoisomers of C16-ceramide, CERT specifically recognized the natural d-erythro isomer. CERT efficiently transferred ceramides having C14, C16, C18, and C20 chains, but not longer acyl chains, and also mediated efficient transfer of C16-dihydroceramide and C16-phyto-ceramide. Binding assays showed that CERT also recognizes short chain fluorescent analogs of ceramide with a stoichiometry of 1:1. Moreover, (1R,3R)-N-(3-hydroxy-1-hydroxymethyl-3-phenylpropyl)dodecamide, which inhibited the CERT-dependent pathway of ceramide trafficking in intact cells, was found to be an antagonist of the CERT protein. These results indicate that CERT can mediate transfer of various types of ceramides that naturally exist and their close relatives.

The intracellular transport of lipids from the sites of their synthesis to their appropriate destinations must occur, because various steps in lipid biosynthesis occur in different intracellular compartments. The trafficking of integral membrane proteins in eukaryotic cells is mediated by transport vesicles, which load the desired set of proteins and deliver them to the correct organelles. By contrast, many types of lipid synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; StAR, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein; START, StAR-related lipid transfer; HPA-12, N-(3-hydroxy-1-hydroxymethyl-3-phenylpropyl)dodecamide; PtdCho, phosphatidylcholine; PtdEtn, phosphatidylethanolamine; SCDase, sphingolipid ceramide N-deacylase; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; DMB, 4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene; NBD, 7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole. 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; StAR, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein; START, StAR-related lipid transfer; HPA-12, N-(3-hydroxy-1-hydroxymethyl-3-phenylpropyl)dodecamide; PtdCho, phosphatidylcholine; PtdEtn, phosphatidylethanolamine; SCDase, sphingolipid ceramide N-deacylase; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; DMB, 4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene; NBD, 7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole. have been suggested to be sorted to other organelles by nonvesicular mechanisms, although some lipid flux routes such as the endocytosis of plasma membrane lipids occur by vesicle-mediated mechanisms (1van Meer G.

In mammalian cells, ceramide is synthesized at the ER and translocated to the Golgi compartment for conversion to sphingomyelin (4Merrill Jr., A.H. Jones D.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1044: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). There are at least two pathways by which ceramide is transported from the ER to the Golgi site for the synthesis of sphingomyelin: an ATP- and cytosol-dependent major pathway and an ATP- or cytosol-independent (or less dependent) minor pathway (5Hanada K.

The major pathway is impaired in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mutant cell line, LY-A, without any deficiency in the ER-to-Golgi transport of proteins (5Hanada K. Hara T. Fukasawa M. Yamaji A.

We have identified CERT as a factor defective in LY-A cells by functional rescue experiments, and we have shown that CERT mediates the ATP-dependent pathway of ER-to-Golgi trafficking of ceramide in a nonvesicular manner (8Hanada K.

Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar).CERT is a tripartite cytosolic protein ∼600 amino acids in length (8Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M.

The amino-terminal region of ∼120 amino acids is a phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P)-binding pleckstrin homology domain, which can target the Golgi apparatus (11Levine T.P. Munro S. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 695-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The next region of ∼250 amino acids (referred to as the middle region) contains coiled-coil motifs (9Raya A. Revert F. Navarro S. Saus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12642-12649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), which might play a role in homo- or hetero-oligomerization, and a motif that may participate in association with the ER (12Loewen C.J. Roy A. Levine T.P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2025-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). The carboxyl terminus of ∼230 amino acids is a steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR)-related lipid transfer (START) domain.START domains were initially recognized as putative lipid-binding domains of ∼210 amino acid residues, which exist in various types of proteins implicated in intracellular lipid transport, lipid metabolism, and signal transduction (13Ponting C.P.

Although more than 200 proteins have been nominated so far as proteins having START domains in data bases (for example, see smart.embl-heidelberg.de/), only a few have been experimentally shown to bind or transfer specific lipids. For example, StAR and MLN64 proteins recognize cholesterol (14Tsujishita Y. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 15Kallen C.B. Billheimer J.T.

We demonstrated previously that the START domain of CERT can efficiently extract natural long chain C16-ceramide but not other types of lipids, including sphingosine, sphingomyelin, PtdCho, and cholesterol, from phospholipid bilayers (8Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). We have also shown that the START domain of CERT greatly facilitated intermembrane transfer of C16-ceramide in a cell-free system (8Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). However, many details as to the substrate specificity of the START domain of CERT remain undetermined, although various molecular species of ceramide exist in mammalian cells.In most types of mammalian cells, the hydrophobic moiety of complex sphingolipids is mainly composed of ceramide but also includes dihydroceramide and phytoceramide at low levels (21Ramstedt B. Leppimaki P. Axberg M. Slotte J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 997-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 22Karlsson K.A. Samuelsson B.E. Steen G.O. Biochim. Biophys.

Notably, dihydrosphingomyelin is abundant in human lens membranes (24Yappert M.C. Borchman D. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2004; 129: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 25Byrdwell W.C. Borchman D. Ophthalmic Res. 1997; 29: 191-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Moreover, the length of the amido acyl chain of the ceramide moiety is diverse; C16-C26 acyl chains are observed in natural sphingomyelin. Notably, C18- and C24:1-ceramide is predominant for sphingomyelin in the brain (21Ramstedt B. Leppimaki P. Axberg M. Slotte J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 997-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 26O'Brien J.S. Rouser G. J. Lipid Res. 1964; 5: 339-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Raghaven S. Spielvogel C. Kanfer J.N. Lipids. 1973; 8: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), whereas C16-ceramide is predominant in many other tissues (22Karlsson K.A. Samuelsson B.E. Steen G.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 316: 336-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 28Taketomi T. Kawamura N. J. Biochem.

Acta. 1971; 231: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Such structural diversity in the ceramide moiety may affect the nature of membranes where complex sphingolipids are abundant. The physiological importance of the diversity of the ceramide structure has also been recognized, based on differences in bio-modulation activity between ceramide and dihydroceramide (31Bielawska A. Crane H.M. Liotta D. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26226-26232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or between natural long chain ceramide and unnatural short chain ceramide (32van Blitterswijk W.J. van der Luit A.H. Veldman R.J. Verheij M. Borst J. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Hence, it should be of biological significance to determine whether CERT can catalyze the intermembrane transfer of various species of ceramide and its relatives in addition to C16-ceramide.In the present study, we show that CERT is capable of mediating the intermembrane transfer of various types of ceramides that naturally exist in its START domain-dependent manner. In addition, we show that an inhibitor of ER-to-Golgi transport of ceramide is an antagonist of CERT.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Palmitic acid, stearic acid, arachidic acid, behenic acid, lignoceric acid, nervonic acid, d-ribo-phytosphingosine, and Clostridium perfringens phospholipase C were purchased from Sigma. d-erythro-Sphingosine, d-threo-sphingosine, l-erythro-sphingosine, l-threo-sphingosine, d-erythro-dihydrosphingosine, and porcine-derived lactosylceramide were from Matreya Inc., and egg phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) and egg phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) were from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc.

Chem. 2003; 46: 3688-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Preparation of C16-d-Erythro Types of [14C]Ceramide, [14C]Dihydroceramide, and [14C]Phytoceramide and Unnatural Stereoisomers of C16-[14C]Ceramide by Fatty Acid Transfer Reactions with SCDase—The structures of synthesized lipids and the yields of the synthesis are listed in Fig. 1. Natural stereoisomers of C16-[14C]ceramide, C16-[14C]dihydroceramide, and C16-[14C]phytoceramide and unnatural stereoisomers of C16-[14C]ceramide were synthesized by adaptation of the SCDase-catalyzing fatty acid transfer reaction (34Mitsutake S. Kita K. Okino N. Ito M. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In our standard method, 400 nmol of [14C]palmitic acid (55 mCi/mmol) and 2 μmol of appropriate sphingoid base (d-erythro-sphingosine, d-threo-sphingosine, l-erythro-sphingosine, l-threo-sphingosine, d-erythro-dihydrosphingosine, or d-ribo-phytosphingosine) dissolved in ethanol were mixed in a screw-capped Pyrex glass tube and dried under nitrogen gas stream. After adding 2 ml of buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.2% Triton X-100) to the dried lipids, the tube was sonicated with a bath-type sonicator for 5 min. 2 ml of SCDase (1 milliunit/ml in buffer A) was then added to the tube, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for ∼16 h. Lipids were extracted from the mixture by the method of Bligh and Dyer (35Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Med. Sci. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar), dried, dissolved in 400 μl of chloroform/methanol (19:1, by volume), and subjected to TLC with a solvent system of benzene, diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, methanol, 25% (w/v) ammonia (65:7.5:7.5:25:0.75, v/v). After detection of radioactive lipids separated on the TLC plate with a BAS1800 image analyzer (Fuji Film), gel containing a desired radioactive lipid was collected from the TLC plate by scraping. By this image analysis, the efficiency of conversion of the radiolabeled starting material to its ceramide product by the SCDase reaction was also estimated. For extraction of the radioactive lipid by the method of Bligh and Dyer (35Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Med. Sci. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar), 1.9 ml of a solvent of 0.1 m KCl/chloroform/methanol (0.8:1:2, v/v) was added to the collected gel and mixed with a swirling mixer. After addition of 0.5 ml of chloroform and 0.5 ml of 0.1 m KCl to the mixture for phase separation, the mixture was centrifuged (1000 × g, 3 min), and the lower organic phase was collected as a lipid extract. Then the extract was dried under a nitrogen gas stream, dissolved in 1 ml of chloroform/methanol (19:1,v/v), and stored at –20 °C. The radioactivities of synthesized radioactive lipids were determined by liquid scintillation counting. We assumed that specific activities of the synthesized C16-[14C]ceramide and its isomers were identical to the specific activity (55 mCi/mmol) of the precursor [14C]palmitic acid.Preparation of d-erythro-[3H]Ceramides Having Different Acyl Chain Lengths—d-erythro-[3H]Ceramides (20 mCi/mmol) having different acyl chain lengths (C14–C24) were synthesized by using d-erythro-[3H]sphingosine and various fatty acids through the fatty acid transfer reaction catalyzed by SCDase. Briefly, 174 pmol of d-erythro-[3-3H]sphingosine (23 Ci/mmol), 200 nmol of nonradioactive d-erythro-sphingosine, and 240 nmol of various fatty acids (C14-, C16-, C18-, C20-, C22-, or C24-saturated fatty acid or C24:1-monounsaturated fatty acid) were mixed and incubated in 1 ml of buffer A containing 0.5 milliunits of SCDase at 37 °C for ∼24 h. Other procedures were essentially the same as those for the preparation of [14C]ceramide described above.Preparation of [14C]Dipalmitoylglycerol—[14C]Dipalmitoylglycerol was prepared by phospholipase C treatment of [14C]dipalmitoyl-Ptd-Cho. For the preparation of [14C]dipalmitoylglycerol (10 mCi/mmol), 450 nmol of nonradioactive dipalmitoyl-PtdCho and 50 nmol of l-α-[dipalmitoyl-1-14C]dipalmitoyl-PtdCho (100 mCi/mmol) in chloroform were mixed in a polypropylene tube and dried under a nitrogen gas stream. The dried lipids were suspended in 90 μl of 28 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) buffer by sonication with a probe-type sonicator for 5 min. The suspended lipids were incubated in 150 μl of 16 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) buffer containing 5 mm CaCl2, 0.125% sodium deoxycholate, and 1 unit of C. perfringens phospholipase C at 37 °C for 4 h. The [14C]dipalmitoylglycerol produced was then purified by TLC as described under “Preparation of C16-d-Erythro Types of [14C]Ceramide, [14C]Dihydroceramide, and [14C]Phytoceramide and Unnatural Stereoisomers of C16-[14C]Ceramide by Fatty Acid Transfer Reactions with SCDase,” except that a solvent system of hexane/diethylether/acetic acid (70:30:1, v/v) was used for TLC of [14C]dipalmitoylglycerol.Purification of Recombinant CERT and CERTΔST—His6-tagged recombinant human CERT and its START domain-deleted mutant CERTΔST were purified as described previously (8Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 36Dowler S. Currie R.A. Campbell D.G. Deak M. Kular G. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar).Intermembrane Ceramide Transfer Assay—Intermembrane transfer of ceramide and its relatives was assayed in a cell-free system that we briefly described previously (8Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Here we describe the method in more detail.On the day of the lipid transfer assay, purified recombinant CERT and CERTΔST in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 250 mm sucrose buffer were diluted to 1 nmol/ml (71.8 and 45.7 μg/ml for the His6-tagged CERT and CERTΔST, respectively) with buffer C (20 mm Hepes-Na buffer (pH 7.4) containing 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA). Donor vesicles per assay consist of 32 nmol of egg PtdCho, 8 nmol of egg PtdEtn, 4 nmol of porcine lactosylceramide, and 0.5 nmol of radioactive ceramide (27.5 nCi for [14C]ceramides or 10 nCi for [3H]ceramides). Acceptor vesicles per assay consist of 320 nmol of egg PtdCho and 80 nmol of egg PtdEtn. Note that the excess amount of acceptor vesicles to donor vesicles is crucial to minimize donor-to-donor transfer of ceramide, which interferes with the donor-to-acceptor transfer reaction. When necessary, donor vesicles additionally contain [3H]dipalmitoyl-PtdCho (125 nCi per assay) as a nonexchangeable lipid marker. According to the number of assays, appropriate amounts of lipids dissolved in organic solvents were mixed in a polypropylene tube (Eppendorf) and dried under a nitrogen gas stream. After addition of buffer C, phospholipid vesicles were prepared by sonication with a probe-type sonicator (model UP-50H, Dr. Hielscher GmbH, Teltow, Germany) at 80% output and 50% cycle for 10 min in a water bath at room temperature. The volume of buffer C that should be added at this step was 20 μl per assay in donor vesicles and 60 μl per assay in acceptor vesicles (note that at least 200 μl of the buffer is required for the sonication step). To remove lipid aggregates, the sonicated samples were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant fraction was collected as small vesicles. The radioactivity of the supernatant was determined by liquid scintillation counter for assessing the recovery yields after pre-centrifugation. In some cases, the recovery of lipids in the supernatant fraction was also assessed by the lipid phosphorous quantification method (37Rouser G. Siakotos A.N. Fleischer S. Lipids. 1966; 1: 85-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar). Both assessments showed that over 90% of lipids were reproducibly recovered in the supernatant fraction. The prepared small vesicles were used for intermembrane ceramide transfer assay as follows. In typical experiments, 18 μl of buffer C, 60 μl of acceptor vesicles, and 2 μl of recombinant CERT or CERTΔST (1 nmol/ml in buffer C) were mixed in a 1.5-ml polypropylene tube. Then 20 μl of donor vesicles was added to the tube to start the ceramide transfer reaction. After tapping the tube quickly, the reaction mixture was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. For mock incubation, buffer C as the vehicle buffer was added in place of the recombinant protein. To stop the reaction, 30 μl of R. communis agglutinin (2.5 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) was added to the reaction mixture and mixed by pipetting. The agglutinin selectively aggregates donor vesicles by cross-linking of the terminal galactose residue of lactosylceramide embedded in donor vesicles. The mixture was chilled on ice for 10 min and centrifuged (20,000 × g, 3 min, 4 °C) to precipitate agglutinated donor vesicles. Then 115 μl of the supernatant fluid was carefully retrieved, and the radioactivity of the supernatant was measured in 2 ml of ACS-II® (Amersham Biosciences) by liquid scintillation counting. To remove the radioactivity due to incomplete precipitation of donor vesicles, the radioactivity from the mock incubation without any CERT recombinants was subtracted from the radioactivity of each sample. When the effects of HPA-12 and its derivatives on ceramide transfer activity were examined, several modifications were made. Specifically, in preparation of donor vesicles, the amount of C16-[14C]ceramide added was reduced from 0.5 to 0.1 nmol. Then 913 μl of buffer C, 20 μl of donor vesicles, 1–5 μl of 3 mm drugs and the vehicle dimethyl sulfoxide (the final concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide was adjusted to 0.5%), and 2 μl of recombinant CERT or CERTΔST (1 nmol/ml) were mixed in a 1.5-ml tube. After preincubation of the mixture for 5 min at 37 °C, 60 μl of acceptor vesicles was added to the mixture and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Then after addition of 30 μl of R. communis agglutinin (2.5 mg/ml), the chilled mixture was centrifuged (20,000 × g, 3 min, 4 °C), and 960 μl of the supernatant fluid was retrieved for liquid scintillation counting.Binding Assay of C5-DMB-Ceramide, C6-NBD-Ceramide, and LPS Alexa Fluor® 488 to CERT—On the day of the assay, frozen stocks of recombinant CERT and CERTΔST dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl (Tris-buffered saline; TBS) were thawed and centrifuged (20,000 × g, 4 °C, 10 min) to remove aggregates. The supernatant fraction was retrieved, and its protein concentration was determined. For each binding assay, 400 pmol of His6-tagged CERT or CERTΔST (28.7 or 18.3 μg, respectively) in 118 μl of TBS was mixed in a polypropylene tube (Eppendorf). For a negative control, TBS was added in place of the recombinant proteins. After adding 2 μl of 0.1 mm ethanolic stock solution of C5-DMB-ceramide or C6-NBD-ceramide and 60 μl of TBS to the tube, the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min for the binding reaction. Then 60 μl of 50% (v/v) slurry of TALON metal affinity resin pre-equilibrated with buffer B was added to the binding reaction mixture and incubated for 10 min at room temperature with rotary shaking. After centrifugation (20,000 × g, 10 s), the supernatant was retrieved as the “unbound fraction.” For washing, the resin was suspended in 150 μl of buffer B containing 10 mm imidazole and precipitated, and the supernatant was retrieved as the “wash fraction.” This washing step was repeated. The TALON-bound protein was then eluted by incubation with 150 μl of buffer B containing 250 mm imidazole for 5 min at room temperature with occasional tapping. After centrifugation (20,000 × g, 10 s), the supernatant was retrieved as the “elute fraction.” A 3.75-fold volume of chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v) was then added to each retrieved fraction, mixed, and centrifuged (20,000 × g, 10 s). In addition, to retrieve fluorophores that were nonspecifically bound to the resin and tube, 170 μl of TBS and 750 μlof chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v) were added to the tube containing the resin used, mixed, and centrifuged (20,000 × g, 10 s). The supernatant was retrieved as the “residual fraction.” The DMB (excitation at 480 nm; emission at 515 nm) and NBD (excitation at 470 nm; emission at 530 nm) fluorophores in these fractions were quantified with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (model F-3000, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). When the binding stoichiometry of CERT and ceramide was analyzed, some modifications were made, because the amount of ceramide must be in excess to that of CERT for this analysis. Briefly, various concentrations of C5-DMB-ceramide were mixed with 40 pmol of recombinant CERT or CERTΔST and 15 μl of 50% slurry of TALON metal affinity resin, and then the mixture (the volume of which was 135 μl) was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The amounts of the recombinant proteins distributed to the elute fraction were estimated by densitometric analysis after a portion of the fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue® staining, using calibration patterns made with known amounts of CERT and CERTΔST. The amount of C5-DMB-ceramide in the elute fraction was quantified as described above.Binding of LPS Alexa Fluor® 488 to recombinant proteins was assayed by essentially the same procedures except that the fluorescent intensity of LPS Alexa Fluor® 488 (excitation at 488 nm; emission at 538 nm) distributed to each fraction was measured without organic solvent extraction.Effect of (1R,3R)-HPA-12 on Metabolic Labeling of Lipids with [14C]Serine in CHO Cells—LY-A, a CHO-K1-derived mutant cell line, is defective in the trafficking of ceramide from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus because of"

We have recently identified active Stat5 as a tumor marker of favorable prognosis in human breast cancer, and determined that Stat5 activation is lost during metastatic progression. Here we provide novel evidence for an invasion-suppressive role of Stat5 in human breast cancer. Activation of Stat5 by PRL in human breast cancer lines was associated with increased surface levels of the invasion-suppressive adhesion molecule E-cadherin in vitro and in xenotransplant tumors in vivo. Inducible E-cadherin was blocked by dominant-negative (Dn) Stat5 or Dn-Jak2, but not by Dn-Stat3. Further experimental data indicated a role of Stat5 as a coordinate regulator of additional invasion-related characteristics of human breast cancer cells, including cell surface association of beta-catenin, homotypic cell clustering, invasion through Matrigel, cell migration, and matrix metalloproteinase activity. A role of Stat5 as a suppressor of breast cancer invasion and metastatic progression provides a biological mechanism to explain the favorable prognosis associated with active Stat5 in human breast cancer."

https://openalex.org/W1997929924,"Using microarrays, we have screened for genes reactivated by drugs that modify epigenetic mechanisms in pancreatic cancer cells. One of the genes identified was tissue factor pathway inhibitor 2 (TFPI-2), which encodes for a broad-spectrum serine proteinase inhibitor that negatively regulates the extracellular matrix degradation, an essential step in tumor invasion and metastasis. We therefore investigated the expression and methylation patterns of the TFPI-2 gene in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and determined its role in tumor growth and invasion. In contrast to its abundant expression in normal pancreas, TFPI-2 mRNA was undetectable in a high fraction of pancreatic cancer cell lines and in primary pancreatic ductal neoplasms (IPMNs). Loss of TFPI-2 expression was associated with aberrant hypermethylation of its promoter CpG island. Treatment with the phorbol ester (PMA), known to stimulate the TFPI-2 promoter activity, augmented the TFPI-2 expression in cell lines with unmethylated or partially methylated TFPI-2, but failed to induce the expression in cell lines that harbored fully methylated TFPI-2. Aberrant methylation of TFPI-2 was also detected in 73% (102/140) of pancreatic cancer xenografts and primary pancreatic adenocarcinomas, was more likely in older patients with pancreatic cancer, and significantly correlated with progression of IPMNs (P=0.0002). Restored expression of the TFPI-2 gene in nonexpressing pancreatic cancer cells resulted in marked suppression in their proliferation, migration, and invasive potential in vitro. We thus conclude that epigenetic inactivation of TFPI-2 is a common mechanism that contributes to the aggressive phenotype of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2016381427,"Abstract Stecrisp from Trimeresurus stejnegeri snake venom belongs to a family of cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISP) that have various functions related to sperm-egg fusion, innate host defense, and the blockage of ion channels. Here we present the crystal structure of stecrisp refined to 1.6-A resolution. It shows that stecrisp contains three regions, namely a PR-1 (pathogenesis-related proteins of group1) domain, a hinge, and a cysteine-rich domain (CRD). A conformation of solvent-exposed and -conserved residues (His60, Glu75, Glu96, and His115) in the PR-1 domain similar to that of their counterparts in homologous structures suggests they may share some molecular mechanism. Three flexible loops of hypervariable sequence surrounding the possible substrate binding site in the PR-1 domain show an evident difference in homologous structures, implying that a great diversity of species- and substrate-specific interactions may be involved in recognition and catalysis. The hinge is fixed by two crossed disulfide bonds formed by four of ten characteristic cysteines in the carboxyl-terminal region and is important for stabilizing the N-terminal PR-1 domain. Spatially separated from the PR-1 domain, CRD possesses a similar fold with two K+ channel inhibitors (Bgk and Shk). Several candidates for the possible functional sites of ion channel blocking are located in a solvent-exposed loop in the CRD. The structure of stecrisp will provide a prototypic architecture for a structural and functional exploration of the diverse members of the CRISP family."

https://openalex.org/W2091589671,"Suicide gene transfer using thymidine kinase (TK) and ganciclovir (GCV) treatment or the cytosine deaminase (CD)/5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) system represents the most widely used approach for gene therapy of cancer. However, molecular pathways and resistance mechanisms remain controversial for GCV-mediated cytotoxicity, and are virtually unknown for the CD/5-FC system. Here, we elucidated some of the cellular pathways in glioma cell lines that were transduced to express the TK or CD gene. In wild-type p53-expressing U87 cells, exposure to GCV and 5-FC resulted in a weak p53 response, although apoptosis was efficiently induced. Cell death triggered by GCV and 5-FC was independent of death receptors, but accompanied by mitochondrial alterations. Whereas expression of Bax remained unaffected, in particular, GCV and also 5-FC caused a decline in the level of Bcl-2. Similar findings were obtained in 9L and T98G glioma cells that express mutant p53, and also underwent mitochondrial apoptosis in both the TK/GCV and CD/5-FC system. Upon treatment of 9L cells with 5-FC, Bcl-xL expression slowly declined, whereas exposure to GCV resulted in the rapid proapoptotic phosphorylation of Bcl-xL. These data suggest that TK/GCV- and CD/5-FC-induced apoptosis does neither require p53 nor death receptors, but converges at a mitochondrial pathway triggered by different mechanisms of modulation of Bcl-2 proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2142906823,"The lectin from the common mushroom <i>Agaricus bisporus</i>, the most popular edible species in Western countries, has potent antiproliferative effects on human epithelial cancer cells, without any apparent cytotoxicity. This property confers to it an important therapeutic potential as an antineoplastic agent. The three-dimensional structure of the lectin was determined by x-ray diffraction. The protein is a tetramer with 222 symmetry, and each monomer presents a novel fold with two β sheets connected by a helix-loop-helix motif. Selectivity was studied by examining the binding of four monosaccharides and seven disaccharides in two different crystal forms. The T-antigen disaccharide, Galβ1–3GalNAc, mediator of the antiproliferative effects of the protein, binds at a shallow depression on the surface of the molecule. The binding of <i>N</i>-acetylgalactosamine overlaps with that moiety of the T antigen, but surprisingly, <i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine, which differs from <i>N</i>-acetylgalactosamine only in the configuration of epimeric hydroxyl 4, binds at a totally different site on the opposite side of the helix-loop-helix motif. The lectin thus has two distinct binding sites per monomer that recognize the different configuration of a single epimeric hydroxyl. The structure of the protein and its two carbohydrate-binding sites are described in detail in this study."

The structure of Aβ-fibrils has for long been enigmatic because of insoluble aggregate formation that precludes the use of standard structural methods such as x-ray crystallography and solution NMR. Recent data from site-directed spin labeling (5Torok M. Milton S. Kayed R. Wu P. McIntire T. Glabe C.G. Langen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40810-40815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), and particularly from solid-state NMR experiments (6Petkova A.T. Ishii Y. Balbach J.J. Antzutkin O.N.

Biol. 2004; 14: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), have formed the basis of a high resolution model of the Aβ1-40 fibril: β-hairpins lying perpendicular to the fibril axis are associated into β-sheets that line up to form protofilaments, which are then assembled parallel into fibrils. Protofilaments are thus thought to represent an ∼2-3-nm-diameter structural unit within the amyloid fibril (1Serpell L.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1502: 16-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). During amyloidogenesis the formation of fibrils is preceded by the appearance of globular aggregates that are thought to fuse, by not fully understood mechanisms, into fibrillar structures (8Rochet J.C.

The protofibrils are thought to go through a structural transition on their way to forming the amyloid fibril. The exact nature of structural dynamics within the amyloid fibril related to amyloidogenesis, however, remains to be resolved. Single molecule manipulation experiments have in the recent past provided unique and unprecedented insights not only into the structure and elasticity but also into mechanically driven transitions of molecular systems (13Smith S.B.

We showed that filamentous entities most likely corresponding to β-sheets can be “unzipped” from the fibril with constant forces in an equilibrium process, indicating that during mechanical relaxation the β-sheets rapidly rebind to the fibril surface. This rapid, mechanical zipping together of β-sheets could be an important mechanism behind cooperative amyloid fibril formation. Samples—Amyloid peptides were prepared by solid phase synthesis (22Palota ́s A. Ka ́lma ́n J. Palota ́s M. Juha ́sz A. Janka Z. Penke B. Brain Res. Bull. 2002; 58: 203-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Aβ25-35 and Aβ1-40 peptides contained amino acid residues 25-35 and 1-40 of the β-peptide, respectively. Fibrils were generated by dissolving the peptides in PBSA buffer (10 mm K-phosphate, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3) at 0.5 mg/ml concentration. Aβ1-40 and Aβ25-35 fibrils were grown in solution at 25-37 °C for several days. Surface Adsorption of Amyloid Fibrils—Depending on the type of experiment, different surfaces and methods were employed for attaching amyloid β-fibrils. 1) For AFM imaging under ambient conditions, mica surface was used. A 20-μl sample (0.5 mg/ml concentration) was pipetted onto a freshly cleaved mica surface and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Subsequently, the surface was rinsed with MilliQ water and dried with a stream of clean N2 gas. 2) For molecular force spectroscopy measurements, fibrils were either adsorbed nonspecifically to a precleaned glass surface or attached covalently to a glass coverslip. The two methods gave similar results. Glass coverslips were cleaned by sonication in acetone, followed by rinsing with MilliQ water and drying in a stream of N2 gas. A 20-μl sample (0.5 mg/ml concentration) was pipetted onto the glass surface and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Unbound fibrils were washed away by rinsing with PBSA buffer. Rinsing was carried out by repetitively (5×) adding and removing 100 μl of buffer solution. The surface was then left covered with PBSA solution. For covalent modification, precleaned coverslips were incubated in toluene vapor containing 2% 3-glycidiloxypropyl-trimethoxisylane (Fluka) for 12 h at room temperature. Attaching of fibrils to the covalently modified surface was carried out as described above, with an additional step: following the attachment of fibrils, the surface was incubated with PBSA buffer of pH 9 to facilitate covalent binding to the amino-modified surface. Single Molecule Force Spectroscopy—Amyloid fibrils were stretched with an AFM (Asylum Research MFP1D or MFP3D) by first pressing the cantilever (Veeco Microlever or Olympus BioLever) tip against the surface and then pulling the cantilever away with a constant, preadjusted rate. The experiments were carried out under aqueous buffer conditions (PBSA buffer, pH 7.4). Stiffness was determined for each cantilever by using the thermal method (23Hutter J.L. Bechhoefer J. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1993; 64: 1868-1873Crossref Scopus (3451) Google Scholar). Atomic Force Microscopy—Non-contact mode AFM images of amyloid fibrils bound to freshly cleaved mica were prepared with the MFP3D AFM instrument using silicon cantilevers (Olympus AC160, typical resonance frequency ∼300 kHz). 512 × 512 images were collected at a typical scanning frequency of 1 Hz. In Situ Force Spectroscopy—In situ force spectroscopy was carried out by first scanning (under aqueous buffer conditions) the glass-bound sample surface, pressing the cantilever tip to targeted surface locations identified on the image, and finally rescanning the surface to test for the effect of the mechanical perturbations (24Oesterhelt F. Oesterhelt D. Pfeiffer M. Engel A. Gaub H.E. Muller D.J. Science. 2000; 288: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Soft (typical cantilever stiffness ∼30 pN/nm), high resonance frequency (typical resonance frequency ∼40 kHz) cantilevers (Olympus BioLever, B Lever) were used. Scanning was carried out in non-contact mode at high set-point values (0.8-1 V) to avoid the binding of sample to the cantilever tip. To correct for drift, the same area was analyzed in several cycles of scanning and mechanical probing. Data Analysis—In the case of non-linear mechanical responses, the relaxation curves were fitted with the worm-like chain equation as shown in Equation 1 (25Bustamante C.J. Marko J.F. Siggia E.D. Smith S.B. Science. 1994; 265: 1599-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1832) Google Scholar).fAkBT=zL+14(1−z/L)2−14(Eq. 1) Force plateaus were analyzed by measuring the distance between the average plateau force and the force baseline (Fig. 2A, i, inset). Force steps were analyzed by measuring the distance between the average force values of consecutive plateaus (Fig. 2C, inset). Modeling and Simulation—Amyloid fibril unzipping was simulated with a simple elastically coupled two-state model (26Rief M. Fernandez J.M. Gaub H.E. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1998; 81: 4764-4767Crossref Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 27Kellermayer M.S. Bustamante C. Granzier H.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1604: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) in which the activation kinetics are influenced by the mechanical load and the shape of the interaction potential holding the amyloid fibril together. In the model, a β-sheet was gradually pulled off the fibril surface. The apparent contour length of the simulated β-sheet was reduced by the presence of a set of bonds spaced 4.7 Å apart. As the chain was extended, force was generated according to the wormlike chain equation (25Bustamante C.J. Marko J.F. Siggia E.D. Smith S.B. Science. 1994; 265: 1599-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1832) Google Scholar). This entropic force is counterbalanced with the unzipping (or desorption) force, which may include electrostatic and non-electrostatic (e.g. hydrophobic interactions) components (28Hugel T. Grosholz M. Clausen-Schaumann H. Pfau A. Gaub H.E. Seitz M. Macromolecules. 2001; 34: 1039-1047Crossref Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In each polling interval (dt) the probability of bond rupture (unzipping) at the given force (f) was calculated according to Equation 2,Pu=ω0dte−(Eau−fΔxu)/kBT(Eq. 2) where w0 is attempt frequency set by Brownian dynamics (29Bell G.I. Science. 1978; 200: 618-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (3449) Google Scholar), kBT is thermal energy, Eau is activation energy of unzipping, and Δxu is distance between the bound and transition states along the unzipping reaction coordinate. Similarly, in the same polling interval the probability of binding (zipping) was calculated according to Equation 3,Pz=ω0dte−(Eaz+fΔxz)/kBT(Eq. 3) where Eaz is activation energy of zipping and Δxz is distance between the dissociated and transition states along the zipping reaction coordinate. The unzipping or zipping processes were permitted or prohibited depending on a comparison of P with a number generated randomly between 0 and 1. Each bond rupture event incremented the apparent contour length with 4.7 Å and vice versa. Force Spectroscopy of Aβ-Fibrils—Amyloid fibrils formed from Aβ1-40 or Aβ25-35 peptides were mechanically manipulated using single molecule AFM (27Kellermayer M.S. Bustamante C. Granzier H.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1604: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 30Rief M. Oesterhelt F. Heymann B. Gaub H.E. Science. 1997; 275: 1295-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). The tip of an AFM cantilever was pressed against a glass surface coated with the Aβ-fibrils. Subsequently, the cantilever was pulled away from the surface to stretch the fibrils and then returned toward the surface to relax the fibrils. The force and extension data collected during the stretch-relaxation cycles provided a description of the mechanical response of the fibrils. The mechanical behavior of the two different amyloid fibrils was qualitatively similar. Two fundamental types of mechanical responses were deduced: (a) fully reversible, non-linear elasticity (Fig. 1A) with the contour length often exceeding 100 nm, and (b) force plateau characterized with a constant force level during stretch (Fig. 1B). During extension the force plateau was sometimes preceded with a non-linear elastic response (Fig. 1B, inset) and usually ended with an abrupt force drop. Most frequently the two fundamental processes were combined into complex, hierarchical mechanical responses: force plateaus were superimposed onto one another (Fig. 1C) or onto a non-linear force curve (Fig. 1D). Superimposed force plateaus usually ended with a series of decreasing force steps resulting in a descending staircase pattern. Histograms were constructed from the plateau heights (difference between average plateau force and baseline (Fig. 2A, i, inset). The plateau force histograms revealed multimodal distribution for Aβ25-35 (Fig. 2A, ii) and pointed to multimodality for Aβ1-40 (Fig. 2A, i). Although the peaks were difficult to distinguish in the histogram of Aβ1-40 (Fig. 2A, i), a discrete force plateau distribution was expected based on the presence of plateaus that appeared at integral multiples of ∼30 pN (Fig. 2B). A more detailed analysis of the force step heights in data obtained from in situ force spectroscopy measurements (see below) did reveal the multimodality of plateau force distribution for Aβ1-40 fibrils (Fig. 2C). Accordingly, the peaks corresponding to the smallest plateau forces appeared at 33 pN (±7 S.D., n = 258) and 41 pN (±7 S.D., n = 76) for Aβ1-40 and Aβ25-35, respectively. The rest of the peaks appeared at forces that are integral multiples of the 33- or 41-pN unit forces. We found that the plateau transition was reversible and the force staircases were repeatable. There were several manifestations of reversibility. If the pulling experiment was reversed prior to reaching the end of the force plateau, or if the plateau was preceded by non-linear elastic response (Fig. 3A), then the relaxation force curve followed the stretch force curve. The plateau force was independent of stretch rate, and the lack of hysteresis was maintained across two orders of magnitude of stretch velocity (Fig. 3B). Reversible force staircases, with no hysteresis, were also observed (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, these reversible force staircases often persisted through successive stretch-relaxation cycles (Fig. 3C). In these experiments, fluctuations across force steps were also observed (Fig. 3C, inset), indicating that the rate of the underlying structural fluctuations exceeds the stretch (or relaxation) rate. Time-dependent AFM Imaging and Force Spectroscopy—The force spectroscopy results suggested that during stretch elastic strands are pulled off the Aβ-fibril surface. To explore the nature of these strands, time-dependent AFM imaging and force spectroscopy experiments were performed. Fig. 4 shows the results for Aβ1-40 fibrils. Shortly after dissolution in PBSA buffer, globular aggregates were present, but filamentous structures were not observed (Fig. 4, Day 0). In the corresponding force spectra an occasional force sawtooth was observed, but force plateaus and complex force patterns were absent. The length of the captured molecular species was <20 nm. The observed mechanical behavior describes most likely the capture, unfolding, and release of oligomers of the Aβ-peptide. Force plateaus, non-linear elastic responses with long contour lengths, and various combinations of these mechanical responses were observed only after the third day and became prominent in preparations more than 1 week old (Fig. 4, >Day 7, lower panel). These preparations contained an abundance of mature Aβ-fibrils. Thus, the time-dependent AFM imaging and force spectroscopic results allowed the tentative conclusion that the prominent mechanical responses (Fig. 1) are associated with mature Aβ-fibrils. In Situ Force Spectroscopy—To further explore the origin of the elastic strand pulled off the fibril surface, we carried out in situ force spectroscopy experiments. A glass surface with covalently attached mature Aβ1-40 fibrils was first gently scanned in non-contact mode under aqueous buffer conditions. Subsequently, force spectroscopy measurements were carried out at specific target locations of the surface. Fig. 5 shows the results for Aβ1-40 fibrils. Repeated attempts of pulling at the control location (Fig. 5, A and B, spot 1), which was devoid of clearly identifiable amyloid fibrils, produced no characteristic force response. By contrast, if fibrils were targeted (spots 2 and 3), characteristic force plateaus and staircases appeared. Plateau forces exceeding 500 pN were often observed (Fig. 5B, ii and iii). Force plateaus longer than 250 nm were seen (Fig. 5B, iv), and force staircase patterns persisted through successive stretch-relaxation cycles (Fig. 5B, iv) in accordance with earlier observations (Fig. 3C). The fundamental force plateau of ∼30 pN was observed to reach a length of >200 nm (Fig. 5B, v). AFM imaging performed following the mechanical perturbations revealed that the fibrils were not removed in toto by the pulling attempts (Fig. 5A, iii and iv). Furthermore, the gross helical structure of the fibrils was not perturbed either, at least not to an extent resolvable under the experimental conditions (Fig. 5C). Thus, the in situ force spectroscopy experiments indicated that the elastic strands pulled away from the Aβ-fibril represent subfibrillar components of the mature fibril. Identity of Strands Unzipped from the Aβ-Fibril—In the present work we mechanically manipulated surface-attached Aβ-fibrils, formed from either Aβ1-40 or Aβ25-35 peptides, by using single molecule force spectroscopy and in situ force spectroscopy techniques. Various combinations of two main phenomena, non-linear elasticity (Fig. 1A) and force plateau (Fig. 1B), dominated the mechanical response of the fibrils. Our results suggested that the mechanical response is determined by the elasticity and interactions of an element within the structural hierarchy of the mature Aβ-fibril. There are three elements, the Aβ-fibril itself, the protofilament, or individual β-sheets, that may in principle explain the observed mechanics (31Roher A.E. Baudry J. Chaney M.O. Kuo Y.M. Stine W.B. Emmerling M.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1502: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). First, an entire Aβ-fibril could, in principle, be manipulated and lifted off the substrate surface, resulting in the observed force responses. However, we excluded this possibility because the fibrils were attached firmly (covalently in many experiments) to the substrate, and in situ force spectroscopy experiments demonstrated that fibrils were not displaced in toto by the mechanical perturbations (Fig. 5, B and C). Second, protofilaments could in principle be lifted off the fibril surface, producing the observed mechanical behavior. We excluded this possibility as well, for two main reasons. 1) A single Aβ-fibril contains five or six protofilaments (1Serpell L.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1502: 16-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). By contrast, the high plateau forces (Fig. 5B, ii and iii) indicate that the number of strands pulled off the fibril may be up to at least nine (see also explanation below). 2) The gross helical appearance of the Aβ-fibril, which is thought to be determined by the protofilament structure and arrangement (32Khurana R. Ionescu-Zanetti C. Pope M. Li J. Nielson L. Ramirez-Alvarado M. Regan L. Fink A.L. Carter S.A. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 1135-1144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), is not altered significantly by the mechanical perturbations (Fig. 5C). Thus, we concluded that the force responses observed in mechanically manipulated Aβ-fibrils are determined by the elasticity and interactions of individual β-sheets. Non-linear Elastic Behavior—The fully reversible, non-linear force response (Fig. 1A) most likely describes the elasticity of the β-sheet that has been liberated from its lateral confinement within the fibril but held firmly at its ends. We could fit the non-linear force curves with the wormlike chain model of entropic elasticity. The persistence length obtained from wormlike chain fits to force data obtained for 5-day-old Aβ1-40 samples was 0.38 nm (±0.06 nm S.E., n = 165), which is comparable with the persistence length of a fully unfolded protein chain (titin) (15Rief M. Gautel M. Oesterhelt F. Fernandez J.M. Gaub H.E. Science. 1997; 276: 1109-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (2620) Google Scholar). We assumed that the short calculated persistence length is an apparent value, which is an underestimation of the persistence length of the single β-sheet. The apparent persistence length becomes reduced if multiple strands are pulled in parallel (14Kellermayer M.S.Z. Smith S.B. Granzier H.L. Bustamante C. Science. 1997; 276: 1112-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar, 27Kellermayer M.S. Bustamante C. Granzier H.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1604: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) or if force-dependent interactions of the strand occur (33Kellermayer M.S. Smith S.B. Bustamante C. Granzier H.L. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 852-863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The β-sheet (or bundles thereof) can withstand forces up to 600 pN (Fig. 1A). The high tensile strength may be explained by a parallel coupling between the numerous hydrogen bonds (6Petkova A.T. Ishii Y. Balbach J.J. Antzutkin O.N. Leapman R.D. Delaglio F. Tycko R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16742-16747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1656) Google Scholar) holding the peptides together along the β-sheet. Considering that the hydrogen bonds lie in a plane perpendicular to the direction of pulling force, the force is distributed among these bonds. Origin of Force Plateau—The force plateau (Fig. 1, B-D) is interpreted to arise from the unzipping of a β-sheet from the fibril. Force plateaus have recently been observed for single polyelectrolyte chains desorbed from charged surfaces (28Hugel T. Grosholz M. Clausen-Schaumann H. Pfau A. Gaub H.E. Seitz M.

Phys. 2004; 6: 1-16Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar) or for non-electrolyte chains pulled out of a collapsed globule due to Rayleigh instability in poor solvent conditions (39Haupt B.J. Senden T.J. Sevick E.M. Langmuir. 2002; 18: 2174-2182Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that our findings are related to Rayleigh instability, because amyloid fibrils are highly structured and the observed force plateaus are reversible. During unzipping, the β-sheet, pulled perpendicular relative to the fibril axis, is desorbed, peeled, or unzipped from the fibril. Because of the pulling geometry, the bonds laterally connecting the β-sheet to the underlying fibril surface are loaded and broken individually at the same average force, one after the other as the pulling progresses. Each bond rupture releases a short section of the β-sheet and increases the length of the already liberated β-sheet segment. Bond rupture events were not resolved, because the bonds are too closely spaced (axial β-hairpin spacing ∼4.7 Å) (1Serpell L.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1502: 16-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). We observed a significant difference between the unit unzipping forces for Aβ1-40 and Aβ25-35 fibrils (p < 0.0001). The multiple peaks in the plateau force histograms (Fig. 2) were interpreted to arise from the simultaneous unzipping of strands containing different numbers of β-sheets. Accordingly, the smallest unit forces of 33 or 41 pN correspond to the unzipping of single Aβ1-40 or Aβ25-35 β-sheets from the fibril, respectively. It is important to point out that a single β-sheet can interact with the underlying substrate at both of its ends, so as to form a loop, which results in unzipping force that is twice the unit force (see also “Model and Simulation” below). With the unit unzipping forces it is possible to calculate the number of β-sheets involved in a given force plateau transition. For example, the prominent ∼130-pN force plateau seen in Fig. 5B, iv is caused by the unzipping of a minimum of two (if both form loops) and a maximum of four β-sheets (if none forms a loop). At present we can only speculate about the origin of the differences between the unit unzipping forces of Aβ1-40 and Aβ25-35 β-sheets. Considering that amino acid side chain interactions determine the strength of interaction between parallel β-sheets, the origin of the unzipping force difference could be because of differences in the arrangement of the exposed side chains. One possibility is that Lys-28, which participates in forming a salt bridge with Asp-23 that stabilizes the hairpin structure of the Aβ1-40 peptide (6Petkova A.T. Ishii Y. Balbach J.J. Antzutkin O.N. Leapman R.D. Delaglio F. Tycko R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16742-16747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1656) Google Scholar), is exposed in Aβ25-35 and may form a relatively strong interaction with Met-35 of the neighboring peptide (40Terzi E. Holzemann G. Seelig J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7434-7441Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), resulting in greater unzipping forces. Force Steps and Staircases—The unzipping process continues until the entire β-sheet is liberated, which is marked by an abrupt decrease in force. Descending force staircase (Fig. 1C) arises during the simultaneous unzipping of several β-sheets followed by their gradual, one-by-one (or group-by-group) release from the underlying fibril surface. The presence of force staircase patterns suggests that the β-sheets terminate at different positions, probably because of a staggered arrangement within the fibril. The structural implications for a possible staggered β-sheet arrangement within the amyloid fibril are not fully understood. The position of the force step along the length axis allows the estimation of the length of a β-sheet within the fibril. We found unit unzipping force plateaus up to 220 nm long (Fig. 5B, v), indicating that the length of individual β-sheets within the fibril can be well in excess of 200 nm. Considering that protofibrils, the putative precursors of amyloid fibrils, have a maximum observed length of 200 nm (11Walsh D.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22364-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar), our findings raised the intriguing possibility that during amyloidogenesis protofibrils fuse by the annealing of their component β-sheets. The observed long β-sheet unzipped from the fibril raises a topological problem. β-sheets are embedded in hierarchically wound helices with a pitch of ∼46 nm (41Malinchik S.B. Inouye H. Szumowski K.E. Kirschner D.A. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 537-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 42Serpell L.C. Sunde M. Benson M.D. Tennent G.A. Pepys M.B. Fraser P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1033-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Unzipping a β-sheet, the length of which exceeds the helix pitch, is expected to cause torsion or rotation of or within the fibril. Considering that the rotation of the entire fibril was prevented by its firm attachment to the substrate surface, it may be possible that the component protofilaments possess a certain degree of torsional or rotational freedom within the fibril. Reversibility of Force Plateau and Force Step—The lack of force hysteresis often seen in the force responses (Fig. 3) indicates that the mechanically perturbed amyloid fibril system passes through identical structural states during stretch and release and is in thermodynamic equilibrium at each point of extension. The absence of stretch-rate dependence of plateau force (Fig. 3B) indicates that the equilibrium is highly dynamic and the system fluctuates between the (associated and dissociated, or zippered and unzipped) states on a time scale that is much faster than that of the pulling experiment. Because of the equilibrium, the average mechanical energy invested in driving the transition reflects the associated free energy change (ΔG) (43Liphardt J. Dumont S. Smith S.B. Tinoco Jr., I. Bustamante C. Science. 2002; 296: 1832-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). Considering the mean plateau forces for the single β-sheet and a 4.7 Å monomer spacing (1Serpell L.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1502: 16-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar), the ΔG of lateral β-sheet binding is ∼1.6 × 10-20 J and ∼2 × 10-20 J/monomer (i.e. ∼9.6 kJ mol-1 and ∼12 kJ mol-1) for Aβ1-40 and Aβ25-35, respectively. The prerequisite of reversibility is coupling, via the β-sheet, between the bonds holding the β-sheet laterally within the fibril. In lieu of coupling the dissociated monomers would diffuse away and reassociation would be unlikely. Coupling is serial in the case of a single β-sheet that is gradually unzipped from the fibril surface. However, parallel coupling can also occur, as in the case of parallel-associated β-sheets. A tight coupling between parallel-arranged β-sheets can result even in the reversal of the force staircase related to complete β-sheet dissociation, and a completely released β-sheet can rebind to the fibril in a reversible reaction (Fig. 3C). Because the complete release and rebinding of a β-sheet results in large force steps, the rapid fluctuation between the states becomes visible in the force traces (Fig. 3C, inset). Repeatability of Mechanical Response—We found that the complex mechanical response of the amyloid fibril was repeatable through successive stretch-relaxation cycles. That is, the force patterns recorded in successive mechanical cycles were identical or very similar (Figs. 3C and 5B, iv). The observation indicates that the structural features of the manipulated strand (e.g. number and arrangement of β-sheets) are preserved and that the mechanical events occur not randomly, but in a sequential manner (44Case R.B. Chang Y.P. Smith S.B. Gore J. Cozzarelli N.R. Bustamante C. Science. 2004; 305: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Repeatability is easily reconciled if an elastic coupling persists between the cantilever tip and the fibril surface that may guide the β-sheet rebinding through consecutive mechanical cycles (Fig. 3C). However, if the bundle of β-sheets is completely removed by the tip between stretch-relaxation cycles (such as happened in Fig. 5B, iv), the β-sheets first need to be delivered back to the fibril surface and allowed to rebind in a fast reaction. Possibly, under these conditions the underlying fibril surface serves as a spatial guide for structurally correct reassociation. Considering the added complexities due to helical protofibril arrangement, much further work is required to understand the details of the process. Model and Simulation—We have proposed the following model to explain our observations (Fig. 6A). During mechanical manipulation of surface-adsorbed Aβ-fibrils, β-sheets are lifted off the fibril surface (Fig. 6A, i). As the pulling progresses, the β-sheets become unzipped via the sequential rupture of side chain interactions, which convert the β-sheets from an associated to a dissociated state. Because each rupture event increases the length of the unzipped β-sheet with a uniform and very small distance, the unzipping process proceeds at an apparent constant force that results in a force plateau (Fig. 6A, i). Because the β-sheets within a bundle are parallel-coupled, the plateau force scales with the effective (i.e. two in case of a loop) number of β-sheets. If a β-sheet becomes unzipped entirely, the force drops in a unit step. Numerous sequential steps result in a descending force staircase (Fig. 6A, ii). If the β-sheet bundle is parallel-coupled to an elastic element (e.g. a β-sheet already liberated but held at its ends, Fig. 6A, iii), then the shape of the force staircase is distorted by the superimposed non-linear elastic behavior. If the β-sheet is allowed to retract, it reassociates to the underlying fibril in a rapid and an apparently cooperative process. The driving force of the rapid rebinding is the very high local concentration of the conjugate binding sites, which increases with each rebinding event. The rapid rebinding is probably further facilitated by the correct orientation of the conjugate binding sites defined by the structural order of the β-sheet. As a result, the β-sheets are rapidly zippered together. A simulation based on a simple elastically coupled two-state model (26Rief M. Fernandez J.M. Gaub H.E. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1998; 81: 4764-4767Crossref Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 33Kellermayer M.S. Smith S.B. Bustamante C. Granzier H.L. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 852-863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) using the deduced 2 × 10-20 J/monomer ΔG between the bound and dissociated states (for Aβ25-35) recovered the essential features of our findings (Fig. 4), including the ascending and descending force staircases, the effect of parallel coupling to a non-linear elastic element, and reversibility (at relatively low, <60 nm/s, stretch rates). At high stretch rates (>60 nm/s), however, force hysteresis appeared in the simulation and the unzipping/zipping forces became loading rate-dependent (35Haupt B.J. Ennis J. Sevick E.M. Langmuir. 1999; 15: 3886-3892Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The loading rate dependence in the simulation is due to the lack of consideration for the high local binding site concentration. Implications—We have mechanically manipulated individual amyloid β-fibrils and argued that their complex mechanical responses are most plausibly explained by a reversible unzipping of long elastic β-sheets from the fibril. The findings are thought to have important implications for understanding the structure, structural dynamics, and mechanisms of formation of amyloid fibrils. The reversible rebinding of β-sheets at high loads and loading rates to the underlying fibril surface indicates that the associated state is strongly favored and a mechanically perturbed amyloid fibril is rapidly recovered by zipping together the β-sheets. This or a similar process may be important in the structural rearrangements that are thought to occur during the final formation of the amyloid fibril. The repeatable force patterns provided a mechanical fingerprint of the Aβ-fibril. This fingerprint was observed to be different for Aβ1-40 and Aβ25-35 fibrils, probably because of underlying differences in the arrangement and interactions of their β-sheets. Although we tentatively excluded that protofibrils, the precursors of mature amyloid β-fibrils (9Harper J.D. Wong S.S. Lieber C.M. Lansbury P.T. Chem.

Cell swelling occurs in many physiological responses and pathological processes. In most cells, the cell swelling occurs in the early phase of cell proliferation probably caused by water influx that accompanies changes in cell metabolism (such as obligatory uptake of amino acids) in the cell cycle (1Eggermont J.

An increase in cell volume usually evokes regulatory volume decrease (RVD) process through activation of various transporters and ion (K+ and Cl-) channels, which induces the effluxes of K+, Cl-, and H2O, and returns the cell volume to normal size. It is generally understood that RVD is mainly mediated by Cl- efflux through a volume-regulated Cl- channel (VRC). 1The abbreviations used are: VRC, volume-regulated Cl- channel; DIDS, 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; 4α-PMA, 4-α-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PDBu, phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate; PKC, protein kinase C; VSOAC, volume-sensitive osmolyte and anion channels; MEQ, 6-methoxy-N-ethylquinolinium iodide; F, farad; gp, glycoprotein. Therefore, VRC may play an essential role in cell proliferation through regulation of cell volume. In our previous study, we determined effects of different kinds of Cl- channel blockers on endothelin-1-induced proliferation in cultured rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells. It was found that the aortic vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation was only inhibited by DIDS (2Xiao G.N. Guan Y.Y. He H. Life Sci. 2002; 70: 2233-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ClC-3 antisense inhibited the functional expression of ClC-3 and endothelin-1-induced proliferation in cultured rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (3Wang G.L. Wang X.R. Lin M.J. He H. Lan X.J. Guan Y.Y. Cir Res. 2002; 91: e28-e32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results provide evidence that ClC-3 may be the gene responsible for ICl.vol and mediate volume regulation in vascular smooth muscle cells. Although it has been suggested that the ClC-3 gene may encode VRC and mediate the volume regulation process in guinea pig ventricular myocytes (4Duan D. Winter C. Crowley S. Hume J.R. Horowitz B.

In the present study, we further determined the relationship between volume-regulated Cl- and ClC-3 channels in A10 and ClC-3-A10 vascular smooth muscle cells by continuously monitoring the change in [Cl-]i, whole cell patch clamp, ClC-3 antisense, and intracellular dialysis of an anti-ClC-3 antibody techniques. Our results strongly suggest that the ClC-3 channel is responsible for swelling-induced Cl- current and Cl- movement and mediates volume regulation in A10 vascular smooth muscle cell. Cell Culture—A10 vascular smooth muscle cells from the American Type Culture Collection. A10 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator in a 95% O2 plus 5% CO2 atmosphere. For electrophysiological experiments, the cells were subcultured in coverslips for 1–2 days. gpClC-3 cDNA Transfection—Cells were plated in 24-well Corning tissue culture plates. Twenty-four hours later, cells were transfected with 1 μg/ml gpClC-3/pc DNA 3.1 plasmid, which contains a full-length gpClC-3 cDNA, and pcDNA3.1 vector (gpClC-3/pcDNA3.1 was kindly provided by Dr. J. R. Hume, University of Nevada School of Medicine, Reno, Nevada). The vector contains a geneticin-resistant marker. Transfection was performed with Lipofectamine2000 reagent according to the manufacturer (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.). Stably transfected clonal cell lines were selected using geneticin (G418) at 400 μg/ml for 2 weeks following the transfection. The surviving G418-resistant cells were further plated and passed in the presence of 200 μg/ml G418. The expression of ClC-3 protein was detected by Western blot analysis. Transfections of Antisense, Sense, or Missense Oligonucleotides—The antisense and sense oligonucleotides corresponding specifically to the initiation codon region of the human ClC-3 mRNA were synthesized (Sangon, Shanghai, China) as reported previously (6Wang L. Chen L. Jacob T.J. J. Physiol. 2000; 524: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The antisense sequence was 5′-TCC ATT TGT CAT TGT-3′. The sense oligonucleotide had the sequence 5′-ACA ATG ACA AAT GGA-3′. We designed missense oligonucleotide 5′-TCT ATT CCT GTA TTG-3′, which consisted of the same bases employed in the antisense probe, but in a “random” order, and did not recognize any known sequence available in Gen-Bank™. The first three bases at either end in all oligonucleotides were phosphorothioated. To examine the uptake of oligonucleotide by A10 cells, the oligonucleotides were labeled with fluorescence. For transient transfection, the cells in the quiescent state were transfected with oligonucleotides by incubation for 48 h with Lipofectamine2000 (5 μl/ml). Western Blot Analysis—To examine ClC-3 protein expression, ClC-3-A10 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysis buffer: Tris-Cl 50 mm, NaCl 150 mm, NaN3 0.02%, Nonidet P-40 1%, SDS 0.1%, sodium deoxycholate 0.5%, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin. The protein content of cell lysates was quantified with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). The membranes were blocked at room temperature for 1 h in PBST containing (mm): 103 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 10 Na2HPO4, 1.5 KH2PO4, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4), incubated initially with primary antibodies (Anti-ClC-3, Alomone Labs, 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C), and then with the appropriate secondary peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit secondary antibody and horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-biotin antibody, 1 h at room temperature). Final detection was carried out with LumiGLO chemiluminescent reagent (New England Biolabs) as described by the manufacturer. The density of target bands was accurately determined by the computer-aided one-dimensional gel analysis system. Measurement of [Cl-]i—6-Methoxy-N-ethylquinolinium iodide (MEQ) was reduced to its cell-permeable derivative 6-methoxy-N-ethyl-1,2-dihydroquinoline (dihydro-MEQ) as described previously (10Biwersi J. Verkman A.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7879-7983Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The MEQ reduction was carried out by addition of 32 μm sodium borohydride to MEQ solution at room temperature under flowing nitrogen in the dark for 30 min. Dihydro-MEQ was freshly prepared before experiment. Cells were incubated with 100–150 μm diH-MEQ in a Ringer's buffer solution containing (mm):119 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.0 NaH2PO4, 1.3 MgSO4, 2.5 CaCl2, 26 NaHCO3, and 11 glucose, pH 7.4 at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. In cytoplasm, dihydro-MEQ is quickly oxidized to MEQ, which is sensitive to [Cl-]i. Fluorescence quenching induced by Cl- was monitored by MetaFluor Imaging software (Universal Imaging Systems, Chester, PA) with 350-nm excitation wavelength and 435-nm emission wavelength. Electrophysiological Experiments—Cells in a chamber of 500 μl in volume were continuously superfused at the rate of 2 ml per min. The Cl- currents were recorded with an Axopatch 200B Amplifier (Axon Instrument, Foster City, CA) using conventional whole cell recording technique. Patch pipettes were made from borosilicate glass using a two-stage puller (pp-83, Narishige, Tokyo, Japan) and had the resistances of 3–5 Ω when the pipettes were filled with the pipette solution. A 3 mm KCl-agar salt bridge between the bath and the Ag-AgCl reference electrode was used to minimize the changes of liquid junction potentials. To determine the whole cell current-voltage curve, the cell was held at -40 mV, and test potentials were applied from -100 mV to +120 mV for 400 ms in +20 mV increments at an interval of 5 s. To obtain time-dependent changes in current amplitude, cells were clamped from a holding potential of -40 mV to a hyperpolarizing potential of -80 mV for 250 ms, then back to -40 mV for 25 ms, and then to a depolarizing potential of +100 mV for 250 ms. This protocol was repeated every 30 s. Currents were filtered at a frequency of 2 kHz and digitized at 5 kHz using pCLAMP8.0 software (Axon Instruments). The data were directly entered into the hard drive of a PC-compatible computer. All experiments were performed at room temperature (25 °C). The hypotonic bath solution contained (mm): 107 N-methyl-d-glucamine chloride (NMDG-Cl), 1.5 MgCl2, 2.5 MnCl2, 0.5 CdCl2, 0.05 GdCl3, 10 glucose, and 10 Hepes, pH 7.4 adjusted with NMDG. This solution osmolarity measured by a freezing point depression osmometer (OSMOMAT030, Germany) was 230 mosmol/kg·H2O. A 300 mosmol/kg·H2O isotonic bath solution was made by adding 70 mm d-mannitol to the hypotonic solution. A 370 mosmol/kg·H2O hypertonic bath solution was prepared by adding 140 mm d-mannitol to the hypotonic solution. In the experiment for Cl- dependence, Cl- in the hypotonic medium was replaced by equimolar aspartate- to obtain the hypotonic solution containing 39 mm [Cl-]o. In the experiment for anion selectivity, the hypotonic bath solution contained (mm): 115 NaX, 10 glucose, and 10 Hepes, pH 7.4 adjusted by NaOH. X- denotes I-, Cl- or aspartate-. The pipette solution contained (mm): 95 CsCl, 20 TEACl, 5 ATP-Mg, 5 EGTA, 5 Hepes, and 80 d-mannitol, pH 7.2 adjusted by CsOH. The osmolarity of this solution was 300 mosmol/kg·H2O. In the intracellular dialysis experiments, anti-ClC-3 antibody was diluted to 300 μg/ml by distilled water, and added to the pipette solution (final concentration was 5 μg/ml.). For preabsorbed anti-ClC-3 antibody, antibody and antigen were dissolved by distilled water separately, mixed in a ratio of 1:10, then stored at 4 °C overnight. The mixed solution was added to the pipette solution. Finally, the pipette solution contained 5 μg/ml antibody and 50 μg/ml antigen. The osmolarity of the pipette solutions was not significantly altered by adding antibody alone or antigen-presorbed antibody. Based on the shift of the reversal potential (ΔErev), the permeability ratios (PX/PCl) were calculated by the modified Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation shown in Equation 1, Px/PCl=([Cl−]nexp(−ΔErevF/RT)−[Cl−]s)/[X−]s(Eq. 1) where [Cl-]n and [Cl-]s are the Cl- concentrations in the normal and substituted extracellular solutions. [X-]s is the concentration of the substituting anion. F is the Faraday constant, R is the gas constant, and T is absolute temperature. Statistical Analysis—All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed using the Student's t test or analysis of variance. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. Anti-ClC-3 antibody and antigen were supplied by Alomone Labs (Jerusalem, Israel). Trypsin, CsCl, CsOH, l-aspartate acid, EGTA, TEAC, Hepes, ATP-Mg, DIDS, 4-α-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (4α-PMA), PDBu, genistein, vanadate, Tris, Me2SO, and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 were obtained from Sigma. Expression of ClC-3 cDNA in A10 Cells—Expression of ClC-3 protein in A10 cells was determined by Western blot with the use of a polyclonal antibody directed against ClC-3. The anti-ClC-3 antibody recognized a major band at 80–90 kDa. The ClC-3 protein expression was significantly increased in ClC-3-A10 cells (Fig. 1). Effect of ClC-3 Antisense on Expression of ClC-3 Protein—To determine the uptake of oligonucleotide by A10 cell, the oligonucleotides were labeled with fluorescence. As shown in Fig. 2A, under resting conditions the fluorescence in the cells was negligible, but the fluorescence in cells treated with antisense, sense, or missense were greatly increased, which confirmed the uptake of oligonucleotides by these cells. Fig. 2B shows that 100 μg/ml ClC-3 antisense oligonucleotide decreased ClC-3 protein expression in a time-dependent manner. After 48 h of ClC-3 antisense treatment, the decrease in ClC-3 protein expression reached a maximum. Fig. 2C shows that the cells in the quiescent state were transfected with oligonucleotides by incubation for 48 h with Lipofectamine2000, the ClC-3 protein was decreased by 12.7 ± 1.6%, 26.8 ± 2.8%, 57.8 ± 2.4%, and 58.2 ± 2.3% (data from six different experiments; p < 0.01) in 5 μl/ml Lipofectamine2000 plus 25, 50, 100, and 200 μg/ml ClC-3 antisense, respectively. 100 μg/ml ClC-3 antisense reached a maximal effect. Sense, missense oligonucleotides, and Lipofectamine2000 did not alter ClC-3 protein expression (n = 6 for each group; p > 0.05 versus control). The Characteristics of Cl-Currents—In A10 cells, the patch clamp whole cell currents were very small when the cells were exposed in the isotonic solution. If the bath solution was changed from isotonic solution to hypotonic solution, it evoked the large outward rectifying currents (ICl.vol) with a reverse potential of -2.0 ± 1.5 mV. In ClC-3-A10 cells, hypotonic solution also evoked an outward rectifying current (ICl,ClC-3) with a reverse potential of -2.6 ± 1.2 mV. Compared with ICl.vol, ICl.ClC-3 was larger. The current densities of ICl.vol (n = 12) and ICl.ClC-3 (n = 19) were -23.5 ± 1.5 and -55.9 ± 2.7 pA/pF (p < 0.05 versus ICl.vol) at -80 mV, respectively, and 41.8 ± 2.8 and 100.6 ± 5.6 pA/pF (p < 0.01 versus ICl.vol)at +80 mV, respectively (Fig. 3, A and B). When the [Cl-]o in the bath solution was changed from 116 to 39 mm, the current was significantly decreased, with a change in the reverse potential from -1.6 ± 2.0 to 27.9 ± 2.6 mV in A10 cells (n = 6) and from -2.3 ± 1.7 to 26.6 ± 1.9 mV in ClC-3-A10 cells (Fig. 3, C and D). Both ICl.vol and ICl.ClC-3 were inhibited by DIDS. After exposure to DIDS, the current densities of ICl.vol (n = 8) and ICl.ClC-3 (n = 7) were reduced from -21.8 ± 2.4 to -14.3 ± 1.6 pA/pF and -56.0 ± 4.1 to -34.1 ± 2.5 pA/pF at -80 mV, respectively, and reduced from 36.4 ± 3.0 to 16.4 ± 1.6 pA/pF and 101.1 ± 9.1 to 41.1 ± 4.9 pA/pF at +80 mV, respectively. DIDS had the same inhibition in ICl.vol and ICl.ClC-3. However, DIDS had more inhibition on currents at +80 mV than that at -80 mV (Fig. 3, E and F). This indicates that the effects of DIDS on ICl.vol and ICl.ClC-3 were voltage-dependent. 100 μg/ml ClC-3 antisense remarkably decreased ICl.vol by 54.3 ± 4.6% at +80 mV and 56.0 ± 5.8% at -80 mV, which were similar to the decreased magnitude of ClC-3 protein expression induced by 100 μg/ml ClC-3 antisense, whereas sense, missense, and Lipofectamine2000 failed to inhibit this current. Based on results from the ClC-3 antisense experiments, we further examined the inhibitory effects of intracellular dialysis of an anti-ClC-3 antibody on ICl,vol and ICl,ClC-3. Fig. 4 shows that intracellular dialysis of an anti-ClC-3 antibody could completely block the ICl,vol (Fig. 4, A and B) and ICl,ClC-3 (Fig. 4, C and D). To exclude nonspecificity of the anti-ClC-3 antibody, the effect of preabsorbed anti-ClC-3 antibody on the current was determined. It was found that intracellular dialysis of preabsorbed anti-ClC-3 antibody did not inhibit ICl,vol and ICl,ClC-3 (Fig. 4, A and B). Table I illustrates the anion selectivity of both the ICl,vol channel in A10 cell and ICl,ClC-3 channel in ClC-3-A10 cell. The reverse potential induced by I- was more minus than that by Cl-, whereas aspartate- produced a positive reverse potential. The anion selectivity order of these channels was as follows: I- > Cl- > aspartate-. There was no significant difference in reverse potentials induced by anions and the anion permeability between ICl,vol and ICl,ClC-3.Table IShifts in reversal potential (mV) induced by different anions and their relative permeability (permeability ratio of anions) in A10 and ClC-3-A10 cellsnA10nClC-3-A10Cl-6-1.0 ± 0.97-2.0 ± 0.9I-6-7.5 ± 0.57-7.9 ± 0.8Asp-636.8 ± 2.8737.6 ± 2.1PI/PCl61.29 ± 0.0671.26 ± 0.08PAsp/PCl60.21 ± 0.0570.22 ± 0.05 Open table in a new tab The Change in [Cl-]i Induced by Hypotonic Solution—In [Cl-]i measuring experiments, change of the medium from isotonic solution to hypotonic solution significantly decreased [Cl-]i in A10 from 31.1 ± 2.1 to 24.9 ± 1.2 mm (n = 30; p < 0.01 versus isotonic solution), whereas in ClC-3-A10 cells, the hypotonic solution induced more of a decrease in [Cl-]i than that in A10 cells. The [Cl-]i in ClC-3-A10 cells was reduced from 30.6 ± 1.1 to 19.9 ± 1.0 mm (n = 30; p < 0.05 versus A10 cell in hypotonic solution). In contrast, 100 μg/ml ClC-3 antisense significantly inhibited the decrease in [Cl-]i induced by hypotonic solution, and made [Cl-]i have a lower response to hypotonic challenge. [Cl-]i was diminished from 31.1 ± 2.1 to 28.5 ± 1.9 mm (n = 30; p < 0.05 versus A10 cell in hypotonic solution; Fig. 5). Effects of PDBu, Genistein, and Vanadate on ICl,vol, ICl,ClC-3, and [Cl-]i—Fig. 6A illustrates that 100 nm PDBu completely blocked ICl,vol (A, top trace in a) and ICl,ClC-3 (A, bottom trace in a). The decrease in [Cl-]i induced by hypotonic solution in A10 and ClC-3-A10 cells was completely reverted to normal levels by PDBu (Fig. 6D), whereas, 4α-PMA (negative control for phorbol ester activation of PKC) had no significant effect on ICl,vol (A, top trace in b), ICl,ClC-3 (A, bottom trace in b), and [Cl-]i induced by hypotonic solution in A10 and ClC-3-A10 cells (Fig. 6D). Fig. 6B shows that 30 μm genistein completely inhibited ICl,vol (top trace) and ICl,ClC-3 (bottom trace). The levels of [Cl-]i induced by hypotonic solution in A10 and ClC-3-A10 cells were almost elevated to the normal level by genistein (Fig. 6E). Whereas, the protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, sodium orthovanadate, potentiated ICl.vol (Fig. 6C, top trace) and ICl,ClC-3 (Fig. 6C, bottom trace) in a voltage-independent manner. The densities of currents for ICl,vol before and after exposure to 500 μm vanadate were -24.1 ± 2.3 and -34.2 ± 3.1 pA/pF at -80 mV (n = 8), respectively, and 40.2 ± 2.9 and 55.6 ± 2.7 pA/pF at +80 mV (n = 8), respectively. For ICl,ClC-3, the densities of currents were -63.5 ± 5.2 and -94.7 ± 5.0 pA/pF at -80 mV (n = 8), respectively, and 96.7 ± 5.4 and 141.4 ± 6.5 pA/pF at +80 mV (n = 8), respectively. The increases in ICl.vol and ICl.ClC-3 induced by vanadate were 45.7 ± 4.4 and 48.5 ± 5.0% at -80 mV, and 47.1 ± 4.8 and 49.3 ± 4.7% at +80 mV, respectively. This was consistent with the effect of vanadate on [Cl-]i. This protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor further significantly reduced [Cl-]i level, which was in lower level induced by hypotonic solution, from 24.8 ± 1.6 to 21.2 ± 1.4 mm (n = 30; p < 0.05) in A10 cells, and from 20.9 ± 1.3 to 16.2 ± 1.1 mm (n = 30; p < 0.05) in ClC-3-A10 cells (Fig. 6F). In the present study, we first demonstrated that hypotonic solution significantly reduced [Cl-]i and simultaneously activated an outward rectifying ICl,vol in A10 cells. Both ClC-3 antisense and intracellular dialysis of anti-ClC-3 antibody significantly inhibited the hypotonicity-induced decrease in [Cl-]i and activation of ICl,vol. We then found that overexpression of ClC-3 in A10 cells (ClC-3-A10 cells) yielded a larger ICl,vol with the same reverse potential, sensitivity to voltage-dependent inhibition by DIDS, and anion selectivity (I- > Cl- > aspartate-) as that of endogenous ICl.vol. in A10 cells under hypotonic conditions. Furthermore, we showed that the hypotonic cell swelling induced more decrease in [Cl-]i in ClC-3-A10 cells, and activation of ICl.ClC-3 also was remarkably inhibited by intracellular dialysis of anti-ClC-3 antibody. Finally, we found that hypotonic cell swelling-induced changes in [Cl-]i are not only intimately linked to the action of ICl.vol and ICl.ClC-3 but also, as having been reported for ICl.vol and ICl.ClC-3 in other cells (16von Weikersthal S.F. Barrand M.A. Hladky S.B. J. Physiol. 1999; 516: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 17Co-ca-Prados M. Sanchez-Torres J. Peterson-Yantorno K. Civan M.M. J. Membr.

Physiol. 2003; 285: G938-G948PubMed Google Scholar), well controlled by endogenous PKC and proteintyrosine phosphorylation. These data provide compelling evidence that ClC-3 channels are responsible for the Cl- transportation and ICl.vol during hypotonic perturbations in A10 cells. The molecular identification of the protein responsible for ICl.vol has been particularly difficult to resolve. The main reason for this difficulty is that endogenous ICl.vol is expressed practically in all types of cells, which can be always superimposed with membrane currents because of transgenic expression of candidate genes. Several molecular candidates responsible for ICl.vol were previously proposed: 1) the multidrug transporter, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of transporters (11Valverde M.A. Diaz M. Sepulveda F.V. Gill D.R. Hyde S.C. Higgins C.F. Nature. 1992; 355: 830-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar), 2) pICln, which encodes a small 235 amino acid protein with little homology to any known anion channel structure (12Paulmichl M. Li Y. Wickman K. Ackerman M. Peralta E. Clapham D. Nature. 1992; 356: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), 3) ClC-2, a member of the large ClC superfamily of voltage-dependent Cl- channels (13Grunder S. Thiemann A. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1992; 360: 759-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), and 4) ClC-3, also a member of the ClC superfamily (4Duan D. Winter C. Crowley S. Hume J.R. Horowitz B. Nature. 1997; 390: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Although both P-gp and pICln expression appeared to yield chloride currents with many of the properties of native ICl.vol, it now seems clear that the currents observed in these studies were not due to expression of either P-gp or pICln but likely due to contamination by endogenous ICl.vol (14Clapham D.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 623-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Although ClC-2 represents a bona fide anion channel regulated by cell volume, expressed ClC-2 currents differ significantly in voltage sensitivity, anion selectivity, and pharmacology from conventional, outwardly rectifying ICl.vol found in most cells (15Jentsch T.J. Gunther W. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The ClC-3 hypothesis was based on the fact that stable or transient transfection of a full-length ClC-3 cDNA cloned from guinea pig ventricle (gpClC-3) into NIH/3T3 cells yielded a basally active chloride conductance that was strongly modulated by cell volume (4Duan D. Winter C. Crowley S. Hume J.R. Horowitz B. Nature. 1997; 390: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Many properties of the expressed IgpClC-3 resemble those reported for native ICl.vol in heart and other tissues, including an outwardly rectifying unitary slope conductance of 40 pS, an anion selectivity of I- > Cl- > Asp-, inactivation at positive potentials, increase by extracellular hypotonicity, and inhibition by hypertonicity, by extracellular nucleotides, by phorbol esters, by stilbene derivatives, and by tamoxifen. Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis of an asparagine near the end of the transmembrane-spanning domains (N579K) altered rectification and anion selectivity of the expressed IgpClC-3. These observations were initially confirmed by other independent studies of several groups (16von Weikersthal S.F. Barrand M.A. Hladky S.B. J.

Thus, ClC-3 represented a viable molecular candidate responsible for native ICl.vol in heart or any other mammalian cell type (19Valverde M.A. Curr. Opin.

The magnitude of swelling-activated Cl- current is not significantly different between nontransfected and human ClC-3 cDNA-transfected HEK293 cells (22Weylandt K.H. Valverde M.A. Nobles M. Raguz S.

In ClC-3 cDNA-transfected CHO-K1 cells, the ClC-3 channel current was not identified in the endogenous swelling-activated channel current, and not activated by cell swelling (20Li X. Shimada K. Showalter L.A. Weinman S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35994-35998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Some of these inconsistencies might be attributed to failure to successfully express functional ClC-3 protein and/or difficulties in effectively separating transgenic currents from endogenously expressed Cl- currents present in expression cell systems such as X. oocytes and some mammalian cells (25Jentsch T.J. Stein V. Weinreich F. Zdebik A.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 503-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the controversy surrounding the actual physiological role of ClC-3 Cl- channels was additionally fueled by the report that disruption of the Clcn3 gene did not change the volume-regulated chloride current in hepatocytes, pancreatic acinar cells (26Stobrawa S.M. Breiderhoff T. Takamori S. Engel D. Schweizer M. Zdebik A.A. Bosl M.R. Ruether K. Jahn H. Draguhn A. Jahn R. Jentsch T.J.

Weinman S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1483-C1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), ClC-3 was primarily localized to intracellular membranes where it was proposed to function primarily in vesicular acidification, although other studies have clearly demonstrated plasma membrane localization of heterologously expressed ClC-3 (22Weylandt K.H.

Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5572-5582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in various cell types. Recently, it has been shown that volume-sensitive osmolyte and anion channels (VSOACs) currents activated by hypotonic medium in atrial myocytes and pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells from Clcn3-/- and Clcn3+/+ mice were remarkably similar in activation kinetics, steady-state current densities, slight outward rectification, and anion selectivity. However, there also are significant differences in sensitivity to PKC regulation, inhibition by intracellular dialysis with a new anti-ClC-3 antibody, [ATP]i depletion, and high free [Mg2+]i between them (34Yamamoto-Mizuma S. Wang G.X. Liu L.L. Schegg K. Hatton W. Duan D. Howowitz T.L.B. Lamb F.S. Hume J.R. J. Physiol. 2004; 557: 439-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These authors have suggested that in response to Clcn3 gene deletion, there may be compensatory changes in expression of other proteins that alter VSOAC channel subunit composition or associated regulatory subunits that give rise to VSOACs with different properties. It appears that differential sensitivity of native VSOACs to anti-ClC3 antibody and phorbol esters in different cell types in normal animals is consistent with the possible expression of distinct VSOACs subtypes. In fact, the responses of volume-regulated chloride current to PKC regulation in vascular smooth muscle cells from different blood vessels are not the same. Activation of PKC by PDBu increased the amplitude of swelling-activated chloride current in rabbit portal vein (35Ellershaw D.C. Greenwood I.A. Large W.A. J. Physiol. 2002; 542: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), whereas PKC activation inhibited ICl.vol in mouse pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (34Yamamoto-Mizuma S. Wang G.X. Liu L.L. Schegg K. Hatton W. Duan D. Howowitz T.L.B. Lamb F.S. Hume J.R. J. Physiol. 2004; 557: 439-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). As shown in this study, PDBu significantly inhibited ICl.vol and increased [Cl-]i under hypotonic condition. Our results provide evidence to support that ClC-3 channels are responsible for volume-regulated Cl- transportation and Cl- currents and may play an important role in volume regulation in A10 vascular smooth muscle cells. Alternatively, it is possible that contradictory data about ClC-3 in mediating cell volume regulation are caused by differences in [Cl-]i and ClC-3 expression levels in different types of cells. In vascular smooth muscle cells, [Cl-]i is generally higher than other tissues, and the Cl- equilibrium potential (ECl) is approximately -20 mV, which is more positive than the resting membrane potential. Therefore, activation of the Cl- channels will lead to a net Cl- efflux followed by the membrane depolarization (36Martens J.R. Genband C.H. PSEBM. 1998; 218: 192-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 37Chipperfield A.R. Harper A.A. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2000; 74: 175-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). It is currently not known why [Cl-]i is higher in vascular smooth muscle. In sharp contrast to vascular smooth muscle cells, some neurons have passively distributed intracellular Cl-, and it sets the resting membrane potential closer to ECl (38Maduke M. Miller C. Mindell J.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Struct. 2000; 29: 411-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). It is interesting that the ClC-3 expression level in vascular smooth muscle cells, including aorta smooth muscle cells is very high (39Lamb F.S. Clayton G.H. Liu B.X. Smith R.L. Barna T.J. Schutte B.C. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1999; 31: 657-666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), whereas only a small fraction of ClC-3 is expressed on the surface membrane in hepatocytes CHO-K1 cells and human hepatoma cell line Huh-7 (28Li X. Wang T. Zhao Z. Weinman S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1483-C1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), Our results may, therefore, shed a new light on understanding the regulation of intracellular Cl- concentrations in different cell types. We thank Dr. Joseph R. Hume and Dr. Dayue Duan for providing us with the full-length gpClC-3 cDNA in this study and also for helpful discussions."

Ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotic cells is a multistep process that takes place primarily in the nucleolus where the individual stages of assembly correlate with specific subclasses of ultrastructures (1Busch H. Smetana K. The Nucleolus. Academic Press, New York1970Google Scholar, 2Hadjiolov A.A. Cell Biology Monography. Springer-Verlag, New York1985Google Scholar, 3Scheer U. Hock R. Curr. Opin.

The process begins with transcription of the ribosomal DNA at the border between the fibrillar center and the dense fibrillar components of the nucleolus. The product of transcription, 47 S pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) 1The abbreviations used are: pre-rRNA, pre-ribosomal RNA; RNP, ribonucleoprotein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; NPM, nucleoplasmin; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; cDNA, complementary DNA. in mammals, is processed into smaller pre-rRNA intermediates, which finally become 28, 5.8, and 18 S rRNA. The nascent pre-ribosomal particles of the dense fibrillar components eventually mature into granular components, with ribosomal proteins added at various steps in the process. Numerous non-ribosomal proteins and small nucleolar RNA participate in these steps. Protein B23 (NPM1, nucleophosmin) is an abundant nucleolar non-ribosomal protein whose locations and multiple activities suggest it plays a role in ribosome biogenesis. This protein is primarily localized to the granular component region with lesser amounts in the dense fibrillar components of the nucleolus (5Biggiogera M. Fakan S. Kaufmann S.H. Black A. Shaper J.H.

The nucleolar localization of B23 is dependent on the presence of active rDNA transcription (9Yung B.Y. Busch H. Chan P.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 826: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and it is found in association with maturing pre-ribosomal RNP particles (10Olson M.O. Wallace M.O. Herrera A.H.

In vitro experiments indicate B23 has nucleic acid binding activity and ribonuclease activities (12Dumbar T.S. Gentry G.A. Olson M.O.

Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2016-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In support of this, a splicing variant, B23.2, in which the C-terminal 35-amino acid sequence is absent, exists both in the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm (15Okuwaki M. Tsujimoto M. Nagata K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2016-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 17Wang D. Baumann A. Szebeni A. Olson M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30994-30998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recent studies provide evidence for a direct role of the ribonuclease activity of B23 in processing the internal transcribed spacer 2 of pre-ribosomal RNA, especially in the production of 28 S rRNA from 32 S pre-rRNA (19Itahana K. Bhat K.P. Jin A. Itahana Y. Hawke D. Kobayashi R. Zhang Y. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1151-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Protein B23 also has molecular chaperone activity. This chaperone activity is regulated by protein kinase CK2 phosphorylation; this activity possibly prevents protein aggregation in the nucleolus under high macromolecular concentration conditions and facilitates the ribosome assembly process (20Olson M.O. Hingorani K. Szebeni A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2002; 219: 199-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 21Szebeni A. Olson M.O.

Chem. 2003; 278: 9107-9115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Protein B23 has additional activities that are not directly related to ribosome biogenesis. It binds the centrosome during early prometaphase (23Zatsepina O.V. Rousselet A. Chan P.K. Olson M.O. Jordan E.G. Bornens M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 455-466PubMed Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of B23 by CDK2/cyclin E and Polo-like kinase 1 is essential for duplication of the centrosome (24Okuda M. Horn H.F. Tarapore P. Tokuyama Y. Smulian A.G. Chan P.K. Knudsen E.S. Hofmann I.A. Snyder J.D. Bove K.E. Fukasawa K. Cell. 2000; 103: 127-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 25Zhang H. Shi X. Paddon H. Hampong M. Dai W. Pelech S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; Google Scholar). Many proteins involved in cell cycle control have also been shown to interact with B23, including p53, HDM2, ARF, and the BRCA1-BARD1 ubiquitin ligase (19Itahana K. Bhat K.P. Jin A. Itahana Y. Hawke D. Kobayashi R. Zhang Y. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1151-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 26Colombo E. Marine J.C. Danovi D. Falini B. Pelicci P.G. Nat.

Chem. 2004; Google Scholar). It has been proposed that B23 also works as the protein mediating the cross-talk between ribosome biogenesis and cell cycle progression, thereby making it a potential valuable target for cancer therapy (29Zhang Y. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Because several other proteins have been shown to interact with protein B23 (20Olson M.O. Hingorani K. Szebeni A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2002; 219: 199-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), we have attempted to systematically identify its interacting partners to better understand its role in the nucleolus. To this end, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen. We found that NPM3 (nucleoplasmin 3) was one of the major proteins interacting with B23. NPM3 was previously identified among the genes activated by mouse tumor virus proviral insertions and is often co-activated with proto-oncogene Fgf8 because of its close proximity to that gene (30Kuriki K. Kamiakito T. Yoshida H. Saito K. Fukayama M. Tanaka A. Cell Mol. Biol. (Noisy-Le-Grand). 2000; 46: 1147-1156PubMed Google Scholar). It is widely expressed in different adult mouse tissues (30Kuriki K. Kamiakito T. Yoshida H. Saito K. Fukayama M. Tanaka A. Cell Mol. Biol. (Noisy-Le-Grand). 2000; 46: 1147-1156PubMed Google Scholar, 31MacArthur C.A. Shackleford G.M. Genomics. 1997; 42: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 32Shackleford G.M. Ganguly A. MacArthur C.A. BMC Genomics. 2001; 2: 8-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Experiments with deletion mutants of B23 indicate that the residue 35–90 sequence of B23 is essential for its interaction with NPM3. Evidence that NPM3 possibly regulates the function of B23 in ribosome biogenesis was provided in that ectopic expression of NPM3 slowed pre-rRNA synthesis and processing; this effect was not seen with mutants that did not interact with B23. Yeast Two-hybrid System Screen—The yeast two-hybrid screen was performed using the Matchmaker two-hybrid system 2 and GAL 4 Matchmaker mouse liver cDNA library (Clontech, BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, full-length B23 was cloned into shuttle vector pAS2–1 and used to transform yeast strain Y190. The clone expressing BD-B23 was amplified and transformed with the cDNA library. Positive clones were selected by growing the transformed yeast on S.D./-His/-Leu/-Trp (25 mm 3-amino-1, 2, 4-triazole) and detected by the β-galactosidase assay using X-gal as the substrate. The plasmids were then purified from the positive clones and sequenced. Plasmid Construction—Mammalian transient expression vector pFLAG-CMV-5a was purchased from Sigma. Full-length NPM3 was constructed by PCR using the plasmid purified from yeast as the template, in which an overlapping primer corresponding to the missing part of the cDNA of NPM3 was designed according to the sequence reported previously (31MacArthur C.A. Shackleford G.M. Genomics. 1997; 42: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa or CMT3 cells (33Gerard R.D. Gluzman Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3231-3240Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml of penicillin and streptomycin. Transfection was performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions (34Dundr M. Misteli T. Olson M.O. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 433-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Fluorescence microscopy and cell lysis were generally performed 2 days after transfection. To enrich NPM3-overexpressing cells, the CMT3 cells were co-transfected with FLAG-tagged NPM3/mutants or empty FLAG vector and a puromycin marker vector. After 2 days, the cells were cultured in the medium containing 2.5 μg/ml puromycin for 1 week and the puromycin-resistant cells were replated for further analysis. Cell Lysis and Co-immunoprecipitation—HeLa or CMT3 cells cultured on 35-mm tissue culture dishes were scraped into a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, and 10 μl/ml proteinase inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and sonicated three times for 20 s at 20-s intervals. The supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The cell lysate was either processed for co-immunoprecipitation or flash frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C for future use. Co-immunoprecipitation was performed using an anti-FLAG M2 resin purchased from Sigma. 40 μl of 50% M2 resin was added to the transfected cell lysate and incubated at 4 °C for 3 h. The resin was then washed 5 times with 500 μl of lysis buffer, and the co-immunoprecipitate was eluted by incubation with 100 μl of elution buffer containing 100 mm glycine (pH 3.5) for 5 min at room temperature. The eluted proteins were then precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, washed with ethanol-ether, and frozen for further analysis. Wherever indicated, the resin was washed with the lysis buffers containing modified concentrations of NaCl. Anti-GFP antibody-conjugated resin was made by cross-linking a GFP monoclonal antibody (Roche Diagnostics) to the protein G beads using a Seize X protein G immunoprecipitation kit purchased from Pierce Biotechnology, Inc. Co-immunoprecipitation was done using the same procedure as described above, except that the pH of the elution buffer was 2.8 instead of 3.5. Metabolic Labeling and RNA Analysis—RNA was labeled with 32Pby culturing CMT3 cells in phosphate-free medium supplemented with 20 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate. The co-immunoprecipitation experiments were done as described above, except that the lysis buffer was supplemented with 80 units/μl RNAsin (Promega) and the incubation time was shortened to 1 h to prevent degradation of the RNA. The co-immunoprecipitates were then eluted with 0.2% SDS and digested with proteinase K and phenol-extracted; the RNAs were precipitated by ethanol and redissolved in loading buffer. The RNAs were separated on a 1% denaturing agarose gel and exposed to film. To measure RNA synthesis and processing, the CMT3 cells were incubated in medium containing [3H]uridine (2.5 μCi/ml) for 30 min and then chased in nonradioactive medium for various times. The total RNA was purified by an RNAqueous kit from Ambion, Inc. The RNA from equal numbers of cells was separated on 1% denaturing agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane, treated with En3Hance (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and exposed to film. Pre-rRNA processing was measured using l-[methyl-3H]methionine to take advantage of the rapid turnover of the cellular methionine pool (35Strezoska Z. Pestov D.G. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5516-5528Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The cells were starved for 15 min in methionine-free medium and then incubated for 30 min in medium containing l-[methyl-3H]methionine (50 μCi/ml). The incorporated label was chased by adding unlabeled methionine (15 μg/ml) for various lengths of time. After that, the RNA was isolated and analyzed as described above. NPM3 Interacts with B23 in Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—In an effort to identify proteins interacting with B23, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed. Full-length cDNA was constructed into a pAS2–1 vector as the bait, in which B23 was fused with the GAL4 protein binding domain. Yeast strain Y190 was co-transformed with pAS2–1/B23 and a mouse liver pACT2 cDNA library in which the GAL4 protein activation domain was fused to the cDNAs. Multiple clones were picked, and the sequencing of those clones revealed that many contained a nearly full-length cDNA for the protein NPM3 (31MacArthur C.A. Shackleford G.M. Genomics. 1997; 42: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), which lacked 30 nucleic acid base pairs at its 5′-end. To test whether NPM3 was a true positive clone, co-transformation of yeast with control vectors was performed. Yeast strain Y190 was co-transformed with pACT2-NPM3 and pAS2–1-B23; controls were Y190 cells co-transformed with pACT2-NPM3 and vectors pAS2–1, or pACT2-NPM3 and pLAM5–1, which encoded the activation domain protein fused with an unrelated protein, Lamin C. The results indicated that only those co-transformants containing pACT2-NPM3 and pAS2–1-B23 were able to develop blue spots in the β-galactosidase assay (Fig. 1). This confirmed the specific interaction between protein NPM3 and B23 in yeast. Other positive clones were also found and tested in the assay (data not shown), including ribosomal proteins S15 and S27, Y box-binding protein 1 (YB-1), and HLA-B-associated transcript-4 (BAT4). We chose NPM3 for further study because of its apparent close relationship with B23 (see below). Co-immunoprecipitation of Endogenous B23 by NPM3— NPM3 is conserved in many higher eukaryotic species, including Xenopus, mouse, and human, and it is widely expressed in adult mouse tissues (31MacArthur C.A. Shackleford G.M. Genomics. 1997; 42: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Proteins NPM3 and B23 are clearly related in that both of them belong to the nucleoplasmin family; amino acid sequence analysis indicates that they share many similar features (Fig. 2). In addition, the orthologs of NPM3 (NO29) and B23 (NO38) were found to exist in the same complex in Xenopus oocytes (36Zirwes R.F. Schmidt-Zachmann M.S. Franke W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11387-11392Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We conducted further experiments using co-immunoprecipitation to confirm the interaction of NPM3 and B23 in mammalian cells. Full-length NPM3 cDNA was constructed by the overlapping PCR method using the selected cDNA clone as the template. The cDNA was inserted into the pFLAG-CMV-5 vector, which placed a FLAG epitope at the C-terminal end of the protein. CMT3 cells were either transfected with NPM3-FLAG or the empty FLAG vector. Total cell lysates were made by sonication and clarified by centrifugation. The expressed FLAG-tagged NPM3 was immunoprecipitated by an anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel. The co-immunoprecipitates were eluted by low pH buffer and run on a SDS-PAGE gel, followed by transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane and analysis by Western blotting. Endogenous B23 detected by an anti-B23 monoclonal antibody (9Yung B.Y. Busch H. Chan P.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 826: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) was present in the co-immunoprecipitates of NPM3 (Fig. 3). The complex containing the two proteins was very stable and resistant to dissociation by high concentrations of salt (Fig. 4A), suggesting their association was largely because of hydrophobic interactions. B23 was previously reported to be co-immunoprecipitated along with nucleolin by an anti-nucleolin antibody, and RNA was required to maintain a stable complex between the two proteins (11Pinol-Roma S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 77-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To examine whether this is the case in the interaction of protein NPM3 and B23, similar nuclease/ribonuclease digestion conditions were used to treat the cell lysates before co-immunoprecipitation. No significant differences were seen before and after nuclease treatment (Fig. 4B). This suggests that B23 and NPM3 interact directly with each other in the complex.Fig. 4The interaction between B23 and NPM3 is resistant to dissociation by high concentrations of salt and ribonuclease treatments.A, CMT3 cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged NPM3. Co-immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody-conjugated resin with identical aliquots of cell lysates. The resins were washed extensively with lysis buffer containing either 150, 300, or 600 mm NaCl before elution. B, cell lysates were pretreated with 100 μg/ml RNase A, 100 units/ml DNase I, or 100 units/ml micrococcal nuclease (2 mm CaCl2 added) by incubation with these enzymes for 30 min at 30 °C before co-immunoprecipitation. Co-immunoprecipitates were separated on a 12% PAGE gel and then silver-stained.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Probing the Interacting Regions of B23 and NPM3—Several functional domains have been mapped in protein B23 (18Hingorani K. Szebeni A. Olson M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24451-24457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). For example, the deletion of its N-terminal end will cause B23 to lose its ability to oligomerize and most of its chaperone activity; the 35 amino acids in its C-terminal tail are essential for the nucleic acid binding activity of B23 (17Wang D. Baumann A. Szebeni A. Olson M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30994-30998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Comparing the sequences between B23 and NPM3, about 42% of the N-terminal sequence of B23 is conserved in NPM3 (Fig. 2). This segment might contribute to the interaction between the two proteins, possibly through hetero-oligomerization. To test this possibility, a series of plasmids containing GFP-tagged deletion mutants of B23 were co-transfected into CMT3 cells with FLAG-tagged NPM3. B23 mutants were immunoprecipitated by anti-GFP monoclonal antibody-conjugated beads, and the co-immunoprecipitated NPM3 was detected by an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. All of the mutants tested, except B23ΔN90, interacted with NPM3 (Fig. 5). In the mutant B23ΔN90, in which the oligomerization domain of B23 was almost completely deleted, the interaction with NPM3 was abolished. In contrast, the deletion mutants B23ΔC35 and B23ΔC132 that had lost the nucleic acid binding domain were still able to bind NPM3. Thus, the interaction between B23 and NPM3 is largely dependent on the oligomerization domain of B23 and not on its nucleic acid binding region. Similarly, the deletion mutants of NPM3, NPM3ΔN30 and NPM3ΔN90, were also made and tagged with FLAG. Endogenous B23 was able to be co-immunoprecipitated by NPM3ΔN30 but not by NPM3ΔN90, suggesting amino acids 30–90 in the N-terminal homologous region of NPM3 were required for interaction with B23. B23, but not NPM3, Is Associated with 28 S rRNA—One of the most prominent differences between the sequences of protein NPM3 and protein B23 is that only protein B23 has a nucleic acid binding domain located in its C-terminal tail (Fig. 2). In vitro experiments using Escherichia coli-expressed protein B23 showed that it binds DNA and RNA nonspecifically (12Dumbar T.S. Gentry G.A. Olson M.O. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9495-9501Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). 2K. Hingorani, unpublished data. To compare the possible association of B23 and NPM3 with nucleic acids in the cell, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments separately for B23 and NPM3. As shown in Fig. 6, the complexes containing B23 showed strong association with 28 S rRNA, but no RNAs were found in the complexes formed by NPM3. Because a portion of B23 is also co-precipitated with NPM3, it seems likely that this portion of B23 is not bound to RNA (also see “Discussion”). Localization of NPM3 in Cells—B23 is primarily located in the nucleoli of interphase cells (34Dundr M. Misteli T. Olson M.O. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 433-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 37Dundr M. Leno G.H. Hammarskjold M.L. Rekosh D. Helga-Maria C. Olson M.O. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2811-2823PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, most of the NPM3 was located in the nucleoli of the cells, although the signal of NPM3 was more diffuse than that of B23 (Fig. 7, before Actinomycin D treatment). The nucleolar localization of B23 requires active rRNA gene transcription; treatment of cells with inhibitors of pre-rRNA synthesis, including actinomycin D, results in translocation of the protein from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm (9Yung B.Y. Busch H. Chan P.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 826: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 37Dundr M. Leno G.H. Hammarskjold M.L. Rekosh D. Helga-Maria C. Olson M.O. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2811-2823PubMed Google Scholar). NPM3 also has translocation characteristics similar to those of B23. As shown in Fig. 7, HeLa cells transfected with either B23-FLAG or NPM3-FLAG were incubated with 0.5 μg/ml actinomycin D for 45 min. B23 or NPM3 was then detected by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. Both B23 and NPM3 translocated from the nucleolus and distributed into the nucleoplasm, suggesting that active rRNA transcription was essential for their nucleolar location. Ectopic Expression of NPM3 Inhibits Pre-rRNA Transcription and Processing—Recent studies have implicated protein B23 in pre-rRNA processing (19Itahana K. Bhat K.P. Jin A. Itahana Y. Hawke D. Kobayashi R. Zhang Y. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1151-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Considering the interaction of NPM3 with B23 and correlation between rRNA synthesis and NPM3 localization (Fig. 7), we evaluated the effect of overexpression of NPM3 on ribosome biogenesis. Cells transfected with NPM3 and its deletion mutants were enriched by drug selection. Using an antibody to the N-terminal sequence of NPM3 (kindly provided by Dr. Marion Schmidt-Zachmann), the amount of NPM3 in the cells transfected with NPM3 was about twice that of the control cells as determined by Western blot analysis (data not shown). The cells were pulse-labeled using [3H]uridine and chased for 0, 2, and 4 h; their RNA was extracted, and the RNA from equal numbers of cells was loaded on the gel. As shown in Fig. 8A, there was a dramatic reduction in the production of 18 and 28 S rRNAs (Fig. 8A, 4-h chase) in the cells overexpressing NPM3 and NPM3ΔN30. The reduction of rRNA production could result from the inhibition of transcription and/or processing. The 0-min chase times of incorporation approximately represent the relative rates of 47 S pre-rRNA transcription; in cells expressing NPM3 and NPM3ΔN30, this rate was reduced to an average of 33 and 35% of the control cells, respectively (Fig. 8B). No significant change in rRNA production was seen for the cells expressing NPM3ΔN90. To better examine differences in the processing rates in these cells, we adjusted the amount of RNA loaded so that each lane contained the same amount of radioactivity. l-[methyl-3H]Methionine was used for labeling because of the rapid turnover of the cellular methionine pool (35Strezoska Z. Pestov D.G. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5516-5528Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In cells expressing NPM3 and NPM3ΔN30, the half-life of 47 S pre-rRNA was increased to at least twice that of the control cells (Fig. 8, C and D), which suggests that the processing of pre-rRNA in NPM3-expressing cells is also suppressed. In this study we have provided evidence that protein NPM3 is an interacting partner of nucleolar phosphoprotein B23 and that it may regulate B23 function in ribosome biogenesis. First, the yeast two-hybrid screen and the co-immunoprecipitation of B23 with NPM3 indicated that these two proteins interacted with each other in vitro and in vivo. Second, we detected an RNP complex that contained 28 S rRNA and protein B23, but there was no RNA found in the complex containing NPM3. Third, both of these proteins normally had nucleolar localization, but they translocated into the nucleoplasm after inhibition of rRNA transcription. Finally, expression of NPM3, but not its mutants that do not interact with B23, down-regulated pre-rRNA synthesis and processing, suggesting that interaction between NPM3 and B23 might be involved in regulating ribosome biogenesis. Unlike the association between B23 and nucleolin in which the presence of ribonucleic acid is required for the stable formation of the complex (11Pinol-Roma S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 77-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), the binding between B23 and NPM3 most likely results from direct interaction between the proteins (Fig. 4A). Considering that both proteins have very low pIs (B23, 4.62; NPM3, 4.71) and the complex is resistant to dissociation by high salt concentrations (Fig. 4B), hydrophobic forces could be the major contributor to this interaction. Coincidentally, the co-immunoprecipitation of protein NPM3 with deletion mutants of B23 suggests that the Asn-35-Asn-90 region of protein B23 plays an important role between their interactions; this appears to be the most hydrophobic region of B23. The functional domains of B23 have been well characterized (18Hingorani K. Szebeni A. Olson M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24451-24457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The residue 35–90 segment also covers most of the sequence mapped as essential for the chaperone activity and the oligomerization of B23. Therefore, it seems likely that the residue 35–90 region of B23 is responsible for its interaction with proteins, including its own oligomerization. Although B23 and NPM3 have many features in common, one striking difference is that the former seems to be associated with RNA whereas the latter is not. The interaction between B23 and nucleic acids has been extensively investigated in vitro (12Dumbar T.S. Gentry G.A. Olson M.O. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9495-9501Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 13Feuerstein N. Mond J.J. Kinchington P.R. Hickey R. Karjalainen Lindsberg M.L. Hay I. Ruyechan W.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1087: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This binding activity resides in its C-terminal end (17Wang D. Baumann A. Szebeni A. Olson M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30994-30998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hingorani K. Szebeni A. Olson M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24451-24457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The RNA binding activity of B23 is modulated by cyclin B/cdc2-mediated phosphorylation and has been implicated in its translocation from nucleoli to cytoplasm during mitosis (15Okuwaki M. Tsujimoto M. Nagata K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2016-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Until now there has been no preferred sequence found that B23 binds with in vitro. However, our co-immunoprecipitation data showed that in vivo B23 is preferentially associated with 28 S rRNA (Fig. 6). This preference is possibly rendered by other proteins residing in the same RNP complex with B23. Furthermore, this association with 28 S rRNA, which is one of the last species released during the processing of pre-rRNA, matches the ultrastructural location of B23 in the nucleolus. Protein B23 is primarily found in the granular component that contains the more mature pre-ribosomal RNP particles (5Biggiogera M. Fakan S. Kaufmann S.H. Black A. Shaper J.H. Busch H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1989; 37: 1371-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 6Biggiogera M. Burki K. Kaufmann S.H. Shaper J.H. Gas N. Amalric F. Fakan S. Development. 1990; 110: 1263-1270PubMed Google Scholar, 7Biggiogera M. Kaufmann S.H. Shaper J.H. Gas N. Amalric F. Fakan S. Chromosoma. 1991; 100: 162-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 8Spector D.L. Ochs R.L. Busch H. Chromosoma. 1984; 90: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Therefore, the association of B23 with 28 S rRNA is consistent with its location. Comparison of the B23 and NPM3 sequences reveals that the relatively short sequence of NPM3 does not have a segment similar to the nucleic acid binding tail of B23. This is consistent with no detectable RNAs being found in the complexes co-immunoprecipitated by NPM3 (Fig. 6). Because a portion of protein B23 is also co-precipitated with NPM3, this part of the protein B23 pool that forms a complex with NPM3 does not contain RNA. We concluded that there are at least two different complexes associated with B23, one of which contains 28 S rRNA whereas the other does not. NPM3 may form a complex with those “free” portions of B23 that do not associate with 28 S rRNA. Because B23 normally is not found in the mature ribosome, it has to be released from this rRNA complex before mature ribosomes are transported to the cytoplasm. The question then is, what are the factors that dissociate B23 from the maturing RNP particle? One candidate could be NPM3. Another candidate might be the variant form of B23, B23.2, which also does not have nucleic acid binding activity and has been reported to inhibit the rRNA binding activity of B23 (15Okuwaki M. Tsujimoto M. Nagata K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2016-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Many characteristics of protein B23 suggest that it participates in ribosome biogenesis. B23 is localized to the nucleolus during interphase when ribosomes are actively produced but translocates from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm after actinomycin D treatment, suggesting it is associated with the pre-rRNA transcriptional apparatus (9Yung B.Y. Busch H. Chan P.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 826: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This distribution of B23 also affects those proteins associated with it, such as the human immunodeficiency virus-1 Rev protein (37Dundr M. Leno G.H. Hammarskjold M.L. Rekosh D. Helga-Maria C. Olson M.O. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2811-2823PubMed Google Scholar). Although NPM3 also showed similar translocation after actinomycin D treatment (Fig. 7), it is unknown whether this is due to the direct effect of inhibition of pre-rRNA transcription or because of its association with B23. In vitro studies also suggest B23 is a pre-rRNA processing factor because it has ribonuclease activity and preferentially cleaves at specific sites in the second internal transcribed spacer (16Savkur R.S. Olson M.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4508-4515Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). However, the most direct evidence for this is that down-regulation of B23 by short interfering RNA caused a defective 32 S processing pathway and preferentially inhibited 28 S rRNA product formation (19Itahana K. Bhat K.P. Jin A. Itahana Y. Hawke D. Kobayashi R. Zhang Y. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1151-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). How those findings are related to the association of B23 with 28 S rRNA is unknown. In this study we found that expressing NPM3 inhibits both transcription and processing of pre-rRNA. This effect is likely related to the interaction between NPM3 and B23 in that no significant inhibition was observed in the cells expressing the NPM3 mutants not interacting with B23. It is possible that overexpressed NPM3 interferes with the function of B23 by altering the balance between the complexes formed by B23, with the effect of drawing B23 to a complex that does not contain 28 S rRNA. However, considering the interactions between B23 and cell signaling molecules (19Itahana K. Bhat K.P. Jin A. Itahana Y. Hawke D. Kobayashi R. Zhang Y. Mol.

The pegylation results in lower in vitro specific activity associated with the core IFN-α molecule that is related to the site of pegylation and size of polyethylene glycol (PEG) attached. We prepared purified, homogeneous, positional pegylation isomers of IFN-α2b that were monopegylated using 5–30-kDa linear PEG molecules attached at 7 primary reactive amino acid residues: Cys1, His34, Lys31, Lys83, Lys121, Lys131, and Lys134. The isomers were evaluated for STAT translocation and antiviral and antiproliferative activity. The site of pegylation strongly influenced activity relative to an IFN-α2b control. The highest residual activity was observed with the His34 positional isomers, and the lowest was observed with the Cys1 positional isomers. The Lys positional isomers demonstrated intermediate activity, with a general order of Lys134 > Lys83 ∼ Lys131 ∼ Lys121 > Lys31. The progressive relationship between decreased activity and increased PEG size suggests that pegylation may interfere with interaction and binding of IFN-α to the IFNAR1-IFNAR2 heterodimeric receptor. The higher specific activity associated with the His34 positional isomer suggests that this site may be favorable for pegylating IFN-α2b molecules.

Chronic hepatitis C is considered one of the major causes of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma and is the most common reason for liver transplantation in the United States (1Seeff L.B. Hoofnagle J.H. Clin. Liver Dis. 2003; 7: 261-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). It is estimated that there are 3 million chronically infected individuals in the United States and over 170 million worldwide (1Seeff L.B. Hoofnagle J.H. Clin.

Standard IFN-α therapy has a short (<12-h) half-life that requires subcutaneous injection three times weekly to maintain effective levels in the blood (2Glue P. Fang J.W. Rouzier-Panis R. Raffanel C. Sabo R. Gupta S.K. Salfi M. Jacobs S. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 68: 556-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). The short half-life of IFN-α has led to the development of longer lasting preparations achieved by the attachment of a large polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecule directly to IFN-α. Two different commercial preparations of PEG-IFN-α have been developed for clinical use, PEG-IFN-α2b (PEG-INTRON®) and PEG-IFN-α2a (Pegasys®); both have long half-lives (40 and 80 h, respectively) that permit once weekly administration (3Corporation Schering PEG-Intron, Prescribing Information.

Brassard D. Bordens R. Clin. Ther. 2002; 24: 1363-1383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and clinical trial results have shown further that both of the pegylated molecules produce sustained viral response rates superior to those achieved with their respective standard IFN-αs (5Lindsay K.L.

Whereas pegylation has proven to be highly effective for slowing the clearance of biological molecules, including IFN-α, and thus increasing serum half-life, it has been shown to also modify in vitro biological activity (8van Der Auwera P.

For instance, we have reported that pegylation of IFN-α2b with a 12-kDa linear PEG molecule results in a preparation that has a specific activity of 28% relative to IFN-α2b; the loss in activity was not due to structural perturbation of the core IFN-α2b core protein (9Grace M.

Palleroni A. Schaffer C.A. Spence C.L. Fung W.J. Porter J.E. Ehrlich G.K. Pan W. Xu Z.X. Modi M.W. Farid A. Berthold W. Graves M. Bioconjug.

Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 30: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). These two pegylated interferon-αs (PEG-IFN-αs) differ substantially in their postpegylation constituent properties. PEG-IFN-α2b has a 12-kDa linear PEG molecule attached using succinimidyl carbonate polyethylene glycol (SC-PEG) chemistry via a covalent urethane-like bond to the IFN-α2b protein (12Youngster S. Wang Y.S. Grace M. Bausch J. Bordens R. Wyss D.F. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2002; 8: 2139-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The pegylation linkage process results in a heterogeneous mixture of pegylation positional isomers that occur predominantly (∼50%) at the His34 amino acid residue, with the remaining positional isomers pegylated at various lysines, the N-terminal cysteine, a serine, tyrosine, and an alternate histidine residue (12Youngster S. Wang Y.S. Grace M. Bausch J. Bordens R. Wyss D.F. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2002; 8: 2139-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). PEG-IFN-α2a has a 40-kDa branched PEG molecule attached using N-hydroxysuccinimide-PEG chemistry via a covalent amide bond to the IFN-α2a protein (11Foser S. Schacher A. Weyer K.A. Brugger D. Dietel E. Marti S. Schreitmuller T. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 30: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). PEG-IFN-α2a is also a heterogeneous mixture of pegylated positional isomers consisting of four major positional isomers at Lys31, Lys121, Lys131, and Lys134 (10Bailon P. Palleroni A. Schaffer C.A. Spence C.L. Fung W.J. Porter J.E. Ehrlich G.K. Pan W. Xu Z.X. Modi M.W. Farid A. Berthold W. Graves M. Bioconjug. Chem. 2001; 12: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). The different relative specific activities reported for the IFN-α preparations suggested that the significant differences in the size of the PEG molecule or the distribution of pegylation positional isomers or both might be accountable. Fractionation of specific pegylation positional isomers for 12-kDa PEG-IFN-α2b have demonstrated that positional isomers had differential relative specific activities, with the His34 positional isomer retaining higher relative activity (37%) than the mixture of positional isomers (9Grace M. Youngster S. Gitlin G. Sydor W. Xie L. Westreich L. Jacobs S. Brassard D. Bausch J. Bordens R. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2001; 21: 1103-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Thus, changes in the activity of pegylated proteins appear to be influenced by the site of pegylation and, in some cases, the molecular weight of the PEG moiety (13Felix A.M. Lu Y.A. Campbell R.M. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1995; 46: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Our study was undertaken to directly determine the effects of size and site of pegylation on in vitro activity for IFN-α2b. This information is important for understanding how specific characteristics of PEG-IFN-αs influence their in vitro activity that may be translated to their in vivo efficacy. IFN-α2b (Intron® A) and 12-kDa PEG-IFN-α2b (PEG-INTRON) were manufactured by Schering-Plough Corp. (Kenilworth, NJ). The IFN-α2b international reference standard (95/566) was kindly provided by the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC, South Mimms, Hertfordshire, UK) (14Meager A. Gaines Das R. Zoon K. Mire-Sluis A. J. Immunol. Methods. 2001; 257: 17-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The specific activity for IFN-α2b, used as starting material in these studies, was 2.6 × 108 IU/mg, as calibrated against 95/566. IFN-α2a (Roferon®-A) and 40-kDa PEG-IFN-α2a (Pegasys) were manufactured by Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (Nutley, NJ). IFN-α2a was purchased and used directly from the commercial stock solution of 36 MIU/ml, which has a protein concentration of 133.3 μg/ml. For this study, the specific activity of IFN-α2a was determined empirically to be 2.4 × 108 IU/mg when calibrated against the IFN-α2b reference standard in the antiviral assay. The 40-kDa PEG-IFN-α2a was purchased and used directly from the commercial stock solutions of 135 and 180 μg/ml. Protein concentrations for IFN-α2a and 40-kDa PEG-IFN-α2a were confirmed prior to use. SC-PEG linkers with average PEG molecular masses of 5, 12, 20, and 30 kDa were purchased from Shearwater Polymers (Nektar Therapeutics, San Carlos, CA). Production and Isolation of Pegylated Interferon Isomers for Activity Studies—The primary amino acid residues of IFN-α reactive to pegylation are Cys1, Lys31, His34, Lys83, Lys121, Lys131, and Lys134. His34 and Cys1 are most reactive at a neutral pH, whereas the ϵ-amine groups of lysine residues are most reactive at basic pH (15Wylie D.C. Voloch M. Lee S. Liu Y.H. Cannon-Carlson S. Cutler C. Pramanik B. Pharm. Res. 2001; 18: 1354-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore, pegylation reactions utilizing SC-PEG 5 kDa, SC-PEG 12 kDa, SC-PEG 20 kDa, and SC-PEG 30 kDa were performed at room temperature at pH 6.5 to produce His34- and Cys1-modified positional isomers and pH 10 to produce the ϵ-amine-modified lysine positional isomers. Reactions at pH 6.5 were performed in 50 mm sodium phosphate at 22 °C, with SC-PEG 5 kDa, SC-PEG 12 kDa, and SC-PEG 20 kDa present in a 4.2-fold molar excess relative to IFN-α2b (5 mg/ml). For the reactions involving SC-PEG 30 kDa, the linker-to-protein molar ratio was limited by linker solubility to 2:1. After 70 min, reactions were quenched with 1 m glycine to minimize the formation of multipegylated species. Reactions at pH 10 were performed in 30 mm sodium tetraborate at 22 °C. Due to the increased rate of reaction at this pH, the molar ratio of linker to protein was reduced to 1.0 for SC-PEG 5 kDa, SC-PEG 12 kDa, and SC-PEG 20 kDa. To adjust for the reduced reactivity of higher Mr PEG polymers, the ratio was increased to 1.5 for SC-PEG 30 kDa. Reactions were again quenched with 1 m glycine. Quenched reaction products were dialyzed against 100 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 5.0, at 5 °C. Mono-PEG-IFN-α2b was purified from dialysates by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 HiLoad column (26 mm × 60 cm, 34 ± 10-μm particle size; Amersham Biosciences). All pools contained at least 98% mono-PEG-IFN-α2b as assessed by high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC; Superdex 200 HR, 10 mm × 30 cm, 13-μm particle size; Amersham Biosciences). The primary contaminant was di-PEG-IFN-α. Single PEG-IFN-α2b positional isomers were isolated from the mono-PEG-IFN-α2b pools by high performance ion exchange chromatography (HPIEX) on a preparative scale sulfopropyl (SP) column (21.5 mm × 15.0 cm, 13-μm particle size; TosoHaas, Philadelphia, PA) using a Waters HPLC system (717+ Autosampler with a 2.5-ml syringe, 486 detector, two 510 HPLC pumps with high pressure gradient mixing, 6 ml/min flow rate) with monitoring by UV light at 280 nm. This procedure, previously utilized to resolve positional isomers of 12-kDa PEG-IFN-α2b (15Wylie D.C. Voloch M. Lee S. Liu Y.H. Cannon-Carlson S. Cutler C. Pramanik B. Pharm. Res. 2001; 18: 1354-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), was optimized to improve the resolution of positional isomers with varying PEG molecular weights. The purified mono-PEG-IFN-α2b size exclusion pools were dialyzed overnight at 5 °C against HPIEX buffer A (1.8 mm citric acid monohydrate, 3.3 mm sodium phosphate dibasic heptahydrate, pH 5.3). The dialysates were concentrated to 2.2 A280 prior to loading onto the SP column, preequilibrated with buffer A. Loading was adjusted over a range of 19–65 μg of protein/ml of resin. Bound positional isomers were eluted using pH gradients formed by buffer B (30 mm trisodium citrate dihydrate, 70 mm sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate, pH 6.0). To optimize resolution of positional isomers, the pH gradient was adjusted according to both attached PEG length and site of pegylation. As can be seen in Fig. 1A, the His34 and Cys1 positional isomers are well resolved from other positional isomers generated at a reaction pH of 6.5 when eluted with a gradient of 0–10% B in 100 min, followed by 10–30% B over 80 min. The separation of lysine-modified 12-kDa PEG-IFN-α2b positional isomers also involved two sequential linear gradients; from 0 to 14% buffer B in 180 min followed by 14–20% buffer B in 40 min. Due to weaker binding to the SP column, shallower gradients (0–12% buffer B in 180 min followed by 12–15% buffer B in 40 min) were employed to elute higher Mr PEG-IFN-α2b lysine-modified positional isomers (Fig. 1B). Peak fractions were manually collected in order to generate pools consisting of single positional isomers. The purity and identity of the positional isomers were assessed by HPSEC, analytical HPIEX (SP-5PW, 7.5 mm × 7.5 cm, 10-μm particle size; TosoHaas), and peptide mapping followed by amino acid sequencing. There was no free IFN-α in any of the purified positional isomer pools detectable by HPSEC. Stability of Positional Isomer Pools—Evaluation of the pools by HPSEC following five freeze/thaw cycles to simulate handling conditions demonstrated that the positional isomers were stable and the pools remained free of IFN-α contamination. Peptide Mapping—Characterization of purified positional isomer peaks was carried out as described previously (15Wylie D.C. Voloch M. Lee S. Liu Y.H. Cannon-Carlson S. Cutler C. Pramanik B. Pharm. Res. 2001; 18: 1354-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Peak fractions were concentrated to 0.5–1 mg/ml using a centrifugal spin filter (Ultrafree 15 ml, BioMaxx 50; Millipore Corp.). After adding a 10% (v/v) aliquot of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, the concentrate was digested with trypsin (1:10 mol/mol) overnight at 37 °C. Dithiothreitol (100 mm) was added to a final concentration of 5 mm, and incubation was carried out for 1 h at ambient temperature. The reduced digest was resolved by HPSEC with manual collection of pegylated peptides. The entire pegylated peptide peak was pooled and characterized by N-terminal sequence analysis. All peptide sequencing was performed by Commonwealth Biotechnologies (Richmond, VA) using Agilent hardware. Production and Isolation of Branched 20-kDa PEG-IFN-α2b and di-20-kDa PEG-IFN-α2b for Estimation of Stokes Radius—Two additional preparations of pegylated IFN-α2b were made solely for the study of the effect of pegylation on Stokes radius. Branched 20-kDa PEG-IFN-α2b was produced by using PEG2-N-hydroxysuccinimide 20 kDa at a 2:1 molar ratio. Pegylation was performed at pH 8.8 at 22 °C in 40 mm sodium tetraborate with quenching at 60 min using 1 m glycine. The reaction mixture was isolated and purified as described for the positional isomers used for activity measurements. Di-20-kDa PEG-IFN-α2b was produced as a secondary product from the SC-PEG reactions at pH 10. The mixture was purified from the pegylation reaction by collecting the unbound fraction obtained from anion exchange chromatography on Q HyperD (BioSepra). The reaction products were dialyzed against 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.2. The dialyzed product was applied at 1.4 mg of protein/ml of resin to a 20-cm column with a flow of 1.66 cm/min. Dipegylated IFN-α was collected from the unbound fraction. This fraction was further purified by size exclusion chromatography on Superdex 200 HiLoad under conditions identical to those used for the purification of monopegylated interferon α. The purity of dipegylated IFN-α purified by these columns was >99% by size exclusion HPLC. STAT1 Translocation Assay—Human hepatoma (Huh-7) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm GlutaMax-1, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and nonessential amino acids. Cells (10,000 cells/well) were seeded overnight in 96-well Packard black view plates (Packard Instrument Co.). 3-Fold serial dilutions of the test IFN-αs were prepared in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated with cells at 37 °C in 5–6% CO2 for 30 min. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100. The cells were then incubated with either a polyclonal anti-STAT1 p84/p91 (clone E-23; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or a polyclonal anti-STAT2 (clone C-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were sequentially washed with phosphate-buffered saline and 0.01% Tween 20. They were then incubated for 1 h with a mixture of Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes). The cells were again washed with 0.01% Tween 20 and phosphate-buffered saline. The plates were imaged on the ArrayScan® II High Content Screening System (Cellomics, Pittsburgh, PA) with a ×10 objective using the ArrayScan version 2.1 software (Cellomics). The resulting images were processed using the Cytoplasm to Nucleus Translocation Application software (Cellomics). The cytonuclear difference, defined as the difference in fluorescence intensity of the target STAT in the nuclear region minus the cytoplasmic region, was used as a measure of STAT translocation. Cytoplasmic and nuclear STAT1 levels were also examined for each cytonuclear difference determination. We confirmed that the cytonuclear difference was primarily caused by an increase in nuclear STAT1, whereas cytoplasmic STAT1 levels remained constant or only decreased slightly. This observation was consistent with data reported for TNF-α-mediated NF-κB cytonuclear translocation measurement using this instrumentation and software (16Ding G.J. Fischer P.A. Boltz R.C.

Antiviral and Antiproliferation Assays—The antiviral assay was performed by titrating serial 2-fold dilutions in 96-well microtiter assay plates seeded with either human foreskin fibroblast cells (FS-71) or non-small cell lung carcinoma cells (A549) infected with encephalomyocarditis virus as described previously (17Forti R.L. Schuffman S.S. Davies H.A. Mitchell W.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 119: 533-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The relative potency of IFN-α2b and all of the PEG-IFN-αs tested was determined by comparing the dose of the test preparation, which affords 50% protection to infected cells, with the dose of control IFN-α2b reference standard. The IFN-α2b standard was calibrated against the NIBSC IFN-α2b (95/566) standard. The materials for the PEG-IFN-αs were dose-ranged in preliminary experiments to assure that potency would be determined across a suitable response range. Specific activities for 12-kDa PEG-IFN-α2b and 40-kDa PEG-IFN-α2a were calculated from the empirically determined titer at 50% protection divided by the calculated IFN-α2b protein weight at the 50% point. The antiproliferation assay was performed by titrating serial 2-fold dilutions in 96-well microtiter assay plates seeded with Daudi cells. Daudi cells (ATCC), a human lymphoblastoid cell line, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After a 72-h incubation, cells were treated with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide/SDS and analyzed spectrophotometrically for cellular mitochondrial activity associated with viability. The relative potencies of IFN-α2b and all of the PEG-IFN-αs tested were determined by comparing the dose of the test preparation, which induced a 50% decrease in formazon-determined proliferation, with the dose of control IFN-α2b reference standard. The IFN-α2b standard was calibrated against the NIBSC IFN-α2b (95/566) standard. For the PEG-IFNαs, materials were dose-ranged in preliminary experiments to assure that potency would be determined across a suitable response range. Specific activities for 12-kDa PEG-IFN-α2b and 40-kDa PEG-IFN-α2a were calculated from the empirically determined titer at 50% proliferation divided by the calculated IFN-α2b protein weight at the 50% point. Statistical Analysis of STAT Translocation and Antiviral Data—The 50% inflection point for each of the dose-response curves of the STAT translocation responses and the antiviral responses were determined using iterative curve fitting software. SoftMaxPro version 4.3 (Molecular Devices) software was used for reducing the STAT translocation data. A proprietary version of AllFit, Allwin 2.03, was used for reducing the antiviral data. The descriptive statistics were generated using SAS JMP version 5.0.1 (SAS). An analysis of variance was carried out using Student's, Tukey-Kramer, Dunnett's, and Hsu MCB. All comparisons were first carried out against the respective PEG size isomer of His34. Additional comparisons were also conducted looking at the effect of PEG size change within each isomer. Other analyses for lysine comparisons in the antiviral assay were also performed. In selective cases where the variances were flagged as unequal, a Welch ANOVA test was also carried out to confirm results. Because the STAT translocation assay was more variable than the antiviral assay, the Student's t test was a more rugged comparator of variance. Determination of Stokes Radius of PEG-IFN-α2b—The apparent molecular masses and Stokes radii of 5-kDa, 12-kDa, and 20-kDa PEG-IFN-α2b, branched 20-kDa IFN-α2b (containing a PEG moiety with 2 × 10-kDa PEG branches for a total molecular mass of 20 kDa), and a di-PEG 20-kDa IFN-α2b (containing two linear 20-kDa PEG molecules attached to the protein at two different sites, for a total molecular mass of 40 kDa) were determined. The 5-kDa, 12-kDa, 20-kDa, branched 20-kDa, and di-PEG 20-kDa IFN-α2b were produced using SC-PEG chemistry and purified as preparations of mixed positional isomers. Apparent Mr values were obtained from a standard curve (log Mrversus retention time by HPSEC analysis) constructed using 10 different marker proteins. The Stokes radius (RS) for the PEG-IFN-α2bs were then calculated based on a standard curve of log RS versus log Mr also obtained using these markers. HPSEC analysis of the PEG-IFN-α2bs was performed using a Sigma Chrom™ GFC-1300 column (12–15-μm particle size; Sigma) in 0.1 m sodium phosphate and 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.0, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Confirmation of Differential Activity between 12-kDa Monopegylated IFN-α2b and 40-kDa Monopegylated IFN-α2a—Because the reported activity for 12-kDa monopegylated IFN-α2b and 40-kDa monopegylated IFN-α2a was generated from different laboratories using different antiviral assays, we first measured the differential activity directly. 12-kDa PEG-IFN-α2b was consistently more than 25-fold more active than 40-kDa PEG-IFN-α2a in an antiviral protection assay using either FS-71 or A549 cells (Table I). The activity of 12-kDa PEG-IFN-α2b ranged between 25 and 35% of that for IFN-α2b control, values comparable with those previously reported (9Grace M. Youngster S. Gitlin G. Sydor W. Xie L. Westreich L. Jacobs S. Brassard D. Bausch J. Bordens R. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2001; 21: 1103-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The activity of 40-kDa PEG-IFN-α2a was ∼1% of that for IFN-α2b. This value is lower than that from one previous report (10Bailon P. Palleroni A. Schaffer C.A. Spence C.L. Fung W.J. Porter J.E. Ehrlich G.K. Pan W. Xu Z.X. Modi M.W. Farid A. Berthold W. Graves M. Bioconjug. Chem. 2001; 12: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar), but consistent with those from another recent evaluation of the activity of PEG-IFN-α2a in the Madin-Darby bovine kidney antiviral assay (11Foser S. Schacher A. Weyer K.A. Brugger D. Dietel E. Marti S. Schreitmuller T. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 30: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). IFN-α2a, the core interferon protein for 40-kDa PEG-IFN-α2a, was titrated in the FS-71 antiviral assay with IFN-α2b and was found to be equivalent in activity within the variation of the assay. Thus, the lower activity seen with the 40-kDa PEG-IFN-α2a versus 12-kDa PEG-IFN-α2b cannot be accounted for by differences in the core proteins in the assay. In addition, circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed no perturbation in the near or far UV for the core protein of 40-kDa PEG-IFN-α2a (data not shown).Table IComparative antiviral and antiproliferation activities for 12-kDa PEG-IFN-α2b and 40-kDa PEG-IFN-α2aMean titerS.D.Specific activityPercentage of IFN-α2b activityIU/mlIU/mlIU/mg%FS-71 antiviral protection assay12-kDa PEG-IFN-α2b1.65 × 1075.05 × 1066.61 × 10725.440-kDa PEG-IFN-α2a5.90 × 1051.24 × 1053.15 × 1061.2A549 antiviral protection assay12-kDa PEG-IFN-α2b1.37 × 1071.44 × 1069.00 × 10734.640-kDa PEG-IFN-α2a5.85 × 1051.08 × 1053.13 × 1061.2Daudi antiproliferation assay12-kDa PEG-IFN-α2b1.13 × 1071.35 × 1067.52 × 10728.940-kDa PEG-IFN-α2a3.34 × 1056.01 × 1041.78 × 1060.7 Open table in a new tab Results obtained in a Daudi cell antiproliferation assay were similar to those for the antiviral assay (Table I). The specific activity of 12-kDa PEG-IFN-α2b was 28.9% of that for IFN-α2b as compared with a value of 0.7% obtained for 40-kDa PEG-IFN-α2a. Effect of PEG Molecule Size on PEG-IFN-α2b Stokes Radius and Apparent Molecular Weight—Because of the hydrophilic nature of PEG polymers, increased polymer length can significantly increase the relative Stokes radius of a pegylated protein (18Knauf M.J. Bell D.P. Hirtzer P. Luo Z.P. Young J.D. Katre N.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15064-15070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, due to the linear nature of the PEG moiety, the increase in the apparent molecular weight of a globular protein such as IFN-α2b is much greater than the sum of the molecular weights of the protein and the attached PEG group. Using SC-PEG chemistry, we purified mixed positional isomer preparations of 5-kDa, 12-kDa, linear 20-kDa, branched 20-kDa, and di-20-kDa PEG-IFN-α2b and measured the apparent molecular weight (aMr) and RS using HPSEC analysis. The addition of a 5-kDa PEG group to IFN-α2b increased the aMr to 73,300, a value of more than 3 times the additive molecular mass of the 23.1-kDa protein and the 5-kDa PEG group and the RS was increased by 58% (Table II). With the addition of the 12-kDa PEG, the RS increased by 119% relative to IFN-α2b, and the aMr increased to 165,600. The branched and linear 20-kDa PEGs increased RS by 166 and 184% relative to IFN-α2b, and aMr increased to 272,300 and 320,600, respectively. For the di-20-kDa PEG (with a t"
https://openalex.org/W1988491749,"It has been proposed that defective submucosal gland function in CF airways is a major determinant of CF airway disease. We tested the hypothesis that submucosal gland function is defective early in CF subjects with minimal clinical disease. Functional assays of gland fluid secretion rate and viscosity were performed on freshly obtained nasal biopsies from 6 CF subjects and 5 non-CF controls (age range 2-22 years). Secretions from individual submucosal glands were visualized by light/fluorescence microscopy after orienting and immobilizing biopsy specimens in a custom chamber. The viscosity of freshly secreted gland fluid after pilocarpine, measured by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching of microinjected FITC-dextran, was 4.9 +/- 0.2- vs. 2.2 +/- 0.2-fold greater than water viscosity in CF vs. non-CF specimens, respectively (SE, P<10(-4)). Gland fluid secretion rate in CF specimens, measured by video imaging (4.5+/-0.5 nL/min/gland, n=6), was 2.7-fold reduced compared to non-CF specimens (n=3, P<0.05). Quantitative histology revealed similar size and morphology of submucosal glands in CF and non-CF specimens. Our results suggest that defective airway submucosal gland function is an early, primary defect in CF. Therapies directed at normalizing gland fluid secretion early in CF may thus reduce lung disease."
https://openalex.org/W2019166384,"Agkistrodon contortrix laticinctus myotoxin is a Lys49-phospholipase A2 (EC 3.1.1.4) isolated from the venom of the serpent A. contortrix laticinctus (broad-banded copperhead). We present here three monomeric crystal structures of the myotoxin, obtained under different crystallization conditions. The three forms present notable structural differences and reveal that the presence of a ligand in the active site (naturally presumed to be a fatty acid) induces the exposure of a hydrophobic surface (the hydrophobic knuckle) toward the C terminus. The knuckle in A. contortrix laticinctus myotoxin involves the side chains of Phe121 and Phe124 and is a consequence of the formation of a canonical structure for the main chain within the region of residues 118–125. Comparison with other Lys49-phospholipase A2 myotoxins shows that although the knuckle is a generic structural motif common to all members of the family, it is not readily recognizable by simple sequence analyses. An activation mechanism is proposed that relates fatty acid retention at the active site to conformational changes within the C-terminal region, a part of the molecule that has long been associated with Ca2+-independent membrane damaging activity and myotoxicity. This provides, for the first time, a direct structural connection between the phospholipase “active site” and the C-terminal “myotoxic site,” justifying the otherwise enigmatic conservation of the residues of the former in supposedly catalytically inactive molecules.

EC 3.1.1.4) constitute a large family of enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of the sn-2 ester bond of phospholipids, producing free fatty acids and lysophospholipids (1Davidson F.F. Dennis E.A. J.

The enzymatic activity of PLA2s plays an important role in many biological processes, and the fatty acids released by PLA2 can function as energy stores, second messengers (5Gijon M.A. Leslie C.C. J.

The lysophospholipids on the other hand are involved in cell signaling and phospholipid remodeling and are associated with membrane perturbation (9Moolenaar W.H. Kranenburg O. Postma F.R. Zondag G.C.

Some members of the PLA2 superfamily also present a wide variety of pharmacological effects, such as pre- and post-synaptic neurotoxicity (11Chang C.C. Lee C.Y. Eaker D. Fohlman J.

According to their common source, size, pathological effects, amino acid sequence similarity, structural homology, disulfide bridge pattern, and other criteria, the PLA2 superfamily has been classified into 11 groups and 23 subgroups (23Six D.A. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar). Groups I and II comprise secreted phospholipases A2 (of about 14 kDa) typically found in mammalian secretory fluids and snake venoms (24van den Bosch H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 604: 191-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar, 25Gutiérrez J.M. Cerdas L. Rev. Biol. Trop. 1984; 32: 213-222PubMed Google Scholar). They show a high degree of sequence and structural similarity and are believed to have a common calcium-dependent catalytic mechanism. The hydrolytic activity displayed by these groups of enzymes requires the presence of His48 and Asp99 residues (following the numbering system of Renetseder et al. (26Renetseder R. Brunie S. Dijkistra B.W. Drenth J. Sigler P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11627-11634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), the former coordinating a conserved water molecule that acts as a nucleophile during hydrolysis. An aspartic acid at position 49, also described to be essential for the catalytic activity, binds the Ca2+ cofactor and aids in the stabilization of the tetrahedral intermediate during catalysis (27Verheij H.M. Volwerk J.J. Jasen E.H.J.M. Puyk W.C. Dijkistra B.W. Drenth J. Haas G.H. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 743-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 28Scott D.L. White S.P. Otwinowski Z. Yuan W. Gelb M.H. Sigler P.B. Science. 1990; 250: 1541-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). A subfamily of group II PLA2s, where Asp49 is replaced by a lysine residue (known as Lys49-PLA2), has been described (29Selistre-de-Araujo H.S. White S.P. Ownby C.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 326: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 30Maraganore J.M. Merutka G. Cho W. Werlches W. Kezdy F.J. Heinrickson R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13839-13843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initially Lys49-PLA2s were believed to be catalytically inactive because of flipping of the Cys29–Gly30 peptide bond and their stereochemical incapacity to bind the cofactor calcium ion and thus stabilize the tetrahedral intermediate observed in the calcium-dependent catalytic reaction promoted by Asp49-PLA2s (31van den Bergh L.L.M. Slotboom A.J. Verheij H.M. de Haas G.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1989; 39: 379-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was supported by structural analyses that have shown that the ϵ-amino group of Lys49 is located in the position occupied by Ca2+ in Asp49-PLA2 (32Holland D.R. Clancy L.L. Muchmore S.W. Ryde T.J. Einspahr H.M. Finzel B.C. Heinrickson R.L. Watenpaugh K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17649-17656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Scott D.L. Achari A. Vidal J.C.

Crystallogr. 1995; 51: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, in vitro assays have provided evidence of a limited catalytic activity for Lys49-PLA2 (35Shimohigashi Y. Tani A. Matsumoto H. Nakashima K. Yamaguchi Y. Oda N. Takano Y. Kamiya H. Kishino J. Arita H. Ohno M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 1037-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 36Yamaguchi Y. Shimohigashi Y. Chiwata T. Tani A. Chijiwa T. Lomonte B. Ohno M. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1997; 43: 19-26PubMed Google Scholar). These studies have often been criticized on the basis that they were performed by using toxins extracted directly from the snake venom, where the presence of trace amounts of contaminating Asp49-PLA2 would be sufficient to yield the low levels of activity observed. Recently, the use of refolded recombinant enzyme, where this risk has been eliminated (37Ward R.J. Chioato L. Oliveira A.H.C. Ruller R. Sá J.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), appears to confirm the original hypothesis that Lys49-PLA2s are indeed catalytically inactive. Nevertheless, a global consensus on this point has yet to be reached as emphasized by recent review articles (38Bruno Lomonte B. Angulo Y. Calderón L. Toxicon. 2003; 42: 885-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 39Murakami M.T. Arni R.K. Toxicon. 2003; 42: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Despite having little or no enzymatic activity, Lys49-PLA2s are very active in induction of myonecrosis (16Johnson E.K. Ownby C.L. Toxicon. 1993; 31: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 40Homsi-Brandeburgo M.I. Queiroz L.S. Neto H.S. Simioni L.R. Giglio J.R.

Biophys. 1991; 284: 352-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). If these molecules are genuinely catalytically inactive, this raises the intriguing question of why their “active” sites are so well conserved. “SequenceSpace” analysis (42Ward R.J. Alves A.R.

In addition, crystallographic structures in complex with naturally bound fatty acid molecules (interpreted as the product of catalysis) have been described (46da Silva Giotto M.T. Garratt R.C. Oliva G. Mascarenhas Y.P. Giglio J.R. Cintra A.C. de Azevedo Jr., W.F. Arni R.K. Ward R.J. Proteins. 1998; 30: 442-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 47Lee W.-H. da Silva Giotto M.T. Marangoni S. Toyama M.H. Polikarpov I. Garratt R.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Based on these results, Lee and co-workers (47Lee W.-H. da Silva Giotto M.T. Marangoni S. Toyama M.H. Polikarpov I. Garratt R.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) have suggested that the apparent low level or lack of catalytic activity for Lys49-PLA2 observed in vitro could be the result of the failure of product release from the active site after one cycle of catalysis, leading to enzyme inhibition. Despite the abundance of crystallographic data on the Lys49-PLA2s, the mechanism of action that leads to their pharmacological effects has still to be fully elucidated. This is due at least in part to the fact that it has proved difficult to capture the same myotoxin in different conformational states. Inferences such as those made by Lee et al. (47Lee W.-H. da Silva Giotto M.T. Marangoni S. Toyama M.H. Polikarpov I. Garratt R.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) have had to be made on the basis of comparisons between different Lys49-PLA2s crystallized under different conditions, some in the presence of a bound active-site ligand and others not. There is, however, a growing consensus that both the myotoxic and calcium-independent membrane damaging activities (48Diaz C. Gutiérrez J.M. Lomonte B. Gene J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1070: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 49Rufini S. Cesaroni P. Desideri A. Farias R. Gubensek F. Gutiérrez J.M. Luly P. Massoud R. Morero R. Pedersen J.Z.

Chioato L. Oliveira A.H.C. Ruller R. Sá J.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 38Bruno Lomonte B. Angulo Y. Calderón L.

One of the principal mechanistic mysteries surrounding Lys-PLA2 is the way in which ligand binding or catalysis at the active site is coupled to, or independent from, events involving this C-terminal region. In the present work we address this question directly via a description of the crystal structure of ACL myotoxin, a Lys49-PLA2 isolated from Agkistrodon contortrix laticinctus (broad-banded copperhead) venom. For the first time, three different crystal forms are observed for a Lys49-PLA2 originating from the same sample. Most interestingly, one of the crystal forms reveals the presence of a non-protein electron density within the hydrophobic substrate-binding channel, whereas the other two do not. This has allowed for a direct comparison between three different conformations of the same molecule. These have been used, together with our current knowledge of other PLA2 structures, to propose a coupling mechanism that relates changes in the conformation of the Ca2+ binding loop, mediated by fatty acid binding, to the exposure of a significant additional hydrophobic surface close to the C terminus. This may aid in explaining the conundrum of the conservation of the PLA2 active site in apparently catalytically inactive molecules. ACL myotoxin from the venom of A. contortrix laticinctus was isolated and purified as reported previously (16Johnson E.K. Ownby C.L. Toxicon. 1993; 31: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The protein, obtained from the same purification batch, was crystallized under three different conditions using the conventional hanging drop vapor diffusion techniques. The structures derived from different crystallization conditions present conformational differences, and here they have been named forms I, II, and III respectively. All crystallization experiments were performed at 291 K with drops containing equal volumes (5 μl) of reservoir and protein solution. The latter was dissolved in water at a concentration that varied between 10 and 16 mg/ml prior to crystallization. X-ray diffraction measurements were performed at 100 K using crystals previously soaked in cryoprotectant solution (see Table I). Data for the first two crystal forms were collected at the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory, LNLS (53Polikarpov I. Perles L.A. de Oliveira R.T. Oliva G. Castellano E.E. Garratt R.C. Craievich A. J. Synchrotran Rad. 1998; 5: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), using λ = 1.544 Å, on a MAR345 image plate. For the third crystal form, a data set was obtained by using CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) from a Rigaku UltraX 18 rotating-anode home source, equipped with Osmic focusing mirrors and measured on a Mar345dtb image plate detector. Data from forms I and II were processed using MOSFLM (54Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 + ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. Daresbury Laboratory, Daresbury, UK1992Google Scholar) and scaled with SCALA (55Evans P.R. Proceedings of CCP4 Study Weekend, on Data Collection & Processing, January 9 –10, Daresbury, UK. Daresbury Laboratory, Daresbury, UK1993: 114-122Google Scholar). For the third form, data were processed using the HKL 1.96 package (56Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38570) Google Scholar) but retaining the Bijvoet's pairs independently. In all cases the crystals belong to the space group P41212 with slightly different cell parameters.Table IData collection parameters and structures refinement statisticsForm IForm IIForm IIIData collectionCryoprotectant solutionMother liquor + 20% (v/v) glycerolMother liquor + 20% (v/v) glycerolMother liquor + 15% (v/v) ethylene glycolSpace groupP41212P41212P41212Cell parameters (Å)a = b = 81.89a = b = 70.50a = b = 70.57c = 49.9c = 57.14c = 57.45Mosaicity (°)0.600.500.45Resolution range (Å)57.3-2.350.0-1.826.5-1.61(2.36-2.3)(1.85-1.8)(1.65-1.61)Total reflections101,833118,620526,515Unique reflections796013,87235,959Redundancy6.2 (6.2)3.9 (3.7)14.6 (14.1)aAnomalous redundancyRsymm (%)11.8 (38.2)5.9 (36.1)6.1 (31.4)Completeness (%)98.1 (99.7)97.5 (99.6)99.8 (99.8)bCompletenessI/σ(I)3.5 (1.7)8.3 (2.0)49.5 (8.1)Molecules/AU111Solvent content (%)58.649.149.1Matthews volume (A3/Da)3.02.52.5Refinement (r.m.s.d.cr.m.s.d., root mean square deviation from standard geometries)Bond length (Å)0.0050.0070.009Bond angles (°)0.9291.0981.295Ramachandran plotMost favored (%)89.993.695.4Allowed (%)10.16.44.6a Anomalous redundancyb Completenessc r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation Open table in a new tab Forms I and II—The first set of phases for both form I and II crystals were obtained by molecular replacement techniques implemented in the program MOLREP (57Vagin A.

For form I, a monomer of the Lys49-PLA2 from A. piscivorus piscivorus was used as the search model (PDB code 1PPA (32Holland D.R. Clancy L.L. Muchmore S.W. Ryde T.J. Einspahr H.M. Finzel B.C. Heinrickson R.L. Watenpaugh K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17649-17656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). For form II, a partially refined structure from form I was used as the search model. In both cases, rigid body and simulated annealing refinement were performed using CNS (58Bru ̈nger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson Y. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar), followed by subsequent cycles of positional and B factor refinement carried out with REFMAC 5.0 (59Murshudov G.N. Vagin A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13869) Google Scholar). The electron density maps were examined in O (60Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar) with atomic positions being adjusted manually when necessary. Solvent water molecules, treated as oxygen atoms, were added using the automated refinement procedure routine (61Lamzin V. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1993; 49: 129-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During the refinement of form I, the analysis of Fourier difference maps indicated the presence of a very strong electron density (over 3σ) inside the hydrophobic channel that leads to the active site. This was initially modeled as a single molecule of lauric acid (C12H24O2) that was incorporated into the model prior to the final stages of refinement. As an alternative, the possibility of modeling the additional electron density as a low molecular weight polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecule was also explored. Form III—The high quality data collected for the third crystal form were used for trials in a single anomalous dispersion using sulfur as the anomalous scatterer phasing procedure. The positions of the 18 sulfur sites were determined using SHELXD (62Sheldrick G.M. Hauptman H.A. Weeks C.M. Miller M. Usón I. Arnold E. Rossmann M. International Tables for Crystallography. F. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, Netherlands2001: 333-351Google Scholar). Besides the 16 sites expected for the 14 half-cystines and 2 methionine residues of the ACL myotoxin, the two extra sites correspond to a second conformation of one of the methionine residues and a sulfate ion that was derived from the crystallization solution. SHARP (63de la Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276 (494): 472Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar) was used for refinement of the SHELXD sites and phase calculation, followed by density modification with SOLOMON (64Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). An initial model was obtained by ARP/wARP (65Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2564) Google Scholar), followed by iterative model building (for 108 of the 121 residues) and side chain docking. Successive rounds of rebuilding and interspersed with torsion angle simulated annealing using CNS, and positional and individual B factor refinements with REFMAC 5.0 were carried out to generate the final model. The overall stereochemical quality of the final models for ACL myotoxin was assessed by the program PROCHECK (66Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), and the agreements between model and experimental data were checked with SF-CHECK (67Vaguine A.A. Richelle J. Wodak S.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 191-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Atomic coordinates for the three forms have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (68Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27540) Google Scholar) under codes 1S8G (form I), 1S8H (form II), and 1S8I (form III). Crystallization, Data Processing, and Structure Refinement—Crystals of form I were obtained using 30% w/v PEG 8000, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, and a protein solution at 10 mg/ml. Form II crystals grow in the presence of 2.0 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and a protein solution at a concentration of 16 mg/ml. These crystals are isomorphous with those described previously by Treharne et al. (69Treharne A.C. White S.P. Ownby C.L. Selistre-de-Araújo H.S. Foundling S.I. Toxicon. 1997; 35: 613-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Form III crystals were obtained by using essentially identical conditions to those described for form II but with a reduced protein concentration (2.0 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and protein solution at 10 mg/ml). All three crystal forms belong to the space group P41212, and the difference between form II and form III is essentially structural, becoming evident only after refinement. Crystals of the myotoxin diffracted to 2.3, 1.8, and 1.6 Å, respectively, for forms I, II, and III. In the case of form I, the refinement converged to final residuals of Rfactor = 20.5% and Rfree = 24.7%, based on a model that consists of 121 residues for the polypeptide chain, 78 sites treated as water oxygens, a lauric acid molecule, and a sulfate ion. As with the structures reported previously for the myotoxins from Bothrops nummifer and Bothrops pirajai, which also presented additional density within the hydrophobic channel, the ACL myotoxin was crystallized in the presence of polyethylene glycol (PEG). It therefore seemed prudent to consider the possibility that the ligand density might correspond to a low molecular weight PEG. Attempts to refine the structure with a diethylene glycol unit occupying this site led to essentially identical results to those obtained with lauric acid, both in terms of the B factors for the ligand and its local environment and the final R values. The refinement of crystal form II converged to Rfactor and Rfree values of 19.1 and 22.9%, respectively. In this case the model consists of the same 121 amino acid residues for the polypeptide chain together with 139 solvent sites treated as water oxygens and a sulfate ion. In the case of form III, the final residuals were Rfactor = 18.6% and Rfree = 20.5%. Once again, the final model contained all of the expected atoms for the 121 residues of the polypeptide chain, besides 156 water molecules treated as oxygen atoms and a sulfate ion. Data collection, refinement, and quality statistics for the final models are summarized in Table I. Overall Structures—The three different crystal structures for ACL myotoxin include all of the atoms foreseen by the amino acid sequence (29Selistre-de-Araujo H.S. White S.P. Ownby C.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 326: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and present the canonical fold for a class II PLA2, consisting of an N-terminal α-helix (called α1), the calcium binding loop, two long anti-parallel α-helices (α2 and α3, respectively), the β-wing, and the C-terminal loop (see Fig. 1a). Furthermore, the seven disulfide bridges expected for class II PLA2 myotoxins are all present. As has been previously observed for Lys49-PLA2s, the positions of the amino acid residues His48, Tyr52, Tyr73, and Asp99, and their interactions are also conserved (43de Azevedo Juniorperiod W.F. Ward R.J. Lombardi F.R. Giglio J.R. Soares A. Fontes M.R.M. Arni R.K. Protein Pept. Lett. 1997; 4: 329-334Google Scholar). These residues are essential to the formation of the catalytic site of active phospholipases. It has been described for other Lys49-PLA2 myotoxins that residues located in the N-terminal α-helix and in the short anti-parallel β-wing play a role in protein dimerization (47Lee W.-H. da Silva Giotto M.T.

https://openalex.org/W2008232775,"Penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) are membrane-associated enzymes which perform critical functions in the bacterial cell division process. The single d-Ala,d-Ala (d,d)-carboxypeptidase in Streptococcus pneumoniae, PBP3, has been shown to play a key role in control of availability of the peptidoglycal substrate during cell growth. Here, we have biochemically characterized and solved the crystal structure of a soluble form of PBP3 to 2.8 Å resolution. PBP3 folds into an NH2-terminal, d,d-carboxypeptidase-like domain, and a COOH-terminal, elongated β-rich region. The carboxypeptidase domain harbors the classic signature of the penicilloyl serine transferase superfamily, in that it contains a central, five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet surrounded by α-helices. As in other carboxypeptidases, which are present in species whose peptidoglycan stem peptide has a lysine residue at the third position, PBP3 has a 14-residue insertion at the level of its omega loop, a feature that distinguishes it from carboxypeptidases from bacteria whose peptidoglycan harbors a diaminopimelate moiety at this position. PBP3 performs substrate acylation in a highly efficient manner (kcat/Km = 50,500 m–1·s–1), an event that may be linked to role in control of pneumococcal peptidoglycan reticulation. A model that places PBP3 poised vertically on the bacterial membrane suggests that its COOH-terminal region could act as a pedestal, placing the active site in proximity to the peptidoglycan and allowing the protein to “skid” on the surface of the membrane, trimming pentapeptides during the cell growth and division processes.

Bacterial division is a complex phenomenon that requires the coordination of diverse processes including chromosomal segregation, FtsZ ring-dependent membrane constriction, and cell wall synthesis at the site of septation. The latter process involves the polymerization of glycan chains and transpeptidation of pentapeptidic moieties within the structure of the peptidoglycan, a highly cross-linked mesh that is crucial for maintaining bacterial shape and providing protection from osmotic shock and lysis (1Nanninga N. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 110-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both reactions are catalyzed by penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), 1The abbreviations used are: PBP, penicillin-binding protein; hmm, high molecular mass; lmm, low molecular mass; d,d, d-Ala,d-Ala; Ac2-KAA, N,N-diacetyl-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala; SeMet, selenomethionine; r.m.s., root mean square. membrane-associated molecules, which can be classified as high molecular mass (hmm; often bifunctional) and low molecular mass (lmm; monofunctional) and play key roles in the bacterial life cycle. The pathogenic bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae offers a unique opportunity for the study of the relationship between cell division and cell wall synthesis, since it carries a relatively simple set of six PBPs, compared with other well studied organisms which present much higher complexity (2Williamson R. Hakenbeck R. Tomasz A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1980; 18: 629-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In this organism, PBP1a, -1b, and -2a catalyze both glycosyltransfer and transpeptidation; PBP2b and -2x only catalyze the latter reaction, and PBP3, the single lmm PBP in S. pneumoniae, has been shown to act as a d-Ala,d-Ala (d,d) carboxypeptidase (3Hakenbeck R. Kohiyama M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 127: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The central role of hmm PBPs in the cell growth and division processes has been recently confirmed through the study of their localization within the cell cycle through the employment of immunofluorescence techniques (4Morlot C. Zapun A. Dideberg O. Vernet T. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 845-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In S. pneumoniae, the constriction of the FtsZ-ring is spatially coupled to PBP2x- and PBP1a-mediated septal peptidoglycan synthesis, with the former process preceding the latter by approximately 5 min (4Morlot C. Zapun A. Dideberg O. Vernet T. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 845-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). At the beginning of the cell cycle, PBP3 localizes throughout the whole bacterial surface but seems to be absent from the future division site (5Morlot C. Noirclerc-Savoye M. Zapun A. Dideberg O. Vernet T. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1641-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Since the d,d-carboxypeptidase activity of PBP3 removes the COOH-terminal d-alanine of the peptidoglycan pentapeptide side chains, its hemispheric localization implies that the cellular region neighboring the future division site will be the only one where full-length pentapeptides will be available as substrates for other PBPs. Interestingly, a mutant pneumococcal strain which lacks PBP3 displays abnormal morphology and exhibits multiple septa initiated at aberrant locations (6Schuster C. Dobrinski B. Hakenbeck R. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6499-6505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that the availability of intact pentapeptidic substrates dictates the localization of the hmm PBPs. Therefore, by guaranteeing that pentapeptides are available uniquely at the future division site, PBP3 may ensure the spatial coordination of the FtsZ-ring with the septum synthesis machinery. PBP3 is associated to the bacterial membrane through a COOH-terminal amphiphilic helix. In the d,d-carboxypeptidase reaction catalyzed by PBP3, an active serine residue reacts with the d-Ala-d-Ala COOH terminus of a peptide chain of the peptidoglycan to form a transient acyl-enzyme complex that is subsequently hydrolyzed. The reaction results in the formation of a tetrapeptide that can only serve as an acceptor for a subsequent transpeptidation reaction by other PBPs (3Hakenbeck R. Kohiyama M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 127: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As in the case of the d,d-transpeptidase activity, d,d-carboxypeptidation is inhibited by penicillin and other β-lactam antibiotics that mimic the structure of the d-Ala-d-Ala carboxyl terminus of the pentapeptide chain (7Tipper D.J. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). These antibiotics react with PBPs to form a stable acyl-enzyme complex, resulting in prolonged inhibition of the enzymes. Recently, the structure of PBP5, the soluble, signal peptide-lacking form of the d,d-carboxypeptidase from Escherichia coli, was reported in wild type and mutant forms to high resolution (1.85 and 1.9 Å, respectively; Refs. 8Davies C. White S.W. Nicholas R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 616-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar and 9Nicholas R.A. Krings S. Tomberg J. Nicola G. Davis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52826-52833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Wild type PBP5 deacylates its acyl-enzyme complex at a very high rate, which is reminiscent of that of a class A β-lactamase (the latter with a poor substrate). Although these reports shed light on the enzymology of d,d-carboxypeptidation and the two-domain fold of the enzyme, several points still remain unclear, including the nature of the d,d-carboxypeptidase substrates and the enzymatic role of lmm PBPs in the cell division process. In light of our previous reports on the localization of PBP3 in the cell cycle (5Morlot C. Noirclerc-Savoye M. Zapun A. Dideberg O. Vernet T. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1641-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and in an effort to answer some of the questions above, we performed the enzymatic characterization of pneumococcal PBP3 and solved the structure of a soluble form of the enzyme at 2.8 Å resolution. Although the general folds of the pneumococcal and E. coli enzymes are similar, PBP3 harbors a significantly longer omega-like loop, a feature subsequently identified as a telltale motif in enzymes present in bacteria whose peptidoglycan structures contain an l-lysine group in the third stem peptide position. Interestingly, its carboxypeptidase domain is highly reminiscent of that of transpeptidase K15 from Streptomyces spp. but shares structural resemblance with other peptidoglycan biosynthetic enzymes only in the immediate vicinity of the active site. PBP3 is a highly efficient d,d-carboxypeptidase, hydrolyzing a synthetic peptide substrate 180 times more efficiently than E. coli PBP5; however, acyl-enzyme deacylation is 20-fold slower than for its E. coli counterpart, suggesting that PBP3 plays a particular role in control of peptidoglycan reticulation in the Gram-positive cell wall. Last, the positioning of the active site on the opposite face of the molecule from the COOH-terminal, membrane-interacting region may place it in optimal position to contact the peptidoglycan layer throughout the two cellular hemispheres. Measurement of Kinetic and Antibiotic Recognition Parameters—The construction of plasmid pGEX-sPBP3* encoding the soluble form of wild type PBP3, which lacks both the COOH-terminal helix and the signal peptide (sPBP3*), was described previously (5Morlot C. Noirclerc-Savoye M. Zapun A. Dideberg O. Vernet T. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1641-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). d,d-Carboxypeptidase activity was assayed with N,N-diacetyl-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala (Ac2-KAA). sPBP3* (10 nm) was incubated at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and Ac2-KAA at concentrations ranging from 37.5 to 24,000 μm. After various time intervals, the reaction was stopped by addition of penicillin G to 0.1 mm, and released d-Ala was measured by the method described by Johnson et al. (10Johnson K. Duez C. Frere J.M. Ghuysen J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 43: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The functional homogeneity of the protein sample was determined by titrating the active sites present in the preparation using [3H]benzylpenicillin (20 Ci/mmol, 1 mCi/ml; Amersham Biosciences) as a reporter. sPBP3* solutions at 2 and 5 μm were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl containing 0.01–20 μm [3H]benzylpenicillin. The samples were subsequently submitted to SDS-12% PAGE electrophoresis, and estimation of [3H]benzylpenicillin bound to proteins was monitored by two different procedures. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, destained, incubated with Amplify (Amersham Biosciences), dried, and either exposed to film for 16 h or cut around the protein bands. In the latter case, the gel slices were mixed with 5 ml of LSC mixture (Picofluor 15, Packard), and their radioactivity was measured using a liquid scintillation analyzer (Packard model 2100TR). To analyze the kinetics of the deacylation reaction, 2 μm purified sPBP3* was labeled with 1 μm [3H]benzylpenicillin at 37 °C during 15 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl. Excess of cold benzylpenicillin (15 mm) was then added, and the reaction was continued at 37 °C. Aliquots were regularly removed, submitted to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, and the amount of radioactivity was measured in the protein bands as mentioned above. The ability of sPBP3* to hydrolyze the pseudo substrate N-benzoyl-d-alanylmercaptoacetic acid (S2d), which is a thioester analog of the stem wall peptide, was explored to generate a comparison profile of hydrolysis rates for other, previously characterized pneumococcal PBPs. Hydrolysis of S2d was followed by monitoring the amount of thiol group released using the method described by Zhao et al. (11Zhao G. Yeh W.K. Carnahan R.H. Flokowitsch J. Meier T.I. Alborn Jr., W.E. Becker G.W. Jaskunas S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4901-4908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Crystallization and Structure Solution—Selenomethionine (SeMet)-substituted sPBP3* was expressed in E. coli B834. Cells were grown in LeMaster medium (12LeMaster D.M. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7263-7268Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) containing 40 mg·l–1 methionine that was progressively replaced by SeMet. Expression was induced at A600 ∼0.3 and the purification of the protein was carried out as described previously (5Morlot C. Noirclerc-Savoye M. Zapun A. Dideberg O. Vernet T. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1641-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), except that all of the buffers were supplemented with 10 mm dithiothreitol. Complete replacement of methionine residues by selenomethionine was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry. SeMet-labeled sPBP3* crystals were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion using 1.5 μl of protein solution (4 mg·ml–1), 1.5 μl of well solution (0.2 m K,Na-tartrate, 0.1 m trisodium citrate (pH 5.6), 1.7 m (NH4)2SO4, and 3% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 400) and 0.5 μl of 142 mm NaI per drop. Orthorhombic crystals grew at 20 or 15 °C within 1 week. The crystals belong to space group P212121 with cell dimensions a = 87.57 Å, b = 120.69 Å, and c = 176.92 Å and have four molecules in the asymmetric unit. Prior to data collection, crystals were cryoprotected by transfer into 20% (v/v) glycerol, 2% ethylene glycol, 0.2 m K,Na-tartrate, 0.1 m trisodium citrate (pH 5.6), and 1.9 m (NH4)2SO4. Multiwavelength anomalous diffraction data were collected at 100 K from a single SeMet crystal at peak, inflection, and remote wavelengths, on an ADSC Quantum 4R CCD detector at beamline ID14EH4 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France. 140 degrees of data collected for each wavelength were processed using MOSFLM (13Leslie A.G.M.

Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Using the peak anomalous data, the selenium sites were located with ShelX-d (15Sheldrick G.M. SHELXL97: Program for the Refinment of Crystal Structure. University of Göttingen, Göttingen, Germany1997Google Scholar) and refined with SHARP (16de La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). The resulting 44 sites were used for phasing with SHARP. Phase improvement with DM and SOLOMON to 2.8 Å produced a clearly interpretable electron density map, from which an initial model was built using ARPwARP (17Morris R.J. Perrakis A. Lamzin V.S. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 229-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The four molecules in the orthorhombic asymmetric unit were sufficiently different so that non-crystallographic symmetry averaging was not helpful. The model was improved by iterative rounds of manual fitting using O and QUANTA and refinement in CNS (18Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S.

Ghuysen J.M. Iwatsubo M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 57: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Enzymatic parameters for carboxypeptidation were estimated by measuring the initial velocities (ν) at various concentrations of Ac2-KAA. Inhibition of sPBP3* by its own substrate was observed above a ligand concentration of 15 mm, a phenomenon that has been previously reported for a the d,d-carboxypeptidase from Neisseria gonorrhoeae (22Stefanova M.E.

The values and standard error of kcat = 110 ± 10 s–1 and Km = 19 ± 3 mm 1·s–1 (thus, kcat/Km = 5689 m–1) were obtained by fitting the data points, from zero to peak activity, against the equation ν/[sPBP3*]T = kcat [Ac2-KAA]/(Km + [Ac2-KAA]); these estimates may be lower than the true kcat and Km due to the inhibition of the enzyme at high ligand concentrations. By comparison, the kcat/Km value measured with this substrate for E. coli PBP5 is 32 m–1·s–1 (9Nicholas R.A. Krings S. Tomberg J. Nicola G. Davis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52826-52833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The k3 deacylation rate calculated for sPBP3* is comparable with those reported for other S. pneumoniae PBPs (Table I) but is 20–30-fold lower than that of E. coli PBP5 (9Nicholas R.A. Krings S.

In addition, sPBP3* possesses an efficiency of hydrolysis of 50 500 ± 2500 m–1·s–1 for the pseudo substrate S2d.

The spatial relationship between the domains is reminiscent of that observed for its E. coli homolog, the PBP5 d,d-carboxypeptidase, with which PBP3 shares 27% sequence identity (Fig. 1). Domain I (cyan in Fig. 1, A and B) comprises residues 25–292 and bears the signature fold topology of the penicilloyl-serine transferase superfamily, thus harboring the active site of PBP3. Using the standard secondary structure classification of the class A and class C β-lactamases as well as PBP2x (27Lobkovsky E. Moews P.C. Liu H. Zhao H. Frère J.M. Knox J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Biol. 1996; 3: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), the first domain is principally constituted by a central five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (β3/β4/β5/β1/β2) and two main helices (α8/α11). In addition, this domain contains three two-stranded antiparallel β-sheets (β2a/β2d, β2b/β2c, and β2e/β2f) and three helices (α2a/α4/α5). The COOH-terminal domain II bears an elongated structure which comprises residues 293–393 and is formed by a sandwich between two anti-parallel β-sheets. Comparison of the four molecules, which exist in the asymmetric unit, reveals that the greatest differences at the Cα level map to loop regions within the COOH-terminal domain, where the electron density is of poor quality in certain regions. Notably, the large area of interaction between the surfaces of domains I and II (∼800 Å2, including six potential hydrogen bonds) guarantees stability for the full-length molecule, which is reflected by the slight variation (<1°) of the angle between domains I and II in all four molecules of the asymmetric unit. The sPBP3* Active Site—The sPBP3* active site is at the distal end from the COOH terminus of the molecule. As observed with the other carboxypeptidases and penicillin-metabolyzing enzymes, the active site is mainly defined by three conserved structural motifs: SXXK (Ser56-Ile57-Thr58-Lys59), which includes the nucleophilic Ser56 residue, positioned at the NH2-terminal end of helix α2; SXN (Ser119-Ala120-Asn121), which forms the turn between helices α4 and α5onthe left side of the cavity, and K(T/S)G (Lys239-Thr240-Gly241), which lines strand β3 (Fig. 2A). In addition, the backbone NH groups of the essential Ser56 and Thr242 residues occupy positions that are compatible with the oxyanion hole function required for catalysis. The NH2 terminus of helix α11 and the loop between α6 and β2d also contribute residues to the active site. These include Arg278, located at the right top angle of the cavity, Thr160, and the structural Gly161, present on the extended loop at the bottom of the cavity. The hydrogen bonding network within the active site is extensive (Fig. 2A) and is identical in all four molecules in the asymmetric unit. The ϵ-NH2 group of Lys59 plays a central role in this network, forming hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl group of Ser56 and Ser119, the side chain carbonyl group of Asn121 and the backbone carbonyl group from Thr160. Two water molecules are observed within the hydrogen bonding network, one of which (O-26) is conserved in the K15 transpeptidase (29Fonzé E. Vermeire M. Nguyen-Disteche M. Brasseur R. Charlier P. J.

Although the architecture of the active site of the three enzymes is similar (compare Fig. 2, A–C), some significant differences can be observed in the orientation of three important catalytic residues: the side chains of Ser110, Lys213, and Thr214 of PBP5 are oriented differently from the equivalent residues in sPBP3*, Ser119, Lys239, and Thr240, respectively. In particular, in PBP5, Ser110 and Lys213 point away from the active site, and consequently the classical hydrogen bonding network within the active site is not formed in this molecule.

https://openalex.org/W2027021803,"The purpose of this study was to develop a novel therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD). We recently reported that dextromethorphan (DM), an active ingredient in a variety of widely used anticough remedies, protected dopaminergic neurons in rat primary mesencephalic neuron-glia cultures against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated degeneration and provided potent protection for dopaminergic neurons in a MPTP mouse model. The underlying mechanism for the protective effect of DM was attributed to its anti-inflammatory activity through inhibition of microglia activation. In an effort to develop more potent compounds for the treatment of PD, we have screened a series of analogs of DM, and 3-hydroxymorphinan (3-HM) emerged as a promising candidate for this purpose. Our study using primary mesencephalic neuron-glia cultures showed that 3-HM provided more potent neuroprotection against LPS-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity than its parent compound. The higher potency of 3-HM was attributed to its neurotrophic effect in addition to the anti-inflammatory effect shared by both DM and 3-HM. First, we showed that 3-HM exerted potent neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects on dopaminergic neurons in rat primary mesencephalic neuron-glia cultures treated with LPS. The neurotrophic effect of 3-HM was glia-dependent since 3-HM failed to show any protective effect in the neuron-enriched cultures. We subsequently demonstrated that it was the astroglia, not the microglia, that contributed to the neurotrophic effect of 3-HM. This conclusion was based on the reconstitution studies, in which we added different percentages of microglia (10-20%) or astroglia (40-50%) back to the neuron-enriched cultures and found that 3-HM was neurotrophic after the addition of astroglia, but not microglia. Furthermore, 3-HM-treated astroglia-derived conditioned media exerted a significant neurotrophic effect on dopaminergic neurons. It appeared likely that 3-HM caused the release of neurotrophic factor(s) from astroglia, which in turn was responsible for the neurotrophic effect. Second, the anti-inflammatory mechanism was also important for the neuroprotective activity of 3-HM because the more microglia were added back to the neuron-enriched cultures, the more significant neuroprotective effect was observed. The anti-inflammatory mechanism of 3-HM was attributed to its inhibition of LPS-induced production of an array of pro-inflammatory and neurotoxic factors, including nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). In conclusion, this study showed that 3-HM exerted potent neuroprotection by acting on two different targets: a neurotrophic effect mediated by astroglia and an anti-inflammatory effect mediated by the inhibition of microglial activation. 3-HM thus possesses these two important features necessary for an effective neuroprotective agent. In view of the well-documented very low toxicity of DM and its analogs, this report may provide an important new direction for the development of therapeutic interventions for inflammation-related diseases such as PD."
https://openalex.org/W2076148288,"CLN3 is a transmembrane protein with a predominant localization in lysosomes in non-neuronal cells but is also found in endosomes and the synaptic region in neuronal cells. Mutations in the CLN3 gene result in juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis or Batten disease, which currently is the most common cause of childhood dementia. We have recently reported that the lysosomal targeting of CLN3 is facilitated by two targeting motifs: a dileucine-type motif in a cytoplasmic loop domain and an unusual motif in the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail comprising a methionine and a glycine separated by nine amino acids (Kyttälä, A., Ihrke, G., Vesa, J., Schell, M. J., and Luzio, J. P. (2004) Mol. Biol. Cell 15, 1313–1323). In the present study, we investigated the pathways and mechanisms of CLN3 sorting using biochemical binding assays and immunofluorescence methods. The dileucine motif of CLN3 bound both AP-1 and AP-3 in vitro, and expression of mutated CLN3 in AP-1- or AP-3-deficient mouse fibroblasts showed that both adaptor complexes are required for sequential sorting of CLN3 via this motif.

Mutations in the CLN3 gene cause an accumulation of autofluorescent lipofuscin in all tissues, affecting the central nervous system most severely, and result in a severe neurodegenerative disorder, juvenile neuronal lipofuscinosis (JNCL) or Batten disease (3Consortium The International Batten Disease Cell. 1995; 82: 949-957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). CLN3 is highly conserved from yeast to human, and therefore it has been suggested to have a fundamental role in cellular metabolism. Although sequence comparisons have shown a distant relationship between CLN3 and a family of equilibrative nucleoside transporters (4Baldwin S.A. Beal P.R. Yao S.Y. King A.E. Cass C.E. Young J.D.

Genet. 2004; 13: 3017-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, the exact function of the protein has remained unclear. We have recently reported that the lysosomal trafficking of CLN3 in non-neuronal and neuronal cells is mediated by two targeting motifs located in the last cytoplasmic loop domain and in the long carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail of the protein (2Kyttälä A. Ihrke G. Vesa J. Schell M.J. Luzio J.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1313-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Whereas the motif in the loop domain is a traditional dileucine-type motif LI, with an upstream acidic patch in an unusual position, the motif in the tail represents a novel type of targeting motif consisting of methionine and glycine residues separated by nine other amino acids (Fig. 1). CLN3 has been suggested to have a role also outside the lysosomes, especially in neurons, because endogenous CLN3 was located to the synaptic region in a subcellular fractionation analysis of the mouse brain (10Luiro K. Kopra O. Lehtovirta M. Jalanko A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2123-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and transfected CLN3 was shown to localize to early endosomes in cultured rat hippocampal neurons by immunostaining methods (2Kyttälä A. Ihrke G. Vesa J. Schell M.J. Luzio J.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1313-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Deletion of both lysosomal targeting motifs of CLN3 abolished the lysosomal trafficking of the protein in neurons but did not detectably affect its targeting to early endosomes (2Kyttälä A.

Trafficking of newly synthesized lysosomal membrane proteins from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) 1The abbreviations used are: TGN, trans-Golgi network; GST, glutathione S-transferase; NRK, normal rat kidney; PFA, paraformaldehyde; GFP, green fluorescent protein. to lysosomes may occur indirectly, via the plasma membrane followed by endocytosis, or directly, via the endosomal system. Two major types of signal motif present in short cytoplasmic tails facilitate the targeting of many lysosomal membrane proteins: the GYXXΦ motif, in which X can be any amino acid residue and Φ is a bulky hydrophobic residue, and dileucine motifs (11Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar). Unusual lysosomal targeting motifs have also been reported in a small number of other lysosomal membrane proteins (2Kyttälä A. Ihrke G. Vesa J. Schell M.J. Luzio J.P. Mol. Biol.

The correct sorting of proteins destined for late endocytic organelles is most often facilitated by specific recognition of their signal motifs by heterotetrameric adaptor proteins, AP-1, -2, -3, and -4, or by monomeric Golgi-localized, γ-ear-containing, ARF-binding proteins (GGAs) (14Boman A.L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3413-3418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Robinson M.S. Bonifacino J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 444-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 16Robinson M.S.

Conflicting data have been presented about which of the four adaptor subunits recognize(s) and bind(s) to dileucine motifs (20Bremnes T. Lauvrak V. Lindqvist B. Bakke O. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2148-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Recent data have suggested that the γ/δ-(of the AP-1 and AP-3, respectively) and σ-subunits may both be involved in recognition of the dileucine-type motifs (22Janvier K. Kato Y. Boehm M. Rose J.R. Martina J.A. Kim B.Y. Venkatesan S. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1281-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). While AP-2 has been reported to function mainly in clathrin-mediated endocytosis at the plasma membrane, the sites of action of other heterotetrameric adaptor proteins have remained controversial. Originally, AP-1, -3, and -4 were thought to facilitate trafficking of proteins from the TGN, but studies in adaptor-deficient cell lines with wild type, mutated, and chimeric membrane proteins (23Meyer C. Zizioli D. Lausmann S. Eskelinen E.L. Hamann J. Saftig P. von Figura K. Schu P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2193-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 24Ihrke G. Kyttälä A. Russell M.R.

In the present study, we have addressed the trafficking and sorting of CLN3. We have examined the trafficking of different CLN3 polypeptides, carrying mutations in either one or both targeting motifs, in cell lines deficient for the adaptor proteins AP-1 or AP-3. We show that the dileucine motif of CLN3 binds both AP-1 and AP-3 in vitro, and a deficiency of either one of these adaptors results in mistargeting of CLN3 when sorting solely depends on its dileucine motif. The current data provide novel information toward understanding the cellular pathways and organelles in which CLN3 could function and emphasize the diversity of sorting mechanisms utilized in trafficking of membrane proteins.

The Golgi complex was stained with a monoclonal antibody against the Golgi matrix protein 130 kDa (GM130, Pharmingen). Monoclonal antibodies to AP-1γ and AP-2α were from BD Biosciences (Pharmingen). AP-3 was detected either with a monoclonal mouse antibody against the δ-subunit (SA4) from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma bank (University of Iowa) or the purified rabbit antibody recognizing δ-adaptin (34Peden A.A.

Eight to 12 h after transfection, the expression of CLN3 was induced by adding 5 μm CdCl2 to the culture medium. Twenty-four h after transfection, the cells were starved in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 2–4 h and then were incubated for 20 min in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 μg/ml Alexa594-conjugated human serum transferrin (Molecular Probes). The cells were then washed and subsequently fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate-buffered saline for immunofluorescence analysis. Immunofluorescence Labeling and Microscopy—For immunofluorescence analysis, transiently transfected mocha and pearl cells were grown on coverslips and were fixed with 4% PFA 48–72 h after transfection with different CLN3pCMV constructs. In stably transfected cells, the expression of the ΔpMEP4 constructs was induced by adding 3 μm CdCl2 to the culture medium 16–48 h before fixation or before inhibiting protein synthesis with cycloheximide to allow chasing of proteins to their sites of residence. The cycloheximide chase was performed by adding 50 μg/ml cycloheximide 20 h before fixation. The PFA-fixed cells were then permeabilized with 0.2% saponin, which was thereafter kept in all solutions during the labeling process. The labeled coverslips were mounted in GelMount (Biomeda Corp., Foster City, CA) and were visualized with a Zeiss Axioplan microscope equipped with a CCD camera (Fig. 2) or confocal microscopes Bio-Rad MRC 1024 or Leica DMR. Adobe Photoshop software was used for image processing. GST Pull-down Experiments—For in vitro binding assays, the wild type and mutated (L253A/I254A) CLN3loop domains (see above) were produced as GST fusion proteins in E. coli and immobilized by binding to gluthathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) overnight at 4 °C. The cytosolic extract of HeLa cells was prepared by lysing the cells in a lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100) and removing the cell debris by centrifugation. The mouse liver extract was prepared by homogenizing one adult mouse liver in 8 ml of extraction buffer (50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% Triton X-100) followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min in a Beckman TLA 100.3 rotor. GST pull-down experiments were performed by incubating the GST fusion proteins either with 2 ml of cytosolic extract of HeLa cells (∼2 mg/ml) or with 0.5 ml (∼10 mg/ml) of mouse liver extract (diluted to 2 ml with extraction buffer) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed five times with lysis or extraction buffer, and samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, immunoblotted, and probed with antibodies to different adaptor protein subunits (see above). Determination of the Intracellular Trafficking Route(s) of CLN3—Newly synthesized lysosomal membrane proteins traffic to lysosomes either directly from the TGN or indirectly via the plasma membrane. Investigation of the possible indirect route taken by the CLN3 protein by antibody uptake experiments was not possible, because all the antibodies we have produced so far recognize only cytoplasmic (or intracellular) domains of the protein (2Kyttälä A. Ihrke G. Vesa J. Schell M.J. Luzio J.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1313-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 10Luiro K. Kopra O. Lehtovirta M. Jalanko A. Hum. Mol.

Trials to make use of intramolecular tags in luminal (extracellular) loop domains of CLN3 failed because all inserted tags caused defects in normal trafficking of CLN3 such as retention of the protein in the ER. 2A. Kyttälä, unpublished results. Thus, to determine the lysosomal trafficking route(s) of CLN3, we tested whether the protein could be arrested at the plasma membrane in cells in which the clathrin-mediated endocytosis was inhibited. NRK cells stably expressing wtCLN3 (2Kyttälä A. Ihrke G. Vesa J. Schell M.J. Luzio J.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1313-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) were transfected with GFP-tagged mutant Eps15 GFP-EΔ95/295, or myc-tagged AP180pCMV, both well characterized inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (32Benmerah A. Bayrou M. Cerf-Bensussan N. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1303-1311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Ford M.G. Pearse B.M. Higgins M.K. Vallis Y. Owen D.J. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Science. 2001; 291: 1051-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). The transfected cells were fed with Alexa594-conjugated transferrin for 20 min, and inhibition of endocytosis in the transfected cells was confirmed by monitoring the uptake of transferrin by fluorescence microscopy. Expression of the GFP-EΔ95/295 or AP180 effectively inhibited internalization of transferrin, which was predominantly located on the plasma membrane (Fig. 2, B and D). Assuming that the trafficking of CLN3 occurs by the indirect route, some of the protein should have been arrested at the plasma membrane under these conditions. However, the stably expressed CLN3 protein was not detected on the plasma membrane in the cells with restricted endocytosis (Fig. 2, A and C), suggesting that in stably transfected NRK cells, CLN3 favors the direct intracellular trafficking route from the TGN to the lysosomes. Trafficking of CLN3 in AP-3-deficient mocha and pearl Cells—We have identified two lysosomal targeting motifs located in two different cytoplasmic domains of CLN3 (2Kyttälä A. Ihrke G. Vesa J. Schell M.J. Luzio J.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1313-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The MX9G motif in the long cytoplasmic tail of the CLN3 protein represents a novel type of sequence motif among lysosomal targeting signals, and its recognition by different adaptors cannot be predicted. However, the second motif is a dileucine-type LI signal located in a cytoplasmic loop domain of CLN3, preceded by an acidic patch in an unusual position (Fig. 1). Although the location of the acidic residues in the CLN3 loop does not favor the positional criteria reported for recognition by AP-3 (11Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar), the role of this adaptor in the trafficking of CLN3 was suggested by studies in which the function of AP-3 was inhibited by antisense oligonucleotides (36Mao Q. Xia H. Davidson B.L. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore, we expressed (stably or transiently) wtCLN3 and CLN3 carrying mutations in either one or both targeting motifs in AP-3δ-deficient mocha cells. The steady state localization of the stably expressed wtCLN3 was in lysosomes, judged by its colocalization with LAMP-1 (Fig. 3, A–C). Similarly, when the dileucine motif was mutated (L253A/I254A = MX9G only), the protein was also present in lysosomes targeted by the tail motif (Fig. 3, D–F). Interestingly, when we expressed CLN3 carrying alanine substitutions in the tail targeting motif (M409A + G419A = LI only), so that trafficking of the protein was completely dependent on its dileucine motif, the protein was not detected in the lysosomes of the mocha cells (Fig. 3, G–I). Instead, the trafficking of the mutated protein was mainly arrested at the Golgi complex (Fig. 3, J–L). After chasing the mutated protein for 20 h in the presence of cycloheximide, some of the cells also showed mutated CLN3 on the plasma membrane (data not shown). Similarly, when this mutated CLN3 construct was expressed transiently under the strong cytomegalovirus promoter (in pCMV5 vector) and chased in the presence of cycloheximide, some of the transfected cells showed mutated CLN3 on the plasma membrane and in vesicular structures, which, however, did not significantly colocalize with the lysosomal marker LAMP-1 (Fig. 4, A–C). We also transiently expressed CLN3 carrying mutations in both targeting motifs (double mutant) (2Kyttälä A. Ihrke G. Vesa J. Schell M.J. Luzio J.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1313-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) in mocha cells. The double-mutated CLN3 did not accumulate at the Golgi complex but, similarly to what was observed earlier in HeLa cells (2Kyttälä A. Ihrke G. Vesa J. Schell M.J. Luzio J.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1313-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), was mainly detected on the plasma membrane and in vesicular structures with hardly any colocalization with LAMP-1 (Fig. 4, D–F). To confirm that the detected accumulations were due to AP-3 deficiency, we also expressed all the different CLN3 constructs transiently in pearl cells deficient for the β3A-subunit of the AP-3. Similarly to what was seen in mocha cells, the localization of both wtCLN3 and CLN3 carrying the alanine substitution in the dileucine motif (MX9G only) was in the lysosomes of pearl cells (data not shown). The mutated protein with only the functional dileucine motif (and mutations in the tail motif) was mostly localized to the Golgi (Fig. 4, G–I) and was present at the plasma membrane of pearl cells only when chased for long periods in the presence of cycloheximide (Fig. 4, J–L).Fig. 4Trafficking of mutated CLN3 in AP-3-deficientmochaandpearlcells.Mocha (A–F) or pearl (G–L) cells were transiently transfected with CLN3pCMV5 constructs carrying a mutation in the tail targeting motif (CLN3 M409A+G419A = LI only; A–C and G–L) or in both the lysosomal targeting motifs (double mutant, D–F). At 48 h after transfection, the cells were either fixed with 4% PFA (D–I) or chased for an additional 20 h in the presence of 50 μg/ml cycloheximide (chx) before fixation (A–C and J–L). The fixed cells were permeabilized, stained for CLN3 and LAMP-1 and analyzed by confocal microscopy. Chasing with cycloheximide resulted in clearance of the Golgi accumulation of CLN3 carrying only the LI motif (LI only = CLN3 M409A+G419A) in mocha cells, but no significant colocalization with LAMP-1 was detected (A–C and C′). The CLN3 carrying mutations in both of the lysosomal targeting motifs (double mutant) was mistargeted from the lysosomes (D–F) without accumulation at the Golgi complex. The CLN3 carrying the mutated tail targeting motif (LI only) was also mistargeted from the lysosomes in pearl cells and accumulated to the perinuclear region (G–I). Chasing for 20 h with cycloheximide led to the clearance of the perinuclear accumulation in most of the transfected pearl cells (J–L and L′).

In these cells, the steady state localization of the two mannose 6-phosphate receptors is shifted to endosomes (23Meyer C. Zizioli D. Lausmann S. Eskelinen E.L. Hamann J. Saftig P. von Figura K. Schu P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2193-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Proteins in which targeting motifs are normally recognized by AP-1 are missorted to the plasma membrane and transported to lysosomes after endocytosis (37Reusch U. Bernhard O. Koszinowski U. Schu P.

When the localization of the stably expressed CLN3 constructs was analyzed in Δμ1A cells by confocal microscopy, the wild type protein was found to colocalize well with the lysosomal marker protein LAMP-1 (Fig. 5, A–C). CLN3 carrying mutations in its dileucine motif (MX9G only) was mostly located to the lysosomes, although, as seen in transiently transfected HeLa cells (2Kyttälä A. Ihrke G. Vesa J. Schell M.J.

https://openalex.org/W2147240914,"Mouse embryos lacking the Runx1 transcription factor exhibit an angiogenic defect accompanied by the absence of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). To ask whether Runx1 plays a direct role in angiogenesis, we established a novel endothelial progenitor cell line, designated AEL-ΔR1, from the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region of Runx1-null mouse. We introduced Runx1 cDNA into AEL-ΔR1 cells under the doxycycline-inducible promoter. The ability of AEL-ΔR1 cells to form vascular networks on matrigel was highly enhanced by the restored expression of Runx1. By molecular comparison of mRNAs in AEL-ΔR1 cells before and after the induction of Runx1, we found that mRNA expression of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) is downregulated by Runx1. Gel retardation and reporter assays revealed that Runx1 binds to the promoter region of mouse IGFBP-3 gene and represses its transcription. When IGFBP-3 was exogenously added in the matrigel assay, the angiogenesis-enhancing activity of Runx1 was suppressed in a dose-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that Runx1 is directly involved in angiogenesis by repression of IGFBP-3 mRNA expression."
https://openalex.org/W2010486747,"Mutations in the transmembrane receptor patched1 (ptc1) are responsible for the majority of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) cases. Many of these mutations, including ptc1-Q688X, result in premature truncation of the ptc1 protein. ptc1-Q688X has been identified in patients with both BCC and nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome, an inheritable disorder causing a predisposition to cancer susceptibility. Here we describe a mechanism by which ptc1-Q688X causes constitutive cellular signaling. Cells expressing ptc1-Q688X demonstrate an increase in cell cycle progression and induce cell transformation. The ptc1-Q688X mutant enhances Gli1 activity, a downstream reporter of sonic hedgehog (shh)–ptc1 signaling, independent of shh stimulation. In contrast to wild-type ptc1, ptc1-Q688X fails to associate with endogenous cyclin B1. Expression of nuclear-targeted cyclin B1 derivatives promotes Gli1-dependent transcription, which correlates temporally with cyclin B1–cdk1 kinase activity. Coexpression of wild-type ptc1 with a nuclear-targeted cyclin B1 derivative, mutated to mimic constitutive phosphorylation, dramatically decreases Gli1 activity. In addition, the coexpression of this constitutively nuclear cyclin B1 derivative with ptc1-Q688X substantially enhances foci formation. These studies therefore describe a molecular mechanism for the aberrant activity of ptc1-Q688X that includes the premature activation of the transcription factor Gli1."
https://openalex.org/W2077828483,"Stalled bacterial ribosomes are freed when they switch to the translation of transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA). This process requires the tmRNA-binding and ribosome-binding cofactor SmpB, a β-barrel protein with a protruding C-terminal tail of unresolved structure. Some plastid genomes encode tmRNA, but smpB genes have only been reported from bacteria. Here we identify smpB in the nuclear genomes of both a diatom and a red alga encoding a signal for import into the plastid, where mature SmpB could activate tmRNA. Diatom SmpB was active for tmRNA translation with bacterial components in vivo and in vitro, although less so than Escherichia coli SmpB. The tail-truncated diatom SmpB, the hypothetical product of a misspliced mRNA, was inactive in vivo. Tail-truncated E. coli SmpB was likewise inactive for tmRNA translation but was still able to bind ribosomes, and its affinity for tmRNA was only slightly diminished.

It also reveals a tail-dependent role for SmpB in tmRNA translation that supersedes a simple role of linking tmRNA to the ribosome, which the SmpB body alone could provide. Translating ribosomes can stall, for example, when they arrive at the 3′-end of an mRNA lacking an in-frame stop codon (nonstop mRNA) (1Keiler K.C. Waller P.R. Sauer R.T. Science. 1996; 271: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). Stalling could sequester ribosomes and produce incomplete polypeptides. In bacteria these problems are ameliorated by tmRNA, 1The abbreviations used are: tmRNA, transfer-messenger RNA; EF, elongation factor; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. a specialized RNA with both tRNA-like and mRNA-like properties. The stalled ribosome can switch mRNA templates, leaving nonstop mRNA and resuming translation on the reading frame in tmRNA, where the ribosome is freed upon release at the tmRNA stop codon. The protein encoded by the nonstop mRNA gains a hydrophobic peptide tag encoded by tmRNA that is a signal directing the proteolysis of the entire tagged protein. In model bacteria, the protein SmpB is a requisite cofactor of tmRNA (2Karzai A.W. Susskind M.M. Sauer R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3793-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 3Wiegert T.

In this article we show that for two eukaryotes with a plastidial ssrA gene, the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana and the red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae, SmpB is encoded in the nucleus with an apparent signal for import into the plastid. The predicted mature T. pseudonana SmpB is active in tmRNA translation with Escherichia coli components in vivo and in vitro. Its lower activity relative to that of E. coli SmpB is ascribed, through the study of chimeric proteins, to its β-barrel domain and not to its C-terminal tail. The latter result does not mean that the tail has no function; indeed, with deletion of just half the tail tmRNA translation was undetectable. The affinity of SmpB for either ribosomes or tmRNA was not significantly affected by tail truncation, indicating that the role of SmpB in tmRNA translation is more complex than providing a simple link between tmRNA and the ribosome. Construction of the T. pseudonana smpB Gene—A coding sequence was designed for T. pseudonana pre-SmpB residues 52–197 (protein TT0 of Fig. 1; see also Fig. 2), with the codon bias approximating as closely as possible that of E. coli SmpB, and flanked by start and stop codons and NsiI and BamHI restriction sites. The gene was constructed from 16 ∼45-mer oligonucleotides sharing ∼15-nucleotide sequence overlaps with neighbors by mutually extending eight oligonucleotide pairs hybridized at their 3′-ends with TaqDNA polymerase, followed by three rounds of the following: 1) amplification of one strand of each DNA with TaqDNA polymerase; 2) hybridization at the 3′-end to a neighboring partner; 3) mutual extension with TaqDNA polymerase; and 4) amplification of the product by PCR. The final product was subsequently cloned into the pCR2.1 Topo vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced.

Expression of reporter nonstop mRNA was induced by adding 0.75 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a mid-log (A600 of 0.4) culture in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with antibiotics and shaking at 37 °C for 1 h. The His-tagged reporter protein was purified from harvested cells, and the amount from the 2.5-ml culture was analyzed by electrophoresis in a protein gel with Coomassie staining (17Williams K.P. Martindale K.A. Bartel D.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5423-5433Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In Vitro SmpB Assay—SmpB synthesis was induced in a mid-log (A600 of 0.5) culture of E. coli BL21 (DE3) (pLysS) containing an SmpB overexpression plasmid by adding 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and shaking for 3 h. Cells harvested from the 50-ml culture were lysed in 1 ml of buffer A (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH8, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation and mixed with 0.25 ml of Ni2+-agarose (Qiagen) (50% slurry in buffer A) for 1 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed twice with 1 ml of buffer B (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). His-tagged SmpB was eluted with 2 × 200 μl of buffer B containing 250 mm imidazole. The eluted protein was dialyzed into storage buffer (50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 30% glycerol), and protein concentration was measured by UV spectrophotometry. The PCR product for the transcription of E. coli tmRNA by T7 RNA polymerase was prepared using a 3′-oligonucleotide with two 2′-methoxy nucleotides at its 5′ end; such templates greatly reduce the fraction of RNAs with nontemplated 3′-extensions (19Kao C. Rudisser S. Zheng M. Methods. 2001; 23: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). tmRNA was gel-purified and folded in translation buffer by heating for 2 min at 80 °C and cooling to 20 °C over 10 min. Tightly coupled ribosomes were prepared from E. coli strains KW1063 and KW2073, the products of transducing either the ssrA::cat or ΔsmpB-ssrA::kan alleles into the strain CAN20–12E (20Reuven N.B. Deutscher M.P. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) deficient in the RNases I, II, D, and BN. SmpB was detected in the preparation from the ssrA::cat strain by quantitative Western analysis at a molar ratio (SmpB/ribosome) of 0.005 ± 0.002. All additional factors were purified as six-histidine fusions of E. coli proteins (21Shimizu Y. Inoue A. Tomari Y. Suzuki T. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Ueda T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar). Reactions were in 100 μl of translation buffer (95 mm potassium glutamate, 9 mm magnesium acetate, 8 mm putrescine, 5 mm NH4Cl, 5 mm KPO4, pH 7.3, 1 mm spermidine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm CaCl2) containing 3.2 μl of storage buffer, 30 pmol of ribosomes, 20 pmol of tmRNA, 0.6 μg of initiation factor (IF) 1, 1.2 μg of IF2, 0.45 μg of IF3, 30 pmol of EF-G, 60 pmol of EF-Tu, 30 pmol of EF-Ts, 0.3 μg of release factor (RF) 1, 0.3 μg of RF3, 0.3 μg of ribosome recycling factor (RRF), 120 ng of creatine kinase (Sigma), 90 ng of myokinase (Sigma), 32 ng of nucleotide diphosphate kinase (Sigma), 2.1 μg of alanyl-tRNA synthetase, 2.5 μg of phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase, 0.6 μg of asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase, 0.24 μg of aspartyl-tRNA synthetase, 0.39 μg of glutamyl-tRNA synthetase, 0.012 μg of tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, 0.12 μg of leucyl-tRNA synthetase, 2.8 A260 units of total E. coli tRNA (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm ATP, 1 mm GTP, 0.1 mm [14C]alanine (Amersham Biosciences), and 0.1 mm (each) phenylalanine, asparagine, aspartate, tyrosine, and leucine (21Shimizu Y. Inoue A. Tomari Y. Suzuki T. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Ueda T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar). Reactions additionally contained E. coli or T. pseudonana SmpB as specified. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C prior to initiation by the addition of 50 μg poly(U), incubated for 60 min at 37 °C, terminated with 2 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid, heated for 20 min at 90 °C, and incubated for 30 min on ice; alanine incorporation was then measured by filtering through glass fiber disks (Whatman) presoaked in 5% trichloroacetic acid, washing with 6 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid and then 2 ml of ethanol, drying, and scintillation counting. tmRNA Binding Assay—tmRNA was radiolabeled by randomly incorporating [32P]CMP during in vitro transcription and purified and folded as described above in binding buffer (0.2 m KCl, 50 mm MES-KOH, pH 6.5, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40). Reactions in 20 μl of binding buffer containing 25 pm tmRNA (∼10000 cpm), 2 μl of SmpB storage buffer, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and varying amounts of SmpB were incubated for 30 min at 22 °C and then filtered through 0.45-μm nitrocellulose disks prewet with binding buffer. Filters were washed three times with 2 ml of binding buffer and air-dried, and the fraction of tmRNA retained was measured by scintillation counting. Data were fit to the formula B = SF/(Kd + S) + S(1 – F)/(K2 + S), where B is the fraction of tmRNA bound, S is the concentration of SmpB, F is the fraction of tmRNA that binds tightly, Kd is the dissociation constant for F, and K2 is the apparent dissociation constant for the remaining tmRNA. The three fitted values for F averaged 0.48 with a S.D. of ±0.03. tmRNA Aminoacylation Assay—Reactions in 70 μl of translation buffer containing 50 μm [14C]alanine, 1 μm tmRNA, 2 μl storage buffer, and no SmpB or various forms of E. coli SmpB (1 μm) were initiated by the addition of 300 nm alanyl-tRNA synthetase and incubated at 37 °C. At various time points 10 μl was removed, quenched in 2 ml of ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid, incubated on ice for 30 min; alanine incorporation was then measured as described above. Ribosome Binding Assay—The ΔsmpB-ssrA E. coli strain described above was transformed with the low copy plasmid encoding either the 000, EEE, or EE0 (Fig. 1) form of SmpB, and grown to an A600 of 0.41–0.42 in 800 ml of Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with kanamycin. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in 8 ml of lysis buffer (100 mm NH4OAc, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10.5 mm MgOAc, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) supplemented with 5 μg/ml DNase I, and lysed using a French pressure cell. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 45 min at 26,000 rpm in a Beckman TLA-100.4 rotor, and then ribosomes were pelleted by centrifugation for 90 min at 50,000 rpm in the TLA-100.4 rotor and resuspended in 0.4 ml of lysis buffer. The pellet fraction was subjected to centrifugation in an 11-ml 10–30% linear sucrose gradient in lysis buffer for 90 min at 35,000 rpm in a Beckman SW41 rotor. Gradient fractions (0.5 ml) were concentrated 10-fold and washed with lysis buffer using Microcon YM-10 centrifugal filter devices (Millipore). Samples were subjected to electrophoresis in a protein gel (14% polyacrylamide) followed by semidry electroblotting onto a nitrocellulose sheet. The blot was developed using a rabbit antibody raised against wild-type E. coli SmpB and horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit antibody. Nuclear smpB in Two Eukaryotes—Both plastidial ssrA and nuclear smpB genes were identified in highly redundant shotgun sequencing data for the diatom T. pseudonana (www.jgi.doe.gov) by BLAST searching. The plastidial location of ssrA is indicated by the match that it and its flanking sequence make to a previously determined plastid sequence from other diatoms. tmRNA is encoded in 341 bp (scaffold 118, 10569–10229) that can be aligned with a few short gaps to the Thalassiosira weissflogii plastidial tmRNA sequence (22Gueneau P. Loiseux-de Goe ̈r S. Williams K.P. Eur. J. Phycol. 1999; 34: 533-535Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar) with 85% identity. The flanking sequence continues to match the entire 1.8-kbp ssrA-containing sequence from the T. weissflogii plastid (GenBank™ accession AF049491) with 82% identity, and the whole 68-kpb scaffold matches throughout the plastid genome of the diatom Odontella sinensis (GenBank™ accession Z67753), albeit with rearrangements. The tmRNA encoded in the T. pseudonana plastid would appear to be functional because it contains the key tmRNA features, namely a tRNA-like structure involving the RNA termini and a reading frame encoding a hydrophobic peptide tag. The nuclear location of smpB is indicated by the two typical Thalassiosira nuclear introns it contains (Fig. 2) (23Armbrust E.V. J. Phycol. 2000; 36: 942-946Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This first example of eukaryotic SmpB shows remarkable similarity to bacterial SmpB, in particular to cyanobacterial SmpB (Fig. 3). Like introns identified in T. weissflogii nuclear genes (23Armbrust E.V. J. Phycol. 2000; 36: 942-946Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar), the smpB introns are short with strong matches to consensus features at the splice sites and branch region. The assigned start codon is the first in its reading frame; the only other in-frame AUG codon in the first exon is absent from one of the two T. pseudonana smpB alleles (see below). SmpB is much better conserved from bacteria to plastids than is tmRNA. The best BLAST hit at GenBank™ was to SmpB from the cyanobacterium Trichodesmium erythreum (Fig. 3), in keeping with the cyanobacterial origin of plastids. Identity is 48% over the length of the T. erythreum SmpB. Matching is strongest in the regions that are the best conserved among bacterial SmpBs and where contacts with tmRNA have been observed. One or two extra residues are inserted at three T. pseudonana positions, but these map to the ends of β-strands in the SmpB structural models (5Dong G. Nowakowski J. Hoffman D.W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1845-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 6Someya T. Nameki N. Hosoi H. Suzuki S. Hatanaka H. Fujii M. Terada T. Shirouzu M. Inoue Y. Shibata T. Kuramitsu S. Yokoyama S. Kawai G. FEBS Lett. 2003; 535: 94-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) where similar insertions occur in various bacterial SmpBs. The major change relative to bacterial SmpB is a 50-residue N-terminal extension. The sequence of this extension matches that of the bipartite signal/transit peptide for the complex diatom plastid, which is removed stepwise during import into the plastid (24Apt K.E. Zaslavkaia L. Lippmeier J.C. Lang M. Kilian O. Wetherbee R. Grossman A.R. Kroth P.G. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4061-4069Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It thus appears that diatoms deliver a very bacteria-like mature SmpB to a compartment containing tmRNA. T. pseudonana smpB had excellent sequencing coverage, revealing two alleles in the sequenced diploid strain. Querying the original sequencing reads with BLAST showed that 47 of them from independent shotgun clones impinged on the gene. There were 805 nearly invariant positions between the start and stop codons inclusive, sequenced by the BLAST hits 19.8 times on average with a 1.7% error rate (base miscalls and single-nucleotide insertions/deletions). However, variation rose above noise at the five remaining gene positions, each of which showed two alternative bases at approximately equal frequencies. One of the base variations creates a Met/Leu alternative in the putative signal peptide of the pre-protein, but the other four are either silent codon changes or at unimportant intron positions; the mature SmpB sequence is thus unaffected by any of the variations (Fig. 2). These five positions covaried among clones, establishing a pair of alleles with allelic linkage of each pair of neighboring variant positions observed in at least nine clones (Table I). One clone suggested an effective allelic recombination within a very short segment containing an intron/exon junction. Of the remaining clones, 22 could be assigned to one allele and 18 to the other, approximating the even distribution expected for a heterozygous diploid.Table ITwo smpB alleles present in the sequenced diatomNo. shotgun clones impinging on smpBVariant smpB gene positionaDash (—) represents a position not reached by sequence data for clone43168321358689Allele 1 (22 clones)4C————1CAG——2CAGC—3—AGCC3——GCC9————CAllele 2 (18 clones)2A————1AG———7AGAT—2——ATT1———TT5————TRecombinant1AGAC—Undetermined6—————Linkage to next variant positionNo. of clonesNonrecombinant-13686Nonrecombinant-28793Recombinant0010a Dash (—) represents a position not reached by sequence data for clone Open table in a new tab We also identified a nuclear smpB gene in new data from the red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae 10D (25Matsuzaki M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D104-D108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The best BLAST hit for this second nucleus-encoded SmpB is also from a cyanobacterium; identity is 52% over the length of the Synechococcus elongatus SmpB. The algal protein is predicted to contain an N-terminal signal peptide for its import into the simple plastid (Fig. 3). Like all but 27 of C. merolae nuclear genes, smpB has no introns. smpB genes found in other eukaryotic genome projects are best ascribed to bacterial contamination because they are un-interrupted by introns, in contigs with other bacterial affiliations, and encode proteins that are especially similar to known bacterial SmpBs. Sequences obtained from the nematode Brugia malayi, known to contain a Wolbachia endosymbiont, encode an SmpB that matches that from the Wolbachia endosymbiont of Drosophila melanogaster with 90% identity. One rice genome project (for Oryza sativa ssp. indica) contains at least four smpB sequences encoding proteins with identities of 76% to Sphingomonas elodea SmpB, 53% to Bacterioides thetaiotaomicron SmpB, 74% to Burkholderia fungorum SmpB, and 75% to Rubrivivax gelatinosus SmpB; such bacterial sequence contamination was identified and purposefully removed from another rice genome project. A segment containing adjacent smpB and ssrA genes, affiliated with Gram-positive bacteria, is found in a contig from the Trypanosoma cruzi genome project and not in sequence data from the other kinetoplastids Trypanosoma brucei or Leishmania major. Diatom SmpB Promotes tmRNA Translation in E. coli Cells—The extensive sequence similarity that eukaryotic SmpB shares with bacterial SmpB, together with its predicted import into plastids that encode tmRNA, strongly suggests that the role of SmpB in plastids is equivalent to its only known role in bacteria, in tmRNA translation. The homology further suggests that the plastid protein might function in bacteria as has been demonstrated for other plastid proteins (27Jiang F. Yi L. Moore M. Chen M. Rohl T. Van Wijk K.J.

Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7821-7826Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Very high sequence similarity between the tRNA domains of the E. coli and T. pseudonana tmRNAs, with base identity at all the positions where contacts were observed between SmpB and the tRNA domain (7Gutmann S. Haebel P.W. Metzinger L. Sutter M. Felden B. Ban N. Nature. 2003; 424: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), encouraged a test for activity of T. pseudonana SmpB in E. coli cells. An in vivo SmpB assay was developed from an earlier tmRNA assay (16Roche E.D. Sauer R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4579-4589Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 17Williams K.P. Martindale K.A. Bartel D.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5423-5433Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). An E. coli strain with a chromosomal deletion encompassing the neighboring smpB and ssrA genes was transformed with three plasmids; the first plasmid allowed for induction of a discrete nonstop mRNA, the second produced a tmRNA variant encoding a peptide tag that does not induce proteolysis, and the third expressed the test SmpB under control of the E. coli smpB promoter. In this system, active SmpB allows tmRNA to stably tag the reporter protein encoded by the nonstop mRNA; the 9% increase in reporter protein mass is readily detected in a protein gel. Control cells lacking SmpB produced only the untagged reporter protein, and those expressing E. coli SmpB produced only tagged reporter protein (Fig. 4). The latter control shows increased activity of the variant tmRNA relative to systems in which SmpB is provided from the chromosomal gene. Presumably, smpB expression is increased in this assay even though the same promoter as the chromosomal gene was used, perhaps due to a mildly elevated gene copy number on a low copy plasmid. To assay the predicted mature diatom SmpB in this system, its gene was constructed de novo. The codon bias was matched as closely as possible to E. coli smpB to keep synthesis rates equal. The T. pseudonana SmpB strongly promoted tmRNA translation in E. coli, albeit with some reduction of activity relative to E. coli SmpB (Fig. 4; compare lanes TTT and EEE). Diatom SmpB Promotes tmRNA Translation in an in Vitro E. coli System—SmpB activity was assayed in a recently described in vitro system (9Shimizu Y. Ueda T. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) adapted from an earlier tmRNA assay (29Himeno H. Sato M. Tadaki T. Fukushima M. Ushida C. Muto A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Ribosomes from ΔsmpB-ssrA E. coli were programmed with poly(U) in the presence of radiolabeled alanine, bulk E. coli tRNA, enzymatically synthesized tmRNA, elongation factors, all required aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, and the test SmpB. Poly(U) serves as a nonstop mRNA that should not promote the incorporation of alanine into polypeptide when SmpB is omitted but, nonetheles"
https://openalex.org/W2148686656,"Diffusion of solutes and macromolecules in brain extracellular space (ECS) is important for normal brain function and efficient drug delivery, and is thought to be impaired in edematous brain. Here we measured the diffusion of an inert macromolecular fluorescent marker (FITC-dextran, 70 kDa) in the ECS by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching after staining the exposed cerebral cortex in vivo. In a brain tumor model of vasogenic (leaky capillary) edema, FITC-dextran diffusion was reduced more than fourfold in hypercellular tumor and surrounding astrogliotic tissue; however, diffusion in brain away from the tumor was approximately 30% faster than in normal contralateral brain. The increased diffusion was abolished by dexamethasone pretreatment. Enhanced ECS diffusion was also found in uninjured brain near a region of leaky brain vessels produced by focal cortical freeze injury. In contrast, ECS diffusion was slowed more than sixfold in cytotoxic brain edema caused by anoxia. Diffusion results were related semiquantitatively to ECS volume fraction and matrix viscosity from in vitro photobleaching studies in a model system consisting of silica particles in a fluorescent water/glycerol matrix. Our data provide in vivo evidence for enhanced ECS diffusion in vasogenic brain edema, yet greatly slowed diffusion in cytotoxic edema and in and around tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1995100508,"Receptor-triggered control of local postsynaptic protein synthesis plays a crucial role for enabling long lasting changes in synaptic functions, but signaling pathways that link receptor stimulation with translational control remain poorly known. Among the putative regulatory factors are mRNA-binding proteins (messenger ribonucleoprotein, mRNP), which control the fate of cytosolic localized mRNAs. Based on the assumption that a subset of mRNA is maintained in an inactive state, mRNP-mRNA complexes were separated into polysome-bound (translated) and polysome-free (nontranslated) fractions by sucrose density centrifugation. Poly(A) mRNA-mRNP complexes were purified from a postmitochondrial extract of rat cerebral cortex by oligo(dT)-cellulose affinity chromatography. The mRNA processing proteins were characterized, from solution, by a nanoflow reverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatography-mu-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The majority of detected mRNA-binding proteins was found in both fractions. However, a small number of proteins appeared to be fraction-specific. This subset of proteins is by far the most interesting because the proteins are potentially involved in controlling an activity-dependent onset of translation. They include transducer proteins, kinases, and anchor proteins. This study of the mRNP proteome is the first step in allowing future experimentation to characterize individual proteins responsible for mRNA processing and translation in dendrites."
https://openalex.org/W2004189540,"The mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling pathway is a central regulator of tumor growth, which is constitutively activated in chemically induced mouse liver tumors. In about 30-50% of cases this effect can be related to activation of the Ha-ras gene by point mutations, whereas in the remaining cases mutations may occur in other members within this pathway, such as Raf kinases. Recently, B-raf has been shown to be frequently mutated in human melanomas and certain other cancers, with a V599E amino-acid change representing the most predominant mutation type. We now screened 82 N-nitrosodiethylamine-induced liver tumors from C3H/He mice for mutations within the hotspot positions in the Ha-ras and B-raf genes. About 50% (39/82) of tumors showed Ha-ras codon 61 mutations and 16 tumors ( approximately 20%) harbored mutations at codon 624 of the B-raf gene, which corresponds to codon 599 in human B-raf. None of the tumors was mutated in both Ha-ras and B-raf. The high prevalence of Ha-ras and B-raf mutations in mouse liver tumors is in striking contrast to human hepatocellular cancers which very infrequently harbor mutations in the two genes. These fundamental differences between the biology of liver tumors in mice and man may be of toxicological relevance."
https://openalex.org/W1967941716,"Many types of mammalian cells produce ROS in response to many different stimuli to modulate a number of cellular functions, including apoptosis. However, the correlation between ROS and apoptosis remains controversial, and the mechanisms whereby ROS-induced signals are propagated to critical downstream targets remain largely undefined. Here, we demonstrate that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) upregulates the expression of Bfl-1, an antiapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, and that this is responsible for the antiapoptotic activity of ROS. When Jurkat, human leukemic T cells, were pretreated with 100 microM H2O2 and then treated with anti-Fas antibody, apoptosis was impaired without change of cell surface Fas expression. An investigation of the expression patterns of Bcl-2 family genes revealed that H2O2 treatment induced Bfl-1 gene expression, but left other genes unchanged, and this Bfl-1 expression and H2O2 -induced antiapoptotic effect was inhibited by antioxidants or NF-kappaB inhibitor. In addition, an electromobility shift assay revealed that the p65/p50 subunits of NF-kappaB activated by H2O2 bound to a bfl-1 promoter. Neither the induction of Bfl-1 nor the antiapoptotic effect of H2O2 was detected in Bfl-1-knockdown Jurkat cell line containing Bfl-1 antisense (Bfl-1AS). These data indicate that oxidative stress induces the expression of Bfl-1 via NF-kappaB activation, and this early-response gene protects cells from Fas-mediated apoptosis. This may be a cellular survival mechanism of cells exposed to phagocytes-derived ROS."
https://openalex.org/W1984539641,"Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is caused by a CTG expansion in the 3′-untranslated region of a protein kinase gene (DMPK). Cardiovascular disease is one of the most prevalent causes of death in DM patients. Electrophysiological studies in cardiac muscles from DM patients and from DMPK-/- mice suggested that DMPK is critical to the modulation of cardiac contractility and to the maintenance of proper cardiac conduction activity. However, there are no data regarding the molecular signaling pathways involved in DM heart failure. Here we show that DMPK expression in cardiac myocytes is highly enriched in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) where it colocalizes with the ryanodine receptor and phospholamban (PLN), a muscle-specific SR Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a) inhibitor. Coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that DMPK and PLN can physically associate. Furthermore, purified wild-type DMPK, but not a kinase-deficient mutant (K110A DMPK), phosphorylates PLN in vitro. Subsequent studies using the DMPK-/- mice demonstrated that PLN is hypo-phosphorylated in SR vesicles from DMPK-/- mice compared with wild-type mice both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we show that Ca2+ uptake in SR is impaired in ventricular homogenates from DMPK-/- mice. Together, our data suggest the existence of a novel regulatory DMPK pathway for cardiac contractility and provide a molecular mechanism for DM heart pathology.

The dmpk gene product is a Ser/Thr protein kinase homologous to the MRCK p21-activated kinases (4Leung T. Chen X.Q. Tan I. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell.

Data obtained by using antibodies that detect specific isoforms of DMPK indicate that the most abundant isoform of DMPK is an 80-kDa protein expressed almost exclusively in smooth, skeletal, and cardiac muscles (6Lam L.T. Pham Y.C. Nguyen T.M. Morris G.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2167-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This kinase exists both as a membrane-associated and as a soluble form in human left ventricular samples (7Bush E.W. Helmke S.M. Birnbaum R.A. Perryman M.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8480-8490Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The different C termini of DMPK that arise from alternative splicing determine its localization to the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, or cytosol in transfected COS-1 cells (8Wansink D.G. van Herpen R.E.

However, an in vivo demonstration of the phosphorylation of these substrates by DMPK remains to be established, and a link between these substrates and the clinical manifestations of DM is unclear. DMPK knock-out mice (DMPK-/-) display a cardiac phenotype that reproduces many cardiac conduction defects observed in DM patients, including first-, second-, and third-degree atrioventricular block (12Reddy S.

A cardiac phenotype is also observed in heterozygous DMPK-/+ mice, which develop first-degree heart block, a conduction defect strikingly similar to that observed in DM patients (15Berul C.I.

However, the exact molecular mechanisms involved in the onset of heart failure in DM patients remain elusive (16Benders A.A. Groenen P.J. Oerlemans F.T. Veerkamp J.H. Wieringa B. J. Clin.

In the heart, calcium cycling across the SR plays a key role in regulating contraction-relaxation cycles (21Frank K.F. Bolck B. Erdmann E. Schwinger R.H. Cardiovasc. Res. 2003; 57: 20-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). When active, SR Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a) sequestrates cytoplasmic Ca2+, initiating cardiac relaxation. The activation of SERCA2a is tightly controlled by the SR membrane protein phospholamban (PLN) (22MacLennan D.H. Kranias E.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 566-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar), and chronic PLN-SERCA2a interaction is the critical Ca2+ cycling defect in dilated cardiomyopathy (23Minamisawa S. Hoshijima M. Chu G. Ward C.A. Frank K. Gu Y. Martone M.E. Wang Y. Ross Jr., J. Kranias E.G. Giles W.R. Chien K.R. Cell. 1999; 99: 313-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Cardiac phospholamban is a 52-amino acid phosphoprotein located in SR membranes with two adjacent residues, Ser-16 and Thr-17, identified as the phosphorylation sites for PKA and (Ca2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase II, respectively (24Jones L.R.

Unphosphorylated PLN inhibits SR Ca2+-ATPase, whereas phosphorylation of PLN reverses this inhibition (26Hagemann D. Xiao R.P. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2002; 12: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A previous report (20Pall G.S. Johnson K.J. Smith G.L. Physiol. Genomics. 2003; 13: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) suggested that PLN was hyperphosphorylated in cardiac homogenates obtained from DMPK-/- compared with control animals. However, the authors used specific anti-Ser(P)-16-PLN and anti-Thr(P)-17-PLN antibodies and showed a difference in mobility rather than the intensity of the bands, indicating that the modification of PLN that they observed in DMPK-/- samples was not Ser-16 or Thr-17 phosphorylation. Here we report that DMPK is highly enriched in cardiomyocyte SR, and it colocalizes, interacts with, and phosphorylates PLN. We demonstrate that PLN is under-phosphorylated in SR vesicles from DMPK-/- mice compared with wild-type mice both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we show that SR Ca2+ uptake is highly reduced in ventricular homogenates from DMPK-/- mice. The loss of DMPK phosphorylation of PLN may therefore represent an important determinant of ventricular dysfunction in DM. Materials—Mouse full-length DMPK cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. B. Wieringa (University of Nijmegen, The Netherlands). Human DMPK cDNA subcloned into pRSETc vector was a kind gift from Dr. L. T. Timchenko (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston), and Myc-tagged hDMPK was kindly provided by Dr. M. B. Perryman (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO). Monoclonal antibodies against human DMPK (MANDM5, 3D10) were provided by Dr. G. E. Morris (MRIC Biochemistry Group, North East Wales Institute, UK). Anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibodies were from Sigma. Anti-phospholamban (clone A1) and anti-phospho-phospholamban (Ser-16) were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). To detect mouse DMPK, we used the polyclonal anti-DMPK antibody from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. Anti-calsequestrin and anti-SERCA2a ATPase antibodies were from Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, CO). Monoclonal anti-Myc antibody 9E10 was obtained from the ATCC. Preparation of SR Vesicles from Mouse Left Ventricle—Left ventricles were homogenized in ice-cold solution 1 (10 mm NaHCO3, 0.2 mm CaCl2, and protease inhibitors) (1.5 ml/ventricle) by three bursts of 10 s in a Polytron homogenizer at half-maximum speed. The homogenate was diluted in an equal volume of ice-cold solution 2 (500 mm sucrose, 300 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 60 mm histidine, pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was recovered (total extract), diluted with 0.25 volumes of 3 m KCl, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was recovered and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was recovered as cytosolic fraction. The pellet was washed in solution 3 (250 mm sucrose, 600 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 30 mm histidine pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was finally resuspended in 200 μl of solution 4 (250 mm sucrose, 30 mm histidine pH 7.4) and repeatedly passed through a 25-gauge needle before storage at -80 °C. Proteins were measured by the method of Bradford (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Recombinant Adenovirus Generation and Neonatal Myocyte Gene Transfer—Recombinant adenoviruses expressing Myc-tagged human DMPK were generated by homologous recombination as described by Graham and Prevec (28Graham F.L. Prevec L. Mol. Biotechnol. 1995; 3: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The cDNAs were cloned into the shuttle plasmid pAdl1/RSV and cotransfected with pJM17 into 293 cells to achieve homologous recombination as described previously (29Canicio J. Ruiz-Lozano P.

Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were prepared from hearts of 2–3-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat pups as described previously (30Iwaki K. Sukhatme V.P. Shubeita H.E. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13809-13817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, hearts were digested with collagenase, and myocytes were purified over a Percoll gradient. Myocytes were seeded on coverslips in 4:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/medium 199 containing 10% horse serum, 5% fetal calf serum, and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin). Ten hours after isolation and culture, myocytes were infected for 2 h with either Myc-hDMPK (ad-myc-hDMPK) or green fluorescent protein (ad-GFP) as a control (data not shown) at a multiplicity of infection of 100, before the addition of a suitable volume of culture media. Twenty four hours later, the myocytes were washed and harvested for immunostaining. Immunofluorescence and in Situ Hybridization—Cardiomyocytes plated on coverslips were fixed for 20 min with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS, washed three times in PBS, and then treated as described previously (31Reig N. Chillaron J. Bartoccioni P. Fernandez E. Bendahan A. Zorzano A. Kanner B. Palacin M. Bertran J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4906-4914Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Images were obtained using a Leica TCS 4D laser confocal fluorescence microscope with a ×40 objective. For in situ hybridization, 7-μm paraffin sections from mouse day 14 embryos were rehydrated, treated with 10 mg/ml proteinase K for 7 min 30 s, and hybridized with 10,000 cpm 35S riboprobe/ml in hybridization solution containing 50% formamide, 30 mm, NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaH2PO4, 10% dextran sulfate, 1× Denhardt's, and 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). Hybridization was carried out for 14 h at 60 °C. Samples were subsequently washed at 60 °C in 5× SSC, 10 mm DTT, 2× SSC, 50% formamide, 10 mm DTT and digested with RNase A (10 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C and dehydrated. The antisense RNA probe was transcribed in vitro at 37 °C for 2 h with T7 RNA polymerase after the subcloned plasmid was linearized with NotI. After in vitro transcription, the plasmid template was digested with RNase-free DNase. The probe was purified using an RNase free S-200 microspin column (Amersham Biosciences). Slides were dipped in LM-1 photographic emulsion (Amersham Biosciences), exposed for 10 days, and developed at 12 °C in Kodak D19 solution for 3 min 30 s. Counterstaining was performed in 0.02% toluidine blue, and slides were mounted in Permount solution. Images were taken using an Olympus microscope equipped with dark field condenser (32Ruiz-Lozano P.

Transfections in HeLa Cells—Transient transfections were performed in HeLa cells by standard calcium phosphate precipitation in 10-cm diameter plates with a mixture of DNA containing 20 μg of total DNA (31Reig N. Chillaron J. Bartoccioni P. Fernandez E. Bendahan A. Zorzano A. Kanner B. Palacin M. Bertran J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4906-4914Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The GFP-encoding plasmid was included to monitor transfection efficiencies, which ranged from 60 to 90% as assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Generation and Purification of His6 Fusion Proteins—His6-hDMPK cDNA cloned into pRSETc vector (Invitrogen) was used as template to generate the K110A mutant hDMPK with the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The mutagenic oligonucleotide was 5′-CCAGGTGTATGCCATG(GC)GATCATGAACAAGTGGG-3′ (sense strand, the mutated nucleotides 1521 and 1522 are indicated by parentheses). Proper construction of the mutated cDNA was confirmed by complete sequencing. Expression of fusion proteins in Escherichia coli (BL 21) was induced by adding 0.1 mm isopropylthiogalactoside for 3 h to the bacterial culture in the exponential phase of growth. The bacteria were pelleted, resuspended in PBS, pH 7.4, lysed by sonication, and pelleted to remove debris. The soluble proteins were purified using chelating Sepharose charged with Ni2+ ions (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized by silver staining. Kinase activity of the recombinant proteins was measured as described below by using 10 μg of the purified fractions. Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 6 mm EGTA, 15 mm Na4P2O7, 20 mm NaF, 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% aprotinin, 2 mm pepstatin, 2 mm leupeptin and supplemented with 1% Nonidet P-40. Cell extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and 50 μg of the solubilized proteins was loaded. SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis were performed as described previously (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Protein expression was quantified by scanning densitometry of at least three independent experiments for each condition. Coimmunoprecipitation Assays—HeLa cells were cotransfected with Myc-hDMPK and FLAG-PLN. 24 h after transfection, cells were washed twice in PBS, scraped, and solubilized as described above. The supernatants (500 μg) were immunoprecipitated for 90 min at 4 °C with anti-Myc, anti-FLAG, or nonimmune control antibodies preadsorbed on protein G-Sepharose. The immunopellets were washed three times in solubilization buffer before being resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer under reduction conditions and analyzed by Western blot using polyclonal antibodies against Myc or FLAG, as indicated. Immunoprecipitation and Protein Kinase Activity—Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated for 2 h at 4 °C with protein G-bound anti-Myc monoclonal antibody. Immunopellets were rinsed three times in lysis buffer and once in kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2.5 mm DTT). Assays for protein kinase activity were carried out for 1 h at 37 °C in a volume of 40 μl of kinase buffer containing 0.1 μm ATP. Substrates used were FLAG- or Myc-tagged PLN expressed in HeLa cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG or anti-Myc antibodies, respectively. Reactions were stopped with Laemmli sample buffer, and samples were loaded onto 15% acrylamide SDS gels. SR vesicles (10 μg) were solubilized for 30 min at 4 °C with 1% Nonidet P-40 in the presence of protease inhibitors, and phosphorylation was carried out in the kinase buffer described above for 30 min at 37 °C, using 0.1 μm [γ-32P]ATP (1.5 mCi/μmol) (Amersham Biosciences) and in the presence of 5 μm PKA peptide inhibitor, PKI (Calbiochem). Gels were dried and developed by autoradiography. Phosphorylation was quantified by scanning densitometry of three independent experiments. Measurements of SR Ca2+Uptake—Ventricular tissue from 3- to 4-month-old DMPK+/+ and DMPK-/- mouse hearts was homogenized at 4 °C in 2.5 ml of homogenizing solution (25 mm imidazole, pH 7.0) with a Teflon glass Thomas tissue grinder. SR Ca2+ uptake assays were performed in ventricular homogenates at room temperature based on a protocol modified from that of Pagani and Solaro (34Pagani E.D. Solaro R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 247: H909-H915PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots (175 μl) of homogenates were transferred into tubes containing 1.4 ml of uptake buffer (100 mm KCl, 10 mm potassium oxalate, 40 mm imidazole, 10 mm sodium azide, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 μm ruthenium red) and 45Ca-EGTA buffer containing 0.185 μCi/ml 45Ca (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and a given amount of free Ca2+ (20 or 200 nm), which was calculated on the basis of the amount of added EGTA. Ruthenium Red was used to block Ca2+ efflux via the ryanodine receptor. After 5 min of preincubation, the uptake reaction was initiated by the addition of 2.5 mm sodium ATP. Ca2+ uptake was terminated at various times (1, 3, and 5 min for 200 nm free Ca2+; 1, 10, and 20 min for 20 nm free Ca2+) by filtering 250-μl aliquots on 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore-type MA), followed by two washes (5 ml) with uptake buffer without Ca2+ and ATP. The remaining radioactivity on the nitrocellulose filters was determined by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. Protein concentration was assayed with a DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Ca2+ uptake was calculated from the slope of the linear regression analysis relating 45Ca2+ uptake/mg of protein to reaction time. Expression Pattern and Cellular Distribution of DMPK— DMPK under-expression contributes to DM pathology; however, little is known regarding the specific cell types in which it is expressed. To obtain specific single cell resolution data on dmpk expression, we have performed radioactive in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry analysis. In the developing mouse embryo, dmpk mRNA is primarily detected in striated muscle structures that include all major muscles in the skeletal structures (Fig. 1, A and B), cardiac muscle, and diaphragm (Fig. 1D). We also detected dmpk mRNA in the smooth muscle of the lung and gut. We do not detect dmpk expression in the epithelium of the gut at this developmental stage (Fig. 1C). In the heart, dmpk expression is restricted to the cardiomyocytes in the ventricle and atrium, and we do not detect a hybridization signal in the epicardium nor in the endocardium. In the myocardium, the dmpk hybridization signal is stronger in the compact muscular zone compared with the trabecular zone, and the hybridization signal is almost indistinguishable from background in the primordia of the papillary muscles. We also observed dmpk expression in the muscular portion of the outflow tract (Fig. 1D). Previous work suggested that DMPK associates with the sarcoplasmic reticulum and gap junctions in rat cardiac muscle (35Mussini I. Biral D. Marin O. Furlan S. Salvatori S. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, those immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy data need to be redefined, because they were obtained using a polyclonal antibody that detected a 54-kDa band by Western blot, whereas it is now known that the main DMPK cardiac isoform is an 80-kDa protein (35Mussini I. Biral D. Marin O. Furlan S. Salvatori S. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we subsequently performed immunofluorescence studies to characterize the subcellular distribution of DMPK in cardiomyocytes, using a specific anti-hDMPK monoclonal antibody (6Lam L.T. Pham Y.C. Nguyen T.M. Morris G.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2167-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In adult human cardiomyocytes (Fig. 2, A–C), DMPK specifically colocalized with the ryanodine receptor (RyR), which has been characterized by ultrastructural studies as mainly confined to the SR membranes (36Carl S.L. Felix K. Caswell A.H. Brandt N.R. Ball Jr., W.J. Vaghy P.L. Meissner G. Ferguson D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 672-682Crossref Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Moreover, forced expression of Myc-tagged hDMPK by adenoviral gene transfer to rat neonatal cardiomyocytes showed that Myc-hDMPK was targeted to perinuclear structures where it colocalized with the SR proteins RyR and phospholamban (PLN) (Fig. 2, D–L). Control experiments with adenoviruses expressing recombinant GFP exhibited both cytosolic and nuclear localization (data not shown) but did not colocalize with endoplasmic reticulum markers. As an approach to estimate the percentage of DMPK localized in the SR, we performed subcellular fractionation of mouse left ventricles, and by Western blot we analyzed the proteins obtained at different steps in the fractionation procedure (10 μg of total extract, cytosol, and SR-enriched low density membranes). By taking into account the relative abundance of DMPK in each fraction and the total amount of protein recovered in each fraction, we determined that 31 ± 4% (n = 3) of total left ventricle DMPK localized to the low density microsomal fraction. This fraction, although enriched in SR membranes, contains other subcellular membranes where DMPK may also be expressed. (Fig. 2M). Most interestingly, DMPK is distributed similarly to the SR protein PLN (Fig. 2M, lower panel). DMPK Interacts with and Phosphorylates PLN—Because DMPK seems to be highly abundant in the SR of cardiomyocytes (Fig. 2M) and colocalizes with phospholamban in these cells (Fig. 2, A–L), and the phospholamban sequence contains several putative DMPK phosphorylation sites (7Bush E.W. Helmke S.M. Birnbaum R.A. Perryman M.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8480-8490Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 8Wansink D.G. van Herpen R.E. Coerwinkel-Driessen M.M. Groenen P.J. Hemmings B.A. Wieringa B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5489-5501Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that PLN could be a substrate for DMPK. We generated a hDMPK mutated at the ATP-binding site (K110A), which is a kinase-deficient mutant as observed by using myelin basic protein as a substrate (data not shown). We purified bacterially expressed recombinant His6-hDMPK (WT) and a His6-(K110A)hDMPK (K110A). We observed that FLAG-PLN expressed in HeLa cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody was phosphorylated at Ser-16 by wild-type but not by K110A-hDMPK (Fig. 3A). To rule out any effect because of improper folding of bacterially expressed DMPK, we also measured the kinase activity of Myc-hDMPK expressed in HeLa cells, observing the phosphorylation of PLN at Ser-16 by Myc-DMPK (Fig. 3B). No specific phosphorylation on PLN Thr-17 was detected under our experimental conditions (data not shown). DMPK and PLN physically interact, as shown by coimmunoprecipitation studies (Fig. 4). HeLa cells cotransfected with Myc-DMPK and FLAG-PLN were coimmunoprecipitated with either anti-Myc (Fig. 4A) or anti-FLAG (Fig. 4B) antibodies to immunoprecipitate DMPK or PLN, respectively, or to control nonimmune mouse IgGs. The association of DMPK and PLN was clearly evident in both conditions by assessing FLAG-PLN in the Myc-DMPK immunopellet and vice versa. Decreased PLN Phosphorylation Activity in Left Ventricle SR Vesicles from DMPK-/- Mice—We analyzed the phosphorylation state of PLN in SR vesicles purified from 12-week-old male WT and DMPK -/- mice. In both groups of animals, we examined the relative abundance of Ser(P)-16 PLN and the expression of the SR proteins SERCA2a ATPase, PLN, and calsequestrin. Although the steady state levels of all the proteins analyzed was similar in SR vesicles from DMPK-/- and WT mice, the amount of Ser(P)-16 PLN decreased by 1.8 ± 0.2-fold (n = 4) in DMPK-/- mice compared with WT animals (Fig. 5A). As described above (Fig. 3), DMPK phosphorylates PL"
https://openalex.org/W2066217969,"SP100 was first identified as a nuclear autoimmune antigen and is a constituent of the nuclear body. SP100 interacts with the ETS1 transcription factor, and we have previously shown that SP100 reduces ETS1-DNA binding and inhibits ETS1 transcriptional activity on the MMP1 and uPA promoters. We now demonstrate that SP100 expression is upregulated by interferons, which have been shown to be antiangiogenic, in primary endothelial cells. As ETS1 is functionally important in promoting angiogenesis, we tested the hypothesis that ETS1 activity is negatively modulated by SP100 in endothelial cells. SP100 directly antagonizes ETS1-mediated morphological changes in human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) network formation and reduces HUVEC migration and invasion. To further understand the functional relationship between ETS1 and SP100, cDNA microarray analysis was utilized to assess reprogramming of gene expression by ETS1 and SP100. A subset of the differentially regulated genes, including heat-shock proteins (HSPs) H11, HSPA1L, HSPA6, HSPA8, HSPE1 and AXIN1, BRCA1, CD14, CTGF (connective tissue growth factor), GABRE (gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor epsilon), ICAM1, SNAI1, SRD5A1 (steroid-5-alpha-reductase 1) and THY1, were validated by real-time PCR and a majority showed reciprocal expression in response to ETS1 and SP100. Interestingly, genes that are negatively regulated by ETS1 and upregulated by SP100 have antimigratory or antiangiogenic properties. Collectively, these data indicate that SP100 negatively modulates ETS1-dependent downstream biological processes."
https://openalex.org/W2101818876,"Cancer growth and progression is often critically influenced by the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a key mediator of angiogenesis. VEGF produced by tumor cells stimulates endothelial cell growth through the binding and activation of the KDR/Flk-1 receptor (VEGFR-2) on endothelial cells. Recently, some human breast cancer epithelial cells have been shown to express VEGF receptors, suggesting a potential autocrine-mediated growth stimulation of a subset of cancers by VEGF. We demonstrate that mammary tumors in the C3(1)/Tag transgenic model express VEGF and VEGF receptors and tumor growth is stimulated by this autocrine mechanism. GW654652, an indazolylpyrimidine, is a VEGFRs tyrosine kinase inhibitor that dramatically reduces both angiogenesis and tumor cell growth in this model, as demonstrated using both in vitro and in vivo assays. GW654652 significantly decreased cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and M6 mammary tumor cells derived from C3(1)/Tag (Tag: simian virus 40 T-antigen) transgenic mice. A 75% reduction in VEGF-induced angiogenesis was observed with GW654652 using the chick chorioallantoic membrane assay, whereas GW654652 produced an approximately 85% reduction in angiogenesis as assessed by the Matrigel™ plug assay. A profound inhibitory effect on tumor growth in the C3(1)/Tag transgenic model of human breast cancer was observed with oral administration of GW654652 as measured by delayed tumor onset, decreased multiplicity, reduced tumor volume, and extended animal survival. The antitumor effects of GW654652 were associated with reduced tumor vascularization and no apparent toxicity. Tumor growth, however, rapidly advanced following cessation of treatment. This is the first demonstration that a VEGF receptor inhibitor, GW654652, has a strong inhibitory effect on angiogenesis and tumor progression in a transgenic model of mammary cancer, suggesting that this is a useful approach for preclinical testing of such agents."

OxdB contains a protoheme that works as the active center of the dehydration reaction. The enzymatic activity of ferrous OxdB was 1150-fold higher than that of ferric OxdB, indicating that the ferrous heme was the active state in OxdB catalysis. Although ferric OxdB was inactive, the substrate was bound to the ferric heme iron. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed that the oxygen atom of PAOx was bound to the ferric heme, whereas PAOx was bound to the ferrous heme in OxdB via the nitrogen atom of PAOx. These results show a novel mechanism by which the activity of a heme enzyme is regulated; that is, the oxidation state of the heme controls the coordination structure of a substrate-heme complex, which regulates enzymatic activity. Rapid scanning spectroscopy using stopped-flow apparatus revealed that a reaction intermediate (the PAOx-ferrous OxdB complex) showed Soret, α, and β bands at 415, 555, and 524 nm, respectively. The formation of this intermediate complex was very fast, finishing within the dead time of the stopped-flow mixer (∼3 ms). Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that His-306 was the catalytic residue responsible for assisting the elimination of the hydrogen atom of PAOx.

Aldoxime dehydration is one of the most useful methods for nitrile synthesis. As the chemical dehydration of aldoximes requires harsh conditions, a biological process for aldoxime dehydration is required to establish an environmentally benign process. Recently, Asano and Kato discovered a novel heme-containing lyase aldoxime dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.29) from various aldoxime- or nitrile-degrading microorganisms through their studies on microbial aldoxime metabolism (1Asano Y.

Mayhew S.G. Asano Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 800-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The heme in OxdB is thought to be the active site for the dehydration reaction. OxdB is the first example of a hemeprotein catalyzing the dehydration reaction physiologically, although many functions of hemeproteins have been elucidated, including oxygen storage/transport, electron transfer, gas molecule sensor, and redox catalysis of various substrates. For hemeproteins, a heme can exhibit its physiological function via three functional patterns. (i) An exogenous ligand binds to and dissociates from a heme reversibly.

Typical examples are various b-type and c-type cytochromes (16von Jagow G. Sebald W. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 281-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 17Salemme F.R. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 299-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). (iii) A substrate must bind directly to heme iron for the enzymatic reaction to proceed. Heme iron has an oxidation state of 2+ or 3+ before the reaction starts. One of these two states is the resting form to which a substrate cannot bind, and the other is active and can bind a substrate. For example, P450-type monooxygenase (18Sano M. Roach M.P. Coulter E.D.

Thus, the oxidation state of iron heme is an important factor for whether a substrate can bind to the heme or not. In this work, we report that both Fe(II) and Fe(III) hemes in OxdB bind the substrate, PAOx, using a different coordination mode. As described in this paper, ferrous OxdB is active, but ferric OxdB is not. This demonstrates a novel mechanism by which the activity of heme enzymes is regulated, that is, the heme oxidation state controls in the coordination structure of the substrate heme complex. Rapid scanning spectroscopy using stopped-flow apparatus reveals a reaction intermediate in which the nitrogen atom of PAOx is bound to the ferrous heme. His-306 in OxdB is identified as the catalytic residue responsible for assisting the elimination of the PAOx hydrogen atom. Based on the experimental results obtained in this study, we propose the reaction mechanism of OxdB catalysis. Expression of OxdB in Escherichia coli—OxdB was expressed in E. coli JM109 under the control of the lac promoter in pUC18. The cultivation of E. coli cells was carried out as reported previously (2Kato Y. Nakamura K. Sakiyama H. Mayhew S.G. Asano Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 800-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 4Kato Y. Asano Y. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 28: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The harvested cells were stored at –80 °C until use. The recombinant OxdB with a His6-tag at the N terminus was prepared and used in this work. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Purification of OxdB—All purification procedures were performed at 4 °C. Purification of the recombinant OxdB was carried out as follows. The E. coli cells were resuspended in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 300 mm NaCl. The cells were disrupted by sonication and centrifuged to remove the undisrupted cells and cell debris. Cell-free extract was loaded on a Co2+-loaded metal-ion chelating column (Talon®). After washing the column with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 300 mm NaCl, OxdB was eluted from the column with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer containing 50 mm imidazole (pH 7.0). The fractions containing OxdB were combined and subsequently purified using a Superdex 200 column. The gel filtration column was operated with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Spectral Measurements—The electronic absorption spectra were measured on an Agilent 8453 UV-visible spectrometer. EPR spectra at low temperatures were measured with a Brüker X-band spectrometer (Brüker ESP300E) attached to a cryostat (Oxford ESR900) and a temperature controller (Oxford Model ITC4). The g values were calculated from the magnetic field and the microwave frequency, which were measured using a NMR tesla meter (Brüker ER035M) and a microwave frequency counter (Hewlett Packard 5352B), respectively. EPR measurements were carried out under non-saturating microwave power conditions. Rapid scanning spectra with a stopped-flow system were measured on a Unisoku RSP-1000 at room temperature. A solution of 4.7 or 0.9 μm ferrous OxdB, containing ∼2 mm sodium dithionite, was mixed with 10 mm PAOx dissolved in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer containing 10% dimethylformamide (DMF). When electronic absorption, EPR, and rapid scanning spectra were measured in the presence of PAOx, DMF was added to the buffer at a final concentration of 10% to dissolve PAOx. It was confirmed that 10% DMF did not affect the enzymatic activity of OxdB. Electronic Absorption Spectra—The electronic absorption spectra of OxdB are shown in Fig. 1. Ferric OxdB had a Soret peak at 407 nm and small absorption bands at 503, 539, and 630 nm in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) (Fig. 1). 2The Soret peak of OxdB was reported to be 424 nm in Ref. 2Kato Y. Nakamura K. Sakiyama H. Mayhew S.G. Asano Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 800-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar where an ion-exchange column in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol was used to purify OxdB. We found that OxdB changed to a low spin form by passing through an ion-exchange column in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol, although the reason is not yet clear. The resulting OxdB with the Soret peak at 424 nm was not reduced by sodium dithionite. A cell-free extract showed the Soret peak at 407 nm, suggesting that an accidental, but reproducible, conformational change occurred in OxdB during purification using an ion-exchange column in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol. These results indicate that a high spin form showing the Soret peak at 407 nm in the ferric state is the native form of OxdB. This spectrum is similar to that of H2O-bound Fe(III) myoglobin (8Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1971Google Scholar). The reduction of OxdB with sodium dithionite resulted in a shift of the Soret peak from 407 to 432 nm. Ferrous OxdB showed Q-bands at 558 nm with a small shoulder band at 588 nm (Fig. 1). Although the Soret peak at 432 nm was typical for five-coordinate Fe(II) hemeproteins, a shoulder band at 588 nm suggests that a six-coordinate Fe(II) form existed in a small fraction in ferrous OxdB. When CO gas was added to ferrous OxdB, the Soret peak shifted to 422 nm, indicating the formation of CO-bound OxdB (Fig. 1). The resulting spectrum was typical of CO-bound hemeproteins with a histidine as the proximal ligand. The Dependence of OxdB Activity on the Oxidation State of the Heme and on pH—The specific activity of OxdB was measured in both the ferric and ferrous state to clarify the active form. The activities of ferric and ferrous OxdB were 2.0 and 2.3 × 103 turnovers·s–1/heme at pH 7.0, respectively. Ferrous OxdB was 1150-fold more active than ferric OxdB, indicating that ferrous OxdB is the active form. Some cytochrome P450 (28Boucher J.-L. Delaforge M. Mansuy D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7811-7818Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and very recently reported aldoxime dehydratase from Pseudomonas chlororaphis B23 (OxdA) (29Oinuma K. Hashimoto Y.

The activity of OxdB was dependent on the pH of the assay solution, and this is shown in Fig. 2. The optimum pH range was between 7 and 8, and the activity decreased gradually below pH 7 and above pH 8. Denaturation of OxdB was observed below pH 6.0 and over pH 10.0. EPR Spectra—EPR spectroscopy provides useful information about the coordination structure of ferric heme. The EPR spectrum of ferric OxdB is shown in Fig. 3A. Ferric OxdB exhibited high spin signals with three-line splitting around g = 6 (g1 = 6.52, g2 = 6.15, g3 = 5.66) and a small anisotropic signal at g6 = 1.99. The former were perpendicular components containing a histidine residue as the proximal ligand, and the latter was the parallel component of the high spin heme. The signals around g = 6 were presumably because of two different conformers of the high spin heme. Although we tried to specify the g values of the two conformers by EPR experiments under various temperature and microwave power conditions, it was not successful. The signals at g4 = 2.30 and g5 = 2.05 were probably because of a low spin form of OxdB that existed in a small fraction. Substrate Binding to Ferric OxdB—Although ferric OxdB was inactive, the substrate (PAOx) was bound to the heme in ferric OxdB. The addition of PAOx to ferric OxdB resulted in a red shift of the Soret peak, as shown in Fig. 4. The Soret peak finally shifted to 418 nm on the addition of 500 eq of PAOx. A high spin marker band at 630 nm disappeared concomitantly with increasing α and β bands at 574 and 542 nm, respectively, when PAOx was added. These results indicated the formation of a six-coordinate low spin ferric heme by the coordination of PAOx with heme iron. The dissociation constant of PAOx for ferric OxdB, Kd, was estimated to be ∼65 μm. EPR spectroscopy also confirmed that a six-coordinate, low spin heme in OxdB was formed when PAOx was added to ferric OxdB. The EPR spectrum of ferric OxdB in the presence of 500 eq of PAOx is shown in Fig. 3C. The addition of PAOx gave rise to the appearance of signals around the g = 2 region because of a low spin heme (31Sigman J.A. Pond A.E. Dawson J.H. Lu Y. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11122-11129Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 32Gadsby P.M.A. Thomson A.J.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 5003-5011Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar), accompanied by decreasing intensity of the signal around g = 6 corresponding to a high spin heme. The signal with three g values at gz = 2.53, gy = 2.18, and gx = 1.87, shown in Fig. 3C, was assigned to a low spin heme that was formed by the coordination of PAOx to high spin ferric heme. The remaining high spin signals in Fig. 3C were because of multiple high spin Fe(III) species, which were also present in the absence of PAOx in potassium phosphate buffer containing 10% DMF, as shown in Fig. 3B. DMF causes a conformational change around the heme, which will cause a further signal splitting in the g = 6 region. The formation of the low spin species was consistent with the visible spectral change on adding PAOx. The crystal field parameters, Δ/λ (tetragonal field) and V/λ (rhombic field), calculated from the g-values by EPR allowed the identification of the heme iron axial ligands (33Blumberg W.E. Peisach J.

The crystal field parameters of PAOx-bound OxdB gave 0.55 and 6.71 for rhombicity and tetragonality, respectively. These values are close to type O coordination where a histidine and an oxygen atom are the axial ligands of a heme rather than the type H and B coordination where a histidine and a nitrogen atom are the axial ligands (35Taylor C.P.S.

The EPR spectrum of 2-phenylethylamine-bound OxdB with a bis-N-coordinated heme was completely different from that of PAOx-bound OxdB. These results indicate that PAOx binds to the ferric heme in OxdB via the coordination of the PAOx oxygen atom. It is reported that the oxygen atom of N-hydoroxo moiety (–C=N–O–) is bound to the ferric heme in the model systems (38Lefevre-Groboillot D. Dijols S. Boucher J.-L. Mahy J.-P. Ricoux R. Desbois A.

Substrate Binding to Ferrous OxdB—When substrate-binding experiments were carried out for ferrous OxdB using a UV-visible spectrometer, no spectral change was observed because of the very fast enzymatic reaction rate. The stopped-flow technique was therefore used to observe the reaction intermediate(s). Typical transient absorption spectra are shown in Fig. 5A, which were observed at regular intervals with stopped-flow apparatus after mixing ferrous OxdB with PAOx. A reaction intermediate that showed the Soret peak at 415 nm was observed immediately after mixing ferrous OxdB with PAOx. This reaction intermediate was the ES complex in which PAOx is bound to the ferrous heme. This ES complex showed α and β bands at 555 and 524 nm, respectively, with the Soret peak at 415 nm, which was a typical spectrum of a bis-N coordinate Fe(II) heme (40Dou Y. Admiraal S.J. Ikeda-Saito M. Krzywda S. Wilkinson A.J. Li T. Olson J.S. Prince R.C. Pickering I.J. George G.N. J. Biol.

As shown in Fig. 5B, absorbance at 415 nm because of the ES complex immediately increased to a constant value within the mixing dead time after mixing OxdB with PAOx. This shows that the approach to steady state [ES] was too rapid to be observed. His-306 as a Catalytic Residue—The substrate, PAOx, was directly bound to the ferrous heme in OxdB during catalysis, as described above. Generally, a catalytic residue(s) at a distal heme pocket where a substrate is bound plays a key role in the enzymatic reaction of a hemeprotein. To identify a possible candidate(s) for a catalytic residue(s) in OxdB, we carried out alanine-scanning mutagenesis on amino acid residues that can work as an acid or base catalyst. These experiments revealed that His-306 was a possible candidate for a catalytic residue in OxdB, because the H306A mutant showed very low activity. Although H306A OxdB showed almost the same electronic absorption spectra as wild-type OxdB, the specific activity of the H306A mutant decreased dramatically. The substrate-binding experiment showed that PAOx was bound to the ferrous heme in the H306A mutant, as shown in Fig. 6. The Soret peak shifted from 432 to 416 nm when PAOx was added to ferrous H306A OxdB. The resulting spectrum was identical to that observed for wild-type OxdB by stopped-flow spectroscopy (Fig. 5A). However, this spectral change for the H306A mutant could be observed on a standard UV-visible spectrometer. The spectrum of the reaction intermediate for H306A OxdB, showing the Soret peak at 415 nm, was finally converted into that of the ferrous form of this mutant after 30–40 min (data not shown). These results indicated that the mutation of His-306 did not result in a complete loss of OxdB activity, although H306A activity was very low compared with wild-type OxdB. OxdB is the first example of a hemeprotein that can catalyze a dehydration reaction physiologically. In this paper, we have characterized OxdB by means of spectroscopic, kinetic, and mutagenesis studies. The electronic absorption spectra of OxdB were similar to those of myoglobin in the ferric, ferrous, and CO-bound forms, suggesting that the heme environmental structure of OxdB was similar to that of myoglobin. The EPR spectrum of ferric OxdB shows characteristic three-line signals around g = 6 (g1 = 6.52, g2 = 6.15, g3 = 5.66), because of two different conformers of a high spin heme possessing a histidine as the proximal ligand. Two of three lines were attributable to one rhombic species and the third arose from a second species. A similar rhombic EPR signal in the low field region was observed for myoglobin mutants such as V68E myoglobin (g1 = 6.76, g2 = 6.0, g3 = 5.2) (42Egeberg K.D. Springer B.A. Martinis S.A. Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9783-9791Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and H64Y myoglobin (g1 = 6.63, g2 = 5.83, g3 = 5.43) (43Maurus R. Boumil R. Luo Y. Tang H.-L. Smith M. Mauk A.G. Brayer G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12606-12610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these myoglobin mutants, the distortion of the heme-bound water and/or of the distal heme pocket around the heme causes a rhombic EPR signal in the g = 6 region. Similar distortion around the distal heme pocket would be included in OxdB. The heme in OxdB is the active site for the dehydration of its substrate and binds directly the substrate. The enzymatic activity of OxdB is controlled by the oxidation state of heme iron; that is, ferrous OxdB is active but ferric OxdB is not. It is well known in heme enzymes, where a substrate is bound directly to a heme, that one of the two oxidation states, Fe(III) or Fe(II), is the active form and the other is the resting form (44Lippard S.J. Berg J.M. Principles of Bioinorganic Chemistry. University Science Books, Mill Valley, CA1971: 283-392Google Scholar). In these cases, only the active form of a heme can bind a substrate, indicating that whether or not a substrate is bound to a heme regulates enzymatic activity. EPR, UV-visible, and stopped-flow spectroscopy revealed that the substrate, PAOx, is bound to the ferric (resting form) and ferrous (active form) hemes via O- and N-coordination, respectively. Although the PAOx-ferric OxdB complex with O-coordination is inactive in the dehydration reaction, dehydration proceeds when PAOx is bound to the ferrous heme with N-coordination. These results show that the heme oxidation state controls the atom through which the substrate binds to the heme. To our knowledge, this is a novel mechanism by which the enzymatic activity of a hemeprotein is regulated. Although ferric OxdB binds the substrate, PAOx, to ferric heme iron, it shows very little activity, and this can be explained as follows. To carry out the dehydration reaction of PAOx bound to the heme via O-coordination, the cleavage of the N–O bond of PAOx or the elimination of the β hydrogen atom is required. However, both reactions are problematic, because there is no driving force (Scheme 1A). On the other hand, PAOx is bound to the ferrous heme in OxdB via the nitrogen atom of PAOx. Rapid scanning spectroscopy using a stopped-flow system reveals a reaction intermediate that shows the Soret peak at 415 nm. This reaction intermediate is an ES complex where the nitrogen atom of PAOx is bound to the heme (40Dou Y. Admiraal S.J. Ikeda-Saito M. Krzywda S. Wilkinson A.J. Li T. Olson J.S. Prince R.C.

An important role of the ferrous heme is to tether PAOx in the appropriate orientation toward a catalytic residue(s) in the distal heme pocket. Mutagenesis and substrate binding studies show that His-306 is a catalytic residue for PAOx dehydration. During the preparation of this manuscript, Konishi et al. (30Konishi K. Ishida K.

They propose that His-320 acts as a general acid catalyst in OxdA catalysis. The position of His-320 in OxdA corresponds to that of His-306 in OxdB in amino acid sequence alignment. Although OxdB shows high homology with the amino acid sequence (32% identity) to OxdA, there are some differences in enzymatic properties between OxdB and OxdA. Although the enzymatic activity of OxdA decreases gradually above pH = 5.5 (30Konishi K. Ishida K. Oinuma K. –I. Ohta T. Hashimoto Y. Higashibara H. Kitagawa T. Kobayashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47619-47625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), the pH dependence of OxdB activity is bell-shaped, as shown in Fig. 2. This pH profile for OxdB activity suggests that two catalytic residues with acidic and basic pKas, respectively, are involved in OxdB catalysis. His-306 in OxdB is assigned to a residue with an acidic pKa, which acts to assist the elimination of the PAOx hydrogen atom (Scheme 1B). In addition to His-306, a proton source is required to assist the elimination of the OH group in PAOx. In OxdB catalysis, His-306 and a side chain of an amino acid residue, which act as a proton donor, work concertedly as catalytic residues for the dehydration of PAOx to proceed. We are now in the process of identifying a catalytic residue that assists the elimination of the OH group of PAOx."

By employing co-immunoprecipitation and peptide mass fingerprinting using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, we found that hFAF1 binds to the 70-kDa heat shock protein family (Hsc70/Hsp70). Interaction mapping indicated that the 82-180 sequence of hFAF1 directly binds to the N-terminal region containing sequence 1-120 of Hsc70/Hsp70. This binding is very tight regardless of ATP and heat shock treatment. Hsc70/Hsp70 and hFAF1 co-localized in the cytosol and nucleus and concentrated to the perinuclear region by heat shock treatment. We examined how hFAF1 regulates Hsp70 function, and found that hFAF1 inhibited the Hsp70 chaperone activity of refolding denatured protein substrates, accelerated heat shock-induced SAPK/JNK activation, and raised heat shock-induced cell death in a binding dependent manner. These results suggest that hFAF1 prevents cells from recovery after stress by binding to and inhibiting the chaperone activity of Hsp70."

Small GTPases of the Rho subfamily (Rho, Rac, Cdc42) have a widespread role in the organization of numerous cell functions, such as polarity, motility, shape changes, membrane trafficking, gene expression, or production of toxic oxygen metabolites (1Takai Y.

Similarly to other GTP-binding proteins, they are active in the GTP-bound form and inactive in the GDP-bound state. The species of the bound nucleotide is regulated by three different types of proteins. Under physiological conditions, guanine nucleotide exchange factors promote the release of GDP and favor the binding of GTP, guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor maintains the small GTPase in its GDP-bound form in the cytosol, and GTPase-activating protein(s) (GAP) 1The abbreviations used are: GAP, GTPase-activating protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GMPPNP, guanosine 5′-[β,γ-imido]triphosphate. accelerate the endogenous rate of GTP hydrolysis of the small GTPase (4Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). According to recent data ∼170 proteins are predicted to function as GAP for various small GTPases of the Ras superfamily, and 70 of these proteins contain a typical Rho/RacGAP domain (5Peck J. Douglas IV, G. Wu C.H. Burbelo P.D. FEBS Lett. 2002; 528: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 6Bernards A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1603: 47-82PubMed Google Scholar). Apparently, cells with specialized functions express different subsets of this “GAP repertoire” (7Geiszt M. Dagher M.C. Molnár G. Havasi A. Fauré J. Paclet M.H. Morel F. Ligeti E. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 851-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Under in vitro conditions, many of the predicted Rho/RacGAPs interact with several members of the Rho subfamily (6Bernards A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1603: 47-82PubMed Google Scholar). Acceleration of GTP hydrolysis is based on the participation of a critical arginine of the GAP in the stabilization of the transition state of the substrate binding site of the small GTPase (8Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Kabsch W. Wiesmuller L. Lautwein A. Schmitz F. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1997; 277: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar). In addition to the GAP domain, Rho/RacGAPs contain a large variety of putative protein and lipid interaction domains, which could modify the localization, activity, or substrate specificity of the relevant GAP. However, our knowledge on the details of these interactions and on their functional consequences is scarce (9Bernards A. Settleman J. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 377-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). p50RhoGAP (also called Cdc42GAP) is a 50-kDa protein that is widely expressed in many tissues. The typical GAP domain is located near to the C-terminal end of the protein preceded by a short proline-rich sequence and by a domain that is homologous to Sec14p, a phospholipid transfer protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sec14 or BCH domain) (10Low B.C. Seow K.T. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14415-14422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In a previous study we have shown that the isolated GAP domain reacted significantly better both with Rac and Rho than the full-length protein did. We suggested an intramolecular interaction that could limit the accessibility of the GAP domain (11Molnar G. Dagher M.C. Geiszt M. Settleman J. Ligeti E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10542-10549Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The aim of the present investigations was to gain insight into the details of the proposed interaction within the p50RhoGAP molecule. On the basis of two-hybrid interaction experiments, GAP assays, and tests of the activity of a Rac-regulated enzyme complex we show that two different parts of the p50RhoGAP participate in the shielding of the GAP domain. Interaction with the prenyl moiety of the small GTPase releases this restraint within the GAP molecule.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar. The loading of the GTPase (1–4 μg of E. coli or Sf9 protein) was performed with high specific activity (3000 Ci/mmol) [γ-32P]GTP in low magnesium buffer (16 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, and 100 nm [γ-32P]GTP (5 μCi)) for 5 min at room temperature and stopped by adding 20 mm MgCl2. The loaded G proteins were kept on ice to decrease nucleotide hydrolysis. The GTPase reaction was initiated by addition of 3 μl of loaded G protein to 27 μl of reaction mixture (20 °C) containing 16 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm unlabeled GTP, and the investigated protein with GAP activity. Aliquots of 5 μl were taken at regular intervals and filtered through nitrocellulose filters. The filters were washed three times with 2 ml of ice-cold buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.7, and 5 mm MgCl2. The radioactivity was measured in distilled water on the basis of the Cerenkov effect in a Beckman LS 5000TD liquid scintillation spectrometer. Data are presented as the decrease in time of protein-bound radioactivity retained on the filters. Measurement of Superoxide Generation in the Cell-free System—The rate of superoxide generation was determined as the superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of ferricytochrome c measured at 550 nm in a Labsystems iEMS Microplate Reader. In the fully purified system 0.005 μg of purified and relipidated cytochrome b558 (0.6 nm) was incubated with 0.5 μg of p47phox (87 nm), 0.5 μg of p67phox (67 nm), 0.12 μg of GTP-loaded prenylated or non-prenylated Rac (60 nm), 125 μm 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol, 187.5 μm phosphatidic acid, and 125 μm cytochrome c in a final volume of 80 μl. Superoxide (O2·¯) production was initiated by the addition of 200 μm NADPH and followed for 20 min. For loading of Rac with GTP, 1.8 μg of the small GTPase was incubated in a final volume of 22 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, containing 4 mm EDTA and 30 μm GTP, for 10 min at 25 °C. Subsequently 20 mm MgCl2 was added, and the protein was kept on ice. Demonstration of Intramolecular Interactions in p50RhoGAP in a Yeast Two-hybrid System—To investigate potential intramolecular interactions, we cloned the isolated GAP domain in pGAD vector and tested its reaction with various fragments of the protein cloned into pLex vector (Fig. 1A). As summarized in Table I, we found an interaction between the GAP domain and 1–255GAP, a fragment containing the N-terminal end of the protein plus the Sec14 domain plus the proline-rich region. Interestingly, no interaction was detectable with the Sec14/proline-rich region or the Sec14 fragment, i.e. in the absence of the N-terminal end of the molecule. Interaction of the isolated N-terminal part of p50RhoGAP with the GAP domain could not be directly tested, as the 1–51 fragment induced strong non-specific transactivation of the reporter genes. On the other hand, in the two-hybrid system we could not reveal any interaction between the fragment 1–168 and the GAP domain, suggesting that the N-terminal 48 amino acids are not sufficient for the establishment of the intramolecular binding. (We verified that all constructs were correctly expressed.) These results suggest that amino acids both on the N-terminal and on the C-terminal end of the fragment 1–255 may be involved in the stabilization of the intramolecular interaction within the p50RhoGAP molecule. Apparently, in the full-length protein the critical domains are masked as the isolated GAP domain did not interact either with full-length p50RhoGAP or with the fragment lacking the first 48 amino acids (49GAP) (Table I).Table IInteractions of the GAP domain with different p50RhoGAP constructspGADpLEXFull-length GAP49GAP1-255GAP1-168GAPSec14/PRRSec14p50GAP domain--+--- Open table in a new tab Investigation of the Interaction of p50RhoGAP with Rac in the Two-hybrid System—In the two-hybrid system there was no detectable reaction between full-length p50RhoGAP and wild-type Rac1 (Table II). We did not find any reaction with wild-type Rac2 either (data not shown). Probably the interaction between the GDP form of this small GTPase and p50RhoGAP is not sufficiently stable to allow detection in the two-hybrid system. In contrast, the constitutively active mutant Q61LRac1 reacted with full-length p50RhoGAP and so did the T17NRac1 mutant. 2Experiments carried out in our laboratories indicate that Rac1T17N is either present in the cell partially in GTP-bound form or exhibits a special conformation mimicking the GTP-bound state of wild-type Rac1. Detailed data will be published separately. Interestingly, both mutants were only able to interact with the full-length protein, the absence of the first 48 amino acids prevented the interaction. No reaction was detectable between wild-type or mutant Rac1 and any other fragment of p50RhoGAP either. Thus, the first 48 amino acids of p50RhoGAP have a decisive role in the stabilization of the interaction of this GAP with its substrate, Rac.Table IIInteraction of p50RhoGAP constructs with prenylated Rac GTPasespGADpLEXFull-length GAP49GAP1-255GAPSec14/PRRSec14pRac1-----pQ61L+----pT17N+---- Open table in a new tab Next we asked whether the prenylation state of the small GTPase has a role in the interaction with p50RhoGAP. To this end we prepared C189GRac1, Q61L, and T17N mutants, where the absence of the cysteine from the C-terminal CAAX box of Rac prevents its prenylation in the yeast cell. In a quantitative β-galactosidase assay, wild-type Rac1 did not show higher activity than the empty vector, and this feature was independent of the prenylation state of the small GTPase (Fig. 2). This finding is in accordance with our data obtained on the filter (Table II). In contrast, in the case of both the Q61L and the T17N mutants, a significant difference was observed whether the protein was prenylated or not. The activity measured with the non-prenylated proteins did not exceed the background value, whereas with pQ61LRac1 and pT17NRac1 a 2.2- and 1.7-fold increase was detected, respectively. Thus, the prenyl moiety seems to participate actively in the stabilization of the interaction of Rac with p50RhoGAP. Effect of p50RhoGAP Fragments on GTP Hydrolysis by Rac—To test our results obtained in the two-hybrid system, we expressed the corresponding fragments of p50RhoGAP as GST fusion proteins (Fig. 1B) and studied their GTPase-activating effect in a classical radioactive GAP assay (Fig. 3). In accordance with our earlier finding (11Molnar G. Dagher M.C. Geiszt M. Settleman J. Ligeti E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10542-10549Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), full-length p50RhoGAP had only a weak GAP effect on non-prenylated Rac1 prepared from bacteria. Removal of the first 48 amino acids improved its reaction, although it did not attain that of the isolated GAP domain (198GAP) (Fig. 3A). The difference in the reactivity of the three constructs of p50RhoGAP was not affected by the presence of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate in equimolar ratio to non-prenylated Rac1 (data not shown). When GTP hydrolysis by prenylated Rac was investigated, the full-length protein and the two truncated forms proved to have similar efficiency (Fig. 3B). Next we wanted to gain information on which part of the Sec14 domain could be responsible for the restriction of the interaction of 49GAP with non-prenylated Rac. In deciding on the site of further truncations, we were led by two considerations. 1) The sequences participating in lipid binding of the Saccharomyces protein Sec14p correspond to the stretches 96–100, 105–115, 140–145, and 170–180 of p50RhoGAP (19Aravind L. Neuwald A.F. Ponting C.P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 195-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 2) the sequence between amino acids 135–170 shows weak homology to an immunoglobulin domain and in some proteins (e.g. Rho-guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor, Trio) an Ig domain was shown to interact with the prenyl group (20Hoffman G.R. Nassar N. Cerione R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 21Medley Q.G. Serra-Pages C. Iannott E. Seipel K. Tang M. O'Brien S.P. Streuli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36116-36123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, we prepared GST fusion proteins starting at amino acid 86, 121, or 169 (Fig. 1B). In the GAP assay all of these fragments behaved similarly to 49GAP (Table III). The fact that they were less effective than fragment 198GAP in stimulating GTP hydrolysis on non-prenylated Rac, indicates that amino acids 169–197 play a role in the interaction of p50RhoGAP with prenylated small GTPases. On the other hand, truncation of the molecule beyond the fragment 198GAP did not improve its reaction with non-prenylated Rac1 (data not shown). Thus, our GAP assays provided the information that two different parts of the p50RhoGAP molecule, namely the N-terminal 48 amino acids and the stretch between amino acids 169 and 197 at the C-terminal end of the Sec14 domain, are involved in the structural changes induced by prenylated Rac1. It should be remarked, that the above fragments of p50RhoGAP gave identical reactions with non-prenylated RhoA and Cdc42 as detailed for Rac1 (data not shown).Table IIIEffect of different fragments of p50RhoGAP on the GTP hydrolysis rate of Rac1ControlFull-length GAP49GAP86GAP121GAP169GAP198GAPnpRac81.6 ± 1.458.5 ± 3.144.4 ± 1.644.6 ± 2.444.2 ± 3.841.8 ± 2.713.1 ± 1.5pRac69.2 ± 4.724.0 ± 2.426.6 ± 4.325 ± 2.927.5 ± 5.229.5 ± 5.124.1 ± 0.9 Open table in a new tab Effect of p50RhoGAP Fragments on the Activation of NADPH Oxidase—We wanted to substantiate the results obtained in the GAP assay in a functional test where participation of the GTP-bound form of Rac is decisive. The NADPH oxidase of phagocytic cells is a multisubunit enzyme (for review see Ref. 22Vignais P.V. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1428-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), the assembly and catalytic activity of which depends on the prevalence of Rac in the GTP-bound active form (23Moskwa P. Dagher M.C. Paclet M.H. Morel F. Ligeti E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10710-10716Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We applied the fully purified version of the cell-free activation system of this enzyme, consisting of purified and relipidated cytochrome b558 and recombinant p47phox, p67phox, and GTP-loaded prenylated or non-prenylated Rac (Fig. 4). In our earlier experiments (7Geiszt M. Dagher M.C. Molnár G. Havasi A. Fauré J. Paclet M.H. Morel F. Ligeti E. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 851-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we showed that this system does not contain any GAP activity, allowing a high rate of O2·¯ production in the presence of GTP (Fig. 4, control) that is independent of the prenylation state of Rac (Fig. 4, compare A with B). The addition of full-length p50RhoGAP to the activation system reduced the rate of O2·¯ production, indicating the GTPase-activating effect on Rac. When non-prenylated Rac was used, 49GAP was more effective than the full-length p50RhoGAP, and the isolated GAP domain was more effective than 49GAP (Fig. 4A). The fragments 86GAP, 121GAP, and 169GAP behaved again similar to 49GAP. In contrast, in the case of prenylated Rac, all the different fragments of p50RhoGAP had the same efficiency (Fig. 4B). Thus, the results indicating the activity of RacGTP in a complex enzymatic system fully support the data obtained in the GAP assay. The crystal structure of the GAP domain of p50RhoGAP has been resolved both in uncomplexed state (24Barrett T. Xiao B. Dodson E.J. Dodson G. Ludbrook S.B. Nurmahomed K. Gamblin S.J. Musacchio A. Smerdon S.J. Eccleston J.F. Nature. 1997; 385: 458-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and in complex with Cdc42Hs-GMPPNP, representing the ground state of the small GTPase (25Rittinger K. Walker P.A. Eccleston J.F. Nurmahomed K. Owen D. Laue E. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Nature. 1997; 388: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and with Rho-GDPAlF4, representing the transition state during hydrolysis of GTP (26Rittinger K. Walker P.A. Eccleston J.F. Smerdon S.J. Gamblin S.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). These studies clearly showed the decisive role of Arg-85 of the GAP domain as in the transition state it participates in the active site of the small GTPase. However, these studies were carried out with the isolated GAP domain (fragment 198–439) and with small GTPases expressed as GST fusion proteins in E. coli, thus, without the posttranslational modifications typical for expression in eukaryotic cells, isoprenylation, truncation, and methylation (4Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the S. cerevisiae phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (Sec14) is also available (27Sha B. Phillips S.E. Bankaitis V.A. Luo M. Nature. 1998; 391: 506-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), and this protein shows sequence homology with the N-terminal part of p50RhoGAP. However, at present there is no structural information either on the relation of the two parts of the p50RhoGAP molecule or on the possible role of the prenyl group in the interaction with its substrate, although in the cellular milieu the true interacting partners are full-length p50RhoGAP and prenylated small GTPases. To our knowledge this is the first study trying to decipher on a functional basis the possible intramolecular interactions within p50RhoGAP and its relation to the prenylated small GTPase. Data obtained in the yeast two-hybrid system revealed an important role of the N-terminal 48 amino acids of p50RhoGAP both in establishing intramolecular interaction with the C-terminal GAP domain (Table I) and in the stable interaction with Rac (Table II). Furthermore, the two-hybrid experiments indicated that the positive interaction between Rac and p50RhoGAP depends also on the prenyl moiety of the small GTPase (Fig. 2). Based on these data we carried out a direct investigation of the role of the N-terminal 48 amino acids in GAP assays, which fully supported the results of the two-hybrid study. The removal of the N-terminal 48 amino acids increases the GTPase-activating action of p50RhoGAP on non-prenylated Rac (and Rho and Cdc42), whereas it does not influence the effect upon prenylated Rac (Fig. 3). The same observation was made in the activation of NADPH oxidase, a complex enzymatic reaction that depends on the prevalence of Rac in the GTP-bound form (Fig. 4). Thus, the first 48 amino acids of p50RhoGAP play a critical role in recognition of the prenyl moiety and increasing the accessibility of the GAP domain to prenylated small GTPase. However, some findings suggest that the removal of the N-terminal 48 amino acids does not interrupt the intramolecular interactions within the p50RhoGAP molecule completely. 1) In the two-hybrid system, positive interaction with the isolated GAP domain required also the contribution of amino acids on the C-terminal end of the Sec14 domain (Table I). 2) Both the GAP assay and the NADPH oxidase test indicated that the removal of amino acids 169–197 resulted in a further increase of the GAP activity of the relevant fragment on the non-prenylated GTPases whereas no change was observed in the reaction with prenylated Rac (Figs. 3 and 4). Apparently, this stretch of amino acids is also involved in recognition of the prenyl moiety. On the basis of our experimental data we propose the model presented in Fig. 5. In the basic state p50RhoGAP is in a closed conformation, where the N-terminal 48 amino acids and the stretch 169–197 at the C-terminal end of the Sec14 domain are involved in the intramolecular interaction restricting the accessibility of the GAP domain. The prenylated small GTPase is able to release the intramolecular restraint and to bring the protein into a more open conformation. In this state the essential amino acid(s) of the GAP domain have free access to the active site of the small GTPase. The following experimental findings indicate that the prenyl group by itself is not sufficient for releasing the autoinhibited state. 1) Soluble geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate is not able to replace the prenyl tail covalently attached to the small GTPase, and 2) prenylated wild-type Rac1 or Rac2 is not able to interact with p50RhoGAP in the two-hybrid system. The proposed model provides another example that the prenyl moiety of the small GTPase plays a significant role not only in the localization of the molecule to hydrophobic surfaces, but also in the interaction with certain proteins (20Hoffman G.R. Nassar N. Cerione R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 21Medley Q.G. Serra-Pages C. Iannott E. Seipel K. Tang M. O'Brien S.P. Streuli M.

Suggesting an intramolecular interaction as means of regulation of the activity of a GAP protein is not unprecedented. In the case of p120RasGAP, the N-terminal PH domain was suggested to bind to the C-terminal catalytic domain and inhibit the GAP action of the latter (31Drugan J.K. Rogers-Graham K. Gilmer T. Campbell S. Clark G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35021-35027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Also for the Rho/Rac/Cdc42GAP oligophrenin-1 it has been recently shown that the N-terminal part of the molecule inhibits its RhoGAP activity in fibroblasts (32Fauchereau F. Herbrand U. Chafey P. Eberth A. Koulakoff A. Vinet M.C. Ahmadian M.R. Chelly J. Billuart P. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 574-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In in vitro studies, we had similar indications for p190RhoGAP (11Molnar G. Dagher M.C. Geiszt M. Settleman J. Ligeti E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10542-10549Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Autoinhibition released by the small GTPase is a common phenomenon among the targets of different Rho family proteins (33Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar, 34Kim A.S. Kakalis L.T. Abdul-Manan N. Liu G.A. Rosen M.K. Nature. 2000; 404: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Recent data also indicate that multiple domains of the effector protein and regions of the GTPase outside of the classical switch I and II are involved in the interaction of Rho family GTPases with their target proteins (35Blumenstein L. Ahmadian M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53419-53426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Further studies have to decide the similarities in the reaction of small GTPases with their target versus regulatory proteins and, also, how widespread autoinhibition is among GAPs for different subfamilies of the small GTPases. Our studies call attention to the prenyl moiety as a possible additional region of the interaction between small GTPases and their relevant GAPs.

These interactions may be mimicked in vitro by the assembly and disassembly of clathrin “baskets.” The chimera C58J is a minimal construct capable of supporting both reactions; it consists of the C58 moiety of AP180, which facilitates clathrin assembly, fused with the J domain of auxilin, which recruits Hsc70 to baskets. We studied the process of disassembly by using cryo-electron microscopy to identify the initial binding site of Hsc70 on clathrin-C58J baskets at pH 6, under which conditions disassembly does not proceed further. Hsc70 interactions involve two sites: (i) its major interaction is with the sides of spars of the clathrin lattice, close to the triskelion hubs and (ii) there is another interaction at a site at the N-terminal hooks of the clathrin heavy chains, presumably via the J domain of C58J. We propose that individual triskelions may be extricated from the clathrin lattice by the concerted action of up to six Hsc70 molecules, which intercalate between clathrin leg segments, prying them apart.

Three Hsc70s remain bound to the dissociated triskelion, close to its trimerization hub. One of the major endocytic pathways occurs through formation of vesicles coated with lattices of polymerized clathrin triskelions (1Kirchhausen T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 699-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 2Brodsky F.M. Chen C.Y. Knuehl C. Towler M.C. Wakeham D.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

The ability of these lattices to form curved structures deforms the membrane, possibly in concert with proteins that directly induce membrane curvature (4Ford M.G. Mills I.G. Peter B.J. Vallis Y. Praefcke G.J. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Nature. 2002; 419: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar), leading to the formation of coated pits and ultimately their pinching off into coated vesicles. Clathrin is then released from these particles in an ATP-dependent process prior to the vesicles fusing with endosomes. In vitro, in the presence of assembly proteins (APs), 1The abbreviations used are: AP, assembly protein; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; EM, electron microscopy; FSC, Fourier shell correlation; CTF, contrast transfer function. 1The abbreviations used are: AP, assembly protein; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; EM, electron microscopy; FSC, Fourier shell correlation; CTF, contrast transfer function. clathrin assembles into membrane-free baskets whose closed clathrin lattices are similar to, albeit mostly smaller than, those that assemble on coated vesicles in vivo.The formation and dissociation of clathrin coats is a dynamic process that is regulated by a variety of factors. Of these, the ATP-binding molecular chaperone, Hsc70, is intimately involved in uncoating (5Greener T. Grant B. Zhang Y. Wu X. Greene L.E. Hirsh D. Eisenberg E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 6Morgan J.R. Prasad K. Jin S. Augustine G.J. Lafer E.M.

Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, Hsc70 does not work alone; it requires a J domain protein such as auxilin that interacts with both the clathrin N termini and, through its J domain, with Hsc70, and presents the Hsc70 to the clathrin lattice (8Ungewickell E. Ungewickell H. Holstein S.E. Lindner R. Prasad K. Barouch W. Martin B. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Nature. 1995; 378: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). After binding to the clathrin lattice, Hsc70 dislodges triskelions in a reaction that is accompanied by ATP hydrolysis. In vitro, Hsc70 binds to clathrin-AP baskets complexed with catalytic amounts of auxilin and causes the dissociation of triskelions at neutral pH. It seemed possible that any AP binding to the clathrin N terminus and carrying the auxilin J domain would be able to facilitate uncoating by Hsc70, and this property was demonstrated for a chimera called C58J (9Ma Y. Greener T. Pacold M.E. Kaushal S. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49267-49274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This construct, consisting of C58, the 58-kDa C-terminal clathrin-binding domain of AP180, and the auxilin J domain was shown to support uncoating by Hsc70, although C58J acted stoichiometrically, whereas auxilin acts catalytically.The complex released by Hsc70 from the coated vesicle or clathrin-AP basket is thought to be composed of one clathrin triskelion, three Hsc70 molecules, and one or more APs (10Jiang R. Gao B. Prasad K. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8439-8447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It has been reported from quick freeze/deep etch EM studies of dissociated clathrin triskelions (11Heuser J. Steer C.J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1457-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 12Barouch W. Prasad K. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28563-28568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that Hsc70 molecules are attached close to the trimerization hub where the C termini of the clathrin heavy chains reside. Biochemical data suggest that auxilin binds to the clathrin heavy chain N terminus and distal leg domain (13Scheele U. Alves J. Frank R. Duwel M. Kalthoff C. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25357-25368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).Clathrin baskets occur in many forms, some with defined symmetry (14Crowther R.A. Finch J.T. Pearse B.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 103: 785-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 15Tarnai T. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 485-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This polymorphism reflects structural adaptability in vivo whereby clathrin coats may envelope vesicles of various sizes. One of the most abundant forms of basket is the D6 barrel, whose structure has been reconstructed from cryo-electron micrographs for several variants (16Vigers G.P. Crowther R.A. Pearse B.M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2079-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 17Smith C.J. Grigorieff N. Pearse B.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4943-4953Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 18Smith C.J.

This basket consists of a lattice of open hexagons and pentagons in which the 3-fold vertices are connected by 225-Å-long spars. A clathrin triskelion is centered on each vertex. The triskelion has three legs, each with three segments (19Kocsis E. Trus B.L. Steer C.J. Bisher M.E. Steven A.C. J. Struct. Biol. 1991; 107: 6-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar): a (hub)proximal part, a distal part, and a terminal region representing the N terminus. Each spar is a bundle of two oppositely directed proximal leg segments and two distal segments (20Crowther R.A. Pearse B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The adaptor protein AP-2 (17Smith C.J. Grigorieff N. Pearse B.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4943-4953Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and auxilin (18Smith C.J. Dafforn T.R. Kent H. Sims C.A. Khubchandani-Aswani K. Zhang L. Saibil H.R. Pearse B.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) have been located inside the barrel, contacting the clathrin heavy chain N termini.Clathrin may be assembled into baskets with C58J acting as an AP, and Hsc70 can bind to these baskets at pH 6.0 without uncoating (9Ma Y. Greener T. Pacold M.E. Kaushal S. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49267-49274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This mode of binding most likely represents the first step in the uncoating pathway because this reaction proceeds upon shifting to pH 7.0. To identify the Hsc70 binding site, we have visualized clathrin-C58J baskets with and without bound Hsc70 at pH 6.0. The consistent result was the presence of Hsc70 as diffuse rings of density in the polygonal faces of the clathrin lattice, making closest contact with the spars close to the vertex. This placement allows Hsc70 to interact with the triskelion hub, subsequently destabilizing the interactions between leg segments to mediate uncoating.MATERIALS AND METHODSPreparation of Proteins—C58J constructs were cloned into 6-histidine pQE30 vector, expressed, and purified as described (9Ma Y. Greener T. Pacold M.E. Kaushal S. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49267-49274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Hsc70 was prepared from bovine brains (21Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6682-6687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Clathrin was extracted from coated vesicles using 0.5 m Tris, pH 7.0, as described (20Crowther R.A. Pearse B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Clathrin-C58J baskets were made by overnight dialysis against 0.1 m MES, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 6.5. After centrifugation for 1 h at 150,000 × g, the pellet was suspended in buffer A consisting of 20 mm MES, pH 6.0, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol. The concentration of triskelions in clathrin-C58J baskets was determined from absorbance after solubilizing the baskets with 0.5 m Tris, pH 8.0. The binding of Hsc70 to clathrin-C58J baskets was performed in buffer A by incubating either 0.9 μm (stoichiometric) or 3 μm (excess) Hsc70 with 0.3 μm triskelions in the presence of 1 mm ATP and an ATP-regenerating system consisting of 30 units/ml creatine phosphokinase and 15 mm phosphocreatine.Cryo-electron Microscopy—3-μl samples at 1–3 mg/ml protein were applied for 10 min to grids bearing holey carbon films, blotted, quenched, and observed in a CM200-field emission gun (FEG) electron microscope (FEI, Mahwah, NJ) equipped with a model 626 cryo-holder (Gatan, Pleasanton, CA). Grids were searched at low magnification using a CCD camera, and micrographs were recorded on film, using low dose procedures and a magnification of 38,000×.Image Processing—Negatives were scanned with a SCAI scanner (Z/I Imaging, Huntsville, AL) and binned 3-fold to give 5.53 Å pixels. Micrographs typically contained 100–300 usable particles, which were extracted with the program X3D preprocess (22Conway J.F. Trus B.L. Booy F.P. Newcomb W.W. Brown J.C. Steven A.C. J. Struct. Biol. 1993; 111: 222-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) or the program bshow from the Bsoft package (23Heymann J.B. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 133: 156-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Defocus values determined in bshow ranged from 1.3 to 7.0 μm (first CTF zeros at 21–48 Å). CTF effects were corrected by simply flipping the phases in alternate lobes of the CTF with the program bctf (23Heymann J.B. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 133: 156-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar).Reconstructions were calculated by an iterative projection matching approach. For an initial model of the clathrin-C58J D6 barrel, a stick model was constructed, with a vertex-to-vertex length of 225 Å (3Marsh M. McMahon H.T. Science. 1999; 285: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Particle orientations and origins were determined with the programs PFT (24Baker T.S. Cheng R.H. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 120-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) and EMAN (25Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2099) Google Scholar). Final orientations were determined with PFT2 (a modified version of EMPFT interfacing with Bsoft), and reconstructions were done with the program breconstruct (23Heymann J.B. J. Struct.

This final model was used as starting model to determine particle image orientations for Hsc70-loaded baskets, whose final reconstruction was made after several rounds of orientation determination.The hand of the D6 basket was determined by the method of Belnap et al. (26Belnap D.M. Olson N.H. Baker T.S. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 120: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Images of the same particles were recorded at tilt angles of 0° and -5°, and a reconstruction was computed from the 0° images. Projections corresponding to the -5° views were computed from maps with both of the possible hands for each particle, using their Euler angles and the known position of the tilt axis. These projections were then compared with the -5° EM images by calculating the cross-correlation coefficient in each case.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONOur goal was to observe assembly-regulating proteins bound to clathrin baskets by cryo-EM. In two previous studies of this kind, with AP2 (17Smith C.J. Grigorieff N. Pearse B.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4943-4953Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) or auxilin (18Smith C.J. Dafforn T.R. Kent H. Sims C.A. Khubchandani-Aswani K. Zhang L. Saibil H.R. Pearse B.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), the interpretability of the results was limited by the presence of thick-walled inner shells in which individual subunits could not be distinguished. In an attempt to avoid this problem, we decided to use C58J as both an assembly protein and a J domain protein. C58J is relatively small, compared with AP180 and AP-2. Moreover, it is likely to be a good model for auxilin activity in the initial steps of uncoating because the two proteins behave identically in inducing the binding of Hsc70 to baskets, with or without APs, at pH 6.0 (9Ma Y. Greener T. Pacold M.E. Kaushal S. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49267-49274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Cryo-micrographs of Baskets with and without Hsc70 — Clathrin-C58J baskets were assembled at pH 6.0 and examined by cryo-EM (Fig. 1A). As expected, these populations were polymorphic, exhibiting a variety of sizes and shapes. Initial binding experiments in which equimolar amounts of Hsc70 were added yielded baskets that, by visual criteria, differed little from those without Hsc70 (data not shown). When the experiments were repeated using a 3-fold excess of Hsc70 (Fig. 1B), the shells of the baskets appeared to have been systematically thickened. The vertices and spars that are often visible as punctate features and striations in cryo-micrographs of Hsc70-free baskets were blurred. However, the periphery appeared to be as sharply defined in both cases. These observations suggest that Hsc70 binds to clathrin shells but protrudes little if at all beyond their outer margins.Image Reconstruction and Determination of Hand—The D6 barrel is a relatively abundant assembly form that has been analyzed in previous studies, and we also focused on these particles. Composed of 36 triskelions, the barrel has 12 pentagonal and 8 hexagonal faces, and exhibits 6-2-2 point group symmetry. To calculate three-dimensional reconstructions, we followed an iterative projection matching approach. To start the calculation, we generated a stick model. As data, we selected all particles of approximately the right size, anticipating that particles of similar size but different symmetry or with imperfect D6 symmetry would fail to achieve high correlation coefficients during the subsequent analysis and would be screened out for that reason.Although the initial model did not have any handedness, handedness gradually became evident after several rounds of reconstruction. However, there remained an ambiguity as to the absolute hand, i.e. both the model obtained and its mirror image were equally compatible with the data. To resolve this ambiguity, we employed a method that involves recording tilt pair micrographs (26Belnap D.M. Olson N.H. Baker T.S. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 120: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Tilting the models (both enantiomorphs) through the same angle produces differing projections that may be matched with the experimental tilted image, with better agreement for the correct hand. The correlation coefficients obtained for the correct versus incorrect hand were 0.35 (± 0.12) and 0.10 (± 0.07), respectively (n = 107). This result confirmed the hand that has been assigned in previous studies, although we are not aware of this property having been determined before.As noted above, micrographs of clathrin-C58J baskets to which equimolar Hsc70 had been added differed little from those without Hsc70. Nevertheless, reconstruction produced a model with faint rings of density inset in its polygonal faces. Repeated rounds of erasing these densities before feeding the map into the next cycle yielded a reconstruction very similar to the basket with no Hsc70 (the latter data are not shown), with no densities in the polygonal faces. We infer that our filtering procedure selected particles with little or no Hsc70 from a mixed population. The assumption that Hsc70 binding to clathrin is not saturated under these conditions is consistent with earlier binding studies (12Barouch W. Prasad K. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28563-28568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showing that three Hsc70s bind per clathrin triskelion. Because this map is of slightly higher resolution, we used it as our reference structure, lacking Hsc70 (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2Reconstructions of clathrin baskets prepared in the presence of C58J (A and C) and C58J with an excess of Hsc70 (B and D).

Harrison S.C. Kirchhausen T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1096-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), binds to the N terminus of clathrin, which contributes prominent hook-like features that cluster in rings and are connected to the outer framework of the clathrin shell (Fig. 2, A and C). Docked into the hooks of our density map, the atomic model for this portion of clathrin (28ter Haar E. Musacchio A. Harrison S.C. Kirchhausen T. Cell. 1998; 95: 563-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) was well accommodated but left unoccupied density that we assign to (part of) C58J (Fig. 3, arrows). This conclusion is consistent with the results of Musacchio et al. (29Musacchio A. Smith C.J. Roseman A.M. Harrison S.C. Kirchhausen T. Pearse B.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 761-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and Smith et al. (18Smith C.J. Dafforn T.R. Kent H. Sims C.A. Khubchandani-Aswani K. Zhang L. Saibil H.R. Pearse B.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), who fitted the N terminus into baskets assembled with AP-2 and auxilin, respectively. The latter reconstructions contained inner shells of largely undifferentiated density that were inferred to account for the bulk of these accessory molecules, on whose surface the clathrin-interacting domains were exposed. This interpretation is supported by the absence of such an inner shell from our density maps (Figs. 3 and 4), correlating with the absence of the remainder of AP-2 and auxilin, respectively. It follows that the C58 domains organize the N termini into rings and in this role are not dependent on interactions among the remaining portions of APs or auxilin, i.e. the inner shells of density seen in the earlier reconstructions.Fig. 3The atomic structure of the clathrin heavy chain N terminus and part of the distal domain (28ter Haar E.

The density in these rings, around the 5-fold axis and the local and global 6-fold axes, is not differentiated into discreet features that we might equate with Hsc70 molecules. Moreover, this density is lower (∼50%) than that of clathrin. This property accounts for the fact that the rings do not appear to make contact with the clathrin shell, when represented by isodensity surface rendering (as in Fig. 2B). However, the Hsc70-associated density is evident upon comparing gray level sections through the respective maps (Fig. 4). This density appears to coat each spar on either side (arrows in Fig. 4, A and B), making closest contact near the hub (arrows in Figs. 2B and 4, C and D). The Hsc70 molecules also contact well defined underlying density (arrows in Fig. 4, F and G) that we associate with C58J molecules bound to clathrin N termini (see above). Given the role of J domains in Hsc70 recruitment, it is probably this interaction that is visualized. It appears, then, that Hsc70 binding involves two interactions: (i) it binds to a J domain associated with the N terminus of one (or two) clathrin heavy chains and (ii) it also engages the side of a spar, near a hub, where it binds to a proximal leg and a distal leg of two other clathrin molecules. Because there are insufficient C58Js to accommodate all the Hsc70s (see below), we infer that, after their recruitment, some Hsc70s relax or are displaced from the first interaction while retaining interaction or adjusting their interaction with the clathrin lattice.How to explain the observed Hsc70-associated density as continuous rings? In principle, such a distribution might arise from steric interference whereby an Hsc70 molecule, once bound, blocks binding at an adjacent position. If binding sites were to be occupied at random, the resulting averaged density distribution would show an apparent fusing of molecules at adjacent, mutually exclusive, positions and reduced density compared with clathrin. However, because Hsc70 is a globular monomer of 6–8 nm in diameter (11Heuser J. Steer C.J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1457-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), there should be enough space in the polygonal faces for full occupancy, and our resolution is well sufficient to resolve subunits of this size. Alternative explanations are that there is more than one binding site on the side of a spar or the attachment site is mobile. There is, in fact, prior evidence for multiple binding sites for Hsc70 on clathrin (30Schmid S.L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10050-10056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and if two distinct and mutually exclusive sites were to be partially occupied, the observed smearing of Hsc70-related density would be expected to occur.Although we cannot rule out the possibility that occupancy of Hsc70 molecules was reduced somewhat when samples were prepared for cryo-EM, the most plausible explanation for the lower level of Hsc-related density compared with clathrin density is the presence of two or more mutually interfering Hsc70 binding sites. Notwithstanding this complication, the data sufficed to identify the predominant points of contact with the clathrin lattice (Fig. 4, arrows).Resolution—The resolution of the three density maps was assessed in terms of the Fourier shell correlation coefficient (FSC) criterion (Table I). To facilitate comparison with earlier studies, we list resolutions for three thresholds. The most conservative threshold is 0.5. By this standard, the resolution of our clathrin-C58J barrel is 28 Å, which compares with 36 Å achieved for the clathrin-auxilin barrel (18Smith C.J. Dafforn T.R. Kent H. Sims C.A. Khubchandani-Aswani K. Zhang L. Saibil H.R. Pearse B.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The least conservative criterion corresponds to the FSC remaining above three times the theoretical noise limit (adjusted for 12-fold symmetry): according to it, the resolution of clathrin-C58J barrel is 23 Å, which is comparable with the 21 Å of the clathrin-AP2 map (17Smith C.J.

However, the results were not easily interpretable. On closer examination it turned out that the basket with Hsc70 bound has a slightly different axial ratio, arising from a slight shortening (by ∼20 Å), with an increase in width of ∼10 Å, i.e. Hsc70 binding effects a global distortion of the basket lattice. Accordingly, we based our localization on side-by-side comparison of the Hsc70-bound structure and the control.Binding Stoichiometries—Like AP180 (31Prasad K. Lippoldt R.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6098-6104Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), C58J binds with a stoichiometry of one molecule/clathrin triskelion, in contrast to auxilin, which binds with a stoichiometry of three molecules/triskelion. The parts of both auxilin and AP180 that bind to clathrin appear to be extended with little regular secondary structure (13Scheele U. Alves J. Frank R. Duwel M. Kalthoff C. Ungewickell E. J. Biol.

Prion proteins (PrP) were analyzed for their proteinase K resistance in immunoblots and for their infectivity in hamster bioassays. A notable decrease in the proteinase K resistance of unpurified prion proteins, probably because of pressure-induced changes in the protein conformation of native PrP<sup>Sc</sup> or the <i>N</i>-truncated PrP-(27–30), could be demonstrated when pressurized at initially neutral conditions in several buffers and in water but not in a slightly acidic pH. A subsequent 6–7 log<sub>10</sub> reduction of infectious units/g in phosphate-buffered saline buffer, pH 7.4, was found. The proteinase K-resistant core was also not detectable after purification of prions extracted from pressurized samples, confirming pressure effects at the level of the secondary structure of prion proteins. However, opposite results were found after pressurizing purified prions, arguing for the existence of pressure-sensitive β-structures (PrP<sup>Sc</sup><sub>ΔPsen</sub>) and extremely pressure-resistant β-structures (PrP<sup>Sc</sup><sub>ΔPres</sub>). Remarkably, after the first centrifugation step at 540,000 × <i>g</i> during isolation, prions remained proteinase K-resistant when pressurized in all tested buffers and in water.

In yeast, LCBPs are synthesized mainly by the long-chain base kinase Lcb4p. Until now, the regulatory mechanism for Lcb4p has been unclear. In the present study, we found that Lcb4p is post-translationally modified by phosphorylation. Using a protein kinase mutant yeast collection, we further demonstrated that the cyclin-dependent kinase Pho85p is involved in this phosphorylation. Pho85p functions in a number of cellular processes, especially in response to environmental changes. Two of 10 Pho85p cyclins, Pcl1p and Pcl2p had overlapping functions in the phosphorylation of Lcb4p. Site-directed mutagenesis identified the phosphorylation sites in Lcb4p as Ser451 and Ser455. Additionally, pulse-chase experiments revealed that Lcb4p is degraded via the ubiquitin-dependent pathway. The protein was stabilized in Δpho85 cells, suggesting that phosphorylation acts as a signal for the degradation. Lcb4p is down-regulated in the stationary phase of cell growth, and both phosphorylation and ubiquitination appear to be important for this process. Moreover, we demonstrated that Lcb4p is delivered to the vacuole for degradation via the multivesicular body. Since forced accumulation of LCBPs results in prolonged growth during the stationary phase, down-regulation of Lcb4p may be physiologically important for proper cellular responses to nutrient deprivation.

Sphingosine kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of sphingosine to form sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). 1The abbreviations used are: S1P, sphingosine 1-phosphate; LCBP, long-chain base 1-phosphate; LCB, long-chain base; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; MVB, multivesicular body; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; Vps, vacuolar protein sorting; HA, hemagglutinin; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; ESCRT, endosomal sorting complexes required for transport; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase. In mammalian cells, S1P regulates diverse biological processes including proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis, both as an extracellular mediator and an intracellular second messenger (1Igarashi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 1080-1087Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 385-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 3Kluk M.J. Hla T. Biochim.

The extracellular effects of S1P are mediated via the S1P/Edg family of plasma membrane G-protein-coupled receptors, whereas its intracellular targets remain undetermined. To date, two sphingosine kinase isoforms, SPHK1 and SPHK2, have been identified. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not contain S1P, but, instead, contains two other long-chain base 1-phosphates (LCBPs), dihydrosphingosine 1-phosphate and phytosphingosine 1-phosphate. These LCBPs are synthesized by two long-chain base (LCB) kinases, Lcb4p and Lcb5p, which are homologous to the mammalian sphingosine kinases. Most of the LCB kinase activity is attributable to Lcb4p, since deletion of the LCB4 gene results in a drastic reduction in activity (to 3% of wild-type), yet deleting LCB5 has little effect (5Nagiec M.M.

Genetics. 2000; 156: 1519-1529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although the mechanisms involved are unknown. LCBPs appear to have a particular role in yeast cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase. Yeast cells grow in glucose-containing medium by utilizing the glucose through fermentation; however, if glucose becomes limited, the cells can utilize ethanol through respiration, a transition called the diauxic shift. After the postdiauxic phase, wild-type cells undergo G1 cell cycle arrest and enter into the stationary phase. However, Δdpl1 cells, which lack the lyase that metabolizes LCBP, resulting in its accumulation, exhibit a delay of the G1 arrest (13Gottlieb D. Heideman W. Saba J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 1999; 1: 66-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, mutants with diminished sphingosine kinase activity enter the stationary phase without apparent postdiauxic growth (14Lanterman M.M. Saba J.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Involvement of LCBPs in G1-to-S phase progression can also be inferred by the observation that Δlcb4 Δlcb5 cells have a defect in their ability to recover from G1 arrest caused by heat shock (11Jenkins G.M.

Reportedly, LCB kinase activity is low during early log phase, increases just before the diauxic shift, and then gradually decreases in the stationary phase (14Lanterman M.M. Saba J.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), although the mechanism involved in these changes remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the down-regulation of LCB kinase activity observed during the stationary phase is due to the degradation of Lcb4p. We further reveal the precise elements of this degradation pathway, including the phosphorylation of Lcb4p by Pho85 cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) and its subsequent ubiquitination, multivesicular body (MVB) sorting, and vacuolar degradation.

The Δpcl10::LEU2 cells were prepared by substituting the 0.15-kb HindIII-BglII region in the PCL10 gene with the LEU2 marker.Table IYeast strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceSEY6210MATα leu2-3,112 ura3-52 his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ901 lys2-801 suc2-Δ9Ref. 51Robinson J.S.

Plasmids—The yeast centromere-based (CEN) low copy number plasmid pRS313 (HIS3 marker) (23Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the 2 μ-based high copy number plasmid pRS423 (HIS3 marker) (24Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar) were used. To construct the pWK78 (LCB4, CEN, HIS3 marker) and the pWK79 (LCB4, 2 μ, HIS3 marker) plasmids, the LCB4 region was first amplified using genomic DNA prepared from SEY6210 cells and primers 5′-GGATCCCTTTGGACCAGAGCTGATTA-3′ and 5′-AAGCTTGACGCAACTTCCAAGTGAAT-3′. The amplified fragment was then cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega, Madison, WI) to generate pWK74. pWK78 and pWK79 were constructed by cloning the 3.0-kb BamHI-SalI fragment of pWK74 into the BamHI-SalI sites of pRS313 and pRS423, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis of LCB4 was carried out using the QuikChange™ kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with pWK78, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two complementary oligonucleotides for each mutant were employed. The sequences of the sense oligonucleotides were 5′-CGAACACTGTGAAGGTGACTCCCGATGATTCACAGG-3′ (S150A), 5′-CCGATGATTCACAGGATAACGCACCATCTTTAGG-3′ (S158A), 5′-CCTTCGAACCAAATCCTGCCCCAAACTCTTCGC-3′ (S451A), 5′-CCTAGCCCAAACTCTGCGCCGGATTTACTATC-3′ (S455A), 5′-CAGTACAAAAGATGAACTTGCACCGAATTTTCTCAACGAGGAC-3′ (S473A), and 5′-CCCAGTGACAAGAATGGCACCAATTTTATTATCCTTGG-3′ (T550A). The mutated nucleotides are underlined. The plasmid pUG34, a yeast expression vector constructed to produce a fusion protein with an N-terminal enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the control of the MET25 promoter, was a gift from J. H. Hegemann. To construct EGFP-tagged LCB4, the LCB4 region was amplified using the plasmid pWK78 and primers 5′-AAGGATCCGTGGTGCAGAAAAAACTTAGGGC-3′ and 5′-AAGCTTGACGCAACTTCCAAGTGAAT-3′. The amplified fragment was digested by BamHI and SalI and cloned into the BamHI-SalI site of pUG34 to generate pWK63.

Rabbit polyclonal anti-Lcb4p antibodies were raised against recombinant full-length Lcb4p proteins, expressed in Escherichia coli as hexahistidine-tagged fusion proteins and affinity-purified. These anti-Lcb4p antibodies, diluted at 1:1,000, were used as the primary antibodies for immunoblotting, and donkey anti-rabbit IgG, peroxidase-linked F(ab′)2 fragment (Amersham Biosciences), diluted at 1:10,000, was used as the secondary antibody. For immunoblotting ubiquitin, mouse monoclonal anti-Ub antibody (P4D1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), diluted at 1:1,000, were used as the primary antibody with sheep anti-mouse IgG, peroxidase-linked F(ab′)2 fragment (1:10,000; Amersham Biosciences) as the secondary antibody.

The adenine moiety of the nucleotide predominantly binds in a ring stacking arrangement equivalent to that observed in the x-ray structure of the homologue from Caenorhabditis elegans. The binding site is, however, markedly divergent to that observed in the plant/pathogenic bacteria class of enzymes, opening avenues for the exploration of specific therapeutics. Binding of ATP induces substantial conformational and dynamic changes that were not observed in the C. elegans structure. In contrast to the C. elegans homologue, important side chains that play a major role in substrate binding do not have to reorient to accommodate the ligand. This may have important implications in the mechanism of substrate recognition in this class of enzymes."

Enzymes from this family function in the shikimate pathway that is essential for survival of microorganisms and plants and represent potential drug targets. Recent YdiB and AroE crystal structures revealed the presence of a NAD(P)-binding and a catalytic domain. We carried out site-directed mutagenesis of 8 putative active site residues in YdiB from Escherichia coli and analyzed structural and kinetic properties of the mutant enzymes. Our data indicate critical roles for an invariant lysine and aspartate residue in substrate binding and allowed us to differentiate between two previously proposed models for the binding of the substrate in the active site. Comparison of several YdiB and AroE structures led us to conclude that, upon cofactor binding and domain closure, the 2 identified binding residues are repositioned to bind to the substrate. Although the lysine residue contributes to some extent to the stabilization of the transition state, we did not identify any residue as catalytically essential. This indicates that catalysis does not operate through a general acid-base mechanism, as thought originally. Our improved understanding of the medically and agriculturally important quinate/shikimate 5-dehydrogenase family at the molecular level may prove useful in the development of novel herbicides and antimicrobial agents.

Our improved understanding of the medically and agriculturally important quinate/shikimate 5-dehydrogenase family at the molecular level may prove useful in the development of novel herbicides and antimicrobial agents. The shikimate pathway of prokaryotes, fungi, plants, and apicomplexa is essential for survival. The main route of this pathway leads to the biosynthesis of chorismate, the precursor of essential aromatic compounds including vitamins and amino acids (Fig. 1) (1Herrmann K.M. Weaver L.M. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 473-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar, 2Knaggs A.R. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2003; 20: 119-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The successful targeting of the shikimate pathway in crop plants by glyphosate has spurred further efforts in herbicide development (3Coggins J.R. Abell C. Evans L.B. Frederickson M. Robinson D.A. Roszak A.W. Lapthorn A.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 548-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). More recently, the occurrence of herbicide-resistant weeds (4Baerson S.R. Rodriguez D.J. Tran M. Feng Y. Biest N.A. Dill G.M. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 1265-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) has led to the development of transgenic crops with increased glyphosate tolerance (5Carpenter J. Gianessi L.

Science. 2004; 304: 1151-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In bacteria, the shikimate pathway has been subject to metabolic engineering, aimed at the possible industrial production of high value hydroaromatic compounds (7Kra ̈mer M. Bongaerts J. Bovenberg R. Kremer S. Mu ̈ller U. Orf S. Wubbolts M. Raeven L. Metab. Eng. 2003; 5: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Lastly, their absence in metazoans makes the enzymes of the shikimate pathway potential targets for novel antimicrobial agents (3Coggins J.R. Abell C. Evans L.B. Frederickson M. Robinson D.A.

With a view to the design of inhibitors of the shikimate pathway, the understanding at the molecular level of enzymes involved in this pathway has received much attention over the last 25 years (3Coggins J.R. Abell C. Evans L.B. Frederickson M. Robinson D.A. Roszak A.W. Lapthorn A.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 548-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 11Brown K.A. Carpenter E.P. Watson K.A. Coggins J.R. Hawkins A.R. Koch M.H. Svergun D.I. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 543-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Step 4 of the pathway, the reversible NADPH-dependent reduction of 3-dehydroshikimate to shikimate (Fig. 2) is catalyzed by the enzyme shikimate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.25), a member of the quinate/shikimate 5-dehdrogenase family. In addition to the widely distributed bacterial NADP-dependent shikimate dehydrogenase AroE, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae also possess a paralogous enzyme, YdiB. YdiB from E. coli is a dual specificity quinate/shikimate NAD-dependent dehydrogenase, and its possible evolution and metabolic role have been discussed recently (12Michel G. Roszak A.W. Sauve V. Maclean J. Matte A. Coggins J.R. Cygler M. Lapthorn A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19463-19472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Although the involvement of AroE in the shikimate pathway is well established for E. coli and S. typhimurium (13Pittard J. Wallace B.J. J. Bacteriol. 1966; 91: 1494-1508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the actual biological function of YdiB remains unclear, nor is it known whether 3-dehydroshikimate or quinate represents the natural substrate of YdiB. Nevertheless, the YdiB enzymes from S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae were recently shown to be essential for in vitro growth of these human pathogens (14Zalacain M. Biswas S. Ingraham K.A. Ambrad J. Bryant A. Chalker A.F. Iordanescu S. Fan J. Fan F. Lunsford R.D. O'Dwyer K. Palmer L.M. So C. Sylvester D. Volker C. Warren P. McDevitt D. Brown J.R. Holmes D.J. Burnham M.K. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2004; 6: 109-126Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A similar occurrence of two family members is also found in filamentous fungi. In addition to a NADP-dependent shikimate dehydrogenase, they possess a related enzyme, quinate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.24), that catalyzes the NAD-dependent oxidation of quinate. This is the first step of the quinate pathway (Fig. 1), which affords growth on quinate as a carbon source (15Hawkins A.R. Lamb H.K. Moore J.D. Charles I.G. Roberts C.F. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 2891-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In fungi (16Hua S. Guo T. Gough J. Sun Z. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and the apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii (17Campbell S.A. Richards T.A. Mui E.J. Samuel B.U. Coggins J.R. McLeod R. Roberts C.W. Int. J. Parasitol. 2004; 34: 5-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the NADP-dependent shikimate dehydrogenase constitutes the C-terminal module of a penta-functional polypeptide, which combines the enzymatic activities for steps 2–6 of the shikimate pathway (Fig. 1). In plants (18Schmid J. Amrhein N. Phytochemistry. 1995; 39: 737-749Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and bacteria from the genus Chlamydia, this enzyme forms the C-terminal module of a bifunctional polypeptide catalyzing steps 3 and 4. Most bacterial shikimate dehydrogenases, and the fungal quinate-oxidizing dehydrogenases, on the other hand, represent monofunctional enzymes of 29–36 kDa. Few studies have been performed on the kinetic or chemical mechanism of catalysis for this family of enzymes. For the shikimate dehydrogenase from Pisum sativum, it has been shown that the kinetic mechanism is ordered Bi Bi in both directions, with the cofactor adding first (19Balinsky D. Dennis A.W. Cleland W.W. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 1947-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As additionally demonstrated for the shikimate dehydrogenase from E. coli (20Dansette P. Azerad R. Biochimie (Paris). 1974; 56: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), the mechanism involves the stereoselective transfer of hydrogen between the A side of NADPH and the substrate (19Balinsky D. Dennis A.W. Cleland W.W. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 1947-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).

This portion of the protein possesses a unique α-β-α sandwich motif, which also includes an α-helical hairpin structure at the C terminus of the protein and is further referred to as domain 1. The intervening sequence, domain 2, forms a Rossmann fold, to which the dinucleotide cofactor is bound with the A side of the nicotinamide ring facing the interdomain cleft (12Michel G. Roszak A.W.

A direct comparison of the cofactor complexes for the two E. coli enzymes AroE and YdiB by Michel et al. (12Michel G. Roszak A.W. Sauve V. Maclean J. Matte A. Coggins J.R. Cygler M. Lapthorn A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19463-19472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) revealed structural differences in their nucleotide-binding motifs, which likely account for the 10-fold higher affinity of YdiB for NAD than for NADP. In contrast to E. coli YdiB, AroE enzymes are generally NADP-specific. Despite the recent availability of several crystal structures for enzyme-cofactor complexes, as well as for apoenzymes of quinate/shikimate 5-dehydrogenases, no structural data on substrate binding are yet available, and so the nature of the active site in this agriculturally and medically important enzyme family has remained ambiguous. The active site is identified by the position of the nicotinamide moiety and appears to be defined by a conserved cluster of residues from domain 1 (12Michel G. Roszak A.W. Sauve V. Maclean J.

We carried out mutational analyses of 8 putative active site residues from domain 1 in YdiB from E. coli, exhausting all apparent candidate residues for catalysis. A conserved asparagine proved to be essential for proper folding. In addition to structural characterization and steady state kinetics, comparison of the mutated residues in different YdiB and AroE crystal structures supports roles for an invariant aspartate and lysine residue in substrate binding. Surprisingly, none of the mutated residues was essential for catalysis, suggesting that the primary catalytic mechanism does not involve general acid-base catalysis. Preparation and Characterization of YdiB Mutants—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the plasmid containing the ydiB gene (12Michel G. Roszak A.W. Sauve V. Maclean J. Matte A. Coggins J.R.

Forward versions of the mutagenic primers are listed in Table I. The sequences of the mutant ydiB genes were confirmed by DNA sequencing. YdiB enzymes were overexpressed and purified as described previously for wild-type protein (12Michel G. Roszak A.W. Sauve V. Maclean J. Matte A. Coggins J.R. Cygler M. Lapthorn A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19463-19472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories) based on the original Bradford assay (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Mass spectra were recorded using an Agilent 1100 Series liquid chromatograph/mass selective detector instrument (Agilent Technologies, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) in electrospray ionization mode and analyzed using Agilent ChemStation software (version A.09.01). A sample of purified YdiB protein (0.1–0.2 mg/ml) was diluted 1:100 (v/v) in 10% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) formic acid prior to injection. For native PAGE, proteins were analyzed using a 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel (375 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.8) containing 8.7% (v/v) glycerol. After the addition of one equal volume of 2× loading buffer (125 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 10 μg/ml bromphenol blue), 3 μg of protein were loaded per lane. Electrophoresis was performed at 125 mA for 3 h with cooling on ice. Gels were stained with 0.1% (w/v) Coomassie Blue R-350. Dynamic light scattering and analytical gel filtration were performed as described previously (12Michel G. Roszak A.W. Sauve V. Maclean J. Matte A. Coggins J.R. Cygler M. Lapthorn A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19463-19472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In brief, for dynamic light scattering measurements, 50 μl of protein (0.3 mg/ml) were cleared by centrifugation and transferred to the 96-well plate. Analytical gel filtration was performed by applying 180 μg of protein to the column at a flow rate of 0.5–0.6 ml/min. CD spectra were recorded using a model J-710 spectropolarimeter from Jasco Inc. (Easton, MD) with an N2 flow rate of 5 liters/min and were analyzed using the Jasco J-700 software for Windows v1.10.00. Protein samples (200 μl) at a concentration of ∼0.6–0.8 mg/ml in buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol) were loaded into a CD circular quartz cuvette (path length = 0.05 cm). For each sample, five scans were acquired at a scan speed of 50 nm/min, with a bandwidth of 1.0 nm and a step resolution of 0.2 nm in the wavelength range of 200–250 nm. The scans were subsequently averaged. Spectra of buffer alone were recorded accordingly and subtracted from the protein spectra.Table IForward versions of mutagenic primers, and sequence conservation of the mutated residues in the quinate/shikimate 5-dehydrogenase familyMutantOligonucleotide sequenceaAltered nucleotides, that introduced the desired mutations, are underlined.

Determinations were set up in quadruplicate in 96-well plates using a multichannel pipette for synchronous mixing of the reagents. To determine the substrate- and cofactor-dependent kinetic properties of YdiB variants, we prepared 11 different concentrations each of shikimate, quinate, and NAD by one-in-one dilutions (v/v) of a 4 or 20 mm substrate stock solution and a 4 mm NAD stock solution, respectively. Per well, 180 μl of substrate or cofactor were added to 10 μl of enzyme, and the reactions were started by adding 20 μlofa40mm solution of NAD or substrate (i.e. shikimate or quinate), respectively. Initial velocities of enzyme activity were determined by recording NADH absorbance at 340 nm in a 96-well plate reader. Each reading was calibrated by including a series of eight one-in-one dilutions (v/v) of reduced cofactor in a volume of 210 μl/well, starting from 0.4 mm NADH. Kinetic data were evaluated by non-linear regression analysis with the Michaelis-Menten equation (v = Vmax × [S]/(KM + [S])), using the SigmaPlot software (SPSS Science, Chicago, IL). The catalytic constant, kcat, was calculated using the equation Vmax = kcat × [E], where [E] = total enzyme concentration. Structure Comparison—Structural models 2The atomic coordinates for the crystal structures of YdiB from E. coli and H. influenzae and AroE from E. coli, H. influenzae, and M. jannaschii were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb) under PDB numbers 1O9B/1NPD, 1NPY, 1NYT, 1P74/1P77, and 1NVT, respectively (25Berman H.M.

Liquid chromatograph/mass selective detector analysis gave a mass for YdiB of 31,361 Da, as compared with a calculated mass of 31,371 Da, which agrees within the expected mass error of about 0.02%. This mass includes the additional Gly-Ser residues that remain at the N terminus after thrombin cleavage with protein expressed using the pGEX-4T1 vector (12Michel G. Roszak A.W. Sauve V. Maclean J.

In addition, Asn105 and Arg156 are also conserved in nearly all sequences. The cluster of glycines (at positions 131, 133, and 134) is part of the P-loop that interacts with the phosphates of the NAD(P) cofactor, and the carbonyl group of Gly255 hydrogen-bonds to the amide group of the nicotinamide ring. We have concentrated on the highly conserved residues Ser67, Lys71, Asn92, Asp107, and Gln262 in the vicinity of the putative substrate-binding site as the most likely candidates for residues essential for catalysis. Additionally, we selected the partially conserved residues Ser22, Tyr39, and Thr106 as potential substrate-binding residues (Table I, Fig. 3). We have not attempted to mutate Arg156 as it is remote from the catalytic site and stacks with the adenine ring of NAD. Similarly, Asn105 appears to be shielded from the active site by Asp107 and likely plays a structural role. The mutants S22A, Y39F, S67A, K71G, N92A, T106A, D107A, and Q262A were expressed and, with the exception of N92A, purified to apparent homogeneity as assessed by SDS-PAGE (not shown). The N92A mutant protein appeared more sensitive to proteolytic cleavage than wild-type YdiB or any of the other mutants and was not isolated in a pure form. To assess the effects of the various mutations on YdiB structure, we characterized the conformational integrity of the purified proteins using several methods. Native PAGE showed well focused bands for the wild-type protein, as well as for the S22A, K71G, Q262A, Y39F, and S67A mutants, and less-focused bands for the D107A and T106A mutants (Fig. 4A). The N92A mutant appeared as a smear. Dynamic light scattering measurements on the various purified proteins were mostly in agreement with the results from native PAGE, with the N92A mutant being polydisperse and yielding an apparent molecular mass of 300 kDa (not shown). Consistent with the results from native PAGE, the general shape of the CD spectra for wild-type enzyme and the S67A and K71G mutants were similar, whereas the alanine mutations of Thr106 and Asp107 caused apparent shifts (Fig. 4B). The N92A mutant exhibited a spectrum that deviated significantly from either wild-type YdiB or the other YdiB mutants. In analytical gel filtration experiments, wild-type YdiB exhibited an apparent mass of ∼57 kDa (calculated mass for the recombinant dimer: 62.7 kDa). In addition, the wild-type contained a very small amount (0.2%) of a species with an apparent mass of ∼33 kDa (likely monomeric form) and some protein that eluted in the void volume of the column. About 65% of the N92A mutant protein appeared in the void volume and was likely aggregated, with the remainder eluting at about 33 kDa. Although the T106A mutant also showed considerable amounts of apparent aggregate (12%) and a 33-kDa species (1.8%), it largely eluted as a 57-kDa species (likely dimeric form). The D107A profile was most similar to that of the wild type. Taken together, these data suggested that the N92A protein was improperly folded. The protein was partly degraded, likely by trace amounts of proteolytic enzymes. We assume that the fragments aggregated into larger species. The Asn92 residue is located at a β-bulge, at the N-terminal end of strand β4 within the 6-stranded mixed β-sheet of domain 1 (Fig. 3), and participates in a hydrogen-bonding network through its side chain and main chain atoms (12Michel G.

In this study, we investigated the NMR solution structure of nociceptin in membrane-like environments (trifluoroethanol and SDS micelles) and found it to have a relatively stable helix conformation from residues 4–17 with functionally important N-terminal residues being folded aperidoically on top of the helix. In functional assays for receptor binding and calcium flux, alanine-scanning variants of nociceptin indicated that functionally important residues generally followed helix periodicity, consistent with the NMR structural model.

These effects indicate that, similar to opioids, nociceptin has an inhibitory effect on synaptic transmission in the nervous system, acting to reduce the secretion of neurotransmitters.

Based on their distribution in the brain and spinal cord, nociception and its receptor may be involved in a wide range of functions, including learning, memory, attention, and emotion. Nociceptin is also implicated in various sensory processes such as perception of pain, visual, auditory, and olfactory functions. Nociceptin is related to dynorphin A, a peptide 17-mer ligand of the κ-opioid receptor. Dynorphin A also binds ORL1 but with 100-fold lower affinity than nociceptin (23Mollereau C. Toll L. Suaudeau C. Moisand C. Alvinerie P. Butour J.L. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Monsarrat B. Nature. 1995; 377: 532-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Orphanin FQ2 is another biologically active peptide 17-mer processed from the same nociceptin precursor, prenociceptin (1Meunier J.C. Nature. 1998; 393: 211-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 2Reinscheid R.K. Nothacker H.P. Bourson A. Ardati A. Henningsen R.A. Bunzow J.R. Grandy D.K. Langen H. Monsma Jr., F.J. Civelli O.

Nature. 1998; 392: 286-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the amino acid sequences of orphanin FQ2, nociceptin, and dynorphin A. Although nociceptin and dynorphin A are the most homologous of these three peptides (particularly at the N and C termini and being polycationic), there are clear differences in amino acid sequence that should affect conformation and receptor binding as noted above. For example, dynorphin A contains a conformationally constraining proline residue and has mid-segment cationic residues sequentially out of sync relative to nociceptin. Knowledge of the structures of these peptides would be highly informative and could aid in understanding their functions. However, both dynorphin A and nociceptin have been structurally elusive. In previous biophysical studies, dynorphin A (25Spadaccini R. Crescenzi O. Picone D. Tancredi T. Temussi P.A. J. Pept. Sci. 1999; 5: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and nociceptin (26Salvadori S. Picone D. Tancredi T. Guerrini R. Spadaccini R. Lazarus L.H. Regoli D. Temussi P.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 640-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) show little tendency to form well defined structures in water and in other polar solvents. Because these peptides function by interacting with a membrane receptor, possibly by first interacting with membrane lipids (27Schwyzer R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6335-6342Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), we investigated the NMR solution conformation of nociceptin in a relatively low dielectric environment, i.e. 30% (v/v) trifluoroethanol (TFE) 1The abbreviations used are: TFE, trifluoroethanol; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; PFG, pulsed field gradient; HTS, high-throughput screening; ROE, rotating-frame Overhauser effect.1The abbreviations used are: TFE, trifluoroethanol; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; PFG, pulsed field gradient; HTS, high-throughput screening; ROE, rotating-frame Overhauser effect. and water, and in the presence of SDS micelles. Both systems are often employed in NMR investigations to mimic membrane-like environments. Here, we demonstrate that nociceptin forms a relatively well defined helix structure in aqueous solution with SDS micelles. In addition, the measurement of receptor binding and function using nociceptin and numerous amino acid-substituted variants allowed structure-activity relationships to be derived. Results are discussed in terms of explaining differences in activities and receptor binding among opioid peptides. Overall, this work aids in the design of small molecules that can mimic the structure and function of nociceptin. Peptide Preparation—Peptides were synthesized using a Milligen/Biosearch 9600 peptide solid-phase synthesizer using fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl chemistry. Lyophilized crude peptides were purified by preparative reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography on a C18 column with an elution gradient of 0–60% acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water. Purity and composition of the peptides were verified by high performance liquid chromatography (Beckman Model 6300), amino acid analysis, and mass spectrometry. NMR Measurements—For NMR measurements, freeze-dried peptide was dissolved in water (H2O or D2O), in 30% (v/v) TFE/water, or in 10 mm SDS/water. These aqueous solutions also contained 10 mm potassium phosphate. Depending on the NMR experiment, peptide concentration varied in the millimolar range. The pH value was adjusted to 5.5 by adding milliliter quantities of NaOD or DCl to the peptide sample. NMR spectra were acquired on a Varian UNITY Plus-600 NMR spectrometer. Two dimensional homonuclear magnetization transfer (HOHAHA) spectra, obtained by spin-locking with a MLEV-17 sequence (28Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar) with a mixing time of 60 ms, were used to identify spin systems. NOESY experiments (29Wider G. Macura S. Kumar A. Ernst R.R. Wuthrich K. J. Magn. Reson. 1984; 56: 207-234Google Scholar) as well as its rotating frame analog ROESY for nociceptin in water were performed for conformational analysis. All of the two-dimensional NMR spectra were acquired in the States-TPPI phase-sensitive mode (30Bodenhausen G. Vold R.L. Vold R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1980; 37: 93-106Google Scholar, 31States D.J. Haberkorn R.A. Ruben D.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 48: 286-292Google Scholar). The water resonance was suppressed by direct irradiation (0.8 s) at the water frequency during the relaxation delay between scans as well as during the mixing time in NOESY experiments. Two-dimensional NMR spectra were collected as 256–512 t1 experiments, each with 2048 complex data points over a spectral width of 6 kHz in both dimensions with the carrier placed on the water resonance. For HOHAHA and NOESY spectra, 16 scans were time averaged per t1 experiment. Data were processed directly on the spectrometer or offline using VNMR (Varian, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) or NMRPipe (32Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11280) Google Scholar) on an SGI workstation. Data sets were multiplied in both dimensions by a 30–60°-shifted sine-bell function and zero-filled to 1024 in the t1 dimension prior to Fourier transformation. Pulsed field gradient (PFG) NMR self-diffusion measurements were performed as a check for peptide self-association and SDS micelle interaction. PFG NMR experiments were done as described by Mayo et al. (33Mayo K.H. Ilyina E. Park H. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1301-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) using a Varian Unity-Plus 600 NMR spectrometer. The maximum magnitude of the gradient (g) was calibrated using a Varian deuterated water standard. The diffusion coefficient of nociceptin (D) was estimated from the diffusion decay of spin-echo by using Equation 1,[A(g2)=A(0)exp[−γ2δ2g2D(Δ−δ/3)]](Eq. 1) where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio for protons, δ is the duration of the pulsed field gradient, and Δ is the spacing between the front edges of pulsed field gradient. Self-diffusion measurements were performed at 25 °C in D2O, in 30% TFE/70% D2O (v/v), and in 10 mm SDS in D2O. Peptide concentration ranged from 0.1 to 14 mm. The pH value was adjusted to 5.5 as stated above. Structural Modeling—The analysis of NOE growth curves indicated that backbone to backbone interproton NOEs were normally maximum at 300–400 ms. Interproton distance constraints were derived from NOEs assigned in 1H NOESY spectra acquired with mixing times of 200 and 400 ms. NOEs were classified as strong, medium, weak, or very weak corresponding to upper bound distance constraints of 2.8, 3.3, 4.0, and 4.5 Å, respectively. The lower bound restraint between non-bonded protons was set to 1.8 Å. Pseudo-atom corrections were added to the upper bound distance constraints where appropriate, and a 0.5-Å correction was added to the upper bound for NOEs involving methyl protons. Hydrogen bond constraints were identified from the pattern of sequential NOEs involving NH and αH protons, initial structure calculations performed without hydrogen bond constraints, and evidence of relatively slow amide proton-solvent exchange and temperature factors. Each hydrogen bond identified was defined using two distance constraints: rNH-0 = 1.8–2.5 Å and rN-0 = 2.6–3.4 Å. Derived internuclear distance constraints were used in calculating structures for the nociceptin peptide by using X-PLOR (34Brunger A.T. X-Plor. A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). Nociceptin was created using Parallhdg.pro force fields. A template coordinate set was generated by using the Template routine. The ab initio simulated annealing protocol then was used. The simulated annealing procedure ran high temperature dynamics (3000 K for 120 ps) and then cooled down to 100 K in 50-K steps with 1.5-ps molecular dynamics at each step. Powell minimization was performed at 100 K for 1000 steps. Structure refinement was done based on simulated annealing starting at 1000 K and ending at 100 K. Final structures were subjected to the X-PLOR Accept routine with the violation threshold for NOEs of 0.5 Å and dihedral angles of 5°. Angles, bond lengths, or impropers were not allowed to deviate from ideal geometry more than 5°, 0.05 Å, and 5°, respectively. Structures were superimposed using the BIOSYM INSIGHT viewer (Molecular Simulations, Inc.) and were analyzed using X-PLOR analysis routines. Binding of Peptides to the Nociceptin Receptor (ORL1)—The nociceptin receptor binding assay measures the binding of [125I-Tyr14]nociceptin (2200 Ci/mmol, New England Nuclear) to human ORL1 on HEK-293 cell membranes. HEK-293 cell membranes from cells stably expressing ORL1 were prepared as described previously (35Pulito V.L. Li X. Varga S.S. Mulcahy L.S. Clark K.S. Halbert S.A. Reitz A.B. Murray W.V. Jolliffe L.K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 294: 224-229PubMed Google Scholar) with the exception that the binding buffer used was 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EGTA. ORL1 membranes were diluted in binding buffer such that 25 μl containing 1 μg of membrane was added to each well of a standard 96-well microtiter plate in binding buffer. Peptides were diluted at 50× the indicated concentration, and 1 μl was added to each well. [125I-Tyr14]Nociceptin was added at a final concentration of 0.5 nm so that the total reaction volume was 50 μl. Plates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature, and the reactions were filtered over GF/C Filterplates (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) prewetted in 0.03% polyethleneimine in a Filtermate 196 apparatus (Packard). Plates were washed six times with binding buffer in the filtration apparatus and then dried under vacuum for 1–2 h. 25 μl of Microscint 20 (Packard) per well was added to solubilize bound radioactivity. The plates were then sealed and counted on a Packard Top Count to determine radioactivity bound to the membranes. The curves were fitted, and Ki values were determined using GraphPad Prism software (version 3.0). Calcium Flux—Although ORL1 is coupled to the G protein, Gi, and thus does not normally elicit a calcium response, we were able to pretreat cells with the muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol, upon which cells were “sensitized” and able to elicit a subsequent calcium response upon nociceptin administration. This technique has previously been described for ORL1 specifically (9Vaughan C.W. Chieng B. Christie M.J. Connor M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 119: 1614-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and for Gi-coupled receptors in general (36Wong T.T. Chang K.P. Chi C.S. Yang T.F. Lee Y.C. Guo W.Y. Su M.S. Chan J.S. Childs Nerv. Syst. 2000; 16: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). HEK-293 cells expressing ORL1 receptor were plated at a density of 50,000 cells/well in a total volume of 50 μl onto 96-well plates. Two days later, cells were prepared for assay using the FLIPR calcium assay kit (Molecular Devices) according to manufacturer's directions with the exception that the volume of dye mixture added to each well was 50 μl instead of 100 μl. Cells were then treated with 100 μm carbachol delivered in a total volume of 100 μl. After base line was reestablished, cells were challenged with varying concentrations of nociceptin or a nociceptin variant. Data points were collected at one per second for 120 s and then one every 3 s for 30 s for a total collection time of 150 s after both the first and second additions. Calcium flux as a function of nociceptin administration was calculated and divided by the response resulting from carbachol administration to normalize within individual wells. This produced a “percent of carbachol response” for each dose. The experiment was repeated six times, and the high and low values for each concentration were dropped. The data were used to generate EC50 curves using GraphPad Prism, version 3.0 software. Three-dimensional Data Base Searching—Three-dimensional Flex searches were performed with Unity 4.2 (Tripos, Inc., St. Louis, MO) using the Directed Tweak algorithm. Three point queries were defined for explicit atom types within the peptide pharmacophore using distance constraints with tolerances of ±1–2 Å. Standard settings were used for the flexible searching. The Unity data base was created from the command line starting from a Concord-generated three-dimensional structure-data file. As part of defining the best solution conditions for solution structure studies of nociceptin, PFG NMR self-diffusion measurements were performed in water (D2O), in a water/TFE mixture, and in the presence of SDS micelles over the concentration range of 0.1–14 mm. Diffusion coefficients versus concentration of nociceptin are plotted in Fig. 2 for all of the solution conditions investigated. Diffusion coefficients for nociceptin in water and at low concentration up to 2 mm fell within a range consistent for monomeric peptide as estimated using the Stokes-Einstein relationship (37Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry, Part III. W. H. Freeman, New York1980: 979-1039Google Scholar). However, as the nociceptin concentration is increased from 2 to 5 mm, its diffusion coefficient drops sharply. This effect is attributable to self-association of the peptide, and the magnitude drop in the diffusion coefficient is consistent with nociceptin forming dimers. As will be evident later, this may be attributable to the folded structure of nociceptin, which is an amphipathic helix. Dimer formation may be mediated through interactions of the hydrophobic faces of two molecules of the peptide. Above 5 mm, changes in the diffusion coefficient are explainable by changes in solution viscosity, allowing one to conclude that further aggregation does not occur up to at least 14 mm. The dashed line in this plot indicates changes in the diffusion coefficient expected solely for increases in solution viscosity as peptide concentration is increased. Although this phenomenon is interesting, NOESY/ROESY data acquired in water at any concentration of peptide were of little use in terms of structure elucidation. As discussed in the following section, NOEs (ROEs) were few and resonances were generally broadened, probably the result of monomer-dimer exchange. In TFE/water, nociceptin behaves similarly (Fig. 2). The presence of 30% TFE in water increases solution viscosity and by itself accounts for the observation of overall smaller diffusion coefficients. However, the shape of curve does parallel that observed in water alone. The abrupt 10% drop in diffusion coefficients at 2 mm peptide is again consistent with dimer formation. Nevertheless, as in water, NOESY data were of limited use in nociceptin structure elucidation discussed later. In the presence of SDS, it is apparent that nociceptin interacts with micelles. At peptide concentrations of 0.1 mm and at 1 mm, the observed diffusion coefficient of about 0.7 × 10-6 cm2/s at 25 °C for nociceptin is close to the diffusion coefficient reported for SDS micelles alone (1 × 10-6 cm2/s at 25 °C (38Vangeyte P. Leyh B. Auvray L. Grandjean J. Misselyn-Bauduin A.M. Jerome R. Langmuir. 2004; 20: 9019-9028Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), 0.85 × 10-6 cm2/s at 37 °C (39Andersson A. Almqvist J. Hagn F. Maler L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1661: 18-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and 1.19 × 10-6 cm2/s at 37 °C (40Balakrishnan A. Rege B.D. Amidon G.L. Polli J.E. J. Pharm. Sci. 2004; 93: 2064-2075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar)), indicating that nociceptin is binding to SDS micelles. This diffusion coefficient is consistent with the presence of ∼50–100 SDS molecules/micelle and ∼1–2 molecules of nociceptin bound/micelle. In the high concentration range (2–12 mm), diffusion coefficients are only somewhat smaller than those observed for monomeric nociceptin in water (Fig. 2). This minimal difference reflects a weighted average of free and micelle bound nociceptin with most of the peptide in the free state. At a concentration of 2 mm peptide and higher, the 2.5-fold shift in diffusion coefficient between SDS and water is consistent with ∼10% or less of the nociceptin being bound at any given time. NMR Conformational Analysis—In water alone, nociceptin at any concentration investigated (0.1–14 mm), even under conditions favoring the dimer state, shows mostly random coil chemical shifts (41Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1998) Google Scholar) and only a few conformationally meaningful NOEs/ROEs. This is consistent with what was reported previously for nociceptin dissolved in water (26Salvadori S. Picone D. Tancredi T. Guerrini R. Spadaccini R. Lazarus L.H. Regoli D. Temussi P.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 640-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Moreover, resonances in both TOCSY (Fig. 3A) and ROESY (Fig. 4, A and B) spectra are generally broader than they are in TFE (data not shown) or in the presence of SDS micelles (Figs. 3B and 4, C and D).Fig. 4NOESY/ROESY spectra for nociceptin in water and in the presence of SDS. αH-NH and NH-NH regions from a 600 MHz 1H ROESY spectrum for nociceptin in water (A and B) and from a 1H NOESY spectrum in water in the presence of SDS micelles (C and D) are shown. Peptide concentration was 3 mm in 10 mm potassium phosphate, 10 mm SDS, pH 5.5, and 25 °C. Spectra were accumulated with 8192 data points over 6000 Hz sweep width and were processed with 1 Hz line broadening. Some key NOEs/ROEs are identified.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) However, in aqueous TFE, nociceptin at 2 (monomer state) or 5 mm (dimer state) demonstrates some conformational preference. At either concentration, the observation of a series of NH-NH NOEs running from nociceptin residues Thr5 to Gln17 suggests the presence of nascent helix formation (42Rance M. Houghten R.A. Wright P.E. Lerner R.A. Dyson H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 201-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Moreover, several αH-NH i,i+2 and i,i+3 NOEs were identified along with three NH-NH i,i+2 and two NH-NH i,i+3 NOEs, supporting the presence of multiple turn or helix conformation (41Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1998) Google Scholar, 43Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley-Interscience, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar) that appears to be stabilized in this lower dielectric medium. In water alone, only some smaller NH-NH ROEs were observed (Fig. 4B). In the presence of SDS micelles, nociceptin exhibits a significantly larger number of NOEs (compare Fig. 4, A and B with C and D, respectively). This is best evident at nociceptin concentrations above ∼2 mm where resonance broadening is not of concern as it is at lower concentration. Combined with the results from the diffusion data, this observation is consistent with the idea that nociceptin interacts with SDS micelles in relatively fast exchange between free and bound states on the NMR chemical shift time scale. In this regard, it is most likely that we are observing transferred NOEs (44Levy R. Assulin O. Scherf T. Levitt M. Anglister J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7168-7175Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) as the result of this interaction and exchange equilibrium. Therefore, for NMR structural analysis, NOESY data were acquired at a nociceptin concentration of 3 mm to take advantage of the transferred NOE effect and to work with the peptide mostly in the free state where resonance broadening is not problematic. Nociceptin exhibits considerably more stable helical structure in the presence of SDS micelles than in TFE or in water. This is evidenced by differences in chemical shifts of resonances from the peptide compared with those observed in aqueous TFE (Table I) as well as by comparison of TOCSY (HOHAHA) spectra of the peptide in water and in SDS micelles (Fig. 3). Most NH and αCH resonances shift upfield, and residue Gly3 αCH2 and some βCH2 resonances become either non-degenerate or better separated (Table I and see Fig. 3, Thr5 and Ser10). The Gly3 αCH resonances, nearly degenerate in TFE, become separated by 0.25 ppm and shifted upfield by 0.68 ppm in SDS micelles (Table I) (not in field in Fig. 3). In contrast, residue Gly6 αCH2 resonances are downfield shifted by 0.87 ppm from TFE (Table I) and by 0.65 ppm from water (Fig. 3). These observations are probably due to ring current shifting because of proximity to residues Phe1 and/or Phe4 and indicate structural stabilization and possible positioning of the phenylalanine ring either above the Gly3 αCH2 group or on edge with the Gly6 αCH2 group. Other similar chemical shift differences listed in Table I can be found when comparing nociceptin in water and in SDS micelles (see Fig. 3).Table ISecondary chemical shifts for nociceptin in SDS micellesResidueNHαHβHOtherPhe1-+0.55??2, 6, +0.043, 5, +0.06Gly2+0.28+0.1--Gly3+1.0+0.2, +0.05--Phe4+0.26+0.1+0.05, -0.22, 6, -0.033, 5, -0.03Thr5-0.02+0.10γH3 0Gly6-0.58-0.4--Ala7+0.12+0.2+0.05-Arg8+0.1+0.250All 0Lys9+0.39+0.30All 0Ser10+0.17+0.2+0.05, 0-Ala11+0.36+0.15+0.05-Arg12+0.34+0.20All 0Lys13+0.31+0.250All 0Leu14+0.34+0.2-0.05All ∼0Ala15+0.33+0.1-0.05-Asn16+0.25+0.1+0.15, 0-Gln17+0.01+0.2+0.1, +0.05γH2 +0.05 Open table in a new tab Also in SDS micelles, nociceptin exhibits numerous structurally informative NOEs as exemplified in Fig. 4, which shows αH-NH and NH-NH regions from NOESY data acquired on nociceptin in the presence of SDS micelles. Fig. 5 summarizes these and other observed NOEs. The pattern of NOEs indicates the formation of a relatively good helix conformation (39Andersson A. Almqvist J. Hagn F. Maler L. Biochim. Biophys.

This remarkable process results in lysis of target cells and is fundamental to mammalian defense against infection. The 150-amino acid residue domain at the C terminus of C5 (C5-C345C) is pivotal to C5 function.

A complement-mediated response to infection is fundamental to good health, but inappropriate complement activity underlies the symptoms of numerous inflammatory disorders (1Mizuno M. Morgan B.P. Curr. Drug Targets Inflamm. Allergy. 2004; 3: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Activation of complement, and the ensuing attack on pathogens, entails a sequence of intermolecular recognition events, enzymatic cleavages, and assemblies of multiprotein complexes. The ∼30 fluid-phase and membrane-associated proteins participating in the complement system have been well characterized at the sequence level, and their respective roles are broadly understood (2Walport M.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1140-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar, 3Walport M.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1058-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar). There is, however, little understanding at atomic resolution of the interplay between the components. In particular, the sequence in which the five soluble, terminal components of complement (C5, C6, C7, C8, and C9) assemble to form the remarkable lipid bilayer-penetrating membrane attack complex (MAC) 1The abbreviations used are: MAC, membrane attack complex; C5-C345C, residues Ala1512 to the C-terminal Cys1658 of human C5; FIMAC, factor I membrane attack complex; OB, oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide binding; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, NOE spectroscopy; NTR, netrin-like; PCOLCE, type I procollagen C-proteinase enhancer protein; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase; WT, wild type; PDB, Protein Data Bank. has been known for many years (4Muller-Eberhard H.J. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1985; 50: 235-246PubMed Google Scholar). But the network of protein-protein interactions entailed in forming this stable lytic complex and the involvement of specific amino acids remain a mystery. The key to progress in this area will be more three-dimensional structural information. Assembly of the MAC is initiated by proteolytic cleavage of C5 by the trimeric enzyme, C5 convertase, at the target cell surface to generate C5a and a metastable species, C5b. C5b has the transient ability to interact tightly with C6 (5DiScipio R.G. Smith C.A. Muller-Eberhard H.J. Hugli T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10629-10636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C5bC6 complex subsequently serves as a nucleation site for sequential assembly of C7, C8, and n molecules of C9 to create the MAC. Mature C5 is a heterodimer consisting of α and β chains of 115 and 75 kDa, respectively. It is evolutionarily related to the earlier complement components C3 and C4. Unlike the majority of proteins of the complement system, C3, C4, and C5 are not entirely modular in their composition. Nonetheless it is surprising, given the intense interest in this family of proteins that has persisted over several decades, that little is known of their structure. For example, although the solution structure of the much smaller C5a fragment has been solved (6Zuiderweg E.R. Nettesheim D.G. Mollison K.W. Carter G.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 172-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), in the case of C5b there is currently no three-dimensional structural information available. An opportunity to address this lack of structural information arose from the suggestion that the C-terminal ∼150-amino acid residue portions of the α chains of C3 and C5 and of the γ chain of C4 are independently folded units (7Ishii N. Wadsworth W.G. Stern B.D. Culotti J.G. Hedgecock E.M. Neuron. 1992; 9: 873-881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 8Banyai L. Patthy L. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1636-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Not only do these regions exhibit high sequence similarity with one another but they also display an ∼19% sequence identity to the C-terminal segment of the Caenorhabditis elegans UNC-6, a laminin-related netrin protein involved in axonal path finding (7Ishii N. Wadsworth W.G. Stern B.D. Culotti J.G. Hedgecock E.M. Neuron. 1992; 9: 873-881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Furthermore, homologies with C-terminal segments of procollagen C-proteinase enhancer proteins (PCOLCEs) and of secreted frizzled-related proteins have been noted (8Banyai L. Patthy L. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1636-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and this family of domains has been named the NTR (netrin-like) module. The more recently solved three-dimensional structure of the PCOLCE-1 NTR module (9Liepinsh E. Banyai L. Pintacuda G. Trexler M. Patthy L. Otting G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25982-25989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) confirmed structural similarities with the N-terminal domains of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1 and -2 (10Muskett F.W.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). Expression of the segment of C5 corresponding to its C345C domain (14Thai C.T. Ogata R.T. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6565-6573Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) followed by analysis using CD and NMR confirmed that these amino acid residues fold to form a compact three-dimensional structure (15Bramham J. Rance M. Thai C.T. Uhrin D. Assa-Munt N. Ogata R.T. Barlow P.N. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 29: 217-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Furthermore, C5-C345C, unlike the C345C domain of C3, is able to bind to both C6 and C7 in surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based assays (14Thai C.T. Ogata R.T. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6565-6573Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In further work, C5-C345C was shown to inhibit recruitment of C7 by C5bC6 through an interaction between C5-C345C and the pair of factor I membrane attack complex (FIMAC) domains, also called factor I modules (FIMs), at the C terminus of C7 (16Thai C.T. Ogata R.T. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 4547-4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus the C5-C345C domain provides at least part of the interacting surface between C5b and C7 in formation of the MAC. The C345C domain also harbors a region that interacts with the C5 convertase (17Sandoval A. Ai R. Ostresh J.M. Ogata R.T. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), although the cleavage site itself lies some 800 residues away toward the N terminus of the α chain of C5. Although the fold of C5-C345C might be anticipated to resemble the fold of the NTR module from PCOLCE-1 (9Liepinsh E. Banyai L. Pintacuda G. Trexler M. Patthy L. Otting G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25982-25989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), the sequence identity is low (see Fig. 1A) and disulfide bonding patterns are different, 1–4, 2–5, and 3–6 in the PCOLCE-1 NTR module compared with 1–3, 2–6, and 4–5 in the C3 equivalent (and therefore by inference in the C5 example). The C5-C345C sequence is longer and contains fewer prolines (147 residues including three prolines) compared with the PCOLCE-1 NTR module sequence (119 residues including 11 prolines). An experimentally determined three-dimensional structure of C5-C345C would therefore represent an important advance in understanding the basis, at atomic resolution, for the early steps of MAC assembly. Here we report the use of solution NMR to solve the structure of C5-C345C. We thus provide the first new structural information for the C3/C4/C5 family of proteins since the structures of the C3d and C4d fragments were solved (18Nagar B. Jones R.G. Diefenbach R.J. Isenman D.E. Rini J.M. Science. 1998; 280: 1277-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 19van den Elsen J.M. Martin A. Wong V. Clemenza L. Rose D.R. Isenman D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 1103-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and, in the case of C5, since the anaphylatoxic C5a fragment structure was determined in 1989 (6Zuiderweg E.R. Nettesheim D.G. Mollison K.W. Carter G.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 172-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The new structure allows the construction of useful models of the C345C domains from C3 and C4. The positions within the structure of residues previously identified as being functionally critical and the location of surface patches likely to be involved in protein-protein interactions are now revealed. Protein Preparation—pET15b vectors encoding the amino acid residues of C5 from Ala1512 to the C-terminal residue Cys1658 (both with and without the point mutation F1613A) were constructed as described previously (14Thai C.T. Ogata R.T. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6565-6573Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The isotopically enriched recombinant proteins were overexpressed in the Escherichia coli strain Origami (Novagen, Madison, WI) and purified as described previously (14Thai C.T. Ogata R.T. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6565-6573Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For NMR studies, 15N- and 15N, 13C-protein samples (0.5–1.0 mm) were prepared in buffer containing 20 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, 5 μm EDTA, 0.02% NaN3, pH 6.0, in 95% H2O, 5% D2O. Binding Studies—Affinities of the recombinant wild-type and F1613A versions of C5-C345C for C6 and C7 were measured using SPR as described previously (14Thai C.T. Ogata R.T. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6565-6573Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). NMR Spectroscopy—NMR spectra were acquired on Bruker AVANCE 600- and 800-MHz and Varian INOVA 600- and 800-MHz spectrometers, using 5-mm triple resonance probes equipped with pulse-field gradients. Spectra were processed using the AZARA package (provided by W. Boucher, University of Cambridge), using maximum entropy processing of F1 and F2 dimensions of the three-dimensional experiments, and resonance assignment was achieved using ANSIG as described previously (15Bramham J. Rance M. Thai C.T. Uhrin D. Assa-Munt N. Ogata R.T. Barlow P.N. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 29: 217-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Distance restraints for the structure calculation were derived from the following three complementary NOE spectroscopy (NOESY) experiments: a 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC and two 13C-edited NOESY-HSQCs, one in H2O buffer and one in D2O buffer. All mixing times were 100 ms. Slowly exchanging amide protons were identified by the detection of 26 NH resonances in a 15N-HSQC spectrum recorded 1 month after exchanging a protein sample into D2O buffer. Hydrogen bond acceptors for most of these slowly exchanging protons were identified using the refined initial structures. Distance restraints corresponding to hydrogen bonds were only introduced following identification of the supporting characteristic NOEs. 15N Relaxation Measurements—15N T1 and T2 relaxation times were measured by the method of Kay (20Kay L.E. Nicholson L.A. Delaglio F. Bax A. Torchia D.E. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 97: 359-375Google Scholar). The pulse sequence was modified according to Grzesiek and Bax (21Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 12593-12594Crossref Scopus (1015) Google Scholar) to keep the water magnetization on the z axis during the T1 period. Relaxation delays of 43.1, 253.1, 421.1, 589.1, 757.1, 841.1, 925.1, and 1051.1 ms were employed for T1 measurements, and delays of 15.8, 31.6, 63.2, 94.8, 111.7, and 126.5 ms were employed for T2 measurements. The T1 and T2 relaxation times were calculated by nonlinear least squares fitting. In each case, the spectrum corresponding to one of the relaxation delay values was re-collected to allow an estimation of the experimental error of the measured peak intensities. For the 1H-15N HSQC heteronuclear NOE experiment (21Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 12593-12594Crossref Scopus (1015) Google Scholar), a saturation experiment and a reference experiment were recorded with a relaxation delay of 5 s, of which 3 s was used for 1H saturation in the 1H-saturated experiment. Structure Calculation—Wherever possible, resonances in the NOESY spectra were assigned unambiguously. Otherwise a set of two or more assignment possibilities were assigned on the basis of their chemical shifts using the Connect program within AZARA. Peak intensities were converted into four distance categories of 0–2.7, 0–3.3, 0–5.0, and 0–6.0 Å. A total of 3544 distance restraints were generated from the three NOESY-HSQCs, of which 2609 were unambiguous and nondegenerate. The NOE-derived distance restraints were used as input for the structure calculations using CNS-Solve (22Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). At a later stage more distance restraints representing the 26 inferred hydrogen bonds were added to the restraints list. The simulated annealing protocol employed the PARALLHD force field, with the nonbonded energy function of PROLSQ (23Linge J.P. Nilges M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) and included active swapping of pro-chiral centers. For the initial structure calculations, the six cysteines were defined as being in the oxidized state. In the absence of information from experimental disulfide mapping, however, no covalent linkages between sulfur atoms were initially defined in the molecular structure file in order to avoid bias. At a later stage, and based on the initial structure calculations, two disulfide bonds, Cys1514–Cys1588 and Cys1535–Cys1658, were added. There was a lack of NOE-based evidence to support the formation of a disulfide between the remaining pair of cysteines, Cys1636 and Cys1639. This arose, at least in part, from a paucity of assignments for nuclei in this region of the sequence. No covalent linkage was therefore defined between these residues. As the calculations progressed, the ambiguously assigned distance restraints were “filtered” iteratively to eliminate assignment possibilities contributing less than 1% to the total NOE, and redundant restraints (duplicates) were also removed. A total of 100 structures were calculated from which a representative ensemble of 40 structures, with the lowest NOE-derived energies, was selected. The quality of the ensemble of structures was checked with PROCHECK (24Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The NOE-derived distance restraints used for the structure calculations and the coordinates of the ensemble of 40 structures of C5-C345C have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession number 1XWE. Modeling C345C Domains of C3 and C4 —Modeling of the C345C domains of C3 and C4 was undertaken based on the lowest NOE energy NMR-derived structure of C5-C345C using the program Modeller release 7, version 7 (25Sali A.

The alignments between the target sequences of human C3 and C4 C345C domains and the template structure were based on initial multiple sequence alignments of C3-, C4-, and C5-C345C domain sequences from various organisms from the SwissProt (26Boeckmann B.

The multiple sequence alignment (Fig. 1B) was manually edited to ensure the most plausible alignment of conserved amino acid residues and of secondary structure elements as predicted by PsiPred (30McGuffin L.J. Bryson K. Jones D.T. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 404-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2777) Google Scholar) between the target and template. The three putative disulfide bridges and the longer predicted C-terminal α-helix of both the C3 and C4 C345C domains were restrained during model building. Twenty models were generated in each case, and the one with the lowest objective function score (25Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar) was selected as the representative model. The representative model structures were protonated using the program REDUCE (31Word J.M. Lovell S.C. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1735-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar) and were checked for valid stereochemistry using PROCHECK (24Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Recombinant F1613A Mutant Binds C6/C7—The protein fragment, C5-C345C (residues Ala1512 to the C-terminal Cys1658 of human C5), with an N-terminal His tag was overexpressed in the E. coli strain Origami. The use of a bacterial expression system facilitated isotopic enrichment, and the Origami strain was selected because its oxidizing intracellular environment is conducive to formation of disulfide bonds (32Bessette P.H. Aslund F. Beckwith J. Georgiou G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13703-13708Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). After thrombin cleavage of the His tag, four extra residues (Gly-Ser-His-Met) remained at the N terminus of the C5-C345C sequence. Protein expression levels in rich media were typically 4 mg liter-1 but only 0.5 mg liter-1 in Martek 9-labeled media. Yields were improved 4–5-fold using a construct with the point mutation F1613A. To assess any structural perturbations that might be introduced by such a mutation, 15N, 1H-HSQC spectra of 15N-labeled wild-type and F1613A C5-C345C samples were compared (data not shown). Nearly all the resonances coincide. Significant chemical shift differences were noted only for those peaks corresponding to residues located close in sequence to the mutation, namely Ile1609–Tyr1617; of these only Asn1612, Phe/Ala1613, and Ser1614 show major differences. This observation demonstrates the F1613A mutant of C5-C345C has a near identical structure to that of the native domain. To assay for functional activity, binding to C6 and C7 was measured (Fig. 2). As may be judged from the SPR-derived binding parameters (Table I), the affinities of the F1316A mutant for both these MAC components are similar or identical to those of the wild-type domain. Given its higher expression levels, the mutant was therefore used in the subsequent structural studies.Table IBinding parameters for wild-type and F1613A C5-C345C Values are derived from the data in Fig. 2.C6C7KDkonkoffKDkonkoffnmnmWT C5-C345C102 × 1042 × 10-433 × 1049 × 10-5F1613A C5-C345C92 × 1042 × 10-423 × 1046 × 10-5 Open table in a new tab The Solution Structure of C5-C345C Is Solved—The 15N and 15N, 13C-labeled samples of C5-C345C yielded high quality NMR spectra thus permitting the assignment of nearly all of the 15N, 13C, and 1H nuclei (15Bramham J. Rance M. Thai C.T. Uhrin D. Assa-Munt N. Ogata R.T. Barlow P.N. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 29: 217-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Only a few assignments were made for Ser1637, Ser1638, and the four non-native residues at the N terminus because they all gave rise to few detectable resonances. Several assignments for aromatic side chain atoms were missing, mainly due to overlapping signals; these were Tyr1543 (Cϵ and Hϵ), Tyr1611 (Cϵ and Hϵ), Phe1556 (Cζ and Hζ), Phe1615 (Cϵ, Hϵ, Cζ, and Hζ), Phe1642 (Cϵ and Hϵ), and Phe1654 (Cϵ, Cζ, and Hζ). Tyr1541 is unusual in that its Hδ and its Hϵ nuclei have nondegenerate chemical shifts; a strong chemical exchange peak between the resonances of Hδ1 and Hδ2 and between Hϵ1 and Hϵ2, indicates restricted rotation of its aromatic side chain (subsequently, the structure reveals that this side chain is indeed well buried within the core of the protein). The Hα atom of Leu1521 exhibits an unusually low chemical shift of 1.58 ppm (cf. average shift is 4.32 ppm). All three proline residues are in the trans conformation as evidenced by the differences in the chemical shifts, δCβ–δCγ of 4.03, 5.00, and 4.88 ppm for Pro1537, Pro1620, and Pro1631, respectively (δCβ–δCγ is 4.51 ± 1.17 ppm for trans and 9.64 ± 1.27 ppm for cis (33Schubert M. Labudde D. Oschkinat H. Schmieder P. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 24: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar)), as well as strong NOE cross-peaks between the Hδs of the prolines and the Hα of the preceding residues. Subsequently, a structure calculation was undertaken using a total of 3544 NMR-derived distance restraints as detailed in Table II. Two disulfide (Cys1514–Cys1588 and Cys1535–Cys1658) bonds were added only after NOE-based calculations had established beyond a doubt the proximity and orientation of the contributing cysteine side chains. A third potential disulfide was not invoked because, although the remaining two cysteine residues are close in space, there is insufficient NOE-derived evidence to judge whether their side chains are appropriately juxtaposed. Similarly, distance restraints based on 26 inferred inter-β-strand H-bonds were not added until the later stages of the structure calculation.Table IIStructural statistics for the 40 lowest energy structuresEnsembleClosest to meanNo. of experimental restraints used (all)35443544NOE-derivedIntraresidue12751275Sequential531531Medium range (|i - j| ≤ 4)221221Long range (|i - j| > 4)582582Ambiguous909909Hydrogen bonds2626Coordinate r.m.s.d.

The r.m.s.d. of the Cα coordinates of the 40 selected structures from those of the mean structure are plotted in Fig. 4A as a function of residue number and compared with the distribution of 1H-1H NOEs (Fig. 4B). Significantly fewer than average NOEs are exhibited by two stretches of residues within the sequence (Ile1609–Phe1615 and Thr1635–Cys1639) and by the N-terminal residues Ala1512 and Asp1513. This is reflected in the elevated r.m.s.d. values of their Cαs and is also evident from inspection of the overlay in Fig. 3A. In the case of Ser1637 and Ser1638, the aforementioned lack of detectable amide signals would account in part for the dearth of NOEs.Fig. 4Convergence, number of distance restraints, and relaxation measurements.A, the r.m.s.d. of each residue (Cα) is plotted based on a superposition that excluded residues 1512, 1610–1615, and 1635–1639.

Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12421) Google Scholar) criteria, as implemented in MolMol (35Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). Two views of the fold of the closest-to-the-mean C5-C345C structure are shown in Fig. 3B. The core of the structure is an OB-class fold that is most easily thought of as two orthogonal three-stranded, antiparallel twisted β-sheets composed from strands AC-B-C and strands AN-D-E, where the superscripts N and C denote the N- and the C-terminal halves of strand A (Tyr1541–Val1552). There are two adjacent helices as follows: a short one (helix-1, Arg1530–Ala1534) composed of residues from near the N terminus of the module, and a longer and irregular one (helix-2, Leu1643–Leu1655) close to the C terminus of the module (and of the full-length protein). The two helices are tilted with respect to one another but are essentially aligned with, and lie against, the convex face of the AN-D-E sheet. Strand B (Val1557–Lys1568) extends beyond the AC-B-C sheet so that its C-terminal part participates in a four-stranded anti-parallel sheet BC-AN-D-E. In a small proportion of calculated structures, there are two segments to strand E, E1 (Ile1618–Pro1620) and E2 (Trp1626–Tyr1629), interrupted by coil. Strand E1, which is assigned (within MolMol) in only a few structures, forms a small parallel β-sheet with strand C (Glu1579–Lys1584). In all of the C5-C345C structures, there is potential for H-bonds between the CO of Tyr1619 and the NH of Thr1581, and between the NH of residue Tyr1619 and CO of Ile1583, thus completing the hydrogen bond network that forms the barrel-like structure. Strand E2, which appears in all structures, is antiparallel to strand D (Gln1598–Gly1603). Thus the barrel has a “closed” side made up from the β-strands, and a more “open” side (to the right of the view in the left-hand panel of Fig. 3B) occupied by Tyr1619 and the residues prior to E2.

Eukaryotic integral membrane proteins are predominantly α-helical proteins that span the membrane several times. The most frequent approach to identifying transmembrane-helix amino acids essential for function is to substitute native residues, one at a time, with Cys or Ala (Cys- and Ala-scanning mutagenesis). Here, we present a new approach, in which complete transmembrane-helix native sequences are substituted with poly-Ala sequences. We show that the basic functional features of two dissimilar membrane proteins, which function as a channel and a pump, respectively, are maintained when certain individual α-helices are replaced with poly-Ala sequences. This approach (“helix-scanning mutagenesis”) allows for rapid identification of helices containing residues essential for function and can be used as a primary helix-screening tool, followed by individual amino acid substitutions when specific helix poly-Ala replacements cause functional changes in the protein.

The hydrophobic amino acid residues Leu and Ala are the most frequently found in transmembrane helices (1Ulmschneider M.B. Sansom M.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1512: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Poly-Ala sequences capped with sequences such as those regularly found in inter-helical loops of membrane proteins form α-helices (2Miller J.S. Kennedy R.J. Kemp D.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The methyl side-chain group of Ala lacks unusual dihedral angle preference and does not contribute to hydrogen bonds. Ala-scanning mutagenesis takes advantage of these properties of Ala and has been used to identify the so-called functional epitopes, i.e. “hot spots,” in the structural epitope identified in high-resolution structures, which contribute most binding energy in protein-ligand interactions (3Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 244: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). Recent years have seen significant progress in understanding the structure-function of complex membrane proteins 1White, S. H. (2004) Protein Sci.13, 1948–1949.; however, our current knowledge of these important molecules is still very limited. Membrane proteins tolerate individual amino acid substitutions at most positions (5Frillingos S. Sahin-Toth M. Wu J. Kaback H.R. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1281-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). If some α-helices in membrane proteins do not contain residues required for proper helix packing, then it may be possible to replace them completely while preserving function. Here, we present a simplified approach of multiple simultaneous mutagenesis, i.e. the replacement of complete transmembrane helices of membrane proteins with poly-Ala sequences (helix-scanning mutagenesis), and its application to two dissimilar membrane transport proteins, a channel (connexin 43 (Cx43)) 2The abbreviations used are: Cx43, connexin 43; CL tMRP1, Cys-less MRP1 mutant with truncation of the first multispanning transmembrane domain TMD0; CF, 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein; E217βG, 17-β-estradiol 17-(β-d-glucuronide); LTC4, leukotriene C4; MRP1, multidrug-resistance protein ABCC1; TM6, MRP1 transmembrane segment 6; TM17, MRP1 transmembrane segment 17; WT, wild type; Cx43-Ala1, -Ala2, -Ala3, or -Ala4, Cx43 with complete replacement of transmembrane helices 1, 2, 3, or 4. and a pump (multi-drug-resistance protein MRP1). Plasmid Engineering—To generate the poly-Ala mutants, we first introduced unique restriction sites flanking the transmembrane helices of interest. Then, we replaced the DNA sequences coding for a specific transmembrane helix with a poly-Ala coding set of oligonucleotide adaptors ready for ligation to the cut sites of the plasmids. The stretches of amino acids replaced with Ala included Lys23–Glu42 (transmembrane segment 1), Arg76–Val96 (transmembrane segment 2), Gly150–Phe169 (transmembrane segment 3), and Thr207–Ile226 (transmembrane segment 4). For the Cx43 experiments, we used rat Cx43 into pOcyt7 (6Bao X. Altenberg G.A. Reuss L. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C647-C654Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Oocyte preparation and cRNA synthesis and injection were performed as described previously (6Bao X. Altenberg G.A. Reuss L. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C647-C654Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 7Bao X. Chen Y. Reuss L. Altenberg G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9689-9692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For the MRP1 experiments, we used YEp-CL tMRP1, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae plasmid suitable for the expression of TMD0-truncated Cys-less MRP1 (CL tMRP1) (see Fig. 3A). CL tMRP1 is a modified human MRP1 that starts at Asp204 and is devoid of Cys (8Lee S.H. Altenberg G.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 357-360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two constructs were generated for the MRP1 experiments. In one, the amino acid sequence including residues Thr320–Leu337 (transmembrane segment 6) was substituted with a poly-Ala sequence. In the second construct, the wild-type sequence Gly1228–Val1248 was substituted with a poly-Ala sequence. See supplementary material for details on the plasmid engineering procedures. DNA sequencing of all constructs was performed at the Protein Chemistry Core Laboratory of the University of Texas Medical Branch. Western Blots of Biotinylated Plasma Membrane Cx43—Two days after injection, the oocytes were subjected to membrane surface biotinylation with a cell-membrane-impermeable reagent. The oocytes were lysed and Cx43 was immunoprecipitated by overnight incubation with a specific anti-Cx43 antibody. The biotinylated proteins were detected by chemiluminescence on a blot probed with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase. Details on the methodology to assess plasma membrane expression in oocytes have been published previously (6Bao X. Altenberg G.A. Reuss L. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C647-C654Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Uptake of 5(6)-Carboxyfluorescein—Two days after cRNA injection, the oocytes were incubated for 40 min at 16 °C in ND96 solution (in mm, 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2, and 5 HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4) containing 2 mm CF. The low Ca solution was nominally Ca2+- and Mg2+-free ND96 containing 1 mm EDTA. After the 40-min uptake period, extracellular CF was removed by washing with ice-cold ND96 solution containing 10 μm Gd3+ to minimize leakage of intracellular CF via gap-junctional hemichannels during washing. Individual oocytes were lysed in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9, and CF was measured by spectrofluorometry as described previously (6Bao X. Altenberg G.A. Reuss L. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C647-C654Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Measurements of Gap-junctional Currents—Transjunctional currents were measured in paired oocytes. The vitelline membrane was manually removed 1 day after cRNA injection (9Methfessel C. Witzemann V. Takahashi T. Mishina M. Numa S. Sakmann B. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1986; 407: 577-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) before pairing the cells with the vegetal poles facing each other. The oocyte pairs were incubated in Barth's solution prior to the electrophysiological measurements using the dual two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique (7Bao X. Chen Y. Reuss L. Altenberg G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9689-9692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 10Spray D.C. Harris A.L. Bennett M.V. J. Gen. Physiol. 1981; 77: 77-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The paired cells were clamped at –60 mV, and a transjunctional potential was generated by stepping the voltage of one oocyte from –60 mV while holding constant the voltage of the other cell (used as reference). The current supplied to the cell clamped at –60 mV is equal in amplitude, but opposite in sign, to the transjunctional current. The transjunctional voltage was stepped from –120 to 120 mV for 10 s at 20-mV intervals, with 15-s intervals between pulses. MRP1 Expression, Preparation of Membranes, and LTC4 Uptake Measurements—S. cerevisiae yeast were grown in 1-liter flasks in SD-Leu medium (Q-Biogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 15% glycerol, as described previously (11Haimeur A. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41326-41333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Membrane preparation and Western blots to assess MRP1 expression were performed as described previously (8Lee S.H. Altenberg G.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 357-360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The primary antibody was the anti-MRP1 monoclonal antibody QCRL-1 (Kamiya Biochemical Company, Seattle, WA). The LTC4 uptake by membrane vesicles was determined by rapid filtration using radiolabeled LTC4 (8Lee S.H. Altenberg G.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 357-360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane vesicles from MRP1-expressing cells were incubated with LTC4 in the presence of 4 mm ATP or AMP and 10 mm Mg2+ (Mg-ATP sufficient to support maximal transport rates), and the membrane vesicle-associated radioactivity was monitored by rapid filtration (8Lee S.H. Altenberg G.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 357-360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the transport competition experiments, 50 μm 17-β-estradiol 17-(β-d-glucuronide) was added to LTC4-uptake samples 5 min before LTC4. Poly-Ala Cx43 Mutants Form Functional Gap-junctional Hemichannels—Gap junctions are cell-to-cell aqueous channels permeable to ions and hydrophilic molecules of Mr <1,000 (12Harris A.L. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2001; 34: 325-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They are formed by the head-to-head association of two connexons or gap-junctional hemichannels (connexin hexamers), one from each of the adjacent cells (13Saez J.C. Berthoud V.M. Branes M.C. Martinez A.D. Beyer E.C. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 1359-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1A). Gap-junctional channels are essential for cell-to-cell coupling, and hemichannels seem to perform important functions in physiological and pathophysiological conditions (12Harris A.L. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2001; 34: 325-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Saez J.C. Berthoud V.M. Branes M.C. Martinez A.D. Beyer E.C. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 1359-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). Individual replacement of each of the Cx43 transmembrane segments with poly-Ala sequences yielded mutant proteins that were expressed at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1B) and functional (Fig. 1C). We defined functional Cx43 mutant proteins as those capable of forming a plasma membrane-gated pore permeable to large hydrophilic solutes. We have recently shown that heterologous expression of recombinant Cx43 in single frog oocytes results in uptake of the Mr 376 hydrophilic probe CF via Cx43 hemichannels (6Bao X. Altenberg G.A. Reuss L. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C647-C654Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 7Bao X. Chen Y. Reuss L. Altenberg G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9689-9692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Fig. 1C shows that CF uptake is very low with normal extracellular [Ca2+] because of hemichannel block (12Harris A.L. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2001; 34: 325-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Pfahnl A. Dahl G. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1999; 437: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and that exposure to low [Ca2+] medium results in a significant increase in CF uptake in the poly-Ala mutants. This CF uptake is blocked by 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid and octanol (Fig. 1D), two blockers of gap-junctional channels and hemichannels (6Bao X. Altenberg G.A. Reuss L. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C647-C654Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 12Harris A.L. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2001; 34: 325-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that CF uptake in normal [Ca2+] is increased by the protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin C because of dephosphorylation of Ser368 of the C-terminal domain (6Bao X. Altenberg G.A. Reuss L. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C647-C654Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 15Bao X. Reuss L. Altenberg G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20058-20066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Calphostin C increased CF uptake in oocytes expressing Cx43 with transmembrane helix 4 replaced with a poly-Ala sequence (Cx43-Ala4, 7.9 ± 1.4-fold increase, n = 10, p < 0.0005), indicating that the permeability of mutant hemichannels is increased by lowering [Ca2+] and blocking protein kinase C, both known regulatory mechanisms of WT Cx43 gap-junctional channels and hemichannels (8Lee S.H. Altenberg G.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 357-360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Harris A.L. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2001; 34: 325-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Pfahnl A. Dahl G. Pfluegers Arch. Eur.

Formation of Functional Gap-junctional Channels by a Cx43 Poly-Ala Mutant—Large gap-junctional currents, such as those shown in Fig. 2A (top right), were easily measured in essentially all pairs of WT Cx43-expressing oocytes. Paired oocytes expressing poly-Ala mutants (n = 6–7 pairs per mutant) had no detectable gap-junctional currents (not shown), but Cx43-Ala4 formed gap-junctional channels with WT Cx43 (Fig. 2A, bottom right). Although there was some asymmetry in the time dependence of the junctional currents elicited by transjunctional voltage pulses in the WT-Ala4 gap-junctional channels (Fig. 2, WT-Ala4 trace and I-V curve), the voltage dependence of the current was generally conserved (slow inactivation at large membrane voltages). The magnitude of the gap-junctional currents cannot be easily quantified because of the time-dependent formation of the channels. However, WT Cx43/Cx43-Ala4 channels either form less efficiently or have lower conductance and/or open probability than WT Cx43 channels because the current amplitude 2 h after pairing was smaller than, and after 6 h (trace shown in Fig. 2A) was similar to, that of the WT Cx43 channels just 2 h after pairing (Fig. 2A, right panels). Fig. 2A (bottom left) also shows the absence of gap-junctional currents between an oocyte expressing WT Cx43 and another one expressing Cx43-Ala1 after overnight pairing. Junctional currents were also absent between one oocyte expressing WT Cx43 and another one expressing Cx43-Ala2 (n = 6) or Cx43-Ala3 (n = 6), even after overnight pairing (not shown). Application of Helix-scanning Mutagenesis to MRP1—To determine whether the helix-scanning mutagenesis technique can be applied to membrane proteins other than Cx43, we carried out additional experiments on MRP1 (ABCC1, see Fig. 3A), an ATP-binding cassette poly-specific pump responsible for some forms of multidrug resistance of cancer cells (17Deeley R.G.

Kuchler K. Higgins C.F. ABC Proteins. From Bacteria to Man. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2003: 3-35Google Scholar). MRP1 mediates ATP-dependent substrate efflux (18Dassa E. Holland I.B. Cole S.P.C. Kuchler K. Higgins C.F. ABC Proteins. From Bacteria to Man. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2003: 3-35Google Scholar). Several residues in TM17 interact with substrates such as E217βG, but there seems to be no specific interactions between TM17 residues and LTC4 (19Zhang D.W. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20934-20941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). LTC4 displays a high affinity for MRP1, with a Kd in the nm range (8Lee S.H. Altenberg G.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 357-360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Holland I.B. Cole S.P.C. Kuchler K. Higgins C.F. ABC Proteins. From Bacteria to Man. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2003: 393-422Google Scholar), and mutagenesis studies clearly point to several residues in TM6 as critical for the LTC4-MRP1 interaction (11Haimeur A. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41326-41333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). If TM17 does not play a role in the high-affinity transport of LTC4 and does not have a sequence-specific role in the structure of MRP1 (e.g. forming inter-helical hydrogen bonds essential for MRP1 helix packing), then it may be possible to retain LTC4 transport if all the TM17 residues are substituted with Ala. To test this hypothesis, we replaced complete α-helices (TM6 or TM17) of a functional MRP1 mutant, CL tMRP1. We have shown that CL tMRP1 transports LTC4 with efficiency similar to that of the wild-type MRP1 and displays a high affinity for this leukotriene (8Lee S.H. Altenberg G.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 357-360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, C and D, CL tMRP1 and both poly-Ala mutants are expressed in yeast membranes, and LTC4 transport was not affected by replacement of TM17 with the poly-Ala sequence. In contrast, the membranes containing the TM6 poly-Ala mutant displayed a large reduction of LTC4 transport, as expected from the known inhibition of LTC4 transport observed in response to mutations of polar TM6 residues (11Haimeur A. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41326-41333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The interaction of MRP1 with E217βG is known to be affected by substitutions of TM17 residues (19Zhang D.W. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20934-20941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As expected, the ability of E217βG to inhibit LTC4 uptake by the poly-Ala 17 mutant was reduced. At a concentration of 50 μm, E217βG reduced the 50-nm LTC4 uptake by CL tMRP1 (49 ± 4%, n = 4, p < 0.05) but not that by the poly-Ala 17 mutant (8 ± 5%, n = 4). Cx43 poly-Ala mutants can form hemichannels for which the permeability to large hydrophilic solutes is increased by lowering [Ca2+] and protein kinase C inhibition, and at least one of the complete-helix mutants (Cx43-Ala4) can form gap-junctional channels. The docking of hemichannels to form the gap-junctional channels depends on the structure of the two extracellular Cx loops, which are believed to form interdigitated β-sheets that insulate the channel from the extracellular solution (12Harris A.L. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2001; 34: 325-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gap-junctional channel formation by docking of connexons of different connexin composition (heterotypic channels) occurs only with certain isoforms. i.e. is highly selective (12Harris A.L. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2001; 34: 325-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A change in the conformation of the extracellular loops, preventing hemichannel docking, is likely in the poly-Ala mutants because of alterations in the packing of the transmembrane α-helices. Changes in helix packing of the poly-Ala mutants are likely because small residues such as Ala favor closer helix packing in membrane proteins (20Eilers M. Shekar S.C. Shieh T. Smith S.O.

Science. 2001; 294: 2158-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), indicate that several transmembrane segments form a single drug-binding pocket. This binding pocket is quite flexible, can bind more than one substrate at a time, and can accommodate a single compound in more than one orientation (4Watkins R.E. Wisely G.B. Moore L.B.

Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Brennan R.G. Science. 2001; 294: 2158-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In the case of MRP1, several transmembrane segments, including TM6 and TM17, have residues that interact with substrates (11Haimeur A. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41326-41333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 19Zhang D.W. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 46052-46063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The observation that LTC4 transport by MRP1 is not altered by replacement of TM17 with a poly-Ala sequence indicates that none of the many polar residues in TM17 is essential for expression and folding of MRP1 or interaction of the protein with LTC4. This and the large reduction in ATP-dependent LTC4 transport with the TM6 poly-Ala mutant are consistent with mutagenesis studies of individual TM6 and TM17 residues (11Haimeur A. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41326-41333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 19Zhang D.W. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20934-20941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and provide a validation of the helix-scanning methodology. The fact that all Cx43-Ala mutants form functional hemichannels suggests that none of the helices contains polar residues needed for the formation of a large pore permeable to hydrophilic solutes. Even though the basic functions of Cx43 and MRP1 are maintained in most poly-Ala mutants, variations in the primary sequence of the helices may tune these functions by alterations in helix packing and/or electrostatics, resulting in functional changes, e.g. pore size and substrate selectivity in the examples studied. The replacement of complete helices (“helix-scanning mutagenesis”), introduced here to identify those helices the primary sequence of which is essential for function, could prove very useful for studies of other membrane proteins. It is significantly less labor intensive than Cys- and Ala-scanning mutagenesis (3Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 244: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar, 5Frillingos S. Sahin-Toth M. Wu J. Kaback H.R. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1281-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) and can be used as a primary helix-screening tool followed by the traditional individual substitutions of residues in the poly-Ala replacement mutants that display functional changes. It is also possible that complete helix replacement may simplify the rational engineering of simple, stable proteins for specific applications, such as their use in sensing devices. We thank Drs.

https://openalex.org/W2060779030,"3′-(β-Chloroethyl)-2′,4′-dioxo-3,5′-spiro-oxazolidino-4-deacetoxyvinblastine (KAR-2) is a potent anti-microtubular agent that arrests mitosis in cancer cells without significant toxic side effects. In this study we demonstrate that in addition to targeting microtubules, KAR-2 also binds calmodulin, thereby countering the antagonistic effects of trifluoperazine. To determine the basis of both properties of KAR-2, the three-dimensional structure of its complex with Ca2+-calmodulin has been characterized both in solution using NMR and when crystallized using x-ray diffraction. Heterocorrelation (1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence) spectra of 15N-labeled calmodulin indicate a global conformation change (closure) of the protein upon its binding to KAR-2. The crystal structure at 2.12-Å resolution reveals a more complete picture; KAR-2 binds to a novel structure created by amino acid residues of both the N- and C-terminal domains of calmodulin. Although first detected by x-ray diffraction of the crystallized ternary complex, this conformational change is consistent with its solution structure as characterized by NMR spectroscopy. It is noteworthy that a similar tertiary complex forms when calmodulin binds KAR-2 as when it binds trifluoperazine, even though the two ligands contact (for the most part) different amino acid residues. These observations explain the specificity of KAR-2 as an anti-microtubular agent; the drug interacts with a novel drug binding domain on calmodulin. Consequently, KAR-2 does not prevent calmodulin from binding most of its physiological targets. 3′-(β-Chloroethyl)-2′,4′-dioxo-3,5′-spiro-oxazolidino-4-deacetoxyvinblastine (KAR-2) is a potent anti-microtubular agent that arrests mitosis in cancer cells without significant toxic side effects.

Consequently, KAR-2 does not prevent calmodulin from binding most of its physiological targets. Intracellular Ca2+ serves as a second messenger in response to external stimuli. The major Ca2+ receptor protein is calmodulin (CaM), 1The abbreviations used are: CaM, calmodulin; AAA, N-(3,3-diphenylpropyl)-N′-[1-R-(3,4-bisbutoxyphenyl)ethyl]-propylenediamine; TFP, trifluoperazine; KAR-2, 3′-(β-chloroethyl)-2′,4′-dioxo-3,5′-spiro-oxazolidino-4-deacetoxyvinblastine; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; CD, circular dichroism; PDB, Protein Data Bank. a ubiquitous, multifunctional protein that regulates at least 100 different proteins and enzymes. By assuming a new conformation upon binding that divalent cation, CaM transduces an elevation of intracellular Ca2+ levels to a change in enzyme activity (1Klee C.B. Vanaman T.C. Anfinsen C.B. Edsall J.T. Richards F.M. Advances in Protein Chemistry. 35. Academic Press, New York1982: 213-321Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures of apo-CaM and Ca2+·CaM have been determined by NMR and x-ray crystallography (3Zhang M. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Nat. Struct.

Structure (Lond.). 2003; 11: 1303-1307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). CaM has similar N- and C-terminal lobes, within each of which are two Ca2+-binding “EF-hand” motifs flanked by tightly structured domains (2Nakayama S. Kretsinger R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 473-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Upon binding Ca2+ ions, extensive hydrophobic surfaces become exposed to the solvent, promoting the interaction of CaM with target proteins. The CaM-binding domains of these target proteins are highly diverse in their amino acid sequences. One of the few unifying principles is the ability of all of these peptides to form basic, amphiphilic helices when complexed with Ca2+·CaM (9O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 59-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional structures of several ternary complexes of Ca2+·CaM and a peptide from a target enzyme have been solved. In all of them, the two domains of CaM wraps around the peptide, contacting hydrophobic residues in the pocket between them (it also makes some polar interactions with surrounding acidic side chains) (10Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar, 11Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A.

The flexibility of the CaM molecule facilitates its binding to diverse peptides; both the backbone of its central region and its methyl methionine side chains extend toward the hydrophobic pockets that it forms. The degree of domain closure of CaM varies among these complexes. In recently published works; however, some target proteins are found to bind CaM in alternative ways (13Vetter S.W. Leclerc E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 404-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Certain target peptides assume only partially helical conformation, whereas others bind to just one domain of CaM or to dimerized CaM. In one structure, three helices of the target peptide bind an extended form of CaM (14Drum C.L. Yan S.Z. Bard J. Shen Y.Q. Lu D. Soelaiman S. Grabarek Z. Bohm A. Tang W.J.

Phenothiazines, arylalkylamines, naphtalenesulfonamides, calmidazolium, and felodipine are widely used in studying CaM functions. With a few exceptions (e.g. calmidazolium, compound 48/80, and AAA), such chemical antagonists bind to CaM with much lower affinity than do peptides (19Johnson J.D. Mills J.S. Med. Res.

Using x-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, three-dimensional structures have been solved for complexes of CaM and such a competitive antagonists, i.e. with the phenothiazine TFP, with the naphthalenesulfonamide W7 (25Osawa M. Swindells M.B. Tanikawa J. Tanaka T. Mase T. Furuya T. Ikura M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and with the arylalkylamine derivative AAA (26Harmat V.

The hydrophobic pockets of CaM are the primary binding sites for each of these three compounds. Crystal structures are available for Ca2+·CaM complexed with TFP in several stoichiometries (1:1, 1:2, and 1:4) (27Vandonselaar M. Hickie R.A. Quail J.W. Delbaere L.T.J. Nature Struct.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15300-15310Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We have reported that in the case of the CaM·TFP2 complex, the binding of the second TFP to an interdomain site can only occur following a conformational change induced by the binding of the first TFP molecule in the hydrophobic pocket of the C-terminal domain. KARs are a series of semisynthetic bis-indol derivatives of vinblastine that block tubulin polymerization. Thereby they slow the growth of tumors yet exhibit lower toxicity to the host animal than does the parent compound (30Orosz F. Kova ́cs J. Lo ̋w P. Ve ́rtessy B.G. Urba ́nyi Z. A ́cs T. Keve T. Ova ́di J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 21: 947-954Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Following a screen of these compounds, we selected KAR-2 as the most effective antimitotic agent. The structure of KAR-2 is shown in Fig. 1, and its effect on cell viability, cell proliferation, and cell cycle in a neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y) has been described previously (31Comin-Anduix B. Agell N. Bachs O. Ovadi J. Cascante M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1235-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). At a concentration of the different compounds equivalent in causing 50% of inhibition of cell growth, KAR-2 induces complete arrest at the G2/M transition, whereas vinblastine induced partial arrest in both G0/G1 and G2/M. Moreover, the combination of KAR-2 and W13 (a naphthalenesulfonamide derivative with potent anti-CaM activity) arrests cancer cells both at the G0/G1 and the G2/M transition, an effect resembling that of vinblastine. Levels of Cdc2 are much higher in KAR-2-treated cells than in those treated with vinblastine, indicating a stronger mitotic arrest. The effects of KAR-2 and vinblastine on the microtubular network have been analyzed by immunocytochemistry using anti-tubulin antibody (31Comin-Anduix B. Agell N. Bachs O. Ovadi J. Cascante M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1235-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This deeper analysis of the two anti-cancer drugs reveals that KAR-2 causes the formation of aberrant mitotic spindles without effecting interphase microtubules, whereas vinblastine primarily damages the microtubule network of interphase cells. We demonstrated previously that KAR-2 and vinblastine bind to CaM with comparable affinity (both in the micromolar range). Unlike vinblastine, however, KAR-2 does not abolish CaM's inhibition of phosphofructokinase (32Orosz F. Ve ́rtessy B.G. Salerno C. Crifo C. Capuozzo E. Ova ́di J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 21: 955-962Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) nor does it fully block the binding of a monospecific antibody to CaM (33Molna ́r A. Liliom K. Orosz F. Ve ́rtessy B.G. Ova ́di J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 291: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the complex of CaM with KAR-2 might have distinct structural and functional properties from that with vinblastine. In the present work, we use binding and functional tests to determine the effect of KAR-2 on CaM-related processes. In addition, we use x-ray crystallography to determine the three-dimensional structure of the protein-drug complex and NMR spectroscopy to characterize the drug-binding site of the protein in solution. The resulting data contribute to an understanding of the role of CaM in cellular physiological, and they suggest what pharmacological intervention should be used to disrupt that function. Proteins—CaM was purified from bovine brain using phenyl-Sepharose chromatography (34Gopalakrishna R. Anderson W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 104: 830-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). For the NMR experiments, recombinant 15N-labeled CaM was used. The plasmid vector encoding chicken gizzard CaM (cloned into pET-21d between the NcoI and BamHI sites) was a kind gift of Akio Nakamura (Gunma University, Japan). CaM was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells. Uniform N15 labeling was achieved by growing 1 liter of culture with shaking at 37 °C in minimal medium containing 0.6% Na2HPO4, 0.3% KH2PO4, 0.05% NaCl, 0.4% glucose, 0.1% 15NH4Cl (Cambridge Isotope Labs), and ampicillin (50 μg/ml) until the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.6. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and cultures were harvested 3 h later. Cells were then centrifuged (3 min at 4000 × g), washed with 100 ml of cold distillated water, and frozen at -80 °C. After thawing, cells were homogenized on ice by sonication (Sonifer 200, Branson, Danbury, CT) for 1 min. The supernatant from ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C) was subjected to trichloreacetic acid precipitation of CaM. The recombinant CaM was further purified by column chromatography using 650 m butyl-Toyopearl (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan). Remaining minor contaminants were removed by Sephacryl S-200 (Amersham Biosciences). Pooled fractions containing CaM were stored at -80 °C. Bovine brain CaM was biotinylated with biotin-XX-SSE (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, product code B-6352) as described previously (35Kincaid R.L. Billingsley M.L. Vaughan M. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 605-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Phosphodiesterase Assay—CaM-activated cAMP phosphodiesterase activity was assayed using an enzyme-coupled system according to Chock and Huang (36Chock S. Huang C.Y. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 34-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The assay mixture contained 6 mm phosphoenol-pyruvate, 0.3 mm ATP, 1.2 mm cAMP, 0.1 mm NADH, 0.01 units (4 nm) phosphodiesterase, 60 units myokinase, 11 units pyruvate kinase, 16 units lactate dehydrogenase, and 20 nm CaM in 66 mm Tris buffer containing 54 mm KCl, 0.03 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5, at 30 °C. The reaction was started by addition of cAMP. All chemicals and enzymes used in the assay were purchased from Sigma. Surface Plasmon Resonance—Surface plasmon resonance measurements were performed using a Biacore X instrument. The Sensor Chip SA (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden, product code BR-1000–32) was activated with three consecutive injections of 20 μl of 1 m NaCl with 50 mm NaOH at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. 50 μg/ml biotinylated CaM was then injected over the streptavidin surface at 5 μl/min; the flow of the protein was stopped after the signal reached ∼1000 response units. Two channels of the chip were used, one covered with CaM and the other was left blank and used as a control surface. In each experiment, 50 μl of aldolase at various concentrations and both with and without drugs was injected onto the surface at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. Both the association and dissociation phases were monitored for 300 s. The measured sensorgrams were fitted to Langmuir 1:1 curves using the BiaEvaluation 3.0 software, and the kinetic parameters of the interaction between CaM and aldolase were thereby inferred. All experiments were performed at 25 °C, and the eluent contained 50 mm HEPES, 150 mm KCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 0.005% surfactant P20 at pH 7.0. After each aldolase injection, the CaM surface was regenerated by injecting 20 mm EGTA for 300 s. NMR Spectroscopy—15N-1H HSQC as well as 3-D HSQC-total correlation spectroscopy (mixing time 51.8 ms) and HSQC-nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (mixing time 90 ms) spectra of 15N-labeled CaM dissolved at a concentration of 1.2 mm in a 9:1 ratio of H2O/D2O containing 150 mm NaCl, 6.2 mm CaCl2, and 0.01% NaN3, pH 7.0, were recorded on a Bruker DRX 500 spectrometer at a temperature of 300 K. The spectrum of CaM alone was measured first, after which it was titrated by the stepwise addition of KAR-2 solution. A ratio of 1 part CaM to 1.5 parts KAR-2 was reached in five consecutive steps, thereby ensuring the saturation of CaM with that ligand. At each step in the titration, a complete 1H-15N HSQC spectrum was recorded. At the end of the titration, both total correlation spectroscopy and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy spectra were measured. Partial resonance assignment was carried out using the two types of three-dimensional spectra; HSQC-total correlation spectroscopy spectra were measured to match amino acid residues with absorbance peak, whereas HSQC-nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy measurements were necessary to establish sequential connectivity between the identified spin systems (37Talluri S. Wagner G. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1996; 112: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 38Mori S. Abeygunawardana C. Johnson M.O. van Zilj P.C. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1995; 108: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—CD spectra were recorded with a JASCO J-720 spectropolarimeter. Measurements were made at 25 °C in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.0, in the presence of 200 μm CaCl2 using a cuvette with a 1-cm path length. Spectra were recorded after a 5-min incubation of CaM with the drug(s), scanning each sample twice from 240–280 nm. In the case of three-part mixtures, the order of addition of ligands had no affect on the spectra. In the absence of CaM, no difference in the spectra was detected upon mixing vinblastine and TFP or KAR-2 and TFP. Spectral averaging and other mathematical operations were performed using the JASCO Standard Analysis software supplied by the instrument manufacturer. Crystallization—Crystals of the CaM·KAR-2 complex were obtained using the hanging drop method by co-crystallization of 1 mm CaM and an equivalent amount of KAR-2 in 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.00, containing 5 mm CaCl2. The reservoir solution was 50 mm sodium cacodylate adjusted to pH 4.7 and containing 5 mm CaCl2,10mm MgCl2, and 26% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000. The drop contained a mixture of 2 μl of protein solution and 2 μl of reservoir solution. The cryosolution contained 15% glycerol. Data were collected using the X11 beamline at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory Outstation at the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY, Hamburg, Germany). A single crystal was rotated by 75° intervals (oscillation angle = 0.4°) and a consecutive 120° rotation interval (oscillation angle 0.1°). Data were processed with the XDS program package; they were scaled, merged, and reduced with XSCALE (39Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3242) Google Scholar).

Refinement was carried out with the REFMAC5 program (42Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M.I. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). The final model contained residues 3–74 and 77–148, 4 calcium ions, 1 KAR-2 molecule, and 53 water molecules. The stereochemistry of the structure was assessed with PROCHECK (46Laskowski R.A.

When activated by Ca2+·CaM, the enzyme phosphodiesterase hydrolyzes the second messenger molecule cAMP. Fig. 2A shows the inhibition of phosphodiesterase activity by several antagonists of calmodulin: KAR-2, its parent molecule vinblastine, and TFP. Calmodulin-dependent phosphodiesterase activity is completely eliminated by sufficient concentrations of TFP and vinblastine (IC50 of 13.4 ± 4.9 μm and 188.4 ± 78.6 μm, respectively). KAR-2, by contrast, never decreases calmodulin-dependent phosphodiesterase activity below ∼50% of the starting level. (This degree of inhibition is achieved at a drug concentration of 20 μm.) In summary, the three drugs have dramatically different effects on such phosphodiesterase activity despite exhibiting similar affinities for CaM. We propose that KAR-2 interacts with a different binding domain of CaM from that targeted by TFP and vinblastine. To test this hypothesis, we measured CaM-activated phosphodiesterase activity in the presence of saturating concentrations of both TFP and KAR-2. The data in Fig. 2B show that the presence of KAR-2 reduces the inhibitory effect of TFP even at concentrations that would completely inhibit calmodulin-dependent phosphodiesterase activity in the absence of the former compound. In fact, in the presence of high concentrations of both drugs, phosphodiesterase activity is ∼50% of that observed with neither. In other words, calmodulin-dependent phosphodiesterase activity at saturating levels of KAR-2 is essentially independent of the concentration of TFP. We conclude that KAR-2 functions as a “liberator” of inactivated calmodulin, counteracting the antagonist effect of TFP. Binding Studies—Surface plasmon resonance experiments are carried out to characterize the effects of KAR-2 and other drugs on the interaction of CaM with target enzymes. To this end, biotinylated CaM is immobilized on a streptavidin-covered chip. This system is exposed to a mobile phase that contains aldolase as a target protein. The rational for using aldolase instead of phosphodiesterase in surface plasmon resonance measurements is that CaM has comparable binding affinities for aldolase as for the drugs used in this study. Consequently, meaningful data can be obtained using comparable concentrations of aldolase and drugs. Several successive experiments use the same calmodulin-coated chip that has been regenerated by washing with 20 mm EGTA. Fig. 3A shows the sensorgrams of aldolase binding measured at different concentrations of aldolase. Rate constants for association and dissociation and the equilibrium dissociation constant are inferred from these curves: ka = (617.0 ± 2.73) m-1 s-1, kd = (1.95*10-4 ± 1.86*10-5) s-1, and Kd = kd/ka = 3.16*10-7m. These values are in good agreement with data obtained previously by Orosz et al. (47Orosz F. Christova T.Y. Ova ́di J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 957: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The inset in Fig. 3A illustrates that the Req value (a measure of the quantity of the protein·protein complex) is directly proportional to the aldolase concentration. These control measurements demonstrate that 5 μm aldolase is an appropriate concentration for injected drugs to produce detectable perturbation of the system. According to our expectations, 20 μm TFP prevents the binding of aldolase to immobilized CaM. By contrast, KAR-2 only partially inhibits the association of aldolase with CaM (never more than 40% inhibition as shown in Fig. 3, B and C). These observations are consistent with earlier studies using fluorescence anisotropy in which we showed that KAR-2 only partially inhibits the formation of a CaM-phosphofructokinase complex (32Orosz F. Ve ́rtessy B.G. Salerno C. Crifo C. Capuozzo E. Ova ́di J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 21: 955-962Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In conclusion, these findings on protein association agree with those of the functional studies illustrated in Fig. 2; both observations are explained by positing that KAR-2 and TFP target different domains of CaM. In the one case, the KAR-2·CaM·enzyme ternary complex retains a conformation in which CaM partially activates the bound enzyme. By contrast, TFP·CaM binary complex cannot bind to the target enzyme because TFP and the enzyme compete for CaM binding. The former case resembles CaM complexed with the arylalkylamine derivative KHL-8430 and the target enzyme; however, CaM loses its activating effect in that situation (48Orosz F. Telegdi M. Liliom K. Solti M. Korbonits D. Ova ́di J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 38: 910-916PubMed Google Scholar). Structural Studies—To determine the structural basis of the remarkable functional properties of KAR-2, we decided to solve the structure of the CaM·KAR-2 complex both in crystals and in solution. Crystals of this complex are obtained by co-crystallizing KAR-2 and CaM, using conditions similar to those that produce CaM·TFP2 crystals (Ref. 29Ve ́rtessy B.G. Harmat V. Bo ̈cskei Z. Na ́ray-Szabo ́ G. Orosz F. Ova ́di J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15300-15310Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar and “Experimental Procedures”). The resulting structure of the CaM·KAR-2 complex is well defined by the electron density map except for residues Ala-1, Asp-2, Lys-75, Met-76 and the side chains of residues Lys-77, Asp-78, Asp-80, Lys-94, Leu-105, Arg-106, Lys-115, Glu-119, Glu-123, Arg-126, Ile-130, and Glu-139. The protein is in a closed compact conformation. The bound KAR-2 molecule is also well defined by its electron density map, being situated in an interdomain position between the N- and C-terminal lobes of CaM (Fig. 4, A and B). The compact conformation of CaM induced upon binding KAR-2 resembles that assumed by CaM when it is bound by TFP molecule or by most cognate peptides (10Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G.

https://openalex.org/W1975083601,"Crk-associated substrate lymphocyte type (Cas-L) is a docking protein that is heavily tyrosine phosphorylated by the engagement of β1 integrins in T cells. In the present study, we attempted to evaluate the role of Cas-L in the pathophysiology of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). Examination of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from ATL patients as well as ATL-derived T cell lines showed an elevation of Cas-L in these cells. We showed that tyrosine phosphorylation as well as expression of Cas-L was markedly elevated through the induction of human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) Tax in JPX-9 cells, with these cells showing marked motile behavior on the ligands for integrins. We next performed yeast two-hybrid screening of cDNA library from an HTLV-I-transformed T cell line, which resulted in the identification of Tax as a putative binding partner for Cas-L. Co-precipitation experiments revealed that the serine-rich region of Cas-L might serve as the binding site with the highest affinity for Tax. Co-localization study showed that Tax and Cas-L partly merged in the cytoplasm. Finally, we showed that exogenous Cas-L inhibited Tax-mediated transactivation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), while Tax-independent activation of NF-κB remained intact, hence indicating that Cas-L might specifically regulate Tax-NF-κB pathway."

We have probed residues potentially involved in catalysis by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutation of His320, a residue predicted from sequence analysis to belong to the catalytic triad of the enzyme, considerably slowed down the second half-reaction. This kinetic manipulation provoked an accumulation of the reaction intermediate, which could be trapped and characterized by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. As expected, mutation of Asp126 totally abolished the activity of the enzyme from its crucial function as nucleophile involved in the formation of the alkylenzyme. In line with its role as the partner of His320 in the “charge relay system,” mutation of Asp285 dramatically reduced the rate of catalysis. However, the mutant D285L still exhibited a very low residual activity, which, by structural analysis and mutagenesis, has been tentatively attributed to Glu195, another acidic residue of the active site. Our studies have also confirmed the fundamental role of the conserved Tyr175 and Tyr255 residues, which are believed to activate the oxirane ring. Finally, we have determined the secondary tritium kinetic isotope effects on the epoxide opening step of 9,10-epoxystearate. The large observed values, i.e.T(V/Km) ≈ 1.30, can be interpreted by the occurrence of a very late transition state in which the epoxide bond is broken before the nucleophilic attack by Asp126 takes place.

It was initially suggested that these enzymatic reactions might proceed via a nucleophilic attack by a water molecule assisted by a catalytic histidine acting as a general base (1DuBois G.C. Appella E. Levin W. Lu A.Y.H. Jerina D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2932-2939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Bell P.A. Kasper C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14011-14017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An alternative mechanism, involving the formation of an alkylenzyme intermediate, was first thought to be improbable, because no kinetic evidence for its occurrence could be obtained and also because experiments specifically set up to trap such a covalent intermediate had failed (3Armstrong R.N. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 22: 39-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, the cloning of several epoxide hydrolases from mammals, but also from fungi, bacteria, and plants, has since changed dramatically this point of view. Thus, sequence alignments have revealed that epoxide hydrolases share with bacterial haloalkane dehalogenases, i.e. enzymes belonging to the α/β-hydrolase fold superfamily of enzymes, many structural features including conserved residues known to be essential for catalytic activity. The haloalkane dehalogenases possess in their active site a nucleophile-His-acid catalytic triad of residues. During the catalyzed reaction, an Asp is acting in the first step (dehalogenation) as a nucleophile leading to the formation of a covalent alkylenzyme intermediate (4Verschueren K.H. Seljee F.

The third member of the triad, another acidic residue, is thought to activate the above His via the so-called charge relay system.By inference, it was postulated that epoxide hydrolases belong to the α/β-hydrolase family (6Pries F.

In analogy to the dehalogenases, a covalently bound ester intermediate is formed in a first step by an attack of the epoxide by a nucleophilic Asp residue. In a second step, the Asp-His pair of the active site might activate a water molecule that hydrolyzes the intermediate, and the reaction product is released. Because this latter half-reaction is rate-limiting in most EHs studied, the alkylenzyme intermediate, which accumulates under steady-state conditions, could be trapped (12Pinot F. Grant D.F.

(ii) A pull mechanism, in which the epoxide ring is first destabilized by strong interactions with e.g. hydrogen bonding residues that polarize the scissile bond. Accordingly, the formation of the alkylenzyme would thus be a consequence of the epoxide destabilization rather than the cause, i.e. the reaction is more SN1-like (23Moussou P. Archelas A. Baratti J. Furstoss R. J. Org. Chem. 1998; 63: 3532-3537Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar).In contrast to the wealth of studies on the mechanism of mammalian and bacterial epoxide hydrolases, little work has been devoted to plant epoxide hydrolases. Based on sequence analysis of EHs isolated from different plants (24Kiyosue T. Beetham J.K. Pinot F. Hammock B.D. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Shinozaki K.

Planta. 2003; 216: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), it was hypothesized that these enzymes have a catalytic mechanism akin to that of the other α/β-hydrolases and involves, for example, the formation of a covalent alkylenzyme intermediate (29Morisseau C. Beetham J.K. Pinot F. Debernard S. Newman J.W. Hammock B.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 378: 321-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). During recent years, we have investigated the properties of purified and recombinant soybean epoxide hydrolases. Interestingly, these enzymes present a strict enantioselectivity, e.g. toward 9,10-epoxystearic acid, a likely endogenous substrate involved in the biosynthesis of cutin monomers (30Blée E. Schuber F. Plant J. 1993; 4: 113-123Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 31Summerer S. Hanano A. Utsumi S. Arand M. Schuber F. Blée E. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 471-480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, 9R,10S-epoxystearic acid is the preferred substrate, but importantly, both enantiomers of 9,10-epoxystearic acid yield the same enantiopure product, 9R,10R-dihydroxystearic acid. In sharp contrast, most soluble mammalian epoxide hydrolases do not exhibit such stereoselective reactions (31Summerer S. Hanano A. Utsumi S. Arand M. Schuber F. Blée E. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 471-480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To better comprehend the origin of this enantioselectivity, which will be discussed in a separate report, 2M. Flenet, S. Summerer, M. Arand, F. Schuber, and E. Blée, manuscript in preparation. 2M. Flenet, S. Summerer, M. Arand, F. Schuber, and E. Blée, manuscript in preparation. it was of great importance to progress in our understanding of the molecular mechanism of plant EHs. It should be noted that such issues, which are of interest from a mechanistic standpoint, are also highly relevant in the bioengineering of enzymes that can be used in biotransformations and in chemoenzymatic synthesis of chiral building blocks used for the production of bioactive compounds (32Archelas A. Furstoss R. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2001; 5: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar).To elucidate the molecular mechanism of recombinant soybean epoxide hydrolase, we have studied the incidence on catalysis of site-directed mutagenesis of residues Asp126, His320, and Asp285, which from sequence alignments with other EHs, were predicted to constitute the catalytic triad of this enzyme (33Arahira M. Nong V.H. Udaka K. Fukazawa C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2649-2657Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We could demonstrate the formation of an alkylenzyme intermediate, which in contrast to most EHs studied so far, was rate-limiting, and this was achieved by mass spectrometry. Finally, to gain a better understanding of the catalytic mechanism leading to the alkylenzyme intermediate and to solve the question of the driving force involved in the epoxide ring opening, we have studied secondary kinetic isotopic effects. The results obtained are much in favor of a very late transition state in the ring opening step.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Commonly used chemicals and reagents were of the highest purity available. Purified oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis and DNA sequencing were provided either by Invitrogen, Custom Primers, or Eurogentec. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow affinity gel was from Qiagen. [9,10-3H]Oleic acid (5.0 Ci/mmol) and [1-14C]oleic acid (52 Ci/mole) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.Site-directed Mutagenesis—The mutations were carried out using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. Mutations were introduced by PCR amplification of the entire expression plasmid using two mutated oligonucleotide primers. The sequences of the sense primers were the following, with the modified codons underlined and the nucleotide changes indicated in bold: D126E; 5′-G-GCT-CAT-GAA-TGG-GGA-GCC-ATC-ATA-GG; D126C, 5′-G-GCT-CAT-TGC-TGG-GGA-GGC-ATC-ATA-GG; D126L, 5′-G-GCT-CAT-CTC-TGG-GGA-GGC-ATC-ATA-GG; D285C, 5′-GGT-GAG-TTG-TGC-ATG-GTA-TAC-AAC-TCG; D285L, 5′-GGT-GAG-TTG-CTC-ATG-GTA-TAC-AAC-TCG; D285E, 5′-GGT-GAG-TTG-GAA-ATG-GTA-TAC-AAC-TCG; E195A, 5′-G-GCT-GAA-GTT-GGC-ACT-GCT-TAT-GTT-CTC-AAA-AAC-ATC-C; H320Y, 5′-GGA-GTG-GCT-TAC-TTC-AAT-AAT-CAA-GAA-GC; Y175S, 5′-GGA-GAC-GAC-TAC-TCT-GTC-TGC-AGA-TTT-CAG; Y255F, 5′-GGA-CCC-TTG-AAC-TAC-TTC-AGA-AAT-TTC-AAC-TTA-AAT-TGG; Y255H, 5′-CCC-TTG-AAC-TAC-CAC-AGA-AAT-TTC-AAC-TTA-AAT-TGG. Resulting EH clones were sequenced on both strands to confirm the mutation and ensure sequence fidelity.Expression and Purification of Epoxide Hydrolase—Both wild-type and mutant epoxide hydrolase were expressed using the plasmid vector PVT102U in Saccharomyces cerevisiae WA6, as described earlier (31Summerer S. Hanano A. Utsumi S. Arand M. Schuber F. Blée E. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 471-480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A hexahistidine tag attached to the C-terminal extremities of these proteins allowed their purification on metal affinity columns (31Summerer S. Hanano A. Utsumi S. Arand M. Schuber F. Blée E. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 471-480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The level of expression of the mutants was similar to those of the wild-type EH, as revealed by Western blot detection using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid alkaline phosphatase conjugates according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Qiagen).Preparation of Epoxides—Racemic-tritiated or 14C-labeled epoxides were prepared chemically from [9,10-3H]- and [1-14C]oleic acid, respectively (34Blée E. Schuber F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12887-12894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of pure 9S,10R-epoxystearate was based on the high enantioselectivity exhibited by soybean epoxide hydrolase, which preferentially hydrolyzes the 9R,10S-epoxystearate enantiomer (35Blée E. Schuber F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11881-11887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For this purpose, 3H/14C-labeled racemic 9,10-epoxystearic acid (2 μm) was incubated with soybean epoxide hydrolase (1 μg) in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4.(final volume 400 μl) for 4 min at 26 °C. After the addition of acetonitrile, the residual epoxide was purified by TLC using n-hexane:diethyl ether:formic acid (50:50:1) as a solvent system. After methylation with ethereal diazomethane, this epoxide was found to consist of 9S,10R-epoxystearate with >99% enantiomeric excess when analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography on a Chiracel OD column.Hydrolysis of Epoxides—Enzymatic hydrolysis of epoxides was performed as described previously (31Summerer S. Hanano A. Utsumi S. Arand M. Schuber F. Blée E. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 471-480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the kinetic constants, i.e. Km and Vmax, were determined using purified wild-type and mutant EHs. Initial rates were determined under conditions where rates were proportional to enzyme concentrations (up to 1 μg for purified enzymes) and the reaction progress was linearly dependent upon time (<10% of substrate transformation). The specific activities determined on soluble fractions of crude yeast extracts were obtained with the same quantities of protein as assessed by SDS-PAGE and density scanning.Determination of the Formation of a Covalent Intermediate by Mass Spectrometry—9,10-Epoxystearic acid (2 mm) was incubated in the presence of purified soybean epoxide hydrolase H320Y mutant (6 μg) in ammonium acetate buffer (25 mm, pH 5.0, final volume 100 μl) for 10 min at room temperature. The sample was then diluted to 15 μm (in enzyme) in a 1:1 water:acetonitrile mixture (v/v), acidified with 1% formic acid, which allowed measurement of molecular weights with good precision (<0.01%). Electrospray ionization mass spectrometric studies were performed on a BioQ triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Waters-Micromass) upgraded to Quattro II performance standards. Ions were detected below m/z 4000 at the exit of the first analyzer. Mass spectra were recorded in the positive ion mode on the mass range m/z 500–1500 at an accelerating rate of 60 V. Calibration of the instrument was performed using the multiply charged ions produced by horse heart myoglobin (Sigma) diluted to 2 μm in a 1:1 water:acetonitrile (acidified with 1% formic acid) mixture.Secondary Kinetic Isotope Effects—Kinetic isotope effects were measured by adapting the protocol described by Kohen et al. (36Kohen A. Jonsson T. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2603-2611Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Typically, a mixture (2 μl) of [9,10-3H]9,10-epoxystearic acid (0.6 μCi) and [1-14C]9,10-epoxystearic acid (0.06 μCi) in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. (300 μl), was pre-equilibrated at 26 °C, and three zero time points (t0) of 50 μl each were removed. The reaction was initiated by the addition of soybean epoxide hydrolase (0.5 μg), and aliquots of the reaction mixture were removed at 10 time points (tf) and quenched with acetonitrile (50 μl). The quenched samples were analyzed by 14C radio detection TLC (35Blée E. Schuber F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11881-11887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to determine the extent of conversion of the epoxide into diol. Bands corresponding to diols were then scraped off the plate, eluted with dichloromethane, and the tritium:14C ratio in these reaction products were measured by liquid scintillation counting using a standard predefined dual label program. The isotope ratios [3H/14C]f and [3H/14C]∞, respectively, at the given time points and after complete transformation of the substrate, were determined. Because of the high enantioselectivity of the recombinant soybean EH, the hydrolysis of racemic 9,10-epoxystearate could be treated conveniently as a succession of two reactions involving first the transformation of the preferentially hydrolyzed 9R,10S enantiomer (up to 50% reaction progress) followed by the hydrolysis of the opposite 9S,10R enantiomer. The secondary kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) on formation of [9,10-3H]9,10-dihydroxystearic acid from the two epoxide enantiomers were calculated according to Equation 1, T(V/K)=ln(1−f)/ln{1−f[(3H/C14)f/(3H/14C)∞]}(Eq. 1) where f is the fractional conversion of each light isotope containing the 9,10-epoxystearate enantiomer as derived from the TLC 14C counting. Because the substrate isotopic 3H/14C ratio at t0 was equal to the 3H/14C ratio in the products at t∞, an average of the t0 was used as (3H/14C)∞ in Equation 1. The validity of this approach was established by showing that the calculated KIEs (= T(V/Km) in Equation 1) were independent of the reaction progress; e.g. the S.D. were <3% for 7–9 time points spanning an important fractional conversion of the substrate. KIEs on the chemical hydrolysis of racemic 9,10-epoxystearic acid were obtained similarly by following the formation of 9,10-dihydroxystearic acid from a mixture of 9,10-3H- and 1-14C-labeled epoxides incubated at 25 °C in a mixture of tetrahydrofuran:water (50:50, v/v) containing 0.6% perchloric acid. In this case, however, as for the enzymatic hydrolysis of enantiopure 9S,10R-epoxystearate, a single exponential progress curve was observed and f (Equation 1) covered the total reaction (100% of reaction progress).Analytical Procedures—Radioactivity was measured on TLC plates with a Berthold TLC linear detector LB 2821, and peak integration was obtained by using the program CHROMA 1D (Packard Instrument Company). Radioactivity was also determined in a liquid scintillation spectrometer (LS 9000, Beckman).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIn this work, we addressed three main issues pertaining to the mechanism of recombinant soybean epoxide hydrolase: (i) the experimental confirmation of the key catalytic residues, (ii) the occurrence of a two-step kinetic mechanism involving the formation of a transient covalent substrate-enzyme intermediate and identification of the rate-determining step of the catalytic process, and (iii) the molecular mechanism of the epoxide ring opening step.The Occurrence of a Stable Covalent Intermediate Cannot Be Demonstrated Experimentally in Reactions Catalyzed by Wild-type Soybean Epoxide Hydrolase—To confirm that soybean EH-catalyzed reactions proceed via a two-step mechanism, as demonstrated previously with mammalian and bacterial EHs, we have attempted to trap the postulated α-hydroxyalkylenzyme intermediate resulting from the opening of the epoxide by the putative nucleophilic Asp126 residue. For that purpose, we have incubated the enzyme in the presence of [1-14C]9,10-epoxystearic acid and precipitated the mixture with an acidified solvent. This technique, which was successfully used for labeling, e.g. murine epoxide hydrolase with juvenile hormone III as substrate (15Hammock B.D. Pinot F. Beetham J.K. Grant D.F. Arand M.E. Oesch F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 850-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), did not permit the isolation of a labeled reaction intermediate in our case. Further attempts to covalently bind 9,10-epoxystearic acid to soybean epoxide hydrolase by varying the reaction conditions, including several enzyme or substrate concentrations with increasing incubation times, have all failed (not shown). Thus, we switched to a procedure that permitted a direct visualization of an enzyme–substrate ester bond in the soluble and membrane-bound mammalian rat EH-catalyzed transformation of [1-14C]9,10-epoxystearic acid (37Muller F. Arand M. Frank H. Seidel A. Hinz W. Winkler L. Hanel K. Blée E. Beetham J.K. Hammock B.D. Oesch F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 490-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Accordingly, soybean epoxide hydrolase was incubated in the presence of labeled substrate, and after precipitation with acetone, the protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE and bound radioactivity detected by fluorography. This approach also proved unsuccessful (results not shown). Finally, we used hydroxylamine as an exogenous nucleophile, which could, in principle, compete with the water molecule that hydrolyzes the alkylenzyme ester bond and produce a hydroxamate derivative of Asp126, which results in an inactivation of the enzyme. Such a strategy was used successfully to demonstrate the occurrence of a covalent intermediate in reactions catalyzed by L-2 haloacid dehalogenase, i.e. an enzyme mechanistically related to epoxide hydrolases (38Liu J.Q. Kurihara T. Miyagi M. Tsunasawa S. Nishihara M. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3363-3368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, unlike the dehalogenase, soybean EH was not inhibited by hydroxylamine (up to 0.5 m), suggesting that the ester bond of the putative alkylenzyme intermediate was not accessible to nucleophiles other than water.Our inability to detect a covalent intermediate during the transformation of 9,10-epoxy-stearic acid by soybean EH might be explained by considering the relative rates of the two steps of the catalytic process (Equation 2, where E-I is the alkylenzyme). E+Sk1⇋k−1E⋅Sk2⇋k−2E-Ik3→ E⋅Pk4⇋k−4E+P(Eq. 2) In the mammalian and bacterial epoxide hydrolases studied so far, the hydrolytic cleavage of the alkylenzyme intermediate, i.e. the dealkylation step k3 in Equation 2, is rate-limiting; this kinetic barrier allows a significant accumulation of the intermediate, which can thus be trapped (14Rink R. Janssen D.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 18119-18127Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 17Tzeng H.F. Laughlin L.T. Lin S. Armstrong R.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 9436-9437Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We speculated that if conversely, in soybean EH, the breakdown of the intermediate of the enzyme is more rapid than the alkylation step (k2 in Equation 2), this change in the rate-limiting step might hinder the accumulation of E-I and make it more difficult to evidence. This would not be without precedent because a fungal EH was also suggested to have a slow alkylation step (39Arand M. Hemmer H. Durk H. Baratti J. Archelas A. Furstoss R. Oesch F. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).To test this hypothesis, we have attempted to turn the second half-reaction (reaction k3) into the rate-determining step of the catalyzed reaction by slowing down the hydrolysis of the putative alkylenzyme. This was achieved by mutating His320, the conserved residue suggested to activate the water molecule involved in the hydrolytic cleavage of the ester bond of the alkylenzyme intermediate.Formation of a Stable Covalent Intermediate Evidenced by Mass Spectrometry in a His320→ Tyr Mutant—Replacement of His320 by a tyrosine gave a mutant that could be expressed in yeast in quantities similar to the wild-type enzyme. Compared with the wild-type enzyme, dramatic changes were observed in the transformation of [1-14C]-9,10-epoxystearic acid catalyzed by the purified H320Y mutant (Fig. 1). Because of its low residual activity (<1/1500 of wild-type soybean EH activity), this mutant was used in a concentration range (about 7 μm) that was close to that of the labeled substrate (peak 3). As shown in Fig. 1, when aliquots of the reaction medium were directly spotted on a TLC plate, a new radioactive peak (peak 1) appeared within a few seconds, whereas essentially no diol (peak 2) could be detected during the first hour of incubation. The peak, which did not migrate under our conditions, accounted (after a few minutes) for most of the radioactivity used in the assay. Peak 1 then slowly evolved with time yielding the expected product, 9,10-dihydroxystearate (peak 2). This behavior strongly supported the idea that peak 1 on the base line corresponded to a stable substrate-enzyme adduct, which is turned over only very slowly and which could thus be amenable to further characterization. Importantly, no similar changes of substrate could be observed in control incubations using heat-inactivated mutant or wild-type soybean EH.To verify whether a covalent alkylenzyme"
https://openalex.org/W1981240599,"UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc) and glycogen levels in skeletal muscle fibers of defined fiber type were measured using microanalytical methods. Infusing rats with insulin increased glycogen in both Type I and Type II fibers. Insulin was without effect on UDP-Glc in Type I fibers but decreased UDP-Glc by 35–40% in Type IIA/D and Type IIB fibers. The reduction in UDP-Glc suggested that UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase (PPL) activity might limit glycogen synthesis in response to insulin. To explore this possibility, we generated mice overexpressing a UDP-Glc PPL transgene in skeletal muscle. The transgene increased both UDP-Glc PPL activity and levels of UDP-Glc in skeletal muscles by ∼3-fold. However, overexpression of UDP-Glc PPL was without effect on either the levels of skeletal muscle glycogen or glucose tolerance in vivo. The transgene was also without effect on either control or insulin-stimulated rates of 14C-glucose incorporation into glycogen in muscles incubated in vitro. The results indicate that UDP-Glc PPL activity is not limiting for glycogen synthesis.

The results indicate that UDP-Glc PPL activity is not limiting for glycogen synthesis. Glycogen synthesis by skeletal muscle is of critical importance in the control of blood glucose levels by insulin. Skeletal muscle is the major site of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, and most of the glucose taken up by muscle in response to insulin is deposited as glycogen (1Jue T. Rothman D.L. Shulman G.I. Tavitian B.A. DeFronzo R.A. Shulman R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1439-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This synthetic pathway begins with glucose transport, which is activated strongly by insulin (2Koistinen H.A. Zierath J.R. Ann. Med. 2002; 34: 410-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Intracellular glucose is phosphorylated rapidly by hexokinase to form glucose 6-phosphate (Glu-6-P), 1The abbreviations used are: Glu-6-P, glucose 6-phosphate; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; EDL, extensor digitorum longus; Glu-1-P, glucose 1-phosphate; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; MDH, malate dehydrogenase; PPL, pyrophosphorylase. which is isomerized to glucose 1-phosphate (Glu-1-P) by phosphoglucomutase. Uridine diphosphoglucose (UDP-Glc) pyrophosphorylase (PPL) then utilizes UTP and Glu-1-P to form UDP-Glc, the immediate precursor for glycogen synthesis. The final step in which the glucosyl unit from UDP-Glc is used to extend the glycogen polymer is catalyzed by glycogen synthase, which is also activated by insulin (3Lawrence Jr., J.C. Roach P.J. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 541-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the first and last steps in the glycogen synthetic pathway are controlled by insulin. Insulin promotes the movement of the glucose transporter, GLUT4, from intracellular compartments to the cell surface (2Koistinen H.A. Zierath J.R. Ann. Med. 2002; 34: 410-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The resulting increase in glucose transport and phosphorylation results in an increase in the intracellular concentration of Glu-6-P, which is an allosteric activator of glycogen synthase (3Lawrence Jr., J.C. Roach P.J. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 541-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glycogen synthase activity is also controlled by multisite phosphorylation (3Lawrence Jr., J.C. Roach P.J. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 541-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the appropriate sites inactivates glycogen synthase; however, at sufficiently high concentrations, Glu-6-P is able to activate even highly phosphorylated forms of the enzyme. Insulin promotes dephosphorylation of several sites in glycogen synthase, resulting in an increase in Glu-6-P-independent activity as well as a decrease in the Ka for Glu-6-P (3Lawrence Jr., J.C. Roach P.J. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 541-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, glycogen synthase activity is coupled to glucose transport via changes in intracellular Glu-6-P (4Shulman R.G. Bloch G. Rothman D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8535-8542Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The relative contributions of glucose transport and glycogen synthase to the stimulation of glycogen synthesis by insulin have been debated for many years (3Lawrence Jr., J.C. Roach P.J. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 541-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Shulman R.G. Bloch G. Rothman D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8535-8542Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Studies in transgenic mice have demonstrated that sufficiently increasing either glycogen synthase or glucose transporter proteins in skeletal muscle results in glycogen accumulation (5Azpiazu I.

Chem. 1993; 268: 16113-16115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Elegant noninvasive methods involving NMR spectroscopy have been used to investigate the control of glycogen synthesis in vivo (4Shulman R.G. Bloch G. Rothman D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8535-8542Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 9Roden M. Shulman G.I. Annu. Rev. Med. 1999; 50: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Application of these methods has revealed that insulin promotes an increase in Glu-6-P content in skeletal muscle (10Rothman D.L. Magnusson I. Cline G. Gerard D. Kahn C.R. Shulman R.G. Shulman G.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 983-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), consistent with the stimulatory effect of insulin on glucose transport and phosphorylation. By mass action, an increase in Glu-6-P would be expected to increase levels of downstream intermediates in the glycogen synthesis pathway. However, this is not necessarily the case because a sufficient increase in Glu-6-P would activate glycogen synthase, thereby increasing the rate of utilization of UDP-Glc. A limitation of the NMR method is the lack of sufficient sensitivity to measure such intermediates, and there is evidence that Glu-6-P is not a predictor of levels of UDP-Glc. In glucose-clamped rats, hyperinsulinemia increased Glu-6-P in rectus abdominis muscle, but decreased UDP-Glc (11Rossetti L. Hu M. J. Clin.

Although indicative of significant stimulatory effects of insulin on both glucose transport and glycogen synthase activity, these findings suggest that the UDP-Glc PPL reaction might limit glycogen synthesis in the presence of insulin. A complicating factor in interpreting the measurements of metabolites in vivo is the fact that the fibers found in most skeletal muscles are heterogeneous, differing not only in contractile speed but also in metabolic potential (12Hintz C.S. Lowry C.V. Kaiser K.K. McKee D. Lowry O.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1980; 239: C58-C65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Peter J.B. Barnard R.J. Edgerton V.R. Gillespie C.A. Stempel K.E.

Fibers may be assigned to different classes, or types, based on the activities of representative enzymes of energy metabolism (12Hintz C.S. Lowry C.V. Kaiser K.K. McKee D. Lowry O.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1980; 239: C58-C65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Peter J.B. Barnard R.J. Edgerton V.R. Gillespie C.A. Stempel K.E.

Type I fibers have relatively low levels of glycolytic enzymes and high levels of oxidative enzymes. Type I fibers also have a slow twitch speed and are resistant to fatigue because most of their energy is derived from oxidative metabolism. Type IIB fibers have relatively high levels of glycolytic enzymes and low levels of oxidative enzymes. Type IIB fibers also have a fast twitch speed and depend largely on glycogen metabolism to provide the energy to fuel rapid and forceful contractions. Type IIA and IID fibers have a fast twitch speed and high levels of both glycolytic and oxidative enzymes (15Hamalainen N. Pette D. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1993; 41: 733-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The effect of insulin on glucose transport is highest in muscles composed predominantly of oxidative fiber types (16Kraegen E.W. James D.E. Jenkins A.B. Chisholm D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: E353-E362PubMed Google Scholar), and the amount of GLUT4 correlates directly with the levels of enzymes of oxidative energy metabolism, such as malate dehydrogenase (MDH) (17Kong X. Manchester J. Salmons S. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12963-12967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present study was conducted to investigate the role of UDP-Glc PPL in the stimulation of glycogen synthesis by insulin. Using microanalytical techniques to measure directly UDP-Glc and glycogen in single manually dissected muscle fibers of defined muscle fiber type, we demonstrate that insulin decreases UDP-Glc in Type II fibers. We also generated transgenic mice overexpressing UDP-Glc PPL in skeletal muscle to test the hypothesis that UDP-Glc PPL activity limits the insulin-stimulated rate of glycogen synthesis. Glucose Clamps—Male rats (Sprague-Dawley, ∼250 g) were allowed free access to food and water. Rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital before glucose clamps were applied essentially as described previously (18Rattigan S. Clark M.G. Barrett E.J. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1381-1388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, insulin (10 milliunits/min/kg) or an equal volume of saline was infused via a cannula in the jugular vein. The insulin infusion increased circulating insulin to ∼400 microunits/ml. Glucose was monitored continuously in blood obtained from a cannula in the carotid artery, and blood glucose was held constant by adjusting the rate of infusion of a solution containing 30% glucose into the femoral vein. After 2 h, the abdomen was opened and the rectus abdominis muscle was freeze-clamped with aluminum tongs that had been chilled in liquid nitrogen. The muscles were stored in liquid nitrogen then freeze-dried at –35 °C and kept under vacuum at –70 °C before use. Single Muscle Fiber Analyses—Single fibers were dissected manually from the muscle samples (19Lowry C.V. Kimmey J.S. Felder S. Chi M.M.Y. Kaiser K.K. Passonneau P.N. Kirk K.A. Lowry O.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8269-8277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and pieces of the fibers for analyses were weighed using a quartz fiber fish pole balance (20Passonneau J.V. Lowry O.H. Enzymatic Analysis: A Practical Guide. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1992Google Scholar). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and MDH activities were measured in pieces of individual fibers as described by Hintz et al. (12Hintz C.S. Lowry C.V. Kaiser K.K. McKee D. Lowry O.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1980; 239: C58-C65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Levels of glycogen and UDP-Glc were measured as described by Henry and Lowry (21Henry C.G. Lowry O.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: H599-H605PubMed Google Scholar). Generation of Transgenic Mice Overexpressing UDP-Glc PPL—A DNA fragment containing –3300 to +7 of the mouse creatine kinase gene followed by a BstEII site, a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter, an SV40 intron, and a polyadenylation site was excised from p3300MCKCAT (22Jaynes J.B. Johnson J.E. Buskin J.N. Gartside C.L. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) with HindIII. After blunting the ends, the fragment was inserted into pSL1180 (Amersham Biosciences) between the StuI site and a blunted KpnI site to generate pSL11803300MCKCAT.A cDNA fragment encoding the larger human skeletal muscle UDP-Glc PPL (form II) was excised using ClaI and SmaI from pHC379 (23Duggleby R.G. Chao Y.C. Huang J.G. Peng H.L. Chang H.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), which was kindly provided by Dr. H. Y. Chang. The fragment was then inserted between blunted ends of pSL11803300MCKCAT which had been cut with BstEII. Proper orientation of the insert was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. A fragment containing the 3.3-kb creatine kinase gene sequence, UDP-Glc PPL cDNA, and SV40 sequences was excised with ClaI and EcoRV. The fragment was purified and injected into the pronuclei of fertilized mouse eggs ((C57BL6 × CBA)F1 × (C57BL6 × CBA)F1). Embryos were implanted into pseudopregnant females (Swiss Webster), and transgenic pups were identified by using the PCR to detect CAT sequences in tail DNA. Two founder lines, PPL-1 and PPL-2, were propagated by mating transgene-positive animals to wild type C57BL6 mice. Preparation of Muscle Samples for Analyses—Transgenic mice and wild type littermates were fed ad libitum, then anesthetized by subcutaneous injection (1 ml/kg) of a mixture of 40 mg/ml ketamine, 10 mg/ml xylazine, and 1.5 mg/ml acepromazine. Muscles were removed and either incubated in vitro to measure [U-14C]glucose into glycogen (described later) or rinsed quickly with chilled (0 °C) phosphate-buffered saline (135 mm NaCl and 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The muscles were powdered by using a porcelain mortar and pestle chilled in liquid nitrogen. Samples were stored at –80 °C before extracts were prepared as described below. Extract protein was measured using the method of Smith et al. (24Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18712) Google Scholar). Measurements of UDP-Glc and Glycogen in Mouse Muscle—Muscle powders were weighed and then homogenized (50 mg of tissue/ml of acid) at 0 °C in either 0.3 m perchloric acid (for glycogen measurements) or 0.02 m HCl (for UDP-Glc measurements). The homogenates were centrifuged at 8,900 × g for 10 min at 4 °C before supernatants were collected for analyses. Glycogen was measured by the amyloglucosidase method described by Passonneau and Lauderdale (25Passonneau J.V. Lauderdale V.R. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 60: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). UDP-Glc was measured by a modification of the fluorometric assay described by Passonneau and Lowry (20Passonneau J.V. Lowry O.H. Enzymatic Analysis: A Practical Guide. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1992Google Scholar). Briefly, the HCl extracts were neutralized with NaOH, then after adding 0.1 mm EDTA (100 μl/ml extract), the extracts were boiled for 5 min and centrifuged at 8,900 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Aliquots of the supernatants (500 μl) were added to 500-μl solutions containing 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NAD+, 0.016 unit/ml UDP-Glc dehydrogenase, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1. The samples were incubated for 2 h at 24 °C before the NADH generated was measured fluorometrically. After subtracting blank values from incubations conducted without UDP-Glc dehydrogenase, the UDP-Glc content of the samples was determined from a standard curve generated with known concentrations of UDP-Glc. Measurements of UDP-Glc PPL Activity in Mouse Skeletal Muscle— UDP-Glc PPL activity was measured by modifying the method described by Roach et al. (26Roach P.J. Warren K.R. Atkinson D.E. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5445-5450Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) for measuring the activity of the enzyme in liver extracts. Powdered muscle was homogenized (100 mg of tissue/ml of buffer) on ice using a glass homogenization tube (Thomas) and a Teflon pestle driven at 1,000 rpm. The homogenization buffer contained 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 0.25% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 500 nm microcystine-LR, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, supplemented with 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin-A. The homogenates were rotated at 4 °C for 45 min, then centrifuged at 8,900 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration of the extracts were determined (24Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18712) Google Scholar) and then adjusted to a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml by adding homogenization buffer. Samples (2.5 μg of protein, 12.5 μl) were added to 800 μl of 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm UTP, 2 μm microcystine-LR, 100 nm okadaic acid, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1. The UDP-Glc PPL reactions were initiated by adding 100 μl of 5 mm Glu-1-P. After incubating samples for 20 min at 37 °C, the reactions were terminated by adding 150 μl of 100 mm EDTA and boiling for 2.5 min. The samples were then centrifuged at 8,900 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. An aliquot of supernatant (500 μl) was added to 500 μl of solution containing 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NAD+, 0.016 unit/ml UDP-Glc dehydrogenase, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1. The samples were incubated at 24 °C for 90 min before the absorbance at 340 nm was measured. The amounts of UDP-Glc formed were determined after subtracting background absorbances determined in incubations conducted without UDP-Glc dehydrogenase. [U-14C]Glucose into Glycogen—Incubations were conducted essentially as described previously (5Azpiazu I. Manchester J. Skurat A.V. Roach P.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: E234-E243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and diaphragm muscles were removed from anesthetized mice. The diaphragm was dissected into two hemidiaphragms, leaving a rib attached to each to avoid cutting fibers. Muscles were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to remove endogenous hormones, then transferred to tubes containing 10 ml of Krebs-Henseleit buffer (118 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm potassium phosphate, 1.2 mm MgSO4, and 25 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.4) plus 5 mm [U-14C]glucose (∼500 cpm/nmol). The buffer was gassed directly by bubbling with a mixture of 95% O2 and 5% CO2. The muscles were incubated at 37 °C without or with porcine insulin for 30 min, then rinsed quickly, blotted on tissue paper, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Muscles were homogenized in 0.4 ml of 30% KOH, before samples were placed in a boiling water bath for 1 h. After adding 50 μl of a 5% glycogen solution to each sample, ethanol was added to a final concentration of 70%, and glycogen was allowed to precipitate at –20 °C for 8 h. The samples were centrifuged at 8,900 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to pellet the glycogen. The glycogen pellets were washed four times with 66% ethanol and dissolved in 50 μl of deionized water. Samples were spotted on 2-cm squares of filter paper (Whatman 31ET), which were washed five times with 66% ethanol. The papers were dried before the amount of 14C-labeled glycogen was determined by scintillation counting. Intravenous and Intraperitoneal Glucose Tolerance Tests—Food was removed the evening before glucose tolerance tests, which were conducted the following morning. Mice were injected either intraperitoneally with 1.0 mg of glucose/g of body weight or intravenously via the lateral tail vein with 0.5 mg of glucose/g of body weight. The glucose solutions were prepared in 0.9% saline and warmed to 37 °C prior to injections. Blood glucose levels were determined in samples of tail vein blood (∼3 μl) at increasing times after the glucose injection using a glucometer (ONE TOUCH FastTake, LifeScan). Preparation of Antibodies and Detection of UDP-Glc PPL by Immunoblotting—A synthetic peptide (CELSVKKELEKILT) having a sequence identical to positions 29–41 of the human UDP-Glc PPL enzyme (23Duggleby R.G. Chao Y.C. Huang J.G. Peng H.L. Chang H.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin by using maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide, and the conjugate was used to immunize rabbits as described previously (27Sevetson B.R. Kong X. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10305-10309Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Antibodies were purified using a column containing an affinity resin prepared by coupling the peptide to Sulfolink beads (Pierce). For immunoblotting, muscle extract samples (25 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE in 7.5% polyacrylamide gels (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207529) Google Scholar) before proteins were transferred electrophoretically to Immobilon membranes (Millipore). After incubating with 2 μg/ml UDP-Glc PPL antibodies, the membranes were washed, and antibody binding was detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody and Tropix reagent. Other Materials—[U-14C]Glucose was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Porcine insulin and UDP-Glc dehydrogenase were obtained from Calbiochem. Most other chemicals and reagents were from Sigma. Effect of Insulin on Glycogen and UDP-Glc in Single Muscle Fibers—To investigate the effect of insulin on glycogen synthesis in different types of muscle fibers, rats were infused with either a maximally effective concentration of insulin or a saline control. Blood glucose was clamped at 5 mm to prevent hypoglycemia in the insulin-treated animals and to eliminate differences in blood glucose in the control and insulin-treated animals. Rectus abdominis muscles were freeze-clamped in situ then freeze-dried at –30 °C. Muscle fibers were dissected from the dried muscles, and enzyme activities and levels of UDP-Glc and glycogen were measured in pieces of individual fibers. To allow assignment of fibers into different fiber type categories, the activities of LDH and MDH activities were measured (12Hintz C.S. Lowry C.V. Kaiser K.K. McKee D. Lowry O.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1980; 239: C58-C65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Type IIB fibers have the lowest levels of MDH activity of the different types of fibers, and in a plot of LDH versus MDH activity IIB fibers were tightly clustered and well separated from the more oxidative fibers (Fig. 1). Of the oxidative fiber types, Type I fibers have the lowest levels of MDH, and a previous study demonstrated that those fibers with low LDH activity with MDH activity less than 15 mmol/h/kg were Type I (29Hintz C.S. Coyle E.F. Kaiser K.K. Chi M.M.Y. Lowry O.H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1984; 32: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In the original study, those fibers having MDH activities greater than 15 mmol/h/kg were categorized as Type IIA fibers (12Hintz C.S. Lowry C.V. Kaiser K.K. McKee D. Lowry O.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1980; 239: C58-C65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is now known that IID fibers may also have high levels of oxidative enzymes (30Schiaffino S. Reggiani C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 371-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). Therefore, fibers having an MDH activity higher than 15 mmol/h/kg were assigned to a IIA/IID category. By these criteria, 20.7% of the fibers were Type I, 36.6% were IIA/D, and 42.7% were IIB. In muscles from control (saline-infused) animals, the glycogen contents of the three types of muscle fibers ranged from an average of 140 mmol/kg, dry weight, in Type I fibers to 194 mmol/kg, dry weight, in Type IIA/D fibers. Insulin increased the amount of glycogen in all three types of fibers (Fig. 2A) The percentage change caused by insulin was greatest in Type I fibers, where glycogen was increased by 71%. Type IIB fibers exhibited the smallest percentage increase in glycogen levels in response to insulin. Insulin was without effect on the level of UDP-Glc in Type I fibers; however, insulin decreased the UDP-Glc content of both Type IIA/D fibers and Type IIB fibers by 40% (p < 0.001) and 28% (p < 0.01), respectively (Fig. 2B). The findings in these fast twitch fiber types are consistent with the previous report of decreased UDP-Glc in whole rectus abdominis muscles from insulin-treated rats (11Rossetti L. Hu M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2963-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Transgenic Overexpression of UDP-Glc PPL in Skeletal Muscle—The finding that UDP-Glc concentrations were decreased by insulin suggests that the supply of UDP-Glc by the UDP-Glc PPL reaction limits glycogen accumulation in response to insulin. If this hypothesis were correct, then overexpressing UDP-Glc PPL would be expected to enhance insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis. To test this hypothesis, transgenic mice were generated in which UDP-Glc PPL was selectively overexpressed in skeletal muscle by using promoter and enhancer elements from the skeletal muscle creatine kinase gene (22Jaynes J.B. Johnson J.E. Buskin J.N. Gartside C.L. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Transgenes under the control of these elements have been shown to be expressed preferentially in glycolytic muscle fiber types (22Jaynes J.B. Johnson J.E. Buskin J.N. Gartside C.L. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Two transgenic lines, designated PPL-1 and PPL-2, were selected for initial experiments. UDP-Glc PPL activities in tibialis anterior, EDL, gastrocnemius, and soleus muscles from transgenic animals and wild type littermates were measured (Fig. 3). The four wild type muscles contained comparable amounts of UDP-Glc PPL activity. Activities were 2–3-fold higher in transgenic tibialis anterior, EDL, and gastrocnemius muscles than in these muscles in nontransgenic littermates; however, very little, if any, increase in UDP-Glc PPL activity attributable to the transgene was noted in the soleus muscles (Fig. 3). The soleus is composed predominantly of Type I fibers (31Ariano M.A. Armstrong R.B. Edgerton V.R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1973; 21: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Thus, expression of UDP-Glc PPL is consistent with the expression of the creatine kinase gene, which is lowest in Type I muscle fibers (22Jaynes J.B. Johnson J.E. Buskin J.N. Gartside C.L. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Because UDP-Glc PPL activities were approximately the same in muscles from PPL-1 and PPL-2 mice, subsequent studies were conducted with only one of the lines (PPL-1). To confirm transgenic overexpression, antibodies to UDP-Glc PPL were generated, and the levels of enzyme protein were assessed by immunoblotting. The results in Fig. 4 depict immunoblots of samples of quadriceps, EDL, and diaphragm muscles from PPL-1 mice and nontransgenic littermates. The transgene increased UDP-Glc PPL protein by ∼5-fold in the quadricep and EDL muscles. As expected, transgenic expression of UDP-Glc PPL was relatively low in the diaphragm, which is composed primarily of oxidative fibers. Although the percentage increase in enzyme protein in the EDL was somewhat greater than the percentage increase in enzyme activity, the immunoblotting and enzyme activity measurements confirm that UDP-Glc PPL was overexpressed in muscles from PPL-1 mice. Transgenic overexpression of UDP-Glc PPL increased levels of UDP-Glc in gastrocnemius muscles by ∼3-fold (Fig. 5). The percentage increase in UDP-Glc was very similar to the increase in UDP-Glc PPL activity produced by the transgene in these muscles, solidifying the conclusion that the overexpressed enzyme was active. In contrast, levels of glycogen were almost identical in gastrocnemius muscles from PPL-1 mice and nontransgenic littermates (Fig. 5). Thus, increasing UDP-Glc, the immediate precursor of glycogen, by transgenic overexpression of UDP-Glc PPL was not sufficient to drive glycogen accumulation. To investigate the effect of increasing UDP-Glc on insulin action in vivo, we evaluated the effect of the transgene on glucose tolerance by conducting both intraperitoneal (Fig. 6A) and intravenous (Fig. 6B) glucose tolerance tests. The changes in blood glucose after administration of glucose in nontransgenic and transgenic animals were virtually identical. Thus, transgenic overexpression of UDP-Glc PPL in skeletal muscle did not significantly affect whole animal glucose disposal. Failure of Transgenic Overexpression of UDP-Glc PPL to Enhance Insulin-stimulated Glycogen Synthesis in Vitro—As a result of homeostatic mechanisms, a change in insulin action in skeletal muscle is not always apparent in glucose tolerance tests. To examine more directly insulin action in skeletal muscle, we conducted in vitro experiments with wild type and transgenic EDL muscles. After incubating in medium containing 5 mm glucose, levels of UDP-Glc in the EDL muscles (Table I) were lower than those measured in quadriceps that had been freeze-clamped in situ (Fig. 5). Thus, incubation in vitro may decrease UDP-Glc levels, although it is also possible that UDP-Glc levels are different in quadriceps and EDL muscles. Importantly, incubating the EDL muscles with insulin decreased UDP-Glc levels by ∼45% (Table I). This change, which is comparable with the percentage change produced by insulin in Type II muscle fibers in vivo (Fig. 2B), confirms that insulin decreases UDP-Glc in mouse skeletal muscle.Table IEffect of insulin on UDP-Glc and Glu-6-P levels in wild type and transgenic EDL muscles incubated in vitroTreatmentUDP-Glc in EDL fromGlu-6-P in EDL fromWild typePPL-1Wild typePPL-1nmol/g, wet weightnmol/g, wet weightControl7.8 ± 0.811.8 ± 1.6*p < 0.05, significance of difference between PPL-1 and wild type.58 ± 659 ± 6Insulin, 250 milliunits/ml4.3 ± 0.4**p < 0.01, significance of difference between insulin and control.6.4 ± 0.2*p < 0.05, significance of difference between PPL-1 and wild type.,**p < 0.01, significance of difference between insulin and control.82 ± 2077 ± 7* p < 0.05, significance of difference between PPL-1 and wild type.** p < 0.01, significance of difference between insulin and control. Open table in a new tab Levels of UDP-Glc were 50% higher in EDL muscles from PPL-1 mice than in muscles from wild type animals (Table I), although the effect of the transgene was not as large as in quadriceps frozen in situ (Fig. 5). In contrast, levels of Glu-6-P in wild type and transgenic muscles were not significantly different, in either the absence or presence of insulin (Table I). Transgenic overexpression of PPL-1 did not prevent the fall in UDP-Glc in response to insulin. However, after incubation with insulin, UDP-Glc was 50% higher in transgenic muscles than in wild type muscles. Experiments were conducted to determine whether the increase in UDP-Glc produced by the transgene was sufficient to increase glycogen synthesis. Incubating wild type EDL muscles in vitro with a physiological concentration of insulin (100 microunits/ml) increased [U-14C]glucose incorporation into glycogen by ∼2-fold (Fig. 7A). With a maximally effective concentration of insulin, the amount of [U-14C]glucose incorporated into glycogen was increased by 15-fold (Fig. 7B). The transgene did not significantly affect [14C]glycogen synthesis in either the absence or presence of insulin (Fig. 7, A and B). Results comparable with those in the EDL muscles were obtained with nontransgenic and transgenic hemidiaphragms (Fig. 7C). The present results indicate that insulin decreases UDP-Glc levels in Type II skeletal muscle fibers (Fig. 2A). This finding suggested to us that UDP-Glc PPL activity might limit glycogen synthesis in fast twitch muscle fibers stimulated with insulin. To test this hypothesis, we generated transgenic animals overexpressing UDP-Glc PPL in skeletal muscle. The results demonstrate that the transgene increased UDP-Glc in muscle (Fig. 5) but was without effect on glycogen accumulation (Fig. 5) and glucose tolerance in vivo (Fig. 6) or on rates of glucose incorporation into glycogen in vitro (Fig. 7). The striking metabolic heterogeneity of the fibers that compose skeletal muscle is a complicating factor that is rarely addressed in interpreting the meaning of changes in metabolites measured in whole muscles or in animals. When the effects of insulin on metabolite levels in skeletal muscle are investigated, it is common practice to assume that the changes occur within the same muscle fibers, although this is not necessarily the case. We addressed this potential problem in a unique manner using microanalytical methods to measure levels of UDP-Glc and glycogen in single manually dissected muscle fibers from control and insulin-treated animals. Insulin increased glycogen and decreased UDP-Glc levels in Type II fibers, whereas in Type I fibers the hormone increased glycogen but did not decrease UDP-Glc (Fig. 2). Our results confirm and extend the observations of Rossetti and Hu (11Rossetti L. Hu M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2963-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), who found that infusing rats with insulin decreased UDP-Glc levels in whole rectus abdominis muscles. In principle, a decrease in UDP-Glc could result from either an increase in its rate of utilization or a decrease in its rate of formation. Because insulin stimulates glucose transport/phosphorylation, it is unlikely that a decrease in the supply of Glu-1-P provided by isomerization of Glu-6-P explains the fall in UDP-Glc. Glu-1-P is also produced by the phosphorylase reaction, and there is evidence that insulin decreases glycogenolysis in skeletal muscle (32Challiss R.A. Crabtree B. Newsholme E.A. Eur. J Biochem. 1987; 163: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 33Zhang J. Hiken J.F. Davis A.E. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17513-17523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If the rate of glycogenolysis were sufficiently high, inhibiting the process could lead to a decrease in UDP-Glc. However, as suggested previously (11Rossetti L. Hu M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2963-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), it seems more likely that the well established effect of insulin on activating glycogen synthase, which utilizes UDP-Glc to synthesize glycogen, explains the fall in UDP-Glc. Consistent with this interpretation, transgenic overexpression of glycogen synthase decreased UDP-Glc in skeletal muscle (7Manchester J. Skurat A.V. Roach P.J. Hauschka S.D. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10707-10711Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In the present study insulin decreased UDP-Glc in both control and PPL-1 EDL muscles (Table I). Indeed, the absolute decrease in UDP-Glc produced by insulin was larger in the transgenic muscles than in the wild type muscles (5.4 nmol/g, wet weight, compared with 3.5 nmol/g, wet weight), indicating that insulin activated glycogen synthase in the transgenic muscles. The intracellular concentration of UDP-Glc appears to be insufficient to saturate glycogen synthase. 2Measurements of the Km of purified rabbit muscle glycogen synthase for UDP-Glc ranged from approximately 50 μm for the fully dephosphorylated form assayed in the presence of Glu-6-P to more than 9 mm for a phosphorylated enzyme assayed in the absence of Glu-6-P (35Roach P.J. Takeda Y. Larner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1913-1919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dry weight of single muscle fibers is approximately 20% of the wet weight. To estimate the concentration of UDP-Glc from the single fiber measurements, it was assumed that 1 kg, wet weight, was equal to a 1-liter volume and that UDP-Glc was distributed evenly within the cell. Thus, for example, after insulin treatment the UDP-Glc concentration in Type II fibers was approximately 50 μm. Therefore, regardless of the mechanism through which insulin decreases UDP-Glc, such a decrease would be expected to limit the rate of glycogen synthesis. Likewise, all things being equal an increase in UDP-Glc should increase glycogen synthesis. For this reason the finding that increasing UDP-Glc PPL in skeletal muscle did not lead to glycogen accumulation was unexpected. It is clear that the transgene was expressed. Immunoblotting with antibodies to UDP-Glc PPL demonstrated that enzyme protein was increased in different skeletal muscles in a pattern consistent with that expected from the creatine kinase promoter and enhancer elements that were used to drive transgenic expression (Fig. 4). Measurements of UDP-Glc PPL activity indicated that the amount of the transgene expressed was sufficient to increase UDP-Glc PPL activity (Fig. 3). Moreover, measurements of tissue UDP-Glc confirmed that the amount of UDP-Glc PPL overexpressed was sufficient to increase UDP-Glc in skeletal muscle (Fig. 5). The finding that UDP-Glc levels can be increased without affecting glycogen synthesis argues that UDP-Glc PPL does not limit glycogen synthesis; however, there are caveats attached to this conclusion. We cannot be certain that the transgene increased UDP-Glc in the same pool as that utilized for glycogen synthesis. Moreover, as with other studies involving transgenic animals, long term overexpression of an enzyme may produce unknown compensatory changes that complicate interpretation of the results. The present findings are similar in some respects to those of Skurat et al. (34Skurat A.V. Peng H.-L. Chang H.-Y. Cannon J.F. Roach P.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), who found that overexpressing UDP-Glc PPL in COS cells, either alone or with wild type glycogen synthase, was without effect on glycogen accumulation. Although additional studies will be needed to determine why increasing UDP-Glc by transgenic overexpression of UDP-Glc PPL does not increase glycogen accumulation, the present findings are indicative of the complex mechanisms involved in the control of glycogen metabolism by insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1977912861,"Mutations of the RET proto-oncogene are found in the majority of patients with the inherited cancer syndrome multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2). A minority of cases, however, have no detectable RET mutation and there is considerable phenotypic variation within and among MEN 2 families with the same RET mutation, suggesting a role for other loci in this disease. A candidate for such a gene is glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor receptor alpha 4 (GFRA4), which encodes a cell surface-bound co-receptor (GFRα4) required for interaction of RET with its ligand persephin. The GFRA4 gene has multiple alternative splices leading to three distinct protein isoforms that are prominently expressed in thyroid. We postulated that mutations of GFRA4 contribute to MEN 2 in the absence of RET mutations or modify the RET mutation phenotype. We screened patients with MEN 2 or MEN 2-like phenotypes, with and without RET mutations, for variants of GFRA4. We identified 10 variants, one of which was over represented in, and two of which were found exclusively in, our patient populations. One of these was a single-base substitution upstream of the GFRα4 coding region, where it may alter gene expression. The second was a 7 bp insertion, which results in a change in reading frame for all three GFRα4 isoforms. This would cause a relative shift in membrane bound and soluble forms of GFRα4, which would significantly alter the formation of RET signalling complexes. Our data suggest a model of wild-type GFRα4 isoform expression that includes both activating and inhibiting co-receptors for RET."
