https://openalex.org/W4281770536,"Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) contribute to de novo angiogenesis, tissue regeneration, and remodeling. Interleukin 10 (IL-10), an anti-inflammatory cytokine that primarily signals via STAT3, has been shown to drive EPC recruitment to injured tissues. Our previous work demonstrated that overexpression of IL-10 in dermal wounds promotes regenerative tissue repair via STAT3-dependent regulation of fibroblast-specific hyaluronan synthesis. However, IL-10's role and specific mode of action on EPC recruitment, particularly in dermal wound healing and neovascularization in both normal and diabetic wounds, remain to be defined. Therefore, inducible skin-specific STAT3 knockdown mice were studied to determine IL-10's impact on EPCs, dermal wound neovascularization and healing, and whether it is STAT3-dependent. We show that IL-10 overexpression significantly elevated EPC counts in the granulating wound bed, which was associated with robust capillary lumen density and enhanced re-epithelialization of both control and diabetic (db/db) wounds at day 7. We noted increased VEGF and high C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (CXCL12) levels in wounds and a favorable CXCL12 gradient at day 3 that may support EPC mobilization and infiltration from bone marrow to wounds, an effect that was abrogated in STAT3 knockdown wounds. These findings were supported in vitro. IL-10 promoted VEGF and CXCL12 synthesis in primary murine dermal fibroblasts, with blunted VEGF expression upon blocking CXCL12 in the media by antibody binding. IL-10-conditioned fibroblast media also significantly promoted endothelial sprouting and network formation. In conclusion, these studies demonstrate that overexpression of IL-10 in dermal wounds recruits EPCs and leads to increased vascular structures and faster re-epithelialization."
https://openalex.org/W4285505268,"We extract data on physiological aging by computing a frailty index for 201 countries over the period 1990-2019. Using panel estimation techniques, we show that the macro frailty index replicates basic regularities previously observed in related studies of aging at the individual level. We then use the frailty index to highlight trends of global physiological aging and its relationship to economic growth. Holding population age structure fixed, the global frailty index has on average increased by about 2 percent over the last 30 years. The average person has therefore aged by what corresponds to about one life-year of physiological aging. This overall trend is relatively similar across different geographical regions. We also document a negative relationship between physiological aging of the workforce and economic growth. According to our preferred specification, a one percent increase in the frailty index of the workforce is associated with a 1.5 percent decline of GDP per capita. This means that average annual growth of labor productivity would have been 0.1 percentage points higher without physiological aging in the period 1990-2019."
https://openalex.org/W4281680494,"Researchers have long been concerned about the association between depression and the prevalence of multiple chronic diseases or multimorbidity in older persons. However, the underlying pathway or mechanism in the multimorbidity-depression relationship is still unknown. Data were extracted from a baseline survey of the Longitudinal Ageing Survey of India (LASI) conducted during 2017-18 (N = 31,464; aged ≥ 60 years). Depression was assessed using the 10-item Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D-10). Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the association. The Karlson-Holm-Breen (KHB) method was adopted for mediation analysis. The prevalence of depression among older adults was nearly 29% (men: 26% and women 31%). Unadjusted and adjusted estimates in binary logistic regression models suggested an association between multimorbidity and depression (UOR = 1.28; 95% CIs 1.27-1.44 and AOR = 1.12; 95% CIs 1.12-1.45). The association was particularly slightly strong in the older men. In addition, the association was mediated by functional health such as Self Rated Health (SRH) (proportion mediated: 40%), poor sleep (35.15%), IADL disability (22.65%), ADL disability (21.49%), pain (7.92%) and by behavioral health such as physical inactivity (2.28%). However, the mediating proportion was higher among older women as compared to older men. Physical inactivity was not found to be significant mediator for older women. The findings of this population-based study revealed that older people with multimorbidity are more likely to suffer depressive symptoms in older ages, suggesting the need for more chronic disease management and research. Multimorbidity and depression may be mediated by certain functional health factors, especially in older women. Further longitudinal research is needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms of this association so that future preventive initiatives may be properly guided."
https://openalex.org/W4281930372,"The aim of this study was to capture Australian frontline healthcare workers’ (HCWs) experiences with personal protective equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. This was a cross-sectional study using an online survey consisting of five domains: demographics; self-assessment of COVID risk; PPE access; PPE training and confidence; and anxiety. Participants were recruited from community and hospital healthcare settings in Australia, including doctors, nurses, allied health professionals, paramedics, and aged care and support staff. Data analysis was descriptive with free-text responses analysed using qualitative content analysis and multivariable analysis performed for predictors of confidence, bullying, staff furlough and anxiety. The 2258 respondents, comprised 80% women, 49% doctors and 40% nurses, based in hospital (39%) or community (57%) settings. Key findings indicated a lack of PPE training (20%), calls for fit testing, insufficient PPE (25%), reuse or extended use of PPE (47%); confusion about changing guidelines (48%) and workplace bullying over PPE (77%). An absence of in-person workplace PPE training was associated with lower confidence in using PPE (OR 0.21, 95%CI 0.12, 0.37) and a higher likelihood of workplace bullying (OR 1.43; 95% CI 1.00, 2.03) perhaps reflecting deficiencies in workplace culture. Deficiencies in PPE availability, access and training linking to workplace bullying, can have negative physical and psychological impacts on a female dominant workforce critical to business as usual operations and pandemic response."
https://openalex.org/W4281857293,"A survey to collect soil nematodes with potential to control Ceratitis capitata flies was carried out in different locations in Tunisia. Several nematode isolates were recovered, laboratory colonies were established, and their taxonomic identities were determined based on molecular methods. Among all the recovered nematode isolates, two of them, Oscheius tipulae TC2 and OC2, were evaluated for their capacity to control C . capitata flies and for their ability to kill and reproduce on Galleria mellonella larvae. Our results show a great potential of these two isolates as biocontrol agents as they kill C . capitata eggs and pupae and interfere with the metamorphosis of C . capitata larvae. More specifically, TC2 and OC2 nematodes killed 39 and 31% of C . capitata eggs, respectively, impaired the metamorphosis of up to 77% and up to 67% of C . capitata larvae, respectively, and killed up to 66% and up to 58% of C . capitata pupae, respectively. The efficacy of TC2 and OC2 nematodes was particularly high on C . capitata pupae, and significant insect mortalities were observed even at concentrations of 1 and 5 nematodes/pupae, respectively. We also found that TC2 and OC2 nematodes efficiently kill and reproduce in G . mellonella larvae, suggesting that these insects could be used for mass-multiplication of these nematodes. These results reveal the potential of O . tipulae to complement integrated pest management programs against C . capitata flies."
https://openalex.org/W4285411829,"This paper examines gender variation in departures from the tenure-track science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) academic career pathway to non-tenure-track academic careers. We integrate multiple data sources including the Survey of Earned Doctorates and the Survey of Doctorate Recipients to examine longitudinal career outcomes of STEM doctorate women. We consider three types of careers after receipt of a PhD: academic, academic non-tenure-track, and non-academic positions. We find that STEM women are more likely to hold academic non-tenure-track positions, which are associated with lower job satisfaction and lower salaries among men and women. Explanations including differences in field of study, preparation in graduate school, and family structure only explain 35 percent of the gender gap in non-tenure-track academic positions."
https://openalex.org/W4281619428,"Virtual perspective taking can reduce unconscious bias and increase empathy and prosocial behavior toward individuals who are marginalized based on group stereotypes such as age, race, or socioeconomic status. However, the question remains whether this approach might reduce implicit gender bias, and the degree to which virtual immersion contributes to behavioral modulation following perspective taking tasks is unknown. Accordingly, we investigate the role of virtual perspective taking for binary gender using an online platform (Study 1) and immersive virtual reality (Study 2). Female and male undergraduates performed a simulated interview while virtually represented by an avatar that was either congruent or incongruent with their own gender. All participants rated a male and a female candidate on competence, hireability, likeability, empathy, and interpersonal closeness and then chose one of these two equivalently qualified candidates to hire for a laboratory assistant position in the male dominated industry of information technology. Online perspective taking did not reveal a significant influence of avatar gender on candidate ratings or candidate choice, whereas virtual reality perspective taking resulted in significant changes to participant behavior following exposure to a gender-incongruent avatar (e.g., male embodied as female), such that men showed preference for the female candidate and women showed preference for the male candidate. Although between-group differences in candidate ratings were subtle, rating trends were consistent with substantial differences in candidate choice, and this effect was greater for men. Compared to an online approach, virtual reality perspective taking appears to exert greater influence on acute behavioral modulation for gender bias due to its ability to fully immerse participants in the experience of (temporarily) becoming someone else, with empathy as a potential mechanism underlying this phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W4281860396,"Obesity can increase the airways resistance, mainly in the periphery, leading to dyspnea perception that can impair the functional capacity. This study aimed to analyze if airways resistance could be related to the walking capacity of women with morbid obesity.Thirty-seven women with grade III obesity in preoperative bariatric surgery were evaluated using the spirometry test, impulse oscillometry system (IOS), and six-minute walk test (6MWT). Additionally, data about their daily dyspnea perception and physical activity level were collected.Variables of the spirometry test did not detect ventilator disorders. Compared to the predicted values, the IOS identified significant increase in airways resistance (kPa/L/s) (R5: 0.36 (0.34; 0.36) and 0.53 (0.47; 0.61); R20: 0.30 (0.28; 0.30) and 0.41 (0.35; 0.45); R5-20: 0.06 (0.06; 0.06) and 0.14 (0.10; 0.15); X5: -0.03 (-0.04; -0.01) and -0.20 (-0.27; -0.18), respectively). The distance walked in the 6MWT, 491.4±60.4m was significantly correlated to R5 (rho = -0.41, p = 0.01), R5-20 (rho = -0.52, p = 0.001), and X5 (rho = 0.54, p = 0.0006).The IOS is able to identify changes in airway resistance even before the onset of symptoms. When evaluated by IOS women with severe obesity and normal spirometry exhibited central and peripheral airways obstruction. The correlations between the IOS and six-minute walk distance suggest that increased peripheral airways resistance could be related to worsening functional capacity."
https://openalex.org/W4281955484,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused over 500 million cases and over six million deaths globally. From these numbers, over 12 million cases and over 250 thousand deaths have occurred on the African continent as of May 2022. Prevention and surveillance remains the cornerstone of interventions to halt the further spread of COVID-19. Google Health Trends (GHT), a free Internet tool, may be valuable to help anticipate outbreaks, identify disease hotspots, or understand the patterns of disease surveillance. We collected COVID-19 case and death incidence for 54 African countries and obtained averages for four, five-month study periods in 2020-2021. Average case and death incidences were calculated during these four time periods to measure disease severity. We used GHT to characterize COVID-19 incidence across Africa, collecting numbers of searches from GHT related to COVID-19 using four terms: 'coronavirus', 'coronavirus symptoms', 'COVID19', and 'pandemic'. The terms were related to weekly COVID-19 case incidences for the entire study period via multiple linear and weighted linear regression analyses. We also assembled 72 variables assessing Internet accessibility, demographics, economics, health, and others, for each country, to summarize potential mechanisms linking GHT searches and COVID-19 incidence. COVID-19 burden in Africa increased steadily during the study period. Important increases for COVID-19 death incidence were observed for Seychelles and Tunisia. Our study demonstrated a weak correlation between GHT and COVID-19 incidence for most African countries. Several variables seemed useful in explaining the pattern of GHT statistics and their relationship to COVID-19 including: log of average weekly cases, log of cumulative total deaths, and log of fixed total number of broadband subscriptions in a country. Apparently, GHT may best be used for surveillance of diseases that are diagnosed more consistently. Overall, GHT-based surveillance showed little applicability in the studied countries. GHT for an ongoing epidemic might be useful in specific situations, such as when countries have significant levels of infection with low variability. Future studies might assess the algorithm in different epidemic contexts."
https://openalex.org/W4281652712,"In this study, we analyzed GPC family genes in colorectal cancer (CRC) and the possible mechanism of action of GPC1 in CRC. CRC patient data were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas, and the prognostic significance of GPC1 expression and its association with clinicopathological features were identified by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. CRC patients with high GPC1 expression had poor overall survival compared with patients with low GPC1 expression. In vitro experiments demonstrated that knockdown of GPC1 significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration and promoted cell apoptosis in CRC cell lines. Gene Ontology analysis of differential genes indicated that GPC1 may influence the TGF-β1 signaling pathway. Additional experiments revealed that silencing GPC1 suppressed the levels of TGF-β1 and p-SMAD2 but increased the expression of SMAD2. Taken together, these findings suggest that GPC1 may function as a tumor promoter in CRC cells through promoting TGF-β signaling pathway. Our results also indicate that GPC1 may serve as a critical effector in CRC progression and a new potential target for CRC therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4281689927,"Neural stemness is suggested to be the ground state of tumorigenicity and pluripotent differentiation potential. However, the relationship between these cell properties is unclear. Here, by disrupting the neural regulatory network in neural stem and cancer cells and by serial transplantation of cancer cells, we show that tumorigenicity and pluripotent differentiation potential are coupled cell properties unified by neural stemness. We show that loss of neural stemness via inhibition of SETDB1, an oncoprotein with enriched expression in embryonic neural cells during vertebrate embryogenesis, led to neuronal differentiation with reduced tumorigenicity and pluripotent differentiation potential in neural stem and cancer cells, whereas enhancement of neural stemness by SETDB1 overexpression caused the opposite effects. SETDB1 maintains a regulatory network comprising proteins involved in developmental programs and basic cellular functional machineries, including epigenetic modifications (EZH2), ribosome biogenesis (RPS3), translation initiation (EIF4G), and spliceosome assembly (SF3B1); all of these proteins are enriched in embryonic neural cells and play active roles in cancers. In addition, SETDB1 represses the transcription of genes promoting differentiation and cell cycle and growth arrest. Serial transplantation of cancer cells showed that neural stemness, tumorigenicity, and pluripotent differentiation potential were simultaneously enhanced; these effects were accompanied by increased expression of proteins involved in developmental programs and basic machineries, including SETDB1 and the abovementioned proteins, as well as by increased alternative splicing events. These results indicate that basic machineries work together to define a highly proliferative state with pluripotent differentiation potential and also suggest that neural stemness unifies tumorigenicity and differentiation potential.

These results indicate that basic machineries work together to define a highly proliferative state with pluripotent differentiation potential and also suggest that neural stemness unifies tumorigenicity and differentiation potential. Neural stemness has usually been considered to be a type of tissue stemness. However, it features some unique properties that are not displayed by other types of tissue stem cells. Neural stem cells (NSCs) exhibit tumorigenicity, because similar to cancer cells, NSCs are capable of tumor formation when transplanted into immunodeficient mice (1Cao Y. Neural is fundamental: neural stemness as the ground state of cell tumorigenicity and differentiation potential.Stem Cell Rev. Rep. 2022; 18: 37-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 2Xu L. Zhang M. Shi L. Yang X. Chen L. Cao N. et al.Neural stemness contributes to cell tumorigenicity.Cell Biosci. 2021; 11: 21Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). NSCs have pluripotent differentiation potential, which means that, in addition to the capability of differentiation into cell types of the nervous system, they can also be induced to differentiate into different nonneural cell types (1Cao Y.

Although embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have both tumorigenic and pluripotent differentiation potential, their intrinsic property is neural stemness because their default fate is primitive NSCs (primNSCs), according to the “neural default model” of pluripotent embryonic cells (1Cao Y.

In somatic cells, blocking endogenous factors also leads to gain of neural stemness and tumorigenicity at the expense of the original cell identity (2Xu L. Zhang M. Shi L. Yang X. Chen L.

The association among neural stemness, tumorigenicity, and pluripotent differentiation potential is supported by the fact that most genes promoting tumorigenesis and pluripotency are neural stemness genes or genes with localized or at least with enriched expression in embryonic neural cells (1Cao Y. Neural is fundamental: neural stemness as the ground state of cell tumorigenicity and differentiation potential.Stem Cell Rev.

Chem. 2017; 292: 12842-12859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The unique significance of neural stemness should be derived from the evolutionary advantage of neural genes and the neural-biased state in the last common unicellular ancestor of metazoans (1Cao Y. Neural is fundamental: neural stemness as the ground state of cell tumorigenicity and differentiation potential.Stem Cell Rev. Rep. 2022; 18: 37-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 2Xu L.

We previously suggested that neural stemness represents the ground state of tumorigenicity and pluripotent differentiation potential and that tumorigenesis is a process of gradual loss of the original cell identity and restoration of the neural ground state in somatic cells (1Cao Y. Neural is fundamental: neural stemness as the ground state of cell tumorigenicity and differentiation potential.Stem Cell Rev. Rep. 2022; 18: 37-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 13Cao Y. Tumorigenesis as a process of gradual loss of original cell identity and gain of properties of neural precursor/progenitor cells.Cell Biosci. 2017; 7: 61Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).The neural ground state is also reflected by the observation that genes involved in basic physiological functions in cells, such as the cell cycle, ribosome biogenesis, proteasome or spliceosome assembly, and protein translation, are mostly enriched in neural cells during vertebrate embryogenesis. The genes involved in the basic machineries usually had a unicellular origin during evolution (1Cao Y. Neural is fundamental: neural stemness as the ground state of cell tumorigenicity and differentiation potential.Stem Cell Rev. Rep. 2022; 18: 37-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 2Xu L. Zhang M. Shi L. Yang X. Chen L. Cao N. et al.Neural stemness contributes to cell tumorigenicity.Cell Biosci. 2021; 11: 21Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The cell cycle is tightly linked to cell fate decisions. Pluripotent stem cells and NSCs have a shorter cell cycle, and differentiated cells have a longer cell cycle (14Dalton S. Linking the cell cycle to cell fate decisions.Trends Cell Biol. 2015; 25: 592-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), in agreement with the differential expression of cell cycle genes in neural and nonneural cells during embryogenesis (1Cao Y. Neural is fundamental: neural stemness as the ground state of cell tumorigenicity and differentiation potential.Stem Cell Rev. Rep. 2022; 18: 37-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Cells with a short cell cycle need high protein production and homeostasis. Accordingly, genes encoding ribosomal and proteasomal proteins show dominant expression in embryonic neural cells during embryogenesis (1Cao Y. Neural is fundamental: neural stemness as the ground state of cell tumorigenicity and differentiation potential.Stem Cell Rev. Rep. 2022; 18: 37-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), suggesting the high activity of protein synthesis and turnover in embryonic neural cells. Recently, we showed that this is concertedly regulated and required for the maintenance of neural stemness in both NSCs and cancer cells (15Chen L. Zhang M. Fang L. Yang X. Cao N. Xu L. et al.Coordinated regulation of the ribosome and proteasome by PRMT1 in the maintenance of neural stemness in cancer cells and neural stem cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 297101275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The spliceosome is responsible for alternative splicing, a mechanism contributing to phenotypic novelty during evolution and to cell differentiation, lineage determination, and tissue or organ formation during embryogenesis (16Agosto L.M. Lynch K.W. Alternative pre-mRNA splicing switch controls hESC pluripotency and differentiation.Genes Dev. 2018; 32: 1103-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 17Baralle F.E. Giudice J.

Urrutia A.O. Alternative splicing and the evolution of phenotypic novelty.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2017; 37220150474Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The enriched expression of genes involved in spliceosome assembly and hence alternative splicing is consistent with the enrichment of long genes comprising more exons/introns in both embryonic neural cells and cancer cells (1Cao Y. Neural is fundamental: neural stemness as the ground state of cell tumorigenicity and differentiation potential.Stem Cell Rev. Rep. 2022; 18: 37-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 2Xu L.

Long genes and genes with multiple splice variants are enriched in pathways linked to cancer and other multigenic diseases.BMC Genomics. 2016; 17: 225Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Moreover, genes involved in developmental programs, such as those involved in epigenetic modification, pluripotency, or promotion of pluripotency, are also neural stemness genes or genes with specific or enriched expression in embryonic neural cells (1 and references therein). These genes work concertedly together to define a cellular state with high proliferation and pluripotent differentiation potential, both of which are features of tumorigenic cells. SETDB1 is an epigenetic modification factor responsible for trimethylation of lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9me3) and mediates transcriptional repression. SETDB1 is required for early embryogenesis, because gene knockout in mice causes embryonic lethality before E7.5 (20Dodge J.E. Kang Y.K. Beppu H. Lei H. Li E. Histone H3-K9 methyltransferase ESET is essential for early development.Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 2478-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), suggesting that it is critical during embryogenesis. Its gene is primarily transcribed in neural precursor cells during vertebrate embryogenesis, and brain-specific gene ablation causes severe brain developmental defects (11Zhang Z. Lei A. Xu L.

Accordingly, SETDB1 is upregulated in most cancers and promotes their initiation and progression (22Strepkos D. Markouli M. Klonou A. Papavassiliou A.G. Piperi C.

Serial transplantation (or in vivo passaging) of cancer cells in immunodeficient mice is an approach that mimics cancer progression (24Chan M.M. Lu X. Merchant F.M. Iglehart J.D. Miron P.L.

Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar), which form free-floating neurospheres in the medium (Fig. 1A). Treatment of the neurospheres with retinoic acid (RA), a reagent that induces neuronal differentiation in NSCs, induced a neuronal differentiation phenotype (Fig. 1A). RA treatment led to a decrease in the expression of the neural stemness markers Sox1 and Msi1 in differentiated cells. In addition, Myc, Hes1, Fgfr1, Vim, and Cdh2, which are expressed specifically or dominantly in embryonic neural cells during vertebrate embryogenesis and promote or are upregulated during tumorigenesis, exhibited reduced expression in response to RA treatment (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the neuronal markers Map2 and Tubb3 were upregulated, supporting the neuronal differentiation effect (Fig. 1B). We observed decreased expression of the epigenetic modification factors Setdb1 and Ezh2 in cells treated with RA (Fig. 1B). Ezh2 mediates trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3) and hence transcriptional repression and is required for early embryogenesis, maintaining or promoting neural stemness (26Buschendorf M. Terranova R. Boutsma E. Mao X. Isono K. Brykczynska U. et al.PRC1 and Suv39h specify parental asymmetry at constitutive heterochromatin in early mouse embryos.Nat.

Boddeke E. Copray S. Ezh2 expression in astrocytes induces their dedifferentiation toward neural stem cells.Cell Reprogram. 2011; 13: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the expression levels of proteins involved in translation initiation (Eif4g), ribosome biogenesis (Rps3 and Rpl26), and alternative splicing (Srsf3 and Sf3b1) were simultaneously reduced (Fig. 1B). This result suggests that loss of neural stemness leads to simultaneously decreases in the levels of proteins composing machineries for basic cellular physiological functions and developmental programs.Neuronal differentiation is accompanied by downregulation of Setdb1, and we next examined how Setdb1 functions in NSCs. Control primNSCs infected with lentivirus generated from empty vector (shCtrl) formed neurospheres in serum-free medium, and knockdown of Setdb1 with a validated shRNA (shSetdb1) caused failure of neurosphere formation. The resulting cells assumed a neuronal differentiation phenotype (Fig. 1C). The shRNA efficiently blocked Setdb1 expression in cells. Correspondingly, immunofluorescence (IF) staining showed that Sox1 and Msi1 were repressed but Map2 and Tubb3 were stimulated in response to Setdb1 knockdown (Fig. 1D), suggesting an essential role of Setdb1 in maintaining stemness in primNSCs.We next explored whether this finding holds true for different NSCs. NE-4C cells, an NSC line derived from cerebral vesicles of mouse E9 embryos, formed neurospheres in serum-free medium. When Setdb1 was knocked down, the cells exhibited a neuronal differentiation effect (Fig. 1E). IF staining revealed that Sox1 and Msi1 were repressed when Setdb1 was lost, whereas the expression of the neuronal proteins Map2, Tubb3, and Nefl was strongly induced (Fig. 1F). Detection of the expression of more proteins demonstrated that in addition to Sox1 and Msi1, neural stemness proteins and proteins with gene expression localized to or enriched in embryonic neural cells—that is, Hes1, Zic1, Cdh2, Fgfr1, and Pcna—were also downregulated (Fig. 1G). In contrast, Neun and Map2 were upregulated (Fig. 1G). Setdb1 knockdown caused decreased expression of the epigenetic factors Ezh2, Prmt1, and Lsd1 (Fig. 1G), which maintain neural stemness in NSCs and cancer cells or confer neural stemness on differentiated cells (15Chen L.

Moreover, decreased expression of proteins involved in translation initiation (Eif4g and Eif4a1), ribosome biogenesis (Rps3 and Rpl26), and alternative splicing (Srsf3 and Sf3b1) was observed (Fig. 1G).Transcriptome analysis showed that Setdb1 knockdown caused upregulation of 2619 genes and downregulation of 2457 genes in NE-4C cells (Table S1). The upregulated genes were primarily involved in events associated with neuronal differentiation (Fig. 1H). Notably, among the upregulated genes were the Hox genes, which are critical for patterning of the anterior-posterior body plan and specification of segment identity of tissues, including neural tissue, during embryogenesis. Some genes that are involved in cell cycle or growth arrest (Bcl6, Cdkn1a, and Eif2ak3), DNA repair, and apoptosis (Gadd45a, Gadd45b, and Gadd45g) were also upregulated (Table S1). The downregulated genes were associated with RNA and amino acid metabolism (Fig. 1I). This change might be related to the decrease in the expression of proteins involved in alternative splicing, ribosome biogenesis, and protein translation in knockdown cells. Among the downregulated genes were Aspm, Cenpk, Enc1, Lin28a, Mcm8, Nucks1, Pou5f1, and Utf1 (Table S1), which regulate pluripotency and neural stemness, transcription, or cell cycle. Taken together, these results indicate that inhibition of Setdb1 in NSCs causes neuronal differentiation and corresponding changes in regulatory networks.Subsequently, we observed that Setdb1 knockdown strongly inhibited cell invasion and migration (Fig. S1A) and reduced the colony-formation ability (Fig. S1, B and C). NSCs, such as NE-4C cells, are capable of forming xenograft tumors that contain cell types of all three germ layers (2Xu L. Zhang M. Shi L. Yang X. Chen L. Cao N. et al.Neural stemness contributes to cell tumorigenicity.Cell Biosci. 2021; 11: 21Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). As reported, NE-4C cells formed xenograft tumors in all six immunodeficient nude mice, whereas knockdown cells formed smaller tumors in only two of the six mice (Fig. 2, A–C and Table S2), indicating the lower tumorigenicity of knockdown cells. The expression of neural stemness genes or genes with enriched expression in embryonic neural cells during vertebrate embryogenesis was much lower in xenograft tumors formed by knockdown cells than in those formed by control cells (Fig. 2D). The same trends in differential expression were observed for genes representing neuronal differentiation (Fig. 2E) and genes representing mesodermal or endodermal tissue differentiation (Fig. 2F). Immunohistochemical staining showed that the expression level of Setdb1 was lower in sections of the tumors formed by knockdown cells than in tumors formed by control cells (Fig. 2G), further indicating the knockdown effect of Setdb1. Accordingly, the neural stemness markers Sox1, Sox9, and Pax6 and the proliferation marker Ki67 showed much weaker expression in tumors formed by knockdown cells (Fig. 2G). In tumors formed by control cells, there was significant neuronal differentiation, as shown by Map2 expression; however, Map2 expression was barely detectable in tumors formed by knockdown cells (Fig. 2G). Similarly, the mesodermal and endodermal tissue differentiation markers Acta2, Bglap, Ctsk, and Afp were detected strongly in tumors formed by control cells but were detected weakly or not detected in tumors formed by knockdown cells (Fig. 2G). These results demonstrate that loss of neural stemness in NE-4C cells via Setdb1 knockdown is accompanied by reduced tumorigenicity and pluripotent differentiation potential.Figure 2Difference in xenograft tumor formation and differentiation potential between control and knockdown NE-4C cells.

The colorectal cancer cell line HCT116 exhibits neural stemness because it expresses neural stemness markers, forms neurosphere-like structures in NSC-specific serum-free medium, and has pluripotent differentiation potential (2Xu L. Zhang M. Shi L. Yang X. Chen L. Cao N. et al.Neural stemness contributes to cell tumorigenicity.Cell Biosci. 2021; 11: 21Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In normal culture medium, knockdown of SETDB1 using a validated shRNA (shSETDB1) led to a significant phenotypic change in HCT116 cells. The cells grew long neurite-like processes, suggesting an effect of neuronal differentiation (Fig. 3A). When cultured in serum-free medium, control cells formed free-floating spherical structures, similar to NSCs. However, knockdown cells could not form such structures efficiently (Fig. 3A), an indication of reduced neural stemness. Immunoblotting showed efficient SETDB1 knockdown in cells, which was accompanied by a reduction in the level of H3K9me3. The cells expressed a series of neural stemness markers and proteins that are primarily expressed in embryonic neural cells during embryogenesis, including SOX2, MSI1, HES1, ZIC1, MYC, SOX9, OCT4, PCNA, CCND1, FGFR1, CDH2, and the epigenetic factors EZH2, PRMT1, and LSD1, which promote cancers or are upregulated in cancer cells. All were repressed in knockdown cells (Fig. 3B). Reduced expression of CCND1 and PCNA indicates reduced cell proliferation. Additionally, EIF4G, EIF4A1, RPS3, RPL26, SRSF3, and SF3B1 were downregulated (Fig. 3B). The upregulated proteins were MAP2, NEUN, and SYN1 (Fig. 3B). In addition, IF staining detected reduced expression of SF3B1 and RPS3 but increased expression of the neuronal proteins NEUROD1, SYN1, and TUBB3 in knockdown cells (Fig. 3C). Transcriptome profiling revealed that blocking SETDB1 in HCT116 cells downregulated the t"

This study aimed to explore perceived barriers, and enablers to implementing personalised care in severe asthma, from the healthcare professionals’ perspective. Methods A descriptive, qualitative study involving a single focus group (n = 7) and semi-structured interviews (n = 33) with multidisciplinary healthcare professionals involved in severe asthma care was conducted. A hybrid thematic and content analysis was undertaken to identify themes, which were then deductively mapped to the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Results Overall, three emergent themes were identified: (1) Barriers- (2) Enablers- to optimal management; (3) Desired model of care. Across all TDF domains, 6 constructs influenced development and implementation of optimal care: (1) belief about consequences, (2) environmental context and resources, (3) belief about capabilities, (4) social/professional role and identity, (5) goals and (6) knowledge. Conclusion Implementation of personalised care in severe asthma is complex and non-linear. The use of a theory-based approach effectively demonstrated how a variety of behaviours could be targeted to optimise and promote personalised care in different clinical setting."
https://openalex.org/W4281643354,"Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) is the main cytokine driving organ dysfunction in Familial Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (FHL). Blockade of IFN-γ pathway ameliorates FHL hepatitis, both in animal models and in humans with FHL. Hepatocytes are known to express IFN-γ receptor (IFN-γ-R). However, whether IFN-γ induced hepatitis in FHL is a lymphocyte or liver intrinsic response to the cytokine has yet to be elucidated. Using a IFNgR −/− bone marrow chimeric model, this study showed that non-hematopoietic IFN-γ response is critical for development of FHL hepatitis in LCMV-infected Prf1 −/− mice. Lack of hepatic IFN-γ responsiveness results in reduced hepatitis as measured by hepatomegaly, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and abrogated histologic endothelial inflammation. In addition, IFN-γ non-hematopoietic response was critical in activation of lymphocytes by soluble interleukin 2 receptor (sIL-2r) and recruitment of CD8+ effector T lymphocytes (CD8+ CD44 hi CD62L lo ) (Teff) and inflammatory monocytes. Lastly, non-hematopoietic IFN-γ response results in increased hepatic transcription of type 1 immune response and oxidative stress response pathways, while decreasing transcription of genes involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) production. In summary, these findings demonstrate that there is a hepatic transcriptional response to IFN-γ, likely critical in the pathogenesis of FHL hepatitis and hepatic specific responses could be a therapeutic target in this disorder."

Sirtuin3 (SIRT3) is a key factor for the regulation of both mitochondrial integrity and function. SIRT3 is downregulated and contributes in both cancer development and progression in ccRCC. The aim of this study is to investigate SIRT3-regulated mitochondrial biogenesis in ccRCC. SIRT3 overexpression alone reduced glucose uptake rate and enhanced membrane potential in mitochondria. ccRCC with overexpressed SIRT3 further improved the lethal effects when combined with anticancer drugs (Resveratrol, Everolimus and Temsirolimus). Cell viability was markedly decreased in a dose-dependent manner when treated with resveratrol or mTOR inhibitors in SIRT3 overexpressing ccRCC. In conclusion, SIRT3 improved mitochondrial functions in ccRCC through metabolic reprogramming. Mitochondrial reprogramming by SIRT3 regulation improves the sensitivity to anticancer drugs. The combination of SIRT3 and resveratrol functioned synergistically lethal effect in ccRCC."

However, little is known about the impact of falls and fall risk in the subacute phase of SCI/D, despite this being a time when fall prevention initiatives are delivered. Hence, we explored the impact of falls and fall risk in individuals with subacute SCI/D as they transitioned from inpatient rehabilitation to community living. Methods This qualitative photo-elicitation study used an inductive thematic analysis. Eight individuals (7 male) undergoing inpatient rehabilitation at a Canadian tertiary rehabilitation hospital due to a new SCI/D participated. Six months following discharge, photo-elicitation interviewing was used to understand the impact of falls and fall risk. Over 7–14 days, participants completed a photo-assignment that involved taking photographs in response to questions, such as what increases/decreases your likelihood of falling? A semi-structured interview followed, in which participants described their photographs and discussed their experiences with falls, fall risk and fall prevention training. Results Four themes were identified. 1) Risk factors and strategies identified through lived experience. Participants discovered their fall risk factors and fall prevention strategies through “trial and error”. 2) Influences on the individual’s perception of their fall risk. Prior experience with falls, including falls experienced by themselves as well as friends and family, influenced their perception of fall risk. 3) Experiencing life differently due to increased fall risk. A high fall risk reduced participation, increased negative emotions and decreased independence and quality of life. 4) Falls training in rehabilitation can be improved. Prior experiences with falls training varied; however, participants expressed a desire for comprehensive and individualized training. Conclusion Although participants’ experiences with falls and fall prevention varied, falls and the risk of falling can have a significant impact on the first year of living with a SCI/D."
https://openalex.org/W4281828308,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by long-term airflow obstruction with cigarette smoke as a key risk factor. Extracellular matrix (ECM) alterations in COPD may lead to small airway wall fibrosis. Altered collagen cross-linking, potentially mediated by the lysyl oxidase (LO) family of enzymes (LOX, LOXL1-4), orchestrates disturbed ECM homeostasis. In this study, we investigated the effects of smoking status and presence and severity of COPD on LOs gene and protein expression in the airways and the impact of LOs inhibition on airway contraction in an ex vivo mouse model. We used gene expression data from bronchial brushings, airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells in vitro and immunohistochemistry in lung tissue to assess smoke- and COPD-associated differences in LOs gene and protein expression in the small airways. We found higher LOX expression in current- compared to ex-smokers and higher LOXL1 expression in COPD compared to non-COPD patients. LOX and LOXL2 expression were upregulated in COPD ASM cells treated with cigarette smoke extract. LOXL1 and LOXL2 protein levels were higher in small airways from current- compared to non-smokers. In COPD patients, higher LOXL1 and lower LOX protein levels were observed, but no differences for LOXL2, LOXL3, and LOXL4 protein were detected in small airways. Inhibiting LOs activity increased airway contraction in murine lung slices. COPD-associated changes in LOs, in particular LOX and LOXL1, may be related to smoking and contribute to impaired airway function, providing potential novel targets for preventing or treating small airways changes in COPD."
https://openalex.org/W4281927870,"Infants born to obese mothers have a greater risk for childhood obesity and insulin resistance. However, the underlying biological mechanism remains elusive, which constitutes a significant roadblock for developing specific prevention strategies. Maternal adiponectin levels are lower in obese pregnant women, which is linked with increased placental nutrient transport and fetal overgrowth. We have previously reported that adiponectin supplementation to obese dams during the last four days of pregnancy prevented the development of obesity, glucose intolerance, muscle insulin resistance, and fatty liver in three months old offspring. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that 6-9-month-old offspring of obese dams show glucose intolerance associated with muscle insulin resistance and mitochondrial dysfunction and that normalization of maternal adiponectin in obese pregnant mice prevents the development of this phenotype in the offspring. Male and female offspring of obese mice exhibited in vivo glucose intolerance and insulin resistance at 6 and 9 months of age. In gastrocnemius muscles ex vivo, male and female offspring of obese dams showed reduced phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1Tyr-608 , AktThr-308 , and decreased Glut4 plasma membrane translocation upon insulin stimulation. These metabolic abnormalities in offspring born to obese mice were largely prevented by normalization of maternal adiponectin levels in late pregnancy. We provide evidence that low circulating maternal adiponectin is a critical mechanistic link between maternal obesity and the development of metabolic disease in offspring. Strategies aimed at improving maternal adiponectin levels may prevent long-term metabolic dysfunction in offspring of obese mothers."
https://openalex.org/W4282002290,"Activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) is a multidomain protein of retroviral origin with a vital role in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and memory formation in mammals. However, the mechanistic and structural basis of Arc function is poorly understood. Arc has an N-terminal domain (NTD) involved in membrane binding and a C-terminal domain (CTD) that binds postsynaptic protein ligands. In addition, the NTD and CTD both function in Arc oligomerisation, including assembly of retrovirus-like capsids involved in intercellular signalling. To obtain new tools for studies on Arc structure and function, we produced and characterised six high-affinity anti-Arc nanobodies (Nb). The CTD of rat and human Arc were both crystallised in ternary complexes with two Nbs. One Nb bound deep into the stargazin-binding pocket of Arc CTD and suggested competitive binding with Arc ligand peptides. The crystallisation of the human Arc CTD in two different conformations, accompanied by SAXS data and molecular dynamics simulations, paints a dynamic picture of the mammalian Arc CTD. The collapsed conformation closely resembles Drosophila Arc in capsids, suggesting that we have trapped a capsid-like conformation of the human Arc CTD. Our data obtained with the help of anti-Arc Nbs suggest that structural dynamics of the CTD and dimerisation of the NTD may promote the formation of capsids. Taken together, the recombinant high-affinity anti-Arc Nbs are versatile tools that can be further developed for studying mammalian Arc structure and function, as well as mechanisms of Arc capsid formation, both in vitro and in vivo. For example, the Nbs could serve as a genetically encoded tools for inhibition of endogenous Arc interactions in the study of neuronal function and plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W4285410983,"Background Malaria morbidity and mortality remain a challenge in Ghana. A promising childhood vaccine is being piloted in Ghana, however with the loss of its low-income status, Ghana is losing associated donor co-funding. User fees have been considered an alternative financing method, so this study utilised qualitative methods and explored caregivers’ willingness to pay for the malaria vaccine (RTS,S/AS01) to inform future service provision. Methods The study design was cross-sectional. Twenty in-depth interviews were conducted between February 2020 and March 2020 amongst a purposive sample of caregivers of RTS,S/AS01 eligible children, in the Volta region, Ghana. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed into English Language. Thematic analysis followed, using NVIVO12 to organise this data. Results Caregivers could distinguish between RTS,S/AS01 and routine vaccines and were willing to pay median GH₵5 (US$0.94), interquartile range GH₵3.75–5 (US$0.71–0.94) per dose of RTS,S/AS01. The maximum amount participants were willing to pay per dose was GH₵10 (US$1.88), interquartile range GH₵6–10 (US$1.13–1.88). Caregivers mentioned that they would work more to cover this cost because they were happy with services rendered to them during the RTS,S/AS01 pilot phase, and preferred vaccines over vector control measures. The results suggest that a willingness to pay was based on beliefs that the vaccine is fully effective. Although no participant declared that they would be unwilling to pay hypothetical user fees, there were still widespread concerns about affordability, with the majority feeling that the government should be responsible to pay for RTS,S/AS01. Conclusions Participants expressed a willingness to pay due to an appreciation of vaccines, shaped by personal experiences with immunisations and disease. Participants’ average income was lower than the national average, potentially affecting the perceived affordability of RTS,S/AS01. Because of the belief that RTS,S/AS01 is fully effective, caregivers may pay less attention to other preventative measures, thus unintentionally undermining malaria vector control."
https://openalex.org/W4281637847,"Base editing has emerged as a revolutionary technology for single nucleotide modifications. The cytosine and adenine base editors (CBEs and ABEs) have demonstrated great potential in clinical and fundamental research. However, screening and isolating target-edited cells remains challenging. In the current study, we developed a universal Adenine and Cytosine Base-Editing Antibiotic Resistance Screening Reporter (ACBE-ARSR) for improving the editing efficiency. To develop the reporter, the CBE-ARSR was first constructed and shown to be capable of enriching cells for those that had undergone CBE editing activity. Then, the ACBE-ARSR was constructed and was further validated in the editing assays by four different CBEs and two versions of ABE at several different genomic loci. Our results demonstrated that ACBE-ARSR, compared to the reporter of transfection (RoT) screening strategy, improved the editing efficiency of CBE and ABE by 4.6- and 1.9-fold on average, respectively. We found the highest CBE and ABE editing efficiencies as enriched by ACBE-ARSR reached 90% and 88.7%. Moreover, we also demonstrated ACBE-ARSR could be employed for enhancing simultaneous multiplexed genome editing. In conclusion, both CBE and ABE activity can be improved significantly using our novel ACBE-ARSR screening strategy, which we believe will facilitate the development of base editors and their application in biomedical and fundamental research studies."

As part of future evidence, this study was intended to assess nurses' job satisfaction and intention to leave their current work and its associated factors in federal public hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.An institutional based cross-sectional study design was used to conduct the study. A simple random sampling technique was employed to select 408 nurses from selected federal hospitals in Ethiopia. Self-administered questionnaire was used to collect the data. Logistic regression was employed to identify the predictor variables with consideration of statistical significance at P <0.05 adjusted odds ratios calculated at 95% CIs.The magnitudes of job satisfaction and intention to leave their current job among nurses in this study were 47.7% and 80.6%, respectively. Salary is imbalanced with demands [AOR = 2.85 (1.24, 6.57)], managers who have no personal plan for developing skills [AOR = 3.74 (1.58, 8.87)], stressful jobs [AOR = 0.28 (0.11, 0.71)], health problems are a reason for having thoughts about changing jobs [AOR = 3.02 (1.17, 7.79)], and a lack of development [AOR = 4.13 (1.51, 11.3)] were identified as determinant factors for intention to leave.The overall intention to leave their current job among nurses working in selected federal hospitals in Ethiopia was high. The government of Ethiopia should balance the salary of nurses with the current market level. Hospital leaders should plan the way nurses develop their educational and job carrier levels."
https://openalex.org/W4281692782,"Most existing studies on land consumption have used a reactive approach to assess the phenomenon. However, for evidence-based policies, an initiative-taking forecast has been touted to be more appropriate. This study, therefore, assessed current trends and efficiency of land consumption in the Greater Accra Region from 1987 to 2017, and predicted a 30-year future land consumption in a ""business-as-usual"" scenario. The study adopted maximum likelihood image classification techniques and ""combinatorial or"" to model land cover change for Greater Accra from 1987 to 2017 while the UN-Habitat land efficiency index was employed to model efficiency of land consumption. In addition, Leo-Breiman Forest based regression, was used to model a future land cover by using the 30 years land cover change as a dependant variable and a series of natural and anthropogenic factors as independent variables. Results showed that artificial surfaces increased from 4.2% to 33.1%, with an annual growth rate of 22.1% in 30 years. Land consumption was highly inefficient as only 4.2% of the region had a good proportion of population per land area. Factors which influenced artificial surface growth were population, distance from water bodies, poverty index, distance from sacred groves, proportion of agriculture population with a small margin of influence from soil and geology type. Landscape prediction showed that artificial surfaces will increase to 92.6% as more places are coated with concrete. The high rate of land inefficiency provides an opportunity for re-zoning by the Land Use and Spatial Planning Authority of Ghana to accommodate the growing population."
https://openalex.org/W4281693716,"Prion diseases are a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders that includes chronic wasting disease, which affects cervids and is highly transmissible. Given that chronic wasting disease prevalence exceeds 30% in some endemic areas of North America, and that eventual transmission to other mammalian species, potentially including humans, cannot be ruled out, novel control strategies beyond population management via hunting and/or culling must be investigated. Prion diseases depend upon post-translational conversion of the cellular prion protein, encoded by the Prnp gene, into a disease-associated conformation; ablation of cellular prion protein expression, which is generally well-tolerated, eliminates prion disease susceptibility entirely. Inspired by demonstrations of gene drive in caged mosquito species, we aimed to test whether a CRISPR/Cas9-based gene drive mechanism could, in principle, promote the spread of a null Prnp allele among mammalian populations. First, we showed that transient co-expression of Cas9 and Prnp -directed guide RNAs in RK13 cells generates indels within the Prnp open-reading frame, indicating that repair of Cas9-induced double-strand breaks by non-homologous end-joining had taken place. Second, we integrated a ~1.2 kb donor DNA sequence into the Prnp open-reading frame in N2a cells by homology-directed repair following Cas9-induced cleavages and confirmed that integration occurred precisely in most cases. Third, we demonstrated that electroporation of Cas9/guide RNA ribonucleoprotein complexes into fertilised mouse oocytes resulted in pups with a variety of disruptions to the Prnp open reading frame, with a new coisogenic line of Prnp -null mice obtained as part of this work. However, a technical challenge in obtaining expression of Cas9 in the male germline prevented implementation of a complete gene drive mechanism in mice."
https://openalex.org/W4281928280,"Objectives The Brazilian Family Health Strategy (FHS) is strongly associated with better health system performance, but there are no nationally-representative data examining individual-level primary care experiences in the country. Here, we examine reports of primary care experiences among adults with different forms of healthcare coverage (FHS, “traditional” public health posts, and private health plans). Methods Data are from the 2019 National Health Survey that included a shortened version of the Primary Care Assessment Tool (PCAT). PCAT questions were administered to a subsample of randomly-selected adults who had a doctor visit within the past 6 months and sought care in a primary care setting (9677 respondents). We used linear regression to examine the association between type of healthcare coverage and PCAT scores adjusted for sex, age, socioeconomic status, health status, geographic region and state of residence. Results Primary care experiences in the sample of Brazilians who had a doctor visit 6 months prior to the survey averaged a modest PCAT score of 57 out of 100. Regression models show that users of the FHS had superior primary care experiences, but with large variations across Brazilian regions and states. Individuals selected to respond to the PCAT questions were more likely to be female, older, and poorer, and to be in worse health than the general population. Conclusions Brazil’s FHS is associated with modest, but higher-reported primary care experiences than both traditional public health posts and those who have a private health plan. Future iterations of the PCAT module could enhance generalizability by including individuals who had a doctor visit in the past 12 (instead of 6) months."
https://openalex.org/W4285412599,"Adolescent and young adult (AYA) with cancer are at risk for developing sexual and reproductive problems; therefore, they have special needs. AYA with cancer treated in both pediatric and adult wards are a minority in Japan; thus, accumulating experience for supporting this unique patient population is difficult for nurses. Hence, this study aimed to clarify nurses' perceptions on support for sexual and reproductive issues among AYA with cancer. A questionnaire survey was administered to nurses at designated cancer hospitals across Japan who had been working for at least 1 year in a department involved in the treatment or follow-up of patients aged 15-39 years. Nurses were asked regarding their perceptions on support for sexual and reproductive issues faced by AYA with cancer. A total of 865 nurses responded to this survey; nurses affiliated with adult departments, those with more experience in cancer nursing, those affiliated with cancer-related academic and professional societies, and certified nurse specialists or certified nurses significantly recognized insufficient support for sexual and reproductive issues. However, nurses were hesitant and found it difficult to intervene in such issues. Nurses recognized the importance of providing support for sexual and reproductive issues but faced difficulties in addressing them. They need to discuss these issues and improve the care provided to AYA with cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4281624720,"While there has been significant research on the pressures facing acute hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been less interest in downstream community services which have also been challenged in meeting demand. This study aimed to estimate the theoretical cost-optimal capacity requirement for 'step down' intermediate care services within a major healthcare system in England, at a time when considerable uncertainty remained regarding vaccination uptake and the easing of societal restrictions.Demand for intermediate care was projected using an epidemiological model (for COVID-19 demand) and regressing upon public mobility (for non-COVID-19 demand). These were inputted to a computer simulation model of patient flow from acute discharge readiness to bedded and home-based Discharge to Assess (D2A) intermediate care services. Cost-optimal capacity was defined as that which yielded the lowest total cost of intermediate care provision and corresponding acute discharge delays.Increased intermediate care capacity is likely to bring about lower system-level costs, with the additional D2A investment more than offset by substantial reductions in costly acute discharge delays (leading also to improved patient outcome and experience). Results suggest that completely eliminating acute 'bed blocking' is unlikely economical (requiring large amounts of downstream capacity), and that health systems should instead target an appropriate tolerance based upon the specific characteristics of the pathway.Computer modelling can be a valuable asset for determining optimal capacity allocation along the complex care pathway. With results supporting a Business Case for increased downstream capacity, this study demonstrates how modelling can be applied in practice and provides a blueprint for use alongside the freely-available model code."
https://openalex.org/W4281631857,"Background Malnutrition is a public health problem, but outside the theoretical framework, little is known about the concrete intergenerational effects of malnutrition. Objective The objective of this study is to compare the nutritional status and health indicators of school children born to mothers who were treated for severe acute malnutrition (SAM). Methodology The study took place in Miti-Murhesa health zone in the Democratic Republic of Congo. This is a cohort study assessing the nutritional and health status of school children born to mothers who had been treated for SAM, based on WHZ or edema, in Lwiro hospital between 1988–2002 compared to children born to mothers who were not exposed to SAM. Stunting and thinness were evaluated by Height for Age Z-score (HAZ) and Body Mass Index by Age criteria (BMIAZ) respectively. On admission, blood samples were taken to assess anemia, HIV serology, hemogram and others biological indicators. Stool’s examinations were conducted by using Olympus optical microscope. Parametric and non-parametric tests were applied to compare the different variables in two groups. Results We identified 106 children aged 5–16 years (103 exposed and 58 unexposed) and we received 83.5% and 91.4% children respectively for anthropometric parameters. The mean of age was 7.9 ± 2.4 year in exposed group and 7.4 ± 2.1 year in unexposed group (p = 0.26). The prevalence of stunting was 68.3% in the exposed group and 67.3% in the unexposed group (p = 0.90). The prevalence of thinness was 12.8% in the exposed group and 9.6% in the unexposed group (p = 0.57). The biological profile (glycemia, urea, creatinine and hemogram) and the prevalence of intestinal parasites were similar in the two groups. Conclusion In this sample, in a malnutrition-endemic area, there was no statistically significant difference in nutrition and health indicators between school children born to mothers exposed to SAM and their community controls."
https://openalex.org/W4281642185,"Background Based on the self-determination theory, the psychological requirements for competence, autonomy, and relatedness boost beneficial exercise behaviour for healthy living. However, there is no valid, reliable Malay version scale to investigate the extent to which these psychological needs are met. The main purpose of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of a Malay version of the Psychological Need Satisfaction in Exercise (PNSE-M) scale. In addition, the purpose of this study was to confirm the measurement and structural invariance of the PNSE-M across gender. Methods The study participants included 919 students (male: 49.6%, female: 50.4%), with a mean age of 20.4 years (standard deviation = 1.5). The participants were selected through convenience sampling. The 18-item PNSE-M was used to measure psychological need satisfaction in exercise. The English version of the PNSE was translated into Malay using standard forward-backward translation. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and invariance tests were performed on the three domains of the PNSE-M model. Composite reliability (CR), average variance extracted (AVE), internal consistency based on Cronbach’s alpha, and test-retest reliabilities using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were also computed. Results After some model re-specification, the CFA findings based on the hypothesised measurement model of three factors and 18 items indicated acceptable factor structure (CFI = .936, TLI = .923, SRMR = .054, RMSEA = .059). The CR and AVE values were .864–.902 and .573–.617, respectively. Cronbach’s alpha was .891–.908, and the ICC was .980–.985. The findings supported the full measurement and structural invariance of the PNSE-M for both male and female participants. The CFA model matched the data well for both male (CFI = .926, SRMR = .057, RMSEA = .066) and female (CFI = .926, SRMR = .060, RMSEA = .065) participants. Conclusion The PNSE-M with three factors and 18 items is considered to be a valid, reliable instrument for university students in Malaysia. It is valid for use to make meaningful comparisons across gender."
https://openalex.org/W4281667642,"Due to the combined effect of biotic and abiotic constraints, rising population pressure, and inelastic demand in the crop and horticulture sector, Bangladesh has had to adopt heavily subsidized and intensified fertilizer policies to enhance crop productivity, achieve and sustain self-sufficiency in food production, and food security provision. Although the initiative has played a vital role in boosting production, it has also invigorated the unbalanced amount of fertilizer application practices raising questions about maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem services while feeding the nation’s population. Further research in this area must thus be applied to monitor and improve this sector. This study attempts to understand the issue by investigating the factors influencing Boro rice farmers’ adoption decisions of recommended fertilizer doses. The study employs an ordered probit model with a sample selection approach. The investigation is based on collected data from 405 randomly selected farmers using a face-to-face interview method. The farmers were classified into low, middle, high and non-adopter groups. The study revealed that farmers’ age, land typology, soil water retention, knowledge, and availability of cow dung significantly influenced farmers’ decision to apply fertilizers. However, farmers’ carry an aversion to following recommendations for fertilizer application due to their ambiguity about the whole system, their current fertilizer application-seeking behavior, and the lack of understanding of the environmental benefits of adoption. These issues urge policy interventions to initiate village-based demonstration programs that synthesize better synergies between recommended dose adoption, yield amelioration, sustainable soil care, and economics."
https://openalex.org/W4281747425,"Avian influenza virus (AIV) represents a major concern with productive implications in poultry systems but it is also a zoonotic agent that possesses an intrinsic pandemic risk. AIV is an enveloped, negative-sense and single-stranded RNA virus with a segmented genome. The eight genomic segments, comprising the whole genome, encode for eleven proteins. Within these proteins, Hemagglutinin (HA) and Neuraminidase (NA) are the most relevant for studies of evolution and pathogenesis considering their role in viral replication, and have also been used for classification purposes. Migratory birds are the main hosts and play a pivotal role in viral evolution and dissemination due to their migratory routes that comprise large regions worldwide. Altogether, viral and reservoir factors contribute to the emergence of avian influenza viruses with novel features and pathogenic potentials. The study aimed to conduct surveillance of AIVs in wild birds from Peru. A multi-site screening of feces of migratory birds was performed to isolate viruses and to characterize the whole genome sequences, especially the genes coding for HA and NA proteins. Four-hundred-twenty-one (421) fecal samples, collected between March 2019 and March 2020 in Lima, were obtained from 21 species of wild birds. From these, we isolated five AIV from whimbrel, kelp gull, Franklin's gulls and Mallard, which were of low pathogenicity, including four subtypes as H6N8, H13N6, H6N2 and H2N6. Genetic analysis of HA and NA genes revealed novel features in these viruses and phylogenetic analysis exhibited a close relationship with those identified in North America (US and Canada). Furthermore, H2N6 isolate presented a NA sequence with higher genetic relationship to Chilean isolates. These results highlight that the geographical factor is of major relevance in the evolution of AIV, suggesting that AIV circulating in Peru might represent a new site for the emergence of reassortant AIVs."

https://openalex.org/W4281924236,"Background Child growth in populations is commonly characterised by cross-sectional surveys. These require data collection from large samples of individuals across age ranges spanning 1–20 years. Such surveys are expensive and impossible in restrictive situations, such as, e.g. the COVID pandemic or limited size of isolated communities. A method allowing description of child growth based on small samples is needed. Methods Small samples of data (N~50) for boys and girls 6–20 years old from different socio-economic situations in Africa and Europe were randomly extracted from surveys of thousands of children. Data included arm circumference, hip width, grip strength, height and weight. Polynomial regressions of these measurements on age were explored. Findings Polynomial curves based on small samples correlated well (r = 0.97 to 1.00) with results of surveys of thousands of children from same communities and correctly reflected sexual dimorphism and socio-economic differences. Conclusions Fitting of curvilinear regressions to small data samples allows expeditious assessment of child growth in a number of characteristics when situations change rapidly, resources are limited and access to children is restricted."
https://openalex.org/W4282016560,"Little was known about the relationship between carrying mobile phone handsets by men and their risk perception of radiofrequency-electromagnetic field (RF-EMF) exposure due to carrying handsets close to the body. This study aimed to determine where men usually carried their handsets and to assess the relationship to risk perception of RF-EMF. Participants completed a self-administered questionnaire about mobile phone use, handset carrying locations, and levels of risk perception to RF-EMF. Data were analysed using linear regression models to examine if risk perception differed by mobile phone carrying location. The participants were 356 men, aged 18-72 years. They owned a mobile phone for 2-29 years, with over three quarters (78.7%) having a mobile phone for over 20 years. The most common locations that men kept their handsets when they were 'indoors' were: on a table/desk (54.0%) or in close contact with the body (34.7%). When outside, 54.0% of men kept the handset in the front trouser pocket. While making or receiving calls, 85.0% of men held their mobile phone handset against the head and 15.0% either used earphones or loudspeaker. Men who carried their handset in close contact with the body perceived higher risks from RF-EMF exposure compared to those who kept it away from the body (p<0.01). A substantial proportion of men carried their mobile phone handsets in close proximity to reproductive organs i.e. front pocket of trousers (46.5%). Men who kept their handset with the hand (p < .05), and those who placed it in the T-shirt pocket (p < .05), while the phone was not in use, were more likely to perceive health risks from their behaviour, compared to those who kept it away from the body. However, whether this indicates a causal relationship, remains open."

This study aimed to determine whether supplementation with the probiotic Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus HN001 reduced stress and improve psychological wellbeing in university students sitting examinations. Methods In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 483 undergraduate students received either the probiotic L . rhamnosus HN001, or placebo, daily during a university semester. Students completed measures of stress, anxiety, and psychological wellbeing at baseline and post-intervention before examinations. Mann Whitney U tests compared the change in psychological outcomes between groups. Results Of the 483 students, 391 (81.0%) completed the post-intervention questions. There was no significant difference between the probiotic and placebo supplemented groups in psychological health outcomes. The COVID19 pandemic restrictions may have influenced the typical trajectory of stress leading up to examinations. Conclusion We found no evidence of significant benefit of probiotics on the psychological health of university students. These findings highlight the challenges of conducting probiotic trials in human populations where the potential for contextual factors such as COVID19 response, and participant adherence to the intervention may influence results."
https://openalex.org/W4285505536,"Past research finds that a majority of gun and non-gun owners support key gun safety policies, yet gun owners tend to underestimate other gun owners' support for these policies. We predicted that these misperceptions of support might lead gun owners to view non-gun owners as being less similar to themselves, which might undermine intergroup cooperation to promote gun safety policies and fuel intergroup animosity. Importantly, we also predicted that correcting these misperceptions would be an effective way to reduce intergroup division and enhance intergroup cooperation. We tested these predictions across two studies in which participants were randomly assigned to read information designed to correct misperceptions of gun owner support or to read other, control information. Across both studies, we find that correcting gun owners' misperceptions of gun owner support for gun safety policies leads to greater perceptions of identity overlap between gun and non-gun owners, greater willingness to work with each other to promote gun safety policies, and less negative affect towards each other. This suggests that correcting gun owner misperceptions of gun owners' support for gun safety policies might be an effective intervention to facilitate intergroup cooperation to promote these policies. Therefore, efforts to promote gun safety policies might benefit from educating gun owners about the degree of support for these policies that already exists among gun owners. Doing so might present a simple and cost-effective way to mobilize gun owners in support of these policies."
https://openalex.org/W4281619237,"Background There is no specific tool for measuring the professional resilience of emergency nurses. Therefore, the present study aimed to design and psychometrically evaluate a new tool named the emergency nurses’ professional resilience tool. Method This mixed-method sequential exploratory study was conducted in two phases: (1) item generation using literature review and evaluation of the results of a qualitative study and (2) psychometric evaluation of the developed scale. The face, content, and construct validity (exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis), reliability (internal consistency, relative, and absolute), and accountability were assessed in the population of Iranian nurses (N = 465) during March 2019-June 2020. Results The tool designed for assessing the professional resilience of Iranian nurses included 37 items. The average scale content validity index (S-CVI/Ave) was equal to 0.94. The exploratory factor analysis revealed five factors, including professional competencies, emotional-cognitive characteristics, external support, in addition to behavioral and cognitive strategies, and explained 75.59% of the whole variance. Cronbach’s alpha and intraclass correlation were 0.915 and 0.888, respectively. Construct validity for five factors was established with acceptable model fit indices [Chi–square/df = 1336.56/619, p &lt; .001]; [Comparative Fit Index [CFI] = 0.96]; [Non-Normed Fit Index [NNFI] = 0.96]; [Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) = 0.074 and 90 Percent Confidence Interval = (0.069; 0.080)]; and [SRMR = 0.095]. Conclusions According to the findings of the current study, the emergency nurses’ professional resilience tool can be used by healthcare managers as a valid and reliable scale to evaluate the professional resilience of nurses to designate them as nurses working in emergency and disaster situations."
https://openalex.org/W4281653849,"The measurement of work time for individual tasks by using video has made a significant contribution to a framework for productivity improvement such as value stream mapping (VSM). In the past, the work time has been often measured manually, but this process is quite costly and labor-intensive. For these reasons, automation of work analysis at the worksite is needed. There are two main methods for computing spatio-temporal information: by 3D-CNN, and by temporal computation using LSTM after feature extraction in the spatial domain by 2D-CNN. These methods has high computational cost but high model representational power, and the latter has low computational cost but relatively low model representational power. In the manufacturing industry, the use of local computers to make inferences is often required for practicality and confidentiality reasons, necessitating a low computational cost, and so the latter, a lightweight model, needs to have improved performance. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a method that pre-trains the image encoder module of a work detection model using an image segmentation model. This is based on the CNN-LSTM structure, which separates spatial and temporal computation and enables us to include heuristics such as workers’ body parts and work tools in the CNN module. Experimental results demonstrate that our pre-training method reduces over-fitting and provides a greater improvement in detection performance than pre-training on ImageNet."

This predictor's performance is comparable to the point spread at the start of the game and improves thereafter with little bias. We define a measure of success as the change in a team's win probability over the course of a possession, and show that streaks in this measure are highly unlikely to be random. Further, this finding holds when controlling for the effects of clock management in the fourth quarter of football games, when win probability can increase incrementally for the leading team as the game continues. By defining momentum as an increase in win probability over the course of at least three successive changes in possession, we show some ability to anticipate its emergence, based on game state, using a second neural network. The possibility of using this knowledge for strategic advantage is discussed. We consider these results in the context of examples from National Football League games, including that from Super Bowl LI (Atlanta Falcons versus the New England Patriots), and end with some discussion of future extensions to this work."
https://openalex.org/W4281750467,"Determining the optimal amount of cash stock reserved in each bank branch is a strategic decision. A certain level of cash stock must be kept and ready for cash withdrawal needs at a branch. However, holding too much cash not only forfeits opportunities to make profit from the exceeding amount of cash in the stock but also increases insurance cost. This paper presents cash stock strategies for bank branches by using deep learning. Deep learning models were applied to historical data collected by a retail bank to predict the cash withdrawals and deposits. Data preparation and feature selection to identify important attributes from the bank branch data were performed. In the prediction process, two Recurrent Neural Network techniques—Long Short-Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Units methods—were compared. Then prediction errors were measured and statistically tested for their probability distributions. These distributions together with the predicted values were used in determining the lower and upper bounds for holding the cash stock. These bounds were employed to recommend the cash stock level strategies by having two options for different situations. The impacts of COVID-19 were also tested and discussed. According to the bank under this study, the proposed strategies can reduce the amount of cash stock by more than 10% for which was their initial target. Hence, the costs of cash management such as insurance cost and cash transportation cost were reduced. Moreover, the excess cash could be used for other purposes of the bank."
https://openalex.org/W4281755121,"Temperate zone ungulates like red deer ( Cervus elaphus ) show pronounced seasonal acclimatisation. Hypometabolism during winter is associated with cardiovascular changes, including a reduction in heart rate ( f H ) and temporal peripheral vasoconstriction. How anaesthesia with vasoactive substances such as medetomidine affect the seasonally acclimatised cardiovascular system is not yet known. We anaesthetised eleven healthy female red deer with medetomidine (0.1 mg/kg) and tiletamine/zolazepam (3 mg/kg) twice in winter ( ad libitum and restricted feed) and in summer ( ad libitum and restricted feed), with a two-week washout-period in-between, to test for the effect of season, food availability and supplementation with omega-3 or omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) on f H and arterial blood pressure (ABP) during anaesthesia. Six animals received pellets enriched with omega-6 fatty acids (FA), and five animals with omega-3 FA. Anaesthesia significantly decreased f H in summer but not in winter and ABP was lower in winter ( p &lt; 0.05). The combination of omega-6 FA enriched pellets and food restriction resulted in a lower f H and higher ABP during anaesthesia with more pronounced changes in winter ( p &lt; 0.001). Our results demonstrate that season, food availability and type of PUFA supplementation in red deer affect the cardiovascular system during anaesthesia."

Effective risk communication and community engagement can be achieved when assisted by health learning materials. However, their utilization was not known in Ethiopia. Therefore, the present study aimed to assess the utilization of COVID-19 health learning materials (HLMs), and explore barriers and facilitating factors. Methods A sequential explanatory mixed-methods study consisting of two phases was carried out. The first phase was a cross-sectional survey to assess the utilization of COVID-19 HLMs and their predictors. In this phase, a multistage sampling technique was used to select 530 health workers. A self-administered structured questionnaire was used for data collection. Epi-data manager version 4.6.0.2 and STATA version 16 were used for data entry and analyses, respectively. Descriptive analyses were carried out as necessary. Ordinal logistic regression analyses were done to identify the predictors of COVID-19 HLMs utilization. Phase two is a qualitative study to explore enablers and barriers to COVID-19 HLMs utilization. A judgmental sampling technique was used and 14 key informants were recruited. The collected data were uploaded into Atlas ti version 7.0.71. An inductive process of thematic analysis was employed and the data were coded, categorized, and thematized. Results Findings showed that out of the total 530 respondents, 210(39.6%), 117(22.1%), and 203(38.3%) of them never use COVID-19 HLMs, use sometimes, and always, respectively. Health workers’ perceived quality of COVID-19 HLMs [AOR = 6.44 (95% CI: 4.18–9.94)], health workers’ perceived usefulness of COVID-19 HLMs [AOR = 2.82 (95% CI: 1.88–4.22)], working facility [AOR = 1.83 (95% CI: 1.07–3.14)], educational level of the respondents [AOR = 1.73 (95% CI: 1.11–2.72)] and availability of COVID-19 HLMs [AOR = 1.45(95% CI: 1.01–2.08)] had statistically significant association with the utilization status of COVID-19 HLMs. Findings from the qualitative study showed that materials-related factors, and structure and health workers-related factors had influence on HLMs utilization. Conclusions In this study, we found that only a few of the respondents were regularly utilizing COVID-19 HLMs. Perceived quality, usefulness, and availability of HLMs, and health workers’ educational status and working facility determined the level of COVID-19 HLMs utilization. There is a need for giving due attention to HLMs, evaluating their quality, availing them to health facilities, and providing training for health workers."
https://openalex.org/W4281852247,"The analgesic specificity of navicular bursa (NB) anesthetic infiltration is still questionable. The study aimed to determine the mechanical nociceptive threshold of non-specific analgesia in the dorsal lamellar stratum, as well as in the sole, coronary band, and heel bulbs of the hoof, after navicular bursa anesthetic infiltration. Six healthy horses with no clinical or radiographic changes of the digits and no communication between the NB and the distal interphalangeal joint, were used. After random selection, the NB of one of the forelimbs was infiltrated with 2% lidocaine and the contralateral one with lactated ringer’s solution. Contrast was added to confirm radiographic infiltration. The mechanical nociceptive threshold was determined using a portable pressure dynamometer, before and at various times after the infiltration, in 10 points of the hoof. The effects of time and treatment were verified by ANOVA (P&lt;0.05). There was no statistical difference in the values of the mechanical nociceptive threshold (P&gt;0.05) in all regions evaluated. However, in one of the six hooves that receives lidocaine, complete absence of response to the painful stimulus (maximum force of 6 Kg over an area of 38.46 mm 2 , for a maximum of 4 seconds) was observed in the dorsal lamellae between 30 and 60 min after infiltration. In conclusion, lidocaine infiltration of NB did not promote significant increases in the nociceptive threshold of the sole, coronary band, bulbs of the heel and dorsal lamellae clinically healthy horses. However, the occurrence of analgesia in one of the six hooves subjected to NB anesthesia indicates that the technique may not be fully specific in few horses."

https://openalex.org/W4281965237,"Discarding practices have become a source of concern for the perennation of marine resources, prompting efforts of discard reduction around the globe. However, little is known about the fate of discards in marine environments. Discarding may provide food for various marine consumers, potentially affecting food web structure and stability. Yet, quantifying reliance upon discards is difficult because identity and frequency of discards may change according to multiple factors, and most previously used diet assessment techniques do not allow to assume consistency of feeding strategies over time. One currently untested hypothesis is that significant contribution of discards over time should reflect in increased trophic level (TL) of marine fauna, particularly in low TL consumers. Here, we explored this hypothesis by modeling the TL and assimilated diet of consumers living in fishing grounds subject to important discarding activity using stable isotope analysis. We found indications that benthic invertebrates and Chondrichthyes may depict a higher than expected TL, while other fish tend to depict similar to lower TL compared to global averages from the literature. Based on prior knowledge of discard consumption in the same area, stable isotope mixing models congruently revealed that discards may represent substantial portions of the assimilated diet of most benthic invertebrate macrofauna, cephalopods and Chondrichthyes. We highlight limitations and challenges of currently used diet assessment techniques to study discard consumption and stress that understanding their reintegration in marine food webs is crucial in the context of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management and to better understand the functioning of marine ecosystems subject to fishing."
https://openalex.org/W4282049762,"Outbreaks of H5-type highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in poultry have been reported in various parts of the world. To respond to these continuous threats, numerous surveillance programs have been applied to poultry raising facilities as well as wild birds. In Korea, a surveillance program was developed aimed at providing a preemptive response to possible outbreaks at poultry farms. The purpose of this study is to comprehensively present the risks of HPAI evaluated by this program in relation to actual outbreak farms during the epidemic of 2020/2021. A deep learning-based risk assessment program was trained based on the pattern of livestock vehicles visiting poultry farms and HPAI outbreaks to calculate the risk of HPAI for farms linked by the movement of livestock vehicles (such farms are termed “epidemiologically linked farms”). A total of 7,984 risk assessments were conducted, and the results were categorized into four groups. The proportion of the highest risk level was greater in duck farms (13.6%) than in chicken farms (8.8%). Among the duck farms, the proportion of the highest risk level was much greater in farms where breeder ducks were raised (accounting for 26.4% of the risk) than in farms where ducks were raised to obtain meat (12.8% of the risk). A higher risk level was also found in cases where the species of the outbreak farm and epidemiologically linked farms were the same (proportion of the highest risk level = 13.2%) compared to that when the species between the two farms were different (7.9%). The overall proportion of farms with HPAI outbreaks among epidemiologically linked farms (attack rate, AR) was 1.7% as HPAI was confirmed on 67 of the 3,883 epidemiologically linked farms. The AR was highest for breeder ducks (15.3%) among duck farms and laying hens (4.8%) among chicken farms. The AR of the pairs where livestock vehicles entered the inner farm area was 1.3 times (95% confidence interval: 1.4–2.9) higher than that of all pairs. With the risk information provided, customized preventive measures can be implemented for each epidemiologically linked farm. The use of this risk assessment program would be a good example of information-based surveillance and support decision-making for controlling animal diseases."

These effects are counteracted in vitro by acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), but no prior study investigated whether ASA is associated with decreased out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) risk on a population level. Therefore, we studied whether ASA and other antiplatelet drugs (carbasalate calcium, clopidogrel) are associated with decreased risk of OHCA.We conducted a population-based case-control study among individuals (772 OHCA-cases with documented VT/VF, 2444 non-OHCA-controls) who had used antiplatelet drugs in the year before index-date (OHCA-date), and studied the association between current antiplatelet drug use and OHCA-risk with multivariable logistic regression analysis.ASA use was associated with reduced OHCA-risk (adjusted odds ratio (ORadj) 0.6 [0.5-0.8]), and more so in women (ORadj 0.3 [0.2-0.6]) than in men (ORadj 0.7 [0.5-0.95], Pinteraction 0.021). Carbasalate calcium was associated with decreased OHCA-risk in women (ORadj 0.5 [0.3-0.9]), but not in men (ORadj 1.3 [0.96-1.7], Pinteraction 0.005). Clopidogrel was not associated with reduction in OHCA-risk. Risk reduction associated with ASA in patients with OHCA was similar in the presence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (ORadj 0.6 [0.4-0.9]) and in the absence of AMI (ORadj 0.7 [0.4-1.2]).ASA use was associated with reduced OHCA-risk in both sexes, and more so in women, while carbasalate calcium only protected women. Clopidogrel was not associated with reduced OHCA-risk."

Methods We used multilevel mixed effects logistic regression to examine the association of individual and neighbourhood level variables on HIV prevalence based on data from the 2013–14 and 2018 Zambia Demographic and Health Surveys, population-based cross-sectional surveys. The analysis was restricted to young people (15–24 years) with HIV serostatus results (n = 11,751 and n = 10,154). HIV serostatus was the outcome variable and socioeconomic status was measured by wealth, education and employment. Results Overall, at individual level, education was associated with reduced odds of HIV infection among young women and men. Conversely, relative wealth was generally associated with increased odds of infection for both young women and men. Young, employed men were at reduced odds of HIV infection than the unemployed. Living in neighbourhoods with higher average level of education was associated with higher odds of HIV infection. In 2013–14, 13% and 11% of the variation in HIV infection among young men and women was attributed to neighbourhoods, while 20% and 11% variation was attributed to neighbourhoods in 2018. Inclusion of individual and neighbourhood variables in the full regression model accounted for 65.7% and 59.5% of explained variance in 2013–14 and 64.6% and 44.3% in 2018, for women and men, respectively. This reduced unexplained variance by an average of 56% in 2013–14 and 29% in 2018. Conclusion We found that HIV infection among young people in Zambia is more strongly associated with individual-level socioeconomic factors compared to neighbourhood factors. Individual-level education remains an important socioeconomic factor associated with reduced odds of HIV infection. This suggests that the HIV response in Zambia should still focus on individual level prevention strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4285507587,"Both immigration and a troubling housing deficit have increased rapidly in Sweden over the past 20 years. In this internet-based field experiment, we investigated whether there exists discrimination in the Swedish private rental housing market based on the names of apartment seekers. We used a correspondent test by randomly submitting equivalent applications from four fictitious, highly educated, and seemingly “well-behaved” male applicants in response to a number of randomly selected private housing ads. Each advertising landlord received applications from two applicants with names signaling Swedish, Arab/Muslim, Eastern European, or East Asian ethnicity. Our results show that the person with a name associated with the dominant ethnic group received most callbacks from the landlords, while the persons with Eastern European- and East Asian sounding names, and especially the Arab/Muslim-sounding name, yielded significantly lower callback rates. Moreover, each applicant’s callback rates are about the same regardless of whom he was paired with, reinforcing our result that a person’s name clearly matters when applying for an apartment. The comparisons with previous discrimination research focusing on the Swedish housing market show that the situation for a male person with an Arabic/Muslim-sounding name has at least not improved in Sweden in the past decade."
