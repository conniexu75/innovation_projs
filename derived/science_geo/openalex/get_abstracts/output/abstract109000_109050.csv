https://openalex.org/W2087432006,"The hypothesis that oxygen free radicals are causally involved in the aging process was tested by a study of the effects of simultaneous overexpression of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase and catalase. As compared to diploid controls, transgenic flies carrying three copies of each of these genes exhibited as much as a one-third extension of life-span, a longer mortality rate doubling time, a lower amount of protein oxidative damage, and a delayed loss in physical performance. Results provide direct support for the free radical hypothesis of aging."

https://openalex.org/W1970458627,"Sympathetic neurons undergo RNA and protein synthesis-dependent programmed cell death when deprived of nerve growth factor. To test the hypothesis that neuronal programmed cell death is a consequence of conflicting growth signals which cause the inappropriate activation of cell cycle genes, we have analyzed cell cycle-related genes for their expression in postmitotic neurons. Surprisingly, many of these genes are expressed in neurons, although cdc2, cdk2, and cyclin A are not. During programmed cell death, the expression of most of these genes, including several cyclins and the Rb and p53 tumor suppressor genes, decreases similar to that of neuronal genes. In contrast, cyclin D1 expression is selectively induced in dying neurons. Cyclin D1 mRNA levels peak 15-20 hr after nerve growth factor withdrawal, concurrent with the time that neurons become committed to die. These results provide an extensive characterization of cell cycle gene expression in postmitotic neurons and provide the evidence for a gene induced during neuronal programmed cell death."
https://openalex.org/W1970825176,"Activation of the serine-threonine kinase p34cdc2 at an inappropriate time during the cell cycle leads to cell death that resembles apoptosis. Premature activation of p34cdc2 was shown to be required for apoptosis induced by a lymphocyte granule protease. The kinase was rapidly activated and tyrosine dephosphorylated at the initiation of apoptosis. DNA fragmentation and nuclear collapse could be prevented by blocking p34cdc2 activity with excess peptide substrate, or by inactivating p34cdc2 in a temperature-sensitive mutant. Premature p34cdc2 activation may be a general mechanism by which cells induced to undergo apoptosis initiate the disruption of the nucleus."

Although regeneration is accomplished by the division of mature hepatocytes, the replicative potential of these cells is unknown. Here, the replicative capacity of adult liver cells and their medical usefulness as donor cells for transplantation were investigated by transfer of adult mouse liver cells into transgenic mice that display an endogenous defect in hepatic growth potential and function. The transplanted liver cell populations replaced up to 80 percent of the diseased recipient liver. These findings demonstrate the enormous growth potential of adult hepatocytes, indicating the feasibility of liver cell transplantation as a method to replace lost or diseased hepatic parenchyma."

https://openalex.org/W2009435363,"Intracellular vesicles destined to fuse with the plasma membrane and secrete their contents must have a mechanism for specifically interacting with the appropriate target membrane. Such a mechanism is now suggested by the demonstration of specific interaction between vesicular proteins and plasma membrane proteins. The vesicle-associated membrane proteins (VAMPs) 1 and 2 specifically bind the acceptor membrane proteins syntaxin 1A and 4 but not syntaxin 2 or 3. The binding site is within amino acids 194 to 267 of syntaxin 1A, and the approximate equilibrium dissociation constants is 4.7 x 10(-6) molar. These data suggest a physical basis for the specificity of intracellular vesicular transport."
https://openalex.org/W2005222967,"Induction of the yeast gene PHO5 is mediated by the transcription factors PHO2 and PHO4. PHO5 transcription is not detectable in high phosphate; it is thought that the negative regulators PHO80 and PHO85 inactivate PHO2 and PHO4. Here it is reported that PHO80 has homology to yeast cyclins and interacts with PHO85, a p34cdc2/CDC28-related protein kinase. The PHO80-PHO85 complex phosphorylates PHO4; this phosphorylation is correlated with negative regulation of PHO5. These results demonstrate the existence of a cyclin-cdk complex that is used for a regulatory process other than cell-cycle control and identify a physiologically relevant substrate for this complex."

https://openalex.org/W1973420297,"Mutations in the adult human skeletal muscle Na+ channel alpha subunit cause the disease paramyotonia congenita. Two paramyotonia congenita mutations, R1448H and R1448C, substitute histidine and cysteine for arginine in the S4 segment of domain 4. These mutations, expressed in a cell line, have only small effects on the activation of Na+ currents, but mutant channels inactivate more slowly with less voltage dependence than wild-type channels and exhibit an enhanced rate of recovery from inactivation. Increase of extracellular pH made the rate of inactivation of R1448H similar to that of R1448C, suggesting that this residue has an extracellular location and that its charge is important for normal inactivation. Analysis of single-channel data reveals that mutant channels inactivate normally from closed states, but poorly from the open state. The data suggest a critical role for the S4 helix of domain 4 in coupling between activation and inactivation."

https://openalex.org/W1969167894,"We have addressed the role of Ca2+ channels in mossy fiber synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation (LTP). Whereas the induction of mossy fiber LTP is entirely normal when synaptic transmission is blocked by the glutamate receptor antagonist kynurenate, LTP is blocked in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. These findings suggest that presynaptic Ca2+ entry is essential for mossy fiber LTP. Therefore, the role of different types of presynaptic Ca2+ channels in synaptic transmission and LTP was investigated. Mossy fiber responses were little affected by the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine. They were blocked partially by omega-conotoxin-GVIA (N-type) and almost entirely by omega-agatoxin-IVA (P-type). None of these antagonists blocked mossy fiber LTP, nor was its expression associated with a change in sensitivity of synaptic transmission to either of the two toxins. These results, together with previous findings, suggest that the induction of mossy fiber LTP is critically dependent on the entry of Ca2+ into the presynaptic terminal to trigger a series of steps resulting in the long lasting enhancement of evoked glutamate release. Whereas P-type Ca2+ channels are of primary importance in mossy fiber synaptic transmission, both the induction and expression of mossy fiber LTP can occur in the absence of P-type (or N-type) Ca2+ channels."

https://openalex.org/W2016870828,"Interactions between neurofilament side arms may modulate axon caliber. To investigate this hypothesis, we derived transgenic mice expressing a fusion protein in which the carboxyl terminus of the high molecular weight neurofilament protein (NFH) was replaced by beta-galactosidase. The transgene, regulated by NFH sequences, was expressed in projection neurons. However, the fusion protein remained in perikarya precipitating large filamentous aggregates. Axons were not invested with neurofilaments and developed only small calibers. Perikaryal aggregates, with similar structural features, are associated with neurodegenerative diseases, but these mice showed few ill effects and their neurons rarely degenerated. We conclude that an organized neurofilament cytoskeleton is required by axons to achieve large calibers but is not essential for neuronal function or extended survival."

https://openalex.org/W2096267101,"To determine the role of cell-cell interactions in Purkinje cell survival and dendritic differentiation, perinatal mouse Purkinje cells were purified, and their development was analyzed in vitro. In isolation at low density, Purkinje cell survival was poor, improved by neuronal contacts, either with purified granule neurons or with Purkinje cells themselves. Moreover, coculture with specific cell populations led to widely different degrees of Purkinje cell differentiation. Purified Purkinje cells cultured alone or with an inappropriate afferent, the mossy fibers, did not progress beyond immature forms. With astroglia, Purkinje cells had thin smooth processes. Proper Purkinje cell differentiation was driven only by coculture with granule cells, resulting in dendrites with spines receiving synapses. These results suggest that Purkinje cell differentiation is regulated by local epigenetic factors, provided in large part by the granule neuron."

https://openalex.org/W2047407364,"The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) is expressed at very high levels in cerebellar Purkinje cells. Within these neurons, it has a widespread distribution throughout the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is present at particularly high concentrations at sites of membrane appositions within peculiar stacks of ER cisternae. Here we report that stacks of ER cisternae, reminiscent of those observed in Purkinje cells, can be induced by overexpression of full-length IP3R, but not of mutant forms of the protein in COS cells. Within these stacks the IP3R forms a crystalline array at apposed cisternal faces. Additionally, we show that Purkinje cell stacks are not permanent structures. Our findings suggest that massive stack formation in purkinje cells represents an adaptive response of the ER to hypoxic conditions and is due to the presence of the high concentration of IP3R in its membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1784106556,"Apoptosis is a term used to describe certain forms of physiological cell death that occur during embryogenesis, differentiation, and normal cell turnover. Previous reports concerning the effects of calcium ionophores on rodent thymocytes and the pore-forming proteins perforin and staphylococcal alpha-toxin on murine tumor cells led to the suggestion that simply raising intracellular calcium causes apoptotic cell death. This hypothesis was tested using two ionophores, A23187 and valinomycin, and two pore-forming agents, melittin and staphylococcal alpha-toxin, on four murine tumor cell lines. Although treatment with these agents could raise intracellular calcium, and in some instances cause DNA fragmentation, only valinomycin caused apoptosis. In contrast to previous reports, our results suggest that raising intracellular calcium and inducing internucleosomal DNA fragmentation is not sufficient to elicit apoptotic cell death in all cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2010039046,"In response to changes in membrane potential, voltage-dependent ion channel proteins undergo conformational rearrangements that lead to channel opening. These rearrangements move a net charge, measured as ""gating current"", across the membrane. Here we characterize the effects of the pharmacological blocker 4-aminopyridine on both the K+ and gating currents of wild-type and mutant Shaker K+ channels. Our results indicate that the activation of these channels involves two distinct types of structural rearrangement. In addition to independent Hodgkin and Huxley type rearrangements for each of the four subunits, which are responsible for most of the gating charge movement, Shaker channels interconvert between two quaternary conformations during activation. The transition between the two quaternary states moves about 10% of the total gating charge, and it is selectively blocked by 4-aminopyridine."
https://openalex.org/W2024538588,"CD8 is either an alpha alpha homodimer or an alpha beta heterodimer, although most peripheral CD8-lineage T cells express only the CD8 alpha beta heterodimer. The physiological function of CD8 beta was elucidated with mice that were chimeric for the homozygous disruption of the CD8 beta gene. The CD8 beta-1- T cells developed normally to CD4+CD8+ stage, but did not efficiently differentiate further, which resulted in few peripheral CD8+ T cells. The number of peripheral CD8+ T cells was restored by transfer of an exogenous CD8 beta gene into CD8 beta-deficient T cells. Thus, CD8 beta is necessary for the maturation of CD8+ T cells."

https://openalex.org/W2085416338,"We have identified a set of retinal basal glia, designated RBG cells, in the axon layer of the developing Drosophila eye disc. In vivo pulse labeling with bromodeoxyuridine shows that these cells originate in the optic stalk and migrate into the disc. In mutants lacking photoreceptor axons, RBG cells accumulate in the optic stalk, but do not invade the disc. The association of RBG cells with photoreceptor axons, their origin in the optic stalk, and their migration into the retina are in common with the behavior of astrocytes in the developing mammalian retina."
https://openalex.org/W1993894835,"We tested the dependence of axon growth on microtubule (MT) nucleation from the neuronal centrosome. Nocodazole diminished MTs in freshly plated neurons by > 99%. Within 5 min of drug removal, MTs reassembled at the centrosome. This response was inhibited in cells microinjected with gamma-tubulin antibody. Within 2 hr of drug removal, uninjected neurons grew > 500 microns of axon. In roughly half of the antibody-injected cells, axon growth was abolished and MT levels were reduced by approximately 87% compared with uninjected cells. In the other antibody-injected cells, axon growth was compromised but not abolished, and MT levels were reduced by approximately 38%. Thus inhibition of MT nucleation at the centrosome hindered MT reassembly, and depending on the severity of this response, axon growth was either compromised or abolished."

https://openalex.org/W2047502560,"A bang-sensitive enhancer trap line was isolated in a behavioral screen. The flies show a weak bang-sensitive paralysis, recovering after about 7 s. The P element insert is localized at 93B1-2 on the salivary chromosomes, the site of the (Na+,K+)ATPase alpha subunit gene. Molecular characterization demonstrates that the transposon is inserted into the first intron of this gene. This insertion leads to normal-sized transcripts, but reduced levels of expression. This change is also reflected in lower amounts of a normal-sized alpha subunit protein. Mutant flies show a much greater sensitivity to ouabain, likewise indicating, on a functional level, a reduction in Na+ pump activity. Furthermore, the bang-sensitive behavior can also be mimicked by injecting sublethal doses of ouabain into wild-type flies. The molecular and functional evidence indicates that the insertion has produced a hypomorphic mutation of the (Na+,K+)ATPase alpha subunit gene, opening the way to future studies of the regulation of the Na+ pump."

https://openalex.org/W2097461526,"Alopecia is a common side effect of several anti-cancer drugs, including doxorubicin. Based on our recent observation that a monoclonal antibody (MAD11) directed against this anthracycline inhibits the systemic toxic effect of the drug in mice, we investigated the possibility that MAD11 administered topically might protect against doxorubicin-induced alopecia. In 31 of 45 young rats treated intraperitoneally with doxorubicin, alopecia was completely prevented by topical treatment of the skin with liposome-incorporated anti-doxorubicin monoclonal antibody. This type of treatment might find relevance in preventing anthracycline-induced alopecia in cancer patients. Our findings also provide the first demonstration that liposome-entrapped monoclonal antibodies are capable of penetrating the stratum corneum of the skin without losing their function."

https://openalex.org/W2029201935,"125I-omega-conotoxin binding to neuroblastoma cells at 37 degrees C continuously increased, reaching a plateau after 6-8 hr; this was up to 6 times higher than that observed at lower temperatures. The same effect was induced by short pulses with omega-conotoxin followed by a chase period at 37 degrees C in control medium. Cd2+ also induced up-regulation of surface 125I-omega-conotoxin-binding sites. Fura-2 and patch-clamp experiments showed that the recruited binding sites corresponded to functional voltage-operated Ca2+ channels. Permeabilization experiments revealed a large intracellular pool of 125I-omega-conotoxin-binding sites, whose recruitment to the plasmamembrane was prevented by brefeldin A and nocodazole. These data suggest that specific stimuli might induce voltage-operated Ca2+ channel translocation to plasmamembrane and, in this way, modulate presynaptic events."

https://openalex.org/W1686402246,"The subcellular distribution of Gs alpha was characterized in S49 lymphoma cells with two polyclonal antisera directed against specific COOH- and NH2-terminal epitopes. Nonspecific binding was determined in each subcellular compartment by incubating cyc- S49 cells, known to be deficient in Gs alpha and its mRNA, with primary and secondary antisera. Small proportions of total specific binding sites were localized to the plasmalemma as well as the nuclear envelope. Because of their small size, these compartments contained a high concentration of Gs alpha. However, most of the specific binding sites were found in nonstructured cytoplasm and within the nucleus. Specific binding was abolished or significantly reduced by preincubating primary antisera with their peptide immunogens but not with an irrelevant peptide. Intracellular Gs alpha immunoreactive binding sites did not colocalize with gold-conjugated transferrin in cells preincubated with this ligand to mark a classical endocytotic pathway. The intracellular and intranuclear location of Gs alpha was confirmed with confocal microscopy of S49 cells immunostained with specific primary and fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies. Gs alpha was also detected with immunoblots of proteins extracted from purified S49 cell nuclei. Thus, Gs alpha is abundantly distributed in intracellular and intranuclear sites in S49 cells and occurs in loci distinct from organelles of the transferrin pathway. The substantial intracellular distribution of Gs alpha suggests that Gs may subserve intracellular and, perhaps, intranuclear functions that may be important in proliferating cells."

https://openalex.org/W1619767588,"Traditionally, heat-shock proteins were believed to be located intracellularly; however, recent studies have demonstrated that under certain circumstances these proteins can be located at the cell surface. Murine ascites developed from the anti-mycobacterial hsp65 hybridoma ML30 have been shown to contain an antibody that binds to the surface of a range of stimulated myelomonocytic cell lines; however, as the purified ML30 monoclonal antibody produced in vitro did not bind to these cell lines, the results were not considered conclusive evidence of cell-surface expression of the hsp60 homologue of the mycobacterial hsp 65 on human cells. In an effort to clarify this situation, we have confirmed that the ascites derived from the ML30 hybridoma bound to the surface of human myeloid leukemia cell lines and myeloid blast cells purified from freshly diagnosed leukemic patients, but that the in vitro-derived ML30 antibody did not. In addition, we have isolated Fab fragments from the ascites derived from the ML30 hybridoma and demonstrated that these fragments bound to the surface of human myeloid leukemia cells after their treatment with the glutamine analog 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) for various times up to four days. Evidence has been presented in the literature that the ML30 monoclonal antibody recognizes a molecule corresponding to the human hsp60 homologue of the mycobacterial hsp65; therefore our results from the binding of Fab fragment preparations from ascites imply that when human myeloid leukemic cells are treated with DON, they express a human hsp60 homologue on their surface."
