https://openalex.org/W2019079031,"Communication between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrion is important for bioenergetics and cellular survival. The ER supplies Ca(2+) directly to mitochondria via inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) at close contacts between the two organelles referred to as mitochondrion-associated ER membrane (MAM). We found here that the ER protein sigma-1 receptor (Sig-1R), which is implicated in neuroprotection, carcinogenesis, and neuroplasticity, is a Ca(2+)-sensitive and ligand-operated receptor chaperone at MAM. Normally, Sig-1Rs form a complex at MAM with another chaperone, BiP. Upon ER Ca(2+) depletion or via ligand stimulation, Sig-1Rs dissociate from BiP, leading to a prolonged Ca(2+) signaling into mitochondria via IP3Rs. Sig-1Rs can translocate under chronic ER stress. Increasing Sig-1Rs in cells counteracts ER stress response, whereas decreasing them enhances apoptosis. These results reveal that the orchestrated ER chaperone machinery at MAM, by sensing ER Ca(2+) concentrations, regulates ER-mitochondrial interorganellar Ca(2+) signaling and cell survival."

Elucidating these programs that underlie development is essential to understanding the acquisition of cell and tissue identity. We present microarray expression profiles of a high-resolution set of developmental time points within a single Arabidopsis root and a comprehensive map of nearly all root cell types. These cell type–specific transcriptional signatures often predict previously unknown cellular functions. A computational pipeline identified dominant expression patterns that demonstrate transcriptional similarity between disparate cell types. Dominant expression patterns along the root's longitudinal axis do not strictly correlate with previously defined developmental zones, and in many cases, we observed expression fluctuation along this axis. Both robust co-regulation of gene expression and potential phasing of gene expression were identified between individual roots. Methods that combine these profiles demonstrate transcriptionally rich and complex programs that define Arabidopsis root development in both space and time."

We explored the therapeutic potential and mechanisms of αPlGF, an antibody against placental growth factor (PlGF), a VEGF homolog, which regulates the angiogenic switch in disease, but not in health. αPlGF inhibited growth and metastasis of various tumors, including those resistant to VEGF(R) inhibitors (VEGFRIs), and enhanced the efficacy of chemotherapy and VEGFRIs. αPlGF inhibited angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, and tumor cell motility. Distinct from VEGFRIs, αPlGF prevented infiltration of angiogenic macrophages and severe tumor hypoxia, and thus, did not switch on the angiogenic rescue program responsible for resistance to VEGFRIs. Moreover, it did not cause or enhance VEGFRI-related side effects. The efficacy and safety of αPlGF, its pleiotropic and complementary mechanism to VEGFRIs, and the negligible induction of an angiogenic rescue program suggest that αPlGF may constitute a novel approach for cancer treatment.

Antiangiogenic agents prolong the survival of cancer patients, however, without cure and at the expense of side effects (Hurwitz et al., 2004Hurwitz H. Fehrenbacher L. Novotny W. Cartwright T.

The role of VEGF and VEGFR-2 in tumor growth is well established, but other angiogenic factors switch on during cancer progression and induce resistance to VEGFRI monotherapy. By reducing tumor angiogenesis and increasing hypoxia, VEGFRIs rescue angiogenesis via other angiogenic factors. Combination therapy of antiangiogenic agents with complementary mechanisms could reduce resistance but might increase toxicity. PlGF is a pleiotropic cytokine that stimulates endothelial cell (EC) growth, migration, and survival; chemoattracts angiocompetent macrophages and bone marrow progenitors; and determines the metastatic niche. Unlike VEGF, PlGF selectively binds VEGFR-1 and its coreceptors neuropilin-1 and -2. Besides indirect effects (Park et al., 1994Park J.E. Chen H.H. Winer J. Houck K.A. Ferrara N.

However, genetic studies show that PlGF is redundant for vascular development and maintenance, but contributes to the angiogenic switch in disease (Carmeliet et al., 2001Carmeliet P. Moons L.

Cancer. 2003; 105: 158-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), suggesting a key role of PlGF in the angiogenic rescue. Here, we generated a neutralizing αPlGF and evaluated its therapeutic potential and mechanism of action in the inhibition of solid tumor growth. We developed a neutralizing murine anti-PlGF monoclonal antibody (clone 5D11D4; referred to as αPlGF) that specifically recognizes mouse PlGF-2 (all mouse proteins denoted without prefix; human proteins are preceded with “h”) with a high affinity (KD = 7.0 × 10−10 M). αPlGF inhibited the binding of PlGF to VEGFR-1 (IC50: 27 pM) and neuropilin-1, tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-1 in response to PlGF, and the response of endothelial and tumor cells to PlGF, without, however, inhibiting the binding or activity of VEGF or other related factors (Figures 1A–1D; Figures S1A–S1F in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). PlGF was undetectable in most healthy tissues but induced by hypoxia, abundant in all tumors analyzed and expressed by both tumor and stromal cells (Figures S1G and S1H; data not shown). When injecting B16 melanoma cells subcutaneously or pancreatic Panc02 tumor cells orthotopically, αPlGF dose-dependently inhibited tumor growth (Figures 2A–2D) and reduced the incidence of local tumor invasion, bile duct stenosis and hemorrhagic ascites (n = 65–71; Table S1; for pharmacokinetics and rationale of dosing, see Note S1). αPlGF dose-dependently inhibited metastasis of Panc02 tumors to regional and distant lymph nodes, independent of primary tumor size (Figures 2E–2G; Note S2). Metastasis to lymph nodes occurred in >78% of control mice, while only in 29% of αPlGF-treated mice (n = 18; p < 0.05; Table S1). Overall, αPlGF inhibited the growth and/or metastasis of 12 different tumor models tested, mostly by 55% to 66% (Figures 2H and 2I; Table S2), including human xenograft tumors (data not shown). αPlGF also suppressed the growth of established B16 tumors (by 35%) and the lodging of intravenously injected B16 tumor cells (by 50%; data not shown). To evaluate how efficiently αPlGF inhibited tumor growth as compared to established VEGFRIs, we used an anti-VEGFR-2 antibody (αVEGFR-2). Compared to αVEGFR-2, αPlGF comparably inhibited the growth of B16 tumors (Figure 2J) or was less effective in inhibiting growth of Panc02 tumors, a VEGFRI-sensitive model (by 62 ± 3% versus 82 ± 2%; n = 45; p < 0.05). Interestingly, however, αPlGF was more effective in suppressing growth of CT26 tumors, a model relatively resistant to VEGFRIs (by 56 ± 3% versus 31 ± 4%; n = 90; p < 0.05; see also Figure 3D). Similar results were obtained when using other VEGFRIs (see below). Thus, αPlGF inhibited the growth of VEGFRI-sensitive but also of VEGFRI-resistant tumors. Exposure of Panc02 and B16 tumor cells to the cytostatic agents gemcitabine and cyclophosphamide dose-dependently increased PlGF expression (Figure 3A; Figure S2A), providing a rationale to test whether αPlGF would enhance chemotherapy. Compared to monotherapy, combination therapy with αPlGF and gemcitabine inhibited Panc02 tumor growth more (Figure 3B). In the B16 model, αPlGF plus cyclophosphamide near completely inhibited tumor growth as compared to only the partial inhibition of tumor growth by either monotherapy alone (Figure S2B). Thus, αPlGF enhanced the tumor growth inhibitory effect of cytostatic agents. VEGFR blockade increases plasma PlGF levels in cancer patients (Motzer et al., 2006Motzer R.J.

Clin. Oncol. 2005; 23: 8136-8139Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Plasma PlGF levels were undetectable in healthy mice, but elevated to ∼100 pg/ml in tumor-bearing mice (Figure 3C). Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with αVEGFR-2 elevated PlGF levels in the plasma (Figure 3C) and tumors (Note S3A). Plasma VEGF levels were also increased when tumor-bearing mice were treated with αVEGFR-2 (Figure S2C), but not by αPlGF (data not shown). ELISA confirmed that tumoral VEGF levels were upregulated in tumors by αVEGFR-2, but not by αPlGF (Note S3B). The finding that PlGF levels were upregulated by αVEGFR-2 in tumor-bearing mice prompted us to examine whether αPlGF enhanced the antitumor effect of αVEGFR-2, using the colon CT26 tumor model, as it is relatively resistant to αVEGFR-2 (see above). Compared to the partial inhibition of tumor growth by monotherapy with αVEGFR-2 or αPlGF, their combination inhibited tumor growth more completely (Figure 3D), indicating that αPlGF enhanced the antitumor activity of αVEGFR-2. We also examined whether αPlGF might substitute for αVEGFR-2. A maximal dose of αPlGF and αVEGFR-2 reduced tumor growth in Panc02 tumors by ∼56% and ∼83%, respectively (Figure 3E). A low dose of αVEGFR-2 (from here on defined as 5 mg/kg; three times per week) inhibited tumor growth by ∼30%, but when combined with αPlGF, tumor growth was reduced by ∼83%, i.e., to the same extent as monotherapy with a high dose of αVEGFR-2 (Figure 3E). Similar results were obtained when analyzing lymphatic metastasis of Panc02 tumor cells, whereby substitution of most of αVEGFR-2 by αPlGF yielded even more complete suppression than αVEGFR-2 monotherapy alone (Figure 3F). Thus, substitution of αVEGFR-2 with αPlGF resulted in a comparable or even greater antitumor/metastasis effect. αPlGF reduced tumor angiogenesis by ∼50% in all tumors analyzed, i.e., comparably or slightly less than αVEGFR-2 (Figure 4A; Figures S3A–S3F; Table S3). Double staining for CD31 and caspase-3 revealed that αPlGF induced EC apoptosis, indicating that αPlGF induced pruning of preexisting tumor vessels (Figures 4B–4D). In Panc02 tumors, a combination of αPlGF with a low dose αVEGFR-2 reduced tumor angiogenesis to the same extent as a high dose of αVEGFR-2 (Figure 4A). Also, in CT26 tumors, the combination of αPlGF plus αVEGFR-2 yielded the greatest inhibition of tumor angiogenesis (Figure S3G). Thus, αPlGF reduces tumor growth, at least in part, by inhibiting tumor angiogenesis. Similar to αVEGFR-2, αPlGF primarily reduced EC numbers, without affecting SMC counts, suggesting possible improvement of tumor vessel maturation (Figures 4E–4H). VEGFR-1+ macrophages promote tumor growth and angiogenesis. αPlGF reduced F4/80+ macrophage infiltration, maximally by 74%, in both VEGFRI-sensitive (Panc02; Figure 4I) and VEGFRI-resistant (CT26; Figures S4A, S4B, and S4E) tumors (Table S3). It also normalized circulating monocyte counts in these tumor models (Figure 4J; Table S3). In contrast, αVEGFR-2 failed to inhibit the macrophage infiltration and even slightly increased circulating monocyte counts (Figures 4I and 4J; Figures S4C and S4E). Interestingly, the combination of αPlGF plus αVEGFR-2 inhibited macrophage infiltration and normalized tumor-induced monocytosis (Figures 4I and 4J; Figures S4D and S4E), indicating that αPlGF predominated over αVEGFR-2. Thus, αPlGF and αVEGFR-2 substantially differ in their mechanism of regulating tumor inflammation. Similar findings were obtained when using a VEGF inhibitor (see below). CT26 tumors produced comparable amounts of VEGF and PlGF (data not shown), yet αVEGFR-2 inhibited their growth much less than αPlGF (see above). Since both antibodies comparably inhibited angiogenesis, the resistance of CT26 tumors to αVEGFR-2 could not be explained by its antiangiogenic activity alone. As αPlGF, but not αVEGFR-2, inhibited macrophage infiltration, we assessed whether the tumor responsiveness to αVEGFR-2 was dependent on tumor inflammation. We therefore used clodronate liposomes (referred to as clodrolip) to deplete macrophages (Zeisberger et al., 2006Zeisberger S.M. Odermatt B. Marty C. Zehnder-Fjallman A.H. Ballmer-Hofer K. Schwendener R.A. Clodronate-liposome-mediated depletion of tumour-associated macrophages: A new and highly effective antiangiogenic therapy approach.Br. J. Cancer. 2006; 95: 272-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Clodrolip slowed down tumor growth in control mice but did not enhance the effect of αPlGF (Figure 5A). αPlGF alone was equipotent in inhibiting intratumoral macrophage infiltration, and clodrolip only slightly amplified the anti-inflammatory effect of αPlGF (Figure 5B). Tumor angiogenesis was reduced by clodrolip, indicating that macrophages were proangiogenic (Figure 5C). However, clodrolip did not further amplify the antiangiogenic effect of αPlGF, suggesting that αPlGF alone already efficiently depleted growing tumors from proangiogenic macrophages (Figure 5C). The finding that αPlGF inhibited tumor growth and angiogenesis more than clodrolip, while comparably inhibiting intratumoral macrophage infiltration, suggests that αPlGF inhibits tumor growth not only via an anti-inflammatory activity, but also via its antiangiogenic activity. Similar results were observed in orthotopic Panc02 tumors (Figures S4F–S4H). In contrast, the combination of αVEGFR-2 and clodrolip was more effective in inhibiting tumor growth, indicating that depletion of mononuclear cells by clodrolip sensitized CT26 tumors to the inhibitory effect of αVEGFR-2 (Figure 5D). Since αVEGFR-2 inhibited tumor angiogenesis without affecting tumor macrophage infiltration and clodrolip amplified the antiangiogenic activity of αVEGFR-2 (Figures 5E and 5F), the infiltration of proangiogenic macrophages contributed to the resistance of CT26 tumors to αVEGFR-2. Thus, αPlGF and αVEGFR-2 act via distinct mechanisms: by blocking both tumor angiogenesis and inflammation, αPlGF inhibits growth of a VEGFRI-resistant tumor; in contrast, the antiangiogenic activity of αVEGFR-2 is unable to suppress growth of this VEGFRI-resistant tumor, since it fails to inhibit infiltration of proangiogenic macrophages. To explain how αPlGF inhibited lymphatic metastasis of orthotopic Panc02 tumors, we analyzed lymphangiogenesis. αPlGF reduced LYVE-1+ peritumoral lymphatic vessel density and area by 75% and 87%, respectively (Figures 5G–5I; Figure S3H). Consistent with previous findings that VEGF stimulates lymphangiogenesis, αVEGFR-2 also inhibited lymphangiogenesis in Panc02 tumors (Figure 5I). Notably, combination of a low dose of αVEGFR-2 plus αPlGF resulted in a significantly greater inhibition of lymphangiogenesis than single treatments (Figure 5I). Thus, both αPlGF and αVEGFR-2 suppressed peritumoral lymphangiogenesis and amplified each other's antilymphangiogenic activity. Since lymphatic endothelial cells do not express VEGFR-1, we studied if αPlGF inhibited lymphangiogenesis indirectly. Indeed, αPlGF decreased Vegf-C levels, lymphangiogenesis, and lymph node metastasis comparably as clodrolip, suggesting that αPlGF inhibited the recruitment of prolymphangiogenic macrophages (Figures 5J–5L). Resistance to antiangiogenic agents is, at least in part, determined by the induction of a compensatory angiogenic program. We therefore analyzed the tumor expression of several angiogenic genes. Treatment of VEGFRI-sensitive and -resistant tumor-bearing mice with αVEGFR-2, but not αPlGF, upregulated proangiogenic genes such as Sdf-1, Fgf-1, Fgf-2, Vegf, Plgf, Mmp9, and Cxcl1 (Figure 6A). This upregulation was specific, as other genes involved in angiogenesis, such as Csf, Ccl-2, Egf, and Vegfr-3, were not upregulated (data not shown). Tumor hypoxia, resulting from the antiangiogenic treatment, may underlie the induction of such an angiogenic rescue program. We therefore assessed tumor hypoxia by staining for the hypoxia-marker pimonidazole (PIMO; Figures 6B–6D). In orthotopic Panc02 tumors, αVEGFR-2 (but not αPlGF) significantly increased the PIMO+ fraction of the tumor (Figure 6E). Further, αVEGFR-2 reduced the vessel area more than αPlGF (lumen/tumor area: 4.6 ± 0.4% in controls versus 3.3 ± 0.4% after αPlGF and 1.2 ± 0.2% after αVEGFR-2; n = 5; p = 0.04 versus αPlGF; p < 0.0001 versus αVEGFR-2). In addition, αVEGR-2, but not αPlGF, reduced in vivo tumor perfusion (tumor/kidney perfusion: 48 ± 10% in controls versus 17 ± 3% after αVEGFR-2, n = 14; p < 0.01; and 45 ± 9% after αPlGF, n = 14; p = NS). Similarly, in CT26 tumors, αVEGFR-2 caused more tumor cell hypoxia than αPlGF, resulting in larger necrotic tumor areas (Figures S4I and S4J). Thus, compared to αVEGFR-2, αPlGF caused less severe intratumoral hypoxia, which may explain the minimal rescue angiogenic program. To assess whether αPlGF mechanistically also differs from a specific VEGF inhibitor, we used a soluble form of VEGFR-2 (sFlk1) that “traps” VEGF selectively (i.e., thus, not PlGF or VEGF-B). Upon hydroporation, circulating sFlk1 was elevated during the entire experiment to levels (2,900 ± 790 ng/ml), previously reported to inhibit tumor growth (Davidoff et al., 2002Davidoff A.M. Nathwani A.C. Spurbeck W.W. Ng C.Y. Zhou J. Vanin E.F. rAAV-mediated long-term liver-generated expression of an angiogenesis inhibitor can restrict renal tumor growth in mice.Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3077-3083PubMed Google Scholar). sFlk1 inhibited orthotopic Panc02 tumor growth, angiogenesis, and lymph node metastasis (Figures 6F and 6G; Table S4) with plasma sFlk1 levels correlating with tumor growth inhibition (data not shown). The combination of αPlGF with sFlk1 was more efficient in inhibiting tumor growth and lymphatic metastasis than each treatment alone (Figures 6F and 6G). When using VEGFRI-resistant CT26 tumors, sFlk1 inhibited tumor growth only insignificantly by 20% (Figure 6H) without any correlation between sFlk1 levels and tumor inhibition, confirming that this tumor is resistant to VEGFRI therapy. Similar to αVEGFR-2, sFlk1 inhibited tumor angiogenesis but failed to inhibit intratumoral macrophage recruitment (Table S4), while clodrolip rendered this tumor again sensitive to sFlk1 (Figure 6I). Thus, even despite its antiangiogenic activity, sFlk1, like αVEGFR-2, is unable to inhibit macrophage recruitment and, hence, CT26 tumor growth. αPlGF, by contrast, differs from these VEGFRIs by inhibiting angiogenesis and macrophage infiltration and, thereby, growth of this VEGFRI-resistant tumor. Unlike αPlGF, sFlk1 also switched on an angiogenic rescue program, including Vegf, Plgf, and Fgf-2 (data not shown). Treatment with VEGFRIs causes thrombosis, hypertension, microvascular pruning in healthy organs, interruption of pregnancy, and other side effects (Hurwitz et al., 2004Hurwitz H. Fehrenbacher L.

However, treatment of healthy mice with αPlGF did not affect body weight, did not cause any obvious organ pathology upon inspection and histological analysis, did not alter the clinical chemistry or hematological blood profile, and did not increase proteinuria (data not shown). When analyzing the morphology of quiescent vessels in different healthy organs, treatment with αVEGFR-2, but not αPlGF, for 3 weeks reduced the number of capillary branching points/mm2 in the trachea by 34 ± 2% (Figures 7A–7C) and capillary profiles/mm of follicle perimeter in the thyroid gland by 21 ± 1% (n = 14; p < 0.05; Table S5). Moreover, the combination of αPlGF and αVEGFR-2 did not aggravate the adverse effect of αVEGFR-2 on vessel pruning (Figure 7D). Thus, αPlGF enhanced the antitumor growth efficacy of αVEGFR-2 without, however, aggravating its toxicity. We also measured the circulating levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), a fibrinolytic inhibitor of clot lysis, released by stressed ECs and known risk factor of thrombosis. Treatment with αVEGFR-2, but not αPlGF, caused a 2.7-fold increase of PAI-1 levels (n = 5; p < 0.05; Figure 7E). Furthermore, after 3 weeks of treatment, the mean blood pressure was elevated in mice given αVEGFR-2 (73 ± 3.2 mmHg after IgG1 versus 95 ± 3.9 mmHg after αVEGFR-2; n = 9; p < 0.002), but not αPlGF (74 ± 5.3 mmHg after IgG1 versus 74 ± 3.9 mmHg after αPlGF; n = 9; p = NS). The relative teratogenicity of αPlGF and αVEGFR-2 was analyzed in pregnant mice from the day of plug-check throughout pregnancy. Mice treated with αVEGFR-2 failed to gain weight beyond day 6, suggesting that embryonic development was arrested (Figure 7F). At day 8 of pregnancy, their uteri contained dead, partially resorbed early-stage embryos and a pale placenta, indicating that αVEGFR-2 inhibited"
https://openalex.org/W2063838707,"Hosts can in principle employ two different strategies to defend themselves against parasites: resistance and tolerance. Animals typically exhibit considerable genetic variation for resistance (the ability to limit parasite burden). However, little is known about whether animals can evolve tolerance (the ability to limit the damage caused by a given parasite burden). Using rodent malaria in laboratory mice as a model system and the statistical framework developed by plant-pathogen biologists, we demonstrated genetic variation for tolerance, as measured by the extent to which anemia and weight loss increased with increasing parasite burden. Moreover, resistance and tolerance were negatively genetically correlated. These results mean that animals, like plants, can evolve two conceptually different types of defense, a finding that has important implications for the understanding of the epidemiology and evolution of infectious diseases."

Conjugation of small ubiquitin-related modifier protein (SUMO) to a large number of substrates has been suggested to regulate numerous cellular processes from yeast to mammal (Hay, 2005Hay R.T. SUMO: a history of modification.Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar, Yeh et al., 2000Yeh E.T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Ubiquitin-like proteins: new wines in new bottles.Gene. 2000; 248: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Most SUMO targets are in the nucleus; they include transcription factors, transcriptional coregulators, and chromosome-remodeling regulators (Gill, 2004Gill G. SUMO and ubiquitin in the nucleus: different functions, similar mechanisms?.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2046-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). SUMOylation of these proteins can alter their cellular localization and biological activity. SUMO conjugation is a dynamic process, in that it can be readily reversed by a family of Sentrin/SUMO-specific proteases (SENPs) (Hay, 2005Hay R.T. SUMO: a history of modification.Mol.

Ubiquitin-like proteins: new wines in new bottles.Gene. 2000; 248: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Six SENPs have been identified in human, each with different cellular location and substrate specificity (Yeh et al., 2000Yeh E.T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Ubiquitin-like proteins: new wines in new bottles.Gene. 2000; 248: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). They can be divided into three subfamilies on the basis of their sequence homology, cellular location, and substrate specificity. The first subfamily consists of SENP1 and SENP2, which have broad substrate specificity. The second subfamily consists of SENP3 and SENP5, both of which are nucleolar proteins with preferences for SUMO-2/3 (Di Bacco et al., 2006Di Bacco A. Ouyang J. Lee H.Y. Catic A. Ploegh H. Gill G.

The third subfamily consists of SENP6 and SENP7, which have an extra loop in their catalytic domains. Although SENPs are known to reverse SUMOylation in many different systems, their physiological role has not been precisely defined. SENP1, a nuclear SUMO protease, has been shown to regulate androgen receptor transactivation by targeting histone deacetylase 1 and to induce c-Jun activity through deSUMOylation of p300 (Cheng et al., 2004Cheng J. Wang D. Wang Z. Yeh E.T. SENP1 enhances androgen receptor-dependent transcription through desumoylation of histone deacetylase 1.Mol. Cell.

Yamaguchi et al. studied mice derived from an ES cell line with a retroviral vector that had been randomly inserted into the enhancer region on the SENP1 gene. This random insertion reduced expression of the SENP1 transcript, causing the mice to die between E12.5 and E14.5 (Yamaguchi et al., 2005Yamaguchi T. Sharma P. Athanasiou M. Kumar A. Yamada S. Kuehn M.R. Mutation of SENP1/SuPr-2 reveals an essential role for desumoylation in mouse development.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5171-5182Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Although no specific histological abnormalities were found in the E13.5 embryos, there was a hint of an abnormality in the development of blood vessels in the placenta. Thus, it remains unclear how SENP1 contributes to normal development. Therefore, we generated SENP1 knockout mice to delineate the contribution of SENP1 in development. Inactivation of the SENP1 gene causes severe fetal anemia in midgestation as a result of deficient Epo production. Epo is essential for growth and survival of erythroid progenitors during differentiation into red cells (Wu et al., 1995Wu H. Liu X. Jaenisch R. Lodish H.F. Generation of committed erythroid BFU-E and CFU-E progenitors does not require erythropoietin or the erythropoietin receptor.Cell. 1995; 83: 59-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). We found that SENP1 controls Epo production by regulating the stability of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α). Hypoxia induces HIF1α SUMOylation, which promotes HIF1α degradation through a VHL- and proteasome-dependent mechanism. SENP1 deconjugates SUMOylated HIF1α and allows HIF1α to escape degradation during hypoxia. These results reveal an important physiological role of SENP1 in the hypoxic response through regulation of HIF1α stability and that SUMOylation can also target a protein for ubiquitination and degradation. To generate SENP1 knockout mice, a gene-trapped vector was inserted into the mouse SENP1 open reading frame at codon 310 (Figure S1A). Specifically, the inserted β-geo (β-galactosidase/neomycin-resistance fusion protein) was fused into the N terminus of SENP1 at codon 310 to generate SENP1 (1-309)-β-geo fusion protein, which lacks the C-terminal catalytic domain of SENP1 (Figure S1A). This disruption was confirmed by the absence of transcripts that encode the catalytic domain of SENP1 in SENP1−/− embryos (Figure S1B). The overall SUMOylation pattern in lysates of embryos revealed an increase in high-molecular-weight SUMO-1 and SUMO-2/3 conjugates in SENP1−/− embryos in comparison with wild-type or SENP1+/− embryos (Figure S1C). In addition, processing of the C terminus of SUMO-1 but not SUMO-2/3 appeared to be decreased in SENP1−/− embryos (Figure S1C). These results indicate that disruption of the SENP1 locus reduced deSUMOylation in SENP1−/− embryos. Heterozygous mice carrying the inactivated SENP1 gene appeared normal and fertile. However, no live SENP1−/− mice were found among offsprings of SENP1+/− intercrosses, indicating that the SENP1−/− mutation leads to embryonic lethality. Examination of SENP1−/− embryos at different stages of development revealed that the majority died between days 13 and 15 of gestation (Figure 1A). The SENP1−/− embryos appeared paler and smaller than their wild-type or SENP1+/− littermates (Figure 1B). The most dramatic morphological abnormality of these SENP1−/− embryos was severe fetal anemia. In particular, SENP1−/− embryos had more than 75% fewer erythrocytes than their wild-type or SENP1+/− littermates at E15.5 (Figure 1C). During normal murine development, erythropoiesis is initiated in the yolk sac at around E8 (primitive erythropoiesis), and then it is initiated in the aorta-gonadmesonephros (AGM) region. At midgestation, fetal liver becomes the major hematopoietic organ with hematopoietic activity starting around E11.0 to E12.5 until 1 week postnatal (definitive erythropoiesis) (Godin and Cumano, 2002Godin I. Cumano A. The hare and the tortoise: an embryonic haematopoietic race.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 593-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Because anemia was observed after E13.5 in SENP1−/− embryos, we reasoned that these embryos likely had a defect in definitive erythropoiesis. Indeed, the number of nucleated cells in the fetal livers of SENP1−/− embryos was markedly decreased compared to their wild-type littermates (Figure 1D). Histological examination of fetal liver sections also revealed a marked decrease in the number of erythropoietic foci in SENP1−/− embryos compared with their wild-type littermates (Figure 1E). We next examined hematopoiesis in the fetal livers of both wild-type and SENP1−/− embryos at E13.5 by flow cytometry using markers, including CD34, CD44, c-kit, and Ter-119, characteristic of different types of hematopoietic cells and developmental stages (Kondo et al., 2003Kondo M.

Jak2 deficiency defines an essential developmental checkpoint in definitive hematopoiesis.Cell. 1998; 93: 397-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). There was no significant difference between SENP1−/− embryos and wild-type littermates, except that the population of Ter-119+, which denotes committed erythropoietic precursors, was markedly reduced in SENP1−/− fetal livers (Figure S2A). These data suggest that erythropoiesis was abnormal in SENP1−/− embryos as a result of a defect in erythroid differentiation. To determine at which stage of erythroid differentiation SENP1 plays a crucial role, we compared the abilities of cells derived from wild-type and SENP1−/− E13.5 fetal livers to form erythroid colony-forming units (CFU-e) and more immature erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-e) (Wu et al., 1995Wu H. Liu X. Jaenisch R. Lodish H.F. Generation of committed erythroid BFU-E and CFU-E progenitors does not require erythropoietin or the erythropoietin receptor.Cell. 1995; 83: 59-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Although fetal livers from SENP1−/− embryos contained erythroid progenitors, the relative number of CFU-e arising from SENP1−/− fetal liver was over 40% smaller than that from wild-type fetal liver (Figure 2A). However, there was no significant difference in the numbers of the BFU-e between SENP1−/− and wild-type fetal livers (Figure 2A). Additionally, we observed no significant difference in the number of colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) and pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells (CFU-GEMM) between SENP1−/− and wild-type fetal livers (Figure S2B). These results indicate that a developmental defect in CFU-e is a prominent feature in the SENP1−/− embryo. The reduced ratio of CFU-e to BFU-e progenitors and the decrease in the number of Ter-119+ erythroid cell suggested a reduction in the net growth of SENP1−/− erythroid progenitors resulting from either decreased cell proliferation or increased apoptosis. No differences were observed in the proliferation of fetal liver cells between SENP1−/− embryos and their wild-type littermates, as shown by Ki-67 staining (upper panel, Figure S2C). However, TUNEL staining showed that the number of TUNEL-positive cells was much greater in the liver sections from SENP1−/− embryos than in those of their wild-type littermates (lower panel, Figure S2C). To validate further, we stained fetal liver cells with the anti-Ter-119 antibody and then analyzed cells by flow cytometry. This showed that the percentage of Ter-119-positive cells was decreased in SENP−/− embryos, from 81% in E13.5 wild-type fetal livers to 37% in their SENP1−/− littermates (data not shown). Among the Ter-119-positive cells, about 34.5% of SENP1−/− cells were stained by TUNEL; in contrast, few TUNEL-positive cells (1.9%) were observed from the wild-type liver (Figure 2B). These results suggested that the erythroid cells in fetal liver were more apoptotic in SENP1−/− embryos than in their wild-type counterparts, which accounts for the decrease in CFU-e progenitors, smaller fetal liver size, and anemia in SENP1−/− embryos. The hematopoietic defect in SENP1−/− embryos described above was similar to that observed in Epo−/− embryos or in embryos with mutation of the genes critical to the Epo signaling pathway (Neubauer et al., 1998Neubauer H.

Generation of committed erythroid BFU-E and CFU-E progenitors does not require erythropoietin or the erythropoietin receptor.Cell. 1995; 83: 59-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Since fetal liver erythroid progenitors depend on Epo for growth and survival during terminal differentiation into red blood cells (Wu et al., 1995Wu H. Liu X. Jaenisch R. Lodish H.F. Generation of committed erythroid BFU-E and CFU-E progenitors does not require erythropoietin or the erythropoietin receptor.Cell. 1995; 83: 59-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar), we reasoned that the increased apoptosis of erythroid cells in SENP1−/− fetal liver could be due to either a defect in Epo production or blockage in the Epo signaling pathway. To assess these possibilities, we first examined the expression of genes involved in the Epo signaling pathway (specifically, EpoR, Jak2, and STAT5) and other growth factors associated with erythroid progenitors in fetal livers. A dramatic reduction in the level of Epo mRNA expression was shown in SENP1−/− fetal livers (Figure 2C). In contrast, the expression of EpoR, Jak2, STAT5, and growth factors c-kit and SCF was not significantly different between SENP1−/− and wild-type fetal livers (Figure 2C). The reduced Epo expression in E12.5 fetal liver cells of SENP1−/− embryos was further confirmed by immunohistochemistry (Figure 2D). These results demonstrated that Epo production was significantly reduced in SENP1−/− fetal livers. To determine whether apoptosis of cells in the fetal livers of SENP1−/− embryos was caused by a deficiency in Epo production, we examined the ability of Epo to prevent apoptosis of the erythroid progenitors from SENP1−/− fetal liver. As shown by rates of apoptosis in vitro, E13.5 wild-type fetal liver cells, which were grown in a medium lacking Epo, showed a reduction in cell number and increase in apoptosis similar to those observed in fetal liver cells of their SENP1−/− littermates. Addition of Epo to the culture medium prevented reduction in cell number and apoptosis in SENP1−/− fetal liver cells similar to their wild-type littermates (Figures 2E and 2F). These results demonstrated that the increased apoptosis of erythroid progenitors was due to deficiency in Epo production in SENP1−/− fetal liver. The Epo gene is expressed primarily in fetal liver and adult kidney and is regulated in response to oxygen availability (Ebert and Bunn, 1999Ebert B.L. Bunn H.F. Regulation of the erythropoietin gene.Blood. 1999; 94: 1864-1877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since SENP1 is expressed in mouse fetal liver at midgestation stage (Figure S3), we reasoned that SENP1 might directly regulate Epo expression in fetal liver. A hepatoma cell line, Hep 3B, was used to determine whether SENP1 regulated Epo production. Two SENP1-specific siRNAs were able to efficiently knock down SENP1 expression (Figure S4) and significantly reduced Epo expression in Hep 3B cells in response to treatment with hypoxia (Figure 3A), indicating that SENP1 played an important role in Epo production under the hypoxia condition. Since SENP1 regulates the transcription of numerous genes by targeting transcription factors or coregulators (Cheng et al., 2004Cheng J. Wang D. Wang Z. Yeh E.T. SENP1 enhances androgen receptor-dependent transcription through desumoylation of histone deacetylase 1.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6021-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, Cheng et al., 2005Cheng J. Perkins N.D. Yeh E.T. Differential regulation of c-Jun-dependent transcription by SUMO-specific proteases.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14492-14498Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we next examined whether Epo transcription was also regulated by SENP1. In this study, the luciferase reporter gene driven by the Epo promoter plus enhancer (Epo-Luc) was transfected into Hep 3B cells with SENP1 or SENP1 catalytic inactive mutant (SENP1m), in which a conserved amino acid, cysteine 603, in the catalytic domain of SENP1 was substituted with alanine. In the presence of hypoxia, SENP1, but not the SENP1 mutant, significantly induced Epo reporter gene transcription (Figure 3B), suggesting that SENP1 regulated Epo transcription and the regulation required the deSUMOylation activity of SENP1. Interestingly, without hypoxia treatment, SENP1 had only marginal effect on Epo transcription. Since HIF1α is a major transcription factor for hypoxia-regulated Epo expression (Giaccia et al., 2004Giaccia A.J. Simon M.C. Johnson R. The biology of hypoxia: the role of oxygen sensing in development, normal function, and disease.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2183-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), we asked whether HIF1α was required for SENP1-regulated Epo transcription. Coexpression of SENP1 markedly enhanced HIF1α-dependent Epo transcription (Figure 3C). However, mutation of HIF1α-binding sites on the Epo enhancer (mEpo-Luc) completely abolished SENP1 activity (Figure 3C). Furthermore, silencing of endogenous SENP1 expression in Hep 3B cells using SENP1 siRNA (SENP1-si1 and SENP1-si2) also reduced Epo transcription in response to HIF1α by 80% (Figure 3D). These results strongly suggested that Epo expression was regulated by SENP1 through its regulation of HIF1α activity. It is well-known that regulation of HIF1α occurs mostly at the protein level. In SENP1−/− mice, HIF1α protein level was significantly decreased in a section of the SENP1−/− fetal liver compared with the SENP1+/+ littermate (Figure 4A). However, HIF1α mRNA levels in fetal livers of SENP1−/− or wild-type embryos were similar, suggesting that the decrease in HIF1α protein level resulted from protein degradation but not a reduction of HIF1α transcription in SENP1−/− embryos (Figure S5). HIF1α is degraded by a proteasome-dependent mechanism under normoxia (Huang et al., 1998Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F.

We hypothesized that regulation of HIF1α protein to hypoxia was defective in SENP1−/− cells. To test this possibility, we determined changes in HIF1α protein level in SENP1−/− and wild-type MEF cells when exposed to hypoxia. As shown in Figure 4B, hypoxia markedly increased the protein level of HIF1α in the wild-type MEF cells, but the increase was much less in the SENP1−/− MEF cells. Furthermore, the half-life of HIF1α protein was markedly reduced in the SENP1−/− MEF cells under the hypoxia condition in a pulse-chase experiment (Figure 4C). Normoxia-induced HIF1α degradation is dependent on its internal oxygen-depend-degradation (ODD) domain (Huang et al., 1998Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha is mediated by an O2-dependent degradation domain via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We used the HIF1α ODD domain (344-698) fused Gal4 (pG4-ODD-VP16), which was previously demonstrated to have normoxic- and VHL-dependent degradation and activity (Huang et al., 1998Huang L.E. Gu J.

Indeed, coexpression of SENP1 markedly enhanced hypoxia-induced ODD activity. However, hypoxia-induced activity of the ODD domain was completely abolished by SENP1-siRNA (Figure 4D). These results strongly indicated that SENP1 was essential for HIF1α stabilization under hypoxia condition. Consistent with the decrease in HIF1α expression during hypoxia, HIF1α activity was also significantly reduced in SENP1−/− MEF cells as measured by the response of the HRE-luciferase reporter gene to hypoxia in SENP1−/− and wild-type MEF cells (Figure 4E). As HIF1α is a major transcription factor in the regulation of a large number of hypoxia-inducible genes, we also showed that hypoxia-induced transcription of VEGF and Glut-1 genes was dramatically decreased in SENP1−/− MEF cells (Figure 4F). This defect was similar to the response of HIF1α−/− ES upon hypoxia exposure (Iyer et al., 1998Iyer N.V. Kotch L.E. Agani F. Leung S.W. Laughner E. Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. Gearhart J.D. Lawler A.M.

Johnson R.S. HIF-1 alpha is required for solid tumor formation and embryonic vascularization.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3005-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar). We further confirmed that this defect in SENP1−/− MEF cells was mediated by HIF1α, as transfected HIF1αSM (SUMOylation mutant) could restore hypoxia-induced expression of the VEGF gene in the transfected cells (Figure 4G). These results indicated that SENP1 played a critical role in regulating the stability and activity of HIF1α protein during hypoxia. Since SENP1 could deSUMOylate HIF1α, SENP1 might be directly responsible for the decrease in HIF1α activity and stability in the SENP1−/− embryo (Figures 5A and S6). The effect of deSUMOylation on HIF1α activity was directly confirmed by using HIF1α SUMOylated site mutants: K391R, K477R, and K391/477R (SM) (Bae et al., 2004Bae S.H. Jeong J.W. Park J.A. Kim S.H. Bae M.K. Choi S.J. Kim K.W. Sumoylation increases HIF-1alpha stability and its transcriptional activity.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 324: 394-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 5B, mutation of the two SUMOylation sites of HIF1α (SM) significantly increased the transcriptional activity of HIF1α and also reduced the ability of SENP1 to enhance HIF1α-dependent Epo transcription. Furthermore, hypoxia-induced accumulation of SUMOylated HIF1α only occurred in SENP1−/− MEF cells but not in wild-type cells (Figure 5C). Interestingly, this accumulation did not appear in SENP2−/− MEF cells (Figure S7), suggesting that SENP1 specifically targeted HIF1α for deSUMOylation (Figure 5C). The simultaneous accumulation of SUMOylated HIF1α and the decrease in HIF1α stability in SENP1−/− cells during hypoxia prompted us to study whether SUMOylation might lead to HIF1α degradation. Indeed, SUMOylated bands of HIF1α resulted from coexpression of HIF1α and HA-SUMO-1 and were difficult to detect in the absence of a proteasome inhibitor MG132 but readily detectable when both SENP1 siRNA and MG132 were used (Figure 5D). These results were further confirmed by examining endogenous HIF1α in SENP1−/− and wild-type MEF cells with exposure to both hypoxia and MG132. As expected, hypoxia-induced SUMOylated HIF1α was readily detected in SENP1−/− MEF but not in wild-type MEF cells. Furthermore, MG132 treatment markedly increased hypoxia-induced SUMOylated bands of HIF1α in SENP1−/− MEF cells, suggesting that the level of SUMOylated HIF1α was controlled by a proteasome-dependent mechanism (Figure 5E, upper panel). Meanwhile, HIF1α protein level was significantly increased in SENP1 wild-type MEF cells but not in the SENP1−/− MEF cells with exposure to hypoxia (Figure 5E, lower panel). Taken together, these results suggested that SUMOylated HIF1α was degraded in a proteasome-dependent manner during hypoxia in the absence of SENP1. The above results suggest that SUMO and SENP1 might regulate ubiquitination of HIF1α. As shown in Figure 6A, ubiquitination of HIF1α was significantly increased when SUMO-1 was overexpressed (lane 3 versus lane 2 in Figure 6A). In contrast, cotransfection of SENP1, but not SENP1 mutant, significantly decreased ubiquitination of HIF1α (lanes 4 and 5 versus 2 in Figure 6A). We asked whether VHL, a well-known E3 ligase for HIF1α ubiquitination (Ivan et al., 2001Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H. Kim W. Valiando J. Ohh M. Salic A. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Kaelin Jr., W.G.

Recent studies place altered mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) as an underlying genetic element of insulin resistance. However, the causative or compensatory nature of these OxPhos changes has yet to be proven. Here, we show that muscle- and liver-specific AIF ablation in mice initiates a pattern of OxPhos deficiency closely mimicking that of human insulin resistance, and contrary to current expectations, results in increased glucose tolerance, reduced fat mass, and increased insulin sensitivity. These results are maintained upon high-fat feeding and in both genetic mosaic and ubiquitous OxPhos-deficient mutants. Importantly, the effects of AIF on glucose metabolism are acutely inducible and reversible. These findings establish that tissue-specific as well as global OxPhos defects in mice can counteract the development of insulin resistance, diabetes, and obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2035989713,"The unicellular parasite Trypanosoma brucei rapidly removes host-derived immunoglobulin (Ig) from its cell surface, which is dominated by a single type of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored variant surface glycoprotein (VSG). We have determined the mechanism of antibody clearance and found that Ig-VSG immune complexes are passively sorted to the posterior cell pole, where they are endocytosed. The backward movement of immune complexes requires forward cellular motility but is independent of endocytosis and of actin function. We suggest that the hydrodynamic flow acting on swimming trypanosomes causes directional movement of Ig-VSG immune complexes in the plane of the plasma membrane, that is, immunoglobulins attached to VSG function as molecular sails. Protein sorting by hydrodynamic forces helps to protect trypanosomes against complement-mediated immune destruction in culture and possibly in infected mammals but likewise may be of functional significance at the surface of other cell types such as epithelial cells lining blood vessels."

Here we show that menin, a protein previously characterized as an endocrine tumor suppressor and transcriptional regulator, controls islet growth in pregnant mice. Pregnancy stimulated proliferation of maternal pancreatic islet beta-cells that was accompanied by reduced islet levels of menin and its targets. Transgenic expression of menin in maternal beta-cells prevented islet expansion and led to hyperglycemia and impaired glucose tolerance, hallmark features of gestational diabetes. Prolactin, a hormonal regulator of pregnancy, repressed islet menin levels and stimulated beta-cell proliferation. These results expand our understanding of mechanisms underlying diabetes pathogenesis and reveal potential targets for therapy in diabetes."

The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains many duplicated genes encoding ribosomal proteins. Prior studies have suggested that these duplicated proteins are functionally redundant and affect cellular processes in proportion to their expression. In contrast, through studies of ASH1 mRNA in yeast, we demonstrate paralog-specific requirements for the translation of localized mRNAs. Intriguingly, these paralog-specific effects are limited to a distinct subset of duplicated ribosomal proteins. Moreover, transcriptional and phenotypic profiling of cells lacking specific ribosomal proteins reveals differences between the functional roles of ribosomal protein paralogs that extend beyond effects on mRNA localization. Finally, we show that ribosomal protein paralogs exhibit differential requirements for assembly and localization. Together, our data indicate complex specialization of ribosomal proteins for specific cellular processes and support the existence of a ribosomal code."
https://openalex.org/W2166755632,"The recognition of specific DNA-binding sites by transcription factors is a critical yet poorly understood step in the control of gene expression. Members of the Hox family of transcription factors bind DNA by making nearly identical major groove contacts via the recognition helices of their homeodomains. In vivo specificity, however, often depends on extended and unstructured regions that link Hox homeodomains to a DNA-bound cofactor, Extradenticle (Exd). Using a combination of structure determination, computational analysis, and in vitro and in vivo assays, we show that Hox proteins recognize specific Hox-Exd binding sites via residues located in these extended regions that insert into the minor groove but only when presented with the correct DNA sequence. Our results suggest that these residues, which are conserved in a paralog-specific manner, confer specificity by recognizing a sequence-dependent DNA structure instead of directly reading a specific DNA sequence."
https://openalex.org/W2068258112,"Cell entry of Simian Virus 40 (SV40) involves caveolar/lipid raft-mediated endocytosis, vesicular transport to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), translocation into the cytosol, and import into the nucleus. We analyzed the effects of ER-associated processes and factors on infection and on isolated viruses and found that SV40 makes use of the thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases, ERp57 and PDI, as well as the retrotranslocation proteins Derlin-1 and Sel1L. ERp57 isomerizes specific interchain disulfides connecting the major capsid protein, VP1, to a crosslinked network of neighbors, thus uncoupling about 12 of 72 VP1 pentamers. Cryo-electron tomography indicated that loss of interchain disulfides coupled with calcium depletion induces selective dissociation of the 12 vertex pentamers, a step likely to mimic uncoating of the virus in the cytosol. Thus, the virus utilizes the protein folding machinery for initial uncoating before exploiting the ER-associated degradation machinery presumably to escape from the ER lumen into the cytosol."

Liver stages of the parasite containing thousands of merozoites grow inside hepatocytes for several days without triggering an inflammatory response. We show here that Plasmodium uses a PEXEL/VTS motif to introduce the circumsporozoite (CS) protein into the hepatocyte cytoplasm and a nuclear localization signal (NLS) to enter its nucleus. CS outcompetes NFkappaB nuclear import, thus downregulating the expression of many genes controlled by NFkappaB, including those involved in inflammation. CS also influences the expression of over one thousand host genes involved in diverse metabolic processes to create a favorable niche for the parasite growth. The presence of CS in the hepatocyte enhances parasite growth of the liver stages in vitro and in vivo. These findings have far reaching implications for drug and vaccine development against the liver stages of the malaria parasite."

We study timing variability during meiosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, initiated upon nutritional starvation. We use time-lapse fluorescence microscopy to measure the timing of meiotic events in single cells and find that the duration of meiosis is highly variable between cells. This variability is concentrated between the beginning of starvation and the onset of early meiosis genes. Cell-cycle variability and nutritional history have little effect on this timing variability. Rather, variation in the production rate of the meiotic master regulator Ime1 and its gradual increase over time govern this variability, and cell size effects are channeled through Ime1. These results tie phenotypic variability with expression dynamics of a transcriptional regulator and provide a general framework for the study of temporal developmental processes."

However, we find that in the presence of transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs), which are AMPA receptor auxiliary subunits, CNQX acts as a partial agonist. CNQX induced small depolarizing currents in neurons of the central nervous system, and reconstitution of this agonist activity required coexpression of TARPs. A crystal structure of CNQX bound to the TARP-less AMPA receptor ligand-binding domain showed that, although CNQX induces partial domain closure, this movement is not transduced into linker separation, suggesting that TARPs may increase agonist efficacy by strengthening the coupling between domain closure and channel opening. Our results demonstrate that the presence of an auxiliary subunit can determine whether a compound functions as an agonist or antagonist."

IQGAP1 is overexpressed in a number of human solid neoplasms, but its functional role in tumorigenesis has not been previously evaluated.

The amount of IQGAP1 in breast carcinoma is greater than that in normal tissue, with highly metastatic breast epithelial cells expressing the highest levels. Overexpression of IQGAP1 enhances proliferation of MCF-7 breast epithelial cells.

The IQGAP1 overexpression in colorectal carcinoma is most apparent at the invasive front and in advanced carcinomas with the highest invasive potential (20Nabeshima K. Shimao Y. Inoue T. Koono M. Cancer Lett. 2002; 176: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Similarly, immunohistochemical analyses of gastric carcinomas suggest that subcellular location of IQGAP1 varies depending on the degree of differentiation of the tumor. In poorly and well differentiated diffuse- and intestinal-type tumors, IQGAP1 is localized at the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm, respectively (24Takemoto H. Doki Y. Shiozaki H. Imamura H. Utsunomiya T. Miyata H. Yano M. Inoue M. Fujiwara Y. Monden M. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 91: 783-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The localization of IQGAP1 has recently been shown to have prognostic information. In ovarian carcinoma, overexpression and a diffuse expression pattern of IQGAP1 were shown to be independent predictors of highly aggressive tumors (22Dong P. Nabeshima K. Nishimura N. Kawakami T. Hachisuga T. Kawarabayashi T. Iwasaki H. Cancer Lett. 2006; 243: 120-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The relevance to tumor biology of the known cellular targets of IQGAP1, combined with accumulating clinical and experimental evidence, suggest a positive relationship between IQGAP1 expression and tumorigenesis. Notwithstanding these data, it is not known whether the changes in IQGAP1 observed in these studies contribute to the tumor pathogenesis nor whether the alterations in IQGAP1 are a cause or consequence of the neoplastic transformation. To investigate these issues, we chose to directly examine the role of IQGAP1 in tumorigenesis. Analysis was performed with cultured cells in vitro and with an in vivo tumor model system. Female immunocompromised mice (i.e. NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid/JC3H/HeJ) were injected subcutaneously with one of three MCF-7-derived cell lines, which express varying amounts of IQGAP1. Differences between groups in in vitro and in vivo proliferation and tumorigenic growth were monitored. Plasmids—Myc-tagged wild type human IQGAP1 in a pcDNA3 vector was used (25Hart M.J. Callow M.G.

Cell Culture and Transfection—The following human breast epithelial cell lines were used: T47D, ZR-75-1, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-361 (generously provided by Andrea Richardson, Brigham and Women's Hospital), MCF-7, Hs578T, and MDA-MB-435s (purchased from ATCC). The cells were cultured and transfected essentially as previously described (11Swart-Mataraza J.M. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol.

Briefly, the cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Where indicated, the cells were transiently transfected with 10 μg of pcDNA3 (empty vector), Myc-IQGAP1, Myc-IQGAP1ΔGRD, Myc-IQGAP1G75Q, or Myc-IQGAP1ΔMK24 using FuGENE 6. In addition, MCF-7 human breast epithelial cells were stably transfected with empty pcDNA3 vector (MCF/V) or pcDNA3-Myc-IQGAP1 (MCF/I); IQGAP1 protein expression is 3-fold higher in MCF/I relative to MCF/V cells (10Briggs M.W.

IQGAP1 protein expression in these cells (termed MCF-siIQ8 cells) is reduced by 80% (12Mataraza J.M. Briggs M.W. Li Z. Entwistle A. Ridley A.J. Sacks D.B. J. Biol.

Western Blotting—The cells were washed three times in serum-free medium and lysed in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100). Equal amounts of protein lysate were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane essentially as previously described (33Joyal J.L. Annan R.S. Ho Y.D. Huddleston M.E.

Immunoblots were probed with anti-IQGAP1 monoclonal antibody and anti-tubulin antibody (Sigma). The complexes were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and developed by ECL. Frozen human breast tissue was thawed and homogenized in buffer A containing 1 mm EGTA and protease inhibitors. Equal amounts of protein were resolved by Western blotting. Animals—Female NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid/JC3H/HeJ mice (6-8 weeks old) were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Upon arrival at the vivarium, the animals were immediately randomized to treatment groups (i.e. MCF/V, MCF/I, and MCF-siIQ8 cell lines). The experimental procedures began after a 1-week acclimatization period. Throughout the investigation, the animals had free access to food (standard mouse chow) and water and were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle. The mice were housed in cages fitted with a high efficiency particulate air filter lid; the cages were contained in a chamber receiving independent, filtered air. All of the manipulations on mice were performed in a laminar flow hood using sterile procedures. The cages, bedding, food, water, nestlets, and water bottles were autoclaved prior to contact with mice. The water was acidified or supplemented with antibiotics on a rotating 4-day schedule. The animals were treated in accordance with guidelines set out by the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Cell Proliferation Assays—Incorporation of [3H]thymidine and the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) dye method were used to assess cell proliferation. The cells were made quiescent by culturing them for 24 h in DMEM containing 0.5% (v/v) FBS. DNA synthesis was measured by labeling 2 × 105 cells with 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine for 18 h. The cells were washed with ice-cold 0.5% trichloroacetic acid and lysed with 0.25 m NaOH. Six hundred microliters of lysate was collected, and radioactivity assessed by liquid scintillation spectrometry. All of the assays were performed in quadruplicate. For the MTT assay, MCF/V and MCF/I cells were transfected with 1 μg of empty pcDNA vector, N17Cdc42, or N17Rac1. After 36 h, 5 × 103 viable cells were plated in 96-well, flat-bottom tissue culture plates. After incubating for 24, 48, and 72 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 20 μl of MTT labeling reagent was added, and the cells were incubated for another 4 h. Dimethyl sulfoxide (100 μl) was added to each well, and the samples were incubated overnight. The absorbances were determined at 550 nm using a Victor3 Multilabel Counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Soft Agar Colony Formation Assay—Colony growth assays were performed essentially as previously described (36Vadlamudi R.K. Adam L. Wang R.A. Mandal M. Nguyen D. Sahin A. Chernoff J. Hung M.C.

Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 277-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 5-ml agar solution (0.6% Difco agar in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS) was layered onto 15-mm tissue culture plates. The cells (1 × 104; MCF/V, MCF/I and MCF-siIQ8) were then suspended in soft agar (0.36% Bactoagar solution in DMEM) and layered onto prepared 0.6% Difco agar plates. After a 14-day incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2, colonies (>0.2 mm) were counted using a light microscope. All of the assays were performed in quadruplicate. In Vivo Assay for Primary Tumor Growth and Angiogenesis—The mice were anesthetized using an intraperitoneal injection of a hypnorm/midazolam mixture. Specifically, 1 part hypnorm (fentanyl citrate, 0.315 mg; fluanison, 10 mg/ml) and 1 part midazolam (5 mg/ml) were suspended in 2 parts of sterile water; the dose was 0.1 ml/10 g of body weight. Incision sites were cleaned using a three-step surgical preparation: isopropyl alcohol, tincture of iodine, and savlon. Hypromellose eye lubricant prevented ocular drying and damage during anesthesia. In the inguinal region, the mice received subcutaneous implants of 1 × 105 tumor cells (i.e. MCF/V, MCF/I, or MCF-siIQ8; 10 animals/group) suspended in Matrigel (Collaborative Research, Bedford, MA) (3.5 mg of Matrigel in 0.5 ml of DMEM), and on the contralateral side as controls, they received the equivalent amount of Matrigel alone. A small incision was made in the dorsal scapular region, and a slow release (60 day) 17β-estradiol pellet (Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, FL) was inserted subcutaneously. The incisions were then closed using a small drop of Vetbond surgical glue. During recovery from anesthesia, the mice were placed in a warm cage; they were monitored carefully and received subcutaneous injections of warmed saline (0.9%; 1 ml). As an indication of general health, the mice were observed and weighed regularly during the course of the experiment. Primary tumor growth was monitored at least once a week. Sixty days after tumor implantation, the mice were sacrificed using an overdose of pentobarbital. Final tumor volumes were determined by measuring the maximum and minimum tumor diameters using digital calipers; volume was calculated using the equation: tumor volume = 0.52a2b, where a and b represent the minimum and maximum tumor diameters, respectively (38Baguley B.C. Calveley S.B. Crowe K.K. Fray L.M. O'Rourke S.A. Smith G.P. Eur. J. Cancer Clin. Oncol. 1989; 25: 263-269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Matrigel implants were removed, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, processed for paraffin embedding, sectioned, and stained with Masson's trichrome. In vivo angiogenesis was analyzed as previously described (39Jadeski L.C. Lala P.K. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 1381-1390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Histological sections were scanned (40× objective and 10× ocular) for areas containing tumor associated blood vessels (researcher blinded to experimental condition). These areas were systematically imaged (160× magnification), and individual vessel counts for each field were documented to identify fields of maximum blood vessel density. Fields of maximum blood vessel density were statistically analyzed for between group differences; the data are expressed as the averages of three fields of maximum blood vessel density. Active Cdc42 and Rac1 Assay—Measurement of active Cdc42 was performed essentially as previously described (12Mataraza J.M. Briggs M.W. Li Z. Entwistle A. Ridley A.J. Sacks D.B. J. Biol.

Briefly, the cells were washed and lysed in 500 μl of buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm NaF, 20 μm GTP, 1 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitors). After clarification by centrifugation and incubation with glutathione-Sepharose, equal amounts of lysate were incubated with 40 μg of GST-WASP-GBD. The complexes were collected with glutathione-Sepharose and resolved by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The blots were probed with anti-Cdc42 antibodies (BD Biosciences) and detected by ECL. In addition, 50 μg of protein lysate was examined directly by blotting as whole cell lysate. Measurement of active Rac1 was performed by as outlined above for Cdc42, except GST-PAK-CRIB was used to isolate the GTP-bound protein, and the blots were probed with anti-Rac1 antibodies (BD Biosciences) (12Mataraza J.M.

Invasion Assays—Matrigel invasion assays were performed using 24-well BD BioCoat Matrigel Invasion Chambers (Becton Dickinson Labware, Bedford, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HEK-293H cells were transiently transfected with 2 μg of a plasmid that expresses wild type IQGAP1, IQGAP1G75Q, IQGAP1MK24, or pcDNA3 (as a control). After 36 h, the cells were trypsinized and counted with a hemacytometer. For the invasion assay, 2 × 105 cells were resuspended in 500 μl of medium containing 0.5% FBS and placed in the upper compartment of the chamber. The lower compartment was filled with 750 μl of medium containing 10% FBS. After allowing cells to invade for 40 h, the cells on the upper surface of the Transwell were carefully removed with a cotton swab, and the membrane was fixed and stained with DiffQuick (Dade Behring). Counting was done in five randomly selected fields (magnification, 10×) within each well. In experiments with MEK inhibitor, 2 × 105 MCF/V or MCF/I cells were resuspended in 500 μl of medium containing 1% FBS with 10 μm U0126 (Promega) or 0.1% Me2SO as a vehicle. The cells were placed in the upper compartment. The lower compartment was filled with 750 μl of growth medium containing 10% FBS. After 2 days, the number of cells that invaded were stained and counted as described above. Data Analysis—The data were analyzed using SigmaStat for Windows version 3.0.1a, and treatment groups (i.e. tumor cell lines: MCF/V, MCF/I, and MCF-siIQ8) were compared using one-way analysis of variance. A probability of 0.05 was used in determining statistical significance. Expression of IQGAP1 among Different Human Breast Cancer Cell Lines and Patient Tissue—IQGAP1 is overexpressed in several human neoplasms (16Sugimoto N. Imoto I. Fukuda Y. Kurihara N. Kuroda S.

Cancer Lett. 2006; 243: 120-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), but no published studies have examined breast carcinoma. Therefore, we determined the relative amounts of IQGAP1 among human breast epithelial cell lines. These cell lines can be divided into those that have estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors, namely MCF-7, T47D, ZR-75-1, and MDA-MB-361, and those lacking the receptors, namely MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435s, and Hs578T (41Lacroix M. Leclercq G. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2004; 83: 249-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein lysate from the cells were processed by Western blotting. Probing blots for tubulin verifies that equivalent amounts of protein are present in each sample (Fig. 1A). Analysis reveals that the amount of IQGAP1 in MCF-7, T47D, and ZR-75-1 cells is approximately equal (Fig. 1, A and B). Substantially less IQGAP1 is observed in MDA-MB-361, the other receptor-positive cell line. The reason for this finding is not known but may be because MDA-MB-361 is an adenocarcinoma (41Lacroix M. Leclercq G. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2004; 83: 249-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). The highest IQGAP1 levels are detected in MDA-MB-231 cells, which have 2.7-fold more IQGAP1 than MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1, A and B). Importantly, these cells exhibit the highest invasive potential of 30 breast cell lines measured by modified Boyden chamber assays (42Neve R.M. Chin K. Fridlyand J. Yeh J. Baehner F.L. Fevr T.

The amounts of IQGAP1 in MDA-MB-435S and Hs578T cells are not different to those in MCF-7 cells. Several factors may account for this observation. Cluster analysis of MDA-MB-435S cells reveals that these cluster with melanoma cells and may not be of breast origin (43Ross D.T. Scherf U. Eisen M.B. Perou C.M. Rees C. Spellman P. Iyer V.

https://openalex.org/W2139746526,"Regulated intramembrane proteolysis is a method for transducing signals between cellular compartments. When protein folding is compromised in the periplasm of E. coli, the C termini of outer-membrane proteins (OMPs) bind to the PDZ domains of the trimeric DegS protease and activate cleavage of RseA, a transmembrane transcriptional regulator. We show here that DegS is an allosteric enzyme. OMP binding shifts the equilibrium from a nonfunctional state, in which the active sites are unreactive, to the functional proteolytic conformation. Crystallographic, biochemical, and mutagenic experiments show that the unliganded PDZ domains are inhibitory and suggest that OMP binding per se is sufficient to stabilize the relaxed conformation and activate DegS. OMP-induced activation and RseA binding are both positively cooperative, allowing switch-like behavior of the OMP-DegS-RseA system. Residues involved in the DegS allosteric switch are conserved in the DegP/HtrA and HtrA2/Omi families, suggesting that many PDZ proteases use a common mechanism of allosteric activation."
https://openalex.org/W1973223713,"Early specification of endomesodermal territories in the sea urchin embryo depends on a moving torus of regulatory gene expression. We show how this dynamic patterning function is encoded in a gene regulatory network (GRN) subcircuit that includes the otx, wnt8, and blimp1 genes, the cis-regulatory control systems of which have all been experimentally defined. A cis-regulatory reconstruction experiment revealed that blimp1 autorepression accounts for progressive extinction of expression in the center of the torus, whereas its outward expansion follows reception of the Wnt8 ligand by adjacent cells. GRN circuitry thus controls not only static spatial assignment in development but also dynamic regulatory patterning."
https://openalex.org/W2009495224,"Acid-sensing ion channels are ligand-gated cation channels, gated by extracellular H+. H+ is the simplest ligand possible, and whereas for larger ligands that gate ion channels complex binding sites in the three-dimensional structure of the proteins have to be assumed, H+ could in principle gate a channel by titration of a single amino acid. Experimental evidence suggests a more complex situation, however. For example, it has been shown that extracellular Ca2+ ions compete with H+; probably Ca2+ ions bound to the extracellular loop of ASICs stabilize the closed state of the channel and have to be displaced before the channel can open. In such a scheme, amino acids contributing to Ca2+ binding would also be candidates contributing to H+ gating. In this study we systematically screened more than 40 conserved, charged amino acids in the extracellular region of ASIC1a for a possible contribution to H+ gating. We identified four amino acids where substitution strongly affects H+ gating: Glu63, His72/His73, and Asp78. These amino acids are highly conserved among H+-sensitive ASICs and are candidates for the “H+ sensor” of ASICs. Acid-sensing ion channels are ligand-gated cation channels, gated by extracellular H+.

For both channels, it has been shown that the apparent H+ affinity depends on the extracellular concentration of Ca2+ (19Babini E. Paukert M. Geisler H.S. Gründer S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41597-41603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 20Immke D.C. McCleskey E.W. Neuron. 2003; 37: 75-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar); low Ca2+ concentrations increase apparent H+ affinity, and high Ca2+ concentrations decrease affinity. This behavior is readily explained by a competition between Ca2+ and H+ for binding to the channel. More specifically, it has been proposed that there is a common Ca2+/H+-binding site at the outer entrance to the ion pore and that H+ would displace Ca2+ from this binding site, unblocking the ion pore (20Immke D.C. McCleskey E.W. Neuron. 2003; 37: 75-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In this model the Ca2+ ion itself would be the gate. This model, although very attractive, seems to be too simple. First, substituting a ring of negative charges at the outer entrance to the ion pore relieves open channel block by Ca2+, yet neither constitutively opens channels nor abolishes H+ gating and Ca2+ modulation of H+ gating (21Paukert M. Babini E. Pusch M. Gründer S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 124: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Second, detailed analysis of single channel events of fish ASIC favored changes in allosteric conformations as the gating mechanism (22Zhang P. Sigworth F.J. Canessa C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 127: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In summary, available evidence suggests that there are two binding sites for Ca2+ in the large extracellular region of ASICs: one at the outer entrance to the ion pore mediating open channel block and another one whose occupation stabilizes the closed state of the channel at low (resting) H+ concentrations (21Paukert M. Babini E. Pusch M. Gründer S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 124: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Ca2+ has to be displaced from both sites for channel opening. The binding site for Ca2+ at the outer entrance to the ion pore has been identified in rat ASIC1a; it is constituted by Glu425 and Asp432 (21Paukert M. Babini E. Pusch M. Gründer S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 124: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These two residues are conserved in all known ASICs, except H+-insensitive rat ASIC4. In analogy to most other Ca2+-binding proteins, it is very likely that acidic amino acids (Glu or Asp) contribute also to the second Ca2+-binding site. Regarding the mechanism of the Ca2+ dependence of ASIC activation, it could be that H+ activates the channel by direct titration of the carboxylates of one or both Ca2+-binding sites. Furthermore, it is unclear whether such protonation/Ca2+ unbinding is sufficient to open the channels or whether H+ has to bind somewhere else on the channel to trigger an additional conformational change in an allosteric manner. In the ASIC1 crystal structure, three pairs of acidic amino acids within a suspicious acidic pocket were proposed to constitute a crucial part of the H+ sensor (7Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). The purpose of the present work was to identify (a) amino acids contributing to the putative second Ca2+-binding site and (b) candidate amino acids contributing to allosteric changes upon binding of H+. To this end, we systematically screened charged residues within the extracellular region of ASIC1a. We chose ASIC1a as a model and Xenopus oocytes as an expression system because homomeric ASIC1a generates large current amplitudes in Xenopus oocytes. Our study, however, did not identify the three pairs of acidic residues identified on the basis of the structure as important for H+ gating of ASIC1. We rather identified a few amino acids, clustered in the post-TM1 region, that are crucial for H+ gating of ASIC1a. Electrophysiology—cDNAs for rat ASIC1a and ASIC2a have been described previously (13Bässler E.L. Ngo-Anh T.J. Geisler H.S. Ruppersberg J.P. Gründer S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33782-33787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 23Chen X. Gründer S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2007; 579: 657-670Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Point mutations were introduced by recombinant PCR using standard protocols with Pwo DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science). All of the PCR-derived fragments were entirely sequenced. Part of the ovaries of adult Xenopus laevis females were surgically removed under anesthesia. Anesthetized frogs were killed after the final oocyte collection by decapitation. Animal care and experiments followed approved institutional guidelines at the Universities of Tübingen and Würzburg. The follicular membrane was removed by digestion with collagenase type II (Sigma; 1 mg ml-1) for 60-120 min. Synthesis of cRNA, maintenance of X. laevis oocytes, and recordings of whole cell currents were done as previously described (21Paukert M. Babini E. Pusch M. Gründer S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 124: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We injected amounts of cRNA as indicated in Figs. 2 and 3. For co-expression of wild-type ASIC1a and 2a, we injected equal amounts (0.01 ng) of cRNAs of the two subunits. For co-expression of wild-type ASIC2a and mutant ASIC1a, we injected 0.01 ng of ASIC2a and 0.5 ng of mutant ASIC1a cRNAs. The bath solution for two-electrode voltage clamp contained 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES; concentrations of divalent cations (CaCl2 or MgCl2) were as indicated in the figure legends. HEPES was replaced by MES buffer where appropriate. Because H+ affinity of ASIC1 is modulated by extracellular Ca2+, we kept the Ca2+ concentration always constant (1.8 mm) between low pH activation and changed it only during low pH activation. This may slightly affect the shape of the blocking curve and the IC50. Holding potential was -70 mV. All of the measurements were performed at room temperature (20-25 °C).FIGURE 3Effect of substituting basic candidate residues.Left panel, bars represent means ± S.E. of peak current amplitudes induced by saturating H+ concentrations for wild-type channel or mutant channels carrying the indicated single substitutions.

Gründer S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2007; 579: 657-670Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The oocytes were injected with 1 ng of cRNA. Relative light units (RLUs)/s were calculated as a measure of surface expressed channels. RLUs of HA-tagged channels were at least 1000-fold higher than RLUs of untagged channels. The results are from two independent experiments with oocytes from two different frogs; at least six oocytes were analyzed for each experiment and each condition. Data Analysis—The data were analyzed with the software IgorPro (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). For each experiment, the oocytes from at least two different batches of frogs were used. For whole oocyte currents, pH response curves (for H+ activation and steady-state desensitization) were fitted with a Hill function, I=r+(Imax-r)/(1+(pH50/[H+])a)(Eq. 1) where Imax is the maximal current, r is the residual current, pH50 is the pH at which half-maximal activation is achieved, and a is the Hill coefficient. Time constants characterizing desensitization were determined with a mono-exponential function. The results are reported as the means ± S.E. They represent the means of n individual measurements on different oocytes. Statistical analysis was done with the unpaired Student's t test. For pH response curves, current peak amplitudes were normalized to the largest peak amplitude of a recording. H+ activation of ASIC1a undergoes tachyphylaxis (23Chen X. Gründer S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2007; 579: 657-670Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In our study, tachyphylaxis was variable among batches of oocytes as well as among different mutant channels. To reduce the impact of tachyphylaxis on the apparent EC50 of H+ activation, we performed recordings with increasing as well as decreasing concentrations of H+. We then took such a representative pair of recordings and normalized the respective current peak amplitudes by an empirical set of factors with the aim to minimize differences among the two recordings. We then normalized all recordings from that particular type of ion channel and batch of oocytes with the same factors. Mutational Screen of Acidic Amino Acids Identifies Two Residues within the Post-TM1 Domain That Are Critical for H+Activation—We first focused on acidic amino acids. By sitedirected mutagenesis, we replaced 31 conserved aspartates and glutamates (Fig. 1) by asparagine and glutamine, respectively, the chemically most similar nontitratable amino acids. We expressed mutant channels in Xenopus oocytes and tested their function by two-electrode voltage clamp. Because some mutations might render channels more sensitive to H+ activation, we generally used a conditioning pH of 7.8. For each mutant channel we determined the pH of half-maximal activation (EC50) and the maximal peak current amplitude at saturating pH. In addition, we determined the EC50 value with near physiological concentrations of divalent cations (1.8 mm Ca2+ and 1.0 mm Mg2+) and with low concentrations of divalent cations (0.1 mm Ca2+ and no Mg2+) in the acidic solution. This tested whether apparent H+ affinity of a particular mutant channel was still dependent on Ca2+ (19Babini E. Paukert M. Geisler H.S. Gründer S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41597-41603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The results from this first set of experiments are summarized in the left and right panels of Fig. 2. All single mutant channels could be activated by H+ and most had maximal current amplitudes that were comparable with or even larger than wild-type ASIC1a. Several substitutions, clustered in the post-TM1 region, reduced the current amplitude up to 2-fold (Fig. 2). Substituting Asp355 with Asn resulted in channels that were remarkable in two aspects. First, it required much larger amounts of RNA to get robust currents with this mutant. Second, H+ sensitivity was no longer dependent on extracellular Ca2+ (p = 0.6; Fig. 2). The significance of these observations, however, is unclear because when we substituted Asp355 with Ala the mutant channel expressed more readily and was activated by H+ in a Ca2+-dependent manner (p < 0.01; Fig. 2). The crystal structure of ASIC1 revealed an acidic pocket in the extracellular domain (7Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). Pairs of acidic amino acids that cluster in this acidic pocket are Asp237-Asp349, Glu238-Asp345, and Glu219-Asp407 (7Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). Of these six amino acids four were included in our screen (Fig. 1), at least one from each pair. None of these four substitutions impaired H+ gating of ASIC1a. Three substitutions (E219Q, E238Q, and D407N) did not alter apparent H+ affinity; only D237N decreased affinity (Fig. 2). Moreover, for all four mutants apparent affinity was still shifted by Ca2+, although this shift was small for E238Q. Thus, this initial screen did not support a crucial role in H+ gating for any individual acidic pair. It was surprising that, although the selection of residues for our initial screen had been very broad, none of the mutations seriously impaired H+ activation. We reasoned that Glu425 and Asp432 might constitute a redundant Ca2+-binding site that maintained the H+ sensitivity of mutant channels. To test this hypothesis, we introduced all of the above mentioned individual mutations also into the ASIC1a-E425G/D432C background, resulting in triple mutant channels, as summarized in the middle and right panels of Fig. 2. To measure E425G/D432C currents of comparable size as wild-type currents, we needed to inject 5-10-fold more RNA (compare color code in Fig. 2). In many cases the introduction of individual mutations into the double mutant channel led to a further (up to 8-fold) reduction of the maximal current amplitude. All of the mutants were, however, still H+-sensitive, with two exceptions: triple mutant channels carrying substitutions at residues Glu63 (category II; see legend to Fig. 2) or Asp78 (category I) did not produce reliable H+ activated currents, even after injection of maximal amounts of RNA (10 ng). A more detailed analysis of these mutants is described below. In addition to H+ insensitivity of triple E63Q and triple D78N channels, our screen revealed that H+ activation of triple E79Q channels was insensitive to Ca2+;EC50 was identical with physiological and low concentrations of divalent cations (Fig. 2, right panel). A D78N/E79Q double mutant also showed no longer a dependence on Ca2+ of its apparent H+ affinity (not shown), although both individual mutations did (Fig. 2, right panel). Therefore, we also determined for the triple E79Q mutant steady-state desensitization with physiological and low concentrations of divalent cations. In this case, Ca2+ shifted the concentration response curve by 0.2 pH units (not shown), similar to wild-type ASIC1a. Thus, evidence that Glu79 is involved in Ca2+ binding was not conclusive. Acidic amino acids from the acidic pocket (7Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar) were unsuspicious also as triple mutants: the triple E219Q, D237N, and E238Q substitutions decreased the apparent H+ affinity; however, several other substitutions resulted in the same behavior (Fig. 2), and a decrease in H+ affinity by itself does not imply a crucial role in H+ gating. Triple D407N had a slightly increased H+ affinity, which is unexpected if Asp407 forms a pair with Glu219 that is important for H+ gating. Moreover, the apparent affinity was shifted by Ca2+ for all four triple mutants. So far, our mutational screen showed that individual substitution of any conserved acidic amino acid, including those contributing to amino acid pairs in the acidic cluster of ASIC1, does not impair H+ gating of ASIC1a. Substitution of Glu63 and Asp78 in the E425G/D432C background, however, led to nonfunctional channels. These two amino acids, therefore, are candidates for amino acids involved in H+ gating. Mutational Screen of Basic Amino Acids Identified a Pair of Histidines within the Post-TM1 Domain That Is Crucial for H+Activation—Besides acidic amino acids, basic amino acids are candidate targets for protonation and could therefore contribute to an allosteric mechanism of H+ gating of ASICs. With its pK value around 6, histidine is a prime candidate to constitute a sensor for H+ activation of ASIC1a under physiological conditions. We considered also lysine and arginine residues because their more basic pK values could be shifted toward the physiological range, depending on their local environment within the channel protein. We individually substituted five conserved histidines (Fig. 1) by alanine or asparagine. Furthermore we individually substituted methionine for all lysines, which are conserved between ASIC1a and ASIC3, and glutamine for all arginines, which are conserved between ASIC1a and ASIC3 (the one exception is Arg175) yielding a total of 20 mutants. The results of the functional analysis of these mutant channels are summarized in Fig. 3. Among these mutants, only K211M was insensitive to H+ activation. The crystal structure revealed that Lys211 reaches deeply into a neighboring subunit to bind a Cl- ion that is buried within the extracellular loop of ASIC1 (7Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). The Cl- ion may have a role in assembly and gating of ASICs (7Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). To distinguish between these possibilities, we determined expression of this mutant at the oocyte surface. We inserted an HA epitope into the extracellular loop of ASIC1a wild type and of the K211M mutant and used a monoclonal anti-HA antibody and a luminescence assay to compare the surface expression of HA-tagged channels. This assay revealed that surface expression of the K211M mutant was significantly (p = 0.04) reduced compared with wild-type channels (Fig. 4). The observed reduction in surface expression by about 25%, however, cannot explain the dramatic reduction in current amplitude, suggesting that K211M has a predominant effect on gating rather than on assembly. To further investigate the role of Lys211, we replaced this residue also by Asp, Glu, His, or Arg. In contrast to K211M, all of these substitutions resulted in H+-sensitive channels that were, however, up to 10-fold less H+-sensitive than wild type (Fig. 3). Thus, although these results suggest a role for Lys211 in gating of ASIC1a, they show that a protonation/deprotonation cycle between a neutral and a positively charged residue at position 211 cannot be crucial for H+ sensitivity. Substitution of His72 in ASIC2a renders this channel H+-insensitive (24Baron A. Schaefer L. Lingueglia E. Champigny G. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35361-35367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), suggesting that it could be involved in the pH sensor of ASICs. It is not the sole determinant of ASIC2a H+ sensitivity, however (24Baron A. Schaefer L. Lingueglia E. Champigny G. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35361-35367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). His73 of ASIC1a corresponds to His72 of ASIC2a. Substitution of His73 by Ala in our screen resulted in H+-sensitive channels (Fig. 3), as previously found by others (24Baron A. Schaefer L. Lingueglia E. Champigny G. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35361-35367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar); maximal current amplitude of this mutant was, however, reduced 5-fold. In contrast to ASIC2a, ASIC1a has another His residue, His72, immediately adjacent to His73. Individual substitution of His72 by Ala resulted in functional channels; in contrast, combined substitution of His72 and His73 by Asn produced mutant channels that could no longer be activated by H+ (Fig. 3). The more conservative substitution of these two His residues by the basic amino acid lysine resulted in ion channels that were still sensitive to H+ activation, however, with dramatically reduced amplitude (not shown). These findings confirm that His72/His73 could be an element of the H+ sensor; in contrast to ASIC2a, in ASIC1a this crucial element would be constituted of two redundant His residues. Detailed Analysis of the Amino Acids That Are Critical for H+Activation—Our screen identified the following amino acid substitutions that strongly impaired H+ activation: E63Q and D78N in the E425G/D432C background and the H72N/H73N double mutant. All four amino acids cluster in a post-TM1 region, where they are highly conserved in ASICs. Fig. 5A shows a sequence comparison of the post-TM1 region of 19 ASICs from different species; for comparison, the sequence of proton-insensitive BLINaC (25Sakai H. Lingueglia E. Champigny G. Mattei M.G. Lazdunski M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 519: 323-333Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar), a channel closely related to ASICs, is also shown. The sequences were assigned to one of two groups: proton-sensitive (green) and proton-insensitive (red) ASICs. Proton sensitivity correlates well with the presence of a His residue at position 72/73 and a charged residue at positions 63 and 78. Exceptions are zASIC1.1 (4Paukert M. Sidi S. Russell C. Siba M. Wilson S.W. Nicolson T. Gründer S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18783-18791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) that does not have a His residue here and zASIC4.1 (4Paukert M. Sidi S. Russell C. Siba M. Wilson S.W. Nicolson T. Gründer S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18783-18791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) that does neither have Glu63 nor Asp78; for zASIC4.1 we have, however, recently shown that the amino acids at these two positions are crucial for its activity (26Chen X. Polleichtner G. Kadurin I. Gründer S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30406-30413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the top part of Fig. 5B, we show for comparison representative current traces of single substitutions at the critical sites. Wild-type ASIC1a rapidly activated and completely desensitized within less than 10 s (time constant τ = 1116 ± 137 ms, n = 9). Channels with individual substitutions at Glu63, Asp78, His72, or His73 behaved similarly, except that desensitization of D78N was faster (τ = 506 ± 25 ms, p < 0.05, n = 4). E425G/D432C double mutant channels are no longer blocked by Ca2+ but still show the typical transient ASIC current (Fig. 5B) (21Paukert M. Babini E. Pusch M. Gründer S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 124: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). As shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 5B, after long H+ stimulation washout of the acidic solution often induced a small “off” current for E425G/D432C channels. Introduction of the sub"

Surprisingly, the addition of TGF-β1 caused a significant decrease in Notch3 RNA and protein and a reciprocal increase in Hes1 gene transcription. The repression of Notch3 was mediated by SMAD activity and p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, whereas analysis of the Hes1 promoter revealed direct activation by Smad2 but not Smad3.

During wound healing, TGF-β1 activates fibroblasts to elicit contraction and the production of critical extracellular matrix components, but it is also associated with fibrosis, leading to an abundance of myofibroblasts that cause scarring (5Leask A.

These data imply that the activity of TGF-β1 is largely context-dependent and that its effect on a cell is determined by additional regulators that together establish its mode of function.

An important aspect in understanding TGF-β1 function is deciphering how its downstream mediators intersect with other signaling pathways, particularly those that might oppose or enhance its actions under certain circumstances. transforming growth factor-β1 small interfering RNA mitogen-activated protein extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase histone deacetylase green fluorescent protein horseradish peroxidase reverse transcriptase Myocardin-related transcription factor glyceral-dehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase smooth muscle cells.

The Notch family is made up of four transmembrane receptor proteins. Upon ligand binding, the receptors undergo cleavages that release an intracellular domain, which translocates to the nucleus and complexes with the CSL (CBF1/Su(H)/Lag-1) transcription factor (19Bianchi S. Dotti M.T. Federico A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 207: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The Notch/CSL complex activates transcription of target genes containing CSL binding elements, most notably members of the Hes (hairy/enhancer of split) and Hrt (hairy-related, also referred to as Hey, CHF, HESR) family of transcriptional repressors (20Iso T.

Mutations in several components of the Notch signaling cascade result in severe vascular defects in mice and zebrafish that include abnormalities in remodeling and branching and defects in arterial specification (16Gridley T.

Notch3 is expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells and is the causative gene for cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, an inherited disorder characterized by the progressive degeneration of smooth muscle (CADASIL) (21Joutel A.

Bousser M.G. Tournier-Lasserve E. Nature. 1996; 383: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (1698) Google Scholar). Phenotypic studies of Notch3-deficient mice revealed smooth muscle maturation defects, suggesting a role in differentiation (22Domenga V. Fardoux P. Lacombe P. Monet M. Maciazek J. Krebs L.T.

Consistent with this, Notch3 is down-regulated in arterial injury models (23Campos A.H. Wang W. Pollman M.J. Gibbons G.H. Circ.

However, Notch proteins are associated with both the promotion of differentiation as well as the maintenance of an undifferentiated state (25Bolos V. Grego-Bessa J. de la Pompa J.L. Endocr. Rev. 2007; 28: 339-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). In smooth muscle cells, molecular studies have shown that Notch1 and Notch3 can each inhibit smooth muscle-specific gene expression (26Morrow D. Scheller A. Birney Y.A. Sweeney C. Guha S.

Furthermore, the Notch target, Hrt2, can abrogate expression of smooth muscle genes by Myocardin, a potent cardiovascular transcription factor (27Doi H. Iso T. Yamazaki M. Akiyama H. Kanai H. Sato H.

By contrast, others have reported activation of smooth muscle genes by Notch proteins (30Noseda M. Fu Y. Niessen K. Wong F. Chang L. McLean G. Karsan A. Circ.

Taken together, these results indicate that, like TGF-β1, Notch function is context-dependent and its actions and subsequent effect on a cell are likely based on specific interactions with other signaling pathways. In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms associated with TGF-β1-induced smooth muscle gene expression in relation to Notch signaling. Our data show that Notch3 blocks TGF-β1-dependent differentiation, whereas TGF-β1 causes a decrease in Notch3 expression through SMAD and p38 MAP kinase. Unexpectedly, a known Notch target gene, Hes1, is up-regulated by TGF-β1, and contrary to its recognized ability to repress gene expression, Hes1 cooperates with Smad3 to activate the SM22α promoter. The results indicate that aside from directly regulating smooth muscle differentiation genes, TGF-β1 acts to repress the expression of a critical differentiation inhibitor, Notch3. Cell Culture—C3H/10T1/2 (10T1/2) mouse fibroblasts were obtained from ATCC. Primary cultures of bovine aortic smooth muscle cells were purchased from Cambrex (Lonza), and used at passage 6 for luciferase assays. Mouse brain endothelial cells (bEND.3) were a gift from W.

Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5 or 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and maintained in humidified 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For TGF-β1 experiments, cells were placed in 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 24 h, and where indicated, were supplemented with 1, 3.3, or 10 ng/ml TGF-β1 (Peprotech). Inhibitors were added 30 min prior to the addition of TGF-β1. Inhibitors used were as follows: TGF-β1RI (0.1 μm), PD98059 (MEK/ERK inhibitor) (10 μm), SB202190 (p38 inhibitor) (10 μm), JNK II (JNK inhibitor) (10 μm), 14-22 (protein kinase A inhibitor) (1 μm), bisindolylmaleimide I (protein kinase C inhibitor) (1 μm), actinomycin D (10 μg/ml), all from Calbiochem, and trichostatin A (histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor) (20 nm) from Sigma. Transfection and Luciferase Assays—Cells were transiently transfected at 80% confluency using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following manufacturer's instructions and harvested 48 h after the start of transfection. Notch3 siRNA was synthesized by IDT using a published sequence (34Park J.T. Li M. Nakayama K. Mao T.L. Davidson B. Zhang Z. Kurman R.J. Eberhart C.G. Shih Ie M. Wang T.L.

For reporter assays, the SM22α-1344 luciferase construct was a gift from L. Li (37Li L. Miano J.M. Mercer B. Olson E.N. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). CSL-luciferase was generated from CSL sites of the Hes1 promoter (35Ong C.T. Cheng H.T. Chang L.W. Ohtsuka T. Kageyama R. Stormo G.D. Kopan R. J. Biol.

The sequence is as follows: 5′-AGT TAC TGT GGG AAA GAA AGT TTG GGA GTT TCA CAC GAG-3′ (CSL sites underlined). Five tandem copies were cloned into the SmaI site of pGL3-promoter-luciferase (Promega). The mouse Notch3 promoter (–430 to + 83) was isolated by PCR of genomic DNA and cloned into pGL3-basic-luciferase (Promega) using NcoI and SalI. The Hes1 promoter from –199 to +40 (38Takebayashi K. Sasai Y. Sakai Y. Watanabe T. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5150-5156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was isolated by PCR of mouse genomic DNA and cloned into pGL3-basic-luciferase using XhoI and HindIII. Luciferase assays were performed using Bright Glo reagent (Promega) and quantified with a Turner Diagnostics luminometer. To normalize for transfection efficiency, 0.2 μg of hsp68-β-galactosidase (LacZ) (39Logan C. Khoo W.K. Cado D. Joyner A.L. Development (Camb.). 1993; 117: 905-916Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was cotransfected, and luciferase activities were normalized based on equivalent amounts of LacZ expression. LacZ activity was measured using Galacto-STAR (Tropix). Experiments were repeated a minimum of three times, and LacZ and luciferase assays were measured in duplicate. Statistical analyses were performed using Student's t test with data presented as the means ± S.E. Immunoblotting—Protein extract isolation and Western blot analyses were performed as described (40Harlow E. Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999Google Scholar). Protein samples were run on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to Hybond-ECL (Amersham Biosciences), and subjected to consecutive incubations with primary and secondary antibodies. Proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL), using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (HRP) secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). Primary antibodies and dilutions used were: Notch3 (1:1,000), Notch1 (1:1,000), Jagged1 (1:200), Hes-1 (1:100), all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and smooth muscle α-actin (1:20,000) (Sigma), Gapdh (1:1,000) (Novus Biologicals), and tubulin (1:40,000) and Smad4 (1:100) (Upstate Biotechnology). Secondary antibodies were: sheep anti-mouse Ig-HRP (1:10,000) and donkey anti-rabbit Ig-HRP (1:5,000) (Amersham Biosciences). Reverse Transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR)—Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed with M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) to generate cDNA. Gene-specific primers were then used for semiquantitative PCR amplification to detect relative amounts of transcript. Each primer set was optimized for PCR conditions that would detect relative differences in samples with known amounts of a specific transcript. The primer sequences are as follows: Notch3, forward, 5′-AGA TTC TCA TCA GGA ACC GCT CCA-3′; Notch3, reverse, 5′-CGG CGT CTC TTC CTT GCT GTC CTG-3′; SM22α, forward, 5′-GGC TGT GAC CAA AAA CGA TG-3′; SM22α, reverse, 5′-ATC TTT GCC CAG TGA CAC CCT C-3′; h1-Calponin, forward, 5′-GAA ATA CGA CCA TCA GCG GG-3′; h1-Calponin, reverse, 5′-CCA GTT TGG GAT CAT AGA GG-3′; Hes1, forward, 5′-GCC AGT GTC AAC ACG ACA CCG GA-3′; Hes1, reverse, 5′-TTC ATG CAC TCG CTG AAG CCG GC-3′; Hrt2, forward, 5′-ACA TCC TCC ATG GCC CAC CAC CA-3′; Hrt2, reverse, 5′-GACAGAGGGAAGCTGTGTGCAGC-3′; Gapdh, forward, 5′-ACC ACA GTC CAT GCC ATC AC-3′; Gapdh, reverse, 5′-TCC ACC ACC CTG TTG CTG TA-3′.

The implications of these studies led us to examine the role of Notch3 in an established model of myofibroblast/smooth muscle differentiation. 10T1/2 fibroblasts have been useful for defining the mechanisms involved in smooth muscle gene expression as numerous studies have demonstrated their ability to differentiate toward a smooth muscle fate in response to TGF-β1 (27Doi H.

Notch3 is expressed in 10T1/2 cells and in primary cultures of adult mouse aortic smooth muscle cells but not in the endothelial cell line bEND.3 (Fig. 1). This is consistent with in vivo data, demonstrating the expression of Notch1 in endothelial cells and of Notch3 in smooth muscle cells (16Gridley T. Development (Camb.). 2007; 134: 2709-2718Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 48Lindner V. Booth C. Prudovsky I. Small D. Maciag T. Liaw L. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 875-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Additionally, the Notch ligand Jagged1 is also expressed in 10T1/2 fibroblasts; thus, these cells are capable of activating Notch signaling through receptor/ligand interactions. We first examined the effect of overexpressing an activated form of Notch3 on TGF-β1-induced differentiation. 10T1/2 fibroblasts were transfected at 80% confluency with control plasmid or a plasmid expressing the Notch3 intracellular domain (NICD3) (35Ong C.T. Cheng H.T. Chang L.W. Ohtsuka T. Kageyama R. Stormo G.D. Kopan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5106-5119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and treated with vehicle or TGF-β1 for 24 h. Western blot and RT-PCR were performed to examine expression of smooth muscle marker genes (Fig. 2, A and B). In these experiments, NICD3 blocked the expression of smooth muscle α-actin, SM22α, and calponin in the presence of TGF-β1, suggesting that in fibroblasts, Notch3 acts to inhibit differentiation. We further verified these results using the SM22α-promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid (37Li L. Miano J.M. Mercer B. Olson E.N. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). Transfection of the SM22α reporter showed NICD3 strongly inhibited promoter activity and prevented its induction by TGF-β1. In contrast, NICD3 activated a luciferase plasmid containing CSL binding elements (35Ong C.T. Cheng H.T. Chang L.W. Ohtsuka T. Kageyama R. Stormo G.D. Kopan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5106-5119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), a defined Notch target, demonstrating that these repressive abilities are promoter-specific. These experiments were performed with cells cultured at high density (80% confluency at the start of transfection). Given that TGF-β1 has been shown to have density-dependent effects on smooth muscle cells and that Notch proteins are modulated by cell-cell contact, we tested whether cell density affected the inhibitory abilities of activated Notch3. Cells were transfected at ∼30% confluency, treated with TGF-β1 for 24 h, and collected for analysis prior to reaching 50% confluency. Although TGF-β1 did not activate the expression of smooth muscle genes as strongly in subconfluent conditions, overexpression of Notch3 still inhibited the expression of smooth muscle α-actin, SM22α, and calponin (Supplemental Fig. 1). Overall, these results are similar to previous reports, which showed an inhibitory effect of Notch family members on smooth muscle gene expression (26Morrow D. Scheller A. Birney Y.A. Sweeney C. Guha S. Cummins P.M. Murphy R. Walls D. Redmond E.M. Cahill P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: C1188-C1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 42Ono Y. Sensui H. Okutsu S. Nagatomi R. J. Cell. Physiol. 2007; 210: 358-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, they differ from others that described Notch activating these same genes (30Noseda M. Fu Y. Niessen K. Wong F. Chang L. McLean G. Karsan A. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 1468-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 31Doi H. Iso T. Sato H. Yamazaki M. Matsui H. Tanaka T. Manabe I. Arai M. Nagai R. Kurabayashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28555-28564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Our findings are unique in that they demonstrate that Notch3 blocks a specific differentiation cue by preventing TGF-β1-induction of smooth muscle genes. We next asked whether eliminating Notch3 from fibroblasts would promote differentiation in the absence of TGF-β1, and further, would exacerbate the TGF-β1 response. Transfection of siRNA revealed that in the absence of TGF-β1, smooth muscle α-actin, SM22α, and calponin were significantly increased when Notch3 was knocked down (Fig. 3). However, Notch3 knockdown in the presence of TGF-β1 did not considerably alter smooth muscle marker gene expression. We more closely examined this by using lower doses of TGF-β1 in an attempt to reveal potential differences. Nevertheless, no significant changes were observed in smooth muscle marker genes in the presence or absence of Notch3 between 1 and 10 ng/ml TGF-β1 (Fig. 3C). These data indicate that the absence of Notch3 alone is sufficient to promote differentiation and that an inducing signal, such as TGF-β1, ablates the inhibitory effects of Notch3. In verifying the efficacy of our Notch3 siRNA, we noticed that TGF-β1 decreased the level of Notch3 protein in control siRNA samples (Fig. 3A). We further examined this down-regulation in untransfected 10T1/2 cells over a time course of TGF-β1 stimulation. Both Notch3 protein and transcript levels significantly decreased after 12 h of TGF-β1 treatment and were difficult to detect at the 48-h time point (Fig. 4A). Comparable down-regulation of Notch3 was observed using TGF-β1 concentrations between 1 and 10 ng/ml (data not shown). The reduction in both RNA and protein suggested that this activity was regulated at the level of transcription. The addition of the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D reduced the level of Notch3 in both TGF-β1-treated and TGF-β1-untreated cells but abolished the TGF-β1-specific decrease of Notch3 (Fig. 4B). These data confirm that this regulation is under transcriptional control, although it could be indirect and could be dependent upon de novo transcription of a specific inhibitor that modulates other aspects of Notch3 synthesis. To determine whether this inhibition occurred in other cells, we assessed Notch3 levels in primary cultures of mouse embryonic fibroblasts and adult aortic smooth muscle cells. Both cell types showed a decrease in Notch3 expression in the presence of TGF-β1 (Fig. 4C), signifying that this was not unique to 10T1/2 fibroblasts and likely represents a general mechanism of TGF-β1 function.FIGURE 4Time course of Notch3 expression in the presence of TGF-β1. 10T1/2 cells were serum-starved for 24 h, and TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) was added for the indicated times.

The toxin's receptors on intestinal epithelial cells include claudin-3 and -4, members of a large family of tight junction proteins. Toxin-induced cytolytic pore formation requires residues in the NH2-terminal half, whereas residues near the COOH terminus are required for binding to claudins. The claudin-binding COOH-terminal domain is not toxic and is currently under investigation as a potential drug absorption enhancer. Because claudin-4 is overexpressed on some human cancers, the toxin is also being investigated for targeting chemotherapy. Our aim was to solve the structure of the claudin-binding domain to advance its therapeutic applications. The structure of a 14-kDa fragment containing residues 194 to the native COOH terminus at position 319 was solved by x-ray diffraction to a resolution of 1.75Å. The structure is a nine-strand β sandwich with previously unappreciated similarity to the receptor-binding domains of several other toxins of spore-forming bacteria, including the collagen-binding domain of ColG from Clostridium histolyticum and the large Cry family of toxins (including Cry4Ba) of Bacillus thuringiensis. Correlations with previous studies suggest that the claudin-4 binding site is on a large surface loop between strands β8 and β9 or includes these strands. The sequence that was crystallized (residues 194-319) binds to purified human claudin-4 with a 1:1 stoichiometry and affinity in the submicromolar range similar to that observed for binding of native toxin to cells. Our results provide a structural framework to advance therapeutic applications of the toxin and suggest a common ancestor for several receptor-binding domains of bacterial toxins.

Because claudin-4 is overexpressed on some human cancers, the toxin is also being investigated for targeting chemotherapy. Our aim was to solve the structure of the claudin-binding domain to advance its therapeutic applications. The structure of a 14-kDa fragment containing residues 194 to the native COOH terminus at position 319 was solved by x-ray diffraction to a resolution of 1.75Å. The structure is a nine-strand β sandwich with previously unappreciated similarity to the receptor-binding domains of several other toxins of spore-forming bacteria, including the collagen-binding domain of ColG from Clostridium histolyticum and the large Cry family of toxins (including Cry4Ba) of Bacillus thuringiensis. Correlations with previous studies suggest that the claudin-4 binding site is on a large surface loop between strands β8 and β9 or includes these strands. The sequence that was crystallized (residues 194-319) binds to purified human claudin-4 with a 1:1 stoichiometry and affinity in the submicromolar range similar to that observed for binding of native toxin to cells. Our results provide a structural framework to advance therapeutic applications of the toxin and suggest a common ancestor for several receptor-binding domains of bacterial toxins. Enterotoxin-positive Clostridium perfringens type A is one of the most common food poisoning agents in the United States; among the several toxins it produces is C. perfringens enterotoxin (CPE). 3The abbreviations used are:CPEC. perfringens enterotoxinC-CPECOOH-terminal domain of CPEN-CPENH2-terminal domain of CPE CPE has also been implicated in antibiotic-associated diarrhea in humans and is an important cause of gastrointestinal illness in domestic animals (1Smedley J.G. II I Fisher D.J. Sayeed S. Chakrabarti G. McClane B.A. Rev. Physiol Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 152: 183-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). CPE binds to human ileal epithelium, where it induces fluid and electrolyte loss along with epithelial cell necrosis (2Fernandez Miyakawa M.E. Pistone C.V. Uzal F.A. McClane B.A. Ibarra C. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 8407-8410Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). CPE cytotoxicity is a multistep process that initiates with CPE binding to an extracellular loop on specific members of the large claudin family of tight junction proteins (3Katahira J. Sugiyama H. Inoue N. Horiguchi Y. Matsuda M. Sugimoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26652-26658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 4Sonoda N. Furuse M. Sasaki H. +Yonemura S. Katahira J. Horiguchi Y. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). This is followed by formation of SDS-resistant complexes of ∼450 and ∼600 kDa, which contains CPE and claudins; the ∼600-kDa complex also contains a second tight junction transmembrane protein, occludin (5Singh U. Van Itallie C.M. Mitic L.L. Anderson J.M. McClane B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18407-18417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 6Robertson S.L. Smedley J.G. II I Singh U. Chakrabarti G. Van Itallie C.M. Anderson J.M. McClane B.A. Cell Microbiol. 2007; 9: 2734-2755Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These large complexes are thought to represent the cytotoxic pores, which create a hole in the plasma membrane and lead to cell death (7Chakrabarti G. McClane B.A. Cell Microbiol. 2005; 7: 129-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The structure of CPE remains unknown, and this has slowed a more detailed understanding of its complex pathogenic mechanism. C. perfringens enterotoxin COOH-terminal domain of CPE NH2-terminal domain of CPE The 35-kDa CPE toxin lacks primary sequence homology to any identified bacterial proteins, except for limited similarity (of unknown functional significance) between the NH2-terminal two-thirds of CPE and some Clostridium botulinum proteins. CPE has been functionally divided into two major domains, with the NH2-terminal half responsible for toxicity and the COOH-terminal half containing the claudin-binding sequences (8Kokai-Kun J.F. McClane B.A. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1997; 25: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Exposure to trypsin or chymotrypsin removes a putative prosequence resulting in a 2-3-fold increase in toxicity. The sequences sufficient for binding to cells and to claudins are located within the COOH-terminal 30 residues. Removal of these residues eliminates binding, and a fusion protein containing only these residues can compete for binding with full-length CPE to isolated brush border membranes (9Hanna P.C. Mietzner T.A. Schoolnik G.K. McClane B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11037-11043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In other studies, removal of the last 5 amino acids was sufficient to completely abrogate binding (8Kokai-Kun J.F. McClane B.A. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1997; 25: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A), although it remains unclear whether these residues contain the binding site or if their removal destabilizes the protein. Although the COOH-terminal half of CPE, C-CPE, is not cytotoxic, it does have distinct effects on the tight junction barrier of epithelia. For example, exposure of cultured Madin-Darby canine kidney cell epithelia monolayers to C-CPE-(184-319) results in a reversible decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance and increase in paracellular permeability for uncharged solutes (4Sonoda N. Furuse M. Sasaki H. +Yonemura S. Katahira J. Horiguchi Y. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). This is accompanied by a selective loss of claudin-4, whereas the levels and distribution of claudins that do not bind CPE are unaffected. The selective removal of specific claudins from the tight junction appears to be a different mechanism than CPE-induced toxicity, since the former is slow and reversible and does not affect plasma membrane integrity, whereas CPE-induced toxicity is associated with increased cell membrane permeability and is not reversible. This has led to investigation of C-CPE as an agent to enhance transepithelial drug absorption (10Kondoh M. Masuyama A. Takahashi A. Asano N. Mizuguchi H. Koizumi N. Fujii M. Hayakawa T. Horiguchi Y. Watanbe Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). CPE is also being investigated in cancer diagnosis and as a potential cancer chemotherapeutic agent. A large number of recent studies document dramatic up-regulation of the CPE receptors, claudin-3 and/or claudin-4, in many pancreatic ovarian, breast, and uterine cancers (reviewed by Morin (11Morin P.J. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 9603-9606Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar)). For example, injections of CPE into pancreatic tumors induced in nude mice resulted in tumor necrosis and significant reductions in tumor growth (12Michl P. Buchholz M. Rolke M. Kunsch S. Lohr M. McClane B. Tsukita S. Leder G. Adler G. Gress T.M. Gastroenterology. 2001; 121: 678-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Injection of CPE into the peritoneum of mice seeded with human ovarian cancer cells eliminated the malignant cells (13Santin A.D. Cane S. Bellone S. Palmieri M. Siegel E.R. Thomas M. Roman J.J. Burnett A. Cannon M.J. Pecorelli S. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 4334-4342Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In other studies, intracranial CPE administration inhibited tumor growth and increased survival in two murine models of breast cancer brain metastasis (14Kominsky S.L. Tyler B. Sosnowski J. Brady K. Doucet M. Nell D. Smedley J.G. II I McClane B. Brem H. Sukumar S. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 7977-7982Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In the current study, we determined the structure of the COOH-terminal domain of CPE, residues 194-319, which approximates the C-CPE domain used for functional studies by others and includes the claudin-binding site. The structure of C-CPE-(194-319) is a 9-strand β-sandwich and allows us to rationalize results of the claudin-binding studies. Structural similarity algorithms reveal previously unappreciated structural and sequence homology to the receptor-binding domains located at the COOH termini of several other toxins from spore-forming bacteria, suggesting a common origin. Availability of the structure of C-CPE-(194-319) will accelerate its therapeutic applications in cancer chemotherapy and drug delivery. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Invitrogen, and DNA was sequenced at the Genome Analysis Core of the University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center. Crystallography and structural studies were performed in the University of North Carolina Biomolecular X-ray and Structural Bioinformatics Cores. CPE Fragments—Sequences encoding C-CPE-(194-319) were amplified by PCR from C-CPE-(168-319) using the oligonucleotide primers 5′-GGGAATTCGGCgatatagaaaaagaaatccttgatttagctgctgc and 5′-GTGGAAATTACCCTTATTCAATATTATTTCAAAAATTTTAATAAGCTTG and cloned into the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pMAL K4 (15Gardberg A. Shuvalova L. Monnerjahn C. Konrad M. Lavie A. Structure. 2003; 11: 1265-1277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and expressed in Escherichia coli strain DH5α cells. Following induction with 0.3 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, bacteria were lysed by sonication in phosphate-buffered saline with protease inhibitor tablets (Complete Mini, EDTA-free; Roche Applied Science) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. MBP-C-CPE-(194-319) was affinity-purified from the soluble fraction with cobalt resin (Talon Superflow metal affinity resin; Clontech); purified protein was eluted with 150 mm imidazole in 10 mm Hepes, 120 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. C-CPE-(194-319) was cleaved from MBP by overnight digestion with thrombin (Sigma); after the addition of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, thrombin was removed by adsorption to para-aminobenzamidine-agarose (Sigma). C-CPE-(194-319) was separated from cleaved MBP by size exclusion chromatography on a Hi-Prep Sephacryl S-100 column (1.6 × 60 cm; GE Healthcare) in 10 mm Hepes, 120 mm NaCl; C-CPE-(194-319)-containing fractions were concentrated to 10 mg/ml using first a Centriplus then Centricon concentrator. Concentrated protein was clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min and used for crystallization trials; purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE. Claudin-4—Full-length human claudin-4 with an NH2-terminal His10 tag was expressed in Sf9 baculovirus cells and purified as previously described (16Mitic L.L. Unger V.M. Anderson J.M. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Frozen cell pellets were thawed and washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl with protease inhibitor tablets (Complete Mini, EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 units/ml DNase I. Cells were sonicated briefly, dodecylmaltoside (Anatrace, Manumee, OH) was added to 2%, and sample was incubated at 90 min at room temperature with gentle mixing. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 40 min, and supernatant was incubated with Co2+ resin (Talon) overnight. Resin was washed with 10 mm imidazole, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm dodecylmaltoside, and eluted in the same buffer with 150 mm imidazole. Claudin-4 was further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex S200 column (1 × 30 cm; GE Healthcare), and peak fractions were ∼70-90% pure (different preparations) based on SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Based on column calibration with molecular weight standards, recombinant claudin-4 elutes at a size consistent with a monomer (15.2 kDa) associated with a DDM micelle (average micelle mass of 50 kDa). For some binding assays, claudin-4 was further purified by rebinding to and re-elution from metal affinity resin after size exclusion chromatography. To measure the interaction between bacterially produced C-CPE-(194-319) and claudin-4 purified from insect cells, His-tagged claudin-4 was immobilized on cobalt affinity resin (Talon), and aliquots of 50 μl of beads (5 μm claudin-4) were incubated with 0.5-20 μm purified C-CPE-(194-319) overnight at 4 °C in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm dodecylmaltoside. Beads were washed four times in binding buffer and eluted with binding buffer containing 150 mm imidazole. Eluted material was diluted in SDS-sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and detected by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Relative protein levels were quantified using a Licor Odyssey infrared imaging system (Licor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE); binding assays were repeated twice. Binding curves were analyzed by nonlinear regression assuming a single binding site using Prizm software (Graph-Pad, San Diego, CA). Crystallization conditions were screened at 4 °C and room temperature using hanging drop vapor diffusion (17McPherson A. Hankins C.N. Shannon L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1791-1794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a commercially available screen (Salt Rx; Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA); small crystals were used to make microseed stocks. Crystals used in analysis were obtained by mixing 2 μl of protein solution at 10 mg/ml, 2 μl of reservoir solution containing 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.3, 0.8 m lithium sulfate, 20% glycerol, and 0.5 μl of microseed solution and allowing the drop to equilibrate against 0.7 ml of reservoir solution using the sitting drop method. Crystals were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen with cryo-oil (Hampton Research) as cryoprotectant, and all data sets were collected at 100 K (nitrogen stream). The structure was solved by single wavelength anomalous dispersion, using the short halide soak derivatization method of Dauter et al. (18Dauter Z. Dauter M. Rajashankar K.R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 232-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The crystal used for the NaI soak was harvested from its growth drop and soaked for 60 s in a 2.0-μl drop of its mother liquor to which NaI was added to 0.8 m. Data were collected at CuKα at the University of North Carolina Biomolecular X-ray Crystallography Facility on an R-Axis IV++ Image plate. The one sodium iodide-soaked crystal had a different unit cell (same space group, P212121), whereby the a axis was reduced by about 8 Å, the c axis was increased by about 12 Å, and the b axis was increased by about 2 Å. The change in unit cell in the NaI-soaked crystal results in completely different packing interfaces and a slight shrinkage (3.6%) in unit cell volume. The NH2 terminus points in a different direction with respect to the main C-CPE fold in the two crystal forms; however, this segment does not have iodide ions bound in the NaI soak, which might have explained the slightly different directions. As expected, there are iodide ions bound to the surface of the protein and participating in packing interactions in the soaked crystal, which could explain the unit cell rearrangement. It is also possible that the two unit cell packing arrangements are present in native crystals, and we happened to select the different form for the NaI quick soak, but it seems more likely that the rearrangement was caused by the soak. We did not collect data from any other native crystals, but since the structure of the protein is the same (except for the first 7 amino acids, which are not part of the COOH-terminal β sandwich) in the two forms, this observation is not biologically relevant. Iodide ion sites were found by SHELXD (19Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar) using data to 2.2 Å (three major sites, SHELXD CC = 40.96 all/22 weak). Solvent-flattened maps created by SHELXE were of excellent quality, such that the ArpWarp (20Morris R.J. Perrakis A. Lamzin V.S. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 229-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) automatic chain tracing program could place 112 of 126 of the amino acids of C-CPE-(194-319) correctly. Manual model rebuilding was carried out with COOT (21Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23389) Google Scholar), and all but the first four amino acids are well ordered (these are at the NH2 terminus of the construct). The model from the iodide soak unit cell was placed into the native unit cell using the molecular replacement program PHASER (22Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar); waters were located, and the model was adjusted with COOT, and then refinement was carried out using Refmac from the CCP4 (23Project Collaborative Computational Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar). Final refinement used the native crystal data, because the signal-to-noise ratio was higher in all resolution shells than the iodide-soaked crystal. The final model has good stereochemistry and Rfree of 22.7%. C-CPE-(194-319) Binds to Claudin-4 with High Affinity and a 1:1 Stoichiometry—Our long term goal is to understand how CPE and C-CPE interact with their cellular receptors, which are a subset of the large claudin family. The full-length toxin tends to aggregate after purification; consequently, we initially expressed, purified, and attempted to crystallize the previously characterized C-CPE-(168-319) fragment (Fig. 1A). This fragment is known to contain the claudin-binding region within residues 290-319. We found that this fragment is also unstable and oligomerizes upon storage at high concentration. By progressive deletion, we identified a fragment containing residues 194-319, which is highly stable and a monomer as determined by gel exclusion chromatography. In order to determine whether this fragment retained the ability to bind to claudin-4, we performed binding studies using purified His10-tagged human claudin-4 immobilized on Co2+ resin. Binding saturated with a 1:1 stoichiometry and Kd in the submicromolar range (Fig. 1, B and C). This high affinity is similar to that previously reported for C-CPE-(168-319) binding to claudin-expressing cultured cells (24Fujita K. Katahira J. Horiguchi Y. Sonoda N. Furuse M. Tsukita S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 258-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), and we conclude that C-CPE-(194-319) is an appropriate fragment of CPE for structural analysis. Structure of C-CPE-(194-319)—The structure of C-CPE-(194-319) was solved to 1.75 Å resolution using single wavelength anomalous dispersion and the short halide soak derivatization method of Dauter et al. (17McPherson A. Hankins C.N. Shannon L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1791-1794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The final model has good stereochemistry and Rfree of 22.7%.

Adjacent strands within each sheet have antiparallel orientations except for the uncommon parallel alignment of strands β1 and β3 (Figs. 2 and 3). The NH2-terminal seven residues, which are structured, interact with water molecules and not the main β sandwich, suggesting that the minimal C-CPE domain is formed by residues Ala205 through the COOH terminus at Phe319. This should assist future efforts aimed at producing a more solute and stable C-CPE domain for therapeutic application.FIGURE 3The topology of the ligand-binding domains of C-CPE-(194-319), ColG, and Cry4Ba are similar. The nine β strands (blue) of C-CPE-(194-319) are numbered from the amino end with strands 6-5-8-3-1 and 2-9-4-7 positioned on opposing sheets. Adjacent strands are antiparallel except for the uncommon parallel orientation of strands β3 and β1. This signature topology is shared by the receptor-binding domains of ColG and Cry4Ba. Surface loops are colored red. The short helix between β1 and β2 in C-CPE-(194-319) and three short β strands in Cry4Ba between β2 and β3, which are not part of the β sandwich, are removed in this presentation. Structures are oriented to optimize alignment of secondary structure elements using PRGOGRAM.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The claudin-binding region is known to be within the COOH-terminal 30 residues (25Takahashi A. Kondoh M. Masuyama A. Fujii M. Mizuguchi H. Horiguchi Y. Watanabe Y. J. Control Release. 2005; 108: 56-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), which corresponds to strands β8 and β9, each positioned in the center of the opposing β sheets, and the intervening surface loop spanning residues Lys304-Tyr312. This region is highlighted in dark blue in Fig. 2. Deletion of the COOH-terminal 30 residues eliminates claudin binding (8Kokai-Kun J.F. McClane B.A. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1997; 25: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, given the central position of strands β8 and β9, this manipulation may severely destabilize the overall structure, thus raising concerns about the interpretation of these binding studies. In contrast, a fusion protein encoding the same sequence can compete with native CPE for binding to cells, implicating residues in this region as the claudin-binding site. Furthermore, mutagenesis studies more specifically implicate the large surface loop between β8 and β9 in claudin binding (26Harada M. Kondoh M. Ebihara C. Takahashi A. Komiya E. Fujii M. Mizuguchi H. Tsunoda S. Horiguchi Y. Yagi K. Watanabe Y. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2007; 73: 206-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Single mutations of Tyr306, Tyr310, or Tyr312 to Ala all reduce claudin binding, whereas double mutants of Tyr306 with either of the other tyrosines eliminates binding (Fig. 2). Tyr306 and Tyr312 are buried under the loop; we speculate that their mutation will distort presentation of the loop surface but probably not disrupt the overall β sandwich fold or surface residues on strands β8 and β9. Mutation of Tyr306 to phenylalanine, also large and more hydrophobic, did not interfere with claudin binding, whereas mutation to the charged residue lysine eliminated binding (27Ebihara C. Kondoh M. Hasuike N. Harada M. Mizuguchi H. Horiguchi Y. Fujii M. Watanabe Y. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 316: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Knowledge of the structure suggests very direct mutagenesis studies to define the claudin-binding residues without disrupting the overall domain fold; further identification of these residues and their folding context could lead to development of peptidomimetics with claudin-binding activity. Strands β8 and β9 and especially the large intervening surface loop are attractive sequences for future investigation of claudin-targeting strategies. The C-CPE-(194-319) Structure Reveals Unexpected Similarity to the Receptor-binding Domains of Other Bacterial Toxins—C-CPE-(194-319) lacks convincing primary sequence homology to domains of any other bacterial toxin when subjected to standard BLAST searching and is thought to be biologically unique. However, a search for similar three-dimensional structures using the DALI (Z-score) and root mean square (DRMS) similarity algorithms (28Guerra C. Istrail S. Mathematical Methods for Protein Structure Analysis and Design. Springer-Verlag, New York2003: 109-115Google Scholar) revealed structural similarity with domains of more than 10 bacterial toxins. We highlight two examples that have striking biological analogy to C-CPE-(194-319) despite the initial absence of obvious sequence homology, namely domains within the ColG collagenase of Clostridium histolyticum (29Wilson J.J. Matsushita O. Okabe A. Sakon J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1743-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) (Z-score = 9.1, DRMS = 2.9) and the Cry4Ba toxin of Bacillus thuringiensis (30Boonserm P. Davis P. Ellar D.J. Li J. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 363-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) (Z-score = 6.5, DRMS = 3.8). In both cases, the similarity is with the ∼14-kDa COOH-terminal domain of the toxin/enzyme, which, like C-CPE-(194-319), functions in receptor binding by these toxins. Both are β sandwiches that share a similar secondary structure topology with C-CPE-(194-319). This includes the same relationship amongβ strands in each sheet, 6-5-8-3-1 on one side and 2-9-4-7 on the other, and the unusual parallel orientation of strands β1 and β3, noted in Fig. 3. Ribbon models of the three domains are oriented in Fig. 3 to optimize alignment of the secondary structure elements. Primary sequence homology can be identified within the corresponding β strands after first aligning residues that are located at analogous three-dimensional positions, using the Insight II algorithm (Accelrys Software Inc.). Alignment of homologous positions within the three sequences is presented in Fig. 4 with residues within each strand colored blue. Interestingly, when ClustalW is used to search for sequence homology among the three sequences, it aligns (boxed regions of Fig. 4) some but not all of the analogous three-dimensional positions. For example, ClustalW will align β4 of C-CPE and Cry4Ba but not ColG, despite ColG having chemically homologous residues at the analogous three-dimensional positions along the strand. Sequence homology is found at analogous positions within strands 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9. Strands 1, 2, and 6, which are on the periphery of the sheets, are not as clearly related, perhaps suggesting conservation of interactions within but not at the edges of the sandwich. We speculate that these receptor-binding domains share an evolutionary origin because of their similar folds, sequence homology at corresponding structural positions, and biological activities. Others have noted that β sandwich domains are common in receptor-binding domains for both microbial and eukaryotic proteins (31Wendt K.S. Vodermaier H.C. Jacob U. Gieffers C. Gmachl M. Peters J.M. Huber R. Sondermann P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 32Stocker A. Azzi A. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2000; 2: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). C. histolyticum is an anaerobic spore-forming bacterium that causes gas gangrene and produces collagenases that lead to extensive tissue destruction. The mature enzyme class I collagenase from C. histolyticum is composed of an NH2-terminal metalloprotease domain, a spacer domain, and two collagen binding domains. The COOH-terminal binding domain not only shows structural similarity to C-CPE-(194-319), but mutational analysis of selected amino acids demonstrates that, like CPE, several tyrosines near the extreme COOH terminus are critical for collagen binding (29Wilson J.J.

However, these are not analogous residues, since they are exposed to the solvent and present on strand β8 and not buried on the loop between β8 and β9 like in CPE. B. thuringiensis is also a spore-forming Gram-positive bacterium. It produces a large number of insecticidal toxins stored as crystalline (Cry) protoxins (33Knowles B.H. Adv. Insect Physiol. 1994; 24: 275-308Crossref Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In an analogous fashion to CPE, following ingestion and activation by gut proteases, the Cry4Ba toxin binds to specific receptors on insect gut epithelial cells. Binding is followed by a conformational change that leads to the formation of membrane pores in the epithelial cells and cell lysis (33Knowles B.H. Adv. Insect Physiol. 1994; 24: 275-308Crossref Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The Cry toxins have three domains, the first of which is the toxic/pore-forming domain, and the second two domains, II and to a lesser extent domain III, are involved in receptor binding (30Boonserm P. Davis P. Ellar D.J. Li J. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 363-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 34Burton S.L. Ellar D.J. Li J. Derbyshire D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 1011-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Domain III, which has structural similarity to C-CPE, resembles a number of carbohydrate binding domains that are found in microbial hydrolases and esterases (35Pigott C.R. Ellar D.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2007; 71: 255-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), but specific residues known to be critical for carbohydrate binding are not generally conserved in the domain III of Cry toxins. Thus, the receptor binding surfaces on Cry proteins and CPE do not appear to be analogous. C-CPE has been reported to interact with the second extracellular domain of claudins (24Fujita K. Katahira J. Horiguchi Y. Sonoda N. Furuse M. Tsukita S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 258-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). However, although we could demonstrate high affinity interactions with full-length claudin-3 (not shown) and claudin-4, we were unable to demonstrate binding of purified C-CPE to either synthetic peptides or fusion proteins comprising the second extracellular domain of claudin-3 or claudin-4. Future investigations will focus on the region of claudin-4 that interacts with C-CPE. In summary, the availability of a structure for C-CPE-(194-319) suggests an unsuspected shared origin for the receptor-binding domains of several bacterial toxins and should allow rational modifications of the protein for future therapeutic applications.

https://openalex.org/W2008525795,"Nucleotide excision repair is a versatile repair pathway that counteracts the deleterious effects of various DNA lesions. In nucleotide excision repair, there is a transcription-coupled repair (TCR) pathway that focuses on DNA damage that blocks RNA polymerase IIo in transcription elongation. XAB2 (XPA-binding protein 2), containing tetratricopeptide repeats, has been isolated by virtue of its ability to interact with xeroderma pigmentosum group A protein (XPA). Moreover, XAB2 has been shown to interact with Cockayne syndrome group A and B proteins (CSA and CSB) and RNA polymerase II, as well as XPA, and is involved in TCR and transcription. Here we purified XAB2 as a multimeric protein complex consisting of hAquarius, XAB2, hPRP19, CCDC16, hISY1, and PPIE, which are involved in pre-mRNA splicing. Knockdown of XAB2 with small interfering RNA in HeLa cells resulted in a hypersensitivity to killing by UV light and a decreased recovery of RNA synthesis after UV irradiation and regular RNA synthesis. Enhanced interaction of XAB2 with RNA polymerase IIo or XPA was observed in cells treated with DNA-damaging agents, indicating DNA damage-responsive activity of the XAB2 complex. These results indicated that the XAB2 complex is a multifunctional factor involved in pre-mRNA splicing, transcription, and TCR.

DNA carrying genetic information is continuously exposed to exogenous and endogenous DNA-damaging agents. The DNA damage interferes with DNA replication, transcription, and cell cycle progression and leads to mutations and cell death, which may cause cancer, inborn diseases, and aging (1Hoeijmakers J.H.

However, a wide variety of DNA lesions, such as ultraviolet light-induced photo-lesions, intra-strand cross-links, and bulky adducts induced by various carcinogens and mutagens, are eliminated by nucleotide excision repair (NER) 5The abbreviations used are:NERnucleotide excision repairTCRtranscription-coupled repairXPAxeroderma pigmentosum group A proteinXPxeroderma pigmentosumsiRNAsmall interfering RNACSCockayne syndromeRNAP IIRNA polymerase IITFIIHtranscription factor IIHTPRtetratricopeptide repeatPMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideRTreverse transcriptionRSRNA synthesisRRSRNA synthesis after UV irradiationsnRNAsmall nuclear RNAGGRglobal genome repair. 5The abbreviations used are:NERnucleotide excision repairTCRtranscription-coupled repairXPAxeroderma pigmentosum group A proteinXPxeroderma pigmentosumsiRNAsmall interfering RNACSCockayne syndromeRNAP IIRNA polymerase IITFIIHtranscription factor IIHTPRtetratricopeptide repeatPMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideRTreverse transcriptionRSRNA synthesisRRSRNA synthesis after UV irradiationsnRNAsmall nuclear RNAGGRglobal genome repair.

It has been shown that NER operates via the following two pathways: global genome repair (GGR) and transcription-coupled repair (TCR). GGR can act on DNA lesions at any location in the genome, whereas TCR is involved in a rapid removal of the lesions on the transcribed strand and a resumption of transcription (1Hoeijmakers J.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 366-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (3137) Google Scholar, 8Svejstrup J.Q. Nat. Rev. Mol.

The biological importance of NER in humans has been suggested by studies of autosomal recessive human genetic disorders as follows: xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), Cockayne syndrome (CS), and trichothiodystrophy, in which NER activity is impaired (9Lehmann A.R. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 1101-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). XP patients are hypersensitive to sunlight and show an increased incidence of UV-induced skin cancers (9Lehmann A.R. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 1101-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Although CS patients are sensitive to sunlight, they have no predisposition to sunlight-induced skin cancer but instead show severe developmental and neurological abnormalities as well as premature aging (10Nance M.A. Berry S.A. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1992; 42: 68-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Seven NER-deficient complementation groups have been identified in XP (XP-A to XP-G) and two in CS (CS-A and CS-B) (3Wood R.D. Mitchell M. Sgouros J. Lindahl T. Science. 2001; 291: 1284-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). In addition, XP-B patients and certain patients with XPD or XPG show features of CS in addition to symptoms of XP (XP-B/CS, XP-D/CS, and XP-G/CS). Recently, we reported that XPG stabilizes TFIIH. Mutations in XPG found in cells of patients with XP-G/CS result in the dissociation of CAK and XPD from the core TFIIH. As a consequence, the phosphorylation and transactivation of nuclear receptors were disturbed in XP-G/CS cells. These results indicated that the features of CS in XP-G/CS are because of abnormal transcriptional activation by an unstable TFIIH (11Ito S. Kuraoka I. Chymkowitch P. Compe E. Takedachi A.

Following the damage-recognition step in each pathway, NER factors, including transcription factor IIH (TFIIH), XPG, XPA, and replication protein A, are recruited to the lesion, leading to the local unwinding of the DNA double helix. TFIIH, including XPB and XPD helicases, plays a critical role in the formation of this open complex. Two structure-specific endonucleases, XPF-ERCC1 and XPG, subsequently introduce single-stranded breaks on the 5′ and 3′ sides of the lesion, respectively, leading to excision of the oligonucleotides containing the damage. We have performed yeast two-hybrid screening with XPA protein as bait and isolated a cDNA encoding a novel tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) protein consisting of 855 amino acids and designated as XAB2 (XPA-binding protein 2) (17Nakatsu Y. Asahina H. Citterio E. Rademakers S. Vermeulen W. Kamiuchi S. Yeo J.P. Khaw M.C. Saijo M. Kodo N. Matsuda T. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Tanaka K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34931-34937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). It has been shown that XAB2 also interacts with the TCR-specific factors CSA, CSB, and RNA polymerase II and that the microinjection of anti-XAB2 antibodies into normal human cells specifically inhibited the recovery of RNA synthesis after UV irradiation as well as transcription but not UV-induced unscheduled DNA synthesis, and that XAB2 knock-out mice show preimplantation lethality (18Yonemasu R. Minami M. Nakatsu Y. Takeuchi M. Kuraoka I. Matsuda Y. Higashi Y. Kondoh H. Tanaka K. DNA Repair. 2005; 4: 479-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A recent in vivo cross-linking and chromatin immunoprecipitation study showed that XAB2 binds to RNA polymerase II in a CSA- and CSB-dependent manner (19Fousteri M. Vermeulen W. van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 471-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). All these results have indicated that XAB2 is involved in TCR as well as transcription but not in GGR. It is suggested that the TPR domains play a role in intra- and inter-molecular protein interactions. Therefore, we purified XAB2 as a multimeric protein complex from extracts of HeLa cells expressing FLAG-XAB2 fusion protein using anti-FLAG antibody beads. The XAB2 complex consists of hAquarius (IBP160), XAB2 (hSYF1), hPRP19, CCDC16, hISY1, and PPIE, which are known to be involved in pre-mRNA splicing, and bound to RNA but not DNA, indicating that this complex functions in pre-mRNA splicing. The down-regulation of XAB2 expression in normal human cells resulted in hypersensitivity to killing by UV light, and it decreased the rate of recovery of RNA synthesis after UV irradiation, nascent RNA synthesis, and pre-mRNA splicing. Moreover, in the cells treated with DNA-damaging agents, the association of XAB2 with RNA polymerase IIo (elongation mode) and XPA was enhanced. The XAB2 complex is a multifunctional factor involved in transcription, pre-mRNA splicing, and TCR. Purification of XAB2 Complex—HeLa cells stably expressing N-terminally FLAG-tagged XAB2 cDNA were prepared as described previously (13Groisman R. Polanowska J. Kuraoka I. Sawada J. Saijo M.

Methods Enzymol. 2003; 370: 430-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). FLAG-XAB2 complexes were purified by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody from cell extracts. FLAG-XAB2-containing fractions were further purified using Superose 6 HR10/30 (Amersham Biosciences) with buffer A containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5 mm MgCl2. The fractions containing XAB2 complexes were collected and loaded onto a MiniQ column (Amersham Biosciences). The bound proteins were eluted with KCl buffer (50 mm to 1 m) containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5 mm MgCl2. The fractions containing the FLAG-XAB2 complex were pooled and dialyzed into buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), 100 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). The FLAG-XAB2 complex was stored at –80 °C. Mass Spectrometric Analysis—The identification of proteins with mass spectrometry was conducted as described previously (21Wang Y. Cortez D. Yazdi P. Neff N. Elledge S.J. Qin J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 927-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Antibodies—Anti-XAB2, anti-hPrp19, and anti-CCDC16 rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against peptides corresponding to amino acids 811–838 of XAB2, to amino acids 182–208 of hPrp19, and to amino acids 93–115 of CCDC16, respectively. Anti-hAquarius, hISY1, and PPIE rabbit antibodies were raised against the recombinant His-hAquarius (amino acids 1308–1421), GST-hISY1, and GST-PPIE proteins (amino acids 67–164), respectively. These antibodies were affinity-purified using a protein A-Sepharose column. Anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2) was purchased from Sigma. Anti-RNAP II polyclonal antibodies (C-21 and N-20) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-RNAP II monoclonal antibodies (8WG16 and H5) were from Berkeley Antibody.

The extracts (500 μl) were incubated with either anti-PPIE, hISY1, CCDC16, hPRP19, or hAquarius antibody (1 μg) at 4 °C for 2 h, and the mixtures were further incubated with protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for precipitation at 4 °C for 2 h. After the beads had been washed with NETN buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and a protease inhibitor mixture (complete, Roche Diagnostics)), the proteins bound to the beads were eluted by boiling them in SDS sample buffer. For the co-immunoprecipitation experiments in Fig. 1E, lane 8, and Fig. 2, B and C, HeLa cells (8 × 105) were transfected with FLAG-tagged hPRP19 or a series of FLAG-tagged XAB2 in the expression vector pCAGGS (3 μg) using PolyFect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty four hours after transfection, cells were collected and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cell extracts were prepared as described previously (13Groisman R. Polanowska J.

Construction of Truncated XAB2 and PPIE Expression Plasmids—Expression constructs of the FLAG-tagged XAB2 cDNA with a C-terminal deletion in the mammalian expression vector pCAGGS were generated with the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using oligonucleotides that contain a stop codon at the indicated sites. The truncation mutant of XAB2 (1–20 and 578–855) was made by restriction digestion of the full-length XAB2 cDNA with PpuMI. The N-terminal and C-terminal deletion mutants of XAB2 cDNA were generated by a PCR-based method. GST-PPIE proteins with various deletions were made as follows. PPIE cDNAs (3–301 and 67–164) were amplified by RT-PCR. PPIE cDNAs (3–81, 83–236, and 238–301) were obtained by restriction digestion of PPIE cDNAs (3–301) with MscI, and PPIE cDNAs (3–152 and 152–301) by restriction digestion with NaeI. These PPIE cDNAs were inserted into pGEX-6p (Amersham Biosciences). All the constructs were checked by DNA sequencing. Gel Mobility Shift Assays—DNA probes (202 bp) for gel mobility shift assays were generated by PCR amplification of pBluescript SK(–) (Stratagene) using the primers (reverse primer) 5′-GGAAACAGCTATGACCATG-3′ and (M13–20 primer) 5′-GTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3′ in the presence of an NTP mixture containing [α-32P]CTP (Amersham Biosciences). RNA probes were synthesized from the DNA probe using T7 RNA polymerase (Toyoba) in the presence of an rNTP mixture containing [α-32P]UTP (Amersham Biosciences). Both probes were purified in a nondenatured 6% polyacrylamide gel. RNA and DNA competitors for the gel mobility shift competition assays were generated by the same methods in the presence of cold rNTP and NTP mixtures, respectively. The XAB2 complex was incubated with the RNA or DNA probe in binding buffer (10 μl) containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 6 mm MgCl2 for 30 min at 4 °C. After the incubation, the binding reaction mixtures were separated on a nondenatured 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE buffer. The dried gels were then analyzed with a FUJIFILM BAS 2500 bio-image analyzer. For the supershift assays using anti-FLAG antibody, the reaction mixtures were incubated with 2.45 μg of monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody for 5 min at 4 °C before being loaded onto the polyacrylamide gel. For RNA binding assays, the XAB2 complex was incubated with either glutathione-Sepharose, poly(A)-Sepharose, or poly(U)-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) in binding buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 6 mm MgCl2, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 4 °C. After the incubation, unbound XAB2 complex was removed by washing the Sepharose beads three times with NETN buffer containing 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Bound fractions were then separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies against each subunit of the XAB2 complex. Knockdown of XAB2 by siRNA—The XAB2 siRNA duplex mixtures used in the experiment in Fig. 4A were purchased from Dharmacon. The siRNAs were transfected into HeLa cells using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cy3-labeled Luciferase GL2 duplex (Dharmacon) was employed as control siRNA. The XAB2 siRNAs used in the experiment in Fig. 4D were purchased from Dharmacon. The XAB2 target sequences are as follows: XAB2 siRNA-1 (5′-AAGCCCAGGCUCAAUCAGCUAUA-3′) and XAB2 siRNA-2 (5′-AACAACUGUCAUGAGAGGGCCUU-3′). All the siRNA experiments were carried out 48 h after transfection. RT-PCR Assay for Pre-mRNA Splicing—RNA was extracted from siRNA-transfected cells with an RNA purification kit (Qiagen) and then treated with RNase-free DNase I (Takara) as recommended by the supplier. Purified RNAs were employed to synthesize PCR products with a cMaster RT-PCR system and RT kit (Eppendorf), and primers for the amplification of Bcl-x cDNA were described previously (31Mercatante D.R.

After a 24-h incubation, cells were washed with PBS and treated with UV irradiation at 10 J/m2. After another 24-h incubation, cells were washed with PBS and labeled for 1 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing [3H]uridine (10 μCi/ml) to quantify the recovery of RNA synthesis after UV irradiation. After the labeling with [3H]uridine, 20 μl of 10 mg/ml sodium azide (NaN3) was added to 1 ml of cell culture, and the cells were washed twice with PBS containing NaN3 (200 μg/ml). The cells were suspended in 200 μl of sterilized water and then frozen. After the cells were thawed at room temperature, 400 μl of 1.2% SDS was added to the cell suspension, which was then incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After the addition of 400 μl of water, the cell lysates were collected into sample tubes and incubated for 30 min on ice. One milliliter of 10% trichloroacetic acid, 0.1 m sodium pyrophosphate (NaPPi) was added into each sample tube and mixed. After incubation for 30 min on ice, these mixtures were transferred onto GF/C glass microfiber filters (Whatman). The filters were washed with 5% trichloroacetic acid, 0.05 m NaPPi, then with ethanol, and dried. The filters were transferred into vials, and scintillation solution was added. Radioactivity was measured with an LS 6500 liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter). The radioactivity of the unirradiated cells was indicated as RNA synthesis (RS), whereas the percentage of radioactivity in the UV-irradiated cells divided by that in the unirradiated cells was indicated as recovery of RNA synthesis after UV irradiation (RRS). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells grown on coverslips were washed with PBS and fixed with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 2% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min and then incubated in acetone for 5 min at –20 °C. The samples were blocked with PBS containing 5% normal goat serum at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were washed three times with PBS for 5 min, and incubated with anti-XAB2 antibody or antibody indicated in the legends for Fig. 5 in blocking buffer at room temperature for 1 h. Cells were then washed three times with PBS for 5 min, incubated with Alexa Fluor-conjugated antibody (diluted 1:500; Molecular Probes) in PBS at room temperature for 1 h, and washed three times with PBS. The samples were examined with a MRC-1024 fluorescence microscopy system (Bio-Rad). Colony-forming Assay—Cells were inoculated into 10-cm dishes at a density of 1000 cells per dish. After a 6-h incubation, cells were washed with PBS and UV-irradiated at 0, 4, and 12 J/m2. The cells were then incubated for 2–3 weeks. The colonies that formed were fixed with 10% formalin, stained with 0.1% crystal violet, and counted under a binocular microscope. Purification of XAB2 Protein Complex—XAB2 is a TPR protein of 855 amino acids containing three stretches of acidic residues (Fig. 1A). Mutational and structural studies of some TPR proteins suggested that TPR domains play a role in intra- and inter-molecular protein interactions (24Das A.K. Cohen P.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 25Lamb J.R. Tugendreich S. Hieter P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 257-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Consistent with these reports, our gel filtration analysis revealed that XAB2 is included in the ∼0.5-MDa fraction (data not shown). Therefore, we purified XAB2 as a multimeric protein complex from nuclear extract of HeLa cells stably expressing FLAG-XAB2 fusion protein. First, the FLAG-XAB2 complex was isolated by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody. The protein complex was further purified by gel filtration and MiniQ column chromatography (Fig. 1B). Silver staining of the main peak fractions of Superose 6 indicated that XAB2 was co-migrated with p160, p57, p50, p42, and p35 (Fig. 1C, fractions 12–14). Silver staining of the peak fraction of MiniQ revealed that XAB2 is part of a protein complex consisting of six subunits (Fig. 1D, left panel). Mass spectrometric analysis of these subunits revealed that they are hAquarius (IBP160: p160), XAB2 (hSYF1: p100), hPRP19 (hPSO4: p57), CCDC16 (p50), hISY1 (p42), and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase E (PPIE: p35) (Table 1). The hAquarius is an intron-binding protein (IBP160), which has been reported as the key factor"
https://openalex.org/W1991959198,"The proton-translocating NADH-quinone (Q) oxidoreductase (NDH-1) from <i>Escherichia coli</i> is composed of two segments: a peripheral arm and a membrane arm. The membrane arm contains 7 hydrophobic subunits. Of these subunits, NuoM, a homolog of the mitochondrial ND4 subunit, is proposed to be involved in proton translocation and Q-binding. Therefore, we conducted site-directed mutation of 15 amino acid residues of NuoM and investigated their properties. In all mutants, the assembly of the whole enzyme seemed intact. Mutation of highly conserved Glu<sup>144</sup> and Lys<sup>234</sup> leads to almost total elimination of energy-transducing NDH-1 activities as well as increased production of superoxide radicals. Their NADH dehydrogenase activities were almost normal. Because these two residues are predicted to be located in the transmembrane segments of NuoM, the results strongly suggest that they participate in proton translocation. Although it is hypothesized that His interacts with a Q head group, mutations at four His moderately inhibited NDH-1 activities and had almost no effect on the <i>K<sub>m</sub></i> values for Q or IC<sub>50</sub> values of capsaicin-40, a competitive inhibitor for the Q binding site. The data suggest that these His are not involved in the catalytic Q-binding. Functional roles of NuoM and advantages of NDH-1 research as a model for mitochondrial complex I study have been discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2031692952,"Inflammatory changes, characterized by an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine production and up-regulation of the corresponding signaling pathways, have been described in the brains of aged rats and rats treated with the potent immune modulatory molecule lipopolysaccharide (LPS). These changes have been coupled with a deficit in long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampus. The evidence suggests that anti-inflammatory agents, which attenuate the LPS-induced and age-associated increase in hippocampal interleukin-1β (IL-1β) concentration, lead to restoration of LTP. Here we report that atorvastatin, a member of the family of agents that act as inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, exerts powerful anti-inflammatory effects in brain and that these effects are mediated by IL-4 and independent of its cholesterol-lowering actions. Treatment of rats with atorvastatin increased IL-4 concentration in hippocampal tissue prepared from LPS-treated and aged rats and abrogated the age-related and LPS-induced increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines, interferon-γ (IFNγ) and IL-1β, and the accompanying deficit in LTP. The effect of atorvastatin on the LPS-induced increases in IFNγ and IL-1β was absent in tissue prepared from IL-4–/– mice. The increase in IL-1β in LPS-treated and aged rats is associated with increased microglial activation, assessed by analysis of major histocompatibility complex II expression, and the evidence suggests that IFNγ may trigger this activation. We propose that the primary effect of atorvastatin is to increase IL-4, which antagonizes the effects of IFNγ, the associated increase in microglial activation, and the subsequent cascade of events.

The adverse effects of inflammation in the brain have been shown to include down-regulation of synaptic function.

In each of these conditions, LTP is impaired and, in some cases, the impairment is abrogated by strategies that restore IL-1β concentration to the lower values observed in control conditions (4Lonergan P.E. Martin D.S. Horrobin D.F. Lynch M.A. J. Neurochem. 2004; 91: 20-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A role for IL-4 in modulating IL-1β production has been demonstrated (6Lynch A.M.

It seems likely that the increase in IL-1β concentration in the brain in inflammatory conditions is derived from activated microglia, and therefore parallel changes in IL-1β concentration and microglial activation have been identified in brain of aged and LPS-treated rats (8Moore M.E. Piazza A. McCartney Y. Lynch M.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 573-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, the trigger leading to activation of microglia has not been identified, although results from several studies have suggested that one of the most potent activators of microglia in vitro is interferon-γ (IFNγ (9Milner R.

Recent work has identified anti-inflammatory properties of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (i.e. statins) that are distinct from their ability to lower cholesterol. It has been shown that statins reduce Aβ deposition and inflammatory changes in mouse models of Alzheimer disease (12Lindberg C. Crisby M. Winblad B. Schultzberg M. J. Neurosci.

Am. J. Cardiol. 2003; 91: 23B-29BAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Statins have also been shown to decrease symptoms and mortality in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (17Kawashima S. Yamashita T. Miwa Y. Ozaki M. Namiki M. Hirase T. Inoue N. Hirata K. Yokoyama M. Stroke. 2003; 34: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Because of their reported anti-inflammatory effects, it might be predicted that statins will counteract the inflammatory changes induced by age and by LPS treatment. To test this prediction, we investigated the effect of atorvastatin treatment on the age-related and LPS-induced changes in rat hippocampus. We report that the age- and LPS-associated microglial activation, increase in concentrations of IFNγ and IL-1β, and deficit in LTP were abrogated in atorvastatin-treated rats. Because atorvastatin failed to attenuate the LPS-induced increases in cytokine concentrations in tissue prepared from IL-4–/– mice, we propose that the primary action of atorvastatin may be to trigger production of IL-4 and thereby prevent the IFNγ-induced microglial activation. Animals—Twenty-four, 2- to 3-month-old male Wistar rats (BioResources Unit, Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland), were used in the first study, and 18 aged (22–24 months) and 12 young (3–4 months) animals (Bantham and Kingman, UK) were used in the second study. We also used 24 2- to 5-month-old C57BL/6 (Harlan UK Ltd.) and C57BL/6 IL-4-defective (IL-4–/–) mice (B&K Universal, UK). Rats were housed in groups of 2–6, and mice were housed singly, under a 12-h light schedule. Ambient temperature was controlled between 22 and 23 °C, and animals were maintained under veterinary supervision throughout the study. These experiments were performed under a license issued by the Department of Health (Ireland) and with ethical approval from the local ethical review group. Atorvastatin Treatment Regimen—Food and water intake was assessed daily for 1 week, and animals were then randomly assigned to a control treatment or atorvastatin treatment group. Atorvastatin (5 and 10 mg/kg/day in the case of rats and mice, respectively; Lipitor, Pfizer-Parke Davis, Ireland) was given orally for 3 weeks in the laboratory chow. In the first and third studies, the control- and atorvastatin-treated groups of rats and mice were subsequently subdivided into those that received saline intraperitoneally and those that received LPS (100 μg/kg Escherichia coli serotype 0111.B4, Sigma-Aldrich, UK) intraperitoneally on the day of the experiment. In the second study, young and aged rats were subdivided into control- and atorvastatin-treated groups, and treatment continued for 8 weeks. Rats and mice were given their daily allowance of food and monitored to ensure that they received their full daily dose of atorvastatin. Animals were weighed at intervals throughout the study to ensure that similar weight changes were occurring in the different treatment groups. At the end of the treatment period, mice were killed by cervical dislocation, the brain was rapidly removed, dissected on ice, sliced (350 × 350μ m) using a McIlwain tissue chopper, and stored in Krebs buffer containing CaCl2 (1.13 mm) and 10% Me2SO at –80 °C as previously described (1Martin D.S. Lonergan P.E. Boland B. Fogarty M.P. Brady M. Horrobin D.F. Campbell V.A. Lynch M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34239-34246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) until required for analysis. Rats were assessed for their ability to sustain LTP. Induction of LTP in Vivo—Young rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of urethane (1.5 g/kg), and aged rats were initially given 1.2 g/kg urethane with further increments to a maximum of 2.0 g/kg when required. The absence of a pedal reflex was considered to be an indicator of deep anesthesia. In the case of the experiments in which the effect of atorvastatin was assessed on LPS-induced changes, LPS (100 μg/kg, Sigma, UK) or saline was injected intraperitoneally and 3 h later animals were assessed for their ability to sustain LTP. In some experiments rats were injected intracerebroventricularly (2.5 mm posterior, and 0.5 mm lateral, to Bregma) with IFNγ (50 ng/ml, 5 μl, Chemicon International, Inc.), IL-4 (20 ng/ml, 5 μl, R&D Systems, UK) or both, and 30 min later these rats were assessed for their ability to sustain LTP in perforant path-granule cell synapses as described previously (1Martin D.S. Lonergan P.E. Boland B. Fogarty M.P. Brady M. Horrobin D.F. Campbell V.A. Lynch M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34239-34246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Briefly, a bipolar-stimulating electrode and a unipolar-recording electrode were stereotaxically positioned in the perforant path (4.4 mm lateral to lambda) and dorsal cell body region of the dentate gyrus (3.9 mm posterior, and 2.5 mm lateral, to Bregma), respectively. Test shocks were delivered at 30-s intervals, and recorded for 10 min before and 45 min after tetanic stimulation. The stimulation paradigm used involved delivery of 3 trains of stimuli (250 Hz for 200 ms) with an intertrain interval of 30 s, which has been shown to induce saturable LTP in perforant path-granule cell synapses in young adult rats (18Lynch M.A. Errington M.L. Bliss T.V. Neurosci. Lett. 1985; 62: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); this stimulation paradigm has revealed a deficit in LTP in aged rats. At the end of the recording period, rats were killed by decapitation, the brains were rapidly removed, and the hippocampus was dissected. One-third of the hippocampus was flash-frozen in liquid N2 for later analysis of mRNA (see below), and slices (350 × 350 μm) were prepared from the rest of the tissue using a McIlwain tissue chopper. These slices were stored in Krebs buffer containing CaCl2 (1.13 mm) and 10% Me2SO at –80 °C as previously described (1Martin D.S. Lonergan P.E. Boland B. Fogarty M.P. Brady M. Horrobin D.F.

Cortical tissue was similarly prepared and stored for later analysis of cholesterol. Analysis of IL-1β, IFN-γ, and IL-4—The concentrations of IL-1β, IFNγ, and IL-4 were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R&D Systems, UK) in the stored hippocampal slices prepared from rats (2Nolan Y. Maher F.O. Martin D.S. Clarke R.M. Brady M.T. Bolton A.E. Mills K.H. Lynch M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9354-9362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). IFNγ and IL-1β concentrations were also assessed in tissue prepared from wild-type and IL-4–/– mice. Slices were thawed, rinsed, homogenized, and equalized for protein (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216377) Google Scholar). For analysis of rat tissue the following antibodies were used to coat 96-well plates; 1.0 μg/ml goat anti-rat IL-1β antibody (R&D Systems, UK), or 2.0 μg/ml mouse anti-rat IFNγ antibody, or 2.0 μg/ml mouse anti-rat IL-4 antibody (diluted in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.3). For analysis of tissue prepared from mice, 1.25 μg/ml goat anti-mouse IFNγ antibody (BIOSOURCE, UK) or 4 μg/ml goat anti-mouse IL-1β antibody (R&D Systems, UK) were used. Plates were incubated overnight at room temperature, washed, blocked, and incubated with standards (0–1000 pg/ml) or samples for 2 h at room temperature. Wells were washed and incubated with the following antibodies: 350 ng/ml biotinylated goat anti-rat antibody for IL-1β, 150 ng/ml biotinylated goat anti-rat antibody for IFNγ, or 50 ng/ml biotinylated goat antirat antibody for IL-4, each diluted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% BSA and 2% normal goat serum, or 100 ng/ml biotinylated goat anti-mouse IL-1β antibody, and 125 ng/ml biotinylated goat anti-mouse IFNγ antibody (R&D Systems, UK). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (1:200) and substrate solution (1:1 mixture of H2O2 and tetramethylbenzidine) were added, incubation continued in the dark for 20–30 min, and the reaction was stopped using 1 m H2SO4. Absorbance was read at 450 nm, and values were corrected for protein in the case of homogenates and expressed as picograms/mg of protein. Analysis of Expression of MHCII—We assessed OX6 mRNA expression as an indicator of MHCII. Total RNA was extracted from hippocampal tissue using TRI reagent (Sigma), reverse transcription-PCR was undertaken (5Minogue A.M. Schmid A.W. Fogarty M.P. Moore A.C. Campbell V.A. Herron C.E. Lynch M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27971-27980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and cDNA synthesis was performed on 1 μg of total RNA using oligo(dT) primers (Superscript reverse transcriptase; Invitrogen Ltd., UK). Equal amounts of cDNA were used for PCR amplification for a total of 30 cycles, and the following sequences of primers were used: upstream 5′-CAG TCA CAG AAG GCG TTT ATG-3′; downstream, 5′-TGC AGC ATC TGA CAG CAG GA-3′; and for rat β-actin mRNA expression: upstream, 5′-AGA AGA GCT ATG AGC TGC CTG AGG-3′; downstream, 5′-CTT CTG CAT CCT GTC AGC GAT GC-3′. The cycling conditions were 95 °C for 300 s, 65 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 120 s. The reaction was stopped by a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. These primers generated OX-6 PCR products at 245 bp and β-actin PCR products at 250 bp. Equal volumes of PCR product from each sample were loaded onto 1.5% agarose gels, and bands were separated by application of 90 V, photographed, and quantified using densitometry. The target genes were normalized to β-actin mRNA expression (i.e. the housekeeping gene). No change in β-actin mRNA was observed with treatment. Western Immunoblot Analysis of JNK, c-Jun, p38, and NFκB—Phosphorylation of JNK, c-Jun, p38, and NFκB was analyzed in samples prepared from hippocampal tissue as described for analysis of JNK phosphorylation (20Vereker E. O'Donnell E. Lynch M.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6811-6819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); JNK phosphorylation was assessed in nuclear and cytosolic fractions and c-Jun phosphorylation, p38, and NFκB activation in nuclear fractions only. The cytosolic fraction was prepared by homogenizing hippocampal slices in lysis buffer (composition in mm: 20 HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 KCl, 1.5 MgCl2, 1 EDTA, 1 EGTA, 1 dithiothreitol, 0.1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, containing pepstatin A (5 μg/ml), leupeptin (2 μg/ml), and aprotinin (2 μg/ml)), incubating for 20 min on ice, and centrifuging (15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). The supernatant (i.e. cytosolic fraction) was suspended in sample buffer (Tris-HCl, 150 mm, pH 6.8; glycerol 10% v/v; SDS, 4% w/v; β-mercaptoethanol, 5% v/v; bromphenol blue, 0.002% w/v) to a final concentration of 300 μg/ml, boiled for 3 min, and loaded (10 μg/lane) onto 10% SDS gels. The nuclear fraction was prepared by homogenizing hippocampal slices in Krebs solution containing 2 mm CaCl2, incubating for 15 min on ice in permeabilization buffer (composition: 70 mm KCl, 250 mm sucrose, 137 mm NaCl, 4.5 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 200 μg/ml digitonin) and centrifuging (600 × g for 15 min at 4 °C). The pellet (i.e. nuclear fraction) was resuspended in sample buffer (Tris-HCl, 150 mm, pH 6.8; glycerol 10% v/v; SDS, 4% w/v; β-mercaptoethanol, 5% v/v; bromphenol blue, 0.002% w/v) to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml, boiled for 3 min, and loaded onto 10% SDS gels. All tissue samples were equalized for protein concentration, and 10-μl aliquots (1 mg/ml) were added to sample buffer (5 μl; Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm, pH 6.8; glycerol, 10%; SDS, 10%; β-mercaptoethanol, 5%; bromphenol blue, 0.05% w/v), boiled for 5 min, and loaded onto 10% SDS gels. Proteins were separated by application of a 30-mA constant current for 25–30 min, transferred onto nitrocellulose strips (225 mA for 75 min), and immunoblotted with the appropriate antibody. To assess JNK activity, proteins were immunoblotted with an antibody that specifically targets phosphorylated JNK (1:400 in Tris-buffered saline (TBS)-Tween (0.05% Tween-20) containing 0.1% BSA; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 2 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive bands were detected using peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) and Super Signal chemiluminescence (Pierce). To assess phosphorylation of c-Jun, nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in TBS containing 5% BSA overnight at 4 °C and immunoblotted with a mouse monoclonal antibody (1:300 dilution in phosphate-buffered saline-Tween containing 2% nonfat dried milk, Cell Signaling) for 2 h at room temperature. In the case of p38, nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in 2% BSA in TBS overnight at 4 °C and immunoblotted with a mouse monoclonal antibody (1:200 dilution in TBS-Tween containing 0.1% BSA, Sigma) for 2 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive bands were detected using peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) and Super Signal chemiluminescence (Pierce). In the case of NFκB, nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in 5% BSA in TBS overnight at 4 °C and immunoblotted with a rabbit monoclonal antibody (1:300 dilution in TBS-Tween containing 0.1% BSA, Cell Signaling Technology) for 2 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive bands were detected using peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) and Super Signal chemiluminescence (Pierce). Blots were stripped (Reblot Plus, Chemicon) and reprobed with an anti-actin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); in the case of JNK, c-Jun, and NFκB, antibodies raised against the unphosphorylated form were used to confirm equal loading. Cholesterol Analysis—NMR spectra were recorded at room temperature on a JEOL ECA600 NMR spectrometer operating at 600-Hz proton frequency. The spectra were acquired in the Fourier transformation mode with 32 K data points, using a 45° pulse width. The residual monodeuterated water signal at ∼4.7 ppm was suppressed by the application of a continuous and selective secondary irradiation during the relaxation delay. Chemical shifts were referenced to the residual methanol peak at 3.31 ppm. Spectral assignments were made by reference to data already in the literature (21Adosraku R.K. Choi G.T.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1487: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cholesterol was identified and quantified by its characteristic C-18 methyl singlet at 0.68 ppm. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed, as appropriate, using either Student's t test for independent means or a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post hoc Student Newman-Keuls test to determine which conditions were significantly different from each other. Data are expressed as means with standard errors and deemed statistically significant when p < 0.05. Atorvastatin Attenuates LPS-induced Inflammatory Changes—MHCII mRNA expression and IL-1β concentration were significantly increased in hippocampal tissue prepared from LPS-injected rats, compared with controls (*, p < 0.05, ANOVA, Fig. 1, a and b); both changes were attenuated in hippocampal tissue prepared from atorvastatin-treated rats so that mean values were similar in tissue prepared from control-treated rats and LPS-treated rats, which received atorvastatin. Interaction of IL-1β with its receptor IL-1RI has been shown to trigger sequential activation of JNK and c-Jun (4Lonergan P.E. Martin D.S. Horrobin D.F. Lynch M.A. J.

Expression of phosphorylated JNK (pJNK, expressed as a ratio of pJNK to total JNK in cytosolic and nuclear fractions) and p38 (expressed in a cytosolic fraction as a ratio of phosphorylated p38 (p-p38) to actin) were significantly increased in tissue prepared from LPS-treated, compared with control-treated, rats (*, p < 0.05, ANOVA, Fig. 1, c and d, and Fig. 2a). These increases were attenuated in LPS-treated rats that received atorvastatin so that the mean values in these groups were similar to those in controls and, in the case of cytosolic pJNK, significantly reduced compared with the value in tissue prepared from LPS-treated rats (+, p < 0.05, ANOVA). Expression of total JNK and actin was unchanged with treatment. In parallel with these changes, activation of c-Jun (expressed as a ratio of c-Jun phosphorylated on serine 63 or serine 73 to c-Jun) and NFκB (expressed as a ratio of phosphorylated NFκ B to total NFκB) in nuclear fractions obtained from the same tissue, were significantly increased in LPS-treated, compared with control, rats (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01, ANOVA, Figs. 1e, 1f, and 2b). These increases were attenuated in LPS-treated rats that received atorvastatin so that the mean values in these groups were similar to those in controls, and, in the case of NFkB, significantly decreased compared with the value in tissue prepared from LPS-treated rats (++, p < 0.01, ANOVA). Expression of unphosphorylated NFκB was unchanged with treatment.FIGURE 2Atorvastatin abrogates the LPS-induced activation of p38 and NFκB. LPS injection (100 μg/kg, intraperitoneally) significantly increased activation of p38 (a) and NFκ B(b) in hippocampal tissue (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, ANOVA, n = 5 or 6). These effects were blocked in tissue prepared from animals treated orally with atorvastatin (5 mg/kg/day) for 3 weeks (++, p < 0.01, ANOVA, versus LPS alone). Atorvastatin exerted no significant effect in saline-treated rats. Mean arbitrary values (±S.E.) obtained from densitometric analysis are presented, and sample blots are shown; in all cases blots were stripped and reprobed with actin or total NFκB to confirm equal loading of proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Atorvastatin Attenuates the LPS-induced Inhibition of LTP—It has been consistently shown that, when hippocampal IL-1β concentration is increased, LTP is impaired and that inhibition of JNK (3Barry C.E. Nolan Y. Clarke R.M. Lynch A. Lynch M.A. J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and p38 (23Kelly A. Vereker E. Nolan Y. Brady M. Barry C. Loscher C.E. Mills K.H.

The present results support these observations and show that, in parallel with the increases in IL-1β concentration and JNK and p38 activation, LTP is impaired in LPS-treated animals. Thus, high frequency stimulation of the perforant path led to an immediate and sustained increase in population EPSP slope in control rats, whereas LTP was markedly attenuated in rats injected with LPS (p < 0.001, ANOVA, Fig. 3a). There was a significant decrease in the mean percentage change in population EPSP slope in the last 10 min of the experiment compared with the mean value in the 5 min prior to stimulation in the LPS-treated group (84.46 ± 0.62), compared with the controls (123.3 ± 1.16; **, p < 0.01, ANOVA, Fig. 3b). Mean population EPSP slope was significantly decreased in rats that received atorvastatin (109.6 ± 0.86; *, p < 0.05, ANOVA, Fig. 3b) compared with controls, and atorvastatin blocked the inhibitory effect of LPS on LTP so that the mean percentage change in EPSP slope in the last 10 min of the experiment was significantly greater in LPS-treated animals that received atorvastatin (137.0 ± 1.09) compared with controls (**, p < 0.01, ANOVA) or animals that received LPS (++, p < 0.01, ANOVA). Atorvastatin Also Attenuates the LPS-induced Increase in IFNγ—These data suggest that LPS-induced microglial activation may trigger the cascade of events leading to inhibition of LTP and that atorvastatin exerts its effects, because it down-regulates microglial activation or the trigger leading to activation of microglia. Because previous evidence indicated that IFNγ triggers activation of microglia in vitro (24Nguyen V.T. Benveniste E.N. J. Immunol. 2000; 165:"
https://openalex.org/W2066642217,"Development of immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells from B cells is a tightly regulated process controlled by the action of a number of transcription factors. In particular, the transcription factor Blimp-1 is a key positive regulator of plasmacytic differentiation via its ability to suppress expression of genes involved in the mature B cell program. The transcription factor Ets-1 is a negative regulator of plasmacytic differentiation, as indicated by the development of increased numbers of IgM-secreting plasma cells in Ets-1 knock-out mice. We have previously shown that Ets-1-deficient B cells undergo enhanced differentiation into IgM-secreting plasma cells in response to Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) signaling. We now explore the mechanism by which Ets-1 limits differentiation downstream of TLR9. Our results indicate that Ets-1 physically interacts with Blimp-1, which leads to a block in Blimp-1 DNA binding activity and a reduction in the ability of Blimp-1 to repress target genes without interfering with Blimp-1 protein levels. In addition, we show that Ets-1 induces the expression of several target genes that are repressed by Blimp-1, including Pax-5. These results reveal a previously unknown mechanism for the control of Blimp-1 activity by Ets-1 and suggest that expression of Ets-1 must be down-regulated before plasmacytic differentiation can occur.

The generation of plasma cells, the terminally differentiated effector cells of the B cell lineage, is one of the critical events in an immune response. In vitro, B cell differentiation into plasma cells can be efficiently induced by stimuli that trigger the activation of certain Toll-like receptors (TLR). 2The abbreviations used are:TLRToll-like receptorCpGcytosine-phosphate-guanineODNoligodeoxynucleotideGFPgreen fluorescent proteinEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayCMVcytomegalovirusHAhemagglutininGSTglutathione S-transferaseELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayBSAPB cell-specific activator protein. For example, lipopolysaccharide, which triggers TLR4, and unmethylated CpG containing DNA, which triggers TLR9, are effective stimuli to induce plasma cell differentiation in vitro. In addition, TLR activation has been shown to play a role in supporting optimal B cell differentiation into immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells in vivo (1Pasare C. Medzhitov R.

A complex transcriptional program that includes both positive and negative regulators dictates B cell differentiation into plasma cells. The transcription factors Blimp-1, Irf-4, and Xbp-1 serve as positive regulators by facilitating plasma cell formation and immunoglobulin secretion (4Turner Jr., C.A. Mack D.H. Davis M.M.

Immunol. 2006; 7: 773-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). However, Blimp-1 is considered the master regulator of this process, as ectopic expression of Blimp-1 in mature B cells is sufficient to drive plasmacytic differentiation (4Turner Jr., C.A. Mack D.H. Davis M.M. Cell. 1994; 77: 297-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 7Schliephake D.E. Schimpl A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 268-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Moreover, mice harboring a B cell-specific deletion of Blimp-1 exhibit severe defects in plasma cell formation and immunoglobulin secretion (8Shapiro-Shelef M. Lin K.I. McHeyzer-Williams L.J. Liao J.

Blimp-1 functions as a master regulator by repressing key genes involved in the mature B cell program, in germinal center reactions, and in cell cycle progression (10Lin Y. Wong K. Calame K.

Together, these changes drive terminal differentiation of B cells into immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells. Although induction of Blimp-1 is necessary for plasmacytic differentiation, what is equally important is the suppression or inactivation of Blimp-1 in the mature B cell lineage until the appropriate signals are encountered for terminal differentiation. The suppression/inactivation of Blimp-1 is critical because expression of Blimp-1 in immature B cells can induce apoptosis (10Lin Y. Wong K. Calame K. Science. 1997; 276: 596-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 15Messika E.J. Lu P.S. Sung Y.J. Yao T. Chi J.T. Chien Y.H. Davis M.M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 515-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), whereas expression of Blimp-1 in mature B cells can block the germinal center reaction by interfering with Bcl-6 function (14Shaffer A.L. Lin K.I. Kuo T.C. Yu X. Hurt E.M. Rosenwald A. Giltnane J.M. Yang L. Zhao H. Calame K. Staudt L.M. Immunity. 2002; 17: 51-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Moreover, premature Blimp-1 expression could potentially lead to inefficient immune responses or promote secretion of autoantibodies. Hence, mechanisms must be in place to ensure that Blimp-1 activity is properly regulated and occurs only at the appropriate stage of B cell differentiation. The transcription factors Bcl-6 and Bach-2 are known to repress Blimp-1 expression in cells committed to a germinal center fate (16Tunyaplin C. Shaffer A.L. Angelin-Duclos C.D. Yu X. Staudt L.M.

Chem. 2006; 281: 38226-38234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In addition, the transcription factor Pax-5 can repress Blimp-1 expression in mature B cells, although it is not clear whether this is due to direct binding to the Blimp-1 gene or via up-regulation of Bcl-6 (18Clements J.L. John S.A. Garrett-Sinha L.A. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 19Nera K.P. Kohonen P. Narvi E. Peippo A. Mustonen L. Terho P. Koskela K. Buerstedde J.M. Lassila O. Immunity. 2006; 24: 283-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Evidence also suggests that the transcription factor Ets-1 may play a key role in regulating Blimp-1 activity, since mice lacking Ets-1 exhibit a strikingly increased number of IgM-secreting plasma cells in their lymphoid organs (20Bories J.C. Willerford D.M. Grevin D. Davidson L. Camus A. Martin P. Stehelin D. Alt F.W. Nature. 1995; 377: 635-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 21Barton K. Muthusamy N. Fischer C. Ting C.N. Walunas T.L. Lanier L.L. Leiden J.M. Immunity. 1998; 9: 555-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Moreover, B cells lacking Ets-1 undergo enhanced differentiation into IgM-secreting plasma cells when cultured in the presence of a synthetic TLR9 ligand (CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) (22Wang D. John S.A. Clements J.L. Percy D.H. Barton K.P. Garrett-Sinha L.A. Int. Immunol. 2005; 17: 1179-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which Ets-1 regulates the development of IgM-secreting plasma cells is unknown but likely involves modulating the expression or activity of genes that govern the plasma cell fate. Interestingly, several Ets proteins can direct lineage-commitment decisions via their ability to form protein-protein complexes with key lineage-specific transcription factors, leading to inactivation of the function of those transcription factors. For instance, the Ets protein PU.1 physically interacts with the erythroid-specific transcription factor GATA-1 to block its activity and prevent erythrocyte terminal differentiation (23Rekhtman N. Radparvar F. Evans T. Skoultchi A.I. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1398-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 24Zhang P. Behre G. Pan J. Iwama A. Wara-Aswapati N. Radomska H.S. Auron P.E.

Likewise, another Ets protein, Fli-1, interacts with the erythroid-specific transcription factor EKLF to regulate its function and limit terminal differentiation of erythroid cells (27Starck J. Cohet N. Gonnet C. Sarrazin S. Doubeikovskaia Z. Doubeikovski A. Verger A. Duterque-Coquillaud M. Morle F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1390-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Ets factor MEF (myeloid Elf-1-like factor) interacts with the Runx-2 transcription factor to inhibit its activity and regulate bone development (28Kim Y.J. Kim B.G. Lee S.J. Lee H.K. Lee S.H. Ryoo H.M. Cho J.Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 2007; 211: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We investigated whether Ets-1 might restrain commitment to B cell terminal differentiation in a similar manner by binding to and inactivating the key transcription factor regulating this developmental decision Blimp-1. Here, we present evidence that Ets-1 has a B cell-intrinsic role in regulating plasmacytic differentiation downstream of TLR9 and that this is mediated at least in part by a functional antagonism between Ets-1 and Blimp-1. This antagonism is brought about by direct binding of Ets-1 to Blimp-1, which inhibits the ability of Blimp-1 to bind to its target sites in DNA. The mechanism of Ets-1 action is functionally distinct from the mechanisms employed by other negative regulators of Blimp-1 activity (Bcl-6, Pax5, and Bach-2). In addition to its ability to directly bind to Blimp-1 and interfere with its function, we provide evidence that Ets-1 also up-regulates the expression of several target genes, which are known to be repressed by Blimp-1. Among the genes up-regulated by Ets-1 is Pax5, which encodes a transcription factor required to specify the mature B cell fate. Together, our data indicate that Ets-1 employs two separate and complementary modes of action to control B cell differentiation into plasma cells. Plasmids—The MIGR1 retroviral vector has been previously described (29Pear W.S. Miller J.P. Xu L. Pui J.C. Soffer B. Quackenbush R.C. Pendergast A.M. Bronson R. Aster J.C. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Blood. 1998; 92: 3780-3792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids derived from the MIGR1 vector generate bicistronic messages encoding a cDNA of interest as well as a marker gene GFP. Full-length or deleted versions of the mouse Ets-1 cDNA were subcloned into MIGR1. MIGR1 and its derivatives were co-transfected into a viral packaging cell line along with the plasmid pCL-Eco (a gift of Dr. Rodney DeKoter, University of Cincinnati), which harbors the viral gag, pol, and env genes under the control of the CMV promoter (30Naviaux R.K. Costanzi E. Haas M. Verma I.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5701-5705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To generate a Blimp-1 construct for in vitro transcription/translation, an HA-tagged version of Blimp-1 was cloned into the pCITE-4a vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). Plasmids encoding glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusions of Ets-1, Ets-2, or PU.1 were generated by PCR amplification of the respective cDNAs (or portions thereof) using appropriate primers followed by cloning into pGEX vectors (GE Healthcare). All PCR products were verified by DNA sequencing. The plasmid pCMV-HA-Ets-1, harboring the full-length murine Ets-1 cDNA fused in-frame to an HA tag at the N terminus, has been previously described (22Wang D. John S.A. Clements J.L. Percy D.H. Barton K.P. Garrett-Sinha L.A. Int. Immunol. 2005; 17: 1179-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). A deleted version of Ets-1 lacking the Ets domain (amino acids 331-415) was amplified from a GST vector and subcloned into pCMV-HA to generate pCMV-HA Ets1 Δ331-415. The Blimp-1 expression plasmid (pcDNA3.1 Blimp-1) containing a full-length murine Blimp-1 cDNA fused in-frame to a FLAG tag at the C terminus was a gift of Dr. Kathryn Calame (Columbia University, New York). We generated a FLAG-tagged version of Blimp-1 lacking the PEST sequences (Blimp1 Δ350-557) using a PCR mutagenesis protocol. The integrity of the PCR product was verified by sequencing. The plasmid CIITA-luc (containing -545 to +123 bp of promoter III of the human MHC2TA gene (31Piskurich J.F. Wang Y. Linhoff M.W. White L.C. Ting J.P. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 233-240PubMed Google Scholar)) was a gift of Dr. Jenny Ting (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). The plasmid BSAP-Luc (containing -1771 to +50 bp of the murine Pax-5 promoter (32O'Riordan M. Grosschedl R. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 175: 94-103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) was a gift of Dr. Kathryn Calame. The plasmid cMYC-Luc (containing -992 to +148 bp of the murine c-Myc promoter) was generated by PCR amplification of mouse genomic DNA followed by cloning into the pGL3Basic vector. The pCMV-βgal plasmid was used as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Cell Lines—The mature B cell line A20 and the plasmacytoma cell line P3X were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, glutamine, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. The African green monkey kidney cell line Cos-1 and the retroviral packaging cell line Platinum-E were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and glutamine. Platinum-E cells are a derivative of the 293T human embryonic kidney cell line with stably integrated copies of the viral structural genes (gag, pol, and env) driven by the potent EF1α promoter (33Morita S. Kojima T. Kitamura T. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar). Platinum-E cells were a kind gift of Dr. Toshio Kitamura, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan. B Cell Purification and Stimulation—B cells were purified from the spleens of C57BL/6 mice by negative selection against CD43 using a VarioMACS magnetic column and CD43 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). For in vitro differentiation, purified splenic B cells were stimulated with 5-10 μg/ml synthetic TLR9 ligand, CpG ODN 1826 (5′-TCCAGACGTTCCTGACGTT-3′) (Coley Pharmaceuticals, Wellesley, MA), a phosphorothioate containing oligodeoxynucleotide with unmethylated CpG sequences. Western Blot Analysis—Whole cell lysates were prepared at the indicated time points by direct boiling in Laemmli sample buffer or by repeated freeze-thaw cycles in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and a complete protease inhibitor mixture). The samples were subjected to Western blotting, and membranes were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse Ets-1 (either the C-20 or N-276 anti-Ets-1 antibody, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), mouse or rat monoclonal anti-Blimp-1 (clone 3H2-E8, Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO or clone 6D3, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse monoclonal anti-Pax-5 (clone A-11, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or mouse monoclonal anti-β-tubulin (clone KMX-1; Chemicon International, Temecula, CA). Immunofluorescent Staining—Splenic B cells isolated from C57BL/6 wild-type mice were stimulated for 48 h with CpG ODN and harvested onto polylysine-coated slides. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with a rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for Ets-1 (N-276, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and a rat monoclonal antibody specific for Blimp-1 (clone 6D3, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). An anti-rabbit secondary antibody coupled to Alexa-Fluor 568 and an anti-rat secondary antibody coupled to Alexa-Fluor 488 were used to detect Ets-1 and Blimp-1. Images were captured on a Nikon Microphot FXA microscope and analyzed with SPOT software (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI). Purification of GST Fusion Proteins and GST Pulldown Assay—GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells and purified using a standard protocol. Radiolabeled Blimp-1 protein was generated using an in vitro transcription and translation reaction. For the GST pulldown assays, equal amounts of GST fusion proteins were incubated with in vitro transcribed and translated 35S-labeled Blimp-1 in a buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 0.2 mm ZnCl2) followed by incubation with glutathione-Sepharose beads. After washing, the bound proteins were eluted in SDS sample loading buffer, resolved on SDS-PAGE gels, and visualized by autoradiography. Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—Cos-1 cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Sciences) with 250 ng to 1 μg of each plasmid (pCMV-HA-Ets1, pCMV-HA-Ets1 Δ331-415, or pcDNA3.1 Blimp1 Δ350-557). Forty-eight hours later cells were lysed in a buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1 m Na4P2O7, 0.8 mm EDTA, and a complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Sciences)). Supernatants were precleared by incubation with protein-G-agarose beads (Roche Applied Sciences) and then incubated with either a rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody (clone 3F10, Roche Applied Biosciences), a control rat IgG1 antibody (BD Biosciences Pharmingen), a mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (clone M2, Sigma-Aldrich), or a control mouse IgG1 antibody (BD Biosciences Pharmingen). Immunoprecipitates were Western-blotted using anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibodies. For co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous Ets-1 and Blimp-1, B cells were purified from the spleens of C57BL/6 mice and cultured in vitro with 10 μg/ml CpG ODN to induce up-regulation of Blimp-1. After 48 h of culture the cells were resuspended in lysis buffer, and lysates were precleared by incubation with protein G-Sepharose. Ets-1 was immunoprecipitated using a rabbit polyclonal anti-Ets-1 antibody (N-276, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or a control rabbit antibody. Immunoprecipitates were separated on SDS-PAGE gels and Western-blotted with a rat monoclonal anti-Blimp-1 antibody (clone 6D3, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—Whole cell extracts from P3X plasmacytoma cells, and A20 mature B cells were isolated by repeated freeze-thaw cycles in lysis buffer (as described above for Western blotting). For EMSAs, a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing Blimp-1 binding site from the c-Myc promoter (5′-GCGTGAAAGGGAAAGGACTAGCGC-3′) or from the Pax-5 promoter (5′-TCGAGTTTTGGAAAGTGAATCGCTC-3′) was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and used as probe. Binding reactions were carried out in DNA binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 4% Ficoll, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 75 mm KCl) using cell extracts containing ∼10 μg of protein. For competition, P3X extracts were incubated with a 100-fold excess of wild-type or mutant c-Myc oligonucleotides (mutant oligonucleotide 5′-GCGTGACAGGGGCAGGACTAGCGC-3′; mutant bases indicated are in bold type). For supershift assays, P3X extracts were preincubated with 1 μl of Blimp-1 antibody (clone 3H2-E8, Novus Biologicals). Where indicated, equivalent amounts of GST fusion proteins were incubated with P3X extracts for 30 min on ice before the addition of labeled probe. Transfection and Reporter Assays—A20 cells were transfected by electroporation as described previously (34Grund E.M. Muise-Helmericks R.C. J. Immunol. Methods. 2005; 296: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Transfections included 5 μg of luciferase reporter construct, 0.25 μg of an internal control (pCMV-βgal), 1 or 4 μg of the Blimp-1 expression vector (pCDNA3.1 Blimp-1), and varying concentrations of the Ets-1 expression vector (pCMV-HA-Ets1). Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured 48 h post-transfection using the Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) and the Galacto-Light Plus β-Galactosidase Reporter Gene Assay System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Values are reported as ratios of luciferase to β-galactosidase. Retroviral Production and Transduction—For production of retrovirus, the Platinum-E packaging cell line was transfected with various retroviral expression plasmids along with the pCL-Eco plasmid using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Biosciences). Retroviral supernatants were used to infect 3 × 106 B cells, purified from the spleen of C57BL/6 mice, and stimulated with 5 μg/ml CpG ODN. Two days after infection, the GFP-positive population was sorted out using FACsAria Cell Sorter (BD Biosciences Immunocytometry Systems). For some experiments GFPlo and GFPhi populations were independently sorted. Proliferation of sorted GFP+ virally infected cells was measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation. Flow Cytometry—Retrovirus-transduced cells were stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse Syndecan-1 (CD138) (BD Biosciences Pharmingen). Samples were analyzed on a BD Biosciences Immunocytometry Systems FACSCalibur flow cytometer, and the resulting data were evaluated using FlowJo software (TreeStar Inc, Ashland, OR). ELISA—Equivalent numbers of sorted GFP-positive cells from the retrovirally transduced populations were resuspended in media containing 10 μg/ml CpG ODN. After 24 or 48 h, supernatants were harvested, and ELISA was carried out. Purified mouse IgM (clone11E10, Southern Biotech) was used for generating a standard curve. Ets-1 Represses B Cell Terminal Differentiation in a B Cell-intrinsic Fashion—Mice deficient in the Ets-1 protein exhibit an increased number of IgM-secreting plasma cells (20Bories J.C.

Walunas T.L. Lanier L.L. Leiden J.M. Immunity. 1998; 9: 555-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). We previously showed that splenic B cells isolated from Ets-1 knock-out mice (designated Ets-1p/p mice) undergo enhanced differentiation into IgM-secreting cells when they are cultured in the presence of a synthetic TLR9 ligand (CpG ODN) (22Wang D. John S.A. Clements J.L. Percy D.H. Barton K.P. Garrett-Sinha L.A. Int. Immunol. 2005; 17: 1179-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible B cell-intrinsic role for Ets-1 in regulating differentiation. To further explore the B cell-intrinsic requirement for Ets-1 in regulating plasma cell development in response to TLR9, we have examined the effect of enforced expression of Ets-1 in cultures of wild-type B cells induced to undergo differentiation by the addition of CpG ODN. To drive high level, constitutive expression of Ets-1, we generated a retroviral construct encoding the full-length murine Ets-1 cDNA followed by an internal ribosomal entry site and GFP (MIGR1 Ets1, Fig. 1A). MIGR1-Ets1 virus or the empty MIGR1 virus were used to infect purified, primary splenic B cells stimulated overnight with CpG ODN to induce cell cycle progression. As expected, cells harboring MIGR1-Ets1 exhibited substantially higher expression of Ets-1 than cells harboring the control virus (Fig. 1B). After infection with retrovirus, B cells were returned to culture with CpG ODN, which induces differentiation into IgM-secreting plasma cells. Forty-eight hours later the status of plasmacytic differentiation in each population was assessed by staining for CD138 (Syndecan-1), a marker expressed at high levels on plasma cells. Cells infected with MIGR1-Ets1 gave rise to 4-5-fold fewer GFP+CD138hi plasma cells than did cells infected with the control virus (Fig. 1C), indicating reduced levels of terminal differentiation. Similar results were obtained with B cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide to induce plasmacytic differentiation (supplemental Fig. S1). To further characterize differentiation of these cells, we sorted GFP-positive cells from each population at 48 h after retroviral transduction, cultured them in the presence of CpG ODN, and measured IgM secretion after an additional 48 h (Fig. 1D). Enforced expression of high levels of Ets-1 strongly suppressed IgM secretion, indicating a specific block to plasmacytic differentiation. The alterations in CD138hi cell numbers and IgM secretion could not be explained by differential proliferation, as the two populations of cells showed very similar levels of [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 1E). In addition, forward and side scatter profiles of flow-sorted virally infected cells demonstrated similar percentages of dead cells, suggesting that Ets-1 did not have a major influence on the rate of B cell survival either (data not shown). To determine whether lower levels of Ets-1 expression (which may be more physiologically relevant) could inhibit differentiation to IgM-secreting plasma cells, we sorted out GFPlo and GFPhi populations from retrovirally infected cells. Because Ets-1 and GFP are expressed from a bicistronic mRNA, it was expected that the level of Ets-1 expression would be correlated with the level of GFP expression. This was confirmed by Western blotting for Ets-1 in sorted GFPhi and GFPlo populations (data not shown). IgM secretion from cultures of GFPhi- and GFPlo-sorted B cells was measured (Fig. 1F), which indicated that Ets-1 repressed IgM secretion in a dose-dependent fashion. Thus, even a low level of Ets-1 is sufficient to partially suppress plasmacytic differentiation, whereas high levels of Ets-1 can almost completely suppress such differentiation. Together, these experiments demonstrate that Ets-1 plays a cell-intrinsic role in inhibiting B cell terminal differentiation in response to a synthetic TLR9 ligand. Ets-1 and Blimp-1 Exhibit an Inverse Expression Pattern during B Cell Differentiation—Our experiments support the notion that Ets-1 acts as a negative regulator of plasmacytic differentiation in a B cell-intrinsic fashion. This observation suggests that there may be a requirement for down-regulation of Ets-1 as B cells commit to a plasma cell program. If so, then Ets-1 levels should decrease as B cells progress through differentiation. To test this hypothesis, we examined the expression pattern of Ets-1 in primary B cells stimulated with CpG ODN to induce plasma cell development. Ets-1 expression was high in freshly isolated splenic B cells (day 0 in Fig. 2A) and remained high until day 2 of culture, after which expression declined significantly. In contrast, Blimp-1 was undetectable in unstimulated, purified splenic B cells but was up-regulated in response to CpG ODN beginning at day 2. The Western blot results described above were obtained with mixed populations of cells representing mainly activated B cells (B cell blasts) with a minority of cells that had progressed to plasmablasts and fully differentiated plasma cells. Although we detected a reciprocal expression pattern for Ets-1 and Blimp-1 in these mixed populations,"
https://openalex.org/W2023981044,"SARS-CoV 3C-like protease (3CL(pro)) is an attractive target for anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) drug discovery, and its dimerization has been extensively proved to be indispensable for enzymatic activity. However, the reason why the dissociated monomer is inactive still remains unclear due to the absence of the monomer structure. In this study, we showed that mutation of the dimer-interface residue Gly-11 to alanine entirely abolished the activity of SARS-CoV 3CL(pro). Subsequently, we determined the crystal structure of this mutant and discovered a complete crystallographic dimer dissociation of SARS-CoV 3CL(pro). The mutation might shorten the alpha-helix A' of domain I and cause a mis-oriented N-terminal finger that could not correctly squeeze into the pocket of another monomer during dimerization, thus destabilizing the dimer structure. Several structural features essential for catalysis and substrate recognition are severely impaired in the G11A monomer. Moreover, domain III rotates dramatically against the chymotrypsin fold compared with the dimer, from which we proposed a putative dimerization model for SARS-CoV 3CL(pro). As the first reported monomer structure for SARS-CoV 3CL(pro), the crystal structure of G11A mutant might provide insight into the dimerization mechanism of the protease and supply direct structural evidence for the incompetence of the dissociated monomer."
https://openalex.org/W2043793978,"The SIR2 homologues HST3 and HST4 have been implicated in maintenance of genome integrity in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We find that Hst3 has NAD-dependent histone deacetylase activity in vitro and that it functions during S phase to deacetylate the core domain of histone H3 at lysine 56 (H3K56). In response to genotoxic stress, Hst3 undergoes rapid Mec1-dependent phosphorylation and is targeted for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, thus providing a mechanism for the previously observed checkpoint-dependent accumulation of Ac-H3K56 at sites of DNA damage. Loss of Hst3-mediated regulation of H3K56 acetylation results in a defect in the S phase DNA damage checkpoint. The pathway that regulates H3K56 acetylation acts in parallel with the Rad9 pathway to transmit a DNA damage signal from Mec1 to Rad53. We also observe that loss of Hst3 function impairs sister chromatid cohesion (SCC). Both S phase checkpoint and SCC defects are phenocopied by H3K56 point mutants.

In the presence of DNA damage, persistent checkpoint-dependent H3K56 acetylation suggested an interplay between classical DNA damage checkpoint proteins (e.g. Mec1) and regulators of H3K56 acetylation.In response to genotoxic stress, Mec1, acting as a DNA damage sensor, activates the DNA damage response network by phosphorylating Rad53. Rad9 serves as an adaptor (12Sweeney F.D. Yang F. Chi A. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Durocher D. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1364-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) that facilitates Mec1-mediated phosphorylation of Rad53 throughout the cell cycle. In addition, and specifically during S phase, Mec1 is capable of efficiently phosphorylating Rad53 in a RAD9-independent fashion (13Foss E.J. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 2000; 65: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 14Foss E.J. Genetics. 2001; 157: 567-577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of Mec1 to transmit a DNA damage signal during S phase in the absence of RAD9 depends on several genes (e.g. TOF1, CSM3, and MRC1) that constitute an S phase-specific branch of the DNA damage response network (15Branzei D. Foiani M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 568-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In addition to DNA damage signal transduction from Mec1 to Rad53, the members of the S phase-specific branch of the DNA damage response network play a separate role in ensuring the stability of the stalled replication forks (16Calzada A.

Their role in SCC appears to be distinct from DNA damage signaling, because mec1 mutants, although completely deficient in DNA damage-induced signal transduction, have intact SCC (19Warren C.D.

S phase checkpoint proteins have been found to travel with the replication forks; in their absence, replication forks are prone to collapse and breakage (15Branzei D. Foiani M. Curr. Opin.

However, the published studies have not determined how H3K56 regulation contributes to genome stability. In this paper, we report that Hst3 has NAD-dependent deacetylase activity in vitro, and we confirm Hst3 functions in vivo during S phase as an Ac-H3K56 deacetylase. Furthermore, we show that the Hst3 protein level is regulated by Mec1-dependent proteolysis during genotoxic stress. Lack of Hst3-mediated regulation of H3K56 generates a defect in the DNA damage signal transduction from Mec1 to Rad53, increases formation of foci containing endogenous DNA damage during S phase, and impairs SCC. These observations suggest Hst3 and H3K56 acetylation safeguard genome stability by participating in the S phase-specific branch of the DNA damage response pathway.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Media and Strains—Yeast strains were grown in synthetic complete medium (SC) or selective synthetic drop-out medium containing 2% glucose or 2% galactose when mentioned. The yeast strains used in this study are listed in the supplemental materials (supplemental Table 1).Plasmid Construction and Mutagenesis—The single Hst3 mutations F72A, N152A, D154A, and H187A were introduced into pRS414-HST3 by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuickChange kit (Stratagene). The glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Hst3 truncated (aa 46-377) was generated by PCR using a5′-primer containing an EcoRI site (5′-GCCGAATTCACCAAGCAGTTGAGCAGATCTAGG) and a 3′-primer containing a XhoI site (5′-CCGCTCGAGTGAGTCTTTTTGGGCCTTCATTTGC). The PCR fragment was inserted between the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pGEX4-T1 (Amersham Biosciences). All constructs were confirmed by PCR-based sequencing.Cell Cycle Synchronization—For G1 arrest experiments, cultures were grown at 30 °C to logarithmic phase and arrested with α factor (Zymo Research) at a final concentration of 5 μm. Cultures were incubated with α factor until at least 95% of the cells were G1-arrested. For G2/M arrest experiments, cells were arrested with 15 μg/ml nocodazole. Cells were released from α factor or nocodazole arrest into rich medium, and samples were taken at the indicated time points.DNA Damage Sensitivity Assay—5-Fold serial dilutions of yeast cells were plated on rich media containing the indicated concentration of either HU or methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). Plates were photographed after 3-4 days of growth at 30 °C. For MMS treatment in liquid culture, cells were grown to logarithmic phase, harvested, and resuspended in rich media containing 0.032% MMS.Flow Cytometry—Cells were washed with distilled H2O, fixed in 80% ethanol at 4 °C, and prepared using Sytox Green for DNA staining. Position in the cell cycle was assessed by flow cytometry analysis of DNA content. The DNA fluorescence was measured by using a FACScanR (BD Biosciences), and data analysis was done using FlowJo software.Sister Chromatid Cohesion Assay—Strains were grown overnight at 30 °C in YEPD containing 0.01% adenine. Cells were diluted to 2.5 × 106 cells/ml in the same medium supplemented with 25 μm CuSO4 to induce GFP expression. The cultures were grown to logarithmic phase at 30 °C and G1-arrested with 2.5 μm α factor, or G2/M-arrested with 15 μg/ml nocodazole. After G1 (α factor) or G2/M arrest (nocodazole), 1 ml of culture was harvested and fixed in 100 μl of paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min. Cells were washed in 1 m KHPO4, 50 mm sorbitol, sonicated, and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy.Western Blot Analysis—Yeast whole cell extracts were prepared using NaOH lysis as described previously (23Kushnirov V.V. Yeast. 2000; 16: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were probed with antibodies against TAP (1:5000 dilution; Open Biosystems), Ac-H3K56 (1:4000 dilution; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), actin (1:400 dilution; Neomarkers), HA (1:1000 dilution; Covance), and ubiquitin (1:5000; UbP4D1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA).Purification of Recombinant Protein and Deacetylation Assay—A histone deacetylase assay was performed using bacterially expressed and purified GST-Hst3 (aa 46-377) and GST-Sir2 proteins as previously described (24Bedalov A.

The GST-Sir2 expression plasmid was a gift from J. Boeke (25Smith J.S. Brachmann C.B. Celic I. Kenna M.A. Muhammad S. Starai V.J. Avalos J.L. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Grubmeyer C. Wolberger C.

The truncated Hst3 (aa 46-377) and Sir2 proteins were expressed as GST fusion proteins from Amersham Biosciences pGEX plasmids in the Escherichia coli DH5-α strain. The cells were grown in LB with 100 mg/liter ampicillin at 37 °C. When the A600 reached 0.8-1.0, 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added. The cells were then induced at room temperature and harvested after 5 h of induction. The purification was performed according to the methods recommended by the manufacturer.A histone deacetylase assay was performed using bacterially expressed and purified proteins as previously described (24Bedalov A. Gatbonton T. Irvine W.P. Gottschling D.E. Simon J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15113-15118Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Histone H4 N-terminal peptide (SGRGKGGKGLGKGGAKRHR; aa 2-20) and histone H3 peptide (GTVALREIRRFQKSTELLIR; aa 44-63) with the N-terminal amino group acetylated during peptide synthesis were acetylated chemically using the HDAC assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology). One microgram of purified truncated Hst3 or Sir2 proteins was incubated with [3H]acetylated histone H3 or H4 peptide (20,000 cpm) with or without 1 mm NAD and with or without 5 mm nicotinamide in a 20-μl reaction containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol overnight at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 μl of 1 n HCl and 0.15 n acetic acid. Released [3H]acetate was extracted with 500 μl of ethyl acetate, and 250 μl of the extract was subjected to scintillation counting.RESULTSHst3 Is an NAD-dependent Deacetylase That Controls H3K56 Acetylation in Vivo—In order to determine whether Hst3 has NAD-dependent deacetylase activity, we expressed and purified a truncated form of Hst3 (Fig. 1A, left) that retained the conserved NAD-dependent deacetylase domain but lacked 45 N- and 70 C-terminal amino acids (retaining aa 46-377) and used a chemically acetylated 20-aa peptide derived from the histone H3 globular domain or a tetraacetylated histone H4 N-terminal peptide as deacetylation substrates. We found that Hst3 deacetylates acetyl-K56 in vitro in an NAD-dependent fashion (Fig. 1A, top right). Hst3 also deacetylated a tetraacetylated histone H4 N-terminal peptide, and this NAD-dependent deacetylase activity was inhibited by nicotinamide (Fig. 1A, bottom right). These results demonstrate that Hst3 is an NAD-dependent histone deacetylase.To determine whether HST3 deacetylates Ac-H3K56 in vivo, we used an antibody that recognizes Ac-H3K56 to monitor this protein modification in wild type and hst3 hst4 mutants in logarithmically growing cells, in α factor-induced G1-arrested cells, and in synchronized cells following release from α factor. We found hyperacetylation of H3K56 in cells lacking HST3 and HST4 in both G1-arrested and logarithmically growing cells (Fig. 1B). After release from α factor, in wild type cells, H3K56 acetylation peaked at 50 min and then decreased, whereas the Ac-H3K56 level in strains lacking HST3 and HST4 was markedly elevated throughout the cell cycle, and its fluctuation was largely abolished (supplemental Figs. 7A and 8A). These results suggest that Hst3 deacetylates H3K56 in vivo. Furthermore, consistent with a requirement for the enzymatic activity of Hst3 in genotoxic stress resistance and Ac-H3K56 deacetylation, we found that point mutants in Hst3 known to abolish enzymatic activity of NAD-dependent deacetylases (27Sauve A.A. Wolberger C. Schramm V.L. Boeke J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 435-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) or treatment with nicotinamide phenocopied the DNA damage sensitivity and H3K56 hyperacetylation of HST3,4 deletion mutants (supplemental Fig. 7, B and C). These findings are consistent with those previously published by other groups (21Celic I. Masumoto H. Griffith W.P. Meluh P. Cotter R.J. Boeke J.D. Verreault A. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1280-1289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 22Maas N.L. Miller K.M. DeFazio L.G. Toczyski D.P. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar).Hst3 level, similarly to Ac-H3K56, fluctuates during the cell cycle, peaking at the end of S phase 60 min after release from α factor, declining in mitosis, and is low in the subsequent G1 phase (supplemental Fig. 7A). In order to determine whether the observed decline of Hst3 following S phase is mediated through proteasome degradation, cells were released into S phase from α factor-induced G1 arrest into medium containing the proteasome inhibitor MG132, and Hst3 level was monitored by Western blot. Proteasome inhibition led to an increase in Hst3 level and the appearance of multiple Hst3 forms with very low mobility, suggestive of polyubiquitylation (Fig. 1C, top). Probing of an Hst3 immunoprecipitate from a log phase culture in the presence of MG132 with a specific anti-ubiquitin antibody confirmed that low mobility forms of Hst3 correspond to polyubiquitylated forms of the protein (Fig. 1C, bottom). These results suggest that ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis contributes to cell cycle fluctuations in Hst3 levels.Hst3 is down-regulated during DNA damage response in an MEC1-dependent fashion. The previously published observation that Ac-K56H3 persists in cells exposed to DNA-damaging agents in a DNA damage checkpoint fashion (2Masumoto H. Hawke D. Kobayashi R. Verreault A. Nature. 2005; 436: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) led us to test the hypothesis that Hst3 level is regulated by genotoxic stress. Wild type and checkpoint-deficient mec1 cells were released from α factor-induced G1 arrest in media with or without 0.032% MMS. Hst3 levels were monitored using Western blots (Fig. 1D) and cell cycle progression by flow cytometry (supplemental Fig. 8A). We observed a marked difference in Hst3 kinetics between cells released in the presence or absence of MMS. Unlike cells released in medium lacking MMS, which showed an increase in Hst3 level that peaked at 60 min, cells released in MMS did not show a significant increase in Hst3 level. Consistent with previous observations (2Masumoto H. Hawke D. Kobayashi R. Verreault A. Nature. 2005; 436: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), MMS treatment was associated with increased levels of Ac-H3K56 (supplemental Fig. 8A). In contrast to wild type cells, MMS treatment did not alter Hst3 kinetics in checkpoint-deficient mec1 cells (Fig. 1D). This result links MEC1 with down-regulation of Hst3 protein in response to DNA damage. Importantly, down-regulation of Hst3 during genotoxic stress is critical for the ability of cells to survive genotoxic stress, since we found that overexpression of Hst3 resulted in MMS sensitivity comparable with that of cells lacking HST3 and HST4 (supplemental Fig. 8, B and C). This result is consistent with earlier reports by Maas et al. (22Maas N.L. Miller K.M. DeFazio L.G. Toczyski D.P. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and underscores the importance of tight control of Hst3 protein level during genotoxic stress.Hst3 Is Subjected to Mec1-dependent Phosphorylation and Ubiquitylation and Proteasome-mediated Degradation during Genotoxic Stress—Our observation that Hst3 is subjected to ubiquitylation and proteasome-mediated degradation led us to investigate the effects of proteasome inhibition on Hst3 level during genotoxic stress. Wild type and checkpoint-deficient mec1 cells were released into S phase from α factor-induced G1 arrest in medium containing MMS and MG132. Hst3 protein level was monitored by Western blot and S phase progression by flow cytometry. We found that proteasome inhibition led to increased Hst3 level during genotoxic stress; furthermore, most of the proteasome inhibitor-stabilized Hst3 had lower mobility relative to Hst3 in logarithmically growing cells (Fig. 2A). Treatment with phosphatase increased the mobility of Hst3 obtained from MMS- and MG132-treated cells (Fig. 2B), demonstrating that the lower mobility forms of Hst3 under genotoxic stress correspond to phosphorylated protein. Thus, proteasome inhibition specifically stabilizes phosphorylated forms of Hst3. The phosphorylated form of Hst3 during genotoxic stress could not be detected without proteasome inhibition, presumably due to its short half-life. Phosphorylation of Hst3 appeared to be reduced in mec1 cells relative to wild type cells (Fig. 2A). Because mec1 cells exposed to MMS still exhibited residual phosphorylation of Hst3, we wanted to determine whether this residual phosphorylation is eliminated in cells lacking both MEC1 and TEL1 (Fig. 2A). Tel1 acts in parallel with Mec1 as a DNA damage sensor, and the two kinases often phosphorylate common substrates (15Branzei D. Foiani M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 568-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Cells lacking both MEC1 and TEL1 exhibit the same degree of deficiency of Hst3 phosphorylation as mec1 cells (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the observed residual phosphorylation is not Mec1/Tel1-dependent. In order to evaluate the possibility that MEC1-independent phosphorylation of Hst3 does not occur in response to DNA damage but instead reflects cell cycle progression over the course of the experiment, we released mec1 cells from α factor arrest into medium containing MG312 only. In this condition, both wild type and mec1 cells exhibited Hst3 phosphorylation comparable with the residual phosphorylation observed in mec1 cells during genotoxic stress (Fig. 2A); thus, MEC1-independent phosphorylation is not a response to genotoxic stress. We conclude that the rapid and almost complete phosphorylation of Hst3 that occurs during genotoxic stress is dependent on MEC1, whereas the residual phosphorylation of Hst3 observed in the absence of MEC1 is independent of genotoxic stress and depends instead on cell cycle progression.FIGURE 2Hst3 is subjected to Mec1-dependent phosphorylation and ubiquitylation and proteasome-mediated degradation during genotoxic stress. A, the strains HST3-TAP sml1 (14611), labeled WT, HST3-TAP mec1 sml1 (14652), labeled Δmec1, and HST3-TAP mec1 tel1 sml1 (14804), labeled Δmec1 Δtel1, were grown to midlog phase, arrested in G1 with α factor, and released in medium containing MG132 with or without 0.032% MMS. Samples were taken at the indicated times and processed for Western blot analysis (left) and flow cytometry (right). Anti-TAP antibodies were used to measure levels of Hst3. Proteasome inhibition prevents genotoxic stress-induced decline in Hst3 level. The arrow points to a lower mobility form of Hst3 that is shown in Fig. 2B to correspond to phosphorylated Hst3. Rapid phosphorylation of Hst3 is dependent on Mec1, whereas the residual phosphorylation is Mec1-independent and reflects cell cycle progression rather than DNA damage response. B, Hst3 is phosphorylated during genotoxic stress. A whole cell lysate from cells treated with MMS and MG132 (80 min time point from Fig. 2A) was prepared under denaturing conditions and was treated with λ-phosphatase with and without phosphatase inhibitor mixture for 30 min. Hst3 mobility was evaluated by Western blotting using anti-TAP antibodies. Phosphatase treatment increases Hst3 mobility. C, Mec1 promotes ubiquitylation of Hst3 during genotoxic stress. The HST3-TAP sml1 strain (14611), labeled WT, and HST3-TAP mec1 sml1 strain (14652), labeled Δmec1, were arrested in G1 with α factor and released into medium containing 0.032% MMS and MG132. Samples were taken at the indicated times and processed for Western blot analysis. The anti-TAP antibody was used to analyze Hst3 level and mobility, and actin was probed as a loading control. The arrow in the upper panel indicates the phosphorylated form of Hst3; the polyubiquitylated forms of Hst3 (polyub Hst3) are indicated in the middle panel. D, genotoxic stress promotes MEC1-dependent proteolysis of Hst3. Logarithmically growing wild type (HST3-TAP sml1, strain 14611) and mec1 cells (HST3-TAP mec1 sml1, strain 4652), were resuspended in medium with or without 0.032% MMS. The samples were collected immediately before (time 0) or at the indicated time points following the addition of cycloheximide (35 μg/ml) and analyzed for Hst3 and actin level. The intensity of the bands corresponding to Hst3 was quantified by densitometry and normalized to actin level, and the time Hst3/action curve was fitted using Prism software to calculate Hst3 half-life with and without MMS (wild type, 8.5 and 3.5 min; mec1, 9 and 8 min with and without MMS, respectively).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Rapid Mec1-dependent phosphorylation of Hst3 during genotoxic stress, coupled with the requirement for Mec1 protein kinase for down-regulation of Hst3 protein level, led us to evaluate the possibility that Hst3 protein is targeted for proteasome-mediated proteolysis during genotoxic stress through Mec1-dependent phosphorylation. We found that phosphorylation of Hst3 in wild type cells is accompanied by the appearance of ubiquitylated protein forms that are barely detectable in mec1 cells, consistent with phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitylation of Hst3 (Fig. 2C). To determine whether increased Mec1-mediated ubiquitylation of Hst3 during genotoxic stress promotes its instability, we next evaluated the effects of MMS on Hst3 protein stability in wild type and mec1 cells. We found that Hst3 protein has a half-life of 8.5 and 9 min in wild type and mec1 cells, respectively (Fig. 2D). Genotoxic stress decreases the half-life of Hst3 to 3.5 min in wild type cells, and this decrease appears to be dependent on Mec1, since we observe that Hst3 half-life does not significantly decrease in a mec1 mutant (9 min versus 8 min without and with MMS, respectively). These findings show that Hst3 level during genotoxic stress is regulated through Mec1-dependent proteolysis. Together, our results support the hypothesis that genotoxic stress leads to rapid Mec1-dependent phosphorylation of Hst3, its ubiquitylation, and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation.HST3 and HST4 Participate in the S Phase-specific Branch of the DNA Damage Response Network through Control of H3K56 Acetylation—The finding that Hst3 is expressed during S phase combined with the observation that hst3 hst4 mutants are sensitive to DNA-damaging agents led us to evaluate these mutants for sensitivity to HU. Because MMS sensitivity, created by the loss of HST3 and HST4, has been previously shown to be synthetic with the lack of RAD9 (28Brachmann C.B. Sherman J.M. Devine S.E. Cameron E.E. Pillus L. Boeke J.D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2888-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), we also tested hst3 hst4 rad9 triple mutants for sensitivity to HU. We found that these triple mutants have a growth defect and are sensitive to concentrations of HU that do not have an appreciable effect on growth of either hst3 hst4 double mutants or rad9 single mutants (Fig. 3A). This result demonstrates that loss of HST3 and HST4 makes cells vulnerable to replication stress in the absence of RAD9.FIGURE 3HST3, HST4, and H3K56 are involved in the S phase branch of the DNA damage response network. A, wild type (14141), hst3 hst4 (14299), rad9 (14451), and hst3 hst4 rad9 (14453) strains were tested for HU sensitivity. 5-Fold serial dilutions of yeast cultures were spotted on C medium in the absence or presence of 20 mm HU. Plates were incubated for 3 days at 30 °C. B, strains with the following genotypes were grown to midlog phase, harvested, and diluted in rich medium in the absence or presence of 0.032% MMS for 45 min (top) or at the indicated time points (bottom): RAD53-3HA (14507), RAD53-3HA hst3 hst4 (14508), RAD53-3HA rad9 (14509), RAD53-3HA hst3 hst4 rad9 (14510), and RAD53-3HA sml1 mec1 (14502). Rad53-3HA level was detected by Western blot using an anti-HA antibody. Actin was probed as a loading control.

This resulted in a total lack of triadin expression in both skeletal and cardiac muscle. Triadin knockout was not embryonic or birth-lethal, and null mice presented no obvious functional phenotype. Western blot analysis of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) proteins in skeletal muscle showed that the absence of triadin expression was associated with down-regulation of Junctophilin-1, junctin, and calsequestrin but resulted in no obvious contractile dysfunction. Ca2+ imaging studies in null lumbricalis muscles and myotubes showed that the lack of triadin did not prevent skeletal excitation-contraction coupling but reduced the amplitude of their Ca2+ transients. Additionally, null myotubes and adult fibers had significantly increased myoplasmic resting free Ca2+.[3H]Ryanodine binding studies of skeletal muscle SR vesicles detected no differences in Ca2+ activation or Ca2+ and Mg2+ inhibition between wild-type and triadin-null animals.

Overall, our data support an indirect role for triadin in regulating myoplasmic Ca2+ homeostasis and organizing the molecular complex of the triad but not in regulating skeletal-type excitation-contraction coupling. In skeletal muscle, depolarization-initiated calcium release, and the subsequent muscle contraction, depends on the direct interaction of the slow voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channel (dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) 3The abbreviations used are: DHPRdihydropyridine receptorRyR1ryanodine receptor 1CsqcalsequestrinCRUcalcium release unitSRsarcoplasmic reticulumjSRjunctional SRECexcitation contractionFDBflexor digitorum brevisTAtibialis anteriorSolsoleusEDLextensor digitorum longusCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidSERCAsarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase ) and the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release channel (ryanodine receptor, RyR1) in the triad junction. However, an increasing number of other proteins associated with RyRs have been identified in the triadic region and have emerged as important regulators of the Ca2+ release mediated by these two channels (for review see Refs. 1Beard N.A.

These proteins, including calsequestrin (Csq), calmodulin, triadin, junctin, Junctophilins 1 and 2, MG-29, FKBP12, and others yet to be discovered, along with the RyR and DHPR make up the so-called calcium release units (CRUs) (5Flucher B.E.

Triadin was first identified in skeletal muscle as a 94- to 95-kDa transmembrane protein (7Brandt N.R. Caswell A.H. Wen S.R. Talvenheimo J.A. J. Membr.

Early studies of binding assays of solubilized SR proteins showed that triadin could not only be coimmunoprecipitated with other triadic proteins (10Marty I. Robert M. Villaz M. De Jongh K. Lai Y. Catterall W.A. Ronjat M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Based in this association triadin was proposed as the key molecular linker mediating the DHPR/RyR1 communication during muscle contraction. Although functional interactions between triadin and the DHPR in skeletal muscle have proven difficult to confirm, functional and structural interactions between triadin and RyR1 have been documented by several investigators. In vitro studies have shown that the SR luminal domain of triadin not only interacts with RyR1 but appears to anchor Csq to it, mediating the functional coupling between these two proteins via specific domains (13Guo W.

In addition, purified triadin 95 has been shown to inhibit [3H]ryanodine binding in solubilized heavy SR and to reduce the probability of aperture of purified RyR1s incorporated into the planar lipid bilayers (20Ohkura M.

Together these studies suggest a negative regulatory role for triadin on RyR1 Ca2+ regulation and support the hypothesis that triadin 95 plays an important role in excitation contraction (EC) coupling in skeletal muscle. In addition to the 95-kDa isoform described in rabbit and rat skeletal muscle, where it has been renamed Trisk 95, a 51-kDa triadin isoform (Trisk 51) was also identified in rat (21Marty I.

Muscles and myotubes derived from triadin-null mice were then subjected to an extensive physiologic, biochemical, and ultrastructural characterization. Surprisingly, we find that homozygous triadin-null mice have no obvious functional phenotype and are able to breed and survive into adulthood. Most importantly we detected almost normal EC coupling and no obvious differences in RyR1 channel regulation between null and wild-type mice. Minor ultrastructural alterations of the triadic junction organization were observed in fast but not slow twitch triadin-null muscle fibers. Overall, our data support a contributory role for triadin 95 and triadin 51 in the structural organization of the triad junction and regulation of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis but indicate that triadins are not essential components of skeletal-type EC coupling. Generation of Triadin-null Mice—A mouse genomic DNA library was screened with a rabbit triadin cDNA fragment to yield a 14-kb DNA fragment containing the complete Exon-1 and a partial fragment of Intron-1 of Trdn gene. A targeting construct was designed by flanking the entire Exon-1 and its putative promoter regulatory region with two loxP sites. The floxed Exon was then inserted into pTKLNCL vector (kindly provided by Dr. Rick Mortensen), downstream of the cytocine deaminase/neomycin expression cassette (Fig. 1A). The vector was electroporated into 129/SvJ ES cells, and the recombined cells were then microinjected into C57BL/6N blastocysts to generate chimeric mice. Heterozygous germ line-transmitted mice carrying the floxed allele (Trdn+/flxd) were then bred with EIIa-Cre transgenic mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) to excise the loxP-floxed exon (26Lakso M. Pichel J.G. Gorman J.R. Sauer B. Okamoto Y. Lee E. Alt F.W. Westphal H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5860-5865Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). The resulting heterozygous Trdn-null mice, which lack both Exon-1 and the CD-Neo selection cassette, were then interbred to obtain homozygous Trdn-null mice. Genotyping was performed by PCR and Southern blotting analysis using genomic DNA (Fig. 1B). Cell Culture and Ca2+ Imaging—Primary myotubes from triadin-null and wild-type mice were isolated according to the method of Rando and Blau (27Rando T.A. Blau H.M. Methods Cell Biol. 1997; 52: 261-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The myoblasts were grown and differentiated as described previously (28Perez C.F. Lopez J.R. Allen P.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C640-C649Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Calcium imaging was performed 4-5 days after differentiation, in myotubes loaded with 2 μm Fluo-4 AM (Molecular Probes, OR). The cells were imaged in imaging buffer (mm: 125 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.2 MgSO4, 6 glucose, and 25 HEPES, pH 7.4) at 490-500 nm using a DG4 multiwavelength light source with a Stanford Photonics 12 bit digital intensified charge-coupled device, and the data were displayed and analyzed using QED imaging software (QED Software, Pittsburgh PA). Depolarization-initiated Ca2+ release was tested by exposing the cells to increased voltage steps using electrical field stimulation in imaging buffer without CaCl2 and supplemented with 0.5 mm CdCl2 and 0.1 mm LaCl3. Chemical depolarization was achieved by a 10-s exposure to high K+ buffer (28Perez C.F. Lopez J.R. Allen P.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C640-C649Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), supplemented with or without 2 mm Ca2+ plus Cd2+ and La3+, using a multivalve perfusion system (AutoMate Scientific, Inc., Oakland, CA). SR Ca2+ Loading Content Determination—Relative SR Ca2+ content levels of myotubes and flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) fibers were estimated from the magnitude of the Ca2+ release induced by 40 mm caffeine in Fluo-4AM-loaded cells. Caffeine was supplemented with 1 μm thapsigargin and 0.5 mm Cd2+/0.1 mm La3+ to block the SERCA pump and avoid Ca2+ entry from the extracellular medium, respectively. Single muscle fibers from FDB muscle were enzymatically dissociated with collagenase as described previously (29Brown L.D. Rodney G.G. Hernandez-Ochoa E. Ward C.W. Schneider M.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: C1156-C1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and were imaged at 1 fps in the presence of 100 μm n-benzyl-p-toluenesulfonamide to prevent muscle contraction. Total SR calcium content was expressed as the area under the curve of the Ca2+ release transient induced by 70- to 90-s exposure to the caffeine mixture. Resting Free Ca2+ Measurements—Determination of myoplasmic resting free Ca2+ in myotubes and intact muscles was performed with double-barreled Ca2+-selective microelectrodes assembled with ETH129 resin as described previously (28Perez C.F. Lopez J.R. Allen P.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C640-C649Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 30Lopez J.R. Contreras J. Linares N. Allen P.D. Anesthesiology. 2000; 92: 1799-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Intact Adult Fiber Studies—Intact lumbricalis muscles (1.0-2.0×± 0.2-0.3 mm) from the hind foot were dissected in icecold Krebs-Henseleit solution (mm: 119 NaCl, 4.6 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1.2 MgSO4, 25 NaHCO3, 1.2 KH2PO4, and 11 glucose) containing 30 mm 2,3-butanedione monoxime (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), mounted in the Guth muscle research apparatus and loaded with 5 μm Fura 2-AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in an oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit solution containing 0.5% cremophore for 1 h, as described previously (31Wang Y. Xu Y. Guth K. Kerrick W.G. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1999; 20: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Fura-2 fluorescence, expressed as a 340 nm/380 nm excitation ratio, was collected with a 4-ms resolution timeframe. Membrane Vesicle Preparation and Immunoblotting—Microsomal vesicles were prepared from lower limb and individual muscles (tibialis anterior (TA), soleus (Sol), and extensor digitorum longus (EDL)) of wild-type and triadin-null mice, 6-8 weeks old. Muscles were homogenated in a Polytron cell disrupter in 5 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 300 mm sucrose supplemented with protease inhibitor (Complete™, Roche Applied Science) and collected as described elsewhere (28Perez C.F. Lopez J.R. Allen P.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C640-C649Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Expression of specific proteins was assessed by incubation of immunoblots with poly- or monoclonal antibodies against; RyR1 (34C, Sigma), skeletal DHPR (MA3-920), SERCA (MA3-911), calsequestrin (MA3-913), triadin (MA3-927, from Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO), junctin (1E6), Junctophilin-1 and -2 (kindly provided by Dr. H. Takeshima), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (FL-335, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Membranes were then incubated with either anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat, secondary antibody and developed with Super-Signal ultra chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Triadin expression was also confirmed by using PA-TRN6 antibody, which was raised to residues 146-160 in the luminal domain common to all skeletal muscle and cardiac triadins. Immunoblotting of transferred proteins was conducted using 125I-Protein A for visualization of antibody-binding proteins as reported previously (25Kobayashi Y.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28660-28668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 33Jones L.R. Zhang L. Sanborn K. Jorgensen A.O. Kelley J. J. Biol.

[3H]Ryanodine Binding Assay—[3H]Ryanodine binding to crude membrane extracts (25-30 μg/ml) was performed at equilibrium for 90 min at 37 °C in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.25 m KCl, and 5 nm [3H]Ryanodine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously (28Perez C.F. Lopez J.R. Allen P.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C640-C649Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Immunolabeling—Sternomastoid muscles were fixed in situ in 1% p-formaldehyde prepared in phosphate-buffered saline. Small bundles of cells were teased out, washed and then blocked in phosphate-buffered saline/bovine serum albumin containing 10% goat serum and 0.5% Triton X-100 for 1 h, at room temperature. Cells were then incubated in the primary antibody overnight at 4 °C, and then for 1-2 h with the secondary antibody at room temperature. The primary antibodies used were: anti-CSQ (VIIID12, Affinity BioReagents), anti-triadin (GE 4.90), anti-junctin (1E6), and anti-RyR (34C). Secondary antibodies were Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse and Texas red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (MP Biomedical, Solon, OH). Images were obtained in a confocal Zeiss LSM 510 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Switzerland). Electron Microscopy—Sternomastoid, EDL, and soleus muscles were fixed with 3.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2. Muscles were post-fixed in 2% OsO4 in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate for 1 h at room temperature, stained en bloc with saturated uranyl acetate in 70% ethanol, and embedded in Epon. Ultrathin sections (70-90 nm) were stained with saturated uranyl acetate solution in 50% ethanol and Sato lead solution (34Sato T. J. Electron Microsc. (Tokyo). 1968; 17: 158-159PubMed Google Scholar). The frequency of triads in different orientations was counted in images from longitudinal sections covering a 36-μm2 area. Two or three images were taken for each fiber. Data Analysis—Unless indicated otherwise statistical significant differences among the data were evaluated using One-way Tukey's analysis of variance (nonparametric) analysis and Student's t test (GraphPad Software, San Diego, Ca). Data are presented as mean ± S.D. or means ± S.E. Generation of Triadin-null Mice—For the 5′ sequence the triadin 95 cDNA was used as probe to isolate the 5′ fragment of the triadin gene (Trdn) in a 129svJ genomic DNA library and used to create a targeting construct. Because of the suspected key role of triadin in EC coupling, a conditional knockout strategy was attempted. The targeting vector was designed to conditionally delete Exon-1, and its putative 5′-untranslated region, in a tissue-specific manner by “floxing” the exon and the Neo/CD selection cassette with three loxP sites (Fig. 1A). ES cells carrying the appropriately targeted allele were injected into C57BL6 blastocysts and introduced into pseudo pregnant female mice. Germ line chimeric mice carrying the floxed alleles were backcrossed with C57BL6 EIIA cre mice in an attempt to either remove the Neo/CD selection cassette (to generate conditional knockouts) or to remove both Exon-1 and the Neo/CD selection cassette (to generate traditional knockouts). Progeny were screened using PCR (data not shown) and Southern blot (Fig. 1B). Despite several attempts it was never possible to obtain mice with the conditional allele. Heterozygous mice carrying the traditional knockout allele were then backcrossed, and surprisingly the homozygous mice (Trdn-/-) did not exhibit embryonic or birth lethality nor did they demonstrate any obvious gross functional phenotype. Triadin-null Muscles Lack Expression of All CRU-related Triadin Isoforms—Analyses for expression of triadin isoforms were performed by immunoblot in crude membrane extracts from lower limb muscle using two different anti-triadin antibodies. Fig. 1C compares the triadin expression pattern of wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous null muscles detected with MA3-297 antibody, specific for the 95-kDa isoform of triadin. As expected, skeletal muscle from heterozygous null mice (+/-) expressed significant amounts of the 95-kDa triadin isoform, although, to a lesser extent than wild-type (+/+) muscle. However, no detectable expression levels of this isoform were observed in membrane extracts from homozygous null muscle (-/-). The expression of the other triad-associated triadin isoform was further investigated by using a site-specific antibody (PA-TRN6) raised against residues 146-160 in the luminal domain of mouse cardiac and skeletal muscle triadins (25Kobayashi Y.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28660-28668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In microsomal fractions from wild-type mouse skeletal muscle (Fig. 1D, lane c) and from canine skeletal muscle (Fig. 1D, lane f), this antibody detected two prominent bands of ∼60 kDa and 95 kDa, corresponding to the higher molecular weight isoforms of triadin. No detectable levels of either isoform were evident in fractions from triadin-null mice (Fig. 1D, lane d). In addition this antibody did not detect either of the two lower molecular weight forms of triadin (35-40 kDa) that are primarily detected in cardiac ventricle (Fig. 1D, lane e). These two bands, although of different intensities, were readily observed in cardiac ventricular microsomal preparations from wild-type mice (Fig. 1D, lane a) but were absent in similar preparation from triadin-null animals (Fig. 1D, lane b), thus confirming that triadin-null skeletal and cardiac muscles lack any detectable expression levels of triadins. Triadin expression was further separately tested in fast twitch (EDL and TA) and slow twitch (Sol) muscle. Immunoblot analysis of microsomal fractions from wild-type mice show that each muscle type had a slightly different triadin expression pattern: whereas EDL and Sol muscles primarily expressed the 60-kDa isoform and, to a lesser extent, the 95-kDa isoform of triadin, TA muscles express only the 60-kDa isoform (Fig. 1E). Unlike their wild-type counterparts triadin-null muscles showed no detectable expression levels of either triadin isoform. However, a weak band in the 75- to 80-kDa range was evident in all muscle types tested (Fig. 1, D and E). This band does not correlate with any known isoform of triadin and is assumed to be the result of nonspecific antibody cross-reactivity, because it was present in both wild-type and null mice. Expression of Other Triadic Proteins in Triadin-null Skeletal Muscle—To address whether or not expression of triadin affected the expression pattern of other CRU proteins that are involved in the organization of the CRU, expression levels of RyR1, DHPR α1S, Csq, junctin, JP-1 and JP-2 were compared in wild-type and triadin-null EDL and soleus muscles (Fig. 2A). To quantify differences a densitometric analysis of the immunoblots was performed, and band densities were normalized to the expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase to correct for possible loading differences. Densitometric data show no significant differences in expression levels of DHPR α1S subunit or JP-2 between triadin-null and wild-type EDL or Sol muscles (Fig. 2, A and B, mean ± S.D., p > 0.05). However, a significant reduction in expression of JP-1 and Csq was detected in both EDL and Sol fibers in triadin-null mice. Expression of JP-1 was reduced to 76 ± 7% and 28 ± 4% of wild-type EDL and Sol fibers, respectively, and Csq was reduced to 76 ± 2% and 62 ± 15% of the wild-type EDL and Sol muscles, respectively (Fig. 2B). Expression of junctin and RyR1 was differentially affected in Sol and EDL muscles. Junctin was significantly down-regulated in EDL muscles (72 ± 2% of wild-type expression) but not in Sol fibers (99 ± 4% of wild-type expression, Fig. 2B), and RyR1 expression showed a slight but significant up-regulation in Sol (133 ± 8% of wild-type expression, Fig. 2B) but not in EDL (114 ± 4% of wild-type expression, Fig. 2B). Interestingly, unlike the adult muscles we detected no significant differences (p > 0.05) in Csq or junctin expression between wild-type and triadin-null myotubes (Fig. 2, A and B). Immunolabeling for calsequestrin, junctin, and RyR1 showed no detectable changes in the position of these molecules in fast twitch (sternomastoid) muscles of null versus wild-type mice (Fig. 2C). In all cases these proteins were located at spots corresponding to the location of the triads in two transverse bands on either side of the Z lines (note: a positional shift of Csq, affecting only a small percentage of the molecules as was observed by electron microscopy (see below), would not be detectable in these confocal images). Unfortunately anti-triadin antibody GE 4.90, which was used for Western blots, gave nonspecific staining when used on p-formaldehyde fixed tissue in our attempts at triadin immunolabeling (data not shown). Effect of the Absence of Triadin on the Organization of Junctional and Longitudinal SR—To evaluate the role of triadin on the subcellular architecture of skeletal muscle we analyzed the ultrastructure of junctional and free SR in wild-type and triadin-null fibers from fast twitch (sternomastoid, EDL) and slow twitch (Sol) muscles. The muscle ultrastructure from the null mice was basically unaltered in regards to the disposition and ordering of the myofibrils and cross-striation but showed subtle ultrastructural alterations in the triads and lateral SR that reveal a role for triadin both in retaining Csq within the jSR domains and, perhaps indirectly, in the arrangement of triads within the fiber. Two structural alterations were observed in triadin-null muscles. One is a disorder in the orientation of the triads. Although located opposite to the edges of the A band as in wild type, some of the triads in null muscles lost their predominant transverse orientation, which is more or less perpendicular to the long axis of the fibers (Fig. 3A, aster"

FtsZ is an attractive target for the development of new antibiotics. Assembly dynamics of FtsZ is regulated by the binding, hydrolysis, and exchange of GTP. We have determined the energetics of nucleotide binding to model apoFtsZ from Methanococcus jannaschii and studied the kinetics of 2′/3′-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl) (mant)-nucleotide binding and dissociation from FtsZ polymers, employing calorimetric, fluorescence, and stopped-flow methods. FtsZ binds GTP and GDP with Kb values ranging from 20 to 300 μm-1 under various conditions. GTP·Mg2+ and GDP·Mg2+ bind with slightly reduced affinity. Bound GTP and the coordinated Mg2+ ion play a minor structural role in FtsZ monomers, but Mg2+-assisted GTP hydrolysis triggers polymer disassembly. Mant-GTP binds and dissociates quickly from FtsZ monomers, with ∼10-fold lower affinity than GTP. Mant-GTP displacement measured by fluorescence anisotropy provides a method to test the binding of any competing molecules to the FtsZ nucleotide site. Mant-GTP is very slowly hydrolyzed and remains exchangeable in FtsZ polymers, but it becomes kinetically stabilized, with a 30-fold slower k+ and ∼500-fold slower k- than in monomers. The mant-GTP dissociation rate from FtsZ polymers is comparable with the GTP hydrolysis turnover and with the reported subunit turnover in Escherichia coli FtsZ polymers. Although FtsZ polymers can exchange nucleotide, unlike its eukaryotic structural homologue tubulin, GDP dissociation may be slow enough for polymer disassembly to take place first, resulting in FtsZ polymers cycling with GTP hydrolysis similarly to microtubules.

FtsZ is a cytoskeletal protein essential to bacterial cytokinesis and a member of the tubulin family of GTPases, which also includes αβ-tubulin (1Nogales E. Downing K.H. Amos L.A. Lowe J. Nat.

Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1340-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). FtsZ assembles by forming filaments that constitute the Z-ring at the cell division site in bacteria. The Z-ring, a dynamic structure maintained by assembly and disassembly of FtsZ, recruits the other elements of the division machinery following chromosome segregation (6Bi E.F. Lutkenhaus J.

Bacterial cell growth and division are regulated by nutrient availability; a metabolic sensor has been recently identified in Bacillus subtilis, including an effector, the glucosyltransferase UgtP, which modulates FtsZ assembly (11Weart R.B. Lee A.H. Chien A.C. Haeusser D.P. Hill N.S. Levin P.A. Cell. 2007; 130: 335-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). GTP binding, hydrolysis, and exchange constitute the regulatory mechanism responsible for dynamics of FtsZ and tubulin polymers. The nucleotide switches of these assembling GTPases appear to involve polymerization-driven structural changes (12Buey R.M. Diaz J.F. Andreu J.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5933-5938Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), although FtsZ and tubulin form different end polymers. The GTPase activity of FtsZ is modified by the polymerization inhibitory protein MipZ (13Thanbichler M. Shapiro L. Cell. 2006; 126: 147-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) and, weakly, by EzrA (14Chung K.M. Hsu H.H. Yeh H.Y. Chang B.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 14891-14897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The hydrolyzable nucleotide bound to tubulin becomes occluded in microtubule protofilaments (15Nogales E. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Microtubules hydrolyze all bound GTP to GDP except at their very ends and become metastable, giving rise to microtubule dynamic instability (16Burbank K.S. Mitchison T.J. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: R516-R517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In contrast, polymers of FtsZ from E. coli were reported to contain mostly GTP, and, under certain conditions, nucleotide exchange proceeds faster than hydrolysis (17Mingorance J. Rueda S. Gomez-Puertas P. Valencia A. Vicente M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This suggested that the nucleotide binding site remains exchangeable in FtsZ polymers, which would therefore be devoid of dynamic instability. Polymers of Methanococcus jannaschii FtsZ were found to contain different proportions of GTP and GDP (depending on the hydrolysis rate) and to rapidly depolymerize upon either GTP consumption or GDP addition (18Huecas S. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46146-46154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 19Oliva M.A. Huecas S. Palacios J.M. Martin-Benito J. Valpuesta J.M. Andreu J.M.

GDP binding destabilizes M. jannaschhi FtsZ polymers compared with polymers with GTP or without a bound nucleotide (20Huecas S. Andreu J.M. FEBS Lett. 2004; 569: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In E. coli FtsZ polymers the main rate-limiting step in nucleotide turnover was found to be nucleotide hydrolysis, rapidly followed by phosphate release, whereas a second rate-limiting step could be nucleotide dissociation. However, whether nucleotide dissociation took place directly from the polymer or through depolymerization into subunits, followed by GDP release, was not determined (21Romberg L. Mitchison T.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). An important problem yet to be solved for FtsZ assembly dynamics is whether, following GTP hydrolysis (i) GDP dissociates from subunits in the FtsZ polymer which directly reload with GTP, (ii) polymer subunits exchange with GTP-bound subunits in solution, or (iii) the FtsZ-GDP polymer fully disassembles and reassembles again from GTP-bound subunits. Consistent with an exchangeable nucleotide in FtsZ polymers, the nucleotide was observed to be largely accessible in the crystal structure of a protofilament-like dimer of M. jannaschii FtsZ (22Oliva M.A. Cordell S.C. Lowe J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). On the other hand, exchange of GFP-FtsZ fusions in bacterial Z-rings was found to proceed with a half-time of 8-9 s in vivo, by means of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (23Stricker J. Maddox P. Salmon E.D. Erickson H.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3171-3175Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 24Anderson D.E. Gueiros-Filho F.J. Erickson H.P. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5775-5781Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). As observed in an in vitro fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay, subunit turnover in filaments of E. coli FtsZ took place with a half-time of 7 s with GTP, which was slowed down under conditions reducing the nucleotide hydrolysis rate (25Chen Y. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22549-22554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This rate of subunit turnover is comparable with the turnover rate of GTP hydrolysis (21Romberg L. Mitchison T.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and with the rate of depolymerization in GDP excess, suggesting that GDP does not exchange into intact filaments (23Stricker J. Maddox P. Salmon E.D. Erickson H.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3171-3175Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). This favors the interpretation that the rapid assembly dynamics of FtsZ filaments may operate by a mechanism related to microtubule dynamic instability (25Chen Y. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22549-22554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).

[8-3H]GTP (6 Ci/mmol) and [α-32P]GTP (∼400 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham Biosciences. Nucleotides were analyzed (after extraction with perchloric acid in the case of protein samples) (18Huecas S.

All other chemicals (analytical grade) used were from Merck or Sigma. Preparation of Nucleotide-free FtsZ from M. jannaschii—FtsZ (without histidine tag) was overproduced in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLys and was purified as described (18Huecas S. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46146-46154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 19Oliva M.A. Huecas S. Palacios J.M. Martin-Benito J. Valpuesta J.M. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33562-33570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Nucleotide-free FtsZ (apoFtsZ) was prepared as described (20Huecas S. Andreu J.M. FEBS Lett. 2004; 569: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. FtsZ was incubated in 2.5 m guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) for 30 min at room temperature, followed by gel filtration in a 0.9 × 25-cm Sephadex G-25 column in 25 mm Pipes/KOH and 2.5 m GdmCl, pH 7.5, to separate the released nucleotide from protein (monitored spectrophotometrically at 254 and 280 nm). A second G-25 column in 25 mm Pipes/KOH, 50 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5 (Pipes-KCl buffer) was used to eliminate GdmCl and equilibrate the protein in this experimental buffer. ApoFtsZ concentration was measured spectrophotometrically employing an extinction coefficient ϵ280 = 6990 m-1 cm-1 (calculated for 1 Trp, 1 Tyr). ApoFtsZ was frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen and was melted on ice before use. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)—Measurements were performed using a VP-DSC microcalorimeter (Microcal, Inc.). Samples were degassed at room temperature prior to calorimetric experiments. Calorimetric cells (operative volume ∼0.5 ml) were kept under an extra constant pressure of 2 atm to prevent degassing during the scan. Standard VP-Viewer and Origin-DSC software (MicroCal) were used for data acquisition and analysis. Excess heat capacity (Cp) was obtained after subtraction of the buffer-buffer base line, and the denaturation enthalpy (ΔHD) was determined from the area under the absorption peak. Measurements were performed at a scan rate of 30 °C/h in Pipes-KCl buffer using 12 μm FtsZ. GXP and Mg2+ concentrations were 100 μm and 10 mm, respectively. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—Calorimetric titrations of FtsZ with GXP, GXP-Mg, and Mg2+ were performed at 25 °C using a MCS titration calorimeter (MicroCal). Measurements were carried out in Pipes-KCl buffer, supplemented with 10 mm Mg2+ in both protein and nucleotide solutions for titration experiments with GXP·Mg2+ (EDTA was omitted for titration with Mg2+). Samples were dialyzed against buffer before measurements. Ligand solutions (∼150 μm GXP or 50 mm Mg2+) were prepared in the dialysis buffer. FtsZ (10-25 μm) solution was loaded into the calorimeter cell and titrated, typically, by adding 1× 1 μl, plus 16-22 injections (10-12 μl), of a concentrated solution of the ligand. Heats of titrant dilution were determined in separate runs and subtracted, when required, to obtain the heat of binding. Binding isotherms were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis to a single set of sites model, using software supplied by the manufacturer, to calculate the number of binding sites (n), the binding constant (Kb), and the enthalpy of binding (ΔH). Stoichiometry of Binding of Nucleotides and ApoFtsZ Polymerization—The stoichiometry of binding of GTP, GDP, mant-GTP, and mant-GDP to soluble apoFtsZ was measured using a centrifugation assay. ApoFtsZ (6 or 8 μm) was incubated at 25 °C for 30 min with nucleotides at different known concentrations (3-15 μm) in a final volume of 0.6 ml of Pipes-KCl buffer. Samples were then centrifuged for 2.5 h at 100,000 rpm and 25 °C in a TLA-120.2 rotor employing a Beckman Optima TLX ultracentrifuge. After centrifugation, the top 0.3 ml were carefully withdrawn, and the concentration of free nucleotide was determined spectrophotometrically, employing the extinction coefficients ϵ254 = 23,300 m-1 cm-1 for mant-nucleotides and ϵ254 = 13,620 m-1 cm-1 for GTP and GDP. The top half contained only free nucleotide and essentially no protein, as checked by control measurements, and the bottom half contained all of the protein, in chemical equilibrium with free nucleotide. The nucleotide bound to FtsZ was calculated as the difference of the known total concentration of nucleotide minus the free concentration in the top part of the solution. To measure the stoichiometry of binding of mant-GTP to apoFtsZ polymers, 20 μm apoFtsZ was polymerized at 55 °C in Pipes-KCl buffer with 10 mm MgCl2. After 10 min, 20 μm mant-GTP was added. After 1, 10, and 20 min, different aliquots of 0.1 ml were taken and centrifuged for 6 min at 80,000 rpm in a prewarmed TLA-100 rotor employing a Beckman Optima TLX ultracentrifuge (18Huecas S. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46146-46154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). After centrifugation, the supernatant was carefully withdrawn and the pellet was resuspended in buffer. FtsZ concentration was measured in the supernatant and in the pellet with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (43Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar) in multiwell plates, employing spectrophotometrically calibrated FtsZ standards and a Titertek Multiskan MC plate reader with a 595-nm filter. Mant-GTP bound to FtsZ was fluorometrically determined in the resuspended pellet employing a Shimadzu RF-540 spectrofluorometer (excitation wavelength 357 nm, emission wavelength 445 nm, 5-nm excitation and emission slits) using standards of FtsZ-bound mant-GTP. Affinity of Binding of [3H]GTP to ApoFtsZ—Binding of [8-3H]GTP to apoFtsZ was measured by protein depletion (44Medrano F.J. Andreu J.M. Gorbunoff M.J. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3770-3777Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) as follows. Varying [8-3H]GTP concentrations were added to aliquots of apoFtsZ (500 nm) in Pipes-KCl buffer (0.2 ml). Mixtures were centrifuged for 1.5 h at 100,000 rpm and 25 °C in a Beckman TLA-100 rotor. The total [8-3H]GTP concentration was determined in the bottom half, and the free concentration was determined in the protein-depleted top half of tubes, after dilution in 1.5 ml of Beckman ReadySafe solution, employing a Wallac Trilux 1450 Microbeta liquid scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). In each assay, controls with [8-3H]GTP alone were included, and concentrations were corrected for the small amount of nucleotide sedimented in the absence of protein. When we measured the binding of [8-3H]GTP to an excess of apoFtsZ, 1.8% of inactive ligand was found in the stock solution. This percentage was subtracted from the concentration of free [8-3H]GTP calculated in each assay. Affinity of Binding of Mant-nucleotides to ApoFtsZ—Binding of mant-nucleotides to FtsZ was measured by the increase in fluorescence intensity and anisotropy of the probe. It was first confirmed that more than 95% of mant-GXP co-sedimented with an excess of apoFtsZ upon high speed centrifugation. Fluorescence of free and FtsZ-bound mant-GXP was measured with a Fluorolog 3-221 instrument (Jobin Yvon-Spex, Longiumeau, France) employing an excitation wavelength of 357 nm and an emission wavelength of 445 nm, with 3- and 5-nm bandwidths, respectively, and 2 × 10-mm cells. Anisotropy was measured in T-format with 5-nm excitation bandwidth and 10-nm emission bandwidths. Protein-fluorescent ligand interaction was determined as reported (45Andreu J.M. Barasoain I. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11975-11984Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), with modifications. Fixed concentrations of mant-GXP (10-500 nm) were first titrated with different apoFtsZ concentrations (0-6 μm) in Pipes-KCl buffer, with or without 10 mm Mg2+, to obtain the anisotropy increment, Δrmax, corresponding to all of the mant-GTP bound. To do this, the increase in anisotropy was plotted against apoFtsZ concentration and iteratively least-squares fitted with an isotherm of binding to one site. The estimated values of Δrmax were used to approximate the free apoFtsZ concentrations, and these new values were employed again, until an unchanging Δrmax value was obtained. The convergent data were used to calculate the binding constant of apoFtsZ to mant-GXP. Titration of apoFtsZ (500 nm) with different mant-GTP concentrations was also measured, and the data were model-fitted (employing the Δrmax value) to yield the number of binding sites and the equilibrium binding constant of mant-GTP to apoFtsZ. Affinity of Ligands Competing with Mant-GTP—Competition assays were performed by measuring, through the decrease in fluorescence anisotropy, the displacement of mant-GTP from FtsZ. Different concentrations of competing ligand were mixed with apoFtsZ (500 nm) and mant-GTP (500 nm) in Pipes-KCl, 10 mm MgCl2 buffer (final volume of 0.4 ml), and the anisotropy was measured at 25 °C. The fraction of the reference ligand mant-GTP bound was plotted against the competing ligand concentration, and data were fitted assuming that the two ligands bind to the same site. The resulting system of equations (45Andreu J.M. Barasoain I. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11975-11984Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) was numerically solved with the program Equigra version 5.0 (46Diaz J.F. Buey R.M. Zhou J. Microtubule Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2007: 245-260Google Scholar) or with a MATLAB script (available upon request), 7S. Huecas, C. Schaffner-Barbero, J. F. Díaz, and J. M. Andreu, unpublished data. which provided the best fitted value of the equilibrium binding constant of the competing ligand. The relative affinity of FtsZ for GDP and GTP was directly determined by incubating apoFtsZ with solutions of different ratios of GTP/GDP for 1 h at 25 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5 (Tris-KCl buffer). Excess nucleotide was removed by a chromatography in a fast desalting column HR 10/10 (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in the same buffer with 10 μm nucleotide at the same GDP/GTP ratio. Eluted protein was precipitated with perchloric acid, and nucleotide content was measured by HPLC. Kinetics of Binding and Dissociation of Mant-nucleotides to ApoFtsZ—Kinetic measurements were made with a Bio-Logic SFM-400 T-format stopped-flow device equipped with a fluorescence detection system. A wavelength of 368 nm in the excitation pathway and a filter with a cut-off of 450 nm in the emission pathway was employed. When measuring light scattering at the same time, a 350-nm band pass filter was included in the second emission pathway. 5-10 separate curves were averaged for each condition, and the curves so obtained were fitted to a single-, double- or triple-exponential equation of the form y(t) = at + b + ΣAie-kit (where the slope (a) and offset (b) correspond to the linear drift after the reaction). The best fitting rate constants (ki) and amplitudes (Ai) were determined with the Bio-Kine software (Bio-Logic) or with a nonlinear least squares fitting program based on the Marquardt algorithm (47Bevington P.R. Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1969: 235-240Google Scholar). Histidine-tagged FtsZ Polymers—FtsZ-His6 and mutant FtsZ-W319Y-His6 were overproduced in E. coli and affinity-purified as described (19Oliva M.A. Huecas S. Palacios J.M. Martin-Benito J. Valpuesta J.M. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33562-33570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). ApoFtsZ-W319Y-His6 was prepared as apoFtsZ above, and its concentration was measured with an extinction coefficient ϵ280 = 2980 m-1 cm-1 (2 Tyr). It was diluted at 55 °C into Pipes-KCl buffer, pH 6.5, supplemented with 6 mm MgCl2 and nucleotides (the His-tagged protein has a tendency to precipitate at pH <7 at room temperature). FtsZ polymers were negatively stained and observed under a Jeol 1230 electron microscope. Copolymers of FtsZ-W319Y-His6 and FtsZ-His6, formed in 50 mm Mes, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 6.5 (Mes-KCl buffer) with 6 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 mm GTP at 55 °C, were pelleted by centrifugation at 60,000 rpm for 6 min at 55 °C in a prewarmed TLA-100 rotor. They were resuspended in 1% SDS, and the concentration of the FtsZ-His6 single Trp was measured fluorometrically by excitation at 295 nm, employing FtsZ-His6 standards. Concentration of FtsZ-W319Y-His6 polymers was measured with the Bio-Rad assay (43Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar) with FtsZ-W319Y-His6 standards. Exchange of [α-32P]GTP into FtsZ-W319Y-His6 or FtsZ-His6, in Mes-KCl buffer with 6 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm GTP at 55 °C, was measured employing a nitrocellulose filtration assay (17Mingorance J. Rueda S. Gomez-Puertas P. Valencia A. Vicente M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Effects of Nucleotide on FtsZ Secondary Structure and Thermal Stability—Prior to studying the interactions of FtsZ with nucleotides, effects of the bound nucleotide on FtsZ stability were evaluated. The circular dichroism spectrum of stable nucleotide-free FtsZ from M. jannaschii (20Huecas S. Andreu J.M. FEBS Lett. 2004; 569: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) was not significantly different from that of FtsZ. The reversible unfolding profiles with GdmCl were also very similar in the absence and presence of 50 μm GTP plus 1 mm MgCl2, with a [GdmCl]½ value of 3.1 m (supplemental Fig. 1); this is compatible with the release of the nucleotide at lower GdmCl concentration (48Andreu J.M. Oliva M.A. Monasterio O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43262-43270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Nucleotide binding would be expected to stabilize the protein against denaturation. This was examined by differential scanning calorimetry, which was done with GDP, in order to avoid FtsZ polymerization and GTP hydrolysis at high temperatures. Irreversible thermograms (Fig. 1A) showed that this thermophilic"

Besides the two kinases IKKα and IKKβ, the IKK complex contains NEMO/IKKγ, an additional subunit with regulatory and adaptor functions. NEMO not only confers structural stability to the IKK complex but also participates in the activation process of the IKK complex by linking the IKK subunits to upstream activators. In this study we analyze the IKKβ-mediated phosphorylation of the IKK-binding domain of NEMO. In vitro, IKKβ phosphorylates three serine residues in the domain of NEMO at positions 43, 68, and 85. However, mutational analysis revealed that only the phosphorylation of serine 68 in the center of the IKK-binding domain plays an essential role for the formation and the function of the IKK complex. Thus, Ser68 phosphorylation attenuates the amino-terminal dimerization of NEMO as well as the IKKβ-NEMO interaction. In contrast, the NEMO-IKKα interaction was only mildly affected by the phosphorylation of Ser68. However, functional analysis revealed that Ser68 phosphorylation primarily affects the activity of IKKα. Furthermore, in complementation experiments of NEMO-deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts, a S68A-NEMO mutant enhanced, whereas a S68E mutant decreased, TNF-α-induced NF-κB activity, thus emphasizing the inhibitory role of the Ser68 phosphorylation on the signal-induced NF-κB activity. Finally, we provide evidence that the protein phosphatase PP2A is involved in the regulation of the Ser68-based mechanism. In summary, we provide evidence for a signal-induced phosphorylation-dependent alteration of the IKK complex emphasizing the dynamic nature of this multisubunit kinase complex.

The transcription factor NF-κB plays a crucial role in the initiation of innate and adaptive immune responses, in inflammation and tumorigenesis (1Schulze-Luehrmann J. Ghosh S.

This phosphorylation marks the IκB proteins for proteasomal degradation setting NF-κB free, which then translocates into the nucleus and supports the expression of various pro-inflammatory or anti-apoptotic gene products. The IκB kinase (IKK) complex is composed of two catalytically active subunits, termed IKKα (IKK1) and IKKβ (IKK2), as well as NEMO/IKKγ, a subunit with regulatory and adaptor functions (4Zandi E.

Analysis of mice deficient for either IKKα or IKKβ suggested that the IKKβ subunit is the major IKK regulating the canonical NF-κB pathway, and the IKKα subunit is crucial for a second, alternative NF-κB pathway leading to the activation of RelB-p52 heterodimers (6Senftleben U.

In contrast to the canonical NF-κB pathway, which depends on the presence of NEMO, the alternative pathway is NEMO-independent but requires the protein kinase NIK. However, recent data suggest that, instead of a clear assignment of IKKα and IKKβ to the alternative and the canonical NF-κB pathway, respectively, both kinases contribute to the activation of NF-κB by the canonical pathway with only gradual differences (8Solt L.A.

Besides the phosphorylation of IKKα and IKKβ at two serine residues in their T-loop, the ubiquitination and occasionally the phosphorylation at a specific serine residue of NEMO seem to be required (10Zhou H.

This serine residue at position 85 of NEMO has been identified as a protein kinase Cα, and more recently as an ATM target-site crucial for the IKK activation induced by genotoxic stress (12Wu Z.H.

Commun. 2001; 285: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of the TNF-α-receptor I or the human T-cell lymphotrophic virus I Tax protein induces the IKKβ-mediated NEMO phosphorylation at several additional serine residues, primarily at the serine residues 31 and 43 in the amino terminus and 376 and 377 in the carboxyl terminus of NEMO (14Carter R.S.

However, no physiological functions for these IKKβ-mediated NEMO phosphorylation steps have been described. Ubiquitination of the carboxyl terminus of NEMO is another crucial step in the TNF-α or TCR-induced NF-κB activation process. One hypothesis is that the ubiquitination either leads to a structural alteration of the IKK complex, probably inducing a proximity-induced IKK activation (10Zhou H. Wertz I. O'Rourke K. Ultsch M.

However, post-translational modification of NEMO, like its phosphorylation or ubiquitination, might also positively influence its oligomerization status, which was for instance observed upon TNF-α stimulation or Tax overexpression (20Poyet J.L.

Two different domains mediate the oligomerization of NEMO, one domain, the minimal oligomerization domain (MOD), is located in the carboxyl terminus, spanning amino acids 246–365, and mediates a NEMO trimerization; the second domain is located in the amino terminus overlapping the IKK-binding domain of NEMO (23Tegethoff S. Behlke J. Scheidereit C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2029-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 24Marienfeld R.B. Palkowitsch L. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 9209-9219Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Importantly, the formation of both homotypic NEMO interactions is necessary for a functional IKK complex. Thus, peptides interfering with the carboxyl-terminal oligomerization like the BA-CC2 and BA-LZ peptides have been used to inhibit the signal-induced NF-κB activation (25Agou F. Courtois G. Chiaravalli J. Baleux F. Coic Y.M. Traincard F. Israel A. Veron M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54248-54257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In contrast, peptides corresponding to the IKK-binding domain of NEMO have either no or at best a mild effect, probably due to the additional binding of these peptides to IKKα or IKKβ (24Marienfeld R.B. Palkowitsch L. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 9209-9219Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Here, we analyzed the impact of the phosphorylation of the amino-terminal IKK-binding domain of NEMO. Three serine residues are located in the α-helical part of the IKK-binding domain of NEMO at positions 43, 68, and 85. We show here that all three serine residues are IKKβ target sites in vitro. However, by using NEMO mutants with either phospho-inhibiting serine to alanine or phospho-mimetic serine to glutamic acid substitutions at the positions Ser43, Ser68, or Ser85 of NEMO, we observed only in the case of the Ser68 phosphorylation a negative effect on the amino-terminal NEMO dimerization as well as the IKKβ-NEMO interaction. As a consequence we observed a significant reduction in the TNF-α-induced NF-κB activity in NEMO-deficient cells reconstituted with the phospho-mimetic S68E-NEMO mutant. Collectively, our data suggest that the activity of the IKK complex is negatively regulated by the NEMO phosphorylation at position Ser68. Cell Culture, Stable and Transient Transfection, and Reagents—Human 293 cells (obtained from ATCC), NEMO-deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), and normal wild-type MEFs were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). For transient transfections of 2 × 105 293 cells, the CaPO4-transfection method was used according to standard protocols. Stable transfection of MEFs was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Human recombinant TNFα was purchased by R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), and okadaic acid was from Calbiochem. Plasmids and Antibodies—Expression vectors encoding FLAG-tagged human full-length NEMO, NEMO1–197, NEMO1–100, wild type and dominant negative IKKβ, Xpress-IKKα, and Xpress-IKKβ have been described elsewhere (26May M.J. Marienfeld R.B. Ghosh S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45992-46000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The 3xκB firefly luciferase reporter plasmid and the Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid were described previously (27Marienfeld R. May M.J. Berberich I. Serfling E. Ghosh S. Neumann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19852-19860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The GST-NEMO expression vectors were generated by inserting the wild type or the mutated NEMO cDNA in-frame into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the pGex 4T1 vector. Specific antibodies recognizing the FLAG-epitope or the Xpress-epitope were purchased from Sigma and Invitrogen, respectively. Antibodies specific for IKKα, IKKβ, IκBα, ERK2, or NEMO were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA). The site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Quick-Change site directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Immunoprecipitation, GST Pulldown, and Immunoblotting—The immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting procedures were performed as described previously (27Marienfeld R. May M.J. Berberich I. Serfling E. Ghosh S. Neumann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19852-19860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In brief, 0.5–1 mg of protein extracts were mixed with 25 μl of bovine serum albumin-blocked FLAG-antibody (M2, Sigma) linked to agarose beads. The samples were incubated for 1–12 h at 4 °C with agitation. After incubation, the precipitates were washed extensively in TnT buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 2 μm leupeptin, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The resulting immunopurified proteins were used for immunoblotting experiments. In case of the GST pulldown analysis 1μg of the GST fusion protein was mixed with 1μl of the 35S-labeled in vitro translated protein sample and incubated under agitation for 1 h prior to a pulldown assay with 25 μl of glutathione-conjugated beads (Sigma). The samples were washed extensively with TnT buffer and separated on a SDS-gel. The gel was stained with Coomassie, fixed, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. For the immunoblotting analysis, either the immunopurified protein complexes, or, as indicated, 50–100 μg of a protein extract were loaded on a standard SDS-polyacrylamide gel (PAA; polyacrylamide). SDS-PAGE and the transfer to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) or nylon membranes (Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride-membrane, Millipore) were performed using standard protocols. The membrane was blocked with 5% milk powder in TBS+Tween 20 prior to the incubation with the primary antibody (1:1000 in TBS+Tween 20), subsequently washed three times for 5 min each, and incubated in a TBS-Tween 20 solution containing either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated or IRDye700/800-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000). The detection was performed using either ECL substrates from Amersham Biosciences or the Odyssey infrared scanning system (LICOR). In Vitro Kinase Assay and in Vivo Phosphorylation Studies—For the in vitro kinase assay the indicated proteins were individually expressed in 293 HEK cells prior to an anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation. The resulting immunocomplexes were washed extensively with TnT and finally with kinase-assay buffer to equilibrate the samples. Beads carrying either the immunopurified IKK or the immunopurified NEMO proteins were mixed, and the kinase reaction was perform at 30 °C for 30 min after adding 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in kinase reaction buffer. The samples were subsequently washed extensively with TnT buffer and phosphate-buffered saline prior to a separation by SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and the phosphorylation was monitored by autoradiography. For the in vivo phosphorylation studies 293 HEK cells were transiently transfected with the indicated expression vectors. After 24 h the cells were incubated for further 18 h in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% dialyzed calf-serum prior to incubation with 100 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate. The cells were treated as indicated, harvested, and lysed in TnT, and the resulting extracts were subjected to an anti-FLAG IP. The precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and the resulting membrane was used for autoradiography to monitor the phosphorylation and subsequently subjected to immunoblot analysis. Luciferase Reporter Assay—For the reporter gene assays, 293 cells were transiently transfected as described above. In general, we used 200 ng of the NF-κB-dependent reporter construct along with 15 ng of a Renilla luciferase reporter construct under the control of the human β-actin promoter, which leads to constitutive expression of the Renilla luciferase. 1 × 105 293 cells were transfected in one well of a 24-well plate. Equal DNA concentrations in each experiment (1.2 μg/well) were maintained by adding the appropriate empty vector to the DNA mixture. The cells were lysed after 24 h with TnT, and the firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured according to the protocol for the dual luciferase system (Promega). The resulting firefly luciferase values were normalized by the values of the Renilla luciferase. The experiments were done in parallel and were repeated at least three times. Gel Shift Analysis—For the gel shift analysis (electrophoretic mobility shift assay) 10 μg of nuclear proteins from untreated or stimulated cells was incubated on ice for 20 min in a reaction containing 0.3 ng of 32P-labeled κB-specific oligonucleotide, 1 μg of pdI:dC, and 3 μl of a binding buffer. The samples were separated on a native 5% polyacrylamide (PAA) gel, and the gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. For supershift or competition analysis, the indicated sample was preincubated with either a 100-fold molar excess of the cold κB-oligonucleotide or with 0.2 μg of the anti-RelA antibody. IKKβ Phosphorylates the IKK-binding Domain of NEMO at Multiple Sites in Vitro—Oligomerization of the adaptor protein NEMO is crucial for the function of the IKK complex (23Tegethoff S. Behlke J.

Yet, whether the activity of the IKK complex is regulated by an alteration of the oligomerization of NEMO described by Poyet et al. remains unclear (20Poyet J.L. Srinivasula S.M. Lin J.H. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Yamaoka S. Tsichlis P.N. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37966-37977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Interestingly, NEMO is a phospho protein targeted by different serine/threonine kinases in vivo and in vitro, and the identified serine target sites are located in both oligomerization domains (14Carter R.S. Pennington K.N. Ungurait B.J. Ballard D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19642-19648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 29Prajapati S. Gaynor R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24331-24339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this study we analyzed the role of the IKKβ-dependent phosphorylation at different serine residues at positions 43, 68, and 85 within in the amino-terminal IKK-binding domain (IBD) of NEMO for the activity of the IKK complex. To determine which of the three serine residues are phosphorylated by IKKβ in vitro, we performed in vitro kinase assays using ectopically expressed wild-type FLAG-NEMO or NEMO mutants with serine to alanine or cysteine substitutions at the positions 43 (S43A), 68 (S68A), or 85 (S85C) either separately or combined as a triple mutant (SIIIA/C-NEMO) alone or in conjunction with separately expressed FLAG-tagged IKKβ (for a schematic representation of the NEMO mutants used and the location of the serine residues see Fig. 1A). As depicted in Fig. 1B, we observed a high IKKβ-mediated phosphorylation of all FLAG-NEMO variants, which remained unchanged by the substitution of the single serine residues or by the combined substitution of all three serine residues (Fig. 1B, lanes 6–11). In contrast, none of the NEMO proteins were significantly phosphorylated in the absence of FLAG-tagged IKKβ (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–5) or in the presence of a dominant negative mutant of IKKβ (Fig. 1C, lanes 7–12). However, previous studies suggested that the phosphorylation of a specific IKK target site in NEMO might be masked by other phosphorylation events in NEMO due to the variety of IKK target sites in this protein (14Carter R.S. Pennington K.N. Ungurait B.J. Ballard D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19642-19648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 29Prajapati S. Gaynor R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24331-24339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Consistently, we observed a significant reduction of the IKKβ-mediated NEMO phosphorylation with all three single mutants (Fig. 1D) when we compared the different serine mutants with a wild-type version in the background of an amino-terminal FLAG-NEMO fragment, spanning the first hundred amino acids of NEMO (NEMO1–100), in a similar in vitro kinase assay. However, the reduction in the in vitro phosphorylation of S85C-NEMO1–100 is less pronounced (for a quantification see Fig. 1D, middle panel). Moreover, the effect on the IKKβ-mediated NEMO phosphorylation was even more dramatic in case of the SIIIA/C-NEMO1–100 triple mutant (Fig. 1D, lane 5). Based on these data, we concluded that all three serine residues located in the IBD, Ser43, Ser68, and Ser85, are IKKβ target sites in vitro. Phosphorylation of Serine 68 in the IKK-binding Domain of NEMO Attenuates the Amino-terminal NEMO Dimerization—Because the IKK-binding domain of NEMO is also crucial for the amino-terminal NEMO dimerization, we next compared the dimerization potential of the three single NEMO1–100 point mutants and the wild-type NEMO1–100. As shown in Fig. 2A, all mutants tested displayed an increased dimer formation, however, the dimerization of S68A-NEMO1–100 was significantly pronounced (Fig. 2A, lane 3), arguing for a critical role of Ser68 for the NEMO dimerization. The critical role of Ser68 was further supported by experiments with ectopic expressed full-length NEMO-proteins. Again, we observed an enhanced NEMO dimerization in case of S68A-NEMO and the SIIIA/C-triple mutant (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 6; right side: quantification of the dimer/monomer ratio in %). More strikingly, imitating the Ser68 phosphorylation by the substitution of Ser68 with a phospho-mimetic glutamic acid led to a significant decrease in NEMO dimerization (Fig. 2C, lane 4), further emphasizing the negative effect of the Ser68 phosphorylation on the amino-terminal NEMO dimerization. In order to analyze whether the Ser68 phosphorylation alters the global oligomerization status of NEMO, we treated whole cell extracts (WCEs) from 293 cells transfected with wild-type, S68A-, or S68E-NEMO with the cross-linker EGS. Without cross-linking S68A-NEMO slightly enhanced, and S68E-NEMO reduced, the formation of NEMO-dimers and higher molecular weight complexes (NEMOX) compared with wild-type NEMO (lanes 2–4). In addition, the NEMO-dimers mostly disappeared upon heating the samples for 10 min at 95 °C (lanes 6–8) with the exception of a remaining S68A-NEMO dimerization, thus once more demonstrating the positive effect of this mutation on the amino-terminal NEMO dimerization. However, cross-linking the proteins with EGS converted the different NEMO variants equally in NEMO-dimers and NEMO-based high molecular weight protein complexes (Fig. 2D, lanes 10–12), suggesting that only the amino-terminal dimerization, but not the global oligomerization status of NEMO is affected by the phosphorylation of Ser68, most likely due to an unaffected carboxyl-terminal oligomerization of NEMO. Phosphorylation of Ser68 Has a Negative Effect on the IKKβ-NEMO Interaction—Having established the negative effect of the Ser68 phosphorylation on the NEMO dimerization, we next analyzed whether the interaction of NEMO with IKKα or IKKβ is also altered by the substitution of Ser43, Ser68, or Ser85. For this, we performed an in vitro interaction study with ectopically expressed FLAG-tagged NEMO proteins in combination with in vitro transcribed/translated IKKα or IKKβ. Similar to the NEMO dimerization, only the IKKβ interaction with S68E-NEMO was significantly reduced (Fig. 3A, lane 5, middle panel), whereas the IKKα interaction of S68E-NEMO was, if all, only slightly affected (Fig. 3A, lane 5, upper panel). The specific negative effect of the S68E substitution on the IKKβ-NEMO interaction was also evident in in vivo interaction studies of IKKβ with the different NEMO variants (Fig. 3C, lane 4) in co-immunoprecipitation assays, whereas the S68E-NEMO-IKKα interaction was only slightly reduced (Fig. 3B, lane 4). Interestingly, a similar negative effect on the IKKα interaction was also observed with the S85C-NEMO mutant (Fig. 3B, lane 8). Moreover, the S68A-NEMO mutant displayed an enhanced IKKβ interaction as shown in a head-to-head comparison of wild-type NEMO, S68E-, and S68A-NEMO (Fig. 3D, a quantification of three independent experiments is given on the right part). However, because under these experimental conditions additional post-translational modifications of the ectopic expressed NEMO proteins could influence the interaction with the IKKs, we performed another in vitro interaction study where we compared the interaction of in vitro translated IKKα or IKKβ with bacterial expressed GST-NEMO wild-type, S68A, or S68E (Fig. 3E). Again, we observed a negative effect on the IKKβ interaction only in case of S68E-NEMO (Fig. 3E, lane 8). In summary, we concluded from these interaction studies that both protein-protein interactions mediated by the IBD, the NEMO dimerization, and the interaction with IKKβ, are negatively affected by the phosphorylation of Ser68 or by substitution of Ser68 with a glutamate residue, whereas binding of NEMO to IKKα is only modestly affected. Ser68 Is a Phospho-acceptor Site in Vivo—In a previous study serine 43, but not serine 68, has been identified as major in vivo IKKβ target site in NEMO (14Carter R.S. Pennington K.N. Ungurait B.J. Ballard D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19642-19648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Given the specific importance of the Ser68 phosphorylation for the NEMO dimerization and the NEMO-IKKβ interaction, we next asked whether Ser68 is also a phospho-acceptor site in vivo. Although the increased NEMO dimerization (Fig. 2) and IKKβ-NEMO interaction (Fig. 3E) observed with S68A-NEMO already suggested a basal in vivo phosphorylation of Ser68, we also wanted to prove the in vivo phosphorylation of NEMO at Ser68 more formally. For this, 293 HEK cells, transiently transfected with expression vectors for either wild-type FLAG-NEMO, FLAG-S68A-NEMO, or, as a control, FLAG-S43A-NEMO, were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and stimulated with TNF-α for the indicated time points prior to an anti-FLAG IP. As shown in Fig. 4A, all NEMO variants used display a high basal phosphorylation status. Interestingly, the basal phosphorylation of S68A-NEMO was even slightly enhanced. Because we observed in a similar in vivo phosphorylation experiment a strong reduction of the basal NEMO phosphorylation by co-transfection of a dominant negative mutant of IKKβ (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 2 and 3), we concluded that the basal"

Prevention or reversal of muscle atrophy by stimulation of skeletal muscle growth could be an important therapeutic strategy. Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) has been implicated in the negative regulation of skeletal muscle growth. Since myogenic differentiation is an essential part of muscle growth, we investigated if inhibition of GSK-3β is sufficient to stimulate myogenic differentiation and whether this depended on regulation of the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT). In both myogenically converted mouse embryonic fibroblasts and C2C12 myoblasts, deficiency of GSK-3β protein (activity) resulted in enhanced myotube formation and muscle-specific gene expression during differentiation, which was reversed by reintroduction of wild type but not kinase-inactive (K85R) GSK-3β. In addition, GSK-3β inhibition restored myogenic differentiation following calcineurin blockade, which suggested the involvement of NFAT. GSK-3β-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts or myoblasts displayed enhanced nuclear translocation of NFATc3 and elevated NFAT-sensitive promoter transactivation, which was reduced by reintroducing wild type, but not K85R GSK-3β. Overexpression of NFATc3 increased muscle gene promoter transactivation, which was abolished by co-expression of wild type GSK-3β. Finally, stimulation of muscle gene expression observed following GSK-3β inhibition was strongly attenuated in NFATc3-deficient myoblasts, indicating that this response requires NFATc3. Collectively, our data demonstrate negative regulation of myogenic differentiation by GSK-3β through a transcriptional mechanism that depends on NFATc3.

To restore muscle mass and improve muscle function in various diseases conditions, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of skeletal muscle (re)growth is required. Skeletal muscle differentiation is a critical element of certain types of postnatal growth of the skeletal musculature and is mainly dependent on satellite cells (quiescent myoblasts), which upon activation proliferate, differentiate, and fuse with existing muscle fibers or with each other to form new myofibers (4Allen D.L.

In this study, we hypothesized that inhibition of GSK-3β increases myogenic differentiation by promoting NFATc3 nuclear localization and transcriptional activity. Two different myogenic models were employed to examine the effects of genetic modulation of GSK-3β on skeletal muscle differentiation and NFAT regulation. The results revealed negative regulation of myogenic differentiation by GSK-3β through suppression of NFATc3 nuclear localization and subsequent inhibition of NFATc3-mediated muscle gene transcription. Cell Culture—The murine skeletal muscle cell line C2C12 obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC number CRL1772) was cultured in growth medium (GM), composed of low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing antibiotics (50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin) and 9% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) (all from Invitrogen), or differentiation medium (DM), which contained low glucose DMEM with 0.5% heat-inactivated FBS and antibiotics. Wild type and GSK-3β-/- mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) (26Hoeflich K.P. Luo J. Rubie E.A. Tsao M.S. Jin O. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 2000; 406: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar) cell lines were generously provided by Dr. J. R. Woodgett (Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Canada) and cultured in GM or DM, which contained high glucose DMEM with 0.5% heat-inactivated FBS and antibiotics. Both cell types were grown on Matrigel (BD Biosciences)-coated (1:50 in DMEM) dishes as described previously (27Langen R.C. Van Der Velden J.L. Schols A.M. Kelders M.C. Wouters E.F. Janssen-Heininger Y.M. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Cells were plated at 104/cm2 and cultured in GM for 24 h before transfection or induction of differentiation. When applicable, lithium chloride (LiCl) (Sigma) or FK506 (Fujisawa Pharmaceuticals) was added directly after induction of differentiation and again 24 h later when the cells were provided with fresh DM. Transfections and Plasmids—Transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000™ (Invitrogen) or Nanofectin (PAA, Pasching, Austria) according to manufacturers' instructions. Troponin I (TnI)-luciferase plasmid, kindly provided by Dr. Albert Baldwin (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC), was used as a reporter for the activity of muscle-specific transcription factors (0.25 μg/transfection). An NFAT-sensitive luciferase plasmid (28Yang J. Rothermel B. Vega R.B. Frey N. McKinsey T.A. Olson E.N. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: E61-E68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) used as a reporter for NFAT transcriptional activity (0.25 μg/transfection) and plasmids encoding NFATc3, a constitutively activated form of NFATc3 (29van Rooij E. Doevendans P.A. de Theije C.C. Babiker F.A. Molkentin J.D. de Windt L.J. J. Biol.

Plasmids encoding GSK-3β, GSK-3β S9A, and GSK-3β K85R were kindly provided by Dr. S Sokol (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) (30Dominguez I. Itoh K. Sokol S.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8498-8502Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). pSV-β-gal (0.25 μg/transfection) was employed to correct for differences in transfection efficiency (Promega, Madison, WI). To determine luciferase and β-galactosidase activity, cells were lysed in luciferase lysis buffer and stored at -80 °C. Luciferase (Promega, Madison, WI) and β-galactosidase (Tropix, Bedford, MA) were measured according to the manufacturers' instructions. RNA Interference and Retroviral Infection—Vectors expressing hairpin small interference RNAs were constructed by inserting pairs of annealed, HindIII/BglII-digested oligonucleotides containing the 19-nt target sequence into the pRetro-Super (pRS) vector (31Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3968) Google Scholar, 32Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 243-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. R. Agami (The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam). Ecotropic retroviral supernatants were produced by transfection of phoenix packaging cells (Dr. G. Nolan, Stanford University), cultured in high glucose DMEM containing antibiotics (50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin) and 9% (v/v) FBS, with the pRS GSK-3β shRNA vector or the pRS control vector by calcium phosphate precipitation. 48 h post-transfection, the tissue culture medium was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, and supernatant containing the viral particles was used for infection of C2C12 cells after the addition of 4 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). Cells were infected for at least 6 h and allowed to recover for 24 h with fresh GM. Infected cells were selected with puromycin (2.5 μg/ml) for at least 96 h, and silencing efficacy was evaluated by Western blot analysis for GSK-3β or NFATc3, respectively, and tubulin as a loading control. Of the three target sequences tested, the pRS vector containing the 19-nt target sequence 5′-GTTGTATATGTATCAGCTG-3′ demonstrated the strongest RNA silencing for GSK-3β, whereas the targeting sequence 5′-TACTAGAGTCCGACTTGTA-3′ proved most successful in NFATc3 silencing. Western Blotting—GSK-3β, tubulin, or NFATc3 protein abundance was evaluated by Western blotting. Adherent cells were washed in PBS, and whole cell lysates were prepared by the addition of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1% (v/v) aprotinin). Lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min, followed by 30-min centrifugation at 16,000 × g. For nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, adherent cells were washed in PBS, and the cytoplasm fraction was prepared by the addition of buffer C (10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.2 mm NaF). After a 15-min incubation on ice, lysates were spun for 5 min (10,000 × g) at 4 °C. Supernatant containing the cytoplasm fraction was saved, and the pellet, containing the nuclear fraction, was washed once with buffer C and resuspended in buffer N (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 160 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.2 mm NaF). Nuclear lysates were incubated for 30 min on a rotating platform at 4 °C and spun (16,000 × g) for 15 min at 4 °C. A fraction of the supernatant was saved for protein determination, and 4× Laemmli sample buffer (0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8% (w/v) SDS, 40% (v/v) glycerol, 0.4 m dithiothreitol, and 0.04% (w/v) bromphenol blue) was added, followed by boiling of the samples for 5 min and storage at -20 °C. Total protein was assessed by the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and 5–30 μg of protein was loaded per lane and separated on a 7 or 10% polyacrylamide gel (Mini Protean 3 System; Bio-Rad), followed by electroblot transfer to a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 5% (w/v) nonfat, dried milk. Nitrocellulose blots were washed in PBS-Tween 20 (0.05%), followed by overnight incubation (4 °C) with a polyclonal antibody specific for either GSK-3β 1:1000 (catalog number 9315; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) or NFATc3 1:500 (catalog number sc-8321; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or a monoclonal antibody α-tubulin 1:500 (catalog number sc-8035; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After three wash steps of 20 min each, the blots were probed with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, 1:5000 (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and visualized by Supersignal® WestPico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Assessment of Myogenic Differentiation—Myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells was assessed biochemically via determination of muscle creatine kinase (MCK) activity and morphologically by determination of the myogenic index. For MCK activity, cells grown and differentiated in 35-mm dishes for 72 h were washed twice in cold PBS, lysed in 0.5% Triton X-100, and scraped off of the dish with a rubber policeman. Lysates were centrifuged for 2 min at 16,000 × g, and the supernatant was stored in separate aliquots at -80 °C for determination of protein content or MCK activity in the presence of 1% bovine serum albumin. MCK activity was measured using a spectophotometry-based (33Szasz G. Gruber W. Bernt E. Clin. Chem. 1976; 22: 650-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) kit from Stanbio (Stanbio, Boerne, TX). Specific MCK activity was calculated after correction for total protein, which was assessed by the Bradford method (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). To quantify myoblast fusion, the myogenic index, defined as the number of nuclei residing in cells containing three or more nuclei divided by the total number of nuclei, was determined in May-Grunwald Giemsa-stained cells. Cells were grown on Matrigel-coated 60-mm dishes, and after 72 h in differentiation medium, cells were washed twice in PBS (room temperature), fixed in methanol and stained in May-Grunwald Giemsa (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The myogenic index was assessed by counting five fields/60-mm dish (n = 3) at a ×100 magnification, and the total number of nuclei analyzed was 300–500/field. RNA Isolation and Assessment of mRNA Abundance—Total RNA from C2C12 cells was isolated using the Totally RNA™ kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After isolation, RNA was dissolved in 1 mm sodium citrate (pH 6.4) and stored at -80 °C. One μg of RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using the Reverse iT First Strand Synthesis kit (ABgene, Epsom, UK) with anchored oligo(dT) primers. MCK and β-actin mRNA were determined by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR primers were designed using Primer Express 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and obtained from Sigma Genosys (Haverhill, UK). MCK was amplified using the following primers: MCK FP, 5′-AGGTTTTCCGCCGCTTCT-3′; RP, 5′-CGGTGCCCAGGTTGGA-3′. PCRs (25 μl total volume) contained 1× MasterMix Plus for SYBR green I (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) and primers (300 nm). Standard curves were made in duplicate by performing serial dilutions of pooled cDNA aliquots. Ct values were obtained for each sample, and the relative DNA concentrations were derived from the standard curve. The expression of the genes of interest was normalized to β-actin (primers obtained from Ambion). Real time PCRs were performed in an ABI PRISM™ 7700 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems). Immunofluorescence—GSK-3β shRNA or control pRS-C2C12 myoblasts were grown on glass coverslips and were fixed and stained after 24 or 48 h of culture in DM for NFATc3 using a polyclonal antibody 1:100 (catalog number sc-8321; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-fluorophore-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody, 1:1000 (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands). Nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (20 μg/ml). Images were taken at a ×400 magnification, using a fluorescent microscope connected to a digital DXM 1200F camera, both from Nikon (Kanagawa, Japan). Enhanced Myogenic Conversion of Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts in the Absence of GSK-3β—Myogenic conversion of fibroblasts by overexpression of the muscle regulatory factor MyoD is a useful tool to study activation of muscle-specific gene transcription (35Weintraub H. Tapscott S.J. Davis R.L. Thayer M.J. Adam M.A. Lassar A.B. Miller A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5434-5438Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). To address the suppressive effects of endogenous GSK-3β on myogenesis by genetic rather than pharmacological modulation, we compared myogenic conversion of GSK-3β-/- and WT MEFs by measuring transactivation of the troponin-I (TnI) promoter. MEFs lacking endogenous GSK-3β displayed increased TnI promoter transactivation compared with WT MEFs (Fig. 1A). Moreover, restoring GSK-3β expression by co-transfecting GSK-3β-/- MEFs with a plasmid encoding WT GSK-3β decreased TnI promoter transactivation, whereas expression of a kinase-dead mutant (K85R) did not show any effects (Fig. 1B). This finding demonstrates that GSK-3β kinase activity suppresses muscle-specific gene transcription, suggesting a negative regulatory role for GSK-3β in myogenic differentiation. GSK-3β Knockdown Stimulates Differentiation of Skeletal Muscle Cells—Since genetic ablation of GSK-3β in mice results in embryonic lethality (26Hoeflich K.P. Luo J. Rubie E.A. Tsao M.S. Jin O. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 2000; 406: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar), we investigated the effects of acute loss of GSK-3β upon myogenic differentiation, using RNA interference (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of GSK-3β in C2C12 cells. In myoblasts transduced with pRETRO-SUPER (pRS)-GSK-3β shRNA or pRS-control, an ∼75% decrease of GSK-3β protein was observed in shGSK-3β compared with control C2C12 myoblasts (Fig. 2A). After differentiation for 72 h, shGSK-3β cells displayed enhanced myotube formation compared with control pRS cells (Fig. 2B), which was reflected by a 2-fold increase in the myogenic index (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, GSK-3β knockdown resulted in increased MCK activity compared with pRS-control C2C12 cells (Fig. 3D). MCK mRNA expression was also strongly up-regulated in shGSK-3β compared with control myoblasts during myogenic differentiation (Fig. 2E), suggesting a direct transcriptional effect of GSK-3β loss on MCK expression rather than modulation at the post-transcriptional level. This finding clearly shows that loss of GSK-3β signaling positively affects myogenic differentiation.FIGURE 3Inhibition of GSK-3β overcomes repression of myogenic differentiation by calcineurin blockade. Myoblasts were cultured in DM in the presence or absence of FK506. After 72 h, lysates were prepared for determination of MCK activity and total protein, and MCK activity was expressed as specific enzyme activity (A). Alternatively, myoblasts were differentiated in the presence of FK506 (50 ng/ml) and/or LiCl (10 mm), and MCK activity (B) or MCK mRNA abundance (C) was determined. Shown are representative graphs of three independent experiments (n = 3 ± S.E.).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Inhibition of GSK-3β Overcomes Repression of Myogenic Differentiation by Calcineurin Blockade—The activity of the transcriptional regulator NFAT is dependent on the balance between inhibitory phosphorylation by GSK-3β and stimulatory dephosphorylation by calcineurin (12Beals C.R. Sheridan C.M. Turck C.W. Gardner P. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1930-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Previous reports have revealed that calcineurin activity is required for muscle differentiation (22Dunn S.E. Burns J.L. Michel R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21908-21912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). To establish whether pharmacological inhibition of calcineurin resulted in repression of myogenic differentiation in our model, C2C12 myoblasts were cultured in DM for 72 h with or without the calcineurin inhibitor FK506, and MCK activity was assessed. MCK was significantly decreased in a dose-dependent fashion in response to FK506 (Fig. 3A). In contrast, pharmacological inhibition of GSK-3β by LiCl resulted in increased MCK activity (Fig. 3B) and MCK mRNA abundance (Fig. 3C) (10van der Velden J.L. Langen R.C. Kelders M.C. Wouters E.F. Janssen-Heininger Y.M. Schols A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: C453-C462Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Simultaneous inhibition of GSK-3β and calcineurin completely prevented the repressive effect of calcineurin blockade on myogenic differentiation based on assessment of MCK enzyme activity (Fig. 3B) and MCK mRNA abundance (Fig. 3C). These data demonstrate that calcineurin and GSK-3β have opposing effects on myoblast differentiation, which may be conveyed through their mutual phosphosubstrate NFAT, which has been implicated in myogenic differentiation (24Delling U. Tureckova J. Lim H.W. De Windt L.J. Rotwein P. Molkentin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6600-6611Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). GSK-3β Suppresses NFATc3 Nuclear Localization in Skeletal Muscle Cells—Next, NFATc3 nuclear localization was assessed in myoblasts by immunostaining during differentiation. Nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. pRS-shGSK-3β C2C12 cells showed a marked increase in NFATc3 nuclear localization compared with control pRS cells in which NFATc3 mainly resided in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4A). Increased NFATc3 nuclear abundance in GSK-3β shRNA compared with control pRS-C2C12 cells was confirmed by Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts (Fig. 4B). Total NFATc3 abundance in whole cell extracts was not different between the cells (data not shown). This finding demonstrates that increased myogenic differentiation of myoblasts in absence of GSK-3β is associated with increased NFATc3 nuclear localization. GSK-3β Controls NFATc3 Transcriptional Activation—To further examine the functional consequences of NFATc3 nuclear exclusion by GSK-3β, NFATc3 was transiently overexpressed in GSK-3β-/- and WT MEFs together with a NFAT-sensitive promoter reporter construct. Overexpression of NFATc3 induced NFAT transcriptional activation to greater extent in GSK-3β-deficient compared with WT MEFs (Fig. 5A). As expected, pharmacological inhibition of GSK-3β by LiCl further enhanced NFAT transcriptional activity in WT MEFs but not in GSK-3β-/- MEFs (Fig. 5A). To evaluate whether NFAT transcriptional activity is also suppressed by GSK-3β in skeletal muscle cells, C2C12 cells were transiently transfected with the NFAT reporter construct and NFATc3. Overexpression of NFATc3 caused a strong increase of NFAT transcriptional activation, which was further increased by inhibition of endogenous GSK-3β using LiCl (Fig. 5B). Co-transfection of NFATc3 with plasmids encoding WT GSK-3β but not kinase-inactive (K85R) GSK-3β decreased NFAT transcriptional activation, whereas transcriptional activity of a nonphosphorylatable muta"
https://openalex.org/W2084178943,"The mechanism of angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced superoxide production was investigated with HEK293 or Chinese hamster ovary cells reconstituted with the angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) and NADPH oxidase (either Nox1 or Nox2) along with a pair of adaptor subunits (either NOXO1 with NOXA1 or p47phox with p67phox). Ang II enhanced the activity of both Nox1 and Nox2 supported by either adaptor pair, with more effective activation of Nox1 in the presence of NOXO1 and NOXA1 and of Nox2 in the presence of p47phox and p67phox. Expression of several AT1R mutants showed that interaction of the receptor with G proteins but not that with β-arrestin or with other proteins (Jak2, phospholipase C-γ1, SH2 domain-containing phosphatase 2) that bind to the COOH-terminal region of AT1R, was necessary for Ang II-induced superoxide production. The effects of constitutively active α subunits of G proteins and of various pharmacological agents implicated signaling by a pathway comprising AT1R, Gαq/11, phospholipase C-β, and protein kinase C as largely, but not exclusively, responsible for Ang II-induced activation of Nox1 and Nox2 in the reconstituted cells. A contribution of Gα12/13, phospholipase D, and phosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinase to Ang II-induced superoxide generation was also suggested, whereas Src and the epidermal growth factor receptor did not appear to participate in this effect of Ang II. In reconstituted cells stimulated with Ang II, Nox2 exhibited a more sensitive response than Nox1 to the perturbation of protein kinase C, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, or the small GTPase Rac1. The mechanism of angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced superoxide production was investigated with HEK293 or Chinese hamster ovary cells reconstituted with the angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) and NADPH oxidase (either Nox1 or Nox2) along with a pair of adaptor subunits (either NOXO1 with NOXA1 or p47phox with p67phox). Ang II enhanced the activity of both Nox1 and Nox2 supported by either adaptor pair, with more effective activation of Nox1 in the presence of NOXO1 and NOXA1 and of Nox2 in the presence of p47phox and p67phox. Expression of several AT1R mutants showed that interaction of the receptor with G proteins but not that with β-arrestin or with other proteins (Jak2, phospholipase C-γ1, SH2 domain-containing phosphatase 2) that bind to the COOH-terminal region of AT1R, was necessary for Ang II-induced superoxide production. The effects of constitutively active α subunits of G proteins and of various pharmacological agents implicated signaling by a pathway comprising AT1R, Gαq/11, phospholipase C-β, and protein kinase C as largely, but not exclusively, responsible for Ang II-induced activation of Nox1 and Nox2 in the reconstituted cells. A contribution of Gα12/13, phospholipase D, and phosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinase to Ang II-induced superoxide generation was also suggested, whereas Src and the epidermal growth factor receptor did not appear to participate in this effect of Ang II. In reconstituted cells stimulated with Ang II, Nox2 exhibited a more sensitive response than Nox1 to the perturbation of protein kinase C, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, or the small GTPase Rac1.

Engagement of AT1R elicits a complex network of signaling cascades that result in short-term vascular effects, such as contraction, as well as long-term effects, such as cell growth, migration, and adhesion, that eventually lead to pathophysiological vascular remodeling and cardiac hypertrophy (1de Gasparo M.

The earliest response to Ang II is Gαq-mediated activation of phospholipase C (PLC)-β, which is followed by Ca2+ mobilization and activation of protein kinase C (PKC) (3Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar). In addition to this pathway, activation of Src family kinases occurs within seconds of Ang II stimulation and appears to be achieved through G protein-dependent and -independent signaling mechanisms (1de Gasparo M.

Many other signaling molecules, including Janus family kinases (Jaks), the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), mitogen-activated protein kinases, phospholipase D (PLD), and phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, are activated subsequent to the activation of PLC-β and Src. angiotensin II angiotensin type 1 receptor phospholipase C phospholipase D protein kinase C Janus family kinase epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor phosphatidylinositol reactive oxygen species autoinhibitory domain NADPH oxidase Nox organizer 1 Nox activator 1 phox homology vascular smooth muscle cell phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate SH2 domain-containing phosphatase 2 diacylglycerol median inhibitory concentration PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate guanine nucleotide exchange factor reverse transcription chemiluminescence vascular smooth muscle cell Chinese hamster ovary human embryonic kidney cells small interfering RNA Ang II also induces activation of NADPH oxidase and the consequent production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (5Griendling K.K.

Nox of phagocytes is a multicomponent enzyme whose activity requires assembly of the cytosolic subunits p47phox and p67phox and the small GTPase Rac2 with a membrane-associated heterodimer of p22phox and gp91phox. Among these components, gp91phox mediates electron transfer from NADPH to molecular oxygen to produce superoxide, which is then spontaneously or enzymatically converted to H2O2. Activation of gp91phox requires stimulus-induced translocation of p47phox, p67phox, and Rac2 to the plasma membrane. In resting cells, p47phox and p67phox are present in a cytosolic complex, and their membrane translocation is dependent on phosphorylation of multiple serine residues in p47phox by several kinases including PKC and Akt (18Inanami O.

Phosphorylation of p47phox occurs in an autoinhibitory domain (AID) and induces a conformational change that renders the tandem SH3 domains competent to bind a proline-rich region of p22phox, the partner of gp91phox (10Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Bokoch G.M. Knaus U.G. Trends Biochem.

This conformational change also exposes the phox homology (PX) domain of p47phox, which specifically recognizes 3′-phosphorylated phosphoinositides, the products of PI 3-kinase. Cell stimulation also induces the conversion of GDP-bound Rac2 to the GTP-bound form and its resulting recruitment to the NADPH oxidase complex, where it interacts with p67phox and gp91phox. Multiple homologs of gp91phox (which has been renamed Nox2) have been identified in nonphagocytic cells (13Lambeth J.D. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (2468) Google Scholar, 14Quinn M.T. Gauss K.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 76: 760-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 15Bedard K. Krause K.H. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 245-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (4963) Google Scholar). Among the seven members of Nox family, Nox1 is both structurally and functionally similar to Nox2. Rac and p22phox are present in almost all cell types examined, whereas expression of p47phox and p67phox is largely restricted to mature phagocytes. The presence in most cell types of one or more Nox enzymes nevertheless suggested the possibility that homologs of p47phox and p67phox might be expressed in nonphagocytic cells. Such homologs were subsequently identified (20Takeya R. Ueno N. Kami K. Taura M. Kohjima M. Izaki T. Nunoi H. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25234-25246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 21Geiszt M. Lekstrom K. Witta J. Leto T.L. J. Biol.

The p47phox homolog is referred to as Nox organizer 1 (NOXO1) and the p67phox homolog as Nox activator 1 (NOXA1). Both NOXO1 and NOXA1 possess domain organizations almost identical to their respective homologs, with the exception that NOXO1 does not contain an AID. NOXO1, thus, interacts with p22phox via its SH3 domains and with NOXA1 via its proline-rich carboxyl-terminal domain, whereas NOXA1 interacts with GTP-bound Rac (20Takeya R. Ueno N. Kami K. Taura M. Kohjima M. Izaki T. Nunoi H. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25234-25246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Transfection experiments have shown that NOXO1 and NOXA1 reconstitute with Nox1 to produce ROS in a p22phox-dependent manner (20Takeya R. Ueno N. Kami K. Taura M. Kohjima M. Izaki T. Nunoi H.

As predicted from the similarities to their phagocyte homologs, NOXO1 and NOXA1 are able to substitute for p47phox and p67phox, respectively, in the activation Nox2. Nevertheless, NOXO1 and NOXA1 activate Nox1 more effectively than they do Nox2, whereas p47phox and p67phox activate Nox2 more effectively (20Takeya R. Ueno N. Kami K. Taura M. Kohjima M. Izaki T.

Unlike p47phox, NOXO1 is localized at the cell membrane even in the absence of stimulatory signals (24Cheng G. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4737-4742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), probably because it lacks an AID, which blocks the SH3 domains of p47phox from interacting with p22phox in the absence of phosphorylation. The phosphoinositide binding specificity of the PX domain of NOXO1 also differs from that of the PX domain of p47phox; the NOXO1 domain binds to monophosphorylated forms of PI such as PI 4-phosphate and PI 5-phosphate, which are abundant in nonactivated cells (24Cheng G. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4737-4742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). NOXO1 is, thus, capable of activating Nox1 and Nox2 even without cell stimulation when coexpressed with p67phox or NOXA1. NOXO1 also activates Nox3 in a manner independent of NOXA1 (13Lambeth J.D. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (2468) Google Scholar). Nox4 appears to be constitutively active in the absence of NOXO1 and NOXA1 (25Geiszt M. Kopp J.B. Varnai P. Leto T.L.

Krause K.H. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 245-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (4963) Google Scholar). There are some hints for the functional coupling between Nox1 and AT1R; Nox1 is up-regulated upon Ang II stimulation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) (31Lassegue B. Sorescu D. Szocs K. Yin Q.

Given that coexpression of Nox1 with NOXO1 and NOXA1 is sufficient for a substantial level of activity in the absence of extracellular stimulation, it is important to determine whether Ang II is able to elicit further activation of this complex. It is also important to know if Ang II is able to activate Nox2. If so, the mechanism responsible for such receptor-mediated activation is also of interest. To address these issues, we have now transfected HEK293 and CHO cells with expression vectors for AT1R and the various components of the Nox1 and Nox2 system and have characterized the oxidative responses of these reconstituted models in response to Ang II stimulation. Although Nox4 is highly expressed in vascular cells, this distant homolog of Nox1 and Nox2 is not included in this study because its activation neither requires cytosolic subunits nor needs cell stimulation upon heterologous expression (25Geiszt M.

However, whether cellular responses to nucleoside analogue-induced DNA damage also operate through p53 posttranslational modification has not been reported. In this study, the relationship between p53 activation and its posttranslational modifications was investigated in the human cancer cell lines A549 and HCT116 in response to 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR) or cytarabine treatment. 5-Aza-CdR induces p53 posttranslational modifications through activation of an ATM- and Rad3-related (ATR) signaling pathway, and 5-aza-CdR-induced association of replication protein A with chromatin is required for the binding of ATR to chromatin. Upon treatment with 5-aza-CdR, ATR activation is clearly associated with p53 phosphorylation at Ser15, but not at Thr18, Ser20, or Ser37. This specific p53 phosphorylation at Ser15 in turn results in acetylation of p53 at Lys320 and Lys373/Lys382 through transcriptional cofactors p300/CBP-associated factor and p300, respectively. These p53 posttranslational modifications are directly responsible for 5-aza-CdR induced p21Waf1/Cip1 expression because the binding activity of acetylated p53 at Lys320/Lys373/Lys382 to the p21Waf1/Cip1 promoter, as well as p21Waf1/Cip1 expression itself are significantly increased after 5-aza-CdR treatment. It is of interest that p53 phosphorylation at Ser15 and acetylations at Lys320/Lys373/Lys382 mutually interact in the 5-aza-CdR induced p21Waf1/Cip1 expression shown by transfection of artificially mutated p53 expression vectors including S15A, K320R, and K373R/K382R into p53-null H1299 cells. These data taken together show for the first time that 5-aza-CdR activates the ATR signaling pathway, which elicits a specific p53 phosphorylation-acetylation cascade to induce p21Waf1/Cip1 expression.

Recently, it was reported that p53 C-terminal phosphorylation also modulates C-terminal acetylation in response to DNA damage (38Ou Y.H. Chung P.H. Sun T.P. Shieh S.Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1684-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, the latter study offered little information as to whether acetylation site mutation of p53 influences the phosphorylation status of p53 after DNA damage (39Knights C.D. Catania J. Giovanni S.D. Muratoglu S. Perez R. Swartzbeck A. Quong A.A. Zhang X. Beerman T. Pestell R.G. Avantaggiati M.L. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). These reports imply that different stimuli leading to DNA damage may induce different p53 posttranslational modifications, and there may be an obligatory parallel increase in p53 phosphorylation and acetylation for p53 to exert its function. Thus, understanding the sequence of events of p53 phosphorylation and acetylation may give greater insight into p53 function and help guide applications of p53 in clinical therapy. Although the nucleoside analogue 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR) is currently used in epigenetic research, its original role was as an antineoplastic agent because it is readily incorporated into DNA (40Covey J.M. D'Incalci M. Tilchen E.J. Zaharko D.S. Kohn K.W. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 5511-5517PubMed Google Scholar). It is distinct from other inducers of DNA damage, such as radiation and UV light; nucleoside analogue-induced DNA damage usually results in a single-stranded break in DNA (40Covey J.M. D'Incalci M. Tilchen E.J. Zaharko D.S. Kohn K.W. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 5511-5517PubMed Google Scholar, 41D'Incalci M. Covey J.M. Zaharko D.S. Kohn K.W. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 3197-3202PubMed Google Scholar). Although our previous data and that of others have demonstrated that 5-aza-CdR activates the p53/p21Waf1/Cip1 pathway through DNA damage (42Karpf A.R. Moore B.C. Ririe T.O. Jones D.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 43Zhu W.G. Hileman T. Ke Y. Wang P. Lu S. Duan W. Dai Z. Tong T. Villalona-Calero M.A. Plass C. Otterson G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15161-15166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), the mechanism by which nucleoside analogues induce activation of p53/p21Waf1/Cip1 has not been worked out yet. Hence, it is of particular interest to determine whether nucleoside analogue 5-aza-CdR or Ara-C induces p53 activation through a specific pathway and evokes specific p53 posttranslational modifications. In this study, our data indicate that 5-aza-CdR activates p53 through the PI3K pathway, which in turn induces p53 posttranslational modifications including phosphorylation at Ser15 and acetylation at Lys320 and Lys373/Lys382. These posttranslational modifications are required for p53 to activate its downstream target gene p21Waf1/Cip1. More importantly, a mutual causal relationship between phosphorylation and acetylation of p53 at specific sites was confirmed in p53 activation as well as by p21Waf1/Cip1 expression in response to 5-aza-CdR treatment. Cell Culture and Nucleoside Analogue Treatment—Human lung cancer cell lines A549 and H1299 were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (heat-inactivated at 56 °C for 45 min) and penicillin/streptomycin, in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. The cells were treated with 5-aza-CdR (0.01–5 μm, Sigma) for up to 72 h or with Ara-C (0.1–5 μm, Sigma) for up to 48 h. Fresh medium containing chemicals was added every 24 h. Subcellular Fraction—The cellular protein fractionation was performed as described previously (44Zou L. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) with modifications. In brief, the cells were lysed in solution A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 420 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.34 m sucrose, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitor mixture). To obtain nuclear extracts, the cells were lysed in buffer B (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.34 m sucrose, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor mixture). Isolated nuclei were washed once with buffer B and further lysed in buffer A as above. To obtain chromatin-bound proteins, the isolated nuclei were lysed in buffer C (3 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and further lysed in buffer A as above. Western Blot—Protein expression was evaluated by Western blotting as previously described, with minor modifications (43Zhu W.G. Hileman T. Ke Y. Wang P. Lu S. Duan W. Dai Z. Tong T. Villalona-Calero M.A. Plass C. Otterson G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15161-15166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were harvested with a scraper and then washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 0.15% Igepal CA-630, and 1.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Equal amounts of proteins (100–150 μg) were size-fractionated by 6–12.5% SDS-PAGE. The antibodies used were anti-p21Waf1/Cip1 (F-5; Santa Cruz), anti-p53 (DO-1; Santa Cruz), anti-p53 (P240; Santa Cruz), anti-PCAF (C-16; Santa Cruz), anti-p300 (H-272; Santa Cruz), anti-CBP (A-22; Santa Cruz), anti-ubiquitin (P4D1; Santa Cruz), anti-RPA32 (Santa Cruz), anti-RPA70 (Santa Cruz), anti-β-actin (Huatesheng Biotechnology, Fushun, China), anti-Lys373/382-p53 and anti-Lys320-p53 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-Ser15, anti-Thr18, anti-Ser20, and anti-Ser37 (Cell Signaling). RNA Interference—RNAi mediated knockdown of ATM and ATR was performed as described previously (45Shiotani B. Kobayashi M. Watanabe M. Yamamoto K. Sugimura T. Wakabayashi K. Mol. Cancer Res. 2006; 4: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), with synthetic siRNA duplexes as follows: ATM, AAGCGCCUGAUUCGAGAUCCU; ATR, AAGACGGUGUGCUCAUGCGGC; and silencing control, AAUUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU. The sequence of RPA70 siRNA is AACACUCUAUCCUCUUUCAUG. A549 cells were transfected with 100 nmol/liter siRNA and analyzed at 72 h after transfection. Site-directed Mutagenesis—p53 mutant constructs (S15A, K320R, and K373R/K382R) were generated using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (QuikChange; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A wild-type p53 expression vector (pCIneo with full-length p53 cDNA) (43Zhu W.G. Hileman T. Ke Y. Wang P. Lu S. Duan W. Dai Z. Tong T. Villalona-Calero M.A. Plass C. Otterson G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15161-15166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) was used as the mutagenesis template. Wild-type p53 was mutated at specific sites, following the manufacturer's directions. Primers used for mutagenesis had the following sequences: p53-15A-up, 5-CGT CGA GCC CCC TCT GAG(GC) TCA GGA AAC ATT TTC AG-3; p53-15A-down, 5-CTG AAA ATG TTT CCT GACT(GC)CA GAG GGG GCT CGA CG-3; p53–320R-up, 5-CTC TCC CCA GCC AAA GAA(CG) GAA ACC ACT GGA TGG AG-3; p53–320R-down, 5-CTC CAT CCA GTG GT T TCTT(CG)CT TTG GCT GGG GAG AG-3; p53–373R-up, 5-CAC CTG AAG TCC AAA AG(A) G GGT CAG TCT ACC TC-3; p53–373R-down, 5-GA GGT AGA CTG ACC CC(T) TTTT GGA CTT CAG GTG-3; p53–382R-up, 5-CTA CCT CCC GCC ATA AAA G(A)AC TCA TGT TCA AGA-3; and p53–382R-down, 5-TCT TGA ACA TGA GTC(T) TTT TAT GGC GGG AGG TAG-3. In these primers, underlined italicized nucleotides indicate the replaced nucleotides, and the nucleotides in parentheses indicate the original nucleotides. Assay for Detecting Ubiquitination of p53—A549 cells were treated with 5-aza-CdR at 1 μm for 48 h (or 5-aza-CdR was omitted as a control) and treated for 6 h with 25 μm proteasome inhibitors N-acetyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-norleucine and MG132 before being harvested. The treated cells were then lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-p53 (P240). The immunoprecipitated proteins were size-fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and Western blot was then performed with anti-ubiquitin. Transient Transfection—Vectors used for transfections in this study include wild-type p53, mutant Lys320 p53, mutant Lys373/Lys382 p53 (lysines were replaced in these sites with arginines), and mutant Ser15 p53 (Ser15 was replaced with alanine). Twenty-four hours prior to transfection, H1299 cells were seeded into 6-well tissue culture plates. On the following day, these cells were transfected with the expression vectors for wild-type p53 or p53 mutants using Qiagen EffecteneR transfection reagent, as recommended by the manufacturer. The cells were then treated with 1 μm 5-aza-CdR for 24 h after transfection and harvested for Western blotting. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—A549 cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C and then washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (1% SDS, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.1, 5 mm EDTA), followed by sonication to an average DNA length of 500–1000 bp. Antibodies were added to each of the samples, which were then rotated at 4 °C overnight. After exposure to protein A beads and incubation overnight at 65 °C to reverse cross-links, the DNA was dissolved in TE buffer and analyzed by PCR. The antibodies anti-p53 (DO-1) and anti-acetylated p53 (Lys373/382 and Lys320) were added into the reaction solution. Primers used for PCR were derived from p21Waf1/Cip1 promoter sequences: 5′-CTCACATCCTCCTTCTTCAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CACACACAGAATCTGACTCCC-3′ (antisense). Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP)—The cells were harvested and then lysed in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, 0.05% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a 1% mixture of protease inhibitors) on ice for 20 min. After centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, antibodies were added to the supernatant for 1 h on ice. Agarose G was added to the samples and mixed by rolling for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing the beads three times with lysis buffer, the pellets were dissolved into 2× SDS loading buffer after centrifugation. The protein was analyzed by Western blotting with various antibodies. Cell Cycle Analysis—H1299 cells were transfected with plasmids (wild-type p53 or different p53 mutants, respectively), and the cells were then treated with 5-aza-CdR at 1 μm for 48 h. The cells were harvested and stained with propidium iodide. The samples were analyzed with flow cytometry (BD FACS Calibur) using BD CellQuest software. 5-Aza-CdR Induces an Increase in p53 through Decreased p53 Ubiquitination—In this study, human lung cancer cell line A549 was treated with 5-aza-CdR at different concentrations for 48 h or at different time intervals at 1 μm, and the expression of p53 was then determined by Western blotting. Both duration- and dose-dependent p53 accumulations were observed in A549 cells (Fig. 1, A and B). Because 5-aza-CdR at 1 μm was found to induce a maximum increase in p53 expression, a dose of 1 μm of 5-aza-CdR was thereafter used in this study. To determine whether 5-aza-CdR induced increase in p53 levels resulted from gene activation, RT-PCR was performed to evaluate transcription of p53 mRNA in 5-aza-CdR-treated cells. However, changes in the amount of p53 mRNA were not detected (Fig. 1C), indicating that 5-aza-CdR-induced p53 accumulation does not result from transcriptional activation. Because the amount of p53 mRNA was unchanged, it seemed likely that accumulation of p53 was the result of decreased proteolytic degradation of the protein. Therefore, to evaluate whether 5-aza-CdR induces changes in the ubiquitination of p53, A549 cells were treated with 5-aza-CdR at 1 μm for 48 h, and proteins were then immunoprecipitated with anti-p53 (P240). Subsequently, anti-ubiquitin was used for performing Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1D, p53-conjugated ubiquitin in 5-aza-CdR-treated cells is greatly decreased compared with those in cells without 5-aza-CdR treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2054182066,"Among the sigma70 family bacterial sigma factors, group 2 sigma factors have similar promoter recognition specificity to group 1 (principal) sigma factors and express and function under specific environmental and physiological conditions. In general, the cyanobacterial genome encodes more than four group 2 sigma factors, and the unicellular Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 (Synechococcus) has five group 2 sigma factors (RpoD2-6). In this study, we analyzed expression of group 2 sigma factors of Synechococcus at both mRNA and protein levels, and we showed that the rpoD3 expression was activated only by high light (1,500 micromol photons m(-2) s(-1)) among the various stress conditions examined. After high light shift, rpoD3 mRNA accumulated transiently within the first 5 min and diminished subsequently, whereas RpoD3 protein increased gradually during the first several hours. We also found that the rpoD3 deletion mutant rapidly lost viability under the same conditions. Analysis of the rpoD3 promoter structure revealed the presence of an HLR1 (high light-responsive element 1) sequence, which was suggested to be responsible for the high light-induced transcription under the control of the NblS (histidine kinase)-RpaB (response regulator) two-component system (Kappell, A. D., and van Waasbergen, L. G. (2007) Arch. Microbiol. 187, 337-342), at +6 to +23 with respect to the transcriptional start site. Here we demonstrated that recombinant RpaB protein specifically bound to HLR1 of the rpoD3 and hliA genes in vitro, and overexpression of a truncated RpaB variant harboring only the phosphoreceiver domain derepressed the transcription in vivo. Thus, we have concluded that phosphorylated RpaB are repressing the rpoD3 and hliA transcription under normal growth conditions, and the RpaB dephosphorylation induced by high light stress results in transcriptional derepression."
https://openalex.org/W2057166785,"The orphan nuclear receptor liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1, NR5A2) has been reported to play a crucial role in early development, in the control of the hepatic inflammatory response, in intestinal cell crypt renewal as well as in bile acid biosynthesis and reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). Here, we report the identification of apolipoprotein M (APOM) as a novel target gene for LRH-1. Using gene-silencing experiments, adenovirus-mediated overexpression, transient transfection, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, it is shown that LRH-1 directly regulates human and mouse APOM transcription by binding to an LRH-1 response element located in the proximal APOM promoter region. In addition, we demonstrate that bile acids suppress APOM expression in a SHP-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting LRH-1 transcriptional activity on the APOM promoter as demonstrated by in vivo ChIP assay. Taken together, our results demonstrate that LRH-1 is a novel regulator of APOM transcription and further extend the role of this orphan nuclear receptor in lipoprotein metabolism and cholesterol homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1974167823,"Potent mammalian cell activation by Gram-negative bacterial endotoxin requires sequential protein-endotoxin and protein-protein interactions involving lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, CD14, MD-2, and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). TLR4 activation requires simultaneous binding of MD-2 to endotoxin (E) and the ectodomain of TLR4. We now describe mutants of recombinant human MD-2 that bind TLR4 and react with E·CD14 but do not support cellular responsiveness to endotoxin. The mutants F121A/K122A MD-2 and Y131A/K132A MD-2 react with E·CD14 only when co-expressed with TLR4. Single mutants K122A and K132A each react with E·CD14 ± TLR4 and promote TLR4-dependent cell activation by endotoxin suggesting that Phe121 and Tyr131 are needed for TLR4-independent transfer of endotoxin from CD14 to MD-2 and also needed for TLR4 activation by bound E·MD-2. The mutant F126A MD-2 reacts as well as wild-type MD-2 with E·CD14 ± TLR4. E·MD-2F126A binds TLR4 with high affinity (Kd ∼ 200 pm) but does not activate TLR4 and instead acts as a potent TLR4 antagonist, inhibiting activation of HEK/TLR4 cells by wild-type E·MD-2. These findings reveal roles of Phe121 and Tyr131 in TLR4-independent interactions of human MD-2 with E·CD14 and, together with Phe126, in activation of TLR4 by bound E·MD-2.

The requirement for simultaneous engagement by MD-2 of endotoxin and TLR4 for receptor activation strongly suggests that MD-2 contains structurally and topologically distinct binding sites for endotoxin and TLR4.

Under these conditions, it is likely that the added endotoxin is present in a variety of physical and biochemical states, including as aggregates of endotoxin ± LBP ± sCD14 and as complexes with lipoproteins (21Kitchens R.L.

With wild-type recombinant human MD-2, efficient transfer of endotoxin monomers from CD14 to MD-2 occurs in solution with or without co-expression of TLR4, thus making it possible to assess separately direct E·CD14-MD-2 interaction and E·CD14 interaction that follows prior engagement of MD-2 with the ectodomain of TLR4. Once formed, a monomeric complex of hexa-acylated endotoxin with wild-type human MD-2, unlike either endotoxin alone or the E·CD14 complex, is a high affinity ligand (Kd ∼ 300 pm) for the ectodomain of TLR4 (TLR4ECD) and a potent agonist for cells expressing TLR4 without MD-2 (7Gioannini T.L. Teghanemt A. Zhang D. Coussens N.P. Dockstader W. Ramaswamy S. Weiss J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4186-4191Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 23Prohinar P. Re F.

In stark contrast to free MD-2, E·MD-2 is functionally stable (2Gioannini T.L. Teghanemt A. Zhang D. Levis E.N. Weiss J.P. J.

Hence, comparison of the ability of wild-type and mutant MD-2 species to react with E·sCD14 (±TLR4ECD) and of the functional properties of isolated E·MD-2 complexes (wild-type and variant) that are formed should provide a more direct and complete appraisal of the structural requirements for MD-2 function. We now describe, using this approach, the identification and characterization of two different classes of MD-2 mutants that bind TLR4 and react with E·CD14 but do not support TLR4-dependent cell activation by endotoxin. One class, exemplified by the mutants F121A/K122A and Y131A/K132A can react with E·CD14 but only when co-expressed with TLR4. A second class, F126A, reacts normally with E·CD14 in the absence of TLR4 to form an E·MD-2 complex that binds avidly to TLR4ECD (Kd ∼ 200 pm) but does not activate TLR4. The stability and functional properties of E·MD-2F126A should make it a valuable tool for understanding the mechanism of TLR4 activation by endotoxin. Materials—LBP and sCD14 were gifts from Xoma (Berkley, CA) and Amgen Corp. (Thousand Oaks, CA), respectively. Insect-derived soluble MD-2 containing a hexapolyhistidine tag on the C-terminal end was prepared as previously described (7Gioannini T.L. Teghanemt A. Zhang D. Coussens N.P. Dockstader W.

Human serum albumin (HSA) was obtained as an E-free, 25% stock solution (Baxter Health Care, Glendale, CA). [3H]lipooligosaccharide (LOS; 25,000cpm/pmol) from an acetate auxotroph of Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B was metabolically labeled and isolated as described (26Giardina P.C. Gioannini T.

Chromatography matrices (Sephacryl HR S200 and S300, Ni FF Sepharose) were purchased from GE Healthcare (Piscataway, NJ). Production of Recombinant Proteins—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells (∼80% confluency in 6-well plates or T75 flask for preparative amounts of material) were transfected with 4 μg (6-well plate) or 20 μg (T75 flask) of DNA using PolyFect reagent (Qiagen). After 12–16 h, plates were rinsed in PBS and 1 ml per well for 6-well plates or 10 ml for T-75 flask of serum-free medium (293 SFM, Invitrogen) + 0.4% HSA ± [3H]LOS·sCD14 (1 nm; see below) were added. Media containing expressed proteins were collected 24–48 h later. Conditioned medium containing secreted TLR4ECD ± MD-2 wild type (wt) or indicated mutants maintained activity to react with [3H]LOS·MD-2 or [3H]LOS·sCD14 for at least 6 months when stored at 4 °C. Expression vectors containing DNA of interest for production of FLAG-TLR4ECD, amino acids 24–634, (pFLAG-CMV-TLR4) and MD-2-FLAG-His (pEF-BOS) as well as MD-2 containing the indicated mutations have been previously described and characterized (27Re F. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23427-23432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) or have been generated according to that protocol. Preparative amounts of wt and F126A MD-2 were generated from infections of High Five insect cells with baculovirus containing the cDNA for either wt human MD-2-His6 or human MD-2F126A inserted into pBAC11 as described previously (7Gioannini T.L.

Preparation of [3H]LOS·Protein Complexes—[3H]LOS aggregates, [3H]LOS·sCD14, and [3H]LOS·MD-2 complexes were prepared as previously described (2Gioannini T.L. Teghanemt A. Zhang D. Levis E.N.

Briefly, [3H]LOS aggregates (Mr > 20 × 106; 25,000 cpm/pmol) were obtained after hot phenol extraction of [3H]LOS, followed by ethanol precipitation of [3H]LOS and ultracentrifugation. Monomeric [3H]LOS·CD14 complexes (Mr, ∼ 60,000) were prepared by incubating [3H]LOS aggregates for 30 min at 37 °C with substoichiometric amounts of LBP (molar ratio 100:1 LOS·LBP) and 1–1.5× molar excess of sCD14 to LOS followed by gel exclusion chromatography (Sephacryl S200, 1.6 cm × 70 cm column) in PBS, pH 7.4, 0.03% HSA to isolate monomeric [3H]LOS·sCD14 complex. [3H]LOS·MD-2-His6 (Mr ∼ 25,000) was generated by treatment of [3H]LOS·sCD14 (10 μg preparative or 10 ng analytical) by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C with High Five insect cell medium containing MD-2-His6 (25 ml preparative or 0.025 ml analytical). Preparative samples were concentrated to 2 ml before application to 1.6 cm × 70 cm Sephacryl S200 column for isolation of [3H]LOS·MD-2. Radiochemical purity of [3H]LOS aggregates, was confirmed by Sephacryl S500 (29Gioannini T.L. Teghanemt A. Zarember K.A. Weiss J.P. J.

Reaction of Secreted MD-2, TLR4ECD, and MD-2/TLR4ECD with [3H]LOS·Protein Complexes—Conditioned serum-free medium of transfected HEK293T cells was harvested after 24 h in culture and used for subsequent incubation with [3H]LOS·sCD14. Alternatively, the culture medium was “spiked” with [3H]LOS·sCD14 (1 nm) at the time of addition of the medium to the transfected cells to permit reaction of MD-2 with [3H]LOS·sCD14 upon secretion. Media harvested without [3H]LOS·sCD14 are denoted as HEK/(secreted recombinant protein)CM, whereas media spiked with [3H]LOS·sCD14 during cell culture are represented as (HEK/recombinant protein(s) secreted + [3H]LOS·sCD14)CM. Media harvested without [3H]LOS·sCD14 were incubated with 1 nm [3H]LOS·sCD14 for 30 min (or 24 h) at 37 °C and then analyzed by gel sieving chromatography. Media spiked with [3H]LOS·sCD14 during cell culture were analyzed directly after harvesting the medium by gel sieving chromatography. Harvested media could be stored at 4 °C without any detectable change in either reactivity with freshly added [3H]LOS·sCD14 or chromatographic profile of [3H]-labeled compounds in “spiked” media. Reaction products were analyzed by Sephacryl HR S200 or S300 (1.6 × 70 cm) chromatography in PBS, pH 7.4, 0.03% HSA as indicated (23Prohinar P. Re F. Widstrom R. Zhang D. Teghanemt A. Weiss J.P.

Fractions (1.0 or 0.5 ml) were collected at a flow rate 0.5 or 0.3 ml/min at room temperature using AKTA Purifier or Explorer 100 FPLC (GE Healthcare). Radioactivity in collected fractions was analyzed by liquid scintillation spectroscopy (Beckman LS liquid scintillation counter). Recoveries of [3H]LOS were ≥ 70% in all cases. All solutions used were pyrogen-free and sterile-filtered. After chromatography, selected fractions were sterile-filtered (0.22 μm) and kept at 4 °C for 3–6 months with no detectable changes in chromatographic or functional properties. To measure the apparent Kd of [3H]LOS·MD-2F126A interactions with TLR4ECD,[3H]LOS·MD-2F126A was incubated with concentrated (8–10×) conditioned medium containing TLR4ECD in a final volume of 0.5 or 1 ml in PBS, pH 7.4, for 30 min at 37°C. The same conditioned medium (containing secreted TLR4ECD) was used with all concentrations of [3H]LOS·MD-2F126A tested for Scatchard analysis. Scatchard analysis was done using GraphPad Prism 4. Immunoblotting—Polyhistidine-labeled wt and mutant MD-2 were detected by SDS-PAGE/immunoblot, using an anti-polyhistidine antibody (Tetra-His antibody, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as previously described (7Gioannini T.L. Teghanemt A. Zhang D. Coussens N.P. Dockstader W. Ramaswamy S. Weiss J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4186-4191Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Samples were electrophoresed (Bio-Rad minigel system) through a 4–15% gradient acrylamide gel (Tris/HEPES/SDS buffer) and transferred to nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose was washed with Tris-buffered saline (TBS), pH 7.5, containing 0.05% Tween-20 and 0.2% Triton X-100 (TBSTT), blocked to reduce nonspecific background with 3% bovine serum albumin in TBSTT for 1 h at 25 °C, and incubated with the anti-His4 antibody in TBSTT overnight. After washing with TBSTT, the blot was incubated with donkey anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad) for 1 h at 25°CinTBS containing 3% goat serum and washed with TBSTT exhaustively. Blots were developed using the Pierce SuperSignal substrate system. HEK293 Cell Activation Assay—HEK293/TLR4 cell lines have been extensively characterized and were cultured as has been previously described (30Yang H. Young D.W. Gusovsky F. Chow J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20861-20866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) or according to recommendations of Invivogen, Inc. For cell activation assays by LOS·sCD14, cells were grown to confluency in a 6-well plate and then transfected with vector (4 μg of DNA) containing wt or mutant MD-2 as described above. After transfection, serum-free medium was added for 24 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2, and 95% humidity. The supernatants were removed; cells were dislodged and seeded in a 96-well plate (1 × 105 cells/well) in triplicate. The cells were then stimulated with 1 nm LOS·sCD14 for 3 h in DMEM, 0.1% HSA. The short incubation time (3 h) was used to preclude significant secretion of MD-2 that could compete with cell surface MD-2/TLR4 for reaction with LOS·sCD14. Supernatants were removed and evaluated for extracellular accumulation of IL-8 by ELISA. For cell activation by LOS·MD-2 containing either wt or F126A MD-2, HEK293 cells ± TLR4 were seeded in a 96-well plate in triplicate (1 × 105 cells/well) and stimulated with increasing concentrations of LOS·MD-2 complex in DMEM, 0.1% HSA for 20 h. Activation of HEK293 cells was assessed by measuring accumulation of extracellular IL-8 by ELISA (BD Clontech, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Assay of Binding of [3H]LOS from [3H]LOS·sCD14 to HEK293 Cells Expressing TLR4 ± wt or Mutant MD-2—Parental HEK293T cells and cells transiently transfected with pFLAG-CMV-TLR4 ± pEFBOS-MD-2-FLAG-His, wt or mutant, (6 μg of each plasmid DNA) were grown for 24 h in DMEM/10% fetal bovine serum in T75 flasks followed by 24 h in serum-free medium. Cells were dislodged with PBS, sedimented at 1000 rpm for 5 min, washed once with 3 ml of PBS/0.1% HSA, and then aliquoted so that each sample contained 4 × 106 cells in 1 ml. The cells were again sedimented and resuspended in PBS/0.1% HSA containing 2 nm [3H]LOS·sCD14 (50,000 cpm). Samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, with rotation. After the incubation, cells were washed twice with PBS/0.1% HSA and then transferred with 0.5 ml PBS/0.1% HSA into scintillation vials to measure cell-associated (bound) [3H]LOS by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. The percent of added [3H]LOS bound to cells was calculated as [(cpm in washed cell pellet)/(cpm in supernatant + washes + pellet)] × 100. Total recovery of added [3H]LOS was >90%. Presence of Monomeric E·sCD14 during Secretion of MD-2 from HEK293T Cells Results in High Yields of Bioactive E·MD-2—We have previously demonstrated that bioactive monomeric endotoxin (meningococcal lipopoligosaccharide, LOS or Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, LPS)·MD-2 can be efficiently generated by incubation of monomeric endotoxin·sCD14 with conditioned medium harvested from insect cells expressing and secreting recombinant human MD-2 (7Gioannini T.L.

However, initial efforts to reproduce these findings with harvested conditioned medium from HEK293T cells transiently expressing human MD-2 were unsuccessful (Fig. 1A), despite secretion and extracellular accumulation of MD-2 (Fig. 1C). Kennedy et al. (17Kennedy M.N. Mullen G.E. Leifer C.A. Lee C. Mazzoni A. Dileepan K.N. Segal D.M. J. Biol.

These findings are consistent with the much greater stability at 37 °C of monomeric LPS·MD-2 (as compared with MD-2 alone) (2Gioannini T.L. Teghanemt A. Zhang D. Levis E.N. Weiss J.P. J.

In an attempt to produce monomeric endotoxin·MD-2 from MD-2 secreted by transiently transfected HEK293T cells, the medium was supplemented (“spiked”) with [3H]LOS·sCD14 (1 nm). This change in experimental design resulted in virtually quantitative conversion of [3H]LOS·sCD14 to monomeric [3H]LOS·MD-2 in medium from cells expressing and secreting MD-2 (Fig. 1B) but not in medium of control cells (Fig. 1B). Note that in the absence of MD-2, some of the added [3H]LOS·sCD14 aggregates during incubation overnight and elutes in the void volume (Vo) (Fig. 1B). The recovered [3H]LOS·MD-2 produced dose-dependent activation of HEK/ TLR4 cells (Fig. 1D) but not of parental cells lacking TLR4 (data not shown). The potency of [3H]LOS·MD-2 derived from recombinant MD-2 produced by HEK293T cells or by insect (High Five) cells was essentially the sam"

Genetic studies in S. cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Mus musculus suggest that MSH4 and MSH5 are not involved in MMR but are required for normal chromosomal segregation and the production of viable gametes during meiosis (17de Vries S.S.

Both MSH4 and MSH5 affect the number and distribution of crossovers during meiosis, which suggests a role in both recombination and crossover interference (21Hollingsworth N.M. Ponte L. Halsey C. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1728-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 26Kolas N.K. Cohen P.E. Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2004; 107: 216-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 27Novak J.E. Ross-Macdonald P.B. Roeder G.S. Genetics. 2001; 158: 1013-1025PubMed Google Scholar). Pairing and synapsis of homologous chromosomes is an essential feature of meiosis I that results in genetic recombination and ensures accurate segregation of homologs (for review, see Ref. 28Roeder G.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2600-2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). The Holliday Junction (HoJo) was initially proposed as an intermediate in meiotic recombination that could account for both crossovers and gene conversion products (29Holliday R.A. Genet. Res. 1964; 5: 282-304Crossref Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). The double-strand break (DSB) repair model of recombination, which included tandem double Holliday Junctions (dHoJo) was later proposed to account for differences between the predicted and observed recombination products following meiosis (30Szostak J.W. Orr-Weaver T.L. Rothstein R.J. Stahl F.W. Cell. 1983; 33: 25-35Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar). Such dHoJo's have been observed in vivo during meiosis in yeast (31Allers T. Lichten M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 225-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Our previous studies established that hMSH4-hMSH5 uniquely and specifically recognizes a HoJo and its developmental precursor (32Snowden T. Acharya S. Butz C. Berardini M. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 437-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that binding of hMSH4-hMSH5 to HoJo's provoked ADP→ATP exchange. ATP binding induced a conformational transition in the hMSH4-hMSH5 complex that resulted in a hydrolysis-independent sliding clamp, which dissociated from the HoJo crossover core embracing two stacked parental duplex arms adjacent to the crossover. These observations led us to propose that hMSH4-hMSH5 stabilized and preserved the meiosis I HoJo intermediate until it was appropriately resolved to ensure accurate parental chromosome segregation (32Snowden T. Acharya S. Butz C. Berardini M. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 437-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Here we have demonstrated that the hMSH4-hMSH5 heterodimer displays two interaction domains within each subunit located near the amino and at the C-terminal regions of the proteins that flank the adenosine nucleotide-binding domain. We show that both the hMSH4 and hMSH5 subunits bind ATP and the poorly hydrolysable analog of ATP, ATPγS. The collective binding of ATP by the individual subunits appears to account for the apparent KD(ATP) of the heterodimer. We also explore the mechanism of ADP→ATP exchange and determined that it occurs during recognition of the HoJo core. Hydrolysis of ATP does not occur until the ATP-bound hMSH4-hMSH5 sliding clamp transits the ends of the HoJo. Finally, we have identified several components of the DSB repair machinery that strongly interact with hMSH4 and/or hMSH5, suggesting components of both early and late recombination nodules that may function with the hMSH4-hMSH5 heterodimer to ensure accurate DSB repair and chromosome segregation during meiosis I. Protein Purification—The overexpression and purification of hMSH4 and C-terminal His6-tagged hMSH5 were performed as previously described (32Snowden T. Acharya S. Butz C. Berardini M. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 437-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford analysis using gel filtration standards (Bio-Rad). GST-IVTT Protein Interaction Assay—Preparation of GST-tagged protein lysates, in vitro transcription-translation (IVTT), and the GST-IVTT interaction assay were performed as previously described (33Bocker T. Ruschoff J. Fishel R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 31: O1-O10Google Scholar, 34Schmutte C. Sadoff M.M. Shim K.S. Acharya S. Fishel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33011-33018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Quantitation of each GST-IVTT interaction (Intrel) was calculated based upon the number of [35S]Met present in each IVTT product as described previously (35Guerrette S. Acharya S. Fishel R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6336-6341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) using the interaction between full-length hMSH4-hMSH5 as the interaction standard. Previous studies have suggested that Intrel > 20% may be considered significant. hMSH4 and hMSH5 truncations were constructed by PCR truncation mutagenesis. The hMSH4 forward primers contained the following sequence in addition to sequences complementary to the N-terminal truncation region of hMSH4: 5′-GGCTCTAGAATG-3′ (XbaI site). The hMSH4 reverse primers contained the following sequence in addition to sequences complementary to the C-terminal truncation region of hMSH4: 5′-CGGGGTACCTCA-3′ (KpnI site). These forward and reverse primers were used in a PCR with pET29a-hMSH4 as a template. The hMSH4 PCR product and pET29a were digested with XbaI and KpnI, gel purified, ligated, and subclones sequenced to assure validity. hMSH5 forward primers contained the following sequence in addition to sequences complementary to the N-terminal truncation region of hMSH5: 5′-GGAATTCCATATG-3′ (NdeI site). hMSH5 reverse primers contained the following sequence in addition to sequences complementary to the C-terminal truncation region of hMSH5: 5′-GGCATACTCGAGTCA-3′ (XhoI site). These forward and reverse primers were used in a PCR with pET29a-hMSH5 as a template. The hMSH5 PCR product and pET29a were digested with NdeI and XhoI, gel purified, ligated, and subclones sequenced to assure validity. For the hMSH5 internal deletion (del 289–530) hMSH5-pET29a was digested with AatII, gel purified, ligated, and subclones sequenced to assure validity. Adenosine Nucleotide Cross-linking—Cross-linking of labeled adenosine nucleotide (α-32P, γ-32P, or γ-35S) was performed in 10 μl of Buffer A (25 mm Hepes pH 8.1, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and 300 nm protein) and incubated at 25 °C for 10 min. The samples were then transferred to ice and irradiated for 5 mm in a UV Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene). An equal volume of 2× loading buffer was added to each sample, followed by boiling for 5 min. The products of each reaction were then resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Prior to drying, gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to ensure equivalent loading between lanes. Gels were dried and quantitated by PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). Quantitation was determined as a relative ratio to hMSH5 density. DNA Substrate Preparation—All oligonucleotides were synthesized by Midland Certified Reagent Company Inc. (Midland, TX). The dsDNA, YoJo, HoJo, 1EB-HoJo, and 2EB-HoJo substrates were annealed and purified as previously described (32Snowden T. Acharya S. Butz C. Berardini M. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 437-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The Frayed-YoJo was prepared by annealing AXdt4O: 5′-CTAGTATAGAGCCGGCGCGCCATGTCTAGATAGCGTTAGGTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′ and KBdt4O: 5′-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTCCTAACGCTATCTAGACATGGCGCGCCGGCTCTATACTAG-3′. All annealed DNA substrates were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography with a Gen-Pak-FAX column (Waters) and concentrated with Centricon columns (Amicon). When oligonucleotides carried a biotin group, it was linked to the 3′ end. Steady-state ATPase and ADP→ATP Exchange—Steady-state ATPase assays were performed in Buffer B (25 mm Hepes pH 7.8, 100 mm NaC1, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgC12, 5% glycerol, and 50 μg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin) and incubated at 25 °C for 30 min as previously described (11Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). ADP→ATP exchange assays were performed in Buffer B. Four different concentrations of hMSH4-hMSH5 (0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 pmol) were incubated with 2.3 μm [3H]ADP at 25 °C for 10 min. A 3-fold excess of DNA was then added to the reaction, and incubation continued for an additional 10 min, followed by the addition of 500 μm unlabeled ATP to start the reaction (t = 0). The reaction was stopped at the indicated time points by the addition of 4 ml of ice-cold stop buffer (25 mm Hepes pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgC12, and 500 μg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin), immediately filtered through a Millipore HAWP nitrocellulose membrane, washed with an additional 4 ml of stop buffer, the filters air-dried, and quantitated as previously described (11Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The Interaction Regions between hMSH4 and hMSH5—The human MMR-specific MSH heterodimers contain defined interaction regions that correlate with hinge and clasp domains identified in structural studies of bacterial MutS (5Guerrette S. Wilson T. Gradia S. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6616-6623Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 6Lamers M.H. Perrakis A. Enzlin J.H. Winterwerp H.H. de Wind N. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 7Obmolova G. Ban C. Hsieh P. Yang W. Nature. 2000; 407: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). To map interaction domains, a full-length GST fusion protein of hMSH4 or hMSH5 was incubated with [35S]Met-labeled IVTT fragments of hMSH5 or hMSH4, respectively. Interactions may be compared in this system by using excess GST “bait” with limiting IVTT “prey”; where the each prey was introduced in a calculated equimolar concentration as determined from PhosphorImager quantitation of [35S]Met-labeled IVTT protein and proportional to the number of methionine residues in each peptide fragment. Quantitation was displayed relative to the known interactions between full-length hMSH4 and hMSH5 (Intrel) (for description, see Ref. 35Guerrette S. Acharya S. Fishel R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6336-6341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that full-length hMSH4 interacts strongly with hMSH5 either as an IVTT-hMSH4 with GST-hMSH5 (Fig. 1A, lane 1) or a GST-hMSH4 with IVTT-hMSH5 (Fig. 1B, lane 1). These two interactions represent an Intrel of 100% for comparison to subsequent peptide interactions. To determine the interaction regions of hMSH4 required for stable heterodimer formation with hMSH5 we first tested two overlapping truncated forms of hMSH4 (Fig. 1A, deletions, lanes 2 and 6). These studies suggested that both fragments interacted with full-length GST-hMSH5 (see Intrel quantitation). Based upon these results, we constructed five additional deletions that truncated the interacting fragments del2 and del6. Three of these fragments (del4, -5, and -8) displayed little or no interaction with GST-hMSH5 (Fig. 1A, deletions, lanes 4, 5, and 8). In contrast, two fragments (del3 and del7) displayed significant interaction with full-length GST-hMSH5 (Fig. 1A, deletions, lanes 3 and 7). Taken as a whole these studies suggest two interaction regions, one near the N-terminal region (amino acids 357–462) and one at the C-terminal region (amino acids 786–936). To determine the interaction regions of hMSH5 with hMSH4, IVTT truncation fragments of hMSH5 were tested for their ability to interact with full-length GST-hMSH4. Initially we examined three overlapping truncated forms of hMSH5 (Fig. 1B, deletions, lanes 2, 8, and 9). We found that two of these (deletions, lane 2 and 9) significantly interacted with full-length GST-MSH4 (Fig. 1B, see Intrel quantitation). Further truncating del9 (Fig. 1B, del10) resulted in a strong interaction. These results suggest an interaction region between amino acids 784 and 834 of hMSH5 with hMSH4. We subdivided del2 into four overlapping fragments (del3, -4, -5, and -6) and observed a strong interaction with del4 and del5 and little or no interaction with del3 and del6 (Fig. 1B, deletions, lanes 3-6). These results were most consistent with an interaction region between amino acids 152 and 263 of hMSH5 with hMSH4. The lack of any interaction with del3 is possibly a result of peptide misfolding: an inconvenient problem sometime associated with the IVTT-GST system. As a confirmation of these interaction motifs we constructed del7 containing both the N-terminal and C-terminal interaction regions with a deletion of an internal region between amino acids 270 and 558. We found a significant interaction with full-length GST-hMSH4 (Fig. 1B, deletion, lane 7). Overall, these results suggest that hMSH4 and hMSH5 interact in two distinct regions that flank the Walker A/B nucleotide-binding domain (Fig. 1C). These results appear qualitatively similar to the hinge and clasp domains identified in MMR-specific proteins hMSH2, hMSH3, and hMSH6 (5Guerrette S. Wilson T. Gradia S. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6616-6623Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) that were largely confirmed following structural analysis of bacterial MutS (6Lamers M.H. Perrakis A. Enzlin J.H. Winterwerp H.H. de Wind N. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 7Obmolova G. Ban C. Hsieh P. Yang W. Nature. 2000; 407: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Both Subunits of the hMSH4-hMSH5 Heterodimer Bind Adenosine Nucleotide—hMSH4 and hMSH5 both contain a consensus Walker A/B nucleotide-binding domain. Our previous studies demonstrated ADP (KD(ADP) ≈ 20 μm) and ATPγS (KD(ATPγS) ≈ 5.9 μm) binding activity as well as HoJo-stimulated ATPase activity by the hMSH4-hMSH5 heterodimer (32Snowden T. Acharya S. Butz C. Berardini M. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 437-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). To examine ATP binding by individual hMSH4-hMSH5 subunits we performed UV cross-linking studies with [α-32P]ATP, [γ-32P]ATP, and [γ-35S]ATP (Fig. 2). We observed non-equivalent cross-link labeling of the hMSH4 and hMSH5 subunits when [α-32P]ATP and [γ-32P]ATP were used as substrates (Fig. 2, A and B). Whereas hMSH5 was efficiently cross-link labeled with [α-32P]ATP and [γ-32P]ATP at the lowest concentrations of adenosine nucleotide (160 nm), the hMSH4 subunits only became efficiently labeled at higher concentrations (c1/2 ≈ 500 nm). 3c1/2 is defined as the concentration of labeled ATP, which produces half the total labeling. Although inefficient, both subunits appeared to be cross-link labeled equivalently over the entire range of [γ-35S]ATP concentrations (Fig. 2C). We observe no difference in UV cross-linking in the presence or absence of Holliday Junction DNA (Fig. 2E). This variation in cross-linking efficiency may suggest different binding properties or perhaps unique orientation(s) of the adenosine nucleotide in the binding region that affect cross-link efficiency. Because the cross-linking was performed at adenosine nucleotide concentrations that were well below the KD for ATP/ATPγS, we performed competition analysis with unlabeled ATP (Fig. 3). In these studies, unlabeled ATP was added to the labeled adenosine nucleotide prior to cross-linking. We observed equivalent competition by individual hMSH4 and hMSH5 subunits cross-linked with [α-32P]ATP (KI(ATP) ≈ 4 μm) and [γ-35S]ATP (KI(ATP) ≈ 12 μm) (Fig. 3, A and C). The average of these results correlate well with the observed KD for ATPγS determined by filter binding (32Snowden T. Acharya S. Butz C. Berardini M. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 437-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). We found a differential competition for cross-linking of hMSH4 and hMSH5 with [γ-32P]ATP (hMSH4 KI(ATP) ≈ 4 μm; hMSH5 KI(ATP) ≈ 12 μm; Fig. 3B). The increase in KI(ATP) of hMSH5 observed when cross-linked with [α-32P]ATP compared with [γ-32P]ATP most likely reflects subunit ATP processing. In the case of [α-32P]ATP, the cross-linked adenosine residue may be ATP, ADP, or a mixture of these adenosine nucleotides. However, competition of cross-linked [γ-32P]ATP must a priori reflect ATP competition. Taken as a whole, these results suggest an asymmetry in ATP binding and/or hydrolysis by individual subunits: an observation that is consistent with other MSH dimers/heterodimers (36Lamers M.H. Winterwerp H.H. Sixma T.K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 746-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). hMSH4-hMSH5 ATPase and ADP→ATP Exchange Is Uniquely Stimulated by Holliday Junctions—DNA containing mismatches display differential specificity in the stimulation of the intrinsic ATPase activity of MMR-specific MSH proteins (11Gradia S.

We examined the specificity of the hMSH4-hMSH5 steady-state ATPase activity. The hMSH4-hMSH5 ATPase was stimulated by HoJo's or a HoJo precursor (Pro-HoJo) containing three duplex arms and a single-stranded arm surrounding the crossover region (32Snowden T. Acharya S. Butz C. Berardini M. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 437-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). Our previous studies suggested little or no binding to a three-way junction (Y-Junction or YoJo), although its ability to stimulate the intrinsic ATPase was unknown. We observed a slight stimulation of the hMSH4-hMSH5 ATPase in the presence of dsDNA, YoJo, or Frayed-YoJo DNAs compared with the absence of DNA (Fig. 4A). This modest ATPase stimulation by canonical dsDNA has been observed with MMR-specific MSH proteins and has been interpreted to be the result of nonspecific DNA end stimulation (10Acharya S.

The kinetics of ADP→ATP exchange may be examined by prebinding hMSH4-hMSH5 with [3H]ADP in the presence of Mg2+. The ADP→ATP exchange reaction is started by the addition of excess unlabeled ATP in the presence or absence of a DNA substrate. Our previous studies demonstrated that hMSH4-hMSH5 ADP→ATP exchange was stimulated by HoJo and pro-HoJo DNA substrates (32Snowden T. Acharya S. Butz C. Berardini M. Fishel R. Mol.

The three-dimensional structure of CEL-III/GalNAc and CEL-III/methyl α-galactoside complexes was solved by x-ray crystallographic analysis. In these complexes, five carbohydrate molecules were found to be bound to two carbohydrate-binding domains (domains 1 and 2) located in the N-terminal 2/3 portion of the polypeptide and that contained β-trefoil folds similar to ricin B-chain. The 3-OH and 4-OH of bound carbohydrate molecules were coordinated with Ca2+ located at the subdomains 1α, 1γ, 2α, 2β, and 2γ, simultaneously forming hydrogen bond networks with nearby amino acid side chains, which is similar to carbohydrate binding in C-type lectins. The binding of carbohydrates was further stabilized by aromatic amino acid residues, such as tyrosine and tryptophan, through a stacking interaction with the hydrophobic face of carbohydrates. The importance of amino acid residues in the carbohydrate-binding sites was confirmed by the mutational analyses. The orientation of bound GalNAc and methyl α-galactoside was similar to the galactose moiety of lactose bound to the carbohydrate-binding site of the ricin B-chain, although the ricin B-chain does not require Ca2+ ions for carbohydrate binding. The binding of the carbohydrates induced local structural changes in carbohydrate-binding sites in subdomains 2α and 2β. Binding of GalNAc also induced a slight change in the main chain structure of domain 3, which could be related to the conformational change upon binding of specific carbohydrates to induce oligomerization of the protein.

After binding to cell surface carbohydrate chains, CEL-III oligomerizes to form membrane pores, thereby leading to colloid osmotic rupture of the cell membrane (4Hatakeyama T. Furukawa M. Nagatomo H.

In addition to hemolytic activity, this lectin exhibits a strong cytotoxicity for some cultured cell lines, which is also caused by formation of oligomers in the cell membrane (5Oda T. Tsuru M.

These toxins exert their pore-forming action through conformational changes that lead to oligomerization in the target cell membranes after binding to specific cell surface receptors. Recently, some hemolytic lectins have also been reported (13Konska G. Guillot J. Dusser M. Damez M. Botton B. J. Biochem.

The importance of oligomerization in the target cell membranes is also suggested for these lectins. methyl β-d-galactopyranoside methyl α-d-galactopyranoside Tris-buffered saline bis(2-hydroxyethyl)iminotris(hydroxymethyl)methane From the cDNA nucleotide sequence, it was inferred that CEL-III is composed of three domains as follows: two N-terminal carbohydrate-binding domains (domains 1 and 2) and a C-terminal domain (domain 3) (17Nakano M. Tabata S. Sugihara K. Kouzuma Y. Kimura M. Yamasaki N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1435: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The carbohydrate-binding domains have a relatively low but definite similarity with the carbohydrate-binding domains of ricin-type (R-type) lectins, such as the B-chains of the toxic plant lectins ricin (18Funatsu G. Kimura M. Funatsu M. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1979; 42: 2221-2224Google Scholar) and abrin (19Kimura M. Sumizawa T. Funatsu G. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1993; 57: 166-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). On the other hand, although ricin-like plant lectins contain toxic subunits, namely the A-chains that inactivate the 60 S ribosomal subunits in eukaryotic cells, CEL-III has domain 3 that contains hydrophobic segments and may be involved in the oligomerization in the target cell membrane. In fact, we have observed that domain 3 fragments, once produced by limited digestion with trypsin, spontaneously associate to form oligomers in solution. The resulting domain 3 oligomer exhibited a marked increase in β-sheet content, as measured by circular dichroism spectra (20Kouzuma Y. Suzuki Y. Nakano M. Matsuyama K. Tojo S. Kimura M. Yamasaki T. Aoyagi H. Hatakeyama T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 134: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This is consistent with an increase in β-sheet structure of the entire CEL-III oligomer (4Hatakeyama T. Furukawa M. Nagatomo H. Yamasaki N. Mori T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16915-16920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that oligomerization of CEL-III is mainly mediated by interactions between its domain 3 after binding to cell surface carbohydrates. We have solved the crystal structure of CEL-III (21Uchida T. Yamasaki T. Eto S. Sugawara H. Kurisu G. Nakagawa A. Kusunoki M. Hatakeyama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37133-37141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), which confirmed the domain structure as suggested from the amino acid sequence; domains 1 and 2 adopt a β-trefoil structure, each consisting of three subdomains or motifs. They showed apparent similarity with the B-chains of ricin and abrin despite their relatively low sequence identity. The basic folds of the carbohydrate-binding domains of CEL-III and ricin B-chain are similar, but there is a significant difference that CEL-III contains Ca2+ ions at their carbohydrate-binding sites, whereas the ricin B-chain does not. Although Ca2+ is known to be essential for interaction with carbohydrates in some lectins, such as C-type lectins (22Poget S.F. Freund S.M. Howard M.J. Bycroft M.

To elucidate the carbohydrate-binding mechanism and the role of bound Ca2+ ions, we assessed the x-ray crystal structure of CEL-III/GalNAc and CEL-III/methyl α-galactoside (Me-α-Gal) complexes. Results revealed that CEL-III recognizes specific carbohydrates in a very similar manner as C-type lectins despite the structural similarity with R-type lectins. It was also observed that the binding of the carbohydrates induced local structural changes in carbohydrate-binding sites and domain 3 that could be related to the conformational change upon binding to cell surface carbohydrates, which leads to oligomerization of the protein in cell membranes (4Hatakeyama T.

Materials—Oligonucleotides used in this study were purchased from Exigen (Tokyo, Japan). Ex Taq™ DNA polymerase and the DNA ligation kit were obtained from Takara (Otsu, Japan) and used as recommended by the supplier. Restriction endonucleases and DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from MBI Fermentas (Burlington, Canada). The plasmid vectors used in this work were as follows: pGEM-T Easy vector from Promega and pET-32a expression vector from Novagen. All other chemicals were of analytical grade for biochemical use. Purification and Crystallization of CEL-III/Carbohydrate Complexes—CEL-III was purified from C. echinata according to a method reported previously (2Hatakeyama T. Nagatomo H. Yamasaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3560-3564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The proteins extracted from a homogenate of C. echinata were applied to a lactose-Cellulofine column equilibrated with 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (TBS), containing 10 mm CaCl2. Adsorbed lectins (CEL-I, CEL-III, and CEL-IV) were eluted with TBS containing 20 mm EDTA. The lectins were then separated using a GalNAc-Cellulofine column, utilizing the differences in carbohydrate-binding specificities. After elution of CEL-III with TBS containing 0.1 m lactose, CEL-I and CEL-IV were eluted with TBS containing 20 mm EDTA. CEL-III was finally purified by gel filtration through Sephadex G-75 in TBS. Crystallization of CEL-III/carbohydrate complexes was done under similar conditions as those for native CEL-III crystals (21Uchida T. Yamasaki T. Eto S. Sugawara H. Kurisu G. Nakagawa A. Kusunoki M.

Expression of the Carbohydrate Recognition Domain 1 of CEL-III in E. coli Cells—To obtain a cDNA fragment encoding domain 1 (residues 1-156) of CEL-III, PCR was performed using CEL-III cDNA (17Nakano M. Tabata S. Sugihara K. Kouzuma Y. Kimura M. Yamasaki N. Biochim. Biophys.

The PCR products were ligated into the pGEM-T Easy vector. After confirmation of the DNA sequence, the DNA fragment was excised by digestion with NcoI and BamHI, and ligated into the expression vector pET-32a, previously digested with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid pET-CRD1 was introduced into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) CodonPlus RIL strain (Stratagene), and recombinant protein was induced with 1 mm isopropylthiogalactoside according to the supplier's instruction. After induction, the culture was incubated for an additional 5 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested and lysed by BugBuster protein extraction reagent (Novagen) and sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was loaded onto HisBind resin columns (Novagen). After washing of the column, recombinant protein was eluted by 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, containing 1 m imidazole and 500 mm NaCl according to the supplier's manual. Protein solution was dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm CaCl2. The recombinant domain 1 thus obtained was investigated for its carbohydrate binding activity. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by the unique site elimination method (35Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal.

Nomenclature of domain 1 mutants and oligonucleotide primers used for mutagenesis are shown in Table 2. Mutations were introduced into the amplified cDNA fragment that had been subcloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector. After mutagenesis, the cDNA fragments were sequenced to verify the presence of the desired mutation. The mutant cDNA fragment was then recovered and ligated into the pET-32a expression vector. Expression and purification of all mutants were done by procedures identical to those described for the wild-type domain 1.TABLE 2Nomenclature of domain 1 mutants and oligonucleotide primers used for mutagenesisMutantsOligonucleotidesaThe primers with the reverse-complementary sequence of each primer were also used for mutagenesis.D23A5′-CAAGCAATGCGTTGCCATAGTTGGTAATCA-3′Y36A5′-AACATAGCGACGGCGGATTGTGATGGGTTA-3′D43A5′-GGGTTATCTGCCCAACAGATTATCATTTGC-3′Q44A5′-TGGGTTATCTGACGCACAGATTATCATTTG-3′Q45A5′-GTTATCTGACCAAGCGATTATCATTTGCGG-3′a The primers with the reverse-complementary sequence of each primer were also used for mutagenesis.

Wild-type and mutant proteins (D23A, Y36A, D43A, Q44A, and Q45A), in which amino acid residues in the binding site of subdomain 1α were replaced by Ala residues, were applied onto a GalNAc-Cellulofine column (0.8 × 10 cm) equilibrated with TBS containing 10 mm CaCl2. After washing the column with the same buffer, adsorbed proteins were eluted with 100 mm lactose in the same buffer. Crystallization and Structure Determination of CEL-III/Carbohydrate Complexes—Crystals were prepared under similar conditions as for native CEL-III (21Uchida T. Yamasaki T. Eto S. Sugawara H. Kurisu G. Nakagawa A. Kusunoki M. Hatakeyama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37133-37141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We have tried to crystallize CEL-III complexed with several carbohydrates, such as GalNAc, lactose, lactulose, Me-β-Gal, Me-α-Gal, and galactose (3Hatakeyama T. Miyamoto Y. Nagatomo H. Sallay I. Yamasaki N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Among these, CEL-III/GalNAc and CEL-III/Me-α-Gal complexes gave good diffraction patterns, although Me-α-Gal showed lower affinity than Me-β-Gal (3Hatakeyama T. Miyamoto Y. Nagatomo H. Sallay I. Yamasaki N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and they were analyzed. Statistics of data collection and refinement parameters are summarized in Table 1. The space group of the CEL-III/Me-α-Gal crystal was P21 with a unit cell axis of a = 53.3 Å, b = 65.5 Å, c = 127.0 Å, β = 97.1°, and two CEL-III molecules were contained in the asymmetric unit, which is similar to native CEL-III crystals. On the other hand, CEL-III/GalNAc crystals belonged to P1 with a unit cell axis of a = 52.6 Å, b = 65.2 Å, c = 66.7 Å, α = 85.3°, β = 73.6°, γ = 89.9°, which contained two CEL-III molecules in the asymmetric unit. The structures of these CEL-III/carbohydrate complexes were solved by a molecular replacement method using native CEL-III as a search model. Five Ca2+ and two Mg2+ ions were assigned to the same positions as those for native protein, considering their electron density, coordination numbers, bond distances, and ligand atoms (21Uchida T. Yamasaki T. Eto S. Sugawara H. Kurisu G. Nakagawa A. Kusunoki M. Hatakeyama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37133-37141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, the electron density map exhibited a distinct electron density corresponding to bound GalNAc and Me-α-Gal molecules at each Ca2+ ion in the five subdomains of the carbohydrate-binding domains (domains 1 and 2). The five carbohydrate molecule models were fitted to this electron density map, and refinement of the model was further performed. Finally, refinement of the model of CEL-III/Me-α-Gal and CEL-III/GalNAc complexes was performed to achieve R = 19.1% and Rfree = 23.9%, and R = 18.5%, and Rfree = 21.8%, respectively, as shown in Table 1. The resulting overall and carbohydrate-binding domain structure of the CEL-III/GalNAc complex is illustrated in Fig. 2.FIGURE 2Overall structure of the CEL-III/GalNAc complex (A) and its carbohydrate-binding domains (domains 1 and 2) (B). Bound GalNAc molecules are indicated by yellow stick models. Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions are shown as purple and orange balls, respectively. Five GalNAc molecules are bound at subdomains 1α, 1γ, 2α, 2β, and 2γ. Only subdomain 1β contains no Ca2+ ion and no GalNAc. An additional GalNAc molecule nonspecifically bound to CEL-III (Fig. 4C) is not depicted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Overall Structure and Carbohydrate-binding Sites of the CEL-III/Carbohydrate Complex—In CEL-III/carbohydrate complexes, GalNAc and Me-α-Gal molecules were bound to the five subdomains, 1α, 1γ, 2α, 2β, and 2γ, in domains 1 and 2, whereas subdomain 1β did not bind carbohydrate molecules (Fig. 2 for the CEL-III/GalNAc complex). This is consistent with the fact that these subdomains, with the exception of 1β, have a very similar structure with Ca2+ ions. In fact, only subdomain 1β lacks amino acid residues directly involved in coordination with Ca2+ in other subdomains (the residues at a, b, and f positions in Fig. 3). At each carbohydrate-binding site, 3-OH and 4-OH of the bound carbohydrates are coordinated with a Ca2+ ion and simultaneously form hydrogen bonds with side chains of nearby amino acid residues. For example, in subdomain 1α, 4-OH forms two hydrogen bonds with the carboxyl side chain of Asp-23 (position a) and the amide NH of Gly-26 (position c), and 3-OH of the carbohydrates forms a hydrogen bond with Asp-39 (position e) (Fig. 4, A and B). Asp-39 also forms a hydrogen bond with a water molecule that is fixed by a coordinate bond with Ca2+ and hydrogen bonds with Asp-43 (position f). Such a carbohydrate recognition mode was essentially common in all the carbohydrate-binding sites, except for the residues at position e, which includes Asp, Gln, and Glu residues (Fig. 3).FIGURE 4Stereo view of the carbohydrate-binding sites of CEL-III.

Coordinate and hydrogen bonds are indicated by dotted lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the case of the CEL-III/GalNAc complex, the binding of both anomers of GalNAc to CEL-III was observed from their electron density map (Table 3), depending on the local environment of each binding site. For example, GalNAc bound in subdomain 1α was mostly α-anomer, being stabilized by a hydrogen bond with the carboxyl side chain of Asn-410 of the neighbor CEL-III molecule in the crystal. Although GalNAc shows relatively high affinity for CEL-III among simple carbohydrates, there is no specific bonding between acetamido group of GalNAc and protein atoms except for van der Waals contact. The average hydrogen bond distances for the bound carbohydrates and their anomeric state are listed in Table 3.TABLE 3Average hydrogen bond distances for bound carbohydrates in the five carbohydrate-binding sites and their anomeric stateCarbohydrateSubdomainMolecule AaMolecules A and B are two molecules in the asymmetric unit.Molecule BaMolecules A and B are two molecules in the asymmetric unit.Average hydrogen bond distance (Å)bValues in parentheses indicate standard deviations.Anomeric statecPredominant anomers were observed from the electron density maps.Average hydrogen bond distance (Å)bValues in parentheses indicate standard deviations.Anomeric statecPredominant anomers were observed from the electron density maps.GalNAc1α2.71 (0.28)α2.80 (0.31)α1γ2.77 (0.30)β2.79 (0.39)β2α2.74 (0.28)β2.75 (0.29)β2β2.73 (0.32)β2.71 (0.30)β2γ2.79 (0.19)α2.78 (0.20)αMe-α-Gal1α2.72 (0.26)-2.81 (0.37)-1γ3.02 (0.26)-3.01 (0.23)-2α2.85 (0.33)-2.78 (0.26)-2β2.81 (0.33)-2.81 (0.26)-2γ2.74 (0.25)-2.89 (0.31)-a Molecules A and B are two molecules in the asymmetric unit.b Values in parentheses indicate standard deviations.c Predominant anomers were observed from the electron density maps. Open table in a new tab Besides the GalNAc molecules bound in domains 1 and 2, another GalNAc molecule was found in the pocket formed between domains 1 and 3 (Fig. 4C). Both CEL-III molecules in the asymmetric unit of the crystal contained GalNAc at this position. However, binding of this GalNAc was mediated by several hydrogen bonds with surrounding water molecules, which were fixed on the surface of the protein. Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume that this is nonspecific binding of GalNAc. In fact, no carbohydrate molecule was observed in this pocket of the CEL-III/Me-α-Gal complex. Fig. 5A shows the superimposition of the carbohydrate-binding site residues (subdomain 2γ) of CEL-III and the ricin B-chain. As seen in this figure, orientation of GalNAc bound to CEL-III was very similar to that of galactose moiety of lactose bound to the ricin B-chain when both proteins were superimposed based on the corresponding residues (Fig. 3). Stacking interaction of the hydrophobic face of the carbohydrates with aromatic side chains (Trp-269 in CEL-III and Tyr-248 in the ricin B-chain; position d) was also common in both proteins. However, recognition of 3-OH and 4-OH of GalNAc was essentially done by coordinate bonds with Ca2+ ions as well as hydrogen bond networks at the binding site in CEL-III, whereas recognition of 3-OH and 4-OH was achieved only by hydrogen bonds in ricin B-chain. Despite involvement of Ca2+ ions, amino acid residues involved in recognition of carbohydrates are mostly at the same positions in CEL-III and ricin B-chain. Among these, the residues at positions a, b, c, and f form coordinate bonds with Ca2+ in CEL-III. The residues at positions a and c also form hydrogen bonds with 4-OH of the carbohydrates, whereas the residue at position e"

Apart from the crucial role of the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) for peptide loading of MHC class I molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum, TAP-independent translocation pathways have been proposed but not identified so far. Based on its overlapping substrate specificity with TAP, we herein investigated the ABC transporter ABCB9, also named TAP-like (TAPL). Remarkably, TAPL expression is strongly induced during differentiation of monocytes to dendritic cells and to macrophages. TAPL does not, however, restore MHC class I surface expression in TAP-deficient cells, demonstrating that TAPL alone or in combination with single TAP subunits does not form a functional transport complex required for peptide loading of MHC I in the endoplasmic reticulum. In fact, by using quantitative immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation, TAPL was detected in the lysosomal compartment co-localizing with the lysosome-associated membrane protein LAMP-2. By in vitro assays, we demonstrate a TAPL-specific translocation of peptides into isolated lysosomes, which strictly requires ATP hydrolysis. These results suggest a mechanism by which antigenic peptides have access to the lysosomal compartment in professional antigen-presenting cells.

In the classical MHC class I-mediated immune response, TAP is an essential factor for transporting peptides, generated in the cytosol primarily by proteasomal degradation, into the ER lumen (1Abele R. Tampé R. Physiology (Bethesda). 2004; 19: 216-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These peptides bind to MHC class I and are shuttled in complex to the cell surface. Exogenous antigens are taken up via the endocytic pathway, and, after fragmentation in lysosomal compartments, peptides are loaded onto MHC class II (2Pieters J. Curr Opin Immunol. 1997; 9: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In professional antigen-presenting cells like macrophages, dendritic cells, and B-cells, a process termed cross-presentation exists, in which MHC class I presents exogenous antigens, whereas cytosolically generated peptides of endogenous origin are displayed by MHC class II on the cell surface (3Cresswell P.

Long E.O. Nature. 1992; 357: 702-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In both cases, a TAP-independent pathway has been proposed but not yet identified (5Dani A. Chaudhry A. Mukherjee P.

Immunol. 2005; 174: 1811-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Most recently, TAPL was uncovered as an ATP-dependent peptide transporter, sharing some degree of overlap in substrate specificity with TAP (8Wolters J.C. Abele R. Tampé R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23631-23636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). TAPL transports a very broad spectrum of peptides ranging from 6- up to 59-mers (8Wolters J.C. Abele R. Tampé R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23631-23636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), whereas TAP prefers peptides with a length of 8-12 amino acids (9Koopmann J.O. Post M. Neefjes J.J. Hämmerling G.J. Momburg F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1720-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Both transporters belong to the superfamily of ABC proteins (10Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3346) Google Scholar). Members of this family are found in all three phyla of life, where they translocate a very broad range of solutes across membranes. Functional complexes are built up either by heterodimers of TAP1 and TAP2, or homodimers of TAPL (8Wolters J.C. Abele R. Tampé R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23631-23636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 11Kleijmeer M.J. Kelly A. Geuze H.J. Slot J.W. Townsend A. Trowsdale J.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14257-14264Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, whether TAPL can assemble with TAP1 or TAP2 into a functional transport complex is still an open issue (14Kobayashi A. Maeda T. Maeda M. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2004; 27: 1916-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). TAPL and TAP share a similar exon organization and a high degree of sequence similarity (15Zhang F. Zhang W. Liu L. Fisher C.L.

Immunogenetics. 2003; 55: 38-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Because TAP is an essential factor in the MHC class I pathway, cells lacking TAP1 or TAP2 show a strongly impaired surface expression of MHC class I molecules (18de la Salle H. Hanau D. Fricker D. Urlacher A. Kelly A. Salamero J. Powis S.H. Donato L. Bausinger H. Laforet M. Jeras M. Spehner D. Bieber T. Falkenrodt A. Cazenave J.-P. Trowsdale J. Tongio M.-M.

Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: R9-R13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The involvement of TAP in antigen presentation is also mirrored by the localization of its genes in the MHC class II locus (20Bahram S. Arnold D. Bresnahan M. Strominger J.L. Spies T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10094-10098Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), whereas tapl is not clustered with genes relevant for the immune system (21Kobayashi A. Kasano M. Maeda T. Hori S. Motojima K. Suzuki M. Fujiwara T. Takahashi E. Yabe T. Tanaka K. Kasahara M. Yamaguchi Y. Maeda M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Based on phylogenetic analyses, TAPL appears to be the ancestral peptide transporter present even in jawless vertebrates lacking an adaptive immune system (17Uinuk-ool T.S. Mayer W.E. Sato A. Takezaki N. Benyon L. Cooper M.D. Klein J. Immunogenetics. 2003; 55: 38-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In contrast to TAP, which is expressed in all somatic cells, TAPL is strongly expressed in testes, whereas moderate expression levels are found in brain, spinal cord, and heart (15Zhang F. Zhang W.

Sato R. Maeda M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The subcellular localization of TAPL is a matter of debate, because it was identified in lysosomes (15Zhang F. Zhang W. Liu L. Fisher C.L. Hui D. Childs S. Dorovini-Zis K. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23287-23294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) as well as in the ER (14Kobayashi A. Maeda T. Maeda M. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2004; 27: 1916-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 21Kobayashi A. Kasano M. Maeda T. Hori S. Motojima K. Suzuki M. Fujiwara T. Takahashi E. Yabe T. Tanaka K. Kasahara M. Yamaguchi Y. Maeda M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).In this study, we investigated the role of TAPL in the adaptive immune system. We observed a strong up-regulation of TAPL expression during maturation of dendritic cells and macrophages. By using quantitative immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation, TAPL was found in the lysosomal compartment. In agreement with this, TAPL is not involved in the peptide delivery into the classical MHC class I loading compartment, because TAPL did not restore MHC class I cell surface expression of TAP-deficient cells. By establishing an in vitro assay, we demonstrated for the first time a TAPL-specific ATP-dependent translocation of peptides into isolated lysosomes. The identification of a new transport system in the lysosomal compartment as well as its strong up-regulation during maturation of DCs and macrophages suggest that TAPL is part of an alternative pathway of antigen presentation in professional antigen-presenting cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning—Human TAPL was cloned into pEGFP-N3 and pIRES2-EGFP (both BD Biosciences) resulting in TAPL with a C-terminal EGFP and TAPL co-translated with EGFP, respectively. Furthermore, TAPL containing a C-terminal myc tag was cloned into pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen). These constructs were PCR-amplified using the primer pairs pcDNA3.1(+)-TAPL-myc (5′-CGATTAGCTAGCATGCGGCTGTGGAAG-3′ and 5′-CGATTAGGATCCTCACAGATCCTCTTCTGAGATGAGTTTTTGTTCACTGCCGGCCTTGTGACTGCC-3′), pEGFP-N3-TAPL (5′-CGATTAGCTAGCATGCGGCTGTGGAAGG-3′ and 5′-CGATTAGGATCCGGCCTTGTGACTGCC-3′), and pIRES2-TAPL-EGFP (5′-CGATTAGCTAGCATGCGGCTGTGGAAGG-3′ and 5′-CGATTAGGATCCTCAGGCCTTGTGACTGCC-3′) and cloned via NheI and BamHI sites into the vectors. For cloning of TAPL into the retroviral vector pLPCX (Clontech), ClaI and BglII restriction sites were introduced by PCR via the primer pairs 5′-GAAGATCTTCGCCACCATGCGGCTGTGGAAGG-3′ and 5′-CCATCGATGGTCAGGCCTTGTGACTGCC-3′. TAPL-K545A/H699A was generated by Ligase Chain Reaction using the primers 5′-CGGGCAGTGGGGCGAGCTCCTGTGTC-3′ and 5′-CTCATCATCGCGGCCCGGCTGAGCAC-3′ (mutated bases are underlined). p46.TAP1wt DNA was used for transient expression of human TAP1 in BRE-169 cells (23Heintke S. Chen M. Ritz U. Lankat-Buttgereit B. Koch J. Abele R. Seliger B. Tampé R. FEBS Lett. 2003; 533: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).Cell Lines and Culture—BRE-169 or STF1-169 cells are TAP1- or TAP2-deficient skin fibroblast cell lines, respectively (19de la Salle H. Zimmer J. Fricker D. Angenieux C. Cazenave J.P. Okubo M. Maeda H. Plebani A. Tongio M.M. Dormoy A. Hanau D. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: R9-R13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa, BRE-169, STF1-169, and 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (PAA Laboratories) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Biochrom AG), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For BRE-169 and STF1-169 cells, 50 μg/ml hygromycin was supplemented. For stably TAP2-transfected STF1-169 cells, 500 μg/ml neomycin was added to the medium (23Heintke S. Chen M. Ritz U. Lankat-Buttgereit B. Koch J. Abele R. Seliger B. Tampé R. FEBS Lett. 2003; 533: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Human Burkitt lymphoma cells (Raji cells) were cultured as reported previously (24Gorbulev S. Abele R. Tampé R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3732-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). THP-1 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (PAA Laboratories) containing 10% fetal calf serum and were stimulated with Escherichia coli as described elsewhere (25Lackman R.L. Cresswell P. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 4833-4840Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).Generation of DCs—DCs were generated in two different ways. In the first method, human peripheral blood monocytes were isolated by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation and monocytes isolated using anti-CD14 micro beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Miltenyi Biotech). 1 × 106 monocytes per 24-well plate were cultured in DC medium (CellGro) supplemented with 1000 units/ml GM-CSF (Biomedical Laboratories) and 1000 units/ml IL-4 (Peprotech) for 5 days to obtain immature DCs. For differentiation into mature DCs, immature DCs were additionally stimulated from days 5 to 8 with a maturation mixture (26Jonuleit H. Kuhn U. Muller G. Steinbrink K. Paragnik L. Schmitt E. Knop J. Enk A.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 3135-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar): 10 ng/ml IL-1β (Peprotech), 10 ng/ml TNF-α (Peprotech), 1000 units/ml IL-6 (Peprotech), and 1 μg/ml prostaglandin E2 (Sigma). In the second method, monocyte-derived DCs were generated as described previously (27Brossart P. Schneider A. Dill P. Schammann T. Grunebach F. Wirths S. Kanz L. Buhring H.J. Brugger W. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6846-6850PubMed Google Scholar). To inhibit differentiation of monocytes, IL-10 (10 ng/ml, R&D Systems) was added together with GM-CSF and IL-4. The medium was replenished with cytokines every 2 or 3 days. For maturation, DCs were further cultured with additional stimuli as TNF-α (10 ng/ml, R&D Systems), lipopolysaccharides (LPS, 100 ng/ml, Sigma), Pam3Cys (5.0 μg/ml, EMC Microcollection), poly I:C (50.0 μg/ml, Sigma), R848 (2.0 μg/ml, InvivoGen), or CD40L (100 ng/ml, Bender Medsystem) for 24 h.RT-PCR—RT-PCR was performed using two different protocols. With the first method, total RNA was prepared using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA was removed by treatment with DNase (Roche Applied Science) for 15 min at 37 °C, and cDNA was prepared by using SuperScript II (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCRs were performed using the following primer pairs: TAPL, 209 bp (5′-GCTCTGGGAGAGACCTTCCT-3′ and 5′-GAGCGGAAGAGACAGTTTCG-3′), TAPL, 538 bp (5′-CAAGTACTACAAGAGGCTCTCCAAAG-3′ and 5′-GGAGACATTCTGCAGGACCTG-3′), GAPDH (5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ and 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′), and β2-m (5′-GGGTTTCATCCATCCGACAT-3′ and 5′-GATGCTGCTTACATGTCTCGA-3′). The mRNA content was normalized by RT-PCR analysis with GAPDH-specific primers. PCRs using RNA before reverse transcription as template confirmed the absence of genomic DNA in the samples. With the second method, total RNA was isolated from cell lysates using Qiagen RNeasy Mini anion-exchange spin columns, including on-column DNase digestion (Qiagen), according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Total RNA (1 μg) was subjected to a 20.0-μl cDNA synthesis reaction (Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit, Roche Applied Science) using random hexamer primers. 1.0 μl of cDNA was used for PCR amplification. To control the integrity of RNA and the efficiency of cDNA synthesis, 1.0 μl of cDNA was amplified by an intron-spanning primer pair for the β2-microglobulin gene.Transfection—BRE-169 and STF1-169 cells (2 × 106 cells) or HeLa cells (1 × 107 cells) were electroporated in 400 μl of electroporation buffer (20 mm HEPES, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.7 mm Na2HPO4, 6 mm dextrose, pH 7.05) in the presence of 6 μg or 30 μg DNA, respectively. Electroporation was performed with a GenePulser II (Bio-Rad, gene pulser cuvettes (0.4-cm electrode gap), 260 V, 350 microfarads, and 50 Ω). The cells were diluted in 10 ml of recovery medium (culture medium containing 3 mm EGTA) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were subsequently transferred to fresh culture medium.Retroviral Transduction—Recombinant retroviruses were obtained by co-transfection of pCL-Ampho (generous gift of Peter Cresswell) (28Naviaux R.K. Costanzi E. Haas M. Verma I.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5701-5705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the retroviral constructs pLPCX-TAPL or pLPCX-TAPL-K545A/H699A into 293T cells with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Supernatants were collected 30 h after transfection and filtered through a 0.45-μm pore size filter. For transduction, 1 × 106 Raji or THP-1 cells were resuspended in 2 ml of viral supernatant supplemented with 8 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). Cells were transferred into 6-well plates and centrifuged at 1250 × g for 90 min at 32 °C. After 15 h, cells were transferred to normal medium, and after recovery for 6-8 h, the transduction was repeated. 24 h after, cells were selected in medium containing 0.5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma).Flow Cytometry—BRE-169 and STF1-169 cells were harvested 48 h after electroporation, washed once in FACS buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 2% fetal calf serum), and blocked with bovine serum albumin buffer (FACS buffer containing 5% bovine serum albumin). Afterward, 5 × 105 cells were stained with a phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-human HLA-ABC (W6/32, eBioscience) or PE-conjugated mouse IgG2 isotype control antibody (eBioscience) and analyzed by flow cytometry with a FACSAria cell sorter (BD Biosciences) controlled by FACSDiVa software (BD Biosciences). Routinely, 30,000 cells were counted for one measurement. The data were analyzed with FCS-Express software (De Novo Software). Monocytes as well as immature and mature DCs were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and immunostained in the presence of polyglobin for 20 min at 4 °C using the following monoclonal antibodies diluted to the optimal concentration: anti-CD14-Pacific blue (BD Pharmingen), anti-HLA-DR-APC-Cy7 (Biolegend), anti-CD83-APC (BD Pharmingen), and anti-CD86-PE (Biolegend). Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using LSR II with DIVA and/or WinList software.Quantitative Immunofluorescence—Stably transduced and stimulated THP-1 cells or HeLa cells grown on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips were fixed for 12 min at room temperature in 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min at room temperature. After blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin, cells were stained with the primary antibody (rabbit anti-calnexin polyclonal antibody (Stressgen), mouse anti-calnexin (Dianova), rabbit anti-EEA1 polyclonal antibody (Calbiochem), mouse anti-EEA1 (Abcam), anti-myc monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences), anti-LAMP-2 monoclonal antibody (2D5) (29Radons J. Faber V. Buhrmester H. Volker W. Horejsi V. Hasilik A. Eur J. Cell Biol. 1992; 57: 184-192PubMed Google Scholar), epitope-purified, rabbit anti-TAPL polyclonal antibody (8Wolters J.C. Abele R. Tampé R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23631-23636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar)) followed by fluorescence-labeled secondary antibody (Cy3 donkey anti-rabbit antibody, Cy3 donkey anti-mouse antibody, Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse antibody (Dianova)) for 30 min each at room temperature. Preparations were mounted in 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, 25% (w/v) glycerol, 10% (w/v) Mowiol (Calbiochem), and 2.5% 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2.]octane (Sigma). Samples were analyzed with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM 510, Zeiss) using the argon laser line at 488 nm for Alexa Fluor 488 or EGFP excitation and a 543 nm HeNe laser for excitation of Cy3. Fluorescence was detected through a 505-530 nm band pass filter and a 560 nm long pass filter for the argon laser and HeNe laser excitation, respectively. 512 × 512 pixels per image were recorded with a Plan-Apochromat 63× oil immersion objective (numerical aperture, 1.4). To reduce blur, improve resolution, and reduce background, blind deconvolution with the program Auto Deblur (Bitplane AG, Switzerland) was performed. The restored images were used for the co-localization analysis with the software package Imaris (Bitplane AG). The threshold was set to 50 to eliminate influence of background for co-localization. For each pair of co-localization analysis, the number of co-localized voxels was determined from 2 to 10 images.Preparation of Lysosomes—2 × 108 Raji or stimulated THP-1 cells were harvested, washed once in HEPES buffer (10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, pH 7.4), and homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min, and the post-nuclear supernatant was layered on 31% (v/v) Percoll underlayed with a cushion of 27.6% Nycodenz solution. The gradient was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 1 h. 14 fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using TAPL (8Wolters J.C. Abele R. Tampé R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23631-23636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), LAMP-2 (29Radons J. Faber V. Buhrmester H. Volker W. Horejsi V. Hasilik A. Eur J.

Fraction 14 corresponding to the dense pool of lysosomes was used for the peptide translocation assay.Peptide Transport—In vitro transport assays were performed with the dense pool of lysosomes in the presence of 2 μm fluorescein-labeled peptide RRYC(Φ)KSTEL (Φ indicates fluorescein coupled via a cysteine residue) in a total volume of 150 μl of HEPES buffer containing 10 mm MgCl2. For competition or inhibition, 500 μm non-labeled peptide or 1 mm orthovanadate was added, respectively. Transport was performed in the presence of ATP or AMP (3 mm) for 30 min at 32 °C. Thereafter, the transport was stopped with stop buffer (HEPES buffer with 10 mm EDTA and 50 μm non-labeled peptide RRYQKSTEL). After 15-min incubation on ice, samples were transferred to microfilter plates preincubated with 0.3% polyethyleneimine (Multi-Screen plates, Durapore membrane, 1-μm pore size, Millipore). Filters were washed three times with 250 μl of ice-cold HEPES buffer containing 10 mm EDTA. Subsequently, the filters were incubated with 250 μl of elution buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% SDS) for 10 min. Fluorescent peptides were quantified with a fluorescence plate reader (excitation and emission at 485 and 520 nm, respectively, BMG, Polarstar Galaxy).RESULTSTAPL Expression Is Strongly Induced during Differentiation of Monocytes to Dendritic Cells—On the transcriptional level, TAPL expression has been found in different tissues (15Zhang F.

Terada T. Sato R. Maeda M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, TAPL protein expression was shown only in Sertoli cells (15Zhang F. Zhang W. Liu L. Fisher C.L. Hui D. Childs S. Dorovini-Zis K. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23287-23294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Because the supply and cellular compartmentalization of antigenic peptides is of key importance for manifestation of an adaptive immune response, we examined TAPL expression in professional antigen-presenting cells. Human CD14+ peripheral blood monocytes were isolated and cultured in medium containing GM-CSF and IL-4. After 5 days of incubation, monocytes differentiated to immature DCs as indicated by the loss of CD14 surface expression and the up-regulation of MHC class II, CD83 and CD86 on the cell surface (Fig. 1A). Incubation for further 3 days with a cytokine mixture containing IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, and prostaglandin E2 (26Jonuleit H. Kuhn U. Muller G. Steinbrink K. Paragnik L. Schmitt E. Knop J. Enk A.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 3135-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar) resulted in the maturation of DCs as indicated by further increase in MHC class II, CD83, and CD86 surface expression.First, mRNA levels of TAPL were studied using primers binding to exons 2 and 4 of tapl, resulting in a PCR product of 209 bp (Fig. 1B). In monocytes, no mRNA for TAPL was detected by RT-PCR, whereas differentiation of monocytes with GM-CSF and IL-4 to immature DCs strongly increased the mRNA level of TAPL. Further maturation of DCs did not significantly change the transcriptional level of TAPL. RT-PCR analysis with primers binding to exons 5 and 8 gave similar results. Here, a single PCR product of 538 bp was detected for all donors analyzed, excluding the presence of the splice variant reported previously, lacking exon 7 (expected PCR product of 409 bp) (15Zhang F. Zhang W. Liu L. Fisher C.L. Hui D. Childs S. Dorovini-Zis K. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23287-23294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).The mRNA level may not necessarily reflect the expression level of TAPL. We therefore investigated TAPL expression on the protein level by immunoblotting using an antibody specific for the splice variant 12A of TAPL (Fig. 1C), which is active in ATP-dependent peptide transport (8Wolters J.C. Abele R. Tampé R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23631-23636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In monocytes isolated from various donors, TAPL expression was not detectable. However, after differentiation to immature and mature DCs, expression of TAPL was strongly induced. TAPL was detected as a single band at an apparent molecular mass of ∼72 kDa. TAPL runs faster than the theoretical mass of 84 kDa. This behavior is typical for very hydrophobic proteins (8Wolters J.C. Abele R. Tampé R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23631-23636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).We next examined the regulation of TAPL mRNA levels upon stimulation of immature DCs in more detail (Fig. 1D). Monocytes treated with GM-CSF and IL-4 in combination with IL-10, which inhibits DC development (31Buelens C. Verhasselt V. De Groote D. Thielemans K. Goldman M. Willems F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 756-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 32Brossart P. Zobywalski A. Grunebach F. Behnke L. Stuhler G. Reichardt V.L. Kanz L. Brugger W.

Furthermore, immature DCs stimulated by specific ligands, such as Pam3Cys, poly(I:C), or LPS, strongly decreased TAPL transcript, whereas TNF-α, CD40L, and R848 showed only a moderate decrease. Noteworthy is that this down-regulation on mRNA level was not detected on the protein level (data not shown), implying that TAPL has a long half-life.TAPL Is Not Involved in the Classical MHC Class I Presentation Pathway—Because TAPL is strongly up-regulated in professional antigen-presenting cells, we analyzed its function in the classical pathway of peptide loading of MHC class I molecules in the ER lumen. Two scenarios are conceivable, in which TAPL alone or in complex with TAP1 or TAP2 translocates peptides into the ER lumen. To address this issue, skin fibroblasts derived fr"

We used reconstructed human epidermis to investigate the mechanisms of FasL-induced inflammatory responses and their relationships with FasL-triggered caspase activity. Caspase activity was a potent antagonist of the pro-inflammatory gene expression triggered by FasL prior to the onset of cell death. Furthermore, we found that FasL-stimulated autocrine production of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands, and the subsequent activation of EGFR and ERK1 and ERK2 mitogen-activated protein kinases, were obligatory extracellular steps for the FasL-induced expression of a subset of inflammatory mediators, including CXCL8/interleukin (IL)-8, ICAM-1, IL-1α, IL-1β, CCL20/MIP-3α, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin. These results expand the known physiological role of EGFR and its ligands from promoting keratinocyte mitogenesis and survival to mediating FasL-induced epidermal inflammation.

FasL/Fas triggers apoptosis by activating the caspase family of proteases (reviewed in Refs. 4Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4115) Google Scholar and 5Shi Y. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar). FasL plays an important role in the effector function of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and also regulates their homeostasis (3Krammer P.H. Nature. 2000; 407: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). Deficiencies in either FasL or Fas are associated with autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (a hereditary condition characterized by the accumulation of atypical lymphocytes and autoimmune manifestations) and systemic lupus erythematosus (6Straus S.E. Sneller M. Lenardo M.J. Puck J.M. Strober W. Ann. Intern. Med. 1999; 130: 591-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 7Wu J. Wilson J. He J. Xiang L. Schur P.H. Mountz J.D. J. Clin.

On the other hand, several laboratories, including ours, have revealed the importance of FasL/Fas as a positive regulator of pathological inflammation as well, particularly in inflammatory diseases of the skin. Keratinocytes in the healthy human express Fas, but not FasL (10Viard I. Wehrli P. Bullani R. Schneider P. Holler N. Salomon D. Hunziker T. Saurat J.H. Tschopp J. French L.E. Science. 1998; 282: 490-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). However, abnormal expression of lytically active FasL was found in keratinocytes of patients with toxic epidermal necrolysis, suggesting that a suicidal keratinocyte reaction contributes to the pathogenesis of toxic epidermal necrolysis (10Viard I. Wehrli P. Bullani R. Schneider P. Holler N. Salomon D. Hunziker T. Saurat J.H. Tschopp J. French L.E. Science. 1998; 282: 490-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). FasL/Fas signaling was implicated in acute cutaneous graft versus host disease (11Langley R.G. Walsh N. Nevill T. Thomas L. Rowden G. J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 1996; 35: 187-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, FasL was found to be involved in the pathogenesis of eczematous dermatitides or eczemas (such as atopic dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis) (12Schwarz T. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 9-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 13Trautmann A. Akdis M. Kleemann D. Altznauer F. Simon H.U. Graeve T. Noll M. Brocker E.B. Blaser K. Akdis C.A. J. Clin.

Immunol. 2003; 171: 1078-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A common histopathological feature of eczemas is the formation of exudative epidermal vesicles that are disruptive to the normal barrier function of the skin. Although vesicle formation in eczemas has been largely attributed to rupturing of keratinocyte attachments as a result of intercellular edema (spongiosis) (Ref. 12Schwarz T. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 9-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar and references therein), recent findings suggest that keratinocyte death plays a major role in vesicle formation (12Schwarz T. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 9-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 13Trautmann A. Akdis M. Kleemann D. Altznauer F. Simon H.U. Graeve T. Noll M. Brocker E.B. Blaser K. Akdis C.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). This keratinocyte death appears to be apoptotic and to be mediated by FasL, delivered to the epidermis by infiltrating T lymphocytes and acting on Fas expressed on the surface of keratinocytes (13Trautmann A. Akdis M. Kleemann D. Altznauer F. Simon H.U. Graeve T. Noll M. Brocker E.B. Blaser K. Akdis C.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Recently, expression of both FasL and Fas by epidermal keratinocytes was proposed to characterize fixed drug eruptions (16Choi H.J. Ku J.K. Kim M.Y. Kang H. Cho S.H. Kim H.O. Park Y.M. Br. J. Dermatol. 2006; 154: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and drug-induced maculopapular rashes (17Stur K. Karlhofer F.M. Stingl G. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2007; 127: 802-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Finally, the Fas/FasL apoptotic pathway was proposed to contribute to the Leishmania major-induced cutaneous ulceration (18Eidsmo L. Nylen S. Khamesipour A. Hedblad M.A. Chiodi F. Akuffo H. Am. J. Pathol. 2005; 166: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These findings clearly demonstrated the important role of FasL in epidermal destruction in inflammatory skin diseases. However, whether FasL could directly trigger the inflammatory process was not known. We demonstrated recently that FasL elicits a pro-inflammatory reaction in human HaCaT keratinocytes and reconstructed human epidermis (RHE) by triggering the expression of stress-responsive transcription factors, inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and the adhesion molecule ICAM-1 (19Farley S.M. Dotson A.D. Purdy D.E. Sundholm A.J. Schneider P. Magun B.E. Iordanov M.S. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2006; 126: 2438-2451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that oligomerization of Fas was required both for apoptosis and for the inflammatory gene expression and that caspase activity was essential for apoptosis but dispensable for the inflammatory gene expression (19Farley S.M. Dotson A.D. Purdy D.E. Sundholm A.J. Schneider P. Magun B.E. Iordanov M.S. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2006; 126: 2438-2451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These results suggested that FasL was a pro-inflammatory cytokine in eczemas. FasL stimulated the activity of the NF-κB transcription factor in HaCaT cells, and this activity was required for the FasL-induced activation of inflammatory genes (19Farley S.M. Dotson A.D. Purdy D.E. Sundholm A.J. Schneider P. Magun B.E. Iordanov M.S. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2006; 126: 2438-2451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The requirement for NF-κB suggested that the pro-inflammatory actions of FasL were dependent on transcriptional gene activation. In this work, we employed RHE to elucidate three novel aspects of FasL-induced inflammation in the epidermis, namely: (i) the importance of the proper organotypic stratification, (ii) the inhibitory role of caspases, and (iii) the unexpected involvement of the EGFR-ERK axis in the transcriptional inflammatory responses to FasL in the epidermis.

RNA interference was performed as outlined schematically in Fig. 8A and as described below. On Day (–5), HEKn-E6/E7 were cultured in 10 ml of EpiLife® medium supplemented with human keratinocyte growth supplement (HKGS) as per the manufacturer's instructions (Cascade Biologics, Portland, OR) in 100-mm tissue culture dishes (Sarstedt, Newton, NC) to a final confluency of ∼40% after ∼18 h of incubation at 37 °C/5%CO2. On Day (–4), the medium was replaced with 8 ml of EpiLife®-HKGS. Lipofectamine®2000 reagent (Invitrogen) was diluted to 20 μg/ml in 1 ml of OPTIMEM®-reduced serum medium (Invitrogen) and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Annealed siRNA was diluted to 500 nm in 1 ml OPTIMEM® medium and then mixed with 1 ml of dilute Lipofectamine™2000 for 20 min at room temperature. Two ml of siRNA/reagent mixture was added to the 8 ml of EpiLife®-HKGS medium/plate. The cells were transfected with siRNA (50 nm final concentration of each annealed siRNA) for 48 h. On Day (–2), transfected cells were trypsinized and counted. The cells were diluted in EpiLife®-HKGS medium to a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml, and 0.5 ml was plated per Millicell-PCF 0.4 -μm culture plate insert (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Inserts were placed in 6-well plates containing 2.5 ml of EpiLife®-HKGS medium supplemented with 1.5 mm CaCl2, 10 ng/ml human recombinant keratinocyte growth factor (PeproTech, Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ), and 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid.

For the detection of primary transcripts by qRT-PCR, 3μg of total RNA were reverse-transcribed in the presence of SuperScript III and random hexamer primers (Invitrogen). Identification of FasL-regulated Genes in RHE—To identify genes activated by FasL in an epidermotypic context, we performed Affymetrix microarray analyses on RNA extracted from RHE 4 h after exposure to FasL. The analyses were performed on HG-U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip arrays, which interrogate over 47,000 human transcripts. Subsequent analysis identified 571 genes that were up-regulated at least 2-fold and 186 genes that were up-regulated at least 3-fold after FasL (available online at: www.ohsu.edu/cellbio/faculty/Iordanov_data/Farley_et_al_(2007).xls). The data were analyzed with both EASE (25Hosack D.A. Dennis Jr., G. Sherman B.T. Lane H.C. Lempicki R.A. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and L2L (26Newman J.C. Weiner A.M. Genome Biol. 2005; 6: R81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) software, which automate the process of biological theme determination by analyzing the overrepresentation of genes that belong to categories that are functionally and structurally defined. Supplemental Tables S1 and S2 display the L2L-generated hierarchical analyses of the genes whose mRNA abundance was increased at least 3-fold after FasL. Overrepresented genes in the Biological Process categories were associated with wound, chemotaxis, inflammatory, immune, and stress responses (supplemental Table S1). The Molecular Function categories associated with these genes were identified as cytokine, chemokine, and growth factor activities (supplemental Table S2). EASE analysis produced similar results (not shown). A selection of 37 FasL-induced genes in the organotypic model is shown in supplemental Table S3. We also analyzed the genes that were down-regulated in response to FasL (supplemental Tables S4–S6). For this purpose, we first excluded from the Affymetrix data all genes that were categorized as “absent” or “marginally present” in the control (untreated) RHE group. We excluded, additionally, all genes from the control group that displayed basal levels of expression below 100 arbitrary Affymetrix units. Of the remaining 985 genes, we selected those that were down-regulated at least 2-fold by the FasL treatment (a total of 442 Affymetrix probe IDs; i.e. 45%). Of these, 287 were annotated in the public databases Entrez Gene (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=gene) or Gene Cards (www.genecards.org). The L2L overrepresentation analysis of these genes by biological process and molecular function is shown in supplemental Tables S4 and S5, respectively. In the biological process categories, FasL-repressed genes appear to be overrepresented in the categories related to metabolic processes (including DNA, RNA, and protein metabolism). By molecular function, genes belonging to the categories peptidase, helicase, and kinase activities were down-regulated by FasL. Supplemental Table S6 contains the 68 genes that were down-regulated at least 2-fold by FasL and whose basal expression in the control RHE was the highest (i.e. at least 1000 arbitrary Affymetrix units). The top ranking FasL-repressed gene was the chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 14 (CXCL14), whose expression was down-regulated ∼26-fold in the presence of FasL (see “Discussion”). Interestingly, the ability of FasL to trigger the repression of CXCL14 was significantly attenuated in the presence of the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. qRT-PCR was employed to investigate the temporal appearance of a variety of FasL-up-regulated gene transcripts that belonged to the molecular function categories identified as overrepresented in our Affymetrix array analyses. The mRNAs encoding transcription factors c-Fos, c-Jun, Egr1, and ATF3 displayed maximum increases in abundance 4 h after FasL treatment; their levels declined thereafter (Fig. 1A). The mRNAs encoding proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and the adhesion molecule ICAM-1 were activated maximally between 2 and 6 h post FasL (specifically, 2 h for tumor necrosis factor-α, 4 h for ICAM-1, IL-1α, CCL20/MIP-3α, CXCL3/GROγ, CXCL1/GROα, and CXCL8/IL-8, and 6 h for TSLP), with the exception of IL-1β (maximum at 12 h) (Figs. 1B and 2A). Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that exposure of monolayers of keratinocytes to FasL resulted in the activation of the EGFR via the secretion of EGFR-binding ligands (21Iordanov M.S. Sundholm A.J. Simpson E.L. Hanifin J.M. Ryabinina O.P. Choi R.J. Korcheva V.B. Schneider P. Magun B.E. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2005; 125: 134-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Whereas the mRNA encoding amphiregulin (AREG) demonstrated a single transient peak of accumulation (at 4 h), mRNAs encoding epiregulin (EREG) and heparin-binding EGF (HB-EGF) displayed a prominent transient peak at 4 h and a delayed second wave of activation that occurred between 18 and 24 h post FasL (Fig. 2B). In contrast to mRNA encoding the former EGFR-binding ligands, the mRNA for transforming growth factor-α was not induced more than 2-fold within the first 12 h after FasL stimulation but became elevated at 18 and 24 h post FasL.FIGURE 2Time course of FasL-induced accumulation of primary transcripts versus their corresponding mature mRNAs.

EREG appeared not to have introns and therefore was not suitable for primary transcript analyses.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Epidermal Organotypic Context Is Essential for the Inflammatory Responses of Human Keratinocytes to FasL—Surprisingly, treatment with FasL of either primary HEKn or immortalized (HEKn-E6/E7) keratinocytes in two-dimensional tissue culture conditions resulted in the strong activation of the immediate-early genes encoding transcription factors (c-Jun, c-Fos, ATF3, and Egr1), as in Fig. 1A, but failed completely to trigger the activation of genes encoding inflammatory mediators (such as cytokines and chemokines, as well as ICAM-1) or EGFR-binding ligands (not shown). These experiments have been repeated a number of times with identical outcomes. This lack of proinflammatory gene response to FasL in cultured keratinocytes was not affected by variations of Ca2+ levels or choice of growth medium (e.g. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, with or without fetal calf serum) (not shown), suggesting that the proper epidermotypic context (and not growth conditions) was absolutely essential for the proinflammatory response to FasL. Transcriptional Regulation of FasL-induced mRNAs—To investigate the FasL-induced accumulation of mRNAs encoding inflammatory mediators at a level mechanistically and temporarily closer to true transcriptional activation of the corresponding genes, we determined the accumulation of selected primary transcripts following FasL administration. To this end we employed a random hexamer-primed method of cDNA synthesis and exon-intron border-specific primers for qRT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 2, some of the primary transcripts tested displayed kinetics of increase that preceded those of the corresponding mature mRNAs (best exemplified by CCL20/MIP-3α, Fig. 2A; and AREG, Fig. 2B, RNAs). These examples suggest that FasL-induced elevation of the mRNAs encoding inflammatory mediators and EGFR-binding ligands in RHEs involves true transcriptional activation of the corresponding genes. These analyses further permitted us to identify increased levels of primary FasL-induced transcripts at later times (24 h) after the addition of FasL (e.g. ICAM-1, Fig. 2A; and AREG and HB-EGF, Fig. 2B). Interestingly, this delayed accumulation of primary transcripts was not mirrored by a corresponding increase in the levels of their mature mRNAs (Fig. 2), suggesting a level of regulation of these genes that escapes detection when RT-PCR is employed to detect levels of mature mRNA transcripts. Caspase Activity Is a Potent Antagonist of the Pro-inflammatory Action of FasL in RHE—Because FasL is known to activate proapoptotic pathways in keratinocytes and other cell types, we set out to investigate the potential role of FasL-activated caspases in regulating the expression of proinflammatory mRNAs following exposure of RHEs to FasL. First, we asked whether caspases were activated within the time frame of onset and optimal expression of FasL-induced genes. RHEs treated with FasL displayed processing of procaspase 8 into the p43/p41 intermediate fragments and the p18 mature large subunit as early as 2 h (Fig. 3A). The processing of caspase 8 was inhibited by the caspase 8-specific inhibitor z-IETD-fmk (27Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A.

The activation of caspase 8 was accompanied by a small, but detectable, processing of the effector procaspase 3, first to the p20/p19 intermediates and subsequently to the p17 mature large subunit of the active caspase 3 (Fig. 3A). Apoptotic nuclei were not detectable at 4 h after FasL but became evident by 24 h in the basal layers of FasL-treated RHEs (as shown by hematoxylin and eosin staining; Fig. 3B). Basal layers of RHEs at 24 h (but not 4 h) post FasL also revealed positive immunoreactivity for active caspase 3 (Fig. 3B). These data demonstrate that FasL engaged the apoptotic cascade as early as 2 h post addition but that the morphological manifestation of apoptosis was not yet evident within the time frame of onset and optimal expression of FasL-induced genes (2–4 h). We then employed either z-IETD-fmk or the pan-caspase blocker z-VAD-fmk to investigate whether the engagement of apoptotic cascades by FasL would modify the accumulation of proinflammatory transcripts in response to FasL. Fig. 4 demonstrates that the application of either z-IETD-fmk or z-VAD-fmk resulted in a dramatic increase in expression of a variety of transcripts that encode cytokines and chemokines. For example, in the absence of caspase inhibitors, FasL triggered a 475-fold (±58) increase in the expression of TSLP mRNA at 4 h post addition. However, in the presence of either z-IETD-fmk or z-VAD-fmk, the FasL increased the abundance of TSLP mRNA to 20,000- and 17,000-fold, respectively (Fig. 4A). Similarly, in the absence of caspase inhibitors, FasL triggered a 11-fold (±2.6) increase in the expression of IL-6 mRNA at 4 h post addition. In the presence of either z-IETD-fmk or z-VAD-fmk, the IL-6 mRNA was increased by FasL to 1,721-fold (±130) and 622-fold (±21), respectively (Fig. 4A). In addition to these quantitative differences, inhibition of caspases affected the responsiveness to FasL qualitatively as well. For instance, FasL alone failed to induce the expression of CCL5/RANTES mRNA, but FasL in the presence of either z-IETD-fmk or z-VAD-fmk caused a 15–25-fold increase in expression of the CCL5/RANTES mRNA (Fig. 4A and Ref. 19Farley S.M.

The potentiating effect of caspase inhibitors on FasL-induced gene expression patterns appeared biased in favor of inflammatory mediators. For example, in the presence of z-IETD-fmk, FasL effected a >40-fold increase in TSLP mRNA and >160-fold increase in IL-6 mRNA (Fig. 4A). By comparison, the addition of FasL increased the expressio"

Here we show that the E7-mediated degradation of Rb requires the calcium-activated cysteine protease, calpain. E7 bound and activated μ-calpain and promoted cleavage at Rb810, with mutation of this residue preventing E7-mediated degradation. The calpain cleavage product, Rb1–810, was unable to mediate cell cycle arrest but retained the ability to repress E6/E7 transcription. E7 also promoted the accelerated proteasomal degradation of Rb1–810. Calpain inhibitors reduced the viability of HPV-transformed cells and synergized with cisplatin. Calpain, thus, emerges as a central player in E7-mediated degradation of Rb and represents a potential new drug target for the treatment of HPV-associated lesions.

Vaccination will likely have a substantial impact; however, current modeling suggests that it may take 40–50 years to reach an ≈50% reduction in mortality (2Garnett G.P. Kim J.J. French K. Goldie S.J. Vaccine. 2006; 24: 178-186Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Integration of part of the HPV genome is believed to be central to the transformation process (3Hebner C.M. Laimins L.A. Rev. Med. Virol. 2006; 16: 83-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) and often results in the increased expression of the two viral oncoproteins, E6 and E7. A principle activity of E6 and E7 is promotion of the accelerated degradation of p53 and the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), respectively (4Longworth M.S. Laimins L.A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 362-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 5Munger K. Howley P.M. Virus Res. 2002; 89: 213-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Hypophosphorylated Rb binds the E2F transcription factor, resulting in repression of E2F-dependent gene transcription and G1 cell cycle arrest (6Frolov M.V. Dyson N.J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2173-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The promotion of Rb degradation mediated by E7 is believed to involve a two-step process (7Helt A.M. Galloway D.A. Carcinogenesis. 2003; 24: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). First, E7 binds hypophosphorylated Rb (8Dyson N. Howley P.M. Munger K. Harlow E. Science. 1989; 243: 934-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (2398) Google Scholar), which leads to the displacement of E2F and entry into the cell cycle. How E2F is displaced by E7 remains unclear as E7 and E2F binding sites on Rb have recently been shown to be quite distinct (9Liu X. Clements A. Zhao K. Marmorstein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 578-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The second step involves E7 targeting Rb for accelerated degradation via the proteasome (10Scheffner M.

A new insight into the mechanism of E7-mediated degradation of Rb was recently provided by our observation that the serine protease inhibitor SerpinB2 was able to inhibit E7-mediated degradation of Rb in HeLa cells (13Darnell G.A.

Suhrbier A. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 4246-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). There are no reports that SerpinB2 inhibits the proteasome, and it has recently emerged that SerpinB2 inhibits calpain-mediated degradation of Rb. 3L. Tonnetti, S. Netzel-Arnett, G. A. Darnell, T.

Vallano M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2165-2175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Herein we provide evidence that the first step in the E7-mediated degradation of Rb involves calpain cleavage. E7 was shown to bind and activate μ-calpain and promoted cleavage of full-length Rb1–928 to yield Rb1–810. Rb1–810 was unable to promote cell cycle arrest, suggesting that this cleavage event was sufficient to displace E2F from Rb. The second step involved the promotion by E7 of the proteasomal degradation of Rb1–810. Calpain inhibitors are being developed for a number of diseases including cancer (16Carragher N.O. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2006; 12: 615-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 17Guan N. Korukonda R. Hurh E. Schmittgen T.D. Donkor I.O. Dalton J.T. Int. J. Oncol. 2006; 29: 655-663PubMed Google Scholar) and were able to inhibit E7-mediated degradation of Rb. They also reduced the viability of HPV-transformed cells through up-regulation of p53 and synergized with cisplatin, a drug frequently used to treat cervical cancer. Calpain inhibitors may, thus, find application in the treatment of HPV associated malignancies.

Murine embryonic fibroblasts from CAPN4–/– mice were used to determine whether calpain plays a role in E7-mediated degradation of Rb (expression of the large subunits of μ- and m-calpain are not changed in these cells (23Arthur J.S. Elce J.S. Hegadorn C. Williams K. Greer P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4474-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar)). A plasmid encoding FLAG-tagged codon-optimized HPV-16 E7 (pIRES-Neo2-eE7) was transfected into CAPN4–/– murine embryonic fibroblasts, and Rb levels were determined by Western blotting. Increasing amounts of eE7 expression had little effect on Rb protein levels in these calpain-defective cells (Fig. 1A, top panel, compare lane 1 with lanes 2–5). In contrast, when calpain activity was restored by co-transfection with a plasmid encoding CAPN4 (Fig. 1A, anti-CAPN4, lanes 6–10), Rb protein levels dropped as E7 levels increased (Fig. 1A, top panel, compare lane 6 with lanes 7–10). These experiments indicated that E7 requires calpain activity to mediate the accelerated degradation of Rb (the lower levels of Rb in CAPN4–/– murine embryonic fibroblasts (lane 6 compared with lane 1) also supports the view that calpain is involved in degrading Rb in the absence of E73). Calpain Cleavage of Rb in Vitro—To determine in a cell free system whether E7 enhances calpain-mediated cleavage of Rb, purified full-length recombinant Rb1–928 was incubated with recombinant human μ-calpain in the presence and absence of GST-eE7. The addition of calpain to Rb resulted in the generation of a faster migrating Rb species with a lower molecular mass of ≈95 kDa (Fig. 1B, lane 2, Cleaved Rb), which could be distinguished from the 110-kDa full-length Rb (Rb1–928). The addition of GST-eE7 to this mixture resulted in almost complete loss of Rb1–928 (Fig. 1B, lane 3), suggesting that eE7 enhanced calpain activity. The ≈95-kDa Rb species was also further degraded, an activity also seen when increasing levels of calpain are added to such reactions in the absence of eE7,3 an observation again consistent with eE7 increasing calpain activity. However, only the ≈95-kDa species was detected in vivo, suggesting that the other calpain cleavage products are only generated under in vitro conditions.3 Rb is C-terminally Cleaved in HPV Cell Lines before Proteasomal Degradation—To determine whether a cleaved Rb species might be present in HPV-transformed cells, the Rb species in control cells was compared with the species found in HPV-transformed cells. Fully confluent, largely non-replicating cells were used to maximize the levels of hypophosphorylated Rb, which is the species targeted by E7 (8Dyson N. Howley P.M. Munger K. Harlow E. Science. 1989; 243: 934-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (2398) Google Scholar). As expected, a 110-kDa Rb species could be clearly detected in control Jurkat cells (non-HPV-transformed) and S1a cells, a SerpinB2-expressing HeLa cell line in which E6/E7 transcription is silenced (14Darnell G.A. Antalis T.M. Rose B.R. Suhrbier A. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 4246-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This Rb species was detected by both the G3245 antibody (that binds toward the N terminus of Rb) and the C-15 antibody (that binds the C terminus of Rb) (Fig. 1C, lanes 1 and 2). When HeLa (HPV-18-transformed) and Caski (HPV-16-transformed) cell extracts were probed with the G3245 antibody, bands were also detected but with a lower molecular mass of ≈95 kDa (Fig. 1C, top panel, lanes 3 and 5). Incubation of HeLa and Caski cell lines with the proteasomal inhibitor lactacystin resulted in a substantial increase in the levels of this ≈95-kDa Rb species but not the 110-kDa Rb species (Fig. 1C, top panel, lanes 4 and 6). Importantly, in neither cell line could the ≈95-kDa Rb species be detected with the C-15 antibody (Fig. 1C, bottom panel, lanes 4 and 6). Thus, in HPV-transformed cell lines an Rb species of ≈95 kDa can be detected that is missing its C terminus. Furthermore, lactacystin inhibited degradation of this ≈95-kDa Rb species but did not restore expression of the 110-kDa Rb species (migration of the 110- and ≈95-kDa Rb species was not affected if the samples were first treated with phosphatases; supplemental Fig. S1A). Taken together with Figs. 1, A and B, these data suggest that E7 promotes the calpain-mediated cleavage of Rb and that the calpain-cleaved Rb species is then further degraded by the proteasome. Treatment of cervical cancer cells with the proteasomal inhibitor MG-132 has previously also been shown to increase Rb protein levels, although a reduced molecular weight of this Rb species was not observed (11Wang J. Sampath A. Raychaudhuri P. Bagchi S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4740-4749Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 12Boyer S.N. Wazer D.E. Band V. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4620-4624PubMed Google Scholar). This may be due to the fact that MG-132 also inhibits calpain (24Mailhes J.B. Hilliard C. Lowery M. London S.N. Cell Chromosome. 2002; 1: 2-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), so generation of the ≈95-kDa Rb species might also be inhibited. This contention is supported by the observation that treatment of HeLa cells with both lactacystin and calpain inhibitors, which should mimic MG-132 treatment, resulted in restoration of full-length Rb (supplemental Fig. S1B). Mapping of the C-terminal Cleavage Site in Rb—To identify the postulated calpain-cleavage site within the C terminus of Rb, a C-terminal fragment of Rb (Rb768–928) was expressed as a GST fusion protein (Fig. 1D, lane 2, GST-Rb768–928). With the addition of calpain and GST-eE7, this 55-kDa GST-Rb768–928 was cleaved to yield protein species running at ≈30 kDa (Fig. 1D, lane 3, Cleaved GST-Rb768–928). The top band was excised from the gel and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Molecular weight analyses suggested that the calpain cleavage site was located around Rb809 to Rb816 (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). This region contains an almost perfect match for the preferred P3, P2, P1, P1′, P2′, and P3′ amino acid residues for calpain cleavage described by Tompa et al. (25Tompa P. Buzder-Lantos P. Tantos A. Farkas A. Szilagyi A. Banoczi Z. Hudecz F. Friedrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20775-20785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S2C). This match suggests that the cleavage site lies between P1 at Rb810 (lysine) and P1′ at Rb811 (serine) (supplemental Fig. S2D). This site was also identified as a calpain cleavage site in Rb in the absence of E7.3 E7-mediated Degradation of Rb Requires Rb Amino Acid 810—To confirm the importance of the P1 residue (Rb810) for E7/calpain-mediated degradation of Rb1–928, the lysine in this position was replaced with alanine to generate RbK810A (Fig. 2A). Plasmids encoding Rb1–928 and RbK810A were transfected into HeLa cells, and Rb protein levels were analyzed by Western blot. As expected given the presence of endogenous E7, the Rb1–928 protein expression level was low in HeLa cells (Fig. 2B, lane 2). In contrast, RbK810A was expressed at high levels (Fig. 2B, top panel, lane 3), indicating that it was resistant to E7-mediated degradation. Importantly, RbK810A was also detected by the C-15 anti-Rb antibody (Fig. 2B, middle panel, lane 3), indicating that no C-terminal cleavage had occurred. These data indicate that mutation of the P1 residue at Rb810 renders E7 unable to promote Rb degradation. Proteasomal Degradation of Rb Cleaved at Amino Acid 810 Is Enhanced by E7—Numerous studies have suggested that E7 reduces Rb stability by enhancing its proteasomal degradation (10Scheffner M. Whitaker N.J. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2003; 13: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 11Wang J. Sampath A. Raychaudhuri P. Bagchi S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4740-4749Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 12Boyer S.N. Wazer D.E. Band V. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4620-4624PubMed Google Scholar). We, thus, sought to test the hypothesis that E7 first promotes calpain-mediated cleavage of Rb at P1 Rb810 and then E7 enhances the proteasomal degradation of the calpain cleavage product, Rb1–810. Rb1–928 (Rb), RbK810A, and Rb1–810 were expressed in Rb-defective SAOS-2 cells, and in the absence of eE7 they were expressed at comparable levels (Fig. 2C, anti-Rb G3245, lanes 2–4). As expected, Rb and RbK810A, but not Rb1–810, were recognized by the C-15 anti-Rb antibody (Fig. 2C, anti-Rb C15, lanes 2–4). When eE7 was co-expressed with the three different Rb species, Rb and Rb1–810, but not RbK810A, were undetectable (Fig. 2C, anti-Rb, lanes 6–8). This suggested that E7 promotes the degradation of the calpain cleavage product, Rb1–810, and again illustrated the importance of the Rb810 residue for E7-mediated degradation. To determine the role of the proteasome in the degradation process, lactacystin was added to the eE7 and Rb-expressing SAOS-2 cells. In cells expressing Rb1–928, protein levels were restored, but the restored Rb species migrated at ≈95 kDa (in the same position as Rb1–810) and was not recognized by the C-15 antibody (Fig. 2C, lane 10). This is similar to the result seen in Fig. 1C (lanes 4 and 6), and both data suggest that eE7/E7 promotes the proteasomal degradation of Rb1–810. As might be expected, the levels of RbK810A protein were largely unaffected by lactacystin treatment (Fig. 2C, lane 11). To test directly the role of the proteasome in the E7-mediated degradation of Rb1–810, lactacystin was added to cells expressing Rb1–810 and eE7. This resulted in restoration of Rb1–810 protein levels (Fig. 2C, top panel, compare lanes 8 and 12), indicating that E7-mediated degradation of Rb1–810 is dependent on the proteasome. Taken together, these data suggest that E7-mediated degradation is a two-step process. First, E7 promotes calpain-mediated cleavage of Rb, and then E7 enhances the proteasomal degradation of the calpain cleavage product, Rb1–810. Rb1–810 Is Inactive for Mediating Growth Arrest—Helt and Galloway (7Helt A.M. Galloway D.A. Carcinogenesis. 2003; 24: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) proposed that the first stage of E7-mediated degradation of Rb involves the release of E2F from Rb. If this first stage involves calpain cleavage, then Rb1–810 should be unable to bind E2F effectively or mediate growth arrest. After transfection with full-length Rb, SAOS-2 cells undergo growth arrest, adopt a flat cell phenotype, and express endogenous SA-β-galactosidase (Fig. 2D, Rb1–928, black bar). As expected, co-expression of eE7 reduced this Rb-mediated SA-β-galactosidase expression back to control levels (Fig. 2D, Rb1–928, white bar). Expression of RbK810A in SAOS-2 cells also resulted in SA-β-galactosidase induction (Fig. 2D, RbK810A, black bar). However, this induction was not lost when RbK810A was co-expressed with eE7 (Fig. 2D, RbK810A, white bar), again illustrating the importance of the Rb810 residue for E7 activity. Importantly, Rb1–810 expression was unable to induce SA-β-galactosidase expression (Fig. 2D, Rb1–810), indicating that Rb1–810 was unable to inhibit E2F activity and promote growth arrest. This suggests that the E7-promoted calpain cleavage of Rb results in loss of E2F binding to Rb. This observation is consistent with the recent reports showing that the C-terminal region of Rb is required for high affinity binding of E2F to Rb (26Rubin S.M. Gall A.L. Zheng N. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2005; 123: 1093-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Wang et al. (11Wang J. Sampath A. Raychaudhuri P. Bagchi S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4740-4749Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) reported that the Rb species accumulating in lactacystin-treated Caski cells also did not bind E2F, and one might now propose that this Rb species represents Rb1–810 (see Fig. 1C, lane 6). The expression of SerpinB2 inhibited the ability of eE7 to inhibit SA β-galactosidase induction in these SAOS-2 cells (Fig. 2D, Rb1–928 + SerpinB2). Similar to the K810A mutant, SerpinB2 has been shown to inhibit Rb degradation by E7 (14Darnell G.A. Antalis T.M. Rose B.R. Suhrbier A. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 4246-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Because SerpinB2 also inhibits turnover of Rb and increases Rb levels in the absence of E7 (13Darnell G.A. Antalis T.M. Johnstone R.W. Stringer B.W. Ogbourne S.M. Harrich D. Suhrbier A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6520-6532Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the percentage SA-β-galactosidase expression for Rb1–928 + SerpinB2 exceeds that seen for Rb1–928. The N-terminal region of Rb (Rb8–62) contains a high scoring PEST sequence (+14.93 using PESTfind), and such sequences are often found in proteins targeted by calpain (27Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar). However, the removal of the N-terminal region of Rb did not diminish Rb degradation by E7 (Fig. 2D, Rb394–928) in agreement with Gonzalez et al. (21Gonzalez S.L. Stremlau M. He X. Basile J.R. Munger K. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7583-7591Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). This suggests that the Rb potential PEST sequence is not required for E7-enhanced calpain-mediated cleavage of Rb. Rb1–810 Is Able to Repress Transcription from the HPV URR—We have previously shown that Rb protein expression is able to repress transcription of the polycistronic E6/E7 mRNA from the integrated HPV URR (14Darnell G.A.

Bioinformatic analysis revealed the four subunits of the GCC in the L. major genome, and the role of the GCC in parasite metabolism and virulence was assessed through studies of the P subunit (glycine decarboxylase (GCVP)). First, a tagged GCVP protein was expressed and localized to the parasite mitochondrion. Second, a gcvP– mutant was generated and shown to lack significant GCC activity using an indirect in vivo assay after incorporation of label from [2-14C]glycine into DNA. The gcvP– mutant grew poorly in the presence of excess glycine or minimal serine; these studies also established that L. major promastigotes require serine for optimal growth. Although gcvP– promastigotes and amastigotes showed normal virulence in macrophage infections in vitro, both forms of the parasite showed substantially delayed replication and lesion pathology in infections of both genetically susceptible or resistant mice. These data suggest that, as the physiology of the infection site changes during the course of infection, so do the metabolic constraints on parasite replication. This conclusion has great significance to the interpretation of metabolic requirements for virulence.

Parasites of the trypanosomatid genus Leishmania are the cause of leishmaniasis, a group of diseases ranging from relatively mild cutaneous lesions to the disfiguring mucocutaneous manifestation and lethal visceral disease. In vertebrates, Leishmania reside within macrophages as non-motile amastigote forms and multiply within acidified phagolysosomes. They are transmitted by sand flies, where they grow as the flagellated promastigote stage, and ultimately differentiate into vertebrate-infective metacyclic forms. Current therapy is based on antimonials and is generally effective but suffers from toxicity, the requirement for parenteral administration, and prolonged courses of treatment (1Herwaldt B.L. Lancet. 1999; 354: 1191-1199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in some parts of India visceral leishmaniasis is commonly resistant to antimonials (2Lira R. Sundar S. Makharia A. Kenney R. Gam A. Saraiva E. Sacks D. J. Infect. Dis. 1999; 180: 564-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Miltefosine is a promising orally effective treatment, but resistance to this drug appears to arise rapidly (3Berman J.

Leishmania mutants lacking DHFR-TS are thymidine auxotrophs and fail to survive after animal infection (9Cruz A. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7170-7174Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), providing a genetic validation of this pathway as a potential target for chemotherapy. However, in Leishmania, antifolate therapy is compromised by the presence of pteridine reductase 1, which is less sensitive to classical antifolates and can bypass DHFR inhibition (10Nare B. Hardy L.W. Beverley S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13883-13891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 11Hardy L.W. Matthews W. Nare B. Beverley S.M. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 87: 157-169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, compounds active against both pteridine reductase 1 and DHFR are highly toxic toward Leishmania, and some dual-target compounds also appear to inhibit a third target (11Hardy L.W. Matthews W. Nare B. Beverley S.M. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 87: 157-169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together these data suggest that other folate-dependent enzymes including ones participating in thymidylate synthesis may be logical targets for pharmacological intervention. dihydrofolate reductase thymidylate synthase 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate glycine cleavage complex P subunit serine hydroxymethyltransferase glycine cleavage complex wild type kilobase(s) green fluorescent protein dihydrofolate reductase thymidylate synthase 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate glycine cleavage complex P subunit serine hydroxymethyltransferase glycine cleavage complex wild type kilobase(s) green fluorescent protein TS utilizes 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate (5,10-CH2-THF), a key metabolite in 1-carbon metabolism. 5,10-CH2-THF additionally leads through methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase to the formation of 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate, required for methionine synthesis and methylation reactions, and through the bifunctional methylene tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase-methenyl-tetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase to the synthesis of 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate (Fig. 1A). In most organisms 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate is required for purine as well as mitochondrial formyl-methionyl-tRNA synthesis. However, Leishmania is auxotrophic for purines (12Hammond D.J. Gutteridge W.E. Mol. Biochem.

In Leishmania and many eukaryotes, SHMT is encoded by two different genes specifying the cytosolic and mitochondrial forms (16Gagnon D. Foucher A. Girard I. Ouellette M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2006; 150: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Glycine and in some cases serine are, therefore, important precursors to 1-carbon-THF metabolites in trypanosomatids. The GCC comprises four loosely associated subunits, the P, H, T, and L proteins, which typically occur in nonstoichiometric levels (17Walker J.L. Oliver D.J. J. Biol.

Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 167-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), but the activity is still essential in Arabidopsis even under non-photorespiratory conditions (21Engel N. van den Daele K. Kolukisaoglu U. Morgenthal K. Weckwerth W. Parnik T. Keerberg O. Bauwe H. Plant Physiol. 2007; 144: 1328-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mutants lacking any of the GCC-specific subunits can grow on minimal medium but cannot use glycine as a nitrogen source (20Piper M.D. Hong S.P. Ball G.E. Dawes I.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30987-30995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In several recent global screens of intracellular pathogens during experimental infections, GCC mutants with attenuated virulence have been identified (22Weiss D.S. Brotcke A. Henry T. Margolis J.J. Chan K. Monack D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 6037-6042Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 23Hong P.C. Tsolis R.M. Ficht T.A. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4102-4107Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 24Sassetti C.M. Rubin E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12989-12994Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). Thus, given its importance in parasite metabolism and in the development of improved anti-parasitic chemotherapy and potential involvement in virulence, we investigated the role of the GCC in Leishmania major, focusing on the study of mutants lacking the GCC P subunit (glycine decarboxylase or GCVP; gcvP– mutants). Although dispensable for growth in vitro, gcvP– promastigotes were hypersensitive to the antifolate methotrexate and to excess glycine. Infectivity tests showed that, whereas gcvP– mutants grow normally within macrophages in vitro, they show an unusual pattern of attenuated virulence in experimental animals in vivo. Parasites, Culture Media, and Drug Testing—L. major strain Friedlin clone V1 (MHOM/IL/81/Friedlin) was cultured as promastigotes in M199 medium as described (25Kapler G.M. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1084-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) with the addition of 1 μgml–1 biotin and 2 μgml–1 biopterin. RPMI medium, used in nutritional and DNA-labeling studies, was prepared after a standard formulation (Invitrogen), except that l-serine was added to 95 μm (10 mg liter–1), MgCl2 (0.1 g liter–1) was substituted for MgSO4, and the medium was supplemented with 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 μgml–1 biopterin, 100 μm adenine, 5 μgml–1 hemin, and 1% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. All lines required several passages to adapt to normal growth in this medium after transfer from M199 medium. Cells were counted using a hemocytometer (RPMI medium experiments) or a model Z1 Coulter counter (M199 medium experiments). Growth inhibition was determined by seeding parasites at 5 × 105 cells ml–1 at various concentrations of drug and determining cell density when control cultures reached late-log phase. The EC50 value is the concentration of drug required to decrease growth by 50%. Methotrexate and O/129 (2,4-diamino-6,7-diisopropylpteridine) were purchased from Sigma; CB3717 (2-[(4-{[(2,4-diaminoquinazolin-6-yl)methyl](prop-2-yn-1-yl)amino}phenyl)formamido]-pentanedioic acid (26)) was a gift of Ann Jackman, Institute of Cancer Research, Surrey, UK; the folate analogues compound 34 (2,4-diamino-6-(3,4-dichlorophenoxy)-quinazoline) and compound 70 (2,4-diamino-6-benzyl-5-(3-phenylpropyl)-pyrimidine) were as described (11Hardy L.W. Matthews W. Nare B. Beverley S.M. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 87: 157-169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RPMI low-serine medium for macrophages was prepared the same as the Leishmania RPMI medium, with the addition of 1 mm sodium pyruvate and 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and the omission of serine, biopterin, adenine, and hemin. Infectivity Studies—Before virulence tests, all lines were passed through mice once by injecting hind footpads of Balb/c mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) with a large inoculum (1 × 106) of stationary-phase parasites and recovering parasites by needle aspiration of the footpad regardless of pathology 3–5 weeks afterward. Lines were passaged no more than 6 times in vitro before virulence tests, and parasite inocula were grown in the absence of selective drugs. Mouse and macrophage infections were performed as described (27Zufferey R. Allen S. Barron T. Sullivan D.R. Denny P.W. Almeida I.C. Smith D.F. Turco S.J. Ferguson M.A. Beverley S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44708-44718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Mice were infected with 105 metacyclic promastigotes or 104 amastigotes. Macrophages were infected at a ratio of 5 metacyclics or 1 amastigote per macrophage. Metacyclics (for mouse infection) were isolated from stationary-phase cultures of promastigotes by negative selection with peanut agglutinin (28Sacks D.L. Perkins P.V. Science. 1984; 223: 1417-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) or (for macrophage infections) by Ficoll gradient centrifugation (29Späth G.F. Beverley S.M. Exp. Parasitol. 2001; 99: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Amastigotes were isolated from infected mice showing lesions with thicknesses of 1–2 mm (27Zufferey R. Allen S. Barron T. Sullivan D.R. Denny P.W. Almeida I.C. Smith D.F. Turco S.J. Ferguson M.A. Beverley S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44708-44718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Amastigotes in lesions were quantified using a limiting dilution assay (30Titus R.G. Marchand M. Boon T. Louis J.A. Parasite Immunol. (Oxf.). 1985; 7: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), with dilutions made in liquid M199 medium. DNA Manipulations—The open reading frame of the candidate L. major GCVP gene LmjF26.0030 was PCR-amplified in two pieces using KlentaqLA (DNA Polymerase Technology) and primers B2057 and B2062 and primers B2063 and B2058 (primer sequences are listed in supplemental Table S1). After digestion with SacI and BamHI, the fragments were ligated into the BamHI site of pBluescript SK–(yielding pBS-GCVP; laboratory strain B5086). Relevant portions of all constructs were confirmed by sequencing. A gene disruption approach was used to inactivate the GCVP gene. An autonomous puromycin drug-resistance cassette was excised from pXGPAC (strain B3325) by digestion with XhoI and DdeI, filled in with Klenow fragment, and inserted into pBS-GCVP cut at a unique PmlI site in the GCVP open reading frame, yielding pBS-GCVP-PAC (strain B5121). The disrupted gene fragment was excised from pBS-GCVP-PAC by digestion with BamHI and transfected into wild-type (WT) L. major promastigotes as described (31Robinson K.A. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 128: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Presumptive heterozygous clonal lines (GCVP/gcvP::PAC) were isolated by plating on semisolid M199 medium containing 1% Noble agar and 33 μgml–1 puromycin. Lines bearing the planned PAC insertion were confirmed by PCR using a forward primer located 5′ of the GCVP open reading frame targeting fragment (B2137) with a reverse primer located within the PAC gene (B2013, Fig. 2A). Eight independent heterozygotes were obtained (formally gcvP::PAC/+), two of which were inoculated into mice and found to retain infectivity. For disruption of the second allele, pBS-GCVP-HYG (strain B5119) was created by excising an autonomous hygromycin B resistance cassette from pX63-HYG vector (strain B617) (9Cruz A. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7170-7174Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) by digestion with BamHI and PvuII. The resistance cassette was filled in and inserted into pBS-GCVP as described above. The disrupted gene was excised by digestion with BamHI and transfected as described above into heterozygote clone 8, and clonal lines were isolated on plates containing 20 μgml–1 each puromycin and hygromycin. Gene disruption was evaluated first by PCR for retention of the PAC disruption as described above and by PCR for the HYG insertion using primer B2137 and a reverse primer within the HYG gene (B1675). Putative double disruptants were confirmed by Southern blot analysis using genomic DNA digested with AccI and a radiolabeled probe consisting of a 900-bp fragment located upstream of the GCVP-targeting fragment, derived by PCR using genomic DNA template and primers B2184 and B2185 (Fig. 2A). Genomic DNA was isolated using a LiCl-Triton X-100 method (32Medina-Acosta E. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 59: 327-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Multiple double disruptants were obtained (formally gcvP::PAC/gcvP::HYG, referred to as gcvP– in this work); gcvP– clone #1 was used in all experiments reported here. Two other clones were used in mouse and macrophage infection experiments not shown with similar results. To restore or overexpress the GCVP gene, the GCVP open reading frame was cut from pBS-GCVP with BamHI and inserted into the BamHI expression site of the pXG plasmid (strain B1288 (33Ha D.S. Schwarz J.K. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar)), creating pXG-GCVP (strain B5124). gcvP– or WT L. major were transfected with pXG-GCVP, and clones were isolated from plates containing 10 or 12.5 μgml–1 G418; the presence of the plasmid was confirmed by re-isolating it from Leishmania, transforming Escherichia coli and verifying the plasmid by restriction digestion. These lines are referred to as gcvP–/+GCVP (formally gcvP::PAC/gcvP::HYG [pXG-GCVP]) or WT/+GCVP (formally +/+[pXG-GCVP]. gcvP–/ +GCVP clone 1.1 was used for metabolic studies, and clone 1.6 was used in virulence tests. WT/+GCVP clone 1 was used in DNA labeling experiments. For construction of a C-terminal GCVP-GFP fusion, we used pXG–/GFP+ (strain B2863) (33Ha D.S. Schwarz J.K. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), which has a BamHI site upstream of a GFP cassette lacking an ATG, facilitating the creation of in-frame gene fusions. First, the 3′ 1.1 kb of GCVP was modified to replace the stop codon with a BglII site by PCR amplification with pBS-GCVP as template and primers B2086 and B2497 and inserted by TA cloning into pGEM-T (Promega) (to make strain B5745). pXG-GCVP-GFP was generated by a three-way ligation of the 0.7-kb NotI and BglII fragment of B5745 (bearing the modified GCVP 3′ region), a 2.2-kb BamHI-NotI fragment of pBS-GCVP (5′ region), and BamHI-cut and dephosphorylated pXG–/GFP+ to create pXG-GCVP-GFP (strain B5760). WT transfectants bearing this construct were generated as described above for pXG-GCVP and are termed WT/+pXG-GCVP-GFP (formally, +/+[pXG-GCVP-GFP]); two clonal lines were obtained with similar properties, and the results with clone 1 are shown. Microscopy—WT/+pXG-GCVP-GFP promastigotes were stained with 5 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Vector Laboratories) for 30 min in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 0.3% (w/v) formaldehyde, and observed by epifluorescence microscopy. In some studies, 40 nm Mitotracker Red 580 (Invitrogen) was added at the same time as the Hoechst dye. Indirect GCC Assay—GCC activity was assessed by an indirect 14C incorporation assay in vivo. L. major promastigotes were grown in RPMI medium containing 27 μm (2 mg l–1) glycine. Labeling cultures were started at 3 × 105 cells ml–1, with each 10-ml culture containing 1 μCi of [2-14C]glycine (3.7 Ci mol–1; American Radiolabeled Chemicals). These were grown to a final density of 2–4 × 107 ml–1, harvested, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and suspended in 0.5 ml lysis buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 25 mm EDTA, 150 mm sodium chloride, 0.5% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 20 μgml–1 RNase. Lysates were incubated for 5 h at 37 °C before adding 0.1 mg ml–1 proteinase K and incubation for a further 16 h. Protein was extracted twice with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), and DNA was precipitated with 2 volumes of ethanol and 0.1 volume of 3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2. The pellet was washed twice with 70% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 500 μm EDTA, pH 8.0, containing 20 μgml–1 RNase. DNA was quantified by UV absorption and 14C by scintillation counting. In WT cells less than 1% cellular labeling was found in purified DNA. Statistical significance was assessed using two-tailed t test. GCVP Gene Comparison and GCVP Localization—Data base searches of the L. major genome (34Ivens A.C. Peacock C.S. Worthey E.A. Murphy L.

Science. 2005; 309: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar) revealed strong candidates for all subunits of the GCC complex, including the T protein (two identical genes, LmjF36.3800 and LmjF36.3810), the H protein (LmjF35.4720), the L protein dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (LmjF32.3310), and the P protein (LmjF26.0030). In this work we focus on the P protein, predicted to encode a protein of 972 amino acids showing 48–50% identity to the GCVPs of Arabidopsis thaliana, bacteria, the slime mold Dictyostelium, yeast, and mammals. An alignment of the predicted L. major GCVP protein with those from other species is shown in supplemental Fig. S1. Structural studies of Thermus thermophilus GCVP identified 23 key active site residues, 20 of which were fully conserved in other GCVP proteins (35Nakai T. Nakagawa N. Maoka N. Masui R. Kuramitsu S. Kamiya N. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1523-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These 20 residues are also present in L. major GCVP (supplemental Fig. S1), including the catalytic lysine (K721 in L. major). Seven conserved basic residues involved in H-protein interaction (35Nakai T. Nakagawa N. Maoka N. Masui R. Kuramitsu S. Kamiya N. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1523-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) are also present in the L. major sequence (supplemental Fig. S1). In other organisms the GCC is located in the mitochondrion, and correspondingly, an N-terminal mitochondrial signal peptide of 21 amino acids was predicted for L. major GCVP by TargetP (36Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. Brunak S. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (3560) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1). Our analysis also predicted mitochondrial transit peptides for the other three GCC subunit open reading frames (data not shown). To confirm the mitochondrial localization prediction for the GCVP, we expressed a GCVP fusion protein bearing a C-terminal GFP reporter in L. major promastigotes. Leishmania and other trypanosomatids possess a single mitochondrion, which extends throughout the cell (37Coombs G.H. Tetley L. Moss V.A. Vickerman K. Parasitology. 1986; 92: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and the fluorescence pattern of the GCVP-GFP-expressing cells showed a meshwork pattern typical of mitochondrially targeted proteins in Leishmania (Fig. 3, left panel). Hoechst 33342 staining was used to visualize the nucleus and kinetoplast (containing the parasite's mitochondrial DNA network; Fig. 3, center panel). GFP fluorescence overlapped the kinetoplast but not the nucleus and did not show the perinuclear staining typical of ER proteins (Fig. 3, right panel). Mitochondrial localization was further confirmed by colocalization of GFP fluorescence with a red fluorescent mitochondrial dye, Mitotracker Red 580 (result not shown). GCVP Disruption—The Leishmania genome is predominantly diploid, and we used an insertional inactivation strategy to successively mutate both GCVP alleles in L. major, producing a gcvP– parasite (Fig. 2A). Successful disruption was demonstrated by PCR and Southern blot analysis (Fig. 2B or data not shown). To control for nonspecific effects arising from transfection and in vitro culture, we restored expression of GCVP in the gcvP– mutant by introductio"

The AIDS pandemic has claimed more than 25 million lives, the majority of them in the developing world, and has exacerbated poverty and slowed human development.

Last year marked the 25th anniversary of the recognition of what we now call AIDS. The AIDS pandemic has claimed more than 25 million lives, the majority of them in the developing world, and has exacerbated poverty and slowed human development. Although much has been accomplished in HIV/AIDS research, much remains to be done, especially regarding delivery of HIV/AIDS therapies and care and prevention interventions to the poorest countries that need them most. By the end of 2006—25 years after the first reported AIDS cases in the United States—the HIV/AIDS pandemic had claimed more than 25 million lives globally (UNAIDS/WHO, 2006Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS and World Health Organization (UNAIDS/WHO). (2006). AIDS epidemic update: special report on HIV/AIDS: December 2006. http://www.unaids.org/en/HIV_data/epi2006/.Google Scholar). What began as a handful of recognized cases among homosexual men in the early 1980s has become a global pandemic of such proportions that it clearly ranks as one of the most destructive microbial scourges in history (UNAIDS, 2006UNAIDS. (2006). 2006 report on the global AIDS epidemic—a UNAIDS 10th anniversary special edition. http://www.unaids.org/en/HIV_data/2006GlobalReport/default.asp.Google Scholar, Fauci, 2006Fauci A.S. Science. 2006; 313: 409Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This Commentary is part of the Council of Science Editors' Global Theme Issue on Poverty and Human Development comprising 1000 articles on this theme published simultaneously by 235 journals worldwide. Of the ∼40 million people living with HIV, the vast majority live in resource-poor settings, notably countries of sub-Saharan Africa where food insecurity and endemic infections such as tuberculosis, malaria, and a range of parasitic diseases are also common (UNAIDS, 2006UNAIDS. (2006). 2006 report on the global AIDS epidemic—a UNAIDS 10th anniversary special edition. http://www.unaids.org/en/HIV_data/2006GlobalReport/default.asp.Google Scholar). Of the 62 countries most affected by HIV (nations with adult HIV seroprevalence rates >1% or with large numbers of persons living with HIV), 40 are in sub-Saharan Africa, 5 in Asia, 12 in the Americas and the Caribbean, 4 in Europe, and 1 in Oceania (United Nations Population Division, 2006United Nations Population Division. (2006). World population prospects: the 2006 revision (highlights). http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wpp2006/wpp2006.htm.Google Scholar). According to the United Nations Population Division, life expectancy in southern Africa as a whole has fallen from 61 to 49 years over the last 20 years. In the countries hardest hit by HIV/AIDS, the situation is even more severe: in Zimbabwe, for example, estimated life expectancy at birth is only 34 years for women and 37 years for men. In addition to the enormous human tragedy associated with HIV/AIDS, the economic costs are staggering, posing serious impediments to the growth and stability of many developing countries (Bertozzi et al., 2006Bertozzi S. Padian N.S. Wegbreit J. DeMaria L.M. Feldman B. Gayle H. Gold J. Grant R. Isbell T. HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment (Chapter 18).in: Jamison D.T. Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries. 2nd Edition. Oxford University Press, New York2006http://www.dcp2.org/pubs/DCPGoogle Scholar). HIV/AIDS has disproportionately affected young and middle-aged adults who are the mainstays of economies and the breadwinners for families. In many developing countries, previously realized gains in economic and social development have been reversed as HIV/AIDS has reduced the labor supply and productivity and depleted limited pools of skilled workers, teachers, and managers. In communities with large numbers of HIV-infected individuals, poverty and other development challenges have worsened. An exacerbation of poverty in turn reduces job opportunities and makes populations more vulnerable to the spread of HIV. As the humanitarian and economic burden of HIV/AIDS has grown, so too has the biomedical research response to the pandemic, providing important opportunities to mitigate the impact of HIV/AIDS on health and economic development. Funding for HIV/AIDS-related research is unprecedented in magnitude, larger than for any other single disease in history (Folkers and Fauci, 2001Folkers G.K. Fauci A.S. JAMA. 2001; 2864: 458-461Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). At the US National Institutes of Health alone, >$30 billion has been spent on HIV/AIDS research since the beginning of the pandemic (Fauci, 2006Fauci A.S. Science. 2006; 313: 409Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The returns on these investments have been substantial (reviewed in Fauci, 2003Fauci A.S. Nat. Med. 2003; 6: 839-843Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Within 3 years of the recognition of the first AIDS cases in 1981, the etiologic agent of the syndrome was discovered and causality proven. In 1985, a sensitive and specific diagnostic assay for HIV antibodies was developed. This test and its descendents have been used in epidemiological studies to illuminate the scope of the epidemic, as well as to safeguard blood supplies. Molecular studies of HIV have delineated the genetic and structural organization of the virus and the mechanisms that regulate its replication. This information and related research on HIV pathogenesis has facilitated the rapid development of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) that limit HIV replication and immune system damage, as well as tools to monitor levels of virus in the blood and immune status. More than 25 antiretroviral drugs are now available to treat HIV infection, and these medications have had an enormous impact in reducing morbidity and mortality wherever they have been used (WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF, 2007World Health Organization, UNAIDS, UNICEF (WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF). (2007). Towards universal access: scaling up priority HIV/AIDS interventions in the health sector: progress reports, April 2007. http://www.who.int/hiv/mediacentre/en.Google Scholar). New ARVs such as integrase, maturation, and entry inhibitors, as well as next-generation reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors, have been licensed or are in late-stage clinical development. These drugs hold great promise, especially for patients who have failed their current regimens due to drug resistance or other factors (Siegel and Gulick, 2007Siegel L. Gulick R.M. Curr. Infect. Dis. Rep. 2007; 9: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Encouragingly, growing numbers of HIV-infected individuals in need of ARVs in low- and middle-income countries are receiving them. A growing body of evidence has shown that the immunological and virological responses to ARVs in both adults and children in poor countries can be as good as those in industrialized settings. ARV prices have fallen dramatically: the average annual cost in low- and middle-income countries of a common first-line ARV regimen consisting of 3 medications was <$150 in 2006. Programs such as the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, nongovernmental organizations such as Medecins Sans Frontieres, and philanthropies like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Clinton Foundation helped deliver ARVs to >2 million individuals by the end of 2006, up from 400,000 in December, 2003 (see Figure 1) (WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF, 2007World Health Organization, UNAIDS, UNICEF (WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF). (2007). Towards universal access: scaling up priority HIV/AIDS interventions in the health sector: progress reports, April 2007. http://www.who.int/hiv/mediacentre/en.Google Scholar). This progress demonstrates what can be accomplished even in the developing world with increased funding, a strong global commitment, collective action, and political will. Significant progress also has been made in HIV prevention. The risk factors associated with HIV transmission are well defined, and proven methods to prevent sexual HIV transmission (e.g., behavior change programs, condom promotion), blood-borne HIV transmission (e.g., needle/syringe exchanges), and mother-to-child transmission (e.g., ARVs) have been deployed throughout the world (Global HIV Prevention Working Group, 2007Global HIV Prevention Working Group. (2007). Bringing HIV prevention to scale: an urgent global priority. http://www.kff.org/hivaids/hiv062807pkg.cfmGoogle Scholar). No single intervention is a magic bullet but when deployed in combination can have an important impact, as evidenced by well-documented success in Brazil, Thailand, Uganda, Senegal, and other countries, both rich and poor. Promising research on new prevention interventions holds hope for adding new tools to the HIV prevention armamentarium, such as adult male circumcision, topical microbicides, pre-exposure chemoprophylaxis with well-tolerated ARVs such as tenofovir, and an HIV vaccine (Bertozzi et al., 2006Bertozzi S. Padian N.S. Wegbreit J. DeMaria L.M. Feldman B. Gayle H. Gold J. Grant R. Isbell T. HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment (Chapter 18).in: Jamison D.T. Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries. 2nd Edition. Oxford University Press, New York2006http://www.dcp2.org/pubs/DCPGoogle Scholar). A preventive HIV vaccine remains the greatest hope for reversing the relentless spread of HIV, and clinical trials of diverse approaches are ongoing throughout the world (Johnston and Fauci, 2007Johnston M.I. Fauci A.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 2007; 356: 2073-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Even an “imperfect” HIV vaccine would have enormous benefits. In this regard, progress has been made in developing so-called T cell-based HIV vaccines, which evoke cell-mediated immunity that may not protect against infection but could nonetheless help lower the initial burst of viremia following infection as well as the viral set point and slow disease progression and reduce transmissibility. Meanwhile, structural studies of the HIV envelope may lead to the development of immunogens that elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies that could form the basis of a “sterilizing” vaccine that blocks infection altogether (Johnston and Fauci, 2007Johnston M.I. Fauci A.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 2007; 356: 2073-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). While extraordinary scientific, medical, and public health accomplishments have been made in the battle against HIV/AIDS, much remains to be done, especially with regard to delivering the fruits of the research endeavor to resource-poor countries where the pandemic continues to destroy lives, communities, and societies in staggering numbers (Global HIV Prevention Working Group, 2007Global HIV Prevention Working Group. (2007). Bringing HIV prevention to scale: an urgent global priority. http://www.kff.org/hivaids/hiv062807pkg.cfmGoogle Scholar). Evidence-based HIV interventions are needed at high levels of coverage, uptake, intensity, and duration if they are to have a significant public health impact. Priorities include the effective scale-up of HIV/AIDS therapy, care, and prevention, training of health care workers and ancillary personnel, support of orphans and vulnerable children, and the strengthening of health care systems and infrastructure in HIV-burdened regions (UNAIDS, 2006UNAIDS. (2006). 2006 report on the global AIDS epidemic—a UNAIDS 10th anniversary special edition. http://www.unaids.org/en/HIV_data/2006GlobalReport/default.asp.Google Scholar). Each of these will require an increased and sustained infusion of resources from rich countries and other donors. It is encouraging that annual spending on HIV/AIDS in poor- and middle-income countries increased six-fold between 2001 and 2007 to approximately $10 billion, but this sum represents less than half the amount that UNAIDS estimates will be needed in 2008 for the expanded response needed to slow the pandemic. Despite the progress with ARV access noted above, huge gaps remain in the provision of these life-saving drugs. Only 28% of people (and just 15% of children) in need of ARVs in low- and middle-income countries are receiving them, and problems of access persist in developed countries as well (see Figure 1). A shortage of trained health care workers remains an important rate-limiting factor in the scale-up of HIV treatment and prevention services, especially in Africa. The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that Africa bears ∼24% of the global burden of all diseases but has only 3% of the world's healthcare workforce. Of 57 countries that do not meet basic standards of healthcare coverage by doctors, nurses, and midwives, 36 are in Sub-Saharan Africa (Kumar, 2007Kumar P. N. Engl. J. Med. 2007; 356: 2564-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Significant resources are needed to train doctors and nurses in resource-poor areas, as well as community healthcare workers to provide care for HIV/AIDS and other diseases in their home villages and neighborhoods. The model of community-based care provided by closely supervised “accompagnateurs,” trained community health workers who use simplified algorithms for diagnosis and treatment, has been validated in both rich and poor countries and must be better utilized (Kim and Farmer, 2006Kim J.Y. Farmer P. N. Engl. J. Med. 2006; 355: 645-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, Mukherjee et al., 2003Mukherjee J.S. Farmer P.E. Niyizonkiza D. McCorkle L. Vanderwarker C. Teixeira P. Kim J.Y. BMJ. 2003; 327: 1104-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Operational and clinical research is essential to guide the formulation of such algorithms and to assess their utility on a larger scale. Infrastructure and personnel for the medical monitoring of ARV therapy are lacking in most poor communities (Koenig et al., 2006Koenig S.P. Kuritzkes D.R. Hirsch M.S. Léandre F. Mukherjee J.S. Farmer P.E. del Rio C. BMJ. 2006; 332: 602-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Clearly, limited resources should first be used to scale-up ARV treatment and provide basic support to patients to achieve good treatment adherence and minimize resistance. As rapidly as possible, however, laboratory capacity must be improved to allow the monitoring of virological and immunological outcomes of ARV therapy, as well as toxicities, such that treatment regimens can be optimized (Koenig et al., 2006Koenig S.P. Kuritzkes D.R. Hirsch M.S. Léandre F. Mukherjee J.S. Farmer P.E. del Rio C. BMJ. 2006; 332: 602-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Increased funding also is needed to provide services that allow poor people to overcome the social and economic impediments to successful adherence to HIV/AIDS treatment and care. So-called “wrap-around services” frequently include food supplements, transportation to clinics, child care, and housing, as well as care for concomitant diseases (Kim and Farmer, 2006Kim J.Y. Farmer P. N. Engl. J. Med. 2006; 355: 645-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, Mukherjee et al., 2003Mukherjee J.S. Farmer P.E. Niyizonkiza D. McCorkle L. Vanderwarker C. Teixeira P. Kim J.Y. BMJ. 2003; 327: 1104-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Striving for universal access to ARVs is a public health and ethical imperative; however, it may be logistically impossible to reach this goal, as six people were newly infected with HIV in 2006 for every person put on treatment (WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF, 2007World Health Organization, UNAIDS, UNICEF (WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF). (2007). Towards universal access: scaling up priority HIV/AIDS interventions in the health sector: progress reports, April 2007. http://www.who.int/hiv/mediacentre/en.Google Scholar). Therefore, HIV prevention activities, hopefully with, but possibly without, a safe and effective HIV/AIDS vaccine will determine the trajectory and burden of the HIV/AIDS pandemic in the years and decades ahead. Today, fewer than one person in five at risk of becoming infected with HIV has access to HIV prevention services, which even when available are confounded by complex cultural and societal issues (Global HIV Prevention Working Group, 2007Global HIV Prevention Working Group. (2007). Bringing HIV prevention to scale: an urgent global priority. http://www.kff.org/hivaids/hiv062807pkg.cfmGoogle Scholar). For example, a condom is used in only 9% of sex acts involving nonregular partners. Just 10%–12% of adults in the most heavily affected countries in sub-Saharan Africa have been tested and know their HIV serostatus. In developed countries, near-universal provision of ARVs to prevent mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) has reduced perinatal infection rates to <1%–2% in many cohorts; however, in developing countries, just 11% of HIV-infected pregnant women receive ARV prophylaxis for PMTCT. Prevention services reach a very low proportion of individuals in poor countries at highest risk of HIV infection: just 9% of men who have sex with men, 8% of injection drug users, and <20% of commercial sex workers (Global HIV Prevention Working Group, 2007Global HIV Prevention Working Group. (2007). Bringing HIV prevention to scale: an urgent global priority. http://www.kff.org/hivaids/hiv062807pkg.cfmGoogle Scholar). The delivery of proven prevention services is imperative: half of the 60 million HIV infections projected to occur globally between 2005 and 2015 could be averted with comprehensive scale-up of proven prevention strategies, according to a recent estimate (Global HIV Prevention Working Group, 2007Global HIV Prevention Working Group. (2007). Bringing HIV prevention to scale: an urgent global priority. http://www.kff.org/hivaids/hiv062807pkg.cfmGoogle Scholar). In scaling up prevention services, important lessons can be drawn from common elements of the HIV/AIDS prevention efforts in those countries that have had success in reducing HIV infections. Such factors include the strong support of political leaders and the use of the media to raise HIV awareness; efforts to encourage respect, tolerance, and compassion for HIV-infected people; adequate and sustained funding; the use of evidence-based strategies based on a detailed understanding of the specific dynamics and epidemiology of the epidemic in a particular setting; and the involvement in the prevention effort of diverse sectors, including community groups and religious leaders (Global HIV Prevention Working Group, 2007Global HIV Prevention Working Group. (2007). Bringing HIV prevention to scale: an urgent global priority. http://www.kff.org/hivaids/hiv062807pkg.cfmGoogle Scholar). Concomitantly, further research is needed on how best to deliver adult male circumcision (a prevention tool with significant efficacy in clinical trials) and integrate it into existing health services. Research also is needed to prove the efficacy and feasibility of other promising HIV prevention approaches such as topical microbicides, pre-exposure chemoprophylaxis, and an HIV vaccine (Johnston and Fauci, 2007Johnston M.I. Fauci A.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 2007; 356: 2073-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Each of these interventions could have a significant impact on the course of the HIV pandemic, as part of a multifactorial prevention effort. A truly comprehensive approach to HIV disease will require a commitment to overcoming the stigma and discrimination frequently associated with HIV infection (UNAIDS, 2006UNAIDS. (2006). 2006 report on the global AIDS epidemic—a UNAIDS 10th anniversary special edition. http://www.unaids.org/en/HIV_data/2006GlobalReport/default.asp.Google Scholar). The medical consequences of stigma and discrimination are serious because HIV-infected people may avoid lifesaving treatment and suffer needlessly. In addition, the psychological toll of isolation and ostracism can be profound, to say nothing of the physical violence to which HIV-infected people are sometimes exposed. Because of stigma, at-risk people may avoid HIV testing altogether, missing opportunities for needed treatment and opportunities to access prevention programs that could help them avoid infecting others. As we enter the second quarter century of AIDS, we are at a pivotal juncture: there have been substantial scientific advances, yet many infected people are dying needlessly and HIV infection is still spreading. Collectively, we must do more to slow the spread of HIV/AIDS by scaling up the availability of proven treatments and prevention tools. We must eliminate stigma toward and discrimination against people with HIV and refine and validate the efficacy of existing treatment and prevention programs. We must further elucidate the pathogenesis of this complex disease and develop improved treatments and tools for prevention. Perhaps most important, public health workers, policymakers, and activists must bring the benefits of advances in treatment and prevention research to the people who need them most.

Spectrin is an actin cross-linking protein that lines the intracellular side of the plasma membrane of most cell types where it is a major component of a submembraneous scaffold. This membrane skeleton plays important roles in maintaining membrane integrity and organization, particularly in red cells. Red cell spectrin is composed of a 281-kDa α subunit and a 246-kDa β subunit that associate side-to-side in an anti-parallel orientation, and two heterodimers associate head-to-head to form a tetramer, which cross-links actin oligomers. The spectrin-actin membrane skeleton is linked to the membrane through several indirect linkages to transmembrane proteins as well as direct interactions with lipid head groups (1Nash G.B. Gratzer W.B. Biorheology. 1993; 30: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 2Mohandas N. Chasis J.A. Semin. Hematol. 1993; 30: 171-192PubMed Google Scholar, 3Bennett V. Baines A.J. Phys.

Biol. 2006; 13: 29-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Most hereditary hemolytic anemias, which are quite common in the human population, destabilize the red cell membrane by disrupting either the spectrin-actin scaffold or its linkages to the plasma membrane. For example, most hereditary elliptocytosis and hereditary pyropoikilocytosis patients have mutations in one of the spectrin genes, and many of these mutations disrupt spectrin self-assembly into actin cross-linking tetramers (7Tse W.T. Lux S.E. Br. J. Haematol. 2000; 104: 2-13Crossref Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 8Delaunay J. Blood Rev. 2007; 21: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 9Gallagher P.G. Semin. Hematol. 2004; 41: 142-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Spectrin mutations are usually heterozygous, and clinical severity of these mutations is frequently modulated by a common polymorphism, αLELY, which affects the proportion of α chains from each allele that are incorporated into the red cell membrane by affecting heterodimer assembly (10Wilmotte R. Marechal J. Morle L. Baklouti F. Philippe N. Kastally R. Kotula L. Delaunay J. Alloisio N. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2091-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Hence, both heterodimer and tetramer assembly are critical steps in producing a functional membrane skeleton and disruption of one or both of these processes is frequently the cause of hereditary anemias. The mechanism of spectrin heterodimer assembly is of particular interest because both subunits are primarily comprised of many tandem homologous “spectrin type” motifs or “repeats” ∼106 residues in length. There are 20 repeats in the α subunit and 17 repeats in the β subunit (see Fig. 1). All of these repeats are expected to have similar three-helix bundle conformations (11Speicher D.W. Marchesi V.T. Nature. 1984; 311: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), and all repeats laterally associate with a homologous repeat in the complementary subunit. Despite the presence of many possible similar structures that could laterally dock with each other (Fig. 1) correct alignment and pairing of complementary repeats readily occurs. However, the structural features driving this assembly are only partially elucidated. In earlier studies, we showed spectrin heterodimer assembly required a small region near the actin binding end of the molecule (β1–2 and α20–21) that initiated rapid, high affinity assembly (12Speicher D.W. Weglarz L. DeSilva T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14775-14782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Ursitti J.A. Kotula L. DeSilva T.M. Curtis P.J. Speicher D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6636-6644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Any spectrin fragments containing these sites could rapidly associate in the correct orientation with the complementary subunit, whereas fragments lacking these regions could not assemble. After dimer initiation, adjacent repeats rapidly laterally paired with an inter-chain partner, although these associations were very weak and were not detected in solution unless the dimer nucleation site was covalently linked to the weaker repeats (12Speicher D.W. Weglarz L. DeSilva T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14775-14782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This series of studies resulted in a “zipper” model of spectrin heterodimer assembly, which consisted of three discrete steps: 1) rapid, high affinity binding of the dimer initiation site; 2) rapid, low affinity lateral association of complementary repeats along the length of the monomer; and 3) latching the zipper by forming a closed dimer through a slow, moderate affinity, temperature-dependent association (14Speicher D.W. DeSilva T.M. Speicher K.D. Ursitti J.A. Hembach P. Weglarz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4227-4235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We subsequently showed dimer initiation was weakened in high ionic strength buffers. In the same study homology modeling of the α20 and β2 repeats suggested their AB faces had complementary electrostatic surfaces that could drive initial docking of correct repeats through electrostatic interactions (15Begg G.E. Harper S.L. Morris M.B. Speicher D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3279-3287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, our repeated attempts to obtain a crystallographic structure of this complex have so far been unsuccessful, which is not surprising because crystallization of even single chain spectrin repeats has proven to be very challenging, presumably due to high molecular flexibility. An alternative approach to structure determination is to use chemical cross-linking combined with identification of specific cross-linked sites using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) 2The abbreviations used are: MS/MStandem mass spectrometryEDC1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochlorideFT-ICR MSFourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometryHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographysulfo-NHSN-hydroxysulfosuccinimideGPMAWGeneral Protein Mass Analysis for WindowsASAPAutomatic Spectrum Assignment ProgramMALDI MSmatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometryDOPEDiscrete Optimized Protein Energy. 2The abbreviations used are: MS/MStandem mass spectrometryEDC1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochlorideFT-ICR MSFourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometryHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographysulfo-NHSN-hydroxysulfosuccinimideGPMAWGeneral Protein Mass Analysis for WindowsASAPAutomatic Spectrum Assignment ProgramMALDI MSmatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometryDOPEDiscrete Optimized Protein Energy.

Although chemical cross-linking is a very old technique, it has historically been very challenging to identify cross-linked peptides, because they are usually substoichiometric and difficult to separate, detect, and identify (17Sinz A.

This situation has improved substantially over the past several years as high sensitivity, high speed mass spectrometers capable of very precise mass determinations have become available. Although only a few cross-links are likely to occur under mild cross-linking conditions, these distance constraints can be of great value in distinguishing between alternative docking orientations as well as to test and refine structures based on homology modeling (16Young M.M.

In this study, the docking interfaces of the red cell spectrin heterodimer initiation site region were experimentally determined using a “zero length” cross-linker coupled with analysis of cross-linked tryptic peptides using liquid chromatography-MS/MS analysis on an LTQ FT-ICR mass spectrometer. Distance constraints from both intrachain and interchain cross-links were also used to further refine an initial homology-based structure. The final model correlates well with available biochemical and thermodynamic data, and it supports the hypothesis that initial alignment and pairing of correct α and β repeats from among many very similar repeats in both subunits is driven primarily by long range electrostatic interactions. The following recombinant peptides were used in this study: α20–21 (repeats 20 and 21 of the human red cell spectrin α subunit, residues 2033–2259) and β1–2 (repeats 1 and 2 of the β spectrin subunit; residues 293–528). The repeats described are structural domains that use the phasing of Yan et al. (18Yan Y. Winograd E. Viel A. Cronin T. Harrison S.C. Branton D. Science. 1993; 262: 2027-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The design and construction of the α20–21 and β1–2 pGEX-2T expression plasmids have been previously described (13Ursitti J.A. Kotula L. DeSilva T.M. Curtis P.J. Speicher D.W. J. Biol.

The glutathione S-transferase-spectrin fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described (13Ursitti J.A. Kotula L. DeSilva T.M. Curtis P.J. Speicher D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6636-6644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 15Begg G.E. Harper S.L. Morris M.B. Speicher D.W. J. Biol.

After initial purification on a glutathione-Sepharose column, peptides were cleaved from the glutathione S-transferase moiety using bovine thrombin (Sigma) at 37 °C for 3 h. NaCl was added to decrease the formation of secondary cleavage products at a final concentration of 0.5 m for β1–2. The cleaved spectrin recombinants were purified by rechromatography on a glutathione-Sepharose column. The α20–21 was then separated from residual glutathione S-transferase by anion-exchange chromatography on a 1-ml HiTrap-Q column (GE Healthcare). The α20–21 was bound to the column in Buffer A (65 mm NaCl, 5 mm sodium phosphate, 2.5 mm EDTA, 75 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.3), washed with Buffer A, and eluted with Buffer B (1 m NaCl, 5 mm sodium phosphate, 2.5 mm EDTA, 75 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.3). The final purification step for both spectrin recombinants was HPLC gel filtration on two preparative TSK-gel columns (G3000SW plus G2000SW) in series in phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm sodium phosphate, 130 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.15 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.4). Freshly prepared α20–21 and β1–2 were mixed at a 1:1 ratio, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min. The mixture was loaded onto a HPLC gel filtration column to separate the α20–21/β1–2 complex from monomers and aggregates. For cross-linking reactions with EDC/sulfo-NHS, 10 μl of a freshly prepared aqueous cross-linker solution, containing 0.02, 0.1, 0.2, or 1 m EDC in addition to 0.5 m sulfo-NHS, was added to 990 μl of α20–21/β1–2 complex (2 μm). Thus, molar excesses of 100, 500, 1000, and 5000 of EDC over the complex concentration were evaluated. For a control, 10 μl of water was added, instead of the cross-linker, to the complex solution. The reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature, and 200-μl aliquots were taken after 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min. The reactions were quenched by adding 20 μl of 110 mm aqueous hydroxylamine solution to each aliquot (final concentration, 10 mm). Before SDS-PAGE, the solutions were dialyzed against 25 mm NH4HCO3 overnight and lyophilized. Following separation of the reaction mixtures by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE, the bands of interest were excised and digested in gel as described previously using modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) (19Speicher K.D. Kolbas O. Harper S.L. Speicher D.W. J. Biomol. Tech. 2000; 11: 74-86PubMed Google Scholar). Liquid chromatography-MS/MS experiments were performed on a hybrid ion trap FT-ICR mass spectrometer (LTQ-FT, Thermo Electron, San Jose, CA), equipped with a NanoLC pump and autosampler (Eksigent Technologies, Livermore, CA). Specifically, tryptic peptides were separated by reversedphase HPLC on a 75-μm inner diameter × 15-cm PicoFrit (New Objective, Woburn, MA) nanocapillary column packed with 5 μm of MAGIC C18 AQ resin (Michrom BioResources, Auburn, CA). Solvent A was 0.58% acetic acid in Milli-Q water, and solvent B was 0.58% acetic acid in acetonitrile. Peptides were eluted at 200 nl/min using an acetonitrile gradient consisting of 1–50% B over 15 min, 50–80% B over 5 min, 80% B for 10 min before returning to 1% B in 1 min. The LTQ-FT mass spectrometer was set to perform a full MS scan (m/z 375–2000) in the FT-ICR with resolution at 400 m/z set to 100,000. Simultaneously, the six most intense ions exceeding a minimum threshold of 1000 were selected for MS/MS in the linear trap. The normalized collision energy was set to 30%, and ions subjected to MS/MS were excluded from repeated analysis for 30s. Singly charged ions were not subjected to MS/MS. Cross-linked peptides were identified using a combination of GPMAW (General Protein Mass Analysis for Windows) software, version 7.10 (Lighthouse Data, Odense, Denmark), SEQUEST Browser software (ThermoFisher Scientific), and the ASAP (Automatic Spectrum Assignment Program) software packages (16Young M.M.

MS/MS spectra of cross-linked peptide candidates were further analyzed by MS2Assign (16Young M.M. Tang N. Hempel J.C. Oshiro C.M. Taylor E.W. Kuntz I.D. Gibson B.W. Dollinger G. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Homology Modeling—The final sequence alignment was submitted to MODELLER 8v2 for generating a homology model of α20–21 and β1–2. Molecular graphics were illustrated using PyMOL (23DeLano W.L. The PyMOL User's Manual. DeLano Scientific, Palo Alto, CA2002Google Scholar). The dimer interaction was analyzed using the Protein-Protein Interaction Server (24Jones S. Thornton J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2264) Google Scholar). Determination of Distances between Atoms in Homology Models of the α20–21 and β1–2 Complex—Swiss-PdbViewer (25Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9507) Google Scholar) was applied to calculate distances between C-atoms of the carboxylic acid of glutamate, aspartate, or the protein C terminus and the N-atoms of amines of lysine or the protein N terminus. Chemical Cross-linking Reaction—Monomers of the recombinant proteins were verified by MALDI MS, and potential irreversible aggregation of purified samples was measured shortly before the cross-linking reaction using analytical HPLC gel filtration (data not shown). These results together with prior characterization of these recombinants using CD, sedimentation equilibrium, and differential scanning calorimetry provided assurance these recombinant proteins were properly folded prior to cross-linking experiments. The α20–21/β 1–2 heterodimer was purified using HPLC gel filtration (Fig. 2A), and cross-linked using “zero length” cross-linking with EDC/sulfo-NHS, which cross-links acid groups (Asp, Glu, and the C terminus) to amines (ϵ-amino group of Lys and the N terminus) by creating an amide bond with elimination of an H2O molecule. Both intra- and inter-chain cross-links are expected, because these two proteins contain high concentrations of dispersed glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and lysine residues. After the cross-linking reaction, the reaction mixtures were separated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE, and the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. A range of cross-linking reaction conditions were evaluated as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the optimal reaction condition was determined to be a 60-min reaction using a 1:5000 molar excess of EDC, because this produced a substantial amount of a cross-linked dimer complex without significant evidence of aggregation (Fig. 2B). The cross-linked α20–21/β1–2 complex is expected to migrate on SDS gels at ∼55,000 Da depending on the extent of chemical cross-linking. Aggregation of proteins caused by excessive cross-linking was not observed for the cross-linked product under the 1:5000 molar ratio condition as evidenced by the absence of gel bands above the cross-linked dimer or at the top of the gel. Following SDS-PAGE separation of the cross-linked reaction mixtures, the cross-linked complex was excised from the gel, subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin, and analyzed on a hybrid ion trap-FT-ICR mass spectrometer. Characterization of Inter- and Intramolecular Cross-linked Peptides Using Ion Trap FT-ICR MS—Non-cross-linked tryptic peptides from α20–21 and β1–2 were identified using the SEQUEST browser, and all MS/MS spectra corresponding to high confidence assignments from this analysis were removed from the dataset. The experimentally obtained monoisotopic masses for all remaining MS/MS spectra were compared with calculated masses of predicted tryptic peptides and theoretical cross-linked peptides using GPMAW 7.10 and ASAP (16Young M.M. Tang N. Hempel J.C. Oshiro C.M. Taylor E.W. Kuntz I.D. Gibson B.W. Dollinger G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5802-5806Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). An initial mass error cut-off of 5 ppm was employed for this comparison. MS/MS spectrum assignments of putative cross-linked peptides were performed with the aid of MS2Assign and the ProteinXXX program as well as manual de novo sequencing. Analysis of all spectra representing potential cross-linked peptides yielded high quality, high confidence matches for nine different masses arising from six specific intermolecular cross-links as summarized in Table 1. Fig. 3 shows the correlation of two representative MS/MS spectra with the assigned sequences, and assignments of observed ions are summarized in Tables 2 and 3. The nomenclature of cross-linked peptide fragment ions follows that proposed by Schilling et al. (26Schilling B. Row R.H. Gibson B.W. Guo X. Young M.M. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2003; 14: 834-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The larger peptide is indicated by a subscript “A” and the smaller peptide by a subscript “B.” In the instrument used here, MS/MS spectra primarily result from random fragmentations at peptide bonds, and by convention, ions from the N-terminal region of a peptide are b-ions while the complementary C-terminal fragments are y-ions. In most cases, b- and y-ions can arise from either peptide, and some ions will include an intact cross-linked peptide. For example, ion 28 in Fig. 3A and Table 2 is designated as (Aintb3B)+2, which indicates it is a doubly charged b3 ion from peptide B that has an intact peptide A cross-linked to it via the lysine side chain at its N-terminal (see sequence diagram inset in Fig. 3A).TABLE 1Intermolecular and intramolecular cross-linked peptides of the α20–21/β1–2 complex using EDC/Sulfo-NHSExp. massErrorChargePeptide locationsCross-linked residuesDistanceaDistance between cross-linked atoms calculated using the Docking C model.

The crystal structure of human skeletal muscle α-actinin 2 (PDB ID: 1HCI) with 28% sequence identity to α20–21 and 42% sequence identity to β1–2, was the best template for building homology models. Sequence alignments were produced with ClustalW-1.83, and MODELLER alignment.align2d, which is preferred for aligning a sequence with structure(s) in comparative modeling, was used to determine sequence-structure alignment (Fig. 4A). An additional consideration when modeling a non-covalent complex is how the two structures dock with each other. For our initial homology model of the α20–21/β1–2 complex we aligned α20–21 to the α-actinin repeats 3 and 4 (R3–4) and β1–2 with α-actinin repeats 1 and 2 (R1–2) using the α-actinin docking interface from its dimer crystal structure. This alignment and docking mapped each spectrin heterodimer repeat to its most homologous repeat in the α-actinin anti-parallel homodimer (Docking A in Fig. 4B). Based upon homology alone, this docking interaction seemed to be the most reasonable. However, this docking interface, which contains CA/AB and BC/BC interaction surfaces (Fig. 4B, Docking A), did not agree with our previous protease protection analyses of the heterodimer initiati"

We present enzymological and x-ray structural data for hamster chymase-2 (HAM2) that provides a detailed explanation for the unusual hydrolytic specificity of this rodent α-chymase. In enzymatic characterization, hamster chymase-1 (HAM1) showed typical chymase proteolytic activity. In contrast, HAM2 exhibited atypical substrate specificity, cleaving on the carboxyl side of the P1 substrate residues Ala and Val, characteristic of elastolytic rather than chymotryptic specificity. The 2.5-Å resolution crystal structure of HAM2 complexed to the peptidyl inhibitor MeOSuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Ala-chloromethylketone revealed a narrow and shallow S1 substrate binding pocket that accommodated only a small hydrophobic residue (e.g. Ala or Val). The different substrate specificities of HAM2 and HAM1 are explained by changes in four S1 substrate site residues (positions 189, 190, 216, and 226).

Chymases (EC 3.4.21.39), serine proteases with a chymotrypsin-fold, are stored within the secretory granules of mast cells along with histamine, tryptases, and other inflammation mediators. When released during mast cell degranulation in various tissues, chymases participate in a variety of biological functions including regulation of vasoactive peptide processing, modulation of inflammatory response, stimulation of submucosal gland secretion, and degradation of extracellular matrix (1Caughey G.H. Immunol. Rev. 2007; 217: 141-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar).

The genomes of primates, dogs, ruminants, and rodents apparently contain only one functional α-chymase, whereas rodents typically have several β-chymases. Until recently, all chymases were thought to possess chymotryptic-type substrate specificity, preferring Tyr and Phe (as well as Trp and Leu, to a lesser extent) at the P1 substrate position (Schechter and Berger nomenclature (12Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4783) Google Scholar)).

Using chromogenic substrates and three polypeptides (insulin B-chain, glucagon, and melittin), these enzymes exhibited widely dissimilar substrate specificities, HAM1 showing typical chymotryptic activity, whereas HAM2 is a distinctively elastolytic enzyme. The x-ray crystal structure of HAM2 in complex with MeOSuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Ala-CMK provides a clear structural explanation for the elastolytic substrate specificity of this enzyme. These results led to further analysis of the phylogenetic relationship between rodent α-chymases and other serine proteases within a chymotrypsin-fold. Materials—All chromogenic substrates and the inhibitor MeOSuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Ala-CMK were obtained from Bachem (King of Prussia, PA). Oxidized insulin B-chain, melittin, and glucagon were from Sigma. The synthetic genes encoding HAM1 (Ile21–Ser247) and HAM2 (Ile22–Asn247) were purchased from DNA 2.0 (Menlo Park, CA). The clone for expression of human chymase in insect cells (28Wang Z. Walter M. Selwood T. Rubin H. Schechter N.M. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Prof. Norman M. Schechter (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). Generation of Recombinant Baculovirus, Protein Expression, and Purification—The genes encoding active enzyme forms of HAM1 and HAM2 were subcloned into a pAcGP67B vector that encodes a secretion signal, ubiquitin and an enterokinase (EK) cleavage sequence immediately before cloning site (28Wang Z. Walter M. Selwood T. Rubin H. Schechter N.M. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). HAM1 and HAM2 were expressed in High Five insect cells using the Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen). Insect cells were maintained in ESF921 media (Expression Systems, Woodland, CA) and infected at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01. Five days post-infection the cells were removed by centrifugation and the supernatants stored at -20 °C. Thawed HAM1 or HAM2-containing supernatant (∼0.9 liter) was clarified by spinning (14,000 × g, 20 min), filtered and loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap Heparin HP column (GE Healthcare) that was equilibrated with 20 mm Mops-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.2 m NaCl. Chymase was eluted in a 0.2–2.0 m NaCl gradient in the equilibration buffer. Fractions containing chymase were detected by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and active chymase was produced by incubation with EK (Roche Diagnostics) for 4 h at 30 °C (EK:chymase ratio, 1:100, w/w). The second Heparin HP column was used to remove EK and released N-terminal peptides. All chromatography steps were carried out at 4 °C using Ákta Explorer (GE Healthcare). Chymase-containing fractions were pooled, dialyzed to 20 mm Mops-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.2 m NaCl, and concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon, Ultra-15, 10,000 MWCO, Millipore, Carrigtwohill, County Cork, Ireland) to 1.3 mg/ml (∼50 μm). Proteins were aliquoted, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. The yield was ∼6 mg of purified HAM1 or HAM2 per liter of culture media. Human chymase was produced in-house in a similar fashion as HAM1 and HAM2. Activity Assays—Stock solutions of the chromogenic peptide substrates were prepared in Me2SO at 200–500 mm. For Km determinations, substrates were diluted either in 0.45 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1.8 m NaCl, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000 (TNP buffer) or 0.05 m Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.05% octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (OGP buffer) for substrate concentration ranges of 0.031–4 mm (Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA for HAM1 and human chymase), 0.6–40 mm (Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Ala-pNA and Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-pNA for HAM2), and 0.16–10 mm (Suc-Ala-Ala-Val-Ala-pNA for HAM2). Reactions in a 100-μl volume were performed in triplicate in half-area 96-well Costar-3695 assay plates (Corning, NY) at 37 °C. All other substrates were tested for hydrolysis by HAM2 at 1 mm substrate and 40 nm or greater enzyme concentration. Reaction kinetics were monitored spectrophotometrically at 405 nm, and initial velocities were employed in the determination of kinetic parameters. An extinction coefficient of 9900 m-1 cm-1 was used for pNA cleaved from substrate at a path length of 0.55 cm. Digestion of Polypeptide Substrates—Oxidized insulin B-chain, melittin, and glucagon stocks (100 μm each) were prepared in 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5. The substrates (50 μm during digestion) were incubated with the 0.7 μm HAM1 or HAM2 in 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, at 30 °C. Samples were removed after 0, 1, and 16 h and frozen immediately at -80 °C. The sizes of the released peptides were determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry using an LC-MSD-TOF instrument (Agilent 1100 Series LC/6210 series MSD-TOF) (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The exact cleavage sites were defined by using a computer program FindPept (www.expasy.org/tools/findpept.html). Protein Analysis—Protein concentration was measured with Bio-Rad Protein Assay Reagent (Bio-Rad) relative to a standard curve prepared with bovine serum albumin. SDS-PAGE was carried out on precast NuPAGE 4–12% Tris glycine gels (Invitrogen) and proteins were stained with Simply Blue Coomassie stain (Invitrogen). Mass spectral analyses for purified chymases were carried out using LC-MSD-TOF instrument. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Solution—Purified HAM2 (1.3 mg/ml) was incubated with a 10-fold molar excess of MeOSuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Ala-CMK for 6 h. The sample was then dialyzed against 20 mm Mops-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.05 m NaCl, for 16 h to remove unbound inhibitor and concentrated to 7 mg/ml (Amicon, UltraFree-0.5, 10,000 MWCO, Millipore). HAM2 was screened for crystallization using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method by mixing the protein with an equal volume of the reservoir buffer. Crystals formed at 25 °C from a reservoir buffer containing 25% PEG 3350, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.2 m ammonium sulfate. The crystals were transferred to a cryoprotectant solution containing reservoir buffer and 20% glycerol. The crystals were mounted and quickly cryo-cooled by immersion in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data to a resolution of 2.5 Å were collected at the IMCA-CAT ID-17 beamline at the Argonne National Laboratory. Diffraction data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using the HKL suite (29Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The crystals belong to the P43212 space group and there are two molecules of HAM2 in the asymmetric unit (Table 1).TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statistics for HAM2Data collection Space groupP43212 Wavelength (Å)0.99 Resolution (Å)35-2.5 Unique reflections18,529 Redundancy5.0 Completeness (%) (last shell)99.9 (94.9) I/σ (last shell)13.1 (7.2) Rsym (%) (last shell)9.8 (32.1)Refinement Cell constantsa, b, c (Å)71.3, 71.3, 198.6α, β, γ (degree)90, 90, 90 Non-hydrogen atoms3762 Water molecules122 Resolution range (Å)35–2.5 Reflections in refinement18,529 R-factoraR-factor = Σhkl||Fo| – k|Fc||/Σhkl|Fo| (%) (last shell)18.6 (19.6) RfreebRfree = ΣhklTest||Fo| – k|Fc||/ΣhklTest|Fo| (last shell)25.3 (28.6)Root mean square deviations from ideal Bond lengths (Å)0.007 Bond angles (degree)1.5Ramachandran plot Most-favored region (%)85.3 Favored region (%)14.1 Generously allowed region (%)0.5 Disallowed region (%)0.0a R-factor = Σhkl||Fo| – k|Fc||/Σhkl|Fo|b Rfree = ΣhklTest||Fo| – k|Fc||/ΣhklTest|Fo| Open table in a new tab The HAM2 structure was determined by molecular replacement using a human chymase structure (PDB accession code 1t31) (26de Garavilla L.

The atomic coordinates of HAM2 (accession code 2RDL) have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics, Rutgers University (www.rcsb.org/), for immediate release. Phylogenetic Analysis—Most protease sequences were retrieved from SwissProt/TrEMBL under the following accession codes: HAM2 (O70164), mMCP5 (P21844), rMCP5 (P50339), gerbil MCP2 (P50341), HAM1 (O08732), mMCP1 (P11034), rMCP1 (P09650), gerbil MCP1 (P50340), rMCP4 (P97592), mMCP9 (O35164), human (P23946), baboon (P52195), macaque (P56435), dog (P21842), sheep MCP1 (P80931), sheep MCP2 (P79204), sheep MCP3 (O46683), human cathepsin G (P08311), human granzyme B (P10144), mouse granzyme N (Q920S1), human proteinase-3 (P24158), human neurophil elastase (P08246), mouse neutrophil elastase (Q3UP87), rat pancreatic elastase-1 (P00773), human trypsin (A1A509), and bovine chymotrypsinogen A (P00766). Initially, a partial rabbit sequence was retrieved from SwissProt/TrEMBL (Q0WXH2). Profile models consisting of human, monkey, dog, mMCP1, and rMCP1 sequences were built using HMMPfam tool in HMMER package (hmmer.janelia.org). Protein data bases from Ensembl (www.ensembl.org) were searched using the HMMSearch tool from the same package and genomic data bases from Ensembl were searched using the Gene-Wise tool (32Birney E. Clamp M. Durbin R. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 988-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar). A nearly complete rabbit sequence (gap in the predicted residues 183–188) was found. The Ensembl translation ID number for rabbit chymase is ENSOCUP00000005949. The partial rabbit sequence has Gly205, whereas the genomic sequence has Arg205. Because this residue is invariantly Gly in other chymases, Gly205 was used here in the sequence alignments. Guinea pig chymase was obtained using the same techniques as applied in rabbit. Its C-terminal sequence exists in the Ensembl data base (ENSCPOP00000011161) and its complete sequence will appear in UniProt Knowledgbase with accession number P85201. A multiple sequence alignment and a distance-based phylogenetic tree were generated using ClustalW (33Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar) and edited with Jalview alignment editor (34Clamp M. Cuff J. Searle S.M. Barton G.J. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 426-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar). Expression, Activation, and Purification of Hamster Chymases—HAM1 and HAM2 were produced using a similar protocol as described earlier for human chymase (28Wang Z. Walter M. Selwood T. Rubin H. Schechter N.M. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). During expression, the signal sequence and ubiquitin from the fusion protein were removed, resulting in an enzyme with ∼10 extra residues at the N terminus. After the first heparin-Sepharose step, both enzymes were >90% pure (Fig. 1) and were then activated by EK, cleaving the extra residues from the N terminus. During EK treatment the appearance of HAM1 activity was detected using a standard chromogenic chymase substrate, Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA. HAM1 reached maximal activity after ∼4 h incubation with EK at 30 °C (Fig. 1A). When HAM2 was treated with EK, however, up to 150 min, no activity was measured with Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA (Fig. 1A), although removal of ∼10 residues from HAM2 was apparent as detected by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B). For both enzymes, released N-terminal residues and EK were removed by the second heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography step. Both HAM1 and HAM2 were ≥95% pure as determined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1C). N-terminal sequencing yielded Ile-Ile-Gly-Gly-Val-Glu-Ser-Lys for HAM1 and Ile-Ile-Gly-Gly-Thr-Glu-Xxx(Cys)-Arg for HAM2, confirming that incubation with EK generated correct N termini for both enzymes. As reported previously for human chymase (28Wang Z. Walter M. Selwood T. Rubin H. Schechter N.M. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), HAM1 is susceptible to minor autocatalytic degradation during purification as was detected by the presence of three smaller molecular weight polypeptides in SDS-PAGE of the active enzyme (Fig. 1C, lane 2). HAM2 was not affected by autocatalytic digestion (Fig. 1C, lane 3). Both HAM1 and HAM2 contain one putative N-glycosylation site, although the sites are at different sequence positions. NetNGlyc N-glycosylation analysis (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc/) predicted no glycans for HAM1 at Asn100, whereas Asn120 of HAM2 is probably glycosylated. Mass spectral analysis of the enzymes supported these predictions. The analysis for HAM1 gave a single molecular mass of 24,815 Da, which is in close agreement with the predicted mass (24,820 Da) of the fully processed, non-glycosylated enzyme. The analysis for HAM2 revealed several peaks around 26,500 Da, the highest peak being 26,495 Da. The result for HAM2 suggests a heterogeneously glycosylated protein, because the predicted mass for the unglycosylated active HAM2 sequence is 25,314 Da. Determination of Substrate Specificity—The peptide cleavage specificities for HAM1 and HAM2 were tested using chromogenic substrates and three polypeptides. For HAM1 catalysis, the substrate Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA was tested in high (TNP buffer) and low (OGP buffer) salt conditions (Table 2). High salt conditions are often used to measure human chymase activity (28Wang Z. Walter M. Selwood T. Rubin H. Schechter N.M. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 35Caughey G.H. Raymond W.W. Wolters P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1480: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), whereas the low salt buffer represents physiologically more relevant conditions. HAM1 readily hydrolyzed Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA in both conditions; in high salt conditions the activity was ∼2-fold higher compared with low salt conditions. For comparison we also determined kinetic values for identically produced recombinant human chymase under the same conditions. Human chymase cleaved Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA 2–5-fold more efficiently than HAM1. Clearly, however, HAM1 easily hydrolyzes Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA, establishing that the substrate specificity of HAM1 resembles those of human chymase and rodent β-chymases.TABLE 2Kinetic parameters for HAM1 and human chymase acting on Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA in high (TNP) and low (OGP) salt conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures”EnzymeAssay bufferEnzyme concentrationKmkcatkcat/Kmnmmms–1m–1 s–1HAM1TNP3.00.5025.951,800OGP9.00.6418.829,375Human chymaseTNP0.70.3893.1245,000OGP2.00.8759.268,046 Open table in a new tab In an attempt to measure hydrolytic activity of HAM2 using Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA, activity was first tested at a HAM2 concentration of 40 nm, which was subsequently increased to 2300 nm. Regardless of the concentration, no catalytic activity was detected. HAM2 was subsequently screened against a set of chromogenic serine protease substrates with differing P1 and P2 residues to determine whether HAM2 possessed any enzymatic activity. HAM2 clearly hydrolyzed elastase substrates containing small aliphatic amino acids such as Ala or Val at the P1 position, whereas no activity was detected against substrates with larger P1 residues such as Leu, Met, or Lys (Table 3). Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Ala-pNA and Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-pNA were highly soluble and yielded readily measurable hydrolysis, and thus appeared particularly suitable for HAM2 (note that the kcat/Km value for Suc-Ala-Ala-Val-Ala-pNA may be somewhat inaccurate because this substrate was poorly soluble at concentrations >5 mm). Although substrates with P1 Ala or Val were readily hydrolyzed by HAM2, we observed that the kcat/Km values for HAM2 against these substrates were 65–250-fold lower in high salt conditions than those determined for HAM1 with Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA. Both higher Km values and lower kcat rates contributed to the observed catalytic efficiencies. In low salt conditions, similarly to HAM1 and human chymase, the kcat/Km values were ≥2-fold lower compared with values obtained in high salt buffer.TABLE 3Kinetic parameters for HAM2 acting on chromogenic substrates in high (TNP) and low (OGP) salt conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures”SubstrateAssay bufferEnzyme concentrationKmkcatkcat/Kmnmmms–1m–1 s–1Suc-AAPA-pNATNP4010.85.6519OGP4023.55.2221Suc-AAVA-pNAaPrecipitates >5 mm in TNP buffer and >10 mm in OGP bufferTNP403.62.9806OGP4010.32.8272Suc-AAPV-pNATNP407.31.5205OGP4011.50.978Suc-AAPF-pNATNP40NHbNH, not hydrolyzedSuc-AAPL-pNATNP40NHSuc-AAPM-pNATNP40NHTos-GPK-pNATNP40NHa Precipitates >5 mm in TNP buffer and >10 mm in OGP bufferb NH, not hydrolyzed Open table in a new tab To investigate the proteolytic specificities of HAM1 and HAM2 in more detail, we hydrolyzed three polypeptides, insulin B-chain, melittin, and glucagon that display very limited tertiary structure and contain a wide variety of bonds available for cleavage. HAM1 preferentially cleaved insulin B-chain and glucagon with Phe or Tyr at the P1 position, but also readily cleaved after Leu in melittin and glucagon (Fig. 2, large black arrows). However, when Tyr was in close proximity to Leu, cleavage occurred preferentially after Tyr. All major cleavages were complete or near complete in <1 h. Extended incubations up to 16 h revealed minor hydrolytic activity also after His or Trp (Fig. 2, small black arrows). No clear residue preferences for the P1′ position were detected. The data on HAM1 are consistent with results previously presented for chymase purified from hamster cheek pouch that hydrolyzed angiotensin I after Tyr4 and Phe8 (24Takai S. Shiota N. Yamamoto D. Okunishi H. Miyazaki M. Life Sci. 1996; 58: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Unlike HAM1, which preferentially cleaved after amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains, HAM2 strongly favored the small aliphatic residues Ala and Val at the P1 position of all three substrates (Fig. 2, large red arrows). In most cases, cleavage after Ala and Val was complete in <1 h. The only notable exception was in melittin, where, after cleavage between Val8 and Leu9, the released N-terminal peptide was cleaved only slowly after Ala4 and not at all after Val5. This result could be due to one or more unfavorable residues at the P2–P4 positions. After a 16-h incubation residual activity was also noticed after the P1 residues Tyr, Ile, Thr, Leu, and Met (Fig. 2, small red arrows). Overall Structure and Inhibitor"

These receptors also have a direct impact upon behavioral and physiological pathologies ranging from addiction to their early and selective loss in Alzheimer disease (1Hogg R.C. Raggenbass M. Bertrand D. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 147: 1-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Addiction to nicotine correlates with the curious trait of up-regulation in response to chronic exposure to receptor ligands (2Schwartz R.D. Kellar K.J. J.

Although multiple mechanisms contribute to up-regulation (1Hogg R.C. Raggenbass M. Bertrand D. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 147: 1-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 8Kishi M.

Since most of these organisms have never been exposed to nicotine either acutely or at any time throughout their evolutionary history, up-regulation probably reflects a normal physiological response preserved by processes of natural selection. It is also an intrinsic property of nAChRs composed of α4 + β2 subunits (termed α4β2-nAChR; see Refs. 10Lukas R.J. Changeux J.P. Le Novere N. Albuquerque E.X. Balfour D.J. Berg D.K. Bertrand D.

Possible reasons for endogenous up-regulation of nAChR may involve the recent recognition of the participation by nicotinic receptors in regulating proinflammatory processes. In this context, α7-nAChR has received the greatest attention since its antagonism of the proinflammatory cytokine, TNFα, was documented over a decade ago (13Carlson N.G. Bacchi A. Rogers S.W. Gahring L.C. J. Neurobiol. 1998; 35: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Subsequent investigations have supported the physiological relevance of this interaction in regulating numerous proinflammatory processes (14Wang H. Yu M. Ochani M. Amella C.A. Tanovic M. Susarla S. Li J.H. Yang H. Ulloa L. Al-Abed Y. Czura C.J. Tracey K.J. Nature. 2003; 421: 384-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (2350) Google Scholar). However, a more complex interaction between nAChRs and inflammation is suggested by studies using both tissue culture (13Carlson N.G. Bacchi A. Rogers S.W. Gahring L.C. J. Neurobiol. 1998; 35: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 15Carlson N.G. Wieggel W.A. Chen J. Bacchi A. Rogers S.W. Gahring L.C. J.

Neuroreport. 2005; 16: 1123-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For example, proinflammatory cytokines can impact upon nAChR expression through promoting efficient receptor assembly and altering relative subunit composition of mature nAChRs when HEK293 (293) cells are co-transfected with cDNA encoding α4 and β2 and/or β4, respectively (16Gahring L.C.

In these earlier studies, we did note a small but persistent increase of [3H]epibatidine ([3H]Eb) binding in 293 cells transiently expressing α4β2-nAChR that were also treated with TNFα (16Gahring L.C.

This has been examined further with 293 cells stably expressing nAChRs. Our findings show that the proinflammatory cytokine, TNFα, dramatically enhances α4β2-nAChR up-regulation induced by nAChR ligands, including nicotine, cytisine, and carbachol. The pathway to enhancement of up-regulation is both actinomycin D- and cycloheximidesensitive, and it is inhibited by SB 202190, a highly specific inhibitor of p38MAPK. These findings offer a novel insight into how proinflammatory cytokines can impact upon mechanisms of up-regulation and strongly suggest that reciprocal regulatory interactions between the nAChR and inflammatory systems are likely.

Additional analysis of these cells by real time PCR showed expression of RNA encoding the TNFR subtype 1 (cycle thresholds of 22) and the less abundant TNFR type 2 (cycle threshold of 35) compared with β-actin (cycle threshold of 17; not shown). Application of TNFα (human recombinant TNFα; BioSource) to these cells (25 ng/ml for 2–4 h) revealed that RNA encoding the inducible form of cyclooxygenase, COX2, was elevated 3-fold, demonstrating that TNFα stimulates cellular responses in these cells (not shown). The same assays revealed no evidence for the expression of the acetylcholine-synthesizing enzyme, choline acetyltransferase, or other human nAChR subunits (not shown). Radioligand Binding—The binding of [3H]Eb to cell membrane preparations was done essentially as described (12Xiao Y. Baydyuk M. Wang H.P. Davis H.E. Kellar K.J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2004; 14: 1845-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 16Gahring L.C. Days E.L. Kaasch T. Gonzalez de Mendoza M. Owen L. Persiyanov K. Rogers S.W. J. Neuroimmunol. 2005; 166: 88-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Cells were distributed into 100-mm culture dishes and treated (e.g. with nicotine) 48 h later. Cells were harvested 18–24 h after treatment, at which time the cultures were 50–75% confluent, into 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4, 4 °C), pelleted, resuspended, and homogenized. Cellular debris and nuclei were removed by low speed centrifugation (100 × g; 5 min), and the supernatant was collected and centrifuged (20,000 × g for 10 min) to pellet remaining membranes for ligand-binding assays. For binding assays, 5 μgof membrane was incubated with 5 nm [3H]Eb for 2–4 h at room temperature (∼25 °C). Nonspecific binding was assessed by adding 500 μm nicotine hydrogen tartrate (Sigma) for 30 min before the addition of [3H]Eb to block specific binding. Samples were tested in triplicate. Bound ligand was separated from free ligand by vacuum filtration through Whatman GF/C filters and prepared for scintillation counting. Specific binding was defined by averaging the total binding minus the nonspecific (nicotine-blocked) binding. Data were analyzed using Prism 3 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA) as described (12Xiao Y. Baydyuk M. Wang H.P. Davis H.E. Kellar K.J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2004; 14: 1845-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 18Xiao Y. Meyer E.L. Thompson J.M. Surin A. Wroblewski J. Kellar K.J. Mol.

Calcium Imaging—Fura-2/AM calcium imaging was done essentially as before (20Rogers S.W. Gregori N.Z. Carlson N. Gahring L.C. Noble M. Glia. 2001; 33: 306-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Cells were grown on glass coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine and laminin and washed four times with Hanks' solution (with 1.3 mm CaCl2 (Invitrogen)) over 20 min, and fresh buffer was added containing 5 μg/ml freshly prepared Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes) in Me2SO (Sigma). After a 30-min incubation, the cells on coverslips were again washed, and fresh Hanks' buffer was added before testing in a Zeiss Axiovert microscope equipped with the Attofluor calcium ratio system. Upon calibrating resting calcium-bound Fura-2 (340 nm) versus nonbound Fura-2 (380 nm) ratios, 1 μm nicotine was rapidly applied directly onto the cells using a fixed pipette or a picospritzer. The cell response (change in the 340/380 nm ratio) was then recorded. Nicotine was then added a second time, and the measurement was repeated before adding 1 mm acetylcholine to activate muscarinic receptors as a positive control for cell responsiveness (∼98% in each test group). Recordings were prepared from multiple coverslips in independent platings, which were scored for responsiveness. A responsive cell was defined as having a change in the peak intensity of the 340/380 nm ratio of 0.01 units from resting upon nicotine application and that failed or exhibited a very poor response to the second application (desensitization). Primary data were analyzed using Excel. The subunit composition of nAChRs determines their pharmacological and functional response (1Hogg R.C. Raggenbass M. Bertrand D. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 147: 1-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Therefore, we first examined how nicotine, TNFα, and the combination of these agents impacts upon α4β2-nAChR, α4β4-nAChR, α3β2-nAChR, or α3β4-nAChR, respectively, stably expressed by 293 cells. For these experiments, cells were treated for 18–24 h with nicotine (1 μm), TNFα (25 ng/ml), or both agents, and specific binding of [3H]Eb to 5 μg of membrane protein was measured (see “Experimental Procedures”). Nicotine-induced up-regulation of [3H]Eb binding to α3 + β2 and α4 + β2 equaled 4–6-fold over controls, ∼2-fold for α4β4-nAChR, and no significant change for α3 + β4 (Fig. 1), as previously reported (1Hogg R.C. Raggenbass M. Bertrand D. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 147: 1-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 12Xiao Y. Baydyuk M. Wang H.P. Davis H.E. Kellar K.J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2004; 14: 1845-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although not as robust as nicotine, TNFα induced a small but significant increase in [3H]Eb binding by cells expressing α4β2-nAChR and α4β4-nAChR but not α3β2-nAChR or α3β4-nAChR. The most dramatic effect on ligand binding was in α4β2-nAChR-expressing cells simultaneously treated with TNFα and nicotine. In these cells, the increase in [3H]Eb sites exceeded 10-fold that of the control and often exceeded nicotine-treated cells by 2-fold. A smaller effect by TNFα on nicotine up-regulation was observed for α3β2-nAChR receptors and to a lesser but significant extent α4β4-nAChR. Again, cells expressing α3β4-nAChR exhibited only a slight trend toward enhanced ligand binding relative to controls that was not statistically significant. We focused the subsequent experiments toward examining the dramatic enhancement by TNFα on nicotine up-regulation of α4β2-nAChR. To begin, dose-response assays for up-regulation of [3H]Eb binding in response to 18–24 h of exposure to nicotine, TNFα, or nicotine plus TNFα were performed. Up-regulation was observed in cells treated with as little as 100 nm nicotine (∼2-fold) and saturated at 1 μm nicotine (Fig. 2A). TNFα (Fig. 2B) induced weak up-regulation at all doses tested (optimal dose, 12.5–25 ng/ml). The results of experiments where nicotine was held constant at 1 μm and the concentration of TNFα varied are shown in Fig. 2C. The optimal enhancement of up-regulation (12-fold relative to 4-fold for nicotine alone in this experiment) occurred at 1 μm nicotine and 25 ng/ml TNFα, which was also true in experiments where constant TNFα (25 ng/ml) and varied nicotine (10 nm to 10 μm) were done (not shown). The order of addition (TNFα versus nicotine), including in experiments where they were added 24 h in advance of the other, had no significant influence on the results (not shown). Therefore, 1 μm nicotine and 25 ng/ml TNFα were used in subsequent experiments unless otherwise noted. An important variable in tissue culture experiments is cell culture density. This is particularly true when variables such as cell cycle, nutrients, pH, and cell-cell contact (that may also affect accessibility by ligands to receptors) influence the experimental results. The influence of cell density on TNFα-enhancement of nicotine-mediated up-regulation was examined in cultures that were plated to reach confluence of 100, 75, 50, and 25%, respectively, following a total of 36 h in culture and 24 h after treatment with nicotine, TNFα, or both agents as above. The results show (Fig. 2D) that cell cultures at ∼50% confluence display the greatest enhancement by TNFα of up-regulation (1.8-fold). There was, however, a decline in the amount of TNFα enhancement of up-regulation with increasing cell density (∼1.4-fold). This result indicates that cell culture conditions influence the ability of TNFα to enhance nicotine-mediated up-regulation. This finding is consistent with cell density influencing nAChR expression by transfected cultured cells. For all experiments reported, culture density was ∼50% confluence at the time of harvest. TNFα Enhancement of Nicotine-mediated Up-regulation Requires New RNA Transcription and Protein Synthesis—The mechanism of nicotine plus TNFα-enhanced up-regulation was examined next. To begin, saturation binding of [3H]Eb over a concentration range of 1–5000 pm for each treatment group was measured (Fig. 3A). For control cells, the [3H]Eb-specific binding was 537 ± 140 fmol/mg, and the saturable best fit was to a single high affinity site (control mean Kd of 53 ± 14 pm) as calculated using Prism 3.0 software (12Xiao Y. Baydyuk M. Wang H.P. Davis H.E. Kellar K.J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2004; 14: 1845-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Nicotine competition curves averaged from three independent experiments (Fig. 3B; nicotine binding competition against 500 pm [3H]Eb) show that at 10–4m to ∼5 × 10–5m, nicotine competed for >85% of the specific [3H]Eb binding. There was no significant difference in the affinity of this compound measured in these experiments (nicotine IC50 of 12 ± 4 nm; see Ref. 12Xiao Y. Baydyuk M. Wang H.P. Davis H.E. Kellar K.J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2004; 14: 1845-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) among the different treatment groups. Collectively, these data support a model where combining nicotine and TNFα up-regulation by co-exposure is related to changes in receptor number. How TNFα enhances nicotine-mediated up-regulation of α4β2-nAChR [3H]Eb binding sites was examined further. Although previous reports show ligand-mediated up-regulation of nAChRs to be independent of transcription (1Hogg R.C. Raggenbass M. Bertrand D. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 147: 1-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), how TNFα enhancement of up-regulation occurs is unknown. The first measurement determined if intact cells were required for TNFα to enhance nicotine-mediated up-regulation. For this experiment, a crude membrane fraction of untreated cells was prepared as described for binding assays. Equal aliquots of these preparations were treated with saline, 1 μm nicotine, 25 ng TNFα, or both nicotine and TNFα and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h with gentle rocking. Membranes were then collected by centrifugation and washed, and radioligand-binding measurements were performed. The results (Fig. 3C) show that incubation of membranes with TNFα alone had no effect on [3H]Eb binding, although a small but significant increase was measured in nicotine-treated samples and those with nicotine plus TNFα. This persistent increase is consistent with reports of up-regulation through mechanisms that influence receptor affinity for ligand (9Vallejo Y.F. Buisson B. Bertrand D. Green W.N. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5563-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the changes in ligand binding were well below the 4–6-fold change expected from whole cell preparations, and no TNFα enhancement of this up-regulation effect was present, indicating that TNFα acts on up-regulation through mechanisms requiring intact cells. The time course of TNFα-enhanced up-regulation was examined to determine when TNFα-enhanced up-regulation begins. These experiments were done as above, only cells were harvested at various times after the addition of nicotine and/or TNFα. As shown in Fig. 3D, a small enhancement by TNFα of nicotine up-regulation was observed with in 2 h of treatment; however, significant enhancement of up-regulation was not observed until ∼8 h post-treatment. This result indicates that the impact of TNFα on up-regulation is not likely to be through modifications of preexisting protein pools. To test this, we next examined the influence of the transcriptional inhibitor, actinomycin D, on TNFα-enhanced up-regulation. In these experiments, [3H]Eb binding of membranes isolated from cells treated with nicotine, TNFα, nicotine plus TNFα, or saline for 18 h, either in the presence or absence of 10 μm actinomycin D (a dose tolerated by the cells; not shown), was measured. Upon normalizing the results to the control cells as in Fig. 3E, it was found that consistent with the previous reports noted above, there was no effect by transcription inhibition with actinomycin D on the up-regulation of [3H]Eb binding sites treated with nicotine relative to control values. However, TNFα enhancement of the nicotine-induced up-regulation process was abolished. In a similar experiment, inhibition of new protein synthesis with 10 μm cycloheximide was done as described above for the actinomycin D experiments. The results of these experiments, shown in Fig. 3F, demonstrate that cycloheximide abolishes essentially all up-regulation as well as TNFα enhancement of up-regulation relative to control cells. Notably, a small amount of up-regulation in cells treated with nicotine did persist, similar to that seen in membrane incubation experiments (Fig. 3C). However, we did not explicitly rule out the possibility that some residual protein synthesis could have occurred. What is important is the substantial reduction of up-regulation and enhancement by TNFα (>80% relative to controls). Together with the results of actinomycin D studies and the timing of the onset of enhanced up-regulation, these findings argue that the mechanism(s) of TNFα enhancement of [3H]Eb binding sites requires both new transcription and protein synthesis. Up-regulation Produced by Ligands Other than Nicotine Is Enhanced by TNFα—Most agonists that bind nAChRs (e.g. nicotine) and some antagonists (e.g. dihydro-β-erythroidine) produce up-regulation (21Gopalakrishnan M. Molinari E.J. Sullivan J.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 524-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In this context, to examine the specificity of TNFα enhancement of up-regulation, the change in [3H]Eb binding sites by α4β2-nAChR-expressing cells in the presence or absence of TNFα for 24 h and either 1 mm carbachol, 10 μm dihydro-β-erythroidine, 10 μm cytisine (a competitive partial agonist), or mecamylamine a noncompetitive antagonist not generally reported to produce up-regulation). All agents, except mecamylamine, consistently produce significant up-regulation of α4β2-nAChR [3H]Eb binding (Fig. 4). TNFα enhanced up-regulation induced by these agents proportionately to that seen with nicotine except for mecamylamine, where again no significant effect was observed. The greatest up-regulation was observed with carbachol, although enhancement of this effect by TNFα was proportional to that seen with other receptor ligands. Because carbachol is also an agonist of muscarinic receptors, the same experiment (Fig. 4A) was done in the presence of atropine (which by itself had no effect on [3H]Eb binding; not shown). Atropine had no measurable effect on carbachol up-regulation of [3H]Eb binding or TNFα enhancement. Also, because the concentration of carbachol used was relatively high, a dose-response assay was done (Fig. 4B). At concentrations to 60 μm, carbachol produced significant α4β2-nAChR up-regulation of [3H]Eb, and TNFα (25 ng) enhanced this up-regulation. As reported (8Kishi M. Steinbach J.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 2037-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), the up-regulation of α4β2-nAChR by the competitive antagonist dihydro-β-erythroidine was approximately one-third that of nicotine, yet TNFα also enhanced [3H]Eb binding proportionately. Collectively, these results indicate that in all cases tested where ligand binding by the nAChR initiates the up-regulation mechanism, proportional enhancement by TNFα occurs. Carbachol-mediated up-regulation is particularly useful, since this method permits conditions for Fura-2 calcium imaging measurements. This is because nicotine up-regulation results in receptors that are also deeply desensitized, and the extensive amounts of washing required to restore function are often impractical. In contrast, nAChR function is restored in carbachol-treated cells within 20–30 min of washing (not shown). Following 18–24 h of 500 μm carbachol, rapid application of 1 μm nicotine produces an easily measurable change in the Fura-2 340/380 ratio in ∼60% of the cells (193 of 315 cells for the experiment shown; Fig. 4D), which is in contrast to control cells that are rarely able to produce a convincing response (Fig. 4C). In cells treated with carbachol + TNFα, the peak response measured was on average 30% greater than the response measured (Fig. 4E) in carbachol only-treated cells, although there was only a small increase in the percentage of cells responding that was not seen in all experiments (236 of 350 cells). This result indicates that TNFα, in addition to increasing the number of [3H]Eb sites, also increases the number of functional receptors (or their duration of opening) but does not necessarily alter the number of cells able to produce a measurable functional response. Mechanism of TNFα Enhancement of α4β2-nAChR Up-regulation—TNFα signaling through its receptors impacts on numerous intracellular pathways (22MacEwan D.J. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 477-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 23Hommes D.W. Peppelenbosch M.P. van Deventer S.J. Gut. 2003; 52: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Of interest to us has been the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) pathways. We have examined the possible contribution of this intracellular pathway to enhancement of up-regulation using various inhibitors, including those affecting phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and p38MAPK. For these experiments, all treatments with saline, nicotine, TNFα, or both agents were done as described above. Me2SO, which is used as the carrier for inhibitor stock solutions, has no effect on ligand binding. Representative results for these inhibitors on the TNFα enhancement of nicotine-mediated up-regulation are shown in Fig. 5. Two inhibitors affected the TNFα enhancement of nicotine-induced up-regulation. The MEK1/2 inhibitor, U0126, inhibits ∼50% of TNFα-enhanced up-regulation, but the MEK1-preferring inhibitor (24Karihaloo A. O'Rourke D.A. Nickel C. Spokes K. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9166-9173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), PD98059, has no effect, suggesting that signaling through at least the MEK2 pathway is important. However, effectively all enhanced up-regulation was blocked by the p38MAPK inhibitor, SB 202190 (Fig. 5). None of these agents increased or inhibited nicotine-induced up-regulation (not shown). Nicotine has long been associated with its ability to up-regulate the expression of α4β2-nAChRs, and this correlates with phenotypes related to addiction (1Hogg R.C. Raggenbass M. Bertrand D. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 147: 1-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). More recently, this compound has also been found to directly impact upon inflammatory and immunologic responses (25Wang H. Liao H. Ochani M. Justiniani M. Lin X. Yang L. Al-Abed Y. Wang H. Metz C. Miller E.J. Tracey K.J. Ulloa L. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 1216-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). In a reciprocal manner, inflammatory mediators can affect the expression of nicotinic receptors (16Gahring L.C. Days E.L. Kaasch T. Gonzalez de Mendoza M. Owen L. Persiyanov K. Rogers S.W. J. Neuroimmunol. 2005; 166: 88-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this report, using stably transfected cell lines, we find that TNFα strongly enhances α4β2-nAChR up-regulation, independent of other inflammatory conditions or nAChR subtypes, through an actinomycin D and cycloheximide-sensitive p38MAPK intracellular signaling pathway. A diagram reflecting these pathways is shown in Fig. 6. The p38MAPK cascade has a central role in regulating many immunologic and inflammatory responses as well as physiological functions related to cell growth, cell differentiation, and apoptosis. Partial inhibition of TNFα-enhanced up-regulation of α4β2-nAChR by the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126, but not the MEK1-preferring PD98059 (24Karihaloo A. O'Rourke D.A. Nickel C. Spokes K. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9166-9173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), implies participation of an additional pathway that leads to p38MAPK activation. Collectively, the delay in the onset of TNFα-mediated enhancement of up-regulation, the selective diminishment of this effect by both transcription and translation inhibitors, and the general role of p38MAPK in activating stress-related genes combine to suggest that TNFα-mediated enhancement of up-regulation occurs through induction of a protein that favors nicotinic receptor expression by a post-translational mechanism(s). Particularly attractive candidates are chaperone-like proteins, since these would promote more efficient folding, assembly, and/or transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface. Also, the impact of these signals appears to be based upon subunit composition. In particular, enhancement of ligand-mediated up-regulation is most notable in receptors harboring the β2 subunit. However, we observed a small but significant and direct influence by TNFα on promoting increased ligand-binding sites for α4β2-nAChR and α4β4-nAChR but not for α3-containing receptors. This indicates that the α4 subunit is also likely to harbor structures that are targeted directly by the TNFα enhancement up-regulation signal. This study and others (13Carlson N.G. Bacchi A. Rogers S.W. Gahring L.C. J. Neurobiol. 1998; 35: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 14Wang H. Yu M. Ochani M. Amella C.A. Tanovic M. Susarla S. Li J.H. Yang H. Ulloa L. Al-Abed Y.

Neuroimmunol. 2005; 166: 88-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) also indicate that an interaction between inflammation and various nAChR subtypes occurs through multiple mechanisms. For example, α7-nAChR has been demonstrated to reduce the release of TNFα (14Wang H. Yu M. Ochani M. Amella C.A. Tanovic M. Susarla S. Li J.H. Yang H. Ulloa L. Al-Abed Y. Czura C.J. Tracey K.J. Nature. 2003; 421: 384-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (2350) Google Scholar), which would dampen inflammation (and inflammatory cytokines), and indirectly regulate the amount of α4β2-nAChR up-regulation. However, the relationship between α7-nAChR, TNFα, and enhanced up-regulation of α4β2-nAChR may not be straightforward, since TNFα can originate from multiple sources that may or may not be regulated by α7-nAChR. A final point is to speculate regarding the translational relevance of this observation in the animal. One place where this is possible is related to the observation that when individuals are ill, they often experience a diminished desire to continue nicotine administration. In fact this has been used as an indicator of nicotine dependence (26Heatherton T.F. Kozlowski L.T. Frecker R.C. Fagerstrom K.O. Br. J. Addict. 1991; 86: 1119-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (8167) Google Scholar). Because illness is often associated with elevated TNFα, in the presence of chronic nicotine administration, enhanced up-regulation might actually exceed the comfort level and possibly even become toxic. A second point involves changes in nicotinic cholinergic receptor expression and inflammatory dysfunction that is characteristic of aging animals. There is a dramatic and selective loss of α4β2-nAChR expression in the aged brain of both rodents (27Schulz D.W. Kuchel G.A. Zigmond R.E. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 2225-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 28Rogers S.W. Gahring L.C. Collins A.C. Marks M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4825-4832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Perry D.C.

Aging. 2005; 26: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and humans (especially those with Alzheimer's disease; e.g. see Refs. 31Kellar K.J. Whitehouse P.J. Martino-Barrows A.M. Marcus K. Price D.L. Brain Res. 1987; 436: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar and 32Schroder H. Giacobini E. Struble R.G. Zilles K. Maelicke A. Luiten P.G. Strosberg A.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 640: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Coincident with the onset of old age and pathology is also an unregulated increase in TNFα and other proinflammatory cytokines. At present, the correlation between the loss of α4β2-nAChR expression and onset (or progression) of pathology is unknown. However, the possibility of a mechanistic interaction contributing to this coincidental dysregulation in both systems is intriguing. These results and other possible interactions between inflammatory cytokines and nAChR expression extend our understanding of the physiologic relevance of up-regulation as a normal contributor to local and conditional regulation of nAChR function."

Sequence specific recognition of DNA by proteins is essential for life, because the biological effect of each gene is regulated by transcription factors, which bind to the promoter elements of target genes and stimulate or repress the expression of the corresponding gene (1Garvie C.W. Wolberger C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 937-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Also many nucleic acid interacting enzymes, like DNA methyltransferases (2Cheng X. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 293-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 3Cheng X. Roberts R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3784-3795Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 4Jeltsch A. ChemBioChem. 2002; 3: 274-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (5Lee S.W. Cho B.H. Park S.G. Kim S. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3725-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), DNA repair enzymes (6Singer B. Hang B. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 713-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and restriction endonucleases (7Pingoud A. Jeltsch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3705-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) interact with nucleic acids in a highly sequence-specific manner. In general, DNA recognition follows two paradigms: direct and indirect readout (1Garvie C.W. Wolberger C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 937-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). For direct readout, proteins form contacts (including hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts) in the major (and to a lesser degree also the minor) groove of the DNA to the edges of the base pairs to probe the DNA sequence (8Seeman N.C. Rosenberg J.M. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 804-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). For indirect readout, proteins form contacts to the DNA backbone. Because the structural preferences and dynamics of the DNA are sequence dependent, the interaction energy associated with a particular DNA conformation can be used to read the DNA sequence (9Travers A.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 427-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar).DNA methyltransferases are an important example of enzymes that recognize specific DNA sequences (2Cheng X. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 293-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 3Cheng X. Roberts R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3784-3795Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 4Jeltsch A. ChemBioChem. 2002; 3: 274-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA-(adenine N6)-MTases, as studied here, transfer a methyl group to the N6-position of adenine residues embedded in a specific recognition sequence. In Escherichia coli, the E. coli DNA adenine methyltransferase (EcoDam) 3The abbreviations used are:EcoDamEscherichia coli DNA adenine methyltransferaseSFMscanning force microscopyMTasemethyltransferase. 3The abbreviations used are:EcoDamEscherichia coli DNA adenine methyltransferaseSFMscanning force microscopyMTasemethyltransferase. enzyme that methylates DNA at GATC sites is involved in the coordination of DNA replication and cell cycle, post-replicative mismatch repair, and regulation of the expression of several genes (4Jeltsch A. ChemBioChem. 2002; 3: 274-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the structure of the EcoDam enzyme in complex with specific DNA was solved illustrating the mechanism of sequence-specific DNA interaction of this enzyme (10Horton J.R. Liebert K. Bekes M. Jeltsch A. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 559-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The protein comprises two domains, a catalytic domain that is conserved among DNA MTases and a DNA binding domain that folds into a 5-helix bundle. The DNA interactions are made by a β-hairpin (residues 118–139), which is part of the DNA binding domain and an N-terminal extension of the catalytic domain (Fig. 1A). Key DNA recognition contacts between EcoDam and the GATC site are a hydrogen bond between Lys9 and Gua1, contacts of Leu122 and Pro134 to base pair 3 and an interaction of Arg124 to the Gua in the 4th base pair (see Fig. 1B). Exchange of any of these residues led to major changes in the DNA recognition specificity of EcoDam (10Horton J.R. Liebert K. Bekes M. Jeltsch A. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 559-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 11Horton J.R. Liebert K. Hattman S. Jeltsch A. Cheng X. Cell. 2005; 121: 349-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The enzyme forms contacts also with the backbone of the DNA but there is no apparent deformation of the DNA (apart from flipping out the target base for methylation and its partner base), which suggests that indirect readout is secondary for DNA recognition. The EcoDam enzyme is related to the phage T4-encoded T4Dam enzyme, which also recognizes GATC sites (Fig. 1A). The T4Dam has a very similar structure and mode of DNA recognition as EcoDam (11Horton J.R. Liebert K. Hattman S. Jeltsch A. Cheng X. Cell. 2005; 121: 349-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 12Yang Z. Horton J.R. Zhou L. Zhang X.J. Dong A. Zhang X. Schlagman S.L. Kossykh V. Hattman S. Cheng X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), with the only exception that recognition of Gua1 is not based on an interaction with the N-terminal loop of the enzyme (T4Dam carries an alanine at the position corresponding to EcoDam Lys9, see Fig. 1A), but on a bidentate hydrogen bond between Arg130 located at the basis of the β-hairpin and the guanine.The M.EcoRV enzyme, which is the subject of the present work, is part of a restriction/modification system that protects the bacterial host against bacteriophage infection (4Jeltsch A. ChemBioChem. 2002; 3: 274-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although, restriction enzymes and methyltransferases can recognize the same sequence, they have evolved independently and use different mechanisms for DNA recognition. The M.EcoRV enzyme is related to the Dam family (Fig. 1A), but it recognizes GATATC sites and modifies the first adenine within the sequence (13Nwosu V.U. Connolly B.A. Halford S.E. Garnett J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 3705-3720Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The DNA binding domain of M.EcoRV is similar to that of EcoDam, which suggests a similar mechanism of DNA recognition (14Lauster R. Kriebardis A. Guschlbauer W. FEBS Lett. 1987; 220: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 15Roth M. Helm-Kruse S. Friedrich T. Jeltsch A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17333-17342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In EcoDam and T4Dam, the target base is flipped out of the DNA helix (10Horton J.R. Liebert K. Bekes M. Jeltsch A. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 559-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 11Horton J.R. Liebert K. Hattman S. Jeltsch A. Cheng X. Cell. 2005; 121: 349-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), which most likely is also happening in the M.EcoRV-DNA complex (16Jeltsch A. Roth M. Friedrich T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1121-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For methylation, the target base is inserted into a pocket formed by a DPPY tetrapeptide that is the most highly conserved part of N-MTases (2Cheng X. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 293-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The M.EcoRV DNA interaction has been shown to invoke strong bending of the DNA of approximately 61° (17Cal S. Connolly B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1008-1015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and to induce large structural changes of the DNA (18Gowher H. Jeltsch A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 93-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Furthermore, binding of sinefungin, an AdoMet analogue, increased DNA binding by M.EcoRV 20-fold (19Szczelkun M.D. Connolly B.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10724-10733Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), which indicates that there is communication between the coenzyme and DNA binding site.The M.EcoRV/EcoDam system has been studied as a paradigm of how proteins change their DNA recognition during evolution. One central prerequisite to answer this question is to determine which structural elements of M.EcoRV correspond to EcoDam, meaning how the 6-base pair recognition sequence of EcoRV should be aligned to the EcoDam sequence (Fig. 1C). Given the fact, that both enzymes methylate the second adenine in a GAT sequence, an alignment of the GAT parts of both sequences appeared likely (20Beck C. Cranz S. Solmaz M. Roth M. Jeltsch A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10956-10965Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 21Beck C. Jeltsch A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14103-14110Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Then, the difference between the M.EcoRV and EcoDam DNA recognition sequences would lie in the ATC part of the EcoRV site and M.EcoRV would require some structural elements for its recognition. The availability of the T4Dam and EcoDam-DNA complex structure shed new light on this question, because the part of the β-hairpin that is responsible for the recognition of the TC part of the target site is fully conserved between EcoRV and EcoDam as well as other members of the family (10Horton J.R. Liebert K. Bekes M. Jeltsch A. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 559-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 11Horton J.R. Liebert K. Hattman S. Jeltsch A. Cheng X. Cell. 2005; 121: 349-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This observation would suggest that the last bases of the target sites correspond to each other and the recognition of the first part has been altered between M.EcoRV and EcoDam. This model is supported by the observation that it is the recognition of Gua1 that is altered between EcoDam and T4Dam (10Horton J.R. Liebert K. Bekes M. Jeltsch A. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 559-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) suggesting that this is an evolutionary flexible contact. Here, we show that both of these models are incorrect, because recognition of the first and last base pairs of the target site are conserved between M.EcoRV and EcoDam. Hence, M.EcoRV recognizes GATATC sites as an expanded GATC site, with DNA bending introduced to accommodate the increased distance between the first and last bases of the target site. Furthermore, we show that R128A is inefficient in DNA binding and bending, whereas K11A shows relaxed sequence specificity in DNA binding and bending. These results suggest that the DNA contact of Arg128 is an early contact between the enzyme and the DNA whose formation is followed by bending of the DNA and making of the contact between Lys11 and Gua1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESOligonucleotides—Oligonucleotides were purchased from Thermo Hybaid (Ulm, Germany). We used one canonical substrate LD20 and 13 near cognate substrates in which 1 base pair of the recognition sequence had been altered. Hemimethylated substrates were used to specify which strand of the near cognate substrates became methylated. Double-stranded substrates were prepared by mixing equimolar (20 μm) amounts of each strand, heating to 95 °C for 5 min, and slowly cooling to room temperature. The following oligonucleotides were used (all written in 5′ to 3′ orientation, Bt stands for biotinylation, mA for 6-methyladenine): LD20, d(GATCGTAGATATCTCATCGA)/Bt-d(TCGATGCGmATATCTACGATC); LD20 G1T, d(GATCGTATATATCTCATCGA)/Bt-d(TCGATGCGmATATATACGATC); LD20 G1C, d(GATCGTACATATCTCATCGA)/Bt-d(TCGATGCGmATATGTACGATC); LD20 G1A, d(GATCGTAAATCTCTCATCGA)/Bt-d(TCGATGCGmATATTTACGATC); LD20 T3A, d(GATCGTAGAAATCTCATCGA)/Bt-d(TCGATGCGmATTTCTACGATC); LD20 T3C, d(GATCGTAGACATCTCATCGA)/Bt-d(TCGATGCGmATGTATACGATC); LD20 T3G, d(GATCGTATAGATCTCATCGA)/Bt-d(TCGATGCGmATCTATACGATC); LD20 A4C, d(GATCGTAGATCTCTCATCGA)/Bt-d(TCGATGCGmAGATCTACGATC); LD20 A4T, d(GATCGTAGATTTCTCATCGA)/Bt-d(TCGATGCGmAAATCTACGATC); LD20 A4G, d(GATCGTAGATGTCTCATCGA)/Bt-d(TCGATGCGmACATCTACGATC); LD20 T5C, d(GATCGTAGACACCTCATCGA)/Bt-d(TCGATGCGGTGTCTACGATC); LD20 T5A, d(GATCGTAGATCACTCATCGA)/Bt-d(TCGATGCGTGATCTACGATC); LD20 T5G, d(GATCGTAGATAGCTCATCGA)/Bt-d(TCGATGCGCTATCTACGATC); and LD20 C6T, d(GATCGTAGATATTTCATCGA)/Bt-d(TCGATGCAmATATCTACGATC).Site-directed Mutagenesis, Protein Expression, and Protein Purification—The M.EcoRV mutants were generated by the megaprimer site-directed mutagenesis method as described before (22Jeltsch A. Lanio T. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 182: 85-94PubMed Google Scholar). The pGEXMRV plasmid (23Friedrich T. Roth M. Helm-Kruse S. Jeltsch A. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), which encodes M.EcoRV N-terminal fused to glutathione S-transferase, was used as a template. The mutagenic primer contained the designated single substitution and the screening restriction site to confirm the mutation. Mutant plasmids were selected by restriction analysis of marker sites introduced together with the mutation. The absence of non-desired mutations was confirmed by complete sequencing of all variant genes. Protein expression was performed as described before (20Beck C. Cranz S. Solmaz M. Roth M. Jeltsch A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10956-10965Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), except that cells were harvested 3 h after the induction of protein expression. Purification of the glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins was done by chromatography over GSH-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) basically as described before (20Beck C. Cranz S. Solmaz M. Roth M. Jeltsch A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10956-10965Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), except that the sonication buffer contained 500 mm NaCl. Usually purified proteins were >95% pure (see supplemental Fig. S1 for some representative examples of the protein purifications used). Protein concentrations were determined by densitometric analysis of Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels.Kinetic Analysis Using in Vitro Methylation Assay—Quantitative determination of the catalytic activity of the wild type M.EcoRV and its variants was carried out in vitro with a biotin/avidin methylation assay as described (24Roth M. Jeltsch A. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). All methylation reactions were performed under single turnover conditions, because multiple turnover experiments are not suited to probe the transition state of the DNA methylation reaction by M.EcoRV, because the turnover of M.EcoRV is limited by product release (25Jeltsch A. Friedrich T. Roth M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 747-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To determine comparable catalytic activities of wild type and mutants, equal concentrations of the enzymes (1 μm) were used in the individual reactions. All the reactions were performed in 40-μl reaction mixtures containing 1 μm oligonucleotide, 1 μm enzyme, 2.6 μm [3H]AdoMed, 500 ng/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 100 mm NaCl. All kinetics were done at least in triplicate and the results averaged.Kinetic Data Analysis—Linear reaction progress curves were analyzed by linear regression to determine the initial slope (kmet). Hyperbolic reaction curves were analyzed by a single exponential fit followed by a linear phase, CPMtheo(t)=F(1-e-kstt)+kmtt+BL(Eq. 1) kst, single turnover rate constant for DNA methylation, [1/min]; kmt, multiple turnover rate constant for DNA methylation (cpm/min); F, size of the exponential phase in (cpm); BL, background.Because the single turnover rate (kst) of M.EcoRV is much faster than the multiple turnover rate (kcat) (25Jeltsch A. Friedrich T. Roth M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 747-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), under our conditions the single turnover rate dominates the results with kmt contributing less than 5% to kmet.To determine the initial rate of enzyme turnover (kmet), Equation 1 is differentiated at t → 0 to obtain Equation 2. kmet=Fkst+kmt(Eq. 2) The initial rate depends on the saturation level of substrate with enzyme, which depends on the DNA binding constant. Because wild type M.EcoRV and all mutants bind to the L20 substrate with an affinity of about Kd = 1 × 10–7 m or weaker (15Roth M. Helm-Kruse S. Friedrich T. Jeltsch A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17333-17342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the initial slopes determined here reflect kst/Kd, which is a well established measure of enzyme specificity (26Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1998Google Scholar).To compare the relative activity of wild type and variant enzyme for methylation at a modified target site (X), specificity factors were calculated, where X denotes the methylation rate of one particular substrate by one M.EcoRV variant or the wild type. S=kvariantGATATC/kvariantX-substratekwildtypeGATATC/kwildtypeX-substrate(Eq. 3) An increase in specificity is indicated by S > 1, loss of specificity by S < 1.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Experiments—To investigate the DNA binding and bending by M.EcoRV, two different 150-bp DNA fragments called E (for “end”) and M (for “middle”) were used. Both substrates had a single EcoRV target site, E at the end of the fragment and M in the middle. Both substrates were constructed by PCR amplification of pET28a(+) vector using two sets of oligonucleotides: 5′-ATCCCACTACCGAGATATCCGCACC-3′/5′-TGTCCGGTTTTCAACAAACCATGC-3′ for E and 5′-AATCCTGTTTGATGGTGGTTAACG-3′/5′-TGGTTGCCAACGATCAGATGGCG-3′ for M. Both substrates were radioactively labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs).The band shift assay was carried out as previously described (17Cal S. Connolly B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1008-1015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In 20 μl, the reaction mixtures contained 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0), 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μg of acetylated bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mm sine-fungin (Sigma), approximately 100 pm of each amplified DNA and 100 nm M.EcoRV wild type protein (200–800 nm for the M.EcoRV variants). The reactions were incubated at room temperature for 15–30 min and loaded on a 8% non-denaturating polyacrylamide gel run in 0.5 × TBE buffer, followed by 6-h electrophoresis at room temperature (300 V, 250 mA). The separated complexes were visualized by autoradiography using the phosphorimager system (Fuji).Scanning-force Microscopy Experiments—A 406-bp DNA substrate was obtained by PCR amplification of the pET28a(+) using the primers: 5′-GCGTATTGGGCGCCAGGG-3′ and 5′-GGCTGGCATAAATATCTCACTCGC-3′. It contains one EcoRV site located in the center of the sequence. DNA-protein complexes were established in a total volume of 10 μl by combining 30 nm DNA with either 250 nm M.EcoRV (wt), 300 nm K11A, or 800 nm R128A protein in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 μm sinefungin. The protein concentration had to be increased in case of the mutants, to observe a sufficient number of complexes. Samples were incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Then, 1 μl of the complex solution was mixed with 9 μl of 5 mm MgCl2 solution and deposited on freshly cleaved mica (Plano, Wetzlar), allowed to adhere for 40 s, and washed with 1 ml of bi-distilled water afterward. The sample was dried using compressed air.Protein-DNA complexes were observed by tapping mode in air using a Multimode AFM with a Nanoscope III controller (Digital instruments, Santa Barbara, CA). We used NST-NCHF silicon cantilevers (Nascatec, Stuttgart) with a nominal spring constant of 50 newton/m and a resonance frequency of ∼350 kHz. All images were obtained with a scanning speed of 0.5–1 Hz and a resolution of 512 × 512 pixels. Experiments were carried out blinded, i.e. the operator of the microscope did not know the previous data for each variant. To remove background slope, raw images were flattened using Nanoscope software. Particles on the DNA with a diameter of >8 nm and exceeding the height of the DNA molecule by >50% were considered to be bound protein.Because the orientation of the DNA could not be determined in the images, the distance of a bound protein to the closest end of the molecule was measured. When two proteins were bound to one DNA molecule, distances were measured with respect to the closest end of each single protein. Distances were evaluated after subdividing the 406-bp DNA substrate into 14 sections of approximately 5 nm each. The specific binding site is located in segment 14. Segments 2, 3, 9, and 10 contain GAT sites that were important for the analysis of the K11A variant. Bending angles were measured by drawing straight lines through the DNA arms adjacent to a binding protein using the section tool of the Nanosope software (version 6.11r1). The angle is given as deviation from the straight line across the binding protein.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe applied double mutant cycles for the identification of enzyme-DNA contacts relevant for DNA recognition of the M.EcoRV DNA MTase. To this end, we prepared variants of M.EcoRV in which candidate amino acid side chains were exchanged against alanine and studied their methylation activity using the cognate substrate GATATC and several near cognate substrates, in which 1 bp had been altered. The underlying idea of these experiments is illustrated in Fig. 2A. If an enzyme-DNA contact is present between amino acid D and base pair Z, the wild type enzyme will methylate near cognate substrates altered at base pair Z at a reduced rate because of the loss of the contact. Because a variant mutated at D lacks the contact, it often will show reduced activity at the cognate site. However, it will also show reduced ability to discriminate between cognate and near cognate substrates having altered bases at Z. Therefore, the near cognate substrate Z will show a less pronounced drop in activity (when compared with the activity at the cognate site) with mutant D than with the wild type enzyme. It is this absence of decline in activity that is indicative of a contact between D and Z. In contrast, removal of one contact between the enzyme and the DNA might make recognition of other bases become more stringent, because a complex of the protein mutated at D with a near cognate substrate that carries a base pair exchange at a site other than Z will contain two defects, one introduced by the mutation in the protein, the other by the base pair exchange. Hence, if an enzyme variant shows an increased accuracy of recognition of a near cognate substrate, one can conclude that the mutated amino acid side chain is not involved in recognition of that particular base pair, but it may be involved in recognition of other base pairs or in indirect readout of the DNA sequence.FIGURE 2Relative rates of methylation of various substrates by M. EcoRV and M.EcoRV variants. A, principle of the double mutant cycle approach for the identification of protein-DNA contacts applied here. In this example removal of amino acid D will abolish recognition of the Z base. This means that the specificity of the variant on near cognate substrates in which the 4th base pair is altered is lost. In contrast, recognition of the W, X, and Y bases becomes more specific. B, catalytic activity of M.EcoRV and its variants on the canonical GATATC substrate. Rates are given relative to the wild-type enzyme activity. C and D, DNA methylation specificities of M.EcoRV and its variants. In these panels, all activities were given in comparison to the methylation activity with the canonical substrate.

Structural modeling suggested that these residues might be candidates for recognition of the inner AT bases of the M.EcoRV sequence (data not shown). The Arg128 and Pro138 residues correspond to EcoDam Arg124 and Pro134. Arg145 presumably is located at the basis of the β-hairpin, which forms many of the specific contacts to the DNA in EcoDam and T4Dam (10Horton J.R. Liebert K. Bekes M. Jeltsch A. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 559-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 11Horton J.R. Liebert K. Hattman S. Jeltsch A. Cheng X. Cell. 2005; 121: 349-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These M.EcoRV variants had been studied already (20Beck C. Cranz S. Solmaz M. Roth M. Jeltsch A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10956-10965Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), but in the former project all experiments were designed based on the assumption that the GAT parts of the M.EcoRV and EcoDam recognition sites should be aligned (which is not correct), such that the influence of the exchanges had only been studied on the 3′ part of the recognition sequence. Also, in that paper only one near cognate substrate (A4C in the nomenclature used here) had been used with the mutant enzymes. Here, we investigated methylation of 13 near cognate substrates by all variants, an approach that was successful in the identification of enzyme-DNA contacts of the EcoDam enzyme (10Horton J.R. Liebert K. Bekes M. Jeltsch A. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 559-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 11Horton J.R. Liebert K. Hattman S. Jeltsch A. Cheng X. Cell. 2005; 121: 349-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).Catalytic Activity of the M.EcoRV and Its Variants at Cognate Substrates—To investigate the specific recognition of the DNA by the M.EcoRV, we exchanged 6 amino acid residues to alanine, purified the proteins, and determined their DNA methylation activity using the L20 substrate (which contains a cognate GATATC site) in vitro. The single turnover methylation rate constant of wild type M.EcoRV was 0.18 (±0.03) min–1, which is similar to values determined earlier (20Beck C. Cranz S. Solmaz M. Roth M. Jeltsch A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10956-10965Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The relative turnover rates of M.EcoRV and its variants averaged over 3–5 experiments are given in Fig. 2B, representative examples of individual methylation experiments are shown in supplemental Fig. S2. The K11A, R128A, and R145A showed strong reduction in activity, which indicates that these residues are functionally important for the enzyme. The activities of Q13A, K18A, and P138A were only slightly reduced or not reduced at all. However, this does not rule out a role of these residues in DNA recognition, because the EcoDam Pro134 is a key residue for the recognition of the third base pair, although the P134A variant also did not exhibit reduced activity at the cognate substrate (11Horton J.R. Liebert K. Hattman"
https://openalex.org/W2001669425,"Protein-tyrosine kinase Lyn and Syk are critical for antigen-receptor-induced signal transduction in mast cells. To identify novel Lyn/Syk substrates, we screened an RBL-2H3 bacterial expression library for proteins that were tyrosine phosphorylated with baculoviral expressed Lyn or Syk. Five clones as potential Lyn substrates and eight clones as Syk substrates were identified including known substrates such as SLP-76, LAT, and α-tubulin. A potential substrate of Lyn identified was the molecule TOM1L1, which has several domains thought to be important for membrane trafficking and protein-protein interactions. Because the function of TOM1L1 is unclear, the rat TOM1L1 full-length cDNA was isolated and used to express the protein in COS-1 and RBL-2H3 mast cells. In COS-1 cells, the co-transfection of TOM1L1 and Lyn, but not Syk, resulted in the tyrosine phosphorylation of TOM1L1. In RBL-2H3 mast cells, the overexpressed TOM1L1 was strongly tyrosine phosphorylated in non-stimulated cells, and this phosphorylation was enhanced by FcϵRI aggregation. By subcellular fractionation, wild-type TOM1L1 was mainly in the cytoplasm with a small fraction constitutively associated with the membrane; this association was markedly reduced in deletion mutants lacking several of the protein interaction domains. The overexpression of TOM1L1 enhanced antigen-induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α generation and release. Both protein interaction domains (VHS and the coiled-coil domains) were required for the increased TNFα release, but not the increased TNFα generation. These results suggest that TOM1L1 is a novel protein involved in the FcϵRI signal transduction for the generation of cytokines. Protein-tyrosine kinase Lyn and Syk are critical for antigen-receptor-induced signal transduction in mast cells. To identify novel Lyn/Syk substrates, we screened an RBL-2H3 bacterial expression library for proteins that were tyrosine phosphorylated with baculoviral expressed Lyn or Syk. Five clones as potential Lyn substrates and eight clones as Syk substrates were identified including known substrates such as SLP-76, LAT, and α-tubulin. A potential substrate of Lyn identified was the molecule TOM1L1, which has several domains thought to be important for membrane trafficking and protein-protein interactions. Because the function of TOM1L1 is unclear, the rat TOM1L1 full-length cDNA was isolated and used to express the protein in COS-1 and RBL-2H3 mast cells.

Both protein interaction domains (VHS and the coiled-coil domains) were required for the increased TNFα release, but not the increased TNFα generation. These results suggest that TOM1L1 is a novel protein involved in the FcϵRI signal transduction for the generation of cytokines. The aggregation of the high affinity IgE receptor (FcϵRI) on mast cells and basophils activates multiple signaling pathways that lead to degranulation and the release of mediators of allergic reactions. The earliest biochemical event following FcϵRI aggregation is the tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple signaling molecules (1Benhamou M. Gutkind J.S. Robbins K.C. Siraganian R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5327-5330Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 2Benhamou M. Ryba N.J. Kihara H. Nishikata H. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol.

Because FcϵRI lacks intrinsic enzymatic activity, this phosphorylation is due to the rapid activation of two non-receptor-type protein-tyrosine kinases, Lyn and Syk. In this pathway FcϵRI aggregation results in Lyn phosphorylating the Tyr residues of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs of the β and γ subunits of FcϵRI. The tyrosine-phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs of the β and γ subunits then recruit Lyn and Syk, respectively, through Src homology-2 (SH2) 5The abbreviations used are: SH2Src homology domain 2FcϵRIthe high affinity receptor for IgERACErapid amplification of cDNA endsTOM1L1target of myb1-like 1HAhemagglutininVHSdomain found in Vps27, Hrs, and STAMGATGGA and TOM domainGGAGolgi-localized, γ-ear containing, ARF-binding proteinEGFepidermal growth factorTNFαtumor necrosis factor αMAPmitogen-activated proteinsiRNAsmall interfering RNA 5The abbreviations used are: SH2Src homology domain 2FcϵRIthe high affinity receptor for IgERACErapid amplification of cDNA endsTOM1L1target of myb1-like 1HAhemagglutininVHSdomain found in Vps27, Hrs, and STAMGATGGA and TOM domainGGAGolgi-localized, γ-ear containing, ARF-binding proteinEGFepidermal growth factorTNFαtumor necrosis factor αMAPmitogen-activated proteinsiRNAsmall interfering RNA domain-mediated interactions, leading to phosphorylation and activation of Syk (3Kihara H.

To identify novel substrates of Lyn and Syk, we used a recently described genetic method for screening a cDNA expression library for proteins that were tyrosine phosphorylated in vitro by these kinases (23Lock P. Abram C.L. Gibson T. Courtneidge S.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4346-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Using an RBL-2H3 expression library, five clones as potential Lyn substrates and eight clones as Syk substrates were isolated including SLP-76, LAT, and α-tubulin. Among these clones, TOM1L1 (target of myb1-like 1), a member of the new TOM protein family of molecules, was identified as a novel Lyn substrate. The TOM family of proteins comprises three members, TOM1, TOM1L1/Srcasm, and TOM1L2 that all contain a VHS (Vps27, Hrs, and STAM) and a GAT (GGA and TOM) homology domain that are thought to be involved in vesicular trafficking (24Lohi O.

The function of TOM1L1 in antigen receptor signaling is unclear, although it has been reported that TOM1L1 interacts with Grb2, P85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, ubiquitin, Tollip, Hrs, and TSG101, and modulates EGF and Src-kinase signaling in keratinocytes (26Seykora J.T.

Biol. 2006; 26: 1932-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Because TOM1L1 was isolated as a potential substrate of Lyn, it was important to investigate whether this molecule is involved in antigen receptor signaling. To study the function of TOM1L1 in FcϵRI signal transduction, the full-length cDNA of rat TOM1L1 was isolated from rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells, a model system for basophils and mast cells. TOM1L1 protein was overexpressed in COS-1 and RBL-2H3 cells. Our experiments suggested that FcϵRI stimulation increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of TOM1L1, probably through Lyn; and overexpression of TOM1L1 enhanced antigen-stimulated TNFα synthesis and release. Furthermore, the VHS domain of TOM1L1 was required for the enhanced TNFα release. These results suggested that TOM1L1 is a novel Lyn substrate, and is involved in the FcϵRI signaling in mast cells. Materials and Antibodies—The RBL-2H3 cDNA λgt11 library has been described previously (32Nishikata H. Oliver C. Mergenhagen S.E. Siraganian R.P. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 862-870PubMed Google Scholar). The pBacPAK vector was from Clontech (Mountain View, CA), and pSVL vector was from Amersham Biosciences. A pBluescript vector containing the hemagglutinin (HA) sequence was kindly provided by Dr. Nicholas Ryba (NIDCR, National Institutes of Health). The pSV2-Neo vector expressing the neomycin resistance gene was from ATCC (Rockville, MD). pEAK 12 vector was from Edge-BioSystems (Gaithersburg, MD). The polyclonal anti-HA tag (HA probe, Y-11) antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (4G10) was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The rabbit anti-mouse TOM1L1 antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Seykora, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA (29Li W. Marshall C. Mei L. Dzubow L. Schmults C. Dans M. Seykora J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6036-6046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). All other antibodies used were previously described (33Basciano L.K. Berenstein E.H. Kmak L. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11823-11831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Zhang J. Berenstein E.H. Evans R.L. Siraganian R.P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Construction of Recombinant Baculoviral Syk and Lyn—The cDNAs containing the open reading frame of rat Syk and Lyn were ligated into pBacPAK vector for transfer to baculovirus (Syk was ligated into BamHI and EcoRI sites; whereas Lyn was inserted into BamHI and XbaI sites). For expression of baculoviral proteins, suspension cultures of Sf9 insect cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of ∼1 with recombinant baculovirus at a cell density of 1 × 106 cells/ml using serum-free medium Sf9-II (Invitrogen). Phosphorylation Screening—The technique used for phosphorylation screening was a modification of the method described by Lock et al. (23Lock P. Abram C.L. Gibson T. Courtneidge S.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4346-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Briefly, the Escherichia coli plates of a RBL-2H3 cDNA λgt11 expression library were overlaid for 12–14 h at 37 °C with nitrocellulose filter soaked in 10 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The filters were then blocked with blocking solution (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 3% bovine serum albumin), washed in Triton wash buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), rinsed in kinase reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm NaF, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Triton X-100), and incubated for 60 min at 30 °C in kinase reaction buffer supplemented with 1/20 to 1/100 volume of Sf9 cell lysates containing baculovirus-derived Lyn or Syk, respectively, and 250 μm ATP. After incubation, the filters were washed with kinase wash buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4), and incubated in stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2% SDS, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) at 50 °C for 30 min to remove possible associated phosphoproteins, including Lyn or Syk derived from Sf9 cells. The filters were then washed with TBST (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were detected by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody, 4G10. The positive clones were plaque-purified by successive rounds of phosphorylation screening. The cDNA inserts were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using Taq DNA polymerase HF (Invitrogen) and λgt11 forward and reverse primers, and then subcloned into pCR2.1 TOPO TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. Phosphorylation Assay of the Fusion Proteins Produced in λgt11 Recombinants—Crude lysates were prepared from λgt11 recombinant lysogens, separated by SDS-PAGE, and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane filters. After blocking and washing, the membranes were incubated for 60 min at 30 °C in kinase reaction buffer containing 25 μm unlabeled ATP and 1/10 volume of a cell lysate from uninfected Sf9 cells to mask phosphorylation by Sf9 cell-derived kinases. Following washing in kinase reaction buffer without ATP, membranes were incubated for 60 min at 30 °C with gentle shaking in kinase reaction buffer containing 25 μm unlabeled ATP, 5 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP, and 1/10 to 1/50 volume of Sf9 cell lysates containing baculovirus-derived Lyn or Syk, respectively. After washing, the signals were visualized by autoradiography. 5′-Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE)—The unknown sequence at the 5′-end of rat TOM1L1 was isolated by 5′-RACE (Invitrogen) using the sequence information from the λgt11 clone we identified (clone L6). RNA was isolated from RBL-2H3 cells using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). First strand cDNA was synthesized using a gene-specific antisense primer, 5′-TGTTGCCCAAAAAGTG-3′. Following the addition of homopolymeric tail to the 3′-end of the cDNA, two rounds of PCR were performed. The gene-specific anti-sense primer, 5′-CCAGCAGAGAAATGATCCAC-3′, and AAP primer (Invitrogen) were used for the primary PCR, and the gene-specific antisense primer, 5′-GTTCATTTGTCTCAGCATTCAC-3′, and AUAP primer (Invitrogen) were used for the secondary (nested) PCR. The 5′-RACE product was subcloned into pCR2.1 (Invitogen) and sequenced. Construction of Expression Vectors—The coding region of rat TOM1L1 cDNA was amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR using RBL-2H3 mRNA. The PCR primers were 5′-TGACCTCGAGCTCTGGAGCTACCATGGCGTTTG-3′ for the 5′-end, and 5′-TACGGATATCCGCATTCACATTGGCTTTGAGC-3′ for the 3′-end. To add the HA tag sequence to TOM1L1, the PCR product was digested with XhoI and EcoRV and ligated into the pBluescript-HA plasmid. The sequence of the VHS domain (amino acid positions 12–154) or the coiled-coil motif (amino acid positions 260–298) was deleted using a QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The primers used for deletion were 5′-CCGCGATCCCTACCCCTTGGATGGAG-3′/5′-CTCCATCCAAGGGGTAGGGATCGCGG-3′ for the VHS domain deletion (ΔVHS); and for the coiled-coil motif deletion (ΔCC), the primers were 5′-GCTGGTGGTAGTTCCGACGGAAGCC-3′/5′-GGCTTCCGTCGGAACTACCACCAGC-3′. After verification of the constructs by DNA sequencing, the pBluescript plasmids containing the wild-type TOM1L1-HA cDNA or its mutants were digested with XhoI and BamHI, and subcloned into the pSVL expression vector. To construct pEAK expression plasmid, the wild-type TOM1L1-HA and its mutants were amplified by PCR, and inserted into pEAK 12 vector. Cell Culture, cDNA Transfection, and Cell Activation—COS-1 and RBL-2H3 cells and their transfectants were cultured as described previously (34Zhang J. Berenstein E.H. Evans R.L. Siraganian R.P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were co-transfected with 1.5 μg of pSVL-TOM1L1-HA with the indicated combination of 1.5 μg of pSVL-Lyn or pSVL-Syk plasmids using FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Diagnostics Co.) and analyzed ∼48 h post-transfection. The C4A2 Syk-negative variant of the RBL-2H3 cells were stably transfected with pSVL wild-type Syk plus pSV2-neo (Syk) or pSV2-neo only (vector), and stable cloned lines were isolated. For transient transfection, RBL-2H3 cells were transfected with different forms of pEAK-TOM1L1-HA using the Amaxa system. Mast cell activation was by incubating cells with IgE and then stimulating with antigen as described previously (34Zhang J. Berenstein E.H. Evans R.L. Siraganian R.P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—For preparing cell lysates, RBL-2H3 cells were first washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm Na3VO4, 90 milliunits/ml aprotinin, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and then lysed at 4 °C in Triton lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 90 milliunits/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A). In COS-1 cell experiments, cells were solubilized with RIPA buffer (Triton lysis buffer containing 1% deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min. Lysates of Sf9 cells expressing Lyn or Syk were prepared essentially as described above except that the cells were harvested by centrifugation prior to lysis. For immunoprecipitation, postnuclear supernatants were first precleared by mixing with protein A-agarose beads (Sigma) and then immunoprecipitated with antibodies prebound to protein A-agarose beads. After gentle rotation at 4 °C for 2 h, the beads were washed four times, and then precipitated proteins were eluted by boiling for 5 min with 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. In some experiments, total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 coupled to agarose beads, and after washing the bound proteins were eluted with 100 mm phenyl phosphate. Total cell lysates and immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA). The blots were probed with individual primary antibodies, and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse or rabbit antibodies. Proteins were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Renaissance, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Subcellular Fractionation—For the preparation of cytosolic and membrane fractions, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and re-suspended in hypotonic buffer (42 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4 and protease inhibitors). Cell homogenates were again centrifuged (10 min at 200 × g), and the supernatants were again centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × g (35Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert S. Hernandez J. Rottapel R. Altman A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Supernatants of the second centrifugation were collected as the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was washed once with hypotonic buffer, then re-suspended in Laemmli sample buffer and collected as the membrane fraction. Equal volumes of the different fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with different antibodies. Cytokine Measurements—Cells sensitized with IgE were stimulated with or without antigen for 2 h at 37 °C. After stimulation, the supernatants and cells were collected separately, and analyzed for TNFα and MCP1 by specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits according to the manufacturer's instruction (BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA). Identification of Lyn/Syk Substrates—To identify novel substrates of Lyn and Syk, we screened a cDNA expression library for proteins that were tyrosine-phosphorylated in vitro by these kinases. Recombinant proteins expressed in phage plaques of an RBL-2H3 λgt11 expression library were immobilized on nitrocellulose filters, incubated with baculovirally expressed Lyn or Syk, and the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were detected with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. By this screening, eight clones as potential Syk substrates (S clones), and five clones as potential Lyn substrates (L clones) were identified (Tables 1 and 2). Conceptual translation showed that each clone, except S15, contained an insert that corresponded to a partial cDNA with an open reading frame. S7 was a part of α-tubulin, which has already been shown to be an in vitro substrate of Syk (21Peters J.D. Furlong M.T. Asai D.J. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4755-4762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Several clones were identified as substrates of both Lyn and Syk. For example, the Lyn substrates L1, L7, and L2 were the same as the Syk substrate clones S6, S9, and S10, respectively. S10 (same clone as L2) and S14 were the rat homologues of the adaptor proteins SLP-76 and LAT, respectively, which are known as molecules phosphorylated downstream of Syk (15Hendricks-Taylor L.R.

S9 (same clone as L7) matches a portion of the chromatin structural protein homologue (Supt5hp). S22 corresponds to the 5′ part of Mlx, a Max-like bHLHZip family transcription factor (36Billin A.N.

S6 (same clone as L1) and S8 correspond to partial cDNA of two different human hypothetical proteins. L6 contains a YEEL/I motif recognized by the SH2 domain of Src family protein-tyrosine kinases, and corresponds to the rat homologue of human TOM1L1, a recently identified molecule (37Songyang Z.

L14 was a partial clone of MCA-32 (mast cell antigen-32), and contains one of three tyrosine residues in its cytoplasmic domain that can potentially serve as sites for phosphorylation and SH2 domain interactions (40Pirozzi G. Terry R.W. Epstein D. Labow M.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5811-5818PubMed Google Scholar). Given that α-tubulin, SLP-76, and LAT have been previously shown to be phosphorylated downstream of Syk, our screening method did pick up potential substrates of these kinases.TABLE 1cDNA clones identified by expression screening for Lyn substratesCloneORFaRefers to the open reading frame (ORF) of the cDNA that is expressed in the fusion molecule in λgt11 (amino acid)Identity/homologyGenBank accession No.ORF (amino acid)L1bL1, -7, or -2 are the same clone as Lyn substrates S6, -9, and -10, respectively90Hypothetical protein (DKFZp434K1421)NM_032141558L2bL1, -7, or -2 are the same clone as Lyn substrates S6, -9, and -10, respectively444SLP-76 SH2 domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDaU20159533L673TOM1L1 (target of Myb1-like 1)AJ010071476L7bL1, -7, or -2 are the same clone as Lyn substrates S6, -9, and -10, respectively (3)cThe number of times each clone was identified by independent screenings is shown in parentheses169Supt5hp (chromatin structural protein homolog)U885391,082L1425MCA-32 (mast cell antigen-32)U39546268a Refers to the open reading frame (ORF) of the cDNA that is expressed in the fusion molecule in λgt11b L1, -7, or -2 are the same clone as Lyn substrates S6, -9, and -10, respectivelyc The number of times each clone was identified by independent screenings is shown in parentheses Open table in a new tab TABLE 2cDNA clones identified by expression screening for Syk substratesCloneORFaRefers to the open reading frame (ORF) of the cDNA that is expressed in the fusion molecule in λgt11 (amino acid)Identity/homologyGenBank accession No.ORF (amino acid)S6bS6, -9, or -10 are the same clone as Lyn substrates L1, -7, and -2, respectively90Hypothetical protein (DKFZp434K1421)NM_032141558S737α-TubulinV01226451S8136Hypothetical protein (FLJ10199)AK001061253S9bS6, -9, or -10 are the same clone as Lyn substrates L1, -7, and -2, respectively (2)cThe number of times each clone was identified by independent screenings is shown in parentheses169Supt5hp (chromatin structural protein homolog)U885391,082S10bS6, -9, or -10 are the same clone as Lyn substrates L1, -7, and -2, respectively (6)cThe number of times each clone was identified by independent screenings is shown in parentheses444SLP-76 SH2 domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDaU20159533S14 (2)cThe number of times each clone was identified by independent screenings is shown in parentheses18LAT (linker for activation of T cells)AJ001184242S1515LAP2 (lamina-"
