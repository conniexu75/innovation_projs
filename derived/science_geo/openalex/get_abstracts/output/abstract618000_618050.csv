https://openalex.org/W2890342895,"Background During normal pregnancy, placental oxidative stress (OS) is present during all three trimesters and is necessary to obtain normal cell function. However, if OS reaches a certain level, pregnancy complications might arise. In preeclampsia (PE), a dangerous pregnancy specific hypertensive disorder, OS induced in the ischemic placenta causes a systemic inflammatory response and activates maternal endothelial cells. In this study, we aimed to quantify superoxide concentrations (as a measure of systemic OS) using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and correlate them to markers of systemic inflammation, iron status and vascular function. Methods Fifty-nine women with a healthy pregnancy (HP), 10 non-pregnant controls (NP) and 28 PE patients (32±3.3weeks) were included. During HP, blood samples for superoxide, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), mean platelet volume (MPV) and iron status were taken at 10, 25 and 39 weeks. Vascular measurements for arterial stiffness (carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (CF-PWV), augmentation index (AIx), augmentation Pressure (AP)) and microvascular endothelial function (reactive hyperemia index (RHI)) were performed at 35 weeks. In PE, all measurements were performed at diagnosis. CMH (1-hydroxy-3-methoxycarbonyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolidine) was used as spin probe for EPR, since the formed CM radical corresponds to the amount of superoxide. Results Superoxide concentration remains stable during pregnancy (p = 0.92), but is significantly higher compared to the NP controls (p<0.0001). At 25 weeks, there is a significant positive correlation between superoxide and ferritin concentration. (p = 0.04) In PE, superoxide, systemic inflammation and iron status are much higher compared to HP (all p<0.001). During HP, superoxide concentrations correlate significantly with arterial stiffness (all p<0.04), while in PE superoxide is significantly correlated to microvascular endothelial function (p = 0.03). Conclusions During HP there is an increased but stable oxidative environment, which is correlated to ferritin concentration. If superoxide levels increase, there is an augmentation in arterial stiffness. In PE pregnancies, systemic inflammation and superoxide concentrations are higher and result in a deterioration of endothelial function. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that vascular function is directly linked to the amount of OS and that measurement of OS in combination with vascular function tests might be used in the prediction of PE."
https://openalex.org/W2890128665,"The high use of antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial diseases is one of the main problems in the mass production of animal protein. Salmon farming in Chile is a clear example of the above statement, where more than 5,500 tonnes of antibiotics have been used over the last 10 years. This has caused a great impact both at the production level and on the environment; however, there are still few works in relation to it. In order to demonstrate the impact of the high use of antibiotics on fish gut microbiota, we have selected four salmon farms presenting a similar amount of fish of the Atlantic salmon species (Salmo salar), ranging from 4,500 to 6,000 tonnes. All of these farms used treatments with high doses of antibiotics. Thus, 15 healthy fish were selected and euthanised in order to isolate the bacteria resistant to the antibiotics oxytetracycline and florfenicol from the gut microbiota. In total, 47 bacterial isolates resistant to florfenicol and 44 resistant to oxytetracycline were isolated, among which isolates with Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) exceeding 2048 μg/mL for florfenicol and 1024 μg/mL for oxytetracycline were found. In addition, another six different antibiotics were tested in order to demonstrate the multiresistance phenomenon. In this regard, six isolates of 91 showed elevated resistance values for the eight tested antibiotics, including florfenicol and oxytetracycline, were found. These bacteria were called ""super-resistant"" bacteria. This phenotypic resistance was verified at a genotypic level since most isolates showed antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) to florfenicol and oxytetracycline. Specifically, 77% of antibiotic resistant bacteria showed at least one gene resistant to florfenicol and 89% showed at least one gene resistant to oxytetracycline. In the present study, it was demonstrated that the high use of the antibiotics florfenicol and oxytetracycline has, as a consequence, the selection of multiresistant bacteria in the gut microbiota of farmed fish of the Salmo salar species at the seawater stage. Also, the phenotypic resistance of these bacteria can be correlated with the presence of antibiotic resistance genes."

Knockout strategies to determine the roles of all the insulin/insulin-like peptide ligands (INS) in C. elegans has been challenging due to functional redundancy. Here, we individually overexpressed each of the 40 ins genes pan-neuronally, and monitored multiple phenotypes including: L1 arrest life span, neuroblast divisions under L1 arrest, dauer formation, and fat accumulation, as readouts to characterize the functions of each INS in vivo. Of the 40 INS peptides, we found functions for 35 INS peptides and functionally categorized each as agonists, antagonists, or of pleiotropic function. In particular, we found that 9 of 16 agonistic INS peptides shortened L1 arrest life span and promoted neuroblast divisions during L1 arrest. Our study revealed that a subset of β-class INS peptides that contain a distinct F peptide sequence are agonists. Our work is the first to categorize the structures of INS peptides and relate these structures to the functions of all 40 INS peptides in vivo. Our findings will promote the study of insulin function on development, metabolism, and aging-related diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2949941772,"CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) using dCas9-sgRNA is a powerful tool for the exploration and manipulation of gene functions. Here we quantify the reversible switching of a central process of the bacterial cell cycle by CRISPRi and an antisense RNA mechanism. Reversible induction of filamentous growth in E. coli has been recently demonstrated by controlling the expression levels of the bacterial cell division proteins FtsZ/FtsA via CRISPRi. If FtsZ falls below a critical level, cells cannot divide. However, the cells remain metabolically active and continue with DNA replication. We surmised that this makes them amenable to an inducible antisense RNA strategy to counteract FtsZ inhibition. We show that both static and inducible thresholds can adjust the characteristics of the switching process. Combining bulk data with single cell measurements, we characterize the efficiency of the switching process. Successful restoration of division is found to occur faster in the presence of antisense sgRNAs than upon simple termination of CRISPRi induction."
https://openalex.org/W2891531527,"Cases of vomiting and diarrhoea were reported in racing pigeons in Western Australia in May, 2016. Morbidity and mortality rates were high. Similar clinical disease was seen in Victoria in December and by early 2017 had been reported in all states except the Northern Territory, in different classes of domestic pigeon–racing, fancy and meat bird–and in a flock of feral pigeons. Autopsy findings were frequently unremarkable; histological examination demonstrated significant hepatic necrosis as the major and consistent lesion, often with minimal inflammatory infiltration. Negative contrast tissue suspension and thin section transmission electron microscopy of liver demonstrated virus particles consistent with a member of the Reoviridae. Inoculation of trypsin-treated Vero, MDBK and MA-104 cell lines resulted in cytopathic changes at two days after infection. Next generation sequencing was undertaken using fresh liver samples and a previously undescribed group A rotavirus (genotype G18P[17]) of avian origin was identified and the virus was isolated in several cell lines. A q-RT-PCR assay was developed and used to screen a wider range of samples, including recovered birds. Episodes of disease have continued to occur and to reoccur in previously recovered lofts, with variable virulence reported. This is the first report of a rotavirus associated with hepatic necrosis in any avian species."
https://openalex.org/W2891946705,"The protective immune response in zebrafish (Danio rerio) against the parasitic ciliate Ichthyophthirius multifiliis, targeting host skin, fins and gills, comprises an accelerated and manifold elevated immunoglobulin gene expression as well as a significantly elevated number of neutrophils at infected sites. Experimental fish were subjected to a primary I. multifiliis infection followed by a series of secondary exposures before they were challenged by a high dosage of infective theronts. Immunized fish responded immediately with a protective response suggesting existence of immunological memory whereas fish exposed to the parasite for the first time obtained a marked infection. The primary response to infection was dominated by expression of genes encoding acute phase reactants and inflammatory cytokines as well as recruitment of neutrophils at infected locations. Immunized fish showed a significantly upregulated immunoglobulin gene expression following challenge, which indicates existence of a secondary response effected by antibodies. Both responses induced a significantly elevated expression of the Th2 signature cytokine Il13. The increased presence of neutrophils in immunized fish suggests that innate cell mediated immunity supplements or influence the protective response against the parasite."
https://openalex.org/W2889664628,"Social Network Analysis establishes a network system and provides information about the relationships (edges) between system components (nodes). Although nodes usually correspond to actors within the network (e.g., the players), it is possible to stipulate game actions as nodes, thus creating a network of the flow of game actions. In this study, Eigenvector Centrality (a form of weighted centrality that considers n-order connections) was used to identify differences in the centrality of distinct game actions within each of the six game complexes of volleyball. Thirteen matches (46 sets, 2,049 rallies) of the final round of the 2015 FIVB's World Grand Prix (Women) were analyzed. Results showed that analyzing actions as actors (i.e., nodes) offers a clear and comprehensive understanding of game flow and poses an interesting alternative to mainstream research where players are considered nodes. Functional differences between the six game complexes were highlighted, denoting the validity of such division. Out-of-system playing (i.e., having to set the attack under non-ideal conditions, e.g., in KI, KII, KIII and KIV), emerged as a regularity of the game and should be translated into the training process."
https://openalex.org/W2742811494,"In analysis of multi-component complex systems, such as neural systems, identifying groups of units that share similar functionality will aid understanding of the underlying structures of the system. To find such a grouping, it is useful to evaluate to what extent the units of the system are separable. Separability or inseparability can be evaluated by quantifying how much information would be lost if the system were partitioned into subsystems, and the interactions between the subsystems were hypothetically removed. A system of two independent subsystems are completely separable without any loss of information while a system of strongly interacted subsystems cannot be separated without a large loss of information. Among all the possible partitions of a system, the partition that minimizes the loss of information, called the Minimum Information Partition (MIP), can be considered as the optimal partition for characterizing the underlying structures of the system. Although the MIP would reveal novel characteristics of the neural system, an exhaustive search for the MIP is numerically intractable due to the combinatorial explosion of possible partitions. Here, we propose a computationally efficient search to precisely identify the MIP among all possible partitions by exploiting the submodularity of the measure of information loss, when the measure of information loss is submodular. Submodularity is a mathematical property of set functions which is analogous to convexity in continuous functions. Mutual information is one such submodular information loss function, and is a natural choice for measuring the degree of statistical dependence between paired sets of random variables. By using mutual information as a loss function, we show that the search for MIP can be performed in a practical order of computational time for a reasonably large system (N = 100 ∼ 1000). We also demonstrate that MIP search allows for the detection of underlying global structures in a network of nonlinear oscillators."
https://openalex.org/W2892065575,"To identify proportion of and factors for comprehensive knowledge on prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV in pregnant women attending antenatal care in Northern Ethiopia.A total of 416 pregnant women were interviewed between October 2012 and May 2013. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors for comprehensive knowledge on prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.The proportion of pregnant women, who have comprehensive knowledge on prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, was 52%. The odds of having comprehensive knowledge on prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV were higher among pregnant women who were younger (16 to 24 years old) (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 2.95; 95%CI: 1.20, 7.26), urban residents (AOR = 2.45; 95%CI: 1.39, 4.32), attending secondary education and above (AOR = 4.43; 95%CI: 2.40, 8.20), employed (AOR = 4.99;95%CI: 2.45, 10.16), have five children or more (AOR = 9.34; 95%CI:3.78, 23.07), have favored attitude towards HIV positive living (AOR = 2.53; 95%CI: 1.43, 4.44) and have perceived susceptibility to HIV (AOR = 10.72; 95%CI: 3.90, 29.39).The proportion of women who have comprehensive knowledge on prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV in this study setting was low. Measures which will escalate mother's knowledge on prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV should be emphasized. Efforts to improve mother's knowledge on prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV should target women who were older age (> = 35years), rural residents, unemployed, not attending formal education, primigravids, have no favored attitude towards HIV positive living and have not perceived susceptibility to HIV."
https://openalex.org/W2889775287,"Background Treatment by venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) is widely used today, even though it is associated with high risks of complications and death. While studies have focused on the relationship between some of these complications and the risk of death, the relationship between different complications has never been specifically examined, despite the fact that the occurrence of one complication is known to favor the occurrence of others. Our objective was to describe the relationship between complications in patients undergoing VA-ECMO in intensive care unit (ICU) and to identify, if possible, patterns of patients according to complications. Methods and findings As part of a retrospective cohort study, we conducted a multiple correspondence analysis followed by a hierarchical ascendant classification in order to identify patterns of patients according to main complications (sepsis, thromboembolic event, major transfusion, major bleeding, renal replacement therapy) and in-ICU death. Our cohort of 145 patients presented an in-ICU mortality rate of 50.3%. Morbidity was high, with 36.5% of patients presenting three or more of the five complications studied. Multiple correspondence analysis revealed a cumulative inertia of 76.9% for the first three dimensions. Complications were clustered together and clustered close to death, prompting the identification of four patterns of patients according to complications, including one with no complications. Conclusions Our study, based on a large cohort of patients undergoing VA-ECMO in ICU and presenting a mortality rate comparable to that reported in the literature, identified numerous and often interrelated complications. Multiple correspondence analysis and hierarchical ascendant classification yielded clusters of patients and highlighted specific links between some of the complications studied. Further research should be conducted in this area."
https://openalex.org/W2890117977,"Objective Self-esteem is a good predictor of mental health and is crucial for well-being and psychological functioning. It is especially important in situations where there are potential mental health problems, such as in people suffering from hearing loss or total deafness. This study aims to gauge the level of self-esteem in adults with hearing problems, in particular those who, in adulthood, had received a cochlear implant (CI). The subjects had different onset (pre-lingual/post-lingual) and amount (deafness/partial deafness) of hearing loss, and their current level of self-esteem was compared to that of the general population. The association of self-esteem with other deafness-related variables (e.g. satisfaction with their CI or whether they also used a hearing aid) and sociodemographic factors was also investigated. Methods Data were obtained from questionnaires mailed to patients who, when adult, had received a CI. The subjects were divided into four subgroups: subjects with pre-lingual deafness, post-lingual deafness, pre-lingual partial deafness, and post-lingual partial deafness. To evaluate their self-esteem, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) was used. For data on sociodemographic status and information related to deafness and CI, we used our own Information Inquiry form. For statistical analysis of the results, we compared means (t-test, ANOVA), investigated correlations, and applied linear regression. Results The self-esteem of deaf and partially deaf CI users was significantly lower than in the general population, especially for post-lingually deafened subjects. The only factor related to deafness and CIs that explained self-esteem was self-rated satisfaction with the CI–meaning that higher satisfaction was associated with higher self-esteem. The major sociodemographic factor that explained self-esteem was marital/partnership status (being in a relationship was helpful). Also men had higher self-esteem than women. Those with higher levels of education, and those working or studying, had higher self-esteem than those who did not. RSES was found to have a single-factor structure. Conclusion Deafness and partial deafness appear to be risk factors for lower self-esteem, a finding that rehabilitation, medical, educational, and employment communities should be made aware of. Medical intervention in the form of a CI supplies the person with improved hearing, but it is not a panacea: their self-esteem is still vulnerable, and reinforcement of self-esteem is an aspect that professionals should focus on. Psychological, psycho-educational, and psychotherapeutic interventions have important roles to play for CI recipients."
https://openalex.org/W2891199640,"Based on three-dimensional scanning and computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) techniques, customized bracket systems are increasingly used. However, data remain limited regarding customized bracket design, characteristics, and stability. This study was undertaken to evaluate the design, bond strength, and residual adhesives of four different CAD/CAM customized brackets that were attached to human tooth specimens by indirect bonding. Thirty extracted human upper premolars were divided into five groups: Group 1, preadjusted self-ligating labial metal bracket; Group 2, lingual self-ligating metal injection molding customized bracket; Group 3, gold-casted lingual customized bracket; Group 4, labial self-ligating milled customized bracket; Group 5, labial customized resin base bracket. Except in Group 1, premolar specimens were scanned via model scanner, and the images were sent to each manufacturing company to fabricate customized brackets and transfer trays/jigs. Debonding force (DF; N) was measured by Instron universal testing machine and shear bond strength (SBS; MPa) was calculated via dividing DF by bonding area. Adhesive remnants were analyzed via stereo microscopic images. Group 2 (196.90±82.75 N) exhibited significantly higher DF than Group 1 (62.77±12.65 N); other groups exhibited similar DFs, compared with Group 1. No customized bracket groups exhibited significant differences in SBS, relative to Group 1 (6.73±1.36 MPa). However, SBS in Group 5 (11.46±7.22 MPa) was significantly higher than in Group 3 (3.58±2.14 MPa). Group 3 had significantly lower ARI scores than other groups (P<0.05). Customized brackets exhibited large deviations in DF and SBS; all customized bracket systems exhibited DF that was equivalent or superior to that of preadjusted brackets, even when placed by indirect bonding."
https://openalex.org/W2791319306,"Short and well defined promoters are essential for advancing cyanobacterial biotechnology. The heterocyst of Nostoc sp. is suggested as a microbial cell factory for oxygen sensitive catalysts, such as hydrogenases for hydrogen production, due to its microoxic environment. We identified and predicted promoter elements of possible significance through a consensus strategy using a pool of heterocyst-induced DIF+ promoters known from Anabaena sp. PCC 7120. To test if these conserved promoter elements were crucial for heterocyst-specific expression, promoter-yfp reporter constructs were designed. The characterization was accomplished by replacing, -35 and -10 regions and the upstream element, with well described elements from the trc promoter of Escherichia coli, which is also functional in Nostoc sp. From the in vivo spatial fluorescence of the different promoter-yfp reporters in Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133, we concluded that both the consensus -35 and extended -10 regions were important for heterocyst-specific expression. Further that the promoter strength could be improved by the addition of an upstream element. We designed a short synthetic promoter of 48 nucleotides, PsynDIF, including a consensus DIF1 sequence, a 17 base pair stretch of random nucleotides and an extended consensus -10 region, and thus generated the shortest promoter for heterocyst-specific expression to date."
https://openalex.org/W2889849835,"This trial was designed to evaluate the off-label use of ceftiofur with Marek's vaccine in one-day-old broiler chicks, a prophylactic treatment that has been done in some commercial hatcheries, on the emergence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-E. coli). A total of 168 chicks (Cobb500®) were used in a completely randomized design. Birds were assigned to two treatments (Marek's vaccine plus saline vs Marek's vaccine plus ceftiofur) and six repetitions, with 14 animals each. Cloacal swabs were collected from 1 to 14 days post-hatch. The majority (86%; p<0.0001) of the ESBL-producing isolates harboring blaCTX-M and blaSHV genes originated from animals receiving the antimicrobial. None of the isolates were positive for plasmid-mediated AmpC betalactamase genes (blaACC, blaCMY-2, blaDHA, blaFOX, blaMOX and blaMIR). These findings indicate that the off-label use of ceftiofur with Marek's vaccine is associated with the short-term increase in ESBL-producing Escherichia coli in the gut of chicks."
https://openalex.org/W2889931477,"Objectives This study aimed to identify possible groups of people with dementia (PWD) in nursing homes with different trajectories of proxy-rated quality of life (QoL), and to explore how anxiety (along with other characteristics) was associated with these trajectories of QoL of PWD in nursing homes at a 12-month follow-up. Methods We included 298 PWD aged 65 years and older from 17 Norwegian nursing homes. The Norwegian version of the Rating Anxiety in Dementia scale (RAID-N) was used to assess anxiety, defined as RAID-N score ≥12; proxy-rated QoL was assessed by Quality of Life in Late-Stage Dementia (QUALID). The assessments were made at baseline and after a mean follow-up period of 350 days (SD 12.3). A growth mixture model identified two distinct trajectories of QUALID scores. Association between the QUALID score trajectories and demographic and clinical characteristics were analyzed with logistic regression models. Results Trajectory group 1 (206 participants) had a lower proportion of participants with anxiety, and a more stable and better QoL, compared to trajectory group 2 (92 participants) at a 12-month follow-up. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, more severe impairment in activities of daily living, along with presence of anxiety, depression, agitation, and use of antipsychotics at baseline, were associated with belonging to the trajectory group with proxy-rated poor QoL. Significances This study reveals that anxiety is associated with proxy-rated poor QoL of PWD at a 12-month follow-up. Efforts should be made to identify anxiety among nursing home residents with dementia to initiate treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2891965950,"Background Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients experience a high risk of cardiovascular disease (CV); however, the factors involved in CV-related morbidity and mortality in these patients have not been fully defined. Tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a cytokine, which exhibits pleiotropic activities on endothelial, vascular smooth muscle and inflammatory cells, with relevant effects on atheromatous plaque formation. On this basis, the present study aims to investigate the role of TRAIL in atheromatosis progression in CKD patients. Methods Circulating TRAIL levels were measured in 378 CKD patients belonging to the Spanish National Observatory of Atherosclerosis in Nephrology (NEFRONA) study. All patients were free of previous CV events. Carotid and femoral B-mode ultrasound was performed to detect the presence of plaque at baseline and after 24 months of follow-up. Results The lowest levels of TRAIL at baseline were significantly (p<0.05) associated with the appearance, after 24 months of follow-up, of at least two new atheromatous plaques in all territories and of one new plaque in the carotid artery, even after adjusting for CV risk factors. In addition, the patients with low levels of TRAIL at baseline were characterized by the presence of at least one hypoechoic plaque in the carotid artery. This association was significant (p<0.05) even after adjusting for CKD stage. Conclusions Overall, the results of our study suggest TRAIL as an assertable independent prognostic biomarker for atheromatosis plaque formation in CKD patients. This observation further supports the potential role of TRAIL for the prevention/treatment of CV disease."
https://openalex.org/W2891507724,"Bivalves are one of the most representative groups in the Phylum Mollusca, with over 1,100 freshwater species around the world except Antarctica. About 900 of these species belong to the Order Unionida Gray, 1854. In South America, the distributional range of the Unionida includes all countries in the region and extends as far south as the lakes and rivers of Argentinean-Chilean Patagonia. With the aim of generating distribution maps for the different genera of Unionida in Argentina, we consulted the databases of the nation’s main official malacological collections. The data were analyzed and georeferenced using the point-radius method. Spatial analyses were performed with the software Q-GIS 2.16.3 Nødebo using vector layers under the 2007 Argentinean Geodesic Positions reference system. A total 1,833 lots were analyzed, of which it was possible to georeference 1,503. The distribution of Unionida in Argentinean territory was analyzed according to political provinces, Surface Drainage Basins and the Argentinean Protected Areas. Species richness was analyzed using the surface drainage basins of Argentina. We generate distribution maps for each genus and discuss the species threat status and conservation degree in the region. Only six (18%) of the Unionida present in Argentina have been classified by the IUCN, four are Least Concern and two are Data Deficient. This pattern is also valid for all of South America. More than 95% of the distributional range of the Unionida has no protected area. Conservation management is necessary for the preservation of Unionida diversity in southern South America."
https://openalex.org/W2889648055,"The robustness and resilience of complex networks have been widely studied and discussed in both research and industry because today, the diversity of system components and the complexity of the connection between units are increasingly influencing the reliability of complex systems. Previous studies have focused on node failure in networks, proposing several performance indicators. However, a single performance indicator cannot comprehensively measure all the performance aspects; thus, the selected performance indicators and recovery strategies lack consistency with respect to the targeted complex systems. This paper introduces a novel stress–strength-balanced weighted network model based on two network transmission hypotheses. Then, with respect to different concerns of the complex network, we propose two modified network performance measurement indicators and compare these indicators in terms of their trends in the attack process. In addition, we introduce several network recovery strategies and compare their efficiencies. Our findings are as follows: (1) The evaluation and judgment of the network performance depend on the performance measurement indicators we use. (2) Different recovery strategies exhibit distinct efficiencies in recovering different aspects of network performance, and no strategy exists that can improve all the network performance aspects simultaneously. (3) The timing of the recovery is proved to have a deep influence on the cost and efficiency of network recovery; thus, the optimal recovery strategy for a damaged network varies with the extent of the damage. From the results of the simulation of the attack-recovery process, we conclude that while defining and analyzing complex network models, we should adjust our network topology, weight assignment, and performance indicators in accordance with the focal characteristics of complex systems so that we can use the network model to build robust complex systems and efficient logistics and maintenance strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2892074494,"Risk maps of dengue disease offer to the public health officers a tool to model disease risk in space and time. We analyzed the geographical distribution of relative incidence risk of dengue disease in a high incidence city from Colombia, and its evolution in time during the period January 2009—December 2015, identifying regional effects at different levels of spatial aggregations. Cases of dengue disease were geocoded and spatially allocated to census sectors, and temporally aggregated by epidemiological periods. The census sectors are nested in administrative divisions defined as communes, configuring two levels of spatial aggregation for the dengue cases. Spatio-temporal models including census sector and commune-level spatially structured random effects were fitted to estimate dengue incidence relative risks using the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) technique. The final selected model included two-level spatial random effects, a global structured temporal random effect, and a census sector-level interaction term. Risk maps by epidemiological period and risk profiles by census sector were generated from the modeling process, showing the transmission dynamics of the disease. All the census sectors in the city displayed high risk at some epidemiological period in the outbreak periods. Relative risk estimation of dengue disease using INLA offered a quick and powerful method for parameter estimation and inference."
https://openalex.org/W2889927942,"The objective of this work was to investigate the clinical significance of promoter gene DNA methylation changes in whole blood from African-American (AA) men with prostate cancer (PCa). We used high throughput pyrosequencing analysis to quantify percentage DNA methylation levels in a panel of 8 genes (RARβ2, TIMP3, SPARC, CDH13, HIN1, LINE1, CYB5R2 and DRD2) in blood DNA obtained from PCa and non-cancerous controls cases. Correlations of methylation status and various clinicopathological features were evaluated. Six genes tested achieved significant difference in DNA methylation levels between the PCa compared to control cases (P < 0.05). The TIMP3 loci demonstrated significant correlation of DNA methylation with age for all cases analyzed (p < 0.05). We observed an inverse correlation between CDH13 methylation (p = 0.045; r = -0.21) and serum vitamin D level whereas TIMP3 methylation (p = 0.021; r = -0.24) and DRD2 methylation (p = 0.056; r = -0.201) showed inverse correlation with supplementary vitamin D in the cancer cases. We also observed a direct correlation between methylation of RARβ2 (p = 0.0036; r = 0.293) and SPARC (p = 0.0134; r = 0.20) loci with PSA level in the controls but not the cancer cases. In addition, alcohol cases significantly correlated with higher RARβ2 methylation (p = 0.0314) in comparison with non-alcohol cases. Furthermore, we observed an inverse correlation of DRD2 methylation (p = 0.0349; r = -0.343) and Gleason score. Our data suggests that promoter methylation occurred more frequently in the blood of AA PCa and is associated with various clinicopathological features in AA men with PCa."
https://openalex.org/W2891117088,"Neutrophils are innate immune response cells designed to kill invading microorganisms. One of the mechanisms neutrophils use to kill bacteria is generation of damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) via the respiratory burst. However, during enteric salmonellosis, neutrophil-derived ROS actually facilitates Salmonella expansion and survival in the gut. This seeming paradox led us to hypothesize that Salmonella may possess mechanisms to influence the neutrophil respiratory burst. In this work, we used an in vitro Salmonella-neutrophil co-culture model to examine the impact of enteric infection relevant virulence factors on the respiratory burst of human neutrophils. We report that neutrophils primed with granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor and suspended in serum containing complement produce a robust respiratory burst when stimulated with viable STm. The magnitude of the respiratory burst increases when STm are grown under conditions to induce the expression of the type-3 secretion system-1. STm mutants lacking the type-3 secretion system-1 induce less neutrophil ROS than the virulent WT. In addition, we demonstrate that flagellar motility is a significant agonist of the neutrophil respiratory burst. Together our data demonstrate that both the type-3 secretion system-1 and flagellar motility, which are established virulence factors in enteric salmonellosis, also appear to directly influence the magnitude of the neutrophil respiratory burst in response to STm in vitro."

However, the impact of splenectomy on survival remains uncertain. This study aimed to investigate the impact of splenectomy on survival among patients with gastric carcinoma. Methods Of 1074 patients who underwent total gastrectomy for proximal gastric carcinoma between 2006 and 2014, 229 patients underwent concomitant splenectomy or pancreaticosplenectomy during surgery. We investigated the prognostic impact of splenectomy using a regression and propensity score matched model. Results The splenectomy and non-splenectomy groups differed in many baseline characteristics, including tumor stage, and had respective crude 5-year survival rates of 55% and 81% (p <0.001). In a multivariate analysis adjusted for TNM stage and other prognostic factors, splenectomy was an independent poor prognostic factor for overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.11–2.51) and disease-free survival (HR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.24–2.10). A survival evaluation stratified by TNM stage showed that splenectomy adversely affected survival among patients with stage III, but not stage I, II, and IV disease. In the propensity score-matched sample, splenectomy group also showed significantly worse overall survival (5-year, 65% vs. 79%, p = 0.010) and disease-free survival (5-year, 55% vs. 72%, p = 0.025) and was an independent poor prognostic factor in a multivariate analysis adjusting TNM stage and other prognostic factors. Conclusions Splenectomy adversely affects survival, particularly among patients with stage III gastric carcinoma, and should be avoided unless there is direct invasion to the splenic hilum."
https://openalex.org/W2890071829,"Extra-cellular galectin-9 (gal-9) is an immuno-modulatory protein with predominant immunosuppressive effects. Inappropriate production of gal-9 has been reported in several human malignancies and viral diseases like nasopharyngeal, pancreatic and renal carcinomas, metastatic melanomas and chronic active viral hepatitis. Therefore therapeutic antibodies neutralizing extra-cellular gal-9 are expected to contribute to immune restoration in these pathological conditions. Two novel monoclonal antibodies targeting gal-9 –Gal-Nab 1 and 2—have been produced and characterized in this study. We report a protective effect of Gal-Nab1 and Gal-Nab2 on the apoptotic cell death induced by gal-9 in primary T cells. In addition, they inhibit late phenotypic changes observed in peripheral T cells that survive gal-9-induced apoptosis. Gal-Nab1 and Gal-Nab2 bind nearly identical, overlapping linear epitopes contained in the 213–224 amino-acid segments of gal-9. Nevertheless, they have some distinct functional characteristics suggesting that their three-dimensional epitopes are distinct. These differences are best demonstrated when gal-9 is applied on Jurkat cells where Gal-Nab1 is less efficient than Gal-Nab2 in the prevention of apoptotic cell death. In addition, Gal-Nab1 stimulates non-lethal phosphatidylserine translocation at the plasma membrane and calcium mobilization triggered by gal-9 in these cells. Both Gal-Nab1 and 2 cross-react with murine gal-9. They bind its natural as well as its recombinant form. This cross-species recognition will be an advantage for their assessment in pre-clinical tumor models."
https://openalex.org/W2890382415,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a viral pathogen transmitted by the fecal-oral route and is a major cause of waterborne acute hepatitis in many developing countries. In addition to infecting humans, HEV has been identified in swine, wild boars, rabbits and other mammals; with swine and wild boars being main reservoirs for zoonotic transmission of HEV. There are four major HEV genotypes known to infect humans; genotypes 1 (HEV-1) and 2 (HEV-2) are restricted to humans, and genotypes 3 (HEV-3) and 4 (HEV-4) are zoonotic. Herein, three human HEV strains originating in France were sequenced and near full-length genomes were characterized. Phylogenetic analysis showed that two strains were genotype 3 and closely grouped (a 100% bootstrap value) with subtype 3i reference strains. In percent nucleotide identities, these two strains were 94% identical to each other, 90–93% identical to subtype 3i strains, 82–86% identical to other HEV-3, and 77–79% identical to rabbit HEV strains excluding the two divergent strains KJ013414 and KJ013415 (74%); these two strains were less than 77% identical to strains of HEV genotypes 1, 2 and 4. The third strain was found distinct from any known HEV strains in the database, and located between the clusters of HEV-3 and rabbit HEV strains. This unique strain was 74–75% identical to HEV-1, 73% to HEV-2, 81–82% to HEV-3, 77–79% to rabbit HEV again excluding the two divergent strains KJ013414 and KJ013415 (74%), and 74–75% to HEV-4, suggesting a novel unclassified strain associated with HEV-3 and rabbit HEV. SimPlot and BootScan analyses revealed a putative recombination of HEV-3 and rabbit HEV sequences at four breakpoints. Phylogenetic trees of the five fragments of the genome confirmed the presence of two HEV-3 derived and three unclassified sequences. Analyses of the amino acid sequences of the three open reading frames (ORF1-3) encoded proteins of these three novel strains showed that some amino acid residues specific to rabbit HEV strains were found solely in this unclassified strain but not in the two newly identified genotype 3i strains. The results obtained by SimPlots, BootScans, phylogenetic analyses, and amino acid sequence comparisons in this study all together appear to suggest that this novel unclassified strain is likely carrying a mosaic genome derived from HEV-3 and rabbit HEV sequences, and is thus designated as a putative genotype 3/rabbit HEV recombinant."
https://openalex.org/W2890970971,"Yifei Tongluo (YFTL) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulation which has been shown clinical efficacy in treatment of patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in China. However, the underlying mechanisms of the effects of YFTL are lacking. This study investigated the effects of YFTL on immune regulation with a mouse lung infection model with Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG). We found that compared with untreated mice, the lung mycobacterial load in YFTL-treated mice was significantly reduced, accompanied by alleviated pulmonary inflammation with reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increase of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Flow cytometry analyses showed that Th1 cells were significantly higher in the lungs of YFTL-treated mice at early infection time. The results suggest that YFTL-treatment down-regulates pulmonary inflammation, which facilitates a rapid infiltration of Th1 cells into the lungs. Moreover, the Th1 cells in the lungs were resolved faster at later time concomitant with increased the regulatory T cells (Tregs). The reduction of mycobacterial burden associated with improved tissue pathology, faster Th1 cell trafficking, and accelerated resolution of Th1 cells in the lungs of YFTL-treated mice indicates that YFTL improves mycobacterial clearance by maintaining lung homeostasis and dynamically regulating T cells in the lung parenchyma, and suggests that YFTL can be used as host-directed therapies that target immune responses to mycobacterial infection."

However, the mechanisms determining the protein selectivity for specific glycosphingolipids (GSLs) are unclear. Here, we report the crystal structure of the GLTP homology (GLTPH) domain of human 4-phosphate adaptor protein 2 (FAPP2) bound with N-oleoyl-galactosylceramide. Using this domain, FAPP2 transports glucosylceramide from its cis-Golgi synthesis site to the trans-Golgi for conversion into complex GSLs. The FAPP2–GLTPH structure revealed an element, termed the ID loop, that controls specificity in the GLTP family. We found that, in accordance with FAPP2 preference for simple GSLs, the ID loop protrudes from behind the SL headgroup-recognition center to mitigate binding by complex GSLs. Mutational analyses including GLTP and FAPP2 chimeras with swapped ID loops supported the proposed restrictive role of the FAPP2 ID loop in GSL selectivity. Comparative analysis revealed distinctly designed ID loops in each GLTP family member. This analysis also disclosed a conserved H-bond triplet that “clasps” both ID-loop ends together to promote structural autonomy and rigidity. The findings indicated that various ID loops work in concert with conserved recognition centers to create different specificities among family members. We also observed four bulky, conserved hydrophobic residues involved in “sensor-like” interactions with lipid chains in protein hydrophobic pockets and FF motifs in GLTP and FAPP2, well-positioned to provide acyl chain–dependent SL selectivity for the hydrophobic pockets.

Crystal structures of different holo forms of human GLTP provide insights into the structural features responsible for the recognition of GalCer, GlcCer, LacCer, and SF. Also available are two apo structures of other GSL-specific members and different holo forms of two C1P-specific members, providing a potential source for comparative analyses. However, the basis for the focused FAPP2–GLTPH selectivity for simple GSLs has remained a matter of speculation because of the lack of structure determination for FAPP2. To address the issue, we present here the 1.45 Å resolution crystal structure of FAPP2–GLTPH domain (residues 308–519) complexed with the GSL, N-oleoyl-galactosylceramide (18:1-GalCer), and perform comparative analysis that includes other available structures of the GLTP superfamily members. The approach provides insights into the strict preference of FAPP2 for simple GSLs; reveals a unique element, termed the ID-loop, that distinguishes each particular protein of the family; and enables identification of previously unrecognized but important elements of the GLTP fold. After numerous crystallization trials were unsuccessful, we introduced the E377A/E378K double mutation far from functionally important regions (Fig. S1a) to reduce the excessive negative surface charge of FAPP2–GLTPH domain (residues 308–519) (2Kamlekar R.K.

However, compared with GLTP, FAPP2 allows different sphingosine chain positioning (Fig. 1e) within the same binding mode and for the same GSL molecule. Fig. 2a shows the structure of FAPP2–GLTPH domain bound with 18:1-GalCer in superposition with other three members of the GSL-specific subfamily with known X-ray structures. Superimposition that includes C1P-specific members of the GLTP superfamily with known 3D structures is shown in Fig. S1a. Differences between ACD11 versus CPTP and CPTP versus FAPP2–GLTPH are highlighted in Fig. S1 (c and d). Poststructural sequence alignment of all six proteins (Fig. 2b) indicates conserved/semiconserved residues of the GLTP fold. Key recognition center residues (Fig. 2b, blue letters) identify five conserved positions in the GSL-specific subfamily and five conserved positions in the C1P-specific subfamily, four of which coincide in both subfamilies. Together they define the basic six-point pattern for the recognition center in the GLTP fold, with spatial templates DNKxWH and DKxRRH (where x indicates a nonconserved residue) characterizing the GSL-specific and C1P-specific families, respectively (Figs. 1b and 2b). The conserved recognition center templates for each subfamily suggest that specificity variations within a subfamily are controlled by other elements. Global comparisons (Fig. 2a and Fig. S1a) identify variable elements of the GLTP-fold including the “nonalignable” (Fig. 2b) loop L3/4 that differs among each member of the GLTP family. Also evident are three previously unrecognized but conserved interaction sites (Fig. 2a, labeled in orange as 1, 2, and 3) that are presumably important for GLTP-fold function. The differing structural features of the L3/4 loop in FAPP2–GLTPH and other subfamily members are shown in Fig. 2a, whereas the variability of L3/4-loop length and sequence for each GLTP superfamily member can be appreciated in Fig. 2b (red box). Significant differences in L3/4-loop conformations in the GSL-specific subfamily and in the GLTP superfamily are highlighted in stereo mode in Fig. 3 (a and b, respectively). Because each L3/4 loop is unique, we refer to it as the “ID loop,” i.e. individual or identification loop. What makes the ID loop special compared with other helix–helix connectors is that each loop end interacts with each other to generate a pinched-together “clasp-like” structure (Fig. 2a, linkage 1). In FAPP2–GLTPH, this clasp is secured by an H-bond triplet (Fig. 4a, shaded area) formed by the side-chain carboxyl of Glu389, located in the C-terminal region of α3-helix, and two consecutive main-chain NH-groups (401 and 402) plus a side-chain hydroxyl (Thr402), grouped at the N terminus of α4-helix. Glu389 provides three acceptor vacancies for the triplet, whereas the partners from α4-helix provide three H-bond donors. The same H-bond triplet pattern, involving the same residues at the same locations, connects the ends of helices 3 and 4 in GLTP (Fig. 4b, shaded area) and is strictly conserved in other GSL-specific GLTP superfamily members (Fig. 4c). Moreover, as illustrated in Fig. 4d, the interaction that “locks” the ID loop persists in the C1P-specific subfamily, although Glu is replaced by Asp in ACD11 and Thr is replaced by Cys in CPTP. Regardless, the fastener for the ID loop remains intact, albeit with minor modifications (Fig. 4d). Thus, the ID-loop clasp is a conserved feature of the GLTP fold that endows the ID loop with relative structural autonomy and rigidity. Examination of the ID-loop structural details in FAPP2–GLTPH shows that the “loop body” is stabilized via a network of tight intraloop interactions involving main-chain hydrogen bonding and van der Waals contacts of side chains (Fig. 4a). The interactions span the entire loop and rigidify its conformation. In GLTP, the ID loop also maintains conformational rigidity by a system of intraloop interactions encompassing the entire loop body (Fig. 4b). Further support for the ID-loop rigidity arises from the very similar backbone conformations observed by superposition of different molecular structures available for GLTP (20 molecules; Fig. 4e), ACD11 (12 molecules; Fig. 4f), and CPTP (15 molecules; Fig. 4g). Although each protein backbone displays some conformational mobility (Fig. 4, e–g), the variations are less than those observed for most loops (e.g. see Fig. 7a). Even though the ID loops are longer, on average, in C1P-specific members ACD11 and CPTP than those in GSL-specific members (Fig. 2b), the similar conformations found in 12 different ACD11 molecules and 15 different CPTP molecules strongly support the relative rigidity of these ID loops (Fig. 4, f and g). We conclude that ID-loop conformations differ among superfamily members, but each ID loop is relatively rigid. Taken together, these data support the importance of the ID loop in the GLTP fold. Previous functional analyses show very different transfer activity by FAPP2–GLTPH for simple versus complex GSLs (2Kamlekar R.K. Simanshu D.K. Gao Y.G. Kenoth R. Pike H.M. Prendergast F.G.

Compared with GalCer and GlcCer, LacCer transfer efficiency declines by ∼50%, whereas transfer of SF and ganglioside GM1 is quite low. By contrast, GLTP efficiently transfers both simple and complex GSLs, including GalCer, GlcCer, LacCer, gangliosides, and sulfatides (17Brown R.E. Mattjus P. Glycolipid transfer proteins.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1771: 746-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 18Mattjus P. Specificity of the mammalian glycolipid transfer proteins.Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2016; 194: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The ID-loop location behind the bound GSL headgroup (Figs. 2a and 5, a and d) suggests a potential regulatory role (negative or positive) in binding GSLs containing more than one sugar. Compared with GLTP, the main chain of the FAPP2 ID loop (especially Arg398 and Asn399) protrudes toward the GSL (Fig. 4h), where it can potentially interfere with complex headgroup binding, thereby limiting functional selectivity of FAPP2 to simple GSLs. To test the idea, we modeled the FAPP2·LacCer and FAPP2·SF complexes by superposition of the current crystal structure with GLTP·18:1-LacCer (PDB code 1SX6) and GLTP·3-O-SF (PDB code 3RZN and 4H2Z). In Fig. 5 (b, c, e, and f), the protein molecule is represented by FAPP2–GLTPH domain from the current crystal structure, but GalCer is replaced by LacCer or SF from the superimposed GLTP complexes. Because the ID loop is rigid, such models allow one to assess whether the loop and the GSL headgroup will collide in the potential complexes. For reference, the original structure of FAPP2–GLTPH·GalCer is shown in Fig. 5 (a and d). The protruding region of FAPP2 ID loop (R398 and N399 in Fig. 5, a–c) resembles a wall behind the GSL-sugars. The nearby Lys367 residue of α2-helix forms an H-bond with bound galactose (Fig. 5d). Accordingly, Lys367 projects inward in similar fashion to Lys55 in GLTP·GalCer complexes. The bound galactose is too far from the ID loop to be affected by nearby “wall” components, Asn399 and Arg398 (Fig. 5, a and d). However, in the modeled FAPP2–GLTPH·LacCer complex (Fig. 5, b and e), the second sugar ring of lactose moderately clashes against the wall. When GSLs have more than two headgroup sugars (e.g. gangliosides, globosides), serious interference by this wall effect is expected to significantly diminish GSL binding. This finding is consistent with functional data showing low transfer activity of FAPP2–GLTPH for ganglioside GM1 compared with GLTP (2Kamlekar R.K. Simanshu D.K. Gao Y.G. Kenoth R. Pike H.M.

Because the recognition center residues target mostly the initial sugar, binding of more complex heads is expected to involve additional nearby favorable interactions. Otherwise, the binding efficiency would decrease because of the increased size and complexity of the headgroup. Based on the favorable GM1 transfer by human GLTP (13Kenoth R. Simanshu D.K.

This signaling pathway requires a critical caspase recruitment domain (CARD)–CARD interaction between CARD9 and Bcl10 that promotes downstream activation of factors, including NF-κB and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38. Despite these insights, CARD9 remains structurally uncharacterized, and little mechanistic understanding of its regulation exists. We unexpectedly found here that the CARD in CARD9 binds to Zn2+ with picomolar affinity—a concentration comparable with the levels of readily accessible Zn2+ in the cytosol. NMR solution structures of the CARD9–CARD in the apo and Zn2+-bound states revealed that Zn2+ has little effect on the ground-state structure of the CARD; yet the stability of the domain increased considerably upon Zn2+ binding, with a concomitant reduction in conformational flexibility. Moreover, Zn2+ binding inhibited polymerization of the CARD9–CARD into helical assemblies. Here, we also present a 20-Å resolution negative-stain EM (NS-EM) structure of these filamentous assemblies and show that they adopt a similar helical symmetry as reported previously for filaments of the Bcl10 CARD. Using both bulk assays and direct NS-EM visualization, we further show that the CARD9–CARD assemblies can directly template and thereby nucleate Bcl10 polymerization, a capacity considered critical to propagation of the CARD9–Bcl10 signaling cascade.

Mutations in imprinted regions have been involved in diseases showing parent of origin effects. Identifying genes with evidence of parent of origin expression patterns in family studies allows the detection of more subtle imprinting. Here, we use allele specific expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines from 306 Hutterites related in a single pedigree to provide formal evidence for parent of origin effects. We take advantage of phased genotype data to assign parent of origin to RNA-seq reads in individuals with gene expression data. Our approach identified known imprinted genes, two putative novel imprinted genes, PXDC1 and PWAR6, and 14 genes with asymmetrical parent of origin gene expression. We used gene expression in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) to validate our findings, and then confirmed imprinting control regions (ICRs) using DNA methylation levels in the PBLs."

We explored alterations of the oral microbiome in Chinese Han CFS patients using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and alterations in the functional potential of the oral microbiome using PICRUSt. We found that Shannon and Simpson diversity indices were not different in CFS patients compared to healthy controls, but the overall oral microbiome composition was different (MANOVA, p < 0.01). CFS patients had a higher relative abundance of Fusobacteria compared with healthy controls. Further, the genera Leptotrichia, Prevotella, and Fusobacterium were enriched and Haemophilus, Veillonella, and Porphyromonas were depleted in CFS patients compared to healthy controls. Functional analysis from inferred metagenomes showed that bacterial genera altered in CFS patients were primarily associated with amino acid and energy metabolism. Our findings demonstrate that the oral microbiome in CFS patients is different from healthy controls, and these differences lead to shifts in functional pathways with implications for CFS pathogenesis. These findings increase our understanding of the relationship between the oral microbiota and CFS, which will advance our understanding of CFS pathogenesis and may contribute to future improvements in treatment and diagnosis."

Aggregates of PBMCs were initially observed on day 3 and the size of aggregates continued to increase on day 8 post-infection, where macrophages and T cell subsets were identified to be present. Similarly, mycobacterial load progressively increased in infected PBMCs during the 8 days of culture but were significantly lower in infected PBMCs from BCG vaccinated (BCG+) donors compared to unvaccinated (BCG-) donors. The levels of INF-γ, TNF-α, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-17 in the supernatants of Mtb-infected PBMCs peaked at day 3 and decreased on days 5 and 8. The levels of these cytokines except IL-10 were significantly lower in Mtb-infected PBMCs from BCG+ donors compared to infected PBMCs from BCG- donors. The percentages of activated naïve Th cells, activated effector memory Th cells and activated central memory Tc cells were significantly higher in Mtb-infected PBMCs compared to uninfected PBMCs at day 8 post-infection. Further, the proportion of activated central memory Tc cells was significantly higher in infected PBMCs from BCG+ donors compared to the BCG- donors. This study highlights the possibility that BCG vaccination may confound results that utilize human PBMCs to study Mtb infection."

Here, we investigated the potential role of the angiotensin II (Ang II)/AT1 receptor pathway in the development of MAKI. We used C57BL/6 mice infected by Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA-infected mice), a well-known murine model of severe malaria. The animals were treated with 20 mg/kg/day losartan, an antagonist of AT1 receptor, or captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. We observed an increase in the levels of plasma creatinine and blood urea nitrogen associated with a significant decrease in creatinine clearance, a marker of glomerular flow rate, and glomerular hypercellularity, indicating glomerular injury. PbA-infected mice also presented proteinuria and a high level of urinary γ-glutamyltransferase activity associated with an increase in collagen deposition and interstitial space, showing tubule-interstitial injury. PbA-infected mice were also found to have increased fractional excretion of sodium (FENa+) coupled with decreased cortical (Na++K+)ATPase activity. These injuries were associated with an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, interleukin-17, and interferon gamma, in the renal cortex of PbA-infected mice. All modifications of these structural, biochemical, and functional parameters observed in PbA-infected mice were avoided with simultaneous treatment with losartan or captopril. Our data allow us to postulate that the Ang II/AT1 receptor pathway mediates an increase in renal pro-inflammatory cytokines, which in turn leads to the glomerular and tubular injuries observed in MAKI."
https://openalex.org/W2891633582,"Cytochromes c are ubiquitous proteins, essential for life in most organisms. Their distinctive characteristic is the covalent attachment of heme to their polypeptide chain. This post-translational modification is performed by a dedicated protein system, which in many Gram-negative bacteria and plant mitochondria is a nine-protein apparatus (CcmA-I) called System I. Despite decades of study, mechanistic understanding of the protein-protein interactions in this highly complex maturation machinery is still lacking. Here, we focused on the interaction of CcmC, the protein that sources the heme cofactor, with CcmE, the pivotal component of System I responsible for the transfer of the heme to the apocytochrome. Using in silico analyses, we identified a putative interaction site between these two proteins (residues Asp47, Gln50, and Arg55 on CcmC; Arg73, Asp101, and Glu105 on CcmE), and we validated our findings by in vivo experiments in Escherichia coli Moreover, employing NMR spectroscopy, we examined whether a heme-binding site on CcmE contributes to this interaction and found that CcmC and CcmE associate via protein-protein rather than protein-heme contacts. The combination of in vivo site-directed mutagenesis studies and high-resolution structural techniques enabled us to determine at the residue level the mechanism for the formation of one of the key protein complexes for cytochrome c maturation by System I."
https://openalex.org/W2891888222,"Purpose This study evaluated the outcomes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with small normal liver volume (NLV) treated with proton beam therapy (PBT) and introduced estimated standard liver volume (eSLV) as a new constraint. Materials and methods HCC patients with NLV < 800 cm3 and no distant metastasis who received treatment in our proton center were included. The doses of PBT were mainly 72.6 Gray equivalents (GyE) in 22 fractions and 66 GyE in 10 fractions according to tumor locations. The Urata equation was used to calculate eSLV. Results Twenty-two patients were treated between November 2015 and December 2016. The 1-year progression-free and overall survival rates were 40.4% and 81.8%, respectively. The 1-year in-field failure-free rate was 95.5%. NLV ranged from 483.9 to 795.8 cm3 (median = 673.8 cm3), eSLV ranged from 889.3 to 1290.0 cm3 (median = 1104.5 cm3), and the resulting NLV/eSLV ratio ranged from 44.3 to 81.2% (median = 57.7%). Non-irradiated liver volume (NILV) ranged from 232.9 to 531.6 cm3 (median = 391.2 cm3). The NILV/eSLV ratio ranged from 21.2 to 48.0% (median = 33.3%). NLV in the patients who received <30 GyE (rV30) ranged from 319.1 to 633.3 cm3 (median = 488.2 cm3), and their rV30/eSLV ratio ranged from 30.7 to 58.0%. None of our patients developed liver failure. One patient with initial abnormal liver enzyme levels developed non-classic radiation-induced liver disease (RILD). Conclusion From the viewpoint of minimal liver toxicity occurring in our patients with NLV < 800 cm3, conventional liver constraints involving the use of absolute volume could not accurately predict the risk of RILD. It is reasonable to start using individualized constraints with eSLV for HCC patients undergoing PBT. According to the study results, an NILV/eSLV ratio of >20% and an rV30/eSLV ratio of >30% are acceptable."

Methods We identified 478 adult patients for this case-control study undergoing treatment for confirmed pulmonary TB. Cases (noncompliance) were defined as patients who stopped treatment for more than 30 consecutive days (n = 118). Controls were defined as all patients who completed treatment and were cured (n = 360). Factors associated with noncompliance were calculated with unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio (OR). Results The rate of noncompliance in our study was 25%. The factors of noncompliance after adjustments in the overall population were, in order of magnitude, living in an area of lower income (OR = 4.35, 95%CI: 2.50–7.58), abuse of drugs (OR = 2.73, 95%CI: 1.47–5.09), nonadherence to a previous treatment regimen (OR = 2.1, 95%CI: 1.28–3.45), and history of smoking (OR = 1.72, 95%CI: 1.00–3.00). Age, race, gender, level of education, HIV infection or diabetes status were not associated with a higher risk of noncompliance. In the subgroup of re-treatment cases, poverty (OR = 2.65; 95%CI = 1.06–6.66), smoking history (OR = 2.94; 95%CI = 1.09–7.92), male gender (OR = 3.25; 95%CI = 1.32–8.0), and younger age (OR = 4.3; 95%CI = 1.15–16.07) were also associated with a higher risk of dropout. Conclusion Predictors of poor compliance to TB treatment were low income, abuse of drugs, re-treatment cases and history of smoking."
https://openalex.org/W2890313316,"The vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (v-ATPase) is the major proton pump that acidifies intracellular compartments of eukaryotic cells. Since the inhibition of v-ATPase resulted in anti-tumor and anti-metastatic effects in different tumor models, this enzyme has emerged as promising strategy against cancer. Here, we used the well-established v-ATPase inhibitor archazolid, a natural product first isolated from the myxobacterium Archangium gephyra, to study the consequences of v-ATPase inhibition in endothelial cells (ECs), in particular on the interaction between ECs and cancer cells, which has been neglected so far. Human endothelial cells treated with archazolid showed an increased adhesion of tumor cells, whereas the transendothelial migration of tumor cells was reduced. The adhesion process was independent from the EC adhesion molecules ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin and N-cadherin. Instead, the adhesion was mediated by β1-integrins expressed on tumor cells, as blocking of the integrin β1 subunit reversed this process. Tumor cells preferentially adhered to the β1-integrin ligand collagen and archazolid led to an increase in the amount of collagen on the surface of ECs. The accumulation of collagen was accompanied by a strong decrease of the expression and activity of the protease cathepsin B. Overexpression of cathepsin B in ECs prevented the capability of archazolid to increase the adhesion of tumor cells onto ECs. Our study demonstrates that the inhibition of v-ATPase by archazolid induces a pro-adhesive phenotype in endothelial cells that promotes their interaction with cancer cells, whereas the transmigration of tumor cells was reduced. These findings further support archazolid as a promising anti-metastatic compound."

However, most standard complex network measures can hardly differentiate between co-occurence networks built from an empirical corpus and a body of scrambled text. In this work, we employ a motif extraction procedure to show that empirical networks have much greater motif densities. We demonstrate that motifs function as efficient and effective shortcuts in language networks, potentially explaining why we are able to generate and decipher language expressions so rapidly.

https://openalex.org/W2890980716,"Global agriculture and the control of insect disease vectors have developed with a heavy reliance on insecticides. The increasing incidence of resistance, for virtually all insecticides, threatens both food supply and effective control of insect borne disease. CASPP ((5-chloro-1’-[(E)-3-(4-chlorophenyl)allyl]spiro[indoline-3,4’-piperidine]-1-yl}-(2-chloro-4-pyridyl)methanone)) compounds are a potential new class of neuroactive insecticide specifically targeting the Vesicular Acetylcholine Transporter (VAChT). Resistance to CASPP, under laboratory conditions, has been reported following either up-regulation of wildtype VAChT expression or the presence of a specific point mutation (VAChTY49N). However, the underlying mechanism of CASPP-resistance, together with the consequence to insect viability of achieving resistance, is unknown. In this study, we use electrophysiological characterisation of cholinergic release at Drosophila larval interneuron→motoneuron synapses to investigate the physiological implications of these two identified modes of CASPP resistance. We show that both VAChT up-regulation or the expression of VAChTY49N increases miniature (mini) release frequency. Mini frequency appears deterministic of CASPP activity. However, maintenance of SV release is not indicative of resistance in all cases. This is evidenced through expression of syntaxin or complexin mutants (sytx3-61/cpxSH1) that show similarly high mini release frequency but are not resistant to CASPP. The VAChTY49N mutation additionally disrupts action potential-evoked cholinergic release and fictive locomotor patterning through depletion of releasable synaptic vesicles. This observation suggests a functional trade-off for this point mutation, which is not seen when wildtype VAChT is up-regulated."
https://openalex.org/W2889668980,"There is worldwide concern about the status of elasmobranchs, primarily as a result of overfishing and bycatch with subsequent ecosystem effects following the removal of top predators. Whilst abundant and wide-ranging, blue sharks (Prionace glauca) are the most heavily exploited shark species having suffered marked declines over the past decades, and there is a call for robust abundance estimates. In this study, we utilized depth data collected from two blue sharks using pop-up satellite archival tags, and modelled the proportion of time the sharks were swimming in the top 1-meter layer and could therefore be detected by observers conducting aerial surveys. The availability models indicated that the tagged sharks preferred surface waters whilst swimming over the continental shelf and during daytime, with a model-predicted average proportion of time spent at the surface of 0.633 (SD = 0.094) for on-shelf, and 0.136 (SD = 0.075) for off-shelf. These predicted values were then used to account for availability bias in abundance estimates for the species over a large area in the Northeast Atlantic, derived through distance sampling using aerial survey data collected in 2015 and 2016 and modelled with density surface models. Further, we compared abundance estimates corrected with model-predicted availability to uncorrected estimates and to estimates that incorporated the average time the sharks were available for detection. The mean abundance (number of individuals) corrected with modelled availability was 15,320 (CV = 0.28) in 2015 and 11,001 (CV = 0.27) in 2016. Depending on the year, these estimates were ~7 times higher compared to estimates without the bias correction, and ~3 times higher compared to the abundances corrected with average availability. When the survey area contains habitat heterogeneity that may affect surfacing patterns of animals, modelling animals' availability provides a robust alternative to correcting for availability bias and highlights the need for caution when applying ""average"" correction factors."
https://openalex.org/W2890784288,"Objective The overall aim of this paper is to examine effectiveness of an evidence-based intervention in community settings, and the factors associated with effectiveness. Limited research in the area of HIV prevention has focused on evaluating intervention program effectiveness in real-world settings. Methods We implemented an efficacious theory-based sexual risk reduction intervention for female sex workers (FSW) called Mujer Segura across 13 different clinics in 13 sites across Mexico. The overall design was a cluster randomized Type I design simultaneously testing intervention program effectiveness with an observational study of implementation factors. We aimed to examine the effectiveness of Mujer Segura at reducing HIV/STI incidence among FSW participants at each site, and to examine the client-, provider-, organization-, and structure-related factors associated with program effectiveness. Results We found lower HIV/STI incidence density in the intervention relative to the control group in 5 sites we labeled as “program effective sites,” but not in 8 sites we labeled as “program ineffective sites.” Using generalized estimating equations controlling for site and computed mean difference effect sizes, we examined statistically and practically significant differences, respectively, between the two groups of sites along various client-, provider-, organization-, and structure-related characteristics. Results indicated that client-level HIV/AIDS related knowledge, and proficiency and engagement in the organizational social context were associated with program effectiveness. Conclusions Enormous resources are required to systematically and adequately test the role of multilevel factors on program effectiveness. We successfully implemented Mujer Segura in 13 sites in Mexico. Results suggest that other measures may need to be included in future implementation studies than the ones included here. We were able to point to a few specific factors that should be targeted to increase effectiveness of similar evidence-based programs in low- and other middle-income countries like Mexico.

https://openalex.org/W2890492990,"Background Shared zones are characterised by an absence of traditional markers that segregate the road and footpath. Negotiation of a shared zone relies on an individual’s ability to perceive, assess and respond to environmental cues. This ability may be impacted by impairments in cognitive processing, which may lead to individuals experiencing increased anxiety when negotiating a shared zone. Method Q method was used in order to identify and explore the viewpoints of pedestrians, with and without cognitive impairments as they pertain to shared zones. Results Two viewpoints were revealed. Viewpoint one was defined by “confident users” while viewpoint two was defined by users who “know what [they] are doing but drivers might not”. Discussion Overall, participants in the study would not avoid shared zones. Pedestrians with intellectual disability were, however, not well represented by either viewpoint, suggesting that shared zones may pose a potential barrier to participation for this group."
https://openalex.org/W2891379466,"Background In high-income countries delivery usually takes place in a short-stay hospital setting and includes limited specific care after discharge. Perinatal system performance is therefore predominantly expressed in direct terms of delivery outcomes such as preterm birth (PTB), small for gestational age (SGA) or, in case of the mother, perineal rupture and haemorrhage. Additional postnatal complications may emerge, but their incidence is largely unknown. The Dutch obstetric system includes an 8–10 day episode of professional postnatal home maternity care. Our aim was to establish, under routine conditions, the incidence of a comprehensive set of 67 predefined complications and their predictors. A second aim was to address interaction between maternal and child complications. Methods The study design was a prospective cohort study of all clients of one large maternity care organization receiving home maternity care in November 2014. We combined maternal background and intrapartum and postnatal characteristics with complication data, routinely recorded by home maternity care assistants. Complication prevalence rates per postnatal day were calculated. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression were used to predict the presence of postnatal complications. Results Complications occurred throughout the entire episode of home maternity care and prevalence was high, with 55% of all mother-baby pairs experiencing at least one complication (e.g. cracked nipples, >10% weight loss of the baby) and 5% at least one major complication (e.g. mastitis, cyanosis of the baby). Predictive ability of maternal background and intrapartum and postnatal variables on presence of complications was moderate (max. 62.9%), even when a cumulative risk score was used. Conclusions The prevalence rates of maternal and neonatal postnatal complications with care as usual in high-income countries was higher than expected. Professional postnatal follow-up is to be considered in order to timely detect and manage emerging complications with minimal delay. Opportunities for risk-guided care should be investigated further. The pattern of complications in low-income countries remains to be established."

However, clinical practice within Ethiopia has continued to recommend all drugs for treatment of hypertension despite the lack of evidentiary support. Therefore this study aims to compare the effectiveness of the three major antihypertensive drugs currently prescribed in an Ethiopian health care setting to further the potential for evidence based prescribing practices.A prospective, randomized, open label comparative study was used to determine the mean reduction in blood pressure (primary outcome) and assess cardiovascular events (secondary outcomes) among patients receiving one or more of three common antihypertensive drugs (i.e., nifedipine, hydrochlorothiazide, and enalapril) in routine clinical practice between November 2016 and April 2017. Patients were followed for three months. Analysis was based on an intention-to-treat approach. One way analysis of covariance was used to compare the difference in therapeutic effectiveness in reducing blood pressure.A total of 141 patients were randomized to one of three recipient groups-nifedipine (n = 47), enalapril (n = 47) or hydrochlorothiazide (n = 47). Three months after randomization, 44 patients in each group completed the follow-up. Patients randomized to nifedipine had significantly higher mean reduction in systolic blood pressure than those randomized to enalapril(p = 0.003) or hydrochlorothiazide(p = 0.036). The mean reduction in systolic blood pressure was -37.35(CI:-40, -34.2) in the nifedipine group; -30.3(CI: -33.5, -27.1) in patients receiving enalapril; and -32.1(CI:-35, -29.3) in patients assigned hydrochlorothiazide. However, nifedipine did not have a significance difference in reduction of mean diastolic blood pressure compared than those receiving enalapril (p = 0.57) or hydrochlorthiazide (p = 0.99).This study revealed that amongst the three drugs nifedipine was found to be the most effective drug in reduction of systolic blood pressure. Hydrochlorothiazide and enalapril did not show a difference in reduction of mean blood pressure. Further, long term randomized trials are highly recommended to inform revision of Ethiopia-centric hypertension treatment guidelines."
https://openalex.org/W2891611006,"Allogrooming is a key aspect of chimpanzee sociality and many studies have investigated the role of reciprocity in a biological market. One theoretical form of reciprocity is time-matching, where payback consists of an equal duration of effort (e.g. twenty seconds of grooming repaid with twenty seconds of grooming). Here, we report a study of allogrooming in a group of twenty-six captive chimpanzees (Chester Zoo, UK), based on more than 150 hours of data. For analysis, we introduce a methodological innovation called the “Delta scale”, which unidimensionally measures the accuracy of time-matching according to the extent of delay after the cessation of grooming. Delta is positive when reciprocation occurs after any non-zero delay (e.g. A grooms B and then B grooms A after a five second break) and it is negative when reciprocation begins whilst the original grooming has not yet ceased. Using a generalized linear mixed-method, we found evidence for time-matched reciprocation. However, this was true only for immediate reciprocation (Delta less than zero). If there was a temporal break in grooming between two members of a dyad, then there was no evidence that chimpanzees were using new bouts to retroactively correct for time-matching imbalances from previous bouts. Our results have implications for some of the cognitive constraints that differentiate real-life reciprocation from abstract theoretical models. Furthermore, we suggest that some apparent patterns of time-matched reciprocity may arise merely due to the law of large numbers, and we introduce a statistical test which takes this into account when aggregating grooming durations over a window of time."
https://openalex.org/W2952838651,"Hypersaline photosynthetic microbial mats are stratified microbial communities known for their taxonomic and metabolic diversity and strong light-driven day-night environmental gradients. In this study of the upper photosynthetic zone of hypersaline microbial mats of Elkhorn Slough, California (USA), we show how metagenome sequencing can be used to meaningfully assess microbial ecology and genetic partitioning in these complex microbial systems. Mapping of metagenome reads to the dominant Cyanobacteria observed in the system, Coleofasciculus (Microcoleus) chthonoplastes, was used to examine strain variants within these metagenomes. Highly conserved gene subsystems indicated a core genome for the species, and a number of variant genes and subsystems suggested strain level differentiation, especially for nutrient utilization and stress response. Metagenome sequence coverage binning was used to assess ecosystem partitioning of remaining microbes to both reconstruct the model organisms in silico and identify their ecosystem functions as well as to identify novel clades and propose their role in the biogeochemical cycling of mats. Functional gene annotation of these bins (primarily of Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Cyanobacteria) recapitulated the known biogeochemical functions in microbial mats using a genetic basis, and revealed significant diversity in the Bacteroidetes, presumably in heterotrophic cycling. This analysis also revealed evidence of putative phototrophs within the Gemmatimonadetes and Gammaproteobacteria residing in microbial mats. This study shows that metagenomic analysis can produce insights into the systems biology of microbial ecosystems from a genetic perspective and to suggest further studies of novel microbes."
https://openalex.org/W2556052887,"Several modern genomic technologies, such as DNA-Methylation arrays, measure spatially registered probes that number in the hundreds of thousands across multiple chromosomes. The measured probes are by themselves less interesting scientifically; instead scientists seek to discover biologically interpretable genomic regions comprised of contiguous groups of probes which may act as biomarkers of disease or serve as a dimension-reducing pre-processing step for downstream analyses. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised feature learning technique which maps technological units (probes) to biological units (genomic regions) that are common across all subjects. We use ideas from fusion penalties and convex clustering to introduce a method for Spatial Convex Clustering, or SpaCC. Our method is specifically tailored to detecting multi-subject regions of methylation, but we also test our approach on the well-studied problem of detecting segments of copy number variation. We formulate our method as a convex optimization problem, develop a massively parallelizable algorithm to find its solution, and introduce automated approaches for handling missing values and determining tuning parameters. Through simulation studies based on real methylation and copy number variation data, we show that SpaCC exhibits significant performance gains relative to existing methods. Finally, we illustrate SpaCC’s advantages as a pre-processing technique that reduces large-scale genomics data into a smaller number of genomic regions through several cancer epigenetics case studies on subtype discovery, network estimation, and epigenetic-wide association."
https://openalex.org/W2889585575,"While many studies on tribal water resources of individual tribal lands in the United States (US) have been conducted, the importance of tribal water resources at a national scale has largely gone unrecognized because their combined totals have not been quantified. Thus, we sought to provide a numerical estimate of major water budget components on tribal lands within the conterminous US and on USGS hydrologic unit codes (HUC2) regions. Using existing national-scale data and models, we estimated mean annual precipitation, evapotranspiration, excess precipitation, streamflow, and water use for the period 1971–2000. Tribal lands represent about 3.4 percent of the total land area of the conterminous US and on average account for 1.9 percent of precipitation, 2.4 percent of actual evapotranspiration, 0.95 percent of excess precipitation, 1.6 percent of water use, and 0.43 percent of streamflow origination. Additionally, approximately 9.5 and 11.3 percent of US streamflow flows through or adjacent as boundaries to tribal lands, respectively. Streamflow through or adjacent to tribal lands accounts for 42 and 48 percent of streamflow in the Missouri region, respectively; and for 86 and 88 percent in the Lower Colorado region, respectively. On average, 5,600 million cubic meters of streamflow per year was produced on tribal lands in the Pacific Northwest region, nearly five times greater than tribal lands in any other region. Tribal lands in the Great Lakes, Missouri, Arkansas-White-Red, and California regions all produced between 1,000 and 1,400 million cubic meters per year."
https://openalex.org/W2891236047,"There are multiple organisations in Russia that publish clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). The demand for CPGs and appreciation of their role in healthcare provision has been steadily growing. However, quality and methodology of development of CPGs have not been systematically addressed.To analyse the quality of Russian-produced CPGs for surgical treatment of hepatic-pancreatic-biliary diseases.We searched Russian databases for CPGs, published between 2013 and 2017. We identified 6 relevant documents that met our inclusion criteria. We approached four experts in the field with written and verbal instructions on the use of the AGREE II questionnaire.All six CPGs received the highest domain scores for the domain Clarity of Presentation (46%-80%). The lowest domain scores were for the domain Editorial Independence (6%-25%). Overall, the experts put the highest total sum scores to the CPG for treating chronic pancreatitis (70%), while the lowest total sum score was attributed to the CPG for treating acute cholangitis (22%).The overall quality of CPGs, as assessed by the four experts with the AGREE II instrument, was low. The highest scoring, best organized and most comprehensive and straightforward CPG was the one for chronic pancreatitis. The AGREE II instrument should be considered for use in Russia by guideline developers to assess existing CPGs and inform the creation of new guidelines."
https://openalex.org/W2890845148,"The quantity of the intra-erythrocytic deoxyhemoglobin S (Hb S) affects the level of protection against malaria and also the sickling phenomenon. This study reports on significantly lower concentration of Hb S in females than males. Data came from 350 children, aged 12-47 months who participated in a phase 2b malaria vaccine trial. Hemoglobinopathy and G6PD deficiency typing was necessary to ascertain equal representation of these malaria protective traits across the vaccine cohorts. Hemoglobin types (HbAA, HbAS) and % Hb S were evaluated by HPLC. Alpha thalassemia (alpha-thal) and G6PD genotypes were evaluated by PCR. The overall prevalence for HbAS was 20%, 46% for 3 alpha genes and 10% for 2 alpha genes and 14% for G6PD A-. More females of HbAS/αα/αα genotype had low Hb S than males and had mean % Hb S of 37.5% ± 5.4 SD, compared to 42.0% ± 2.5 SD in males of same genotype (P = 0.018). Consistent with reduction of the malaria protective Hb S in females, parasite load in females was nearly twice that of males but the difference was not statistically significant. The X-chromosome linked G6PD deficiency did not influence the level of Hb S. We conclude that, the low Hb S in these females explains the resultant higher malaria parasite load. We speculate that the low Hb S in females could also explain observations suggesting that the sickling phenomenon tends to be less severe in females than males."
