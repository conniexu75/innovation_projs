https://openalex.org/W2063321453,"Diatoms are the major contributors to phytoplankton blooms in lakes and in the sea and hence are central in aquatic ecosystems and the global carbon cycle. All free-living diatoms differ from other phytoplankton groups in having silicified cell walls in the form of two 'shells' (the frustule) of manifold shape and intricate architecture whose function and role, if any, in contributing to the evolutionary success of diatoms is under debate. We explored the defence potential of the frustules as armour against predators by measuring their strength. Real and virtual loading tests (using calibrated glass microneedles and finite element analysis) were performed on centric and pennate diatom cells. Here we show that the frustules are remarkably strong by virtue of their architecture and the material properties of the diatom silica. We conclude that diatom frustules have evolved as mechanical protection for the cells because exceptional force is required to break them. The evolutionary arms race between diatoms and their specialized predators will have had considerable influence in structuring pelagic food webs and biogeochemical cycles."
https://openalex.org/W2046251754,"A practical quantum computer1, if built, would consist of a set of coupled two-level quantum systems (qubits). Among the variety of qubits implemented2, solid-state qubits are of particular interest because of their potential suitability for integrated devices. A variety of qubits based on Josephson junctions3,4 have been implemented5,6,7,8; these exploit the coherence of Cooper-pair tunnelling in the superconducting state5,6,7,8,9,10. Despite apparent progress in the implementation of individual solid-state qubits, there have been no experimental reports of multiple qubit gates—a basic requirement for building a real quantum computer. Here we demonstrate a Josephson circuit consisting of two coupled charge qubits. Using a pulse technique, we coherently mix quantum states and observe quantum oscillations, the spectrum of which reflects interaction between the qubits. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of coupling multiple solid-state qubits, and indicate the existence of entangled two-qubit states."

https://openalex.org/W2051803953,"Spectroscopic measurements with increasingly higher time resolution are generally thought to require increasingly shorter laser pulses, as illustrated by the recent monitoring of the decay of core-excited krypton using attosecond photon pulses. However, an alternative approach to probing ultrafast dynamic processes might be provided by entanglement, which has improved the precision of quantum optical measurements. Here we use this approach to observe the motion of a D2+ vibrational wave packet formed during the multiphoton ionization of D2 over several femtoseconds with a precision of about 200 attoseconds and 0.05 ångströms, by exploiting the correlation between the electronic and nuclear wave packets formed during the ionization event. An intense infrared laser field drives the electron wave packet, and electron recollision probes the nuclear motion. Our results show that laser pulse duration need not limit the time resolution of a spectroscopic measurement, provided the process studied involves the formation of correlated wave packets, one of which can be controlled; spatial resolution is likewise not limited to the focal spot size or laser wavelength."

https://openalex.org/W2016808274,"It has been rumoured1 that an unidentified decapod crustacean, a crayfish of marbled appearance and of uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid-1990s, is capable of unisexual reproduction (parthenogenesis). Here we confirm that this marbled crayfish ('Marmorkrebs') is parthenogenetic under laboratory conditions and use morphological and molecular analysis to show that it belongs to the American Cambaridae family. Although parthenogenesis is widespread among the Crustacea2, and shrimp, lobsters, crayfish and crabs are otherwise versatile in their modes of reproduction3,4,5, it has not been reported before in decapods, the largest and economically most important crustacean group. By virtue of its parthenogenetic reproduction, the marbled crayfish emerges not only as an interesting laboratory model but also as a potential ecological threat in that it could outcompete native forms should even a single specimen be released into European lakes and rivers."
https://openalex.org/W2037574965,"Although the nitric oxide (⋅NO)-mediated nitrosation of thiol-containing molecules is increasingly recognized as an important post-translational modification in cell signaling and pathology, little is known about the factors that govern this processin vivo. In the present study, we examined the chemical pathways of nitrosothiol (RSNO) production at low micromolar concentrations of ⋅NO. Our results indicate that, in addition to nitrosation by the ⋅NO derivative dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3), RSNOs may be formed via intermediate one-electron oxidation of thiols, possibly mediated by nitrogen dioxide (⋅NO2), and the subsequent reaction of thiyl radicals with ⋅NO. In vitro, the formation ofS-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) from ⋅NO and excess glutathione (GSH) was accompanied by the formation of glutathione disulfide, which could not be ascribed to the secondary reaction of GSH with GSNO. Superoxide dismutase significantly increased GSNO yields and the thiyl radical trap, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO), inhibited by 45 and 98% the formation of GSNO and GSSG, respectively. Maximum nitrosation yields were obtained at an oxygen concentration of 3%, whereas higher oxygen tensions decreased GSNO and increased GSSG formation. When murine fibroblasts were exposed to exogenous ⋅NO, RSNO formation was sensitive to DMPO and oxygen tension in a manner similar to that observed with GSH alone. Our data indicate that RSNO formation is favored at oxygen concentrations that typically occur in tissues. Nitrosothiol formation in vivo depends not only on the availability of ⋅NO and O2 but also on the degree of oxidative stress by affecting the steady-state concentration of thiyl radicals.

In recent years, RSNOs have received increasing attention as intermediates in the transport, storage, and delivery of ⋅NO, as post-translational protein modifications in cell signaling and inflammatory processes, and as biochemical markers of reactive nitrogen oxide species (RNOS) (1Scharfstein J.S.

Although critical for understanding their biological roles, the mechanisms by which these⋅NO derivatives are formed in vivo are not clearly understood. Proposed pathways include the reaction of thiols with dinitrosyl-iron or nitrosylheme complexes (3Boese M. Mordvintcev P.I. Vanin A.F. Busse R. Mülsch A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29244-29249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), direct reaction of thiols with ⋅NO in the presence of an electron acceptor such as NAD+ (4Gow A.J.

Prevalence of certain reaction pathways is likely to be attained within the context of specific proteins where the immediate environment may impact on the reactivity of thiols to RNOS. An increase in hydrophobicity within the core region of a protein, for example, may result in the accumulation of ⋅NO and RNOS with a consequential acceleration of nitrosation reactions within this region (9Rafikova O. Rafikov R. Nudler E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5913-5918Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). A decrease in thiol pKa secondary to a change in the acid/base equilibrium of the surrounding amino acid residues renders thiols more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by RNOS (10Mannick J.B. Schonhoff C.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 408: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In cells, the spatial confinement of protein targets, the presence of hydrophobic domains, and the occurrence of multiple competing reactions that limit the availability of ⋅NO make it difficult to establish the quantitative contribution of the proposed chemical pathways (11Espey M.G. Miranda K.M. Thomas D.D. Wink D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30085-30091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Regardless of their contribution to overall RSNO formation, it is evident that a better understanding of the chemical principles that dictate the outcome of nitrosation reactions within cells is required to interpret the possible significance of differences in RSNO content between different organs and tissues, in particular in view of a highly reducing environment containing millimolar concentrations of glutathione (GSH) and limiting micromolar concentrations of molecular oxygen (O2) (12Wardman P. von Sonntag C. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Reactive nitrogen oxide species derived from the reaction of O2 with ⋅NO nitrosate thiols (13Wink D.A. Darbyshire J.F. Nims R.W. Saavedra J.E. Ford P.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 14Kharitonov V. Sundquist A.R. Sharma V. J. Biol.

The reaction is second order with respect to ⋅NO and first order in O2, consistent with the formation of dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3) as the nitrosating agent. 2⋅NO+O2→2⋅NO2Reaction 1 2⋅NO+2⋅NO2→2N2O3Reaction 2 N2O3+RSH→RSNO+NO2−+H+Reaction 3 The oxygen dependence of this process suggests that low O2 concentrations, which are in the range of 1 to 50 μm in most tissues (17Jones D.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 86: C663-C675Crossref Google Scholar), will greatly limit the efficacy of this reaction. The second order of Reaction 1 with regard to⋅NO also dictates that the rate of RSNO formation via Reaction 3 is controlled by the local concentration of ⋅NO and that N2O3 would form quantitatively only when the concentration of ⋅NO rises to the micromolar range (18Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1424-C1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In vivo, conditions associated with the up-regulation of the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) are accompanied by the production of such levels. In addition, the reaction of ⋅NO with O2 is accelerated several hundredfold in the interior of lipid bilayers and proteins, suggesting that hydrophobic environments in cells and tissues may favor the formation of RSNOs via this pathway (9Rafikova O. Rafikov R. Nudler E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5913-5918Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 19Liu X. Miller M.J.S. Joshi M.S. Thomas D.D. Lancaster Jr., J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2175-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Although the principles governing ⋅NO/O2-mediated nitrosation reactions have been delineated in earlier kinetic studies, the importance of nitrogen dioxide (⋅NO2) as an intermediate in the reaction of thiols with ⋅NO has been ignored. Nitrogen dioxide oxidizes thiols (Reaction 4) such as GSH with a rate constant that is approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than the rate constant for the reaction of ⋅NO2 with⋅NO (2 × 107m−1·s−1 compared with 1.1 × 109m−1·s−1 (20Huie R.E. Toxicology. 1994; 89: 193-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar,21Ford E. Hughes M.N. Wardman P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 1314-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar)). RSH+⋅NO2→RS⋅+NO2−+H+Reaction 4 Accordingly, previous studies found negligible thiol oxidation by⋅NO and O2 because upon bolus addition of authentic⋅NO the initial concentrations of ⋅NO and⋅NO2 are very high, which favor Reaction 2 and result in high RSNO yields (13Wink D.A. Darbyshire J.F. Nims R.W. Saavedra J.E. Ford P.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 15Keshive M. Singh S. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Deen W.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 988-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The reaction of excess ⋅NO with biological substrates is, however, of limited relevance for thein vivo situation. We reasoned that the slow in situ generation of ⋅NO involves rather low concentrations instead and that excess thiols can effectively compete with ⋅NO for ⋅NO2 (Reaction 4). As a consequence, thiol oxidation might be greatly increased and a fraction of RSNOs might be formed through the radical-radical combination reaction of ⋅NO with thiyl radicals (RS⋅). RS⋅+⋅NO→RSNOReaction 5 Under physiologically relevant conditions, the removal of thiyl radicals occurs through either geminate recombination or reaction with O2 and thiolates (12Wardman P. von Sonntag C. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Consequently, Reaction 5 directly competes with Reactions 6–9. RS⋅+RS⋅→RSSRReaction 6 RS⋅+O2↔RSOO⋅Reaction 7 RS⋅+RS−↔RSSR⨪Reaction 8 RSSR⨪+O2→RSSR+O2⨪Reaction 9 In the presence of ambient O2 and excess thiol, Reaction 8 dominates because of the rapid removal of the disulfide radical anion (RSSR⨪) via Reaction 9 (12Wardman P. von Sonntag C. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The effect of different O2 concentrations on RSNO yields at low⋅NO fluxes is unknown. It may be expected that lower, physiologically relevant O2 tensions will affect the relative amounts of oxidized and nitrosated products not only by reducing the amount of ⋅NO2 formed but also by limiting the impact of O2 on thiyl radical consumption. Here, we present evidence that the nitrosation of thiols by ⋅NO, both in vitro and in intact cells, occurs via the intermediate oxidation of thiols by ⋅NO2 and subsequent reaction of the thiyl radical with impact of O2NO. Under either condition, RSNO formation was maximal at low, physiologically relevant oxygen tension. The apparent discrepancy between the present results and those obtained in previous studies can be understood by taking into consideration the competition between ⋅NO and thiols for⋅NO2. Spermine NONOate (Sper/NO) was obtained from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. In a typical experiment, a 1-ml reaction volume containing 1 mm GSH, 100 μm DTPA, and either authentic ⋅NO or the⋅NO donor Sper/NO at the indicated concentration was incubated at 37 °C in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). At the indicated time, the sample was diluted 1:2 (v/v) with ice-cold buffer containing 10 mm K2HPO4, and 10 mm tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate in acetonitrile-water (5:95, v/v, pH 7.0) and immediately analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as described below. Stock solutions of authentic ⋅NO were prepared under an inert argon atmosphere as described previously (22Feelisch M. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1991; 17: S25-S33Crossref Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 23Archer S.L. Shultz P.J. Warren J.B. Hampl V. DeMaster E.G. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1995; 7: 21-34Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, the solutions were degassed with argon scrubbed from traces of O2. They were then bubbled with ⋅NO gas that was purified by passage through a 5 m NaOH solution. The resulting ⋅NO solutions were maintained in septum-sealed glass containers; the⋅NO concentration was typically 1.5 ± 0.3 mmas determined electrochemically using an ⋅NO-specific electrode (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). The ⋅NO donor solutions were prepared each day as 10 mm stock solutions in ice-cold 10 mm NaOH and stored on ice until use. The initial rate of ⋅NO generation via decomposition of Sper/NO at 37 °C and pH 7.4 was determined electrochemically. In some instances, the rate of Sper/NO decomposition was determined directly by measuring the decrease in absorbance at 250 nm (24Maragos C.M. Morley D. Wink D.A. Dunams T.M. Saavedra J.E. Hoffman A. Bove A.A. Isaac L. Hrabie J.A. Keefer L.K. J. Med. Chem. 1991; 34: 3242-3247Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). For some experiments, 10-ml solutions of GSH (1 mm) in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and 100 μm DTPA were purged with argon in septum-sealed vials. Saturated solutions of O2, prepared by equilibration of water with 100% oxygen, were added to each vial using gas tight syringes to obtain final oxygen tensions of 1, 3, 21, and 50%. 100 μl of a 10 mm stock solution of argon purged Sper/NO was then injected into each reaction solution using a gas-tight syringe. After a 60-min incubation at 37 °C, the solutions were diluted 1:2 (v/v) with ice-cold HPLC eluent and immediately analyzed by HPLC as described below. The products obtained from the reaction with ⋅NO in oxygenated solutions were analyzed by ion-pairing HPLC as described previously (25Tsikas D. Denker K. Frölich J.C. J. Chromatogr. A. 2001; 915: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Samples were injected onto a 250 × 4.6 mm 5-μm octadecyl silane C18 ultrasphere column (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) isocratically running at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with 10 mmK2HPO4, 10 mm tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate in acetonitrile-water (5:95, v/v, pH 7.0). The reaction products of GSH were detected at 210 nm, and the identity of each peak was confirmed by co-elution with authentic standards. Oxygen consumption was measured polarographically using a Cole-Parmer oximeter fitted with a water-jacketed Clark-type electrode (YSI model 5300), calibrated with air-saturated distilled water. All experiments were carried out at 37 °C in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer containing 0.1 mm DTPA. The mouse fibroblast cell line NIH 3T3 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were maintained in 75-cm2 culture flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). For experimentation, NIH 3T3 cells were seeded in 25 cm2 flasks and grown to 80% confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% (v/v) calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Before incubation with the⋅NO donor, cell culture media were replaced with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% serum, and the flasks were preincubated for 2 h in humidified atmosphere equilibrated with different O2/nitrogen/CO2 gas mixtures, resulting in final O2 tensions of 1, 3, 21, and 50%. The cells were then incubated with argon-purged Sper/NO for 1 h at 37 °C. Cell viability was not affected by any of the treatments as tested by trypan blue exclusion (data not shown). Treated cells were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 100 μm DTPA. The cells were detached with trypsin-EDTA, collected by centrifugation, counted, and resuspended in 1 ml of 4 mm phosphate buffer containing 100 μm DTPA. Cell suspensions were homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer. Eight hundred microliters of each homogenate were transferred to a glass tube containing 100 μl of 100 mm N-ethylmaleimide. The samples were kept on ice and in the dark for 15 min before the addition of 100 μl of 100 mm sulfanilamide and were then incubated for another 15 min on ice. RSNO formation was evaluated by measuring the amount of⋅NO liberated after reductive decomposition of theS-nitrosothiols in a purge vessel as described previously (26Feelisch M. Rassaf T. Mnaimneh S. Singh N. Bryan N.S. Jourd'heuil D. Kelm M. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1775-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Briefly, the purge vessel contained 4.5 ml of glacial acetic acid and 500 μl of an aqueous mixture containing 450 mmpotassium iodide and 100 mm iodine. The vessel was kept at 70 °C via a water jacket, and the solution was constantly purged with nitrogen and changed every four injections. The amounts of NO evolving from the purge vessel were quantified by gas phase chemiluminescence (NOA 280, Sievers Instruments, Boulder, CO). Peak integration was performed, and the results were converted to ⋅NO concentrations using authentic ⋅NO as a standard. Calculated⋅NO concentrations were further validated using standards of authentic GSNO. For groups of three or more, the data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, and when a significant difference was suggested, the Tukey test was used as a post hoc test. Comparisons restricted to two groups were analyzed using the Student's t test. A probability value of less than 0.05 was considered a statistically significant difference. The reaction of 1 mm GSH with authentic ⋅NO (12.5–375 μm) in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4, 37 °C) equilibrated with ambient air was studied by HPLC. Glutathione, nitrite, GSSG, nitrate, and GSNO eluted in this order as confirmed by comparison with standards (Fig.1, A and B). Both GSSG and GSNO were formed upon incubation of 1 mm GSH with 375 μm⋅NO (Fig. 1 B). TableI summarizes the concentrations of GSSG, GSNO, nitrite, and nitrate formed under these conditions. For all four concentrations of ⋅NO tested, GSNO production was accompanied by GSSG formation. The latter could not be attributed to the reaction of GSH with GSNO because the incubation of authentic GSNO (50 μm) with GSH (1 mm) did not result in an increase in the GSSG concentration within the 30-min incubation period (data not shown). The amount of GSNO formed was two to three times higher than the amount of GSSG formed at the highest ⋅NO concentration tested. In contrast, the amount of GSNO recovered was two to five times lower than that of GSSG at the lowest concentration of⋅NO. These results indicate that the reaction of ⋅NO with O2 resulted in the formation of an intermediate capable of oxidizing GSH to GSSG and that high concentrations of ⋅NO could compete with GSH for this oxidant to limit GSSG formation and increase GSNO formation.Table IConcentrations of GSNO, GSSG, nitrite, and nitrate formed upon incubation of GSH with ⋅NO at ambient oxygen concentration[NO]NO2− formedNO3−formedGSSG formedGSNO formedGSNO/GSSGμmμmμmμmμm12.58.38 ± 0.752.15 ± 1.623.33 ± 1.481.18 ± 0.420.40 ± 0.2337.524.99 ± 1.153.71 ± 1.977.24 ± 0.802.34 ± 0.460.33 ± 0.10125.085.00 ± 7.148.76 ± 1.7615.86 ± 2.8017.23 ± 3.901.11 ± 0.29375.0242.11 ± 3.2313.17 ± 1.7925.80 ± 4.4459.76 ± 7.172.39 ± 0.71Reduced glutathione (GSH; 1 mm) was incubated for 30 min with various concentrations of ⋅NO in 20 mmpotassium phosphate (pH 7.4), and product formation was determined as described in the legend for Fig. 1. The concentrations are expressed as the means ± S.D. of three independent experiments. Open table in a new tab Reduced glutathione (GSH; 1 mm) was incubated for 30 min with various concentrations of ⋅NO in 20 mmpotassium phosphate (pH 7.4), and product formation was determined as described in the legend for Fig. 1. The concentrations are expressed as the means ± S.D. of three independent experiments. To further evaluate the nitrosative and oxidative chemistry associated with the reaction of ⋅NO with O2, the diazeniumdiolate Sper/NO was used as a source of ⋅NO because of its predicable rate of ⋅NO release at neutral pH (24Maragos C.M. Morley D. Wink D.A. Dunams T.M. Saavedra J.E. Hoffman A. Bove A.A. Isaac L. Hrabie J.A. Keefer L.K. J. Med. Chem. 1991; 34: 3242-3247Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). In the presence of 100 μm Sper/NO (1.2 ± 0.2 μm/min ⋅NO generated, pH 7.4), GSNO accumulation reached saturation after 90 min, whereas GSSG concentration continued to increase over the 3-h incubation period, at which time the concentration of GSSG exceeded that of GSNO by ∼400% (Fig.2 A). Again, incubation of preformed GSNO (0–50 μm) with 1 mm GSH did not result in a statistically significant increase in GSNO decomposition within the 3-hour incubation period (data not shown). Consistent with the results obtained with authentic ⋅NO, the amount of GSNO relative to GSSG increased with the rate of ⋅NO generation (Fig 2 B). Oxygen uptake was moderate during the generation of ⋅NO alone but increased in the presence of GSH (Fig.3). The addition of superoxide dismutase (SOD) to the reaction mixture increased by ∼20% the amount of GSNO formed and decreased nitrate formation by about 30% (Fig.4 A). The formation of GSSG, the increased O2 consumption, and the effect of SOD were all consistent with a redox pathway in which the thiyl radical, GS⋅, formed from the one-electron oxidation of GSH, played a central role. The thiyl radical reacts with the thiolate (GS-) of another GSH molecule to form the glutathione disulfide radical anion (GSSG⨪), which in turn reduces O2 to produce the superoxide anion (O2⨪, Reactions 6 to 9). Under our experimental conditions, O2⨪ scavenged a fraction of ⋅NO to form peroxynitrite (ONOO-/ONOOH) with a resultant decrease in the yield of GSNO and an increase in nitrate, the decomposition product of peroxynitrite. Transient formation of the glutathionyl radical GS⋅ has been shown to occur upon incubation of Sper/NO with GSH (27Pou S. Rosen G.M. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1998; 2: 1507-1512Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of GS⋅ in the formation of GSSG and GSNO under our experimental conditions, we tested the effect of the thiyl radical trap, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) (Fig. 4 B). We found that DMPO (100 mm) inhibited the formation of GSSG, GSNO, and nitrate by 98, 45, and 45%, respectively, upon incubation of 100 μm Sper/NO with 1 mm GSH for 1 h at 37 °C. The concentration of nitrite could not be determined because DMPO (100 mm) and nitrite co-eluted. These results further support the formation of GS⋅ and the occurrence of a free radical pathway for the oxidation and nitrosation of thiols at low micromolar exposure to⋅NO.Figure 4Effect of SOD and DMPO on GSSG, GSNO, nitrite, and nitrate formation. A, GSH (1 mm) was incubated for 2 h with 100 μmSper/NO in solutions equilibrated with ambient air containing 20 mm phosphate (pH 7.4), 100 μm DTPA, and 0.5 mg/ml SOD. Changes in metabolites are expressed as percentage compared with control (no SOD). The values represent the mean ± standard deviation (n = 3; *, p < 0.05 compared with control). B, GSH (1 mm) was incubated with 100 μm Sper/NO as described in A, in the presence or absence of the thiyl radical trap DMPO (100 mm).

(n = 3; *, p < 0.05 compared with control).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The availability of GS⋅ for reaction with ⋅NO might be modulated by O2 not only because the formation of⋅NO2 is an O2-dependent process but also because O2 drives the consumption of GS⋅ through its reaction with the glutathione disulfide radical with concurrent formation of O2⨪ (Reaction 9 and Ref. 12Wardman P. von Sonntag C. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested the effect of O2 tension on the reaction of⋅NO and O2 with GSH. We hypothesized that at high O2 tension, the reduction of O2 by the disulfide radical diminishes the concentration of thiyl radicals available for reaction with ⋅NO to form GSNO. Alternatively, an increased O2⨪ formation at high O2 tension might lead to a decrease in the yield of GSNO through peroxynitrite formation. We found that the amount of GSNO formed upon incubation of GSH (1 mm) with Sper/NO (100 μm) reached a maximum at 3% O2 saturation and that increasing O2 tension to 50% inhibited GSNO formation by ∼30% (compared with 3% O2; Fig.5 A). Concurrently, GSSG formation increased in a concentration-dependent manner with increasing O2 tension (Fig. 5 B). In these experiments, we verified that the rate of Sper/NO decomposition was not altered by changes in oxygen tension and that the pH of the solutions did not change upon incubation with the different gas mixtures (data not shown). To explore the relevance of these new pathways for cellular nitrosation reactions, we examined the sensitivity of RSNO formation to the free radical scavenger DMPO and to changes in oxygen tension. Mouse fibroblasts (NIH 3T3 cell line) were exposed to exogenous ⋅NO by incubation with Sper/NO at 37 °C. The cells were then processed for RSNO determination by gas phase chemiluminescence as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To ascertain that ⋅NO reaction sites were thiols, samples were examined for their sensitivity to HgCl2 and light (26Feelisch M. Rassaf T. Mnaimneh S. Singh N. Bryan N.S. Jourd'heuil D. Kelm M. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1775-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The results, illustrated in Fig.6, A and B, demonstrate that more than 75% of the signal obtained from cells exposed to ⋅NO represented RSNOs, but we also identified a mercury- and light-insensitive component of unknown identity. A concentration of 100 μm Sper/NO was utilized to establish the time course of RSNO formation from the NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Increased RSNO content was detected as early as 15 min and maximized at 60 min of exposure (Fig. 6 C). No RSNO was found when the cells were incubated with decomposed Sper/NO (data not shown). The fibroblasts were exposed for 60 min to different concentrations of Sper/NO (10–100 μm) to provide initial rates of⋅NO release ranging from ∼0.1 to 1.0 μm/min. RSNO formation was apparent upon exposure to 10 μmSper/NO and increased with increasing ⋅NO fluxes (Fig6 D). In the presence of 100 μm Sper/NO, preincubation of the cells with DMPO (10 mm) decreased cellular RSNO content by ∼45% (Fig.7 A). Maximum nitrosation occurred upon incubation of the cells with 3% O2 and was decreased by 45% (compared with the 3%) with 50% oxygen (Fig.7 B). Taken together, these results were consistent with those obtained with GSH in aqueous buffer systems, indicating that a free radical pathway may represent a relevant process for RSNO formation in cells.Figure 7Effect of DMPO and oxygen tension on RSNO content of fibroblasts exposed to exogenous ⋅NO. A, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were incubated for 30 min with the thiyl radical trap DMPO (10 mm) before treatment for 1 h with 100 μm Sper/NO. RSNO content was determined as described in the legend for Fig. 6. The values represent the means ± S.D. (n = 3; *, p < 0.05 compared with control). B, cells were preincubated for 2 h in humidified atmosphere with different O2/nitrogen/CO2 gas mixtures, resulting in a final O2 tension of 1, 3, 21, and 50%. The cells were then incubated with argon-purged Sper/NO (100 μm) for 1 h at 37 °C, and RSNO content was determined. The values represent the means ± S.D. (n = 3; *,p < 0.05 compared with control).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The reaction of ⋅NO and O2 with thiols is thought to result in thiol nitrosation through the exclusive intermediacy of dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3) formed from the combination of ⋅NO with ⋅NO2(Reaction 2; Refs. 15Keshive M.

Vitek M.P. Wink D.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 962: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In the context of the cell, however, thiols are in excess relative to ⋅NO, and a large fraction of⋅NO2 should react with thiols rather than ⋅NO itself (Reaction 4; Ref. 21Ford E. Hughes M.N. Wardman P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 1314-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). An important corollary of the trapping of⋅NO2 by thiols is the formation of oxidized products, including disulfides, through the intermediate formation of thiyl radicals (Reactions 6–8). Previous studies found negligible or no oxidation products suggesting key differences between the experimental approach and theoretical principles (13Wink D.A. Darbyshire J.F. Nims R.W. Saavedra J.E. Ford P.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 14Kharitonov V. Sundquist A.R. Sharma V. J. Biol.

Toxicol. 1996; 9: 988-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that ⋅NO and O2 both oxidized and nitrosated GSH. The yields of GSNO and GSSG depended upon the relative concentrations of ⋅NO and GSH, consistent with a competition between ⋅NO and GSH for ⋅NO2. The formation of GSSG, the increased O2 consumption upon increased GSH concentration, and the effect of SOD were evidence for the occurrence of a free radical mechanism in which O2 is reduced to O2⨪ by the glutathione disulfide radical (Reaction 9). If true, a fraction of generated ⋅NO should then react with O2⨪ in a diffusion-limited manner to form peroxynitrite (ONOO-/ONOOH), and hence the sensitivity of GSNO and nitrate formation to superoxide dismutase. Independent of peroxynitrite formation, the occurrence of GSSG in amounts exceeding those of GSNO indicates that ⋅NO autoxidation might initiate oxidative reactions that were previously only ascribed to the reaction of⋅NO with O2⨪. Thus, the dichotomy between the reactivity of ⋅NO autoxidation intermediates and peroxynitrite may not be as clear as previously thought, in as much as both the⋅NO/O2 and ⋅NO/O2⨪ reactions are accompanied by oxidation reactions. For the most part, the importance of ⋅NO2 in the⋅NO/O2 reaction and the formation of the glutathionyl radical, GS⋅, has been ignored in previous works. Although Pou and Rosen (27Pou S. Rosen G.M. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1998; 2: 1507-1512Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar) observed the transient formation of GS⋅ upon incubation of GSH with Sper/NO in the presence of a spin trap, no effort was made to further investigate product formation. The present work indicates that a large fraction of RSNO formed under these conditions is derived from the combination of GS⋅ with⋅NO because we showed that the thiyl radical trap DMPO reduces GSNO yields by ∼45%. We also showed that RSNO yields did not increase linearly with O2 concentration but were maximal at low O2 tension. Because O2 drives the removal of thiyl radicals and the consecutive formation of the ⋅NO scavenger O2⨪ (Reactions 8 and 9), a decrease in O2tension results in a diminished efficacy of these reactions and a resultant increase in the availability of ⋅NO and thiyl radicals for combination. Of course, the formation of⋅NO2 is an oxygen-dependent process, but the concentration attained at 3% O2 tension (corresponding to ∼30 μm) is not limiting compared with the low fluxes of ⋅NO generated by Sper/NO. As outlined in the Introduction, it would be very surprising if experimental results obtained from studies in aqueous solutions allowed a comprehensive understanding of the relevant chemical pathways that dictate cellular nitrosation. Among other considerations, compartmentalization of target molecules, the existence of hydrophobic environments that concentrate NO and O2, spatial and temporal variations in O2 availability and O2⨪production, as well as changes in enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant levels will all affect cellular nitrosation reactions (11Espey M.G. Miranda K.M. Thomas D.D. Wink D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30085-30091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), making the extrapolation of in vitro results to the in vivo situation a pointless exercise. Nevertheless, the results of our present investigation provide a strong foundation from which general principles may be developed that are amenable to further investigation in relevant animal models. An important implication of the present study is that low, physiological O2concentrations do not limit cellular RSNO formation. Rather, RSNO formation appears to be favored at oxygen concentrations that typically occur in tissues. However, because the rate of ⋅NO2formation is second order with regard to ⋅NO,⋅NO/O2-mediated oxidation and nitrosation reactions are hampered by the availability of ⋅NO2 in a fashion similar to the reactions mediated by N2O3. Independent of the role of⋅NO2 as a key intermediate, the recognition that RSNO formation occurs, at least in part, through a free radical mechanism offers new avenues for investigations of the nature of the pathways that lead to RSNO formation in vivo and of our ability to modulate these processes. Another important implication of these findings is that the concentration of RSNOs in vivomay not only be limited by the formation or availability of ⋅NO but also by the prevailing steady-state concentration of thiyl radicals, which may be influenced by the local availability of antioxidants. Importantly, RSNO formation was observed not only with GSH in vitro but also in intact cells endowed with a powerful antioxidative network in which intracellular GSH is complemented by ascorbate and α-tocopherol, for example, as well as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and other enzymes. It is intriguing to speculate that conditions that are associated with an increased oxidative stress and a consecutive increase in one-electron oxidation of thiols may provide an important source of thiyl radicals available for reaction with ⋅NO. Under such conditions, therapeutic strategies aimed at limiting the production and availability of thiyl radicals would be critical in modulating the sensitivity of cells and tissues to reactive nitrogen oxide species.

We tested the hypothesis that lipoproteins modulate the function and survival of insulin-secreting cells. We first detected the presence of several receptors that participate in the binding and processing of plasma lipoproteins and confirmed the internalization of fluorescent low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles in insulin-secreting β-cells. Purified human very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and LDL particles reduced insulin mRNA levels and β-cell proliferation and induced a dose-dependent increase in the rate of apoptosis. In mice lacking the LDL receptor, islets showed a dramatic decrease in LDL uptake and were partially resistant to apoptosis caused by LDL. VLDL-induced apoptosis of β-cells involved caspase-3 cleavage and reduction in the levels of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase-interacting protein-1. In contrast, the proapoptotic signaling of lipoproteins was antagonized by HDL particles or by a small peptide inhibitor of c-Jun N-terminal kinase. The protective effects of HDL were mediated, in part, by inhibition of caspase-3 cleavage and activation of Akt/protein kinase B. In conclusion, human lipoproteins are critical regulators of β-cell survival and may therefore contribute to the β-cell dysfunction observed during the development of type 2 diabetes.

Science. 1992; 258: 766-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). The lipid phenotype observed in diabetic patients is characterized by low levels of HDL1 cholesterol, moderate elevations in triglyceride-rich remnant particles, borderline to high LDL cholesterol, and an increase in plasma free fatty acids (2Wilson P.W. McGee D.L. Kannel W.B. Am. J. Epidemiol. 1981; 114: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Chronically elevated concentrations of free fatty acids have been shown to induce a state of insulin resistance and to alter β-cell function. The susceptibility of these cells to apoptosis is enhanced, and their insulin content and glucose-stimulated insulin release are significantly reduced (3Lupi R. Dotta F. Marselli L. Del Guerra S. Masini M. Santangelo C. Patane G. Boggi U. Piro S. Anello M. Bergamini E. Mosca F. Di Mario U. Del Prato S. Marchetti P.

Overt type 2 diabetes is present when the β-cell mass cannot compensate for insulin resistance. In Zucker diabetic fatty rats, free fatty acids are elevated before the onset of diabetes, leading to triglyceride accumulation in the islets and increased β-cell death (5Lee Y. Hirose H. Ohneda M.

Although the contribution of free fatty acids to the development of diabetes has been studied extensively, the role of lipoproteins in β-cell function is only partially documented. Grupping et al. (7Grupping A.Y. Cnop M. Van Schravendijk C.F. Hannaert J.C. Van Berkel T.J. Pipeleers D.G.

Given the key role of lipid homeostasis in β-cell function and survival, we hypothesized that lipoproteins modify the susceptibility of β-cells to apoptosis. Here we describe the presence of functional lipoprotein receptors in mouse pancreatic islets and in a transformed insulin-secreting β-cell line. We demonstrate that human purified VLDL and LDL induce a dose-dependent increase in the rate of apoptosis and a decrease in the levels of insulin transcript. In contrast, HDL efficiently antagonizes cell death by mechanisms that include activation of protein kinase B (Akt/PKB) and inhibition of caspase-3 cleavage. Finally, we establish that the LDL receptor (LDLR) and the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway play an important role in apoptosis induced by lipoproteins. These results demonstrate how the modifications in lipoproteins observed in type 2 diabetes could contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of β-cell failure. Blood was collected from healthy donors. Plasma VLDL, LDL, and HDL fractions were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation (VLDL density, 1.019; LDL density, 1.063; HDL density, 1.21), dialyzed against PBS, and then filter sterilized using a 0.22-μm microfilter. Protein and cholesterol concentrations were measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay and the cholesterol CHOD-PAP method (Roche Diagnostics). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to assess the integrity of the apolipoproteins and the purity of the different fractions. The lipoprotein preparations contained less than 0.112 unit of endotoxin/μmol of cholesterol as determined by the kinetic chromogenic technique (Endotell, Allschwil, Switzerland). Cholesteryl BODIPY-human HDL3 was reconstituted as described elsewhere (9Cherradi N. Bideau M. Arnaudeau S. Demaurex N. James R.W. Azhar S. Capponi A.M.

The insulin-secreting cell line βTC3 (cells over 120 passages) was cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 2 mmglutamine (Invitrogen). Both 11.1 mm and 5.0 mmglucose concentrations were used. Interleukin-1β (Alexis, Carlsbad, CA) was used at a concentration of 0.3 ng/ml, tumor necrosis factor-α (Alexis) at a concentration of 0.3 ng/ml, and interferon-γ (R&D Systems) at a concentration of 15 ng/ml. Lipoproteins were used at the following cholesterol concentrations: VLDL, 1.6 mm, 3.1 mm, 6.2 mm; LDL, 1.6 mm, 3.1 mm, 6.2 mm; HDL, 1.0 mm. Cell-permeable JNK inhibitor 1 (l-stereoisomer; Alexis) was added at a concentration of 1.5 μm 30 min before the addition of lipoproteins and again after 18 and 36 h. Islets were isolated from C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) mice and mice lacking the LDL receptor (LDLR−/−) (ages 2–3 months; Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) by intraductal digestion of the pancreas with the Liberase RI Purified Enzyme Blend (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Islets were hand-picked to purity and cultured in βTC3 culture medium supplemented with 1% 1m HEPES, pH 7.4. and 0.1% 50 mmβ-mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen). Total RNA was extracted from βTC3 cells using the RNAqueousTM-4PCR kit (Ambion, Huntingdon, UK) according to the manufacturer's protocol and treated with DNase to remove residual contaminations with DNA. RNA was reverse transcribed and cDNA amplified by PCR using Superscript II reverse transcriptase, Taq polymerase, and oligo(dT) primers (Invitrogen). The primers used for the VLDL receptor (VLDLR) were 5′-TCA TCA TCT GTG CTT ACA-3′ and 5′-ACT TAC AGT GAG ACA AAA G-3′. For the LDLR, the primer sequences were 5′-CTG TTC CCA CCT CTG TTT AC-3′ and 5′-AGT GAG ATA CGG CGA ATA GA-3′. For LDLR-related protein (LRP), primer sequences were 5′-CTA CAC CAC ATC CAC CAT-3′ and 5′-ACT CAT CCA GCA CAA AGG-3′. Sequences for apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (apoER2) were 5′-CAG TGG CTG TCC CTC ACT CGG-3′ and 5′-CAG GGC AGT CCA TCA TCT TCT TC-3′. Scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) primer sequences were 5′-GCC TGT TGG TTG GGA TGA-3′ and 5′-CTT GCT GAG TCC GTT CCA TT-3′. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) primer sequences were 5′-TGG GAC CAA CCT TCT ACC TC-3′ and 5′-CAT CAA GGA CAG CTC ACC AG-3′. Tubulin primer sequences were 5′-GGA GGA TGC TGC CAA TAA CT-3′ and 5′-GGT GGT GAG GAT GGA ATT GT-3′. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primer sequences were 5′-TCA AGA AGG TGG TGA AGC AG-3′ and 5′-AAG GTG GAA GAG TGG GAG TT-3′. Insulin primer sequences were 5′-TGG CTT CTT CTA CAC ACC CA-3′ and 5′-TCT AGT TGC AGT AGT TCT CCA-3′. Cyclin B1 primer sequences were 5′-AGC GAA GAG CTA CAG GCA AG-3′ and 5′-CAT GTT CAA GTT CAG GTT CAG G-3′. After amplification (activation at 95 °C for 5 min, denaturing at 95 °C for 0.5 min, primer annealing at 51 °C for 0.5 min, and chain elongation at 72 °C for 0.5 min) through 32 cycles, the whole volume of the PCR was separated by electrophoresis in a 3% agarose gel. We performed quantitative real time PCR using the LightCycler Instrument (Roche Diagnostics) and the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen). For HMG-CoA reductase quantification, cells were starved for 12 h and then incubated in the presence or absence of 3.0 mm LDL cholesterol for 15 h. For insulin and cyclin B1 quantification, cells were incubated for 48 h with different lipoprotein subfractions. Total RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed as described above. The cDNA was subsequently amplified with the appropriate primers (initial activation at 95 °C for 15 min, denaturing at 95 °C for 15 s, primer annealing at 51 °C for 20 s, and chain elongation at 72 °C for 18 s) through 40 cycles. Data were analyzed with the LightCycler Software (Roche Diagnostics). Tubulin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were used for normalization. Cells were washed once in cold PBS and lysed in Promega passive lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). A total of 40 μg of proteins was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting. Membranes were blocked by incubation for 1 h in a buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% milk and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibodies. The immunoreactive bands were visualized using a chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) after incubation of the nitrocellulose filters for 1 h with secondary anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Densitometric scanning of films was performed using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Antisera directed against SR-BI, LDLR, LRP, VLDLR, and apoER2 have been described previously (10Temel R.E.

The following antibodies were obtained commercially: anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Asp-175; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), anti-JIP-1 (BD Biosciences, Basel, Switzerland), and anti-α-tubulin (clone B-5-1-2; Sigma). Antisera were used at dilutions ranging from 1:250 to 1:1,000. Murine pancreases were fixed in a solution containing 1% paraformaldehyde and subsequently 30% sucrose. 12-μm sections were prepared and blocked for 1 h in a solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma). Incubation with the primary antisera (dilutions 1:250) was performed at 4 °C for 24 h. After several washes in PBS, sections were incubated for 30 min with secondary Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at a dilution of 1:400. Slices were analyzed with a confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Glattbrugg, Switzerland). βTC3 cells and mouse islets were seeded onto coverslips, starved for 4 h, and incubated with cholesteryl BODIPY-human HDL3 FL LDL (10 μg/ml medium; Molecular Probes) in the presence or absence of excess unlabeled LDL (100 μg/ml medium). After incubation for 2 h at 37 °C, cells were fixed and analyzed by light (for βTC3 cells) or confocal (for islets) microscopy. Microscope settings were kept strictly identical between different conditions. Similar experiments were performed with cholesteryl BODIPY-human HDL3 (30 μg/ml medium) in the presence or absence of excess unlabeled HDL (600 μg/ml medium). βTC3 cells were grown on laminin/poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips. After 2 days, the culture medium was changed, and cytokines and/or lipoproteins were added. Incubations were performed for 48 h. Cells were then fixed for 15 min with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS. To evaluate the number of apoptotic cells, cells were incubated in the presence of Hoechst 33342 (dilution 1:1,500; Molecular Probes) for 3.5 min, and the nuclear morphology was analyzed under a fluorescence microscope. The number of cells displaying a pycnotic (highly condensed) nucleus and/or a fragmented nucleus was evaluated blind by two different investigators. A minimum of 250 cells in four separate experiments was counted for each condition. For the analysis of nuclear morphology, fixed cells were stained for 7 min with 1 μm SYTOX Green (Molecular Probes). For every cell analyzed, 10 views spanning the entire nucleus were taken at high magnification with a confocal microscope, and three-dimensional images were generated using the Imaris software (Silicon Graphics, Inc., Mountain View, CA). For immunocytochemistry, fixed cells were incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin, 0.3% Triton X-100) and overnight at 4 °C with the primary antisera (dilutions: anti-SR-BI, anti-LDLR, anti-VLDLR, anti-apoER2, 1:250; anti-cleaved caspase-3, 1:40). After four washes in PBS, coverslips were incubated for 30 min with secondary Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG at a dilution of 1:400. For cleaved caspase-3, cells were counterstained for 3 min with Hoechst 33342 (dilution 1:1,500), and views were taken under a fluorescence microscope (100× objective) at 350 and 500 nm. The resulting images were subsequently assembled by using Photoshop technology (Adobe Systems). For SR-BI, LDLR, VLDLR, and apoER2, views were taken with a confocal microscope. For TUNEL, fixed cells were incubated for 2 min at 4 °C in permeabilization solution (0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium citrate). Coverslips were then rinsed, and 50 μl of TUNEL reaction mixture (Roche Diagnostics) was added to each sample. Slides were incubated in a humidified chamber for 60 min at 37 °C and counterstained for 3 min with Hoechst 33342. Mouse islets were incubated for 48 h in the presence of lipoproteins, fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and stained for 7 min with 1 μmSYTOX Green. For each islet analyzed, 5–15 views spanning the entire structure, each separated by 2 μm, were taken with a confocal microscope. The numbers of healthy and apoptotic nuclei were then evaluated using the Neurolucida software (MicroBrightField, Inc., Williston, VT). βTC3 cells were seeded onto coverslips and incubated for 48 h in the absence of serum and/or in the presence of lipoproteins. BrdUrd (Roche Diagnostics) was added to the cells for 1 h at a final concentration of 10 μm. Cells were then fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min and incubated for 1 h with 2 n HCl. Immunostaining with anti-BrdUrd (clone IIB5; Monosan, Uden, The Netherlands) diluted 1:100 and counterstaining with Hoechst 33342 were performed as described above. Counts were made by scoring the number of cells positive for BrdUrd incorporation. Akt activity was determined using a kit from Cell Signaling Technology. βTC3 cells were starved for 15 h and incubated with HDL at a concentration of 1.0 mm for 5 min, 20 min, and 60 min. Akt was immunoprecipitated from 200 μg of total protein equivalent of cell lysate with anti-Akt antibody linked to agarose beads overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed and resuspended in kinase buffer supplemented with 200 μm ATP and 1 μg of glycogen synthase kinase-3 fusion protein. After 30 min at 30 °C the reaction was stopped, and the extent of glycogen synthase kinase-3 phosphorylation was analyzed by Western blotting with a specific anti-phosphoglycogen synthase kinase-3 antibody. Results are presented as means ± S.E. Unpaired two-tailed Student's t test was used to compare groups. We first evaluated whether the genes encoding several receptors implicated in the binding and the internalization of lipoproteins were expressed in the insulin-secreting cell line βTC3. Using reverse transcription PCR, we detected the transcripts for LDLR and three other members of the LDLR family: LRP, VLDLR, and apoER2. We also detected the transcript for SR-BI, which mediates cholesterol uptake from HDL particles (data not shown). Immunohistochemical analysis of mouse pancreatic sections, using specific antibodies for these receptors, revealed a strong labeling in islets (Fig. 1,A–F). Similar data were obtained in βTC3 cells (data not shown). Western blot analysis of protein extracts from βTC3 cells revealed bands of the expected molecular masses for these receptors (Fig. 1G) (10Temel R.E. Trigatti B. DeMattos R.B. Azhar S. Krieger M.

We next examined the uptake and storage of LDL and HDL particles in βTC3 cells and in freshly isolated murine pancreatic islets. After incubation for 2 h with fluorescent HDL or LDL, βTC3 cells accumulated high quantities of labeled lipids (Fig. 2,A and C). Fluorescence was reduced markedly when cells were incubated with an excess of nonfluorescent LDL or HDL particles (Fig. 2, B andD), assessing the specificity of the uptake. We performed similar experiments on murine pancreatic islets isolated from WT and LDLR-deficient (LDLR−/−) mice. Islets from WT animals displayed an intense cytoplasmic signal when incubated with fluorescent LDL (Fig. 2E), whereas islets from LDLR−/− mice showed only a faint signal (Fig. 2F). The effect of LDL particles on HMG-CoA reductase expression was also investigated. As shown in Fig. 2G, incubation of βTC3 cells with LDL reduced HMG-CoA reductase mRNA by 83% (p < 0.01). Taken together, these data indicate that insulin-secreting cells express functional LDL receptors. Apoptosis is characterized by morphological changes that include chromatin condensation, cellular shrinkage, membrane blebbing, and the formation of apoptotic bodies. Changes in nuclear morphology are recognized as among the most reliable criteria to assess apoptosis. Cells were stained either with Hoechst 33342 or SYTOX Green, and the rate of apoptosis was evaluated by counting the number of cells displaying a pycnotic (highly condensed) and/or a fragmented nucleus (Fig.3A). Both dyes provide the same information, but SYTOX Green has the advantage of being more stable than Hoechst and easily detected at 488 nm with a standard confocal microscope. We studied in detail the morphological changes that take place in the nuclei of β-cells undergoing apoptosis. Three-dimensional images were generated showing the differing morphologies of a normal nucleus (Fig. 3D), an apoptotic nucleus (Fig. 3E), and a nucleus in early mitosis (Fig.3F). To assess apoptosis in primary islets accurately, we developed a novel experimental approach that allowed us to scan the three-dimensional islet structure and therefore did not require cell dissociation. Fig. 4 shows the appearance of an islet incubated in normal medium (Fig. 4, A andB) and after 2 days treatment with 3.1 mm VLDL (Fig. 4, C and D), 6.2 mm LDL (Fig.4, E and F), or 1.0 mm HDL (Fig. 4,G and H). Apoptotic nuclei appear highly fluorescent at low magnification and display characteristic features at higher magnification (arrows, Fig. 4). To confirm the data obtained by morphological studies, we performed a TUNEL assay (Fig.3C) and immunocytochemistry for cleaved caspase-3 (Fig.3B). All cells with an altered nuclear morphology assessed by Hoechst staining were positive for TUNEL. In contrast, cleaved caspase-3 was detected only in apoptotic cells treated with cytokines or VLDL, but not with LDL (data not shown).Figure 4Assessment of apoptosis in mouse islets treated with lipoproteins. Mouse islets were cultured for 48 h in the presence of lipoproteins, stained with SYTOX Green, and analyzed with a confocal microscope at low (×25) and high (×63) magnification.

Arrows indicate apoptotic nuclei.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As shown in Fig. 5A, a 2-day culture with increasing concentrations of VLDL or LDL in RPMI containing 11.1 mm glucose induced a dose-dependent increase in the apoptotic rate in βTC3 cells. The effects increased steadily over a 48-h time course (data not shown). Serum deprivation was used as a positive control and induced a 4.3-fold increased apoptotic rate. In contrast, HDL particles had a protective effect against β-cell death (Fig. 5B). In the presence of 1.0 mm HDL cholesterol, the basal apoptotic rate was reduced significantly. In addition, HDL particles antagonized the proapoptotic effects of serum deprivation or of cytokine treatment. Cell death induced by high doses of LDL could be partially abolished by HDL particles. To determine whether elevated glucose concentrations played a role in the adverse effects of VLDL and LDL, we performed similar experiments with βTC3 cells incubated with medium containing 5.0 mm glucose. No differences were observed in the apoptotic rate compared with experiments conducted with 11.1 mm glucose concentrations. We then confirmed in freshly isolated islets the effects observed in βTC3 cells with the exception of HDL, which did not decrease the basal apoptotic rate in control islets (Figs. 4 and Fig.5C). To evaluate the role of lipoprotein receptors in LDL-induced apoptosis, we incubated islets from LDLR−/− and WT mice with LDL particles. Elevated VLDL or LDL significantly increased the apoptotic rate in WT mice. The increase in apoptosis under LDL treatment was significantly lower in LDLR−/− mice compared with WT mice. We also confirmed the beneficial effects of HDL on islet cell survival (Fig. 5C). In WT mice, cell death induced by LDL particles was decreased by 46% in the presence of HDL. Taken together, these data demonstrate a deleterious effect of VLDL and LDL particles which requires, at least in part, the presence of the LDLR and which can be antagonized by HDL particles. Finally, we examined the role of human lipoproteins on insulin mRNA (Fig. 5D). As measured by quantitative reverse transcription PCR, insulin mRNA was reduced markedly under VLDL or LDL exposure. HDL particles had no influence and did not alleviate the detrimental effects of elevated LDL on insulin transcript levels. LDL at a lower concentration (3.1 mm) still reduced insulin mRNA but without inducing cell death. Caspase-3 is one of the key executioners of programmed cell death. Therefore, we quantified the amount of the cleaved active form by Western blotting in βTC3 cells (Fig.6A). Serum deprivation, cytokines, and 3.1 mm VLDL were all associated with increased levels of the activated cleaved protein. Surprisingly, 6.2 mm LDL did not induce any cleavage. Activation of caspase-3 was partially antagonized by HDL particles, confirming the survival-promoting role of these lipoproteins. Islet-brain 1/JNK-interacting protein-1 (IB1/JIP-1) is a scaffold protein that interacts with several components of the JNK signaling pathway (15Bonny C. Nicod P. Waeber G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1843-1846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We examined whether this pathway is implicated in apoptosis induced by lipoproteins. Incubations with 3.1 mmVLDL reduced IB1/JIP-1 levels by 56%, whereas LDL or HDL had no effect (Fig. 6B). A cell-permeable peptide inhibitor of the JNK pathway (16Bonny C. Oberson A. Negri S. Sauser C. Schorderet D.F. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) partially inhibited apoptosis induced by VLDL, but not by LDL particles (Fig. 6C). Taken together, these data suggest that cell death triggered by VLDL depends on caspase-3, IB1/JIP-1, and JNK. Cell proliferation in βTC3 cells exposed to lipoproteins was evaluated by quantitating BrdUrd incorporation (Fig.7A). Elevated concentrations of VLDL (3.1 mm) or LDL (6.2 mm) significantly decreased the number of cells positive for BrdUrd incorporation, whereas HDL caused a slight increase that was not statistically significant (p = 0.064). Cyclin B1 is expressed predominantly in the G2/M phase of cell division and participates in the control of cell proliferation. Cyclin B1 mRNA was reduced by 39% in cells treated with 3.1 mmVLDL and by 29% when treated with 6.2 mm LDL (Fig.7B), suggesting a mechanism by which these lipoproteins reduce cell proliferation. Finally, HDL particles induced activation of Akt/PKB, known as a key regulator of cellular survival (Fig.7C). This study shows that several members of the LDLR family are expressed in β-cells. Because islets from LDLR−/− mice display markedly decreased LDL uptake compared with islets from WT mice, we propose LDLR to be the main receptor responsible for LDL internalization in β-cells. ApoER2 can also bind LDL particles with lower affinity (17Kim D.H. Iijima H. Goto K. Sakai J. Ishii H. Kim H.J. Suzuki H. Kondo H. Saeki S. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8373-8380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), which may explain why low levels of LDL uptake are still observed in islets from LDLR−/− mice. Down-regulation of HMG-CoA reductase expression in β-cells treated with LDL confirms that these cells express functional receptors for LDL particles. SR-BI is unrelated to LDLR and has been shown to mediate selective uptake of cholesterol from HDL particles (10Temel R.E. Trigatti B. DeMattos R.B. Azhar S. Krieger M. Williams D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13600-13605Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate for the first time the presence of SR-BI in β-cells concomitant with the uptake of HDL. Exposure of insulin-secreting cells to human VLDL and LDL induces an increase in apoptosis which depends on both the duration of the incubation and the concentration of particles. Cell death triggered in this way appears to occur via two different mechanisms. Caspase-3 is strongly activated in the presence of elevated VLDL concentrations, whereas cellular disassembly and packaging into apoptotic bodies, which take place in the presence of LDL, are independent of caspase-3. Moreover, VLDL, but not LDL, reduces the levels of IB1/JIP-1. This protein is expressed at high levels in pancreatic β-cells and has been shown to play an important role in controlling the activity of the JNK signaling pathway (18Bonny C. Oberson A. Steinmann M. Schorderet D.F. Nicod P. Waeber G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16466-16472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). A mutation in the MAPK8IP1 gene encoding IB1 has been associated with a familial form of type 2 diabetes (19Waeber G. Delplanque J. Bonny C. Mooser V. Steinmann M. Widmann C. Maillard A. Miklossy J. Dina C. Hani E.H. Vionnet N. Nicod P. Boutin P. Froguel P. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Recently, Bonny et al. (16Bonny C. Oberson A. Negri S. Sauser C. Schorderet D.F. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) engineered cell-permeable peptide inhibitors of JNK corresponding to the minimal JNK binding domain of IB1/JIP-1 which resulted in a marked inhibition of β-cell death triggered by interleukin-1β. These peptides could partially antagonize VLDL-induced apoptosis, but they had no effect on incubations performed with LDL. These data indicate that VLDL induces apoptosis concomitant with a reduction in IB1/JIP-1 levels and an activation of the JNK pathway. A study by Bonny et al. (18Bonny C. Oberson A. Steinmann M. Schorderet D.F. Nicod P. Waeber G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16466-16472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) implicated this reduction in IB1/JIP-1 levels in increased apoptosis. Our study establishes that the LDLR plays an important role in β-cell death caused by LDL. When exposed to elevated LDL concentrations, islets from LDLR−/− were more resistant to apoptosis than islets from WT mice. However, apoptotic rates were slightly higher than in control conditions, which may be explained by the presence of other lipoprotein receptors that were shown to be present in LDLR−/− mice. We show that in contrast to VLDL and LDL, HDL promotes β-cell survival and protect against apoptosis. HDL efficiently antagonizes the proapoptotic effects of serum deprivation and incubation with cytokines or lipoproteins. In the presence of HDL, caspase-3 cleavage is reduced markedly, and Akt/PKB is activated. Akt inhibits apoptosis by phosphorylating a variety of substrates, including Bad, FKHR, glycogen synthase kinase-3, and caspase-9 (20Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3729) Google Scholar). In the endocrine pancreas, Akt1 has been shown to regulate β-cell growth and survival (21Tuttle R.L. Gill N.S. Pugh W. Lee J.P. Koeberlein B. Furth E.E. Polonsky K.S. Naji A. Birnbaum M.J. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1133-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). In endothelial cells, Akt is a mediator of the antiapoptotic effects of HDL (22Nofer J.R. Levkau B. Wolinska I. Junker R. Fobker M. von Eckardstein A. Seedorf U. Assmann G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34480-34485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that lipoproteins have significant effects on cellular proliferation. HDL has been identified as potent mitogens in vascular smooth muscle by stimulating entry into S phase (23Nofer J.R. Junker R. Pulawski E. Fobker M. Levkau B. von Eckardstein A. Seedorf U. Assmann G. Walter M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 730-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In accordance with this result, HDL increases insulin-secreting cell proliferation in our system. VLDL and LDL, in contrast, induce a decrease in proliferation which is associated with a reduction in cyclin B1 gene expression. This may explain the reduction in proliferation because cyclin B1 protein complexes with p34(cdc2) to form the mitosis-promoting factor. Finally, we establish that VLDL and LDL, but not HDL, markedly reduce the level of insulin transcript. These effects are not attributable solely to apoptosis triggered by these lipoproteins because they occur even with doses too low to cause apoptosis or when apoptosis is inhibited with HDL. Deleterious effects of free fatty acids on insulin transcription are known (24Ritz-Laser B. Meda P. Constant I. Klages N. Charollais A. Morales A. Magnan C. Ktorza A. Philippe J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4005-4014Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), but our data are the first to demonstrate a similar role for lipoproteins. Lipoprotein concentrations used in our study are in the normal or supraphysiological range observed in human plasma. Because pancreatic islets are highly vascularized structures with fenestrated capillaries (25Bannister L.H. Berry M.M. Collins P. Dyson M. Dussek J.E. Ferguson M.W.J. Gray's Anatomy. 38th Ed. Churchill Livingstone, New York1995: 1793Google Scholar), the settings chosen in our experiments probably reflect the conditions found in vivo. Recently, Cnop et al.(26Cnop M. Hannaert J.C. Grupping A.Y. Pipeleers D.G. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3449-3453Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) studied the role of LDL in rat β-cell death. Surprisingly, LDL toxicity occurred with doses far below physiological concentrations, and the effects on β-cells were described as necrosis. Our study shows that higher concentrations are required to cause death in βTC3 cells and primary mouse islets, with features characteristic of apoptosis. Differences between the species studied might explain these discrepancies. The present study is in line with genetic studies and pharmacological interventions in humans. It has recently been suggested that a locus on chromosome 9 is linked to both cholesterol levels and diabetes mellitus (27Arya R. Duggirala R. Almasy L. Rainwater D.L. Mahaney M.C. Cole S. Dyer T.D. Williams K. Leach R.J. Hixson J.E. MacCluer J.W. O'Connell P. Stern M.P. Blangero J. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 102-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Blood lipoprotein levels have been confirmed as important predictors for the onset of type 2 diabetes, and preventative administration of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor pravastatin was associated with a reduction of 30% in the occurrence of type 2 diabetes in the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS) (28Freeman D.J.

Circulation. 2001; 103: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we propose that the changes in plasma lipoproteins observed during type 2 diabetes are not only a consequence of the disease but may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease itself.

However, mechanisms underlying IL-6-induced NO production remain unclear. JAK2/STAT3 and ERK1/2 are two well known signaling pathways activated by IL-6 in non-cardiac cells. However, these IL-6-activated pathways have not been identified in adult cardiac myocytes. In this study, we identified activation of these two pathways during IL-6 stimulation and examined their roles in IL-6-induced NO production and decrease in contractility of adult ventricular myocytes. IL-6 increased phosphorylation of STAT3 (at Tyr705) and ERK1/2 (at Tyr204) within 5 min that peaked at 15–30 min and returned to basal levels at 2 h. Phosphorylation of STAT3 was blocked by genistein, a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and AG490, a JAK2 inhibitor, but not PD98059, an ERK1/2 kinase inhibitor. The phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was blocked by PD98059 and genistein but not AG490. Furthermore, IL-6 enhanced de novo synthesis of iNOS protein, increased NO production, and decreased cardiac contractility after 2 h of incubation. These effects were blocked by genistein and AG490 but not PD98059. We conclude that IL-6 activated independently the JAK2/STAT3 and ERK1/2 pathways, but only JAK2/STAT3 signaling mediated the NO-associated decrease in contractility.

Thus, IL-6 has been suggested to play an important role in the pathophysiology of these cardiac disorders. In vitro studies in papillary muscle isolated from hamster heart showed that IL-6 decreases contractility via a nitric oxide (NO)-dependent pathway during a 20-min exposure (13Finkel M.S. Oddis C.V. Jacob T.D. Watkins S.C. Hatttler B.G. Simmons R.L. Science. 1992; 257: 387-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar). IL-6 was also shown to decrease peak cytosolic intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+] i ) and cell contraction of chick embryonic cardiomyocytes within minutes (14Kinugawa K. Takahashi T. Kohmoto O. Yao A. Aoyagi T. Momomura S. Hirata Y. Serizawa T. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 285-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The acute IL-6-induced suppression of cardiac contractility and [Ca2+] i was suggested to result from activation of Ca2+-dependent NOS, presumably a constitutive endothelial isoform (eNOS) (14Kinugawa K. Takahashi T. Kohmoto O. Yao A. Aoyagi T. Momomura S. Hirata Y. Serizawa T. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 285-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In the same study, IL-6 was shown to induce iNOS expression after a 24-h incubation, and it was suggested that the enhanced iNOS is responsible for the chronic effect of IL-6 on the Ca2+ transient and cell contraction (14Kinugawa K.

However, the signaling mechanism by which IL-6 activates iNOS and decreases cardiac contractility remains undefined. IL-6 has been shown to activate both the JAK2/STAT3 pathway (15Kishimoto T. Akira S. Narazaki M. Taga T. Blood. 1995; 86: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hibi M. Nakajima K. Hirano T. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and the ERK1/2 pathway through gp130, a signal transducing receptor, in non-cardiac cells (15Kishimoto T. Akira S. Narazaki M. Taga T.

For example, studies in liver and neuronal cells have shown that IL-6 induces Tyr705phosphorylation of STAT3, a transcription factor, via activation of JAK2 (17Schumann G. Huell M. Machein U. Hocke G. Fiebich B.L. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2009-2017PubMed Google Scholar, 19Debonera F. Aldeguer X. Shen X.D. Gelman A.E. Gao F. Que X.Y. Greenbaum L.E. Furth E.E. Taub R. Olthoff K.M. J. Surg.

Activated STAT3 translocates to the nucleus and activates expression of many genes in response to cytokines (21Decker T. Cell. Mol.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2548-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). The role of gp130 in cardiac function has also been examined. One study showed that transgenic mice with overexpression of gp130 displayed hypertrophied ventricular myocardium (25Hirota H. Yoshida K. Kishimoto T. Taga T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4862-4866Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Studies in fetal murine cardiac myocytes infected with adenovirus carrying wild-type or mutated STAT3 cDNA suggested that the STAT3-dependent signaling pathway plays a role in promoting the hypertrophy induced by leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a member of IL-6-related cytokines (26Kunisada K. Tone E. Fujio Y. Matsui H. Yamauchi-Takihara K. Kishimoto T. Circulation. 1998; 98: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In addition, activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway in rat heart has been associated with the cardiac hypertrophy stimulated by cardiotrophin-1, another member of IL-6-related cytokines (27Yamauchi-Takihara K. Kishimoto T. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 2000; 81: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and with cardiac dysfunction during ischemia and reperfusion (28Mascareno E. El-Shafei M. Maulik N. Sato M. Guo Y. Das D.K. Siddiqui M.A.Q. Circulation. 2001; 104: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), myocardial ischemia (29Omura T. Yoshiyama M. Ishikura F. Kobayashi H. Takeuchi K.

Oh H. Kishimoto T. Yamauchi-Takihara K. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 47: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Although different isoforms of JAK/STAT have been associated with effects of IL-6-related cytokines in adult rat heart, direct links between IL-6 stimulation, activation of JAK/STAT, and IL-6-induced cardiac inotropic actions have not been established. Studies in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes have also shown that ERK1/2 is activated by LIF via a gp130-dependent process (31Kunisada K. Hirota H. Fujio Y. Matsui H. Tani Y. Yamauchi-Takihara K. Kishimoto T. Circulation. 1996; 94: 2626-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and that the ERK1/2 activation is associated with cardiac hypertrophy (32Kodama H. Fukuda K. Pan J. Sano M. Takahashi T. Kato T. Makino S. Manabe T. Murata M. Ogawa S. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2000; 279: H1635-H1644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, LIF-induced hypertrophy occurred only in fetal cardiac myocytes infected with a wild-type STAT3 cDNA with the level of ERK1/2 activation showing no difference from those cells infected with mutated STAT3 cDNA (26Kunisada K. Tone E. Fujio Y. Matsui H. Yamauchi-Takihara K. Kishimoto T. Circulation. 1998; 98: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Thus, the functional role of gp130-associated activation of ERK1/2 and JAK/STAT in IL-6-induced cardiac effects remains unclear. In this study, we first demonstrated that IL-6 activated both the JAK2/STAT3 and ERK1/2 pathways in adult ventricular myocytes. We also showed that protein expression of iNOS and an increase in NO production were first detectable after 2 h of IL-6 stimulation. Such treatment with IL-6 also decreased the contractile function of ventricular myocytes. Most importantly, we found that the IL-6-induced activation of iNOS and decrease in contractility were mediated by JAK2/STAT3, but not by ERK1/2. Single ventricular myocytes were isolated from hearts of adult (3–6-month-old) male Sprague-Dawley rats using enzymatic dissociation as described previously (33Liu S. Schreur K.D. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1995; 268: C339-C349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated cells were plated into Petri or culture dishes (Falcon) containing a serum-free, l-arginine-containing culture medium and incubated overnight. Myocytes were then treated with 10 ng/ml IL-6 for various periods of time. The use of animals was carried out under a protocol approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. Protein preparation and immunoblotting were carried out as described previously (34Liu S.J. McHowat J. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 1998; 44: H1462-H1472Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, control and treated myocytes (0.25 × 106 cells/group) were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, 250 mm sucrose, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. The concentration of total protein was determined using a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). 20–40 μg of each protein sample were separated electrophoretically on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking with Tris buffer solution containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% non-fat milk for 1 h at room temperature, membranes were probed with polyclonal anti-phospho-STAT3 antibodies (1:1000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Beverly, MA), monoclonal anti-phospho-ERK antibodies (1:1,000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), or polyclonal anti-iNOS antibodies (1:1,000 dilution; Cayman Co., Ann Arbor, MI) overnight at 4 °C. Immunoblots were detected using enhanced chemiluminescent kits (SuperSignal; Pierce) and analyzed with a densitometer (Bio-Rad). The membranes were then stripped and reprobed with polyclonal anti-STAT3 antibodies (1:2,000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or polyclonal anti-ERK antibodies (1:2,000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Myocytes were plated onto sterile multi-chamber slides (Nalge Nunc Corp., Naperville, IL) in serum-free culture media overnight at 37 °C. After treatment with 10 ng/ml IL-6, cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, and permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were then incubated for 20 min in PBS containing 10% goat serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA), washed with PBS, and incubated for 60 min with polyclonal anti-iNOS antibodies (1:100; Cayman Co., Ann Arbor, MI) in PBS containing 1.5% goat serum at room temperature. After three washes with PBS (5 min each), cells were incubated for 45 min in PBS containing fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:100; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and 1.5% goat serum in a dark chamber and then examined using an epifluorescent microscope (Zeiss). NO production was assessed by measuring total nitrate and nitrite (NOx) in culture media and cell lysates. Myocytes were incubated in serum-free and phenol-red-free culture medium in the absence and presence of 10 ng/ml IL-6 for 2, 4, and 24 h before being centrifuged at 100 × g for 10 min. The supernatant (culture media) was removed and kept at −20 °C until the NOx assay. The pellets were resuspended in 500 μl of PBS (pH 7.4), half of which was used to determine protein content. The other half was sonicated and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the final supernatant was filtered through a 10-kDa molecular mass cut-off filter (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) at 12,000 × g for 30 min. These cell lysates were kept at −20 °C until the NOx assay. The concentration of NOx in culture media and cell lysates was determined using a colorimetric assay kit with a detection limit of 2.5 μm(Cayman Co., Ann Arbor, MI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nitrate/nitrite concentrations were averaged from duplicate or triplicate measurements and reported as nmol NOx per mg cell protein. Results of treated groups were then normalized to each time control. After the designated exposure duration, contraction of ventricular myocytes was elicited by field stimulation (2-ms duration, 1.5-fold threshold voltage) at 0.5 Hz in normal Tyrode's solution containing the following (in mm): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 0.8 MgCl2, 10 HEPES/Tris, and 5.6 glucose. CS was monitored using an edge motion detector (Crescent Electronics, Sandy, UT) as described previously (35Liu S.J. Kennedy R.H. Creer M.H. Howat J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 284: C826-C838Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The voltage signal was calibrated to determine actual motion (μm). Post-rest potentiation (PRP), which has been used to assess cardiac Ca2+ handling and contractile function (36Bers D.M. Li L. Satoh H. McCall E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 853: 157-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 37Bassani J.W.M. Bassani R.A. Bers D.M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1993; 265: C533-C540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was measured as the first contraction after given rest intervals (e.g. for 30 s (PRP30) or 60 s (PRP60)). The relative amplitude of PRP CS was presented by normalizing its peak amplitude to that of steady-state CS before the rest interval. Recombinant rat IL-6 was purchased from Pepro Tech Inc (Rocky Hill, NJ); the nitrate/nitrite colorimetric assay kit was obtained from Cayman Co. Cycloheximide, genistein, PD98059, and AG490 were purchased from Calbiochem. In biochemical assays, all treated groups were normalized to each time control and presented as means ± S.E. Statistical significance (p < 0.05) was evaluated by Student's t test or analysis of variance with Duncan's multiple range test. Although activation of JAK/STAT signaling has been associated with gp130-related stimulation by LIF (26Kunisada K. Tone E. Fujio Y. Matsui H. Yamauchi-Takihara K. Kishimoto T. Circulation. 1998; 98: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and cardiotrophin-1 (27Yamauchi-Takihara K. Kishimoto T. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 2000; 81: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), there were no data demonstrating a direct link of this pathway to IL-6 stimulation in cardiac myocytes. Thus, we first examined whether IL-6 activates the JAK2/STAT3 pathway in adult ventricular myocytes. Fig. 1 Ashows that phosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr705 was detected after 5 min of exposure to 10 ng/ml IL-6, reached a maximum at 15 min, and then declined within 1 h. Fig. 1 B shows combined data of the time course for the phosphorylation of STAT3, which was increased 9.3-, 12.1-, 9.7-, and 7.6-fold (n = 4,p < 0.05, compared with time control) after 5, 15, 30, and 60 min of exposure to IL-6, respectively. The level of phosphorylation returned to basal levels after 2 and 4 h of treatment, and a second increase (∼ 2-fold) was observed at 24 h (Fig. 1 B). Total STAT3 protein levels remained relatively constant during the 24-h stimulation (lower panel in Fig.1 A). These results demonstrate that IL-6 activates a STAT3 signaling in adult rat ventricular myocytes. Fig. 2 shows the effects of three different kinase inhibitors on the phosphorylation of STAT3 after 30 min of exposure to 10 ng/ml IL-6. Cells were pretreated for 30 min with these inhibitors before IL-6 exposure. IL-6-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr705 was blocked by 20 μm AG490, a JAK2 inhibitor, and by 10 μm genistein, a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, but not by 10 μm PD98059, an ERK1/2 kinase inhibitor (Fig. 2, A and B). These data suggest that IL-6-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 is mediated through JAK2 activation. Fig.3 A shows that an increase in phosphorylation of ERK2 at Tyr204 was detected after 5 min of exposure to 10 ng/ml IL-6; this effect peaked at 30 min and was followed by a decline to basal levels by 2 h. Note that ERK2 is the predominate form in adult ventricular myocytes, and the basal level of p-ERK2 (each time control, as well as zero-time control) also remained relatively constant. Fig. 3 B summarizes combined data showing a time-dependent IL-6-induced phosphorylation of ERK2 with increases of 5.2-, 5.0-, 9.5-, and 5.1-fold (compared with time controls) after 5, 15, 30, and 60 min of exposure (n = 3, p < 0.05), respectively. The level of ERK2 phosphorylation at 2, 4, and 24 h was not significantly different from time controls. These results suggest that IL-6 transiently activates ERK1/2 signaling in adult rat ventricular myocytes. Fig. 4 shows that after 30 min of exposure to IL-6 the marked increase in phosphorylation of ERK2 at Tyr204 was blocked by 10 μm PD98059 and 10 μm genistein but not by 20 μm AG490. These data suggest that IL-6-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 is independent of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. Although iNOS expression was detected after 24 h of IL-6 stimulation in chick embryonic heart cells (14Kinugawa K. Takahashi T. Kohmoto O. Yao A. Aoyagi T. Momomura S. Hirata Y. Serizawa T. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 285-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), the time course of induction of iNOS has not been examined in adult cardiac myocytes. Fig. 5 A shows the time-dependent increase in iNOS protein (∼130 kDa) expression in response to 10 ng/ml IL-6 in adult rat ventricular myocytes. iNOS protein was undetectable at 1 h but was increased after 2, 4, and 24 h of incubation with IL-6. Fig. 5 B, which represents combined data from five experiments, shows that iNOS protein expression in IL-6-treated myocytes was increased 9-fold, compared with time controls after 2 h of treatment. Similarly, immunocytochemical data in Fig. 5 C show that iNOS was evident in a myocyte after 2 h of exposure to 10 ng/ml IL-6, whereas it was barely detectable in 2-h time control myocytes or after 1 h of IL-6 stimulation. The iNOS expression induced by a 2-h incubation with 10 ng/ml IL-1β, a well known inducer of iNOS in cardiac myocytes (38Balligand J.-L. Ungureanu-Longrois D. Simmons W.W. Pimental D. Malinski T.A. Kapturczak M. Taha Z. Lowenstein C.J. Davidoff A.J. Kelly R.A. Smith T.W. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27580-27588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used as a positive control in these experiments. Thus, these results suggest that IL-6 induces iNOS protein expression within 2 h of exposure. We then determined whether de novo protein synthesis is involved in IL-6-induced iNOS protein expression. Fig.6 A shows that total NOx concentration in culture medium was increased after a 2-h exposure to 10 ng/ml IL-6 (note that the IL-6-induced NOx production was blocked completely by 50 nmol/liter 2-amino-5,6-dihydro-6-methyl-4H-1,3-thiazine, a potent and selective inhibitor of iNOS) (39Yu X.-W. Kennedy R.H. Liu S.J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2000; 32 (Abstr. J10): A72Google Scholar). This 2.5-fold increase in NOxproduction was abolished in the presence of 10 μmcycloheximide (CHX), an inhibitor of protein synthesis that was applied 30 min prior to and during the IL-6 treatment. The NOxconcentration in the 2-h time control was 2.65 ± 0.46 nmol/mg cell protein and was not affected by CHX. Similarly, Fig. 6 Bshows that under the same conditions of IL-6 treatment, the NOx concentration in cell lysates was increased ∼3.5-fold of the time control after 2 h of incubation. CHX completely blocked this IL-6-induced increase in NOx production and had no effect on the basal level (2.18 ± 0.31 nmol/mg cell protein) in cell lysate. These results suggest that de novoprotein synthesis and the activity of iNOS are required for IL-6-induced NO production during a 2-h exposure. Fig.7 shows that the iNOS protein expression induced 2 h after exposure to 10 ng/ml IL-6 was blocked completely by pretreatment with 20 μm AG490 and 10 μmgenistein. In contrast, pretreatment with 10 μm PD98059 had no effect on IL-6-induced iNOS expression. Similar results were observed in five experiments. Fig. 8shows that IL-6 increased the total NOx concentration in cell lysates ∼2.4-fold (n = 5, p < 0.05) after 2 h of exposure when compared with time controls. This IL-6-induced increase in NO production was blocked by AG490 and genistein but not by PD98059. Similar results were observed in cell lysate after a 4-h incubation (data not shown). These results suggest that IL-6-induced iNOS protein expression and NO production are mediated by activation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway, but not the ERK1/2 pathway.Figure 8Effects of kinase inhibitors on IL-6-induced increase in NO production. Cell lysates were obtained from myocytes pretreated with 10 μm PD98059, 20 μm AG490, or 10 μm genistein for 30 min before exposure to 10 ng/ml IL-6 for 2 h. Normalized NOx concentrations of treated groups were presented as ratio to each control value. The NO production in myocytes treated with kinase inhibitors alone for 2.5 h did not differ from that in time controls. Data represent means ± S.E. from three to eight experiments. *, p < 0.05, compared with control; #,p < 0.05, compared with PD98058 alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our preliminary findings showed that IL-6 decreased contractility in adult ventricular myocytes as demonstrated by reductions in PRP and the responsiveness to extracellular Ca2+ concentrations (39Yu X.-W. Kennedy R.H. Liu S.J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2000; 32 (Abstr. J10): A72Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether the JAK2/STAT3 and/or ERK1/2 pathways are involved in the IL-6-induced negative inotropic effect. Fig.9 A shows representative data of PRP30 and PRP60 in a time-control (upper panel) and an IL-6 treated myocyte (lower panel). The amplitude of PRP30 and PRP60 relative to that of pre-rest steady state is shown in Fig. 9,B and C, respectively. Exposure for 2 h to 10 ng/ml IL-6 reduced PRP30 and PRP60 by ∼34% (n = 17, p < 0.05) and 32% (n = 16,p < 0.05), respectively. The IL-6-induced decreases in PRP30 and PRP60 were blocked by 20 μm AG490 and 10 μm genistein but not by 10 μm PD98059. Pretreatment with PD98059, AG490, or genistein alone had no effect on PRP30 or PRP60. The same results were observed after 4 and 24 h of exposure to IL-6 (data not shown). These data suggest that the IL-6-induced decrease in cardiac contractility is mediated by activation of the JAK2/STAT3, but not ERK1/2, pathway. Recently, both IL-6-related cytokines and the JAK/STAT signaling pathway have been suggested to play important roles in cardiac pathophysiology (40Wollert K.C. Drexler H. Heart Fail. Rev. 2001; 6: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Our preliminary studies suggested that IL-6 decreases contractility of adult rat ventricular myocytes via an iNOS pathway during chronic exposure (39Yu X.-W. Kennedy R.H. Liu S.J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2000; 32 (Abstr. J10): A72Google Scholar), consistent with findings reported by others using chick cardiomyocytes (14Kinugawa K. Takahashi T. Kohmoto O. Yao A. Aoyagi T. Momomura S. Hirata Y. Serizawa T. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 285-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The mechanism underlying IL-6-induced iNOS has not been defined. In this study, we demonstrated that IL-6 activates both the JAK2/STAT3 and ERK1/2 pathways in adult ventricular myocytes. We also showed that 1) IL-6 induces iNOS protein expression via de novo synthesis within 2 h, accompanied by an increase in NO production in culture medium and cell lysates, and 2) IL-6-induced iNOS expression, increase in NO production, and decrease in contractility are blocked by inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation with a JAK2 inhibitor and a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor but not by inhibition of ERK1/2 activation. IL-6-related cytokines, such as IL-6 and LIF, bind to distinct receptors and trigger the formation of homodimerization of a common signal transducing receptor, gp130, or heterodimerization of gp130 with the LIF receptor (15Kishimoto T. Akira S. Narazaki M. Taga T. Blood. 1995; 86: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of gp130 involves rapid tyrosine phosphorylation as induced by LIF (31Kunisada K. Hirota H. Fujio Y. Matsui H. Tani Y. Yamauchi-Takihara K. Kishimoto T. Circulation. 1996; 94: 2626-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) or by IL-6 (41Murakami M. Narazaki M. Hibi M. Yawata H. Yasukawa K. Hamaguchi M. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11349-11353Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), which is believed to be required for association with members of the JAK family such as JAK1, JAK2, and Tyr-2 and recruitment of STAT3 to gp130 (15Kishimoto T. Akira S. Narazaki M. Taga T. Blood. 1995; 86: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thereafter, tyrosine-specific phosphorylation of STAT3 occurs and initiates its downstream cascade to alter gene expression. Activation of gp130 has also been shown to activate the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (or ERK1/2) cascade (31Kunisada K. Hirota H. Fujio Y. Matsui H. Tani Y. Yamauchi-Takihara K. Kishimoto T. Circulation. 1996; 94: 2626-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 32Kodama H. Fukuda K. Pan J. Sano M. Takahashi T. Kato T. Makino S. Manabe T. Murata M. Ogawa S. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2000; 279: H1635-H1644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we showed that IL-6 enhances tyrosine phosphorylation of both STAT3 and ERK1/2 in a similar time course and that both activations are blocked by genistein. In contrast, a JAK2 inhibitor (AG490) blocked only IL-6-induced activation of STAT3 but not the increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation, whereas PD98058 blocked IL-6-induced activation of ERK1/2 but not STAT3. These results suggest that 1) IL-6 activates the JAK2/STAT3 and ERK1/2 pathways independently via tyrosine phosphorylation of g130 (e.g. blocked by genistein) in adult ventricular myocytes, and 2) the JAK2/STAT3 activity is not required for IL-6-induced activation of ERK1/2 and vice versa. The time course of iNOS induction by cytokines in cardiac myocytes is not clearly defined. For example, IL-6-induced iNOS expression was detected in chick embryonic heart cells after a 24-h incubation (14Kinugawa K. Takahashi T. Kohmoto O. Yao A. Aoyagi T. Momomura S. Hirata Y. Serizawa T. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 285-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, IL-6 levels may be increased for relatively short periods after insults such as cardiopulmonary bypass. The present study examined the time course of IL-6-induced iNOS expression in adult ventricular myocytes and found that de novo synthesis of iNOS protein was detected within 2 h of IL-6 stimulation. Such increased iNOS is accompanied by an increase in NO production and a decrease in contractile function. These IL-6-elicited cardiac effects were sustained during 24 h of exposure to the cytokine. The iNOS gene promoter region has three sites for STAT binding (42Xie Q.W. Whisnant R. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1779-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). Studies using human DLD-1 cells, a colon epithelial-derived cell line, showed that a cytokine mixture of INF-γ, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-α induced iNOS expression via activation of the JAK2/STAT1α pathway, which was blocked by AG490 (43Kleinert H. Wallerath T. Fritz G. Ihrig-Biedert I. Rodriguez-Pascual F. Geller D.A. Förstermann U. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). INF-γ-induced iNOS expression has also been shown to be paralleled by STAT1α activation in adult rat ventricular myocytes (44Singh K. Balligand J.L. Fischer T.A. Smith T.W. Kelly R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1111-1117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that STAT3 activation also mediates IL-6-induced iNOS protein synthesis. In the present study, we showed that genistein and AG490 block IL-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation, iNOS protein expression, NO production, and negative inotropy. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the IL-6-induced JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway mediates its induction of iNOS, thereby increasing NO production and decreasing cardiac contractility. The ERK1/2 pathway has been shown to play an important role in the cardiac hypertrophy induced by a variety of stimuli. However, the role of IL-6-induced increases in ERK1/2 phosphorylation in cardiac function is still unclear. For example, gp130-dependent activation of ERK1/2 induced by LIF induces hypertrophy in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes (32Kodama H. Fukuda K. Pan J. Sano M. Takahashi T. Kato T. Makino S. Manabe T. Murata M. Ogawa S. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2000; 279: H1635-H1644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, LIF-induced ERK1/2 activation was observed in fetal cardiac myocytes infected with a wild-type STAT3 cDNA and mutated STAT3 cDNA, whereas only cells infected with intact STAT3 displayed hypertrophy (26Kunisada K. Tone E. Fujio Y. Matsui H. Yamauchi-Takihara K. Kishimoto T. Circulation. 1998; 98: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The same study also showed that LIF-induced increase in STAT3-dependent c-fos and atrial natriuretic factor mRNA expression was attenuated by inhibition of ERK1/2 by PD98059, suggesting a cross-talk between JAK/STAT and ERK1/2 signaling in fetal murine cardiac myocytes (26Kunisada K. Tone E. Fujio Y. Matsui H. Yamauchi-Takihara K. Kishimoto T. Circulation. 1998; 98: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In contrast, the present study showed that the iNOS expression, NO production, or negative inotropy induced by IL-6 was not affected by inhibition of ERK1/2. Although the role of IL-6-induced activation of ERK1/2 in cardiac function remains unclear, it is clear that ERK1/2 activation is not involved in the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway nor the negative inotropic actions of IL-6 in adult ventricular myocytes. In contrast to our results, activation of ERK1/2 has been shown to be essential to the induction of iNOS expression elicited by a cytokine mixture of INF-γ and IL-1β in adult rat ventricular myocytes (44Singh K. Balligand J.L. Fischer T.A. Smith T.W. Kelly R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1111-1117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This discrepancy may result from activation of different STATs by different cytokines. For example, the combination of INF-γ and IL-1β activates STAT1α, whereas IL-6 activates primarily STAT3. The activation of STAT1α might be associated with both ERK1/2 and JAK2 activation, whereas only JAK2 is involved in STAT3 activation. In summary, both the JAK2/STAT3 and ERK1/2 pathways are activated transiently by IL-6 in adult rat ventricular myocytes. Only the activation of JAK2/STAT3 mediates the IL-6-induced increase in iNOS protein expression, increase in NO production, and decrease in cardiac contractility. Thus, the IL-6-activated JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway could account for the cardiac dysfunction observed in many cytokine-associated cardiac disorders such as acute myocardial infarction, ischemia/reperfusion, myocarditis, or cardiopulmonary bypass.

To determine the viral factor(s) potentially involved in viral persistence, we focused our work on NS2, a viral protein of unknown function. To assign a role for NS2, we searched for cellular proteins that interact with NS2. Performing a two-hybrid screen on a human liver cDNA library, we found that NS2 interacted with the liver-specific pro-apoptotic CIDE-B protein. Binding specificity of NS2 for CIDE-B was confirmed by cell-free assays associated with colocalization studies and coprecipitation experiments on human endogenous CIDE-B. CIDE-B, a member of the novel CIDE family of apoptosis-inducing factors, has been reported to show strong cell death-inducing activity in its C-terminal domain. We show that this CIDE-B killing domain is involved in the NS2 interaction. NS2 binding was sufficient to inhibit CIDE-B-induced apoptosis because an NS2 deletion mutant unable to interact with CIDE-B in vitrolost its capacity to interfere with CIDE-B cell death activity. Although it has been reported that CIDE-B-induced apoptosis is characterized by mitochondrial localization, the precise apoptotic mechanism remained unknown. Here, we show that CIDE-B induced cell death in a caspase-dependent manner through cytochromec release from mitochondria. Furthermore, we found that NS2 counteracted the cytochrome c release induced by CIDE-B.In vivo, the CIDE-B protein level was extremely low in adenovirus-infected transgenic mice expressing the HCV polyprotein compared with that in wild-type mice. We suggest that NS2 interferes with the CIDE-B-induced death pathway and participates in HCV strategies to subvert host cell defense.

J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 1833-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 2Everett H. McFadden G. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 160-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). To survive, viruses elaborate multiple protective strategies that could interfere at different levels of the process leading to cell death. The complex molecular program of apoptosis may be initiated by intrinsic or extrinsic signals. Recently, the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase PKR has been shown to play a critical role as an intracellular stimulus in mediating double-stranded RNA-induced apoptosis via the activation of the Fas-associated death domain signaling cascade (3Balachandran S. Kim C.N. Yeh W.C. Mak T.W. Bhalla K. Barber G.N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6888-6902Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 4Balachandran S. Roberts P.C. Kipperman T. Bhalla K.N. Compans R.W.

This Fas-associated death domain-mediated death signaling pathway is also activated by extrinsic signals such as Fas ligand and tumor necrosis factor-α (6Hiramatsu N. Hayashi N. Katayama K. Mochizuki K. Kawanishi Y. Kasahara A. Fusamoto H. Kamada T. Hepatology. 1994; 19: 1354-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 7Seino K. Kayagaki N. Takeda K. Fukao K. Okumura K. Yagita H.

Med. 1997; 3: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). The binding of Fas ligand to its Fas/APO-1/CD95 cell-surface death receptor triggers the activation of caspase-8, which thereupon can directly cleave procaspase-3 in its activated form (9Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4536) Google Scholar). Alternatively, caspase-8 is also able to activate Bid, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family that triggers the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (10Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3765) Google Scholar, 11Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10964-10967Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Cytosolic cytochrome c forms a complex with Apaf-1 and activates caspase-9, the substrate of which is procaspase-3 (12Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6183) Google Scholar). Then, the activated caspase-3 targets theDNA fragmentation factor, a heterodimeric protein complex consisting of the inhibitory chaperone protein DFF45 and the DFF40 nuclease (13Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar). Cleavage of DFF45 by the protease results in the release of DFF40 from its inhibited state and allows nucleosomal DNA degradation, which is the ultimate stage of apoptosis (13Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar, 14Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S.

Nagata S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 388: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Both proteins of the DNA fragmentation factor complex share a homologous region at their N terminus called the CIDE-N (cell death-inducing DFF45-likeeffector) domain. This peculiar region, involved in the interaction between DFF40 and DFF45, is also found in the novel CIDE family of cell death activators (17Inohara N. Koseki T. Chen S. Wu X. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2526-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). This common sequence explains the inhibitory control exerted by DFF45 on CIDE proteins, probably via homophilic interaction between their respective CIDE-N domains (17Inohara N. Koseki T. Chen S. Wu X. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2526-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 18Lugovskoy A.A. Zhou P. Chou J.J. McCarty J.S. Li P. Wagner G. Cell. 1999; 99: 747-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Proteins of this CIDE family differ from DFF40 by their specific C-terminal domain, called CIDE-C, which is responsible for their cell death property, which requires homodimerization and mitochondrial localization to fulfill their killing activity (17Inohara N. Koseki T. Chen S. Wu X. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2526-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar,19Chen Z. Guo K. Toh S.Y. Zhou Z. Li P. J. Biol.

Korner F. Koch J. Herian U. Theilmann L. Bartenschlager R. Science. 1999; 285: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (2480) Google Scholar, 21Bukh J. Pietschmann T. Lohmann V. Krieger N. Faulk K. Engle R.E.

Thus, until now, few data have been obtained on possible strategies used by HCV to thwart apoptosis when used as an innate cellular antiviral defense. The HCV NS5A (nonstructural 5A) protein and the E2 (envelope 2) glycoprotein were recently proposed to directly interact and inhibit the enzymatic function of the interferon-induced double-stranded RNA-dependent PKR (22Gale Jr., M.J. Korth M.J. Tang N.M. Tan S.L. Hopkins D.A. Dever T.E. Polyak S.J. Gretch D.R. Katze M.G. Virology. 1997; 230: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 23Gale Jr., M. Blakely C.M.

Romano P.R. Barber G.N. Lai M.M. Science. 1999; 285: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). This viral defense mechanism would prevent both protein synthesis inhibition, normally mediated by phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2-α (25Levin D. London I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 1121-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and apoptosis induced through the Fas-associated death domain-mediated death signaling pathway (3Balachandran S. Kim C.N.

The HCV core protein has been reported also to interfere with the Fas-mediated death signaling pathway. However, its role as an apoptosis enhancer or inhibitor is still in debate (26Ruggieri A.

Virology. 2001; 282: 26-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Interestingly, our investigations suggest that the HCV NS2 (nonstructural 2) protein intervenes in the viral defense system against apoptosis. Mature NS2 is a 23-kDa hydrophobic transmembrane protein anchored to the endoplasmic reticulum (33Santolini E. Pacini L. Fipaldini C. Migliaccio G. Monica N. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7461-7471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is generated by proteolytic processing of the HCV polypeptide in the infected cell (34Lohmann V. Koch J.O. Bartenschlager R. J. Hepatol. 1996; 24: 11-19PubMed Google Scholar). Although the biological relevance of NS2 in polypeptide processing was previously demonstrated by a study showing that a modified HCV genome (in which mutations were introduced into the NS2 sequence) encoded an HCV polypeptide that abolished its infectivity in chimpanzees (35Kolykhalov A.A. Mihalik K. Feinstone S.M. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2046-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), the biological function of the cleaved mature NS2 protein is still unknown.In this study, we identified for the first time a cellular partner of NS2, the CIDE-B protein, a member of the recently identified pro-apoptotic CIDE family. We show that CIDE-B mediates cytochromec release from mitochondria and caspase 3 activity and that NS2 acts as an inhibitor of CIDE-B-induced apoptosis. In vivo, CIDE-B was suppressed in adenovirus-infected transgenic mice expressing HCV proteins. We suggest that NS2 interferes with the CIDE-B-induced death pathway and participates in HCV strategies to subvert host cell defense.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid ConstructionsYeast Expression VectorsThe pAS2ΔΔ-NS3 and pAS2ΔΔ-NS4 vectors were a kind gift of P. Legrain (38Flajolet M. Rotondo G. Daviet L. Bergametti F. Inchauspe G. Tiollais P. Transy C. Legrain P.

The cloned HCV-H genome was provided by G. Inchauspé (51Inchauspé G. Zebedee S. Lee D.H. Sugitani M. Nasoff M. Prince A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10292-10296Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). TheNS2 gene was amplified from the HCV-H genome by PCR and subcloned into the NcoI and BamHI sites of pAS2ΔΔ (50Fromont-Racine M. Rain J.C. Legrain P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Full-length CIDE-B and deletion mutants of NS2, NS3, and CIDE-B were amplified by PCR and inserted into the NcoI and BamHI sites of vectors pAS2ΔΔ and pACT2 (Clontech, CA).GST Expression VectorsThe CIDE-B gene was amplified by PCR from the pACT2-CIDE-B vector using a 5′-primer containing a BglII site that anneals upstream of theNcoI site within the pACT2 plasmid and a 3′-primer with anEcoRI site. The digested fragment was inserted in-frame with GST into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the pGEX4T1 plasmid (Amersham Biosciences). This cloning led to the introduction of two additional restriction sites, NcoI and BamHI, which conferred to pGEX4T1 cloning compatibility with the yeast expression vectors. Thus, to generate the remaining GST vectors used in the cell-free assay, the CIDE-B gene was replaced with full-length NS2 or its deletion mutants or with mutant CIDE-B-(1–117) through direct subcloning from the yeast expression vectors into our modified pGEX4T1 vector (pGEX4T1-NB).Mammalian Expression VectorsNS2, NS2-(99–217), NS2-(140–217), or CIDE-B was subcloned into the KpnI andEcoRI sites of the pEGFP-C3 plasmid (Clontech), yielding N-terminally tagged green fluorescent protein (GFP). The same sites were used to fuse NS2 to vesicular stomatitis virus G-tagged sequence in pVM6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and CIDE-B to hemagglutinin-tagged sequence in pHM6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), yielding vectors pVM6-NS2 and pHM6-CIDE-B, respectively.

Full-length CIDE-B and its deletion mutants were inserted in-frame with FLAG downstream of the T7 promoter into theXbaI and ApaI sites of pcDNA3-FLAG. All DNA constructs were verified by DNA sequencing (Genome Express S. A.). 2Detailed information about the primers used to amplify the different coding sequences are available upon request. Yeast Two-hybrid SystemTwo-hybrid screens were performed using the Gal4BD-NS2 or Gal4BD-NS2-(99–217) expression plasmid and the human liver cDNA library fused to Gal4AD in the pACT2 vector (HL4024AH, Clontech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Interaction specificity was verified by a mating strategy as described previously (50Fromont-Racine M. Rain J.C. Legrain P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Positive clones were isolated, and interaction specificity was checked for a second time by a cotransforming approach (52Erdtmann L. Janvier K. Raposo G. Craig H.M. Benaroch P. Berlioz-Torrent C.

Cells were homogenized in a Dounce glass homogenizer (B pestle) and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove intact cells and nuclei. Supernatants were centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 25 min at 4 °C to separate mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions. The mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of fractionation buffer, and protein concentration were determined by the Bradford method. A total of 30 μg of mitochondrial protein were subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using anti-cytochrome c antibody H104 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).To immunoprecipitate cytosolic cytochrome c, 800 μg of protein issued from each cytosolic fraction were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with anti-cytochrome c antibody 6H2.B4 (Pharmingen) and 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were washed, and bound cellular proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-cytochrome cantibody H104.Caspase Activity AssayCOS-7 cells were transfected with 2 μg of pEGFP or pHM6-CIDE-B vector, harvested at 24 h, and lysed in caspase activity buffer (56Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25719-25723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). One-hundred micrograms of crude cell lysate were incubated with 80 μmsubstrate-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin for 1 h at 37 °C. Caspase-mediated cleavage of DEVD-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin was measured by spectrofluorometry (Molecular Devices) at an excitation/emission wavelength pair of 380/440 nm. Caspase activity is indicated inVmax values.HCV Transgenic MiceTransgenic mice with liver-specific expression of RNA encoding the complete viral polyprotein were produced as described (42Lerat H.

Crude protein extract from 0.5 μg of liver powder was tested for β-galactosidase activity using the luminescent β-galactosidase assay (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Liver protein extracts were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using anti-CIDE-B antibody E-19 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To ensure comparable loading of the samples, the blot was incubated with anti-annexin V antibody (kind gift of F. Russo-Marie). Specific bands were quantified by scanning the autoradiographs with a Shimadzu densitometer.Data AnalysisStatistical analysis was performed using Student's ttest for unpaired data. Data were considered to be significant atp < 0.05 and p < 0.01.DISCUSSIONChronic HCV infection frequently leads to liver cancer. Because the liver is the major HCV replication site, HCV seems to have developed strategies to promote its survival in this organ. This study points out the interaction between the viral NS2 protein and liver-specific CIDE-B, a cellular protein involved in apoptosis, as a mechanism contributing to the prevention of apoptosis. The interaction of NS2 with CIDE-B was evidenced by yeast two-hybrid and cell-free assays associated with colocalization studies and coprecipitation experiments of human endogenous CIDE-B. The NS2-binding site was determined to be the CIDE-B cell death domain. This binding is sufficient to inhibit CIDE-B-induced apoptosis because an NS2 deletion mutant unable to interact with CIDE-B in vitrolost its capacity to interfere with CIDE-B cell death activity. Additional interest is provided by the binding specificity for CIDE-B. Indeed, CIDE-A, the second member of the CIDE protein family, which presents a widespread tissue distribution except in the liver (17Inohara N. Koseki T. Chen S. Wu X. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2526-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), does not bind to NS2 (data not shown).The pro-apoptotic CIDE-B protein can be divided into two distinct domains: the N-terminal (CIDE-N) and C-terminal (CIDE-C) domains. The CIDE-N domain shares homology with the N-terminal regions of DFF40 and DFF45, a nuclease and its inhibitor, respectively. The CIDE-B C-terminal region is necessary and sufficient for the intrinsic apoptotic activity of CIDE proteins (17Inohara N. Koseki T. Chen S. Wu X. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2526-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we determined that the interaction of NS2 takes place within the CIDE-B C-terminal domain, whereas this domain is also involved in the homodimerization of CIDE-B (this study and Ref. 19Chen Z. Guo K. Toh S.Y. Zhou Z. Li P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22619-22622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In addition, tyrosine 160 in the CIDE-B C-terminal domain is necessary for both CIDE-B dimerization and NS2 interaction, suggesting a putative binding competition between NS2 and CIDE-B for CIDE-B itself. Because homodimerization is required for CIDE-B cell death activity, we suggest that NS2 binding might affect CIDE-B-induced apoptosis by interfering with its dimerization.Although apoptosis induced by the CIDE proteins has been characterized by DNA fragmentation and counting of adherent cells undergoing apoptosis (17Inohara N. Koseki T. Chen S. Wu X. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2526-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanism supporting this biological effect has not been completely elucidated. The requirement of CIDE-B homodimerization and its mitochondrial localization for cell death induction has been recently reported (19Chen Z. Guo K. Toh S.Y. Zhou Z. Li P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22619-22622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Here, we analyzed"

To gain insight into the deleterious effects of hyperinsulinemia on skeletal muscle, we studied the consequences of prolonged insulin treatment of L6 myoblasts on insulin-dependent signaling pathways. A 24-h long insulin treatment desensitized the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (PKB) and p42/p44 MAPK pathways toward a second stimulation with insulin or insulin-like growth factor-1 and led to decreased insulin-induced glucose uptake. Desensitization was correlated to a reduction in insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and IRS-2 protein levels, which was reversed by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. Co-treatment of cells with insulin and LY294002, while reducing total IRS-1 phosphorylation, increased its phosphotyrosine content, enhancing IRS-1/PI3K association. PDK1, mTOR, and MAPK inhibitors did not block insulin-induced reduction of IRS-1, suggesting that the PI3K serine-kinase activity causes IRS-1 serine phosphorylation and its commitment to proteasomal degradation. Contrarily, insulin-induced IRS-2 down-regulation occurred via a PI3K/mTOR pathway. Suppression of IRS-1/2 down-regulation by LY294002 rescued the responsiveness of PKB and MAPK toward acute insulin stimulation. Conversely, adenoviral-driven expression of constitutively active PI3K induced an insulin-independent reduction in IRS-1/2 protein levels. IRS-2 appears to be the chief molecule responsible for MAPK and PKB activation by insulin, as knockdown of IRS-2 (but not IRS-1) by RNA interference severely impaired activation of both kinases. In summary, (i) PI3K mediates insulin-induced reduction of IRS-1 by phosphorylating it while a PI3K/mTOR pathway controls insulin-induced reduction of IRS-2, (ii) in L6 cells, IRS-2 is the major adapter molecule linking the insulin receptor to activation of PKB and MAPK, (iii) the mechanism of IRS-1/2 down-regulation is different in L6 cells compared with 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In conclusion, the reduction in IRS proteins via different PI3K-mediated mechanisms contributes to the development of an insulin-resistant state in L6 myoblasts.

Initial peripheral insulin resistance, i.e. the failure of adipose and muscle tissues to properly dispose of circulating glucose, and the failure of liver to control glucose production, is compensated by increased insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells, leading to hyperinsulinemia. In the long-term, β-cell failure to compensate for peripheral insulin resistance leads to type 2 diabetes (1Saltiel A.R. Cell. 2001; 104: 517-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Hyperinsulinemia, in association with increased circulating levels of fatty acids (2Kraegen E.W. Cooney G.J. Ye J. Thompson A.L. Exp. Clin. Endocrinol. Diabetes. 2001; 109: 516-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), which exacerbate peripheral insulin resistance, is thought to be a major factor contributing to progression to type 2 diabetes. Activation of the insulin receptor (IR)1 by hormone binding activates a number of cellular responses such as translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 to the plasma membrane in muscle and adipocytes (3Pessin J.E. Thurmond D.C. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K.J. Okada S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2593-2596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), hepatic glycogen synthesis (4Bollen M. Keppens S. Stalmans W. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), lipogenesis (5Kersten S. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), and modulation of gene expression (6O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1109-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Insulin signaling is initiated by the recruitment of intracellular molecules to the activated receptor and their ensuing tyrosine phosphorylation. These molecules include IRS-1/2/3/4, Cbl, and the adapter proteins Shc (7White M.F. Diabetologia. 1997; 40 Suppl. 2: S2-S17Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated IRSs then engage the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) p85/p110 heterodimer by binding the SH2 domains of the p85 adapter to specific pYMXM motifs (8Backer J.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Shoelson S.E. Chin D.J. Sun X.J. Miralpeix M. Hu P. Margolis B. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3469-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). Once captured by IRS, PI3K becomes activated and produces the lipid second messenger phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, which stimulates the serine/threonine kinase cascade PDK-1-PKB/Akt-p70 S6 kinase (9Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 965-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). PKB/Akt and p70 S6 kinase are downstream kinases central to insulin action (10Alessi D.R. Downes C.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), the former controlling GLUT4 translocation, glycogen synthesis, and protein synthesis (11Hajduch E. Alessi D.R. Hemmings B.A. Hundal H.S. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), and the latter being a key regulator of the growth promoting action of insulin (12Blume-Jensen P. Hunter T. Nature. 2001; 411: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (3161) Google Scholar). Other SH2 domain containing proteins, including Grb2, SHP-2, and Nck associate with IRS to mediate insulin responses. In particular, Grb2 links insulin receptor activation to the p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade (7White M.F. Diabetologia. 1997; 40 Suppl. 2: S2-S17Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The occurrence of insulin-induced peripheral insulin resistance has been attributed to impairment of the tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor, based on biochemical studies performed on skeletal muscle biopsies from type 2 diabetic patients (13Arner P. Pollare T. Lithell H. Livingston J.N. Diabetologia. 1987; 30: 437-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 14Nolan J.J. Freidenberg G. Henry R. Reichart D. Olefsky J.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

However, these findings have been disputed by reports showing normal insulin receptor function, despite downstream metabolic abnormalities (16Krook A. Bjornholm M. Galuska D. Jiang X.J. Fahlman R. Myers Jr., M.G. Wallberg-Henriksson H. Zierath J.R. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 17Caro J.F. Sinha M.K. Raju S.M. Ittoop O. Pories W.J. Flickinger E.G.

Diabetes. 1995; 44: 1310-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Recently, the elucidation of the signaling pathways emanating from the activated insulin receptor (10Alessi D.R. Downes C.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 19Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar) has paved the way for several studies demonstrating that intracellular signaling molecules also substantially contribute to the insulin-resistant phenotype. IRS-1 protein levels have been shown to be decreased in 3T3-L1 adipocytes chronically exposed to insulin (20Rice K.M. Turnbow M.A. Garner C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 961-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). IRS-1 degradation is triggered by serine/threonine phosphorylation, and is blocked by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (21Pederson T.M. Kramer D.L. Rondinone C.M. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 22Smith L.K. Vlahos C.J. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Garner C.W. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 113: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). PI3K may control IRS-1 serine/threonine phosphorylation either via the action of downstream serine/threonine kinases, such as mTOR, GSK-3, and atypical protein kinase Cs, which ultimately phosphorylate IRS-1 (23Eldar-Finkelman H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9660-9664Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 24Ozes O.N. Akca H. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Maehama T. Dixon J.E. Donner D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4640-4645Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), or by directly phosphorylating IRS-1 via its intrinsic protein kinase activity (25Tanti J.F. Gremeaux T. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 26Pirola L. Zvelebil M.J. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Van Obberghen E. Waterfield M.D. Wymann M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21544-21554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Once serine/threonine phosphorylated, IRS-1 degradation occurs via the proteasome degradation pathway (27Sun X.J. Goldberg J.L. Qiao L.Y. Mitchell J.J. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1359-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In keeping with these studies in cultured cells, is the finding that IRS-1 protein expression is reduced in adipocytes from patients with type 2 diabetes (28Rondinone C.M. Wang L.M. Lonnroth P. Wesslau C. Pierce J.H. Smith U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4171-4175Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) as well as in subjects suffering from insulin resistance (29Carvalho E. Jansson P.A. Axelsen M. Eriksson J.W. Huang X. Groop L. Rondinone C. Sjostrom L. Smith U. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2173-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Recently, proteasome-mediated IRS-2 degradation has also been demonstrated in insulin/IGF-1-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, Fao hepatoma cells, and mouse embryo fibroblasts (30Rui L. Fisher T.L. Thomas J. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40362-40367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Downstream of IRS proteins, other insulin signaling molecules have been reported to be deregulated in insulin-induced insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes. PKB activation is decreased in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue from db/db mice as compared with non-diabetic controls (31Shao J. Yamashita H. Qiao L. Friedman J.E. J. Endocrinol. 2000; 167: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). GLUT4 expression is lower in insulin-resistant individuals (32Carvalho E. Jansson P.A. Nagaev I. Wenthzel A.M. Smith U. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1101-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and in L6 myotubes overexpressing the transporter GLUT4, the insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane is reduced after sustained exposure to high glucose and insulin (33Huang C. Somwar R. Patel N. Niu W. Torok D. Klip A. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2090-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Thus, deterioration of the insulin receptor-signaling pathway at different levels accounts for the evolution from an insulin-resistant state to type 2 diabetes. Here we evaluate the changes in insulin signaling pathways after a prolonged exposure of L6 muscle cells to insulin and we investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms. We demonstrate that, upon prolonged insulin treatment (mimicking hyperinsulinemia), both the PI3K/PKB and the MAPK signaling cascades are down-regulated and cellular levels of the two major insulin receptor docking proteins, IRS-1 and IRS-2, are decreased. Finally, we show that PI3K/PKB and MAPK down-regulation is causally related to the decrease in IRS-1/2, that PI3K is a key upstream molecule controlling IRS-1/2 degradation via different mechanisms, and that IRS-2 appears to be the functionally most relevant adapter in insulin signal transmission in L6 cells.

L6 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin, 100 units/ml, and streptomycin, 100 μg/ml (Invitrogen). Cells were seeded in 6-well plates for Western blotting experiments or in 10-cm diameter plates for immunoprecipitation experiments. 24-h insulin treatments were started at 70–80% confluence in serum-free medium. After treatment with insulin or inhibitors, cells were lysed in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, 138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm sodium-o-vanadate, 20 μmleupeptin, 18 μm pepstatin, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaF, pH 8.0; 0.4 ml/plate for 6-well plates and 1 ml/plate for 10-cm diameter plates). Lysates were kept on ice for 15 min and the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min. Protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad colorimetric assay (Bio-Rad). Cell lysates (10 μg of protein) were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and blocked in 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Membranes were probed with anti-phospho-Ser-473 PKB (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), anti-PKB (provided by B. Hemmings, FMI, Basel, Switzerland), anti-phospho-MAPK p42/p44, anti-MAPK p42/p44 (Promega, Madison, WI), anti-IRS-1, anti-IRS-2, 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), and anti-IR β-subunit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) antibodies. The proteins were detected by ECL after incubation of the membranes with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Signal intensities were measured with NIH Image after scanning of non-saturated Eastman Kodak Biomax MR-1 films (Sigma). For immunoprecipitation, lysates were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with polyclonal antibodies to IRS-1 or to IR β-subunit, followed by addition of protein A-Sepharose and further incubation for 2 h. Immune complexes were washed twice with buffer A and then solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer. If subjected to a PI3K assay, immune complexes were washed twice with buffer A, twice with 0.1 mTris-HCl, 0.5 m LiCl, pH 7.4, and twice with lipid kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) prior to PI3K assay, which was performed on IRS-1 immunoprecipitates as described (26Pirola L.

Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4657-4663Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). When at 70–80% confluence, L6 myoblasts (one 10-cm diameter plate/condition) were incubated for 24 h in 5 ml of phosphate-free DMEM in the presence of 1 μm insulin and inhibitors as described in figure legends. Cells were labeled for the last 3 h with 0.5 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate and IRS-1-associated radioactivity was evaluated in IRS-1 immunoprecipitates by SDS-PAGE separation followed by phosphorimaging of the dried gel. Adenoviruses expressing p110α CAAX and IRS-1 were generated by homologous recombination in Escherichia coli BJ 5183. Co-transformation of E. coli BJ 5183 led to recombination between p110α CAAX (wild type and the kinase-dead K802R (35Wymann M.P. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Zvelebil M.J. Pirola L. Vanhaesebroeck B.

Recombinants were screened by PCR analysis with a pair of primers that annealed to the viral vector and cytomegalovirus promoter sequence, respectively. A positive clone harboring p110α CAAX (wt and KR) and IRS-1 was further amplified in E. coli DH5α, digested with PacI, and transfected by the calcium phosphate method into helper 293 cells to produce viral particles. Adenoviruses were purified by ultracentrifugation on CsCl gradient and stored in 0.1 mTris, 0.25 m NaCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50% (v/v) glycerol, pH 7.5 at −20 °C. Viral titer of stocks was >108 plaque-forming units/ml. Total RNA was extracted from cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). 15 μg of RNA were resolved by electrophoresis on a 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel. RNA was transferred to a BrightStar-Plus positively charged nylon membrane (Ambion, Austin, TX). Probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random primer labeling kit (Rediprime kit) and purified with a Probe Quant kit (both from Amersham Biosciences). The probes encompassed the full-length coding regions of GLUT1, PKB, and IRS-1. Hybridization was performed at 68 °C in ExpressHyb hybridization solution (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), as per the manufacturer's instructions. Blots were exposed for 24 h at −70 °C or visualized by phosphorimaging. For RNA interference experiments, L6 were grown in DMEM + 10% (v/v) FCS in 24-wells plates. At >60% confluence medium was replaced with 300 μl of DMEM + 5% (v/v) FCS and cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method with double stranded RNA oligonucleotides at a concentration of 50 nm (Proligo, Dusseldorf, Germany). Briefly, 0.3 μl of 50 μm dsRNA oligonucleotides were mixed with 7.5 μl of water, 7.5 μl of calcium solution (0.5m CaCl2, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0), and 15 μl of phosphate solution (0.075 mmNa2HPO4, 0.075 mmNaH2PO4, 0.28 m NaCl, 0.05m HEPES, pH 7.0). The mixture was left for 10 min at room temperature to form a precipitate and subsequently added to the cells. Medium was replaced 12–16 h later with DMEM + 5% (v/v) FCS. Prior to insulin treatment, cells were starved overnight in DMEM. In L6, RNA interference (RNAi) occurred after calcium phosphate transfection, but not after transfection with FuGENE or simple addition of short interfering double stranded RNA (siRNA) to the culture medium. DsRNA oligonucleotides used in this study encompassed nucleotides 895–913 and 1180–1198 of the published IRS-1 (X58375) and IRS-2 (XM146235) sequences. Two deoxythymine residues were added 3′ to each strand. DsRNAs annealing was done in annealing buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8) by heating the complementary single-stranded RNAs at 90 °C for 2 min followed by slow cooling to <30 °C. To investigate the alterations in intracellular signaling caused by a prolonged insulin treatment in muscle cells, L6 myoblasts were exposed for 24 h to increasing insulin concentrations, followed or not by a second treatment with 1 μm hormone for 10 min. To evaluate the activation of the PI3K and the MAPK signaling, IRS-1-associated PI3K activity was assayed in IRS-1 immunoprecipitates, and MAPK activation was evaluated by immunoblotting with antibodies to phospho-MAPK. Responsiveness of both PI3K and MAPK to a 10-min exposure to 1 μm insulin was diminished to a similar extent, and in a dose-dependent manner, in cells subjected to a 24-h insulin pre-treatment (Fig. 1,A and B, empty bars), indicating desensitization of the insulin signaling pathways. On the contrary, whereas an IRS-1-associated PI3K activity could be detected after the 24-h insulin treatment, no residual MAPK activity was present (Fig. 1,A and B, full bars). Thus, insulin chronically activates PI3K at a submaximal level, although MAPK activation is transient and becomes undetectable after 4 h insulin stimulation (data not shown). To determine whether IRS-1-associated PI3K activity relays a downstream signal in intact cells, we next evaluated the activation of PKB by immunoblotting with antibodies to the active form of PKB (Ser-473 PKB). PKB activation paralleled IRS-1-associated PI3K activity under all the conditions tested (Fig. 2, Aand B). Likewise, p70 S6 kinase activation showed an activation pattern similar to that of PKB, as judged by insulin-induced band shift (data not shown). A time course evaluation of the decline in insulin responsiveness of PKB and MAPK demonstrated that the down-regulation of both signaling pathways occurred in a time-dependent fashion, with the MAPK signaling being down-regulated more rapidly than PKB (Fig. 2 C). The correlation between the IRS-1-associated PI3K activity and the PKB, p70 S6 kinase activation levels observed indicates that the IRS-1-associated PI3K activity mirrors the PI3K activity in vivo. Furthermore, a 24-h insulin treatment, although provoking a ≈2-fold increase in glucose uptake, as also shown with higher fold in L6 myotubes (37Somwar R. Sweeney G. Ramlal T. Klip A. Clin. Ther. 1998; 20: 125-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), lead to a decreased insulin-induced [3H]2-deoxyglucose uptake following an acute insulin treatment. This is shown by the ratio between the glucose uptake measured with and without an acute insulin treatment following the 24-h chronic treatment (Fig. 2 D). Down-regulation of insulin signaling has been proposed to result from alterations in both insulin receptor and postreceptor signaling (38Heydrick S.J. Jullien D. Gautier N. Tanti J.F. Giorgetti S. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1358-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether the down-regulation observed in PI3K/PKB and MAPK signaling was because of insulin-induced IR degradation we quantified the total amount of IR in starved or 24-h insulin-treated L6 myoblasts by immunoblotting with antibodies to IR. As already reported in myotubes (33Huang C. Somwar R. Patel N. Niu W. Torok D. Klip A. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2090-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), the IR levels and insulin-induced IR tyrosine phosphorylation decreased by ∼50% as compared with untreated cells following a 24-h exposure to 1 μm insulin (Fig.3). Given that low receptor occupancy can be sufficient to relay a biological effect (39Trischitta V. Wong K.Y. Brunetti A. Scalisi R. Vigneri R. Goldfine I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5041-5046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), deregulation of intracellular component(s) of the insulin signaling cascade might also contribute to the observed down-regulation. L6 myoblasts express both insulin and IGF-I receptors with a prevalence of IGF-1 receptors (40Beguinot F. Kahn C.R. Moses A.C. Smith R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15892-15898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the insulin receptor mainly exists as a hybrid (αβα′β′) with the IGF-I receptor. To evaluate whether L6 myoblasts respond similarly to a prolonged insulin or IGF-I pretreatment, cells were stimulated with increasing concentrations of either insulin (0–103nm range) or IGF-I (0–102 nmrange) for 24 h, followed by a 10-min treatment with either 1 μm insulin or 100 nm IGF-I. We observed a down-regulation of PKB and MAPK after prolonged insulin treatment, irrespective of the ligand used for the second exposure (insulin or IGF-1, Fig. 4 A). Likewise, a 24-h pretreatment with IGF-1 induced a desensitization of PKB and MAPK when cells were subsequently exposed for a further 10 min to either insulin or IGF-I (Fig. 4 B). Given the presence of insulin/IGF-1 hybrid receptors in L6 cells and the responsiveness of IGF-1R to insulin at high concentrations, the 24-h exposure to insulin at the highest concentration (i.e. 103nm) might lead to PKB and MAPK down-regulation by acting on both receptors. Nevertheless, PKB and MAPK down-regulation was already occurring upon 24 h exposure to 10–102 nminsulin (with no or little interference with IGF-1R activation) and to 1–10 nm IGF-1 (with no or little interference with IR activation, Fig. 4, A and B). Given that (i) down-regulation is already caused by exposure to low insulin/IGF-1 concentrations, and (ii) prolonged exposure to insulin diminishes acute IGF-1 signaling and vice versa, we suggest that a down-regulation event takes place at a postreceptor level. Whereas cross-reactivity occurs between insulin and IGF-1 toward their corresponding receptors, FCS and PDGF are not known to interfere with IR or IGF-1R. Consistent with this, MAPK activation by FCS was sustained after a 24-h insulin pretreatment (Fig. 4 C), indicating that, after prolonged insulin/IGF-1 exposure, the PI3K/PDK-1 and Raf-MEK signaling modules remain responsive to treatment by agonists other than insulin/IGF-1. Because PKB and MAPK are targets of virtually all activated receptor-tyrosine kinases, we evaluated whether insulin signaling down-regulation is specifically achieved by insulin/IGF-1 pre-exposure or if it could also be caused by prolonged exposure to an unrelated receptor-tyrosine kinase agonist. When we exposed cells for 24 h to PDGF and subsequently treated acutely with either insulin or PDGF, we observed homologous desensitization of PKB and MAPK (complete and ≈50%, respectively) after PDGF treatment, but no down-regulation of insulin signaling (Fig. 4 D). This indicates that down-regulation of insulin signaling strictly depends on a prior perturbation of the proximal insulin/IGF-1 receptor signaling pathway. Previous studies on Zucker fatty rats and ob/ob mice, an hyperinsulinemic and insulin-resistant rodent models, respectively, show decreased IRS-1 expression levels in skeletal muscle (41Saad M.J.

Katagiri H. Fukushima Y. Yazaki Y. Kikuchi M. Oka Y. Asano T. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Likewise, IRS-1 was found to be down-regulated in adipose tissue from diabetic patients (28Rondinone C.M. Wang L.M. Lonnroth P. Wesslau C. Pierce J.H. Smith U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4171-4175Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and in 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated chronically with insulin (43Ricort J.M. Tanti J.F. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y.

Here, we describe a native peptide ligation strategy for generating nucleosomal arrays that can harbor a wide range of desired histone modifications. As a first test of this method, we engineered model nucleosomal arrays in which each histone H3 contains a phosphorylated serine at position 10 and performed kinetic analyses of Gcn5-dependent histone acetyltransferase activities. Recombinant Gcn5 shows increased histone acetyltransferase activity on nucleosomal arrays harboring phosphorylated H3 serine 10 and is consistent with peptide studies. However, in contrast to analyses using peptide substrates, we find that the histone acetyltransferase activity of the Gcn5-containing SAGA complex is not stimulated by H3 phosphorylation in the context of nucleosomal arrays.

N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl high pressure liquid chromatography dithiothreitol matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight Histone proteins, the core protein components of nucleosomes, play a central role in controlling a wide range of DNA-dependent processes, including gene expression, DNA repair, and DNA replication (1Wu J. Grunstein M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 619-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). How histones modulate these processes appears to be dictated in part by their wide range of post-translational modifications, including acetylation, phosphorylation, methylation, ribosylation, and ubiquitination (1Wu J. Grunstein M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 619-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 2Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6507) Google Scholar). Many of these modifications are found to occur simultaneously, suggesting the potential for sequential or combinatorial interactions that may act synergistically or antagonistically to regulate downstream biological effects (2Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6507) Google Scholar). For instance, previous studies have used small peptide substrates to demonstrate that phosphorylation of serine 10 within histone H3 enhances the ability of yeast Gcn5p to acetylate lysine residues within the same histone N-terminal domain (3Lo W.S.

Small peptides encompassing a histone N-terminal tail that contain very specific and homogeneous modifications can be synthesized, and such substrates have played a key role in understanding the potential roles of histone modifications (3Lo W.S.

However, peptides lack the more complex determinants of nucleosomes, such as DNA and multiple histone tails, which are likely to play an important role in their biological functions. Similarly, nucleosomes purified from extracts or treated enzymatically can provide more physiologically relevant substrates, but such nucleosomes lack homogeneous patterns of modifications.Here we describe a native chemical ligation strategy that permits the reconstitution of nucleosomal arrays that harbor a wide range of individual or combinations of histone modifications, including serine phosphorylation, lysine acetylation, and lysine methylation. In this method, solid phase peptide synthesis is used to generate a histone N-terminal tail domain that contains modified amino acids at any desired location. Native ligation chemistry is used to assemble full-length recombinant histone, which is reconstituted into histone octamers and subsequently assembled into nucleosomal arrays. We describe the first test of this method in which we have engineered model nucleosomal arrays harboring a phosphorylated serine at position 10 of each histone H3 protein.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONGenerating full-length histone proteins by native ligation chemistry requires two components: (i) an N-terminal protein fragment that terminates with a C-terminal thioester, and (ii) a C-terminal protein fragment that begins with an N-terminal cysteine residue (Fig.1) (13Blaschke U.K. Silberstein J. Muir T.W. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 478-496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mixing these two components initiates a two-step chemical reaction producing a full-length ligated product in which the N-terminal fragment is linked to the C-terminal fragment via a canonical peptide bond (13Blaschke U.K. Silberstein J. Muir T.W. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 478-496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Synthesis of N-terminal Histone H3 Peptide FragmentsSince most histone H3 post-translational modifications occur within the first 28 amino acids (2Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6507) Google Scholar), standard Fmoc-based, solid-phase peptide synthesis can be used to create histone N-terminal domains (1–31) that contain a wide range of modifications in this region. For these experiments we chose to study serine or phosphoserine incorporated at position 10 of H3. To install the desired C-terminal thioester residue, a strategy of selectively exposing and modifying the peptide C terminus was utilized (14Futaki S. Sogawa K. Maruyama J. Asahara T. Niwa M. Hojo H. Tetrahedron Lett. 1997; 38: 6237-6240Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Initial solid-phase peptide synthesis on an acid-hypersensitive resin allows cleavage of the peptides from the resin with weak acid, selectively unmasking the C terminus, which can then be selectively derivatized to generate a thioester. Side chain deprotection with strong acid followed by HPLC was sufficient to generate the desired unphosphorylated H3 peptide fragment in pure form (Fig. 2 A). Because some dephosphorylation occurred during the synthetic process, an additional metal affinity purification step was used to obtain homogeneous, phosphorylated H3 peptide (7Muszynska G. Dobrowolska G. Medin A. Ekman P. Porath J.O. J. Chromatog. 1992; 604: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The identity of the peptides was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry, and their purity demonstrated by analytical HPLC (data not shown).Figure 2Phosphorylated and unphosphorylated histone H3 produced by native chemical ligation is competent for incorporation into histone octamers. A, SDS-PAGE analysis of histone H3 ligation. A ligation reaction (lane 4) containing synthetic unphosphorylated N-terminal histone H3 peptide (lane 2) and cysteine-containing C-terminal histone H3 protein (lane 3) analyzed on an 18% SDS-PAGE gel stained with Coomassie Blue. Lane 1 contains wild type recombinant histone H3. The highest molecular weight band shows the expected mass when analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectral analysis (adjacent graph). Right panel shows an SDS-PAGE of recombinantXenopus H3 (lane 5), the purified, ligated, unphosphorylated H3 (T32C-H3; lane 6) and phosphorylated H3 (S10Phos-H3; lane 7) proteins. B, SDS-PAGE analysis of histone octamers containing ligated histone H3. Column fractions from the gel filtration purification of recombinant histone octamers assembled with either T32C-H3 or S10Phos-H3 analyzed on an 18% SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Blue. Note that octamers assembled from non-ligated histones elute in the same fractions and thatXenopus histones H2A and H2B are not resolved under standard SDS-PAGE conditions. C, mass spectral analysis of histone octamers containing S10Phos-H3. The masses of the constituent components of histone octamers assembled with recombinantXenopus H2A, H2B, H4, and S10Phos-H3 were determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectral analysis and correspond to the expected mass of each histone subunit. The largest molecular weight histone, S10Phos-H3, is enlarged in the left inset to demonstrate the homogeneity of phosphorylation. For comparison, the right inset shows a mixture of roughly equal amounts of S10Phos-H3 and T32C-H3 histone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)C-terminal H3 Protein FragmentSince the C-terminal fragment of histone H3 must contain an N-terminal cysteine residue, we used site-directed mutagenesis of a Xenopus histone H3 bacterial expression construct to replace the threonine codon at position 32 with a cysteine codon. Importantly, this T32C substitution is not expected to disrupt nucleosome structure since Thr-32 is located outside the structured domain of the histone octamer (15Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6795) Google Scholar) and is not well conserved among eukaryotes. Because the N-terminal methionine of recombinantly expressed proteins is not readily removed, a minimal Factor Xa cleavage site was also introduced directly N-terminal to the cysteine at position 32. Consequently, cleavage of purified, recombinant T32C histone H3 with Factor Xa exposes the N-terminal cysteine. Reversed-phase HPLC was used to isolate the desired C-terminal H3 protein fragment (32–135). The identity and purity of this fragment was confirmed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 A) and MALDI-TOF mass spectral analysis (data not shown).H3 Protein LigationFull-length unphosphorylated (T32C-H3) and Ser-10 phosphorylated histone H3 (S10Phos-H3) polypeptides were generated by mixing the N-terminal peptide and C-terminal protein fragments under denaturing conditions in the presence of thiol reagents (9Dawson P.E. Churchill M.J. Ghadiri M.R. Kent S.B.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 4325-4329Crossref Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 13Blaschke U.K. Silberstein J. Muir T.W. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 478-496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Note the S10Phos-H3 polypeptide also contains the T32C amino acid change. Successful chemical ligation was monitored by SDS-PAGE, which detected formation of a protein product that co-migrates with recombinant wild-type Xenopus histone H3 (Fig.2 A). Further analysis of the T32C-H3 reaction mixture by MALDI-TOF revealed that the mass of the largest molecular weight species corresponds to the expected mass for full-length T32C histone H3 (Fig. 2 A). Because the ligation reactions were performed under conditions of excess peptide and because the reaction proceeds to roughly 50% completion, ion exchange chromatography was used to purify the ligated products to homogeneity (Fig. 2 A).Octamer and Nucleosome AssemblyTo generate histone octamer containing either the ligated T32C-H3 or S10Phos-H3, the ligated H3 proteins were denatured and mixed with denatured, recombinantXenopus histones H4, H2A, and H2B in equal ratios, and the renatured histone octamers were isolated by gel filtration as described previously (8Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Richmond T.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 119: 1-16PubMed Google Scholar). No significant differences in the efficiency of octamer reconstitution were detected when ligated T32C-H3 or S10Phos-H3 histones were substituted for wild-type H3 (Fig. 2 B). To make certain that S10Phos-H3 was not dephosphorylated during the course of octamer assembly or purification, MALDI-TOF mass spectral analysis was performed on the purified octamer (Fig. 2 C). Each of the four different histone polypeptides was detected, and the largest molecular weight component corresponds to the expected mass of the singly phosphorylated histone H3. Moreover, no dephosphorylated H3 was detectable, confirming that this histone octamer is homogeneous for H3 serine 10 phosphorylation.Chicken erythrocyte or recombinant Xenopus histone octamers were used to assemble model nucleosomal arrays using a DNA template composed of eleven head to tail repeats of a 208-bp 5 S rRNA gene from Lytechinus variegatus (the 208–11 template; see Fig. 3 A; (16Logie C. Peterson C.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6772-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar)). Each 5 S repeat can rotationally and translationally position a nucleosome afterin vitro salt dialysis reconstitution, yielding a positioned array of nucleosomes (17Dong F. Hansen J.C. van Holde K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5724-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). This 208–11 template also contains a uniqueSalI restriction enzyme site in the central repeat of the array (see Fig. 3 A; (16Logie C. Peterson C.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6772-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar)). To monitor nucleosome assembly, we digested the reconstituted nucleosomal arrays with EcoRI. Since each 5 S rDNA repeat in the 208–11 array template is bordered byEcoRI restriction sites (Fig. 3 A), cleavage releases either a 208-bp free DNA fragment or a mononucleosome that can be identified due to its slower mobility after native gel electrophoresis. Comparison of the resolved digestion products (Fig.3 B) indicates that octamers containing either ligated T32C-H3 or S10Phos-H3 can be incorporated into the DNA template with efficiencies similar to that of chicken erythrocyte or wild-type (Thr-32) recombinant octamers (Fig. 3 B and data not shown). Additionally, increasing ratios of ligated T32C-H3-containing octamer to DNA template results in an expected increase in array saturation as demonstrated by the increase of mononucleosome and oligonucleosome products relative to free DNA. Together these results suggest that octamers generated from ligated histones are competent to form nucleosomal arrays.Figure 3Nucleosomal arrays containing serine 10 phosphorylated or unphosphorylated histone H3 are equivalently remodeled by SWI/SNF. A, schematic of the 208–11 nucleosomal array template. The DNA template utilized is composed of eleven 208-bp head-to-tail repeats of a 5 S rDNA gene. Flanking the repeats are EcoRI restrictions sites. The central repeat contains a unique SalI restriction site. B, characterization of nucleosomal arrays containing ligated histones. Nucleosomal arrays were digested with EcoRI, electrophoresed on a native 4% polyacrylamide gel, and then stained with ethidium bromide. T32C-H3 nucleosomal arrays prepared with increasing ratios of histone octamer to template DNA are compared. Nucleosome free DNA is labeled Naked, while mononucleosomes are labeledNuc. C, SWI/SNF-mediated remodeling of nucleosomal arrays containing ligated histone H3. ATP-dependent remodeling assays were performed with purified yeast SWI/SNF complex (2–6 nm), SalI (2.5 units/μl), and radiolabeled nucleosomal arrays (1 nm) containing recombinant Xenopus H3 (filled circles), T32C-H3 (open circles), or S10Phos-H3 (filled squares). Assays were initiated with ATP (solid lines) and compared with control reactions lacking ATP (dashed lines). DNA was extracted from samples taken over the course of the remodeling assay and subjected to gel electrophoresis. The fraction of uncut array (top graph) was determined by quantification of cut and uncut DNA template using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant version 1.2 (Molecular Dynamics). The amount of array remodeled (bottom graph) was calculated from the difference between the amount of cut array in the presence and absence of ATP. Assays were performed three independent times with a representative experiment shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)SWI/SNF-dependent Remodeling of S10Phos-H3 Nucleosomal ArraysRestriction enzyme accessibility assays were performed to further characterize the nucleosomal arrays containing ligated histones and to investigate whether ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling by yeast SWI/SNF might be influenced by H3-serine 10 phosphorylation. Radiolabeled nucleosomal arrays containing chicken octamer, recombinant wild-type Xenopus H3, and ligated T32C-H3 and S10Phos-H3 were prepared and characterized byEcoRI digestion (data not shown). Arrays with a similar degree of nucleosome saturation were then subjected to digestion withSalI, which yields a quantitative measurement of the accessibility of DNA within the central nucleosome (Fig. 3 A) (16Logie C. Peterson C.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6772-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In the absence of ATP, nucleosomal arrays reconstituted with ligated histones exhibited nearly identical occlusion of theSalI site compared with arrays reconstituted with wild-type recombinant or chicken octamers (Fig. 3 and data not shown). Thus, the DNA wrapped onto ligated histone octamers does not appear to be inherently more accessible to restriction enzymes. Furthermore, when ATP was added to initiate SWI/SNF-dependent remodeling, we found that all of the arrays were excellent substrates for SWI/SNF action, showing similar kinetics over different enzyme and array concentrations (Fig. 3 and data not shown). For each array, SWI/SNF action enhanced SalI digestion kinetics by over 30-fold. Since this remodeling assay appears to measure the rate of nucleosome movements by ATP-dependent remodeling enzymes (18Jaskelioff M. Gavin I. Peterson C.L. Logie C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3058-3068Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), these data suggest that H3 serine 10 phosphorylation does not grossly alter the ability of SWI/SNF to mobilize nucleosomes.Histone Acetyltransferase AssaysPrevious studies with peptide substrates demonstrated that H3 serine 10 phosphorylation enhances the histone acetyltransferase activities of recombinant Gcn5p and native Gcn5-containing HAT complexes, such as SAGA (3Lo W.S.

To investigate whether Ser-10 phosphorylation within the context of nucleosomal arrays also stimulates the HAT activity of Gcn5p, we first performed radioactive HAT assays using recombinant Gcn5p and nucleosomal arrays containing recombinant wild-type XenopusH3, T32C-H3, or S10Phos-H3. Importantly, our HAT assays contained 50 mm monovalent cation, which facilitates the nucleosomal HAT activity of rGcn5p (19Tse C. Georgieva E.I. Ruiz-Garcia A.B. Sendra R. Hansen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32388-32392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The extent of 3H-acetate incorporation into the nucleosomal arrays was plotted as a function of time, and time points in the linear portion of the reaction were fit to determine initial velocities (Fig.4 A). Initial velocities for unphosphorylated nucleosomal array substrates containing recombinant wild-type Xenopus H3 and ligated T32C-H3 were nearly equivalent. In contrast, the initial velocity for the phosphorylated nucleosomal array substrate was increased greater than 2-fold relative to the unphosphorylated array, consistent with previous studies demonstrating enhanced rGcn5 HAT activity with phosphorylated peptide substrates.Figure 4Histone H3 serine 10 phosphorylation stimulates acetylation of nucleosomal arrays by Gcn5p but not by the Gcn5p-containing SAGA complex. A, comparison of Gcn5p HAT activity on phosphorylated and unphosphorylated nucleosomal arrays. Histone acetyltransferase assays were performed with recombinant Gcn5p (2.45 μm) and nucleosomal arrays (100 nmhistone H3) containing recombinant Xenopus H3 (filled circles), T32C-H3 (open circles), or S10Phos-H3 (filled squares). The extent of histone acetylation was determined at multiple timepoints by counting the incorporation of the tritiated acetate in a scintillation counter. Each assay was repeated at least three times, and initial velocities were calculated by plotting the average amount of radiolabel incorporation as a function of time. Error bars depict standard deviation for each time point. B, comparison of SAGA HAT activity on phosphorylated and unphosphorylated nucleosomal arrays. Assays and data analysis of SAGA were performed identically to those with Gcn5p above using SAGA (4.9 nm) and nucleosomal array (75 nm histone H3). C, comparison of SAGA HAT activity on phosphorylated and unphosphorylated nucleosomal arrays over a range of nucleosomal array concentration (12.5–625 nm histone H3 for arrays containing recombinant wild-type Xenopus H3; 12.5–250 nm histone H3 for arrays containing either T32C-H3 or S10Phos-H3). Assays were performed as described above except 9.8 nm SAGA was used with array concentrations containing 12.5–50 nm histone H3, while 4.9 nm SAGA was used with array concentrations containing 75–625 nmhistone H3. Initial velocities for each substrate concentration were calculated as described for Gcn5p. At least three independent experiments were performed at each array concentration, and the average initial velocity, normalized for SAGA concentration, was plotted as a function of histone H3 concentration. Initial velocities for nucleosomal arrays containing wild-type recombinant Xenopushistone H3 were fit to a saturation curve with a calculated Hill coefficient of 1.96 and depicted with a dashed line. Error bars show standard deviations for nucleosomal arrays containing wild-type recombinant Xenopus histone H3.D, comparison of SAGA histone specificity for phosphorylated and unphosphorylated nucleosomal arrays. HAT assays were performed with 14.8 nm SAGA and nucleosomal arrays (450 nmhistone H3) containing wild-type Xenopus H3 (lane 1), T32C-H3 (lane 2), or S10Phos-H3 (lane 3). Reactions were incubated for 30 min and then subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE gel. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize histones, destained, soaked in ENHANCE (NEN), and then analyzed by radiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether this increased activity toward phosphorylated nucleosomal arrays extended to a native Gcn5p-containing protein complex, we performed nucleosomal HAT assays using the multi-subunit SAGA complex (Fig. 4 B). Contrary to the increased HAT activity of Gcn5p on the phosphorylated array, the initial velocities for HAT activity of SAGA complex did not show a difference between the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated array substrates. Because this result was contrary to previous results that used SAGA and phosphorylated peptides (3Lo W.S. Trievel R.C. Rojas J.R. Duggan L. Hsu J.Y. Allis C.D. Marmorstein R. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 917-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), a more extensive kinetic characterization was performed. To ensure that the HAT assays were not performed under saturating substrate concentrations, where differences in binding affinity would be largely masked, assays were repeated over a wide range of nucleosomal array concentrations for all three substrates. Plots of initial velocities of HAT activity as a function of array concentration (Fig. 4 C) show that SAGA exhibits saturation kinetics for all three nucleosomal array substrates. Strikingly, comparison of initial velocities of SAGA for phosphorylated and unphosphorylated arrays over a range of substrate concentrations confirms an absence of any significant difference in initial velocities. Furthermore, SDS-PAGE analysis of these HAT reactions demonstrates that the H3 subunit remains the preferred acetylation substrate (Fig. 4 D) and that no detectable difference in the level of acetylation is detectable among the three substrate arrays.The ability of Gcn5p and SAGA to efficiently utilize nucleosomes composed of either wild-type or ligated histones provides further support for the integrity of nucleosomal arrays reconstituted with histones generated by native chemical ligation. Moreover, the ability to generate homogeneous, phosphorylated nucleosomal arrays has allowed us to determine that the nucleosomal HAT activity of recombinant Gcn5p is enhanced by H3 phosphorylation and that the nucleosomal HAT activity of the native SAGA complex is insensitive to H3 phosphorylation. This latter result was particularly surprising since previous studies that used peptide substrates demonstrated stimulation of SAGA activity by H3 phosphorylation (3Lo W.S. Trievel R.C. Rojas J.R. Duggan L. Hsu J.Y. Allis C.D. Marmorstein R. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 917-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). In the case of rGcn5p it is known that the phosphorylation-dependent stimulation of HAT activity is due to an increased affinity for the peptide substrate (6- to 10-fold; (3Lo W.S. Trievel R.C.

In the case of SAGA complex, the failure of H3 phosphorylation to stimulate nucleosomal HAT activity may be due to other subunits (e.g. Ada2p) contributing to a different mode of histone tail binding. In addition, SAGA may make additional contacts with nucleosomes that are simply not possible with small peptide substrates; for instance SAGA may interact with multiple histone tails, or the ability of SAGA to bind with high affinity to DNA (20Sendra R. Tse C. Hansen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24928-24934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) may also contribute to a different mode of nucleosomal substrate binding. We note that our biochemical studies are consistent with several recent reports that suggest that histone H3 phosphorylation is not always coupled to enhanced histone acetylation in vivo (21Thomson S. Clayton A.L. Mahadevan L.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1231-1241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar,22Labrador M. Corces V.G. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).Concluding RemarksAlthough our studies have used native peptide ligation to generate homogeneous, phosphorylated nucleosomal arrays, this strategy has the potential for generating and analyzing nucleosomal arrays that harbor a wide range of histone post-translational modification. Importantly, the ligation chemistry is compatible with peptides that harbor specific acetylated or methylated lysine residues. Furthermore, nucleosomal arrays could be generated"

However, it has become increasingly clear that CBP acetylates both histones and non-histone proteins, many of which are transcription factors. Here we investigate the role of CBP acetylase activity in CREB-mediated gene expression. We show that CREB is acetylated within the cell and that in vitro, CREB is acetylated by CBP, but not by another acetylase, p300/CBP-associated factor. The acetylation sites within CREB were mapped to three lysines within the CREB activation domain. Although inhibition of histone deacetylase activity results in an increase of CREB- or CBP-mediated gene expression, mutation of all three putative acetylation sites in the CREB activation domain markedly enhances the ability of CREB to activate a cAMP-responsive element-dependent reporter gene. Furthermore, these CREB lysine mutations do not increase interaction with the CRE or CBP. These data suggest that the transactivation potential of CREB may be modulated through acetylation by CBP. We propose that in addition to its functions as a bridging molecule and histone acetyltransferase, the ability of CBP to acetylate CREB may play a key role in modulating CREB-mediated gene expression.

Montminy M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar). Increases in cAMP levels activate a cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase A (PKA),1 which in turn phosphorylates transcription factors, resulting in activation of gene transcription. The transcription factor CREB (CRE-binding protein) is the best studied link between PKA activation and gene transcription. CREB was originally described as a transcription factor that binds to an 8-bp element known as cAMP-response element (CRE) in the somatostatin gene promoter (2Montminy M.R. Sevarino K.A. Wagner J.A. Mandel G. Goodman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6682-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). This DNA element mediates transcription in response to changes in cAMP levels. Subsequently, CREs were found in promoters of other genes activated by cAMP (3Montminy M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). The critical step in cAMP-induced, CREB-mediated gene expression appears to be phosphorylation of CREB by PKA at a single serine (Ser-133). CREB, when phosphorylated at Ser-133, binds to a nuclear protein, CBP (4Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H.

Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar). Precisely how CBP affects gene transcription has not been resolved. One model is that CBP links DNA-bound activators to the general transcription machinery (8Kwok R.P. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Brennan R.G. Roberts S.G. Green M.R.

The targets of histone acetyltransferases are not restricted to histones, however (for a review, see Ref. 20Sterner D.E. Berger S.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 435-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar). Acetylation of general transcription factors such as TFIIE and TFIIF (21Imhof A. Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nakatani Y. Wolffe A.P. Ge H. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 689-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) has also been demonstrated. Acetylation of factors related to transcription can either have positive or negative effects on transcriptional regulation. For example, acetylation of tumor suppressor p53 at Lys-373 and Lys-382 by CBP increases p53 DNA binding (22Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar, 23Liu L. Scolnick D.M. Trievel R.C. Zhang H.B. Marmorstein R. Halazonetis T.D. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar); in contrast, CBP acetylation of aDrosophila protein TCF at Lys-25 inhibits its interaction with the coactivator Armadillo, resulting in reduction of gene expression (25Waltzer L. Bienz M. Nature. 1998; 395: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrate that in some cases, acetylation of histones by histone acetyltransferases may not be the primary event in regulation of the activity of these transcription pathways. Acetyltransferase activity is critically important for the coactivator function of CBP (26Ludlam W.H. Taylor M.H. Tanner K.G. Denu J.M. Goodman R.H. Smolik S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3832-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 27Martinez-Balbas M.A. Bannister A.J. Martin K. Haus-Seuffert P. Meisterernst M. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2886-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The observation that CBP and p300 may acetylate other non-histone proteins leads us to investigate whether CBP could acetylate CREB and whether acetylation of CREB influenced its activation function. Treatment with deacetylase inhibitors such as trichostatin A (TSA) and butyrate has been shown to enhance CREB-mediated gene transcription on a stably transfected CRE reporter but not on a transiently transfected CRE reporter (28Michael L.F. Asahara H. Shulman A.I. Kraus W.L. Montminy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1596-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition, TSA treatment prolongs the phosphorylation of CREB after forskolin stimulation, suggesting that acetylation plays a role in regulating CREB function, perhaps at the level of regulating phosphorylation of CREB. However, in contrast to these findings, we demonstrate here that TSA treatment enhances a somatostatin reporter gene activity in a transient transactivation assay. Furthermore, we show that CBP, but not P/CAF, acetylates CREB in vitro and that CREB is acetylated within the cell. We mapped the CBP-acetylated lysines to three of the five lysines within the CREB activation domain. Substitution mutations of the target lysines within the CREB activation domain which are acetylated by CBP result in enhancement of CREB-mediated gene expression. These results suggest that acetylation of CREB by CBP may modulate CREB intrinsic activity as a transcriptional activator. The construction of Rc/RSV-FLAG-CREB341 was described by Kwok et al. (8Kwok R.P. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Brennan R.G. Roberts S.G. Green M.R. Goodman R.H.

Rc/RSV-FLAG-CREB lysine mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). pET23b CREB His6 WT and its mutants were generated using PCR, and the PCR fragments were subcloned into pET23b in-frame with six copies of histidine at the carboxyl terminus. GAL4-CREB1–283 was constructed by fusing the GAL4 DNA binding domain(1–147) to the amino terminus of CREB1–283. GAL4-CBP CBD(451–682) was described by Kwok et al. (29Kwok R.P. Laurance M.E.

VP16-CREB341 and its lysine mutants were constructed by fusing CREB341 to the carboxyl terminus of the activation domain of VP16. All sequences were confirmed by sequencing. The procedure to generate purified CBP with two copies of FLAG tag (CBP 2XFLAG) and FLAG-P/CAF was described by Kashanchi et al. (30Kashanchi F. Duvall J.F. Kwok R.P. Lundblad J.R. Goodman R.H.

His-tagged CREB341 protein, the CREB activation domain (CREB1–283), and its lysine mutants were produced in bacteria and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen). The F9 cell transactivation assay was described by Kwok et al. (8Kwok R.P. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Brennan R.G. Roberts S.G. Green M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). F9 cells were plated at 0.15 × 106 cells/60-mm plate. DNA was transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation (Invitrogen). Rc/RSV vector was used to normalize the total DNA used for each sample. Procedures to determine chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) and luciferase activities were described by Kwok et al.

COS-7 cells were seeded at 0.7 × 106 cells/100-mm plate and were maintained in 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. A day later, the cells were transfected with 15 μg of pcDNA3-FLAG-CREB WT using calcium phosphate precipitation (Invitrogen). Control cells were transfected with pcDNA3 alone. Two days later, the cells were incubated with 1 mCi/ml sodium [3H]acetate (2.5Ci/mmol) (ICN) for 1 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The labeled proteins were then subjected to immunoprecipitation as described by Kwok et al. (29Kwok R.P. Laurance M.E. Lundblad J.R. Goldman P.S. Shih H. Connor L.M. Marriott S.J. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1996; 380: 642-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) using FLAG-M2 antibodies (Sigma). The precipitated proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, enhanced with Amplify (Amersham Biosciences), dried, and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak) at −70 °C for 4 weeks. Purified CREB341 proteins were phosphorylated by recombinant catalytic subunit of PKA in the presence of ATP as described by Kwok et al. (8Kwok R.P. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P.

Purified CREB341 wild-type (WT), CREB1–283, or its lysine mutant proteins (0.5 μm) were acetylated in the presence of purified full-length 50 nmFLAG-tagged CBP and 14C-acetyl-CoA (Amersham Biosciences) (60 mCi/mmol, final concentration of acetyl-CoA, 50 μm in 20 μl). The reaction buffer contained 10 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm sodium butyrate, and 5% glycerol. The reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 1 h. After acetylation, the acetylated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE; the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and destained by acetic acid/methanol, dried, and exposed to a Bio-Rad phosphorimaging screen. The 14C signal was detected using a Bio-Rad FX phosphorimager. CREB peptides and histone H3(7–22) peptide were synthesized either by Sigma Genosys or by the Protein Core Facility at the University of Michigan. All the peptides were purified by high performance liquid chromatography to >95% purity. Individual peptides (0.5 μg) were incubated with purified 0.1 μg of CBP or 0.1 μg of P/CAF in the presence of [3H]acetyl-CoA (Amersham Biosciences) (5.4 Ci/mmol acetyl-CoA, 2.3 μm final concentration) in a 20-μl reaction. The reaction buffer was the same as described above. The reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 1 h and then spotted on a P81 filter paper (Whatman), dried for 5 min, and washed three times with 0.1% phosphoric acid. The filter paper was air dried and counted using liquid scintillation counting. To investigate the role of CREB acetylation in gene activation, we tested whether inhibition of deacetylases (resulting in increases in acetylation) would affect CREB-mediated gene expression. It has been reported that TSA treatment enhances CREB-mediated gene transcription of a stably transfected CRE reporter but not of a transient transfected CRE reporter (28Michael L.F. Asahara H. Shulman A.I. Kraus W.L. Montminy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1596-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Although the status of packaging of transiently transfected DNA into chromatin is controversial, some have argued that transiently expressed DNA is not arranged in regular chromatin arrays (31Smith C.L. Hager G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27493-27496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). We demonstrate, however, that expression of a transiently transfected somatostatin CRE-CAT (SRIF-CAT) reporter in F9 cells is augmented by TSA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.1). These results suggest that, at least in these F9 cells, either the transiently transfected SRIF-CRE reporter assembles into a TSA-sensitive chromatin, or, alternatively, acetylation of non-histone proteins may determine activity of the SRIF-CAT reporter in this context. To investigate whether the acetyltransferase activity of CBP, apart from its role as a histone-acetylating enzyme, plays a role in PKA-activated gene expression, we tested whether CBP acetylates CREB. Using recombinant purified full-length CBP and purified CREB protein, we show that in vitro both CREB and PKA-phosphorylated CREB are acetylated by CBP (Fig. 2 B,upper panel). Because in our experiments the efficiency of PKA phosphorylation of CREB is close to 95% (data not shown), the possibility that CBP acetylates a subpopulation of nonphosphorylated CREB is minimal. CREB belongs to the leucine zipper family of transcription factors consisting of separable activation domain (AD) (1–283) and DNA-binding/dimerization (bZIP) domain (284–341) (32Daniel P.B. Walker W.H. Habener J.F. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1998; 18: 353-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 33Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar). Of 15 potential lysine acetylation sites in CREB, 5 lysines are located within the CREB-AD and 10 lysines within the bZIP domain. Interestingly, when we mutated all 5 lysines (Fig. 2 A; Lys-91, Lys-94, Lys-123, Lys-136, Lys-155) to alanine within the CREB-AD of full-length CREB (CREB 5K/A), we found that acetylation by CBP was markedly diminished compared with that of CREB WT (Fig.2 B). These results suggest that the major CBP acetylation sites within CREB are located within the activation domain of CREB and that lysines within the bZIP domain of CREB are not the primary targets of CBP acetylation in the context of the full-length protein. To map the CBP acetylation sites within the CREB-AD, purified bacterially expressed WT CREB1–283 protein and the mutant proteins containing single lysine residue were used in the in vitroacetylation assays. Single lysine mutants were generated by mutation of 4 of the 5 lysines to alanine. As a negative control, all five lysines were mutated to alanine (5K/A). Single lysine mutant proteins and WT CREB-AD(1–283) were incubated in vitro with recombinant CBP and [14C]acetyl-CoA. In these experiments, CBP preferentially acetylates Lys-91 and Lys-136, and to a lesser extent, Lys-94 (Fig. 2 C). Although CBP acetylates CREB in vitro, CREB could also be a substrate of an alternative acetylase within the cell. Thus we also tested whether P/CAF could acetylate peptides corresponding to each of the potential CREB acetylation sites (sequences of individual peptide are shown in Fig. 2 A). The results shown in Fig.2 D indicate that although CBP acetylates CREB peptides containing Lys-91/Lys-94 and Lys-136, these peptides are not substrates for P/CAF-dependent acetylation. As a positive control, both CBP and P/CAF acetylate a histone H3(7–22) peptide. These results indicate that CREB-AD is a substrate for CBP, but not P/CAF, in vitro and potentially within the cell. To determine whether CREB is acetylated within the cell, we transfected COS-7 cells with a FLAG-CREB expression vector and then labeled the cells with sodium [3H]acetate. Labeled FLAG-CREB proteins were immunoprecipitated using the FLAG-M2 monoclonal antibody, separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by fluorography. The results shown in Fig.3 A demonstrate that CREB is acetylated in COS-7 cells. To confirm that incorporation of sodium [3H]acetate corresponded to bona fideacetylation of CREB in vivo, FLAG-CREB was immunoprecipitated from transfected COS-7 cells and subjected to Western blotting with an acetyllysine (anti-Ac-Lys)-specific monoclonal antibody (4G12, Upstate Biotechnology) (Fig. 3 B). We next asked what role the acetylated lysines played in the transactivation potential of CREB. For these experiments, we individually mutated Lys-91, Lys-94, and Lys-136 to alanine and tested the transcriptional activity of these CREB lysine mutants for activation of the cAMP-responsive SRIF-CAT reporter. As controls, we also mutated Lys-123 and Lys-155, which are not acetylated by CBP, to alanine. As we and others have demonstrated previously (8Kwok R.P. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P.

Chem. 1996; 271: 28138-28145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), CREB WT activates the SRIF-CAT reporter in a PKA- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4 A, black squares). The dose-response curves of CREB with single lysine mutations (K91A, K94A, and K136A) were similar, with a slight increase in activity relative to that of CREB WT (Fig. 4 A). In the absence of the catalytic subunit of PKA, there were no differences between the activities of the CREB WT and the single lysine mutants (Fig. 4 B). At the plateau level of activation (3.6 μg of CREB), there is a slight, but not significant, increase in transactivation by K91A, K94A, and K136A (Fig. 4 C). Fig.4 D demonstrates similar levels of CREB expression in the samples used in Fig. 4 C. These results suggest that single mutation of the putative CBP acetylation sites has no significant effect on the transactivation potential of CREB. Because in vitro mapping experiments indicated that CBP acetylates as many as 3 lysine residues in the activation domain of CREB, we next tested whether multiple mutations involving Lys-91, Lys-94, and Lys-136 would affect CREB-mediated gene expression. We first generated CREB double lysine mutants and tested their ability to enhance transcription. With cotransfection of the catalytic subunit of PKA, the CREB double lysine mutants, K91A/K94A, K91A/K136A, and K94A/K136A, significantly enhance CRE-dependent transcription in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.5 A) and have a higher plateau level of activation (3.6 μg of CREB expression vector level) (Fig.5 C). Interestingly, the transactivation activity of the double lysine mutants involving two of the three acetylated lysines (Lys-91, Lys-94, and Lys-136) shows increases in basal, non-PKA-dependent transactivation (Fig. 5, B andC). These results prompted us to test whether mutation involving all 3 lysines would achieve maximum enhancement of gene transcription. The results shown in Fig. 6,A and C, indicate that although the expression of each mutant is similar at the 3.6 μg of transfected CREB expression vector (Fig. 6 D), the transactivation potential of the triple lysine mutant (K91A/K94A/K136A) is 4 times higher than that of CREB WT. In contrast, the transactivation potentials of mutant K91A/K94A/K123A (Fig. 6,A and C) and mutant K91A/K94A/K155A (Fig.6 C) are no different from that of the double lysine mutant (K91A/K94A), which is about 2.5 times the CREB WT. The transactivation potential of CREB lacking all 5 lysines within the CREB-AD is the same as that of the triple lysine mutant (K91A/K94A/K136A) (Fig.6 C), suggesting that mutation of Lys-123 and/or Lys-155, which are not acetylated by CBP (Fig. 2), have no additional effect on CREB-mediated gene activation. As shown in Fig. 5, B andC, the basal activity (without PKA) of the double and triple lysine mutants is higher compared with the CREB WT (Fig. 6,B and C).Figure 6Triple lysine mutations within CREB enhance CREB-mediated gene expression. The format of the experiments is identical to that described in Fig. 3. In C, the data are expressed as mean relative CAT activity ± S.E. (n= 3). * represents statistical significance (Tukey test) atp ≤ 0.01 compared with CREB WT.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because a Lys → Ala mutation neutralizes the positive charge of lysine, it is possible that increases in transactivation caused by a Lys → Ala mutation is caused by an alteration in charge. To address this issue, we mutated each lysine within the CREB-AD to arginine (Lys → Arg) and tested the transactivation activity of these mutants for activation of the SRIF-CAT reporter. The results shown in Fig. 6indicate that the double lysine (K91R/K94R) and triple-lysine (K91R/K94R/K136R) mutants enhance the activity of CREB in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.7 A) and also at plateau expression levels (Fig. 7 C). Thus, the pattern of transactivation of CREB Lys → Arg mutants is similar to that described for the CREB Lys → Ala mutants (Fig. 6). These data indicate that lysine per se, not the charge, determines the function of CREB. One explanation of the observed enhancement of CREB-mediated gene expression is that the CREB lysine mutants may have enhanced interaction with CRE. To test this model, we fused the CREB-AD to the DNA binding domain of the activator GAL4 and tested the ability of GAL4-CREB-AD and its lysine mutants to activate a GAL4 UAS-dependent-CAT reporter (5XGAL4-CAT). We reasoned that fusion of the CREB activation domain to a heterologous DNA binding domain would distinguish between mutation-dependent alterations in intrinsic transactivation potential from influences on the DNA binding activity of CREB. However, the results shown in Fig.8 demonstrate that mutation of these lysines alters the intrinsic activity of CREB in the absence of the CREB DNA binding domain. Like the augmentation of the activity of the triple lysine mutant in the context of full-length CREB, GAL4-CREB-AD K91A/K94A/K136A shows higher activity than GAL4-CREB-AD K91A/K94A, GAL4-CREB-AD K91A, or GAL4-CREB-AD WT. These results suggest that lysine mutations within CREB-AD do not alter the ability of CREB to interact with the CRE but rather alter AD function. Lysine mutations within the CREB-AD may also enhance the transactivation function of CREB by enhancing its interaction with CBP. To address this issue, we asked whether increasing CBP expression would enhance the transcriptional activity of CREB lysine mutants as one would expect if these lysines influenced the interaction of CREB with CBP. We have shown previously that in F9 cells, coexpression of CBP enhances CREB-mediated gene expression (8Kwok R.P. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Brennan R.G. Roberts S.G. Green M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). However, the results shown in Fig. 9, A and B, do not support this hypothesis. In the absence of coexpressed CBP, the transactivation activity of the CREB lysine mutants is increased in a PKA-dependent manner. Cotransfection of CBP enhances CREB WT as well as its lysine mutants in a dose-dependent and parallel manner, suggesting that mutation of the lysine acetylation sites within the CREB-AD does not affect the interaction of CREB with CBP. In the absence of coexpressed catalytic subunit of PKA, CBP has no effect on the transactivation activity of CREB WT or of its lysine mutants (Fig. 9 B). To confirm the results shown in Fig. 9, A and B, we performed a mammalian two-hybrid assay using a GAL4 DNA binding domain fusion with the CREB binding domain of CBP (GAL4-CBP CBD) and CREB WT and its lysine mutants fused to the carboxyl terminus of the activation domain of VP16. The results shown in Fig. 9, Cand D, suggest that VP16 CREB WT and its lysine mutants activate GAL4-CBP CBD in a dose-dependent manner with the cotransfection of the catalytic subunit of PKA. As a control, CREB M1, in which the PKA phosphorylation site (Ser-133) is mutated to alanine, does not activate the GAL4-CBP CBD. Without the cotransfection of the catalytic subunit of PKA, VP16 CREB WT as well as its lysine mutants do not activate GAL4-CBP CBD (Fig. 9 D). It has become increasingly clear that in addition to its bridging function and its histone acetylase activity, p300/CBP regulates the activity of transcription factors and other nuclear proteins by acetylation (20Sterner D.E.

However, in OK cells exogenously expressing E3KARP, LPA stimulated NHE3 activity. Consistent with the stimulatory effect on NHE3 activity, LPA treatment increased the surface NHE3 amount, which occurred by accelerating exocytic trafficking (endocytic recycling) to the apical plasma membrane. These LPA effects only occurred in OK cells transfected with E3KARP. The LPA-induced increases of NHE3 activity, surface NHE3 amounts, and exocytosis were completely inhibited by pretreatment with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002. LPA stimulation of the phosphorylation of Akt was used as an assay for PI 3-kinase activity. LY294002 completely prevented the LPA-induced increase in Akt phosphorylation, which is consistent with the inhibitory effect of LY294002 on the LPA stimulation of NHE3 activity. The LPA-induced phosphorylation of Akt was the same in OK cells with and without E3KARP. These results show that LPA stimulates NHE3 in the apical surface of OK cells by a mechanism that is dependent on both E3KARP and PI 3-kinase. This is the first demonstration that rapid stimulation of NHE3 activity is dependent on an apical membrane PDZ domain protein.

These results suggest that PI 3-kinase and Akt activation, which is stimulated by PI 3-kinase, play necessary and sufficient roles in the stimulation of exocytosis of NHE3 in PS120 fibroblasts. NHERF and E3KARP, which are scaffolding proteins, possess two PDZ domains and an ERM-binding domain (19Yun C.H.C. Oh S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C.M. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl.

These PDZ domain proteins interact with NHE3 through their C-terminally extended second PDZ domain, and via their C termini also associate with ezrin, which links to the actin cytoskeleton and also acts as an anchoring protein for protein kinase AII (21Yun C.H.

Therefore, both NHERF and E3KARP physically link NHE3 to protein kinase AII for the acute inhibition of NHE3 activity through protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation.

In opossum kidney proximal tubule cells, LPA also induces proliferation, although on a more prolonged time scale, through the activation of PI 3-kinase and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (30Dixon R.J. Brunskill N.J. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 2064-2075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate the first evidence that LPA stimulates epithelial sodium absorption, acting by increasing NHE3 activity and the amount of NHE3 on the plasma membrane. This occurs by stimulation of exocytic trafficking by activation of PI 3-kinase. E3KARP but not NHERF is necessary for LPA-induced stimulation of NHE3 activity and increase of NHE3 in the plasma membrane. This is the initial demonstration of E3KARP being involved in rapid stimulation of sodium absorption. OK/E3V (NHE3 epitope tagged on the C terminus with the vesicular stomatitis virus G-protein (VSV-G epitope)) cells (generously provided by J. Noel, University of Montreal), as described (7Akhter S.

OK/E3V cell lines were selected for Na+/H+ exchanger activity (every other passage) by exposing cells to an acid load consisting of 50 mm NH4Cl/94 mm NaCl solution for 1 h, followed by an isotonic 2 mm Na+solution as described (31Levine S.A. Montrose M.H. Tse C.M. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25527-25535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A clonal cell line of OK/E3V expressing E3KARP (OK/E3V/E3KARP) was generated by stable transfection of OK/E3V cells with a pcDNA3.1 neomycin resistance plasmid (Invitrogen) bearing E3KARP. Transfection was performed with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) as described (7Akhter S. Kovbasnjuk O. Li X. Cavet M. Noel J. Arpin M. Hubbard A. Donowitz M. Am. J.

Cells resistant to the selection pressure were selected through six passages prior to study. Cellular Na+/H+ exchange activity in OK cell lines was determined fluorometrically using the intracellular pH-sensitive dye acetoxymethyl ester of 2′7′-bis(carboxyethyl)5–6-carboxy-fluorescein (BCECF-AM, 5 ॖm; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), as described previously (7Akhter S.

They were then placed in serum-free medium for 2 days before transport was studied (11Laghmani K. Preissig R.A. Moe O.W. Yanagisawa A.M. Alpern R.J. J. Clin.

For acidification and dye loading, cells were incubated in Na+solution (130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 25 mmglucose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing BCECF-AM and 40 mm NH4Cl for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were initially perfused with TMA+ solution (130 mmtetramethylammonium chloride, 5 mm KCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mmNaH2PO4, 25 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), which was then switched to Na+ solution for the sodium-dependent pHi recovery. At the end of each experiment, the fluorescence ratio was calibrated to pHi using the high potassium/nigericin method using 130 mmKCl/pHi buffer plus 10 ॖmnigericin titrated to pH 6.0, 6.3, and 7.2. Na+/H+ exchange activity data were calculated as the product of Na+-dependent changes in pHi times the buffering capacity at each pHiand were analyzed by nonlinear regression using Origin (Microcal Software) to estimate Vmax and K′(H+)i (32Cavet M.E. Akhter S. Sanchez de Medina F. Donowitz M. Tse C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C1111-C1121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In some cases, Na+/H+ exchange activity was described as the rate of initial sodium-dependent alkalinization over a minimum of 9 s, as determined by least square analysis. The amounts of NHE3 on the plasma membrane were measured by biotinylation of cell surface proteins as described (7Akhter S. Kovbasnjuk O. Li X. Cavet M. Noel J. Arpin M. Hubbard A. Donowitz M. Am. J.

All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) and once in borate buffer (154 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm boric acid, 7.2 mm KCl, and 1.8 mm CaCl2, pH 9.0). Cells were then exposed to 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin in borate buffer for 40 min with horizontal shaking. After labeling, cells were washed with quenching buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 120 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) to scavenge the unreacted biotin. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1 ml of N+ buffer (60 mmHEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, and 17 Triton X-100) by sonication for 20 s. Insoluble cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 20 min at 12,000 × g. Supernatant representing the total NHE3 fraction was incubated with streptavidin-agarose for 2 h and then the resultant beads were washed four times in N+ buffer to remove nonspecifically bound proteins. The proteins bound to streptavidin-agarose beads, which represent surface fractions, were solubilized with Laemmli buffer. The total and surface fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking with 57 nonfat milk, the blots were probed with a monoclonal anti-VSV-G antibody (P5D4) as the primary antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse as the secondary antibody, and bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (33Hoogerwerf W.A.

The densities of NHE3 protein bands were quantitated by scanning densitometer and ImageQuant software. Endocytosis was measured by a protocol slightly modified from the reduced GSH-resistant endocytosis assay described previously by us (20Kim J.H. Lee-Kwon W. Park J.B. Ruy S.H. Yun C. Donowitz M. J.

Cells were then warmed to 37 °C, treated with LPA, dopamine (positive control) (34Hu M.C. Fan L. Crowder L.A. Karim-Jimenez Z. Murer H. Moe O.W. J. Biol.

Surface biotin was cleaved by washing with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm GSH, pH 8.8. The freshly endocytosed proteins bearing biotin were protected from cleavage with GSH. Cells were solubilized in N+ buffer, and biotinylated proteins were retrieved and assayed for endocytosed NHE3 as described above. To measure exocytic insertion of NHE3, NHS reactive sites on the cell surface were first blocked by pretreatment with sulfo-NHS-acetate as described, with some slight modifications (12Peng Y.

Cells were rinsed with PBS-Ca-Mg (ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.1 mm Ca2+ and 1 mm Mg2+) two times at 4 °C. The apical surface was then exposed to 1.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-acetate in PBS-Ca-Mg for 2 h. After quenching for 20 min, cells were rinsed with PBS at 37 °C and treated with LPA or vehicle for 30 min. Cells were then treated with 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin and lysed with N+ buffer. The biotinylated fraction, which represents newly inserted surface proteins, was precipitated by streptavidin agarose, and the precipitate was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-VSV-G antibody as described above. To address the question whether E3KARP is involved in stimulation of NHE3, we established an OK cell line stably expressing both NHE3V and E3KARP (OK/E3V/E3KARP cells) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The expression levels of NHERF and E3KARP in the clonal cell lines were determined. As shown in Fig.1, E3KARP is expressed in OK/E3V/E3KARP cells but not in parental OK or OK/E3V cells. Endogenous NHERF is expressed in these OK cells in similar amounts. The level of E3KARP expression is less in OK/E3V/E3KARP cells than in the PS120/E3V/E3KARP cells we have described previously (20Kim J.H. Lee-Kwon W. Park J.B. Ruy S.H. Yun C. Donowitz M. J. Biol.

Endogenous NHERF is highly expressed in OK/E3V/E3KARP cells, in contrast to the minimal expression of endogenous NHERF in PS120 cells (35Ahn W. Kim K.H. Lee J.A. Kim J.Y. Choi J.Y. Moe O.W.

To determine whether LPA, as an example of the mediators of the restitution phase of inflammation, affects NHE3 activity in proximal tubule epithelial cells, we treated OK/E3V and OK/E3V/E3KARP cells with LPA for 30 min at 37 °C and then measured NHE3 activity. As shown in Fig.2B, LPA treatment (100 ॖm, 30 min at 37 °C) caused ∼507 increase in NHE3Vmax (1533 ± 63 ॖm/s, control versus 2285 ± 76 ॖm/s, LPA-treated cells, p < 0.01) in OK/E3V/E3KARP cells. In contrast, NHE3 activity was not significantly affected by LPA treatment in OK/E3V cells (Fig. 2A). The dose and time dependence of the LPA-induced stimulation of NHE3 activity were determined. As shown in Fig.3A, LPA significantly increased NHE3 activity as early as 10 min, and the LPA-dependent activation increased up to 60 min. LPA activated NHE3 in a concentration-dependent manner from 10−6m to 10−4m(Fig. 3B), with no effect at 10−7m. This dose dependence of LPA on NHE3 activity is similar to the concentration dependence of LPA on proliferation of OK cells (30Dixon R.J. Brunskill N.J. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 2064-2075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These results show that LPA stimulates NHE3 activity by an E3KARP-dependent mechanism.Figure 3Time- and dose-dependent effects of LPA on NHE3 activity.A, OK/E3V/E3KARP cells were treated with 100 ॖm LPA for the indicated times and then the rate of Na+-dependent pH recovery at pHi 6.4 was measured. B, OK/E3V/E3KARP cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of LPA for 30 min.

Plasma membrane proteins were biotinylated by reaction with sulfo-NHS-SS biotin at 4 °C, and biotinylated proteins were isolated by precipitation with immobilized streptavidin-agarose. As shown in Fig. 4A, treatment with 10−4m LPA for 60 min did not affect the surface abundance of NHE3 in OK/E3V cells (non-E3KARP expressing). In contrast, in OK/E3V/E3KARP cells, LPA treatment caused an increase in apical membrane NHE3 protein abundance in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 4B), consistent with the time-dependent stimulation of NHE3 activity by LPA treatment shown in Fig. 3B. 10 min of LPA exposure significantly increased the amount of surface NHE3. The LPA-induced increase in the surface NHE3 amount occurred without any change in total cellular NHE3 abundance. These results suggest that the LPA-induced activation of NHE3 is because of the increase of the amount of surface NHE3. The net increase in surface NHE3 amount could be because of a decrease in endocytic internalization and/or an increase in exocytic insertion of NHE3. To clarify which mechanism was involved in the increase of surface NHE3 amount, the rates of endocytosis and exocytosis of NHE3 in OK/E3V/E3KARP cells were measured. To quantitate the exocytic insertion, all plasma membrane reactive sites were blocked by pretreatment with sulfo-NHS-acetate (12Peng Y. Amemiya M. Yong X. Fan L. Moe O.W. Yin H. Preissig P.A. Yana"
https://openalex.org/W2089200829,"Daxx has been reported to function as a transcriptional modulator in the nucleus. In the present study, we have explored the role of Daxx in regulating the transcriptional activity of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Overexpression of Daxx suppressed GR-mediated activation of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter in COS-1, HeLa, and 293T cells. In vitro and in vivo studies revealed that Daxx could directly bind to GR. The mapping analysis further demonstrated that the C-terminal region of Daxx-(501–740) mediates the interaction and transcriptional repression of GR. The repressive effect of Daxx and Daxx-(501–740) on GR could be alleviated by co-expression of promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML). Furthermore, immunofluorescence analysis showed that overexpression of wild-type PML results in the translocation of Daxx and Daxx-(501–740) to the PML oncogenic domains (PODs). By contrast, a PML sumoylation-defective mutant failed to recruit Daxx to PODs and to reverse the Daxx repression effect on GR. Accordingly, As2O3 treatment rendered the sequestration of endogenous Daxx to the PODs, leading to an enhancement of GR transactivation in COS-1 cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that recruitment of Daxx into the subnuclear POD structures sequesters it from the GR/co-activators complex, thereby alleviating its repressive effects. Our present studies provide the important link between Daxx/PML interaction and GR transcriptional activation. Daxx has been reported to function as a transcriptional modulator in the nucleus.

Like other superfamily members, GR contains the N-terminal transactivation domain, central DNA binding domain, and the C-terminal ligand binding domain (6Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36863-36864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Prior to exposure to its respective ligand, the GR and other receptors in this family form complexes with heat shock proteins (HSPs), restricting the unliganded-receptor in its inactive state. Upon ligand binding, the receptor is dissociated from HSPs and translocates to the nucleus where the liganded receptor binds to the glucocorticoid-responsive element and recruits co-factors to regulate transcription (7Beato M. Sanchez-Pacheco A. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 587-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). A diverse group of proteins have emerged as potential cofactors for nuclear receptors through direct protein-protein interactions. For instances, several co-activators have been identified that bind to GR and modulate GR transcriptional activity, including CBP/p300, p160 family co-activators (SRC-1, GRIP1, and p/CIP), and chromatin remodeling complexes (BRG-1 (SWI/SNF) complex and P/CAF (ADA/SAGA) complex) (8Robyr D. Wolffe A.P. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 329-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 9Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36865-36868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). These co-activators appear to be assembled in a multiprotein complex, facilitating the access of nuclear receptors and the RNA polymerase II core machinery to their target DNA by a chromatin remodeling process (10Collingwood T.N. Urnov F.D. Wolffe A.P. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 23: 255-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In addition to regulating GR transcriptional activity via direct protein-protein interactions, some co-factors appear to modulate GR activity through indirect fashion. PML, a protein located at the promyelocytic oncogenic domains (PODs), has previously been reported to stimulate GR and RXRα transcriptional activity through its interaction with CBP (11Doucas V. Tini M. Egan D.A. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2627-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). These results demonstrated that a portion of CBP is recruited to the PODs through its association with PML, suggesting that PML and/or POD-associated proteins may function as an important cofactor in governing nuclear hormone receptor transcriptional activity and function. Besides PML and CBP, several cellular proteins have been reported to be associated with PODs, including Sp100, Daxx, p53, Rb, small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO-1), and BLM (12Hatta M. Fukamizu A. Science's STKE. 2001; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2001/112/e1)PubMed Google Scholar, 13Borden K.L. Mol. Cell.

Results from many elegant studies have revealed that overexpression of p53 suppressed GR-mediated reporter gene activation (14Yu C. Yap N. Chen D. Cheng S. Cancer Lett. 1997; 116: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 15Sengupta S. Vonesch J.L. Waltzinger C. Zheng H. Wasylyk B.

Chem. 2001; 276: 13762-13770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), respectively. Recently, SUMO-1 modification of GR has been shown to regulate its transcriptional activity (17Le Drean Y. Mincheneau N. Le Goff P. Michel D. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3482-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 18Tian S. Poukka H. Palvimo J.J. Janne O.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 907-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that POD-associated proteins play important roles in modulating GR transcriptional activity. Whether other POD-associated proteins are also involved in regulating GR transcriptional activity remains to be explored. Daxx, a PODs-associated protein, was identified as an interacting protein of PML (19Torii S. Egan D.A. Evans R.A. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6037-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 20Ishov A.M. Sotnikov A.G. Negorev D. Vladimirova O.V. Neff N. Kamitani T. Yeh E.T. Strauss III, J.F. Maul G.G. J.

Biol. 2000; 20: 1784-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Recent studies implied that Daxx might function as a transcriptional coregulator. Daxx has been shown to exhibit transcriptional repression activity by inhibiting the transcription factor Pax3 and ETS1 through direct protein-protein interactions (22Hollenbach A.D. Sublett J.E. McPherson C.J. Grosveld G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3702-3711Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 23Li R. Pei H. Watson D.K. Papas T.S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Most recently, Emelyanov et al.reported that Daxx acts as a transcriptional co-activator or co-repressor of Pax5 in different cellular contexts (24Emelyanov A.V. Kovac C.R. Sepulveda M.A. Birshtein B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11156-11164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Although the exact mechanism accounting for these observations is still unclear, the recruitment of nuclear factors possessing either histone acetyltransferase or histone deacetylase activity by Daxx to modulate Pax5 transcriptional activity was proposed (24Emelyanov A.V. Kovac C.R. Sepulveda M.A. Birshtein B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11156-11164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In addition, the transcriptional repression effect of Daxx could be modulated by subnuclear compartmentalization through protein-protein interactions. We have recently demonstrated that overexpression of a nucleolar protein MSP58 alleviates the transcriptional repression elicited by Daxx, correlating well with sequestration of Daxx to the nucleolus via Daxx/MSP58 protein-protein interactions (25Lin D.Y. Shih H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25446-25456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Lehembreet al. has shown that SUMO-1-modified PML could relieve the transrepression effect of Daxx on Pax3 transcriptional activity through sequestering Daxx into the PODs (26Lehembre F. Muller S. Pandolfi P.P. Dejean A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Taken together, PML may exert its regulatory effect on transcription factor(s) through altering the compartmentalization of Daxx or other co-regulator(s). This notion led us to raise a question as to whether GR is also regulated by PML, at least in part, through Daxx sequestration to the PODs. In the present study, we have characterized both biochemical and functional interactions between Daxx and GR. Furthermore, the Daxx-mediated GR repression could be alleviated by the co-expression of wild-type PML but not by a sumoylation-defective PML mutant, which also fails to recruit Daxx to the PODs. Our findings thus provide the first evidence that Daxx could modulate the transcriptional activity of nuclear hormone receptor through protein-protein interactions and sheds light on the mechanism underlying the PML role in modulating nuclear hormone receptor function. LexA-Daxx, its deletion mutants LexA-MST3, LexA-lamin, HA-Daxx, and its derived mutant constructs have been described before (25Lin D.Y. Shih H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25446-25456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A mammalian GST-Daxx expression vector was generated by insertion of Daxx into pDEST 26 (Invitrogen). MMTV-Luc and pCMX-PML were kind gifts from Drs. Chawnshang Chang and Ronald Evan, respectively. pGal-AD-GR was engineered by inserting GR coding region into the BamHI andXhoI sites of yeast vector pACT2, which expresses the Gal4 activation domain (Clontech). pCMX-PML-ΔSUMO containing a lysine-to-arginine mutation at amino acid positions 65, 160, and 490 was created in three rounds consecutively of site-directed mutagenesis on the same template pCMX-PML. Site-directed mutagenesis was conducted by using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instruction (Stratagene). Yeast two-hybrid assays were performed as described (25Lin D.Y. Shih H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25446-25456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, L40 yeast strain was first transformed with individual bait and followed by the prey construct transformation. Yeast transformants were selected on medium lacking histidine, leucine, and tryptophan for four days. His+ colonies were further tested for β-galactosidase activity. Quantitative X-gal assays were performed with yeasts containing pairs of bait and prey plasmids as indicated. The X-gal activities were determined from three separate liquid yeast cultures according to the instructions of the Galacto-light Plus kit (Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA). All mammalian cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). COS-1, HeLa, and 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics. Cells were seeded into 10-cm plates the day before transfection. Transient transfections were carried out using a LipofectAMINE transfection kit (Invitrogen). Thirty-six hours after the transfection, cells were harvested for co-immunoprecipitation assays and Western blot analyses. For the reporter assays, 2–3 × 105 cells were seeded on 6-well plates for transfection. Four hours prior to transfection, cells received fresh medium with 10% dextran-coated charcoal-stripped FBS. A total of 2 μg of DNA were transfected, including β-galactosidase expression construct as an indicator for normalization of transfection efficiency. Following transfection, cells were cultured in the medium containing charcoal-stripped 0.05%(V/V) FBS with or without ∼10–100 nm dexamethasone and/or further treatment of 1 μm As2O3. Cell lysates were harvested 16 h later and assayed for relative activity (firefly luciferase for the reporter and β-galactosidase activity for the indicator) as the manufacture instructed (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For purification of GST and GST-Daxx fusion proteins, 293T cells were transfected with pDEST26 (Invitrogen) or pDEST26-Daxx. Cells were lysed 48 h later in buffer EM2 containing 50 nm HEPES (pH 7.6), 50 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) and centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were incubated with glutathione-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The bound proteins were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using antibody against GST protein. 35S-labeled GR protein was made with the TNT reticulocyte lysate system (Promega).35S-labeled proteins were incubated with GST or GST-Daxx-agarose beads, which contained equal amounts of protein in 0.2 ml of binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm EDTA) for 2 h, washed four times, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. To test the interaction in mammalian cells, wild-type GR along with HA-tagged Daxx expression construct was transfected into COS-1 cells by the lipofection method. Thirty-six hours after cotransfection, cells were solubilized in 1 ml of modified RIPA buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet-P40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cell lysates were mixed with antiserum against HA (Babco, Richmond, CA), Daxx (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, catalogue number sc-7152), or GR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalogue number sc-1004), and the immunocomplexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoblot analyses of precipitated proteins were performed as described previously (25Lin D.Y. Shih H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25446-25456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The anti-PML antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (catalogue number sc-966). COS-1 cells were plated onto collagen-coated (10 μm) coverslips the day before transfection. The expression vectors of HA-tagged Daxx or its deletion mutants or GR along with PML or PML sumoylation-defective mutant were transiently transfected into COS-1 cells. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells received fresh 0.05% stripped FBS and were cultured for an additional 12 h in the presence or absence of 100 nm Dex or 1 μm As2O3as indicated. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100. The permeabilized cells were then incubated with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody and an anti-GR polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number sc-1004) for 1 h at room temperature. Following this incubation, cells were washed three times for 10 min with phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature and then incubated at 8 μg/ml with fluorescein isothiocyanate and Texas Red-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (DAKO) for 1 h at 20 °C. Nuclei were revealed by DAPI staining (10 μg/ml). The coverslips were inverted, mounted on slides, and sealed with nail polish. Pictures were taken using a fluorescent microscopy. To test whether Daxx is involved in regulating GR transcriptional activation, the Daxx expression construct was cotransfected into COS-1 cells along with the GR expression construct and the MMTV-Luc reporter. As shown in Fig.1 A, Daxx suppressed GR-mediated transactivation in a dose-dependent fashion. By contrast, a transcriptional co-activator, GRIP1, potentiated the transactivation ability of GR. Furthermore, the repressive effect of Daxx on GR was also observed in other cell lines, such as HeLa and 293T cells (Fig. 1 B), indicating that the Daxx-dependent GR repression is not a cell type-specific event. To explore whether the transcriptional repression of GR by Daxx is through the direct protein-protein interaction between Daxx and GR, we first performed the co-immunoprecipitation experiments. COS-1 cells were cotransfected with expression constructs encoding GR and HA-Daxx and followed by treatment of dexamethasone. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation assays with an anti-GR antibody followed by Western blot analyses with an anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 2 A, Daxx was detected in the immunoprecipitated complexes of GR (top panel,lane 4). This interaction was also validated in a reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation assay (data not shown). These results suggest that Daxx and GR can associate to form complexes in mammalian cells. To further test whether this association is through direct protein-protein interaction, GST pull-down assays were performed using GST-Daxx fusion protein and in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled GR. As shown in Fig.2 B, GR was specifically pulled down by GST-Daxx but not by GST protein, indicating that GR binds to Daxx directly. It should be noted that the interaction between GR and Daxx was not affected by the presence or absence of dexamethasone. To further substantiate the observed direct protein-protein interaction between Daxx and GR, we also carried out the yeast two-hybrid assays. The GR cDNA clone was subcloned in frame into pACT2 vector (Gal AD-GR) and subsequently analyzed with different bait proteins (Daxx, MST3, and lamin) for the ability to activate His3 and LacZ reporter genes. As summarized in Fig. 3 B, yeast co-transformed with GalAD-GR and LexA-Daxx was able to form colonies in the medium plate lacking histidine, indicating a positive interaction between GR and Daxx. Again, this interaction is specific since no interaction between GR and lamin or MST3 was detected. The interaction was further verified by liquid β-galactosidase assay (Fig. 3 C). Taken together, our results clearly demonstrated that GR interacts with Daxx through direct protein-protein interactions. To delineate the region(s) of Daxx that is involved in Daxx/GR interaction, various deletion constructs of Daxx were engineered (Fig. 3 A) and subjected to analyses in yeast two-hybrid assays. The strength of interaction was scored by the colony growth in histidine-auxotroph-selective medium and quantified by liquid β-galactosidase assay. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the C terminus-deleted Daxx (amino acids 1–501 and 1–625) failed to interact with GR. In contrast, the mutant with a deletion of amino acid residues 1–501 of Daxx was still capable of interacting with GR, albeit the strength of interaction with GR was less than that from the full-length Daxx. Additionally, consistent results were also observed with the liquid β-galactosidase assay. Altogether, these results implicated that the C-terminal region of Daxx is necessary and sufficient for its interaction with GR. To establish the correlation between interaction and GR transcriptional repression by Daxx, these Daxx mutants were analyzed for their respective abilities to repress GR transactivation. As illustrated in Fig. 3 D, overexpression of Daxx-(501–740), like full-length Daxx, was capable of suppressing GR-mediated transcriptional activation, whereas both Daxx-(1–501) and Daxx-(1–625) failed to do so, indicating that the C-terminal region of Daxx is sufficient for Daxx-mediated GR transrepression. Taken together, these findings provide direct evidence that the interaction between Daxx and GR correlates well with Daxx function as a GR transrepressor. Recent studies indicated that PML overexpression reverses the Daxx-dependent transcriptional repression and such a de-repression correlates well with the ability of sumoylated PML to sequester Daxx to the PODs (21Li H. Leo C. Zhu J. Wu X. O'Neil J. Park E.J. Chen J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1784-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In this scenario, we anticipated that PML should be able to relieve the Daxx transrepression on GR activity. To test this possibility, COS-1 cells were cotransfected with PML expression construct along with the expression constructs harboring either full-length Daxx or Daxx-(501–740) and assayed for GR transactivation potential. As shown in Fig.4 A, overexpression of PML resulted in a reduction of transrepression elicited by both Daxx and Daxx-(501–740) on GR in a dose-dependent manner. To further unveil whether this de-repression by PML correlates with the recruitment of Daxx to the PODs, immunofluorescent analyses were performed. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with a combination of GR, PML, HA-Daxx, HA-Daxx-(1–625), and HA-Daxx-(501–740) as indicated and then subsequently stained with the appropriate antibodies, followed by immunofluorescence analysis. When HA-Daxx or HA-Daxx-(501–740) was overexpressed alone, a fairly diffuse and evenly distributed staining pattern was observed through the nucleus (Fig.4 B, a and i). By contrast, HA-Daxx-(1–625) gave an exclusively cytoplasmic staining pattern (e), suggesting that the C-terminal region of Daxx-(626–740) is required for the nuclear localization. Notably, co-expression of PML resulted in a dramatic change of HA-Daxx and HA-Daxx-(501–740) distribution patterns (b andj), as evidenced by the Daxx-PML colocalized to the PODs (d and l). Conversely, the cytoplasmic distribution of HA-Daxx-(1–625) was not altered by PML, supporting the previous findings that PML fails to interact with Daxx-(1–625) (h). Taken together, these findings evidently suggest that the de-repression by PML is through its ability to sequester Daxx to PODs. It is very worthy of knowing that the distribution of GR was not altered upon PML overexpression (Fig. 4 B, m), consistent with the notion that PML did not directly bind to GR (11Doucas V. Tini M. Egan D.A. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2627-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). 2D.-Y. Lin and H.-M. Shih, unpublished data. To further substantiate that the recruitment of Daxx by PML to PODs plays an important role in regulating GR transcriptional activity, a PML sumoylation-defective mutant was subjected to the same analyses for its ability to recruit Daxx to the PODs and to reverse the transrepression elicited by Daxx on GR. Notably, co-expression of sumoylation-defective PML mutant failed to recruit Daxx from nucleoplasm to PODs (Fig. 5 A). As expected, sumoylation-defective PML mutant, unlike the wild-type PML, was unable to relieve the Daxx transrepression effect on GR (Fig.5 B), indicating that the Daxx-mediated GR transrepression and the recruitment of Daxx to PODs by PML are an interdependent event. To further demonstrate the effect exerted by PML on the Daxx-dependent GR transrepression and the Daxx nuclear compartmentalization, we treated COS-1 cells with As2O3. As2O3 has been shown to promote the SUMO-1 modification of PML, which in turn induces the recruitment of PML and Daxx to the PODs (19Torii S. Egan D.A. Evans R.A. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6037-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 21Li H. Leo C. Zhu J. Wu X. O'Neil J. Park E.J. Chen J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1784-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 26Lehembre F. Muller S. Pandolfi P.P. Dejean A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6 A, As2O3 treatment caused a marked increase of the number of POD formation, as evidenced by immunofluorescent analysis of endogenous PML (a and d). This treatment also rendered the redistribution of endogenous Daxx from nucleoplasm to the PODs, leading to the co-localization of Daxx with PML (b ande). Coordinately, As2O3 treatment resulted in an increment of the GR-mediated transcriptional activity (Fig. 6 B). Taken together, the results of transient cotransfection assays and immunofluorescence studies unequivocally indicate that PML potentiates GR transcriptional activation by compartmentalizing Daxx from nucleoplasm to the PODs.Figure 6As2O3stimulates the translocation of Daxx to PODs and potentiates the GR-mediated transactivation. A, COS-1 cells were treated with 1 μm As2O3 for 12 h, and then double immunofluorescence staining of endogenous Daxx and PML was performed. The staining pattern was determined as in Fig. 4 A. B, COS-1 cells were transfected with the MMTV-Luc reporter and GR expression constructs. Following the transfection, cells were pretreated with 100 nm Dex for 12 h and then incubated in medium with or without 1 μm As2O3 for another 12 h. Luciferase activity was then determined as described above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the present studies, we have identified Daxx as a GR-interacting protein and demonstrated that Daxx regulates the GR transcriptional activation on MMTV promoter. We provided biochemical evidence that Daxx associates with GR in yeast, in vitro, and in mammalian cells. The interaction between GR and Daxx is mediated through the C-terminal region of Daxx. Furthermore, co-expression of PML relieves the transcriptional repression by Daxx, correlating well with the recruitment of Daxx from the nucleoplasm to the PODs. Our findings not only provide the first direct link between Daxx expression and GR activity but also shed some light on the molecular mechanism underlying the role of PML in regulating GR transcriptional potential. Daxx was initially identified as the adaptor molecule between Fas receptor and Jun N-terminal kinase in Fas-mediated apoptosis (27Yang X. Khosravi-Far R. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). However, accumulated evidence suggested that Daxx might function as a transcriptional repressor through its interaction with a growing number of transcription factors. Daxx has been shown to repress the basal activity by a heterologous TK promoter through Gal4DBD-Daxx fusion (19Torii S. Egan D.A. Evans R.A. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6037-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar,21Li H. Leo C. Zhu J. Wu X. O'Neil J. Park E.J. Chen J.D. Mol. Cell.

Daxx was also reported to inhibit the activity of the transcriptional activators Pax3 and ETS1 (22Hollenbach A.D. Sublett J.E. McPherson C.J. Grosveld G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3702-3711Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 23Li R. Pei H. Watson D.K. Papas T.S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). While Daxx overexpression inhibited the endogenous Pax5 transcriptional activity in the human HS-Sultan cell line and the murine plasmacytoma J558L cell line, Daxx potentiated Pax5 transcriptional activity in M12.4.1 and A20 murine B cells (24Emelyanov A.V. Kovac C.R. Sepulveda M.A. Birshtein B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11156-11164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In the present study, we further demonstrated that Daxx could suppress the GR-mediated transcriptional activation of MMTV reporter. The transrepressional effect of Daxx on GR activity has also been demonstrated in several cell lines, indicating that this repressive effect is likely not a cell type-specific event. Furthermore, we also provided biochemical and cell biological evidence that the C-terminal region of Daxx is necessary and sufficient to interact with GR and repress GR transcriptional activity. Intriguingly, this C-terminal region of Daxx has also been reported to interact with other transcription factors, such as Pax3, Pax5, and ETS1 (19Torii S. Egan D.A. Evans R.A. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6037-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 23Li R. Pei H. Watson D.K. Papas T.S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 24Emelyanov A.V.

Commun. 2000; 279: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Conceivably, the C-terminal region of Daxx acts as a major docking domain for protein-protein interactions. To our knowledge, it is not yet demonstrated how this domain provides a binding surface for these proteins with such distinctive functions. However, we postulate that Daxx is likely involved in the signaling pathway cross-talks through competitive binding by distinct factors to the specific motif(s) located within the C-terminal domain of Daxx. Although Daxx functions as a transcriptional co-repressor, the molecular mechanism as to how it suppresses the transcriptional activation remains largely unknown. Previous report showed that the treatment with a deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A, efficiently reversed the repressive effect of Daxx (21Li H. Leo C. Zhu J. Wu X. O'Neil J. Park E.J. Chen J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1784-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), suggesting that histone deacetylation may be involved in Daxx-mediated transcriptional repression. Consistently, interaction between the Daxx and HDAC1 has been demonstrated by in vitro pull-down assay and in vivo overexpression experiments (21Li H. Leo C. Zhu J. Wu X. O'Neil J. Park E.J. Chen J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1784-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Hollenbachet al. has recently shown that endogenous hDaxx eluted from size exclusion chromatography column has an apparent molecular mass of 360 kDa and associates with multiple proteins that are critical for transcriptional repression, such as histone deacetylase II, components of chromatin such as core histone H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, and a chromatin-associated protein Dek (33Hollenbach A.D. McPherson C.J. Mientjes E.J. Iyengar R. Grosveld G. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3319-3330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The findings of the hDaxx association with histone deacetylase are consistent with our notion that HDACs play an essential role in Daxx-mediated transcriptional modulation via chromatin remodeling processes. Moreover, that Daxx was reported to be associated with condensed chromatin in the cells lacking PML (20Ishov A.M. Sotnikov A.G. Negorev D. Vladimirova O.V. Neff N. Kamitani T. Yeh E.T. Strauss III, J.F. Maul G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar) also supports the role of Daxx in the establishment and/or maintenance of a transcriptionally silenced chromatin structure. Whether overexpressed Daxx results in silencing the chromatin structure of GR-regulated genes remains to be explored. Another main feature of the present study is to explore the mechanism as to how PML regulates GR transcriptional activity. PML has been proposed to function as a transcription cofactor through recruiting co-activators (13Borden K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5259-5269Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 34Lin R.J. Sternsdorf T. Tini M. Evans R.M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7204-7215Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). For example, PML has been shown to potentiate the transactivation activity of AP-1 and progesterone receptor (35Guiochon-Mantel A. Savouret J.F. Quignon F. Delabre K. Milgrom E. De The H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1791-1803PubMed Google Scholar,36Vallian S. Gaken J.A. Gingold E.B. Kouzarides T. Chang K.S. Farzaneh F. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2843-2853Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Further studies revealed that PML does not interact directly with either Jun/Fos or progesterone receptor but instead targets transcriptional co-activators, such as CBP and TIF1α (11Doucas V. Tini M. Egan D.A. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2627-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 36Vallian S. Gaken J.A. Gingold E.B. Kouzarides T. Chang K.S. Farzaneh F. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2843-2853Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 37Zhong S. Delva L. Rachez C. Cenciarelli C. Gandini D. Zhang H. Kalantry S. Freedman L.P. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). PML binds to CBP in vitro, promotes CBP localization to PODs, and enhances transcriptional activity of nuclear receptors such as GR and retinoid-X receptor in transient transfection assays (11Doucas V. Tini M. Egan D.A. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2627-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Similarly, a co-activator complex, composed of PML, TIF1α, and CBP, is recruited to retinoic acid response element, suggesting that PML is a co-activator for retinoic acid receptors (37Zhong S. Delva L. Rachez C. Cenciarelli C. Gandini D. Zhang H. Kalantry S. Freedman L.P. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In this study, we propose an alternative regulatory route for PML in modulating GR transactivation function. The recruitment of Daxx to PODs by PML may represent another mechanism whereby the activity of the GR is activated. Our results clearly demonstrated that wild-type but not sumoylation-defective PML is critical for attenuating transrepression effect of Daxx on GR by translocating Daxx to the PODs. Likewise, that As2O3-treatment enhanced GR transcriptional activation utilizes a similar mechanism by modulating Daxx localization. These findings are consistent with the established notion from recent studies that SUMO-1 modification of PML is required for both the sequestration of Daxx to the PODs and efficient inhibition of Daxx-mediated repression. One may hypothesize that retention of Daxx into PODs through PML overexpression would prevent the access of Daxx to GR, subsequently impeding its repressive action. Likewise, Lehembreet al. have recently reported that SUMO-1-modified PML could derepress Pax3 transcriptional activity through sequestration of the Daxx repressor into the PODs (26Lehembre F. Muller S. Pandolfi P.P. Dejean A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that PML may modulate the activities of a variety of transcription factors by altering the compartmentalization of its respective co-repressor(s) to the PODs. Comparable to this scenario, we have recently identified that nucleolar protein MSP58 can enhance the transactivation potential by sequestering Daxx to the nucleolus (25Lin D.Y. Shih H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25446-25456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In light of these observations, PODs and/or nucleolus may participate to the transcriptional activation of specific target genes by tethering co-repressors, such as Daxx, from the diffuse nuclear fraction where transcription takes place."
https://openalex.org/W1604356365,"In platelets, bidirectional signaling across integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) regulates fibrinogen binding, cytoskeletal reorganization, cell aggregation, and spreading. Because these responses may be influenced by the clustering of alpha(IIb)beta(3) heterodimers into larger oligomers, we established two independent methods to detect integrin clustering and evaluate factors that regulate this process. In the first, weakly complementing beta-galactosidase mutants were fused to the C terminus of individual alpha(IIb) subunits, and the chimeras were stably expressed with beta(3) in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Clustering of alpha(IIb)beta(3) should bring the mutants into proximity and reconstitute beta-galactosidase activity. In the second method, alpha(IIb) was fused to either a green fluorescent protein (GFP) or Renilla luciferase and transiently expressed with beta(3). Here, integrin clustering should stimulate bioluminescence resonance energy transfer between a cell-permeable luciferase substrate and GFP. These methods successfully detected integrin clustering induced by anti-alpha(IIb)beta(3) antibodies. Significantly, they also detected clustering upon soluble fibrinogen binding to alpha(IIb)beta(3). In contrast, no clustering was observed following direct activation of alpha(IIb)beta(3) by MnCl(2) or an anti-alpha(IIb)beta(3)-activating antibody Fab in the absence of fibrinogen. Intracellular events also influenced alpha(IIb)beta(3) clustering. For example, a cell-permeable, bivalent FK506-binding protein (FKBP) ligand stimulated clustering when added to cells expressing an alpha(IIb)(FKBP)(2) chimera complexed with beta(3). Furthermore, alpha(IIb)beta(3) clustering occurred in the presence of latrunculin A or cytochalasin D, inhibitors of actin polymerization. These effects were enhanced by fibrinogen, suggesting that actin-regulated clustering modulates alpha(IIb)beta(3) interaction with ligands. These studies in living cells establish that alpha(IIb)beta(3) clustering is modulated by fibrinogen and actin dynamics. More broadly, they should facilitate investigations of the mechanisms and consequences of integrin clustering."
https://openalex.org/W1998481937,"Optimal conditions for RecA protein-mediated DNA strand exchange include 6–8 mm Mg2+ in excess of that required to form complexes with ATP. We provide evidence that the free magnesium ion is required to mediate a conformational change in the RecA protein C terminus that activates RecA-mediated DNA strand exchange. In particular, a “closed” (low Mg2+) conformation of a RecA nucleoprotein filament restricts DNA pairing by incoming duplex DNA, although single-stranded overhangs at the ends of a duplex allow limited DNA pairing to occur. The addition of excess Mg2+ results in an “open” conformation, which can promote efficient DNA pairing and strand exchange regardless of DNA end structure. The removal of 17 amino acid residues at theEscherichia coli RecA C terminus eliminates a measurable requirement for excess Mg2+ and permits efficient DNA pairing and exchange similar to that seen with the wild-type protein at high Mg2+ levels. Thus, the RecA C terminus imposes the need for the high magnesium ion concentrations requisite in RecA reactions in vitro. We propose that the C terminus acts as a regulatory switch, modulating the access of double-stranded DNA to the presynaptic filament and thereby inhibiting homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange at low magnesium ion concentrations.

RecA is a DNA-dependent ATPase that catalyzes an in vitro DNA strand exchange reaction between single-stranded (ssDNA)1 and homologous double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecules. The DNA strand exchange reaction takes place in several stages (Fig. 1). The RecA protein forms a nucleoprotein filament that completely encompasses the circular ssDNA. This filament then aligns the bound single strand with a homologous duplex DNA to form a DNA pairing intermediate often referred to as a joint molecule. 1000 base pairs of DNA can be aligned and exchanged in a joint molecule under the empirically defined optimal reaction conditions, which typically include 1–3 mm ATP and about 10 mm magnesium ion. All steps to this point, including the formation of joint molecules, require ATP but not ATP hydrolysis. ATP hydrolysis is needed only to complete the late stages of strand exchange of long DNA substrates, often derived from bacteriophage DNAs. Whereas DNA pairing, leading to joint molecule formation, can occur at either end of a linear duplex, the subsequent and ATP hydrolysis-dependent extension of the nascently paired regions is unidirectional, proceeding 5′ to 3′ relative to ssDNA initially bound in the filament. Thus, exchange proceeds in one direction along the linear duplex, and joints formed at the “wrong” end in the pairing phase are eliminated. In a DNA strand exchange involving quite long DNAs that leads to nicked circular product formation, the ends of the duplex where the exchange begins and ends are referred to as proximal and distal, respectively (Fig.1) (1Lusetti S.L. Cox M.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 71-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 2Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 63: 310-366Google Scholar). Examination of the conditions for an optimal RecA protein-catalyzed DNA strand exchange reaction reveals an unexplored enigma. Magnesium forms a relatively strong 1:1 complex with ATP (3Phillips R.C. George P. Rutman R.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1966; 88: 2631-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and should be required at concentrations equal to the ATP added to the reaction. However, optimal rates and yields in RecA-mediated DNA strand exchange require an additional 6–8 mm of “free” Mg2+ (4Cox M.M. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8523-8532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Shibata T. Das Gupta C. Cunningham R.P. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1638-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 6Roman L.J. Kowalczykowski S.C. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7375-7385Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Some of this magnesium ion is associated with the DNA, but the DNA concentration in most experiments is on the order of a few (1–20) μm in total nucleotides (and backbone phosphate) and thus could not complex more than a small fraction of the available magnesium ion. Lower magnesium concentrations, more stoichiometric with the added ATP, are sufficient for primary DNA binding. Some homologous DNA pairing occurs in the presence of ATPγS, an analog that is not appreciably hydrolyzed, but the higher magnesium ion concentrations are required for the generation of long hybrid DNA products with ATP (7Honigberg S.M. Gonda D.K. Flory J. Radding C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11845-11851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extra Mg2+ is contributing something significant to the reaction, but the effects have not been explained. The question is intriguing, since the free magnesium ion requirements for RecA protein-mediated DNA strand exchange in vitroappear to exceed what is available in vivo. Mg2+is present at about 100 mm in a bacterial cell (8Kuhn A. Kellenberger E. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 906-912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kuhn A.H. Jutte H. Kellenberger E. J. Virol. 1983; 47: 540-552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lusk J.E. Williams R.J. Kennedy E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2618-2624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but almost all of this is bound up in ribosomes and DNA. The level of free magnesium ion is thought to be on the order of 1 or 2 mm at most (11Alatossava T. Jutte H. Kuhn A. Kellenberger E. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 413-419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on in vitro data, the RecA protein should be almost inactive in the cell, although the crowding effect of thein vivo environment may moderate the effects of low available Mg2+ (12Lavery P.E. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9307-9314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is a decreased requirement for magnesium ion in the presence of volume-occupying agents such as polyethylene glycol or polyvinyl alcohol, utilized to approximate the crowded environment of the cell, suggesting that an active conformation of RecA protein can be stabilized by either excess magnesium ion or the presence of crowding reagents at low magnesium (12Lavery P.E. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9307-9314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The RecA protein has a small C-terminal domain extending from residue 270 to the protein terminus at residue 352, the function of which has not been fully explored (1Lusetti S.L. Cox M.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 71-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 13Kowalczykowski S.C. Eggleston A.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 991-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The last 24 amino acid residues of the RecA protein are disordered in the published RecA protein crystal structures (14Story R.M. Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 15Story R.M. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 374-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 16Datta S. Prabu M.M. Vaze M.B. Ganesh N. Chandra N.R. Muniyappa K. Vijayan M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4964-4973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We refer to this region as the RecA C terminus (as opposed to the entire C-terminal domain). Within this region, 7 of 25 amino acid residues are negatively charged. In addition to a general lack of structural information about the RecA C terminus, there has been little indication that this part of the protein has functional significance. Several C-terminal deletion mutants of the E. coli RecA protein have been characterized. Deletion from the C terminus of either 25 amino acid residues (17Tateishi S. Horii T. Ogawa T. Ogawa H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 115-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), or a fragment making up about 15% of the RecA polypeptide (18Benedict R.C. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15513-15520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), resulted in faster nucleation, leading to filament formation on dsDNA. A proposal was advanced that the effect could be attributed to the elimination of electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged residues in the C terminus and the phosphates in the DNA (17Tateishi S. Horii T. Ogawa T. Ogawa H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 115-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 18Benedict R.C. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15513-15520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both C-terminal deletion mutants promoted DNA strand exchange under at least some conditions, and the larger deletion exhibited an enhanced DNA strand exchange in the absence of single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) (17Tateishi S. Horii T. Ogawa T. Ogawa H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 115-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 18Benedict R.C. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15513-15520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The larger deletion exhibited ATPase and ssDNA binding activities similar to wild-type (18Benedict R.C. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15513-15520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 25-residue deletion bound to ssDNA more tightly in some assays (17Tateishi S. Horii T. Ogawa T. Ogawa H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 115-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A 25-residue C-terminal deletion of the RecA protein of Proteus mirabilis also exhibited improved binding to dsDNA (19Rusche J.R. Konigsberg W. Howard-Flanders P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 949-955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additional C-terminal deletions of RecA protein have also been constructed and studied, but without detailed biochemical characterization. A construct that removes most of the C-terminal domain (75 residues), when expressed with wild-type RecA, interferes with recombinational DNA repair and increases UV sensitivity slightly (20Yarranton G.T. Sedgwick S.G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1982; 185: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A 17-residue C-terminal deletion mutant was shown not to affect UV resistance, induction of the SOS response, recombination, or Weigle reactivation when expressed on its own (21Larminat F. Defais M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A small effect on conjugational recombination was observed when the same mutant and wild-type proteins were both present in vivo (21Larminat F. Defais M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Removal of 18 residues from the C terminus resulted in a substantial conformational change in RecA filaments bound to dsDNA, suggesting an allosteric relationship between the C terminus and the RecA core domain (22Yu X. Egelman E.H. J. Struct. Biol. 1991; 106: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the previous paper (23Lusetti S.L. Wood E.A. Fleming C.D. Modica M.J. Korth J. Abbott L. Dwyer D.W. Roca A.I. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16372-16380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), we characterized a set of RecA C-terminal deletion mutant proteins designed to systematically test the role of the acidic amino acids located in the C terminus of the RecA protein. Removal of the last 13 (RecAΔC13), 17 (RecAΔC17), or 25 amino acid residues (RecAΔC25) increased the rate of binding to dsDNA. The C-terminal deletions also produced a profound effect on the pH dependence of RecA protein-promoted DNA strand exchange reactions relative to the wild-type protein. Ionizable groups in the C-terminal region and others elsewhere in the protein appear to contribute to the pH reaction profile. In the present study, we show that the negatively charged C terminus of the RecA protein has a modulating function on the DNA strand exchange activity of RecA protein. In the absence of free magnesium ion, the C terminus locks the protein in a conformation in which the initiation of DNA strand exchange is inhibited. When the free magnesium ion concentration is increased to 6–8 mm, the DNA strand exchange function of RecA is activated. The results suggest that magnesium ion interacts directly with RecA protein, altering the conformation of the C terminus. The wild-type E. coliRecA, RecAΔC6, RecAΔC13, and RecAΔC17 proteins were purified as described (23Lusetti S.L. Wood E.A. Fleming C.D. Modica M.J. Korth J. Abbott L. Dwyer D.W. Roca A.I. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16372-16380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). A plasmid containing the recA E343K mutant (pEAW166) was constructed using PCR site-directed mutagenesis. The RecA E343K point mutant protein was expressed and purified as described for the wild-type RecA protein (23Lusetti S.L. Wood E.A. Fleming C.D. Modica M.J. Korth J. Abbott L. Dwyer D.W. Roca A.I. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16372-16380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The concentrations of the purified RecA proteins were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using the extinction coefficient of 2.23 × 104m−1 cm−1 (24Craig N.L. Roberts J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8039-8044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E. coliSSB was purchased from Sigma. The concentration of the purified SSB protein was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using the extinction coefficient of 2.83 × 104m−1 cm−1 (25Lohman T.M. Overman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3594-3603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise noted, all reagents were purchased from Fisher. ATPγS was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Dithiothreitol was obtained from Research Organics. Phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate kinase, ATP, bromphenol blue, and NADH were purchased from Sigma. Restriction endonucleases EcoRI, PstI, and SmaI were obtained from New England Biolabs. Circular single-stranded and supercoiled circular duplex DNAs from bacteriophage M13mp8 (7229 bp) were prepared using previously described methods (26Davis R.W. Botstein D. Roth J.R. Advanced Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1980: 70-82Google Scholar, 27Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 20-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (3419) Google Scholar, 28Neuendorf S.K. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8276-8282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Except where specifically noted otherwise, full-length linear duplex DNA was generated by the digestion of M13mp8 supercoiled bacteriophage DNA with the EcoRI restriction endonuclease, using conditions suggested by the enzyme supplier. The digested DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), followed by ethanol precipitation. The concentrations of ssDNA and dsDNA solutions were determined by absorbance at 260 nm, using 36 and 50 μg ml−1 A 260−1, respectively, as conversion factors. All DNA concentrations are given in μm nucleotides. Three-strand exchange reactions were carried out in 25 mm Tris-OAc buffer (80% cation) or 25 mm MES buffer (33% anion) (reaction pH 7.3 and 6.0, respectively, after the addition of all reaction components), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% (w/v) glycerol, 3 mmpotassium glutamate, and the indicated concentration of Mg(OAc)2. Reactions also contained an ATP regeneration system of 10 units/ml pyruvate kinase and 3.1 mmphosphoenolpyruvate. All incubations are carried out at 37 °C. The wild-type RecA, RecAΔC6, RecAΔC13, or RecAΔC17 proteins (6.7 μm) were preincubated with 20 μm M13mp8 circular ssDNA for 10 min. SSB protein (2 μm) and the indicated amount of ATP were then added, followed by another 10-min incubation. The reactions were initiated by the addition of M13mp8 linear dsDNA to 20 μm. A 10-μl aliquot was removed to use as a zero time point, the reaction was incubated, and at the indicated time points 10-μl aliquots were removed and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 μl of a solution containing 60 mm EDTA, 6% SDS, 25% (w/v) glycerol, and 0.2% bromphenol blue. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis at 10–20 mA in 0.8% agarose gels with 1× TAE buffer (40 mm Tris-OAc, 80% cation, and 1 mm EDTA), stained with ethidium bromide, and exposed to ultraviolet light. Gel images were captured with a digital CCD camera utilizing GelExpert software (Nucleotech). DNA bands were quantitated with the software package TotalLab version 1.10 from Phoretix. The purpose of this study was to examine the magnesium ion dependence of DNA strand exchange reactions promoted by RecA C-terminal deletion mutants. We focused on the RecAΔC6, RecAΔC13, and RecAΔC17 proteins described in the previous paper (23Lusetti S.L. Wood E.A. Fleming C.D. Modica M.J. Korth J. Abbott L. Dwyer D.W. Roca A.I. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16372-16380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Under the standard reaction conditions for DNA strand exchange promoted by wild-type RecA protein, the C-terminal deletion mutants promote a significantly slower reaction (23Lusetti S.L. Wood E.A. Fleming C.D. Modica M.J. Korth J. Abbott L. Dwyer D.W. Roca A.I. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16372-16380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We set out to find reaction conditions that improve the efficiency of the mutant protein-catalyzed DNA strand exchange in an attempt to understand the role of the negatively charged C terminus in the RecA-promoted DNA strand exchange reaction. In an attempt to find the optimal strand exchange conditions for the C-terminal deletion mutants, magnesium titrations were carried out. DNA strand exchange reactions were carried out in Tris-OAc buffer (reaction pH 7.3) at 3 mm ATP and magnesium ion concentrations from 0 to 40 mm (Fig. 2). For each protein, the final extent of strand exchange increases to an optimum and then decreases as the concentration of magnesium ion is increased. For the wild-type RecA protein, this optimum occurs at about 10 mm magnesium ion, in line with many results published over a period of two decades (4Cox M.M. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8523-8532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Shibata T. Das Gupta C. Cunningham R.P. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1638-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 6Roman L.J. Kowalczykowski S.C. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7375-7385Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Significantly, the deletion lacking 17 amino acids (RecAΔC17) exhibits optimal activity at magnesium ion concentrations that are now roughly equivalent to the ATP concentration. Higher magnesium ion concentrations are inhibitory. The optimal magnesium ion concentrations observed for the RecAΔC6 and RecAΔC13 mutants fall between the other two, so that the magnesium ion requirements for the reaction decline as more of the C terminus is removed. When reactions are compared at their respective optima, strand exchange reactions progress to similar extents for all of the wild-type and mutant RecA proteins. Just as the magnesium ion concentration needed for an optimal reaction declines as the C terminus of RecA is truncated, the magnesium ion concentrations needed to see inhibition of the strand exchange reaction also decline. At magnesium ion concentrations above 15 mm, strand exchange products by the wild-type RecA protein include large DNA complexes that do not readily enter the gel. These large complexes are protein-dependent (data not shown), are not resolved in 120 min, and appear at successively lower magnesium ion concentrations for the C-terminal deletion mutants. The yield of DNA strand exchange products produced by each protein after 60 min, at magnesium ion concentrations between 0 and 10 mm was quantitated (Fig. 3). The products in this experiment include the bands corresponding to the complex species in the well, joint molecules, and nicked circular products of DNA strand exchange. These were totaled and divided by the amount of all dsDNA (the above bands plus the linear dsDNA substrate) in the lane. The bands at the well were included in the quantitation because they are protein-dependent and because they are needed to account for all of the DNA in the lane. The magnesium ion concentration required for maximum conversion of substrate DNA into these products is ∼10 mm for wild-type RecA, as has been reported by several laboratories (4Cox M.M. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8523-8532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Shibata T. Das Gupta C. Cunningham R.P. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

As amino acid residues are removed from the carboxyl terminus, the mutant proteins promote an optimal DNA strand exchange reaction at progressively lower concentrations of magnesium ion (Fig. 3). In order to determine whether the RecAΔC17 deletion mutant's optimal strand exchange conditions were dependent on the ATP concentration, strand exchange reactions were carried out at several ATP concentrations (1, 3, and 6 mm), with the reaction extent examined as a function of magnesium acetate concentration. At either 1 or 6 mm ATP (Fig.4), the deletion mutant promotes an optimal strand exchange reaction at a magnesium level approximately equal to the ATP. Conversely, at 1 mm ATP, wild-type RecA protein still requires 10 mm magnesium ion and requires an even higher magnesium ion concentration when 6 mm ATP is present. The reactions were quantitated such that only the nicked circular final product of strand exchange was determined as a percentage of all the duplex DNA species present (Fig.5). It is clear that the wild-type RecA protein requires excess magnesium, above what is needed to complex with ATP. As the ATP concentration increases, the concentration of magnesium ion needed for an optimal reaction remains at 6–8 mm above the ATP concentration. When the C-terminal 17 amino acids are removed from the protein, the optimal DNA strand exchange reaction is observed at a magnesium ion concentration that closely parallels the concentration of ATP.Figure 5The effects of Mg2+concentration on DNA strand exchange, as a function of ATP concentration: Quantitation. Reactions promoted by wild-type RecA (circles, top panel) and the RecAΔC17 C-terminal deletion mutant (squares,bottom panel) are shown as a function of magnesium and ATP concentration. The quantitation was carried out as described under “Results.” The percentage of duplex substrate converted to reaction product (nicked circular duplex) at 60 min is plotted versus magnesium ion concentration for the wild-type RecA and RecAΔC17 proteins when 1 mm ATP (crossed symbols; data from Fig. 4), 3 mm ATP (open symbols; data from Fig.2), or 6 mm ATP (closed symbols; data from Fig. 4) is used in the DNA strand exchange reaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) One of the results in Fig. 2 conflicts with a recently published result from our laboratory (29Rice K.P. Eggler A.L. Sung P. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38570-38581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), in which the wild-type RecA protein promoted the formation of significant levels of nicked circular product in DNA strand exchange reactions throughout a range of 1–11 mm Mg(OAc)2 (although the optimal reaction was still seen with 11 mmMg2+, the reaction was significant but much reduced at 1 mm). As in many of the current trials, the ATP concentration was 3 mm. This result appeared to contradict not only the results above, but also other published results indicating that wild-type RecA protein does not promote DNA strand exchange reactions at low magnesium ion concentrations (7Honigberg S.M. Gonda D.K. Flory J. Radding C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11845-11851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated this apparent inconsistency in results. The DNA strand exchange reaction results in Fig. 6 address this issue. The DNA substrates utilized in the Rice et al. study were derived from φX174 bacteriophage, and the linear dsDNA substrate was generated by digestion of circular dsDNA with the PstI endonuclease (29Rice K.P. Eggler A.L. Sung P. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38570-38581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This treatment generates 3′ overhangs at the DNA ends, which are distinct from the 5′ overhangs in the duplex DNA substrates used in Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5. To determine whether the overhangs play a role in the reaction, we carried out DNA strand exchange reactions with M13mp8 linear dsDNA substrates generated by circular dsDNA digestion with the restriction enzyme PstI,EcoRI, or SmaI to generate 3′ overhangs, 5′ overhangs, or blunt ends, respectively (Fig. 6). PstI and EcoRI both leave 4-nucleotide overhangs. At 10 mm magnesium ion, the results of wild-type RecA reactions using the different linear dsDNA ends are virtually indistinguishable, whereas at 3 mm magnesium ion, appreciable amounts of the nicked circular final product of strand exchange can be seen only when 3′ overhangs are utilized. We note that the wild-type mediated reaction with the EcoRI-cleaved DNA (5′ overhangs) did result in more reaction intermediates than the blunt-ended DNA, although they were not converted to quantitatable final products. The 5′ overhangs would be complementary to the circular ssDNA, and thus enhance DNA pairing, at the distal end of the linear duplex. The RecAΔC17 protein appears to not require any particular end, regardless of the magnesium ion concentration. DNA strand exchange (with long DNA substrates) generally does not proceed past the formation of joint molecules when ATP is not hydrolyzed. However, the initiation of DNA pairing in the presence of ATPγS should occur in a manner similar to the more extended DNA strand exchange. As is the case for the DNA strand exchange reaction with ATP, the optimal conditions for RecA protein-promoted formation of joint molecule intermediates in the presence of ATPγS include magnesium ion concentrations in significant excess relative to the ATPγS that is present (30Menetski J.P. Bear D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of DNA overhangs on both wild-type RecA and RecAΔC17-promoted DNA strand exchange reactions. The linear dsDNA substrates described above for Fig. 6 were used, with 3 mm ATPγS and either 3 or 10 mm Mg(OAc)2 (Fig.7). At a magnesium ion concentration of 10 mm, joint molecules formed by wild-type RecA, using the different linear dsDNA ends, are virtually indistinguishable. However, at 3 mm Mg(OAc)2, appreciable amounts of joint molecule products can be seen only when 3′ or 5′ overhangs (not blunt ends) are utilized. The overall result is that a short single-stranded overhang is needed for reactions to be initiated with the wild-type protein in the absence of free magnesium ion. The reaction seen with 5′ overhangs is consistent with the absence of polarity in the initial (ATP hydrolysis-independent) pairing reactions promoted by RecA protein. Intermediates produced on the distal end of the linear duplex DNA (see Fig. 1) would be eliminated if ATP were hydrolyzed, as in Fig.6. In contrast, RecAΔC17 appears to not require any particular end at 3 mm magnesium, but it is unable to form joint molecules at 10 mm Mg(OAc)2. The absence of observable joint molecules in this reaction at the higher concentration of magnesium ion, although a more complete DNA strand exchange reaction (albeit somewhat suboptimal) is seen under these conditions, is taken up under “Discussion.” In an accompanying paper (23Lusetti S.L.

Here, we report a critical role for ERK at a late stage of T cell activation.

ERK inhibition significantly impaired nuclear translocation of c-Rel with a minimum reduction of NF-AT activity. Requirement for sustained ERK activation was also confirmed using primary T cells. To induce sustained activation of ERK, T cells required continuous engagement of TCR.

Lin J. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Antigenic stimulation induces Src family kinase-mediated phosphorylation of both tyrosines in immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs and creates a binding site for the cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 (2Wange R.L. Malek S.N. Desiderio S. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19797-19801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Iwashima M. Irving B.A. van Oers N.S. Chan A.C. Weiss A. Science. 1994; 263: 1136-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Following this recruitment, ZAP-70 is activated and initiates a downstream signaling cascade. Downstream of ZAP-70, the MAPK family of kinases has been shown to play critical roles in T cell activation and differentiation (reviewed in Refs. 1Kane L.P. Lin J. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar and 4Hogquist K.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Biological outcomes that have been reported to be controlled by ERK, a member of the MAPK family, include cytokine production, apoptosis, proliferation, positive and negative selection, and cytolysis. A major target of ERK has been postulated to be Elk1, which in turn up-regulates expression of c-Fos (5Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2324) Google Scholar). c-Fos, when dimerized with the Jun family of transcription factors, forms AP-1. A number of AP-1-binding sites have been identified in promoter regions for genes induced by TCR stimulation, such as IL-2 (6Jain J. Loh C. Rao A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). A function of AP-1 in IL-2 gene activation is to form a complex with another transcription factor, NF-AT (7Macian F. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Rao A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2476-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 8Macian F. Garcia-Rodriguez C. Rao A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4783-4795Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Formation of this complex has been shown to play critical roles in IL-2 gene activation. Recently, we identified a Jurkat T cell-derived mutant cell line (J.SL1) that has lost expression of the adaptor molecule Shc (9Iwashima M. Takamatsu M. Yamagishi H. Hatanaka Y. Huang Y.Y. McGinty C. Yamasaki S. Koike T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4544-4549Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In this cell line, TCR activation leads to impaired IL-2 production and ERK activation, whereas AP-1 and NF-AT activation is unaffected. Detailed analysis revealed that nuclear translocation of an NF-κB transcription factor, c-Rel, is severely reduced in this cell line, whereas RelA, another member of the NF-κB family, is activated normally. Loss of IL-2 promoter activity in J.SL1 cells could be rescued by activation of c-Rel using estrogen receptor fusion protein, indicating that loss of IL-2 production in J.SL1 cells is partly due to lack of c-Rel activation. Although studies using c-rel knockout mice showed that c-Rel is essential for IL-2 production (10Kontgen F. Grumont R.J. Strasser A. Metcalf D. Li R. Tarlinton D. Gerondakis S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1965-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 11Liou H.C. Jin Z. Tumang J. Andjelic S. Smith K.A. Liou M.L. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), it is not well understood how TCR triggers c-Rel activation. Other studies have shown that protein kinase Cθ is required for TCR-induced NF-κB activation (12Altman A. Isakov N. Baier G. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 567-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 13Sun Z. Arendt C.W. Ellmeier W. Schaeffer E.M. Sunshine M.J. Gandhi L. Annes J. Petrzilka D. Kupfer A.

Immunol. 2000; 165: 6933-6940Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This function of protein kinase Cθ appears to be required for activation of IκB kinase (15Lin X. O'Mahony A. Mu Y. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2933-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 16Coudronniere N. Villalba M. Englund N. Altman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3394-3399PubMed Google Scholar). The activation of protein kinase Cθ and IκB kinase takes place within minutes after engagement of TCR, and nuclear translocation of RelA is observed within 15 min after stimulation. In contrast, nuclear translocation of c-Rel takes place 3–4 h after stimulation and also requires de novo synthesis of protein (6Jain J. Loh C. Rao A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 17Venkataraman L. Burakoff S.J. Sen R. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1091-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 18Bryan R.G.

This suggests that TCR-induced c-Rel nuclear translocation requires a signaling pathway distinct from the one that activates RelA. Here, we report evidence that the ERK signaling pathway is essential for c-Rel nuclear translocation in the TCR signaling pathway. Most interestingly, ERK activity is required for c-Rel activation 2–6 h after the start of TCR stimulation. This late phase ERK activity is also required for IL-2 production. Jurkat cells (a gift from Dr. A. Weiss, University California, San Francisco, CA) and 2B4 and CHO cells (gifts from Dr. M. M. Davis, Stanford University, Stanford, CA) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% (for Jurkat cells) or 10% (for 2B4 and CHO cells) fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol (2B4 and primary T cells). The 2B4 cell line, which stably expresses c-Rel/estrogen receptor (ER) fusion protein (9Iwashima M. Takamatsu M. Yamagishi H. Hatanaka Y. Huang Y.Y. McGinty C. Yamasaki S. Koike T. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Primary T cells were purified from splenocytes of C57BL/6 mice (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) or TCR A1(M) transgenic mice (transgenic for the TCR of an I-Ek-restricted H-Y antigen-specific T cell clone) (20Zelenika D.

Selected Methods in Cellular Immunology. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1980: 227-234Google Scholar), respectively. Anti-Jurkat TCR antibody (C305, a kind gift from Dr. A. Weiss) was purified from mouse ascites using an Immunopure IgM purification kit (Pierce). Anti-c-Rel and anti-ERK polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-phospho-ERK polyclonal antibody was from Promega. Anti-p65 NF-κB (RelA; sc-8008) and anti-estrogen receptor (sc-543) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-CD69 and anti-CD154, biotinylated anti-CD3 (2C11), and phycoerythrin-labeled anti-CD25 monoclonal antibodies were from Pharmingen. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse and anti-rabbit polyclonal antibodies and the MEK inhibitor PD98059 were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). Actinomycin D and estrogen (β-estradiol) were from Sigma. PMA and ionomycin were from Calbiochem. Goat anti-mouse Ig polyclonal antibody was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. For stimulation with plate-bound anti-TCR antibody, tissue culture plates and polystyrene beads (Polyscience, Warrington, PA) were incubated with antibody C305 (0.35 μg/ml for Jurkat cells) or with antibody 2C11 (1 μg/ml) for 3 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. After removal of unbound antibody by washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cell suspensions (5 × 105cells/ml) were added. For stimulation with soluble antibody, Jurkat cells were incubated with antibody C305 at a final concentration of 0.35 μg/ml. 2B4 cells were cultured with biotinylated antibody 2C11 (1 μg/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C, followed by culture with streptavidin (0.5 μg/ml). Mouse splenic T cells were stimulated with plate-bound antibody 2C11 in the presence or absence of soluble anti-CD28 antibody (1 μg/ml). For stimulation with antigen peptide, CHO cells (2.5 × 104) were cultured with the agonist peptide (1 μm) (22Boniface J.J. Rabinowitz J.D. Wulfing C. Hampl J. Reich Z. Altman J.D. Kantor R.M.

For experiments with inhibitor treatment, cells were preincubated with inhibitors (30 min for PD98059 or 15 min for actinomycin D) or with Me2SO as a solvent control. During the time course analysis of inhibitor treatment, supernatants were replaced with medium containing an inhibitor or Me2SO at the indicated time points. IL-2 concentration in the supernatants was determined using a human or mouse IL-2 immunoassay kit from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). For flow cytometry analysis, cells were incubated with antibodies in Hanks' balanced saline solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% sodium azide (staining buffer). Intracellular staining was performed using phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-IL-2 antibody (Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer's directions. Samples were analyzed by FACScan (BD Biosciences). The NF-AT luciferase reporter was obtained from Dr. G. Crabtree (Stanford University) and used as previously described (23Yamasaki S. Takamatsu M. Iwashima M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was determined using the Dual-Luciferase assay kit (Promega) following the manufacturer's directions. The preparation of total cell lysates and nuclear extracts and the conditions of immunoblot analysis have been described previously (9Iwashima M. Takamatsu M. Yamagishi H. Hatanaka Y. Huang Y.Y. McGinty C. Yamasaki S. Koike T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4544-4549Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations of samples were measured using a BCA kit (Pierce) or Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent (Pierce), and the same amount of proteins for each sample was applied to the gel. Quantitative analysis of the bands was performed by densitometry (d-700, Bio-Rad) and with NIH Image. Jurkat cells were preincubated with either PD98059 at the concentrations indicated or Me2SO (1:2000 dilution as a solvent control) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells (1 × 107/ml) were then stimulated with soluble anti-TCR antibody (C305; 0.3 μg/ml) for 5 min at 37 °C and lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1.0% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1.0 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm EGTA, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Immunoprecipitation of ERK and kinase assay were performed following the protocol obtained from Pharmingen with minor modifications. In brief, the cell lysates were precleared with rabbit nonimmune IgG·protein G-Sepharose complex (Amersham Biosciences) for 15 min at 4 °C. Precleared cell lysate (0.5 mg/ml) was incubated with anti-ERK polyclonal antibody·protein G-Sepharose complex for 2 h at 4 °C and washed three times with lysis buffer, followed by two washes with kinase buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mmdithiothreitol). The precipitated immunocomplexes were incubated with 40 μl of kinase buffer containing 25 μm ATP, 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 40 μg of myelin basic protein (Sigma) for 15 min at 37 °C. The samples were then separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Because lack of Shc in Jurkat cells results in partial loss of ERK activation and significant impairment of c-Rel activation and IL-2 production, we hypothesized that a high level of ERK activity is required for c-Rel nuclear translocation and IL-2 production. To test this, we examined the effect of ERK inhibition on Jurkat cells stimulated with anti-TCR antibody in the presence of varying amounts of a MEK-specific inhibitor, PD98059. As shown in Fig.1 A, treatment of Jurkat cells with 25 μm PD98059 blocked IL-2 production by 80%, and 5 μm PD98059 still inhibited IL-2 production by 50%. In contrast, NF-AT-dependent transcriptional activity was less sensitive to PD98059 (Fig. 1 A). 25 μm PD98059 inhibited activity by ∼50% whereas 5 μm PD98059 had little effect, if any. To examine the effectiveness of treatment with PD98059, cell lysates were isolated from samples to which differing doses of PD98059 were added 30 min before the start of 5 min of TCR stimulation. As shown in Fig. 1 B, PD98059 blocked TCR-induced ERK activation in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, the lack of NF-AT inhibition with low concentrations of PD98059 treatment was not due to ineffective ERK inhibition. To examine whether other T cell responses are sensitive to inhibition of ERK, we tested the effect of PD98059 on activation-induced expression of the cell-surface antigens CD69, CD154 (CD40 ligand), and CD25 (IL-2 receptor α-chain). Jurkat cells were stimulated with anti-TCR antibody in the presence of PD98059 (25 μm), and the surface expression of these molecules was determined. The expression patterns of CD69, CD154, and CD25 were only slightly impaired even though 25 μm PD98059 had been shown to substantially inhibit IL-2 production (Fig. 1 C). Next, we determined whether low doses of the MEK inhibitor affect c-Rel activation. Cells were stimulated with anti-TCR antibody in the presence of 2 or 25 μm PD98059, and their nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-c-Rel antibody. As shown in Fig. 1 D, treatment of Jurkat cells with either 2 or 25 μm PD98059 reduced the amount of nuclear c-Rel in a dose-dependent manner (upper panel). No significant change was observed for cytoplasmic c-Rel (lower panel). In contrast, treatment with 5 μm PD98059 had very little effect on RelA nuclear localization as shown in Fig. 1 E. Even with 25 μm, reduction of nuclear localization was limited to 50% of untreated samples. It should be noted that RelA translocated to the nucleus much earlier than c-Rel (see 2-h samples) and that the RelA levels in the nucleus decreased after 4 h. These data suggest that c-Rel and RelA are under the control of two different signaling pathways and that ERK plays a more significant role in c-Rel activation. To test whether loss of c-Rel nuclear translocation was responsible for reduced IL-2 production following treatment with PD98059, we established T cell lines constitutively expressing a c-Rel/ER fusion protein. This fusion protein accumulated both in the cytoplasm and nucleus in the presence of estrogen as shown in Fig.2 A. This increase in cytoplasmic and nuclear c-Rel/ER was also observed in 2B4 mouse T cell hybridoma cells in an estrogen dose-dependent manner (Fig.2 B). When Jurkat T cells expressing c-Rel/ER were stimulated with anti-TCR antibody in the presence of 25 μm PD98059, IL-2 production was reduced by 50% compared with 70% for control Jurkat cells (Fig. 2 C). Treatment with estrogen alone showed almost no effect on IL-2 production in both Jurkat cells. This shows that nuclear accumulation of c-Rel is not sufficient for IL-2 production. When estrogen was added along with PD98059, c-Rel/ER-transfected Jurkat cells (but not parental Jurkat cells) showed a significant increase in IL-2 production over cells treated with only PD98059. We also established transfectants of the 2B4 mouse T cell hybridoma cells (specific for I-Ek plus moth cytochrome c) (22Boniface J.J. Rabinowitz J.D. Wulfing C. Hampl J. Reich Z. Altman J.D. Kantor R.M. Beeson C. McConnell H.M. Davis M.M. Immunity. 1998; 9: 459-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) expressing c-Rel/ER. Transfected cells were stimulated with antigen peptide presented by I-Ek-positive CHO cells. When 2B4 T cells were treated with PD98059, antigen-induced IL-2 production was almost abrogated (Fig. 2 D). However, when estrogen was added to the culture along with PD98059, c-Rel/ER transductants (but not parental 2B4 cells) showed significant levels of IL-2 production, as observed with control Jurkat cells. No IL-2 production was observed with estrogen treatment alone (data not shown). The data suggest that the reduced IL-2 production caused by inhibition of ERK is partially due to the loss of c-Rel nuclear translocation. Because nuclear localization of c-Rel is a slow event (peaks at 4 h after the start of TCR stimulation), we examined which time point of ERK activity is most important for c-Rel activation and IL-2 production. We first determined the critical time point of ERK activation in IL-2 production. Jurkat cells were stimulated with plate-bound anti-TCR antibody, and the level of IL-2 production was determined in untreated and PD98059-treated samples. When PD98059 was added at the beginning of stimulation (with a pretreatment for 30 min) and removed 2 or 4 h later, IL-2 production was not reduced (Fig.3 A). However, when PD98059 was present for 6 h, a significant reduction was observed. To our surprise, when the inhibitor was added 2 h after the start of stimulation and present for up to 6 h, IL-2 production was almost eliminated. Addition of the inhibitor even 4 h after the start of stimulation caused a significant reduction in IL-2 production. NF-AT activity was affected much less (maximum 30% reduction) by PD98059. IL-2 production by antigen peptide-stimulated 2B4 cells showed similar kinetic characteristics compared with Jurkat cells (Fig.3 B), although the amounts of IL-2 produced were much higher. The requirement for sustained ERK activation was also tested with primary T cells. Purified CD4+-enriched mouse splenic T cells (from TCR A1(M) transgenic mouse, >90% CD4+) (data not shown) were stimulated with anti-CD3 antibody for 24 h (Fig.3 C). PD98059 was added to the culture at various time points. As shown, addition of PD98059 12 h after the start of stimulation still blocked IL-2 production as effectively as addition at the start of culture. To examine whether the effect of PD treatment was at the level of synthesis or secretion, we next tested the level of IL-2 production by intracellular staining (Fig. 3 D). A1(M) splenic T cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies and showed clear expression of intracellular IL-2 (left panel). Addition of PD98059 for the last 6 h of culture resulted in IL-2 production similar to the levels generated by unstimulated samples. Culture supernatants from cells treated in this manner did not contain IL-2 when examined by ELISA (data not shown). Thus, PD98059 blocks the synthesis and not the secretion of IL-2. As observed with Jurkat cells, CD25 and CD69 expression was at comparable levels in untreated and PD98059-treated samples (data not shown). Next, we examined the effect of the same treatment on nuclear localization of c-Rel (Fig.4 A). Treatment of TCR-activated Jurkat cells with PD98059 for the first 2 h (with 30 min of pretreatment) had only a minor effect on c-Rel nuclear localization. However, when the inhibitor was present for 4 h, nuclear localization of c-Rel was significantly reduced. Inhibition of ERK 2 or 4 h after the start of stimulation was equally effective. It was previously reported that de novo synthesis of protein is required for nuclear translocation of c-Rel (17Venkataraman L. Burakoff S.J. Sen R. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1091-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The ERK requirement in the late phase of activation raised the question of whether ERK is required for de novo protein synthesis. To test this, we examined whether the kinetics of de novoprotein synthesis required for c-Rel activation are the same as those of ERK. RelA was also analyzed in this experiment to examine whether the ERK requirement is specific for c-Rel. Jurkat cells were treated with actinomycin D to inhibit mRNA/protein synthesis at different points of activation, and nuclear localization of c-Rel was measured by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 4 B, actinomycin D treatment of Jurkat cells inhibited c-Rel nuclear translocation very effectively when it was added to the culture for the first 2 h. Treatment between the 4- and 6-h time points of stimulation also showed a significant inhibitory effect. This pattern differs from that of PD98059 inhibition and indicates that protein synthesis required for c-Rel activation at an early stage (0–2 h) is ERK-independent. In contrast, inhibition of ERK showed very little effect on nuclear localization of RelA (Fig. 4 B). Moreover, RelA nuclear translocation was only mildly affected by 6 h of actinomycin D treatment and even increased with limited treatment between 4 and 6 h. This increase may reflect the loss of IκB expression, which plays a critical inhibitory role in nuclear localization of RelA. To confirm the effect of ERK inhibition, the levels of phospho-ERK were compared among samples treated with PD98059 at different time points. As shown in Fig. 4 (C and D), when the level of phospho-ERK in cells stimulated with anti-TCR antibody was taken as 100%, treatment with PD98059 for the first 2 h caused a slight increase in ERK phosphorylation. This is likely due to inhibition of ERK phosphatase induction (24Whitehurst C.E. Geppert T.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1020-1029PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, treatment of cells 0–6 or 2–6 h after stimulation resulted in effective inhibition of ERK activity at the 6-h time point. It has been well documented that stimulation with antibody against TCR in soluble forms does not induce lymphokine production even though early biochemical events appear to represent what occurs with full T cell activation (25Meuer S.C. Hodgdon J.C. Hussey R.E. Protentis J.P. Schlossman S.F. Reinherz E.L. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 158: 988-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 26Meuer S.C. Meyer zum Buschenfelde K.H. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 4106-4112PubMed Google Scholar). Because we found that sustained activation of ERK is essential for IL-2 production, we tested whether soluble anti-TCR antibody induces sustained ERK activation. Jurkat T cells were stimulated with either soluble or plate-bound anti-TCR antibody. When we compared the state of the activated form of ERK, soluble anti-TCR antibody induced robust activation of ERK (Fig. 5 A,left panels). This activation lasted for 30 min, but quickly declined thereafter. In contrast, plate-bound antibody stimulation induced ERK activation slowly (peaked at 30 min), but the level of activation was sustained and remained high even 6 h after the start of stimulation. A similar pattern was observed for activation of MEK (right panels). NF-AT activity induced by soluble antibody was ∼30% of that induced by plate-bound antibody. 2T. Koike and M. Iwashima, unpublished data. To test whether activation of ERK could be the missing element required for IL-2 production induced by soluble antibody treatment, we used a pharmacological agent to stimulate ERK in a TCR-independent manner. PMA induces strong activation of Ras and downstream molecules, including ERK, in T cells (27Izquierdo M. Leevers S.J. Williams D.H. Marshall C.J. Weiss A. Cantrell D. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 2462-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 28Downward J. Graves J.D. Warne P.H. Rayter S. Cantrell D.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). When ERK was activated by addition of PMA to the culture medium, soluble anti-TCR antibody induced a significant amount of IL-2 (Fig. 5 B). Stimulation by ionomycin together with soluble anti-TCR antibody had no significant effect on IL-2 production. Treatment of Jurkat cells with PMA also induced rapid c-Rel and RelA nuclear translocation (Fig. 5 C). Interestingly, soluble antibody alone induced an early (30 min), but not late (6 h), increase in nuclear RelA. Using this function of PMA, we determined the time period when PMA treatment is required for IL-2 production. Jurkat cells were stimulated with soluble anti-TCR antibody. PMA was added to the culture at the start of stimulation and was removed at four different time points. As shown in Fig. 5 D, when PMA was removed as late as 4 h after stimulation, the effect of PMA on IL-2 production was not observed. However, if PMA was present in the culture for 6 h or longer, soluble anti-TCR antibody stimulation induced IL-2 production at a level comparable to that of plate-bound antibody. Next, Jurkat cells were first stimulated with soluble anti-TCR antibody, and then PMA was added later to the culture to test how long PMA stimulation can be delayed for the induction of IL-2. As shown in Fig. 5 E, we observed no reduction of IL-2 production by soluble anti-TCR antibody when PMA was added as late as 4 h after the start of stimulation. When PMA was added 6 h after TCR stimulation, a slight decrease in IL-2 production was observed. All these results indicate that activation of ERK at late time points (4–6 h) is essential for the production of IL-2. To confirm that the function of PMA involves activation of ERK, we added PD98059 to the cells that were stimulated with soluble anti-TCR antibody and PMA. As shown in Fig. 5 F, addition of PD98059 (25 μm) abrogated IL-2 production that could be induced by soluble anti-TCR antibody plus PMA treatment. This strongly suggests that ERK activation is an essential requirement for IL-2 production induced by PMA stimulation in this system. The data presented here demonstrate that TCR-induced activation of ERK must be sustained for the production of IL-2. Most strikingly, treatment of both human and mouse T cells with an ERK inhibitor was not effective in blocking subsequent IL-2 production during the initial phase of TCR-induced activation, but rather exerted its effect in a late phase (2–6 h). The loss of c-Rel translocation is, in part, responsible for the loss of IL-2 production because activation of c-Rel/ER partially counteracts the reduction in IL-2 production caused by ERK inhibition. This result indicates that there is a novel signaling pathway that connects ERK and c-Rel at a late time point in T cell stimulation. As an NF-κB family member, c-Rel is regulated by the IκB family of proteins, and their regulation is controlled by the IκB kinase family of kinases (29Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4631) Google Scholar). Although MEKK1 (JNK kinase) has been shown to activate IκB kinase, no involvement of MEK or ERK has been detected (30Baumann B. Weber C.K. Troppmair J. Whiteside S. Israel A. Rapp U.R. Wirth T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4615-4620Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Our data show that RelA is much less sensitive to inhibition by MEK inhibitors, indicating that the MEK/ERK pathway is specifically involved in the regulation of c-Rel. The possibility of a c-Rel-specific regulatory mechanism is also supported by the fact that it takes 2–4 h for TCR stimulation to induce nuclear translocation of c-Rel, whereas RelA translocates into the nucleus within 15 min after stimulation. A model regarding how ERK controls c-Rel nuclear translocation is that ERK is involved in de novo synthesis of c-Rel. This model is based on previous findings showing that de novo synthesized c-Rel translocates to the nucleus after TCR stimulation (31Venkataraman L. Wang W. Sen R. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1149-1155PubMed Google Scholar). However, the period when ERK is most required for IL-2 production and c-Rel activation does not coincide with the time when de novoRNA/protein synthesis is required. This raises another possibility that ERK is required for regulation of newly synthesized molecules that are involved in c-Rel activation. The target may be newly synthesized c-Rel itself or its regulator. Indeed, c-Rel phosphorylation in Jurkat cells has been reported recently (32Martin A.G. San-Antonio B. Fresno M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15840-15849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These two possibilities are not mutually exclusive, and ERK may be required for both the synthesis and phosphorylation of activating molecules. Recently, a number of studies reported that sustained TCR engagement is required for T cell activation (reviewed in Ref. 33Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1717-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Formation of the supramolecular activation clusters (SMAC)/immunological synapse could provide the source of continued receptor engagement. Such sustained receptor engagement could enable the prolonged ERK activation that is required for T cell activation as presented here. In this sense, ERK could play a role in determining the threshold for fullversus partial activation. Lack of sustained TCR engagement may attenuate activation of ERK at the late stage and thus inhibit IL-2 production. It is not yet clear how ERK activation can be sustained for several hours after the start of stimulation. There are at least two pathways known that can activate Ras and the MEK/ERK pathway: the SOS-dependent pathway and the RasGRP pathway (34Ebinu J.O. Stang S.L. Teixeira C. Bottorff D.A. Hooton J. Blumberg P.M. Barry M. Bleakley R.C. Ostergaard H.L. Stone J.C. Blood. 2000; 95: 3199-3203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,35Roose J. Weiss A. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 275-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Recent analysis using LAT mutants showed that it is a phospholipase Cγ-1-binding site of LAT that mainly regulates ERK activation in T cells (36Lin J. Weiss A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29588-29595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 37Zhang W. Trible R.P. Zhu M. Liu S.K. McGlade C.J. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23355-23361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). This suggests that RasGRP may play a major role in Ras activation after TCR engagement downstream of LAT. Recently, we found that Ras is activated weakly but in a sustained manner in the absence of LAT. 3A. Fukushima, Y. Hatanaka, J.-w. Chang, M. Takamatsu, N. Singh, and M. Iwashima, manuscript in preparation. Shc is clearly tyrosine-phosphorylated in the absence of LAT and appears to play a critical role in this pathway. Because Shc has been implicated in the SOS activation pathway in many receptor systems (38Bonfini L. Migliaccio E. Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 257-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), it is likely that SOS-dependent Ras activation can be carried out via Shc. Our recent study also showed that loss of Shc causes loss of c-Rel activation and IL-2 production in Jurkat cells (9Iwashima M. Takamatsu M. Yamagishi H. Hatanaka Y. Huang Y.Y. McGinty C. Yamasaki S. Koike T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4544-4549Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Together, the data imply that TCR utilizes two pathways to activate Ras via LAT/phospholipase Cγ-1/RasGRP and Shc/Grb2/SOS and these two Ras activation pathways may play essential roles in enabling early and sustained activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway. An alternative possibility for how ERK is activated at a later time point is by the contribution of secreted lymphokines such as macrophage migration inhibitory factor (39Mitchell R.A. Metz C.N. Peng T. Bucala R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18100-18106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 40Bacher M. Metz C.N. Calandra T. Mayer K. Chesney J. Lohoff M. Gemsa D. Donnelly T. Bucala R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7849-7854Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). It has been shown that macrophage migration inhibitory factor can activate ERK in a sustained manner and plays a role in IL-2 production. Because secretion of macrophage migration inhibitory factor occurs in a relatively early phase of stimulation, it is possible that this lymphokine provides sustained activation of ERK. In summary, the data presented here show a novel function for ERK in TCR signaling. Activation of ERK is essential for nuclear translocation of c-Rel, and this role for ERK occurs during a late period of T cell stimulation. The data also suggest the possibility that ERK activation may contribute to determining the threshold between sustained agonistic stimulation and temporary partial agonist stimulation. We thank Drs.

https://openalex.org/W2155857030,"Active galaxies are characterized by prominent emission from their nuclei. In the ‘unified’ view of active galaxies, the accretion of material onto a massive compact object—now generally believed to be a black hole—provides the fundamental power source1. Obscuring material along the line of sight can account for the observed differences in the nuclear emission2,3, which determine the classification of AGN (for example, as Seyfert 1 or Seyfert 2 galaxies). Although the physical processes of accretion have been confirmed observationally4,5, the structure and extent of the obscuring material have not been determined. Here we report observations of powerful hydroxyl (OH) line emissions that trace this obscuring material within the circumnuclear environment of the galaxy Markarian 231. The hydroxyl (mega)-maser emission shows the characteristics of a rotating, dusty, molecular torus (or thick disk) located between 30 and 100 pc from the central engine. We now have a clear view of the physical conditions, the kinematics and the spatial structure of this material on intermediate size scales, confirming the main tenets of unification models."

Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 176: 143-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 2Temin H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6900-6903Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Recombination constitutes the most frequent genomic aberration in retroviruses; its frequency of occurrence is equal to the cumulative frequency of all the other types of mutations (3Negroni M. Buc H. Campbell A. Annual Review of Genetics. 35. Annual Reviews, Palo Alto, CA2001: 275-302Google Scholar). The most intensively studied member of this group of viruses, the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1),1 illustrates the impact of recombination on the dynamics of retroviral evolution. In this case, at the very least 10% of the circulating strains have been generated by genetic recombination among different HIV-1 subtypes (4Sharp P.M. Bailes E. Robertson D.L. Gao F. Hahn B.H. Biol. Bull. 1999; 196: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In retroviruses, recombination occurs mainly during reverse transcription (5Hu W.S. Temin H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1556-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Each viral particle contains two copies of single-stranded positive genomic RNA (6Vogt V.M. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar). If two different variants of a virus infect the same cell, as recently documented for HIV-1 (7Jung A. Maier R. Vartanian J.P. Bocharov G. Jung V. Fischer U. Meese E. Wain-Hobson S. Meyerhans A. Nature. 2002; 418: 144Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), the viral progeny will be constituted by homozygous and heterozygous virions. Recombination can then occur when a heterozygous virus infects a new cell. Indeed, during synthesis of the (−) DNA strand the reverse transcriptase (RT) can switch template and, guided by the local sequence homology, transfer DNA synthesis from one genomic RNA molecule (the donor) onto the other (acceptor RNA). In a heterozygous virion this process, known as copy choice, leads to genetic recombination (8Vogt P.K. Silvestri L. Possible Episomes in Eukaryotes. North Holland, 1973: 35-41Google Scholar). Despite the dramatic impact of recombination on the evolution of retroviruses, the underlying mechanisms are not yet understood. Based on the observation that the purification of viral RNA from retroviral particles led to the isolation of fragmented molecules, it was suggested that the genomic RNA is not intact within the viral particle. It was therefore proposed that the switch would be a consequence of a block of reverse transcription caused by a break on the RNA, a model called “forced copy choice” (9Coffin J.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1979; 42: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In this case the stalling of the RT would constitute the crucial step of the process by allowing an extensive degradation of the RNA template by the RNase H activity carried by the RT itself, as demonstrated for (−)DNA strong stop strand transfer (10Telesnitsky A. Goff S.P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4433-4438Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The resulting single-stranded DNA would then be available for annealing onto the complementary sequence provided by the acceptor RNA. A similar situation can be encountered if stalling is generated by strong pause occurring during reverse transcription of an intact template. Indeed, a prominent pause site detected duringin vitro reverse transcription of a stretch of the HIV-1nef gene was shown to increase significantly the local frequency of strand transfer (11DeStefano J.J. Mallaber L.M. Rodriguez-Rodriguez L. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6370-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Wu W. Blumberg B.M. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 325-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In these instances the stalling of reverse transcription is regarded as the limiting step for strand transfer. This idea has, however, recently been challenged by increasing evidence demonstrating that pausing during reverse transcription and strand transfer are not necessarily coupled (13Kim J.K. Palaniappan C. Wu W. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16769-16777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 14Negroni M. Buc H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 46900-46911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In parallel, studies carried out on RNA templates containing hairpin regions have suggested that such structures could favor template switching by RTs (13Kim J.K. Palaniappan C. Wu W. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16769-16777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 16Berkhout B. Vastenhouw N.L. Klasens B.I. Huthoff H.

Chem. 2001; 276: 36482-36492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In these cases it was proposed that the hairpin structures enhance the probability of strand transfer by mediating an interaction between donor and acceptor RNA that increases their spatial proximity (13Kim J.K. Palaniappan C. Wu W. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16769-16777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 16Berkhout B. Vastenhouw N.L. Klasens B.I.

Chem. 2001; 276: 36482-36492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Extensive random searches for the occurrence of recombination hot spots during in vitro reverse transcription by HIV-1 RT had revealed the correlation between the location of these hot spots and the presence of predicted hairpin regions in the RNA template (14Negroni M. Buc H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6385-6390Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 18Moumen A. Polomack L. Roques B. Buc H. Negroni M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3814-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Based on this observation, it was proposed that template switching proceeds through a two-step mechanism: docking of the acceptor RNA onto the nascent DNA and displacement of the donor RNA by the acceptor RNA (14Negroni M. Buc H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6385-6390Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The latter step would be guided by the folding of the RNA. A recent study on the primer binding site of the equine infectious anemia virus has shown that the hairpin present in that region induces a strong pause of reverse transcription that increases the efficiency of the docking step (15Roda R.H. Balakrishnan M. Kim J.K. Roques B.P. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46900-46911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In addition, in vitro studies on the effect on strand transfer of the nucleocapsid protein (NC), a major co-factor of the reverse transcription complex (19Welker R. Hohenberg H. Tessmer U. Huckhagel C. Krausslich H.G. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1168-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), have suggested a mechanism of recombination governed by the structures of the RNA rather than by pausing of reverse transcription (reviewed in Refs. 3Negroni M. Buc H. Campbell A. Annual Review of Genetics. 35. Annual Reviews, Palo Alto, CA2001: 275-302Google Scholar and 20Negroni M. Buc H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Indeed, although NC enhances strand transfer in vitro (reviewed in Ref. 3Negroni M. Buc H. Campbell A. Annual Review of Genetics. 35. Annual Reviews, Palo Alto, CA2001: 275-302Google Scholar) it does not lead to a parallel increase of pausing during reverse transcription, as predicted for a mechanism of template switching governed by pausing of DNA synthesis (14Negroni M. Buc H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6385-6390Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Because the NC is a RNA chaperone (21Clodi E. Semrad K. Schroeder R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3776-3782Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 22Williams M.C. Rouzina I. Wenner J.R. Gorelick R.J. Musier-Forsyth K. Bloomfield V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6121-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), it was suggested that the enhancement of strand transfer observed in its presence was because of its ability to modulate the structures of the RNA templates (14Negroni M. Buc H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6385-6390Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Among the several recombinant HIV-1 strains isolated to date, a well defined case is constituted by chimerical genomes between subgroups A and either C or D, generated by recombination on the region coding for the constant portion C2 of the envelope glycoprotein gp120 (23Robertson D.L. Sharp P.M. McCutchan F.E. Hahn B.H. Nature. 1995; 374: 124-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Recombination on this segment of genome allows reshuffling of the portions of gp120 coding for the variable regions V1 and V2, relative to regions V3 through V5. The spatial arrangement of regions V2 and V3 with respect to the constant regions of the protein has been shown to be critical for allowing the virus to escape neutralizing antibodies raised by the immune system of the host (24Ye Y. Si Z.H. Moore J.P. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11955-11962Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In a previous report we used several RNA sequences issued from the HIV-1 genome to investigate the mechanism of template switching by HIV-1 reverse transcriptasein vitro. We observed that the genomic sequence coding for the C2 region constituted, indeed, the most important hot spot we found during that work (18Moumen A. Polomack L. Roques B. Buc H. Negroni M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3814-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a subsequent study on recombination during infection of cells in culture with different HIV-1 subtypes has also shown the occurrence of frequent recombination in the same region (25Quinones-Mateu M.E. Gao Y. Ball S.C. Marozsan A.J. Abraha A. Arts E.J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9600-9613Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In our previous study, the portion of 200 nt that constituted the hot spot within the C2 domain was called “Eb” and was initially included in a model template where it was surrounded by the sequences that flank it on the viral genome (Fig. 1 A,RNA E2). It was subsequently observed that by changing the surrounding sequences (Fig. 1, RNA G1Eb) the frequency of strand transfer on Eb was decreased by a 4- to 5-fold factor (18Moumen A. Polomack L. Roques B. Buc H. Negroni M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3814-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We referred to this effect as “context effect.” In this work, we took advantage of the context effect to investigate the role of the RNA structure in the transfer process and to address the question of the mechanism responsible for copy choice by HIV-1 RT. To determine their folding, the various RNA templates were labeled at their 3′-end as follows. A 21-mer oligonucleotide with a sequence complementary to the 3′-end of the RNA to label was annealed, at a molar ratio of 4:1 (oligo:RNA) and in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, by heating the mixture for 30 s at 95 °C followed by a slow cooling to 30 °C. The oligonucleotide carries at its 5′-end a non-hybridizing tail of six nucleotides constituted by the sequence 5′-CTTTTT-3′. The annealed RNA was then incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in a final volume of 55 μl in a buffer containing 7 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NaCl, 40 units of RNasin (Promega), 5 units of Sequenase (United States Biochemicals), and 0.05 mCi of [α32P]dideoxyATP (Amersham Biosciences). Labeled RNAs were purified on 7% polyacrylamide gel and eluted by passive diffusion at 4 °C in a buffer containing 10 mm magnesium acetate, 500 mm ammonium acetate, 0.1% SDS, and 1 mm EDTA. The eluted RNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipitated in ethanol; the dried pellet was conserved under ethanol at −20 °C. For determination of the structure of the RNA, 8 pmol of the labeled RNA were heated in the reverse transcription buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 75 mm KCl, 7 mm MgCl2) at 65 °C for 5 min, slowly cooled to 40 °C, and transferred on ice. The RNA was then treated with either T1 (0.3 and 0.15 units) or T2 (0.04 and 0.02 units) RNases for 5 min at 37 °C. T1 and T2 RNases cleave single-stranded RNA molecules with preference for guanine residues for T1 and adenine residues for T2 (26Ehresmann C. Baudin F. Mougel M. Romby P. Ebel J.P. Ehresmann B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 9109-9128Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by phenol-chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. The products were analyzed by autoradiography after electrophoresis on 7% polyacrylamide gels (see Fig. 1). Quantification was performed using phosphorimaging apparatus (Molecular Dynamics). The positions of enzymatic cleavage were identified by reference to a ladder generated by extensive T1 digestion of the same RNA molecule. The residues identified as single-stranded in four independent experiments were introduced as constraints in the structure prediction analysis by the m-fold program (27Zuker M. Science. 1989; 244: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). The various constructs used for RNA synthesis were generated following standard cloning procedures (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Each construct was systematically sequenced before its use in RNA synthesis. RNA synthesis was performed as previously described (29Negroni M. Ricchetti M. Nouvel P. Buc H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6971-6975Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription of the donor RNA was carried out in the presence of the acceptor RNA (at a final concentration of 100 nm each, unless otherwise stated) after annealing an oligonucleotide specifically onto the donor template (Fig. 2 A). Annealing was performed at a molar ratio of primer to donor RNA of 10:1 in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 75 mm KCl, 7 mm MgCl2 at 65 °C for 5 min followed by a slow cooling to 40 °C. Dithiothreitol (1 mm final concentration), the four dNTPs (1 mm each), and RNasin (100 units; Promega) were added after incubation for 5 min on ice. For the experiments with NC (55 amino acids, synthesized as described in Ref. 30De Rocquigny H. Gabus C. Vincent A. Fournie-Zaluski M.C. Roques B. Darlix J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6472-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), the protein was added at this step at a ratio of 1 molecule of NC/8 nt of total RNA and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Reverse transcription was started by the addition of HIV-1 RT at a final concentration of 400 nmand carried out for 90 min. The reaction was stopped by extraction with phenol-chloroform. The samples containing NC were treated, before phenol-chloroform extraction, for 1 h at 56 °C with proteinase K (8 mg/ml), 0.4% (w/v) SDS, and 50 mm EDTA (pH 8.0). The phenol-chloroform-extracted samples were then submitted to RNase treatment. Purification of the reverse transcription product and synthesis of the second DNA strand were performed as previously described (14Negroni M. Buc H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6385-6390Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). BamHI and PstI digestion, ligation, and Escherichia coli transformation were also carried out as previously described (18Moumen A. Polomack L. Roques B. Buc H. Negroni M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3814-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and as shown in Fig. 2. For the experiments where the concentration of acceptor template was varied, the procedure of reverse transcription of a fixed amount (100 nm) of donor RNA was identical to the one described above, but the concentration of acceptor included in the assay was varied as detailed in Fig. 5. In all cases HIV-1 RT was used at a concentration of 400 nm.Figure 5Effect of the concentration of the acceptor RNA on copy choice and forced copy choice. A, copy choice; B, forced copy choice. Only the viral portion (“vir” in Fig. 2) of the model templates used in these assays is shown in each panel. A detailed description of these templates is given in Ref. 18Moumen A. Polomack L.

The recombination rates refer to recombination occurring on the regions shown in gray on the donor RNAs (the size of which is given in the table). Error bars were calculated as (b 1/2/b), where b is the number of blue colonies, and r is the recombination rate. The standard sample is the one indicated in Fig. 2 for the forced copy choice conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The recombination frequency in the various intervals of the model templates was calculated as follows. In the case of recombination between dE2 and aE2 RNAs, as an example, a NcoI restriction site was present at the boundary between Ea and Eb on the donor RNA, and anApaLI site marked the transition between Eb and Ec on the acceptor RNA (Fig. 3 A, column I). All recombinant molecules NcoI+/ApaLI+were considered to issue from template switching within Eb. We defineF as the overall frequency of recombination observed in the experiment, as given in Fig. 2, left panel. If bis the number of blue colonies whose restriction pattern has been analyzed and c is the number of recombinant coloniesNcoI+/ApaLI+, the frequency of recombination within Eb (f) is given byF(c/b). Recombination rates per nt were calculated by dividing the frequency of recombination within a given region by its size in nt (in the example given here, Eb is 200 nt long, and the recombination rate is therefore given by f/200). Reverse transcription was primed using a 5′-terminal-labeled deoxyoligonucleotide and carried out under the same buffer and RT conditions as above. The templates used in these assays consisted in truncated versions of dG1Eb or dE2, devoid of the sequences coding for the reporter gene and therefore including only the viral sequences. Similarly when the experiments were performed in the presence of the acceptor RNAs, modified versions of aG1Eb and of aE2 RNAs were used, constituted only by the viral sequence. The complex between HIV-1 RT and the primer/template was pre-formed by incubation for 10 min in the same reaction buffer as described above, devoid of dNTPs and MgCl2. The reaction was started by the addition of dNTPs and MgCl2 and stopped at various time intervals by addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 15 mm. All samples were ethanol-precipitated before electrophoresis on 8% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea in a loading buffer containing formamide at a final concentration of 22.5%. The intensity of each band was estimated by phosphorimaging as described above. To study the potential correlation between the frequency of recombination on the Eb region and its structure, we determined its folding in solution when it is included either in E2 RNA (condition under which Eb is a recombination hot spot) or in G1Eb RNA (where Eb was not a recombination hot spot). In these two cases we call this region Eb* and Eb°, respectively. The determination of the folding of the RNAs was performed under the same buffer and temperature conditions as the recombination assay (see “Materials and Methods”). These two RNAs were labeled at their 3′-end, subjected to enzymatic probing (Fig.1, panels B and C), and their secondary structures were assessed by including the constraints revealed by these probing assays into the m-fold program (27Zuker M. Science. 1989; 244: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). The most significant difference found between the folding of Eb* and Eb° was in the 3′-terminal region of the sequences. In this part, we identified a stem-loop motif, called here SL (Fig. 1 D), present exclusively in the case of Eb*. As shown in Fig. 1, the SL hairpin is constituted at its 3′-end by a portion of the region Ea, the sequence downstream Eb* in E2 RNA. When Eb is part of G1Eb RNA (Eb°), Ea is replaced by the region G1a and the formation of the SL hairpin is no longer possible (Fig. 1, panels B and C,bottom). No other stable hairpins were found within Eb°. The influence of these structural differences in the strand transfer reaction was then investigated by using a recombination assay previously described (18Moumen A. Polomack L. Roques B. Buc H. Negroni M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3814-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and outlined in Fig. 2, left panel. Strand transfer involves two types of RNA templates, the donor and the acceptor. The correlation between the folding of the Eb region and the frequency of strand transfer observed during its reverse transcription was exploited to assess the role played by each of these templates. The experiments were first performed on naked RNA templates. The rationale of the experiment is outlined in Fig.3 A. In the two cases outlined in Fig. 3 A, columns I and IV, the donor and the acceptor RNAs share complete sequence homology on the viral sequence, apart from the presence of the restriction sites indicated in the figure. We refer to these conditions as “symmetric,” because the folding of the region Eb is the same on the donor and the acceptor RNAs (either Eb* on both or Eb° on both). In contrast, under the conditions depicted in columns II and III (“asymmetric conditions”) Eb adopts a different folding between the donor and the acceptor RNAs. Furthermore, under the asymmetric conditions the region Eb constitutes the only region of homology between the two RNAs (in black in the figure). The frequency of template switching within Eb was determined by restriction analysis of the recombinant products, as detailed under “Materials and Methods.” When Eb was in the Eb* conformation on the acceptor RNA, strikingly close frequencies of recombination were observed on the Eb interval, independent of which donor RNA was used (Fig. 3 A,columns I and II, naked RNAs). Conversely, the frequency of strand transfer on Eb was similar when it was in the Eb° conformation on the acceptor RNA, independent from the use of dE2 or of dG1Eb as donor RNA (Fig. 3 A, columns III and IV). Therefore, it was evident that the conformation of Eb on the acceptor RNA determined the frequency of template switching. We then tested whether these conclusions reached on experiments on naked RNAs could apply to recombination occurring in the presence of the NC protein. Also, in this case the frequency of recombination on Eb was found to depend on the folding of the acceptor RNA (Fig. 3 A, RNA· NC complex). To document the role of the SL hairpin in recombination taking place within Eb, we decided to distinguish between the events of strand transfer occurring within SL itself from those taking place outside the hairpin in the Eb interval. We employed aE2 as the acceptor RNA and either dE2 or dG1Eb as donor templates, the conditions under which the highest frequency of transfer was observed on Eb (Fig. 3 A, columns I andII). For these experiments, a point mutation generating anEcoRI site was introduced on both types of donor RNAs, dE2 and dG1Eb, creating dE2-eco and dG1Eb-eco RNAs, respectively (Fig.3 B). This EcoRI site is located immediately 5′ with respect to the base of the SL hairpin and allows mapping of strand transfer within Eb. As shown in Fig. 3 B (naked RNA), the use of either dE2-eco or dG1Eb-eco as donor RNAs yielded a recombination rate higher within the hairpin itself than in the downstream portion. Furthermore the rates of recombination were very close when dE2-eco or dG1Eb-eco was used (15.1 and 14.0 × 10−4 per nt), confirming that the type of donor RNA used does not influence the distribution of the positions of strand transfer within Eb. We then evaluated whether the same conclusions can be drawn from experiments performed in the presence of the NC protein by performing the recombination assays on RNA·NC complexes. Also, in this case strand transfer occurred at high rates on SL, regardless of the type of donor template employed. The observation that the type of donor RNA used does not modify the frequency of template switching strongly suggests that pausing of reverse transcription on the donor RNA is not the trigger for strand transfer. It cannot be ruled out, though, that the pausing pattern on the donor templates is modified when reverse transcription is performed in the presence of aG1Eb or aE2 as acceptor templates. To investigate this point we first carried out a labeled primer extension analysis on dG1Eb and dE2 RNAs (Fig.4 A, lanes 1–4, and B, lanes 1–5). Despite the different folding of the SL region on these RNAs, a prominent pause site was found in both cases at the same position, corresponding to a stretch of four uridine residues. To check whether the presence of an acceptor RNA could induce a change in the pausing pattern on the donor template, reverse transcription of dG1Eb (Fig. 4 A) or of dE2 (Fig. 4 B) was then performed in the presence of either aG1Eb or aE2. As indicated at the bottom of Fig. 4, these conditions reproduce those employed for the recombination assays depicted in Fig.3 A. In no case could a significant change in the pausing pattern be detected. The 4- to 5-fold difference in the frequency of recombination observed, depending on the use of E2 or G1Eb as acceptor RNA (Fig. 3 A), was therefore not associated with an increased stalling of the reverse transcription. To better evaluate the effect of strong arrests of DNA synthesis on template switching, we have developed an experimental system that reproduces the situation described in the forced copy choice model (Fig. 2, right panel). In this system reverse transcription was performed in parallel under two different experimental conditions, referred to in Fig. 2 as “strand transfer” and “standard” samples. In the strand transfer sample, a donor template (“FCC donor RNA,” for forced copy choice) is reverse-transcribed in the presence of an acceptor RNA. The FCC donor RNA is truncated within the region of homology with the acceptor RNA. This system allows strand transfer to occur either from internal positions of the region of homology or at the very 5′-end of the donor template. The reverse transcription products are then treated as for the copy choice experiments and cloned in E. coli (see the Fig. 2 legend and “Materials and Methods"

To study the signaling function of non-junctional VE-cadherin, which can form during the loss VE-cadherin homotypic adhesion, wild type VE-cadherin or VE-cadherin cytoplasmic domain (ΔEXD) was expressed in sub-confluent endothelial cells. We observed that Cdc42 was activated in transfected cells and that these cells also developed Cdc42-dependent >70-μm-long plasma membrane protrusions. The formation of these structures required actin polymerization, and they developed specifically in endothelial cells as compared with epithelial cells. Expression of the VE-cadherin cytoplasmic domain lacking the β-catenin binding site also induced Cdc42 activation; thus, its activation cannot be ascribed to β-catenin binding. However, these cells were not able to form the protrusions. These results suggest that the cytoplasmic domain of non-junctional VE-cadherin can serve as a scaffold involved in Cdc42 activation at the endothelial plasma membrane. β-Catenin and the associated α-catenin may serve as support sites for actin polymerization, leading to formation of long plasma membrane protrusions.

Direct involvement of VE-cadherin to endothelial barrier function was demonstrated by VE-cadherin blocking antibodies in cell-culture and mouse models (17Corada M. Liao F. Lindgren M. Lampugnani M.G.

In a different situation, VE-cadherin/catenins reorganize during polymorphonuclear or monocyte transmigration through the endothelial monolayer (18Luscinskas F.W. Ma S. Nusrat A. Parkos C.A. Shaw S.K. Immunol. Rev. 2002; 186: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). VE-cadherin targeting revealed that in addition to its role in cell-cell adhesion, it is required for transduction of the vascular endothelial growth factor proliferation pathway through β-catenin association to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, which is downstream of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2. Ablation of VE-cadherin interferes with endothelial proliferation and causes apoptosis (6Carmeliet P. Lampugnani M.G. Moons L. Breviario F. Compernolle V. Bono F. Balconi G. Spagnuolo R. Oostuyse B.

However, it is remarkable that the VE-cadherin function was not compensated despite the presence of N-cadherin, which also associates with β-catenin and is expressed in endothelial cells. Thus, it is possible that the cytoplasmic domain of VE-cadherin serves functions that are not completely understood. Although VE-cadherin is classified as a “classical” cadherin in respect to its primary structure, the cytoplasmic tail is unique among the members of this subgroup (19Nollet F. Kools P. van Roy F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 551-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). To study the role of VE-cadherin in signaling mechanisms in endothelial cells, wild type VE-cadherin or the cytoplasmic domain of VE-cadherin mutant was expressed in sub-confluent endothelial cells. The cytoplasmic domain of cadherins has been characterized in a variety of studies as the “dominant negative mutant” for cell-cell adhesion, since its expression blocked cell adhesion in cells of epithelial, neuronal, muscle, and endothelial origin (20Kintner C.

Malik, unpublished data. In endothelial cells a chimera between interleukin 2 receptor extracellular domain and VE-cadherin cytoplasmic domain interfered with proliferation by titrating-out β-catenin from its downstream effectors, and its stable expression in tissue culture cells led to down-regulation of endogenous VE-cadherin and defects in proliferation (25Venkiteswaran K.

In the present study, we observed that non-junctional VE-cadherin induced through its cytoplasmic domain the activation of Cdc42 and the formation of >70-μm-long plasma membrane protrusions. Cdc42 activation was shown to be necessary for the formation of these protrusions. We further demonstrated that Cdc42 activation was not dependent upon β-catenin association to VE-cadherin. Two critical factors were required for the formation of the protrusions, (a) membrane localization of VE-cadherin and (b) association of β-catenin with its cytoplasmic domain. Furthermore, the formation of membrane protrusions was endothelial-specific since it did not occur in epithelial cells. These results suggest a novel role of VE-cadherin cytoplasmic domain in the formation of membrane protrusions, which may be involved in the restoration of endothelial junctional barrier function after the loss of homotypic VE-cadherin adhesion. Human microvascular endothelial cells (HMECs)2 were gifts from Dr. E. W. Ades (26Ades E.W. Candal F.J. Swerlick R.A. George V.G. Summers S. Bosse D.C. Lawley T.J. J. Invest.

HMECs were cultured in MCDB 131 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT). Primary human pulmonary arterial endothelial cells were cultured in EBM 2 (endothelial basal medium) complete medium (BioWhittaker, Walkerville, MD). Bovine lung microvascular endothelial cells, purchased were from VEC Technologies (Renssalaer, NY), were grown in MCDB 131 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and endothelial cell growth supplement (Sigma-Aldrich). Alveolar epithelial cells A549 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. A monoclonal antibody against VE-cadherin was from Chemicon (Temecula, CA), and a goat polyclonal antibody was from Research Diagnostics (Flanders, NJ). Rabbit polyclonal anti-FLAG and anti-Myc-tag monoclonal were from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Franscisco, CA). Mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG (M2) was from Sigma-Aldrich. Monoclonal antibodies for β-catenin, p120, and Rac were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Rabbit anti-Cdc42 was from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Jackson Laboratories (West Grove, PA). For immunofluorescence experiments, we used either fluorescein isothiocyanate and Texas Red (Jackson Laboratories) or Alexa 488 and Alexa 568 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR)-conjugated antibodies. Actin was visualized with Alexa 488-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes). Latrunculin A was purchased from Molecular Probes. VE-cadherin-ΔEXD mutants with and without FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK) were constructed by PCR (plasmid pcDNA3-VEC-ΔEXD). The octapeptide sequence encoding for the FLAG-tag sequence replaced the VE-cadherin extracellular domain by PCR. The human wt VE-cadherin cDNA inserted in the EcoRI site of the pcDNA3 vector was used (plasmid pcDNA3-VEC) as the template. We used either primer d-FL containing the FLAG encoding sequence as sense primers (GAGTCGCAAGAATGCCGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGACCTTCTGCGAGGATATGG) or primer D that lacks the FLAG encoding sequence (GTGAGTCGCAAGAATGCCACCTTCTGCGAGGATATGG). Antisense primer 2002 (ACCTTCTGCGAGGATATGG) was used in both cases. PCR products were digested with BsmI/BstEII, and these fragments were inserted in the BsmI (partial)/BstEII site of pcDNA3-VEC. The mutant version with FLAG (termed ΔEXD) was used generally except where indicated ΔEXD without FLAG. To construct VE-cadherin-ΔEXD-Δβcat mutant, the plasmid pcDNA3- VEC-ΔEXD was digested withHindIII and Bpu10I (partial digestion and Klenow-blunt). This fragment was inserted in theHindIII/ EcoRV site of pcDNA3 (plasmid pcDNA3-VEC-ΔEXD-Δβcat). To make the VE-cadherin-ΔEXD-Δp120 construct, residues 645–654 were deleted by PCR. We used as the sense primer TGGTCACCATGGACACCACCAGCTACGATG. To make the VE-cadherin-ΔEXD-G/A construct we substituted residues GGG (649–651) with AAA by PCR using as sense primer TGGTCACCTACGACGAGGAGGCAGCAGCAGAGATG. For both PCR reactions, we used as the antisense primer TACAGCTCAGCCAGCATCTTAAAC. PCR products containing the deletion or substitution were cloned in the TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) and digested with BstEII/BlpI fragments to replace the wild type BstEII/BlpI sequence from the VE-cadherin-ΔEXD construct. All PCR products were verified by sequencing. Endothelial cells were transfected by electroporation or liposome-mediated DNA transfer (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). For electroporation, 106 cells were seeded in a 100-mm2 dish the day before transfection. After 20–24 h, cells were trypsinized and re-suspended in 300 μl of medium. Plasmid DNA (10 μg) mixed with 14 μg of salmon sperm DNA was added, and cells were electroporated in 0.4-cm cuvettes (Gene Pulser II, Bio-Rad). The conditions were set at 180-mV voltage and 950-millifarad capacitance. To obtain confluent monolayers, 50 μl of transfected cells were applied directly on a gelatinized coverslip and left for 1 h to adhere. Medium was added, and cells were fixed after 48 h. We typically observed 30% transfection efficiency with liposomes and 40% efficiency with electroporation. Cells were grown on 1% gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich)-coated coverslips. They were fixed and stained as described previously (Kouklis et al. (29Kouklis P.D. Hutton E. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar)). The stained cells were visualized either with Nikon Diaphot 200 or Zeiss Pascal confocal microscopes. Protein concentrations of cell extracts were quantified using the BCA protein assay from Pierce. Endothelial cells were washed, scraped with phosphate-buffered saline, and pelleted in 3 × 103 rpm. Total cell extracts were made using immunoprecipitation buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were incubated for 10 min in 4 °C in a shaker and centrifuged in 14 × 103 rpm for 5 min to remove insoluble material. The supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation and Western-blotting experiments (thereafter called “extract”). Extracts were pre-cleared with 2 μg of mouse IgG (Jackson Laboratories) and incubated with 2–3 μg of the first antibody for 2 h in 4 °C before the addition of 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose (incubation for 1 h in 4 °C). Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with TBST buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 1% gelatin (from cold water skin fish, Sigma-Aldrich), incubated for 1 h with primary antibodies, washed with TBST, and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. For anti-Cdc42 antibodies, membranes were blocked with TBST containing 5% nonfat milk and incubated at room temperature for 3 h. The horseradish peroxidase signal was developed using Super Signal (Pierce). BL21 bacterial cultures (20 ml) transformed with GST-PBD expression construct (a gift from Dr. G. Bokoch, Scripps) were induced with 2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h, lysed with 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme, and extracted in 1% Triton X-100, phosphate-buffered saline with protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The supernatant was incubated for 45 min at room temperature with 120 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were washed 3× with phosphate-buffered saline and 2× with MLB buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 5% IGEPAL CA-630, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 2% glycerol, and protease inhibitors). GST-bound beads (20 μl) were incubated with HMEC extracts (200–300 μg of total protein) in 400 μl of MLB buffer O/N at 4 °C. The beads were washed thoroughly with MLB buffer and boiled in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer for subsequent Western blot analysis. Human VE-cadherin cDNA (a gift of Dr. E. Dejana, Mario Negri Institute, Milan, Italy) was used to generate the VE-cadherin extracellular domain deletion mutant (ΔEXD) (Fig. 1 A). Sequences encoding the signal peptide (SP), pre-peptide (PP), and the transmembrane domain (TM) were not deleted so that the mutant could be inserted in membrane. We also constructed mutants identical to ΔEXD with the exception that the residues involved in the binding of β-catenin (ΔEXD-Δβcat) or p120 (ΔEXD-G/A and ΔEXD-Δp120) were deleted (Fig. 1 A). In ΔEXD-Δβcat, residues 743–784 were deleted including SLSS, a highly conserved motif in all cadherin molecules involved in association of β-catenin with cadherins (27Lickert H. Bauer A. Kemler R. Stappert J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5090-5095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). Substitution of GGG residues to AAA (AA 649–651) in ΔEXD-G/A and deletion of residues 645–654 in ΔEXD-Δp120 at the juxtamembrane domain removed the p120 binding site (28Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z. Daniel J.M. Ireton R.C. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Hummingbird D.K. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). To determine expression and correct size of the mutants, HMEC were transfected with ΔEXD, ΔEXD-G/A, ΔEXD-Δp120, or ΔEXD-Δβcat, and Triton X-100 extracts from transfected cells were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. This antibody reacted specifically with 34–36-kDa bands in the ΔEXD-, ΔEXD-Δp120-, and ΔEXD-G/A-transfected cells and a 29-kDa band in ΔEXD-Δβcat-transfected cells (Fig.1 B). No reaction was detected in mock-transfected control cells (Fig. 1 B). HMEC were transiently transfected with wt VE-cadherin, ΔEXD, or ΔEXD-Δβcat mutants. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection, and extracts were tested for Cdc42 activation using the GST-PBD pull-down assay. HMEC cell extracts were incubated with GST-PBD coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Beads were washed and analyzed by Western blotting for Cdc42 binding. We observed that active Cdc42 was bound to PBD in extracts from HMECs transfected with wt VE-cadherin, -ΔEXD, or -ΔEXD-Δβcat (Fig.2). Cdc42 activation remained at the basal level in mock-transfected cells (Fig. 2, GST-PBD). In control experiments, GST beads did not associate with Cdc42 under the same conditions (Fig. 2, GST). At 18–24 h post-transfection of HMECs, the expressed proteins localized at the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm in vesicular structures. We observed that an unusually high percentage of transfected endothelial cells developed very long extensions with a striking cell shape change (Fig. 3 A). These extensions typically showed branching patterns. All cells from randomly selected fields (a total of 50–100 cells/experiment) were photographed to measure protrusion lengths. Cells with extensions greater than 70 μm were scored as positive. Long extensions were evident in ∼60% of cells transfected with ΔEXD and ∼30% of cells transfected with wild type VE-cadherin (Fig. 3 B). As controls, we transfected HMEC with the cytoplasmic domain of another endothelial adherens junction protein, desmoplakin, known to associate with intermediate filaments (29Kouklis P.D. Hutton E. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar); only 9% of these cells showed protrusions. Moreover, only 4% of mock-transfected HMEC showed such protrusions (data not shown). To rule out the possibility that cell shape changes were the result of a transfection artifact, we determined the earliest point that the protrusions were seen in relation to ΔEXD expression. Protrusions were observed as early as 3 h post-transfection at a time when expression of transfected ΔEXD was barely detectable (Fig.3 A). Mutant molecules localized at the plasma membrane, and protrusions reached maximum length within 6 h (as in Fig.7 C). We also expressed ΔEXD in HMEC using retrovirus infection with identical results (data not shown), indicating the development of the protrusion was not secondary to the method used.Figure 7Plasma membrane localization of cadherin cytoplasmic domain but not p120 association is required for membrane protrusion formation. A, HMEC were transfected with ΔEXD-Δβcat, ΔEXD, ΔEXD-G/A, or ΔEXD-Δp120 (lanes Δβcat, ΔEXD,G/A, and Δp120). Cells were lysed, and the mutants were immunoprecipitated (ip) with M2 monoclonal antibody. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-p120 antibody. Note that ΔEXD-G/A and ΔEXD-Δp120 did not associate with p120. B, HMEC were transfected with ΔEXD, fixed 24 h post-transfection, and double-stained with anti-FLAG and anti-p120 antibodies. C, HMECs transfected with ΔEXD-G/A, fixed 6 h post-transfection, and double-stained with anti-FLAG and anti-p120 antibodies. ΔEXD-G/A induced protrusions similar to ΔEXD. Arrowheads indicate ΔEXD-G/A, and thearrow shows p120 localization at the membrane. D, HMECs transfected with ΔEXD-Δp120 fixed after 24 h and double-stained with anti-FLAG and anti-p120 antibodies. ΔEXD-Δp120 localized exclusively in the cytoplasm with no apparent cell shape changes in the transfected cells. All of the above experiments were repeated at least three times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To extend these observations to other endothelial cells, we repeated the same transfection experiments in primary endothelial cells, human pulmonary arterial endothelial cells, and BMVEC (Fig. 3 A); in both cases, membrane extensions formed 24 h after transfection of wt VE-cadherin and -ΔEXD. Endothelial cells transfected with ΔEXD mutant were treated with the actin polymerization inhibitor, latrunculin A (30Spector I. Shochet N.R. Kashman Y. Groweiss A. Science. 1983; 219: 493-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar), and cells were fixed 24 h post-transfection. Latrunculin A in all cases prevented the formation of membrane protrusions (Fig. 3 A), indicating the requirement of actin polymerization in the response. We also transfected alveolar epithelial cells (A531, a type II alveolar epithelial cell line) with ΔEXD to study protrusion formation in non-endothelial cells. No cell shape change or membrane extensions were observed in these cells (Fig. 3 A), demonstrating the importance of cellular background in the mechanism of the response. In HMEC co-transfected with dominant-negative mutant N17Cdc42 and ΔEXD mutant we observed that co-expression of N17Cdc42 inhibited the formation of protrusions (Fig.4). We also co-transfected HMECs with dominant-negative mutants of Rac1 (N17Rac) or RhoA (N14RhoA) and the ΔEXD mutant. N17Rac co-expression resulted in shorter and thinner protrusions in contrast to the inhibition seen with Cdc42 dominant negative mutant (Fig. 4). N14RhoA co-expression had no effect on the ΔEXD-induced protrusion formation (Fig. 4). To quantify the degree of inhibition caused by co-expression of dominant negative mutants of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 along with ΔEXD we measured protrusion lengths in a large number (90–120) of double-transfected cells (Fig. 5). Expression of N17Cdc42 blocked protrusion formation in 100% of double-transfected cells, whereas ∼56% of N19Rho-expressing cells developed protrusions, a percentage very similar to ΔEXD-alone transfected cells. N17Rac blocked protrusion formation to a certain degree but not entirely, i.e. ∼20% of N17Rac-expressing cells formed protrusions of >70 μm. In addition, a significant percentage of double-transfected cells (∼15%) formed slightly shorter protrusions (60–70 μm) in these cells. Expression of wt VE-cadherin and VE-cadherin cytoplasmic domain had profound effects on endothelial cell shape as shown above. Because the cadherin cytoplasmic domain associates with β- and p120-catenins, we investigated the possible roles of these interactions in cell shape change. We generated VE-cadherin cytoplasmic domain mutants ΔEXD-Δβcat lacking the binding site for β-catenin and ΔEXD-G/A and ΔEXD-Δp120 lacking the binding site for p120. wt VE-cadherin, ΔEXD, or ΔEXD-Δβcat were transfected in HMEC, and their association with β-catenin was determined by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. We showed that β-catenin associated with VE-cadherin and -ΔEXD and did not associate with the ΔEXD-Δβcat mutant (Fig.6 A). Also, extracts from HMEC transfected with ΔEXD, ΔEXD-Δβcat, ΔEXD-G/A, or ΔEXD-Δp120 were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody, and p120 association with VE-cadherin mutants was determined by Western blot analysis. p120 associated specifically with ΔEXD and ΔEXD-Δβcat but not with either ΔEXD-G/A or ΔEXD-Δp120 mutants (Fig. 7 A). Double immunofluorescence showed that ΔEXD co-localized with endogenous β-catenin at the plasma membrane and cytoplasmic vesicular structures in transfected cells (Fig. 6 B). ΔEXD-transfected cells also appeared morphologically different from the ΔEXD-Δβcat-transfected cells. The latter formed random, spike-like projections over the entire cell membrane surface (similar to filopodia) that were clearly thinner than the membrane protrusions induced by the ΔEXD mutant (Fig. 6 C). Interestingly, the ΔEXD-Δβcat mutant did not block adherens junction formation (Fig.6 C, βcat; arrow). Because Cdc42 was activated in ΔEXD-Δβcat-transfected endothelial cells (Fig. 2), we compared cell shape changes induced by expression of ΔEXD-Δβcat and the activated mutant of Cdc42. Transfection of HMEC with the constitutively active Cdc42 mutant (V12Cdc42) induced a large number of filopodia (Fig. 6 D). Expression of ΔEXD-Δβcat and V12Cdc42 induced similar filopodia structures secondary to the activation of Cdc42. No striking cell shape changes were observed when ΔEXD-Δβcat was co-transfected with N17Cdc42 (Fig. 6 E), indicating that Cdc42 is involved in filopodia formation induced by ΔEXD-Δβcat. N17Cdc42 was also shown to co-localize with ΔEXD-Δβcat at distinct plasma membrane sites as shown by confocal microscopy (Fig. 6 E). Mutant ΔEXD-G/A did not associate with p120 (Fig. 7 A). To study the localization of ΔEXD-G/A with endogenous p120, cells were fixed at 6 h post-transfection when mutant expression level was low and examined by confocal microscopy. The mutant localized at membrane patches distinct from p120 and cytoplasmic vesicular structures similar to ΔEXD (Fig. 7, B and C). Importantly, at this time point, ΔEXD-G/A-transfected cells also developed long protrusions similar to those after expression of ΔEXD; thus, formation of these protrusions is independent of p120 binding to the VE-cadherin cytoplasmic domain. Quantification of the effect of ΔEXD-G/A expression in protrusion formation showed that ∼55% of ΔEXD-G/A-transfected cells developed protrusions (data not shown). We generated an additional deletion mutant (ΔEXD-Δp120) of VE-cadherin cytoplasmic domain lacking the entire domain for p120 binding (residues 645–654) (28Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z. Daniel J.M. Ireton R.C. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Hummingbird D.K. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). We observed that ΔEXD-Δp120 localized exclusively in the cytoplasm and that membrane protrusions did not develop in these cells (Fig. 7 D). This finding suggests the importance of membrane localization in the mechanism of protrusion formation. We expressed wt VE-cadherin or VE-cadherin cytoplasmic domain mutant in subconfluent endothelial cells. We showed that expression of either of these constructs induced Cdc42 activation and that the expressed cadherins localized at the plasma membrane. These findings suggest that the non-junctional VE-cadherin and especially its cytoplasmic domain was involved in Cdc42 activation. Rho GTPases have been implicated in formation of actin-driven membrane rearrangements (31Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3747) Google Scholar). Cdc42 in particular is considered as an important GTPase, signaling the formation of filopodia (32Kim S.H. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36999-37005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 33Noren N.K. Niessen C.M. Gumbiner B.M. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33305-33308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). We showed that expression of wt VE-cadherin and VE-cadherin cytoplasmic domain induced the formation of membrane protrusions. Co-expression experiments using dominant negative mutants of Rho, Rac, or Cdc42 along with ΔEXD mutant demonstrated that formation of these protrusions was predominantly the result of Cdc42 activation. It is not clear how the cytoplasmic domain of VE-cadherin activates Cdc42. The guanine exchange factor Tiam1 is localized at the cell-cell junctions of epithelial cells and promotes invasiveness of T lymphoma cells across the epithelial barrier (34Hordijk P.L. ten Klooster J.P. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Oomen L.C. Collard J.G. Science. 1997; 278: 1464-14666Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). It is possible that a similar guanine exchange factor may be localized at the VE-cadherin cytoplasmic domain that enables activation of Cdc42 in close proximity to the plasma membrane. To rule out the possibility that formation of membrane protrusions induced by the VE-cadherin cytoplasmic domain is not restricted to a transformed endothelial cell line, we also studied two primary endothelial cells with similar results. Development of long membrane protrusions was clearly evident within 3 h after transfection of the ΔEXD mutant; that is, at a time when mutant expression was barely detected. Thus, it is unlikely that the protrusions were the result of massive overexpression of the transfected mutant. In a control experiment, the expression of desmoplakin, a vimentin binding protein (35Stappenbeck T.S. Bornslaeger E.A. Corcoran C.M. Luu H.H. Virata M.L. Green K.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 691-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), did not affect endothelial cell morphology. In another control experiment expression of VE-cadherin cytoplasmic domain in type II alveolar epithelial cells (A531 cells) also failed to induce membrane protrusions, implying that the effect is endothelial cell-specific. The latter finding is consistent with observations in cultured epithelial cells that expression of E- or N-cadherin ΔEXD mutant failed to induce a cell shape change (23Zhu A.J. Watt F.M. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 3013-3023Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Hertig C.M. Eppenberger-Eberhardt M. Koch S. Eppenberger H.M. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1-10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is well established that cadherin and associated catenins mediate outside-in signaling (6Carmeliet P. Lampugnani M.G. Moons L. Breviario F. Compernolle V. Bono F. Balconi G. Spagnuolo R. Oostuyse B. Dewerchin M. Zanetti A. Angellilo A. Mattot V. Nuyens D. Lutgens E. Clotman F. de Ruiter M.C. Gittenberger-de Groot A. Poelmann R. Lupu F. Herbert J.M. Collen D. Dejana E.

Chem. 1999; 274: 19347-19351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that non-junctional VE-cadherin induces signaling initiated inside endothelial cells, which in turn induces a cell shape change involving formation of membrane protrusion that may restore junctional integrity after the loss of homotypic VE-cadherin adhesion. β- and p120-catenins associate directly with cadherins at well conserved cytoplasmic domains (37Lampugnani M.G. Corada M. Caveda L. Breviario F. Ayalon O. Geiger B. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 203-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 38Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). Because their association with VE-cadherin may be important in the formation of membrane protrusions, we studied their role by expressing the two VE-cadherin cytoplasmic domain mutants lacking either β-catenin or p120 binding sites. An extended domain of 100 residues in cadherin cytoplasmic domain was identified in mediating association with β-catenin (39Huber A.H. Weis W.I. Cell. 2001; 105: 391-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar), but a short conserved motif, SLSS, is required for this association (27Lickert H. Bauer A. Kemler R. Stappert J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5090-5095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 39Huber A.H. Weis W.I. Cell. 2001; 105: 391-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Expression of a construct (ΔEXD-Δβcat) in which this motif was deleted abolished the binding of this mutant to β-catenin without affecting the p120 association; thus, it is likely that ΔEXD-Δβcat mutant was inserted in the membrane in its proper conformation. We showed that the expression of ΔEXD-Δβcat induced the activation of Cdc42 in endothelial cells, but interestingly, this mutant resulted in the formation of thin, needle-like structures resembling filopodia, similar to those induced by expression of the constitutively active Cdc42 mutant. Therefore, VE-cadherin lacking the β-catenin binding site is unable to induce formation of the characteristic membrane protrusions seen with the expression of cytoplasmic domain of VE-cadherin. It is known that β-catenin mediates the association of actin cytoskeleton with cadherin through the actin binding proteins α-catenin (38Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar), α-actinin, and vinculin (40Weiss E.E. Kroemker M. Rudiger A.H. Jockusch B.M. Rudiger M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar); thus, β-catenin plays a crucial role as a linker regulating interaction of cadherin with actin. The differences in cell shape change induced by ΔEXD versusΔEXD-Δβcat can be explained by the absence of β-catenin/α-catenin association in the latter case. Thus actin may fail to bind to VE-cadherin-catenin complex in an appropriate manner to form the characteristic long membrane protrusions. Because it is possible that p120 may also contribute to the formation of membrane protrusions, we expressed a VE-cadherin mutant that was unable to associate with p120. Substitution of GGG to AAA (residues 649–651) abolished p120 binding to VE-cadherin (mutant ΔEXD-G/A), consistent with studies using E-cadherin (28Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z. Daniel J.M. Ireton R.C. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Hummingbird D.K. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the expression of ΔEXD-G/A mutant resulted in a similar phenotype as ΔEXD, indicating that the p120-VE-cadherin association is not essential for protrusion formation. In other studies we compared the results of the ΔEXD-G/A mutant with another mutant, ΔEXD-Δp120, lacking 10 residues at the p120 binding domain. This deletion mutant did not localize at the membrane, and it also failed to induce the cell shape change. Thus, these results suggest that sorting of VE-cadherin at the membrane is required for the formation of membrane protrusions. In previous studies, expression of p120 was shown to induce membrane protrusions in fibroblasts and epithelial cells (a “dendritic” or “branching” phenotype) (41Anastasiadis P.Z. Moon S.Y. Thoreson M.A. Mariner D.J. Crawford H.C. Zheng Y. Reynolds A.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 42Noren N.K. Liu B.P. Burridge K. Kreft B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The expression of cytosolic p120 inhibited RhoA activity in both studies. Noren et al. (42Noren N.K. Liu B.P. Burridge K. Kreft B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) show that p120 expression resulted in Rac1 and Cdc42 activation and that p120 co-precipitated with the guanine exchange factor vav2, suggesting a direct role of cytosolic p120 in Rac1 and Cdc42 activation. Anastasiadis et al. (41Anastasiadis P.Z. Moon S.Y. Thoreson M.A. Mariner D.J. Crawford H.C. Zheng Y. Reynolds A.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) propose that the branching phenotype could be the result of RhoA inhibition and the resultant loss of stress fibers and re-organization of ERM family proteins in the cortical cytoskeleton. Both studies suggest that p120-activated signaling was initiated in the cytoplasm. Our results in endothelial cells show that VE-cadherin is involved in Cdc42 activation at the plasma membrane, but they do not rule out a parallel regulation of GTPases in the cytoplasm induced by p120. In the present study, we provide evidence for the an important role of VE-cadherin in the formation of long protrusions in endothelial cells. Our data show that membrane protrusions form as a result of actin polymerization through Cdc42 activation and the anchorage of the newly synthesized actin filaments to the VE-cadherin cytoplasmic domain. Actin-binding proteins associated with VE-cadherin-β-catenin complex are necessary for the extension of actin cytoskeleton after Cdc42 activation. The dual role of VE-cadherin cytoplasmic domain in Cdc42 activation and formation of actin cytoskeleton extensions may be important in the reassembly of adherens junctions and restoration of endothelial barrier function upon the loss of adherens junctional integrity. We would like to thank X. P. Du for helpful discussions, E. Dejana for providing the human VE-cadherin cDNA, T. Kozasa and T. Voyno-Yasenetskaya for Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 dominant negative mutants, and G. Bokoch for GST-PBD."

Previous work has implicated a C-terminal di-isoleucine motif at residues 316/317 in MC4R cell surface targeting. It was therefore of interest to examine function and cell surface expression of an MC4R mutation found in an obese proband in which one of these isoleucines was substituted by threonine (I317T). Single mutant (I316T or I317T) and double mutant (I316T,I317T) forms of MC4R were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis and tested for function and cell surface expression in transfected cells. Function was assessed using assays for agonist, [Nle4-d-Phe7]α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (NDP-α-MSH) or forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation. Cell surface expression was determined by whole-cell binding of [125I]NDP-α-MSH, fluorescence immunocytochemistry and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Maximal cAMP generation of the single mutants was reduced by 40% of wild-type receptor; the double mutant further reduced function to 40% of control, effects that were mirrored by decreases in cell-surface expression. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that, relative to wild-type receptor, transcript levels for the mutated receptors were not reduced. The results further implicate the C-terminal di-isoleucines in cell surface expression of MC4R and suggest that mutations of residues 316 or 317 would predict MC4R hypofunction.

These genes are either expressed in brain or their products act on brain, indicating the prominent role of this tissue in energy homeostasis. Neurons that express these genes are found in the arcuate and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus and form a neural circuit capable of sensing signals associated with metabolic state and coordinating behavioral and metabolic responses to the metabolic demands of the organism. This neural circuit is composed of at least three distinct neuronal subtypes. One subtype expresses the G protein-coupled melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R).1 MC4R is a Gs-coupled receptor, and its stimulation leads to generation of intracellular cAMP. The other two subtypes provide the MC4R agonist, α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), derived from pro-opiomelanocortin, or the MC4R antagonist ligand, AGRP (agouti-related peptide) (9Cone R.D.

The hormone leptin, secreted from adipose tissue, circulates in the blood and regulates appetite by direct action on the neurons that supply the ligands for MC4R. Activation of MC4R suppresses appetite, and disruption of the gene in mouse and man results in hyperphagia and obesity (11Huszar D. Lynch C.A. Fairchild-Huntress V. Dunmore J.H. Fang Q.

MC4R mutations are relatively common and have been estimated to account for as much as 5% of the obesity found within certain populations (3Yeo G.S. Farooqi I.S. Aminian S. Halsall D.J. Stanhope R.G.

Frameshift mutations in the gene resulting in truncated MC4R protein can exhibit a dominant inheritance pattern, although one example of severe truncation demonstrates variable penetrance (15Vaisse C. Clement K. Durand E. Hercberg S. Guy-Grand B. Froguel P. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Some of the truncated forms have been functionally evaluated, and they neither bind ligand nor become associated with the outer surface of the plasma membrane (16Ho G. MacKenzie R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35816-35822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The results from transfection experiments of cultured cells indicate that the truncated receptor forms do not appear to have a dominant negative function (16Ho G. MacKenzie R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35816-35822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), supporting simple haploinsufficiency as an explanation for the dominant inheritance pattern when it occurs (12Cone R.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 185-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). MC4R haploinsufficiency is consistent with MC4R heterozygotic knockout mice, which exhibit obesity intermediate to wild-type and homozygotic knockout mice (11Huszar D. Lynch C.A. Fairchild-Huntress V. Dunmore J.H. Fang Q. Berkemeier L.R. Gu W. Kesterson R.A. Boston B.A. Cone R.D. Smith F.J. Campfield L.A. Burn P. Lee F. Cell. 1997; 88: 131-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2538) Google Scholar). MC4R haploinsufficiency is not supported in a report describing deletions of human chromosome 18q, which harbors MC4R, resulting in MC4R hemizygosity without obesity (17Cody J.D. Reveles X.T. Hale D.E. Lehman D. Coon H. Leach R.J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 105: 424-427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of MC4R missense mutations, the impact on phenotype generally follows the severity of the impact on receptor function or expression. Notably, the receptor with the N62S mutation was shown to support a partial cAMP response to receptor stimulation and is associated with a recessive inheritance pattern of obesity within the pedigree (14Farooqi I.S. Yeo G.S. Keogh J.M. Aminian S. Jebb S.A. Butler G. Cheetham T. O'Rahilly S. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Results from these genetic analyses indicate little or no receptor reserve of MC4R in human or mouse brains given the sensitivity of the phenotype to reductions in MC4R receptor number or function. The C termini of G protein-coupled receptors contain a conserved, dihydrophobic sequence composed of leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, valine, or methionine and preceded by an acidic glutamate or aspartate (18Schulein R. Hermosilla R. Oksche A. Dehe M. Wiesner B. Krause G. Rosenthal W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Mutation of the conserved dileucine motifs in the vasopressin V2 and lutropin/choriogonadotropin receptors have been shown to limit membrane targeting of these receptors (18Schulein R. Hermosilla R.

In the case of MC4R, the motif is composed of di-isoleucines at codons 316/317. We have shown that MC4R truncated proximal to the di-isoleucines is not expressed on the cell surface, whereas MC4R truncated two residues distal to this site is expressed (16Ho G. MacKenzie R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35816-35822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). It was therefore of interest to note the report of a human mutation, I317T, in an obese proband (21Hinney A. Schmidt A. Nottebom K. Heibult O. Becker I. Ziegler A. Gerber G. Sina M. Gorg T. Mayer H. Siegfried W. Fichter M. Remschmidt H. Hebebrand J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 84: 1483-1486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present report, we make the mutant MC4Rs containing threonine substitutions at either codon 316 or 317, or both, and test the mutants for cell surface expression and function. [Nle4-D-Phe7]α-MSH (NDP-α-MSH) was purchased from Peninsula Laboratories. α-MSH and forskolin was purchased from Calbiochem. 3-Isobutyl-methylxanthine (IBMX) was from Sigma, and [125I]NDP-α-MSH was fromAmersham Biosciences. To construct MC4R sequence variants, wild-type MC4R was modified by adding a Kozak sequence (GCCGCCGCC) and FLAG tag to the N termini of the MC4R coding sequence by conventional PCR-based techniques. PCR products were cloned into the vector pCR3.1 (Invitrogen). PCR products were treated withTaq polymerase (Invitrogen) at 72 °C for 10 min to add 3′ overhanging Ts; subsequent cloning was carried out according to the manufacturer's instruction. The modifications were confirmed by sequencing. Site-directed mutagenesis of the FLAG-MC4R plasmid was accomplished using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Primer pairs (5′-3′) were designed to introduce the desired mutations in the MC4R coding sequence: I316T upstream (CTTCAAAGAGACCATCTGTTG) and downstream (CAACAGATGGTCTCTTTGAAG) primers; I317T upstream (ACCTTCAAAGAGATCACCTGTTGCTATCCCCTG) and downstream (CAGGGGATAGCAACAGGTGATCTCTTTGAAGGT) primers; and I316T,I317T upstream (CTTCAAAGAGACCACCTGTTG) and downstream (CAACAGGTGGCTTCTTTGAAG) primers. Primer pairs (LifeTech) with the desired mutations were annealed to the wild-type expression construct. The plasmid-primer mixture was amplified in a PCR reaction with Pfu turbo DNA polymerase following the manufacturer's recommendations. After amplification the products were treated with the restriction enzyme DpnI. The products of the restriction digest were used to transform competentEscherichia coli, strain XL1-Blue, following the procedure recommended by the manufacturer (Stratagene). Plasmids isolated from the resulting bacterial colonies were screened by DNA sequencing to identify clones with the desired mutations. The entire MC4R coding region of plasmids with mutations was sequenced to confirm the absence of unwanted mutations that might have been introduced during the PCR. 293T and COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (with glutamine; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were incubated at 37 °C in humidified air containing 5% CO2. Cells were generally at 70–80% confluence on the day of transfection, and transfections of FLAG-tagged WT or mutant MC4R plasmids were carried out using LipofectAMINE reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction (Invitrogen). Receptor binding assays were carried out on monolayers of 293T cells transiently transfected with MC4R mutants. HEK-293T cells were transfected in 150 × 25-mm dishes and allowed to incubate overnight at 37 °C in humidified air containing 5% CO2. The cells were detached from plates with PBS, 0.02% EDTA and collected by centrifugation. The cells were plated into 24-well culture dishes at a density of 2.5 × 104 cells/well and allowed to attach overnight. The binding was carried out in a total volume of 200 μl containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 1 mg/ml BSA, 50 pm[125I]NDP-α-MSH, and increasing concentrations of cold NDP-α-MSH. After a 90-min incubation, the medium was aspirated and the wells were washed three times with 0.5 ml/well of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS, Invitrogen) containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA. 100 μl of 0.1n NaOH was added to the wells, and the cell lysates were transferred to 20-ml glass vials containing 15 ml of scintillation mixture. The samples were counted in a Packard Tri-Carb liquid scintillation counter. Nonlinear regression analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). 48 h after transfection, 293T cells were washed once with PBS and then detached from the plate with PBS containing 0.02% EDTA (Sigma). The detached cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) containing 0.5 mm IBMX, 2 mmHEPES, pH 7.5 (IBMX buffer). After incubation at 37 °C for 15 min to allow for IBMX uptake, 0.4 ml of cell suspension (∼5 × 105 cells/ml) was added to 0.1 ml of IBMX buffer containing various concentrations of agonists or 10 μm forskolin. The cells were subsequently incubated at 37 °C for 15 min to allow for cAMP accumulation. The activity was terminated by adding 0.5 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid, and cAMP released from lysed cells was assayed by the cAMP 125I scintillation proximity assay system (Amersham Biosciences). EC50 values were calculated with a 95% confidence interval using GraphPad Prism software (using nonlinear regression analysis fitted with a sigmoidal dose-response curve with variable slope). COS-7 cells were chosen for this study as they were more adherent than 293T cells during the staining process. 24 h after transfection, COS-7 cells were seeded onto 25 mm circular microscope coverslips, size 1 (Fisher Scientific), in six-well culture plates (Corning-Costar) and incubated overnight. The next day, the cells were washed four times with DPBS and fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in DPBS followed by four washes with DPBS. Cells were then incubated for 5 min either with DPBS alone for nonpermeabilized staining or with DPBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for permeabilization. Following blocking for 30 min with DPBS containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 2% BSA (blocking buffer), cells were incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer containing 1 μg/ml anti-FLAG monoclonal antibodies M2 (Sigma) followed by three washes each for 10 min with blocking buffer. Cells were then incubated for 30 min in blocking buffer containing a 1:1000 dilution of Oregon Green 488 goat anti-mouse IgG conjugate (highly cross-absorbed; Molecular Probes). After being washed twice for 10 min with DPBS, cells were mounted an glass slides using Aqua-PolyMount (Polysciences, Inc.) and viewed using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Fluoview, Olympus). 48 h post-transfection, HEK-293 cell monolayers were washed with incubation buffer (DPBS containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 1 mg/ml BSA). The cells were detached from the plates by incubation in DPBS with 0.02% EDTA (Sigma, catalog No. E8008). The cells were collected by centrifugation, washed in incubation buffer, and then suspended to a concentration of 4.0 × 107 cells/ml in incubation buffer. 50 μl of cells were incubated with 50 μl of 10 μg/ml murine anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma, catalog No. 316) in incubation buffer for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were collected by centrifugation and washed three times in incubation buffer. The cell pellets were suspended in 100 μl of incubation buffer containing 1 μg/ml Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Molecular Probes, catalog No. A-11001) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The cells were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with incubation buffer. The final cell pellets were suspended in incubation buffer to a concentration of 2.0 × 106 cells/ml. Propidium iodide was added to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml, and the cell suspensions were passed through a 100-μm filter prior to flow cytometry. Flow cytometry was performed on a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS Vantage S.E., BD Biosciences). Single live cells were gated by scatter and negative propidium iodide fluorescence, 488 nm excitation wavelength, 675 nm emission wavelength. For each transfection, the fluorescence of 25,000 single live cells was measured at 488 excitation wavelength, 530 nm emission wavelength, to measure the expression of the FLAG antigen on the surface of the cells. 48 h post-transfection, total RNA was isolated from cells using TriSol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. RNA was reverse transcribed using TaqMan® reverse transcription reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). 400 ng of total RNA was transcribed in a 50-μl reaction. Reaction mixture contained 5.5 mm MgCl2, 500 μm each dNTP, 2.5 μm random hexamers, 200 units of RNase inhibitor, and 62.5 units of MultiScribe reverse transcriptase. Reverse transcription reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 15 min, 48 °C for 30 min, and 95 °C for 5 min. Multiplex PCR reactions were run on reverse transcribed RNAs to quantitate the relative abundance of MC4R RNA in the original RNA samples. Human MC4R primers and a FAM-Fluorescent probe to a region near the 3′-end of the coding region of the MC4R sequence, conserved in the wild-type and mutant sequences, were designed using the Primer Express software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and synthesized (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The real-time quantitative RT-PCR, using 18 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) for normalization, was performed using TaqMan® Universal PCR Master Mix reagents and TaqMan® Ribosomal RNA control reagents (VIC Dye) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) essentially following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, each reaction mixture contained 5.5 mm MgCl2, 500 μm dNTP, 600 nm both forward and reverse 18 S rRNA primers, 200 nm 18 S rRNA-VIC probe, 600 nm both forward and reverse MC4R primers, 200 nm MC4R-FAM probe, and cDNA in a final volume of 25 μl. Reactions were run and analyzed using ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). MC4R mRNA levels were normalized to 18 S rRNA, and the relative copy number was determined using the standard curve method for multiplex PCR as detailed in User Bulletin No. 2 for the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). To assess the impact of threonine substitution at isoleucines 316 and 317 on cell surface expression of MC4R, FLAG-tagged WT or mutated MC4R was transfected into HEK-293 cells and tested for whole-cell binding of 125I-labeled MC4R agonist. Compared with cells expressing FLAG-tagged wild-type MC4R, whole-cell binding of a subsaturating concentration (50 pm) of [125I]NDP-α-MSH was decreased in cells expressing either of the singly substituted mutants I316T or I317T by 41 and 34%, respectively (Fig. 1, TableI). Transfection of the double mutant (DMut), in which the isoleucines at both positions 316 and 317 were changed to threonines, resulted in no detectable specific binding (Fig. 1). The affinity (K i ) of MC4R for the agonist, NDP-α-MSH, was not affected by either I316T or I317T (TableI). Specific whole-cell binding of the label to control HEK-293 cells transfected with an expression construct for green fluorescent protein (GFP) was undetectable and did not differ from untransfected cells (data not shown).Table IPharmacological properties of MC4R WT and mutantsWTI316TI317TDMutMaximum specific binding, fmol of 125I-NDP-α-MSH/well: mean ± S.E.0.66 ± 0.060.39 ± 0.040.44 ± 0.040.04 ± 0.006K i, nm [NDP-α-MSH]: mean + 95% confidence interval16 (7–39)13 (5–34)12 (7–22)NDMaximum cAMP accumulation, fold-stimulation: mean ± S.E.49 ± 135 ± 231 ± 215 ± 1EC50, nm [NDP-α-MSH]: mean + 95% confidence interval0.9 (0.6–1.2)0.7 (0.2–2.1)1.0 (0.3–4.1)3.2 (0.5–18)Statistical significance between group means was determined by one-way analysis of variance followed by the Newman-Keuls test.

There were no significant differences between group means (p > 0.05) for measures ofK i and EC50. Compared with HEK-293 cells transfected with FLAG-tagged WT MC4R, cells expressing the singly substituted receptor at I316T or I317T showed 29 and 37% reductions, respectively, in maximal agonist-stimulated cAMP accumulation (Fig. 2, Table I). In cells transfected with the double mutant, this measure was further reduced to 31% of WT values (Fig. 2 and Table I). Cells transfected with control GFP exhibited no agonist-stimulated cAMP accumulation (Fig. 2). The EC50 values for NDP-α-MSH-dependent cAMP generation were not affected by threonine substitution of the isoleucines at positions 316 and 317 (Table I). Stimulation of HEK-293 cells by 10 μm forskolin increased cAMP accumulation by 5-fold, an effect that was greatly potentiated in cells transfected with WT MC4R (Fig. 3). The ability of MC4R receptor transfection to potentiate forskolin-stimulated cAMP generation appeared lower in the single mutants, although differences between the WT and single mutant group means were not statistically significant (Fig. 3). Transfection of the double mutant resulted in significantly lower forskolin-stimulated cAMP production than in the WT or single mutants and was not different from cells expressing control GFP (Fig. 3).Figure 3Forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with wild-type or mutated MC4Rs.

To distinguish receptors on the cell surface from intracellular receptors, a monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody was used with non-permeabilized and permeabilized cells, respectively. Threonine substitutions of the isoleucines at positions 316 and 317 had no effect on immunofluorescent labeling of receptor in permeabilized cells (Fig. 4). In non-permeabilized cells, it appeared that more WT receptors were targeted to the cell surface than either of the I316T or I317T mutants and that cell surface targeting was further reduced in the double mutant (Fig. 4). To quantitate immunofluorescent detection of FLAG-tagged WT or mutant MC4R, HEK-293 cells transiently expressing these receptor forms were detected and counted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Twenty-five thousand cells from each transfection were sorted, and the percentage of cells having a fluorescence intensity signal above a previously determined cutoff value was determined (Fig.5). Forty-five percent of cells expressing the FLAG-tagged WT MC4R (mean fluorescence intensity signal = 61) met this criterion, whereas only 26% of cells expressing either I316T or I317T (mean fluorescence intensity signals = 31 and 32, respectively) and 6% of cells expressing the double mutant exhibited fluorescence intensity (mean fluorescence intensity signal = 14) above the cutoff value (Fig. 5). To determine whether the decreased cell surface expression of MC4R mutants was due to decreased transcript levels mutant mRNA, because of either to decreased transcription or stability, the transcript levels of WT and mutant receptor forms were measured by TaqMan® quantitative RT-PCR. Reversed transcribed RNA from each transfection was serially diluted and transcript level of MC4R determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results obtained from the dilution experiments indicate that the technique is sufficiently sensitive to detect 2-fold differences in transcript level (Fig 6 A). To show the specificity of the MC4R primers and probes, cells were transfected with a control expression construct for the 5-HT7 receptor and probed for MC4R transcript. RNA collected and reverse transcribed from these cells and probed for MC4R transcripts required many more amplification cycles to generate a signal (Fig 6 A). Cycle threshold number for 5-HT7-transfected cells was equal to the background signal seen using herring sperm DNA as input (data not shown). Normalization of the data to 18 S rRNA revealed that the transcript levels of wild-type and single mutant forms were not different from each other (Fig 6 B). However, the transcript level for the double mutant was greater. Relative to wild-type levels, double mutant transcript copy numbers were 2.2- and 2.4-fold greater at the 20 and 10 ng input levels, respectively (Fig. 6 B). Previous work has indicated that the di-isoleucine pair at amino acid residues 316 and 317 in the C terminus of the MC4R might be important for cell surface targeting (16Ho G. MacKenzie R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35816-35822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). An MC4R transition mutation has been described in an obese human proband in which thymine is replaced by cytosine at base position 950, resulting in the substitution of threonine for the isoleucine at 317 (21Hinney A. Schmidt A. Nottebom K. Heibult O. Becker I. Ziegler A. Gerber G. Sina M. Gorg T. Mayer H. Siegfried W. Fichter M. Remschmidt H. Hebebrand J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 84: 1483-1486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Results obtained from the present study indicate that these C-terminal isoleucines are important for normal cell surface expression of MC4R in transiently transfected cells and that substitution of isoleucine by threonine at position 316 or 317 lowers MC4R cell surface expression. Double substitutions by threonine are additive. I316T or I317T each lowers the binding of the 125I-labeled MC4R agonist NDP-α-MSH to the cell surface but does not change receptor affinity for the ligand. The reduced binding is reflected in reduced agonist- as well as forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation. It is not clear whether the latter, agonist-independent activation of MC4R is due to a meaningful constitutive MC4R activity (22Nijenhuis W.A. Oosterom J. Adan R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 23Alewijnse A.E. Smit M.J. Rodriguez-Pena M.S. Verzijl D. Timmerman H. Leurs R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) or whether it is an artifact of receptor overexpression. Regardless, it does appear to report changes in receptor cell surface expression. Qualitative imaging by immunofluorescence microscopy of changes in cell surface expression suggests reduced cell surface expression of the single mutants, although the differences in this measurement were more definitive using the quantitative approach afforded by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. This work establishes the importance of the C-terminal di-isoleucine pair for normal cell surface expression of MC4R. Previous work (18Schulein R. Hermosilla R. Oksche A. Dehe M. Wiesner B. Krause G. Rosenthal W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) has indicated that the di-leucine motif in the C terminus of the vasopressin V2 receptor is important in the exiting of the receptor from the endoplasmic reticulum. In that study, single substitutions of hydrophobic leucines by hydrophobic isoleucine had no effect on V2 receptor cell surface expression (18Schulein R. Hermosilla R. Oksche A. Dehe M. Wiesner B. Krause G. Rosenthal W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar); however, substitution of either leucine by the polar threonine decreased cell surface expression, and the double substitution completely suppressed it. An examination of the C terminus of the family of melanocortin receptors indicates high sequence conservation only through the first 15 residues (Fig. 7). The dihydrophobic motif, at C-terminal residues 12 and 13, is completely conserved in this receptor family, although it is composed of various hydrophobic amino acids(Fig. 7). A survey of C termini from 384 G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) from the Swiss Protein Database (European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany) showed that 180 GPCRs contained a C-terminal dihydrophobic pair consisting of II, LL, IL, or LI within the first 45 residues and that the most frequently occurring starting position of these pairs was position 12 (Fig. 8).Figure 8Stacked histogram of the amino acid position number of leucine or isoleucine pairs in the C terminus of 195 GPCRs. 334 randomly selected human GPCRs were scanned for the occurrence of a leucine or isoleucine pair (LL,LI, IL, or II) within the first 45 residues of the C-terminal tail, and the position numbers of the pairs were recorded. 180 GPCRs contained at least one pair and, as shown in the figure, the position of the pairs peaked 10–13 residues from the end of the seventh transmembrane (TM) domain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Results from the present work do not indicate how the di-isoleucine pair functions to regulate cell surface expression of MC4R or even whether the motif operates by affecting transit to or from the plasma membrane. Acidic dihydrophobic motifs, in particular di-leucine pairs preceded by a cluster of acidic amino acids, have been shown to be sorting receptor binding sites for the GGA (Golgi-localizing, γ-adaptin ear homology domain, ARF-interacting) proteins required for the transport of protein cargo from the trans-Golgi network to endosomes (24Robinson M.S.

Nakayama K. Wakatsuki S. Nature. 2002; 415: 937-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The C-terminal dihydrophobic motif that appears in GPCRs is preceded, in many GPCRs, by a conserved acidic amino acid (18Schulein R. Hermosilla R. Oksche A. Dehe M. Wiesner B. Krause G. Rosenthal W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Moreover, substitution of this residue (glutamate) by glutamine in the vasopressin V2 receptor also blocks cell surface expression of the receptor (18Schulein R. Hermosilla R. Oksche A. Dehe M. Wiesner B. Krause G. Rosenthal W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It is possible that the GPCR dihydrophobic motif serves as an intramolecular binding site necessary for protein folding or an intermolecular binding site for an adaptor-related protein required for appropriate membrane trafficking. On the basis of results from the present study, we would predict that the MC4R mutation I317T would decrease MC4R cell surface expression and function. The MC4R haploinsufficiency seen in human carriers of truncation mutations (3Yeo G.S. Farooqi I.S. Aminian S. Halsall D.J. Stanhope R.G. O'Rahilly S. Nat.

Extrapolating from the present cell culture data, a heterozygotic carrier of the I317T mutation might be expected to have at least 80% normal MC4R expression. The reported obese proband was heterozygotic for I317T and was extremely obese (above the 99th percentile, body mass index = 36.5 kg/m2). If this were the sole obesity-related mutation for the proband, it would suggest an extreme sensitivity to the loss of MC4R. Further genetic investigation of this pedigree and of others with mutations of the C-terminal di-isoleucines 316/317 is required."

Tyrosinase undergoes a complex post-translational processing before reaching the melanosomal membrane. This processing involves N-glycosylation in several sites, including one located in the CuB copper binding site, movement from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi, copper binding, and sorting to the melanosome. Aberrant processing is causally related to the depigmented phenotype of human melanomas. Moreover, some forms of albinism and several other pigmentary syndromes are considered ER retention diseases or trafficking defects. A critical step in tyrosinase maturation is the acquisition of an ER export-competent conformation recognized positively by the ER quality control system. However, the minimal structural requirements allowing exit from the ER to the Golgi have not yet been identified for tyrosinase or other melanosomal proteins. We addressed this question by analyzing the enzymatic activity and glycosylation pattern of mouse tyrosinase point mutants and chimeric constructs, where selected portions of tyrosinase were replaced by the homologous fragments of the highly similar tyrosinase-related protein 1. We show that a completely inactive tyrosinase point mutant lacking a critical histidine residue involved in copper binding is nevertheless able to exit from the ER and undergo further processing. Moreover, we demonstrate that tyrosinase displays at least two sites whose glycosylation is post-translational and most likely conformation- dependent and that a highly specific interaction involving the CuB site is essential not only for correct glycosylation but also for exit from the ER and enzymatic activity.

The amino acidl-tyrosine is the metabolic precursor of the pigment. In the presence of catalytic amounts ofl-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), Tyr catalyzesl-tyrosine conversion into l-dopaquinone (7Cooksey C.J. Garratt P.J. Land E.J. Pavel S. Ramsden C.A.

This reactive intermediate undergoes spontaneous cyclization and rearrangement to l-dopachrome in the absence of thiol compounds (8Prota G. Melanins and Melanogenesis. Academic Press, Inc., New York1992Google Scholar). Tyrp2 (dopachrome Δ2,Δ7-isomerase; EC 5.3.3.12), also called dopachrome tautomerase, catalyzes the tautomerization of dopachrome into the more stable intermediate 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (9Aroca P.

Although the enzymatic function(s) of Tyrp1 is still somewhat controversial, the protein purified from mouse melanocytes has been reported to be a low specific activity Tyr isozyme with both tyrosine hydroxylase and DOPA oxidase activities (11Jiménez-Cervantes C.

Sequence similarity between Tyr and the Tyrps is higher in the metal ion binding sites (Fig. 1), but the proteins also share several conservedN-glycosylation sites (reviewed in Ref. 15Garcı́a-Borrón J.C. Solano F. Pigment Cell Res. 2002; 15: 162-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Tyr and the Tyrps are transmembrane glycoproteins whose final destination is the melanosome, a melanocyte-specific organelle where melanin synthesis is confined. The proteins of the family undergo a complex post-translational processing before reaching the melanosomal membrane in their final catalytically active conformational state. In the mouse, Tyr processing includes N-glycosylation in at least four of the six available glycosylation sites (16Branza-Nichita N. Negroiu G. Petrescu A.J. Garman E.F. Platt F.M. Wormald M.R. Dwek R.A. Petrescu S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8169-8175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Human TYR, displaying seven potential glycosylation sites, can appear as a protein with six or seven glycans, depending on the translation rate (17Ujvari A. Aron R. Eisenhaure T. Cheng E. Parag H.A. Smicun Y. Halaban R. Hebert D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5924-5931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). During its post-translational processing, the mammalian enzyme also undergoes movement from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, binding of the copper cofactor to two sites designated CuA and CuB (18Spritz R.A. Ho L. Furumura M. Hearing V.J.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 109: 207-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and finally sorting to the melanosomes. The importance of Tyr post-translational processing is highlighted by several observations. Aberrant processing is causally related to the depigmented phenotype of human melanomas (19Halaban R. Cheng E. Zhang Y. Moellmann G. Hanlon D. Michalak M. Setaluri V. Hebert D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6210-6215Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). On the other hand, oculocutaneous albinism type 1 is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by the absence of pigment in hair, skin, and eyes, with other common features such as severe nystagmus, photophobia, and reduced visual acuity, associated with mutations in theTyr gene (reviewed in Ref. 20Oetting W.S. Pigment Cell Res. 2000; 13: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Some forms of oculocutaneous albinism type 1 are considered ER retention diseases (21Halaban R. Svedine S. Cheng E.

J. 2001; 355: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and several other pigmentary syndromes are accounted for by processing/trafficking defects (24Beermann F. Orlow S.J. Boissy R.E. Schmidt A. Boissy Y.L. Lamoreux M.L. Exp. Eye Res. 1995; 61: 599-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 25Chen K. Manga P. Orlow S.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1953-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In this respect, it has recently been shown that the most common form of albinism worldwide, oculocutaneous albinism type 2, results from mutations in thepink-eyed dilution (p) gene (26Lee S.T. Nicholls R.D. Bundey S. Laxova R. Musarella M. Spritz R.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 330: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and that the p protein contributes to the correct processing of Tyr and to its traffic to the melanosome (25Chen K. Manga P. Orlow S.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1953-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Therefore, correct processing and intracellular trafficking of Tyr and also probably of Tyrps is critical to normal pigmentation. According to current evidence, recently synthesized Tyr is retained by the ER quality control machinery until the proper conformation is acquired. Then glycosylated and correctly folded Tyr is exported to the Golgi, where N-linked oligosaccharide chains are further processed and copper is probably bound. One of the potential glycosylation sites, located in the CuB site, appears particularly relevant. It is conserved in human and mouse Tyr and Tyrps (Fig. 1), and its glycosylation has been reported to correlate with proper cofactor binding and full enzymatic activity (16Branza-Nichita N. Negroiu G. Petrescu A.J. Garman E.F. Platt F.M. Wormald M.R. Dwek R.A. Petrescu S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8169-8175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Moreover, a natural mutation destroying this glycosylation sequon results in oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (27Spritz R.A. Strunk K.M. Giebel L.B. King R.A. N. Eng. J. Med. 1990; 322: 1724-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Therefore, a critical step in pigmentation is the acquisition by tyrosinase of a conformation recognized positively by the ER quality control system. However, the minimal structural requirements allowing for exit from the ER have not yet been identified for Tyr or for other melanosomal proteins. This knowledge would help understand the molecular basis of albinism. Moreover, due to the likely relationships of different post-translational processes such as glycosylation, metal cofactor binding and movement between intracellular compartments, a description of these requirements may also provide a model for other metalloproteins that follow the secretory sorting pathway. We have addressed this question by analyzing the enzymatic activity and glycosylation pattern of Tyr point mutants and chimeric constructs, where selected portions of the Tyr molecule were replaced by the homologous fragments of Tyrp1. With this approach, we show that although glycosylation of the CuB acceptor sequon is necessary for full enzymatic activity, it is not a “sine qua non” requirement for ER export, copper binding, and complete maturation. Moreover, mutation of a critical histidine residue involved in copper binding and abolishing completely Tyr activity does not block completely Tyr processing to a mature form. Finally, our results prove that a specific interaction involving the CuB site is essential for processing beyond the ER and for the conformation-dependentN-glycan addition to at least two glycosylation sequons. The radioactive substratel-[3,5-3H]-tyrosine, specific activity 50 Ci/mmol, was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. The specific αPEP1 and αPEP7 antisera, recognizing the C-terminal cytosolic extension of mouse Tyrp1 and Tyr, respectively, were a kind gift from Dr. V. Hearing (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The goat polyclonal antibody against the carboxyl terminus of calnexin was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Electrophoresis and Western blot reagents and materials were from Bio-Rad, unless otherwise specified. Reagents and plasticware for cell culture were obtained from Nunc (Roskilde, Denmark) or Invitrogen. Other reagents were from Sigma, Merck, or Prolabo (Barcelona, Spain). Enzymes for DNA cleavage and modification were from Invitrogen or Fermentas (Hanover, MD). Endoglycosidase H (Endo H) and N-glycosidase F (Endo F) were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All expression constructs were prepared in the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen) and were based on the mouseTyr and Tyrp1 clones obtained as described elsewhere (33Olivares C. Jiménez-Cervantes C. Lozano J.A. Solano F. Garcı́a-Borrón J.C. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Point mutants were created by PCR with the mutagenic primers shown in Table I, as described (33Olivares C. Jiménez-Cervantes C. Lozano J.A. Solano F. Garcı́a-Borrón J.C. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Concerning the chimeric constructs derived from Tyrand Tyrp1 sequences, their structures are summarized in Fig.2. Regarding the Tyr(A)-Tyrp1(B) and Tyrp1(A)-Tyr(B) chimerae, we first abolished an existingSphI restriction site at position 361 in the wild typeTyrp1 with a silent single base substitution within the target sequence (primer number 10) and created a new SphI site immediately before the codon corresponding to the first His in CuB (primer number 11). A homologous restriction site is present at this position in wild type Tyr, thus allowing for the fusion of the upstream and downstream portions of the Tyr andTyrp1 genes with conservation of the protein reading frame. The modified Tyrp1 (coding for a protein carrying one amino acid substitution, L376M) was cloned into pBlueScript KSII and used to generate 5′ EcoRI-SphI or 3′SphI-XbaI fragments that were used to replace the homologous fragments of Tyr, cloned into pBlueScript KSII. The full-length chimeric constructs were subsequently subcloned into pcDNA3. The Tyr-MeB chimera was constructed by PCR, using primers 2 and 12 with the H389L Tyr construct as template. This amplicon was then purified and used as a reverse primer, with forward primer 1 and the Tyr(A)-Tyrp1(B) construct as a template, under low astringency conditions compatible with primer extension. All constructs were verified by automated sequencing of both strands, performed at the core facility of the Instituto de Investigaciones Biológicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientı́ficas (Madrid, Spain).Table IOligonucleotides employed in the preparation of the chimeric constructs and point mutantsNumberName1-aThe name of the primers refers to the construct that they generate, when possible.

Open table in a new tab Transfection of HEK 293T cells was performed with the Superfect reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested 20 h after transfection and processed for enzyme activity determinations or Western blot as described below. B16 mouse melanoma cells were cultured as described previously (28Martı́nez-Esparza M. Jiménez-Cervantes C. Beermann F. Aparicio P. Lozano J.A. Garcı́a-Borrón J.C. J. Biol.

Cells were harvested with trypsin, washed twice with saline phosphate buffer, and solubilized in 10 mmsodium phosphate, pH 6.8, containing 1% Igepal CA-630, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, using a ratio of ∼1 ml solubilization buffer/107 cells. For expression studies, HEK 293T cells were employed. This is a SV40 T antigen-transformed subline of the permanent line of primary human embryonal kidney cells HEK 293 (ATCC number CRL-1573), widely used for the transient expression of genes cloned into vectors carrying the SV40 origin such as pcDNA3. HEK 293T cells were grown in six-well plates with RPMI 1640, 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, as described elsewhere (29Jiménez-Cervantes C. Germer S. González P. Sánchez J. Olivares C. Garcı́a-Borrón J.C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Crude extracts were prepared as for B16 cells. The protein content of the extracts was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method, using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The tyrosine hydroxylase activity of tyrosinase was determined by a radiometric method (30Jara J.R. Solano F. Lozano J.A. Pigment Cell Res. 1988; 1: 332-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). One unit was defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the hydroxylation of 1 μmol of l-tyrosine/min, in the presence of a 50 μm concentration of the substrate and 10 μmDOPA as cofactor. DOPA oxidase activity was measured spectrophotometrically in the presence of 4 mm3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone, as described by others (31Winder A.J. Harris H. Eur. J.

Samples were mixed in a 2:1 ratio with 3× sample buffer (0.18 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 15% glycerol, 0.075% bromphenol blue, 9% SDS, with or without 3m 2-mercaptoethanol), and electrophoresed at 4 °C. A highly sensitive and specific DOPA oxidase activity stain was carried out by equilibrating gels run under nonreducing conditions at pH 6.0, with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, followed by incubation at 37 °C in 2 mm DOPA, 4 mm3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone, in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, for 15–30 min (32Jiménez-Cervantes C. Valverde P. Garcı́a-Borrón J.C. Solano F. Lozano J.A. Pigment Cell Res. 1993; 6: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For deglycosylation studies, the extracts were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h in the presence of 5 units of either Endo H or Endo F in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 10 mm EDTA and 0.1% SDS. Samples for Endo F digestion were heated at 95 °C for 5 min prior to incubation at 37 °C and processed as previously described for electrophoresis. For Western blots, SDS-PAGE gels were run under nonreducing conditions, as described above. Transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PolyScreen; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was done in a semidry unit. Immunodetection of Tyr, Tyrp1, and the mutant proteins was performed with the αPEP7 or αPEP1 antisera, as appropriate, following previously published procedures (33Olivares C. Jiménez-Cervantes C.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 679-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Staining and detection were done with the ECL Plus chemiluminescent substrate (Amersham Biosciences). The relative intensities of the specific bands were quantified in a Gel Doc system (Bio-Rad), using the Multi-Analyst software. For immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were solubilized in 400 mm KCl, 2% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, buffer with 1× protease inhibitor mixture (50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). 200 μl of cell lysate (∼2 × 106cells) were precleared by incubation with 20 μl of prewashed Protein G PLUS-agarose slurry (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h on ice. Immunoprecipitation was then performed by incubating 2 μg of calnexin C-20 goat polyclonal IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) with 20 μl of Protein G PLUS-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C with continuous shaking, followed by the addition of the precleared lysate and further incubation from 2 h to overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed four times with a 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 500 mm KCl, 400 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Triton X-100. 20 μl of 1.5× sample buffer for SDS-PAGE with 2-mercaptoethanol were added to the beads and incubated for 10 min at 95 °C. Supernatants were processed for SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with αPEP7 as previously described. Analysis of the structure-function relationships in the Tyr family proteins by site-directed mutagenesis requires an efficient expression system. To date, a variety of heterologous cells devoid of endogenous melanogenic enzymes have been used for the stable or transient expression of the corresponding genes. Recent studies employed COS7 (23Toyofuku K. Wada I. Spritz R.A. Hearing V.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 34Olivares C. Garcı́a-Borrón J.C. Solano F.

We have found that HEK 293T cells transfected with wild type and mutant Tyr constructs cloned into pcDNA3 transiently express very high levels of active Tyr (33Olivares C. Jiménez-Cervantes C. Lozano J.A. Solano F. Garcı́a-Borrón J.C. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined Tyr folding and processing in these cells by means of glycosidase digestion with Endo H and Endo F, followed by Western blot. Endo H efficiently cleaves high mannose glycans, such as the ones found in incompletely processed glycoproteins present in the ER (37Parodi A.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 69-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). However, upon further processing to complex glycans in the medial Golgi, glycoproteins become resistant to Endo H. Accordingly, sensitivity to Endo H provides a criterion to distinguish early forms of ER-resident, incompletely processed tyrosinase from mature forms of the enzyme (19Halaban R. Cheng E. Zhang Y.

On the other hand, Endo F removes all forms of glycans, irrespective of their degree of processing and trimming, thus allowing for an estimation of the size of the polypeptide backbone of glycoproteins. Western blots of native and glycosidase-treated wild type Tyr expressed in HEK 293T cells showed a major band (apparentM r 78.4 ± 0.9 kDa, n ≥ 5) and a faster migrating minor band (M r 69.5 ± 0.5 kDa, n ≥ 5) (Fig.3 A). Upon treatment with Endo F, a single band of 55.5 ± 1.5 kDa was seen, corresponding to the deglycosylated protein backbone. Therefore, the two bands present in the native extracts corresponded to different glycosylation forms. The expressed Tyr protein was mostly resistant to Endo H, thus showing that it is a mature, post-ER form (Fig. 3 A). The enzymatic activity of crude extracts from transfected HEK 293T cells was higher than in B16 mouse melanoma cells (for tyrosine hydroxylase activity, 526 ± 26 microunits/mg protein versus 305 ± 27 microunits/mg in B16 melanoma cells, and for DOPA oxidase activity 51 ± 2 milliunits/mg versus 32 ± 4 milliunits/mg), consistent with an efficient expression, folding, and processing of the protein. In keeping with the behavior of Tyr, wild type Tyrp1 was also processed to an Endo H-resistant protein of 78.1 ± 1.2 kDa (n ≥ 3) that could be deglycosylated by Endo F to yield a 57.4 ± 0.9-kDa protein core (Fig. 3 B). Therefore, HEK 293T cells efficiently express and process both Tyr and Tyrp1 and constitute a suitable model to study the folding determinants of the Tyr family proteins. In the course of a study aiming to define structural elements specific for each protein of the Tyr family and to differentiate them from common elements that can fulfill their function within any member of the family, we constructed and analyzed several chimeric proteins. In preliminary experiments, two constructs designated Tyr(A)/Tyrp1(B) and Tyrp1(A)/Tyr1(B) were studied. Tyr(A)/Tyrp1(B) comprises the complete N-terminal portion of Tyr, up to residue 362 (the residue preceding the first His ligand in the CuB site, His363), and then the complete CuB and C-terminal portion of Tyrp1, including the cytosolic tail, which bears all of their necessary sorting and trafficking signals (reviewed in Ref. 15Garcı́a-Borrón J.C. Solano F. Pigment Cell Res. 2002; 15: 162-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Conversely, Tyrp1(A)/Tyr1(B) contains an opposite distribution, with the N-terminal moiety of Tyrp1 followed by the in-frame CuB site and C terminus of Tyr (Fig. 2). The size of the polypeptide backbone of the two chimeric proteins is similar, with 523 amino acids for Tyr(A)/Tyrp1(B) and 547 for Tyrp1(A)/Tyr1(B), as compared with 533 and 537 amino acids for Tyr and Tyrp1, respectively. Thus, should glycosylation and post-translational processing of the constructs and wild type proteins be comparable, the electrophoretic mobility of the chimeric and the parent proteins in reducing SDS gels would also be very similar. However, we detected an abnormal electrophoretic pattern, with a single band of higher mobility than expected (Fig. 4), corresponding to apparent molecular masses of 65.3 ± 1.2 (n = 3) and 64.1 ± 0.8 (n = 3) kDa for the Tyrp1(A)/Tyr1(B) and Tyr(A)/Tyrp1(B) chimerae, respe"

We reported previously that neutrophils stimulated with LPS induce expression of genes typically expressed in response to stimulation with antiviral type I interferons (IFN), such as myxovirus resistance-1 (MX1). However, we present evidence that this response of neutrophils to lipopolysaccharide occurs in the absence of interferon-dependent signaling. Lipopolysaccharide-stimulated neutrophils do not phosphorylate the interferon-associated transcription factors signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 and –3, and medium from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cells was unable to induceMX1 gene expression, suggesting a soluble factor is not involved. Furthermore, LPS did not alter expression of IFNAand IFNB genes. In contrast to neutrophils, LPS-stimulated human monocyte-derived macrophages induced the expression ofMX1, but IFNB was induced, and medium from LPS-stimulated monocyte-derived macrophages supported MX1induction. An inhibitor of p38 kinase blocked induction ofMX1 by lipopolysaccharide, but not IFNα, in neutrophils, and induction of MX1 was dependent on protein synthesis. LPS, but not IFNα, substantially activated p38. In contrast, the induction of MX1 by LPS in monocyte-derived macrophages was insensitive to p38 inhibition, although p38 is phosphorylated in LPS-stimulated but not IFNα-stimulated monocyte-derived macrophages. The expression of MX1 in neutrophils and monocyte-derived macrophages is mediated by TLR4 but not TLR2. The data presented here indicate that lipopolysaccharide activates novel interferon-independent signaling pathways in neutrophils and that induction of antiviral genes is a consequence of exposure of neutrophils to bacterial products.

Activation of neutrophils can occur by recognition of structural features of microbes, including the bacterial cell wall component lipopolysaccharide (LPS)1 (1Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C. Janeway C.A. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Science. 1999; 284: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (2153) Google Scholar). Exposure of neutrophils and other immune cells to LPS primes the cell to respond to secondary agonists with secretion of antimicrobial peptides and formation of superoxide. In addition, it is now recognized that neutrophils are potent synthetic cells and produce cytokines and chemokines, such as TNFα and IL-1β, which are coded for by theTNFA and IL-1β genes (2Scapini P.

Acad. Sci. 1997; 832: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Production of these immunomodulatory proteins in response to LPS is controlled at both the transcriptional and translational level. The toll-like receptor (TLR) family is implicated in the recognition of bacteria and in the activation of cellular signaling pathways important in host defense (4Muzio M. Polentarutti N. Bosisio D.

Whereas NFκB plays a pivotal role in regulating the expression of cytokine and chemokine genes, other transcriptional regulators may also be involved in signaling from TLRs. In contrast to many other cell types, transcription factor activation is poorly understood in neutrophils. LPS activates tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases in cells (16Arbibe L. Mira J.P.

Among these the MAP kinase family of serine/threonine kinases (p42/p44 MAP kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38) plays a major role in cellular activation in a variety of cell types (24Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. Essays Biochem. 1997; 32: 1-16PubMed Google Scholar, 25Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F85-F104PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ono K. Han J. Cell.

However, in neutrophils the p38 MAP kinase family is predominantly activated in response to LPS and regulates the translation of cytokines, adhesion, and migration (27Nick J.A. Avdi N.J. Gerwins P.

The role of p38 in regulation of gene expression is less well understood, although transcription factors, including activating transcription factor-2, SRF accessory protein-1, and CCAAT-enhancer binding protein-β (26Ono K. Han J. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar), are known substrates of p38. The role of p38 in activating these transcription factors in neutrophils has not been explored. However, inhibitors of p38 have little effect on the expression of cytokine genes in neutrophils (28Nick J.A. Avdi N.J. Young S.K. Lehman L.A. McDonald P.P. Frasch S.C. Billstrom M.A. Henson P.M.

The cellular response to viral infection includes the induction of genes for the type I interferons, IFNα and IFNβ, which act in an autocrine or paracrine manner to stimulate the induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) (33Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R.G. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). Induction of IFNα/β protein by virus requires the activation of the IRF family of transcriptional regulators by phosphorylation, and subsequent gene expression of IFNA and IFNB (34Mamane Y. Heylbroeck C. Genin P. Algarte M. Servant M.J. LePage C. DeLuca C. Kwon H. Lin R. Hiscott J. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 237: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 35Hiscott J. Pitha P. Genin P. Nguyen H. Heylbroeck C. Mamane Y. Algarte M. Lin R. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), through poorly understood pathways. IFNα/β binds to the cell surface IFN receptor and activates the Jak1 and Tyk2 tyrosine kinases leading to the phosphorylation of the STAT1 and STAT2 transcription factors and subsequent dimerization (33Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R.G. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). The major regulatory factor involved in IFNα/β action, ISGF3, is a complex of STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9-p48-ISGF3γ. ISGF3 binds to a conserved sequence in the 3′ region of IFN-responsive genes known as the interferon-stimulated response element. ISGs, such as MX1, are regulated primarily by transcriptional activation of this element, and the antiviral activity of IFNα/β resides in their ability to induce ISGs. Links between anti-bacterial and antiviral activity have been suggested previously. In particular, the induction of IFNβ by LPS has been well described (36Gessani S. Belardelli F. Pecorelli A. Puddu P. Baglioni C. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 2785-2789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Maehara N. Ho M. Infect. Immun. 1977; 15: 78-83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this way, antiviral gene expression is accomplished in response to bacterial infection. We recently described (32Fessler M.B. Malcolm K.C. Duncan M.W. Worthen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31291-31302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 38Malcolm K.C. Arndt P.G. Manos E.J. Jones D.A. Worthen G.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: L663-L670PubMed Google Scholar) the regulation of ISGs in LPS-treated neutrophils. Here we investigated the mechanisms by which neutrophils induce ISGs in response to LPS. LPS-stimulated neutrophils do not increaseIFNA or IFNB gene expression, secrete a soluble mediator to induce ISGs, or phosphorylate STAT proteins; in contrast, monocyte-derived macrophages increase IFNB expression, secrete a soluble ISG-inducing factor(s), and phosphorylate STAT proteins. Furthermore, the induction of ISGs by LPS in neutrophils, but not monocyte-derived macrophages, is sensitive to inhibitors of p38, and these effects are mediated by TLR4 but not TLR2. Whereas both IFN-dependent and -independent induction of ISGs by dsRNA and virus has been described (39Hayes M.P. Enterline J.C. Gerrard T.L. Zoon K.C. J.

These data suggest a potential new role of neutrophils in innate immunity by inducing an antiviral genotype and suggest that distinct pathways are activated by LPS in neutrophils and monocyte-derived macrophages.

Heat-inactivated platelet-poor plasma is a necessary source of LPS-binding protein (45Schumann R.R. Leong S.R. Flaggs G.W. Gray P.W. Wright S.D. Mathison J.C. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J.

Cells were treated with the indicated concentration of LPS, IFNα/D, and PGN and rotated continuously at 37 °C for up to 4 h. In some experiments, cell supernatants were retained for conditioned media experiments or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (see below). Human monocyte derived macrophages were prepared by the method of Fadoket al. (46Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Konowal A. Freed P.W. Westcott J.Y. Henson P.M. J. Clin.

Briefly, peripheral monocytic cells from healthy human volunteers were washed in Hanks' balanced salt solution with calcium and magnesium, and 12 × 106 cells in X-vivo medium (BioWhittaker) per well were seeded in 6-well plates. One hour after plating, non-adherent cells were removed by washing, and adherent cells were grown in X-vivo, 10% heat-inactivated human serum. The medium was changed every 3 days thereafter, and experiments were performed 7 or 8 days after plating. RAW264.7 cells, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, were cultured as described (47Xiao Y.Q. Malcolm K. Worthen G.S. Gardai S. Schiemann W.P. Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Henson P.M. J.

Preparation of total RNA (5 μg) for analysis by oligonucleotide array (Affymetrix) was performed as described (32Fessler M.B. Malcolm K.C. Duncan M.W. Worthen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31291-31302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Data were analyzed using Affymetrix GeneChip software. Time courses from three donors were analyzed. cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription using 2 μg of total RNA, derived from 20 × 106 neutrophils, or 0.5–2 μg of RNA from monocyte-derived macrophages and treated as indicated. PCRs were performed using specific primers for MX1, PKR,TNFA, IFNA (48Marie I. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6660-6669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), IFNB, andGAPDH. Murine-specific primers were used in experiments with RAW264.7 cells. Secretion of IFNα and IFNβ was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits as directed by the manufacturer (R & D Systems). Supernatants were isolated from neutrophils or monocyte-derived macrophages stimulated for 4 h with 100 ng/ml LPS (LPS-CM) or non-stimulated cells (NS-CM). Naive neutrophils (20 × 106) were suspended in 250 μl of neutrophil medium and 750 μl of NS-CM or LPS-CM supplemented with 10 μg/ml polymyxin B. Monocyte-derived macrophages were stimulated for 4 h with NS-CM or LPS-CM supplemented with 10 μg/ml polymyxin B, and 1.5 ml was added per well of naive monocyte-derived macrophages cultured in a 6-well plate. Cells were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C; neutrophils were rotated continuously. RT-PCR was performed as described above. Neutrophils (20 × 106) were stimulated for the indicated time, washed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and resuspended in 400 μl of 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 10 mm β-glycerol phosphate, and 200 μm sodium orthovanadate. After incubation on ice for 5 min, cell suspensions were sonicated using a Braun-Sonic 200 sonicator twice for 10 s, extracted with 400 mm NaCl for 20 min at 4 °C, and clarified by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Monocyte-derived macrophages were treated as indicated, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in SDS sample buffer. Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with the indicated antibody. Whole cell extracts from stimulated cells (250 μl or 400–500 μg from 20 × 106 cells) were supplemented with 750 μl of 1% Triton X-100 in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, incubated on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged for an additional 10 min. The supernatants from this spin were incubated with anti-p38 for 1 h, and protein A-Sepharose was added for an additional 30 min. The beads were washed, and kinase activity was determined at 30 °C in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μm[γ-32P]ATP (4 μCi/assay), 2 μg of GST-ATF-2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Reactions were stopped after 20 min by addition of 2× SDS sample buffer. Phosphorylation of ATF-2 was visualized after SDS-PAGE on a STORM 860 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences), and quantification was performed using ImageQuant (Amersham Biosciences). We recently demonstrated changes in gene expression in human neutrophils treated with LPS for 4 h using oligonucleotide (32Fessler M.B. Malcolm K.C. Duncan M.W. Worthen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31291-31302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and cDNA (38Malcolm K.C. Arndt P.G. Manos E.J. Jones D.A. Worthen G.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: L663-L670PubMed Google Scholar) microarray analysis. Unexpectedly, increases of genes were observed that in other systems are associated with activation by the type I interferons, IFNα or IFNβ (49Der S.D. Zhou A. Williams B.R.G. Silverman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15623-15628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar). Further analysis of the time course of expression levels of these ISGs by oligonucleotide array indicated that LPS-induced ISG induction occurred after a prolonged lag (Fig.1 A). Little ISG induction was observed until 4 h of LPS stimulation; examples of the expression of three such genes are shown in Fig. 1 A. In contrast, expression of TNFA and IL-1β, NFκB-regulated genes for proinflammatory cytokines known to be expressed in LPS-stimulated neutrophils, increased rapidly and was sustained for 4 h (Fig. 1 B). Expression levels of two ISGs, MX1 and PKR, and those of TNFA and GAPDH were confirmed by RT-PCR (Fig. 1 C). Induction of MX1 and PKRparalleled the level of expression determined by oligonucleotide array, with little expression after 2 h but clearly induced 4 h after LPS. In contrast, TNFA expression was evident as early as 30 min after LPS exposure and was maintained at an elevated level throughout the 4 h of LPS stimulation (Fig. 1 C). The expression of MX1 and TNFA was dose-dependent and observed at LPS concentrations as low as 1 ng/ml (Fig. 1 D). Levels of the ISG MX1 induced by LPS were similar to those induced by IFNα (Fig. 1 D), a known inducer of MX1, yet IFNα caused little enhancement of TNFA levels (Fig. 1 D). Furthermore, the induction of MX1 by LPS was blocked by pretreatment with polymyxin B, an inhibitor of LPS signaling (data not shown). Several early reports demonstrated the production of type I interferons by LPS-stimulated cells (36Gessani S. Belardelli F. Pecorelli A. Puddu P. Baglioni C. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 2785-2789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Maehara N. Ho M. Infect. Immun. 1977; 15: 78-83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a response that may depend on TLR4 (50Toshchakov V. Jones B.W. Perera P.Y. Thomas K. Cody M.J. Zhang S. Williams B.R. Major J. Hamilton T.A. Fenton M.J. Vogel S.N. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). To our knowledge LPS is known to stimulate ISGs only through the induction of type I interferons. Therefore, we explored the possibility that LPS induced IFNA or IFNB in neutrophils. In resting neutrophils, RT-PCR analysis indicated a low level ofIFNA and nearly undetectable levels of IFNB (Fig.2 A). After a 4-h exposure to LPS, neutrophils failed to change the transcript level of either cytokine (Fig. 2 A). Furthermore, several IFNAspecies, IFNB and IFNW, were absent from neutrophils and unchanged by LPS by gene expression analysis (data not shown). Cells responded normally with the induction of MX1and TNFA. Although the expression of IFNα/β protein is tightly regulated by IFN gene expression, the possibility exists that neutrophils release preformed IFN protein upon stimulation by LPS. However, IFNα and IFNβ were not detected in the supernatants of resting and LPS-stimulated neutrophils (data not shown). Together, these data indicate that induction of ISGs in LPS-stimulated neutrophils is independent of the transcription and production of type I interferons. Although the data above indicate that type I interferons are not produced in LPS-treated neutrophils, the finding that LPS stimulation of neutrophils induces IFN-regulated genes suggested that IFN-stimulated signaling pathways are activated. The interferon-independent induction of ISG56 by dsRNA is regulated in part by STAT1α (51Bandyopadhyay S.K. Leonard Jr., G.T. Bandyopadhyay T. Stark G.R. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19624-19629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). IFNα/β activate the STAT family of transcriptional regulators by Jak1/Tyk2-mediated phosphorylation of STATs on tyrosine (36Gessani S. Belardelli F. Pecorelli A. Puddu P. Baglioni C. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 2785-2789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Maehara N. Ho M. Infect. Immun. 1977; 15: 78-83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts were probed for STAT1, STAT3, and tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT3. STAT1α (p90) and STAT3α (p92) were the predominant species detected in neutrophils. Exposure of neutrophils to LPS for 30 min and 4 h did not increase the level of phospho-STAT1 isoforms or phospho-STAT3 isoforms (Fig.2 B). Exposure of neutrophils to LPS for 30 min was consistently observed to decrease the basal phosphorylation level of both STAT proteins. In contrast, IFNα stimulation of cells led to a robust, time-dependent phosphorylation of both STAT proteins (Fig. 2 B). Stimulation of neutrophils with IFNα, but not LPS, for 4 h resulted in the loss of STAT1 but not STAT3. Because chemokines can activate STAT proteins (52Mellado M. Vila-Coro A.J. Martinez C. Rodriguez-Frade J.M. Cell. Mol. Biol. embo. 2001; 47: 575-582Google Scholar), we investigated if LPS stimulated the release of a non-interferon factor in neutrophils that mediates ISG induction. Our expression profile data and the data of others (53Grenier A. Dehoux M. Boutten A. Arce-Vicioso M. Durand G. Gougerot-Pocidalo M.A. Chollet-Martin S. Blood. 1999; 93: 1413-1421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown) indicated that LPS regulates expression of mRNA for oncostatin M. This gp130-activating ligand, associated with activation of Jak/STAT pathways, is also released from already synthesized pools (53Grenier A. Dehoux M. Boutten A. Arce-Vicioso M. Durand G. Gougerot-Pocidalo M.A. Chollet-Martin S. Blood. 1999; 93: 1413-1421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, recombinant human oncostatin M failed to induce MX1 (data not shown). To investigate further the possibility that released factors were responsible for MX1induction, cell-free supernatants from unstimulated and LPS-stimulated neutrophils were added to naive neutrophils for 4 h, and expression of MX1, TNFA, and GAPDH was measured by RT-PCR. Conditioned medium from LPS-stimulated neutrophils induced TNFA message but not that of MX1 (Fig.2 C). We have not characterized further theTNFA-inducing factor released from LPS-stimulated neutrophils. Therefore, although conditioned medium from LPS-stimulated neutrophils is biologically active, it does not contain an ISG-inducing substance. These data indicate that LPS is able to induceMX1 message, but in contrast to other cells types paracrine factors are not sufficient for induction of MX1. In macrophages, IFNβ production by LPS mediates ISG induction (36Gessani S. Belardelli F. Pecorelli A. Puddu P. Baglioni C. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 2785-2789Crossref PubMed Goog"

These results suggest that the GPVI intracellular domain might play an important role in GPVI signaling, an idea recently confirmed by the identification of an interaction between the Src family kinase Lyn and the GPVI intracellular domain (19Suzuki-Inoue K. Tulasne D. Shen Y. Bori-Sanz T. Inoue O. Jung S.M. Moroi M. Andrews R.K. Berndt M.C. Watson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21561-21566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies have also shown that the GPVI intracellular domain interacts with calmodulin (20Andrews R.K. Suzuki-Inoue K. Shen Y. Tulasne D. Watson S.P. Berndt M.C. Blood. 2002; 99: 4219-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The functional importance of these interactions for signal transduction by GPVI, however, is unknown. To further investigate the role of the GPVI intracellular domain during signal transduction we have stably expressed a series of receptor truncation mutants and amino acid substitution mutants in RBL-2H3 cells to analyze receptor signaling and protein-protein interactions. These studies identify two critical functional domains within the GPVI intracellular tail, a highly basic region that mediates interaction with calmodulin and a proline-rich region that mediates interaction with Src family kinases. Interruption of either one of these domains significantly impairs GPVI signaling despite normal association with Fc Rγ. In addition, the function of these domains appeared autonomous,i.e. loss of calmodulin binding, Lyn association or Fc Rγ coupling had little effect on GPVI association with the other two interacting proteins. Our results reveal an important independent role for the GPVI intracellular tail in the regulation of receptor signaling and suggest that the ligand-binding subunit of this receptor functions as an adaptor to bind downstream signaling proteins. The extent to which the intracellular domains of similar multisubunit receptors also function to modulate receptor signaling in an adaptor-like fashion remains to be investigated.

The beads were loaded into a disposable 0.7 × 10-cm column and washed with 2% nonanoylN-methylglucamide buffer containing high (300 mm) and low (100 mm) salt to remove proteins associated with GPVI or CVX through ionic interaction. GPVI was eluted from CVX beads using a solution of 0.10% w/v SurfectAmps SDS (Pierce-Endogen), 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Aliquots of the elution fractions were checked for protein by gold staining and for GPVI using HY101 and/or anti-FLAG. Selected fractions were concentrated (Amicon 30; Amicon, Beverly, MA) for electrophoresis (8% gel, non-reducing conditions). Preparative recovery of GPVI was achieved using a model 422 electroeluter according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The purified protein was lyophilized, weighed, and re-hydrated in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% nonanoylN-methylglucamide. For gold staining membranes were washed 3× for 10 min in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% Tween and then developed using membragold (Bioworld, Dublin, OH) Emission spectra were obtained at 25 °C using a Varian Cary Eclipse Fluorescence spectrophotometer with well-plate attachment (Varian, Walnut Creek, CA). Measurements were taken at an excitation wavelength of 295 nm (5-nm slit) and with scanning emission (1.5-nm slit) under various experimental conditions. Buffer conditions were kept constant at 10 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and 0.1% nonanoylN-methylglucamide. For all assays 10 μmpurified GPVI was incubated with increasing concentrations of bovine brain calmodulin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as outlined in the text. Magnesium, calcium, or EDTA was added to their final concentrations from stock. The final volume was kept constant at 200 μl. Each data point was determined by two individual measurements and was plotted as the fraction of a maximum emission shift. Data were transformed from fluorescence titration experiments and values calculated by linear regression (SigmaPlot 2002). Determination ofKD for the association was obtained from transforming Equation 1,KD=(1−f)([calmodulin]−f[6PVI])/fEq. 1 into Equation 2,log(f/1−f)=log([calmodulin]−f[6PVI])−logKDEq. 2 where f is the fraction of the maximal emission change and [X] is the protein concentration. Data were fit using a one and two site Hill plot for the determination of the dissociation constant (KD) and coefficient of binding (slope). The two-site model was more appropriate for the data as judged by the fitting coefficients and the residuals between the experimental and expected values. Adherent cells were detached from culture plates using 5 mm EDTA and resuspended in RHB medium (RPMI 1640 medium containing 25 mm HEPES and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) at 2 × 107 cells/ml. Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Inc.) was added to 4 μg/ml, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Excess Fura-2/AM was removed by washing in RHB medium. Fluorescence was measured using an Aminco-Bowman Series-2 luminescence spectrometer (SLM-Aminco, Urbana, IL). Fluorescence was measured at 340 and 380 nm for excitation and at 510 nm for emission. Cells (2 × 106) were stirred continuously during the fluorescence recording. The data were recorded as the relative ratio of fluorescence excited at 340/380 nm and the concentration of mobilized calcium using a dissociation constant of 224 nmol/liter for Fura-2/Ca2+. RBL-2H3 cells were lysed for 2 h at 4 °C in ice-cold lysis buffer (1% w/v digitonin (Calbiochem), 0.12% v/v SurfectAmps Triton X-100 (Pierce-Endogen), 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% w/v sodium azide, 20 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.8). Detergent-insoluble cellular debris was pelleted at 10,000 ×gav for 15 min, and CVX-Sepharose beads were used to immunoprecipitate GPVI and associated proteins from the supernatant in another 2-h incubation period. For live cell immunoprecipitations, HY101 was used to saturate the extracellular domain of GPVI prior to lysis and recovered from cell lysate using protein A-protein G beads (Amersham Biosciences). Of note, binding of HY101 to GPVI is non-activating and does not compete with or block subsequent CVX binding to the receptor (16Chen H. Locke D. Liu Y. Liu C. Kahn M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3011-3019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times in ice-cold washing buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, 5 mmCHAPS). Finally, beads were heated to 100 °C in an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer (1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.2m dithiothreitol, 4% w/v SDS, 0.004% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol), and run on 5–20% v/v gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels using a standard electrophoresis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 0.25 m glycine, and 0.1% w/v SDS). A crude membrane pellet was obtained from RBL 2H3 GPVI cells by Dounce homogenization (∼30 times on ice) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mmEGTA, containing protease inhibitors. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1500 × gav for 10 min at 4 °C and the supernatant stored on ice. The pellet was resuspended in half the original volume of homogenization buffer supplemented with 5 mm magnesium chloride, pH 8.0 and disrupted by Dounce homogenization. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1500 ×gav for 10 min at 4 °C. The pooled supernatants were centrifuged at 109,000 ×gav for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet resuspended to a protein concentration of ∼10 mg/ml in 250 mm sucrose, 50 mm potassium chloride, 0.1 mm calcium chloride, 20 mmMOPS-Tris, pH 7.2. Affinity chromatography of cell membrane lysates on calmodulin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was performed using a method described by Klaerke et al. (23Klaerke D.A. Rojkjaer R. Christensen L. Schousboe I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1339: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). CHAPS was added to the crude membrane preparation from a 0.5 m stock to a detergent protein ratio of 5:1 (w/w). After 60 min the unsolubilized protein was removed by centrifugation. Sepharose-calmodulin beads, which had been equilibrated with 50 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 1 μm magnesium chloride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm CHAPS, were added to the supernatent to 30% (v/v). Beads-lysate were supplemented with 1 mm calcium chloride and incubated at 30 °C for 120 min. The beads were loaded into a disposable 0.7 × 10-cm column, washed in 10 mm CHAPS buffer containing calcium and 200 mm sodium chloride, and proteins eluted from the beads by 10 mm EDTA. Elution fractions were analyzed for GPVI by Western blotting. A theoretical calmodulin-binding region in GPVI was identified by screening for a basic amphipathic sequence between the transmembrane and cytoplasmic receptor domains. A 14 amino acid sequence between amino acids Trp-292 and Val-306 shares homology to classical calmodulin-binding motifs and to the recently identified calmodulin-binding site on glycoprotein Ibβ (GPIbβ, Fig.1). As for GPIbβ, helical wheel projection of the membrane-proximal region of the GPVI C-tail suggested that these charged residues might be arranged along a single face of a helix in a manner similar to that recently reported for GPIbβ (Fig. 1and Ref. 24Andrews R.K. Munday A.D. Mitchell C.A. Berndt M.C. Blood. 2001; 98: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Previous studies using purified peptides corresponding to this region of GPVI (His-293–Pro-311, amino acid numbering from the start methionine of the immature protein) have also suggested that GPVI may interact with bovine calmodulin, an observation confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of these two proteins (20Andrews R.K. Suzuki-Inoue K. Shen Y. Tulasne D. Watson S.P. Berndt M.C. Blood. 2002; 99: 4219-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To more precisely define the interaction between GPVI and calmodulin we measured the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of GPVI before and after addition of calmodulin. Because calmodulin has no tryptophan residues, this technique provides information about the environment surrounding tryptophan residues of calmodulin-binding proteins. Affinity chromatography of GPVI-expressing RBL-2H3 cell lysates on CVX-Sepharose yielded a major protein component identified by Western blotting as GPVI, migrating at 66 kDa under reducing conditions (Fig.2a). Minor protein components were removed by extensive salt washing and were further eliminated by non-denaturing preparative PAGE (data not shown). Purified GPVI had an emission peak at 352 nm after excitation of tryptophan at 295 nm. Calmodulin titrations were performed in the presence of calcium, magnesium, and/or EDTA. In the presence of calcium, addition of bovine calmodulin to purified GPVI resulted in a decrease on the emission maxima (a “blue shift”) to 344 nm that did not occur in the presence of EDTA or when magnesium was present in place of calcium (Fig. 2b and data not shown). Titration experiments (Fig. 2,c and d) revealed approximately molar saturation between the two proteins and a high affinity interaction between GPVI and calmodulin (KD of 35 nm). Thus calmodulin interacts with GPVI in living cells in a high affinity and specific manner. The basic amino acids within the GPVI intracellular domain are predicted to form the calmodulin-binding site if arranged in the shape of an α-helix (Fig.1). To directly test the role of these amino acids for calmodulin binding and for signal transduction by GPVI we generated GPVI mutants in which: (i) the four amino-terminal basic residues were mutated to alanines (GPVI RK1), (ii) the four carboxyl-terminal basic residues were mutated to alanines (GPVI RK2), and (iii) all eight basic amino acids were mutated to alanines (GPVI RK1/2). Significantly, all mutations of this domain were made in the context of the full-length receptor rather than in cognate peptides or through receptor truncation. Mutant receptors were expressed stably at roughly equivalent levels in RBL-2H3 cells and co-immunoprecipitation studies used to identify the residues critical for interaction with calmodulin in live cells. Mutation of either the amino-terminal or carboxyl-terminal basic amino acids alone (GPVI RK1 or GPVI RK2) did not interrupt calmodulin binding, but mutation of all eight basic amino acids (GPVI RK 1/2) abrogated the interaction of these two proteins (Fig. 3b). GPVI truncation mutants lacking residues carboxyl to these basic amino acids (A303STOP and T318STOP) or the transmembrane domain critical for Fc Rγ coupling (R272L) bound calmodulin normally, but a truncation mutant lacking the basic domain (R295STOP) did not. These results demonstrate that the basic amino acids between Trp-292 and Val-306 in the GPVI intracellular domain mediate calmodulin interaction and that calmodulin interaction is independent of either Fc Rγ or Lyn association (discussed further below). To determine the role played by calmodulin during GPVI signaling we analyzed calmodulin-GPVI interaction before and after receptor stimulation with CVX, a high affinity GPVI ligand that activates strong calcium signaling in GPVI-expressing but not wild-type RBL-2H3 cells (14Zheng Y.M. Liu C. Chen H. Locke D. Ryan J.C. Kahn M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12999-13006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In resting cells, calmodulin could be co-immunoprecipitated with GPVI (Fig. 3, b and d). Following stimulation of GPVI with CVX, however, calmodulin was released from GPVI within 30–60 s (Fig. 3, b and c). As seen in Fig.3b, calmodulin could be easily co-immunoprecipitated with GPVI from resting cell lysate when using HY101, a non-clustering anti-GPVI antibody (16Chen H. Locke D. Liu Y. Liu C. Kahn M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3011-3019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). When GPVI was precipitated using the clustering ligand CVX, however, very little calmodulin was co-precipitated. These results suggest that calmodulin associates with GPVI in resting cells and calmodulin-GPVI interaction is regulated by receptor-ligand interaction in a manner that may be independent of downstream GPVI signaling. Although the interaction of calmodulin with several platelet receptors has recently been identified, the role of calmodulin during signal transduction by platelet receptors remains unknown. To detect a role for calmodulin in GPVI signal transduction we examined the calcium signals stimulated by the high affinity GPVI ligand CVX in cells expressing wild-type GPVI (hGPVI), GPVI lacking one-half the basic residues of the calmodulin-binding domain (GPVI RK1 and GPVI RK2) and GPVI lacking all basic residues in the calmodulin-binding domain and unable to bind calmodulin (GPVI RK1/2). As previously observed, expression of GPVI in RBL-2H3 cells conferred robust calcium signaling in response to CVX (Fig. 4 and Ref. 14Zheng Y.M. Liu C. Chen H. Locke D. Ryan J.C. Kahn M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12999-13006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). GPVI receptors lacking only half the basic residues of the calmodulin-binding domain but still able to bind calmodulin demonstrated wild-type calcium responses to CVX with the exception of a lag in the time required to initiate calcium signaling for the GPVI RK2 mutant receptor (Fig. 4). GPVI receptors unable to bind calmodulin, however, demonstrated severely reduced calcium responses to CVX despite a receptor surface expression equivalent to that of wild-type GPVI (Fig.4). These results suggest that the GPVI receptor domain required for interaction of calmodulin with GPVI is also required for normal receptor signaling. Previous studies have revealed an unexpected role for the intracellular GPVI C-tail in mediating association of GPVI with Fc Rγ (14Zheng Y.M. Liu C. Chen H. Locke D. Ryan J.C. Kahn M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12999-13006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 15Berlanga O. Tulasne D. Bori T. Snell D.C. Miura Y. Jung S. Moroi M. Frampton J. Watson S.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2951-2960Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that the loss of signaling observed in GPVI RK1/2-expressing RBL-2H3 cells might be caused by loss of Fc Rγ association rather than loss of a specific function mediated by the calmodulin-binding domain of GPVI. To test this possibility we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays to compare the ability of wild-type GPVI (WT GPVI) and the GPVI RK mutants to associate with Fc Rγ in RBL-2H3 cells. As expected, Fc Rγ co-precipitated with wild-type GPVI but not with the GPVI R272L mutant in which a transmembrane arginine critical for Fc Rγ association is mutated (Fig. 5). Significantly, Fc Rγ was also co-precipitated with all the RK mutants, including the GPVI receptor lacking all of the basic amino acids (GPVI RK1/2) required for calmodulin interaction. Similarly co-immunoprecipitation studies also demonstrated preserved interaction with the Src family kinase Lyn (Fig.5). These results suggest that the loss of GPVI signaling associated with loss of the calmodulin-binding domain is not merely the result of loss of Fc Rγ or Lyn association and that interaction with calmodulin or an unidentified protein may"

We used electrophysiological and tracer uptake methods to examine the effect of valproate on a γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter (mouse GAT3) expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. In the absence of GABA, valproate (up to 50 mm) had no noticeable effect on the steady-state electrogenic properties of mGAT3. In the presence of GABA, however, valproate enhanced the GABA-evoked steady-state inward current in a dose-dependent manner with a half-maximal concentration of 4.6 ± 0.5 mm. Maximal enhancement of the GABA-evoked current was 275 ± 10%. Qualitatively similar observations were obtained for human GAT1 and mouse GAT4. The valproate enhancement did not alter the Na+or Cl− dependence of the steady-state GABA-evoked currents. Uptake experiments under voltage clamp suggested that the valproate enhancement of the GABA-evoked current was matched by an enhancement in GABA uptake. Thus, despite the increase in GABA-evoked current, ion/GABA co-transport remained tightly coupled. Uptake experiments indicated that valproate is not transported by mouse GAT3 in the absence or presence of GABA. Valproate also enhanced the rate of the partial steps involved in transporter presteady-state charge movements. We propose that valproate increases the turnover rate of GABA transporters by an allosteric mechanism. The data suggest that at its therapeutic concentration, valproate may enhance the activity of neuronal and glial GABA transporters by up to 10%.

Thus, the GABA transporters regulate synaptic and extra-synaptic concentrations of GABA and, in this capacity, are partly responsible for the regulation of inhibitory neurotransmission in the nervous system. Because of the inhibitory role of GABA, potentiation of GABAergic neurotransmission via inhibition or reversal of the GABA transporters is believed to have therapeutic value in treating epileptic seizures and stroke (11Löscher W. Prog. Neurobiol. 1999; 58: 31-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 12Roettger V.R. Amara S.G. Adv. Neurol. 1999; 79: 551-560PubMed Google Scholar, 13Green A.R. Hainsworth A.H. Jackson D.M. Neuropharmacology. 2000; 39: 1483-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Indeed, inhibitors of the GABA transporters are known to increase GABA levels in the brain (14Fink-Jensen A.

Several other clinically used antiepileptic drugs are reported to act, at least in part, via potentiating GABA-mediated inhibition in the brain (11Löscher W. Prog. Neurobiol. 1999; 58: 31-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 23Kwan P. Sills G.J. Brodie M.J. Pharmacol. Ther. 2001; 90: 21-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar); however, little is known regarding the potential effect of these drugs on the GABA transporters (24Eckstein-Ludwig U. Fei J. Schwarz W. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 92-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).Valproate (2-propylpentanoate) has been in clinical use since 1967 and is effective against many types of epileptic seizures (both partial and generalized seizures). Although the exact mechanism of valproate action is not clear, its effectiveness as a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant is usually attributed to a combination of actions at multiple molecular targets (11Löscher W. Prog. Neurobiol. 1999; 58: 31-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 25Johannessen C.U. Neurochem Int. 2000; 37: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). A preponderance of evidence suggests that valproate potentiates GABAergic neurotransmission by increasing GABA levels in the brain (11Löscher W. Prog.

The effect may be attributed both to enhanced GABA synthesis (stimulation of glutamic acid decarboxylase) and decreased GABA degradation (inhibition of GABA trans-aminase and succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase) (11Löscher W. Prog. Neurobiol. 1999; 58: 31-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 33van der Laan J.W. de Boer T. Bruinvels J. J.

Correspondingly, many studies have examined valproate-induced GABA release from neurons and glia, although vesicular versus non-vesicular (i.e. transporter-mediated) release mechanisms have not been definitively addressed. These studies as well as those examining the effect of valproate on GABA uptake by neurons and/or glial cells have not provided entirely consistent results; however, the available evidence favors valproate-induced GABA release from nerve terminals in selected brain regions (e.g. 31, 32, 36–47; for review see Refs. 11Löscher W. Prog. Neurobiol. 1999; 58: 31-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar and 25Johannessen C.U. Neurochem Int. 2000; 37: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In light of this evidence, it is of interest to characterize the effect of valproate on the GABA transporters expressed in an expression system where any putative interaction may be examined by using sensitive biophysical tools.Here, we have combined electrophysiological and tracer uptake methods to examine the effect of valproate on the GABA transporters expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Our results suggest that valproate enhances the turnover rate of these transport proteins via an allosteric mechanism. The interaction of valproate with GATs opens new experimental avenues for probing the mechanism of Na+/Cl−/GABA co-transport.DISCUSSIONWe propose that valproate leads to an increase in the turnover rate of GABA transporters and that the effect involves an important rate-limiting step in the transport cycle. Our data do not allow us to identify the partial step in the transport cycle that is altered by valproate; however, we have shown that valproate increases the turnover rate for the forward mode of the transporter (Fig.11A) as well as increases the rates of conformational changes of the empty carrier (presteady-state relaxations) (Fig. 11B, shaded steps). Valproate interaction with the transporter appears to be allosteric involving a site other than the GABA binding site, because valproate is not a transported substrate of GATs and valproate interaction does not compete with GABA. Indeed, valproate enhances GABA trans-location across the plasma membrane in the forward transport mode. Despite enhancement of GABA transport across the plasma membrane, the ion/GABA coupling ratio remains the same, suggesting that the transport cycle remains tightly coupled. Valproate interaction with the GABA transporters is specific as other short chain fatty acids such as butanoic acid and pentanoic acid were without effect (data not shown). Furthermore, valproate did not enhance the rate of transport for the Na+/iodide symporter, a Na+-coupled transporter with mechanistic features similar to those of the GABA transporters. Examination of transporter presteady-state kinetics suggests that valproate increases the apparent affinity of the empty transporter for Na+. The presteady-state charge movements further suggest that valproate can interact with the transporter in the absence of GABA and Cl−. However, it cannot be determined whether valproate can interact with the transporter in the absence of Na+, because no charge movements are induced by valproate in the absence of external Na+. Finally, valproate-induced enhancement is rapid and limited only by the speed of the perfusion system, and moreover, the enhancement is fully reversible.At least three observations suggest that valproate interaction with mGAT3 is not at the GABA binding site. (i) Valproate alone neither evokes an inward current nor is it itself transported across the plasma membrane alone or in the presence of GABA. (ii) Increasing concentrations of valproate enhance both the GABA-evoked current and GABA uptake, whereas interaction at the GABA binding site would be expected to lead to competitive inhibition of GABA uptake. (iii) Valproate had no effect on the maximal charge moved in response to voltage pulses (Qmax).Qmax is a measure of the total number of functional transporters available to bind substrate (56Eskandari S. Kreman M. Kavanaugh M.P. Wright E.M. Zampighi G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8641-8646Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). As transported substrates lead to a concentration-dependent reduction in Qmax (Fig. 10C) (10Sacher A. Nelson N. Ogi J.T. Wright E.M. Loo D.D.F. Eskandari S. J. Membr. Biol. 2002; 190: 57-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar,51Eskandari S. Loo D.D.F. Dai G. Levy O. Wright E.M. Carrasco N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27230-27238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), the results suggest that interaction of valproate with the GABA transporters occurs in an entirely different fashion from that of a transported substrate. Because of the moderate membrane permeability of valproate, it is not possible to know whether this drug acts at the extracellular, intracellular, or membrane-spanning region of the transporter.The effect of valproate cannot be attributed to an increase in the total number of transporters caused by vesicle trafficking to the plasma membrane. Four observations support this view. (i) The total number of transporters in the plasma membrane (as determined fromQmax) was not changed by valproate. (ii) The effect was fully reversible and repeatable in the same cell, persisting for as long as the experiment was continued. It seems unlikely that such mGAT3-containing vesicle insertion could be balanced rapidly and precisely by recruitment of mGAT3 in retrieved vesicles. (iii) The effect was specific to the GABA transporters as the transport rate for the Na+/iodide symporter was not altered. (iv) There was no change in the whole-cell capacitance in the presence of valproate. This is shown clearly in Fig. 3, A and B. We have shown previously that heterologous membrane proteins expressed in oocytes are targeted to the plasma membrane in 100-nm diameter vesicles containing 5–40 copies of the expressed protein (57Zampighi G.A. Loo D.D.F. Kreman M. Eskandari S. Wright E.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 507-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In the oocyte of Fig. 3A, the GABA-evoked current was enhanced by ≈50 nA. If it is assumed that the enhancement was because of insertion of new mGAT3 copies in the plasma membrane, it can be estimated that a total of ≈7 × 1010 transporters were newly inserted into the membrane (I = NRze, where I is current,N is the number of transporters, R is the turnover rate (2 s−1 at −60 mV; see Ref. 10Sacher A. Nelson N. Ogi J.T. Wright E.M. Loo D.D.F. Eskandari S. J. Membr. Biol. 2002; 190: 57-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar),z is the net charge trans-located across the membrane per transport cycle (2.2; see legend to Fig. 2B), ande is the elementary charge). Assuming that there were 5–40 copies of mGAT3 per vesicle, 2 × 109 to 14 × 109 vesicles would have been expected to fuse with the plasma membrane, leading to a 2–16-fold increase in the total surface area of the oocyte. Clearly, with a resolution of ≈10 nanofarads, such an increase in capacitance (260 nanofarads to at least 520 nanofarads) would have been detected (for example see Ref. 58Hirsch J.R. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14740-14746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar).A prominent effect of valproate was an increase in the rate of the presteady-state ON and OFF relaxations. Upon application of depolarizing voltage pulses, the ON transients represent the release of Na+ and Cl− followed by reorientation of the empty carrier (Fig. 11B, shaded steps). Upon return from the test voltage to the holding voltage, the OFF transients represent the return of the binding sites to the external medium, Na+ and Cl− entry into the membrane electric field, binding, and subsequent ligand-induced conformational changes (Fig. 11B) (3Mager S. Naeve J. Quick M. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Neuron. 1993; 10: 177-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 52Loo D.D.F. Hazama A. Supplisson S. Turk E. Wright E.M. Proc.

J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 491-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). As presteady-state charge movements are obtained in the absence of GABA, the data suggest that valproate also increases the rates associated with voltage-induced conformational changes of the empty carrier.Valproate also led to a small reduction in the apparent affinity for GABA. Both the half-maximal concentration for steady-state GABA-evoked inward current and the GABA concentration for 50% reduction inQmax were increased by valproate. The values increased from ≈6 μm in the absence of valproate to ≈20 μm in the presence of 10 mm valproate. Apparently, valproate reversibly transforms mGAT3 into a lower affinity, higher capacity transporter. Interestingly, valproate was also reported to decrease the GABA affinity of the astroglial GABA uptake system (44Nilsson M. Hansson E. Rönnbäck L. Neurochem. Res. 1992; 17: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), although maximal transport rates were not altered.At saturating Na+ and Cl− concentrations, valproate did not alter the maximal charge moved in response to voltage pulses (see Figs. 7, 8, and 10), suggesting that valproate entry/exit into/out of the membrane electric field does not contribute to presteady-state charge movements. Valproate did not alter the apparent valence of the moveable charge (zδ), suggesting that the same number of charges moved the same distance within the membrane electric field in the absence or presence of valproate. Valproate led to a decrease in the half-maximal concentration for Na+activation (43 versus 22 mm) of the charge movements but had no effect on the half-maximal concentrations for Cl− enhancement (15 mm) of the charge movements. Therefore, the results suggest that valproate increases the apparent affinity of the empty transporter for Na+. Thus, by increasing the affinity of the empty carrier for Na+, significantly more charge can be moved at lower Na+ and Cl− concentrations. This effect may contribute to the enhancement of transporter turnover rate induced by valproate. In contrast, valproate does not alter the apparent Na+affinity of the GABA-loaded transporter (see Fig. 5A). As the presteady-state transitions (Fig. 11B, shaded steps) represent only a subset of those of the entire transport cycle (Fig. 11A), the data suggest that the effect of valproate is complex and may also involve partial steps other than those responsible for the voltage-induced presteady-state transitions. The data do not allow us to specify the steps altered by valproate.Our results are in contrast to those obtained by Eckstein-Ludwiget al. (24Eckstein-Ludwig U. Fei J. Schwarz W. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 92-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) who report the inhibition of mouse GAT1-mediated GABA uptake by valproate, although it was also reported that valproate did not alter the steady-state or presteady-state currents of mouse GAT1. The authors propose a valproate-induced dissociation of GABA uptake and GABA-induced currents. We were unable to observe such effects under our experimental conditions. Indeed, we have provided direct demonstration of tight coupling between GABA uptake and steady-state GABA-induced currents in the absence and presence of valproate. Differences in the GAT isoform and/or valproate concentration used may be responsible for the observed discrepancy between our results and those of Eckstein-Ludwig et al.(24Eckstein-Ludwig U. Fei J. Schwarz W. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 92-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).In humans, the therapeutic concentration of valproate in the plasma ranges from 0.28 to 0.69 mm (11Löscher W. Prog. Neurobiol. 1999; 58: 31-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Because of valproate breakdown to metabolic byproducts as well as carrier-mediated efflux from the brain, valproate concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid is a fraction of that in plasma and ranges from 0.042 to 0.19 mm(11Löscher W. Prog. Neurobiol. 1999; 58: 31-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The half-maximal concentration for valproate enhancement of the GAT turnover rate is ≈4.5 mm, and maximal enhancement is ≈275%. Therefore, we predict that at therapeutic levels of valproate, the activity of the GABA transporters may be enhanced by up to 10%. Valproate has been shown to lead to a 15–40% elevation of GABA levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (25Johannessen C.U. Neurochem Int. 2000; 37: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Although our data do not allow us to speculate on the role played by the GABA transporters, at least in principle, it is possible that valproate enhancement of the GABA transporters may contribute to the observed elevation of GABA levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. By stimulating GABA synthesis and inhibiting GABA degradation, valproate increases the nerve ending GABA pool (36Iadarola M.J. Gale K. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1979; 59: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 41Löscher W. Vetter M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1985; 34: 1747-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), which may favor GABA release via the reversal of the GABA transporters (8Lu C.-C. Hilgemann D.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 429-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Therefore, valproate enhancement of the GABA transporter turnover rate may add to its effectiveness in facilitating GABA release from cells, leading to GABA potentiation in the brain. These findings add support to the notion that the effectiveness of valproate as an anticonvulsant results from its combined action at multiple molecular targets in the brain.CONCLUSIONSince its fortuitous discovery as an anticonvulsant in 1962, valproate has become one of the most widely used drugs of its class, perhaps because of its wide spectrum of anticonvulsant activity against different types of seizures. The wide spectrum of activity most certainly arises from diverse molecular actions. Here, we have presented data for an additional role of valproate in the central nervous system, the enhancement of the turnover rate of the GABA transporters. We predict that at therapeutic concentrations, valproate may enhance the activity of neuronal and glial GABA transporters by up to 10%. γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA)1 is the most abundant inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. Transport of GABA into cells is accomplished by Na+-dependent and Cl−-facilitated GABA transporters (GATs) found in the plasma membrane of neurons and glia (1Kavanaugh M.P. Arriza J.L. North R.A.

Thus, the GABA transporters regulate synaptic and extra-synaptic concentrations of GABA and, in this capacity, are partly responsible for the regulation of inhibitory neurotransmission in the nervous system. Because of the inhibitory role of GABA, potentiation of GABAergic neurotransmission via inhibition or reversal of the GABA transporters is believed to have therapeutic value in treating epileptic seizures and stroke (11Löscher W. Prog. Neurobiol. 1999; 58: 31-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 12Roettger V.R. Amara S.G. Adv. Neurol. 1999; 79: 551-560PubMed Google Scholar, 13Green A.R. Hainsworth A.H. Jackson D.M. Neuropharmacology. 2000; 39: 1483-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Indeed, inhibitors of the GABA transporters are known to increase GABA levels in the brain (14Fink-Jensen A.

Epilepsia. 1997; 38: 966-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Several other clinically used antiepileptic drugs are reported to act, at least in part, via potentiating GABA-mediated inhibition in the brain (11Löscher W. Prog. Neurobiol. 1999; 58: 31-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 23Kwan P. Sills G.J. Brodie M.J. Pharmacol. Ther. 2001; 90: 21-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar); however, little is known regarding the potential effect of these drugs on the GABA transporters (24Eckstein-Ludwig U. Fei J. Schwarz W. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 92-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Valproate (2-propylpentanoate) has been in clinical use since 1967 and is effective against many types of epileptic seizures (both partial and generalized seizures). Although the exact mechanism of valproate action is not clear, its effectiveness as a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant is usually attributed to a combination of actions at multiple molecular targets (11Löscher W. Prog. Neurobiol. 1999; 58: 31-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 25Johannessen C.U. Neurochem Int. 2000; 37: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). A preponderance of evidence suggests that valproate potentiates GABAergic neurotransmission by increasing GABA levels in the brain (11Löscher W. Prog.

The likelihood of trapping metaphosphate in the active site of an enzyme is remote, because of the proximity of acceptor molecules in the active site. Yet an enzyme offers an advantage in that it reduces the free energy of the transition state. Hence, the active site itself could serve as a thermodynamic trap if metaphosphate, once generated, is denied access to an acceptor. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (d-fructose-1,6-bisphosphate 1-phosphohydrolase, EC3.1.3.11, hereafter FBPase)1is a key regulatory enzyme in gluconeogenesis. FBPase catalyzes the hydrolysis of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (F16P2) to fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) and orthophosphate (Pi). The inhibition of FBPase in mammals results in reduced levels of serum glucose in the fasting state. Hence, FBPase is a target for the development of drugs in the treatment of non-insulin dependent diabetes, which afflicts over 15 million people in the United States (16Wright S.W. Carlo A.A.

Divalent metals (Mg2+, Mn2+, or Zn2+) are essential for FBPase activity.

Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1982; 53: 45-82PubMed Google Scholar, 24Tejwani G.A. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1983; 54: 121-194PubMed Google Scholar, 25Zhang R. Villeret V. Lipscomb W.N. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3038-3043Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The enzyme-mediated reaction is pH-dependent; plots of initial velocity versusMg2+ are sigmoidal (Hill coefficient of 2) at neutral pH, but hyperbolic at pH 9.6 (26Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7401-7406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetic mechanism at pH 7 with Mg2+ as the cation activator is steady-state random (25Zhang R. Villeret V. Lipscomb W.N. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3038-3043Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), whereas at pH 9.6 the kinetic mechanism is rapid-equilibrium random (26Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7401-7406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic mechanism is also sensitive to the type of cation activator: The Mn2+-activated enzyme uses exclusively the α-anomer of F16P2 (27Frey W.A. Fishbein R. de Maine M.M. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2479-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), but Mg2+-activated FBPase uses both α- and β-anomers of F16P2 (23Benkovic S.J. de Maine M.M. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1982; 53: 45-82PubMed Google Scholar). Mn2+-activated FBPase, but not the Mg2+-activated enzyme, hydrolyzes the substrate analogue (Sp)-[1-18O]fructose 1-phosphothioate 6-phosphate (28Domanico P.L. Rahil J.F. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1623-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The zinc cation is an activator of FBPase, and yet traces of Zn2+ reduce catalytic rates of the Mg2+-activated enzyme (24Tejwani G.A. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1983; 54: 121-194PubMed Google Scholar). The above suggests alternative catalytic pathways, the dominant mechanism being determined by pH, the kind of cation-activator, and the conformation of the substrate. FBPase crystallizes readily from an equilibrium mixture of products and substrates, and in fact the enzyme itself is active under conditions of crystallization. In past crystal structures of FBPase, only orthophosphate and F6P have appeared in the active site (29Choe J-Y. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8565-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 30Choe J-Y. Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11441-11450Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Presumably, the observed complexes represent a minimum free energy under the conditions of the crystallization experiment. Reported here are crystal structures of FBPase at near atomic resolution, in which a partial reaction (essentially the second step of a dissociative pathway) has lead to the formation of metaphosphate in the active site. The crystallographic structures do not constitute irrefutable evidence of a dissociative reaction pathway, but they do demonstrate that FBPase can generate and stabilize metaphosphate at its active site. Hence, variations observed in the mechanism of catalysis by FBPase may arise from changes in the rate-limiting step of a dissociative pathway or even a change in pathway, for instance, from associative to dissociative. FBPase was isolated as described previously (29Choe J-Y. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8565-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 30Choe J-Y. Poland B.W. Fromm H.J.

Crystals in 10 or 200 mmK+ grew (by the method of hanging drops) from equal parts of a protein solution (10 mg/ml FBPase, 50 mm Hepes, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm F16P2, 10 mm or 200 mm KCl) and a precipitant solution (100 mm Hepes pH 7, 5% t-butyl alcohol, 27 or 21% (v/v) of glycerol, and 8% (for 10 mm KCl) or 14% (for 200 mm KCl) (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350). Crystals at pH 9.6 grew from equal parts of a protein solution (10 mg/ml FBPase, 10 mm KPi, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm F16P2), and a precipitant solution (100 mm glycine, pH 9.6, 5% t-butyl alcohol, 25% (v/v) glycerol, and 10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350). The droplet volume was 4 μl. Wells contained 500 μl of the precipitant solution. Crystals of uniform dimension (0.2 mm) grew in three to 5 days at room temperature. All crystals belong to space group I222, with one subunit of FBPase in the asymmetric unit. Data from the low K+ complex (control complex) were collected at APS-Structural Biology Center (beam line 19BM), Argonne National Laboratory, on an SBC-CCD at 100 K, using a wavelength of 1.0 Å. Data from the high K+ complex were collected at the synchrotron beam line X4A, Brookhaven National Laboratory, on an ADSC Quantum4 CCD at 100 K, using a wavelength of 0.9795 Å. Data from the high pH complex were collected at APS-BioCars (beam line 14BM), Argonne National Laboratory on an ADSC Quantum4 CCD at 100 K, using a wavelength of 1.0 Å. Data from synchrotron sources were reduced and scaled by Denzo/Scalepack (32Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38231) Google Scholar). Crystals grown for this study are isomorphous to PDB code 1EYJ. Structure determinations were initiated by molecular replacement using calculated phases of1EYJ, and then refined by SHELX (33Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar). Model building and modifications employed XTALVIEW (34McRee D.E. J. Mol. Graphics. 1992; 10: 44-46Crossref Google Scholar). Only distance restraints between covalently link atoms were applied to orthophosphate and metaphosphate, allowing structure factors to be the principal determinant of the geometry of the phosphoryl groups in each of the complexes. Fractional occupancy factors for a given atom or group of atoms were determined by refinement of thermal parameters for a series of fixed occupancy factors. Reported here are occupancy factors that resulted in refined thermal parameters comparable to those of neighboring atoms in full occupancy. Three complexes (Table I) are presented here: (i) orthophosphate, F6P, Mg2+, and K+ (10 mm) at pH 7 (hereafter the control complex), (ii) metaphosphate, F6P, Mg2+, and K+(200 mm) at pH 7 (hereafter the high K+complex), and (iii) metaphosphate, F6P, and Mg2+ at pH 9.6 (hereafter the high pH complex). All complexes have the dynamic loop (residues 52−72) in its engaged conformation, as determined by the location of Tyr57 (29Choe J-Y. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8565-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 30Choe J-Y. Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11441-11450Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Conditions that result in the formation of metaphosphate differ only in pH (7 versus 9.6) or the concentration of K+ (10 versus 200 mm). The kinetic mechanism of FBPase changes from steady-state random at pH 7 to rapid-equilibrium random at pH 9.6 (26Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7401-7406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and K+ is inhibitory at concentrations of 200 mm (K i of 68 mm), but activating at concentrations of 10 mm(K a of 17 mm) (25Zhang R.

The 1-OH group of F6P is in two positions, related by a rotation of approximately of 120° about the C1−C2 bond axis. In one of its positions (occupancy factor of 0.7), the 1-OH group coordinates the Mg2+ at site 1, optimally positioned for an associative reaction (Fig.2 A). Three of four oxygen atoms from Pi are approximately equidistant from the 1-OH group of F6P and the distance between the phosphorus atom and the oxygen atom of the 1-OH group is 2.72 Å. In its second position (displaced conformation; occupancy factor of 0.3), the 1-OH group is turned away from in-line geometry, hydrogen bonding with only one of the oxygen atoms of Pi (Fig. 2 A). Mg2+ at site 1 is 4−5 coordinated (the 1-OH group of F6P being responsible for the variation), whereas magnesium cations at sites 2 and 3 are both six-coordinated (Fig. 2 A).Figure 2Distance relations between selected atoms in the active site. A, control complex. B, high K+ complex. C, high pH complex. The dotted outline in panel C represents a channel of electron density that extends between metal sites 3 and 4, which in the refined model is represented by a discrete set of water molecules and magnesium cations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) An increase in the concentration of K+ from 10 to 200 mm results in an anomalous signal at metal site 1 (Fig. 1 B), indicating the displacement of the Mg2+ from that site by a different atom type. The metal at site 1 has four inner-sphere ligands: One oxygen atom each from Asp118, Aspl21, Glu280, and the phosphoryl species is ∼2−2.5 Å from metal site 1 (Fig. 2 B). The 1-OH group of F6P no longer coordinates the site-1 metal, being entirely in its displaced conformation. The anomalous signal from metal site 1 may be due to K+ or a trace contamination of a transition series cation (Zn2+, for instance) in the KCl. The latter is the most likely cause. The inclusion of 0.2 mm EDTA in the crystallization solution eliminates the anomalous signal at metal site 1. Furthermore, the tetrahedral coordination of the site-1 cation and the displaced conformation of the 1-OH group of F6P are characteristics of previously determined Zn2+-product complexes of FBPase (29Choe J-Y. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8565-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 30Choe J-Y. Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11441-11450Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A mixture of Zn2+ and Mg2+ at occupancies of 0.25 and 0.75, respectively, account for the magnitude of the anomalous signal, and provide thermal parameters of ∼24 Å2, equivalent to that of the site-1 Mg2+ in the control structure The thermal parameter associated with the Mg2+ at site 3 is higher than that of its counterpart in the control complex (30versus 26 Å2). The Mg2+ cation may not fully occupy site 3. (As defined more clearly in the high pH complex below, Mg2+ could occupy a site near Glu98 at low occupancy, and not be resolved from the electron density associated with the water molecule that hydrogen bonds with Glu98 and coordinates the Mg2+ at site 3. See Fig. 2, B and C.) Further indications of weakened interactions involving Mg2+ at site 3 are an increase in the coordination distance to the oxygen atom of the phosphoryl species and the concomitant decrease in the donor-acceptor distance to Arg276 of that same oxygen atom (Fig.2 B). The electron density associated with the ligand at the 1-phosphoryl pocket is a distorted tetrahedron. An elongated teardrop of electron density extends from a plane of electron density. Metaphosphate fits the planar density well, and a water molecule (perhaps representing a molecule of hydroxide) fits equally well to the teardrop of electron density. Thermal parameters of the metaphosphate molecule and its associated water/hydroxide molecule, both refined at full occupancy, are comparable to those of the ligating Mg2+ and nearby side chains. The water molecule is 2.35 Å away from the phosphorus atom of metaphosphate, being coordinated to the magnesium cations at sites 2 and 3, and is on the verge of hydrogen bonding to the side chain of Asp74 (Fig. 2 B). The electron density probably represents an equilibrium mixture of orthophosphate and PO3−/OH−. Glu97, which in the control and high K+ complexes coordinates magnesium cations at sites 2 and 3, now bridges the magnesium cations at sites 1 and 2. The Mg2+ at site 1 is at least 5-coordinated and the Mg2+ at site 2 remains six-coordinated (Figs. 1 Cand 2 C). As in the high K+ complex, the 1-OH group of F6P is in its displaced orientation. The loss of Glu97 as a coordinating ligand to Mg2+ at site 3 is linked perhaps to the binding of magnesium cations at sites 3 and 4. A similar conformational change in Glu97 occurs in Mg2+/Tl complexes, in which Tl+ at site 4 displaces Mg2+ at site 3 (40Choe J-Y. Nelson S.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16008-16014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Glu98coordinates to Mg2+ at site 4, whereas Asp68coordinates to Mg2+ at site 3, but the binding of metal cations to sites 3 and 4 are probably mutually exclusive, as they are only 2.5 Å apart. Thermal parameters for Mg2+ at sites 3 and 4 are 23 and 21 Å2, respectively, with fractional occupancies of 0.6 and 0.3. The electron density at the 1-phosphoryl pocket appears as an elongated teardrop extending from a plane (Fig.1 C). A molecule of metaphosphate, distorted from planarity, and a water molecule (or hydroxide anion) provide the best fit to the electron density. The oxygen atom of the water molecule is 3.09 Å from the phosphorus atom of the metaphosphate, and is within the coordination spheres of the magnesium cations at sites 2 and 4 (or 3), and within hydrogen bonding distance of Asp74 (Fig.2 C). As in the high K+ structure, the electron density at the 1-phosphoryl pocket is consistent with an equilibrium mixture of orthophosphate and PO3−/OH−. The control complex may represent a step on the reaction pathway, but it almost certainly does not represent the central kinetic complex (the interconversion of F16P2 and F6P/Pi at the active site). Liu and Fromm (22Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9122-9128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) determined a value of 2 for the equilibrium constant of the central kinetic complex. The electron density is consistent, however, with the presence of only F6P and orthophosphate. Conditions of crystallization and packing interactions of the crystal could perturb the equilibrium constant of the central complex in favor of products, or the crystallographic complex itself could represent a dead-end complex not on the reaction pathway. Nonetheless, the geometric relationship between Pi and F6P (Fig. 2 A) is consistent with an associative reaction mechanism, the details of which have been presented elsewhere (40Choe J-Y. Nelson S.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16008-16014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar); Asp74 (the pKa of which is raised by the proximity of Glu98) abstracts a proton from a water molecule coordinated to the Mg2+ at site 2 or site 3. The resulting Mg2+-coordinated hydroxide anion in turn abstracts the proton from a second water molecule (the attacking nucleophile) that bridges the magnesium cations at sites 2 and 3. The attacking hydroxide anion has in-line geometry with respect to the 1-phosphoryl group, and would be less than 3 Å from the P-1 atom. Data in support of catalytic roles for Asp74 and Glu98 come from directed mutations, which cause more than a 10,000-fold reduction in catalytic rates (31Kurbanov F.T. Choe J-Y. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17511-17516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 36Kelly N. Giroux E.L. Lu G. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 848-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The associative pathway must have a double proton transfer, because the catalytic base (Asp74/Glu98 subassembly) is too far from the water molecule bridging the magnesium cations at sites 2 and 3 for a direct hydrogen bond. The arrangement of catalytic side chains and ligands in the active site of FBPase, however, are also consistent with a dissociative pathway, and indeed FBPase can generate metaphosphate and the hydroxide anion from orthophosphate. To the best of our knowledge, the high pH and high K+ complexes reported here are the first direct observations of metaphosphate in a condensed phase. FBPase in its crystalline complex catalyzes the second step of a dissociative mechanism; however, the formation of F16P2 from PO3− and F6P (the first step of a dissociative mechanism) may be inaccessible because of the mutual rotation of the plane of metaphosphate and the 1-OH group of F6P away from in-line geometry (Fig. 1, B and C). Evidently, the crystalline complex is dead-end with respect to the overall reaction, but clearly the active site of FBPase can at least equalize the free energies of bound meta- and orthophosphate. Variations in the kinetic and/or catalytic mechanisms due to changes in pH, chemical composition and/or conformation of the substrate, and to the type of metal activator (23Benkovic S.J. de Maine M.M. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1982; 53: 45-82PubMed Google Scholar, 24Tejwani G.A. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1983; 54: 121-194PubMed Google Scholar, 25Zhang R. Villeret V.

Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1623-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), may stem from differences in the rate-limiting step of a dissociative pathway and/or a change in the type of pathway (dissociative versus associative). The presence of Mg2+ cations at mutually exclusive loci (sites 3 and 4) and the alternative ligation of cation sites by Glu97 suggest the possibility of significant change in the active site during the course of the reaction. The Mg2+ at site 4, a cation-binding site identified in Mg2+/Tl+ complexes of FBPase (40Choe J-Y. Nelson S.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16008-16014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), may in fact play a direct role in catalysis (Fig. 3). In F16P2 complexes of FBPase, Mg2+ may appear initially at sites 1, 2, and 4. Stereoinversion of the 1-phosphoryl group may favor the migration of Mg2+ from site 4 to 3. Hence, in all crystalline complexes of Pi and F6P, Mg2+ (or Zn2+) is at site 3, whereas in F16P2 complexes the preferred binding site for Mg2+ may be site 4. Asp74 then could activate a water molecule coordinated to magnesium cations at sites 2 and 4 for a nucleophilic attack on the metaphosphate anion (Fig. 3). A change in metal cation coordination by Glu97 could facilitate the putative migration of Mg2+ from site 4 to 3 during catalysis. In a dissociative pathway, charge builds on the O-1 atom of F16P2, and as a consequence the Mg2+ at site 1 may release Glu97 from its crowded coordination sphere. A modest conformational change puts Glu97 into the nascent coordination sphere of metal site 3, which in turn promotes the migration of the cation (with its attached hydroxide anion) from site 4 to 3 (Fig. 3). The migration of Mg2+ between sites 3 and 4 would account for the significance of both Asp68 (which coordinates Mg2+ at site 3) and Glu98 (which coordinates Mg2+ at site 4) in catalysis. Mutations 2C. V. Inacu and R. B. Honzatko, unpublished data. of Glu98(36Kelly N. Giroux E.L. Lu G. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 848-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and Asp68 each reduce catalytic rates of FBPase by orders of magnitude under comparable conditions of assay. The dissociative pathway, as in Fig. 3, replaces the double proton transfer of the associative pathway, with the migration of a metal-bound hydroxide anion. The loss of Mg2+ cooperativity at pH 9.6 in FBPase kinetics may simply reflect a change in the rate-limiting step of a dissociative pathway. Mutations of Asp68 eliminate Mg2+cooperativity at pH 72 and thereby implicate the cation in site 3 in cooperative phenomenon. The generation of the hydroxide anion at pH 7 may require the participation of Asp74 and metal cations at sites 2 and 4 (or 3), whereas at pH 9.6 the generation of the hydroxide anion may occur with less involvement from the active site. Hence, the formation of metaphosphate may be limiting at pH 9.6, whereas the formation of hydroxide anion may be limiting at pH 7. The hydrolysis of most phosphate esters in organic model systems occurs by a dissociative mechanism (3Westheimer F.H. Chem. Rev. 1981; 81: 313-326Crossref Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 4Westheimer F.H. Science. 1987; 235: 1173-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar, 5Hengge A.C.

Sci. 1992; 17: 105-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), and the same chemistry may occur in the active site of FBPase. In fact, Herschlag and Jencks (37Herschlag D. Jencks W.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5172-5179Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) present a scheme (Chart II or III) that is strikingly similar to the complexes reported here in the relative placement of Mg2+, a metal-coordinated hydroxide ion and a planar intermediate. Furthermore, there are striking parallels between the active sites of FBPase and alkaline phosphatase (38Stec B. Holtz K.M. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1303-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), suggesting that the chemistry of model systems is broadly applicable to phosphatases. Ancestral phosphatases long ago may have commandeered the dominant reaction pathway in solution, but through evolution the free-energy landscape of the reaction coordinate may now place the associative and dissociative pathways on a near equal footing. Hence, small perturbations in the relative free energies of transition states, due to changes in metal cofactors, pH, chemical composition of the substrate, and/or conditions of crystallization may leverage profound effects on the catalytic mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2083878933,"The stator in F1F0-ATP synthase resists strain generated by rotor torque. In Escherichia coli theb2δ subunit complex comprises the stator, bound to subunit a in F0 and to α3β3 hexagon of F1. Proteolysis and cross-linking had suggested that N-terminal residues of α subunit are involved in binding δ. Here we demonstrate that a synthetic peptide consisting of the first 22 residues of α (“αN1–22”) binds specifically to isolated wild-type δ subunit with high affinity (Kd = 130 nm), accounting for a major portion of the binding energy when δ-depleted F1 and isolated δ bind together (Kd = 1.4 nm). Stoichiometry of binding of αN1–22 to δ at saturation was 1/1, showing that in intact F1F0-ATP synthase only one of the three α subunits is involved in δ binding. When αN1–22 was incubated with δ subunits containing mutations in helices 1 or 5 on the F1-binding face of δ, peptide binding was impaired as was binding of δ-depleted F1. Residues α6–18 are predicted to be helical, and a potential helix capping box occurs at residues α3–8. Circular dichroism measurements showed that αN1–22 had significant helical content. Hypothetically a helical region of residues αN1–22 packs with helices 1 and 5 on the F1-binding face of δ, forming the α/δ interface. The stator in F1F0-ATP synthase resists strain generated by rotor torque. In Escherichia coli theb2δ subunit complex comprises the stator, bound to subunit a in F0 and to α3β3 hexagon of F1. Proteolysis and cross-linking had suggested that N-terminal residues of α subunit are involved in binding δ. Here we demonstrate that a synthetic peptide consisting of the first 22 residues of α (“αN1–22”) binds specifically to isolated wild-type δ subunit with high affinity (Kd = 130 nm), accounting for a major portion of the binding energy when δ-depleted F1 and isolated δ bind together (Kd = 1.4 nm). Stoichiometry of binding of αN1–22 to δ at saturation was 1/1, showing that in intact F1F0-ATP synthase only one of the three α subunits is involved in δ binding. When αN1–22 was incubated with δ subunits containing mutations in helices 1 or 5 on the F1-binding face of δ, peptide binding was impaired as was binding of δ-depleted F1. Residues α6–18 are predicted to be helical, and a potential helix capping box occurs at residues α3–8. Circular dichroism measurements showed that αN1–22 had significant helical content. Hypothetically a helical region of residues αN1–22 packs with helices 1 and 5 on the F1-binding face of δ, forming the α/δ interface. ATP synthesis by oxidative phosphorylation occurs on the enzyme F1F0-ATP synthase. In Escherichia coli the enzyme consists of eight different subunit types in stoichiometry α3β3γδεab2cn. Proton movement through the membrane sector of the complex, mediated by subunits a and c, is believed to generate rotation of subunits c, ε, and γ, which collectively form the “rotor.” In turn this rotation is believed to act on the catalytic sites, three in number, at α/β interfaces of the alternating α3β3 hexagon to generate ATP. A “stator,” consisting of subunits b2δ, is necessary to resist the rotor strain. In the reverse direction, ATP hydrolysis in the catalytic sites drives rotation of the rotor, which then generates uphill transport of protons across the bacterial plasma membrane to form the electrochemical gradient essential for nutrient uptake, locomotion, and other functions. Again rotor strain must be resisted by the stator for efficient function. The mechanisms by which catalysis, proton gradient formation, and subunit rotation are functionally integrated are subjects of active investigation (1Weber J. Senior A.E.

The stator (b2δ) interacts with the α3β3 catalytic unit via δ/F1 interactions and with the proton-translocating machinery via b2/a interactions. δ and b2 interact together via their C-terminal regions. There may also be interaction betweenb2 and α or β subunits. In two recent reports we have studied the binding of the δ subunit to F1 (7Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

Using novel tryptophan fluorescence assays, our work established quantitative parameters for δ binding to F1, demonstrated that helices 1 and 5 of the N-terminal domain of the δ subunit form the F1-binding surface on δ, and showed that the cytoplasmic domain of the b subunit has a very large effect on the affinity of δ binding to F1. In this report we move to study the δ-binding surface on F1. δ subunit (and its mitochondrial homolog oligomycin sensitivity conferral protein) is known from electron microscopy studies to bind at the “top” of F1(9Wilkens S.

Removal of the first 15 residues of α by trypsin or of the first 19 residues by chymotrypsin was sufficient to greatly reduce δ binding to F1 (11Dunn S.D. Heppel L.A. Fullmer C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6891-6896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). X-ray crystallography studies have not yet been able to determine the structure of these α subunit residues (4Menz R.I.

In this work we took a direct approach and tested the binding of a synthetic peptide, consisting of α subunit residues 1–22, to the isolated wild-type δ subunit. We found that the peptide did bind to wild-type δ with high affinity and stoichiometry of 1 mol/mol, producing the same change in fluorescence signal of natural residue δ-Trp-28 in wild-type δ as was produced by binding of δ-depleted F1 to δ subunit. Moreover fluorescence responses upon binding of the peptide to isolated mutant δ subunits were similar to those produced upon binding of δ-depleted F1. The peptide showed α-helical structure by circular dichroism, indicating that a predicted helix at residues 6–18 of α subunit may be important for binding of δ. Purification of wild-type, mutant, and proteolytically cleaved δ subunit (δ′) was as in Refs.7Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

Unless noted otherwise the buffer was 50 mm HEPES/NaOH, 5 mmMgSO4, pH 7.0. Binding-induced changes in Trp fluorescence were plotted versus peptide concentration, and from the resulting curves, Kd values were calculated by nonlinear regression. In all cases the fluorescence signal due to the peptide alone was negligible. Measurements were made at 23 °C on a Jasco CD spectropolarimeter Model J710. Peptide was dissolved at 250 μm in 0.3% NH3 solution in water. As noted in the Introduction, there is evidence suggesting that the N-terminal region of α subunit of F1 is involved in binding δ subunit. In E. coli F1, the N-terminal amino acid of α is Met with a free amino group (11Dunn S.D. Heppel L.A. Fullmer C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6891-6896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A synthetic peptide comprising residues α1–22 (called “αN1–22”) with free N and C termini was synthesized by a commercial source. The sequence is MQLNSTEISELIKQRIAQFNVV. When the peptide was mixed with isolated δ subunit it was seen (Fig. 1A) that the fluorescence signal of the single Trp in δ (δ-Trp-28) was considerably enhanced, by 50%, and blue-shifted by 4 nm. Exactly the same fluorescence changes were seen on addition of δ-depleted F1 (α3β3γε) to isolated δ subunit (Fig. 1A). Therefore the synthetic peptide mimicked δ-depleted F1 in binding to isolated δ subunit. Using this fluorescence signal, we had established previously by titration that δ-depleted F1 and wild-type δ interacted withKd of 1.4 nm (7Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18390-18396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In Fig. 1Bwe carried out a titration of αN1–22 peptide with fixed concentration of wild-type δ. It is seen that binding saturated at a maximal stoichiometry of 1 mol peptide/mol δ subunit, and theKd was 130 nm (mean of five experiments). Together these data demonstrate an unexpectedly tight and specific association between the peptide and δ. A further experiment in Fig. 1B showed that binding of αN1–22 to δ′, a proteolytic fragment of δ consisting of residues 1–135 only, which contains the N-terminal helical domain of δ (15Wilkens S. Dunn S.D. Chandler J. Dahlquist F.W. Capaldi R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 198-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), occurred with the same binding stoichiometry and affinity. Therefore the peptide binds to the N-terminal domain of δ just as F1 does (7Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18390-18396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Two other peptides were synthesized. One was “αN1–22Cam” in which the C-terminal Val residue of αN1–22 was amidated. This peptide proved very difficult to dissolve in aqueous buffer and was not further investigated. A second peptide was the 11-mer sequence GTQLSGGQKQR with free N and C termini. This peptide, from the ATP-binding cassette signature sequence of P-glycoprotein, with no resemblance to αN1–22, dissolved readily in water but produced no change whatsoever in fluorescence signal of isolated wild-type δ subunit. The experiments in Fig. 1 were performed at pH 7.0 to mimic physiological conditions. In previous work we had shown that binding of δ-depleted F1 to wild-type δ subunit was both Mg2+- and pH-sensitive (7Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18390-18396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We repeated these assays with αN1–22 peptide and wild-type δ, and the results are shown in Table I alongside the previous data for comparison. It is evident that binding of αN1–22 to δ was not strongly Mg2+-sensitive in contrast to the situation with F1. There was a small pH sensitivity in absence of Mg2+ but much lower than with F1. Interestingly, however, at high pH (9.4) the two sets of data converged, and particularly in absence of Mg2+ we can conclude that, at pH 9.4, the N-terminal residues 1–22 of α provide all of the binding energy for δ binding. At lower pH and in presence of Mg2+ other interactions come into play with F1 present.Table IEffect of pH and Mg2+ ions on Kd of binding of αN1–22 peptide to wild-type δ subunitpH value6.07.08.09.09.4αN1–22 peptide Plus 5 mmMgSO40.280.150.270.210.24 No Mg2+ (0.5 mmEDTA)0.260.210.320.480.89δ-Depleted F1 Plus 5 mmMgSO40.00190.00140.00300.00250.017 No Mg2+ (0.5 mmEDTA)0.00900.00640.094>1.0>1.0 Open table in a new tab In Ref. 8Weber J.

Two new Trp residues were introduced at positions δ-11 and δ-79. These proved valuable for monitoring binding of δ to δ-depleted F1. Most of the mutations impaired binding affinity between δ-depleted F1 and δ. We used these mutants for further characterization of binding of peptide αN1–22 to δ. The titration curves are shown in Fig. 2, and the calculated Kd values are summarized in Table II. We have previously reported titration curves and Kdvalues for binding of δ-depleted F1 to each of the mutant δ subunits; these values are also shown in TableII.Table IIComparison of binding of αN1–22 peptide versus δ-depleted F1 to isolated wild-type and mutant δ subunitsδ subunitKdKd(αN1–22)/Kd(F1) (ratio)ΔΔG0δ-Depleted F1αN1–22 peptideμmkJ/molWild type0.00140.139311δY11A0.217033014δY11W/W28L0.50306010δA14D>0.1ND2-aND, Kdcould not be determined (see Fig. 2B and text).δA14L>0.1NDδN75A0.00103.7370020δN75E0.00204.0200019δV79A0.0172.414012δV79W/W28L0.0472451102-a ND, Kdcould not be determined (see Fig. 2B and text). Open table in a new tab In Fig. 2A we show the titrations of αN1–22 with δY11A and δY11W/δW28L mutant subunits. In the former the fluorescence signal is that of the native δ-Trp-28; in the latter the signal is that of introduced δ-Trp-11 with the natural δ-Trp-28 mutated away (8Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13409-13416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). With δY11A, the fluorescence was enhanced as it is when δ-depleted F1 is added to δY11A (8Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13409-13416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar); however, with δY11W/W28L the fluorescence was quenched, which is different to the substantial enhancement of fluorescence seen when δ-depleted F1 is added to δY11W/W28L (8Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13409-13416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Due to limited solubility of the peptide in assay buffer, titration curves could not be extended beyond 30 μm peptide; however, we feel that the calculated Kd values in Table II are reasonably reliable. Fig. 2B shows titration of αN1–22 with δA14L and δA14D mutant δ subunits. It is seen that there is no signal change, and therefore no Kd values can be assigned. This could indicate that no binding occurred under these conditions, but it may be noted that no signal change is seen when δ-depleted F1 is added to δA14L and δA14D mutants even under conditions where binding does occur (8Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13409-13416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Fig. 2C shows titration of αN1–22 with the δN75A and δN75E mutants. Enhancement of the fluorescence signal, similar to when δ-depleted F1 is titrated with these mutant δ subunits (8Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13409-13416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), was seen. Fig. 2D shows titration of αN1–22 with the δV79A and δV79W/W28L mutant δ subunits. In the former case substantial enhancement of fluorescence is seen; in the latter case a quench of fluorescence occurs. Both situations mimic what is seen when δ-depleted F1 is added to these mutant subunits. It should also be noted that all of the fluorescence responses were accompanied by blue shifts on addition of αN1–22 as was seen on addition of δ-depleted F1. Therefore, in seven of eight mutants, addition of αN1–22 peptide elicited a fluorescence response similar to that for δ-depleted F1, the only exception being mutant δY11W/W28L where fluorescence was quenched rather than enhanced. With wild-type and six of the mutant δ subunits theKd value for binding of peptide αN1–22 was higher than that for δ-depleted F1 (Table II, columns 2 and 3). (With the remaining two mutants, δA14L and δA14D,Kd could not be calculated due to lack of signal.) From the ratio of the Kd values (Table II, column 4) the ΔΔG0 values (Table II, column 5) were calculated to be 10–20 kJ/mol. As noted in the Introduction the structure of the N-terminal residues 1–22 of the α subunits in F1F0-ATP synthase is unknown. Several secondary structure prediction algorithms 2V. A. Eyrich and B. Rost, the META-PredictProtein server (cubic.bioc.columbia.edu/predictprotein/submit_meta.html). indicate that residues α6–18 form an α-helix. Residues α3–8 conform to the sequence of a typical helix capping box (17Aurora R. Rose G.D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 21-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar) with both H-bonding and hydrophobic elements. We analyzed the helicity of αN1–22 peptide by circular dichroism measurement (18Böhm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). The results (Fig.3) indicated helix content of 25%. Since short peptides in aqueous medium often do not form ordered structure (19Andrews M.J.I. Tabor A.B. Tetrahedron. 1999; 55: 11711-11743Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 20Beck-Sickinger A.G. Kiess M. Kern P. Folkers G. Pharm. Acta Helv. 1995; 70: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), this is a significant result. This work establishes that the N-terminal 22 residues of α subunit of F1 provide an important part of the binding surface for the δ subunit on F1F0-ATP synthase and contribute substantial binding interactions to maintain stator function. Our conclusion is based on the following evidence. 1) The peptide αN1–22 consisting of the N-terminal 22 residues of α subunit binds to wild-type δ subunit with high affinity (Kd = 130 nm), implying specific interaction. 2) Upon binding αN1–22 produces the same changes in fluorescence signal of residue δ-Trp-28 (enhancement of signal and blue shift) as does binding of δ-depleted F1 to δ subunit, showing that αN1–22 brings about the same environmental changes of δ-Trp-28. 3) An unrelated peptide produced no effect. 4) αN1–22 bound to six mutant δ subunits with reduced affinity just as δ-depleted F1 does. These mutations were shown previously to be located on the F1-binding surface of δ. 5) The fluorescence response of inserted δ-Trp-79 upon binding of αN1–22 (quench of fluorescence and blue shift) was very similar to that seen with δ-depleted F1. With inserted δ-Trp-11, the fluorescence response was different (quench with peptide versus enhancement with δ-depleted F1); however, the decrease in binding affinity was of similar order of magnitude as in other mutants and wild type. Together the data establish that the αN1–22 peptide mimics F1 in its binding to δ subunit. The peptide αN1–22 bound to isolated δ subunit with 1/1 stoichiometry at saturation. Since the stoichiometry of binding of δ to F1 is 1/1 (7Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18390-18396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), this indicates that in intact F1F0-ATP synthase only one of the three α subunits is involved in δ subunit binding. Our work suggests that the N-terminal region of α forms an α-helix. Previous work has shown that the F1-binding surface on δ is composed of helices 1 and 5 of the N-terminal domain of δ (8Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13409-13416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Therefore we propose that in intact enzyme the α-helical N-terminal residues of one of the three α subunits packs on this binding surface of δ, forming the α/δ interface. Within the proposed helical region of α are several conserved residues, notably α-Glu-7, α-Ile-8, α-Leu-11, α-Phe-19, that might make specific interactions with δ. In this model, two of the α subunit N termini would not be involved in δ binding and would be available for other functions. The 20 S proteasome structure provides a possible analogy in which protruding helical N termini of the heptameric α subunits adopt different spatial conformations and perform disparate functions (16Whitby F.G. Masters E.I. Kramer L. Knowlton J.R. Yao Y. Wang C.C. Hill C.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The facts that the Kd of binding of αN1–22 to δ was lower than that for δ-depleted F1 by 100-fold (Kd of 130 versus 1.4 nm) and also that the pH and Mg2+ sensitivity of binding was different in the case of the peptide indicate that other interactions between F1 and δ also contribute to binding. However, it is clear from the surprisingly high affinity of binding seen with the peptide that the N-terminal 22 residues of α contribute a major component (≥75%) of the binding energy. The ability to use synthetic peptides to study the stator function at the top of ATP synthase should greatly expedite future experimentation. One can, for example, readily study the effects of mutations or deletions of residues in the N-terminal region of α, a project that we have found difficult to approach by conventional procedures because genetic manipulations that disrupt stator function also interrupt assembly of the enzyme in cells. It should also prove facile to extend these studies to understanding the cooperative effect of theb subunit on binding of δ subunit to F1(8Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13409-13416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).

The ability of this mutant to respire is restored by RIB3, a gene previously shown to code for 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate synthase (DHBP synthase), an enzyme of the riboflavin biosynthetic pathway. The sequences of RIB3 from wild type and aE280/U1 indicated a single base change resulting in an A137T substitution. The alanine 137 is a conserved residue located in a cavity on the surface of the protein distant from the active site and from the subunit interaction domain involved in homodimer formation. The respiratory defect elicited by this mutation cannot be explained by a flavin insufficiency based on the following evidence: 1) growth of the aE280/U1 on respiratory substrates is not rescued by exogenous riboflavin; 2) the levels of flavin nucleotides are not significantly different in the mutant and wild type. We proposed that in addition to its known function in riboflavin synthesis, RIB3 also functions in expression of mitochondrial respiration. Restoration by riboflavin of growth of arib3 deletion mutant on glucose but not glycerol/ethanol also supported this conclusion.

Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such mutants have been assigned to the following phenotypic classes based on their compositions of respiratory chain components: 1) mutants defective in individual carriers of the respiratory chain, 2) mutants having a normal set of respiratory enzymes (e.g. cytochrome spectra and ATPase), and 3) mutants with partial or severe pleiotropic deficiencies in respiratory chain components. Functional analysis of the latter is difficult because the phenotype fails to provide clues as to the nature of the biochemical lesion. In the present study we have characterized a pet mutant (aE280/U1) with partial pleiotropic defects in respiratory chain components. The mutant has been determined to have a point mutation inRIB3, a conserved gene of which the product, 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate synthase (DHBP1 synthase), catalyzes the first step in the riboflavin biosynthetic pathway (2Bacher A.

The lack of correspondence in the phenotype of the rib3 point mutant and a mutant with a complete deletion of RIB3 prompted us to examine the biochemical properties of the mutant further. We present evidence that the phenotype of aE280/U1 is not related to a flavin nucleotide deficiency and propose that in addition to its involvement in riboflavin synthesis, DHBP synthase has another function essential for expression of respiration in yeast. The strains of yeast used in this study are listed in Table I. The respiratory-deficient mutant E280 (MATα met6 rib3) was derived from S. cerevisiae D273-10B/A21 by mutagenesis with nitrosoguanidine (1Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol.

Open table in a new tab The linearSacI-PstI fragment containing RIB3(Fig. 1) was transferred to pUC18 (5Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene. 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11472) Google Scholar). Two divergent primers each containing a BamHI site were used to amplify the entire plasmid except for the RIB3 coding region. The amplified plasmid was ligated to a 1-kb BamHI fragment containing the yeast HIS3 gene. The null allele, recovered as a linearSacI-PstI fragment, was introduced into the wild type diploid strain W303 by the one-step gene substitution procedure (6Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar). Dissection of tetrads obtained from several histidine prototrophic diploid transformants indicated that growth of one-half of the meiotic progeny on glucose depended on the presence of riboflavin. The riboflavin auxotrophy co-segregated with the histidines prototrophy. The region between the BclI and StyI sites coding for the amino-terminal half of DHBP synthase was ligated in frame to theE. coli expression vector pATH2 (7Koerner T.J. Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Tzagoloff A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) digested withBamHI. This ligation required the introduction of aBamHI linker at the StyI site. E. coliRR1 cells harboring the plasmid were used to produce thetrpE/RIB3 fusion product as described elsewhere (6Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar). Following cells lysis, the overexpressed protein was recovered in the insoluble protein fraction and was dissolved in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 2% SDS, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 5 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The solubilized fusion protein was further purified by sizing on a Bio-Gel A 0.5 (BioRad) with 10 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol as the eluting buffer. Fractions enriched for the fusion protein were pooled, concentrated by precipitation with acetone, and dissolved in 0.1% SDS, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol for immunization of rabbits. A recombinant plasmid (pG164/T3) containing RIB3 was obtained by transformation of aE280/U1 with a yeast genomic library by the method of Schiestl and Gietz (8Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar). This library, consisting of partialSau3A fragments of yeast nuclear DNA cloned in theURA3-bearing shuttle plasmid YEp24 (9Botstein D. Davis R.W. Strathern J.N. Jones E.W. Broach J.R.

The chemical method of Maxam and Gilbert (10Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (5478) Google Scholar) was used to sequence the ends of the nuclear DNA insert in pG164/T3. To clone the mutant rib3 gene, nuclear DNA prepared from aE280/U1 was digested with a combination of PstI andSacI. Fragments averaging 1.9 kb were cloned in YEp352 (11Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar) and used to transform E. coli. The resultant library was screened by colony hybridization with a32P-labeled 1.9-kb PstI-SacI fragment containing RIB3 (12Feinberg A.P. Voglestein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar). The identical procedure was used to clone RIB3 from the wild type strains W303-1A and D273-10B/A1. The two wild type and the mutant RIB3 genes were sequenced by the Sanger method (13Sanger F. Niklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) with a commercial sequencing kit (United States Biochemical, Cleveland, OH). Standard methods were used for plasmid manipulations and colony hybridization (14Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

Biol. 1974; 88: 185-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) except that Zymolyase 20T (ICN Laboratories, Aurora, OH) instead of glusulase was used to convert cells to spheroplasts. Spectral analyses of mitochondrial cytochromes were performed as described previously (16Tzagoloff A. Akai A. Needleman R. J. Biol.

Repetto B. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al.(18Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E280 is a respiratory-deficient strain of S. cerevisiaepreviously assigned to complementation group G164 of a petmutants collection (1Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like other pet mutants, E280 grows on glucose but not on nonfermentable substrates such as glycerol/ethanol. Some growth of the mutant, however, is observed on glycerol/ethanol after incubation of plates for prolonged periods. The mutant is complemented by ρo testers indicating that the growth defect on respiratory substrates is due to a recessive mutation in a nuclear gene. E280 displays normal translation of the mitochondrial gene products (Fig.1A). Spectra of mitochondrial extracts, however, indicate a partial deficit of cytochromes a, a3, and b relative to cytochromec (Fig. 1B). A 2-fold reduction of cytochrome oxidase in the mutant was measured enzymatically (TableII). The NADH and succinate oxidase activities are reduced, respectively, to 25 and 16% of wild type mitochondria. The different oxidase activities were not increased in mitochondria of the mutant grown in the presence of riboflavin.Table IIRespiratory activities of mitochondriaStrainμmol O2/min/mg of proteinNADH oxidaseSuccinate oxidaseCytochrome oxidaseD273-10B/A210.50 ± 0.010.30 ± 0.000.36 ± 0.01E2800.14 ± 0.020.06 ± 0.010.19 ± 0.01E280 + riboflavin0.16 ± 0.000.05 ± 0.000.13 ± 0.00Mitochondria were isolated from the parental wild type strain D273-10B/A21 and from the rib3 mutant E280 grown in YPGal and in YPGal supplemented with 25 μg/ml riboflavin.

To identify the gene responsible for the respiratory defect of E280, the uracil-requiring derivative strain aE280/U1 was transformed with a yeast genomic plasmid library. Two independent respiratory competent clones were obtained from the transformation. The plasmids had overlapping nuclear DNA inserts, one of which (pG164/T3) was used to localize the gene (Fig. 2). The results of subcloning indicated that the gene conferring respiration on aE280/U1 is located between a SacI and a PstI site (Fig. 2). This region of the insert contains RIB3, a gene of chromosome IV, previously shown to code for DHBP synthase (3Garcia-Remirez J.J. Santos M.A. Revuelta J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23801-23807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of ribose-5-phosphate to 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate, an early precursors in riboflavin synthesis (2Bacher A. Eberhardt S. Fischer M. Kis K. Richter G. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 153-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The failure of pG164/ST31 and pG164/ST32, each containing different halves of RIB3, to restore respiration confirmed the correct identification of the gene. Site directed integration of a single copy of RIB3 in the chromosomal DNA of aE280/U1 restored normal growth on nonfermentable carbon sources (Fig. 3A), suggesting thatRIB3 acts by complementation rather than suppression the mutant.Figure 3Growth of wild type and rib3mutants on different carbon sources in the presence and absence of riboflavin. The following strains were used to compare growth on the different media: the respiratory competent strains W303-1A (WT), the rib3 null mutants aW303ΔRIB3 (Δrib3) and D273ΔRIB3 (Δrib3*), therib3 point mutant aE280/U1 (rib3), therib3 point mutant aE280/U1/ST22U with RIB3inserted at URA3 (rib3/i-RIB3), therib3 point mutant aE280/U1/E280U with the mutantrib3 gene of E280 inserted at URA3(rib3/i-rib3), and the null mutant aW303ΔRIB3 with the mutant rib3 gene of E280 (Δrib3/i-rib3) or of the wild type gene (Δrib3/i-RIB3). The different strains were spotted on rich glucose (YPD) or rich glycerol/ethanol (YEPG) plates without and without 25 μg/ml riboflavin (+ribo). The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 36 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mutations inRIB3 have been shown to elicit a riboflavin auxotrophy on glucose (3Garcia-Remirez J.J. Santos M.A. Revuelta J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23801-23807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This phenotype was confirmed in the present study by deleting the gene in the diploid strain W303 (see “Materials and Methods” for the construction of the Δrib3:HIS3 null allele). Growth of the haploid strain W303ΔRIB3 containing the deletion allele on glucose is strictly dependent on the addition of riboflavin. This phenotype is different from that of E280 or aE280/U1, both of which grow on glucose in the absence of riboflavin. An unexpected property of the null mutant is its failure to grow on a nonfermentable carbon source supplemented with riboflavin (Fig3A). Like the rib3 null mutant, growth of the point mutants on glycerol/ethanol also fails to be rescued by riboflavin (Fig. 3A) The discrepancy in the growth properties of the rib3 null mutant and aE280/U1 on glucose raised the possibility thatRIB3 might be suppressing rather than complementing the respiratory defect. To test linkage of the Δrib3:HIS3 null and E280 point alleles, the 1.98-kb SacI-PstI fragment containing RIB3 was transferred to the integrative vector YIp352 (11Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar) yielding pG164/ST22. This plasmid was linearized at the BstXI site internal to RIB3 and was used to transform aE280/U1. A respiratory competent and Ura+clone obtained from the transformation (aE280/U1/ST22) were crossed to W303-1B. Integration of RIB3 at its homologous locus in chromosomal DNA was confirmed by dissection of 12 complete tetrads issued from the resultant diploid cells. In each case all four meiotic spore progeny were ascertained to be respiratory competent. For the allelism test aE280/U1/ST22 was crossed to the rib3 null mutant W303ΔRIB3. Ten complete tetrads were analyzed following sporulation of the diploid cells. In every case the requirement of riboflavin for growth on glucose segregated 2:2. The ability of a single copy of RIB3 to restore the respiratory deficiency of aE280/U1 and the tight genetic linkage between the mutant allele of aE280/U1 and the rib3 null allele constitute strong evidence that the respiratory deficient phenotype of E280/U1 stems from a point mutation in RIB3. To sequence the mutation, the rib3 gene was cloned from aE280/U1. Because this strain was derived from a cross of two non-isogenic strains (E280 and W303-1A), the gene was also isolated from D273-10B/A21 (parent of E280) and W303-1A. The genes obtained from the three strains were sequenced and compared with the previously reported sequence ofRIB3. 2J. J. Garcia-Ramirez, M. A. Santos, and J. L. Revuelta, GenBank™ accession numberZ21619. The sequences of the D273-10B/A21 and W303-1A genes were identical to the sequence number reported in GenBank™. The rib3 gene isolated from the aE280/U1 mutant, however, had a single G to A transition at nucleotide 409 of the gene, resulting in the substitution of alanine 137 by threonine. The mutant gene isolated from aE280/U1 was cloned into the integrative plasmid YIp352. Uracil-independent clones obtained by transformation of the rib3 null mutant a/αW303ΔRIB3 with the E280 gene on the integrative plasmid were sporulated and the growth phenotype of the meiotic products analyzed. The presence of the mutant gene in a single copy restored normal growth of the null strain on glucose and glycerol in the absence of added riboflavin (Fig. 3B). The ability of the mutant gene to rescue the growth of the rib3 null strain is consistent with the growth properties of E280 and suggested that the A137T mutation does not affect riboflavin synthesis. Surprisingly, growth of the point mutant on glycerol was also partially restored when a single copy of the mutant gene was integrated into chromosomal DNA of the null mutant (Fig. 3C). The flavin nucleotides and riboflavin compositions of mitochondria and cytosolic fractions (post-mitochondrial supernatant) were compared in the wild type, the mutant aE280/U1, and the mutant transformed with RIB3 on a high copy plasmid. Flavin nucleotides were extracted and separated by HPLC on a C18 column. Although some differences were noted in the amount of riboflavin and flavin nucleotides in the three strains, there was no indication of any significant deficit of FMN or FAD in either the mitochondrial or post-mitochondrial fractions of the mutant (Fig.4). Some reduction in riboflavin concentration is seen in the post-mitochondrial supernatant fraction. The increased ratio of FMN relative to FAD in mitochondria of the mutant and transformant may be because of strain differences, as this is also true of mitochondria in the D273-10B/A21 wild type strain (not shown). These results argue strongly against any significant effect of the A137T mutation on riboflavin synthesis. The subcellular localization of DHBP synthase was studied with an antibody raised against the protein expressed from a trpE/RIB3 fusion gene. The antibody detected a protein of ∼28 kDa in the post-mitochondrial supernatant fraction of wild type yeast (Fig.5A). The identity of this protein as DHBP synthase is confirmed by its absence in therib3 null mutant and its presence at much higher concentrations in the mutant transformed with the wild type gene on a multicopy plasmid. The mass of DHBP synthase derived from the sequence of RIB3 is 22.5 kDa. The reason for the apparent larger mass obtained by SDS-PAGE is not clear. Although most of the DHBP synthase was detected in the post-mitochondrial supernatant fraction corresponding to the soluble cytosolic proteins of yeast, a small fraction was also present in mitochondria. This was true both for the transformant overexpressing the protein (Fig. 5A) and for wild type (see longer exposure in Fig. 5B). Several lines of evidence indicated that this was not an artifactual association. The mitochondrial fraction isolated from an over-expresser was further purified on a Nycodenz gradient (23Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The gradient fractions were probed with antibody against DHBP synthase and cytochrome b2, used here as a mitochondrial marker. The antibody detected two peaks, one of which co-sedimented with the mitochondrial cytochromeb2 marker (Fig. 5C). The second peak was well separated in the upper part of the gradient. No attempts were made to identify the nature of the material in this fraction. Mitochondria purified on a Nycodenz gradient were diluted under isotonic and hypotonic conditions. Even though the hypotonic treatment causes the outer membrane to burst, it remains attached to and fractionates with the mitoplasts. Both mitochondria and mitoplasts were treated with proteinase K (24Glick B.S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The results of this experiment indicate that disruption of the outer membrane released most of the DHBP synthase and of the intermembrane marker cytochromeb2 (Fig. 5D). The small fraction of the two proteins remaining in the mitoplasts was completely susceptible to the protease. In contrast, DHBP synthase and cytochromeb2 were largely resistant to the protease in unlysed mitochondria (Fig. 5D). The loss of DHBP synthase from the mitoplasts suggests that the protein is located in the intermembrane space. The possibility that DHBP synthase may be associated with the outer membrane and is dissociated from it under hypotonic conditions, however, cannot be excluded. The mutation in aE280/U1 does not affect the steady-state concentration of DHBP synthase in the cytoplasm (data not shown). This result excludes the possibility that the respiratory deficiency is due to a lower cytosolic concentration of the enzyme. It is interesting to note that the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic concentrations of DHBP synthase are higher in transformants harboring an integrated copy of the gene than in wild type (Fig. 6). This suggests that the chromosomal context (URA3 site in the case of the integrated genes) influences the expression of the gene. The estimated 4–5-fold increase of DHBP synthase in the strain with the integrated mutant allele (aW303ΔRIB3/i-E280) may explain the ability of this transformant to grow on nonfermentable substrates (Fig.3B). In the present study, the RIB3 gene encoding DHBP synthase, an enzyme of the riboflavin biosynthetic pathway, was cloned based on its ability to restore respiration in the petmutant, aE280/U1. The rescue by RIB3 is the result of genetic complementation. This is supported by tight linkage of the mutation in aE280/U1 to a rib3 null allele and sequence analysis of the rib3 gene in aE280/U1, which confirmed the presence of a mutation in the gene. The single base mutation causes a relatively innocuous substitution of a threonine for an alanine at residue 137 of the protein. The rib3 null mutant used in this study shows an auxotrophic requirement of riboflavin for growth on glucose as reported previously (3Garcia-Remirez J.J. Santos M.A. Revuelta J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23801-23807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In contrast, the rib3 point mutant, like otherpet mutants, grows on glucose in the absence of added riboflavin. Moreover, riboflavin does not restore the growth of the mutant on nonfermentable substrates. This suggests that the phenotype of the rib3 point mutant is unrelated to the activity of DHBP synthase in riboflavin synthesis. Instead it must have another function required for expression of mitochondrial respiration. This is also supported by the following evidence. 1) Analysis of FAD and FMN failed to show any substantive decrease in the mitochondrial and cytosolic concentrations of these nucleotides in the mutant aE280/U1. Some decrease in the riboflavin concentration was seen in the cytosolic fraction of the mutant. This, however, could be because of the different genetic background of the two strains used for the analysis. 2) The rates of oxidation of NADH or succinate in isolated mitochondria were not increased when the point mutant was grown in the presence of riboflavin in the growth medium. 3) Riboflavin rescued growth of therib3 null mutant on glucose but not on nonfermentable substrates. Transformation of the rib3 null mutant with therib3 allele of E280 either in single (integrated into chromosomal DNA) or in multiple copies (episomal plasmid) conferred growth on glucose. Surprisingly, the transformants also grew on the nonfermentable substrates glycerol/ethanol. We attribute this to the elevated level of the mutant protein in the integrant as a result of increased expression of the gene in the new chromosomal context (URA3 locus). This explanation is consistent with the partial restoration of growth of aE280/U1 on glycerol/ethanol when transformed with an extra copy of the mutant gene. These observations together with the slow growth phenotype of aE280/U1 on glycerol/ethanol suggest that the E280 allele reduces but does not abolish the activity of DHBP synthase needed for respiration. Overexpression of the mutant protein, therefore, is able to compensate for the partial loss of function. The role of DHBP synthase in expression of mitochondrial respiration is not clear. The presence, even at somewhat elevated levels, of riboflavin in the mitochondria of the point mutant excludes DHBP synthase from involvement in riboflavin transport. The presence of riboflavin in the mutant also excludes 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate, the precursor of riboflavin formed by the synthase, from being needed in some other pathway essential for respiration. The more likely alternative is that mitochondrial respiration depends on a function of DHBP unrelated to riboflavin synthesis. The small fraction of DHBP synthase detected in the mitochondrial intermembrane space suggests that this function is likely to occur in mitochondria. On the basis of the reported structure of the Magnaporthe grisea DHBP synthase (25Liao D.-I. Zheng Y.-J. Viitanen P.V. Jordan D.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 17951806Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the A137T mutation in aE280/U1 occurs in a region distant from the binding sites for the substrate and metal cofactor. The mutation is also removed from the interface of the homodimer (25Liao D.-I. Zheng Y.-J. Viitanen P.V. Jordan D.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 17951806Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The alanine is located in a depression on the surface of the protein with the methyl group pointing outward. The threonine, with an extra carbon and hydroxyl, can be accommodated without interfering sterically with the neighboring residues in this surface structure. Although the alanine is conserved in the M. grisea enzyme, in some organisms the corresponding position is occupied by serine (26Stephens R.S. Kalman S. Lammel C.J. Fan J. Marathe R. Aravind L. Mitchell W.P. Olinger L. Tatusov R.L. Zhao Q. Koonin E.V. Davis R.W. Science. 1998; 282: 754-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar). Conceivably, this domain may be involved in the binding of a molecule that is delivered to mitochondria by DHBP synthase and is required for biogenesis/maintenance of the respiratory chain."

Here, the interaction of Tl+ with fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase is explored under conditions that support catalysis. On the basis of initial velocity kinetics, Tl+ enhances catalysis by 20% with aK a of 1.3 mm and a Hill coefficient near unity. Crystal structures of enzyme complexes with Mg2+, Tl+, and reaction products, in which the concentration of Tl+ is 1 mm or less, reveal Mg2+ at metal sites 1, 2, and 3 of the active site, but little or no bound Tl+. Intermediate concentrations of Tl+ (5−20 mm) displace Mg2+ from site 3 and the 1-OH group of fructose 6-phosphate from in-line geometry with respect to bound orthophosphate. Loop 52−72 appears in a new conformational state, differing from its engaged conformation by disorder in residues 61−69. Tl+ does not bind to metal sites 1 or 2 in the presence of Mg2+, but does bind to four other sites with partial occupancy. Two of four Tl+sites probably represent alternative binding sites for the site 3 catalytic Mg2+, whereas the other sites could play roles in monovalent cation activation. fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase fructose 6-phosphate, F16P2, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate fructose 2,6-bisphosphate protein data bank Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase,1 EC 3.1.3.11) hydrolyzes fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (F16P2) to fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) and phosphate (Pi) (1Krebs H.A.

Coordinated regulation of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis occurs in vivo, largely because of opposite effects caused by F26P2 on FBPase (inhibition) and fructose 6-phosphate 1-kinase (activation). Divalent cations (Mg2+, Mn2+, and/or Zn2+) are an absolute requirement for FBPase activity. Enzyme activity increases sigmoidally as a function of divalent cation concentration at pH 7.5 (Hill coefficient of ∼2), but at pH 9.6 the variation is hyperbolic (8Nimmo H.G. Tipton K.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 58: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 14Nimmo H.G. Tipton K.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 58: 575-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The mammalian enzyme is a homotetramer and exists in distinct conformational states, depending on the relative concentrations of active site ligands and AMP (15Zhang Y. Liang J.-Y. Huang S. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 609-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). With or without metal cofactors and/or other active site ligands, but in the absence of AMP, FBPase is in its R-state (16Zhang Y. Liang J. Huang S. Ke H. Lipscomb W.N.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11441-11450Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the presence of AMP, however, the top pair of subunits rotates 17° relative to the bottom pair, resulting in the T-state conformer (18Ke H. Zhang G.Y. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The minimum distance separating AMP molecules from any given active site is ∼28 Å (18Ke H. Zhang G.Y. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Yet studies in kinetics, NMR, fluorescence, and x-ray crystallography reveal competition between AMP and divalent cations (11Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9122-9128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Choe J.-Y. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B.

Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7401-7406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Loop 52−72 evidently plays a central role in allosteric inhibition of catalysis by AMP. It can be in at least three conformational states: engaged, disordered, and disengaged (17Choe J.-Y. Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11441-11450Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 20Choe J.-Y. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B.

The engaged conformation is arguably required for the high affinity association of divalent cations and in stabilizing the transition state (17Choe J.-Y. Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11100-11106Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The disordered conformation of the loop may facilitate product release and substrate association. The loop can be in its engaged or disordered conformations in the R-state enzyme. The T-state, however, favors a single (disengaged) conformation for the loop, which cannot stabilize divalent cation association at the active site. Interactions between the loop and residues near the N terminus of an adjacent subunit play an important role in stabilizing the disengaged conformation of the loop (23Nelson S.W. Kurbanov F.T. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6119-6124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In addition to the absolute requirement for divalent cations, certain monovalent cations (K+ and Tl+ among others) further enhance catalysis by FBPase (3Benkovic S.J. de Maine M.M. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1982; 53: 45-82PubMed Google Scholar, 5Tejwani G.A. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1983; 54: 121-194PubMed Google Scholar, 13Zhang R. Villeret V. Lipscomb W.N. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3038-3043Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism by which monovalent cations exert their influence, however, has yet to be determined. Monovalent cation activation is in some fashion related to loop 52−72. Mutations of specific residues of the dynamic loop increase the K a for Mg2+, and without exception also abolish K+-induced effects on catalysis (25Nelson S.W. Choe J.Y. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29986-29992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar,26Nelson S.W. Iancu C.V. Choe J.Y. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11100-11106Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). On the other hand, K+ does not increase the fraction of subunits with an engaged loop in the presence of saturating Mg2+/F6P/Pi (26Nelson S.W. Iancu C.V. Choe J.Y. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11100-11106Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Hence, improved catalysis comes from a more stable transition state in the presence of K+. Previous work of Lipscomb and co-workers (27Villeret V. Huang S. Fromm H.J. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl., Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8916-8920Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) focused on the association of Tl+ and K+ with FBPase in the absence of divalent cations and/or in the presence of AMP. Under these conditions FBPase is inactive. Their investigation clearly shows the association of Tl+ and K+ at metal loci 1, 2, and 3, usually the observed binding sites for essential divalent activators. But how do monovalent cations interact with FBPase under conditions that support catalysis? Presented below are a series of product complexes of FBPase in the presence of Mg2+ and Tl+. FBPase here is co-crystallized from an equilibrium mixture of products and reactants, containing Mg2+ at a saturating concentration and Tl+ ranging from zero to 70-fold in excess of its observed K a value. Under these conditions of crystallization FBPase is active. In the presence of Mg2+, Tl+ no longer occupies metal sites 1 and 2, but interacts at four sites. Two of the four sites are mutually exclusive with Mg2+ at site 3, whereas Tl+interaction at two other sites could co-exist with Mg2+ at sites 1−3. F16P2, F26P2, NADP+, and AMP were purchased from Sigma. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoglucose isomerase were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Other chemicals were of reagent grade or equivalent. The FBPase-deficient Escherichia colistrain DF657 came from the Genetic Stock Center at Yale University. Expression and purification of FBPase followed the procedures of Burton et al. (28Burton V.A. Chen M. Ong W.C. Ling T. Fromm H.J. Stayton M.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (20Choe J.-Y. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8565-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). E. coli strain DF657, deficient in FBPase, was used in order to avoid contamination of recombinant FBPase by endogenous enzyme. Protein purity and concentration was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205463) Google Scholar) and by the Bradford assay (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (211739) Google Scholar), respectively. Crystals of FBPase were grown by the method of hanging drops. Crystals of R-state complexes grew from equal parts of a protein solution (10 mg/ml FBPase, 10 mmKPi, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm F6P, with or without 0.2 mm EDTA, in different concentrations of thallium acetate (0, 1, 5, 20, or 100 mm)) and a precipitant solution (100 mm Hepes pH 7.0, 5% t-butyl alcohol, 27% (v/v) glycerol, and 8% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350). Crystals of T-state complexes grew from 10 mg/ml FBPase, 10 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm of thallium acetate, 5 mm F6P, and 5 mm of AMP and a precipitant solution (100 mm Hepes pH 7.0, 5%t-butyl alcohol, and 10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350). The droplet volume was 4 μl. Wells contained 500 μl of the precipitant solution. Crystals with dimensions of 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.2 mm grew in 3 days at room temperature. Conditions of crystallization for R-state FBPase differ from those of previous studies (17Choe J.-Y. Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11441-11450Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 20Choe J.-Y. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8565-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and result in crystals that in some cases diffract to near atomic resolution (see below). Data from FBPase complexes with 20 mm Tl+ (T-state and R-state) were collected at synchrotron beam line X12C, Brookhaven National Laboratory, using a CCD detector developed by Brandeis University, at a temperature of 100 K. The energy (12658 eV) of x-rays coincided with the atomic absorption edge of Tl+. Data from the crystalline complex with 1 mm of Tl+ were collected at synchrotron beam line X4A, Brookhaven National Laboratory on an ADSC, CCD detector at a temperature of 100 K and an energy of 12658 eV. Data from the crystalline complex with 100 mm Tl+ were collected at synchrotron beam line 14BM, APS-BioCars, Argonne National Laboratory, on an ADSC, CCD detector at a temperature of 100 K and an energy of 12658 eV. Data from complexes, co-crystallized in the presence of 0.2 mm EDTA, the 5 mmTl+ complex without EDTA, and the Mg2+ complex without Tl+ and EDTA were collected on an R-AXIS IV++/Rigaku rotating anode at a temperature of 100 K, using CuKα radiation, passed through an Osmic confocal mirror system. Data from synchrotron sources were reduced and scaled by Denzo/Scalepack (31Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38231) Google Scholar). Data from the R-AXIS IV++ were processed with CrystalClear (32CrystalClear (2001) Rigaku Molecular Structure Corporation, Orem, Utah.Google Scholar). Crystals grown for this study are isomorphous to PDB code 1CNQ (R-state) or 1EYI (T-state). Structure determinations were initiated by molecular replacement using calculated phases from either1CNQ or 1EYI, less ligands and water molecules. Electron density maps were calculated using CNS (33Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges N. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crysallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16909) Google Scholar). For structures reported here, the anomalous data set was accepted only if it resulted in significant anomalous difference density at the positions of sulfur and phosphorus atoms. Modifications to structural models were done through XTALVIEW (34McRee D.E. J. Mol. Graphics. 1992; 10: 44-46Crossref Google Scholar). Models were refined against x-ray data using CNS with force constants and parameters of stereochemistry from Engh and Huber (35Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2533) Google Scholar). Final cycles of refinement used SHELX (36Sheldrick G.M. Gould R.O. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B. 1995; 51: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) with restraints on bonds and angle distances. The thermal parameter for Tl+ at a specific site was fixed to the average of thermal parameters for atoms of coordinating side chains. Occupancies of Tl+ were refined with SHELX, and confirmed in XTALVIEW against 2F obs−F calc omit maps and anomalous difference maps. Assays employed the coupling enzymes, phosphoglucose isomerase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (1Krebs H.A. Weber G. Advances in Enzyme Regulation. 1. Pergamon Press Ltd., London1963: 385-400Google Scholar). The coupling enzymes were dialyzed exhaustively in order to remove NH4+. Thallium acetate solutions were prepared immediately prior to their use in assays. Tl+ up to a concentration of 15 mm had no effect on the coupling enzymes. Assays were initiated by the addition of magnesium acetate (final concentration of 5 mm), instead of magnesium chloride, to avoid the precipitation of Tl+ by Cl−. The concentration of F16P2 in all assays was 20 μm. The reduction of NADP+ to NADPH was monitored by fluorescence emission at 470 nm, using an excitation wavelength of 340 nm, as described elsewhere (23Nelson S.W. Kurbanov F.T. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6119-6124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Concentrations of Tl+ were 0.0, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 5.0, 8.0, and 10.0 mm. All kinetic assays were performed at room temperature in triplicate. Initial rate data were fit using ENZFITTER (37Leatherbarrow R.J. ENZFITTER: A Non-Linear Regression Data Analysis Program for the IBM PC. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam.1987: 13-75Google Scholar). The Hill coefficient for Tl+ activation came from a least squares fit of the following shown in Equation 1, V=[VmSn/(Ka+Sn)]+3.0863Equation 1 where V is the observed initial velocity at a specific concentrations of Tl+, S is the concentration of Tl+, n is the Hill coefficient,K a is the affinity constant for Tl+, and 3.0863 is the initial velocity of the reaction in the absence of Tl+, based upon an average of five determinations. FBPase used here migrates as a single band on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and exhibits no evidence of proteolysis. A previous report regarding Tl+-activation of FBPase from mouse liver did not provide experimental details (38Marcus F. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2481-2486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and hence the phenomenon was re-investigated here. Tl+ does not influence the coupling enzymes of the assay system, so that the rate of formation of NADH is directly related to the rate of formation of F6P. The maximum level of Tl+-activation for the recombinant porcine enzyme is 20%, with a Hill coefficient of 1.15 ± 0.09 and aK a of 1.3 ± 0.1 mm. (TheK a for mouse liver enzyme is 16 mm). At Tl+ concentrations in excess of 15 mm, the specific activity of FBPase declines. Maximal K+-activation for the recombinant porcine enzyme under comparable assay conditions is 18% (26Nelson S.W. Iancu C.V. Choe J.Y. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11100-11106Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), with a Hill coefficient of unity and a K a of 17 mm (13Zhang R. Villeret V. Lipscomb W.N. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3038-3043Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Conditions of crystallization of R-state FBPase differ from those employed in past work (17Choe J.-Y. Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11441-11450Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 20Choe J.-Y. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8565-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) in two respects: (i) F6P2 replaces F6P/Pi, and (ii) glycerol is present as a cryo-protectant. Co-crystallization with substrate, rather than products, should not alter the results. The enzyme is active under the conditions of crystallization, and thus products and substrates should be at their equilibrium concentrations regardless of the starting conditions. The addition of glycerol (27%, v/v) and the reduced concentration of polyethylene glycol 3350 (from 10 to 8%, w/v), however, have resulted in an unexpected dividend. Crystals, grown in the absence of glycerol, exhibit a wide variation in x-ray diffraction properties after exposure to glycerol and rapid freezing in liquid nitrogen. Crystals soaked in glycerol are fragile and become disordered in 9 of every 10 instances. On the other hand, FBPase crystals grown in the presence of glycerol undergo rapid freezing with reproducible results. Under the new conditions of crystal growth, R-state FBPase crystals can diffract to 1.3 Å resolution (44Choe J-Y. Iancu C.V. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16015-16020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), whereas previous crystals exhibit diffraction to 2.3 Å. The co-crystallized Tl+ complexes reported below have a resolution limit of 1.8 Å. The reduced resolution probably arises from the combination of several distinct complexes within the same crystal that differ in their sites of Tl+-association. In all structures reported below, save the Tl+/Mg2+/AMP/product complex, FBPase crystallizes in the same space group (I222) and in isomorphous unit cells (Table I). The enzyme is in its R-state, with dynamic loop 52−72 in an engaged conformation, as defined previously by Zn2+/product complexes (17Choe J.-Y. Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11441-11450Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 20Choe J.-Y. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8565-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The side chain of Tyr57 in the engaged conformation occupies a hydrophobic pocket (26Nelson S.W. Iancu C.V. Choe J.Y. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11100-11106Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We observed no significant differences in the presence or absence of 0.2 mm EDTA. In the Tl+/Mg2+/AMP/product complex, FBPase adopts a T-state global conformation, with a disengaged loop 52−72 (20Choe J.-Y. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B.

Open table in a new tab Mg2+ is present in all complexes at 5 mm. Thallium has been chosen over potassium in this study in order to detect metal binding at low occupancy. As noted above, K+and Tl+ have comparable effects on the function of FBPase. The choice of wavelength here optimizes anomalous scattering from Tl+ without introducing an anomalous signal from Mg2+. At an energy of 8040 eV (λ = 1.524 Å), thallium and magnesium have f′ of −4.03 and 0.172 electrons, respectively, and f“ of 8.12 and 0.177 electrons, respectively. At an energy of 12658 eV (λ = 0.979 Å), thallium and magnesium have f′ of −18.9 and 0.0876 electrons, respectively, and f” of 3.93 and 0.0714 electrons, respectively (41Pahler A. Smith J.L. Hendrickson W.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1990; 46: 537-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). (f′ and f“ are the real and imaginary components of anomalous scattering). On the basis of the above, magnesium contributes virtually nothing to anomalous scattering, and in fact no anomalous difference density appears at the metal-binding loci of Mg2+ complexes, even though distinct anomalous difference density appears at sulfur atoms (data not shown). Thallous ions bound at low fractional occupancy (0.1, for instance) may be mistaken for water molecules in electron density maps, but can be identified unambiguously in an anomalous difference map. Finally, if Mg2+ and Tl+ mutually exclude each other at a binding site, then anomalous scattering data allows a direct estimate of the Tl+ occupancy, and an indirect estimate of the Mg2+ occupancy at that site. Hence, the anomalous data eliminates much ambiguity in the interpretation of electron density associated with possible metal sites, and as presented below, reveals a far more complex set of interactions than had been suggested by previous studies (27Villeret V. Huang S. Fromm H.J. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl., Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8916-8920Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Data from improved crystals reveal electron density at site 3 consistent with Mg2+ and a coordinated water molecule (Fig. 1,top). Asp68 and Glu97 along with two oxygen atoms of Pi complete the inner coordination shell (square pyramidal geometry) of site-3 Mg2+. When assigned fractional occupancies of 0.5, thermal parameters for the Mg2+ and the water molecule at site 3 match those of nearby atoms of the active site. Fractional occupancies of 0.5 for residues 61−69 of dynamic loop 52−72 also result in thermal parameters that match those for other atoms of the active site. The water molecule coordinated to site-3 Mg2+ hydrogen bonds with the side chain of Glu98 and is close to the side chain of Asp74. Magnesium cations at sites 2 and 3 in combination with their coordinated water molecules, Pi, Asp74, Glu97, and Glu98, define an interconnected assembly of atoms with well defined geometry (Fig. 1). The 1-OH group of F6P coordinates the Mg2+ at site 1 and is in contact with the P atom of Pi (distance of separation approximately, 2.8 Å). Furthermore, the 1-O atom of F6P is equidistant (approximately, 2.7 Å) from three oxygen atoms of Pi. The angle defined by the 1-O atom of F6P, the P atom of Pi, and the remaining (distal) oxygen atom of Pi is 172°. The distal oxygen atom of Pi coordinates to Mg2+ at sites 2 and 3. The spatial relationships between the 1-OH group of F6P, the Mg2+ at site 1, and bound Pi are essentially identical to those reported in the previous Mg2+/product complex (20Choe J.-Y. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8565-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The Mg2+ at site 3 and its coordinated water molecule are probably important to the catalyti"
