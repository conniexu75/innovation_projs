https://openalex.org/W1983267585,"Absolute pollen deposition in a Connecticut lake over a 4000-year interval has been estimated from pollen frequencies in a core of late-glacial sediment dated by radiocarbon techniques. The rate of total sediment accumulation as measured after burial was statistically constant at 0.036 centimeter per year, but the rate of deposition of pollen grains onto the sediment increased from 600 to 900 grains 14,000 years ago to 9000 per square centimeter per year 10,000 years ago. A major increase in the deposition of tree pollen occurred about 11,500 years ago, at the beginning of the spruce pollen zone. Presentation of data in conventional (percentage) form masks the magnitude of this change and distorts many of the changes in accumulation rates for individual types of pollen; moreover it magnifies statistical variation in the herb zone where all pollen is scarce."

Irradiation of samples of the meteorite with thermal neutrons in a nuclear reactor, together with measurements of track-length distribution, indicate that some of the tracks result from the spontaneous fission of uranium impurities; others, however, are of different origin. Uranium concentrations, which ranged from about 4000 parts per million in a zircon grain to less than 10(-3) parts per million in hypersthene and anorthite, were also measured by irradiating samples with thermal neutrons."

https://openalex.org/W1965332264,"Eden-like strata near Maysville, Kentucky, may be correlated with the Eden and lower Fairview formations of Cincinnati. To avoid the name Eden, which has stadial connotation, these rocks are included in the Kope formation, defined as medium-bedded limy shales (mean clastic ratio, 2.5 to 3.8) resting conformably between shaly Point Pleasant limestones (mean clastic ratio, 1.0) and unnamed shaly limestones (mean clastic ratio, 0.5)."
https://openalex.org/W2048556258,"Triclinic ulexite crystals contain isolated borate polyanions [B(5)O(6)(OH)(6)](3-) related to the well known pentaborate polyanion [B(5)O(6)(OH)(4)](-) by addition of two hydroxyl groups to two opposite B-O triangles. The isolated ulexite polyanions form the [B(5)O(7)(OH)(4)](n)(3n-) chains previously found in crystals of the related mineral probertite, NaCaB(5)O(7)(OH)(4).3H(2)O."
https://openalex.org/W2032872695,"Leaf impressions from the Polarstar Formation in the northern Ellsworth Mountains are the first Glossopteris and the oldest identifiable plant fossils reported from West Antarctica. Their occurrence in a thick, probably marine, geosynclinal sequence in close association with coals and probable glacial deposits increases the similarity between the late Paleozoic history of Antarctica and the other southern continents."

https://openalex.org/W1975580584,"The oxygen isotopic composition of calcite from carbonate rocks of the lower unit of the Flagstaff formation (Paleocene) exposed along the western margin of the Wasatch Plateau, Utah, is about 7 per mil lower than that of coexisting dolomite, suggesting that isotopic equilibration of these two minerals can occur at relatively low temperatures. Unlike recent isotopic evidence presented by Degens and Epstein, the data do not preclude a primary chemical origin for the dolomite."
https://openalex.org/W2004915896,Liquid dioxane gives transient absorptions owing to the production of free radicals and solvated electrons when subjected to a pulse of high-energy electrons (4 million electron volts) for a duration of 2 microseconds. Solutions of benzophenone give the ketyl radical and ketyl radical ions. Solutions of anthracene give anthracene in the triplet state and the anthracene anion. The formation of these species is largely prevented when hydrochloric acid is present.

https://openalex.org/W2055316834,"Numerical integration of the orbits of the five outer planets over 120,000 years reveals that the distance between Pluto and Neptune at the closest approaches oscillates within a narrow range. The distance is never much less than the aphelion distance of Pluto from the orbit of Neptune. The near commensurability in the periods of Pluto and Neptune and the eccentricity of Pluto's orbit are responsible for the libratory motion."

https://openalex.org/W2079626472,"Within a few decades astronomy has extended the compass of its observations from the visible spectrum downward to radio waves and upward to the highest energies known to science. The major new accomplishments are in the radio and x-ray bands, and in the associated study of cosmic ray electrons. Synchrotron radiation is known to be a mechanism for radio signals; discrete x-ray sources have been found; the intensity and the charge ratio of galactic electrons are under study. Experimental results at energies above the x-ray region are less firm. The sun surely emits gamma rays at energies of about 1 Mev during flare activity, and instruments in deep space have probably recorded the general galactic glow of similar photons. Upper limits for fluxes have been set at 100 Mev and beyond."

https://openalex.org/W2099634067,"A new category of sensory transducers, electroreceptors, was to be inferred from the work of Lissmannl and Lissmann and Machine2,3 and was directly demonstrated by Hagiwara et al.,4−8 Szabo and Fessard,9,10 and Szaboll in electric fish. Three fresh-water families, the Gymnotidae from tropical America and the Gymnarchidae and Mormyridae from tropical Africa, with many species, all discharge low-voltage pulses from small electric organs more or less continuously into the water, apparently useful in detecting objects, cavities, other fish, and as social signals to each other. The diversity of form of discharge is important. Some gymnotids and perhaps all mormyrids discharge at low (ca. 0–5/sec), irregular frequencies, rising (to 30–100/sec) with excitement. Other gymnotids and the only known gymnarchid discharge at high (300–>1000/sec), regular, species-characteristic, and nearly invariant frequencies. Several gymnotids are intermediate, including the subject of this communication."
