https://openalex.org/W1658581991,"The ability of hepatic plasma membranes to bind desialylated glycoproteins as a prelude to transport and catabolism has been reported earlier. The present study describes the purification, by affinity chromatography, of an hepatic protein which retains the characteristic binding properties associated with the membranes. The isolated material, which is watersoluble and free from lipids, has been identified as a glycoprotein in which 10 % of the dry weight consists of sialic acid, galactose, mannose, and glucosamine in a molar ratio of 1:1:2:2. The integrity of the terminal sialic acid residues and the presence of calcium were shown to be absolute requirements for binding. Physical chemical studies indicated a high degree of aggregation in the final, water-soluble preparation."

https://openalex.org/W1547220187,"Abstract A receptor for prolactin and other lactogenic hormones (human growth hormone and placental lactogens) has been solubilized by 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 from a crude particulate membrane fraction isolated from pregnant rabbit mammary glands. The receptor remained in solution after centrifugation at 200,000 x g for 2 hours. Triton X-100 at concentrations higher than 0.01% (v/v) affected the physical properties of 125I-prolactin, whereas 125I-human growth hormone (hGH) was unaffected and, therefore, the latter has been used in studies of binding to the prolactin receptor in situations where 125I-prolactin could not be used. It was possible to use 125I-hGH for binding studies because this hormone has the same lactogenic potency as prolactin does in the rabbit and the prolactin receptor cannot discriminate between these two hormones. When an aliquot of soluble receptor protein was incubated with 125I-hGH, the hormone-receptor complex was detected in the void volume of Sephadex G-100 column or, more rapidly, by precipitation with polyethylene glycol (12.5%, w/v). The soluble receptor retained the specificity of binding noted in the particulate fraction. However, Scatchard analysis demonstrated that the affinity of the soluble receptor (Ka = 16 x 109 m-1) for the hormone was 5 times greater than that of the particulate receptor (Ka = 3 x 109 m-1). The soluble prolactin receptor has been purified approximately 1500-fold by affinity chromatography using hGH-coupled N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of 3,3'-diaminodipropylaminosuccinyl agarose (Affi-Gel 10, Bio-Rad Laboratories). The receptor was labile in the presence of many of the commonly used dissociating reagents such as sodium thiocyanate, guanidine hydrochloride, and acetic acid. However, magnesium chloride (5 m) proved to be most effective for the elution of the receptor from the affinity adsorbent. About 0.5 mg of partially purified receptor protein could be obtained from 100 g of mammary gland. By gel filtration on Sepharose 6B the molecular weight of the receptor was found to be approximately 220,000. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (gel concentration 7.5%, w/v; pH 8.9) of the partially purified receptor revealed several protein bands. Upon assaying the material eluted from gel slices, the receptor activity coincided with one or possibly two of the major protein bands at Rf 0.12. These studies suggest that it is feasible to utilize the soluble receptor for the development of a very sensitive radioreceptor assay for prolactin and, further, to obtain a highly purified receptor in sufficient quantity to facilitate studies on its physiological, biochemical, and immunological properties."

https://openalex.org/W1551663746,"Abstract The major enzyme of Entamoeba histolytica which produces fructose 1,6-diphosphate from fructose 6-phosphate utilizes inorganic pyrophosphate as phosphate donor. In its reverse reaction the enzyme utilizes orthophosphate and fructose diphosphate to yield inorganic pyrophosphate and fructose 6-phosphate. The enzyme has been purified 100-fold from an amebal homogenate. At pH 7 with 2.5 mm MgCl the following Km values were observed: pyrophosphate, 14 µm; fructose 6-phosphate, 38 µm; fructose 1,6-diphosphate, 18 µm; and orthophosphate, 800 µm. At this pH and magnesium ion concentration the maximum velocity of the reaction was approximately the same in each direction. The average intracellular concentration of pyrophosphate in the ameba is 0.18 mm, a value 13-fold greater than the pyrophosphate Km for the new enzyme. This enzyme raises to three the number of known enzymes in the glycolytic pathway of E. histolytica which utilize or produce pyrophosphate. The trivial name proposed for the new enzyme is 6-phosphofructokinase (PPi)."
https://openalex.org/W1491866247,"Abstract The α-polypeptides of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase are known to be chemically modified within 4 min after infection by bacteriophage T4. This paper reports a crude system derived from T4-infected E. coli which will modify the α-polypeptides of purified E. coli RNA polymerase in vitro. The product of this in vitro reaction is identical with the modified α found in vivo; it differs chemically from the altered α observed after T4 infection in the presence of chloramphenicol. The in vitro reaction is rapid, being 50% complete within 30 s at 37°; the enzyme activity responsible appears less than 2 min after infection at 30°. These data on kinetics of synthesis and activity are consistent with data on kinetics of α modification in vivo. Specifically labeled radioactive substrates have been used in this in vitro modification reaction to investigate the chemical substitution introduced during α modification. The chemical stability of the modification and the sequence of pronase peptides containing the modified region of α also have been examined to complement the information obtained with the in vitro system. Modification involves covalent attachment of 1 adenine nucleotide, apparently adenosine diphosphoribose, to a specific arginine in the α-polypeptide at the sequence Thr-Val-Arg. NAD+ serves as the donor of this nucleotide in the in vitro reaction. The α modification is hypothesized to involve adenosine diphosphoribose linked through its terminal ribose to a guanido nitrogen of arginine."

https://openalex.org/W1578025307,"The effect of glucagon on the rate of gluconeogenesis from substrates not involving pathways of mitochondrial metabolism has been investigated in isolated rat liver cells. From estimation of the rates of glucose formation, glucose phosphorylation, fructose 6-phosphate phosphorylation, fructose 1,6-diphosphate dephosphorylation, and lactate and pyruvate formation, it is concluded that glucagon stimulates gluconeogenesis from galactose, dihydroxyacetone, xylitol, and fructose by influencing the rate of reactions involving fructose 6-phosphate. Both glucagon and cyclic adenosine 3′:5′-monophosphate act to inhibit flux through phosphofructokinase and enhance flux through fructose 1,6-diphosphatase. The simultaneous change produced by glucagon in expressed activity of each enzyme results in the redirection of carbon from lactate and pyruvate formation to glucose synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1890220389,"1. The role of cytochrome b5 in the oxidative metabolism of benzphetamine and 3,4-benzpyrene in the presence of NADPH was studied with the reconstituted hydroxylation system isolated from rat liver microsomes whose components were cytochrome P-450 or P-448, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, and lipid. In the absence of cytochrome b5, the turnover number for benzphetamine and 3,4-benzpyrene (nanomoles per min per nmole of P-450 or P-448) in the reconstituted system was at least as good as that in liver microsomes, indicating that cytochrome b5 is not an obligatory component in the NADPH-dependent benzphetamine or 3,4-benzpyrene hydroxylation system. 2. The addition of cytochrome b5 at a ratio of cytochrome P-450 to b5 normally found in microsomes inhibited NADPH-dependent benzphetamine N-demethylation by the three components (cytochrome P-450, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, and lipid). This inhibition was shown to be due to competition between cytochrome b5 and cytochrome P-450 for NADPH-cytochrome c reductase. The addition of NADH and cytochrome b5 reductase to the reconstituted system reversed the inhibition of NADPH-dependent benzphetamine N-demethylation by cytochrome b5. Thus, the NADH synergistic effect observed in liver microsomes with benzphetamine as the substrate and NADPH as electron donor could be due to NADH and cytochrome b5 reductase preventing the inhibition by cytochrome b5. 3. The addition of cytochrome b5 at a ratio of cytochrome P-448 to b5 normally found in microsomes did not inhibit the NADPH-dependent hydroxylation of 3,4-benzpyrene by the three components (cytochrome P-448, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, and lipid). In the presence of NADH, NADPH, cytochrome b5, cytochrome b5 reductase, and the three components, the rate of 3,4-benzpyrene hydroxylation was significantly increased. This increased rate was due to a NADH-dependent hydroxylation pathway via cytochrome b5 and cytochrome b5 reductase. 4. It is concluded that cytochrome b5 is not an obligatory component in the NADPH-dependent benzphetamine or 3,4-benzpyrene hydroxylation systems. However, this cytochrome plays an important role in regulating NADPH-dependent hydroxylation of these substrates and is also an essential component of the NADH-dependent hydroxylation pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1624094293,"Improved growth conditions were developed for normal strain 1A of Neurospora crassa in order to induce a high level of the NAD-specific glutamate dehydrogenase. A simplified purification procedure is described in order to obtain the enzyme in high yield and specific activity. The homogeneous enzyme has a molecular weight of 480,000 ± 27,000 by sedimentation equilibrium analysis, and is dissociable into four identical subunits of 116,000 ± 5,400 molecular weight. The amino acid composition of the enzyme was determined. Isophthalate was found to be a strong competitive inhibitor and an effective stabilizer of the enzyme. The molecular properties indicate that the subunit structure of this enzyme differs substantially from those of the glutamate dehydrogenases from vertebrates and of the NADP-specific enzyme from Neurospora."

https://openalex.org/W1601961717,"Abstract Agents that raise cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) levels in chicken embryonic fibroblasts increase cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase activity. Cyclic guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) phosphodiesterase activity is not increased indicating that these enzyme activities are under separate regulation. The increase in cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase activity requires cellular protein and RNA synthesis, and the regulation of induction probably occurs at the transcriptional level. The induced cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase activity is very unstable. The enzyme activity decays from the induced level with a half-life of 70 to 80 min. Increased enzyme activity is found in both the particulate and soluble cell fractions. The particulate enzyme can be solubilized by sonic disruption. DEAE-cellulose chromatography of the solubilized enzyme yields two fractions that hydrolyze cyclic AMP. Induction causes an increase in the activity of the second fraction. Neither of the particulate enzymes hydrolyze cyclic GMP. DEAE-cellulose chromatography of the soluble enzyme also yields two fractions. The first peak hydrolyzes both cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP and the second only cyclic AMP. Induction increases the activity of the second fraction. Chicken embryonic fibroblasts thus contain mechanisms for effectively modulating cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase activity via protein synthesis and enzyme turnover. Cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase activity is not affected by this regulatory scheme."
https://openalex.org/W1493214276,"Abstract With use of a discontinuous sucrose density gradient centrifugation in the presence of 1 mm EDTA and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, membrane particles were prepared from beef renal medulla that are 4- to 6-fold enriched in fluoride- sensitive and 8- to 12-fold enriched in neurohypophyseal hormone (NHH)-sensitive adenylyl cyclase activity. Average yield of the NHH-sensitive adenylyl cyclase activity was 30 to 35%; average yield of membrane protein, starting with 80 g of beef renal medulla, was 200 to 250 mg. These membranes also contain a prostaglandin-sensitive adenylyl cyclase system, the activity of which is additive to that sensitive to NHH. Arginine-vasopressin, lysine-vasopressin, and oxytocin stimulate enzyme activity half-maximally at 10-9, 10-9, and 10-7 m, respectively. The response of the renal medullary adenylyl cyclase activity to NHH is extremely dependent on the concentrations of magnesium and ATP used in the assay. Response is maximal at low concentrations of magnesium and at concentrations of ATP varying from 0.07 to 0.10 mm. Increasing the concentration of magnesium results in selective stimulation of basal activity with concomitant loss of the relative stimulation by NHH. Increasing or decreasing the concentration of ATP results in selective loss of activity due to NHH stimulation, also leading to reduced relative stimulation by NHH. GTP at 10-5 m inhibits stimulation of the beef renal medullary adenylyl cyclase by NHH. 5'-Adenylyl-imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP), an analogue of ATP that is not hydrolyzed by membrane ATPases, was evaluated as substrate for renal adenylyl cyclase. Depending on the concentration of the analogue and magnesium used, AMP-PNP yields activities that are between 10 and 25% of those obtained with ATP. Maximal hormonal stimulation requires higher concentrations of AMP-PNP than ATP; excess AMP-PNP does not result in inhibition of hormonal stimulation. Activities with the analogue exhibit higher pH optima than with ATP. The possibility that these differences in activity are due to a different exit rate of inorganic imidodiphosphate as compared to PPi or to the different divalent cation binding properties of AMP-PNP and ATP, or both, is discussed. The extreme sensitivity of hormonal stimulation to variations of nucleotide concentration, be it ATP or GTP, coupled to the relatively high yield of activity from beef renal medulla, make this preparation useful for the study of modes of regulation of hormonal stimulation of adenylyl cyclase systems. In addition, several minor modifications of the procedure of Krishna et al. (Krishna, G., Weiss, B., and Brodie, B. B. (1968) J. Exp. Ther. Pharmacol. 163, 379–385) for isolation and determination of cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP) formed during incubations for adenylyl cyclase are described. They result in higher yields of cAMP (60 to 65%) and in lower reaction blanks (0.0005 to 0.0010% of initially added ATP)."

https://openalex.org/W2015879577,"Different radioactive RNAs were injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes, and their degradation followed with time. Deproteinized ribosomal RNAs and synthetic polynucleotides, with the exception of polyadenylic acid, were degraded rapidly with apparent first order kinetics and half-lives ranging from 1–6 hr. Transfer RNA, poly(A), and ribosomal RNA injected as whole ribosomal particles were quite stable during the period studied (20 hr). Messenger RNAs from Dictyostelium discoideum and Vesicular Stomatitis Virus, which have poly(A) sequences at their 3′ terminus, presented biphasic degradation kinetics. Approximately 60% of these RNAs was degraded in the first 6 hr, whereas the remaining 30–40% was stable for at least 22 hr. Analysis of the stable material by sucrose gradients showed that it had the same sedimentation pattern as the original material, except that it contained, in addition, free poly(A) sequences sedimenting somewhat smaller than 4S. Puromycin treatment of the cells injected with Dictyostelium mRNAs reduced the percentage of stable RNA to 10%, approximately the poly(A) content of these RNAs. Similar treatment with emetine, which also inhibited cellular protein synthesis, did not affect the stable mRNA fraction."

https://openalex.org/W2099041217,"Abstract Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) contains a single structural glycoprotein in which the sugar sequences are largely host specified. We have used VSV as a probe to study the changes in cell glycoprotein metabolism induced by virus transformation. Analysis of purified VSV grown in baby hamster kidney (BHK) or polyoma transformed BHK cells showed that the virus glycoproteins have identical apparent molecular weights. The glycopeptides derived from the glycoproteins by extensive pronase digestion have an identical molecular weight distribution. On the basis of labeling experiments with fucose, mannose, and glucosamine, the oligosaccharide moieties of the VSV glycoprotein were different in virus from the two cell lines. The VSV glycopeptides from transformed cells showed an increased resistance to cleavage by an endoglycosidase, indicating structural changes in the core region of the oligosaccharides. They also showed an increased ratio of sialic acid to N-acetylglucosamine. VSV grows in a wide variety of cell types, and the carbohydrate structures of its single glycoprotein are amenable to analysis with specific glycosidases. The virus thus provides an excellent tool with which to study alterations induced by cell transformation in the glycosylation of membrane proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1556082980,"The DPN-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase has been purified from pig heart by ion exchange chromatography and gel filtration. The resultant preparation exhibits a single polypeptide band, with a molecular weight of about 40,000, on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, suggesting that the enzyme is in a homogeneous state. The amino acid composition of this polypeptide chain is reported. In contrast, polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis of the enzyme preparation in the absence of denaturing reagents reveals a multiple protein pattern, with more than one enzymatically active species. The addition to the electrophoresis buffer of the substrate, isocitrate and manganous ion, or the allosteric activator, ADP, alters the protein pattern so that there is one major protein band. The multiple protein pattern observed in polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis thus appears to reflect different forms of the same enzyme. Isocitrate dehydrogenase becomes inactivated upon incubation at 4°; however, this cold inactivation can be reversed by incubation at 25° with isocitrate and manganous ion. Electrophoresis of the cold-inactivated preparations yields an increase in the protein species with faster mobility than the major enzyme band. It is proposed that at least part of the heterogeneity observed on electrophoresis of isocitrate dehydrogenase is attributable to cold inactivation occurring during the isolation procedures."

Pyridoxal 5′-phosphate inhibited the enzyme rapidly and reversibly, resulting in the formation of 4 to 4.5 residues of e-N-(5′-phosphopyridoxyl)lysine per subunit, as determined after NaBH4 reduction. The enzyme was inactivated irreversibly by cyanate, to form a product containing 8 residues of homocitrulline per subunit. Sulfhydryl-directed reagents including p-mercuribenzoate, N-ethylmaleimide, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate), o-iodosobenzoate, and 2-nitro-5′-thiocyanobenzoate, inactivated the enzyme to a varying degree depending on the structure of the S substituent. The stoichiometry was one thiol modified per subunit by methods of activity titration, radioactive label incorporation, and spectrophotometric analysis. Tetrathionate produced an intermolecular disulfide, retaining almost full enzymic activity. No reaction was detected with either iodoacetate or iodoacetamide. Monoalkylation with N-ethylmaleimide did not alter the Vmax of the enzyme, but increased the value of Km toward both substrate and coenzyme. Consecutive modification of the sensitive amino and sulfhydryl groups indicated mutual independence of their reactivities. The chemical characteristics of the enzyme are compared with those of other glutamate dehydrogenases, including the NADP-specific enzyme from the same organism."

The method results in a 30% over-all recovery, and avoids exposure of the protein to low pH or to perchlorate. When saturated with heme, the electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum of hemopexin is characteristic of low spin Fe(III) in an asymmetrical environment, with principal values of the g tensor of 2.89, 2.27, and 1.55. This is confirmed by static magnetic susceptibility measurements which show good agreement with Curie's law in the temperature range 1.5–77 K. A ligand field analysis of the g tensor indicates that the axial and rhombic distortion parameters are typical of a low spin ferriheme complex in which both apical sites are occupied by histidine residues."
https://openalex.org/W1564704506,"Abstract At the ends of bacteriophage P2 DNA, the 5'-terminated strands are 19 nucleotides longer than the 3'-terminated strands. The complete nucleotide sequence of the two cohesive ends of P2 DNA has been determined. This was accomplished by repair synthesis, using Escherichia coli DNA polymerase and labeled deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates with or without a ribonucleoside triphosphate, followed by partial enzymatic digestions of the labeled segments and sequence analysis of the isolated oligonucleotides. Starting from the 5' end of one cohesive end, the 19 nucleotides are in the sequence dpGpTpGpCpTpTpTpCpCpCpCpGpCpCpTpCpGpCpC. The sequence from the other cohesive ends is exactly complementary to this one. The underlined bases differ from the sequence of the corresponding cohesive end of bacteriophage 186 DNA. Thus, DNA molecules from two related phages can form mixed dimers and help each other in infectivity assay even though the cohesive end sequences are not identical. The functional and thermodynamic significance of these findings is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1513506044,"Abstract The electron transfer kinetics between horse heart ferricytochrome c and ferrohexacyanide in the pH range 5 to 7 is essentially the same as the corresponding kinetics for the pH range 7 to 10. The equilibrium constant, computed from the ratio of rate constants is slightly under 300 for the range investigated. Spectrophotometrically (5 to 20 min after mixing), a somewhat different result emerged. The value of the equilibrium constant (with ferrohexacyanide in the numerator) increased about 2 times for a pH decrease from 7.0 to 5.0. A small minimum is indicated at pH 6.5. There is some similarity between this equilibrium behavior and the one found for the range above pH 7. If one accepts the previously established apparent pKh of 6.0 for ferricytochrome c, one arrives at a protonic dissociation for ferrocytochrome c of about 5.4. However, both of them should be considered upper limits. Lower limits are 5.0 for ferricytochrome c and 4 (or less) for ferrocytochrome c. The enthalpy change of the fast electron transfer process is in the range of 14 Cal per mole and shows practically no pH dependence. The differences between the kinetic and the spectrophotometric equilibrium constants are probably due to the fact that slow structural rearrangements are coupled to the electron transfer. Such steps also may be the reason for the fact that the measured rate constants are practically independent of pH. Various control experiments were conducted, to establish the constancy of the spectral characteristics of reduced and oxidized cytochrome c between pH 5 and 7 and in the wavelength range 520 to 555 nm."
https://openalex.org/W1555760915,"Abstract Activation of the beef renal medullary adenylyl cyclase system by submaximally stimulating concentrations of neurohypophyseal hormones (NHH) is a time-dependent process that requires several minutes to reach completion. This time dependency expresses itself in the appearance of lag periods in progress curves describing the time courses of hormone-induced cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate accumulation. Analysis of the extent (duration) and form (function describing the curvature) of these lags as a function of varying concentrations of the NHH [Arg8]vasopressin, indicated that the experimental data fit a model of adenylyl cyclase activation in which (a) the rate-limiting step of the hormone-dependent activation is the formation of the hormone-receptor complex, (b) the hormone reacts with receptor on a one to one basis, and (c) the function coupling receptor occupation to adenylyl cyclase activation is linear. Simulation of progress curves obtained with the NHH oxytocin using the same model agreed well with experimental data obtained at submaximally stimulating concentrations of hormone but predicted a maximally stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity that was 20 to 25% lower than found experimentally, suggesting the existence of a small degree of negative cooperativity between receptor sites. Apparent rate constants of association (k1) and dissociation (k2) of [Arg8]vasopressin and oxytocin to and from the NHH receptor were estimated using the above assumptions and led to the following values for [Arg8]vasopressin: k1 = 3.22 x 106 m-1 s-1, k2 = 703 x 10-3 s-1; for oxytocin: k1 = 8.69 x 104 m-1 s-1, k2 = 11.5 x 10-3 s-1. Thus, the main kinetic difference between the receptor-[Arg8]vasopressin interaction (apparent Ka = 1 to 2 x 10-9 m) and the receptor-oxytocin interaction (apparent Ka = 0.8 to 1.2 x 10-7 m) appears to lie in the rate at which these hormones associate to their receptor. GTP was found at 10-5 m to accelerate the rate at which the beef renal medullary adenylyl cyclase is stimulated by submaximally stimulating concentrations of [Arg8]vasopressin or oxytocin, presumably by accelerating the rates at which these hormones interact with the NHH receptor. The potential usefulness of the approach used here to study kinetic parameters of hormone-receptor interactions as a tool for validating a hormone binding assay as a receptor assay is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2077189456,"Abstract In studies of the viral and cellular functions involved in expression of transformation by murine sarcoma virus, selective methods have led to the isolation of morphologic revertants following mitomycin C mutagenization of nonproductively transformed mouse cells. The revertants exhibit normal growth properties, yet still contain the sarcoma virus. Further, they are as susceptible as normal cells to exogenous sarcoma virus infection. In the present studies, these revertants are shown to contain levels of sarcoma viral RNA quantitatively and qualitatively indistinguishable from that present in the parental transformed clone. Following rescue with helper leukemia virus, they release low levels of wild-type transforming virus and a large excess of transformation-defective sarcoma virus as measured by molecular hybridization. The defective viruses can be transmitted to new cells in the absence of morphologic alteration. These results provide strong evidence that the revertants contain mutant viruses defective in transforming functions. The release of wild-type sarcoma virus by cells in a revertant culture appears to occur concomitantly with the spontaneous appearance of retransformed cells. This suggests that the reversion of mutant virus to wild-type within the cell occurs as a result of reversion of a point mutation in the integrated sarcoma viral genome. The present sarcoma virus mutants appear to be the first obtained by spontaneous or chemically-induced genetic alteration of stably integrated virus in eucaryotic cells."

Treatment of the synthetase with guanidine HCl and alkylation with iodoacetamide prior to exposure to sodium dodecyl sulfate did not affect the range in size of the pantothenate-containing subunit.

Inactivation of the modified enzyme with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate followed by reduction with NaBH4 resulted in the preferential labeling of 4 to 4.5 lysine residues per subunit. Tryptic hydrolysis of the doubly labeled enzyme yielded a single radioactive peptide containing a S-(N-ethyl[14C]succinimido)cysteine residue, and its sequence was identified as Val-Leu-Cys*-Asp-Asp-Thr-Asn-Val-Thr-Leu-Pro-Asp-Gly-(Val,Gln,Asn)-His-Gly-Thr-Ala-Phe-Arg.

https://openalex.org/W1481925275,"Abstract Chromatophores of Rhodospirillum rubrum catalyze a Pi-PPi exchange reaction in the dark. This reaction was inhibited by uncouplers of phosphorylation and ADP, and was stimulated by oligomycin. An energized state is therefore participating in this reaction. Methylene diphosphonate and fluoride which are inhibitors of the membrane-bound inorganic pyrophosphatase also inhibited and thus the reaction appears to be catalyzed by the pyrophosphatase. The Km for Pi was high (48 mm). For comparison, the PPi-Pi exchange reaction catalyzed by yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase was studied. Very high Pi and Mg2+ concentrations were required and, as expected, uncouplers had no effect on the reaction with the yeast enzyme. Under similar conditions the ratio of the exchange reaction to the hydrolytic reaction was considerably greater in chromatophores than with the yeast enzyme and this probably reflects the contribution of the energized state. The mechanism of the exchange in chromatophores is postulated to be due to the dynamic reversal of the energylinked hydrolytic reaction [see PDF for equation] where ∼x represents the energized state in general."

The steady state (EPR-silent) molybdoferredoxin and the EPR-positive form of molybdoferredoxin isolated from cells in the presence of dithionite were oxidized with a 1.3-fold excess thionin and the numbers of electrons transferred to thionin were calculated. It was found that the EPR-silent molybdoferredoxin species formed by incubation with azoferredoxin, MgATP, and dithionite held 4 more transferable electrons per tetramer (2 more per dimer) than EPR-positive molybdoferredoxin. Oxidized azoferredoxin could be reduced by reduced ferredoxin, whereas oxidized molybdoferredoxin could not be reduced by reduced ferredoxin unless both azoferredoxin and MgATP were present. A reduction scheme for N2 fixation is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1516052645,"Abstract The reaction of α-chymotrypsin with N-acetyl-l-phenylalanine methyl ester has been studied using subzero temperatures and 65% aqueous dimethylsulfoxide as solvent. Since this substrate is essentially transparent in the region of tryptophan absorption (290 nm), the reaction was monitored by measuring the fluorescence emission of the enzyme. By initiating the reaction at -80 or -90° (in the pH range 4 to 7.5), three sequential reactions could be detected as the temperature was progressively raised. The first reaction was attributed to binding of substrate, the latter two to acylation and deacylation, respectively. Comparison of the fluorescence emission spectra of the products of these reactions with enzyme alone under identical conditions was made. The spectrum of the product of the first reaction differed only slightly from free enzyme, whereas the spectrum of the acyl-enzyme had a very substantially reduced emission intensity as well as a blue shift in λmax. The data suggest significant changes in the environment about 1 or more tryptophan residues in the acyl-enzyme as compared to the free enzyme or Michaelis complex."

https://openalex.org/W1987389245,"Abstract A somatic cell hybrid has been isolated between Chinese hamster fibroblasts (CH 23) and a mouse lymphoma (P388 F-36) cell line using nonselective pressure. The hybrid cell line PCM has a marked enhanced response to prostaglandin E 1 , in terms of cyclic AMP production, when compared to the parental cells. The activity of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase in both parental cells is higher than in the hybrid cells. Although this may contribute to the enhanced response in the hybrid cells, desensitization experiments suggest modification of the PGE 1 receptor in the hybrid cells."

https://openalex.org/W1590462631,"Abstract A particulate enzyme preparation from the fungus imperfectus Cryptococcus laurentii var. flavescens (NNRL Y-1401) catalyzes the transfer of galactosyl residues from UDP-[14C]-galactose to an endogenous acceptor. The radioactive reaction product is particle-bound, but is solubilized by pronase treatment. The solubilized radioactive material migrates as a single peak on a column of Sepharose 4-B, indicating that the galactosyl residues are transferred to an endogenous polymeric acceptor of high molecular weight. After elution from Sepharose 4B the material was found to contain 70% carbohydrate and 30% protein. The monosaccharides released after acid hydrolysis are mannose, galactose, and xylose, galactose being the only radioactive monosaccharide constituent. The radioactive reaction product is retained on DEAE-cellulose, from which over 80% of it is eluted with 0.5 m NaCl together with endogenous carbohydrate and protein. After treatment with NaOH-NaBH4, the radioactive material no longer binds to DEAE-cellulose. Subsequent gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 results in a symmetrical radioactive peak of approximately 2000 molecular weight, suggesting liberation of a dodecasaccharide chain. Treatment with NaOH-NaB3H4 followed by complete acid hydrolysis allows the isolation of tritium-labeled alanine and α-aminobutyric acid, indicating that carbohydrate side chains are linked through seryl and threonyl residues to protein. The major radioactive disaccharides isolated after partial acid hydrolysis are 6-O-α-[14C]galactosyl-O-[14C]galactose and O-β-[14C]-galactosyl-O-mannose. The data suggest addition of multiple galactosyl residues to an endogenous glycoprotein acceptor: the first galactosyl residue is linked to a mannosyl residue forming a β linkage; subsequently additional galactosyl residues are transferred sequentially forming linear chains containing 6-O-α-galactosyl-O-galactosyl linkages."
https://openalex.org/W2023259385,"NEOPLASMS may be induced in nonhuman primates after infection with Schistosoma haematobium (refs 1 and 2 and unpublished results of R. E. K., A. W. Cheever, B. J. Myers, S. W. Young and J. A. Moore). After various times, masses develop within the urinary bladders of the hosts, ranging from hyperplasia to papillary carcinoma as determined histopathologically. Although the basic mechanism of tumour induction in such cases is not known, the many factors involved could include stimulation of endogenous virus infections. It is therefore interesting that we have now found C-type viral particles in one out of four papillary carcinomas of capuchin (Cebus sp.) monkeys experimentally infected with S. haematobium. None were seen in two infected animals that developed only hyperplasia and squamous metaplasia. Previous examination of normal bladder tissue has failed to demonstrate similar C-type viruses. For electron microscopy and infection of the animals with S. haematobium we used published methods1,3,4. The bladders were taken from monkeys previously infected with S. haematobium (Table 1). Histological evaluation based on examination of biopsy samples is also provided (Table 1)."
