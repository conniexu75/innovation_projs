https://openalex.org/W2029326990,"Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) has been observed in relatively high concentrations in the mammalian brain and has been shown to act as a neuromodulator. However, there is confusion in the literature regarding the actual source of H<sub>2</sub>S production. Reactions catalyzed by the cystathionine β-synthase enzyme (CBS) are one possible source for the production of H<sub>2</sub>S. Here we show that the CBS enzyme can efficiently produce H<sub>2</sub>S via a β-replacement reaction in which cysteine is condensed with homocysteine to form cystathionine and H<sub>2</sub>S. The production of H<sub>2</sub>S by this reaction is at least 50 times more efficient than that produced by hydrolysis of cysteine alone via β-elimination. Kinetic studies demonstrate that the <i>K<sub>m</sub></i> and <i>K</i><sub>cat</sub> for cysteine is 3-fold higher and 2-fold lower, respectively, than that for serine. Consistent with these data, <i>in vitro</i> reconstitution studies show that at physiologically relevant concentrations of serine, homocysteine, and cysteine, about 5% of the cystathionine formed is from cysteine. We also show that AdoMet stimulates this H<sub>2</sub>S producing reaction but that there is no evidence for stimulation by calcium and calmodulin as reported previously. In summary, these results confirm the ability of CBS to produce H<sub>2</sub>S, but show in contrast to prior reports that the major mechanism is via β-replacement and not cysteine hydrolysis. In addition, these studies provide a biochemical explanation for the previously inexplicable homocysteine-lowering effects of <i>N</i>-acetylcysteine treatments in humans."

Here we describe the molecular analysis of CaMNT2, a second member of the MNT1-like gene family in C. albicans. Mnt2p also functions in O-glycosylation. Mnt1p and Mnt2p encode partially redundant α-1,2-mannosyltransferases that catalyze the addition of the second and third mannose residues in an O-linked mannose pentamer. Deletion of both copies of MNT1 and MNT2 resulted in reduction in the level of in vitro mannosyltransferase activity and truncation of O-mannan. Both the mnt2Δ and mnt1Δ single mutants were significantly reduced in adherence to human buccal epithelial cells and Matrigel-coated surfaces, indicating a role for O-glycosylated cell wall proteins or O-mannan itself in adhesion to host surfaces. The double mnt1Δmnt2Δ mutant formed aggregates of cells that appeared to be the result of abnormal cell separation. The double mutant was attenuated in virulence, underlining the importance of O-glycosylation in pathogenesis of C. albicans infections.

Mannoproteins of S. cerevisiae and C. albicans contain both N- and O-linked oligosaccharides. The N-linked glycans, attached to asparagine residues of proteins, contain a conserved core structure and an elaborate, highly branched outer mannose chain that is specific to fungi and contains both acid-stable and acid-labile components (17Gemmill T.R. Trimble R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 29Hercovics A. Biochim. Biophys.

Glycosylation in C. albicans has its own relevance in investigations of the role of specific oligosaccharide moieties in host-fungal interactions. The acid-labile mannosylphosphate component, containing β-1,2-linked mannose, has been implicated in adhesion and recognition of phagocytic leukocytes, although mutants lacking this component have been shown to have normal interactions with macrophages (31Hobson R.P. Munro C.A. Bates S. MacCallum D.M. Cutler J.E. Heinsbroek S.E.M. Brown G.D. Odds F.C. Gow N.A.R. J. Biol.

Both β-1,2- and α-1,2-linked mannan oligosaccharides have been implicated directly in adhesion functions (12Dalle F. Jouault T. Trinel P.A. Esnault J. Mallet J.M. d'Athis P. Poulain D. Bonnin A.

Hube B. Brown A.J.P. Odds F.C. Gow N.A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7670-7675Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 33Shibata N. Ichikawa T. Tojo M. Takahasi M. Ito N. Okubo Y.

Cell. 2002; 1: 420-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae an α-1,2-linked O-linked glycan is capped with one or two α-1,3-linked mannose residues (27Romero P.A. Lusssier M. Veroneau S. Sdidu A.M. Herscovics A. Bussey H. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1045-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). O-Glycosylation in S. cerevisiae is initiated in the endoplasmic reticulum where at least four of the seven-membered PMT gene family act to transfer mannose from dolichyl phosphate-activated mannose to serine or threonine (18Gentzsch M. Tanner W. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 35Gentzsch M. Tanner W.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5752-5759Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Five C. albicans PMT genes have been identified through the C. albicans sequencing project, of which two have been characterized (37Timpel C. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Ziegelbauer K. Ernst J.F. J. Biol.

Strains lacking CaPmt1p and CaPmt6p underglycosylate certain proteins in the cell wall, have reduced growth rates, are hypersensitive to a range of cell wall perturbing agents, exhibit defective yeast-hyphal morphogenesis and are attenuated in virulence (37Timpel C.

Although these studies on pmtΔ mutants confirmed that O-mannosylation is important for C. albicans virulence, it is not clear if these phenotypes are caused by misfolding of O-glycosylated proteins, whose structure may be affected by the first O-linked mannose residue or the absence of the mannose epitope. The addition of further mannose residues to the first O-linked mannose occurs in the Golgi and involves a range of mannosyltransferases. In S. cerevisiae Mnt1p (Kre2p), Ktr1p, and Ktr3p belong to a nine-membered gene family that have partially redundant roles in the addition of the second and third α-1,2-linked mannose residues. We previously isolated and analyzed CaMNT1, a gene that is part of a five-membered ScMNT1-like gene family in C. albicans (32Buurman E.T. Westwater C. Hube B. Brown A.J.P. Odds F.C. Gow N.A.R. Proc.

CaMnt1p is an α-1,2-mannosyltransferase that adds the second mannose residue to the O-linked glycan (32Buurman E.T. Westwater C. Hube B. Brown A.J.P. Odds F.C. Gow N.A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Camnt1Δ-null mutants display truncated O-glycans, altered cellular distribution of chitinase, reduced adherence to human buccal epithelial cells, are hypersensitive to the cell wall perturbing agent Calcofluor White and are attenuated in virulence in both guinea pig and mouse models of systemic infection (32Buurman E.T. Westwater C. Hube B. Brown A.J.P. Odds F.C. Gow N.A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7670-7675Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Heterologous expression of site-specific mutants of CaMnt1p in Pichia pastoris confirmed the nature of the nucleophilic reaction center and the conserved residues required for coordination of the metal ion cofactors essential for activity (39Thomson L.M.

The structure and mechanism of catalysis of this enzyme have recently been examined by crystallography revealing a novel mechanism for the interactions between the metal ion and the coordinating atypical DXD motif (40Lobsanov Y.D.

Here we describe a second member of the CaMNT gene family, MNT2, which encodes a protein with significant sequence similarity to the α-1,2-mannosyltransferases CaMnt1p, ScMnt1p, ScKtr1p, and ScKtr3p. We demonstrate that CaMnt2p is also an α-1,2-mannosyltransferase which, along with Mnt1p, is responsible for the addition of the second and third mannose residues in C. albicans O-glycans. Elimination of both Mnt1p and Mnt2p resulted in truncation of O-linked glycans and reduction in virulence, indicating that these enzymes are important for normal interactions of C. albicans with its host. Strains, Media, and Culture Conditions—The C. albicans strains used in this study are listed in Table I.

Open table in a new tab Identification of CaMNT2—The CaMNT2 gene was originally identified before the C. albicans genome data base was available by PCR using degenerate oligonucleotides (5′-CCCGAATTCGCRTCNCCCCANCKYTCRTA-3′ and 5′-CCCGAATTCTAYMGNMAYATGGYMG-3′) that were designed to conserved regions of CaMNT1, ScMNT1, ScY-UR1, and ScKTR1. These generated two distinct products from genomic DNA, one from CaMNT1 and the other from CaMNT2. The cloned CaMNT2 fragment was used as a probe in colony hybridizations against partial EcoRI and HindIII genomic libraries in pBlueScript-KS (Stratagene). Two HindIII clones (2.2 kb, pEB101 and pEB102) were obtained, representing two distinct alleles distinguishable by the presence of a polymorphism at an EcoRI site, and one EcoRI clone (3.1 kb, pEB103). All three clones were sequenced completely on both strands and found to contain the entire CaMNT2 open reading frame. Disruption of CaMNT Genes—Disruption of CaMNT1 was described previously (32Buurman E.T. Westwater C. Hube B. Brown A.J.P. Odds F.C. Gow N.A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7670-7675Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Further disruptions were achieved using the Ura-blaster protocol (42Fonzi W.A. Irwin M.Y. Genetics. 1993; 134: 717-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) after which Southern analysis of genomic DNA was used to confirm correct integration of the disruption cassette. The HindIII and EcoRI library clones pEB101 and pEB103 were combined to generate plasmid pEB136, which contains a 3.8-kb fragment spanning from the HindIII site upstream of the CaMNT2 ORF 1The abbreviations used are: ORF, open reading frame; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; FACE, fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis; ES-MS, electrospray mass spectrometry. to the EcoRI site downstream (Fig. 1). The 1.8-kb BglII/PstI fragment of CaMNT2 was replaced with the hisG-URA3-hisG Ura-blaster cassettes from pMB-7 and p5921 (42Fonzi W.A. Irwin M.Y. Genetics. 1993; 134: 717-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To disrupt the entire region containing MNT1 and MNT2 the PstI/KpnI fragment containing these genes, and the intervening sequences was replaced with the PstI/KpnI fragment (32Buurman E.T. Westwater C. Hube B. Brown A.J.P. Odds F.C. Gow N.A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7670-7675Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) containing CaMNT1 3′-sequences (from the PstI site within CaMNT1 to the EcoRI site downstream). CaMNT1, CaMNT2, and the intergenic region were disrupted by two successive rounds of transformation (42Fonzi W.A. Irwin M.Y. Genetics. 1993; 134: 717-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

The CaMNT1 and CaMNT2 genes under the control of 1000 bp of upstream promoter sequence were subcloned into CIp10 and transformed individually into the Camnt1-Camnt2Δ double mutant to reconstitute heterozygous strains as controls.

To test for the presence of contaminating genomic DNA in the cDNA, PCR reactions were multiplexed using primers spanning the intron of the CaEFB1 (45Schaller M. Schafer W. Korting H.C. Hube B. Mol.

In Vitro Assay of Mannosyltransferase Activity—Mannosyltransferase enzyme activities were assayed in mixed membrane preparations of mid-exponential phase yeast cells as described previously (26Nakijama T. Ballou C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 72: 3912-3916Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 39Thomson L.M. Bates S. Yamazaki S. Arisawa M. Aoki Y. Gow N.A.R. J. Biol.

Assay mixtures contained 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.2, 10 mm MnCl2,64nm GDP-[3H]mannose (0.02 μCi; specific activity 6.4 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Biosciences), 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 50 μg of membrane protein, and 25 mm of either methyl-α-mannoside or methyl-α1,2-mannobiose as an acceptor. Triplicate reactions were performed for 1 h at 30 °C and were then passed through 0.6 ml of QAE-Sephadex anion exchange resin to remove unincorporated GDP-mannose. Radioactivity in eluted neutral products was counted and specific activities calculated. Metabolic Labeling of Glycans and Non-reductive β-Elimination— Yeast cells growing exponentially in YP 0.5% sucrose were labeled with d-[2-3H]mannose according to the method of Haüsler et al. (20Häusler A. Ballou L. Ballou C.E. Robbins P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6846-6850Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A 2.0-ml sample was inoculated into medium containing 1.85 MBq of d-[2-3H]-mannose (555 GBq mmol–1; PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Beaconsfield, UK) and incubated at 30 °C in a shaking incubator at 200 rpm for 90 min. O-linked glycans were β-eliminated with 100 mm NaOH for 16 h at room temperature. The reaction was neutralized with 150 mm HCl. Cells were removed by centrifugation at 11,600 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant containing the radiolabeled O-glycans removed and stored at –20 °C. Samples (50 μl) were analyzed by TLC and autofluorography. Thin Layer Chromatography—Samples for TLC were spotted onto Silica G-60 TLC plates (Whatman) and allowed to dry. TLC plates were developed by running twice in 6:8:5:8 ethyl acetate/butan-1-ol/acetic acid/water. For detection of d-[2-3H]mannose-labeled carbohydrates, plates were sprayed with En3Hance (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and labeled sugars visualized by autofluorography (Kodak BioMax XLS). To detect non-radiolabeled carbohydrates, plates were dried and stained by spraying with 0.2% (w/v) orcinol (Sigma) in 20% (v/v) aqueous sulfuric acid and baking at 150 °C for 5–10 min. To detect mannitol, plates were resprayed with 20% (v/v) aqueous sulfuric acid and visualized by charring at 200 °C. Standards for running alongside reductively β-eliminated glycans on TLC plates were prepared by reduction of 5 mg of α-1,2-mannobiose and α-1,3α-1,6-mannotriose (Dextra Laboratories Ltd, Reading, UK) with 0.25 m NaBH4 for 4 h followed by addition of 1 ml of 0.25 m acetic acid in methanol to destroy excess borohydride. The reduced standards were then desalted on a 1.25-ml column of AG50-X12 (Bio-Rad). Mannitol, Manα-1,2-mannitol, and Manα-1,3-Manα-1,6-mannitol (Sigma) were dissolved in 40% (v/v) propan-1-ol and used as standards. Preparation of Yeast Cell Walls—Cell walls were prepared by a method modified from Hughes et al. (47Hughes H.B. Carzaniga R. Rawlings S.L. Green J.R. O'Connell R.J. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 1927-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Cells from a 24-h culture (50 ml) grown at 30 °C in YPD were washed twice by centrifugation in water. The cell pellet was resuspended in 25 ml of 0.2 m sucrose, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2 containing protease inhibitor (Complete Mini, Roche Applied Science), and frozen overnight at –80 °C. The cells were then disrupted by three passages through an X-Press homogenizer (AB Biox, Järfälla, Sweden) cooled to –80 °C. The disrupted sample was defrosted and cell breakage checked microscopically. Cell walls were recovered by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 10 min at room temperature and resuspended in 50 ml of 0.1% Triton X-100 in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, to remove membranes. Cell walls were then washed twice in 50 ml of milliQ water and stored as pellets at –20 °C. Reductive β-Elimination of O-Linked Carbohydrate from C. albicans Cell Walls—Cell walls were washed three times in 10 ml of milliQ water. O-glycans were reductively β-eliminated in 5 ml of 100 mm NaOH, 0.5 m NaBH4 in milliQ water for 16 h at room temperature in the dark on a reciprocating shaker. Cell wall material was removed by centrifugation at 4,600 × g, and the supernatant recovered. Excess borohydride was destroyed by the addition of 5 ml of 0.5 m acetic acid in methanol. PIR proteins (proteins with internal repeats) released by alkaline treatment (48Kapteyn J.C. Van Egmond P. Sievi E. Van Ende DenH. Makarow M. Klis F.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1835-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) were removed by precipitation overnight at –20 °C followed by centrifugation at 4,600 × g and passage of the supernatant through a 0.2-μm filter (Millipore). Samples were desalted by passing through 5 ml of Bio-Rad AG50W-X12 (Bio-Rad 142-1641, H+ form, preconditioned with 50% methanol) and eluted with 10 ml of milliQ water. Samples were frozen at –80 °C and lyophilized. Samples were resuspended in 2.5 ml of 5% (v/v) acetic acid in methanol and dried down twice at 60 °C under nitrogen and then extracted twice with 100% methanol to remove boric acid. Residual acetic acid was then removed by co-evaporation with 250 μl of toluene in a freeze-drier. The desalted O-glycans were resuspended in 1 ml of milliQ water and passed through a 1.25-ml column of Bio-Rad AG4-X4 (Bio-Rad 143-3341, converted to OH– form) followed by elution with 5 ml of milliQ water to remove any remaining anionic contaminants. The purified glycans were frozen, lyophilized, and finally resuspended in 1 ml of milliQ water. For TLC analysis, glycans were diluted to 40% (v/v) with propan-1-ol and samples (10 μl) applied to TLC plates. Following separation, carbohydrates were visualized by orcinol staining as described above. Mannosidase Digestion of Glycans—Approximately 10 μg of reductively β-eliminated O-linked glycan was lyophilized and resuspended in 20 μl of the appropriate buffer for digestion. Jack Bean mannosidase (11 milliunits) or Aspergillus satoi α1,2-mannosidase (10 μU) (Glyko) was added, and the reactions incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. Reactions were then diluted with 80 μl of milliQ water and desalted by passage through a column of 200 μl of Bio-Rad AG50W-X12 over 200 μl of Bio-Rad AG4-X4 and eluting with 2 ml of milliQ water. The samples were lyophilized and resuspended in 50 μl of 40% (v/v) propan-1-ol. Aliquots (10 μl) were analyzed by TLC and orcinol staining. Glycan Purification by Dionex HPAEC—Lipids were removed from the sample of reductively β-eliminated O-glycan using butyl alcohol and glycans were then dried and dissolved in milliQ water. Glycans were fractioned by Dionex HPAEC on a CarboPac PA-1 column (4 × 250 mm). The column was equilibrated with 100% 100 mm NaOH for 20 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. To separate the glycans, a linear gradient of 0–50% 200 mm sodium acetate in 100 mm NaOH was applied over a period of 40 min at a constant flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Glycans were detected by a pulsed-amperometric detector, and sodium ions were removed from the eluate on-line with a Dionex ASRS unit (49Ferguson M.A.J. Lipid Modification of Proteins: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1992: 191-230Google Scholar). Glycans were collected individually at the detector outlet and fully desalted on a small column containing AG50 (H+) over AG3 ("

Here, we demonstrate that S. mansoni eggs disjointedly activate myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-dependent and MyD88-independent pathways in DCs. Inflammatory cytokine expression and NF-κB activation in DCs from MyD88-deficient mice were impaired, whereas signaling transducer activator of transcription (STAT) 1(Tyr701) phosphorylation and ISG expression were intact in MyD88 or Toll-like receptor (TLR)4-deficient counterparts. Accordingly, we analyzed distinct TLR members for their ability to respond to schistosome eggs and established that TLR3 resulted in the activation of NF-κB and the positive regulatory domain III-I site from IFN-β promoter. Unexpectedly, egg-derived RNA possessed RNase A-resistant and RNase III-sensitive structures capable of triggering TLR3 activation, suggesting the involvement of double-stranded (ds) structures. Moreover, DCs from TLR3-deficient mice displayed a complete loss of signaling transducer activator of transcription 1 phosphorylation and ISG expression in response to egg-derived dsRNA. Finally, TLR3-deficient DCs showed a reduced response to schistosome eggs relative to wild-type cells. Collectively, our data suggest for the first time that dsRNA from a non-viral pathogen may act as an inducer of the innate immune system through TLR3.

During a microbial invasion, DCs play a central role in detecting foreign entities in their environment through a wide array of innate pattern recognition receptors and in modulating the succeeding immune/inflammatory responses by polarizing type 1 or type 2 responses or conversely by inducing tolerance to foreign and/or environmental antigen (3Kapsenberg M.L. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 984-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). Pathogenic organisms express evolutionarily conserved unique motifs that are recognized by distinct pattern recognition receptor families including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (4Janeway Jr., C.A. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 11-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). Activation of almost all TLRs results in signaling cascades that utilize a Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing adapter molecule myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-dependent pathway which converges on the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinases (5Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6669) Google Scholar). However, activation of TLR3 engages a MyD88-independent pathway, resulting in the expression of a subset of primary response genes. These include type I interferon (IFN)-β, induced by IFN regulatory factor-3 (6Kawai T. Takeuchi O. Fujita T. Inoue J. Muhlradt P.F. Sato S. Hoshino K. Akira S. J.

Upon TLR-4/TLR-3 triggering, secreted IFN-β instigates an autocrine/paracrine loop and leads to the phosphorylation of signaling transducer activator of transcription (STAT)1 at the Tyr701 residue (14Gao J.J. Filla M.B. Fultz M.J. Vogel S.N. Russell S.W. Murphy W.J. J.

Relative to viruses, bacteria, and intracellular parasites, only a limited amount of work has been done on the role of TLRs in DC activation in response to extracellular pathogens, including helminths. Using high density oligonucleotide microarrays, we have recently demonstrated that the egg stage of the metazoan parasite Schistosoma mansoni activates the transcription of many genes in myeloid DCs including those encoding cell surface markers (CD40 and CD86), inflammatory (TNF-α), and immunoregulatory (IL-12p40) cytokines as well as ISGs (16Trottein F. Pavelka N. Vizzardelli C. Angeli V. Zouain C.S. Pelizzola M. Capozzoli M. Urbano M. Capron M. Belardelli F. Granucci F. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 3011-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This signature is highly evocative of a TLR dependence. Although the effects of Schistosoma live eggs on TLR activation have not been studied so far, recent studies have reported the involvement of distinct TLRs in DC activation in response to certain egg components. Indeed, two egg-derived components, the glycolipid lysophosphatidylserine and the carbohydrate determinant lacto-N-fucopentaose III, have been shown to activate TLR2 and TLR4, respectively, in myeloid DCs (17van der Kleij K.D. Latz E. Brouwers J.F. Kruize Y.C. Schmitz M. Kurt-Jones E.A. Espevik T. de Jong E.C. Kapsenberg M.L. Golenbock D.T. Tielens A.G. Yazdanbakhsh M. J. Biol.

Immunol. 2003; 171: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In the present work we aimed to investigate the involvement of TLRs in DC activation in response to live eggs. We showed that schistosome eggs activate a MyD88-dependent and a MyD88-independent pathway in DCs. Screening of distinct TLR members by transfection assays confirmed TLR2 (but not TLR4) activation but also demonstrated that TLR3, a TLR member known to recognize double-stranded (ds) RNA, is activated in response to eggs. In support of this hypothesis we show evidence that egg-derived, RNase A-resistant and RNase III-sensitive RNA structures activate TLR3-expressing cells. Finally, we found that egg dsRNA elicited STAT1 phosphorylation and ISG production in DCs via TLR3 engagement. Reagents and Plasmids—Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (from Escherichia coli serotype 055:B5) was from Sigma-Aldrich. Pam3CSK4 (S-[2.3-bis(palmitoyloxy)-(2-RS)-propyl]-N-palmitoyl-(R)-Cys-(S)-Ser-Lys4-OH) trihydrochloride was from EMC Microcollections (Tuebingen, Germany), polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (p(I:C)) was from Amersham Biosciences), R848 was from Cayla (Toulouse, France), CpG-A oligonucleotides were from Tib Molbiol (Berlin, Germany), and flagellin was kindly provided by J. C. Sirard (Institut Pasteur de Lille). N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methyl sulfate (DOTAP) was purchased from Roche Diagnostics. The reporter constructs for multimerized NF-κB and the positive regulatory domain (PRD) III-I site from the IFN-β promoter have been described. Plasmids encoding human TLR2, TLR3, and TLR4 were gifts from Y. Delneste (INSERM U564, Angers), TLR5 was from J. C. Sirard, and TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 were gifts from H. Wagner (Institute of Medical Microbiology, Munich, Germany). Mice—Female C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Iffa-Credo (l'Arbesle, France). The generation of MyD88-, TLR2-, TLR3-, and TLR4-deficient C57BL/6 mice has been described earlier (19Kawai T. Adachi O. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S.

Mice strains were bred in an animal facility (Centre de développement des Techniques avancées pour l'expérimentation animale, Orléans, France) in pathogen-free conditions. All experiments were performed according to institutional guidelines of the animal ethics committee of the Pasteur Institute, Lille, France. Bone Marrow-Dendritic Cell (BM-DC) Generation—DCs were generated from the BMs of wild-type (WT) or knock-out C57BL/6 mice as described previously (22Lutz M.B. Kukutsch N. Ogilvie A.L. Rossner S. Koch F. Romani N. Schuler G. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 223: 77-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (2502) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% of supernatant from a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-expressing cell line (J558-GM-CSF). DCs were used on day 14 of culture (95% pure, as assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis). Preparation of Live Eggs and Egg-derived RNA—S. mansoni eggs were obtained from the liver of infected golden hamsters after portal vein perfusion. The absence of contaminating hamster tissue fragments in the egg preparation was verified by microscopic analysis. The absence of endotoxin (below 0.015 enzyme units/ml) in the parasite preparations (1 × 105 parasites/ml) was analyzed by a Limulus test (Sigma-Aldrich). Total RNA from whole eggs was isolated according to manufacturer's specification (RNAPlus 3, Qbiogen) and was routinely pretreated with RNase-free DNase I (50 units of DNase I/100 μg of RNA) (Roche Applied Science) at 25 °C for 2 h. Total RNA was either pretreated with RNase A (1 μg/μg of RNA) or with RNase III (1 unit/μg of RNA) (New England Biolabs, Leusden, The Netherlands) in the buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol for 2 h at 37 °C (final volume, 50 μl). As a control, total RNA was also treated with RNase A in low salt condition (RNase-free H2O). Enzymatic activities were stopped by heat deactivation at 55 °C for 30 min after each treatment. Cellular Activation Assays—BM-DC (1 × 106 cells/ml) were stimulated with live eggs (1/200 cells), Pam3CSK4 (0.5 μg/ml), p(I:C) (10 μg/ml), or LPS (100 ng/ml) or were left untreated. The conditions for RNA-DOTAP complexation were previously described (23Heil F. Hemmi H. Hochrein H. Ampenberger F. Kirschning C. Akira S. Lipford G. Wagner H. Bauer S. Science. 2004; 303: 1526-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (3036) Google Scholar) with a minor modification as 5 × 105 human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were stimulated in 500 μl of complete medium. As controls, DOTAP or p(I:C)-DOTAP complexes were included as described above. After 18–20 h, culture supernatants were collected, and IL-12p40 and TNF-α concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK). Cell death was assessed by trypan blue exclusion. Transfection Assays—HEK 293T parental cell line or cells stably expressing either TLR2, TLR3, or TLR4/MD2 were previously described (11Fitzgerald K.A. Rowe D.C. Barnes B.J. Caffrey D.R. Visintin A.

Cells were seeded in 48-well plates at a density of 5 × 105/ml overnight. The following day cells were transfected with 1 μg of indicated luciferase reporter plasmids or along with the indicated plasmids encoding a specific TLR using FuGENE™ 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's specification. All transfections included 40 ng of Renilla luciferase DNA in pRLTK vector (Promega, Leiden, the Netherlands) as an internal control. After cellular activation assays, cells were harvested, and promoter activities were analyzed using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) in a Packard Topcount NXT (Packard Instrument Co.). Promoter activities were normalized to Renilla luciferase activities. Data are expressed as the mean relative stimulation ± S.D. Real-time Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA from BM-DCs (1 × 106 cells/ml) was isolated, and cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA with random hexamer primers and Superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using standard procedures. For real-time RT-PCR, cDNAs were used as templates for PCR amplification using the SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) and the ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Primers specific for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, IFI204, and GARG39 (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase forward, TGCCCAGAACATCATCCCTG, and reverse, TCAGATCCACGACGGACACA; IFI204 forward, TGGCAGCTGAGGTCTGTAAGG, and reverse, CCAGAGAGGTTCTCCCGACTG; GARG39 forward, GCCATTGCGAACTACCGTCT, and reverse, ACCGCGTCAAGCTTCAGTG, respectively) were designed by the Primer Express Program (Applied Biosystems) and were used for amplification in triplicate assays. PCR amplification of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was performed to control for sample loading and to allow normalization between samples. Data are expressed as -fold increase compared with the expression level in unstimulated cells. Immunoblotting—BM-DCs (1 × 106 cells/ml) were collected and directly lysed in Laemmli sample buffer. An equal volume of the total cell lysate from each condition was resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted. Membranes were probed with a monoclonal anti-phospho-STAT1(Tyr701) antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA). To verify loading, immunoblots were reprobed with an antibody that recognizes nonphosphorylated STAT1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Boechout, Belgium). Immunoreactive bands were revealed using the ECL detection method (Amersham Biosciences). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay —Nuclear extracts from BM-DCs (1 × 106/ml cells) were prepared as described earlier (25Osborn L. Kunkel S. Nabel G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2336-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). The double-stranded binding oligonucleotides for consensus NF-κB were from Promega. The electrophoretic mobility shift assay for NF-κB was carried out as reported previously (26Van Lint C. Amella C.A. Emiliani S. John M. Jie T. Verdin E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6113-6127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—The statistical significance of differences between experimental groups was calculated using Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered as significant. Online Supplemental Material—Supplemental Fig. S1 shows egg-derived RNA fractions do not activate TLR2 or TLR4 stably expressing HEK 293T cells. MyD88 Is in Part Involved in DC Activation in Response to S. mansoni Eggs—The kinetic global gene expression analysis of mouse DCs suggested that S. mansoni live eggs activate DCs through TLR engagement (16Trottein F. Pavelka N. Vizzardelli C. Angeli V. Zouain C.S. Pelizzola M. Capozzoli M. Urbano M. Capron M. Belardelli F. Granucci F. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 3011-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We first aimed to analyze the contribution of MyD88, a critical adaptor molecule used by all TLRs (with the exception of TLR3) (27Takeda K. Kaisho T. Akira S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 335-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (4731) Google Scholar, 28Yamamoto M. Takeda K. Akira S. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 40: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) in the egg-induced DC activation. In addition, we investigated the role of TLR2 and TLR4, two TLR members recently described to be involved in the response to distinct S. mansoni egg components (17van der Kleij K.D. Latz E. Brouwers J.F. Kruize Y.C. Schmitz M. Kurt-Jones E.A. Espevik T. de Jong E.C. Kapsenberg M.L. Golenbock D.T. Tielens A.G. Yazdanbakhsh M. J. Biol.

Immunol. 2003; 171: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). For this purpose, BM-DCs generated from WT, TLR2-, TLR4-, or MyD88-deficient (-/-) mice were exposed to live eggs, and the production of IL-12p40 and TNF-α, two classical cytokines described to be produced in response to TLR engagement, was quantified. As depicted in Fig. 1A, LPS (a potent TLR4 agonist), Pam3CSK4 (a potent TLR2 agonist), and live eggs induce the secretion of both IL-12p40 and TNF-α. As previously demonstrated, compared with WT DCs, IL-12p40 and TNF-α production was abolished in TLR4-/- and TLR2-/- DCs in response to their cognate ligands. Similarly, LPS and Pam3CSK4 failed to induce IL-12p40 and TNF-α production in MyD88-/- DCs. In response to eggs, compared with WT DCs, the production of IL-12p40 and TNF-α by TLR2-/- DCs was not significantly modified, whereas MyD88 deficiency resulted in ∼75% decreased IL-12p40 and TNF-α production. In contrast, TLR4 deficiency did not influence the egg-induced production of these cytokines. We next analyzed the activation of NF-κB (29Karin M. Ben Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4073) Google Scholar) since it represents a common signaling pathway shared by all TLR members (27Takeda K. Kaisho T. Akira S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 335-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (4731) Google Scholar). As depicted in Fig. 1B, LPS, Pam3CSK4 and live eggs induce NF-κB nuclear translocation in WT DCs within 1 h post-stimulation. In comparison to their WT counterparts, NF-κB activation was abolished in TLR4-/- and TLR2-/- DCs in response to LPS and Pam3CSK4, respectively. In contrast, the lack of TLR2 or TLR4 in DCs did not modify NF-κB DNA binding mediated by schistosome eggs (Fig. 1B). In MyD88-/- DCs, LPS activated NF-κB, albeit with delayed kinetics, whereas Pam3CSK4-mediated NF-κB activation was abolished. After schistosome egg stimulation, NF-κB activation was strongly down-regulated at 1 h, but a substantial activation was still observed at 2 h in MyD88-/- DCs. As a whole, these data revealed that MyD88 is in part involved in the egg-induced NF-κB activation and IL-12p40 and TNF-α production by DCs. S. mansoni eggs Activate a MyD88-independent Pathway in DCs—We have previously reported that DC activation by schistosome egg exposure is characterized by a rapid production of bioactive IFN-β (16Trottein F. Pavelka N. Vizzardelli C. Angeli V. Zouain C.S. Pelizzola M. Capozzoli M. Urbano M. Capron M. Belardelli F. Granucci F. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 3011-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), a key mediator necessary for DC maturation in response to certain TLRs including TLR3 and TLR4 (by a MyD88-independent pathway) and TLR7-9 (by a MyD88-dependent pathway) (27Takeda K. Kaisho T. Akira S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 335-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (4731) Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that IFN-β production in response to eggs efficiently triggered the type I IFN receptor expressed on DC causing phosphorylation of STAT1 (Tyr701) with the consequent up-regulation of ISGs. Therefore, we investigated the contribution of MyD88 and TLR4 in STAT1 phosphorylation and ISG expression upon egg exposure. First, we analyzed the phosphorylation state of STAT1 in WT, MyD88-/-, TLR2-/-, and TLR4-/- DCs upon egg stimulation. As represented in Fig. 2A, eggs and LPS induced STAT1 phosphorylation in WT DCs, whereas, as previously demonstrated, Pam3CSK4 was ineffective (not shown). Although TLR2 and MyD88 deficiency did not modify the level of STAT1 phosphorylation induced by either eggs or LPS, TLR4-/- cells failed to trigger STAT1 phosphorylation in response to LPS, but not in response to eggs. Thus, the egg-mediated STAT1 phosphorylation does not involve TLR4- and MyD88-dependent pathways. Next, we examined the role of MyD88 and TLR4 in the egg-induced expression of two typical ISGs by real-time RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 2B, relative to untreated WT DCs, IFI204 and GARG39 mRNA levels were markedly increased 4 h after LPS or egg stimulation. In contrast, LPS failed to induce IFI204 and GARG39 mRNA synthesis in TLR4-/- but not in MyD88-/- DCs. Upon egg stimulation, DCs from either mouse strain were able to induce IFI204 and GARG39 mRNAs synthesis at a level similar to that observed in WT DCs (Fig. 2B). Taken as a whole, these data clearly demonstrate that eggs activate a MyD88-independent pathway in DCs that culminates in ISG production, independently of TLR4 engagement. S. mansoni Eggs Activate TLR3—To characterize the potential receptor(s) involved in schistosome egg recognition, HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding either TLR2, -3, -4, -5, -7, -8, or -9, and their ability to activate an NF-κB-containing promoter in response to eggs was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 3A, stimulation of TLR-transfected cells with their cognate ligands promoted NF-κB-mediated luciferase expression. After schistosome egg exposure, a substantial NF-κB activation was detected in TLR2- and TLR3-transfected cells but not in the other tested transfectants. To confirm these results and because the efficiency of stable transfectants is higher than that of transient transfectants, stable TLR2-, TLR3- and TLR4-expressing HEK 293T cells were used. As shown in Fig. 3B (upper panel), eggs induced a strong NF-κB-dependent luciferase expression in TLR2 (15-fold)- and TLR3 (5-fold)-but not TLR4-expressing cells. In addition, the ability of eggs to activate the PRDIII-I site from type I IFN-β promoter, which requires IFN regulatory factor-3 binding (30Fitzgerald K.A. McWhirter S.M. Faia K.L. Rowe D.C. Latz E. Golenbock D.T. Coyle A.J. Liao S.M. Maniatis T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2068) Google Scholar, 31Schafer S.L. Lin R. Moore P.A. Hiscott J. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2714-2720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), was further investigated. In accordance with the previous reports, stimulation of TLR3- and TLR4- but not TLR2-expressing cells by their cognate ligands resulted in PRDIII-I activation (Fig. 3B, lower panel). Compared with unstimulated cells, egg exposure induced a strong activation (15-fold) of the PRDIII-I element in TLR3 (but not TLR2 and TLR4)-transfected cells. These results indicate that live eggs selectively activate TLR2 and TLR3 but not the other TLR members tested. Double-stranded RNA from S. mansoni Eggs Is a Natural Ligand for TLR3—TLR3 was originally described as a pattern recognition receptor recognizing viral dsRNA (21Alexopoulou L. Holt A.C. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4908) Google Scholar) and certain single-stranded mRNA structures (32Kariko K. Ni H. Capodici J. Lamphier M. Weissman D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12542-12550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 33Kariko K. Bhuyan P. Capodici J. Weissman D. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 6545-6549Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that egg-derived RNA could activate TLR3. To do so, total DNase-treated RNA was prepared from eggs and tested for its capacity to activate NF-κB in HEK 293T cells stably expressing TLR3. Total RNA was delivered in the presence or absence of the cationic liposome DOTAP, which facilitates the uptake of RNA (23Heil F. Hemmi H. Hochrein H. Ampenberger F. Kirschning C. Akira S. Lipford G. Wagner H. Bauer S. Science. 2004; 303: 1526-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (3036) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, egg RNA complexed to DOTAP dose-dependently activated NF-κB transcriptional activity with a maximal capacity at 10 μg/ml. In addition, egg RNA alone also induced TLR3-specific NF-κB reporter activity, albeit with a lesser efficiency (Fig. 4A). It should be noted that the lack of responsiveness of cells expressing either TLR2 or TLR4 confirmed that the RNA fractions were free of endotoxin and other carryover contaminations resulting during RNA isolation (Supplemental Fig. S1). We next attempted to determine the nature of the RNA species responsible for TLR3 stimulatory ability by analyzing the effects of different types of RNases on total egg-derived RNA. To this end, total egg RNA was subjected to treatments either by E. coli RNase III, a dsRNA-specific enzyme homologous to Dicer that effectively cleaves and processes double strand-containing RNA structures or by RNase A, an endoribonuclease that degrades primarily single stranded RNA but can as well process dsRNA structures in low salt concentrations (34Danin-Kreiselman M.

https://openalex.org/W1991528589,"To identify putative tumor suppressor genes in hepatocarcinogenesis, we combined the representational difference analysis and reverse northern blot identifying downregulated genes in human hepatoma tissues. One of them was Dkk-3/REIC. Dkk-3/REIC was downregulated in 11 out of the 20 human hepatoma tissues as compared to their counterparts of noncancerous liver tissues by northern blot analysis. It was also downregulated in 29 out of 48 human cancer samples including the kidney, urinary bladder, prostate, pancreas and lung cancers. Its gene product, Dkk-3/REIC, was found to be N-glycosylated and have two isoforms, the 55 kDa in the cytosol and 50 kDa secreted in the medium. Ectopic expression of Dkk-3/REIC in HeLa, Hep3B and Huh 7 cells led to suppression of cell growth, which was primarily attributable to induction of cell apoptosis. The suppression phenomenon was found to be cell-type related (most prominent in HeLa and least in Hep3B cells) and cell-density dependent (attenuated as the cell density increased). Transduction of Dkk-3/REIC into HeLa and Hep3B cells caused suppression on colony formation in vitro and reduced tumor growth rate in inoculated athymic nude mice. In conclusion, these data indicate that Dkk-3/REIC functions as a suppressor for human tumor growth."
https://openalex.org/W2016949180,"Repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) by the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway in mammals requires at least the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) and the DNA ligase IV-XRCC4 protein complexes. DNA-PK comprises the Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer and the catalytic subunit DNA-PKcs. Here we report the first description of the nuclear mobilization of endogenous NHEJ proteins after exposure of human cells to double strand-breaking agents. DSB infliction specifically induced a dose- and time-dependent mobilization of Ku70/80, DNA-PKcs, XRCC4, and DNA ligase IV proteins from a soluble nucleoplasmic compartment to a less extractable nuclear fraction. XRCC4 recruitment was accompanied by its DNA-PK-dependent phosphorylation. The recruited proteins co-immunoprecipitated, indicating that they had assembled into complexes. However, DNA-PK was attached to chromatin, whereas XRCC4-ligase IV resisted solubilization by DNase I. The rates of appearance and dissolution of NHEJ proteins paralleled that of histone variant H2AX phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. We established that under conditions of genomic DSB infliction 1) Ku recruitment was not dependent on the co-recruitment of the other NHEJ proteins, 2) DNA-PKcs was physically required for the mobilization of the XRCC4-ligase IV complex, 3) DNA ligase IV was physically necessary for stable recruitment of XRCC4, and 4) phosphorylation of either H2AX or XRCC4 was unnecessary for DNA-PK or XRCC4-ligase IV recruitment.

Repair of the DSBs is critical for the maintenance of genomic integrity since improperly repaired breaks can lead to cancer via chromosomal aberrations (1Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1998; 396: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (3341) Google Scholar, 2Mills K.D. Ferguson D.O. Alt F.W. Immunol. Rev. 2003; 194: 77-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, DSBs are repaired through two distinct pathways: homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) (3Jackson S.P. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar, 4van Gent D.C. Hoeijmakers J.H. Kanaar R. Nat. Rev.

Biol. 2003; 74: 159-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). NHEJ, the major pathway in mammalian cells, requires several factors that recognize and bind the DSBs, catalyze the synapsis of the broken ends, and then process and reseal the break (6Lees-Miller S.P. Meek K. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 1161-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 7Lieber M.R. Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 712-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Major insights into the mechanism of NHEJ have been gained from in vitro assays with cell-free extracts or purified native or recombinant components. NHEJ repair of a DNA break is initiated by loading of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). DNA-PK consists of a regulatory subunit, the Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer, that recognizes and binds to DNA ends and a catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs or p460) that exhibits serine-threonine kinase activity (8Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 9Lees-Miller S.P. Chen Y.R. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6472-6481Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The determination of the structure of Ku70/80 bound to a DNA end has shown that it forms an asymmetric ring around the DNA helix (10Walker J.R. Corpina R.A. Goldberg J. Nature. 2001; 412: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Also p460 has an end bridging activity (11DeFazio L.G. Stansel R.M. Griffith J.D. Chu G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3192-3200Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The XRCC4-DNA ligase IV complex is responsible for the break resealing step (12Li Z. Otevrel T. Gao Y. Cheng H.L. Seed B.

We have established that both DNA-PK subunits are required for the recruitment of the XRCC4-DNA ligase IV complex to model DNA breaks (14Calsou P. Delteil C. Frit P. Drouet J. Salles B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Also the Artemis protein has a role at least in the resolution of hairpin-ended breaks (15Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. Lieber M.R.

The protein kinase activity of DNA-PKcs is necessary per se for functional end joining based on several criteria. (i) Phosphorylation is required for activation of key substrates as in the case of the cryptic endonuclease activity of Artemis responsible for hairpin opening (15Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K.

Proteins involved in various DNA repair pathways have been shown to relocalize in response to DNA damage. However, very few studies have addressed the question of the nuclear mobilization of NHEJ factors in vivo following DSB induction most likely due to the background resulting from high levels of NHEJ factors in mammalian cells. Chan et al. (21Chan D.W. Chen B.P.-C. Prithivirajsingh S. Kurimasa A. Story M.D. Qin J. Chen D.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2333-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) reported no change in the strong nuclear overall staining for p460 in x-ray-irradiated cells, although a specific anti-phosphorylated Thr-2609 revealed a subpopulation of discrete foci after exposure to IR. Photobleaching experiments using HeLa cells expressing Ku70- or Ku80-green fluorescent protein fusion constructs showed that Ku moves rapidly throughout the nucleus even 30 min following IR (26Rodgers W. Jordan S.J. Capra J.D. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 2348-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, the functional repair activity of these constructs was not assessed in this study, preventing extrapolation of these conclusions to the endogenous Ku protein pool. Here we analyzed the nuclear mobilization in human cells of the major DNA-PK and XRCC4-ligase IV NHEJ proteins in response to DSB at early time points following damage infliction. We describe a novel detergent-based cellular fractionation protocol that allowed us to assess in situ the DSB-induced recruitment of untagged endogenous NHEJ repair proteins as visualized by both immunofluorescence and immunoblot analyses. Altogether our findings represent the first description in the cell of the nuclear mobilization and interplay of key NHEJ proteins after exposure to double strand-breaking agents. Chemicals—Neocarzinostatin was a kind gift from Dr. V. Favaudon (Institut Curie, Orsay, France). It was stored as a 1 mm stock solution in 10 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 4.0 at -80 °C and diluted in the same buffer before use. Bleomycin was from Aventis. Methyl methanesulfonate was purchased from Sigma. Cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum II) was a gift from Roger Bellon Cie. Bleomycin (10 mm stock solution) and cisplatin (3 mm stock solution) were dissolved in water and 150 mm NaCl, respectively, and stored at -20 °C. Wortmannin (Sigma) was dissolved in Me2SO (10 mm stock solution) and stored at -20 °C. Small aliquots of stock solution chemicals were used once. Antibodies—Anti-Ku70 (N3H10), anti-Ku80 (clone 111), anti-Ku70/80 (clone 162), and anti-p460 (DNA-PKcs, clone 18.2) monoclonal antibodies were from Neomarkers (Fremont, CA). Monoclonal antibody anti-phosphorylated H2AX (JBW301) and anti-lamin A/C (clone 636) were from Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies anti-XRCC4 and anti-ligase IV were from Serotec Ltd. (Oxford, UK) and from Abcam Ltd. (Cambridge, UK), respectively. The polyclonal rabbit antibody anti-Rad51 and the monoclonal antibody anti-HP1α (clone 2HP-2G9) were gifts from Dr. M. Defais (Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale, Toulouse, France) and Dr. R. Losson (Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire, Illkirch, France), respectively. Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Cell Culture and DNA-damaging Treatments—All culture media were from Invitrogen and were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum unless indicated, 2 mm glutamine, 125 units/ml penicillin, and 125 μg/ml streptomycin. HCT116 cells (a gift from Dr. F. Praz, Institut Gustave-Roussy, Villejuif, France) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. MRC5-SV cells (a gift from Dr. A. Sarasin, Institut Gustave-Roussy, Villejuif, France) were grown in α modified Eagle's medium. The lymphoblastoid cell lines (GM9820, Coriell Institute, Camden, NJ, and LB2304 (27O'Driscoll M. Cerosaletti K.M. Girard P.M. Dai Y. Stumm M. Kysela B. Hirsch B. Gennery A. Palmer S.E. Seidel J. Gatti R.A. Varon R. Oettinger M.A. Neitzel H. Jeggo P.A. Concannon P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1175-1185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 15% fetal bovine serum and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. DNA-PKcs-deficient and -complemented cell lines (Fus9, alias M059J, and Fus1, respectively (28Hoppe B.S. Jensen R.B. Kirchgessner C.U. Radiat. Res. 2000; 153: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), gifts from Dr. C. Kirchgessner, Stanford University School of Medicine) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F-12 1:1 medium. All cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Before drug exposure, exponentially growing cells were washed with unsupplemented medium either in culture dishes or by centrifugation for cell suspensions that were either mock-treated or treated with chemicals at the specified concentrations in unsupplemented medium at 37 °C in culture dishes or in 15-ml tubes for lymphoblastoid cells, and then harvested at the indicated time points. For UV irradiation, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then exposed to UVC irradiation (254 nm) with a germicidal lamp (Bioblock). Immediately after irradiation, unsupplemented medium was added, and cells were postincubated as above. Biochemical Fractionation and Immunoblotting—Treated or mock-treated cells in culture dishes were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, collected by scraping, and centrifuged. For cell suspensions, cells were collected by centrifugation and washed as above. Cell fractionation was carried out by two consecutive extractions. The supernatant was collected at each step and labeled as fractions S. Pellets of about 2 × 106 cells were first resuspended for 15 min on ice in 200 μl of extraction buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Complete Mini™, Roche Diagnostics) and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm cantharidin, all from Sigma). Following centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 3 min, the supernatant was collected, and the pellet was further extracted for 15 min on ice with 200 μl of fresh extraction buffer. The extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 3 min, and the supernatant was pooled with the previous one (fraction S1). The pellet was further incubated in 200 μl of extraction buffer without Triton but supplemented with 200 μg/ml RNase A (Sigma) for 30 min at 25 °C under agitation. Following centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 3 min, the supernatant (fraction S2) was separated from the pellet (fraction P2). When necessary, the P2 pellet was incubated for 1 h at 37 °Cinthe presence of 100 units of calf intestine phosphatase (New England Bio-labs) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2 mm magnesium chloride, and protease inhibitors as above. When necessary, a third extraction was performed for 30 min at 37 °C by resuspension of the P2 pellet in extraction buffer without detergent supplemented with 5 mm manganese chloride and 300 μg/ml DNase I (Sigma). Following centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 3 min, the supernatant (fraction S3) was separated from the pellet (fraction P3). Insoluble P2 or P3 fractions were resuspended in PBS buffer supplemented with 1% SDS, heated for 10 min at 100 °C, and sonicated for 10 s (Vibracel, Bioblock Scientific). Whole cell extracts of treated or mock-treated cells were obtained by direct lysis in PBS buffer supplemented with 1% SDS and treatment as above. Concentrated loading sample buffer was added for a 1× final concentration in all fractions, and the samples were boiled for 5 min. Equal aliquots of each fraction, derived from equivalent cell numbers, were separated by SDS-PAGE (8% for standard separation or 15% for γ-H2AX isolation) and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Hybond-P, Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked for 1 h in 5% dry milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and incubated for 1 h with primary antibody diluted in PBS containing 0.02% Tween 20 and 1% bovine serum albumin (fraction V, Sigma). After three washes with PBS-T, membranes were incubated for 1 h with secondary antibodies in PBS containing 0.02% Tween 20 and 5% dry milk. Immunoblots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Super Signal, Pierce). Providing extensive washing and probing first with polyclonal antibodies, successive immunoblotting were performed on the same membranes without stripping. For data presentation, films were scanned and processed with Adobe Photoshop 3.0 software. Immunoprecipitations—For Ku70/80 immunoprecipitations, anti-Ku70/80 (162) antibodies were coupled to magnetic anti-mouse IgG beads (Dynabeads M-450, Dynal), and for XRCC4 immunoprecipitations, anti-XRCC4 antibodies were coupled to magnetic anti-rabbit IgG beads (Dynabeads M-280, Dynal) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. P2 pellets from neocarzinostatin (Ncs)-treated or mock-treated HCT116 cells were sonicated for 10 s in 200 μl of extraction buffer. Then under 100-μl final buffer volume, 30 μl of extracts were incubated at 4 °C for 180 min under gentle agitation with 10 μl of beads in 25 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm cantharidin (Sigma), and protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Complete Mini, Roche Diagnostics). The supernatant was removed over a magnet (Dynal MPC, Dynal). After two washes in the same buffer, proteins in the immunoprecipitates were heated in SDS sample buffer. In Situ Detergent Extraction and Immunofluorescence—Cells grown for 48 h on glass coverslips to about 70% confluence in 24-wells plates were untreated or treated with Ncs as described above. After 1 h, cell extraction was carried out in situ by incubating the coverslips in extraction buffer as described above for 2 min at room temperature (RT). Control cells were treated in the same buffer without detergent. Cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at RT followed by a 5-min incubation with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS at RT. After each step, the coverslips were rinsed three times with PBS. Coverslips were blocked with 10% fetal calf serum, 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Triton, and 100 μg/ml RNase A in PBS for 60 min at RT. Then cells were incubated with the appropriate primary antibody (1:300 dilution in PBS, 2% fetal calf serum, 0.2% Triton) for 1 h at RT. After extensive washing with PBS, 2% fetal calf serum, antibody binding was detected by the application of a 1:300 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Sigma), 1:500 dilution of Rhodamine Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, or 1:1000 dilution of Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (both from Molecular Probes) for 30 min at room temperature. The DNA was stained with either a 1:500 dilution of TO-PRO-3 iodide (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at room temperature or 2 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) for 5 min at RT. Coverslips were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Confocal images were obtained by means of a confocal laser microscopy system (TCS, NT, Leica) fitted with appropriate filter sets. Images were collected by scanning stained cells sequentially under a 40× objective lens. Images were processed for publication using the Adobe PhotoShop 5.0 software program. Nuclear Retention of NHEJ Proteins after Treatment of Cells with a DNA Double Strand Break-inducing Agent—We reasoned that gentle extraction of the nucleoplasmic pool of the key NHEJ proteins could allow the visualization by immunofluorescence of a potential nuclear association of these proteins at early time points following DSB induction. This approach has been used to observe the retention of other repair proteins (29Iwabuchi K. Basu B.P. Kysela B. Kurihara T. Shibata M. Guan D. Cao Y. Hamada T. Imamura K. Jeggo P.A. Date T. Doherty A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36487-36495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 30Andegeko Y. Moyal L. Mittelman L. Tsarfaty I. Shiloh Y. Rotman G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38224-38230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but it has not been applied previously to NHEJ proteins. Thus, to remove loosely bound nuclear proteins, we adapted a cellular fractionation procedure based on detergent extraction (30Andegeko Y. Moyal L. Mittelman L. Tsarfaty I. Shiloh Y. Rotman G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38224-38230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HCT116 colon carcinoma cells were grown on glass coverslips and either treated or not with the radiomimetic drug Ncs for 1 h. Ncs is a natural enediyne antibiotic that has been shown to produce DSBs with selectivity and efficiency higher than IR (31Povirk L.F. Mutat. Res. 1996; 355: 71-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) and to efficiently induce DBSs and cytotoxicity when applied to cells (32Shiloh Y. van der Schans G.P. Lohman P.H. Becker Y. Carcinogenesis. 1983; 4: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To optimize DSB production and thus the potential recruitment of repair proteins, Ncs was used at a dose about 10-fold higher than the IC50 determined on theses cells by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide test after 48 h of culture (data not shown). After a 1-h drug treatment, cells were either extracted or not with Triton, then fixed, and immunostained for proteins representative of the early damage recognition and later resealing steps of the NHEJ pathway (Ku70/80 heterodimer and XRCC4, respectively). An antibody against lamin A/C was used as a control for nuclear scaffold proteins (33Hozak P. Sasseville A.M. Raymond Y. Cook P.R. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 635-644PubMed Google Scholar). In non-extracted cells, Ku and XRCC4 showed a diffuse nuclear staining with the exception of nucleoli or mitotic chromosomes that were not stained. No change in the nuclear staining pattern of both proteins was detected upon treatment with Ncs (Fig. 1A). After the in situ cellular extraction procedure with Triton, images obtained by phase-contrast clearly showed that only the nuclei remained (data not shown). Nuclear staining of both Ku and XRCC4 proteins was lost in untreated cells, whereas nuclear lamin A/C was still readily detectable (Fig. 1B, left panels). In contrast, Ku and XRCC4 were retained in nuclei of Ncs-treated cells under the same detergent extraction conditions (Fig. 1B, right panels). Identical results were obtained with DNA-PKcs and DNA ligase IV staining or after treatment with the other enediyne antibiotic γ-calicheamicin (data not shown). Thus, the removal of nucleoplasmic or loosely bound NHEJ proteins enabled clear detection of retained proteins in the nuclei of cells treated with DSB-inducing molecules within a 1-h incubation time. Isolation of Protein Fractions Resistant to Detergent Extraction after Treatment of Cells with DSB-inducing Agents—To analyze biochemically the nuclear protein fraction retained after detergent extraction following DSB induction, we adapted the protocol used above to immunostain cells scraped from culture dishes. HCT116 colon carcinoma cells were extracted with a 0.1% Triton-containing buffer, and the clarified cell extract was collected (S1). The cell pellet was treated with RNase A in the same buffer but without detergent, and the soluble and insoluble fractions were collected (S2 and P2, respectively). A parallel extraction procedure was performed on untreated cells and cells treated with Ncs. Fig. 2A shows the immunoblot analysis following SDS-PAGE of cell-equivalent aliquots of the three fractions compared with whole cell extracts (WCEs) under both untreated and Ncs-treated conditions. The membranes were blotted with antibodies against Ku70, Ku80, XRCC4, DNA ligase IV, and γ-H2AX, the latter serving as a quantitative nuclear marker of DSB (34Rothkamm K. Kruger I. Thompson L.H. Lobrich M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5706-5715Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). In addition, anti-Rad51 antibodies were used as a probe of the homologous recombination route for DSB repair. As opposed to non-treated cells, WCEs from Ncs-treated cells contain γ-H2AX as expected given the high DNA DSB inducing potency of Ncs (32Shiloh Y. van der Schans G.P. Lohman P.H. Becker Y. Carcinogenesis. 1983; 4: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition, XRCC4 in the WCEs of Ncs-treated cells was detected essentially as a slow migrating form. In untreated cells, the majority of the proteins detected were released during the first (XRCC4-DNA ligase IV and Rad51) or the two extraction steps (Ku), and none of these proteins were detected in the insoluble P2 fraction. In contrast, both the S2 and/or P2 fractions from Ncs-treated cells were highly enriched in NHEJ proteins, including the slowly migrating form of XRCC4. In addition, γ-H2AX was exclusively present in the insoluble P2 fraction from Ncs-treated cells, whereas no Rad51 protein was retained under these conditions. The presence of DSB in cells has been shown to induce phosphorylation of XRCC4, retarding its migration in SDS-PAGE (35Matsumoto Y. Suzuki N. Namba N. Umeda N. Ma X.J. Morita A. Tomita M. Enomoto A. Serizawa S. Hirano K. Sakaia K. Yasuda H. Hosoi Y. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Accordingly we found that the XRCC4 slower migrating form was sensitive to calf intestine phosphatase, indicating that it corresponded to a phosphorylated form (Fig. 2B). We then analyzed the specificity of protein recruitment toward the class of DNA lesions. NHEJ-defective mutants are selectively sensitive to DSB-inducing agents (36Thacker J. Zdzienicka M.Z. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 655-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and the Ku dimer exhibits a strong binding activity toward DSBs with no sequence specificity (37Downs J.A. Jackson S.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Accordingly we found a selective retention of NHEJ proteins (including the p460 DNA-PK catalytic subunit) in the P2 insoluble fraction following treatment of cells with the DSB-inducing agents Ncs and bleomycin (Fig. 3A). In addition, a similar recruitment was observed in response to cell treatment with γ-calicheamicin and high doses of ionizing radiation (data not shown). There was no significant retention of NHEJ proteins when these cells were heavily irradiated with UV-C rays or treated with high doses of the cross-linking agent cisplatin or the DNA methylating molecule methyl methanesulfonate (Fig. 3A). Notably this dose of bleomycin induced mainly the recruitment of a normal p55 XRCC4 migrating form in contrast with the phosphorylated form retained with Ncs. Since HCT116 cells have been reported to be defective in the mismatch repair MLH1 (38Liu B. Nicolaides N.C. Markowitz S. Willson J.K. Parsons R.E. Jen J. Papadopolous N. Peltomaki P. de la Chapelle A. Hamilton S.R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar) and to exhibit a low expression of the MRE11 protein (39Giannini G. Ristori E. Cerignoli F. Rinaldi C. Zani M. Viel A. Ottini L. Crescenzi M. Martinotti S. Bignami M. Frati L. Screpanti I. Gulino A. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), both traits that could potentially modulate the NHEJ pathway, we checked NHEJ repair protein recruitment in another cellular background. As shown in Fig. 3B, MRC5 lung fibroblastic cells treated with bleomycin also exhibited selective retention of Ku and p460"
https://openalex.org/W2029405062,"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels. α Subunits, together with β2 and/or β4 subunits, form ligand-binding sites at α/β subunit interfaces. Predatory marine snails of the genus Conus are a rich source of nAChR-targeted peptides. Using conserved features of the α-conotoxin signal sequence and 3′-untranslated sequence region, we have cloned a novel gene from the fish-eating snail, Conus bullatus; the gene codes for a previously unreported α-conotoxin with unusual 4/4 spacing of amino acids in the two disulfide loops. Chemical synthesis of the predicted mature toxin was performed. The resulting peptide, α-conotoxin BuIA, was tested on cloned nAChRs expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The peptide potently blocks numerous rat nAChR subtypes, with highest potency for α3- and chimeric α6-containing nAChRs; BuIA blocks α6/α3β2 nAChRs with a 40,000-fold lower IC50 than α4β2 nAChRs. The kinetics of toxin unblock are dependent on the β subunit. nAChRs with a β4 subunit have very slow off-times, compared with the corresponding β2 subunit-containing nAChR. In each instance, rat αxβ4 may be distinguished from rat αxβ2 by the large difference in time to recover from toxin block. Similar results are obtained when comparing mouse α3β2 to mouse α3β4, and human α3β2 to human α3β4, indicating that the β subunit dependence extends across species. Thus, α-conotoxin BuIA also represents a novel probe for distinguishing between β2- and β4-containing nAChRs.

Acetylcholine acts on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) 1The abbreviations used are: nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; ACh, acetylcholine; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl. to mediate fast excitatory neurotransmission or to modulate neurotransmitter release. nAChRs appear to be involved in pain sensation, attention, memory, learning, and development (1Jones S.W. Sudweeks S. Yakel J.L. Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 555-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Medications that affect nicotinic transmission may be useful for the treatment of pain, memory disorders, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and nicotine addiction. To maximize the ratio of therapeutic benefit to side effects, medications must discriminate between a plethora of subtypes of nAChRs. Neuronal nAChRs are ligand-gated cationic channels composed of α and, in many cases, β subunits. These pentameric proteins have at least two ligand binding sites located at the interface of two subunits. For neuronal nAChRs, the ligand binding β subunit appears to be either β2 or β4. Both of these subunits are widely expressed, often within the same areas of the nervous system (reviewed in Refs. 2Role L.W. Berg D.K. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1077-1085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar and 3Corringer P.J. Le Novere N. Changeux J-P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 431-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Probes to distinguish among different α and β subunit-containing nAChRs are needed to identify which subtypes underlie the particular effects of nicotine. Predatory marine snails of the genus Conus utilize nAChR antagonists to immobilize and capture their prey. The ∼500 species of cone snails prey upon a broad diversity of organisms (five different phyla). Each Conus species appears to have a unique complement of nAChR antagonists, making Conus a rich source of novel ligands, often with unique specificities. In this report, we describe the cloning of a gene that encodes a novel α-conotoxin that distinguishes among α subunit-containing nAChRs and kinetically discriminates between β2- and β4-containing nAChRs. Identification and Sequencing of a cDNA Clone Encoding α-Conotoxin BuIA—cDNA was prepared by a reverse transcription of RNA isolated from the Conus bullatus venom duct as described previously (4Jacobsen R. Jimenez E.C. Grilley M. Watkins M. Hillyard D. Cruz L.J. Olivera B.M. J. Peptide Res. 1998; 51: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The resulting cDNA served as a template for PCR using oligonucleotides corresponding to the conserved signal sequence and the 3′-UTR sequence of α-conotoxin prepropeptides. The resulting PCR product was purified using the HIGH-PURE PCR product purification kit (Roche Applied Science) following the suggested protocol of the manufacturer. The eluted DNA fragment was annealed to plasmid pAMP1 vector, and the resulting product was transformed into competent DH5α cells, with the clone AMP pAMP System for Rapid Cloning of Amplification Products (Invitrogen) following the suggested protocols of the manufacturer. The resulting product was transferred into competent DH5α cells as described (4Jacobsen R. Jimenez E.C. Grilley M. Watkins M. Hillyard D. Cruz L.J. Olivera B.M. J. Peptide Res. 1998; 51: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The nucleic acid sequences of the resulting clones were determined according to the standard protocol for Sequenase Version 2.0 DNA Sequencing kit as described (5Jimenez E.C. Craig A.G. Watkins M. Hillyard D.R. Gray W.R. Gulyas J. Rivier J.E. Cruz L.J. Olivera B.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 989-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Chemical Synthesis—The peptide was synthesized, 0.45 mmol/g, on a Fmoc amide resin using Fmoc chemistry and standard side protection except on cysteine residues. Cys residues were protected in pairs with either S-trityl on Cys2 and Cys8, or S-acetamidomethyl on Cys3 and Cys13. The peptide was removed from the resin and precipitated. A two-step oxidation protocol was used to selectively fold the peptides as described previously (6Walker C. Steel D. Jacobsen R.B. Lirazan M.B. Cruz L.J. Hooper D. Shetty R. DelaCruz R.C. Nielsen J.S. Zhou L. Bandyopadhyay P. Craig A. Olivera B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30664-30671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Briefly, the disulfide bridge between Cys2 and Cys8 was closed by dripping the peptide into an equal volume of 20 mm potassium ferricyanide, 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.5. The solution was allowed to react for 30 min, and the monocyclic peptide was purified by reverse-phase HPLC. Simultaneous removal of the S-acetamidomethyl groups and closure of the disulfide bridge between Cys3 and Cys13 was carried out by iodine oxidation. The monocyclic peptide and HPLC eluent was dripped into an equal volume of iodine (10 mm) in H20/trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile (78:2:20 by volume) and allowed to react for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of ascorbic acid, diluted 20-fold with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and the bicyclic peptide was purified by HPLC on a reverse-phase C18 Vydac column using a linear gradient of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid 0.092% trifluoroacetic acid, 60% acetonitrile, remainder H2O. Mass Spectrometry—Measurements were performed at the Salk Institute under the direction of Jean Rivier. MALDI-TOF/MS (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry) was utilized. Voltage Clamp Recording—Oocytes were harvested and injected with cRNA encoding nAChR subunits as described previously (7Cartier G.E. Yoshikami D. Gray W.R. Luo S. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7522-7528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The oocyte recording chamber was fabricated from Sylgard and was 300 μl in volume. Oocytes were gravity-perfused with ND96 (96.0 mm NaCl, 2.0 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.1–7.5) containing 1 μm atropine (ND96A) with or without toxin at a rate of ∼5 ml/min. All solutions also contained 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin to reduce nonspecific adsorption of peptide. The perfusion medium could be switched to one containing peptide or ACh by use of a distributor valve (SmartValve, Cavro Scientific Instruments, Sunnyvale, CA) and a series of three-way solenoid valves (model 161T031, Neptune Research, Northboro, MA). All recordings were made at room temperature (∼22 °C). ACh-gated currents were obtained with a two-electrode voltage clamp amplifier (model OC-725B, Warner Instrument, Hamden, CT). Glass microelectrodes, pulled from fiber-filled borosilicate capillaries (1-mm outer diameter Å∼ 0.75-mm inner diameter) (WPI, Sarasota, FL) and filled with 3 m KCl, served as voltage and current electrodes. Resistances for voltage and current electrodes were 0.5–3.0 MΩ and 0.5–2.0 MΩ, respectively. The membrane potential was clamped at -70 mV, and the current signal, recorded through virtual ground, was low pass-filtered (5 Hz cut-off) and digitized at a sampling frequency of 20 Hz. Data acquisition, measurement of peak responses, and control of the distributor and solenoid valves were automated by a homemade virtual instrument constructed with the graphical programming language LabVIEW (National Instruments). To apply a pulse of ACh to the oocyte, the perfusion fluid was switched to one containing ACh for 1 s. This was automatically done at intervals of 1–5 min. The shortest time interval was chosen such that reproducible control responses were obtained with no observable desensitization. This time interval depended on the nAChR subtype being tested. The concentration of ACh was 100 μm. The ACh was diluted in ND96A for tests of all nAChR subtypes except α7, in which case the diluent was ND96. For control responses, the ACh pulse was preceded by perfusion with ND96 (for α7) or ND96A (all others). No atropine was used with oocytes expressing α7, because it has been demonstrated to be an antagonist of these receptors (8Gerzanich V. Anand R. Lindstrom J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 212-220PubMed Google Scholar). For responses in toxin (test responses), the perfusion solution was switched to one containing toxin while maintaining the same interval of ACh pulses. Toxin was continuously perfused until responses reached a steady state. All ACh pulses contained no toxin, for it was assumed that little, if any, bound toxin would have washed away in the brief time (<2 s) it takes for the responses to peak. The average peak amplitude of three control responses just preceding exposure to toxin were used to normalize the amplitude of each test response to obtain “% response” or “% block.” Each data point of a dose-response curve represents the average value ±S.E. of measurements from at least three oocytes. Data fits were performed with Prism software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Cloning of Mouse α3, β2, and β4 cDNAs—The mouse β2 cDNA was cloned as described previously (9Stitzel J.A. Dobelis P. Jimenez M. Collins A.C. Pharmacogenetics. 2001; 11: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For the cloning of the α3 and β4 cDNAs, first strand cDNAs were generated from 2 μg each, DBA/2Ibg adrenal gland total RNA and P19 teratocarcinoma cell total RNA using AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI), 1× reverse transcriptase buffer (Promega) 200 μm each, dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 5 mm MgCl2 and 2.5 μm random hexamers (Promega). cDNA synthesis was performed for 1 h at 42 °C. Following synthesis, the first strand cDNAs were purified using the Qiagen (Valencia, CA) PCR purification protocol according to the manufacturer's instructions. The α3 (1612 bp) and β4 (1578 bp) cDNAs subsequently were amplified from the DBA/2Ibg adrenal gland first strand cDNA and P19 teratocarcinoma cell first strand cDNA, respectively, using Pfu Turbo Polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), 1× Pfu buffer, 200 μm each, dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, and 0.4 μm each, α3- and β4-specific forward and reverse primers. Primers used for cDNA amplification were as follows: α3 (Forward: 5′-GCTTAGCTGTGCTTCGGTGGTG-3′, Reverse: 5′-CTTTCATCAGCACAGGTGAGC-3′) and β4 (Forward: 5′-CATTGTGGGGTGACCGGCAGC-3′, Reverse: 5′-GTGGGATGATATGAGCAGCC-3′). Following amplification, cDNAs were inserted into the vector pCRBluntIITOPO (Invitrogen) and sequenced. A minimum of 6 cDNAs per subunit were sequenced in order to determine the consensus sequence of each subunit cDNA. cDNA clones containing the consensus sequence subsequently were subcloned into either pcDNA3.1zeo (+) (Invitrogen) (α3) or pcDNA3.1hygro (+) (Invitrogen) (β4). Transcription with T7 RNA polymerase yielded sense-strand cRNA for injection into oocytes. Construction of Rat α6/α3 Chimera—cDNA clones encoding rat nAChR subunits were provided by S. Heinemann (Salk Institute, San Diego, CA) with plasmid constructs as described (10Johnson D.S. Martinez J. Elgoyhen A.B. Heinemann S.F. McIntosh J.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 194-199PubMed Google Scholar). The rat α6 subunit does not express with the rat β2 subunit (11Dowell C. Olivera B.M. Garrett J.E. Staheli S.T. Watkins M. Kuryatov A. Yoshikami D. Lindstrom J.M. Mcintosh J.M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8445-8452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore used a chimera that contains the N-terminal extracellular α6 subunit sequence linked to the remaining portion of the α3 subunit protein as a model of activity at α6 subunit-containing nAChRs. The α6/α3 chimera was provided by James Garrett (Cognetix Inc., Salt Lake City, UT). The chimeric nAChR consists of amino acids 1–237 of the rat α6 subunit protein linked to amino acids 233–499 of the rat α3 subunit protein. The chimeric junction is located at the paired arginine residues immediately preceding the M1 transmembrane segment of the α3 subunit. The resulting chimeric nAChR represents the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the α6 subunit linked to the membrane-embedded region of the α3 subunit. The α6/α3 cDNA was constructed by introduction of BspEI sites at the chimeric junction into the α6 and α3 cDNA sequences using mutagenic primers to introduce the restriction sites through silent codon changes. The α6 and α3 segments were generated by PCR of rat brain cDNA clones using primers in the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of the corresponding cDNAs along with the internal mutagenic primers. The PCR products were digested with BspEI and ligated to generate the chimeric construct. The final chimeric construct was cloned and completely sequenced to confirm the correct cDNA sequence. The protein sequence was an exact match to the rat α6 and α3 sequences in GenBank™, except for a valine to alanine change at amino acid 278 in the chimeric construct. To further improve expression levels, most of the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of the nAChR cDNA were deleted, leaving only 12 bp of 5′-UTR and 34 bp of 3′-UTR sequence. The chimeric construct was cloned into the Xenopus expression vector pT7TS, placing Xenopus globin 5′- and 3′-UTR regions around the nAChR cDNA. The expression construct, pT7TS/rα6α3, was transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase to generate sense-strand RNA for oocyte expression. To improve expression levels of the α6/α3 chimera, it was co-injected with β2 and β4 subunits (provided by Charles Luetje) that were engineered into the pGEMHE high expression vector as described (12Parker M.J. Beck A. Luetje C.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 1132-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Cloning of α-Conotoxin BuIA—In common with other known families of conotoxins, the α-conotoxins are proteolytically processed from a larger precursor protein. In the case of the α-conotoxins, this prepropeptide is ∼40 amino acids long, with the mature α-conotoxin moiety of ∼13–18 amino acids located at the C terminus of the precursor. A processing site, usually consisting of a basic amino acid, immediately precedes the mature toxin in the precursor sequence. An unusual feature of the conotoxins is that while the mature toxin peptides are highly variable in sequence, the precursor proteins are highly conserved. The signal sequence region is practically invariant among the different α-conotoxin precursors, and this remains true even for phylogenetically distant Conus species (13Schoenfeld, R. A. (1999) The Genomic Structure of Delta Conotoxins and Other O-Superfamily Conotoxins. Ph.D. thesis, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UTGoogle Scholar, 14Santos A.D. McIntosh J.M. Hillyard D.R.

Also, the 3′-untranslated region of the α-conotoxin mRNA is highly conserved. We utilized the conserved features of the α-conotoxin gene structure to design oligonucleotide primers for polymerase chain reaction amplification of the α-conotoxin-coding region. The resulting cDNA clone from C. bullatus is shown in Fig. 1.Table IConcentration response analysis of α-conotoxin BuIAnAChRIC50CIa95% confidence intervalHill slopeCIa95% confidence intervalnmα2β2800567-11300.8500.591-1.11α3β25.724.57-7.161.481.04-1.92α4β210,4004,930-21,9000.5250.171-0.879α6/α3β20.2580.207-0.3200.9630.815-1.11α7272243-3041.211.10-1.32α2β412192.2-1601.310.615-2.01α3β427.722.3-34.51.521.01-2.04α4β469.947.9-1021.150.738-1.57α6/α3β41.541.32-1.781.401.12-1.68a 95% confidence interval Open table in a new tab Fig. 6Kinetics of block and unblock by α-BuIA.A, α-BuIA at 0.3 nm was perfusion-applied (triangle) to oocytes expressing rat α6/α3β2 nAChRs and subsequently toxin was washed out (square). The response to a 1-s pulse of ACh every 1 min was assessed. An individual experiment is shown. Data averaged from 3 oocytes gave a kon of (2.77 ± 0.59) × 108 min-1m-1. The koff was 0.168 ± 0.022 min-1. B, α-BuIA at 150 nm was perfusion applied to rat α2β4 nAChRs and response to a 1-s pulse of ACh was monitored every 2 min. Results from a single experiment are shown (triangle). For three experiments the average kon = 1.84 × 105 min-1m-1. α-BuIA was bath applied for 5 min at 1 μm and then washed out. Recovery from block was monitored by recording the response to a 1-s pulse of ACh every 2 min. A single experiment is shown (square). Results from three oocytes yielded a koff of 0.0106 ± 0.00212 min-1. C, toxin was perfusion applied to oocytes at three different concentrations for each nAChR subtype. The response to a 1-s pulse of ACh was monitored once per minute. Since kobs = kon × F + koff, where F = the free toxin concentration, the graph of kobsversus F has a slope of kon and a y-intercept of koff.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 1Prepropeptide and encoded toxin of α-BuIA.

The glycine at the C terminus was assumed to be post-translationally modified to a C-terminal amide. It was also assumed that the disulfide bridging of α-conotoxin BuIA was analogous to all previously characterized α-conotoxins, that is, Cys2 to Cys8 and Cys3 to Cys13; Cys groups were orthogonally protected in pairs to direct disulfide bond formation in this configuration. Acid-labile S-trityl was removed simultaneously with peptide cleavage from the resin and closure of the disulfide bridge between these Cys residues was accomplished with FeCN. The monocyclic peptide was purified by HPLC, and the acid-stable acetomidomethyl groups were removed, and the disulfide bridges formed by iodine oxidation. The folded peptide was subsequently analyzed with matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry. The mass of the synthetic peptide was consistent with the amidated sequence (monoisotopic MH+: calculated, 1311.5; observed, 1311.4). Peptide Effect on nAChRs—α-Conotoxin BuIA was tested on various subunit combinations of neuronal nAChRs heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Concentration response analysis indicated that, unlike some α-conotoxins, α-BuIA was active against a broad spectrum of nAChR subtypes. The α nAChR subunit had a profound influence on the effect of BuIA. The peptide was most potent on nAChRs containing the extracellular portion of the α6 subunit and next most potent on the closely related α3 subunit-containing nAChRs. The ligand had little effect on α4β2 nAChRs (IC50 >10 μm). Results are shown in Fig. 2 and Table I. Effects of BuIA on β2-versus β4-containing nAChRs—The rate of unblock by toxin was monitored subsequent to washout of ligand. The results are shown in Fig. 3. Recovery from toxin block was markedly slower for β4 versus β2 subunit-containing nAChRs. This effect is particularly noticeable when nAChRs containing the same α subunit are compared. We further investigated this effect on mouse α3β2 versus mouse α3β4 nAChRs, and human α3β2 and human α3β4 nAChRs. As was the case for rat nAChRs, the rate of recovery from toxin block was significantly slower for β4-versus β2-containing nAChRs (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Recovery from α-BuIA block in mouse and human nAChRs. α-BuIA was perfusion-applied to oocytes expressing the indicated mouse and human nAChRs. Recovery is prolonged for the β4-containing nAChRs. m, mouse; h, human. Error bars are the S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although the off-rate for β4-containing nAChRs was much slower, surprisingly in several instances the corresponding IC50 values of α-BuIA for β2-containing nAChRs was lower than that of the β4-containing receptors. Since affinity is a ratio of off-rate to on-rate, this implies that the on-rate for β2-containing nAChRs is faster than that of the corresponding β4-containing nAChRs. Time to steady state for toxin block of rat α3β2 and α3β4 nAChRs was examined by perfusing the toxin over the oocyte and then assessing a response to ACh (Fig. 5). The results are consistent with a markedly faster on-rate for the β2-containing receptor. For αxβ2 nAChRs the recovery t½ was longest for α6/α3β2 nAChRs. The Ki of functional block of α6/α3β2 nAChRs, calculated from koff/kon (Fig. 6A) is consistent with the IC50 determined from concentration response analysis (0.69 nmversus 0.26 nm respectively). Kinetics of block and unblock were difficult to accurately quantitate for αxβ4 receptors due to the very long on- and off-times combined with limitations of oocyte life span and a tendency for the ACh response to drift over extended periods of time. However, kinetic constants for the α2β4 nAChR were determined (Fig. 6B) and the calculated Ki of functional block by BuIA (62.9 nm) is consistent with the IC50 value (121 nm) determined by concentration response experiments. We further assessed kinetic constants for all αxβ4 nAChRs by determining kobs of block by three different toxin concentrations (Fig. 6C). The kon and koff for α2β4 were 1.99 × 105 min-1m-1 and 0.0125 min-1, respectively, and this compares well to the value determined from the toxin wash in and washout experiments (1.84 × 105 min-1m-1 and 0.0106 min-1, Fig. 6B). The Ki values determined by this method were also consistent with IC50 values determined by concentration response analysis (Fig. 6C and Table II). However, whereas the on-rates determined by this method had reasonable 95% confidence intervals, the off-rates did not. The off-rate is determined by the y-intercept and for these toxins the y-intercept is near the origin (Fig. 6C). When the confidence interval includes the origin, the off-rate range becomes infinite. Therefore, as an additional check, we estimated off-rates by using the kon value determined by linear regression analysis of kobs values (Fig. 6C) and by assuming that the Ki is approximately equal to the IC50. koff values determined by this method were consistent with those obtained by the analysis of kobs values (Table II). For α2β2, α3β2, and α4β2 nAChRs the toxin off-rate was rapid (t½ < 1 min, see Fig. 2); we therefore were unable to further quantitate koff for these receptor subtypes due to receptor desensitization that occurs from ACh exposure more frequent than once per minute.Table IIKinetic analysis of α-BuIA on heterologously expressed rat nicotinic receptorskonaCalculated by kobs = kon(F) + koff (see Fig. 6C)koffaCalculated by kobs = kon(F) + koff (see Fig. 6C)t½bt½ = In √0.5/koffkoffcCalculated by koff = kon × ki, assuming that Ki = IC50t½cCalculated by koff = kon × ki, assuming that Ki = IC50KidCalculated from Ki = koff/kon, with koff and kon determined as in Fig. 6CIC50eSee Fig. 2min-1m-1min-1minmin-1minmα2β41.99 (1.70-2.29)fNumbers in parentheses are 95% confidence intervals × 1050.0125255.4 (22.4-∞)0.02407928.8 (21.9-41.9)6.29E-081.21E-07α3β44.68 (3.06-6.30) × 1050.0111462.2 (15.4-∞)0.012963653.5 (38.9-85.5)2.38E-082.77E-08α4β42.08 (1.77-2.39) × 1050.005029137.8 (28.7-∞)0.014539247.7 (33.0-85.7)2.18E-086.99E-08α6/α3β46.42 (5.78-7.06) × 1060.0165541.8 (12.9-∞)0.009886870.1 (59.9-91.1)2.58E-091.54E-09a Calculated by kobs = kon(F) + koff (see Fig. 6C)b t½ = In √0.5/koffc Calculated by koff = kon × ki, assuming that Ki = IC50d Calculated from Ki = koff/kon, with koff and kon determined as in Fig. 6Ce See Fig. 2f Numbers in parentheses are 95% confidence intervals Open table in a new tab C. bullatus is found from Mozambique and Zanzibar to Marquesas and Hawaii.

The toxin-encoding gene is homologous to peptides that are members of the A-superfamily of Conus toxins. This superfamily consists of peptides that act on nAChRs, potassium channels and sodium channels (14Santos A.D. McIntosh J.M. Hillyard D.R. Cruz L.J. Olivera B.M. J. Biol.

It is unusual however in the spacing between Cys residues. Previously isolated α-conotoxins fall into three broad categories. There are those that are referred to in the literature as having α3/5 spacing, indicating that there are three and five amino acids, respectively, between Cys residues in the two loops of the toxin; these are paralytic toxins isolated from Indo-Pacific cone snails that hunt fish, and potently inhibit the muscle nicotinic receptor. A second group is made up of those toxins having α4/7 spacing; these conotoxins predominately target neuronal subtypes of nicotinic receptors. The third group are the α4/3 peptides, isolated thus far only from Conus imperialis (18McIntosh J.M. Yoshikami D. Mahe E. Nielsen D.B. Rivier J.E. Gray W.R. Olivera B.M. J. Biol.

Hence, it has been questioned why such a toxic metabolite is synthesized via the ubiquitous energy-generating pathway. We have previously reported that expression of GLO1, coding for the major enzyme detoxifying MG, was induced by osmotic stress in a high osmolarity glycerol (HOG)-mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase-dependent manner in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we show that MG activates the HOG-MAP kinase cascade. Two osmosensors, Sln1 and Sho1, have been identified to function upstream of the HOG-MAP kinase cascade, and we reveal that MG initiates the signal transduction to this MAP kinase cascade through the Sln1 branch.

Although MG is synthesized during normal metabolism of glucose, this aldehyde inhibits the growth of cells from microorganisms to higher eukaryotes, eventually killing them, and therefore, the raison d'etre of MG has been of considerable interest.By the systematic biochemical analysis of the metabolic fate of MG using the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism, we revealed that MG is metabolized to lactic acid by two different routes (for reviews, see Refs. 3Inoue Y. Kimura A. Adv. Microbial. Physiol. 1995; 37: 177-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar and 4Inoue Y. Kimura A. Proc. Japan Acad. 1999; 75B: 127-132Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). One route is a glyoxalase system in which glyoxalase I and glyoxalase II are involved. In this route, MG is condensed with glutathione to give S-d-lactoylglutathione by the action of glyoxalase I, and the glutathione thiolester is then hydrolyzed to lactic acid and glutathione by glyoxalase II. The other route is a reduction/oxidation system consisting of methylglyoxal reductase and lactaldehyde dehydrogenase. MG is reduced to lactaldehyde by NADPH-dependent methylglyoxal reductase, and lactaldehyde is further oxidized to lactic acid by NAD+-dependent lactaldehyde dehydrogenase. To evaluate the physiological importance of these enzymatic routes in vivo, we cloned the structural gene for glyoxalase I (GLO1) and demonstrated that a glo1Δ mutant showed hypersensitivity to MG (5Inoue Y. Kimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25958-25965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Similarly, Bito et al. (6Bito A. Haider M. Hadler I. Breitenbach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21509-21519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) reported that a mutant defective in glyoxalase II (glo2Δ) was also hypersensitive to MG. On the other hand, Chen et al. (7Chen C.N. Porubleva L. Shearer G. Svrakic M. Holden L.G. Dover J.L. Johnston M. Chitnis P.R. Kohl D.H. Yeast. 2003; 20: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) recently reported that GRE2 is one of the genes encoding NADPH-dependent methylglyoxal reductase activity, although a gre2Δ mutant did not exhibit sensitivity to MG as far as we discerned. 2K. Maeta, S. Izawa, and Y. Inoue, unpublished data. 2K. Maeta, S. Izawa, and Y. Inoue, unpublished data. Alternatively, the GRE3 gene encodes an aldose reductase, and the corresponding gene product is supposed to be involved in MG metabolism, although the disruption of GRE3 did not enhance susceptibility to MG (8Aguilera J. Prieto J.A. Curr. Genet. 2001; 39: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the glyoxalase system is the most important pathway for MG detoxification in S. cerevisiae. This was also the case in the fission yeast (9Takatsume Y. Izawa S. Inoue Y. Arch. Microbiol. 2004; 181: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).To obtain a clue as to the cellular function of MG and its metabolic pathway, we have attempted to find the conditions that alter the intracellular MG level and/or MG-metabolizing enzyme activity in S. cerevisiae. We found that the expression of GLO1 is specifically induced by osmotic stress in a high osmolarity glycerol (HOG)-mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase-dependent manner (10Inoue Y. Tsujimoto Y. Kimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2977-2983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The GLO1 promoter contains the characteristic cis-acting element, STRE (stress response element). A gene possessing the STRE usually responds to a wide variety of stress stimuli such as oxidative stress, heat shock stress, and osmotic stress (11Martinez-Pastor M.T. Marchler G. Schüller C. Marchler-Bauer A. Ruis H. Estruch F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2227-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Msn2 binds to this element, and this C2H2-type zinc finger transcription factor was concentrated into the nucleus when cells were exposed to these stress stimuli (12Görner W. Durchschlag E. Martinez-Pastor M.T. Estruch F. Ammerer G. Hamilton B Ruis H. Schüller C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 586-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). However, interestingly, GLO1 did not respond to any form of stress but osmotic stress, even if the GLO1 promoter contained two sets of STRE (10Inoue Y. Tsujimoto Y. Kimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2977-2983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Under a highly osmotic stress, S. cerevisiae cells produce glycerol as a compatible osmolyte from glucose (13Albertyn J. Hohmann S. Thevelein J.M. Prior B.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4135-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the expression of HXT1 and GLK1 coding for hexose transporter and glucokinase, respectively, was elevated in cells exposed to high osmotic stress (14Norbeck J. Blomberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5544-5554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). These expression profiles suggest that the influx of glucose for glycolysis is facilitated to efficiently produce glycerol. Indeed, we revealed that consumption of glucose was enhanced in cells exposed to osmotic stress, and subsequently the cellular MG level increased (10Inoue Y. Tsujimoto Y. Kimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2977-2983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), although other stress stimuli such as oxidative stress did not increase the MG level. Therefore, the physiological significance of the induction of GLO1 under high osmotic stress is most likely the control of the intracellular MG level (4Inoue Y. Kimura A. Proc. Japan Acad. 1999; 75B: 127-132Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 10Inoue Y. Tsujimoto Y. Kimura A. J. Biol.

We found that Hog1 is phosphorylated and concentrated into the nucleus of cells treated with a low dose of MG. Msn2 was also translocated into the nucleus with MG treatment. Moreover, we found that MG treatment enhanced the uptake of Ca2+ in the medium by cells allowing activation of calcineurin. Consequently, Crz1, speculated to be the only transcription factor that functions under the control of calcineurin (15Yoshimoto H. Saltsman K. Gasch A.P. Li H.X. Ogawa N. Botstein D. Brown P.O.

Taken together, we hypothesize that MG may function as a signal initiator in yeast.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains—S. cerevisiae strains used in this study have the genetic background of YPH250 (MATatrp1-Δ1 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 lys2-801 ade2-101 ura3-5). mid1Δ::KanMX4, cch1Δ::KanMX4, and yvc1Δ::KanMX4 mutants have the genetic background of BY4741 (MATahis3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0) (Invitrogen).To construct a plasmid to disrupt HOG1 with LEU2, the plasmid pUHOG1 (10Inoue Y.

After incubation for 3 h, 50 mm MG was added, and a portion of the cell suspension was recovered periodically. The cells were collected, washed with sterilized 0.85% NaCl solution, and diluted appropriately with the same solution to spread on YPD agar plates. After incubation at 28 °C for 2 days, the colonies were counted. For control experiments, cells cultured in SD medium to A610 = 0.5 were directly challenged with 50 mm MG.Spot Assay—The cells were cultured in YPD medium (2% glucose, 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone) until A610 = 0.1, diluted serially (1:10) with the sterilized 0.85% NaCl solution, and spotted (5 μl) onto YPD agar plates containing various concentrations of MG.GFP-tagged Proteins—To construct Hog1-GFP, the open reading frame of HOG1 with its promoter (487-bp upstream region) (20Ferrigno P.

After incubation for the prescribed time at 28 °C, the intracellular localization of each GFP-tagged protein was observed using a fluorescence microscopy (Olympus BX51).Northern Blotting—The cells were cultured in SD medium until A610 = 0.5, and 8 mm MG was added to the culture medium. Total RNA was prepared periodically by the method of Schmitt et al. (23Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). Probes for CTT1 and FKS2 were prepared by PCR with the following primers: CTT1, 5′-CCTTCTCTTGTCTCATGCCAATAAG-3′ and 5′-GCAACTTGTTCAATTTCTTGGAAAT-3′; and FKS2, 5′-GTCCTACAACGATCCAAACTTGAATGGACA-3′ and 5′-AAAGACACTCCGGGGTAAATCTGACTTGAT-3′.

After incubation for 15 min, the cell extracts were prepared as described by Bell et al. (24Bell M. Capone R. Pashtan I. Levitzki A. Engelberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25351-25358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Hog1 was monitored using an anti-diphosphorylated p38 monoclonal antibody (Sigma). Protein levels of Hog1 were measured using anti-Hog1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).Measurement of Intracellular Ca2+with Fura 2-AM—The uptake of Ca2+ in the medium by yeast cells was measured using the Ca2+-specific fluorescence probe Fura 2-AM as described by Iida et al. (25Iida H. Yagawa Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13391-13399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, the cells were cultured in SD medium in the presence of 2 μM Fura 2-AM (Dojindo Laboratories) dissolved in Me2SO under darkness until A610 = 0.2. The cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with fresh SD medium containing 0.4% Me2SO, and resuspended in fresh SD medium with or without 8 mm MG. The cells were collected periodically, and fluorescence was measured with λEX = 340 nm and λEM = 540 nm and with λEX = 380 nm and λEM = 540 nm as described by Grynkiewicz et al. (26Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).Measurement of Intracellular MG Contents—The cellular MG contents were measured as described previously (27Maeta K.

A. 1996; 93: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar).Measurement of cAMP and glycerol—Intracellular cAMP and glycerol were extracted from cells with distilled water by heating cell suspension at 100 °C for 2 min. After removal of cell debris by centrifugation, the amount of cAMP and glycerol in the resultant supernatants was determined using a kit (cAMP Enzymeimmunoassay Biotrak™ system, Amersham Biosciences; and F-kit glycerol, R-Biopharm AG).RESULTSMG Induces Stress Response—Consistent with the high reactivity of the aldehyde group in nature, MG, a typical 2-oxoaldehyde, has been reported to react with DNA, RNA and protein to make adducts (for reviews, see Refs. 3Inoue Y. Kimura A. Adv. Microbial. Physiol. 1995; 37: 177-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar and 29Kalapos M.P. Toxicol. Lett. 1999; 110: 145-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). MG consequently disrupts cellular functions. To explore the effect of MG on cell growth in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, we monitored the viability of yeast cells after exposure to high concentrations of MG. As shown in Fig. 1A, 50 mm MG killed S. cerevisiae cells, and cell viability declined rapidly. On the other hand, when MG was added at low concentrations (8 mm) to the culture in which yeast cells were growing logarithmically, cell growth was temporarily suspended, but cell viability did not drop, and the cell growth resumed after 3 h (Fig. 1B). Du et al. (30Du J. Suzuki H. Nagase F. Akhand A.A. Ma X.Y. Yokoyama T. Miyata T. Nakashima I. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) reported that MG depletes intracellular glutathione causing the production of reactive oxygen species, and subsequently Ask1 is activated in Jurkat cells to induce apoptosis. To determine whether MG causes the production of reactive oxygen species in S. cerevisiae, we measured intracellular oxidation levels using an oxidant-specific fluorescent probe in cells treated with 8 mm MG. We found that the cellular oxidation level did not increase (data not shown) and thus concluded that a low dose of MG per se induces some kind of stress response, and the cells exposed to 8 mm MG may acquire tolerance to this aldehyde during the period of temporal growth arrest.To address this possibility, cells pretreated with 8 mm MG were exposed to 50 mm MG. As shown in Fig. 1A, the pretreatment of yeast cells with a low dose of MG conferred resistance to MG. Interestingly, the longer the period of pretreatment, the greater the extent of the rise in the rate of survival. These results imply that there is some regulatory system(s) to transfer the MG signal to the nucleus to induce MG-responsive gene expression resulting in the acquisition of MG resistance.MG Activates HOG-MAP Kinase Cascade—We have previously reported that GLO1 expression is specifically induced by osmotic stress in a HOG-MAP kinase-dependent manner (10Inoue Y. Tsujimoto Y. Kimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2977-2983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To gain further insights into the correlation between MG metabolism and HOG-MAP kinase, we determined the phenotype of a hog1Δ mutant in terms of its susceptibility to MG. The hog1Δ mutant showed increased sensitivity to MG (Fig. 2A). Hog1 is activated through phosphorylation by Pbs2 MAP kinase kinase, and consequently, a pbs2Δ mutant also exhibited susceptibility to MG (Fig. 2A). In addition, the hog1Δ mutant was impaired in the acquisition of tolerance to MG after pretreatment with a low dose of MG (data not shown).Fig. 2MG activates HOG-MAP kinase cascade.A, cells were spotted onto YPD agar plates with or without 20 mm MG and cultured at 28 °C for 3 days. B, hog1Δ cells expressing Hog1-GFP were cultured in the SD minimal medium until A610 = 0.5, and 8 mm MG was added. The localization of Hog1-GFP was monitored at the prescribed time. C, Northern blotting analysis of cells treated with 8 mm MG was carried out as described in the text. In each lane, 20 μg of RNA was loaded. D, phosphorylation of Hog1 and its protein level of cells treated with 8 mm MG were detected by Western blotting as described in the text.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5606-5614Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) and functions as a component of the transcription machinery (31Rep M. Krantz M. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8290-8300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). We monitored the intracellular localization of Hog1 using GFP-tagged protein and found that Hog1 rapidly concentrated in the nucleus after treatment with 8 mm MG (Fig. 2B). Subsequently, expression of the genes under the control of Hog1, such as GLO1 (10Inoue Y. Tsujimoto Y. Kimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2977-2983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and CTT1 (11Martinez-Pastor M.T. Marchler G. Schüller C. Marchler-Bauer A. Ruis H. Estruch F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2227-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar), was induced following MG treatment (Fig. 2C).Phosphorylation is necessary for the translocation of Hog1 into the nucleus (32Reiser V. Ruis H. Ammerer G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1147-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Both Thr174 and Tyr176 of Hog1 are phosphorylated by Pbs2. We determined whether Hog1 is phosphorylated using anti-diphospho-p38 monoclonal antibody. As shown in Fig. 2D, Hog1 is phosphorylated upon MG treatment. The timing of the phosphorylation coincided well with the nuclear localization of Hog1 following MG treatment (Fig. 2D). Hog1 was redistributed in the cytoplasm after 60 min of MG treatment (Fig. 2B), and concomitantly, Hog1 phosphorylation reverted to the initial level (Fig. 2D).MG Activates HOG-MAP Kinase Cascade in a Sln1 Branch-dependent Manner—Two osmosensors, Sln1 and Sho1, have been linked to the HOG-MAP kinase cascade (33Maeda T. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Saito H. Nature. 1994; 369: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar, 34Maeda T. Takekawa M. Saito H. Science. 1995; 269: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Sln1 associates with Ypd1 and Ssk1 to constitute a two-component (Asp-His phosphorelay) system, whereas Ssk2 and Ssk22 are redundant MAP kinase kinase kinases functioning downstream of this sensor (16Posas F. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Maeda T. Witten E.A. Thai T.C. Saito H. Cell. 1996; 86: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Sho1 interacts physically with Pbs2 (34Maeda T. Takekawa M. Saito H. Science. 1995; 269: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). To determine which osmosensor functions to activate the HOG-MAP kinase cascade on MG treatment, we compared the susceptibility to MG of the ssk1Δ, sho1Δ, and ssk1Δsho1Δ mutants. As shown in Fig. 3A, disruption of SSK1 enhanced susceptibility to MG, whereas the sho1Δ mutant did not exhibit hypersensitivity to MG. Hog1 phosphorylation upon MG stress did not occur in ssk1Δ, and consequently, the nuclear localization of Hog1 was not observed in this mutant (Fig. 3, B and C). Additionally, MG-induced expression of GLO1 was not observed in the ssk1Δ mutant (data not shown). Neither phosphorylation nor nuclear localization of Hog1 was seen in the pbs2Δ mutant (Fig. 3, B and C), indicating that the HOG-MAP kinase cascade is most likely to be activated through the Sln1 branch.Fig. 3MG activates HOG-MAP kinase cascade in a Sln1 branch-dependent manner.A, cells were spotted onto YPD agar plates with or without 20 mm MG and cultured at 28 °C for 3 days. B, cells of each mutant were treated with 8 mm MG for 15 min, and Hog1 phosphorylation was monitored by Western blotting. C, cells of each strain carrying Hog1-GFP were treated with 8 mm MG. After 30 min, the localization of Hog1-GFP was observed. All of the strains used have a hog1Δ background.

Tsujimoto Y. Kimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2977-2983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We then determined the susceptibility of the msn2Δ and msn4Δ mutants to MG to evaluate the contribution of these transcription factors to MG metabolism. We found that msn2Δ exhibited increased sensitivity to MG, whereas the sensitivity of msn4Δ was more moderate (Fig. 4A). We determined whether msn2Δ cells could acquire resistance to MG stress if pretreated with a low dose of MG and found that the msn2Δ mutant was impaired in its adaptation to MG stress (data not shown).Fig. 4MG activates Msn2.A, cells were spotted onto YPD agar plates with or without 20 mm MG and cultured at 28 °C for 3 days. B, WHI2 msn2Δ and whi2Δmsn2Δ cells carrying Mns2-GFP were cultured in SD medium until A610 = 0.5, and 8 mm MG, 0.5 m NaCl, or 0.4 mm H2O2 was added.

The absence of MT1-MMP from null mice or derived mouse lung endothelial cells or the blockade of its activity with inhibitory antibodies resulted in the specific decrease of in vivo and in vitro angiogenesis induced by CCL2 but not CXCL12. Similarly, CCL2- and CXCL8-induced tube formation by human endothelial cells (ECs) was highly dependent on MT1-MMP activity. CCL2 and CXCL8 significantly increased MT1-MMP surface expression, clustering, activity, and function in human ECs. Investigation of the signaling pathways involved in chemokine-induced MT1-MMP activity in ECs revealed that CCL2 and CXCL8 induced cortical actin polymerization and sustained activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and the small GTPase Rac. Inhibition of PI3K or actin polymerization impaired CCL2-induced MT1-MMP activity. Finally, dimerization of MT1-MMP was found to be enhanced by CCL2 in ECs in a PI3K- and actin polymerization-dependent manner. In summary, we identify MT1-MMP as a molecular target preferentially involved in angiogenesis mediated by CCL2 and CXCL8, but not CXCL12, and suggest that MT1-MMP dimerization might be an important mechanism of its regulation during angiogenesis.

The presence of an ELR (glutamyl-leucylarginyl) motif in CXC chemokines has been correlated with their angiogenic activity (4Bernardini G. Ribatti D. Spinetti G. Morbidelli L. Ziche M. Santoni A.

During the angiogenic response, ECs must degrade the basement membrane and the interstitial matrix underneath. MT1-MMP is a membrane-anchored matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) that can process several extracellular matrix components as well as cell surface receptors (12Seiki M. Cancer Lett. 2003; 194: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). MT1-MMP activity is regulated in ECs by modulation of its subcellular localization, internalization, and caveolae-mediated traffic, and it has been implicated in endothelial migration and angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo (13Gálvez B.G.

Blood. 2004; 103: 1296-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), we asked whether MT1-MMP might be a molecular effector of chemokines during angiogenesis. In this report, we identify MT1-MMP as a preferential downstream effector of CCL2 and CXCL8 but not CXCL12 during induction of angiogenesis in vivo and in vitro. We further show that these chemokines modulate MT1-MMP dimerization and activity in human ECs and that this action is dependent on the induction of cortical actin polymerization and PI3K activity. Antibodies and Reagents—Anti-MT1-MMP monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) LEM-2/15 and LEM-2/63 have been described previously (13Gálvez B.G. Matías-Román S. Albar J.P. Sánchez-Madrid F. Arroyo A.G. J.

Human EC Culture—Human ECs from umbilical vein were isolated and cultured up to the third passage as described (13Gálvez B.G. Matías-Román S. Albar J.P. Sánchez-Madrid F. Arroyo A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37491-37500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). ECs were seeded on dishes coated with 1% GEL and changed to HE-SFM serum-free medium from Invitrogen before performing the functional assays. MLEC Isolation—Mice deficient in MT1-MMP have been characterized previously (15Zhou Z. Apte S.S. Soininen R. Cao R. Baaklini G.Y. Rauser R.W. Wang J. Cao Y. Tryggvason K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Lungs from C57BL/6 wild type (wt), heterozygous (het), or null mice were excised, collagenase-digested, and further disaggregated to produce a single cell suspension. The mixed population obtained was first subjected to negative selection with anti-mouse CD16 mAb and then to positive selection with anti-mouse ICAM-2 mAb and anti-IgG-coated magnetic beads. The endothelial population was >90% pure as assessed by anti-mouse CD31 staining. MLECs were grown on a mixture of fibronectin, type I collagen, and GEL-coated plates with low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus Ham's F-12 and growth factors and were used up to the fourth passage. MT1-MMP expression was monitored in MLECs from different genotypes by Western blot. 2B. G. Gálvez, unpublished observations.. Flow Cytometry and Analysis of Receptor Internalization—Subconfluent ECs were grown on GEL and treated with or without the indicated chemokines for 6 h. Cell surface staining and receptor internalization were analyzed by flow cytometry as described (16Gálvez B.G. Matías-Román S. Yáñez-Mó M. Sánchez-Madrid F. Arroyo A.G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 509-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Briefly, receptor internalization was assessed by incubating ECs with the primary mAb at RT for 20 min, exhaustively washing with phosphate-buffered saline, and transferring to 37 °C for 6 h to allow labeled-receptor internalization. Half of the cells were then fixed and permeabilized for 10 min at 4 °C with lysis buffer from BD Biosciences, and all cells were processed for flow cytometry. The fluorescence of permeabilized and non-permeabilized samples (MFI) was detected on a linear scale for optimizing quantitation and analyzed at 0 and 6 h. Internalization percentages at 6 h were estimated with the following equation. Internalization%=(MFI in permeabilized cells) 6h−(MFI in non−permeabilized cells) 6h(MFI in non−permeabilized cells) 0h×100 Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Immunofluorescence staining with anti-MT1-MMP LEM-2/15 mAb was performed after fixation in subconfluent ECs on GEL-coated coverslips incubated with or without different chemokines for 6 h as described (13Gálvez B.G.

To visualize polymerized F-actin, cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-phalloidin after stimulation with chemokines and fixation. Cells were examined under a Leica DMR photomicroscope with a 63× oil immersion objective and photographed with a Leica CCD camera. Rac Small GTPase Activity Assays—Glutathione S-transferase-p21-activated kinase, which is recognized by active Rac, was prepared as described (20Vicente-Manzanares M. Cabrero J.R. Rey M. Pérez-Martínez M. Ursa A. Itoh K. Sánchez-Madrid F. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 400-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). ECs grown at subconfluence and stimulated with CCL2, CXCL12, or sphingosine 1-phosphate for 15 min or 6 h were lysed, and pull-down experiments were performed as described (20Vicente-Manzanares M. Cabrero J.R. Rey M. Pérez-Martínez M. Ursa A. Itoh K. Sánchez-Madrid F. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 400-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Zymography and Western Blotting—Subconfluent ECs were grown on GEL and incubated with or without different chemokines in serum-free medium for 6 h. Cell lysates were analyzed by fibrinogen or gelatin zymography or by Western blot with anti-MT1-MMP LEM-2/15 mAb or a mixture of anti-phospho-AKT Ser-473 and Thr-308 Abs as described (13Gálvez B.G.

To test MT1-MMP dimer formation, EC membranes were extracted in the hydrophobic fraction of 1% Triton X-114 lysates and resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE under strict non-reducing conditions or under reducing conditions. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Subconfluent ECs were cultured on GEL in HE-SFM medium, and after 6 h of stimulation with CCL2, CXCL8, CXCL12, or CXCL9, RNA was extracted with RNAwiz (Ambion, Austin, TX). cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA by reverse transcription. Quantitative PCR of MT1-MMP or actin (as a housekeeping gene control) was performed in a LightCycler using a SYBR Green kit (Roche Diagnostics) and two specific primer sets for MT1-MMP (5′-TCAGACCTTGTCCAGCAGGG-3′ and 5′-TTCAAATGAGATTGTGGGAAAATTGCT-3′) and for actin (5′-TCAGAAGGACTCCTATGTGG-3′ and 5′-TCTCTTTGATGTCACGCACC-3′). Ca2+Measurement—Subconfluent ECs cultured in HE-SFM for 24 h on GEL-coated 96-well plates (Costar Corp.) were washed twice and then incubated with 1 μg/ml of FLUO-4 (Molecular Probes) in Hanks' balanced salt solution and 0.02% Pluronic F-127 for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing with Hanks' balanced salt solution cells were stimulated with different chemokines, and intracellular Ca2+ concentration was measured at 1-min intervals with the DeltaScan Illumination System and Felix software (Photon Technology International). F-actin Polymerization Measurement—Subconfluent ECs were incubated with or without different chemokines in HE-SFM medium for 6 h at 37 °C. Intracellular actin polymerization was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline containing 4% paraformaldehyde, 1% Triton X-100, and 5 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes). Cells were then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, detached with cell dissociation buffer (Invitrogen), and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. Intracellular polymerized actin was then measured by flow cytometry in a FAC-Scalibur® (BD Biosciences). Cell Transmigration and in Vitro Angiogenesis Assays—Human EC or MLEC transmigration assays were performed in 8-μm-pore Transwell chambers (Costar) in the presence of different chemokines in the lower chamber. Matrigel assays were performed with 4 × 104 MLEC or human ECs added atop the Matrigel in the presence of different chemokines as described (13Gálvez B.G. Matías-Román S. Albar J.P. Sánchez-Madrid F. Arroyo A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37491-37500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Matrigel Plug Assay for Angiogenesis in Vivo—Female 12-week-old Balb/c or 1-week-old MT1-MMP wt, het, or null mice of the C57BL/6 strain were injected subcutaneously in the ventral midline using a 30-gauge needle with 0.5 or 0.25 ml of Matrigel, respectively, combined with different factors. Five to 10 days later mice were sacrificed, and the Matrigel plugs were processed for hemoglobin determination with the 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine liquid substrate system TMB (Sigma). A portion of the plug was also frozen, cut into 10-μm sections, and stained with hematoxylin alone or together with anti-mouse CD31 mAb to assess tube formation. Housing and procedures involving experimental animals were approved by the institutional animal care of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. Statistical Analysis—Test and control samples in the functional assays were compared for statistical significance by using Student's t test. MT1-MMP Is Required for CCL2- but Not CXCL12-induced Murine Angiogenesis in Vivo and in Vitro—Angiogenesis was induced in Balb/c mice by subcutaneous injection of Matrigel premixed with angiogenic factors and blocking or control antibodies as indicated (Fig. 1). CCL2-induced hemoglobin accumulation was significantly inhibited by the presence of the anti-MT1-MMP LEM-2/63 mAb, which recognizes the murine protease, whereas CXCL12- or VEGF-induced angiogenesis was unaffected; CXCL9 did not alter constitutive angiogenesis (Fig. 1A). In agreement with this, tube formation was induced by chemokines CCL2 and CXCL12, but only those capillary-like tubes generated by CCL2 were sensitive to inhibition by the anti-MT1-MMP mAb, as demonstrated by staining Matrigel sections with hematoxylin alone or together with anti-CD31 mAb (Fig. 1B). 2B. G. Gálvez, unpublished observations.. Angiogenesis was next analyzed in MT1-MMP-deficient mice (15Zhou Z. Apte S.S. Soininen R. Cao R. Baaklini G.Y. Rauser R.W. Wang J. Cao Y. Tryggvason K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4052-4057Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). CCL2-induced angiogenesis was significantly inhibited in MT1-MMP null mice compared with wt or het mice, whereas CXCL12-induced angiogenesis developed similarly in wt, het, and null mice (Fig. 2A). Staining of frozen Matrigel sections with hematoxylin alone or with anti-CD31 mAb also revealed that no capillary-like tubes were formed in the presence of CCL2 in MT1-MMP null mice, in contrast to wt mice (Fig. 2B). Similarly, cord formation induced by CCL2 was abrogated in MT1-MMP null MLECs and diminished in het MLECs, whereas the absence of MT1-MMP did not have any effect on CXCL12-induced cord formation (Fig. 2C). MTI-MMP Is Required for Tube Formation by Human ECs Induced by CCL2 and CXCL8, and Its Expression and Internalization Are Regulated by These Chemokines—We next showed by flow cytometry that the receptors for CCL2, CXCL8, CXCL12, and CXCL9 were expressed at the surface of human ECs. The MFI values for the corresponding receptors were, respectively: CCR2 = 25; CXCR1 = 22 and CXCR2 = 27; CXCR4 = 28; CXCR3 = 31. The negative value was 12. In addition, the anti-MT1-MMP LEM-2/15 mAb significantly inhibited cord formation in human ECs, by 70% in ECs stimulated with 10 nm CCL2 or CXCL8 and by 20% in ECs stimulated with CXCL12 (Fig. 3A). To determine whether the distinct ability of the anti-MT1-MMP mAb to impair chemokine-induced cord formation was related to the angiogenic potency of the chemokines, a dose response cord formation to CCL2 and CXCL12 was analyzed in the presence or absence of the inhibitory anti-MT1-MMP mAb. As shown in Fig. 3B, the anti-MT1-MMP mAb efficiently inhibited cord formation in response to CCL2 (from 10–100 nm), in contrast to only slight inhibition in response to CXCL12 (from 1 to 100 nm). We next showed that both CCL2 and CXCL8 increase MT1-MMP surface expression in human ECs stimulated for 6 h, in contrast to CXCL12 or CXCL9 (Fig. 3C). However, no changes were observed in the amount of total MT1-MMP protein, as analyzed by Western blot of whole cell lysates, nor in mRNA levels assessed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (Fig. 3, D and E). Because MT1-MMP levels at the EC surface can be regulated by internalization (16Gálvez B.G. Matías-Román S. Yáñez-Mó M. Sánchez-Madrid F. Arroyo A.G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 509-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), we next evaluated this. MT1-MMP internalization, close to 100% in untreated subconfluent ECs, was significantly decreased in ECs stimulated for 6 h with CCL2 or CXCL8 but not CXCL12 or CXCL9 (Fig. 3F). MT1-MMP Subcellular Localization, Activity, and Function Are Modulated by CCL2 and CXCL8 in Human ECs—The effect of the distinct chemokines in modulating the subcellular localization of MT1-MMP was then investigated. The number of MT1-MMP clusters present at motility-associated membrane protrusions of subconfluent ECs was significantly increased upon stimulation for 6 h with CCL2 or CXCL8 (2–3-fold) and with CXCL12 (1.5-fold); no changes were observed with CXCL9 (Fig. 4A). Because both the amount and clustering of MT1-MMP at the cell surface were up-regulated by CCL2 and CXCL8, we measured MT1-MMP activity under these conditions. MT1-MMP activity was significantly up-regulated by CCL2 or CXCL8 but not by CXCL12 or CXCL9 in subconfluent ECs, as assessed by fibrinogen zymography (Fig. 4B, top). To measure MT1-MMP activity in an independent manner, MMP-2 processing was estimated by gelatin zymography. As shown in Fig. 4B, bottom, the percentage of active MMP-2 was significantly increased in ECs stimulated with CCL2 or CXCL8, in contrast to CXCL12. These findings correlated with endothelial migration assays, in which the anti-MT1-MMP LEM-2/15 mAb inhibited migration toward CCL2 and CXCL8 by about 80 and 50%, respectively. Migration toward CXCL12 was only inhibited by 10% (Fig. 4C). In this regard, MLECs obtained from MT1-MMP null mice also migrated less efficiently toward CCL2 when compared with wt or het MLECs but migrated normally toward CXCL12 (Fig. 4D). Therefore, the dependence of CCL2- and CXCL8-mediated tube formation on MT1-MMP might primarily be mediated through an increase of MT1-MMP expression and clustering at the cell surface. CCL2 and CXCL8 Induce Sustained PI3K and Rac GTPase Activation and Cortical Actin Polymerization in Human ECs— Next, we aimed at elucidating the signaling pathways that might mediate up-regulation of MT1-MMP activity by chemokines. We first confirmed that all chemokines were able to similarly mobilize Ca2+, indicating no defects in their signaling.2 Because chemokines can induce a variety of intracellular signals, the effects of distinct inhibitors were tested on CCL2-induced MT1-MMP activity. As shown in Fig. 5, A and B, inhibition of Gi protein with Ptx, of PI3K activity with WMN, and of actin polymerization with CytD and/or LAT resulted in significant decreases in CCL2-induced MT1-MMP activity, as assessed by fibrinogen or gelatin zymography. However, JPK, which stabilizes actin filaments, the Ca2+ chelator EDTA, and the RhoA inhibitor C3 had no inhibitory effect (Fig. 5, A and B). Thus, PI3K and actin polymerization seemed to positively regulate MT1-MMP activity in ECs. To directly investigate this point we analyzed the phosphorylation of the PI3K effector AKT in subconfluent ECs; AKT was phosphorylated after 6 h of stimulation with CCL2 and CXCL8 but not with CXCL12 (Fig. 5C). Next, F-actin polymerization was investigated by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Polymerized F-actin was mainly observed in the cortical area, and its amount was significantly increased in ECs treated with CCL2 or CXCL8 for 6 h compared with untreated or CXCL12-treated ECs, in which F-actin was homogenously distributed throughout the cells (Fig. 5C).2 Rac can regulate actin polymerization (21Ridley A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2713-2722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and be activated by PI3K (22Welch H.C.E. Coadwell W.J. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Rac activation was observed in subconfluent ECs after 6 h of stimulation with CCL2 or the activator sphingosine 1-phosphate but not with CXCL12 (Fig. 5D). In other cell types shorter exposure to CXCL12 can activate Rac (23Vicente-Manzanares M. Rey M. Jones D. Sancho D. Mellado M. Rodríguez-Frade J. M Pozo A.d. Yáñez-Mó M. Ana A.M.d. Martínez-A. C. Mérida I. Sánchez-Madrid F. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4001-4012PubMed Google Scholar), and in agreement with this, we observed Rac activation in ECs stimulated for 15 min with either CCL2 or CXCL12 (Fig. 5D). CCL2 and CXCL8 Enhance MT1-MMP Dimerization in Human ECs in a Mechanism Dependent on PI3K Activity and Actin Polymerization—We next investigated putative mechanisms by which CCL2-induced actin polymerization might result in increased MT1-MMP clustering and activity. Because actin polymerization regulates mobilization of receptors at the cell membrane (24Schootemeijer A. Willigen v.G Vuurst H.d. Tertoolen L. Laat S.D. Akkerman J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 77: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 25Swaisgood M. Schindler M. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 180: 515-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 26Lub M. Kooyk Y.V. Vliet S.V. Figdor C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), MT1-MMP oligomerization was first investigated in ECs. A 120-kDa band was detected by Western blot with the anti-MT1-MMP mAb in non-reduced membrane fractions. Upon reduction, this band migrated at 60 kDa, strongly suggesting that the former corresponds to MT1-MMP homodimers (Fig. 6A). Remarkably, stimulation of ECs for 6 h with CCL2 or CXCL8 increased the amount of MT1-MMP dimers at the cell membrane by 4–5-fold, in contrast to a lesser or no increase with CXCL12 or CXCL9 (Fig. 6A). Neither MMP-2 nor tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 seemed to be present at the 120 kDa band.2 To explore whether signaling pathways involved in the CCL2-induced up-regulation of MT1-MMP activity (Fig. 5, A and B) were also implicated in MT1-MMP dimerization, signaling inhibitors were tested. Ptx, WMN, CytD, and LAT interfered with CCL2-induced MT1-MMP dimerization at the EC surface, demonstrating that PI3K activity and actin polymerization are required for this process (Fig. 6B) and suggesting that dimerization is related to MT1-MMP proteolytic activity. No effect on dimerization was observed with JPK, EDTA, or C3 (Fig. 6B). In this report we show a preferential involvement of MT1-MMP in the angiogenic response induced by CCL2 and CXCL8, but not by CXCL12, that might be relevant to certain inflammatory diseases. In addition, we characterize the signaling pathways involved in the up-regulation of MT1-MMP activity by CCL2 in ECs, which include activation of PI3K and Rac, and actin polymerization. Finally, we show that MT1-MMP dimerization in primary ECs is regulated by CCL2-induced signaling. Angiogenesis can be induced in chronic inflammatory disease by the prolonged exposure of ECs to cytokines and chemokines, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this response have not been elucidated yet (27Luster A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (3272) Google Scholar, 28D'Ambrosio D. Panina-Bordignon P. Sinigaglia F. J. Immunol.

In this regard, CXCL12 and CXCL8 have been shown to favor angiogenesis by increasing EC expression of VEGF and MMP, respectively (9Li A. Dubey S. Varney M. Dave B. Singh R. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 3369-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar, 30Mirshahi F. Pourtau J. Li H. Muraine M. Trochon V. Legrand E. Vannier J. Soria J. Vasse M. Soria C. Thromb. Res. 2000; 99: 587-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). MT1-MMP is implicated in endothelial migration, invasion, and in vitro formation of capillary-like tubes (13Gálvez B.G. Matías-Román S. Albar J.P. Sánchez-Madrid F. Arroyo A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37491-37500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar); we therefore investigated its putative role in chemokine-induced angiogenesis. Remarkably, the absence of MT1-MMP in null mice or MLECs derived from them and the blockade of MT1-MMP activity with inhibitory antibodies all resulted in the specific decrease of in vivo and in vitro angiogenesis induced by CCL2 but not CXCL12. In this regard, a defective angiogenic response to fibroblast growth factor-2 in MT1-MMP null mice has been reported (15Zhou Z. Apte S.S. Soininen R. Cao R. Baaklini G.Y. Rauser R.W. Wang J. Cao Y. Tryggvason K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4052-4057Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). We also report a preferential involvement of MT1-MMP in CCL2- and CXCL8-versus CXCL12-induced angiogenesis in human ECs. Our data show that CCL2 and CXCL8, but not CXCL12, increased MT1-MMP surface expression in ECs similar to other angiogenic factors and inflammatory cytokines (31Rajavashisth T.B. Liao J.K. Galis Z.S. Tripathi S. Laufs U. Tripathi J. Chai N-N. Xu X.-P. Jovinge S. Shah P.K. Libby P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11924-11929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 32Chan V.T.

In addition, CCL2 and CXCL8 increased MT1-MMP clustering at endothelial membrane protrusions, and this correlated with an increase in MT1-MMP activity. In contrast to previous reports linking MT1-MMP internalization with its activity (16Gálvez B.G. Matías-Román S. Yáñez-Mó M. Sánchez-Madrid F. Arroyo A.G. J.

Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 34Jiang A. Lehti K. Wang X. Weiss S.J. Keski-Oja J. Pei D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13693-13698Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), a partial inhibition of its internalization by CCL2 and CXCL8 resulted in an increase of its clustering and activity, suggesting that MT1-MMP internalization is not the primary regulatory event. MT1-MMP and/or MMP-2 might be important during the angiogenic response induced by CCL2, since both proteolytic activities are up-regulated, as shown by fibrinogen and gelatin zymographies. Occupancy of G protein-coupled receptors by chemokines results in mobilization of intracellular calcium as well activation of PI3K and its effectors (protein kinase C, AKT, Ras, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and small GTPases) and the JAK/STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) pathway (35Mellado M. Rodríguez-Frade J. Mañes S. Martinez-A C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 397-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). So far, only CCL2-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase has been shown in ECs (36Werle M. Schmal U. Hanna K. Kreuzer J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 56: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Herein, we describe that although CCL2, CXCL8, and CXCL12 quickly mobilize calcium in human ECs, after 6 h only CCL2 and CXCL8 induce the activation of PI3K and Rac and the polymerization of cortical actin. However, CXCL12 did induce Rac activation in ECs at shorter times, as reported in leukocytes (23Vicente-Manzanares M. Rey M. Jones D. Sancho D. Mellado M. Rodríguez-Frade J. M Pozo A.d. Yáñez-Mó M. Ana A.M.d. Martínez-A. C. Mérida I. Sánchez-Madrid F. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4001-4012PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, CXCL12 can also regulate GTPases and MT1-MMP activity in melanoma cells (37Bartolomé R.A. Gálvez B.G. Longo N. Baleux F. Muijen N.P.v.G Sánchez-Mateos P. Arroyo A.G. Teixidó J. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 2534-2543Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), pointing to cell type-specific events. Distinct signal responses to CCL2 and CXCL8 versus CXCL12 in ECs might be due to differences in the maintenance of signaling related to down-modulation or compartmentalization of the different chemokine receptors. In this regard CCR2 is internalized through caveolae in brain ECs (38Dzenko K. Andjelkovic A. Kuziel W. Pachter J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9214-9223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CXCL12 might also trigger alternative signaling pathways in ECs, leading to the expression of other genes relevant to angiogenesis such as VEGF, as reported (30Mirshahi F. Pourtau J. Li H. Muraine M. Trochon V. Legrand E. Vannier J. Soria J. Vasse M. Soria C. Thromb. Res. 2000; 99: 587-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Our data would suggest that inflammatory signals such as CCL2 or CXCL8 might trigger distinct molecular pathways during angiogenesis compared with homeostatic signals such as CXCL12. Because CCL2-induced MT1-MMP activity required actin polymerization, which can modulate lateral mobility of membrane receptors (24Schootemeijer A. Willigen v.G Vuurst H.d. Tertoolen L. Laat S.D. Akkerman J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 77: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 25Swaisgood M. Schindler M. Exp.

Cell. 1997; 8: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), we examined the putative oligomerization of MT1-MMP in ECs. Interestingly, CCL2 and CXCL8 significantly increased the amount of MT1-MMP dimers. MT1-MMP oligomerization in transformed cells can be mediated by the hemopexin and/or cytoplasmic domains and, in accordance with our data, can be modulated by Rac GTPase (39Lehti K. Lohi J. Juntunen M. Pei D. Keski-Oja J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8440-8448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 40Itoh Y. Takamura A. Ito N. Maru Y. Sato H. Suenaga N. Aoki T.

Chem. 2001; 276: 25705-25714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Here, we provide the first demonstration of a physiological mechanism for the regulation of MT1-MMP dimer formation by specific angiogenic chemokines in primary ECs. Signaling events required for MT1-MMP dimer regulation have also been analyzed. The requirement of CCL2-enhanced MT1-MMP dimerization on the activation of PI3K is in agreement with its role in chemokine-induced lateral mobility of β2-integrins (42Constantin G. Majeed M. Giagulli C. Piccio L. Kim J. Butcher E. Laudanna C. Immunity. 2000; 13: 759-769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Moreover, actin polymerization is also required for dimer formation. Thus, activation of PI3K by CCL2 might induce sustained cortical actin polymerization that would eventually favor MT1-MMP lateral mobility likely through caveolae. In this regard, RNA interference of caveolin-1 also impaired MT1-MMP dimer formation2 in accordance with the reported role of caveolin-1 in MT1-MMP traffic (17Gálvez B.G. Matías-Román S. Yáñez-Mó M. Vicente-Manzanares M. Sánchez-Madrid F. Arroyo A.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 678-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). MT1-MMP oligomerization has been proposed to increase its activity in transfected cells (39Lehti K. Lohi J. Juntunen M. Pei D. Keski-Oja J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8440-8448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 40Itoh Y. Takamura A. Ito N. Maru Y. Sato H. Suenaga N. Aoki T. Seiki M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 25705-25714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In our model signaling inhibitors that interfere with MT1-MMP dimer formation also impair CCL2-induced MT1-MMP activity, which strongly suggests that dimerization of MT1-MMP positively regulates its activity in ECs. Pharmacological intervention in MT1-MMP dimerization might be a future therapeutic approach for targeting angiogenesis in chronic inflammatory diseases. We thank Drs. C. Martínez-A.

The presence in RalF of the Sec7 domain, present in all Arf guanine nucleotide exchange factors, has suggested that recruitment of Arf is an early step in pathogenesis. We have determined the crystal structure of RalF and of the isolated Sec7 domain and found that RalF is made up of two domains. The Sec7 domain is homologous to mammalian Sec7 domains. The C-terminal domain forms a cap over the active site in the Sec7 domain and contains a conserved folding motif, previously observed in adaptor subunits of vesicle coat complexes. The importance of the capping domain and of the glutamate in the “glutamic finger,” conserved in all Sec7 domains, to RalF functions was examined using three different assays. These data highlight the functional importance of domains other than Sec7 in Arf guanine nucleotide exchange factors to biological activities and suggest novel mechanisms of regulation of those activities.

These data highlight the functional importance of domains other than Sec7 in Arf guanine nucleotide exchange factors to biological activities and suggest novel mechanisms of regulation of those activities. The subversion of mammalian proteins and functions by invading pathogens is a recurring theme in cell biology (e.g. Refs. 1Kahn R.A. Fu H. Roy C.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 308-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar and 2Knodler L.A. Celli J. Finlay B.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 578-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). After phagocytosis by macrophages, the human pathogen Legionella pneumophila (the causative agent for Legionnaire's disease) is capable of altering the normal progression of membrane traffic in the secretory and endocytic pathways to create a stable vacuole in which the organism replicates (3Horwitz M.A. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 158: 2108-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 4Kagan J.C. Roy C.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 5Kagan J.C. Stein M.P. Pypaert M. Roy C.R. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). An essential component in this process is the formation of a type IV protein secretion apparatus, encoded by the dot/icm genes, through which bacterial proteins can gain access to the macrophage cytoplasm (6Vogel J.P. Andrews H.L. Wong S.K. Isberg R.R. Science. 1998; 279: 873-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 7Segal G. Purcell M. Shuman H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Those translocated bacterial proteins then prevent the fusion of the phagosome with lysosomes as well as enlarge the stabilized organelle through the recruitment of vesicles and membranes from the endoplasmic reticulum through unknown mechanisms. A search for proteins that function in the secretory pathway led to the identification of a Legionella protein, termed RalF, that carries an N-terminal Sec7 domain, a ∼200-residue domain found in all guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF) 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; Arf, ADP-ribosylation factor; SeMet, selenomethionine; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PDB, Protein Data Bank; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; GST, glutathione S-transferase. that act on ADP-ribosylation factors (Arfs) (4Kagan J.C. Roy C.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 8Nagai H. Kagan J.C. Zhu X. Kahn R.A. Roy C.R. Science. 2002; 295: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). RalF shares 42% identity with eukaryotic Arf GEFs in the N-terminal Sec7 domain. There is essentially no sequence homology between the C-terminal half of RalF and any mammalian Arf GEF, although there is a predicted Arf GEF found by translation of the genomic sequence of Rickettsia prowazekii (40% identity with RalF in the C-terminal non-Sec7 sequence) (8Nagai H. Kagan J.C. Zhu X. Kahn R.A. Roy C.R. Science. 2002; 295: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Arf GEFs speed the exchange of GTP for GDP on Arfs, thereby promoting the activation of the GTPase, which also produces a more stable binding of the GTPase to membranes (11Jackson C.L. Casanova J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 60-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Arfs are required for the budding of nascent secretory vesicles and assist in the recruitment of coat proteins or complexes as well as serve as direct activators of lipid-modifying enzymes and impact traffic at a number of steps in the secretory pathway. RalF is transported through the type IV secretion apparatus and is required for the recruitment of Arf to Legionella-containing phagosomes (8Nagai H. Kagan J.C. Zhu X. Kahn R.A. Roy C.R. Science. 2002; 295: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). We report here the structure of RalF at 1.4 Å of resolution, the first structure solved for a type IV channel cargo or for a full-length Arf GEF. The structure reveals that exposure of the active site requires a re-organization of protein domains not previously anticipated. Protein Production and Crystallization—The open reading frame of RalF or the Sec7 domain of RalF was subcloned into the pHis-1 vector (12Sheffield P. Garrard S. Derewenda Z. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 15: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar) (a gift of Z. Derewenda, University of Virginia) at the NcoI and XhoI sites. The recombinant proteins had an additional N-terminal 28 amino acids, including a hexahistidine tag at position -24 to -19, in which the original initiating methionine was replaced by a serine. Thus, recombinant RalF contained 402 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 45,484.2 Da and an extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 30,580. Recombinant RalF-Sec7 contained 229 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 26,136.3 Da and an extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 11,520. The extinction coefficients were used to quantify purified RalF and RalF-Sec7 preparations. Recombinant RalF and RalF-Sec7 were expressed in BL21(DE3) cells and purified on Ni-IMAC (Amersham Biosciences) and Q methacrylate (Bio-Rad) columns. RalF was exchanged into 20 mm Tris, 20 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and concentrated to at least 20 mg/ml. RalF crystals were obtained by vapor diffusion at 21 °C with a 1:1 mixture of RalF and 0.1 m sodium acetate·3H2O, pH 4.6, 2.0 m sodium formate over a 0.5-ml reservoir of the crystallization solution. Large crystals of the space group P31 appeared 10–14 days after initial set-up and grew for about an additional 10 days. RalF-Sec7 crystals were obtained by vapor diffusion using 35% polyethylene glycol 2000, 0.2 m sodium acetate, and 100 mm Tris, pH 8.5. Crystals of space group P212121 formed after 2 days and continued to grow for another week. Although crystals formed, they were not of diffraction quality. By using initially generated nondiffraction quality crystals as seeds, diffraction quality crystals were obtained. Additionally, SeMet-containing crystals were obtained by expression of the RalF-Sec7 in BL21(DE3) cells in MOPS media, supplemented 30 min before induction of protein expression with lysine, phenylalanine, and threonine at 100 mg/liter as well as isoleucine, leucine, valine, and SeMet, all at 50 mg/liter. Recombinant human Arf1 was expressed and purified as previously described (13Kahn R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Yields of Arf1, RalF, and RalF-Sec7 were ∼40, 70, and 200 mgs protein/liter bacterial culture, respectively. Data Collection and Structure Determination—For x-ray data collection, RalF crystals were transferred to a solution containing the mother liquor and 20% glycerol. Soaked crystals were mounted on a nylon loop and cryo-cooled in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were measured at a wavelength of 0.9795Å, collected at -165 °C on an ADSC detector at the X26C beamline at the NLSL of the Brookhaven National Laboratories. RalF crystals diffracted isotropically to at least 1.4 Å of resolution. One heavy atom derivative of potassium tetranitroplatinate(II) (K2Pt(NO2)4) was obtained by soaking a fully formed crystal for 6 h in 10 μl of crystallization/cryo solution supplemented with 0.1 μl of water saturated with the platinum compound. The derivative data, including anomalous, were measured to 2.2 Å at cryo temperatures on a Rigaku R-AXIS IV area detector, with mirror-focused CuKα x-rays at 1.54 Å from a rotating anode source. Diffraction data were processed with HKL (14Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Using SOLVE (15Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar) and RESOLVE (16Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar), 12 heavy atom positions were found, of which two groups of six atoms each were related by noncrystallographic symmetry. Phases were extended to 2.5 Å with DM (17Cowtan K.D. Zhang K.Y. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 72: 245-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) of CCP4 (18Collaborative Computing, ProjectActa Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The initial electron density map allowed building of 16 α-helices (two groups of eight each related by non-crystallographic symmetry). Using RESOLVE_BUILD, part of the SOLVE/RESOLVE programs, allowed for the automatic model building, in addition to 10 rounds of manual re-building using O (19Jones T.A. Kjeldgard M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 173-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). The final refined model consists of 6066 non-hydrogen atoms and 1213 water molecules. The average thermal factor for the refined structure was 23 Å2, and no residue was in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot (20Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Diffraction quality selenomethionine crystals of RalF-Sec7 were grown by seeding with RalF-Sec7 crystals in 35% polyethylene glycol 2000, 0.2 m sodium acetate, and 100 mm Tris at pH 8.5 containing 15% polyethylene glycol 200 as a cryo solvent. Crystals grew as spokes on a hub and were separated before quickly mounting on a nylon loop and cryo cooling in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were measured at a wavelength of 0.9600 Å. The SeMet-RalF-Sec7 crystal diffracted isotropically at this wavelength to at least 2.16 Å of resolution. The Sec7 domain of the RalF structure was used as the search model for the molecular replacement solution by AmoRe (21Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1367-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) in the resolution range of 8–4.0 Å of the SeMet data. After cross-rotation and translation searches, the best solution gave a value for the monitor coefficient of 53.6. Initial rigid body refinement gave an R-factor of 40.0 and an R-free of 44.4. Manual building with the program O and refinement with CNS (22Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J.

Solvent accessible areas for the N-terminal RalF-Sec7 domain (residues -2–196) and C-terminal domain (residues 197–354) were calculated using the algorithm of Fraczkiewicz and Braun (23Fraczkiewicz R. Braun W. J. Comp. Chem. 1998; 19: 319-333Crossref Scopus (883) Google Scholar). Nucleotide Exchange Assay—Arf GEF activity was determined by measuring the rate of binding of [35S]GTPγS to purified recombinant Arf1, as described previously (8Nagai H. Kagan J.C. Zhu X. Kahn R.A. Roy C.R. Science. 2002; 295: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The concentration of Arf1 (1 μm) was 10-fold that of the Arf GEF in each assay. Reactions were performed in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, with 1.5 mg/ml azolectin vesicles. All experiments reported were repeated at least three times, with similar results. Secreted Alkaline Phosphatase (SEAP) Secretion Assay—RalF and RalF-E103K were ligated into the expression vector pGreenLantern (Invitrogen) such that GFP was appended to the N terminus of RalF. Plasmids encoding Myc-tagged ARF1-T31N, ARNO, and ARNO-E156K were described previously. For the SEAP assay, CHO FcγRII cells were maintained in minimal Eagle's media α (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and plated in 24-well dishes at a density of 3 × 104 cells/well. After an overnight incubation cells were cotransfected with 300 ng of a plasmid encoding a SEAP protein and 200 ng of the plasmid encoding the protein indicated. 18 h after transfection, the cells were washed, and medium was replaced. Aliquots of the supernatant were sampled 1, 4, and 7 h later, and SEAP activity was measured using the Phospha-light SEAP kit (Applied Biosystems). Intracellular-associated SEAP activity was measured at 7 h. Data are presented as the ratio of SEAP activity measured in the supernatants to the cell-associated SEAP activity. Arf1-GFP Recruitment to Vesicles Assay—An assay that measures the recruitment of Arf1-GFP to Legionella-containing vacuoles was used to determine the effect of Glu-103 substitutions on RalF function in vivo. The assay was conducted as described previously using bone marrow-derived macrophages from A/J mice that were transduced with a retroviral vector encoding Arf1-GFP (4Kagan J.C. Roy C.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 8Nagai H. Kagan J.C. Zhu X. Kahn R.A. Roy C.R. Science. 2002; 295: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Briefly, the indicated wild type and mutant RalF proteins were expressed from the plasmid pMMB207 in a Legionella strain derived from Lp01 that has the ralF gene deleted from the chromosome (8Nagai H. Kagan J.C. Zhu X. Kahn R.A. Roy C.R. Science. 2002; 295: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Macrophages were infected with Legionella and fixed after 1 h. Arf1-GFP staining of Legionella-containing vacuoles was scored by fluorescence microscopy for at least 50 vacuoles, and the data are presented as the mean ± S.D. from three independent experiments. The Cya fusion assay was used to test the efficiency of Dot/Icm-mediated translocation of the RalF Glu-103 variants into host cells. In this assay, the calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase enzyme from the Bordetella pertussis Cya protein is fused to the N terminus of the indicated RalF proteins in the vector pcya. 2Nagai, H., Cambronne, E. D., Kagan, J. C., Amor, J. C., Kahn, R. A., and Roy, C. R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., in press. Delivery of a Cya-RalF fusion protein into host cells results in calmodulin binding to the adenylate cyclase enzyme, resulting in the production of cAMP. Legionella strains derived from Lp01 that contained the indicated plasmids were used to infect CHO FcγRII cells for 1 h, and cAMP levels were then measured using a commercially available immuno assay (Amersham Biosciences). cAMP values are the average ± S.D. from three independent assay wells. Structure Determination—RalF (residues 1–374) and its N-terminal Sec7 domain (residues 1–201) were each expressed in Escherichia coli as N-terminal hexahistidine fusion proteins. Recombinant proteins were purified and crystallized as described “Experimental Procedures.” The RalF crystals diffracted x-rays to 1.4 Å of resolution, whereas the isolated Sec7 domain of RalF diffracted to 2.2 Å using a synchrotron radiation source. Electron density maps of the full-length RalF were calculated in the trigonal space group P31 using isomorphous replacement of a platinum derivative with anomolous scattering (Table I). The final model of RalF, refined to 1.4 Å of resolution, consists of two monomers per asymmetric unit, with an R-factor of 0.205 and an R-free value of 0.222. The last 20 residues (355–374) of each protomer were unstructured. The isolated Sec7 domain crystallized as a monomer in space group P212121. The Sec7 domain of RalF was solved by molecular replacement using the newly determined structure of the domain in the full-length RalF protein. The original data had been obtained from a selenomethionine derivative, and the final RalF-Sec7 structure is modeled as such, with final R-factor of 0.226 and the R-free of 0.282, refined to 2.2Å. Overview of the RalF Structure—The structure of RalF reveals two domains, an N-terminal Sec7 domain (helices A-J) and a C-terminal domain (strands 1–6 and helices K-P). The two domains are connected by a long loop (residues 190–201) (Fig. 1, A and B) that for the most part is bound tightly to the Sec7 domain and tethers the Sec7 and C-terminal domains. The N-terminal Sec7 domain is in the shape of a long flattened cylinder, as previously reported for isolated eukaryotic Sec7 domains (24Betz S.F. Schnuchel A. Wang H. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P.

This shape is generated by a right-handed superhelix, formed by helices A-G and ending with the three C-terminal helices, H-J. The topology break between the helical bundles harbors the Arf binding cleft. The catalytically active glutamate, Glu-103 (homologous to Glu-156 in ARNO) (27Beraud-Dufour S. Robineau S. Chardin P. Paris S. Chabre M. Cherfils J. Antonny B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3651-3659Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), immediately N-terminal to helix G, is in the center of the interface between the two domains. The C-terminal domain contains helices K-P and strands 1–6, forming a discrete and compact structure. The anti-parallel alignment of β1-β6 forms a concave surface over the Sec7 domain, whereas the convex side of the β-sheet is crowned by hour helices K, L, O, and P. We term this the Sec7-capping domain (SCD). The presence of folding motifs or similarities in three-dimensional structures between the SCD and other proteins was sought using DEJAVU (28Kleywegt G. Jones T. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 525-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and DALI (29Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar) searches. Among the top scores found were the COP-I γ-subunit fragment (Ref. 30Hoffman G.R. Rahl P.B. Collins R.N. Cerione R.A.

Pearse B.M. McMahon H.T. Evans P.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4216-4227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; PDB code 1e42), and Sec24, a COP-II coat subunit (Ref. 33Bi X. Corpina R.A. Goldberg J. Nature. 2002; 419: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar; PDB code 1pcx). Each of these structures was found to share a common fold consisting of five β-strands with one crossover helix between the first and fifth strands (Fig. 2), termed the platform domain (31Traub L.M. Downs M.A. Westrich J.L. Fremont D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8907-8912Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This domain in the α- and β2-subunits of AP-2 and the γ-subunit of COP-I is implicated in binding to a number of accessory proteins involved in assembly of both clathrin-coated and non-clathrincoated vesicles. Comparison of Sec7 Domain Structures—The solution of both full-length RalF and just the Sec7 domain allowed the comparison for the first time of the two and an assessment of the impact of sequences outside the Sec7 on its structure. The backbone traces of the two structures were aligned, and stereo images are shown in Fig. 1C (top). The two structures align almost completely, with a Cα-r.m.s.d. of 0.6 Å. This is not surprising given the fact that the primary sequences of the structures shown are identical, but it clearly shows that the presence of the SCD has no impact on the backbone structure of the Sec7 domain, although interface side chains are affected by the removal of the SCD. For comparison, in the bottom half of Fig. 1C we show the aligned backbone traces of the RalF-Sec7 domain with that of another Arf GEF, ARNO (PDB accession 1pby). These two domains share 41% identity and 70% similarity as well as extensive secondary and tertiary structure conservation, with a Cα-r.m.s.d. of 1.6 Å. Domain-Domain Interaction and Active Site Analysis—The interactions between the Sec7 domain and SCD are mapped onto three distinct areas (Fig. 3). The change upon separation in solvent-accessible surface area of the two domains as modeled is ∼2700 Å2, which corresponds to ∼13–15% of the surface area for each domain individually. The N-terminal region of the Sec7 domain interacts with a C-terminal region of the SCD in an acidic groove (Fig. 3B, left). This interaction involves three glutamates, three lysines, and a tyrosine (Tyr-326) from the SCD that extends into the Sec7 domain. Specifically, loop 6/P in the SCD forms a hairpin turn, which places Tyr-326 in between four regions in the Sec7 domain, allowing charges Lys-19 (loop A/B), Lys-21 (αB) and Glu-56 (αD) in the Sec7 domain to interact with Glu-329 (αO), Asp-327 (loop6/P), and Lys-323 (β6), respectively, in the SCD. The central, catalytic region of the Sec7 domain interacts with the center of the β-sheet of the SCD (Fig. 3B, center). The entire β-sheet of the SCD forms a domed surface over the N-terminal end of αG and the preceding loop, which includes the key catalytic residue Glu-103. Glu-103 is buried in the interface between the two domains and is critical for stabilizing a network of polar charge interactions involving both domains. This network of interactions involves Asp-60 of helix D interacting with Lys-106 of helix G, Lys-106 interacting with Glu-103, and Glu-103 interacting with Gln-276 of β4 and Gln-297 of β5. The third contact between the two domains involves the C-terminal portion of the Sec7 domain and N-terminal portion of the SCD. The Arf binding cleft of the Sec7 domain, previously described in eukaryotic Sec7 domain structures, interacts with the SCD, principally by hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 3B, right), mainly via αH of the Sec7 domain and αM and αN of the SCD. These two short helices are inserted into the loops between β2 and β3, and β4 and β5, respectively (Fig. 2). The complementary interacting surfaces are similar to the interactions observed previously between the Sec7 domain of Gea2 and Arf (34Goldberg J. Cell. 1998; 95: 237-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Together these three regions of contact between domains achieve a stably folded protein that allows for a number of hydrophobic side chains to be present on the surface of the interaction that would otherwise be exposed to solvent. Even the simplest comparison between the structures of RalF and that of a Sec7 domain bound to an Arf indicates that the SCD masks the Arf binding site and that these two domains of RalF must be rearranged to allow substrate binding. Comparison of the SCD and Substrate Binding to the Sec7 Domain—The occupation of the Arf binding site by a domain present in the Arf GEF was unexpected. Because structures are available for other isolated Sec7 domains bound to an Arf (Gea2-apo[Δ16]Arf1 (34Goldberg J. Cell. 1998; 95: 237-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar)) we compared the interactions of the substrate, Arf1, and the SCD to the Sec7 domain. As described in the previous section, the interaction of the SCD with the Sec7 domain is across three areas of the domain interaction face (Fig. 3). In contrast, the interactions between Gea2 and apo[Δ16]Arf1 are confined to the C-terminal portion of the Sec7 domain-Arf interface and the catalytic site (Fig. 3A, right). Thus, the interaction surface of Arf1 is shifted to the right of that seen for the SCD, as shown in Fig. 3. The Arf makes no contacts in Gea2 with the equivalent to the acidic groove in RalF. However, the Arf makes additional contacts with αI in Gea2. The overlap between the space occupied by the SCD and Arf1 is extensive, resulting in a similar interface area (∼2700 Å2), affecting residues in αD (Glu-56), loop F/G (99KLPGE103), αG (104AQKID108 and Gln-112), and αH (133–147) as well as residues 148–152 in loop I/H. The presence of the SCD in that location would occlude the binding of Arf to the active site. The comparisons above clearly suggest that the two domains of RalF must separate before the substrate, Arf, can bind the active site. Upon separation of the Sec7 domain from its binding partner (Arf or the SCD), residues previously buried become solvent-accessible. Of note is the large preponderance of non-polar-solvated surface by the separation of the SCD from the Sec7 domain. This leads us to speculate that a hydrophobic surface, presumably a biological membrane, will play a critical role in the domain separation and activation of RalF, as has previously been shown for other Arf GEFs, some of which contain specific lipid binding domains, e.g. a PH domain. The proposed need for both accessory proteins and membrane lipids for activation Arfs by RalF is completely consistent with roles for such agents in Arf biology in general and the activation process specifically (35Antonny B.

Here we report that SpeB, a cysteine proteinase secreted by S. pyogenes, is trapped by α2M bound to protein GRAB. As a consequence, SpeB is retained at the bacterial surface and protects S. pyogenes against killing by the antibacterial peptide LL-37. The significant human bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes expresses GRAB, a surface protein that binds α2-macroglobulin (α2M), a major proteinase inhibitor of human plasma. α2M inhibits proteolysis by trapping the proteinase, which, however, still remains proteolytically active against smaller peptides that can penetrate the α2M-proteinase complex. Here we report that SpeB, a cysteine proteinase secreted by S. pyogenes, is trapped by α2M bound to protein GRAB. As a consequence, SpeB is retained at the bacterial surface and protects S. pyogenes against killing by the antibacterial peptide LL-37. Streptococcus pyogenes is a common and clinically important human bacterial pathogen causing a wide range of invasive and non-invasive disease, as well as non-suppurative sequelae (for review, see Ref. 1Cunningham M.W. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 13: 470-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar). Work in many laboratories has underlined the significance of proteolysis in S. pyogenes virulence (for review, see Ref. 2Rasmussen M. Björck L. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These Gram-positive bacteria secrete proteinases and they inhibit/activate proteolytic cascades of the human host, including the complement, contact, coagulation, and fibrinolytic systems. As S. pyogenes penetrates into normally sterile sites, this will attract neutrophils, which, when activated, will release proteinases. Proteinases also leak from damaged cells and tissues into the infectious nidus. Combined this generates massive proteolytic activity, which has been suggested to promote S. pyogenes virulence by enhancing tissue spread and dissemination. However, to exploit this activity efficiently, the bacteria should also be able to regulate and modify the proteolysis they induce. It was therefore interesting to find that S. pyogenes expresses a surface protein called GRAB, which binds the proteinase inhibitor α2-macroglobulin (α2 M) 1The abbreviations used are: α2M, α2-macroglobulin; DTT, dithiothreitol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; AFC, 7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; cfu, colony-forming unit.with high specificity and affinity (3Rasmussen M. Müller H.P. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15336-15344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). α2M bound to the bacterial surface via GRAB entraps and inhibits host and S. pyogenes proteinases and thereby protects bacterial surface proteins and virulence determinants from degradation (3Rasmussen M. Müller H.P. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15336-15344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Among these proteinases is SpeB, a classical enzyme of S. pyogenes (4Elliot S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1945; 81: 573-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). SpeB is a cysteine proteinase that is secreted in large quantities by S. pyogenes. It has broad proteolytic activity and cleaves a large number of human proteins as well as surface proteins of S. pyogenes (for review, see 2). Like several other secreted bacterial proteinases, SpeB degrades and inactivates LL-37 (5Schmidtchen A. Frick I.M. Andersson E. Tapper H. Björck L. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), one of the major human antibacterial peptides (for review, see Ref. 6Zanetti M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 75: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). LL-37 is small enough (4.5 kDa) to penetrate into the cage that α2M forms around the trapped proteinase, which commonly remains proteolytically active in the cage. The hypothesis that active SpeB could be retained at the bacterial surface in complex with α2M and protect S. pyogenes against killing by LL-37 initiated the present investigation. Proteins and Peptides—The streptococcal cysteine proteinase was purified as described previously (7Berge A. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9862-9867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The activity of the purified protein was examined by active site titration as described (8Nyberg P. Rasmussen M. Von Pawel-Rammingen U. Björck L. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 1559-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The SpeB preparation used in this paper was 46% active. Throughout the paper the amount of active SpeB is given. To activate SpeB, the proteinase was incubated in activation buffer (1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT in 0.1 m NaAc-HAc, pH 5.0) for 30 min at 37 °C, and activated SpeB was used throughout this investigation. Since high concentrations of DTT were found to reduce the inhibitory capacity of α2M, the amount of DTT used in the assays was reduced compared with previous investigations (7Berge A. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9862-9867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 8Nyberg P. Rasmussen M. Von Pawel-Rammingen U. Björck L. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 1559-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The final concentration of DTT in all assays was 0.1 mm, which did not affect SpeB activity toward azocasein. To block SpeB activity, E64 (Sigma) was added to the proteinase to a final concentration of 10 μm. α2M was purified from human plasma as described (9Müller H.P. Rantamäki L.K. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 2833-2839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or purchased from Sigma. For some experiments α2M was pretreated with 0.5 m methyl amine for 20 min at 37 °C to convert α2M to the fast-migrating form (10Barrett A.J. Brown M.A. Sayers C.A. Biochem. J. 1979; 181: 401-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Plasmin from human placenta and bovine trypsin were from Sigma. The SpeB was radiolabeled using the Bolton and Hunter reagent (Amersham Biosciences, Amersham, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Labeled proteins were separated from free 125I on a PD10 column (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden). The cleavage site of SpeB in α2M was determined by Edman degradation of fragments obtained after incubation of α2M with activated SpeB for 15 min. LL-37 and Texas Red-labeled LL-37 were synthesized by Innovagen AB, Lund, Sweden. SpeB Trap Assay—Radiolabeled SpeB was mixed with 2.5 μgof α2M or 1 μl of heparinized human plasma in 10 μl of PBS and followed by incubation for 15 min at 37 °C. The mixture was subjected to SDS-PAGE using non-reducing conditions, followed by autoradiography using a BAS-III imaging plate. The plate was scanned with a Bio-Imaging Analyzer BAS-2000 (Fuji Photo Films Co. Ltd.), and intensity was calculated using the Image Gauche program. For competition experiments, radiolabeled SpeB and different amounts of proteinase were added to α2M simultaneously. The reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and the samples were put on ice. Analysis of Proteolysis—SpeB was mixed with 1% (w/v) azocasein (Sigma) in PBS and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Non-degraded azocasein was precipitated with 5% trichloroacetic acid, centrifuged at 10 000 × g for 5 min, and A366 of the resulting supernatant was determined. Alternatively SpeB was incubated with 40 nm Z-Arg-AFC (Enzyme Systems Products) (11Musser J.M. Stockbauer K. Kapur V. Rudgers G.W. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1913-1917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. Fluorescence (excitation 400 nm, emission 505 nm) was measured using a LS-5B luminescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). SpeB activity against LL-37 was determined by incubating 1.25 nmol of Texas Red-labeled LL-37 with 10 pmol of SpeB preincubated with PBS or 25 pmol of α2M. After various time points aliquots were taken, and E64 was added to inactivate SpeB. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 16.5% Tris-Tricine gel (reducing conditions). SpeB Binding Assays—S. pyogenes of strain KTL3 or its derivative MR4 (lacking GRAB at the bacterial surface (3Rasmussen M. Müller H.P. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15336-15344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar)) were grown to mid-log phase (A620 = 0.5), washed in PBS, and resuspended in PBS to a final concentration of 5 × 109 cfu/ml. The bacteria were preincubated for 30 min with PBS or α2M, washed three times in PBS, and resuspended in PBS. Radiolabeled SpeB was activated and preincubated for 15 min with PBS or E64 and added to the bacterial suspensions. After 15 min, the bacteria were washed three times, and the radioactivity of bacterial pellets was determined. Alternatively, incubation proceeded for various time points after the washing steps, and the radioactivity in the pellets was determined as described above. LL-37 Killing Assays—KTL3 or MR4 bacteria were grown to mid-log phase (A620 = 0.5), washed, and resuspended in 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.5, with 10 mm glucose (Tris-glucose). LL-37 (100 pmol) was pretreated for 1 h with different concentrations of SpeB, or SpeB complexed with α2M, and added to the bacterial suspension. After 2 h, the bacteria were washed in Tris-glucose, and viable counts were performed. Alternatively, for determining the protective effects of the α2M-SpeB complex bound to the bacterial surface via GRAB, KTL3 or MR4 bacteria were pretreated with α2M for 30 min. The bacteria were washed three times in Tris-glucose and incubated with activated SpeB for 15 min. After three additional washes, different concentrations of LL-37 were added, and viable counts were performed after 2 h. Initial experiments were performed to expand previous studies (3Rasmussen M. Müller H.P. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15336-15344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) on the relationship between SpeB and α2M. Proteinase entrapment by α2M results in inhibition of proteinase activity against larger protein substrates, and when SpeB was incubated with different concentrations of α2M, a dose-dependent inhibition of SpeB activity against azocasein was observed (Fig. 1A). The SpeB-α2M interaction was further investigated by mixing radiolabeled SpeB with α2M or plasma, followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. A fraction of the radiolabeled SpeB co-migrated with α2M, demonstrating the formation of α2M-proteinase complexes (Fig. 1B). Pretreatment of α2M or plasma with methylamine, converting α2M to an inactive state, or pretreatment of radiolabeled SpeB with the cysteine proteinase inhibitor E64, prevented complex formation, as did the addition of a molar excess of unlabeled SpeB (Fig. 1B). Proteinases are captured by α2M after cleaving a bait region within the α2M molecule. To determine the cleavage site of SpeB in α2M, SpeB was incubated with α2M and the resulting α2M-SpeB complexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The cleavage pattern indicated that SpeB cleaved α2M in the bait region (data not shown), which was confirmed by NH2-terminal sequencing of excised protein bands. A sequence corresponding to the α2M bait region was obtained, identifying a cleavage site between His699 and Val700. Papain has the same cleavage site (12Søttrup-Jensen L. Sand O. Kristensen L. Fey G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15781-15789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), further emphasizing the similarity in substrate specificity between SpeB and papain (13Collin M. Olsén A. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 7187-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 14Nomizu M. Pietrzynski G. Kato T. Lachance P. Menard R. Ziomek E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44551-44556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The SpeB trap assay was used to investigate the time dependence of the interaction between radiolabeled SpeB and a molar excess of α2M. The association between SpeB and α2M followed a hyperbolic curve reaching 50% association after ∼1 min (Fig. 1C). Both trypsin and plasmin are efficiently inhibited by α2M, and unlabeled trypsin, plasmin, and SpeB were used to compete with the binding of radiolabeled SpeB to α2M (Fig. 1D). SpeB and trypsin had similar competition profiles, whereas plasmin was less efficient in inhibiting α2M-SpeB complex formation under the conditions used. These data show that SpeB is inactivated by α2M when tested against azocasein in solution, and previous work has demonstrated that SpeB cleaves and inactivates the antimicrobial peptide LL-37 (5Schmidtchen A. Frick I.M. Andersson E. Tapper H. Björck L. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Since proteinases in complex with α2M generally retain their activity against small substrates, we investigated whether SpeB in complex with α2M was still active against LL-37. SpeB was pretreated with a molar excess of α2M, followed by incubation with Texas Red-labeled LL-37. Samples were taken at various time points and separated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A). The degradation pattern of LL-37 by SpeB is very similar to that of Pseudomonas aeruginosa elastase (5Schmidtchen A. Frick I.M. Andersson E. Tapper H. Björck L. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), which cleaves LL-37 in the region responsible for its antibacterial activity (15Oren Z. Lerman J.C. Gudmundsson G.H. Agerberth B. Shai Y. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 501-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, LL-37 was cleaved more efficiently when incubated with SpeB-α2M complexes than with only SpeB. α2M alone did not induce degradation of LL-37 (data not shown). When the activity of SpeB against the small fluorescent substrate Z-Arg-AFC (11Musser J.M. Stockbauer K. Kapur V. Rudgers G.W. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1913-1917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was tested, SpeB in complex with α2M was found to be three to five times more active than SpeB alone (data not shown). The molecular basis for the enhanced peptide degradation by SpeB in complex with α2M is unclear, but the observation was further substantiated in experiments with S. pyogenes bacteria. Thus, α2M-SpeB complexes inhibited LL-37-mediated killing more efficiently than SpeB alone (Fig. 2B). Again, α2M alone had no effect (Fig. 2B, 0 pmol of SpeB, filled bar). The results described above show that SpeB in complex with α2M effectively degrades LL-37 and that the presence of the complexes reduces the ability of LL-37 to kill S. pyogenes bacteria. S. pyogenes induces potent inflammatory responses leading to increased vascular permeability and leakage of plasma proteins, including α2M, into the site of infection. As mentioned, SpeB has broad substrate specificity, and when secreted the enzyme will encounter a complex mixture of proteins. It seems unlikely that a non-selective cleavage of a large number of potential substrates would be advantageous for the pathogen. By forming complexes with α2M a much more restricted activity, focused on small peptides like LL-37, is achieved. However, to be fully effective against antibacterial peptides attacking the bacterial cell membrane, the proteolytic activity should probably also be located at the bacterial surface. Most strains of S. pyogenes express GRAB, an α2M-binding cell wall-attached protein (3Rasmussen M. Müller H.P. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15336-15344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 16Toppel A.W. Rasmussen M. Rohde M. Medina E. Chhatwal G.S. J. Infect. Dis. 2003; 187: 1694-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To determine whether GRAB could mediate binding of SpeB to the bacterial surface via α2M, radiolabeled SpeB was added to the S. pyogenes strain KTL3 or to MR4, a mutant of KTL3 lacking GRAB (3Rasmussen M. Müller H.P. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15336-15344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), that had been preincubated with PBS or α2M (Fig. 3A). The results demonstrate that SpeB is bound to the surface of GRAB-expressing KTL3 bacteria preincubated with α2M, whereas only background levels of SpeB were associated with KTL3 bacteria preincubated with PBS, or with MR4 bacteria preincubated with α2M. Background binding was also obtained when radiolabeled SpeB was inactivated with the cysteine proteinase inhibitor E64 and then added to GRAB-expressing KTL3 bacteria preincubated with α2M (Fig. 3A, bar c). Following binding to α2M at the bacterial surface, the amount of surface-associated SpeB remained approximately the same for at least 6 h (Fig. 3B). To investigate whether α2M-SpeB complexes at the bacterial surface protect S. pyogenes against killing by LL-37, mid-log cultures of KTL3 or MR4 bacteria were incubated with α2M, followed by SpeB, and then washed. Subsequently, different amounts of LL-37 were added to the bacteria. After 2 h, the number of colony-forming units was determined (Fig. 3C). Compared with MR4 bacteria, KTL3 bacteria preincubated with α2M survived significantly higher concentrations of LL-37. No difference in sensitivity to LL-37 between the bacterial strains was seen without preincubation with α2M and SpeB (data not shown). Fig. 4 summarizes the observations of this study, demonstrating that α2M-SpeB complexes can be formed at the surface of S. pyogenes through protein GRAB and that these complexes protect the bacteria from killing by LL-37. Previously, other mechanisms for S. pyogenes defense against antimicrobial peptides have been described. SIC, another secreted protein of S. pyogenes (17Åkesson P. Sjöholm A.G. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1081-1088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), inactivates both LL-37 and the neutrophil-derived antimicrobial peptide α-defensin (18Frick I.M. Åkesson P. Rasmussen M. Schmidtchen A. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16561-16566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Moreover, apart from cleaving LL-37, SpeB degrades proteoglycans, thereby releasing dermatan sulfate that binds to and inactivates α-defensin (19Schmidtchen A. Frick I.M. Björck L. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 708-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Thus, S. pyogenes has developed different defense strategies against antimicrobial peptides. This apparent redundancy could be explained by the temporal aspects of an S. pyogenes infection. It has been proposed that the early phase of S. pyogenes infection is characterized by inhibition of proteolytic activity, including inhibition of complement activation, at the bacterial surface, while later phases are characterized by massive proteolysis due to the release of SpeB and host proteinases (2Rasmussen M. Björck L. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In this context, SIC would be an important early defense against antimicrobial peptides, being produced in the early growth phase (17Åkesson P. Sjöholm A.G. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1081-1088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). As the infection proceeds, SpeB production will start and soluble and surface bound α2M-SpeB complexes are formed. Thus, at this stage bacterial surface proteins are protected, and SpeBs activity is directed against smaller substrates, like antimicrobial peptides. When SpeB production further increases, the protective mechanism is overridden and bacterial surface proteins responsible for bacterial attachment to host structures will be degraded, probably facilitating bacterial spread (2Rasmussen M. Björck L. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 8Nyberg P. Rasmussen M. Von Pawel-Rammingen U. Björck L. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 1559-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). When the local α2M pool is depleted, SpeB will degrade proteoglycans, thus generating free dermatan sulfate that inactivates α-defensin. At this late phase of infection, activation of potent host proinflammatory systems by SpeB (20Kapur V. Majesky M.W. Li L.L. Black R.A. Musser J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7676-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 21Herwald H. Collin M. Müller-Esterl W. Björck L. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 665-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) will induce clinical symptoms of S. pyogenes disease. Since the discovery of antibacterial peptides (22Steiner H. Hultmark D. Engström A. Bennich H. Boman H.G. Nature. 1981; 292: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar), the significance of these peptides in the initial clearance of bacteria at epithelial surfaces has been firmly established (for review, see Refs. 23Selsted M.E. Ouellette A.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 114-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 24Lehrer R.I. Ganz T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 25Schröder J.M. Harder J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 26Boman H.G. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 173: 5-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). It has also become increasingly evident that proteolysis and inhibition of proteolysis contribute to bacterial pathogenicity and virulence. The finding that α2M-SpeB complexes protect S. pyogenes from killing by LL-37 represents a novel principle for the evasion of innate immunity and unites these lines of research. In this context, it is interesting that α2M-like proteins were recently identified in a large number of bacterial species (27Budd A. Blandin S. Levashina E.A. Gibson T.J. Genome Biology. 2004; (http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/6/R38)PubMed Google Scholar), further emphasizing the need for regulation of proteolysis also in bacteria. Notably, an α2M homologue was not found in S. pyogenes (27Budd A. Blandin S. Levashina E.A. Gibson T.J. Genome Biology. 2004; (http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/6/R38)PubMed Google Scholar), which, on the other hand, can bind α2M via protein GRAB. These observations support the notion that entrapment of proteinases through α2M and α2M-like proteins could be a widespread mechanism to direct bacterial proteolysis against smaller substrates, such as antibacterial peptides.

https://openalex.org/W2014112938,"Chronic NK lymphoproliferative disease of large granular lymphocytes (LDGL) is characterized by the expansion of activated CD3−, CD16+ or CD56+ lymphocytes. The mechanism of survival of NK cells from LDGL patients is unknown but may be related to antigenic stimulation. There is currently no standard effective therapy for LDGL, and the disease is characteristically resistant to standard forms of chemotherapy. We found evidence of constitutive activation of extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) in NK cells from 13/13 patients with NK-LDGL (one patient with aggressive and 12 patients with chronic disease). Ablation of ERK activity by inhibitors or a dominant-negative form of MEK, the upstream activator of ERK, reduced the survival of patient NK cells. Ras was also constitutively active in patient NK cells, and exposure of cells to the Ras inhibitor FTI2153 or to dominant-negative-Ras resulted not only in ERK inhibition but also in enhanced apoptosis in both the presence and absence of anti-Fas. Therefore, we conclude that a constitutively active Ras/MEK/ERK pathway contributes to the accumulation of NK cells in patients with NK-LDGL. These findings suggest that strategies to inhibit this signaling pathway may be useful for the treatment of the NK type of LDGL."
https://openalex.org/W1981394656,"Proliferation of higher eukaryotic cells is triggered by the proto-oncogene c-myc (myc), which is induced downstream of a large number of growth factor receptors. Myc, a basic helix–loop–helix leucine zipper transcription factor, transmits growth signals by up- and downregulation of target genes. The importance of Myc in growth control is well established. However, the number of growth control genes requiring Myc as an essential factor for regulation after mitogenic stimulation of cells is not yet clear. Here, we have studied the transcriptional programme of a human B-cell line, P493-6, in response to Myc and serum. P493-6 cells do not express the endogenous myc, nor is it induced by serum stimulation. Proliferation of the cells is dependent upon both the expression of a tetracycline-regulated myc gene and serum stimulation. Using DNA microarrays, expression profiling was performed following stimulation of cells with serum, with Myc, or with both. We observed serum regulation of >1000 genes. A number of these genes were synergistically or antagonistically regulated by Myc. Moreover, we identified >300 Myc-regulated genes that were almost unresponsive to serum. Gene ontology analysis revealed that a high proportion of Myc target genes are involved in ribosome biogenesis and tRNA metabolism. The data support our current notion that Myc is essential for the regulation of a large number of growth-related genes in B cells, and cannot be replaced by other serum-induced factors."
https://openalex.org/W2094804609,"The Wnt signaling pathway plays key roles in both embryogenesis and tumorigenesis. The low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein-6 (LRP6), a novel member of the expanding LDL receptor family, functions as an indispensable co-receptor for the Wnt signaling pathway. Although the role of LRP6 in embryonic development is now well established, its role in tumorigenesis is unclear. We report that LRP6 is readily expressed at the transcript level in several human cancer cell lines and human malignant tissues. Furthermore, using a retroviral gene transfer system, we find that stable expression of LRP6 in human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells alters subcellular β-catenin distribution such that the cytosolic β-catenin level is significantly increased. This is accompanied by a significant increase in Wnt/β-catenin signaling and cell proliferation. Finally, we demonstrate that LRP6 expression promotes tumorigenesis in vivo. These results thus indicate that LRP6 may function as a potential oncogenic protein by modulating Wnt/β-catenin signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2052870951,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa encodes two putative DNA ligases: a classical NAD+-dependent DNA ligase (LigA) plus an ATP-dependent DNA ligase (LigD). LigD exemplifies a family of bacterial proteins that consist of a ligase domain fused to flanking domains that resemble nucleases and/or polymerases. Here we purify LigD and show that it possesses an intrinsic polymerase function resident within an autonomous C-terminal polymerase domain, LigD-(533–840), that flanks an autonomous DNA ligase domain, LigD-(188–527). Native LigD and the polymerase domain are both monomeric proteins. The polymerase activity is manifest in three ways: (i) non-templated nucleotide addition to a blunt-ended duplex DNA primer; (ii) non-templated addition to a single-stranded DNA primer; and (iii) templated extension of a 5′-tailed duplex DNA primer-template. The divalent cation cofactor requirement for non-templated and templated polymerase activity is satisfied by manganese or cobalt. rNTPs are preferred over dNTPs as substrates for non-templated blunt-end addition, which typically entails the incorporation of only 1 or 2 nucleotides at the primer terminus. Templated dNMP addition to a 5′-tailed substrate is efficient with respect to dNTP utilization; the primer is elongated to the end of the template strand and is then further extended with a non-templated nucleotide.

The proteins required for eukaryotic NHEJ include a DNA end-binding protein, Ku, and a specialized end-joining enzyme, ATP-dependent DNA ligase IV (LigIV) (reviewed in Refs. 9Lieber M.R. Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 712-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar and 10Downs J.A. Jackson S.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Non-lethal loss-of-function mutations in eukaryal NHEJ proteins confer sensitivity to ionizing radiation and, in mammals, result in severe combined immunodeficiency. Until recently, double-strand break repair in bacteria was thought to occur exclusively through homologous recombination. However, the detection of putative homologs of Ku in several bacterial proteomes (e.g. M. tuberculosis, M. smegmatis, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptomyces coelicolor, Xanthomonas axonopodis, Bordetella bronchoseptica, Agrobacterium tumefaciens) suggested that NHEJ might be an alternative double-strand break repair pathway in some bacterial species (11Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1365-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 12Doherty A.J. Jackson S.P. Weller G.R. FEBS Lett. 2001; 500: 186-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This idea was underscored by the detection of homologs of mycobacterial LigD in many of the bacteria that encode Ku-like proteins (11Aravind L. Koonin E.V.

By analogy to eukaryotic NHEJ, these bacterial Ku and LigD proteins were suggested to participate in a novel prokaryotic NHEJ pathway (11Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1365-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). We have shown that M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis do indeed have a robust NHEJ pathway in vivo that depends on both LigD and Ku (4Gong C. Martins A. Bongiorno P. Glickman M. Shuman S. J. Biol.

The domain order varies among bacterial LigD proteins, e.g. M. tuberculosis LigD consists of an N-terminal polymerase-like domain, a central nuclease-like domain, and a C-terminal ligase domain, whereas the LigD protein of P. aeruginosa is composed of an N-terminal nuclease-like domain, a central ligase domain, and a C-terminal polymerase-like domain (Fig. 1). Although genetic analysis showed that the LigD protein is required for efficient NHEJ in mycobacterium (4Gong C. Martins A. Bongiorno P. Glickman M. Shuman S. J. Biol.

Indeed, it has not yet been demonstrated that bacterial LigD proteins actually have any catalytic functions other than DNA ligation (4Gong C. Martins A. Bongiorno P. Glickman M. Shuman S. J. Biol.

We show that the LigD protein has an intrinsic polymerase function capable of templated and non-templated DNA primer-extension reactions. Initial mutational analysis highlights the essential role of conserved aspartates that comprise the metal-binding site of homologous polymerase/primase enzymes from Archaea and eukarya. We discuss the potential role of the LigD polymerase activity in light of new mechanistic studies of mycobacterial NHEJ.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESP. aeruginosa LigD—The PA2138 gene encoding LigD was amplified by PCR with Herculase Enhanced DNA polymerase (Stratagene) using primers designed to introduce an NdeI restriction site at the start codon and a BamHI site 3′ of the stop codon. The cosmid DNA template used for amplification was obtained from the Pseudomonas Genetic Stock Center, East Carolina University. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and BamHI and inserted into pET16b (Novagen) to generate expression plasmid pET-PaeLigD encoding the LigD polypeptide fused to an N-terminal His10 tag. The insert was sequenced completely to exclude the acquisition of unwanted changes during amplification and cloning.The pET-PaeLigD plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). A culture (1 liter) of E. coli BL21(DE3)/pET-PaeLigD was grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin until the A600 reached 0.6. The culture was adjusted to 0.5 mm isopropyl d-thiogalactopyranoside and then incubated at 17 °C for 15 h with constant shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellets were stored at -80 °C. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Thawed bacteria were resuspended in 50 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 m NaCl, 10% sucrose, 15 mm imidazole). Lysozyme and Triton X-100 were added to final concentrations of 50 μg/ml and 0.1%, respectively. The lysates were sonicated to reduce viscosity, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was applied to a 2-ml column of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) that had been equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column was washed with 50 ml of lysis buffer and then eluted stepwise with 4-ml aliquots of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.4 m NaCl, 10% glycerol) containing 50, 100, 200, 300, and 500 mm imidazole. The polypeptide compositions of the fractions were monitored by SDS-PAGE. LigD was recovered predominantly in the 200 and 500 mm imidazole eluate fractions, which contained 12 and 18 mg of protein, respectively. An aliquot (3 ml; 9 mg of protein) of the 200 mm imidazole eluate fraction was dialyzed against buffer A containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm DTT. The dialysate was applied to a 1-ml column of phosphocellulose that had been equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 10 ml of buffer A and then eluted stepwise with 4-ml aliquots of 0.5, 0.6, 1.0, and 1.5 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol. LigD was recovered predominantly in the 0.5 m NaCl eluate fraction (which contained 2.6 mg of protein). The protein concentrations were determined by using the Bio-Rad dye reagent with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The recombinant LigD preparation was stored at -80 °C.LigD Ligase Domain—Gene fragments encoding LigD-(1–527) [Nuc-Lig domain], LigD-(188–840) [Lig-Pol domain], and LigD-(188–527) [Lig domain] were amplified by PCR with sense strand primers that introduced an NdeI restriction site at the beginning of the open reading frame and antisense primers that introduced a BamHI site 3′ of the stop codon. The PCR products were digested with NdeI and BamHI and inserted into pET16b to generate expression plasmids encoding His10-tagged versions of the putative Nuc-Lig, Lig, and Lig-Pol domains of PaeLigD. The plasmid inserts were sequenced completely to exclude the acquisition of unwanted changes during amplification and cloning. The recombinant proteins were produced in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified from soluble bacterial extracts by nickel-agarose chromatography as described above for full-length LigD.LigD Polymerase Domain—A gene fragment encoding LigD-(533–840) was amplified by PCR from the pET-PaeLigD plasmid template with a sense-strand primer that introduced an NdeI restriction site and a methionine codon in lieu of the codon for Arg-532. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and BamHI and inserted into pET16b to generate expression plasmid pET-PaeLigD-(533–840) encoding a His10-tagged version of the putative C-terminal polymerase domain of LigD. A double-alanine substitution mutation (D669A/D671A) was introduced into the pET-PaeLigD-(533–840) plasmid by PCR using the two-stage overlap extension method. The inserts of the wild-type and mutant pET-PaeLigD-(533–840) plasmids were sequenced completely to exclude the acquisition of unwanted changes during amplification and cloning. Wild-type and mutant pET-PaeLigD-(533–840) plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). Induction of protein expression with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and preparation of soluble bacterial lysates were performed as described above for LigD. The supernatants containing the WT and mutant LigD-(533–840) polypeptides were applied to 4-ml columns of nickel-agarose that had been equilibrated with lysis buffer. The columns were washed with 50 ml of lysis buffer and then eluted stepwise with 8-ml aliquots of 50, 100, 200, 300, and 500 mm imidazole in buffer A. The polypeptide compositions of the fractions were monitored by SDS-PAGE. LigD-(533–840) was recovered predominantly in the 200 and 500 mm imidazole eluate fractions, which contained 14 and 9 mg of protein, respectively.Glycerol Gradient Sedimentation—Aliquots (40 μg) of the nickel-agarose preparation of LigD or the nickel-agarose preparation of the LigD-Pol domain were mixed with catalase (30 μg), BSA (30 μg), and cytochrome c (30 μg) in 200 μl of buffer A. The mixtures were applied to 4.8-ml 15–30% glycerol gradients containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100. The gradients were centrifuged for 18 h at 4 °C in a Beckman SW50 rotor at 50,000 rpm. Fractions (∼0.2 ml) were collected from the bottoms of the tubes. The polypeptide compositions of the gradient fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Aliquots of the fractions were assayed for activity as specified in the figure legends.DNA Ligase Assay—A 24-bp DNA duplex containing a centrally placed 3′-OH/5′-PO4 nick was formed by annealing a 5′ 32P-labeled 12-mer DNA strand and an unlabeled 12-mer 3′-OH strand to a complementary 24-mer DNA strand as described previously (14Nandakumar J.

Ligation reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 pmol of 32P-labeled nicked DNA substrate, and ATP and LigD as specified were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. The reactions were quenched by adjusting the mixtures to 10 mm EDTA and 48% formamide. The products were resolved by electrophoresis through a 15-cm 18% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in TBE (90 mm Tris borate, 2.5 mm EDTA). The products were visualized by autoradiography and quantified by scanning the gel with a Fujix BASA-2500 imaging apparatus.Polymerase Assays—Polymerase activity was gauged by NTP- or dNTP-dependent extension of an 18-mer 5′ 32P-labeled oligodeoxynucleotide primer. The 18-mer primer strands were end-labeled by reaction with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP, purified by native gel electrophoresis, and (where indicated) annealed to a 4-fold excess of an unlabeled complementary DNA strand to generate the blunt-ended or 5′-tailed substrates depicted in the figures. The labeled and unlabeled oligonucleotides were mixed in a 0.2 m NaCl solution and then heated at 95 °C for 7 min, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. Polymerase reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm DTT, 5 mm MnCl2, 1 pmol of 5′ 32P-labeled DNA substrate, NTPs, or dNTPs and enzyme as specified were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The reactions were quenched by adjusting the mixtures to 10 mm EDTA and 48% formamide. The products were resolved by electrophoresis through a 15-cm 18% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in TBE. The products were visualized by autoradiography. Where indicated, the fraction of input primer extended was determined by scanning the gel with a Fujifilm BAS-2500 imaging apparatus.RESULTSPurification and Nick Sealing Activity of P. aeruginosa LigD—P. aeruginosa LigD is an 840-amino acid polypeptide consisting of a central ligase domain typical of ATP-dependent DNA ligases flanked by an N-terminal “nuclease” module that resembles the exonuclease III/apurinic endonuclease family of DNA repair enzymes and a C-terminal “polymerase” module that has similarity to the catalytic subunit of archaeal and eukaryal DNA primases (Fig. 1). LigD homologs with the same domain order are found in several other bacterial species, including A. tumefaciens and B. bronchosepticum (Fig. 1), as well as Mezorhizobium loti, Desulfitobacterium hafniense, Novosphingobium aromaticivorans, X. axonopodis, Ralstonia eutropha, and Cytophaga hutchinsonii (not shown). To evaluate the biochemical properties of PaeLigD, the protein was produced in E. coli as a His10-LigD fusion and purified from a soluble E. coli extract by nickel-affinity chromatography followed by phosphocellulose chromatography. The 97-kDa LigD polypeptide was the predominant constituent of the phosphocellulose enzyme preparation (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2Purification of PaeLigD and autonomous ligase-containing domains.A, aliquots (5 μg) of the phosphocellulose preparation of LigD and the nickel-agarose preparation of the Nuc-Lig, Lig-Pol, and Lig domains were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The Coomassie Blue-stained gel is shown. The positions and sizes (kDa) of marker polypeptides are indicated on the left. B, ligation reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 pmol of 32P-labeled nicked DNA substrate (see Fig. 3), 100 μm ATP, and 0.25, 0.5, or 1 pmol of the Lig, Lig-Pol, or Nuc-Lig domains were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. Enzyme was omitted from a control reaction mixture (lane -). The products were resolved by PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. The positions of the 12-mer 32P-labeled substrate strand (pDNA), the 24-mer ligated DNA product, and the DNA-adenylate intermediate (AppDNA) are indicated on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Recombinant PaeLigD reacted with [α-32P]ATP in the presence of either magnesium or manganese to form an SDS-stable protein-32P-adenylate adduct (data not shown). LigD catalyzed sealing of a singly nicked duplex DNA substrate composed of a 5′ 32P-labeled 12-mer strand and an unlabeled 12-mer 3-OH strand annealed to a complementary 24-mer (Fig. 3). In the absence of exogenous ATP, preformed LigD-adenylate catalyzed a single round of ligation, evinced by the conversion of the labeled 12-mer pDNA strand to a ligated 24-mer product (Fig. 3A). Only trace levels of the DNA-adenylate intermediate (AppDNA) were detectable in the absence of ATP. The yield of ligated DNA in the ATP-independent sealing reaction shown in Fig. 3A increased linearly as a function of input LigD (not shown). The slope of the titration curve indicated that 0.47 pmol of substrate was ligated per pmol of input LigD. Because ATP-dependent sealing is a single-turnover reaction, we thereby estimated that 47% of the LigD molecules had AMP bound covalently at the active site. Inclusion of 100 μm ATP resulted in a 2-fold stimulation of ligase activity (Fig. 3A). ATP addition also resulted in the accumulation of higher amounts of the AppDNA intermediate. Weak stimulation by ATP and ATP-dependent trapping of the AppDNA intermediate on a nicked duplex substrate is also characteristic of the LigD enzyme from M. tuberculosis (4Gong C. Martins A.

Ligase reaction mixtures containing either 100 μm ATP (+ATP) or no ATP (-ATP) and LigD as specified were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. The products were resolved by PAGE and visualized by autoradiography.

B, ligation reaction mixtures containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 pmol of 32P-labeled nicked DNA substrate, 100 μm ATP, 100 ng of LigD or LigD-(533–840) as specified, and 5 mm of the indicated divalent cation were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. Control reactions containing LigD or LigD-(533–840) but no added divalent cation are shown in lanes -.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The quaternary structure of PaeLigD was examined by zonal velocity sedimentation in a 15–30% glycerol gradient (Fig. 4). Marker proteins catalase (native size 248 kDa), BSA (66 kDa), and cytochrome c (12 kDa) were included as internal standards in the gradient. After centrifugation, the polypeptide compositions of the even-numbered gradient fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. His10-LigD sedimented as a discrete peak (fractions 16–18) on the heavy side of the BSA peak (Fig. 4A). The nick sealing activity profile was coincident with that of the LigD polypeptide (Fig. 4B). An S value of 5.4 was determined for LigD by interpolation to the internal standard curve. These results are consistent with a monomeric structure for LigD.Fig. 4Glycerol gradient sedimentation of LigD. Sedimentation was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, aliquots (15 μl) of the even-numbered gradient fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The Coomassie Blue-stained gel is shown. B, the sedimentation profiles of the nick sealing (•) and non-templated nucleotide addition (○) activities are shown. Ligase reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 pmol of 32P-labeled nicked duplex DNA, and 2 μl of the even-numbered gradient fractions were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Activity was quantified as the fraction of the input labeled material that was converted to a 24-mer ligation product. Polymerase reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm DTT, 5 mm MnCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, 1 pmol of blunt-ended 32P-labeled 18-mer/36-mer DNA substrate, and 2 μl of the even-numbered gradient fractions were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Activity is expressed as fraction of the input 32P-labeled 18-mer that was extended.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)An Autonomous Central Ligase Domain of PaeLigD—Fragments of the LigD polypeptide spanning amino acids 1–527 (a putative N-terminal nuclease-ligase domain), amino acids 188–840 (a putative C-terminal ligase-polymerase domain), and amino acids 188–527 (a putative central ligase domain) were produced in E. coli as His10 fusions and purified from soluble bacterial lysates by nickel-agarose chromatography (Fig. 2A). The purity of the 62-kDa Nuc-Lig domain, the 75-kDa Lig-Pol domain, and the 41-kDa Lig domain preparations was comparable with that of full-length LigD. The Nuc-Lig, Lig-Pol, and Lig domains were all capable of sealing the singly-nicked duplex DNA substrate in the presence of magnesium and ATP (Fig. 2B). AppDNA accumulated to an appreciable extent, no matter which domain fragment was included in the sealing reaction (Fig. 2B). We conclude that LigD-(188–527) comprises an autonomous ligase domain.Metal Cofactor Requirement for Ligase Activity—Nick sealing by LigD in the presence of 100 μm ATP required a divalent cation cofactor (Fig. 3B). Magnesium supported the conversion of the 12-mer pDNA strand to a discrete 24-mer ligation product. An additional minor species corresponding to AppDNA was also produced. Manganese supported nick sealing activity, but the product distribution was strikingly different, insofar as the ligated products consisted of a triplet of 24-, 25-, and 26-mer species (Fig. 3B). In addition, manganese prompted the appearance of discrete radiolabeled 13- and 14-mer species. Note that the electrophoretic mobility of the 13-mer formed in the presence of manganese was different from that of the 5′-adenylated 12-mer generated in the magnesium-containing reaction. The novel products seen in the manganese-containing reaction reflect ATP-dependent addition of nucleotides to the 3′ end of the 12-mer pDNA substrate and the 3′ end of the 24-mer ligation product (see below).Nick joining occurred in the presence of cobalt, although most of the ligated 24-mer that was formed was elongated to 25- and 26-mer products (Fig. 3B). The 12-mer pDNA strand was also extended by 1 or 2 nucleotides in the presence of cobalt. Cadmium, copper, and zinc were ineffective as cofactors for the nick-joining reaction (Fig. 3B). Calcium did not support the overall ligation reaction but did allow the conversion of the 12-mer pDNA to a discrete product of the size of AppDNA (Fig. 3B).Analysis of the divalent cofactor requirements for nick sealing by the isolated Lig domain, LigD-(188–527), showed that only the 24-mer ligation product was formed in manganese- and cobalt-containing reactions (Fig. 3B). Thus, the manganese and cobalt effects on the outcomes of the nick-sealing reactions of native LigD versus the isolated Lig domain highlight the presence of a polymerase activity in the full-length LigD enzyme preparation (see below). The Lig domain, like LigD, was unable to seal nicks using cadmium, copper, or zinc. Calcium supported the adenylylation of the 5′ pDNA strand (step 2 of the ligase pathway) but apparently did not suffice for the step of phosphodiester bond formation (step 3).Non-templated Polymerase Activity Associated with LigD— LigD is implicated in a recently discovered bacterial NHEJ pathway (4Gong C.

EcoRI/BamHI nuoG fragments digested from pCRscript/nuoG were ligated into a pMALc2g as pMALc2g/nuoG.Expression and Purification of the NuoG Subunits—Expression of the NuoG subunits with pET20b/nuoG (with or without a His tag) and pMALc2g/nuoG vectors was conducted basically according to Nakamaru-Ogiso et al. (12Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Yano T. Ohnishi T. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1680-1688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, competent E. coli strain BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with expression vectors, and the cells were grown overnight at 30–33 °C until A600 nm reached ∼2.0. After the cells were cooled down to 20 °C followed by the addition of 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, the cells were further incubated for 3–5 h. The cells harvested were suspended to 7.5% (w/v) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mm dithiothreitol, which had been degassed and purged with oxygen-free argon on ice before use. The cells were broken up by two passages through a French pressure cell (Spectronic Instruments, Rochester, NY) at 15,000 p.s.i. After unbroken cells and inclusion bodies were removed by centrifugation, the supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 60 min in a 70Ti rotor. The supernatant and pellet were analyzed for expression levels of each form of the NuoG subunit. The non-fused and His-tagged NuoG proteins were predominantly expressed as inclusion bodies with dark reddish brown color under all conditions we tested. In contrast, the MBP-fused proteins were successfully expressed in the soluble fraction. Therefore, the MBP-fused NuoG (MBP-NuoG) subunit was purified under anaerobic conditions (oxygen level <1 ppm) at room temperature basically according to the manufacturer's protocols. All solutions were degassed and purged with oxygen-free argon and equilibrated in the chamber overnight. The supernatant containing the MBP-NuoG protein was loaded onto an amylose column (1.5 × 5.0 cm) equilibrated with the column buffer, 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 200 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The column was washed with 60 ml of the same buffer, and then the MBP-NuoG protein was eluted with the same buffer containing 10 mm maltose and 0.2 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride.In Vitro Reconstitution of the Iron-Sulfur Clusters into the MBP-NuoG Subunits—The reconstitution procedures were carried out in the anaerobic chamber by a modified method of Yano et al. (10Yano T. Magnitsky S. Sled V.D. Ohnishi T. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28598-28605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 16Yano T. Sled V.D. Ohnishi T. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5907-5913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The purified MBP-NuoG subunit was diluted to 10–20 μm with the column buffer above containing 10% (v/v) glycerol. β-Mercaptoethanol was added to the protein solution at 1.0% (v/v), and the solution was gently mixed and left for 90 min. Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 and Na2S were added to the solution at a final concentration of ∼500 μm. The reconstitution proceeded for 2–3 h. Excess Fe2+ and S2- were removed by a desalting column (Bio-Rad, 10-DG). The reconstituted MBP-NuoG protein was applied onto a DEAE (Toyopearl 650 m) column (0.8 × 1.0 cm) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 10% (v/v) glycerol. The protein was eluted with 500 mm NaCl.Site-directed Mutagenesis of Individual Iron-Sulfur Clusters in the NuoG Subunit—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by using the GeneEditor™ in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system kit from Promega (Madison, WI). The pCRScript/nuoG (EcoRI/BamHI) plasmid was used as the DNA template. All four conserved Cys (or His) residues in each iron-sulfur cluster were mutated to Ala subsequently. Mutated DNA fragments, EcoRI/NruI (∼1 kb) for ΔN1b(C36A,C47A,C50A, C69A), ΔN5(H101A,C105A,C108A,C114A), and ΔN4(C153A,C156A, C159A,C203A) and BglII/NruI (∼1 kb) for ΔN1c(C230A,C233A,C237A, C265A), were ligated to the original pMALc2g/nuoG plasmid by using intrinsic sites in the nuoG. The final constructs were designated pMALc2g/nuoGΔN1b, pMALc2g/nuoGΔN5, pMALc2g/nuoGΔN4, and pMALc2g/nuoGΔN1c. Expression, purification, and reconstitution of the MBP-NuoG mutants were conducted according to the same procedure as described for the wild type.Cloning of the E. coli nuoG Gene and Construction of the nuoG Knock-out Strain [Δ(nuoG::Spc)]—The gene encoding the NuoG subunit, together with an ∼210-bp DNA segment upstream and an ∼220-bp DNA segment downstream, was cloned by PCR from genomic DNA-purified E. coli DH5α. We used intrinsic sites SmaI for the sense primer, 5′-CTTAGGCCCGGGTAAAACTTTCTGTGCCCACGC-3′, and BglII or BamHI for the antisense primers, 5′-CGCCCAGATCTGTACCGTCAGCGTAATC-3′ or 5′-CCGAGAATTTCGGGATCCAGTCTTCTTTAAAGAAC-3′, respectively (the italicized bases represent the restriction site sequence). The spectinomycin (spc) gene cassette from the Staphylococcus aureus transposon Tn554 (25Murphy E. Huwyler L. de Freire Bastos Mdo C. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3357-3365Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) was cloned by PCR. The DNA fragments were assembled together with the spc cassette by using the intrinsic BglII site in pCRScript and finally transferred to pKO3. The resulting construct was designated pKO3 (nuoG-spc). The E. coli strain MC4100 was transformed with the pKO3 (nuoG-spc) plasmid, and homologous recombination was carried out as described in Link et al. (26Link A.J. Phillips D. Church G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6228-6237Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). The presence of the spc cassette and its location in the genomic nuoG gene were verified by PCR and DNA sequencing.Membrane Preparation—The cell pellet was resuspended at 10% (w/v) in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 15% (w/v) glycerol. The cell suspension was then passed once in a French press at 20,000 p.s.i. and centrifuged again in the GSA rotor at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. Cell debris was discarded, and the supernatant was then ultracentrifuged in a 70Ti rotor at 50,000 rpm for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in the same buffer and was used immediately for various analyses.EPR Spectroscopy—EPR samples were prepared in an anaerobic chamber, and the redox mediators, methyl viologen and benzyl viologen, were added at 5 μm each. Anaerobically prepared neutralized sodium dithionite solution (0.5 m) was added at 10 mm of a final concentration. The protein solution was transferred to an EPR tube, and after 5–10 min of incubation at room temperature, the samples were quickly frozen in dry ice/ethanol mixture and then stored in liquid nitrogen until EPR analyses. EPR spectra were recorded by a Bruker ESP 300E spectrometer at X-band (9.4 GHz) using an Oxford Instrument ESR900 helium flow cryostat, a Hewlett Packard 5350B microwave frequency counter, and an ITC4 temperature controller to control sample temperatures. EPR spectra of the iron-sulfur clusters were simulated by SimFonia (Bruker). Spin quantitations were carried out under non-saturating conditions using 0.5 mm Cu(II)EDTA or 0.5 mm Cu(II) perchlorate as standards according to Aasa et al. (27Aasa R. Vanngard T. Dunford H.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 391: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Power saturation data were analyzed by a computer fitting method (28Vinogradov A.D. Sled V.D. Burbaev D.S.

Yano T. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9120-9127Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The antibodies were affinity-purified according to Han et al. (31Han A.L. Yagi T. Hatefi Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 275: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Other Analytical Procedures—UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded on a Beckman DU640 spectrophotometer at room temperature. Protein estimation was routinely done by the method of Lowry et al. (32Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Bradford (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and blue native PAGE were carried out according to Laemmli (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar) and Schägger (35Schägger H.

Any variations from the procedures and other details are described in the figure legends.RESULTSExpression, Isolation, and Reconstitution of the MBP-NuoG Subunit and Its Iron-Sulfur Cluster Mutants—The purified wild type, MBP-NuoG(WT), was reddish-brown and exhibited absorption spectra as shown in Fig. 2A, which were similar to those of its homologue, the MBP-fused T. thermophilus Nqo3 subunit described by Nakamaru-Ogiso et al. (12Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Yano T. Ohnishi T. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1680-1688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The purified MBP-NuoG(WT) contained only 1.9 mol of non-heme Fe and 1.4 mol of S2-/mol of protein, indicating that the iron-sulfur cluster contents were much lower than expected amounts (12 or 14 mol of each Fe and S2-/mol of protein). However, the contents of non-heme iron and acid-labile sulfide in MBP-NuoG(WT) were significantly improved upon the in vitro reconstitution to 7.9 mol of Fe and 5.9 mol of S2-/mol of protein on average. The absorption spectrum of the reconstituted MBP-NuoG(WT) exhibited a broad shoulder around 380–420 nm with a tailing reaching 700 nm. The absorption spectrum did not show peaks at 320, 460, and 560 nm, which are prominent for [2Fe-2S] clusters, suggesting that the reconstitution of a binuclear cluster(s) in the NuoG subunit was not successful (Fig. 2B). UV-visible spectra of the reconstituted MBP-NuoG mutants showed slightly different spectral features (Fig. 2, B and C). A broad absorption peak around 420 nm, which is characteristic of [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters, was lower than that of wild type. The absorbance was roughly proportional to the iron-sulfur cluster contents in the reconstituted subunits, most likely because of the inactivation of the putative iron-sulfur cluster binding motifs (Fig. 2, B and C).Fig. 2UV-visible absorption spectra of the MBP-NuoG subunit, as purified (A) and after reconstitution of iron-sulfur clusters (B), and of the reconstituted MBP-NuoG mutants (C).A and B, thick solid lines, the oxidized forms; thin solid lines, the reduced forms by addition of 10 mm sodium dithionite.

First, we examined EPR spectra of the dithionite-reduced samples at the g = 2 region at 40–60 K. We did not detect any EPR signals in all preparations including MBP-NuoG(WT), indicating that the reconstituted subunits did not contain the binuclear cluster N1b (results not shown). When EPR spectra were measured at 6–30 K, EPR signals arising from [4Fe-4S]1+ clusters were detected, and the individual samples exhibited different spectra. As shown in Fig. 3, MBP-NuoG(WT) displayed multiple EPR resonances with g values of 1.89, 1.91, 1.94, and 2.05 at 12 K and 5 mW. At 6 K, EPR signals at g = 1.91 and g = 2.05 became smaller and broader because of the saturation, whereas the signal at g = 1.89 and a broad resonance at g = 2.06 became more pronounced. Further inspection of the EPR spectra at 4–50 K and 5 mW showed that the g = 1.91 and g = 2.05 resonances were best seen at 14–16 K, whereas the EPR signals at g = 1.89 and g = 2.06 showed the optimal temperature at ∼10 K. These observations indicate that MBP-NuoG(WT) contains at least two distinct [4Fe-4S] clusters. The mutants, MBP-NuoGΔN5 (Fig. 3) and MBP-NuoGΔN1b (data not shown), exhibited almost the same EPR spectra as those of MBP-NuoG(WT) under these conditions except that slight g value shifts were noticed. When MBP-NuoGΔN5 was examined at 4 K and various microwave power levels, the g = 1.91 resonance was readily saturated at low power levels (P½ ∼0.02 mW at 4 K), whereas the signals at g = 1.89 and g = 2.06 were saturated at higher power levels (P½ ∼1.0 mW at 4 K). In contrast, MBP-NuoGΔN4 showed different EPR spectra. At 12 K, it showed the EPR signal with gx,y,z = 1.91, 1.94, and 2.05. However, the EPR signals at g = 1.89 and g = 2.06 were absent. At 6 K, the EPR signal was partially saturated, and the line width became broader. The behaviors of this EPR signal were similar to the corresponding EPR signals observed in wild type, MBP-NuoGΔN1b, and MBP-NuoGΔN5. From these observations, it was concluded that the EPR signal with gx,y,z = 1.89, 1.94, and 2.06 arose from the [4Fe-4S] cluster coordinated in the N4 binding site.MBP-NuoGΔN1c exhibited very small and broad EPR signals at both 6 and 12 K, which were completely different from the EPR signals arising from the two [4Fe-4S] clusters detected in MBP-NuoG(WT) (Fig. 3). The contents of non-heme iron and acid-labile sulfide in this mutant after in vitro reconstitution were the lowest among all of the preparations, indicating that the inactivation of the N1c cluster-binding motif severely affected in vitro incorporation of the iron-sulfur cluster into this protein. Because the EPR signal with gx,y,z = 1.91, 1.94, and 2.05 was detected in wild type and all other mutant subunits except for MBP-NuoGΔN1c, we concluded that the EPR signal arose from the [4Fe-4S] cluster coordinated in the N1c motif.To resolve the EPR spectra of these two [4Fe-4S] clusters, we attempted to simulate the EPR spectra of MBP-NuoGΔN5 that contained only two [4Fe-4S], one each in the N4 and N1c binding sites. For the first approximation, we retrieved EPR parameters for the [4Fe-4S] cluster coordinated in the N1c binding site from the EPR spectrum of MBP-NuoGΔN4 measured at 14 K and 5 mW. Under this condition, neither of the EPR signals of the two [4Fe-4S] clusters was saturated, and almost no contribution from other iron-sulfur clusters can be assumed. Then, the second [4Fe-4S] cluster EPR signal was simulated. Fig. 4A shows the EPR spectra of MBP-NuoGΔN5 using the following parameters for the two [4Fe-4S] clusters: for cluster N1c, gx,y,z = 1.91, 1.94, and 2.05, Lx,y,z = 21, 12, and 12.5 gauss; and for cluster N4, gx,y,z = 1.89, 1.94, and 2.06, Lx,y,z = 55, 38, and 65 gauss. The ratio of the clusters was estimated to be N1c:N4 = 3:1. Using these parameters, we obtained a reasonably good fit for the EPR spectrum of MBP-NuoG(WT) at 14 K and 5 mW (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4EPR spectra of the two iron-sulfur clusters detected in the reconstituted MBP-NuoGΔN5 (A) and MBP-NuoG(WT) subunits (B) at 14 K and at 5 mW.Solid lines are experimental EPR data.

The mechanisms by which PGE2 promotes tumor growth and metastasis through stimulation of cell migration, invasion, and angiogenesis have been fairly well characterized. Much less is known, however, about the molecular mechanisms responsible for the immunosuppressive effects of PGE2. We identified PGE2 target genes and subsequently studied their biologic role in colorectal cancer cells. The complement regulatory protein decay-accelerating factor (DAF or CD55) was induced following PGE2 treatment of LS174T colon cancer cells. Analysis of PGE2-mediated activation of the DAF promoter employing 5′-deletion luciferase constructs suggests that regulation occurs at the transcriptional level via a cyclic AMP/protein kinase A-dependent pathway. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs blocked DAF expression in HCA-7 colon cancer cells, which could be restored by the addition of exogenous PGE2. Finally, we observed an increase in DAF expression in the intestinal mucosa of ApcMin+/- mice treated with PGE2in vivo.

Symp.256. 49-52, 266-2692004: 6-28Google Scholar), and COX-2-derived PGE2 can signal via four distinct G-protein-coupled cell surface receptors (EP1-EP4) (28Breyer R.M. Bagdassarian C.K. Myers S.A. Breyer M.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 661-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Activation of EP2 and EP4 receptors leads to increased intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels through activation of Gαs-coupled protein. High levels of cAMP stimulate the cAMP-dependent kinase, protein kinase A, which ultimately increases expression of cAMP-responsive genes. In contrast, the activation of EP3 leads to decreased cAMP levels, whereas EP1 does not directly regulate intracellular levels of cAMP but increases free cytosolic Ca2+ levels through activation of Gαq.Numerous reports have demonstrated increased expression of COX-2 in a variety of human malignancies (29Subbaramaiah K. Dannenberg A.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 96-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 30DuBois R.N. Prog. Exp. Tumor Res. 2003; 37: 124-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and high COX-2 expression correlates with a poor clinical outcome (31DeLong P. Tanaka T. Kruklitis R. Henry A.C. Kapoor V. Kaiser L.R. Sterman D.H. Albelda S.M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7845-7852PubMed Google Scholar). High levels of COX-2-derived PGE2 is associated with resistance to programmed cell death (32Sheng H. Shao J. Morrow J.D. Beauchamp R.D. DuBois R.N. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 362-366PubMed Google Scholar) as well as increased cell migration, proliferation, and angiogenesis (33Rozic J.G. Chakraborty C. Lala P.K. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 93: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Immunosuppressive roles of PGE2 reported previously include suppression of T- and B-cell proliferation (34Klingemann H.G. Tsoi M.S. Storb R. Blood. 1986; 68: 102-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as modulation of professional antigen-presenting cell activity (5Phipps R.P. Roper R.L. Stein S.H. Immunol. Rev. 1990; 117: 135-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Finally, elevated PGE2 contributes to malignancy through immunosuppression of natural killer cell cytotoxicity (35Baxevanis C.N.

Kapsenberg M.L. Eur. Respir. J. 1996; 22: 90s-94sGoogle Scholar).We sought to identify PGE2-regulated genes downstream of elevated COX-2 activity in colon cancer. Using a variety of approaches, we present data in this study suggesting that decay-accelerating factor, a complement regulatory protein, is a direct target of PGE2 in LS174T colon carcinoma cells. This is the first indication that prostaglandins regulate components of the complement cascade, which may allow malignant cells to evade complement-mediated cytotoxicity and contribute to carcinogenesis. Ultimately, this novel observation may shed light on the adverse clinical outcomes of patients with high levels of tumor-derived cyclooxygenase-2.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Prostaglandins (PGE2, PGA2, PGD2, PGF2α, thromboxane B2, and PGJ2) and antibody to COX-2 (catalogue number 160106) were obtained from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). LY294002, H-89, and cholera toxin were purchased from Calbiochem. Antibodies to DAF (catalogue number SC-9156) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and monoclonal β-actin antibody and 3,3-diaminobenzidine were obtained from Sigma.Cell Culture—LS174T, HCT-15, and OVCAR-3 cells were purchased from the ATCC (Manassas, VA), and HCA-7 cells were a generous gift from Susan Kirkland. LS174T, HCT-15, and HCA-7 cells were maintained in McCoy's 5A medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. OVCAR-3 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 media containing 20% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.Northern Blotting—Total cellular RNA was isolated from cells by TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) following the manufacturer's protocol. Five micrograms of total RNA were fractionated with a MOPS-formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to Hybond N1 membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Following UV cross-linking, the blots were prehybridized for 30 min at 42 °C in Hybrisol I (Intergen Company, Purchase, NY), hybridized using 32P-labeled cDNA in the same buffer at 42 °C, and subjected to autoradiography. The 0.5-kb DAF (NM_000574) probe was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR using primers 5′-TTCAGGCAGCTCTGTCCAGT-3′ (sense, 683-702) and 5′-TAAGTCAGCAAGCCCATGGT-3′ (antisense, 1191-1210). The 0.4-kb actin (BC004251) probe was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR using primers 5′-TGGCACCACACCTTCTACAA-3′ (sense, 317-336) and 5′-CATCTCTTGCTCGAAGTCCA-3′ (antisense, 723-742).Western Blotting—Cells were washed with PBS and lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors from Roche Diagnostics). Protein concentrations were measured using Bio-Rad reagent (Bio-Rad). Proteins were then separated on precast SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% milk in TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were then treated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and developed using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences).Promoter Constructs, Transient Transfection, and Luciferase Assay—Various lengths of the human DAF promoter (40Thomas D.J. Lublin D.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 151-160PubMed Google Scholar) spanning -724 to +80 bp with respect to the transcription initiation site were amplified using human genomic DNA (Promega, Madison, WI). For cloning purposes, the primer pairs containing BglII (forward) and HindIII (reverse) restriction sites at the 5′ site were amplified by PCR, digested with BglII/HindIII enzymes, and cloned into pGL3-Basic firefly luciferase reporter vector (Promega). Substitution mutations at the cAMP response element (CRE) binding site were generated by PCR using (forward) 5′-TTTGTCCCACCCTTGGTGATTCAGAGCCCCAGCCCAGAC-3′ and (reverse) 5′-GTCTGGGCTGGGGCTCTGAATCACCAAGGGTGGGACAAA-3′ oligonucleotides. Following amplification of the -383/+80 promoter construct using Pfu turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene), the PCR product was digested with DpnI enzyme and transformed into DH5α-competent cells. Small cultures from individual colonies were used for Miniprep DNA preparation (Qiagen). Each construct was sequence-verified before further evaluation. For luciferase assays, 1.3 × 105 LS174T cells were cultured in a 12-well plate 24 h before transfection. The transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) in serum-free media containing 100 ng of reporter plasmid and 5 ng of Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid pRLSV40 as an internal control following the manufacturer's protocol. This transfection mixture was added to cells, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Prostaglandins and the other experimental reagents were added after 24 h and incubated for a further 24 h. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using a dual luciferase assay kit (Promega) and a luminometer. Firefly luciferase values were normalized to Renilla values.Immunohistochemistry—Six-week-old male ApcMin+/- mice were given 300 μg/kg PGE2 or sterile PBS vehicle control per os twice a day for 7 weeks. Pilot experiments consistently demonstrated that 300 μg/kg PGE2 achieved 2-3-fold higher levels of circulating and intestinal-derived PGE2 when compared with vehicle-treated control mice (data not shown). After 7 weeks, the mice were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation, and the entire intestine was dissected, washed in PBS, and immediately fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin overnight at room temperature for paraffin embedding. Sections (5 μm) were dewaxed with xylene and rehydrated; the epitopes were revealed by microwave. Once endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched, nonspecific immunoglobulins were blocked with normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit anti-human DAF primary antibody (1:50 dilution), which cross-reacts with mouse DAF protein. Negative controls received no primary antibody. The Vectastain ABC peroxidase system (Vector Laboratories) was used for immunodetection following the manufacturer's instructions, and immunolocalization was visualized with the peroxidase substrate 3,3-diaminobenzidine. Samples were counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted. All results were verified by a blind independent second observer.Human Colorectal Tissue Samples—Human colorectal tumor specimens were obtained from surgical resections with Vanderbilt University internal review board approval. For each tumor sample, matched adjacent normal mucosa was collected for comparison. All samples were snap frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen until use. RNA preparation from tissues was performed using TRI reagent as described above.RESULTSPGE2Induces DAF mRNA and Protein in LS174T Cells—To evaluate the temporal profile of PGE2-mediated DAF expression, we conducted a time course following PGE2 treatment (1 μm). Northern blot analysis revealed that PGE2 rapidly induces DAF expression, beginning at 1.5 h (5-fold) and reaching a maximum by 4 h (20-fold) (Fig. 1A). PGE2 treatment increased DAF protein levels by 4 h (2-fold), and DAF expression remained elevated for 24 h (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, adding PGE2 induced DAF expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1C). mRNA levels were maximal at 2 μm (8-fold), whereas protein levels peaked at 10 μm (11-fold) PGE2 (Fig. 1D).PGE2 also increased human DAF promoter activity in LS174T cells. Based on the identified transcription initiation start site (41Andoh A. Kinoshita K. Rosenberg I. Podolsky D.K. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3887-3893Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), a series of 5′ DAF promoter deletion constructs were generated to evaluate the promoter activity of DAF in response to PGE2 treatment using reporter assays. The activity of these promoter constructs, which was assessed by their ability to drive luciferase expression, is shown in Fig. 2A. Transfection of the DAF -383/+80 construct resulted in maximal (∼15-fold) PGE2-mediated luciferase activity compared with the other constructs. Significantly, deletion of the CRE dramatically reduced luciferase activity, suggesting that PGE2-dependent DAF induction is mediated by cAMP. This was further verified by substitution mutation of the CRE element from TGACACAG to TGATTCAG in the -383/+80 construct. This two-base mutation in the CRE decreased PGE2 induction of DAF by 90% relative to the wild-type construct (Fig. 2B). PGE2 also induced DAF promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner with maximal activity at a concentration of 0.5 μm (Fig. 2C).Fig. 2PGE2 mediates an increase in DAF promoter activity in LS174T cells.A, construction of the following five deletion mutants of the DAF promoter: -805/+80, -660/+80, -516/+80, -383/+80, and -205/+80. LS174T cells were cultured in 12-well plates and transiently cotransfected with a series of DAF promoter-luciferase reporter constructs and internal standard controls. Transfected cells were treated with PGE2 (1 μm) for 24 h prior to measurement of firefly luciferase activity normalized to Renilla luciferase activity, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, CRE mutation in the DAF promoter. LS174T cells were transfected with a 2-base mutation of the CRE-like site in the DAF promoter construct (-383/+80) and treated with PGE2 (1 μm) for 24 h. Luciferase activity was measured as described above, and the experiments were repeated three times. C, LS174T cells were transfected with a -383/+80 construct and treated with increasing concentrations of PGE2. Luciferase activity was measured as described above, and the experiments were repeated three times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)PGE2Stimulates DAF in LS174T Cells in a cAMP/Protein Kinase A-dependent Mechanism—Four G-protein-coupled receptors are known to mediate PGE2 signal transduction via distinct second-messenger pathways. To elucidate the specific mechanism by which PGE2 induces DAF expression, we utilized a compound known to elevate intracellular cAMP levels. Incubation with 1 μg/ml cholera toxin, which activates adenylate cyclase and increases cAMP levels, significantly induced DAF expression (25-fold) (Fig. 3A). Induction of DAF by PGE2 via cAMP signaling was further evaluated using H-89, a selective inhibitor of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A. H-89 blocked the induction of DAF by PGE2 (Fig. 3). These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that PGE2 induces DAF expression in a cAMP/protein kinase A-dependent manner.Fig. 3PGE2 stimulates DAF in LS174T cells in a cAMP/protein kinase A-dependent mechanism. LS174T cells were cultured in serum-free media for 48 h prior to treatment with various reagents. Inhibitors (10 μm each H-89 and LY294002 (Ly)) were added 1 h before PGE2 stimulation. The levels of DAF mRNA were determined by Northern blot analysis (A). Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized with DAF antibody (B). LS174T cells were transfected with a -383/+80 construct and treated with and without protein kinase A inhibitor (H-89) prior to the addition of PGE2 (1 μm). Luciferase activity was measured as described above. The experiments were repeated three times, and representative results are shown (C). CTL, control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We further evaluated PGE2 stimulation of DAF by other signaling pathways known to affect cAMP levels. We have shown previously that PGE2 has a positive effect on the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (AKT) pathways (42Buchanan F.G. Wang D. Bargiacchi F. DuBois R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35451-35457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Others have demonstrated that activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway reduces cAMP levels through increasing the activity of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 3B (43Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Kuroda S. Hino Y. Ando M. Kotani K. Konishi H. Matsuzaki H. Kikkawa U. Ogawa W. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6286-6296Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Consistent with a model in which inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/phosphodiesterase 3B pathway increases cAMP levels (44Harndahl L. Jing X.J. Ivarsson R. Degerman E. Ahren B. Manganiello V.C. Renstrom E. Holst L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37446-37455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), pretreatment with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 prior to adding PGE2 induced a robust increase in DAF expression (40-fold) in LS174T cells (Fig. 3A).PGD2and PGJ2Also Stimulate DAF Expression—The effect of PGE2 prompted us to assess the effect of other prostaglandins on the regulation of DAF expression. We treated LS174T cells with a variety of prostaglandins (1 μm) and measured DAF expression. Although PGA2, PGF2α, and thromboxane B2 had no effect, PGD2 (38-fold) and its metabolic product, PGJ2 (43-fold), stimulated DAF mRNA expression in a similar concentration as that of PGE2 (24-fold) (Fig. 4A). Protein levels of DAF also increased with PGD2 (1.8-fold) and PGJ2 (2.2-fold) (Fig. 4B). These data complement the profile of LS174T prostanoid receptor expression, which consists of receptors for PGE2 (EP2 and -4) and PGD2 (D prostanoid) (data not shown). The Northern and Western blot results were further corroborated with DAF promoter studies (Fig. 4C)Fig. 4A variety of prostaglandins stimulate DAF expression. LS174T cells were cultured in serum-free media for 48 h prior to treatment with various prostaglandins (1 μm). Cells were harvested after 4 h. Total RNA was isolated, and equal amounts of RNA were loaded. DAF mRNA levels were determined by Northern blot analysis (A). Following the isolation of total cellular protein, equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized with DAF antibody (B). LS174T cells were transfected with a -383/+80 construct and treated with different prostaglandins (1 μm). Luciferase activity was measured after 24 h as described above.

This panel of cell lines was selected because of their differential production of PGE2 downstream from the two cyclooxygenase isoenzymes, COX-1 and COX-2. HCA-7 cells express high levels of COX-2 and endogenous PGE2 (4 ng/105 cells) (45Shao J. Sheng H. Inoue H. Morrow J.D. DuBois R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33951-33956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), and concomitantly high levels of DAF are found in these cells as well (Fig. 5A). Consistent with this model, treatment with exogenous PGE2 (1 μm) did not further induce DAF mRNA levels (Fig. 5A). On the other hand, OVCAR-3 cells express high levels of COX-1, leading to a moderate amount of PGE2 production (0.25 ng/105 cells) (46Gupta R.A. Tejada L.V. Tong B.J. Das S.K. Morrow J.D. Dey S.K. DuBois R.N. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 906-911PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, adding exogenous PGE2 induced DAF expression over basal levels (2-fold). Finally, HCT-15 cells do not express either COX-1 or COX-2, producing low prostaglandins levels (47Hanif R. Pittas A. Feng Y. Koutsos M.I. Qiao L. Staiano-Coico L. Shiff S.I. Rigas B. Biochem.

The first region (α-1 repeat) includes parts of transmembrane segments (TMSs) 2 and 3 and a linker modeled to be a reentrant loop. To determine the involvement of the reentrant loop and TMS 3 portions of the α-1 repeat in exchanger function, we generated a series of mutants and examined ion binding and transport and regulatory properties. Mutations in the reentrant loop did not substantially modify transport properties of the exchanger though the Hill coefficient for Na+ and the rate of Na+-dependent inactivation were decreased. Mutations in TMS 3 had more striking effects on exchanger activity. Of mutations at 10 positions, 3 behaved like the wild-type exchanger (V137C, A141C, M144C). Mutants at two other positions expressed no activity (Ser139) or very low activity (Gly138). Six different mutations were made at position 143; only N143D was active, and it displayed wild-type characteristics. The highly specific requirement for an asparagine or aspartate residue at this position may indicate a key role for Asn143 in the transport mechanism. Mutations at residues Ala140 and Ile147 decreased affinity for intracellular Na+, whereas mutations at Phe145 increased Na+ affinity. The cooperativity of Na+ binding was also altered. In no case was Ca2+ affinity changed. TMS 3 may form part of a site that binds Na+ but not Ca2+.

We conclude that TMS 3 is involved in Na+ binding and transport, but previously proposed roles for the reentrant loop need to be reevaluated. Na+-Ca2+ exchangers are found in a wide variety of tissues. These plasma membrane proteins are electrogenic transporters that utilize the electrochemical gradient of Na+ to exchange three extracellular Na+ ions for one intracellular Ca2+. As a Ca2+ efflux mechanism, the exchanger helps maintain intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Cloning of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (1Nicoll D.A. Longoni S. Philipson K.D.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Much progress has been made in understanding exchanger topology, function, and regulation. Modulation by intracellular factors such as Na+ and Ca2+ ions, ATP, and PIP2, have been extensively studied, and the domains involved in regulation have been localized to the large cytoplasmic loop (6Philipson K.D. Nicoll D.A. Ann. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Less is known about the regions of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger involved in the translocation of Na+ and Ca2+. Two regions with similar sequences, called the α-1 and α-2 repeats, likely have key roles. The α-1 repeat consists of residues spanning TMSs 2 and 3 and an extracellular loop connecting the two TMSs. The homologous α-2 repeat encompasses TMS 7 and part of the following intracellular loop (Fig. 1). Several observations emphasize the functional importance of the α repeats. First, they are highly conserved among all Na+-Ca2+ exchangers and are the only regions of sequence conservation between members of the NCX and NCKX families (7Schwarz E.M. Benzer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10249-10254Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Second, data suggest that the portions of the α repeats connecting TMS 2–3 and TMS 7–8 form reentrant membrane loops (Fig. 1 and Ref. 2Nicoll D.A. Ottolia M. Lu L. Lu Y. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 910-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Reentrant loops have been identified in ion channels (“P-Loops”), and in the aquaporin family of proteins and form a portion of the hydrophilic pathway for ions or other molecules to cross the membrane (8Hille B.

Mutations were made in the first reentrant loop and in TMS 3. We show that mutations within the reentrant loop do not cause major perturbations in ion translocation; all mutations lead to active exchangers with little alteration in ion affinities or regulatory properties. These data seem to exclude the reentrant loop of the α-1 repeat as a key component of ion translocation. In contrast, residues within TMS 3 are important in determining Na+ affinity. Mutations of residues Ala140, Phe145, and Ile147 drastically alter the apparent affinity for Na+, without affecting the binding of transported Ca2+. Thus, TMS 3 is important in determining the ion dependence of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger. Molecular Biology and 45Ca2+Uptake Measurements—Mutations were generated in 200–400-bp cassettes from the full-length exchanger using QuikChange Mutagenesis (Stratagene). Cassettes were then sequenced and subcloned back into the full-length exchanger. RNA was synthesized using T3 mMessage mMachine (Ambion) after linearization with HindIII. RNA was injected into Xenopus oocytes and 45Ca2+ uptake measured as described previously (13Doering A.E. Nicoll D.A. Lu Y. Lu L. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 778-783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To measure extracellular Ca2+ dependence, mutants were transiently expressed in BHK or HEK cells, and 45Ca2+ uptake was measured at different [Ca2+]. Data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation using GraphPad Prism version 4.0 for Macintosh. The dog/squid NCX chimera was generated by a combination of mutagenesis and subcloning. The squid exchanger has a BamHI site at the Gly108 position and an XcmI site at the Ile136 position. The dog exchanger also has an equivalent XcmI site. A BamHI site was introduced at the equivalent site in the dog NCX1 by mutagenesis. The mutant dog exchanger was then digested with BamHI and XcmI, and the 80-base pair BamHI-XcmI fragment from the squid exchanger was placed into the dog exchanger. This resulted in a chimeric exchanger containing the dog background with the squid reentrant loop between TMSs 2 and 3. Electrophysiological Experiments—Outward Na+-Ca2+ exchange currents were recorded using the inside-out giant patch technique (14Hilgemann D.W. Lu C.C. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 267-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Borosilicate glass pipettes were pulled and fire-polished to a final inner diameter of about 20–30 μm and coated with a mixture of parafilm and mineral oil. Prior to experiments, the vitelline membrane of the oocyte was removed manually in an isotonic solution identical to the solution for seal formation (mm: 110 KOH, 10 HEPES, 2 CaCl2, adjusted to pH 7 using MES). After membrane excision, solutions were rapidly changed using a computer controlled 20-channel solution switcher. Recordings of the outward exchanger current were obtained using the following solutions: pipette solution (mm): 100 NMG (N-methylglucamine), 10 HEPES (4-(2hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid), 20 TEAOH (tetraethylammonium hydroxide), 0.2 niflumic acid, 0.2 ouabain, 8 Ca(OH)2, pH 7 (using MES); bath solution (mm): 100 CsOH or 100 NaOH, 20 TEAOH, 10 HEPES, 10 EGTA, 20 CsOH, 0–5.75 Ca(OH)2 (0 or 1 μm free Ca2+), pH 7 (using MES). Exchanger inward currents were measured using the following solutions: pipette solution (mm): 100 NaOH, 10 HEPES, 20 TEAOH, 0.2 niflumic acid, 0.2 ouabain, 10 EGTA, 2 Mg(OH)2, pH 7 (using MES); bath solution (mm): 100 CsOH, 20 TEAOH, 10 HEPES, 10 EGTA, 0–10 Ca(OH)2, pH 7 (using MES). Free calcium concentrations were calculated according to the MAXc program. Na+ and Ca2+ activation curves were obtained by perfusing solutions with different ion concentrations. Currents were fitted to a Hill function and normalized to extrapolated maximum values. Values are mean ± S.E. Values were considered significantly different at a level of p < 0.05. pCLAMP (Axon Instruments, Burlingame, CA) software was used for acquisition and analysis. Data were acquired on-line at 4 ms/point and filtered at 50 Hz using an 8-pole Bessel filter. Experiments were performed at 35 °C and at a holding potential of 0 mV. Electrophysiological Characterization of Reentrant Loop Mutants—We generated point mutants H124N, N125C, F126C, T127H, and D130C of the first reentrant loop of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger and investigated biophysical properties. Mutants were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and analyzed by both 45Ca2+ uptake assays and by electrophysiology using the giant excised patch technique. In a typical excised patch experiment, Ca2+ is within the patch pipette at the extracellular surface. An outward Na+-Ca2+ exchange current is activated by the rapid application of Na+ to the intracellular surface. In this configuration, the excised patch technique allows assessment of two different regulatory properties (15Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1990; 344: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). First, although Na+ provides substrate to activate transport, Na+ at the intracellular surface also induces a slow inactivation process known as I1 (e.g. see Fig. 4 and Ref. 16Hilgemann D.W. Matsuoka S. Nagel G.A. Collins A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 905-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Second, intracellular Ca2+ binds to a regulatory site on the large intracellular loop to activate transport function (17Hilgemann D.W. Collins A. Matsuoka S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 933-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 18Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. Hryshko L.V. Levitsky D.O. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 403-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). To measure apparent ion affinities at transport sites without confounding effects of these regulatory processes, the exchanger can be first “deregulated” by treatment with chymotrypsin at the intracellular surface. We first determined apparent affinities for Na+, measured at the cytoplasmic surface of deregulated mutants. Our data (see Figs. 2, left panels, and 8) show that the concentration of Na+ needed to activate 50% of the mutated exchangers slightly decreased in H124N and D130C and increased for mutant F126C. Replacement of Asn125 did not produce any apparent effect. Exchangers H124N, F126C, T127H, and D130C also showed a significant decrease in the Hill coefficient with the effects being most substantial for H124N and F126C (Fig. 8). The shallower course of the Na+ dependence for H124N and F126C allows these mutants to transport more efficiently at lower Na+ concentration than the wild type. For example, Fig. 2 shows that at 5 mm intracellular Na+, H124N and wild-type exchangers had about 23 and 6% of maximal activities, respectively. To determine the affinity of the mutated exchangers for transported Ca2+, inward exchange currents were generated by application of different cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations with 100 mm extracellular Na+ within the pipette. We found no changes in the apparent Ca2+ affinity values for any reentrant loop mutant. However, F126C showed a shallower course of the Ca2+ dependence curve (Figs. 2 and 8). Positions His124, Asn125, and Asp130 are of particular interest since a previous study showed that replacement of each of these residues with a cysteine decreased the apparent affinity of the external binding site for transported Ca2+ (4Iwamoto T. Uehara A. Imanaga I. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38571-38580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In our hands, however, neither the N125C nor the D130C exchangers had altered apparent affinities for external Ca2+. The activities of N125C, D130C, and wild-type exchangers were measured at different extracellular Ca2+ concentrations as Na+ gradient-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake into intact cells. N125C and D130C behaved similarly to wild type (Fig. 3). This is consistent with the electrophysiological measurements on the apparent affinities for intracellular Ca2+. We also examined the Na+-dependent inactivation, I1, of the mutated exchangers (Fig. 4). Mutations H124N and D130C substantially slowed the time constant (τ) of Na+-dependent inactivation. Current decays were fitted to a single exponential to calculate time constants of 8.8 ± 0.7 (n = 8) for H124N, 5.5 ± 1.1s(n = 6) for D130C and 3.3 ± 0.2s(n = 23) for the wild-type exchanger. Preliminary experiments also indicate that the mutant exchanger F126C had slowed inactivation (∼5 s, n = 2), while mutations at position 125 (n = 2) and 127 (n = 2) caused no change in the inactivation rate. We have previously reported on the inactivation of mutant H124N (3Nicoll D.A. Ottolia M. Philipson K.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 976: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Overall, our results indicate that residues forming the putative reentrant loop connecting TMSs 2 and 3 do not set cytoplasmic affinities for transported ions but can alter the cooperativity of Na+ binding and inactivation rates. Functional Activity of the Squid Chimera Exchanger—As shown in Fig. 1, the portion of the α-1 repeat that invaginates the membrane is highly conserved in the three mammalian Na+-Ca2+ exchangers (NCX1, NCX2, and NCX3) but diverges in non-mammalian species such as the squid neuronal exchanger (NCX-SQ1). NCX-SQ1 has the following non-conservative changes: C122V, H124Q, N125K, T127E, and D130Q. Interestingly, NCX-SQ1 has biophysical properties similar to the mammalian NCX1 (19He Z. Tong Q. Quednau B.D. Philipson K.D. Hilgemann D.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 857-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). If the reentrant loop is involved in ion transport, then perhaps other parts of the NCX-SQ1 protein compensate for the amino acid divergence within the reentrant loop. To explore this possibility, we replaced the α-1 reentrant loop of the mammalian Na+-Ca2+ exchanger with that from NCX-SQ1 (squid chimera). Previously we have shown that the outward current from the squid chimeric exchanger possesses both Na+- and Ca2+-dependent inactivation processes (3Nicoll D.A. Ottolia M. Philipson K.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 976: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We now performed kinetic analysis of the I1 regulatory properties of the squid chimera. At a cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration of 1 μm, the time constant for inactivation of squid chimera exchangers was modestly increased as compared with the wild-type cardiac Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (4.1 ± 0.2 s, n = 3 versus 3.3 ± 0.2 s, n = 23; Fig. 4). The affinities of the squid chimera exchanger for transported ions (measured at the cytoplasmic surface) were determined after the removal of the Na+- and Ca2+-dependent inactivation processes (I1 and I2) using chymotrypsin. As shown in Figs. 5A and 8, the squid chimera exchanger displayed a slight but significant increase in Na+ affinity and a decrease in cooperativity (see left bottom panel of Fig. 5). The fit of the Na+ dependence curves to a Hill function yielded apparent affinities values of 16.6 ± 1.2 mm (n = 6) for the wild type and 13.4 ± 0.7 mm (n = 6) for the squid chimera with corresponding Hill coefficients of 1.9 ± 0.1 and 1.3 ± 0.1. The Ca2+ dependence for the transport site on the cytoplasmic surface was also investigated and no significant differences were found between the canine cardiac Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (wild type) and the exchanger containing residues 122 to 130 of the squid isoform. Panel B of Fig. 5 shows examples of inward currents and the corresponding Ca2+ concentration response curve (see Fig. 8 for values). The results indicate that replacement of the extracellular portion of the α-1 repeat does not cause major perturbations of Na+ or Ca2+ transport. There were minor effects on the apparent Na+ affinity and more substantial effects on the cooperativity of Na+ binding. Biophysical Properties of Cardiac Na+-Ca2+Exchangers Mutated within TMS 3—We made point mutations at residues 137–145 and 147. Effects of some mutations at three of the residues (Gly138, Ser139, and Asn143) have been reported previously (11Nicoll D.A. Hryshko L.V. Matsuoka S. Frank J.S. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13385-13391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Conservative mutations of Gly138 to an alanine, serine, or cysteine have resulted in low activity and were not reexamined here. Mutants S139A and N143V are inactive (11Nicoll D.A. Hryshko L.V. Matsuoka S. Frank J.S. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13385-13391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and we examined the effects of additional mutations at position Asn143. Replacement of Asn143 with a cysteine, alanine, glutamate, or serine also all produced inactive exchangers. Surprisingly, however, the mutant N143D produced an exchanger with normal Na+ affinity and activity level (Fig. 6). The N143D exchanger also displayed normal regulatory properties. Both Na+- and Ca2+-dependent inactivations are demonstrated in Fig. 6C. Na+-dependent inactivation is removed by high intracellular Ca2+, and activity disappears upon the removal of regulatory Ca2+ as also occurs with the wild-type exchanger. Of the remaining residues mutated, three (V137C, A141C, and M144C) displayed robust Na+-Ca2+ exchange currents and had biophysical properties similar to wild type (Figs. 6A and 8). Mutations at positions Ala140, Phe145, and Ile147, however, displayed interesting characteristics. Mutation of residues Ala140, Phe145, and Ile147 in the α-1 region of TMS 3 caused substantial alterations in the apparent affinity for intracellular Na+. As shown in Fig. 7A, mutation of alanine at position 140 or isoleucine at position 147 decreased the Na+ affinity of the exchanger. In contrast, mutant exchanger F145C had an increased Na+ affinity. The apparent Na+ affinities were: 37.1 ± 2.6 mm (n = 5) for A140C, 9.9 ± 0.9 mm (n = 6) for F145C and 88.5 ± 2.3 mm (n = 4) for I147S. The value for the wild-type exchanger was 16.6 ± 1.2 mm (n = 6). The extent of the decrease in the Na+ affinity caused by the replacement of alanine 140 correlated with the size of the residue inserted (Figs. 7B and 8). The smallest residue, glycine, yielded the highest affinity for Na+ (13.7 mm) and the largest, asparagine, yielded the lowest affinity (60.2 mm). Replacement of phenylalanine 145 produced two effects: an increase in the apparent Na+ affinity and a decrease in the Hill coefficient for both Na+ and Ca2+. The increase in Na+ affinity was prominent in mutants F145C and F145L and did not correlate with either hydrophobicity or size of the introduced residue (see Figs. 7C and 8). The shift in the shape of the Na+ dependence curve was prominent in mutants F145C and F145S and may correlate with either hydrophobicity or size. Serine and cysteine are of comparable size and are smaller than leucine or phenylalanine and are also both less hydrophobic than leucine or phenylalanine. Thus, the slope of the Na+ dependence may be set by either the size or the hydrophobicity of the amino acid at position 145. A mutation at a nearby position, F142C, also had a decreased Hill coefficient for Na+ activation though, in this case, apparent Na+ affinity was unchanged (Fig. 8). We also investigated the response of mutant exchangers A140C, F145C, and I147S to cytoplasmic Ca2+ (Fig. 7D). We observed no significant shift in the apparent affinities for Ca2+. However, mutation of phenylalanine 145 to cysteine modestly reduced the Hill coefficient for the binding of cytoplasmic Ca2+; Hill coefficients were 1.3 ± 0.1 and 1.1 ± 0.1 (n = 5) for wild-type and F145C exchangers, respectively. Since the cloning of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger in 1990 (1Nicoll D.A. Longoni S. Philipson K.D. Science. 1990; 250: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), there has been much progress in understanding exchanger structure and function. Important regulatory regions have been identified (18Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. Hryshko L.V. Levitsky D.O. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 403-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 20Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. Reilly R.F. Hilgemann D.W. Philipson K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3870-3874Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and a new topology has been proposed (2Nicoll D.A. Ottolia M. Lu L. Lu Y. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 910-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 3Nicoll D.A. Ottolia M. Philipson K.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 976: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 5Iwamoto T. Nakamura T.Y. Pan Y. Uehara A. Imanaga I. Shigekawa M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The latest studies indicate a protein comprised of nine transmembrane segments with the initial five TMSs separated from the last four TMSs by a large cytoplasmic loop. The hydrophilic linkers connecting TMSs 2 and 3 and TMSs 7 and 8 have been proposed to form reentrant loops as some residues are accessible to sulfhydryl reagents applied to either surface of the membrane (2Nicoll D.A. Ottolia M. Lu L. Lu Y. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 910-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 5Iwamoto T. Nakamura T.Y. Pan Y. Uehara A. Imanaga I. Shigekawa M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These reentrant loops are on opposite sides of the membrane (Fig. 1) and are in proximity to one another (10Qiu Z. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 194-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These two linkers are parts of the α repeats, homologous sequences within the exchanger of about 40 amino acids each, including parts of TMSs 2 and 3 (α-1 repeat) and a portion of TMS 7 (α-2 repeat). Reentrant membrane loops (P-loops) were first described in ion channels where they form a portion of the channel pore. By analogy, the reentrant loops found in the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger family may be important for ion transport. In support of this, a previous report described four point mutations within the hydrophilic portion of the α-1 reentrant loop (H124C, N125C, G129C, and D130C) that caused up to a 4-fold reduction in the apparent affinity for external Ca2+ (5Iwamoto T. Nakamura T.Y. Pan Y. Uehara A. Imanaga I. Shigekawa M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In this study, we further investigated the role of the first reentrant loop in ion translocation and extended our studies to residues forming the first portion of TMS 3. Our data demonstrate that amino acids encompassing the extracellular linker between TMSs 2 and 3 are replaceable and that substitutions do not obstruct the transport of ions. Mutant exchangers H124N, F126C, and D130C and the squid chimera exchanger (containing the changes C122V, H124Q, N125K, T127E, and D130Q) showed modest change in intracellular Na+ affinity, though intracellular Ca2+ affinities were unchanged. These data tend to rule out the first reentrant loop as a key component of the ion binding and translocation pathway. This contrasts with ion channel P loops that form the ion selectivity filter within the pore pathway. Consistent with our results is the relatively poor conservation of residues within the reentrant loop. One would expect a critically important reentrant loop to demonstrate the high degree of conservation seen in the adjoining TMSs 2 and 3 (Fig. 1). The lack of effect of the nonconservative changes in the squid chimera (e.g. H124Q, N125K, and D130Q) argues against a key role for the reentrant loop. The most prominent effect of reentrant loop mutations was on the cooperativity of Na+ dependence. With the exception of the N125C, all mutations within the reentrant loop decreased the Hill coefficient of the Na+ dependence, indicating a change in cooperativity. Indeed, the Hill coefficient decreased from the wild-type value of 2 to a value much closer to 1 for the H124N, F126C, and squid chimera exchangers. The data suggest that these residues are involved in the interactions between Na+ binding sites. We found that reentrant loop mutations had little effect on either the cytoplasmic or extracellular Ca2+ dependencies. This is surprising since others have reported that mutations at position 124, 125, and 130 in the reentrant loop decreased the affinity for external Ca2+ (5Iwamoto T. Nakamura T.Y. Pan Y. Uehara A. Imanaga I. Shigekawa M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We do not have an explanation for this apparent discrepancy. Cytoplasmic Na+ is transported by the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger but also regulates exchange activity. High concentrations of internal Na+ force the exchanger into a nonconductive state (Na+-dependent inactivation) (16Hilgemann D.W. Matsuoka S. Nagel G.A. Collins A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 905-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms that lead to the Na+-dependent inactivation are not known. However, it appears that Na+ bound to the internal transport sites triggers the process (16Hilgemann D.W. Matsuoka S. Nagel G.A. Collins A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 905-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Interestingly, two mutants within the first reentrant loop of the exchanger (H124N and D130C) show a slower decay of exchange current in the presence of 100 mm cytoplasmic Na+. The data suggest that residues located within the first reentrant loop contribute to regulation and their replacement slows down conformational changes involved in the Na+-dependent inactivation process. This behavior is reminiscent of C-type inactivation found in some voltage-gated ion channels (21Hoshi T. Zagotta W.N. Aldrich R.W. Science. 1990; 250: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar, 22Hoshi T. Zagotta W.N. Aldrich R.W. Neuron. 1991; 7: 547-556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). C-type inactivation involves a slow movement of the protein, leading to closure of the outer pore over several seconds. Mutations within the outer pore of the channel alter inactivation (23Basso C. Labarca P. Stefani E. Alvarez O. Latorre R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 24Liu Y. Jurman M.E. Yellen G. Neuron. 1996; 16: 859-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 25Loots E. Isacoff E.Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). By analogy, cytoplasmic Na+ may trigger a slow conformational change of the reentrant-loop region of the exchanger and modifications of this region slow down decay of transport function. The functional importance of TMS 2 and the linker between TMS 2 and 3 has been extensively investigated through mutagenesis studies (2Nicoll D.A. Ottolia M. Lu L. Lu Y. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 910-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 4Iwamoto T. Uehara A. Imanaga I. Shigekawa M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 778-783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) with results emphasizing the critical role of TMS 2 in ion translocation. In contrast, TMS 3 has received relatively little attention. Nicoll et al. (11Nicoll D.A. Hryshko L.V. Matsuoka S. Frank J.S. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13385-13391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) showed that exchange activity is highly sensitive to mutation of Gly138, Ser139, or Asn143 within TMS 3. Also, recent data place this portion of the exchanger in contact with TMSs 2, 7, and 8 to form a three-dimensional structure that may define a pathway for ion movement (10Qiu Z. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 194-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These data and the high conservation of this region suggest an involvement in the movement of ions. To examine whether TMS 3 plays a role in ion selectivity and transport, we investigated the effects of mutations within TMS 3. We mutated each of the residues belonging to the α repeat portion of TMS 3 and measured the effects of these mutations on Na+ and Ca2+ translocation. Several mutations produced prominent effects. First, as reported previously (11Nicoll D.A. Hryshko L.V. Matsuoka S. Frank J.S. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13385-13391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), mutants G138A and G138S have low activity and S139A has no activity. Of the active mutant exchangers, replacement of alanine 140, phenylalanine 145, and isoleucine 147 produced the most prominent changes in the biophysical properties of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger. Mutations at these sites altered the apparent affinity of the exchanger for Na+, with the most prominent effect at position 147. The effects of mutations at position 140 may be sensitive to the size of the replacement residue. Substitution with a large amino acid (asparagine) produced the largest decrease in the Na+ dependence, while insertion of a small residue (glycine) did not modify transport. There is no simple pattern to explain the effects of mutations at position 145. Since Ca2+ and Na+ are thought to bind at the same sites, mutations that alter Na+ dependence might also be expected to modify the apparent affinity for transported Ca2+. However, the apparent affinity for Ca2+ of mutant exchangers A140C, F145C, and I147S was not significantly different from that measured for the wild type exchanger. It has previously been proposed (26Reeves J.P. Sutko J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3178-3182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Kang T.M. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 2004; 427: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) that the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger has two classes of cation binding sites. One class of sites binds either Ca2+ or two Na+ and the second class binds one Na+. Residues 140, 145, and 147 may be involved in the second class of sites, and thus mutations affect Na+, but not Ca2+, affinity. There is little previous information on the location of Na+ binding sites within the exchanger. The only TMS mutation previously reported to alter Na+ affinity is T103V, near the intracellular surface of TMS2 (13Doering A.E. Nicoll D.A. Lu Y. Lu L. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 778-783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In this case, the cooperativity of Na+ transport was also reduced. Particular attention must be given to the asparagine at position 143 in TMS 3. Replacement of this residue with an alanine, cysteine, serine, valine, or glutamate residue totally abolished exchange activity. However, replacement of Asn143 with an aspartate residue produced an exchanger indistinguishable from wild type. It is quite striking that introduction of an aspartate leaves properties unaltered while introduction of any of five other residues abolishes activity. The sensitivity of this position to mutations may indicate the direct involvement of this residue in ion transport and also indicates a strict requirement for specific amino acids (asparagine or aspartate) at this site. Aspartate, asparagine, and valine are all of similar size but only aspartate and asparagine are hydrophilic. Thus, not only size but also degree of hydrophilicity at this position is essential in maintaining exchanger activity. It may seem surprising that introduction of a negatively charged aspartate residue into the center of a transmembrane segment does not disrupt transport function. However, in a hydrophobic environment this aspartate may remain in an undissociated and uncharged state. The three Na+-Ca2+ exchanger mutations in TMS 3 that do not perturb wild type properties (A141C, M144C, and V137A) can all be modeled to be on the same face of a transmembrane α-helix. All the remaining mutations that alter exchanger function are excluded from this face. These sites may face TMSs 2, 7, and 8 that have been modeled to interact with TMS 3 and form an ion translocation pathway (10Qiu Z. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 194-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Taken together, our data indicate that residues forming the first reentrant membrane loop of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger do not have a key role in ion transport but could be involved in movements associated with Na+-dependent inactivation and in cooperativity between Na+ binding sites. In contrast, at least six amino acid residues within the extracellular half of TMS 3 are important components of exchanger function and some may be involved in the binding of Na+. The Na+ binding site associated with TMS 3 may be a unique site that does not participate in Ca2+ binding. The data confirm the importance of TMS 3 and the α-1 repeat in exchanger function.

Given that ectopic expression of the human telomerase catalytic subunit hTERT leads to cellular immortalization, the endogenous hTERT gene is likely constitutively repressed. Hence, we have examined the chromatin structure of the native hTERT locus and the neighboring loci, CRR9 and Xtrp2, in normal human fibroblasts and a set of immortal lines. Using generalized DNase I sensitivity assays, we revealed that the entire hTERT gene was embedded in a chromatin domain that was as resistant to the nuclease as the well studied β-globin loci in both telomerase-positive and -negative cells. This condensed domain was at least 100 kb in size and contained the intergenic region 5′ to the hTERT gene and the downstream Xtrp2 locus. A transition from the nuclease-sensitive CRR9 locus to the condensed region appeared near the 3′-end of the CRR9 gene. hTERT transcription was associated with the appearance of a major DNase I-hypersensitive site positioned around the hTERT transcription start site and several minor hypersensitive sites. In telomerase-negative cells, the inhibition of histone deacetylases by trichostatin A led to the opening of this chromatin domain, accompanied by transcription from the hTERT gene but not the Xtrp2 gene. In contrast, the inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide induced transcription from both the hTERT and Xtrp2 genes, indicating that histone deacetylases and labile factors coordinate to silence this chromosomal region. Taken together, our data suggest a novel mechanism of hTERT regulation at the chromatin level and have important implications for studying telomerase expression.

Maintaining the integrity of telomeres is essential for long term cellular proliferation and survival (1Morin G.B. Cell. 1989; 59: 521-529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar). Telomeres are specialized nucleoprotein complexes containing TTAGGG repeats and serve as protective caps of linear chromosomal ends. Telomeres shorten as cells proliferate and are replenished by telomerase, which consists of a catalytic protein subunit, TERT, 1The abbreviations used are: TERT, telomerase reverse transcriptase; hTERT, human TERT; ALT, alternative lengthening of telomere; CRR9, cisplatin-resistance related gene; HS1, DNase I-hypersensitive site; TRAP, telomeric repeat amplification protocol; TSA, trichostatin A; RT, reverse transcription; Xtrp2, a gene encoding an orphan transporter protein. and an RNA template subunit, TER (2Greider C.W. Blackburn E.H. Cell. 1987; 51: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). In most normal human cells, telomerase is either undetectable or expressed at an extremely low level (3Masutomi K. Yu E.Y. Khurts S. Ben-Porath I. Currier J.L. Metz G.B. Brooks M.W. Kaneko S. Murakami S. DeCaprio J.A. Weinberg R.A. Stewart S.A. Hahn W.C. Cell. 2003; 114: 241-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). As a result of telomere attrition, these cells will undergo a permanent cell cycle arrest (known as M1 senescence) at the end of their life span (Hayflick limit) (4Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Exp. Gerontol. 1992; 27: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). When this telomere-dependent cell cycle block is temporarily bypassed by the expression of viral oncogenes, such as SV40 T antigens, cells continue to loose telomeres and culminate in an M2 crisis in which severe chromosomal instability causes massive cell death (5Zhu J. Wang H. Bishop J.M. Blackburn E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3723-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 6Counter C.M. Avilion A.A. LeFeuvre C.E. Stewart N.G. Greider C.W. Harley C.B. Bacchetti S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1921-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar). Spontaneous immortalization arising from both M1 and M2 proliferative blocks is extremely rare (7Shay J.W. Van Der Haegen B.A. Ying Y. Wright W.E. Exper. Cell Res. 1993; 209: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 8Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 849-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The very few cells (10–7 to 10–5) that survive M2 crisis have attained the ability to maintain their telomeres, either by increasing telomerase or by acquiring a telomerase-independent alternative telomere-lengthening mechanism (ALT) (9Bryan T.M. Englezou A. Gupta J. Bacchetti S. Reddel R.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4240-4248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). The fact that elevated levels of telomerase activity have been found in vast majority of cancer cells and immortal cell lines (10Kim N.W. Piatyszek M.A. Prowse K.R. Harley C.B. West M.D. Ho P.L.

Cancer. 1997; 33: 787-791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2397) Google Scholar) suggests that the activation of telomerase is a critical step in tumorigenesis. Human telomerase activity is regulated at multiple levels, with a major regulatory step at hTERT transcription (12Aisner D.L. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 80-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Both positive and negative regulatory mechanisms of hTERT transcription have been reported. hTERT transcription can be activated by overexpressing several transcription factors such as c-Myc, Sp1, an Ets family protein ER81, and estrogen receptors (13Goueli B.S. Janknecht R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 14Kyo S. Takakura M. Kanaya T. Zhuo W. Fujimoto K. Nishio Y. Orimo A. Inoue M.

An examination of hTERT promoter sequences revealed the presence of consensus binding elements for these transcription factors, which activated the hTERT promoter in transient reporter assays. In addition, several tumor suppressor pathways have been implicated in the negative regulation of hTERT transcription. For example, E2F-1, Mad1, TGF-β, and Menin regulated the activity of the hTERT promoter and the level of hTERT mRNA (19Crowe D.L. Nguyen D.C. Tsang K.J. Kyo S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2789-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 20Lin S.Y. Elledge S.J. Cell. 2003; 113: 881-889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Although results from experiments studying reporter plasmids containing the hTERT promoter have provided insightful information on the transcriptional regulation of hTERT gene, these studies also indicated that the transiently transfected hTERT promoter was not an adequate model for the endogenous hTERT promoter. For example, we have demonstrated previously that transiently transected plasmid reporters containing –7.4 to +6.5 kb of the hTERT promoter sequence did not correlate with the status of the endogenous hTERT promoter in telomerase-positive and -negative fibroblasts (21Wang S. Zhu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18842-18850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Similarly, Ducrest et al. reported that transiently transfected green fluorescence protein reporters controlled by hTERT promoter sequences were equally active in telomerase-positive and -negative human 21NT breast carcinoma cells (22Ducrest A.L. Amacker M. Mathieu Y.D. Cuthbert A.P. Trott D.A. Newbold R.F. Nabholz M. Lingner J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7594-7602PubMed Google Scholar). Such discrepancies between the activities of transiently transfected promoters and transcription of the native hTERT promoter are likely resulted from missing distal regulatory elements and/or the lack of native chromatin configuration in the transiently transfected reporters (23Jeong S. Stein A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 370-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Therefore, understanding the transcriptional regulation of the native hTERT gene is crucial for dissecting the molecular mechanisms of cellular immortalization. The endogenous hTERT gene is likely repressed in normal human cells. Several previous reports have noted that inhibition of histone deacetylases led to hTERT transcription in telomerase-negative cells (24Xu D. Popov N. Hou M. Wang Q. Bjorkholm M. Gruber A. Menkel A.R. Henriksson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3826-3831Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 25Cong Y.S. Bacchetti S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35665-35668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms of hTERT induction by histone deacetylase inhibitors remain elusive. We have recently shown that inhibition of histone deacetylases induced hTERT transcription in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (21Wang S. Zhu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18842-18850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This induction of hTERT transcription was accompanied by the appearance of a major DNase I-hypersensitive site near the transcription start site of the endogenous hTERT promoter. These results provided strong evidence that a relief of repression at the endogenous promoter led to hTERT transcription. In the nucleus, promoters are embedded within various chromosomal environments. The transcription from a promoter is determined not only by proximal regulatory elements but also by distal elements and its surrounding chromatin configuration. The human α- and β-globin multi-gene complexes are among the best studied chromosomal regions (26Brown K.E. Amoils S. Horn J.M. Buckle V.J. Higgs D.R. Merkenschlager M. Fisher A.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 602-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The α-globin gene cluster is located in a region near the telomere of chromosome 16p, which contains many constitutively expressed genes and is accessible to nucleases in many cell types (27Vyas P. Vickers M.A. Simmons D.L. Ayyub H. Craddock C.F. Higgs D.R. Cell. 1992; 69: 781-793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 28Smith Z.E. Higgs D.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1373-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In contrast, the region containing the β-globin gene cluster on chromosome 11p is sensitive to DNase I only in erythroid cells in which β-globin genes are expressed. This region is in a close conformation and is less accessible to the nuclease in other cell types (29Engel J.D. Tanimoto K. Cell. 2000; 100: 499-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 30Felsenfeld G. Nature. 1992; 355: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). To further understand the hTERT regulation and its activation during cellular immortalization, it is necessary to study the endogenous hTERT gene in its native chromatin environment. Utilizing DNase I sensitivity assays, we have mapped the structure of the native hTERT promoter and its chromatin environment in pre-crisis and immortal human fibroblast cells as well as several commonly used cancer cell lines. Our data provides the first detailed mapping of the chromatin environment of the native hTERT gene. Cell Lines—3A96 (ALT), 3C104a (telomerase-positive), 3C166a (ALT), 3C167b (telomerase positive), and 3A96 (ALT) immortal lines and pre-crisis cells are derived from IMR90 cells and have been described previously (5Zhu J. Wang H. Bishop J.M. Blackburn E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3723-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 21Wang S. Zhu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18842-18850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). IMR90, HeLa, and 293 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Pre-crisis cells were infected with the recombinant retrovirus LNCX-c-Myc (31Felsher D.W. Zetterberg A. Zhu J. Tlsty T. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10544-10548Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and neomycin-resistant colonies were pooled to generate 3C/Myc cells. IMR90 and its derived cell lines were cultured in minimal essential medium (Mediatech) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). HeLa and 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% newborn calf serum (Mediatech). DNase I Assays—Isolation of nuclei, DNase I treatment, genomic DNA isolation, and Southern analysis were performed as reported previously (21Wang S. Zhu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18842-18850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Probes were amplified from genomic DNA by PCR (genomic fragments A, B, and E–Q; Table I). For genomic fragments C and D, the 270-bp StuI fragment of the human CRR9 cDNA was used as a probe. Full-length genomic bands were quantified by phosphoimaging analysis. Generalized DNase I sensitivity was calculated by the equation S = log(Xd/Xu)/log(Cd/Cu) × T, where X and C are test and control band intensities for the undigested (u) or digested (d) samples and T is the size ratio of the control to test fragments (32Saitoh N. Bell A.C. Recillas-Targa F. West A.G. Simpson M. Pikaart M. Felsenfeld G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2315-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Data from one experiment are presented.

Open table in a new tab RT-PCR—RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and PCR analysis were described in detail previously (21Wang S. Zhu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18842-18850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Primers for hTERT and CRR9 mRNA were published previously (21Wang S. Zhu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18842-18850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and primers for Xtrp2 mRNA are shown in Table I. For hTERT and CRR9 duplex RT-PCR, cDNAs were amplified for 32 cycles, whereas the Xtrp2 cDNA was amplified for 35 cycles. Telomerase Assay—A modified telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP assay) (33Krupp G. Kühne K. Tamm S. Klapper W. Heidorn K. Rott A. Parwaresch R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 919-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) was used to measure telomerase activity, as described previously (21Wang S. Zhu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18842-18850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Transcription of the hTERT Gene Is Accompanied by the Formation of DNase I Hypersensitive Sites at the hTERT Promoter—In our previous report, we identified a major DNase I-hypersensitive site (HS1) at the proximal region of the hTERT promoter in the SV40-transformed, telomerase-positive immortal cell line 3C167b. This HS1 was absent in both telomerase-negative pre-crisis cells and the ALT immortal line 3C166a. To extend this result and determine the role of DNase I-hypersensitive sites in hTERT transcription, we mapped DNase I hypersensitivity sites at the hTERT promoter from a variety of cell types, including IMR90 normal human fibroblasts and immortal fibroblast lines derived from IMR90 cells as well as cancer-derived HeLa and 293 cells. The generation of immortal fibroblast lines has been described previously (5Zhu J. Wang H. Bishop J.M. Blackburn E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3723-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 21Wang S. Zhu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18842-18850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and is illustrated in Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 2, normal human fibroblast IMR90 cells contained no DNase I-hypersensitive sites between the EcoRI and SphI sites of the hTERT promoter from –3918 to +1682 bp relative to the hTERT transcription start site. No DNase I-hypersensitive sites were detected in the telomerase-negative 3A96 ALT line either. In contrast, a major DNase I-hypersensitive site was identified at the proximal region of the hTERT promoter in the hTERT-expressing immortal line 3C104a. This hypersensitive site, named HS1, was located at the same position as the major DNase I-hypersensitive site that was detected in another telomerase-expressing immortal line, 3C167b (see Fig. 4 in Ref. 21Wang S. Zhu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18842-18850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). HS1, which was 3.9 kb from the upstream EcoRI site and 1.7 kb from the downstream SphI site, overlapped with the core hTERT promoter (within 100 bp upstream of the transcription start site). In addition to HS1, several minor DNase I-hypersensitive sites were also identified in 3C104a cells. When probe a was used to hybridize the 5′-end of the restriction fragment, three minor DNase I-hypersensitive bands (2.4, 1.6, and 1.1 kb) were detected. These minor bands corresponded to the presence of hypersensitive sites at approximately –1.5 kb, –2.3 kb, and –2.9 kb upstream of the hTERT transcription start site (Fig. 2A). These hypersensitive sites are also observed in hTERT-expressing 3C167b cells but not in telomerase-negative 3C166a ALT cells and pre-crisis 3C cells (21Wang S. Zhu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18842-18850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, our results indicated that the events leading to telomerase activation and immortalization of these SV40-transformed human fibroblast cells were associated with the remodeling of the chromatin configuration at the hTERT promoter. Because the presence of these DNase I-hypersensitive sites correlated with hTERT transcription, these sites were likely induced by the binding of transcriptional regulatory proteins to regions near these sites. We have further examined DNase I hypersensitivity of the hTERT promoter in several unrelated cancer-derived cell lines, including HeLa cells, a cervical carcinoma cell line, and 293 cells, a transformed embryonic kidney cell line. The major hypersensitive site HS1 and three minor DNase I-hypersensitive sites upstream of the hTERT promoter could be reproducibly identified in HeLa cells, although the HS1 band in this cell line was weaker than in other immortal lines examined. HS1 was also detected in 293 cells when probe b was used. Because of a polymorphic SphI site at approximately –2.6 kb upstream of the hTERT promoter in 293 cells, probe a could not be used to examine the hTERT promoter. In addition, HS1 was detected in the leukemia cell lines HL60 and U937 cells (data not shown). Thus, we concluded that these DNase I-hypersensitive sites were not unique to the immortal fibroblast cell lines and were likely present in a variety of different cell types that express telomerase. The hTERT Gene Is Located in a Large Repressive Chromatin Region—The chromatin environment in which a gene resides may play a dominant role in its transcriptional regulation. Within the 120-kb genomic region shown in Fig. 3A there are three genes, CRR9, hTERT, and Xtrp2. The upstream CRR9 gene is constitutively expressed in all cells and tissues examined (21Wang S. Zhu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18842-18850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 34Wang S. Robertson G.P. Zhu J. Gene. 2004; 343: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In contrast, the downstream Xtrp2 gene was reported to express exclusively in the kidney (35Nash S.R. Giros B. Kingsmore S.F. Kim K.M. el-Mestikawy S. Dong Q. Fumagalli F. Seldin M.F. Caron M.G. Recept. Channels. 1998; 6: 113-128PubMed Google Scholar). Its expression is undetectable in all of the cells that have been examined except in the cells of kidney origin (data not shown). To understand how the native chromatin environment influences the transcription of the hTERT gene, we set out to map the endogenous chromatin conformation using generalized DNase I sensitivity. The experiments were performed similarly to DNase I hypersensitivity assays, except that the rate of disappearance of a full-length genomic fragment was measured as a function of DNase I concentration. To obtain reliable information using this assay, we undertook several considerations, including those suggested by Saitoh et al. (32Saitoh N. Bell A.C. Recillas-Targa F. West A.G. Simpson M. Pikaart M. Felsenfeld G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2315-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). First, because the CRR9 gene is expressed at a similar level in all cell types examined (21Wang S. Zhu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18842-18850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 34Wang S. Robertson G.P. Zhu J. Gene. 2004; 343: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), chromosomal fragments within the 5′-half of this gene were used as internal controls. Second, because the kinetics of digestion depends on the length of each fragment, the digestion rate was normalized to the sizes of each restriction fragment. To avoid making excessive size adjustment, restriction fragments with similar lengths were compared wherever possible. For example, in Figs. 3 and 5, larger and smaller fragments were normalized to two adjacent fragments at the 5′-end of the CRR9 gene, the fragments A and B, respectively. Third, because the overall digestion rate of a chromosomal fragment is dominated by digestion at DNase I hypersensitivity sites within the fragment, chromosomal fragments containing detectable DNase I hypersensitivity sites were not included. Finally, all data were also compared with the α- and β-globin loci, the two chromosomal regions that have been studied extensively.Fig. 5Generalized DNase I sensitivity of the chromosomal region containing the hTERT locus in IMR90 normal fibroblasts and 3C/Myc cells. A, a schematic representation of generalized DNase I sensitivity. Fragments G and P were normalized to fragment B (designated as 1.0). All others were normalized to fragment A (1.0). B, sensitivity of chromosomal fragments to DNase I digestion as demonstrated by Southern analyses.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We first examined a pair of immortal cell lines, the telomerase-negative 3C166a ALT cells and the hTERT-expressing 3C167b (Fig. 3). As expected, most of the CRR9 gene was relatively sensitive to DNase I digestion, consistent with its abundant expression in both cell lines (21Wang S. Zhu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18842-18850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The chromatin became less sensitive toward its 3′-end. The intergenic region between the CRR9 and hTERT genes, the entire hTERT gene, and the Xtrp2 gene were considerably more resistant to DNase I digestion. A transition from the sensitive CRR9 gene to the resistant CRR9/hTERT intergenic region appeared near the 3′-end of the CRR9 gene. This pattern of generalized DNase I sensitivity was conserved between telomerase-negative 3C166a ALT cells and telomerase-positive 3C167b cells. To compare this chromosomal region to the α- and β-globin gene clusters, the same blots were also hybridized to DNA probes specific to these two regions. As shown in Fig. 3, the sensitivity of the SacI restriction fragment spanning the α1 gene in the α-globin gene cluster was similar to that of the CRR9 gene. The same result was obtained when a probe specific to the intergenic region between the ζ and α1 genes in the α cluster was used (data not shown). In contrast, a SphI-EcoRI fragment within the intergenic region between the Aγ and δ genes in the β cluster was resistant to DNase I, similarly to that of the chromatin region containing the hTERT and Xtrp2 genes (Fig. 3). Therefore, using the α- and β-globin gene clusters as references we revealed that, in both 3C166a and 3C167b cells, the chromatin region containing the hTERT gene was in a condensed conformation, whereas its upstream neighbor, the CRR9 locus, was relatively decondensed. To extend this result, we analyzed another pair of immortal cell lines, 3A96 ALT cells and 3C104a hTERT-expressing cells. In this experiment we used fewer (but representative) chromosomal fragments. As shown in Fig. 4, the generalized DNase I sensitivity of the 120-kb region in 3A96 cells and 3C104a cells was very similar to those of 3C166a and 3C167b cells. Because the immortal fibroblast lines were derived from SV40-transformed IMR90 cells (Fig. 1), we next examined the hTERT-containing chromatin region in their parental cells, the IMR90 normal human fibroblasts. The results, shown in Fig. 5, revealed that this DNase I-resistant domain also existed in IMR90 cells. Thus, the hTERT gene was embedded in a condensed chromosomal region in all of these fibroblast lines, regardless of the status of hTERT expression. To determine whether the DNase I-resistant chromosomal region identified in these studies was also present in other cell types, we examined HeLa and 293 cells. The closed chromatin region was clearly observed in HeLa cells (Fig. 6). The boundary between the open CRR9 gene and the closed region was also around the 3′-end of the CRR9 gene. In 293 cells the chromatin in the middle of CRR9/hTERT intergenic region was also highly resistant to DNase I digestion (Fig. 6A, fragment G). However, other regions, including the hTERT and Xtrp2 genes, were less resistant to the nuclease when compared with those in fibroblast cells and HeLa cells. Therefore, the condensed chromatin domain containing the hTERT gene was conserved in cell types other than fibroblasts, although the degree of condensation might vary among different cell types. Overexpression of c-Myc-induced hTERT Transcription and Chromatin Remodeling—It has been reported that c-Myc overexpression was sufficient to induce hTERT transcription (16Greenberg R.A. O'Hagan R.C.

https://openalex.org/W2032892678,"RGS14, a member of the regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) protein family, possesses an N-terminal RGS domain, two Raf-like Ras-binding domains, and a GoLoco motif, which has GDP dissociation inhibitor activity. In this study we show that unique among the known mammalian RGS proteins, RGS14 localizes in centrosomes. Its first Ras-binding domain is sufficient to target RGS14 to centrosomes. RGS14 also shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus, and its nuclear export depends on the CRM-1 nuclear export receptor. Mutation of a nuclear export signal or treatment with leptomycin B causes nuclear accumulation of RGS14 and its association with promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies. Furthermore, a point mutant defective in nuclear export fails to target to centrosomes, suggesting that nuclear cytoplasmic shuttling is necessary for its proper localization. Mild heat stress, but not proteotoxic or transcription-linked stresses, re-localizes the RGS14 from the cytoplasm to promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies. Expression of RGS14, but not point mutants that disrupt the functional activity of its RGS domain or GoLoco motif, enhances the reporter gene activity. The multifunctional domains and the dynamic subcellular localization of RGS14 implicate it in a diverse set of cellular processes including centrosome and nuclear functions and stress-induced signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1980082005,"In vitro studies have implicated the Lyn tyrosine kinase in erythropoietin signaling. In this study, we show that J2E erythroid cells lacking Lyn have impaired signaling and reduced levels of transcription factors STAT5a, EKLF and GATA-1. Since mice lacking STAT5, EKLF or GATA-1 have red cell abnormalities, this study also examined the erythroid compartment of Lyn−/− mice. Significantly, STAT5, EKLF and GATA-1 levels were appreciably lower in Lyn−/− erythroblasts, and the phenotype of Lyn−/− animals was remarkably similar to GATA-1low animals. Although young adult Lyn-deficient mice had normal hematocrits, older mice developed anemia. Grossly enlarged erythroblasts and florid erythrophagocytosis were detected in the bone marrow of mice lacking Lyn. Markedly elevated erythroid progenitors and precursor levels were observed in the spleens, but not bone marrow, of Lyn−/− animals indicating that extramedullary erythropoiesis was occurring. These data indicate that Lyn−/− mice display extramedullary stress erythropoiesis to compensate for intrinsic and extrinsic erythroid defects."
https://openalex.org/W1964174168,"β-Arrestin1 is an adapter/scaffold for many G protein-coupled receptors during mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. Phosphorylation of β-arrestin1 at position Ser-412 is a regulator of β-arrestin1 function, and in the present study, we showed that insulin led to a time- and dose-dependent increase in β-arrestin1 Ser-412 phosphorylation, which blocked isoproterenol- and lysophosphatidic acid-induced Ser-412 dephosphorylation and impaired ERK signaling by these G protein-coupled receptor ligands. Insulin treatment also led to accumulation of Ser-412-phosphorylated β-arrestin1 at the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor and prevented insulin-like growth factor 1/Src association. Insulin-induced Ser-412 phosphorylation was partially dependent on ERK as treatment with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 inhibited the insulin effect (62% reduction, p = 0.03). Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase by wortmannin did not have a significant effect (9% reduction, p = 0.41). We also found that the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) was in a molecular complex with β-arrestin1 and that the PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid increased Ser-412 phosphorylation. Concomitant addition of insulin and okadaic acid did not produce an additive effect on Ser-412 phosphorylation, suggesting a common mechanism. Small t antigen specifically inhibited PP2A, and in HIRcB cells expressing small t antigen, β-arrestin1 Ser-412 phosphorylation was increased, and insulin had no further effect. Insulin treatment caused increased β-arrestin1 Ser-412 phosphorylation, which blocked mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling and internalization by β-arrestin1-dependent receptors with no effect on β-adrenergic receptor Gs-mediated cAMP production.

In addition, the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptor, a receptor tyrosine kinase, has recently been found to activate MAP kinase signaling in a Gαi- and β-arrestin1-dependent manner (9Dalle S.

Thus, changes in β-arrestin function can have widespread implications for hormone signaling. We have recently found that insulin treatment is associated with down-regulation of β-arrestin1 protein (10Dalle S. Imamura T. Rose D.W. Worrall D.S. Ugi S. Hupfeld C.J. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6272-6285Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) as well as phosphorylation of β-arrestin1 Ser-412 (11Hupfeld C.J. Dalle S. Olefsky J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), representing possible new mechanisms of insulin-induced impairment of β-arrestin1-dependent GPCR signaling.Activation of adenylate cyclase and generation of cAMP following ligand binding to some GPCRs coupled to Gαs is attenuated once β-arrestin1 binds to the activated GPCR and sterically uncouples the receptor from further interaction with Gαs (5Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). Other GPCRs, however, utilize β-arrestin as a scaffold for assembly of a multiprotein signaling complex that leads to activation of ERK1/2 (12Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Moudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F.T. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar, 13DeFea K.A. Zalevsky J.

In addition, β-arrestin interacts with clathrin, targeting activated receptors to clathrin-coated pits for endocytosis (6Gagnon A.W. Kallal L. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

Therefore, β-arrestin performs a dual role during intracellular signaling by GPCRs: desensitizing signals leading to adenylate cyclase activation while coordinating and enhancing signals leading to ERK1/2 activation.As one would predict from the known functions of β-arrestin discussed above, a reduction of β-arrestin protein content using antisense oligonucleotide (17Mundell S.J. Loudon R.P. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8723-8732Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), knock-out gene technology (18Kohout T.A. Lin F.T. Perry S.J. Conner D.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc.

A. 2003; 100: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) is associated with both impaired desensitization of Gαs signaling (Gαs signal “supersensitization”) and impaired ERK activation.β-Arrestin1 function during G protein-mediated ERK signaling is also regulated by phosphorylation of the carboxyl terminus Ser-412 residue. Dephosphorylation of Ser-412 is required for the isoproterenol-stimulated association between β-arrestin1 and Src, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase involved in β1- and β2-adrenergic receptor (AR) mitogenic signaling (12Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Moudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F.T. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar). In addition, Ser-412 dephosphorylation is also required for β-arrestin1/clathrin association, which is essential for β2AR internalization (16Lin F.T. Kreuger K.M. Kendall H.E. Daaka Y. Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31051-31057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Mutants of β-arrestin1 that have a serine to aspartic acid substitution (S412D) and thus mimic the phosphorylated state at the 412 residue have reduced affinity for Src and for clathrin and function as dominant negative inhibitors of G protein-mediated MAP kinase signaling (16Lin F.T.

The mechanism behind the regulation of β-arrestin1 Ser-412 phosphorylation/dephosphorylation has not been described. We have recently shown that insulin treatment leads to β-arrestin1 degradation (10Dalle S. Imamura T. Rose D.W. Worrall D.S. Ugi S. Hupfeld C.J. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6272-6285Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) as well as increased β-arrestin1 Ser-412 phosphorylation (11Hupfeld C.J. Dalle S. Olefsky J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In these studies, insulin-induced changes in β-arrestin1 were associated with increased βAR/Gαs signaling (due to loss of Gαs signal desensitization) and with impaired Gαi-mediated MAP kinase activation (due to defective β-arrestin/Src and β-arrestin/clathrin interaction). However, the relative importance of insulin-induced protein degradation versus insulin-induced Ser-412 phosphorylation in these processes remains unclear.In addition, the mechanism of regulation of Ser-412 phosphorylation is unknown. Previous studies have described a role for ERK during Ser-412 phosphorylation (16Lin F.T. Kreuger K.M. Kendall H.E. Daaka Y. Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Lin F.T. Scott J.D. Wang H. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1588-1595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In this regard, we have recently found that insulin-induced reduction of PP2A activity is involved in the desensitization of ERK signaling (22Ugi S. Imamura T. Ricketts W. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2375-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), but the role of PP2A in regulating β-arrestin1 Ser-412 phosphorylation has not been described.In the current study, we present a new mechanism of insulin-induced desensitization of GPCR signaling. Thus, insulin-induces β-arrestin1 Ser-412 phosphorylation, and this disrupts many of the known β-arrestin1 functions in GPCR signaling. In addition, we demonstrate a novel role for PP2A in this process.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—IGF-1, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), PD98059, wortmannin, and okadaic acid were purchased from Calbiochem. CGP-12177 was purchased from Pierce. Anti-β-arrestin1 was from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-phospho-β-arrestin1 (Ser-412) and anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473) were from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-phospho-ERK1/2, anti-PP2, and anti-Src were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Insulin, isoproterenol, BRL 37344, and all other chemicals were from Sigma.Cell Culture—Confluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were differentiated and maintained at 37 °C with 10% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 4.5g/liter glucose, 10% fetal calf serum, 0.1% Glutamax, and penicillin/streptomycin. On day 1, medium was supplemented with 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (0.11 mg/ml), dexamethasone (0.2 μg/ml), and insulin (5 ng/ml). On day 4, the differentiation mixture was replaced with regular medium. On day 7, cells were reseeded, and experiments were performed on days 10–14 postdifferentiation. Cells were placed in serum-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1.0 g/liter glucose, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Glutamax, and penicillin/streptomycin) for 16 h prior to ligand stimulation unless otherwise indicated.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Cells were lysed, and protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay as described previously (9Dalle S. Ricketts W. Imamura T. Vollenweider P. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15688-15695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, 25 μg of cellular protein were dissolved in Laemmli buffer supplemented with dithiothreitol and boiled for 5 min. For immunoprecipitations, 500 μg of total protein were diluted to 1 μg/μl in PBS to which 3 μg of the appropriate antibody were added overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were captured by adding 40 μl of a 50% protein A/G bead mixture for an additional 1 h. Beads were then washed three times with PBS, dissolved in Laemmli buffer plus dithiothreitol, and boiled for 5 min. Proteins were separated by 7.5–10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 and probed with the appropriate primary and secondary antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody binding was detected by chemiluminescence.Generation of Small t Antigen-expressing Cell Lines—We have previously described the generation of stable cell lines expressing small t antigen in our laboratory (22Ugi S.

Rat-1 fibroblasts overexpressing human insulin receptors (HIRcB cells) were maintained as described previously (23Ricketts W.A. Rose D.W. Shoelson S. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5662-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), was a gift from Marc C. Mumby (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). cDNA from pCMV5-small t was digested with HindIII and BamHI and subcloned into pcDNA3.1/Hygro (Invitrogen), which contains the hygromycin B phosphotransferase gene. The resultant plasmid, pcDNA3.1/Hygro-small t, was transfected into HIRcB cells by using Superfect according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stable cell lines were selected in 400 μg of hygromycin B/ml. Clonal cell lines were isolated by limiting dilution and then screened by immunoblotting with anti-small t antibody. Parental cells transfected with pcDNA3.1/Hygro alone (Hyg cells) were used as a control.Intracellular cAMP Measurement—Intracellular cAMP levels were determined using the cAMP enzyme immunoassay system from Amersham Biosciences as described previously (11Hupfeld C.J. Dalle S. Olefsky J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) according to manufacturer's instructions.Ligand Binding Assay—βAR internalization was determined by ligand binding assay using CGP-12177, a hydrophilic βAR ligand, in the manner described previously (11Hupfeld C.J.

In 12-well plates, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were serum-starved overnight in the presence or absence of insulin (1 ng/ml), washed with PBS at 37 °C, and acutely stimulated with isoproterenol (10 μm for 15 min) in starvation medium. The reaction was terminated with rapid washing with ice-cold PBS, and 1μl/ml [3H]CGP-12177 was added to each well in a binding buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 20 μm HEPES, 10 nm unlabeled CGP-12177, at pH 7.4) and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C. Following washing with PBS, plasma membrane proteins were solubilized via two 10-min incubations in acidic buffer, and the resulting supernatant was assayed for 3H content by scintillation counting. NaOH cell lysis following acid extraction confirmed the retention of CGP-12177 at the cell surface as significant 3H was not detected in cell lysates. Nonspecific binding was determined by competitive inhibition of CGP-12177 binding with a saturating dose of propanolol (20 μm).Data Quantitation and Statistical Analyses—Densitometry results were quantitated using Kodak Image Station 440 software, and values are expressed as means ± S.E. Data were analyzed using the Student's t test, and p values were assigned with p ≤ 0.05 considered significant.RESULTSInsulin Treatment Leads to a Time- and Dose-dependent Increase of β-Arrestin1 Ser-412 Phosphorylation—We have previously shown that insulin treatment (100 ng/ml) for 8–12 h leads to proteasomally mediated degradation of β-arrestin1, reducing cellular β-arrestin1 function (10Dalle S. Imamura T. Rose D.W. Worrall D.S. Ugi S. Hupfeld C.J. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6272-6285Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser-412 can also impair β-arrestin1 activity, providing an alternate mechanism to functionally down-regulate this protein.As shown in Fig. 1, insulin treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes led to a time- (Fig. 1, A and B) and dose-dependent (Fig. 1, C and D) increase in Ser-412 phosphorylation of β-arrestin1. As indicated in Fig. 1B, the 6-h insulin pretreatment did not cause substantial β-arrestin1 protein degradation (reduced ∼10–15%). In contrast, treatment with isoproterenol and LPA, whose cognate GPCRs require β-arrestin1 Ser-412 dephosphorylation for ERK signaling (10Dalle S. Imamura T. Rose D.W. Worrall D.S. Ugi S. Hupfeld C.J. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6272-6285Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), led to Ser-412 dephosphorylation (Fig. 1E). EGF receptor signaling is independent of β-arrestin, and EGF stimulation did not have a significant effect on Ser-412 phosphorylation (Fig. 1E).Insulin Treatment Inhibits GPCR Ligand-mediated Ser-412 Dephosphorylation—Because increased β-arrestin1 Ser-412 phosphorylation could lead to desensitization of Gαi-coupled GPCR activation of MAP kinase, we determined whether insulin treatment prevented Ser-412 dephosphorylation induced by treatment with isoproterenol or LPA. Insulin pretreatment for 6 h prevented isoproterenol- and LPA-induced dephosphorylation of Ser-412 (Fig. 2, A and B) and also inhibited isoproterenol- and LPA-mediated ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 2C). Insulin treatment itself can impair ERK signaling due to Raf-1 hyperphosphorylation and uncoupling of Grb2 and SOS (26Klarlund J.K. Cherniack A.D. Czech M.P. J. Biol.

Consistent with this, the insulin pretreatment protocol did not cause generalized desensitization of ERK signaling as EGF-mediated ERK activation proceeded normally (Fig. 2D).Fig. 2Insulin treatment inhibits GPCR ligand-mediated Ser-412 dephosphorylation.A and C, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were serum-starved for 6 h in the presence or absence of insulin (Ins, 100 ng/ml).

The β1- and β2ARs utilize β-arrestin during ERK activation, while the β3AR activates ERK by a β-arrestin-independent but Src-dependent mechanism (29Cao W. Luttrell L.M. Medvedev A.V. Pierce K.L.

As insulin treatment causes a partial rather than complete inhibition of isoproterenol-mediated ERK activation, we hypothesized that β3AR-mediated ERK signaling, which is β-arrestin1-independent, is unaffected by insulin treatment. To test this, we measured ERK phosphorylation following treatment with the β3AR-specific ligand BRL 37344 in the presence or absence of insulin. As shown in Fig. 2E, insulin pretreatment did not impair β3AR-mediated ERK activation.Insulin Treatment Increases IGF-1R-associated Ser-412 Phosphorylated β-Arrestin1, Prevents IGF-1R/Src Association, and Blocks IGF-1-mediated ERK Activation—β-Arrestin1 is a scaffold for several signaling proteins involved in G protein-mediated ERK activation. Best characterized are the interactions between β-arrestin1 and Src, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, and clathrin, a protein involved in receptor internalization. Interaction between β-arrestin1 and these proteins requires dephosphorylation at the β-arrestin1 Ser-412 site. We have previously shown that IGF-1 treatment leads to β-arrestin1 recruitment to the IGF-1R and that IGF-1R-mediated ERK signaling is pertussis toxin-sensitive (dependent on Gαi) (9Dalle S.

Others have shown that IGF-1R-mediated ERK signaling is Src-dependent (30Boney C.M. Sekimoto H. Gruppuso P.A. Frackelton Jr., A.R. Cell Growth Differ. 2001; 12: 379-386PubMed Google Scholar), and internalization of the IGF-1R is β-arrestin- and clathrin-dependent (15Lin F.T. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31640-31643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar).Our preliminary studies showed that, unlike isoproterenol and LPA, IGF-1 treatment did not lead to detectable Ser-412 dephosphorylation in total cell lysates (not shown). We next determined whether the β-arrestin1 recruited to the IGF-1R following IGF-1 treatment is Ser-412-phosphorylated. We measured the amount of Ser-412-phosphorylated β-arrestin1 in IGF-1R immunoprecipitates and did not detect significant amounts either before or after IGF-1 treatment (Fig. 3A). In contrast, insulin pretreatment greatly increased the amount of Ser-412-phosphorylated β-arrestin1 associated with the IGF-1R following IGF-1 treatment. Strikingly the same insulin treatment protocol blocked IGF-1R/Src association (Fig. 3B) and reduced IGF-1-mediated ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 3C). Thus, IGF-1 normally recruits dephosphorylated β-arrestin1 to the receptor, which is fully competent to associate with Src and relay signals to ERK. In contrast, after insulin pretreatment, IGF-1 recruits Ser-412-phosphorylated β-arrestin1 to the receptor, which cannot couple to Src, and displays impaired downstream signaling.Fig. 3Insulin treatment increases IGF-1R associated Ser-412-phosphorylated β-arrestin1, prevents IGF-1R/Src association, and blocks IGF-1-mediated ERK activation.A and C, serum-starved 3T3-L1 adipocytes were pretreated with insulin (100 ng/ml) for 6 h.

To assess this, we used the MEK inhibitor PD98059 and found that it substantially reduced insulin-induced β-arrestin1 Ser-412 phosphorylation, while the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin had no effect (Fig. 4A). We quantified eight independent experiments using PD98059 and found it led to a 62% reduction in insulin-stimulated Ser-412 phosphorylation (Fig. 4B, p = 0.03). Quantification of a similar number of experiments using wortmannin failed to detect a significant effect (9% reduction, p = 0.41, data not shown). Blots showing the effectiveness of PD98059 (preventing MEK-dependent ERK phosphorylation) and wortmannin (preventing phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent Akt phosphorylation) are shown in Fig. 4, C and D.Fig. 4Insulin-induced β-arrestin1 Ser-412 phosphorylation involves ERK but not phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.A, serum-starved 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with insulin (100 ng/ml), PD98059 (PD, 20 μm), and wortmannin (WM, 100 nm) either alone or in combination for 6 h.

https://openalex.org/W1964830205,"The b isoform of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2, FGFR2b/FGFR2-IIIb/Ksam-IIC1/KGFR, a tyrosine kinase receptor, is expressed in a wide variety of epithelia and is downregulated in several human carcinomas including prostate, salivary and urothelial cell carcinomas. FGFR2b has been shown to inhibit growth in tumour cell lines derived from these carcinomas. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibition of human urothelial carcinoma cell growth following FGFR2b expression. Using a nylon DNA array, we analysed the gene expression profile of the T24 bladder tumour cell line, transfected or not with a construct encoding FGFR2b. The expression of FGFR2b in T24 cells decreased insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-II mRNA levels. This decrease was correlated with a decrease in IGF-II secretion and may have been responsible for the observed inhibition of cell growth because the addition of exogenous IGF-II restored growth rates to normal levels. Using SU5402, an inhibitor of FGFR tyrosine kinase activity, and a kinase dead mutant of the receptor, FGFR2b Y659F/Y660F, we also demonstrated that the growth inhibition and decrease in IGF-II secretion induced by FGFR2b did not require tyrosine kinase activity. Finally, we demonstrated the involvement of the distal carboxy-terminal domain of the receptor in decreasing IGF-II expression and inhibiting T24 cell growth, as Ksam-IIC3, a variant of FGFR2b carrying a short carboxy-terminus, neither downregulated IGF-II nor inhibited cell proliferation. Our data suggest that FGFR2b inhibits the growth of bladder carcinoma cells by reducing IGF-II levels via its carboxy-terminal domain, independent of its tyrosine kinase activity."

In this study, we investigated the effect of NADP(H) on the interaction of HO-1 with CPR by surface plasmon resonance. We found that HO-1 associated with CPR more tightly in the presence of NADP+ (KD = 0.5 μm) than in its absence (KD = 2.4 μm). The HO-1 mutants, K149A, K149A/K153A, and R185A, showed almost no heme degradation activity with NADPH-CPR, whereas they exhibited activity comparable to that of the wild type when sodium ascorbate was used. R185A showed a 100-fold decreased affinity for CPR compared with wild type, even in the presence of NADP+ (KD = 36.3 μm). The affinities of K149A and K149A/K153A for CPR were decreased 7- and 9-fold (KD = 16.8 and 21.8 μm), respectively. In contrast to R185A, the affinities of K149A and K149A/K153A were improved by the addition of NADP+ (KD = 5.2 and 9.6 μm, respectively), as was the case with wild type. Computer modeling of the HO-1/CPR complex showed that the guanidino group of Arg185 is located within the hydrogen bonding distance of 2′-phosphate of NADPH, suggesting that Arg185 contributes to the binding to CPR through an electrostatic interaction with the phosphate group. On the other hand, Lys149 is close to a cluster of acidic amino acids near the FMN binding site of CPR.

A study of the crystal structure of the complex between the heme- and FMN-binding domains of bacterial cytochrome P450 BM-3, in which the heme-containing P450 domain and the FMN/FAD-containing reductase domain are linked together in a single polypeptide, has shown that the FMN domain is positioned at the proximal face of the heme domain (45Sevrioukova I.F.

In addition, the hydrophobic membrane-anchoring region at the N terminus of CPR is essential for the recognition of cytochrome P450s (46Gilep A.A. Guryev O.L. Usanov S.A. Estabrook R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 937-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 47Gilep A.A. Guryev O.L. Usanov S.A. Estabrook R.W. Arch. Biochem.

In contrast to cytochrome P450, the HO activity can be reconstructed with the soluble forms of HO-1 and CPR, which lack their respective membrane binding regions (49Hayashi S. Omata Y. Sakamoto H. Hara T. Noguchi M. Protein Expr. Purif. 2003; 29: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Very recently Wang and Ortiz de Montellano (50Ortiz de Wang J. Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20069-20076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), using mutagenesis of human HO-1, have specified some basic surface residues of HO-1 that are involved in association with CPR and have also found that the binding site for CPR overlaps that for BVR to some extent. BVR is known to accelerate the release of biliverdin from HO (51Ortiz de Liu Y. Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5297-5307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). These findings have prompted us to hypothesize that there might be some kind of regulation of the protein-protein interactions between HO and its protein partners, CPR or BVR, either by substrate binding or by product release. In the present study, we investigated the effect of NADP(H) on the binding between the soluble forms of rat HO-1 and rat CPR using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Our kinetic data clearly showed that the binding is enhanced by addition of NADP+. Furthermore, using site-directed mutagenesis we have identified surface amino acids of HO-1 that are essential for binding to and/or electron transfer from CPR. Materials—NADP+, NADPH, NAD+, NADH, ADP, 2′,5′-ADP, hemin, and sodium ascorbate were obtained from Sigma. Sensor chip CM5 and 2-(2-pyridinyldithio)ethaneamine were purchased from BIAcore (Uppsala, Sweden). Enzymes—The soluble form of rat HO-1 lacking the 22-amino acid C-terminal hydrophobic stretch, called wild type HO-1 in this study, was expressed in E. coli and purified as described previously (52Omata Y. Asada S. Sakamoto H. Fukuyama K. Noguchi M. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 1017-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The mutants were generated from the wild type with the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (La Jolla, CA). The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The homogeneity of the purified enzymes was determined by SDS-PAGE. The ferric heme complexes of the wild type HO-1 or its mutants were purified by hydroxylapatite column chromatography after mixing 1.2 eq of heme with the enzyme (52Omata Y. Asada S. Sakamoto H. Fukuyama K. Noguchi M. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 1017-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Heme binding studies were carried out by difference absorption spectroscopy as previously described (53Wilks A. Schmitt M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 837-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Aliquots of heme (0.01-2 μm) were added to both sample (1 μm HO-1 or its mutants) and reference cuvettes at 25 °C. Spectra were recorded after each addition of heme. By plotting the absorbance at 405 nm against the amount of heme added, titration curves were constructed and analyzed using Deltagraph (DeltaPoint, Monterey, CA). A recombinant rat liver CPR that lacks the N-terminal 57 hydrophobic amino acids was expressed and purified as previously described (49Hayashi S. Omata Y. Sakamoto H. Hara T. Noguchi M. Protein Expr. Purif. 2003; 29: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The recombinant CPR contained one molecule each of FAD and FMN (49Hayashi S. Omata Y. Sakamoto H. Hara T. Noguchi M. Protein Expr. Purif. 2003; 29: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus CPR was quantified on the basis of the quantity of flavin released from the enzyme by boiling, using an extinction coefficient of 23.5 mm-1 for the absorbance at 450 nm (54Vermilion J.L. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2694-2704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purification of BVR from rat liver was carried out according to published procedures (55Kutty R.K. Maines M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3956-3962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), including 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose column chromatography. The HO activity was determined from the rate of bilirubin formation, which was monitored by the absorbance increase at 468 nm (49Hayashi S. Omata Y. Sakamoto H. Hara T. Noguchi M. Protein Expr. Purif. 2003; 29: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Binding Affinity Measurements—The interaction between the heme complex of HO-1 and CPR was determined by SPR technology using a BIAcore 1000 instrument (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Rat CPR protein possesses seven cysteine residues, and at least one of them, namely Cys228, is located on the molecular surface (33Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S. Kim J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). CPR was immobilized through thiol groups of cysteine residues with the aid of a coupling reagent, 2-(2-pyridinyldithio)ethaneamine. NADPH was included during the immobilizing reaction to protect the cysteine residues near the NADPH binding site and to stabilize the enzyme. To minimize nonspecific binding and mass transfer, the amount of the coupled CPR on the sensor chip was controlled at 2,000 resonance units (2 ng/mm2). Modification of CPR by 2-(2-pyridinyldithio)ethaneamine did not affect the enzyme activity. Binding analysis was performed at a flow rate of 10 μl/min at 25 °C. Before loading the HO-1 protein, the chip was equilibrated for at least 30 min with a running buffer, which contained 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, plus 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% of the surfactant P-20. To examine the effect of NADP+ or NAD+, the cofactor at several concentrations (10, 20, 50, and 100 μm) was included in the running buffer. The heme complex of the wild type HO-1 was diluted with the running buffer to 0.2, 1.0, and 2.0 μm, and an aliquot (30 μl) of each protein solution was injected over the chip surface. Binding analysis for the HO-1 mutants was also performed with 30 μl of the 1.0 μm enzyme solution. To regenerate the chip, a 3-min dissociation run was performed with the running buffer. Control experiments were performed on CPR-free surface. The blank sensorgram was subtracted from the assay curves using BIA-evaluation 3.1 software (BIAcore), which was also used for determination of the kinetic constants for the interaction. All kinetic parameters were determined from three independent experiments. A competition between CPR and BVR for binding to HO-1 was analyzed using a similar protocol. The heme complex of the wild type HO-1 (1 μm) and BVR (50 and 100 μm) were injected together onto the CPR-immobilized sensor chip equilibrated with the running buffer in the presence or absence of 100 μm NADP+. Measurements of Single Turnover HO Reaction—Single turnover HO reactions of the wild type and the mutant enzymes were monitored by optical absorption changes with a JASCO V-560 UV-visible spectrophotometer at 25 °C. In general, the standard reaction mixture (100 μl) contained 5 μm heme complex of the wild type or its mutant enzymes, 40 nm CPR and 25 μm NADPH (5 molar equivalents to the heme complex) in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Spectra were recorded over the range of 300-900 nm. When ascorbate was employed as reductant, 20 mm sodium ascorbate was added in place of NADPH-CPR. Measurement of the Reduction Rates of Ferric Heme Complex of HO-1 and Its Mutants—The reaction mixture (100 μl) for the CPR-supported reaction containing 5 μm heme complex of the wild type HO-1 or its mutants, and 4 nm CPR in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was placed in a sealed quartz cuvette. To stop the reaction completely at the stage of the ferrous heme state, the solution and the gas phase in the cuvette were saturated with 100% CO and then 2 μl of 1.5 mm NADPH was added by syringe. The spectral changes were monitored at 10-s intervals. In the ascorbate-supported reaction, 2 μl of 1 m sodium ascorbate was added in place of NADPH-CPR. The reduction rate constant was determined by fitting the spectral changes at 405 (ferric form) and 421 nm (CO-reduced form) with a single-exponential function using Cary WinUV software (Varian, Palo Alto, CA) Computer Modeling—The program Hex was used to predict the structure of the complex of rat HO-1 and rat CPR. This program is an interactive protein docking and molecular superposition program and supports a Fourier-based calculation of electrostatic interaction energies (56Ritchie D.W. Kemp G.J. Proteins. 2000; 39: 178-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The program was run on a Unix-based SGI octane R12000 computer workstation, which has a clock speed of 300 MHz. Briefly, a docking calculation was started from a randomly oriented rat HO-1 (Protein Data Bank code 1DVE) placed over rat CPR (Protein Data Bank code 1AMO). Roughly 72 million trial orientations were generated by spinning the molecules (5 rotational degrees of freedom), and by varying the intermolecular distance in 0.5-Å steps (1 degree of freedom). These orientations were scored using shape correlations to n = 16, and the best 20,000 orientations were then passed to a high resolution scoring stage, which used both shape and electrostatic correlations at n = 30. The best 1,000 of the n = 30 orientations were then refined using a soft molecular mechanics rigid body minimization algorithm. After minimization, the lowest energy solution was selected from 283 docking solutions. Effect of NADP+on the Association of HO-1 with CPR—The interaction between the ferric heme complex of HO-1 and CPR was examined using an SPR technique. CPR was immobilized on the dextran surface through the thiol groups of cysteine residues. Fig. 1 shows representative association and dissociation curves with three different concentrations (0.2, 1.0, and 2.0 μm) of the HO-1 complex in the absence (Fig. 1A) and presence (Fig. 1B) of 100 μm NADP+. In both conditions, typical association and dissociation phases were observed by real-time measurements of the interaction between HO-1 and CPR. These binding curves clearly indicated that HO-1 binds more tightly to CPR in the presence of NADP+ than in its absence. By analyzing the association and dissociation phases of the binding curves, the association (ka) and dissociation (kd) rate constants as well as the dissociation equilibrium constant (KD) were estimated (Table I). The ka value in the presence of NADP+ was ∼5-fold larger than that in the absence of NADP+, whereas the kd values were almost identical under both conditions. Hence, the KD value for the binding of HO-1 to CPR in the presence and absence of NADP+ were 0.49 and 2.4 μm, respectively. These results indicate that NADP+ increases the affinity of HO-1 for CPR by accelerating the association rate.Fig. 1Binding sensorgrams of the heme complex of the wild type HO-1 to the immobilized CPR in the absence (A) and presence (B) of 100 μm NADP+ The concentrations of the heme complex of HO-1 injected onto the sensor chip are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IThe association rate (ka), dissociation rate (kd), and dissociation (KD) constants of CPR with the heme complex of the wild type HO-1 and its mutants in the presence or absence of 100 μm NADP+kakdKDm-1s-1s-1μmWild type1620 ± 2103960 ± 6282.44 ± 0.6Wild type + NADP+7930 ± 4153920 ± 8760.494 ± 0.1K18A1130 ± 2682640 ± 7852.34 ± 0.2K18A + NADP+6170 ± 3482860 ± 5500.494 ± 0.1K22A1410 ± 2143730 ± 3382.65 ± 0.2K22A + NADP+5020 ± 2573480 ± 4470.496 ± 0.1K149A222 ± 143720 ± 12116.8 ± 1.8K149A + NADP+567 ± 562960 ± 3165.21 ± 0.3K149A/K153A166 ± 143630 ± 16521.8 ± 1.8K149A/K153A + NADP+307 ± 102950 ± 1169.62 ± 0.2R185A111 ± 155150 ± 10044.0 ± 5.5R185A + NADP+71 ± 112570 ± 21336.3 ± 7.7 Open table in a new tab Fig. 2 shows remarkable NADP+-dependent changes in the sensorgrams. The affinity of HO-1 for CPR increased with increasing concentration of NADP+ (0-50 μm) and reached a maximal level with 100 μm NADP+ (Fig. 2A). In contrast, even 100 μm NAD+ had little effect on the binding of HO-1 to CPR (Fig. 2B); the KD value for the binding of HO-1 to CPR in the presence of 100 μm NAD+ was calculated to be 2.0 μm, which was comparable to that in the absence of NADP+. The enhancement effect of 2′,5′-ADP on the affinity of HO-1 for CPR was recognized although it was weak; indeed the KD value in the presence of 2.0 mm 2′,5′-ADP was 1.0 μm. On the other hand, ADP that bears no 2′-phosphate group did not show any significant effect on the binding of the two proteins. Thus, the phosphate group of NADP+ must be crucial for the association between HO-1 and CPR. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of NADP+ on the interaction between HO-1 and CPR in the presence of BVR, a competitor of CPR binding to HO-1 (50Ortiz de Wang J. Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20069-20076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, BVR (50 μm) completely inhibited the binding of HO-1 to CPR in the absence of NADP+. However, in the presence of NADP+ (Fig. 3B), BVR, even at a concentration of 100 μm, caused only a partial inhibition of the binding. This result indicates that NADP+ is able to enhance the affinity of CPR for HO-1 irrespective of the presence or absence of BVR, suggesting a physiological role of NADP(H) in the interaction between HO-1 and CPR.Fig. 3Competitive binding of CPR and BVR to HO-1 in the absence (A) and presence (B) of NADP+ The heme complex of the wild type HO-1 (1 μm) and BVR (0, 50, and 100 μm, as indicated) were injected together onto the CPR-immobilized sensor chip equilibrated with running buffer without (A) or with (B) 100 μm NADP+.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Properties of HO-1 Mutants—To search for surface ionic residues of the HO-1 protein that play key roles in binding to CPR, we prepared Ala mutants of Lys18, Lys22, Arg27, Arg35, Lys39, Lys149, Lys153, Lys177, and Arg185. These residues are 1) relatively conserved among species, 2) positively charged, and 3) exposed to the molecular surface. SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that the purified mutant enzymes were highly homogeneous and had the expected molecular weights (data not shown). The ratio of heme bound to the mutants was calculated by difference absorption spectroscopy; all purified HO-1 mutants formed ferric heme complexes by binding a single equivalent of heme. The absorption spectra of the heme complexes of all mutants were very similar to that of the wild type complex. The heme dissociation constants (Kd) for the mutants were comparable to that for the wild type (Table II), indicating the heme complexes of these mutants were folded properly.Table IIThe NADPH-CPR- and ascorbate-supported HO activities of the wild type HO-1 and its mutants, and their heme dissociation constants (kd)NADPH-CPRAscorbateKd of heme%%μmWild type1001000.35K18A1031010.44K22A971000.39R27A1001000.35R35A100960.35K39A72830.42K149A3940.36K153A21960.36K149A/K153A0890.35K177A701000.36R185A4970.37 Open table in a new tab We next compared the HO activities of the wild type and the mutants with two reducing systems: NADPH-CPR and sodium ascorbate (Table II). With NADPH-CPR, most of the Ala mutants exhibited enzyme activity substantially similar to that of the wild type (70-103%) except for the Lys149, Lys153, and Arg185 mutants. K149A and K153A retained only 3 and 21%, respectively, of the wild type activity, and the double mutant, K149A/K153A, showed no activity. R185A also had almost completely lost activity (4%). With ascorbate, however, all mutants exhibited HO activity comparable to that of the wild type. These results suggested that the mutations of Arg185, Lys149, and Lys153 did not alter the active site structure of HO-1 but rather affected the interaction between HO-1 and C"

Here, we studied the interactions between the N- (N-SH2) and C- (C-SH2) terminal SH2 domains of the p85 subunit of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and eight ErbB3 receptor-derived phosphotyrosyl peptides (P-peptides) by using molecular dynamics, free energy, and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analyses. In SPR analysis, these P-peptides showed no binding to the C-SH2 domain, but P-peptides containing a phospho-YXXM or a non-phospho-YXXM motif did bind to the N-SH2 domain. The N-SH2 domain has two phosphotyrosine binding sites in its N- (N1) and C- (N2) terminal regions. Interestingly, we found that P-peptides of pY1180 and pY1241 favored to bind to the N2 site, although all other P-peptides showed favorable binding to the N1 site. Remarkably, two phosphotyrosines, pY1178 and pY1243, which are just 63 amino acids apart from the pY1241 and pY1180, respectively, showed favorable binding to the N1 site. These findings indicate a possibility that the pair of phosphotyrosines, pY1178-pY1241 or pY1243-pY1180, will fold into an appropriate configuration for binding to the N1 and N2 sites simultaneously. Our model structures of the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of ErbB3 receptor also strongly supported the speculation. The calculated binding free energies between the N-SH2 domain and P-peptides showed excellent qualitative agreement with SPR data with a correlation coefficient of 0.91. The total electrostatic solvation energy between the N-SH2 domain and P-peptide was the dominant factor for its binding affinity.

Beguinot L. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12320-12324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The p85 has a tandem SH2 region; two SH2 domains at N-terminal (N-SH2) and C-terminal (C-SH2) domains linked by the inter-SH2 (IS) region (Fig. 1). Generally, the existence of both N-SH2 and C-SH2 domains induces high affinity interaction with phosphotyrosine and activation of PI3K; however, binding of individual SH2 domains to the phosphotyrosyl peptides is quite specific. Phosphotyrosyl peptides derived from IRS-1 (17Felder S. Zhou M. Hu P. Urena J. Ullrich A. Chaudhuri M. White M. Shoelson S.E. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell.

Pawson T. Waterfield M.D. Mol. Cell.

J. 1998; 333: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an NMR study of p85 N-SH2 and a doubly phosphorylated peptide derived from a polyomavirus middle T antigen (PvMT) complex revealed double phosphotyrosine binding in N-SH2 (18Weber T. Schaffhausen B. Liu Y. Günther U.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15860-15869Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, the interaction mechanism of p85 SH2 and phosphotyrosyl peptides is quite complex. To study this complexity, we analyzed the interaction of ErbB3 receptor-derived phosphotyrosyl peptides and SH2 domains of p85 using SPR analysis and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. MD simulation has been acknowledged as a powerful method to investigate protein-protein, protein-ligand, and protein-DNA interactions at the atomic level. The molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) method has been recently proposed for calculating free energies of macromolecules in solution (19Srinivasan J. Cheatham T.E.

In this study, we first investigated the interactions between the tandem SH2 (N-SH2, IS, and C-SH2 domains), N-SH2 and C-SH2 domains of the p85 subunit of the PI3K, and eight phosphotyrosyl peptides derived from the ErbB3 receptor (P-peptides: pY1035, pY1178, pY1180, pY1241, pY1243, pY1257, pY1270, and pY1309) using SPR and cellular interaction analyses.

The proteins were then purified with a glutathione-Sepharose 4FF column (Amersham Biosciences) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol and eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm glutathione. The SH2 domain was dialyzed against a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The purity of the samples was checked using SDS-PAGE, and the protein concentrations were determined with protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). Interaction Analysis—BIAcore 3000 system (Biacore AB) was used to experimentally determine the kinetic constants of SH2-P-peptides interactions as previously described (34Suenaga A. Hatakeyama M. Ichikawa M. Yu X. Futatsugi N. Narumi T. Fukui K. Terada T. Taiji M. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Konagaya A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5195-5200Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The association rate constant (ka) and the dissociation rate constant (kd) were determined with a nonlinear least square method using BIAevaluation 3.0 software. KD was obtained by calculating kd/ka. Three independent measurements were performed for each set, and the average was obtained. MCF-7 human breast cancer cells that endogenously express high amounts of ErbB3 receptor (40Vadlamudi R.

For heregulin β176–246 (HRG, a ligand for the ErbB3 receptor) treatment, cells were serum-starved overnight and stimulated with or without 1 nm HRG (R&D Systems) for 5 min. MCF-7 cells were then washed with PBS and homogenized in cell lysis buffer containing 5 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 10 mm thioglycerol, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitors. After centrifugation, clear supernatant was used for peptide binding analysis. Biotinylated P-peptides and the corresponding non-phosphopeptides were dissolved in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm aprotinin, and 4 mm dithiothreitol at a final concentration of 1 μm. 10–15 μl of streptavidin agarose slurry (Oncogene Research Product) was incubated in the above peptide solution (100 μl) for 1 h at 4 °C and washed three times with PBS. Each immobilized peptide bead was incubated with the MCF-7 cell lysate (1 mg each) for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with PBS and applied to Western blot. Dissolved protein bands were detected with an anti-p85 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The solution structure of the p85 N-SH2 domain (amino acids 321–431)/P-peptide (derived from PvMT: amino acids 312–326) complex (Supplemental Fig. 1) was taken from the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 1FU5) (18Weber T. Schaffhausen B. Liu Y. Günther U.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15860-15869Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The p85 N-SH2 has two phosphotyrosine binding sites in its N- (N1) and C-terminal (N2) regions (Arg-340 and Lys-423, respectively) (Fig. 1 and Supplemental Fig. 1). Eight complex structures of P-peptides (Table I) with the p85 N-SH2 used in this study were constructed based on the solution structure using MOE (Chemical Computing Group, Inc.). The modeling procedures were as follows: (i) amino acid residues were added, deleted, or replaced with appropriate residue manually; and (ii) the structure was energy-minimized in vacuum with an all-atom position fixing of the p85 N-SH2. As the initial structure for MD simulation of free p85 N-SH2, the p85 N-SH2 was extracted from the solution structure. Eight P-peptides were also extracted from each complexed structure as the initial structure for MD simulations of the free P-peptides. The N and C termini of the P-peptides were capped by acetyl and N-methyl groups, respectively, for neutralization of the charge. For MD simulations, the systems of eight p85 N-SH2/P-peptide complexes (P-peptides bound with the N1 site; N1 simulation), another eight of those complexes (P-peptides bound with the N2 site; N2 simulation), a free p85 N-SH2, and eight free P-peptides were prepared (total of 25 systems). These systems were spherically surrounded by TIP3P water molecules (42Jorgensen W.L. Chandrasekhar J. Madura J.D. Impey R.W. Klein M.L. J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79: 926-935Crossref Scopus (30043) Google Scholar). The size of the sphere was chosen so that the distance of atoms in the protein from the wall was longer than 15.0 Å. Then the fully solvated systems were energy-minimized. All MD simulations were carried out using modified Amber 6.0 (43Case D.A. Pearlman D.A. Caldwell J.W. Cheatham T.E. II I Ross W.S. Simmerling C.

Susukita R. Ebisuzaki T. McNiven G. Elmergreen B. Mol. Simul. 1999; 21: 401-415Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The parm96 force field (44Kollman P.A. Dixon R. Cornell W. Fox T. Chipot C. Pohorille A. Wilkinson P. Weiner P. van Gunsteren W.F. Computer Simulations of Biological Systems. 3. Elsevier, New York1997: 83-96Google Scholar) was adopted, and the time step was set at 1 fs. All non-bonded interactions, van der Waals, and Coulomb forces and energies were calculated using the MDM accurately. The bond lengths involving hydrogen atoms were constrained to equilibrium lengths using the SHAKE method (45Ryckeart J-P. Ciccotti G. Berendsen H.J.C. J. Comput. Chem. 1977; 23: 327-341Google Scholar). The temperature of each system was gradually heated to 300 K during the first 100 ps period, and additional 900 ps MD simulations were performed for data collection. The temperature was kept constant at 300 K using the method of Berendsen et al. (46Berendsen H.J.C. Postma J.M.P. van Gunstere W.F. DiNola A. Haak J.R. J. Comput. Phys. 1984; 81: 3684-3690Google Scholar) coupled to a temperature bath with coupling constants of 0.2 ps. The production MD trajectory was collected for a 300 ps period (from 700 to 1,000 ps) with each snapshot saved every 10 ps. The set of structures obtained by an MD trajectory was sampled for use in estimating binding free energies. In the analysis of binding free energies, the water molecules were replaced with implicit solvation models. The procedures for estimating the binding free energy have been described in detail in the previous report (34Suenaga A. Hatakeyama M. Ichikawa M. Yu X. Futatsugi N. Narumi T. Fukui K. Terada T. Taiji M. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Konagaya A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5195-5200Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, the Delphi program (47Rocchia W. Alexov E. Honig B. J. Phys. Chem.

Chem. 1994; 98: 1978-1988Crossref Scopus (1860) Google Scholar) (van der Waals radii) and parm96 charges were used in the PB calculation, and the grid spacing used was 0.5 Å. The dielectric constants inside and outside the molecule were 1.0 and 80.0, respectively. Normal mode analysis was employed to estimate the conformational entropy (50Brooks B.R. Janeič D. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1995; 16: 1522-1553Crossref Scopus (453) Google Scholar). To elucidate the structural model of the cytoplasmic regulatory C-terminal region of the ErbB3 receptor (amino acids 966–1342), we performed the FORTE search (51Tomii K. Akiyama Y. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 594-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The FORTE is a method used to identify structural similarities between proteins through profile-profile comparisons. To build a backbone model from the alignment derived from the FORTE search, we used the AL2TS program 2AL2TS service by the Protein Structure Prediction Center (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory) provides a method to translate structure alignment (AL) format to tertiary structure (TS) format. that converts sequence structure alignment into standard PDB format. All side chains were generated through the LEAP module of Amber 6.0, and the side-chains were energy-minimized with position fixing of all backbone atoms. The model structure of the ErbB3 receptor and p85 N-SH2 were docked manually to reproduce the N1-pY1178 and N2-pY1241, and N1-pY1243 and N2-pY1180 interactions, and the energy of the docking structures was minimized. SPR and Cellular Interaction Analyses—Binding of tandem SH2, N-SH2, and C-SH2 domains of p85 and the ErbB3 receptor-derived eight P-peptides were analyzed (Table II). Results showed specific binding of tandem SH2 to the P-peptides that include the pYXXM motif (pY1035, pY1178, pY1241, pY1257, and pY1270). None of the C-SH2, or SH3 and BCR domains of p85 showed detectable binding to P-peptides (data not shown). These results on tandem SH2 binding were consistent with the earlier study describing that pYXXM is a specific binding motif for p85 SH2 (4Hellyer N.J. Kim M.S. Koland J.G. J. Biol.

The interaction analysis of the p85 with P-peptides and non-phosphopeptides in HRG-stimulated MCF-7 cells clearly supported the SPR data on tandem SH2 (Fig. 2). Our data suggested a difference in binding patterns between the p85 N-SH2 and the tandem SH2 or p85 subunit (SH3, BCR and tandem SH2). To understand the binding mechanism of p85 N-SH2 to the P-peptides, MD simulation and structure modeling were performed.Table IISPR analysis of P85 SH2 domain/P-peptide binding affinityP-peptideBinding proteinKaKdKD×104m-1 s-1×10-3 s-1nmpY1035Tandem SH2aTandem SH2 (amino acids 333–724) of the p85 subunit38.4 ± 1.822.06 ± 0.045.38 ± 0.36N-SH2bN-terminal SH2 domain (amino acids 333–428) of the p85 subunit568 ± 8316.7 ± 2.22.94 ± 0.82pY1178Tandem SH270.6 ± 1.32.42 ± 0.073.42 ± 0.16N-SH216.9 ± 0.74.28 ± 0.4825.4 ± 3.9pY1180Tandem SH211.0 ± 1.17.43 ± 0.2467.5 ± 8.7N-SH211.0 ± 0.71.35 ± 0.0612.3 ± 1.3pY1241Tandem SH2108 ± 5.26.81 ± 0.736.33 ± 0.99N-SH2824 ± 13112.9 ± 1.71.56 ± 0.46pY1243Tandem SH24.81 ± 0.9710.5 ± 2.36218 ± 93N-SH227.0 ± 5.42.03 ± 0.227.52 ± 2.33pY1257Tandem SH250.0 ± 6.365.31 ± 1.0610.6 ± 3.46N-SH2243 ± 23.85.17 ± 0.512.13 ± 0.42pY1270Tandem SH224.7 ± 3.471.29 ± 0.145.20 ± 1.29N-SH24.17 ± 0.440.31 ± 0.017.53 ± 1.13pY1309Tandem SH22.94 ± 0.517.58 ± 1.92258 ± 110N-SH22.42 ± 0.442.54 ± 0.16105 ± 25.8a Tandem SH2 (amino acids 333–724) of the p85 subunitb N-terminal SH2 domain (amino acids 333–428) of the p85 subunit Open table in a new tab MD Simulations—We performed 25 series of 1-ns MD simulations for estimating binding free energies between the p85 N-SH2 and P-peptides. From the backbone heavy atom root mean square deviations (r.m.s.d.) of the p85 N-SH2 and P-peptides from the initial structures (Supplemental Fig. 2), the structures of the p85 N-SH2 were stable through the period of 700–1,000 ps in the N1, N2, and the free N-SH2 simulations (3.13 ± 0.12, 3.05 ± 0.11 and 2.26 ± 0.09 Å, respectively). Because the initial structures of all P-peptides in our MD simulations were modeled, the r.m.s.d. of P-peptides in the N1, N2, and free P-peptide simulations greatly fluctuated (7.64 ± 0.82 Å) (Supplemental Table I). Binding Free Energies between p85 N-SH2 and P-peptides—To examine whether the calculated energies can evaluate binding free energies precisely, fluctuations of the calculated energies were examined. The average values and the standard deviations of calculated enthalpy H (sum of the internal energy of protein (EMM), the electrostatic solvation energy (GPB) and non-polar solvation energy (GASA)) and entropic contribution TS were checked. Each standard deviation of the H of the p85 N-SH2/P-peptides complexes and the free p85 N-SH2 were smaller than 1.0%, and those of the free P-peptides were also smaller than 3.0% (Supplemental Table II). These results indicate that the calculated energies are stable during the simulations; thus, these values can be utilized for evaluating the binding free energy, although the r.m.s.d. of the p85 N-SH2/P-peptide complexes and the free P-peptides fluctuated to some extent (Supplemental Fig. 2). As a result of analysis, the calculated binding free energies on P-peptides except for pY1309 and p85 N-SH2 obtained from MM-PBSA method showed excellent qualitative agreement with those obtained from SPR analysis (correlation coefficient was 0.91) (Table III and Fig. 3). Unexpectedly, the binding free energy of the p85 N-SH2/pY1309 complex obtained from N1 and N2 simulations showed no good agreement with that obtained from experimental analysis. The r.m.s.d. of the pY1309 extracted from the p85 N-SH2/pY1309 complex was unstable, increased monotonously, and greatly fluctuated from 700 to 1,000 ps (Supplemental Fig. 2 and Supplemental Table I). The root mean square fluctuations (r.m.s.f.) of phosphotyrosines in all P-peptides highly correlated with the binding free energies obtained from experimental analysis (correlation coefficient was 0.92). The r.m.s.f. of the pY1309 showed the largest value among all P-peptides tested (2.46 Å). In addition, residues around the phosphotyrosine, pY1309, (residues from pY-3 to pY) fluctuated more than others. From the theoretical study, KD is very sensitive to the fluctuations of molecules that form the complex; that is, a large fluctuation of molecules results in low binding affinity (54Luo H. Sharp K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10399-10404Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Thus the inconsistency in the binding free energies obtained from computational and experimental analyses may be caused by these fluctuations of the residues around the pY1309.Table IIIThe calculated binding free energies between p85 N-SH2 and P-peptidesP-peptideΔGcalc(N1)aThe values were obtained from N1 simulationΔGcalc(N2)bThe values were obtained from N2 simulationΔGexppY1035131.64cAll energies are in kcal/mol–76.61–11.63pY1178–56.65–54.35–10.35pY1180199.19–29.71–10.78pY1241–92.11–164.33–12.00pY1243–85.17–8.16–11.07pY1257–177.44–142.49–11.82pY1270–114.5824.92–11.07pY1309–210.53–91.48–9.51a The values were obtained from N1 simulationb The values were obtained from N2 simulationc All energies are in kcal/mol Open table in a new tab Interestingly, the result of calculated binding free energies showed that pY1180 and pY1241 favored the N2 site in the p85 N-SH2, though all other P-peptides favored the N1 site. There are two tyrosines, Tyr-1178 and Tyr-1243, which are just 63 amino acids apart from pY1241 and pY1180, respectively, and these two tyrosines showed favorable binding to the N1 site when they are phosphorylated. These findings indicate the possibility that the pair of phosphotyrosines, pY1178-pY1241 or pY1243-pY1180, will fold into appropriate configuration for binding to N1 and N2 sites at once. Our model structures of the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of the ErbB3 receptor strongly supported this speculation (Fig. 4). Component Analysis of Binding Free Energies—Next, the dominant factor for binding affinity (with the exception of pY1309) was identified by component analysis of the binding free energies. The regression coefficients between the calculated binding free energies and its components indicate contribution of the energetic component to the binding affinity (Table IV). Since the absolute values of the regression coefficients of the electrostatic energy ΔEele (regression coefficient of -5.26) and the electrostatic solvation energy ΔGPB (regression efficient of 6.25) were larger than that of the other components, these components seem to greatly contribute to binding affinity.Table IVComponent analysis of calculated binding free energiesP-peptideΔEvdwaAll energies are in kcal/molΔEeleΔGPBΔGASAΔGint-TΔSΔGelebΔGele is ΔEele + ΔGPBΔGcalcΔGexppY1035cThe values of pY1180 and pY1241 were obtained from N2 simulations, and others were from N1 simulations–77.56–340.48172.37–5.5550.3069.28–168.11–131.64–11.63pY1178–60.79–892.18798.18–5.7334.0469.83–94.00–56.65–10.35pY1180–89.75–1232.111176.84–6.7331.3390.71–55.27–29.71–10.78pY1241–60.02–508.27300.45–3.2553.8352.93–207.82–164.33–12.00pY1243–21.89–618.20438.44–3.1956.1563.52–179.76–85.17–11.07pY1257–66.80–333.38119.29–4.4337.6770.21–214.09–177.44–11.82pY1270–88.48–739.06583.14–7.0556.2780.60–155.92–114.58–11.07pY1309–45.64–630.81363.46–4.335.9770.79–267.35–210.53–9.51Corr.

In contrast, the ΔEele and the ΔGexp showed negative correlations of -0.79. Interestingly, total electrostatic solvation energy ΔGele, which is the sum of the ΔEele and the ΔGPB and the ΔGexp showed the highest correlation among all energy components (correlation coefficient of 0.84). This result indicates that the ΔGPB and the ΔEele compensate for each other, and the ΔGele between the p85 N-SH2 and the P-peptides is the dominant factor for binding affinity. To clarify the reason for the negative correlation between the ΔEele and the ΔGexp, the hydrogen bonds between p85 N-SH2 and the P-peptides were investigated. The number of hydrogen bonds and the ΔGexp showed high correlation (correlation coefficient of 0.82), and these results indicate that a lesser number of hydrogen bonds induces higher binding affinity (Supplemental Fig. 3). This fact also explains the strong negative correlation between ΔEele and the ΔGexp (Table IV). This means that loss of hydrogen-bonded energy between p85 N-SH2 and P-peptides are compensated by the solvation of the p85 N-SH2 and P-peptides. Binding of p85 to the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins is an essential step for the activation of the p110 catalytic subunit of PI3K. Our SPR analysis showed that p85 N-SH2 mainly contributes to the interaction with the ErbB3 receptor. From the computational analysis, we found that pY1180 and pY1241 favored the N2 site in the p85 N-SH2 for binding, though all other P-peptides favored the N1 site. There are two tyrosines, Tyr-1178 and Tyr-1243, just 63 amino acids apart from the pY1241 and pY1180, respectively. These tyrosines are also targets for phosphorylation and these P-peptides (pY1178 and pY1243) favored the N1 site for binding. The model structure of the cytoplasmic C-terminal region of the ErbB3 receptor indicates that the pair of phosphotyrosines, pY1178-pY1241 or pY1243-pY1180, will act for simultaneous binding of “double phosphotyrosines.” Actually, pY1180 and pY1243 have been recognized as Grb7 binding sites (53Fiddes R.J.

However, those phosphopeptides corresponding to Grb7 binding sites showed a slight rise in PI3K activity (14Carpenter C.L. Auger K.R. Chanudhuri M. Yoakim M. Schaffhausen B. Shoelson S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9478-9483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or an affinity for p85 (9Prigent S.A. Gullick W.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) in earlier studies, indicating that the non-pYXXM motif is also capable of binding to p85 SH2. Our SPR and computational analyses suggest that the amino acid sequence is not the sole determinant for specificity of the phosphotyrosyl peptide-SH2 interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2008897506,"Previously we used mass spectrometry to show that the yeast G protein α subunit Gpa1 is ubiquitinated at Lys-165, located within a subdomain not present in other Gα proteins (Marotti, L. A., Jr., Newitt, R., Wang, Y., Aebersold, R., and Dohlman, H. G. (2002) Biochemistry 41, 5067–5074). Here we describe the functional role of Gpa1 ubiquitination. We find that Gpa1 expression is elevated in mutants deficient in either proteasomal or vacuolar protease function. Vacuolar protease pep4 mutants accumulate monoubiquitinated Gpa1, and much of the protein is localized within the vacuolar compartment. In contrast, proteasome-defective rpt6/cim3 mutants accumulate polyubiquitinated Gpa1, and in this case the protein exhibits cytoplasmic localization. Cells that lack Ubp12 ubiquitin-processing protease activity accumulate both mono- and polyubiquitinated forms of Gpa1. In this case, Gpa1 accumulates in both the cytoplasm and vacuole. Finally, a Gpa1 mutant that lacks the ubiquitinated subdomain remains unmodified and is predominantly localized at the plasma membrane. These data reveal a strong relationship between the extent of ubiquitination and trafficking of the G protein α subunit to its site of degradation. Previously we used mass spectrometry to show that the yeast G protein α subunit Gpa1 is ubiquitinated at Lys-165, located within a subdomain not present in other Gα proteins (Marotti, L.

These data reveal a strong relationship between the extent of ubiquitination and trafficking of the G protein α subunit to its site of degradation. Many sensory and chemical stimuli act via cell surface receptors and intracellular G proteins. In yeast, G protein-coupled receptors initiate a signaling cascade that leads to morphological changes, new gene transcription, cell cycle arrest, and eventually, mating. Mating, the process by which a and α haploid cells fuse to form the a/α diploid, is initiated by cell type-specific peptide pheromones. Haploid a-type cells secrete a-factor pheromone, which binds to specific receptors found only on α-type cells, whereas α-type cells secrete α-factor that acts exclusively on a cells (1Dohlman H.G. Thorner J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 703-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Most components of the pheromone-signaling cascade in yeast have been identified through the isolation of gene mutations that produce an unresponsive sterile (ste) phenotype. Genes required for mating include the receptors for α-factor (STE2) and a-factor (STE3), the G protein β (STE4) and γ (STE18) subunits, G protein effectors (STE5, STE20, CDC24), and downstream protein kinases (STE20, STE11, STE7, FUS3, KSS1) as well as a transcription factor (STE12). The G protein α subunit serves primarily to regulate the levels of free Gβγ. Cells lacking the Gα subunit gene (GPA1) cannot sequester Gβγ and so are permanently activated (2Dietzel C. Kurjan J. Cell. 1987; 50: 1001-1010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 3Miyajima I. Nakafuku M. Nakayama N. Brenner C. Miyajima A. Kaibuchi K. Arai K. Kaziro Y. Matsumoto K. Cell. 1987; 50: 1011-1019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The Gα subunit can also modulate signaling indirectly through binding to the polyribosome-associated protein Scp160 (4Guo M. Aston C. Burchett S.A. Dyke C. Fields S. Rajarao S.J. Uetz P. Wang Y. Young K. Dohlman H.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 517-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). As with other G protein systems, pheromone binding to its receptor promotes the exchange of GTP for GDP on the Gα subunit followed by dissociation of Gα from the Gβγ subunit complex (5Dohlman H.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 129-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The dissociated subunits in turn transmit and amplify the signal to effector proteins that produce an intracellular response. Signaling persists until GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP and the subunits reassemble. Given their position as intermediaries between signal detectors (receptors) and signal transmitters (effectors), G proteins are well positioned to serve as targets of regulation. Particularly important in this role is the regulator of G protein signaling protein Sst2, which attenuates the pheromone signal by accelerating Gpa1 GTP hydrolysis and thereby reducing the lifetime of the activated G protein (6Dohlman H.G. Apaniesk D. Chen Y. Song J. Nusskern D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3635-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 7Apanovitch D.M. Slep K.C. Sigler P.B. Dohlman H.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4815-4822Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). There is growing evidence that G protein signaling components are also regulated by post-translational modifications (8Chen C.A. Manning D.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1643-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Recent attention has focused on ubiquitination, the process by which a ubiquitin polypeptide is covalently attached to specific target proteins (9Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2857) Google Scholar). Once a protein is ubiquitinated, ubiquitin can itself be ubiquitinated, resulting in the formation of a polyubiquitin chain. Polyubiquitinated substrates are then captured by the proteasome protease complex and rapidly degraded (10Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). Of the pheromone signaling components in yeast, ubiquitination has been reported for the Gα protein Gpa1 (11Marotti Jr., L.A. Newitt R. Wang Y. Aebersold R. Dohlman H.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5067-5074Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 12Madura K. Varshavsky A. Science. 1994; 265: 1454-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), the regulator of G protein signaling protein Sst2 (13Hao N. Yildirim N. Wang Y. Elston T.C. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46506-46515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and the effector kinase Ste7 (14Wang Y. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15766-15772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 15Wang Y. Ge Q. Houston D. Thorner J. Errede B. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22284-22289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination of both Ste7 and Sst2 are induced by pheromone, and these modifications are thought to represent feedback loops leading to pheromone desensitization and resensitization, respectively (13Hao N. Yildirim N. Wang Y. Elston T.C. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46506-46515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 14Wang Y. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 22284-22289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination has also been described for the pheromone receptors Ste2 and Ste3 (16Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 17Roth A.F. Davis N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 661-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, in this instance the proteins are monoubiquitinated instead of polyubiquitinated and degraded by the vacuole (the yeast counterpart to the lysosome) instead of by the proteasome (16Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 17Roth A.F. Davis N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 661-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 18Schandel K.A. Jenness D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7245-7255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Davis N.G. Horecka J.L. Sprague Jr., G.F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This discovery led to the hypothesis that ubiquitination is primarily a protein-trafficking signal, and monoubiquitination promotes degradation only by allowing the substrate to undergo internalization and delivery to the vacuole compartment (20Hicke L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). Recently we used mass spectrometry to identify the ubiquitination site of Gpa1 in vivo (11Marotti Jr., L.A. Newitt R. Wang Y. Aebersold R. Dohlman H.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5067-5074Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The site of modification (Lys-165) lies within the α-helical domain of the G protein and, more specifically, within a 110-residue subdomain not found in other Gα subunits. Here we show that the Gpa1 subdomain undergoes both mono- and polyubiquitination. Monoubiquitinated Gpa1 is targeted to the vacuole, whereas polyubiquitinated Gpa1 is delivered to the proteasome. These findings reveal that G protein trafficking can function independently of substrate targeting signals and, instead, depends solely on the extent of substrate ubiquitination. Strains and Plasmids—Standard methods for the growth, maintenance, and transformation of yeast and bacteria and for the manipulation of DNA were used throughout (21Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E.

Growth, Transcription, Degradation, and Ubiquitination Bioassays—The pheromone-dependent growth inhibition (halo) and reporter-transcription assays were conducted as described previously (26Hoffman G.

To monitor the loss of Gpa1, cultures were treated with cycloheximide (10 μg/ml in 0.1% ethanol, final concentrations) for up to 120 min, as described previously (28Garrison T.R. Zhang Y. Pausch M.

Cells (50 ml) co-transformed with plasmids pAD4M-GPA1 and pYES-UBP12-FLAG were grown to A600 nm ∼ 1, harvested, and resuspended in 550 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm NaPO4, pH 7.5, 400 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm NaF, 25 mm glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mmN-ethylmaleimide, 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and one pellet of complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). This and all subsequent manipulations were carried out at 4 °C. Cells were subjected to glass bead vortex homogenization for 30 s, repeated 8 times, and centrifuged twice at 6000 × g for 5 min and 25 min. Lysates were incubated for 2 h with a bead volume of 10 μl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin (Sigma) equilibrated in lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 30 s, and pellets were washed with 1 ml of lysis buffer for 3 min, repeated 4 times before final resuspension in 30 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Each sample was resolved by 7.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with anti-Gpa1 polyclonal antibodies at 1:1000 or anti-FLAG monoclonal antibodies at 1:2000. Microscopy Analysis—Cells expressing single-copy, integrated GFP-tagged gene fusions were visualized by differential interference contrast (DIC) and fluorescence microscopy using a Nikon eclipse E600EN, photographed with a Hamamatsu digital camera, and analyzed with MetaMorph Version 5.0 software. Many cellular proteins are polyubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome. However, a handful of proteins are instead monoubiquitinated and delivered to the vacuole. This alternative pathway was first documented for the yeast G protein-coupled receptors Ste2 and Ste3 (16Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 17Roth A.F. Davis N.G. J.

Both of these receptors are monoubiquitinated in response to prolonged treatment with pheromone, and once modified they are rapidly endocytosed and degraded within the vacuole compartment (16Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 17Roth A.F. Davis N.G. J.

Gpa1 is also monoubiquitinated (11Marotti Jr., L.A. Newitt R. Wang Y. Aebersold R. Dohlman H.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5067-5074Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 12Madura K. Varshavsky A. Science. 1994; 265: 1454-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), suggesting that this protein is likewise degraded by the vacuole. To test this supposition we examined the fate of Gpa1 in pep4 mutant cells, which lack vacuolar protease function (30Rothman J.H. Howald I. Stevens T.H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2057-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Pep4, also known as proteinase A, is a saccharopepsin aspartyl protease required for activation of degradative enzymes within the vacuole. Cell lysates from wild-type and pep4 mutant cells were resolved by gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting, and the abundance of Gpa1 was monitored using anti-Gpa1 antibodies. Gpa1 normally migrates as a doublet of 54 and 56 kDa (representing myristoylated and non-myristoylated species, respectively) (29Dohlman H.G. Goldsmith P. Spiegel A.M. Thorner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9688-9692Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 31Stone D.E. Cole G.M. de Barros Lopes M. Goebl M. Reed S.I. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1969-1981Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, steady state levels of Gpa1 were ∼2-fold higher in the vacuolar protease-deficient pep4 mutant strain. Expression of Ste4 (Gβ) was also elevated in these mutants. We then measured the abundance of the G protein α and β subunits in a temperature-sensitive cim3-1 mutant, which at the restrictive temperature has severely impaired proteasomal protease activity (22Ghislain M. Udvardy A. Mann C. Nature. 1993; 366: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Cim3 (also known as Rpt6) is a subunit of the proteasome 19 S regulatory particle, which confers specificity for ubiquitinated proteins for presentation to the proteasome proteolytic subunits (32Finley D. Tanaka K. Mann C. Feldmann H. Hochstrasser M. Vierstra R. Johnston S. Hampton R. Haber J. McCusker J. Silver P. Frontali L. Thorsness P. Varshavsky A. Byers B. Madura K. Reed S.I. Wolf D. Jentsch S. Sommer T. Baumeister W. Goldberg A. Fried V. Rubin D.M. Toh-e A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 244-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Gpa1 (but not Ste4) expression was enriched in the cim3-1 mutant, suggesting that the Gα protein can also be degraded by the proteasome (Fig. 1) (11Marotti Jr., L.A. Newitt R. Wang Y. Aebersold R. Dohlman H.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5067-5074Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that Gpa1 can be degraded either by the vacuole or the proteasome, whereas Ste4 is degraded primarily by the vacuole. Whereas degradation by the proteasome typically requires substrate polyubiquitination, vacuolar degradation of Ste2 is triggered by monoubiquitination (16Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). If Gpa1 is degraded by the vacuole, defects in this pathway should result in an accumulation of the monoubiquitinated form of the protein. Conversely, if Gpa1 is degraded by the proteasome, defects in that pathway should result in an accumulation of polyubiquitinated Gpa1. To test this we overexpressed Gpa1 in mutant strains deficient in either vacuolar protease or proteasome activity. Overexpression was necessary for this experiment in order to detect the minor ubiquitinated species. In wild-type cells, Gpa1 migrated at 54 and 56 kDa (Fig. 2). In the vacuolar-protease-deficient pep4Δ strain an additional monoubiquitinated species migrated near 63 kDa (Fig. 2A) (11Marotti Jr., L.A. Newitt R. Wang Y. Aebersold R. Dohlman H.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5067-5074Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 12Madura K. Varshavsky A. Science. 1994; 265: 1454-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In contrast, the proteasome-deficient cim3-1 strain accumulated a ladder of high molecular weight bands representing polyubiquitinated Gpa1 (Fig. 2B) (11Marotti Jr., L.A. Newitt R. Wang Y. Aebersold R. Dohlman H.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5067-5074Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 12Madura K. Varshavsky A. Science. 1994; 265: 1454-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). These results support the suggestion that Gpa1 is degraded by two routes; one entails monoubiquitination and delivery to the vacuole, whereas the second requires polyubiquitination and delivery to the proteasome. The vacuolar degradation pathway is used by the pheromone receptor and, as shown here, by the G protein α subunit Gpa1. Monoubiquitination of the receptor is enhanced by pheromone. Because the receptor and G protein bind to one another, we investigated whether monoubiquitination and/or degradation of both substrates occur in a coordinated manner. We first examined whether monoubiquitination of Gpa1 was affected by prolonged exposure to pheromone and consistently found no difference (data not shown) (11Marotti Jr., L.A. Newitt R. Wang Y. Aebersold R. Dohlman H.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5067-5074Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Second, we tested whether monoubiquitination of Gpa1 was affected by deletion of the receptor gene STE2 and again found no difference (compare pep4Δ and ste2Δ/pep4Δ mutants, Fig. 2, A and C). These data indicate that Gpa1 monoubiquitination as well as vacuolar sorting occurs independently of receptor binding or pheromone occupancy. It was shown previously that the pheromone receptor accumulates in the vacuole of cells deficient in vacuolar protease activity (16Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 18Schandel K.A. Jenness D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7245-7255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether Gpa1 is likewise delivered to the vacuole we compared the distribution of the protein (expressed as a chromosomally integrated GFP fusion) in wild-type and pep4Δ mutant strains. As shown in Fig. 3, Gpa1 in wild-type cells was detected at the plasma membrane. In contrast, Gpa1 in the pep4Δ mutant was visible at the plasma membrane and also within the large vacuolar compartment, which is easily identified as the most prominent organelle within the cell. Taken together these data indicate that Gpa1, like Ste2, is monoubiquitinated and degraded by the vacuole. Whereas the receptor is delivered to the vacuole upon pheromone stimulation, the G protein is delivered in a constitutive or pheromone-independent manner. Most cytoplasmic proteins are polyubiquitinated and delivered to the proteasome complex. Thus, we anticipated that polyubiquitinated Gpa1 would not be targeted to the vacuole. To test this prediction we examined the subcellular distribution of Gpa1-GFP in the proteasome-defective cim3-1 mutant strain, which accumulates the polyubiquitinated form of the substrate. As shown in Fig. 3, Gpa1 in the cim3-1 mutant was predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and, in contrast to pep4Δ, was largely excluded from the vacuole. We presume that the cytoplasmic staining represents Gpa1 associated with or en route to the proteasome complex. Taken together these data suggest that Gpa1 is delivered to the proteasome when polyubiquitinated but not when monoubiquitinated. Conversely, Gpa1 is delivered to the vacuole when monoubiquitinated but not when polyubiquitinated. To further corroborate these results, we asked whether expression of both the mono- and polyubiquitinated forms of Gpa1 might direct the protein to both the vacuolar compartment and the cytoplasm. To this end we used two methods in combination, one to stabilize the monoubiquitinated form of Gpa1 and a second designed to stabilize the polyubiquitinated form of the protein. The first approach was to overexpress Myc-tagged ubiquitin through the use of a copper inducible promoter (from CUP1). Myc-ubiquitinated substrates are degraded more slowly and, therefore, can be detected more easily in vivo (33Ellison M.J. Hochstrasser M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21150-21157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Copper-induction of Myc-ubiquitin promoted the accumulation of monoubiquitinated Gpa1, as shown previously (11Marotti Jr., L.A. Newitt R. Wang Y. Aebersold R. Dohlman H.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5067-5074Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 12Madura K. Varshavsky A. Science. 1994; 265: 1454-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). The second approach was to delete the ubiquitin-specific processing protease (UBP) that removes ubiquitin from Gpa1. This approach is similar to one used in our earlier analysis of the effector kinase Ste7 (14Wang Y. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15766-15772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 15Wang Y. Ge Q. Houston D. Thorner J. Errede B. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22284-22289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). By screening mutants that lack each of 16 ubiquitin-processing proteases (or UBPs) we had found one (ubp3Δ) that resulted in the accumulation of polyubiquitinated Ste7. We conducted a similar screen of the UBP deletion mutants and found another, ubp12Δ, that specifically accumulated ubiquitinated Gpa1 (Fig. 4A and data not shown). Moreover, immunoprecipitation of Ubp12 resulted in the co-purification of Gpa1, further suggesting that Gpa1 ubiquitination is regulated directly by Ubp12 (Fig. 4B). By overexpressing Myc-ubiquitin in a ubp12Δ strain, we could achieve an increase in both mono- and polyubiquitinated forms of Gpa1 (Fig. 4A, fourth lane). We then asked how mono- and polyubiquitination affects Gpa1 localization. To this end we examined the subcellular distribution of Gpa1-GFP in ubp12Δ mutant cells after induction of Myc-ubiquitin. Whereas Gpa1 is normally localized at the plasma membrane, overexpression of Myc-ubiquitin in the ubp12Δ strain led to a redistribution of Gpa1 to the vacuolar compartment as well as to the cytoplasm (Fig. 5). Thus, under conditions where Gpa1 is polyubiquitinated and monoubiquitinated in the same cell, the protein is directed to both the vacuolar compartment and the cytoplasm. Stated differently, the distribution of Gpa1 in this case is an amalgamation of the distribution seen in pep4Δ and cim3-1 cells. We then wished to determine the fate of Gpa1 that is not ubiquitinated. Initially we examined the localization of Gpa1K165R, which lacks the primary site of in vivo ubiquitination (11Marotti"
https://openalex.org/W2057685763,"EVI1 is an oncogene frequently associated with chronic and acute myeloid leukemia. In hematopoietic cells, EVI1 impairs several pathways including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Interferon-α (IFN-α) is a powerful cytokine that controls the immune response and limits the expansion of several tissues including bone marrow. These properties contribute to the effectiveness of IFN-α in the treatment of many neoplastic disorders especially chronic myeloid leukemia. We report here that in murine hematopoietic progenitors the expression of EVI1 completely abrogates the antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of IFN-α. EVI1 does not repress the JAK/STAT signaling pathway or the activation of many IFN-responsive genes. On the contrary, EVI1 prolongs the phosphorylation of STAT1 and the activation of an IFN-dependent reporter gene. However, EVI1 specifically represses the IFN-dependent induction of the tumor suppressor PML and blocks the apoptotic pathways activated by PML. We show that the position of the ISRE, which is located within the first exon of PML, is critical to block PML induction by IFN-α. The relocation of the ISRE to a position upstream of the transcription start site is sufficient to re-establish the response to IFN in the presence of EVI1. Our data suggest that stabilized STAT1 phosphorylation and prolonged binding of the STAT1 complex to the first exon could impair PML transcription and inhibit the activation of PML-dependent apoptotic pathways resulting in loss of IFN response. These results point to a novel mechanism utilized by an oncogene to escape normal cell response to growth-controlling cytokines.

This form is independently regulated and transcribed from an upstream promoter and has not been associated with neoplastic transformation (9Nucifora G. Begy C.R. Kobayashi H. Roulston D. Claxton D.

EVI1 is a nuclear transcription repressor with 2 domains of 7 and 3 zinc finger motifs that bind to DNA in vitro (4Buonamici S. Chakraborty S. Senyuk V. Nucifora G. Blood Cells Mol.

These diverse properties are mediated through binding to a high affinity cell surface receptor that in turn activates a variety of intracellular signals and modulates gene expression and apoptosis (27Thyrell L.

In a very simplified view, IFN-α binds to the Type I IFN membrane receptor inducing its dimerization and the activation of two Janus family tyrosine kinases, TYK-2 and JAK-1, which leads to activation and homo- or heterodimerization of the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins (most frequently STAT1 and STAT2 for the IFN-α pathway). The activated STAT1-STAT2 dimer interacts with p48 to form the mature ISGF3 complex that translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) by binding to the IFN-α-stimulated response elements (ISRE) in their promoter (27Thyrell L.

The activation of the IFN-α pathway leads to the expression of literally hundreds of ISGs, many of which are activated in a tissue-specific fashion. The tumor suppressor PML and several components of the PML bodies, including SP100, are up-regulated by IFN-α in almost all cell types (31Borden K.L. Mol. Cell.

The direct role of PML in growth arrest and apoptosis induced by IFN-α was later confirmed by showing that cells with biallelic inactivation of Pml are unresponsive to IFN-α (34Wang Z.G. Ruggero D. Ronchetti S. Zhong S. Gaboli M. Rivi R. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In general, the gene-activating effects of IFN-α last about 5 h (29Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3330) Google Scholar, 36Bluyssen H.A. Levy D.E. J. Biol.

The mechanisms that regulate the inactivation of the ISGF3 complex are less clear. Several phosphatases have been implicated in this process but as yet no single enzyme has been clearly demonstrated to be universally involved in part because many of these enzymes seem to be cell type-specific (39Starr R. Hilton D.J. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 40Shuai K. Liu B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 900-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Here we have examined the role of EVI1 in the IFN-α response and found that EVI1 blocks the inhibitory effect of IFN-α in normal murine bone marrow (BM) cells and cell lines. EVI1 does not affect the signaling pathway of IFN-α or the assembly of the activated ISGF3 complex, which efficiently binds to the DNA in cells that express EVI1. The expression of many ISGs we tested is not altered by EVI1 and we find, rather surprisingly, that in the presence of EVI1 the phosphorylation of STAT1 and the consequent activation of an IFN-responsive reporter gene are actually and significantly prolonged. However, we also find that among all the IFN-responsive genes we tested, only Pml is not induced above basal level as expected when EVI1 is expressed and, as a consequence, we find that Pml-depending apoptotic pathways are not activated. A difference between the PML promoter and those of other IFN-responsive genes is the position of the ISRE, which in PML occurs uniquely within the first exon (33Grotzinger T. Sternsdorf T. Jensen K. Will H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Mutation analyses of the PML promoter and that of an IFN-responsive gene unaffected by EVI1 confirm that the position of the ISRE is critical to the abrogation of the IFN response by EVI1. We conclude that EVI1 inhibits the IFN response by selectively repressing proapoptotic genes that, like PML, contain the ISRE in their transcribed sequence. Our data point at a novel mechanism that is exploited by oncogenes to escape cytokine-dependent control of cell proliferation. DNA Constructs—The plasmid FLAG-EVI1 used in reporter gene assays has been previously described (22Chakraborty S. Senyuk V. Sitailo S. Chi Y. Nucifora G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44936-44943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). HA-EVI1 was cloned in the EcoRI and BamHI restriction site of the MSCV vector (Clontech, San Jose, CA). The human WT ISG15 promoter from nucleotide -121 to +21 was amplified by genomic PCR and cloned in the HindIII and XhoI restriction sites of the promoterless luciferase reporter pGL3-basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The mutant ISG15 promoter ISRE was constructed by PCR of genomic DNA with a 5′ primer that starts at nucleotide -86 of the normal promoter and a 3′ primer that anneals to nucleotide +21 and contains an extension identical to the region -121 to -86 that spans the ISRE of the WT ISG15 promoter. The sequence of the 3′ extension is -121CATGCCTCGGGAAAGGGAAACCGAAACTGAAGCCAA-86, where the ISG15 ISRE consensus site is indicated in bold. Therefore this mutant promoter is identical to the WT promoter but the ISRE and flanking nucleotides have been repositioned from nucleotides -121 to -86 to nucleotides +21 to +56. After cloning, the WT and mutant ISG15 promoters were sequenced. The human WT PML promoter was constructed with the same strategy using genomic PCR from nucleotide -157 to nucleotide +58. The fragment was cloned in the HindIII and XhoI restriction sites of pGL3-basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). PML-ISRE mutant promoter was constructed by PCR with a 5′ primer containing the extension +31ATCTAAACCGAGAATCGAAACTAAGCTG+58 in which the PML ISRE consensus site is indicated in bold. Both plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture and Murine BM Progenitors Culture—The maintenance, transfection, and culture of the retroviral producer cell line Phoenix (ATCC) have been reported (22Chakraborty S. Senyuk V. Sitailo S.

The infection, selection, culture, and differentiation of murine BM progenitors infected with the empty MSCV retrovirus or MSCV-HA-EVI1 were carried out as described (41Senyuk V. Chakraborty S. Mikhail F.M. Zhao R. Chi Y. Nucifora G. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3232-3240Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). EVI1-expressing SiHa stable lines were generated by calcium phosphate transfection with either the pCMV vector (vector-SiHa) or pCMV-Flag-EVI1 (EVI1-SiHa) and selection with neomycin. For reporter gene assays, cell lines were transfected with the appropriate reporter gene and either the vector pCMV or pCMV-Flag-EVI1 and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). RNA Isolation and cDNA Preparation—Total cellular RNA was extracted as described (42Buonamici S. Ottaviani E. Testoni N. Montefusco V. Visani G. Bonifazi F. Amabile M. Terragna C. Ruggeri D. Piccaluga P.P. Isidori A. Malagola M. Baccarani M. Tura S. Martinelli G. Blood. 2002; 99: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). cDNA was prepared according to the First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit protocol (MBI Fermentas, Hanover, MD). Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR and Reverse Quantitative (RQ)-PCR—RT-PCR for the evaluation of the IFN response genes was performed with the RT-PCR Profiling Kit (SuperArray Bioscience Corp., Frederick, MD) following the instructions of the manufacturer reported in the Human Interferon Response MultiGene-12™ manual. For amplification of ISG15, ISG54, PML, and IRF1 we used 2 μl of reverse transcription reaction for PCR with the following primers: ISG15 (forward, ggctgggagctgacggtgaag, reverse, GCTCCGCCCGCCAGGCTCTGT), ISG54 (forward, TGCCGAACAGCTGAGAATTG, reverse, ATTCCAGGGCTGCCTCGTTTT), IRF1 (forward, GGACATCAACAAGGATGCC, reverse, TCTTGGTGAGAGGTGGAAGC), and PML (forward, GCGCACCGATGGCTTCGACGA, reverse, CGGGCAGGTCAACGTCAAT). RQ-PCR was performed in a 25-μl reaction containing 5 μl of diluted cDNA, 12.5 μl of the Platinum Quantitative PCR SuperMix-UDG (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 300 nm forward and reverse primers, and 150 nm TaqMan probe (42Buonamici S. Ottaviani E. Testoni N. Montefusco V. Visani G. Bonifazi F. Amabile M. Terragna C. Ruggeri D. Piccaluga P.P. Isidori A. Malagola M. Baccarani M. Tura S. Martinelli G. Blood. 2002; 99: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The primers and probes for murine GAPDH were purchased (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA). The primers and probe used for murine Pml were: forward, AACCCTGCGCTGACTGACAT, and reverse, GTGCCTAGTTCCTCATGCCACT; the probe was CAACCACAGCCATCTCCATTGCGA. The probe was labeled by a 5′ FAM reporter and a 3′ TAMRA quencher. The primers and probe were designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA). RQ-PCR amplification was performed on the iCycler iQ detection system (Bio-Rad), and the data were collected and analyzed using iCycler iQ version 3.1 software. Apoptosis Gene Expression Profiling System—The human cDNA expression array GEArray™ Q Apoptosis (SuperArray Bioscience Corp., Frederick, MD) was used for the evaluation of 96 genes with known apoptotic function. The experiment was performed according to the manufacturer's protocols. Western Blot and Northern Blot Analyses—Cell lysate of mouse hematopoietic progenitors infected either with MSCV empty vector or MSCV-HA-EVI1 were quantified and Western blot analyses were performed as described (43Li Y. Sassano A. Majchrzak B. Deb D.K. Levy D.E. Gaestel M. Nebreda A.R. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 970-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Ten μg of total RNA isolated from vector- or EVI1-SiHa cells was used to perform the Northern blot assay as reported (19Sitailo S. Sood R. Barton K. Nucifora G. Leukemia. 1999; 13: 1639-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—Fifteen μg of nuclear extract of vector- or EVI1-SiHa cells were incubated at room temperature for 30 min with 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe containing the ISG15 or PML ISRE-binding sites. The samples were separated by electrophoresis on a 0.5 m Tris-borate-EDTA nondenaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel at 140 V for 2 h and autoradiographed overnight as described (33Grotzinger T. Sternsdorf T. Jensen K. Will H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Reporter Gene Studies—The reporter gene assays were performed as reported (41Senyuk V. Chakraborty S. Mikhail F.M. Zhao R. Chi Y. Nucifora G. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3232-3240Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence—The vector- or EVI1-hematopoietic BM cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min. The cell membrane was permeabilized by treatment with 50% methanol and 50% acetone at -20 °C for 7 min. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and nonspecific antibody binding was blocked with 5% normal bovine serum (Sigma). The cells were treated with goat polyclonal anti-PML antibody (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA) at a dilution 1:1000 for 1 h. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were stained with donkey anti-goat Alexa Fluor® 594 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at a dilution 1:5000 for 1 h. The cells were washed, stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and treated with a prolonged anti-fading medium (Molecular Probes). The proteins were visualized with immunofluorescence microscopy (Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY). ELISA—The ELISA to evaluate the STAT1 phosphorylation was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol TransAM (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). EVI1 Abrogates IFN-α Growth Suppression in Normal Murine BM Lineage-negative Cells—To determine whether the expression of EVI1 affects the response of primary cells to IFN-α, we used normal murine BM cells because they are highly sensitive to IFN-α and undergo growth arrest and apoptosis when cultured with this cytokine. After isolation of the BM from healthy 5-week-old mice, lineage-negative progenitors were selected and infected with recombinant retroviruses expressing EVI1 or with the empty vector by spinoculation as we described (41Senyuk V. Chakraborty S. Mikhail F.M. Zhao R. Chi Y. Nucifora G. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3232-3240Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To eliminate non-infected cells, 150,000 cells were plated in methylcellulose-based medium and cultured with G418 (41Senyuk V. Chakraborty S. Mikhail F.M. Zhao R. Chi Y. Nucifora G. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3232-3240Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). After 7 days of culture, several colonies were clearly visible in each plate. The colonies were isolated from the methylcellulose, disaggregated, and 15,000 cells were plated in duplicate in the absence or presence of IFN-α. EVI1 is a protein with an apparent mass of about 145 kDa. The diagram of EVI1 and the expression of the protein in the BM cells are shown in Fig. 1, A and B. In the absence of IFN-α, the BM cells proliferated and produced colonies. As we also reported earlier (8Buonamici S. Li D. Chi Y. Zhao R. Wang X. Brace L. Ni H. Saunthararajah Y. Nucifora G. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), EVI1-positive BM progenitors have a much higher plating efficiency and generate about 2 times more colonies than the control progenitor cells (Table I). The most striking difference between vector and EVI1 cells was observed when the BM cells were cultured with IFN-α. As expected, the vector BM cells formed very small and sparse colonies when they were cultured with IFN-α and the cells did not survive after 7 days of culture. In contrast, EVI1-positive cells were completely unresponsive to IFN-α and the number of the colonies was not statistically different in the presence or absence of the cytokine (Table I).Fig. 1EVI1 does not prevent ISGF3 activation and DNA binding in response to IFN-α. A, diagram of EVI1. The 2 zinc finger (Zn) domains are indicated by gray lines. B, expression of EVI1 in BM cells. Lane 1, vector-infected BM cells. Lane 2, EVI1-infected BM cells. The asterisks indicate nonspecific hybridization bands. C, EVI1 does not inhibit the JAK/STAT1 pathway in response to IFN-α. Normal BM mouse progenitors infected either with empty vector or the EVI1-expressing retrovirus were incubated in the presence or absence of IFN-α (10,000 units/ml) for 25 min. Total cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and analyzed with an antibody specific for the phosphorylated tyrosine 701 of STAT1 (upper panel). The blots were stripped and re-probed with an anti-STAT1 antibody to control the protein loading (lower panel). D, the DNA binding activity of ISGF3 in EVI1-positive cells is evaluated by EMSA. The binding assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” with nuclear extracts of vector-SiHa (lanes 1 and 2) or EVI1-SiHa (lanes 3 and 4) cells in the presence (lanes 2 and 4) or absence of IFN-α (5,000 units/ml) (lanes 1 and 3) for 30 min. An ISGF3-DNA complex band (indicated by the arrow, lanes 2 and 4) is observed in cells treated with IFN-α. Free probe is shown in lane 5. E, Western blot analyses of vector- and EVI1-SiHa cells confirmed the expression of EVI1 (upper panel) and STAT1 (lower panel) in the cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table INumber of colonies after 7 days of cultureNumber of coloniesVector cellsEVI1 cellsIFN-α-+-+Experiment 115020376380Experiment 214318365367Experiment 315713386390 Open table in a new tab EVI1 Does Not Affect the JAK/STAT Pathway of the DNA Binding of the ISGF3 Complex—Our studies indicate that EVI1 expression in mouse BM cells abrogates the antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of IFN-α. Therefore, we determined whether this effect is because of down-regulation of the IFN-activated JAK/STAT pathway. The phosphorylation of STAT1 on tyrosine 701 is a critical early step required for interaction with STAT2 and translocation to the nucleus (26Pestka S. Langer J.A. Zoon K.C. Samuel C.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 727-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar, 27Thyrell L. Erickson S. Zhivotovsky B. Pokrovskaja K. Sangfelt O. Castro J. Einhorn S. Grander D.

To determine whether tyrosine 701 phosphorylation is affected in normal mouse BM cells expressing EVI1, mouse progenitor cells infected either with empty retroviral vector or EVI1 retrovirus were treated with IFN-α. Total cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an antibody that recognizes STAT1 phosphorylation on tyrosine 701. Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 was inducible in the murine progenitors independently of whether EVI1 was expressed (Fig. 1C). To determine whether EVI1 affects the DNA binding of ISGF3 to the ISRE consensus we carried out EMSA with a DNA probe corresponding to the ISRE sequence of ISG15 (33Grotzinger T. Sternsdorf T. Jensen K. Will H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) using the nuclear extract of human SiHa cells stably transfected either with empty retrovirus (vector-SiHa) or EVI1 retrovirus (EVI1-SiHa). We chose the ISRE of the ISG15 promoter because this sequence is routinely used as probe for this type of assay (33Grotzinger T. Sternsdorf T. Jensen K. Will H. Eur. J.

After PMI40 deletion (pmi-) the cells were viable only if fed with extracellular mannose and glucose. In an attempt to force the GDP-mannose synthesis in the pmi- strain by increasing the extracellular mannose concentrations, the cells showed significantly reduced growth rates without any alterations in the intracellular GDP-mannose levels.

In the eukaryotic model organism, yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, phosphomannose isomerase is encoded by the PMI40 gene (1Smith D.J. Proudfoot A. Friedli L. Klig L.S. Paravicini G. Payton M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2924-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In a PMI40 deletion strain (pmi-), the synthesis of Man-6-P from Fru-6-P is not possible, disabling the growth of such a strain on medium without mannose. The inability to grow, caused by defective glycosylation of a temperature-sensitive pmi40 mutant of S. cerevisiae, and repairing the defects by addition of mannose to the growth medium have been described previously (2Payton M.A. Rheinnecker M. Klig L.S. DeTiani M. Bowden E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2006-2010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In humans PMIe deficiency is the cause of carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome type Ib, but the condition can be successfully treated by mannose administration (3Niehues R. Hasilik M. Alton G. Korner C. Schiebe-Sukumar M. Koch H.G. Zimmer K.P. Wu R. Harms E. Reiter K. von Figura K. Freeze H.H. Harms H.K. Marquardt T. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1414-1420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Man-6-P produced either from Fru-6-P or mannose serves as a precursor for the de novo biosynthesis of GDP-mannose. Man-6-P is converted to mannose 1-phosphate (Man-1-P) by phosphomannomutase encoded by SEC53. Subsequently, Man-1-P is ligated with the guanosine 5-triphosphate molecule (GTP) to form GDP-mannose by Man-1-P guanylyltransferase encoded by PSA1 (4Berg J.M. Tymoczko J.L. Stryer L. Biochemistry. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York2002Google Scholar). The de novo formation of the purine ring of GTP, required for the biosynthesis of GDP-mannose, starts from ribose 5-phosphate in the pentose phosphate pathway and requires also 3-phosphoglycerate in the glycolysis as a precursor. Taken together, the biosynthesis of GTP is more complex than the mannose pathway (4Berg J.M. Tymoczko J.L. Stryer L. Biochemistry. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York2002Google Scholar). GDP-mannose is needed in S. cerevisiae for mannosylation of various structures such as lipopolysaccharides and glycoproteins (4Berg J.M. Tymoczko J.L. Stryer L. Biochemistry. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York2002Google Scholar). Additionally, GDP-mannose is necessary as a precursor for other sugar nucleotides including GDP-fucose and GDP-rhamnose (5Järvinen N. Mäki M. Räbinä J.

In S. cerevisiae GDP-mannose biosynthesis, as nucleotide sugar biosynthesis generally, is carried out in the cytosol (8Gao X.D. Nishikawa A. Dean N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4424-4432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Hypothetically, a strain lacking the gene for PMIe would direct all its mannose into the biosynthesis of GDP-mannose. We applied novel measurement techniques to study the synthesis of GDP-mannose and main metabolic pathways in a S. cerevisiae pmi- strain. Samples taken from carefully controlled bioreactor cultivations at different mannose concentrations were analyzed using genome-wide transcription profiling, analysis of selected enzyme activities, and analysis of selected intracellular metabolite concentrations. In this study we demonstrated that in batch cultivation increasing amounts of initial mannose inhibit the growth of the pmi- strain but not that of the control strain. We postulate the mechanisms leading to the growth inhibition and demonstrate the effects it causes. Yeast Strains—A genetically modified S. cerevisiae yeast strain with PMI40 knock-out (MATa URA3 TRP1 LEU2 his3-Δ1 MAL2-8C SUC2 PMI40::HIS3) was constructed as follows. Most of the reading frame (nucleotides 147-1233) of the PMI40 gene was PCR-amplified from S. cerevisiae chromosomal DNA and subsequently cloned into XhoI/XbaI sites of vector pRS403 (Stratagene). HIS3 gene with its regulatory regions was amplified by PCR from pRS403 with primers (5′ggaattc-CGTTTCGGTGATGACGGTGAAA3′ and 5′ggaattcTTCCTGATGCGGTATTTTCTCCT3′) and cloned into the unique restriction site of EcoRI in PMI40 (nucleotide 681 in CDS). Digestion of the resulting construct with EcoRV and BamHI (nucleotides 207 and 384, respectively) released a 2400-bp fragment with PMI40-specific tails. This DNA construct was transformed to the S. cerevisiae strain CEN.PK113-7A (MATa URA3 TRP1 LEU2 his3-Δ1 MAL2-8C SUC2) (9Entian K.D. Kötter P. Brown J.P. Tuite M.F. Methods in Microbiology. 26.

Microbiol. 1996; 20: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The cells were plated on selective medium (HIS) with 5 g/liter mannose and 20 g/liter glucose. The control strain CEN.PK113-7D (MATa URA3 TRP1 LEU2 HIS3 MAL2-8C SUC2) was obtained from Euroscarf (Frankfurt, Germany) (9Entian K.D. Kötter P. Brown J.P. Tuite M.F. Methods in Microbiology. 26. Academic Press Ltd., San Diego1998: 431-449Google Scholar). Bioreactor Cultivations—The inocula for bioreactor cultivations were grown in 250-ml Erlenmeyer shake flasks on YPDM-medium containing 10 g/liter yeast extract, 20 g/liter peptone (International Diagnostics Group, Lancashire, UK), 20 g/liter d-glucose (BDH Laboratory Supplies, Poole, UK), and 1 g/liter d-mannose (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland). The inocula were started from 20 mg cell dry weight (CDW) of cells in glycerol stocks. The inocula were incubated at +30 °C for 16 h (Heraeus Heracool 40, Kendro Laboratory Products, Asheville, NC) with agitation speed 200 rpm (model C2, New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, NJ). Roughly, 0.5 g CDW of cells in 0.9% NaCl were used to inoculate the bioreactor cultivations. Bioreactor cultivations were performed in 3.2-liter Braun Biostat CT2-DCU 3 instruments (B. Braun Biotech International GmbH, Meisungen, Germany). The cultivation temperature was +30 °C, agitation speed 1000 rpm, initial cultivation volume 2.0 liters, airflow 1.0 liters/min, and pH 5.0.

Yeast. 1992; 8: 501-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar) was used for the bioreactor cultivations consisting of 5 g/liter (NH4)2SO4 (Sigma-Aldrich), 3 g/liter KH2PO4 (Fluka) and 0.5 g/liter MgSO4·7 H2O (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 ml/liter trace element, and 1 ml/liter vitamin solution (11Verduyn C. Postma E. Scheffers W.A. Van Dijken J.P. Yeast. 1992; 8: 501-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). d-Glucose and d-mannose concentrations are described under “Results.” Dissolved sugars, trace element, and vitamin solutions were sterile filtered (Bottle Top Filter, 0.45-μm Cellulose Acetate, Corning, Corning, NY). The remaining media components including 0.25 ml/liter silicone antifoam agent (BDH Laboratory Supplies) were sterilized in the fermentor. Measurement of Cell Density and Extracellular Metabolites—Samples of 20 ml were taken at two-hour intervals during the exponential phase. Optical density at 600 nm was measured with a BioPhotometer (Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany). For CDW measurements a 10-ml sample was filtered using a preweighed membrane (pore size 0.45 μm, Schleicher & Schuell), washed, dried, and reweighed. Supernatants (centrifuged 4500 × g, 0 °C, 5 min) of samples were analyzed with high pressure liquid chromatography (Alliance 2695 separation module, Waters, Milford, MA) for the acetate, ethanol, glycerol, glucose, and mannose concentrations using an Aminex column (HPX-87H, Bio-Rad) and a Waters 2414 refractive index detector. The molar fractions of O2, CO2, N2, and Ar in the fermenter outlet gas were measured in-line employing a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Prisma Omnistar GSD 300 O, Pfeiffer Vacuum Technology AG, Asslar, Germany). Measurement of Gene Expression Levels—For the measurement of gene expression levels, 0.9 mg CDW of cells were quenched in cold (-40 °C) methanol (45%) and centrifuged (16100 G, +4 °C, 1 min). The total RNA was purified from cell homogenates using the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After this step the double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 15 μg of total RNA with the SuperScript double-stranded cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen) using a T7-oligo(dT) primer. Biotin-labeled cRNA was then synthesized employing an Enzo High Yield RNA transcript labeling kit (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY). The biotin-labeled cRNA was heat-fragmented, and biotinylated cRNAs were hybridized to Affymetrix YG-S98 microarrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). All assays were made in triplicate. Raw signal intensities in each microarray were normalized to chip median intensities. Each individual expression profile (15 data points) was further normalized to its median. Profiles in which the target was not detected (p < 0.04 in Affymetrix MicroArray Suite, version 5.0) in at least 10 samples were discarded from further analysis. Analysis of in Vitro Enzyme Activities—For the measurement of in vitro enzyme activities cell lysates of 20 mg CDW of cells were prepared in 100 mm TEA-buffer with glass bead disruption. Activities of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglucose isomerase (PGIe), phosphomannose isomerase, phosphofructokinase (PFKe), transaldolase, pyruvate kinase (PYKe), and isocitrate dehydrogenase were determined (12Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. John Wiley & Sons, New York1983Google Scholar). The protein amount was measured using the Bradford method (13Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215608) Google Scholar) (Bio-Rad protein assay). Protein amounts and enzyme activities were measured with the Cobas Mira plus autoanalyzer (Abx diagnostics, Montpellier, France). Measurement of Intracellular Metabolite Levels—To obtain samples for the measurement of intracellular metabolites, 20 mg CDW of cells were quenched in cold (-40 °C) methanol (45%) and centrifuged (3000 × g, -5 °C, 5 min) (14de Koning W. van Dam K. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 204: 118-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The samples were extracted with boiling ethanol (15Gonzalez B. Francois J. Renaud M. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1347-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), and the remaining supernatants, containing the metabolite fraction, were dried (SPD Speed Vac, Thermo Savant, Waltham, MA) and dissolved into MQ water. The samples were quantified using an anion exchange liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy/mass spectroscopy method (16van Dam J.C. Eman M.R. Frank J. Lange H.C. van Dedem G.W.K. Heijnen S.J. Anal. Chim. Acta. 2002; 460: 209-218Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Dionex IonPac AS11 (2 × 250 mm) anion exchange column and AG11 (2 × 50 mm) pre-column (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) were used for separation with a 3-150 mm NaOH gradient (16van Dam J.C. Eman M.R. Frank J. Lange H.C. van Dedem G.W.K. Heijnen S.J. Anal. Chim. Acta. 2002; 460: 209-218Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar) (Alliance 2695 separations module). A triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Quattro Micro, Micromass, Manchester, UK) was used for the detection (16van Dam J.C. Eman M.R. Frank J. Lange H.C. van Dedem G.W.K. Heijnen S.J. Anal. Chim. Acta. 2002; 460: 209-218Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar) of the following metabolites, the sum of hexose 1-phosphates, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-1,6-P), dihydroxyacetone phosphate, glycerol 3-phosphate, the sum of 3- and 2-phosphoglycerate, phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate, the sum of citrate and isocitrate (CIT/ICIT), α-ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, malate, oxaloacetate, glyoxylate, ribose 5-phosphate, trehalose 6-phosphate, UDP-glucose, trehalose, and GDP-mannose. Furthermore, concentrations of glucose 6-phosphate (Glu-6-P), Fru-6-P, Man-6-P, and glucose 1-phosphate were measured enzymatically (12Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. John Wiley & Sons, New York1983Google Scholar) with the Cobas Mira plus autoanalyzer (Abx diagnostics). Statistical Analysis—To find correlations and clusters in the gene transcripts, enzyme activities, and metabolite concentrations, all data were analyzed with the following three methods. First, quality clustering in GeneSpring (version 6.2, Silicon Genetics, Redwood, CA) was used to identify groups of strongly correlating transcripts, enzyme activities, and metabolites. The minimum Pearson's correlation between any two members of the same cluster was set at 0.9, and the minimum cluster size was set at 50. Second, positive and negative correlations of the expression, activity, and concentration data with the selected gene, enzyme, and metabolite profiles were searched using Pearson's correlation coefficient with a threshold value of 0.99 for significant correlation. Third, analysis of variance was used to identify the genes that were most significantly affected by the initial mannose concentration. The variances were assumed equal, and the Westfall-Young permutation was used to correct for multiple testing. The threshold value for the familywise error rate was set at 0.1. To classify the genes after analysis of variance according to their behavior, they were clustered hierarchically using Spearman's correlation as the distance metric. The statistical enrichment of gene ontology (GO) classes in the sets of genes obtained with the three methods described above was determined using the GO term finder at the Saccharomyces genome database website. The phosphomannose isomerase (PMI40) deletion strain, here called the pmi- strain, and a wild type control strain were cultivated in carefully controlled batch cultivations using a bioreactor. The initial glucose concentration was 15 g/liter in all cultivations, whereas the initial mannose concentration varied. The pmi- strain was cultivated on 0.75, 1, 1.5, 3, and 5 g/liter mannose and the control strain on 0.75 and 5 g/liter mannose. As shown in Table I, the specific growth rate (h-1) of the pmi- strain decreased as the initial mannose concentration increased. The negative effect of mannose in growth could not be seen with the control strain as the growth rates of the control strain on both 0.75 or 5 g/liter mannose were higher than that of the pmi- strain on 0.75 g/liter mannose. Because the growth of the control strain was seemingly unaffected by the initial mannose concentration, this study focuses mainly on presenting the effects of mannose in the pmi- strain. In addition to the specific growth rates, Table I gives the specific residual concentration of hexoses (sum of mannose and glucose) (g/g CDW), the residual glucose concentration (g/liter), the specific mannose consumption (μmol/g CDW), the specific GDP-mannose accumulation (μmol/g CDW), and the yield of GDP-mannose from mannose (%). Both residual glucose concentration and specific residual concentration of hexoses increased in the elevated initial mannose concentrations. Simultaneously, the specific mannose consumption decreased. There was no particular improvement observed in the accumulation of GDP-mannose in the pmi- strain when compared with the control strain. The yield of GDP-mannose from mannose was improved only at the highest initial mannose concentration. The concentrations used define the values 6 h after inoculation of the pmi- strain and 4 h after inoculation of the control strain. The samples of the control strain were taken earlier than those of the pmi- strain to ensure that the control strain was still growing on hexoses and not shifting to growth on ethanol. The pmi- strain was allowed a longer time for growth to provide an adequate cell mass for later analysis. At these time points samples were taken also for gene expression, enzyme activity, and metabolite concentration analysis, as we wanted to evaluate what was the mechanism that limited the growth and reduced the accumulation of GDP-mannose at the higher mannose concentrations in the pmi- strain.Table IBatch cultivations of a S. cerevisiae PMI40 deletion strainStrainControlControlpmi-pmi-pmi-pmi-pmi-Initial mannose (g/liter)0.7550.7511.535Growth rate (1/h)0.350.380.340.320.290.150.10Residual hexoses (g/g CDW)3.35.31.03.66.82124Residual glucose (g/liter)5.96.42.16.19.11313Mannose consumption (μmol/g CDW)5913707703652440547435GDP-Man accumulation (μmol/g CDW)0.751.60.871.20.630.661.4GDP-Man yield from mannose (%)0.130.040.200.190.140.120.31 Open table in a new tab Transport and Phosphorylation of Hexoses—The expression of genes encoding for hexose transporters is shown in Fig. 1 as a function of the specific concentration of residual hexoses (sum of glucose and mannose concentrations). The expression of low affinity transporter HXT1 and high affinity transporter HXT6 (17Ozcan S. Johnston M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 554-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) responded to the elevation of the hexose concentration as expected: HXT1 with ascending levels and HXT6 with descending levels. The expression of intermediate hexose affinity transporters, HXT3 and HXT4 (17Ozcan S. Johnston M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 554-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) stayed practically constant between 4 and 24 g/g CDW. The transporter induced by starvation, HXT5 (18Buziol S. Becker J. Baumeister A. Jung S. Mauch K. Reuss M. Boles E. FEMS Yeast Res. 2002; 2: 283-291PubMed Google Scholar, 19Diderich J.A. Schuurmans J.M. Van Gaalen M.C. Kruckeberg A.L. Van Dam K. Yeast. 2001; 18: 1515-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), was induced at the lowest residual hexose concentration and again at the two topmost hexose concentrations. The expression of the genes encoding for hexokinases HXK1 and GLK1 followed that of the hexose transporter HXT6. Similarly, the expression of the hexokinase HXK2 followed that of the hexose transporter HXT4. Phosphoglucose Isomerase Nodule—In the upper glycolysis, PGIe encoded by PGI1 catalyzes the isomerization between Glu-6-P and Fru-6-P. Fig. 2 displays the decreasing PGI1 expression as a function of the initial mannose concentration. Simultaneously, the in vitro activity of the PGIe increased. Intracellular, specific concentration of the substrate of the PGIe, Glu-6-P, was constant in all other mannose concentrations except on 1 g/liter mannose where it was elevated over 2-fold. Interestingly, it has been reported that Man-6-P can inhibit the activity of PGIe (20Noltmann E.A. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 6. Academic Press, New York1972: 271-354Google Scholar). We set up an in vitro assay in which the concentration of Man-6-P was increased to verify the inhibition of PGIe by Man-6-P. Indeed, the decreasing activity of PGIe as a function of Man-6-P in an in vitro assay demonstrates the inhibition by Man-6-P (Fig. 2). In this assay with Man-6-P, the PGIe activity was measured using a lysate of the cells grown on 3 g/liter mannose. The actual measured in vivo concentration of Man-6-P increased in the upper mannose concentration levels (3 and 5 g/liter). Phosphofructokinase Nodule—The next step in glycolysis is further phosphorylation of Fru-6-P to Fru-1,6-P by PFKe. Fig. 3 demonstrates how the expression of the gene encoding the major subunit of the first PFKe, PFK1, stayed rather constant when compared with that of PFK26, a gene encoding for the second PFKe, which catalyzes the reaction to Fru-2,6-P (fructose 2,6-bisphosphate). Fru-2,6-P activates the first PFKe (4Berg J.M. Tymoczko J.L. Stryer L. Biochemistry. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York2002Google Scholar). The concentration of the product of the first PFKe, Fru-1,6-P, was elevated at the mannose concentration of 1 g/liter. PFKe is also inhibited by other metabolites, e.g. by citrate (21Bloxham D.P. Lardy H.A. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 8. Academic Press, New York1973: 239-278Google Scholar), the measured value of which is a sum of the concentrations of CIT/ICIT. The in vivo concentration of CIT/ICIT increased substantially. Unlike the PGIe activity, the in vitro PFKe activity was seen to descend at the upper mannose concentrations. Lower Glycolysis, Citric Acid Cycle, and Pentose Phosphate Pathway—Further steps of the main metabolism, lower glycolysis, citric acid cycle, and pentose phosphate pathway, demonstrated milder effects to the elevated initial mannose concentration. In the lower glycolysis (supplemental Fig. 1), pyruvate and phosphoenolpyruvate concentrations were lowest at the initial mannose concentration of 1.5 g/liter, but otherwise were rather stable. The expression levels of pyruvate kinase encoding genes decreased slightly whereas the PYKe activity increased simultaneously with the PGIe activity. Taken together, the median expression of genes involved in glycolysis decreased in the elevated initial mannose concentrations. In the citric acid cycle (supplemental Fig. 2), many of the carboxylic acids accumulated. Median expression of the genes involved in the citric acid cycle increased in the elevated initial mannose concentrations. Also the measured isocitrate dehydrogenase activity increased steadily. In the pentose phosphate pathway (supplemental Fig. 3), concentrations, activities, and expression levels were rather constant at the initial mannose concentrations 1.5-5 g/liter after decreasing from the slightly higher values in the lowest initial mannose concentrations. Regulatory Connections—Networks of the main metabolic pathways were constructed at three regulatory levels, regulation of the expression of genes, protein-protein interactions, and post-translational covalent and allosteric modifications. The networks were constructed based on the transcriptional regulatory network by Lee et al. (22Lee T.I. Rinaldi N.J. Robert F. Odom D.T. Bar-Joseph Z. Gerber G.K. Hannett N.M. Harbison C.R. Thompson C.M.I., S., J., Z. Jennings E.G. Murray H.L. Gordon D.B. Ren B. Wyrick J.J. Tagne J.T. L.V. Fraenkel E.D.K. G. Young R.A. Science. 2002; 298: 799-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2378) Google Scholar) and three Internet databases, Brenda, Bind, and YPD. The genes encoding for hexokinases and hexose transporters are regulated in a tight manner (supplemental Fig. 4), as are also the genes in the lower glycolysis. The genes in the upper glycolysis, e.g. the PGIe- and PFKe-encoding genes, have no apparent regulatory connections. However, according to the transcription factor binding network (22Lee T.I. Rinaldi N.J. Robert F. Odom D.T. Bar-Joseph Z. Gerber G.K. Hannett N.M. Harbison C.R. Thompson C.M.I., S., J., Z. Jennings E.G. Murray H.L. Gordon D.B. Ren B. Wyrick J.J. Tagne J.T. L.V. Fraenkel E.D.K. G. Young R.A. Science. 2002; 298: 799-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2378) Google Scholar), the RAP1 transcription factor binds directly to HXT5, PGI1, PFK2, and PFK27 and has eventually regulatory connections to all steps of glycolysis either directly or via other transcription factors such as YAP6 and CIN5 (supplemental Fig. 5). In our study, the expression of RAP1 decreased in the elevated initial mannose concentrations. The protein-protein binding network (supplemental Fig. 6), however, connects proteins Pfk1p and Pfk2p tightly to several steps of glycolysis (23Ho Y. Gruhler A. Heilbut A. Bader G. Moore L. Adams S. Millar A. Taylor P. Bennett K. Boutilier K. Yang L. Wolting C. Donaldson I. Schandorff S. Shewnarane J. Vo M. Taggart J. Goudreault M. Muskat B. Alfarano C. Dewar D. Lin Z. Michalickova K. Willems A.

Interestingly, Pmi40p has been reported to be involved in a complex with Pfk2p (23Ho Y. Gruhler A. Heilbut A. Bader G. Moore L. Adams S. Millar A. Taylor P. Bennett K. Boutilier K. Yang L. Wolting C.

Tyers M. Nature. 2002; 415: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3070) Google Scholar). Pgi1p seems to have only two memberships in protein complexes, and those complexes do not involve Pmi40p or the PFK proteins (24Gavin A.C. Bosche M. Krause R. Grandi P. Marzioch M. Bauer A.

https://openalex.org/W1999201187,"Microarray analyses were performed to identify target genes that are shared by the acute myeloid leukemia (AML) translocation products PML-RARalpha, PLZF-RARalpha and AML1-ETO in inducibly transfected U937 cell lines. The cytoplasmic serine and threonine kinase MNK1 was identified as one of the target genes. At the protein level, MNK1 was significantly induced by each of the three fusion proteins. Protein half-life analyses showed that PML-RARalpha enhanced MNK1 protein stability in U937 cells and ATRA exposure decreased MNK1 half-life in NB4 cells. EIF4E, the main MNK1 substrate, plays a role in the pathogenesis of a variety of cancers. Upon MNK1 overexpression, eIF4E phosphorylation increased as a sign of functional activation. Interestingly, MNK1 protein expression decreased during myeloid differentiation. Inhibition of MNK1 activity by a specific inhibitor (CGP57380) enhanced differentiation of HL60 and 32D cells, further suggesting a role for MNK1 in the myeloid differentiation. In addition, kinase dead mutants of MNK1 significantly impaired proliferation of 32D cells. Immunohistochemistry of primary AML bone marrow biopsies showed strong cytoplasmic MNK1 expression in 25 of 99 AML specimens (25%). MNK1 expression was associated with high levels of c-myc expression. Taken together, we identified MNK1 as a target gene of several leukemogenic fusion proteins in AML. MNK1 plays a role in myeloid differentiation. These data suggest a role for MNK1 in the AML fusion protein-associated differentiation block."
https://openalex.org/W1977587696,"Fluorescence spectroscopy provides a direct method for evaluating the environment of a fluorescent ligand bound to its receptor. We utilized this methodology to determine the environment of Alexa within a cholecystokinin (CCK)-like probe (Alexa488-Gly-[(Nle28,31)CCK-26–33]; CCK-8 probe) bound to the type A CCK receptor (Harikumar, K. G., Pinon, D. L., Wessels, W. S., Prendergast, F. G., and Miller, L. J. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 18552–18560). Here, we study this probe at the type B CCK receptor and develop another probe with its fluorophore closer to the carboxyl-terminal pharmacophore of type B receptor ligands (Alexa488-Trp-Nle-Asp-Phe-NH2; CCK-4 probe). Both probes bound to type B CCK receptors in a saturable and specific manner and represented full agonists. Similar to the type A receptor, at the type B receptor these probes exhibited shorter lifetimes and lower anisotropy when the receptor was in the active conformation than when it was shifted to its inactive, G protein-uncoupled state using guanosine 5′-[β,γ-imido]-triphosphate trisodium salt. Absolute values for lifetime and anisotropy were lower for the CCK-8 probe bound to the type B receptor than for this probe bound to the type A receptor, and Alexa fluorescence was more easily quenched by iodide at the type B receptor. This represents the first direct evidence that, despite having identical affinities for binding and potencies for activating type A and B receptors, CCK is docked via distinct mechanisms, with the amino terminus more exposed to the aqueous milieu when bound to the type B CCK receptor than to the type A CCK receptor. Of interest, despite this difference in binding, activation of both receptors results in analogous direction of movement of the fluorescent indicator probes. Fluorescence spectroscopy provides a direct method for evaluating the environment of a fluorescent ligand bound to its receptor.

Understanding of the molecular basis of agonist ligand binding to a receptor and the conformational changes in that receptor that occur during its activation are key insights that should be helpful for the rational design and refinement of receptoractive drugs. The type A and type B cholecystokinin (CCK) 1The abbreviations used are: CCK, cholecystokinin; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; KRH, Krebs-Ringers-HEPES; GppNHp, guanosine 5′-[β,γ-imido]triphosphate trisodium salt; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography.1The abbreviations used are: CCK, cholecystokinin; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; KRH, Krebs-Ringers-HEPES; GppNHp, guanosine 5′-[β,γ-imido]triphosphate trisodium salt; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. receptors are structurally related members of the rhodopsin/β-adrenergic receptor family of G protein-coupled receptors that are activated by natural peptide ligands that are also structurally related to each other (2Miller L.J. Ding X.Q. Pancreatology. 2001; 1: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 3Noble F. Roques B.P. Prog. Neurobiol. 1999; 58: 349-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Of interest, each of these receptors has distinct structural specificity for its activation, with CCK-8 binding with high affinity and acting as a potent agonist of both receptors, whereas CCK-4 has similar action only at the type B CCK receptor, with very low affinity and biological activity at the type A CCK receptor (4Qian J-M. Rowley W.H. Jensen R.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G718-G727PubMed Google Scholar). Insights into the molecular basis of ligand binding to each of this pair of receptors provide an opportunity to better understand the evolution of their differences in structural specificity. Fluorescence spectroscopy is a versatile and powerful technique that can provide information about the environment of a fluorophore within a bound ligand as well as the conformational changes in a receptor that occur upon activation. We previously employed this biophysical approach to evaluate the environment of Alexa within a CCK-8-like analogue, Alexa488-Gly-[(Nle28,31)CCK-26–33] (CCK-8 probe), bound to the type A CCK receptor (1Harikumar K.G.

Our data demonstrated that conformational changes associated with activation of that receptor cause the amino terminus of bound CCK to move into an aqueous milieu from its more protected environment. In the current study, we have focused on the type B CCK receptor, utilizing the same CCK-8-like fluorescent probe as well as developing and studying an additional probe with its fluorophore situated closer to the pharmacophoric domain of the natural peptide ligand of the type B CCK receptor (Alexa488-Trp-Nle-Asp-Phe-NH2; CCK-4 probe) (1Harikumar K.G.

We have characterized the type B CCK receptor binding and biological activity of both of these probes. We have also measured the fluorescence anisotropy, lifetime, and ability to quench each of these probes when bound to this receptor. By manipulating the G protein-binding interface of this receptor, we also gained insights into the conformational changes associated with its active and inactive conformational states. Our results demonstrate that the fluorescent CCK-8 probe and the fluorescent CCK-4 probe were each able to bind specifically and with high affinity to the type B CCK receptor. They were full agonists at this receptor, able to elicit full intracellular calcium responses. Like the CCK-8 probe studied at the type A CCK receptor, both of these probes exhibited shorter lifetimes and lower anisotropy when the type B CCK receptor was in the active conformation than when it was shifted to its inactive, lower affinity, G protein-uncoupled state using guanosine 5′-[β,γ-imido]triphosphate trisodium salt (GppNHp). Treatment with this non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue moved the amino terminus of the CCK-4 probe into a more protected environment. Of interest, absolute values for fluorescence anisotropy and lifetime were lower for the fluorescent CCK-8 probe bound to the type B CCK receptor than for the same probe bound to the type A CCK receptor. Consistent with these data, Alexa fluorescence was more easily quenched by iodide at the type B CCK receptor than at the type A CCK receptor. These data provide the first direct evidence that, despite having identical affinities for binding and potencies for activating the highly homologous type A and type B CCK receptors, CCK is docked via distinct mechanisms to each receptor, with the amino terminus of CCK-8 more exposed to the extracellular aqueous milieu when bound to the type B CCK receptor than to the type A CCK receptor. Analogous displacement of CCK-4 when bound to the type B CCK receptor could explain why modification of its amino terminus with Alexa was tolerated for binding at the type B CCK receptor, whereas this structural modification might sterically hinder CCK-4 binding to the type A CCK receptor. Materials—Synthetic cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) was purchased from Peninsula Laboratories (Belmont, CA). Fura-2/AM and Alexa488-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). GppNHp was from Sigma. Fetal clone 2 was from Hyclone Laboratories (Logan, UT). Preparation of Fluorescent CCK Receptor Probes—Probe designs were based on established structure-activity considerations (2Miller L.J. Ding X.Q. Pancreatology. 2001; 1: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). We designed two probes representing agonists for type A and type B CCK receptors, in which the fluorescent reporter group, Alexa488, was situated at the amino terminus, outside of the hormone pharmacophore (Fig. 1). Parental peptides, Gly-[(Nle28,31)CCK-26–33] and Trp-Nle-Asp-Phe-NH2, were prepared by solid- and solution-phase manual synthesis, as we described previously (5Powers S.P. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1988; 31: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). For each peptide, the single free α-amino group was derivatized in solution with an N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of Alexa488. Each probe was purified to homogeneity by reversed-phase HPLC and had its identity established by mass spectrometry. In these probes, the approximate dimensions of the Alexa represent 5 × 10 × 10 Å, whereas the hormone pharmacophore, as bound to the CCK receptor, is estimated to occupy approximately twice that volume, with dimensions of 5 × 10 × 20 Å. Receptor Preparations—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines that were engineered to express human type A or type B CCK receptors were used as sources of receptor for this study (6Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Dougherty R.W. Miller L.J. Pancreas. 1996; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These cell lines have previously been fully characterized, establishing their expression of functional receptors that bind CCK and signal normally (6Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Dougherty R.W. Miller L.J. Pancreas. 1996; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 7Cheng Z.J. Harikumar K.G. Holicky E.L. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52972-52979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in tissue culture flasks containing Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% fetal clone 2 in a humidified environment containing 5% carbon dioxide. Cells were passaged approximately two times per week. A particulate fraction enriched in plasma membranes was prepared from semiconfluent cells, as we described previously (6Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Dougherty R.W. Miller L.J. Pancreas. 1996; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Cells were disrupted by mixing a suspension with 0.3 m sucrose containing 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and sonicating for 10 s at setting 7 with a Sonifier Cell Disrupter (Heat Systems-Ultrasonics, Inc., Plainview, NY). The sucrose concentration of the homogenate was adjusted to 1.3 m, placed at the bottom of a tube, and overlayered with 0.3 m sucrose before centrifugation at 225,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The membrane band at the sucrose interface was then harvested, diluted with ice-cold water, and pelleted by centrifugation at 225,000 × g for 30 min. Membranes were then resuspended in Krebs-Ringers-HEPES (KRH) medium containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 104 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and stored at –80 °C until use. Functional Characterization of Receptor Probes—Each probe was functionally characterized to determine its ability to bind to the CCK receptor and stimulate intracellular signaling in CCK receptor-bearing cells. CCK receptor binding was characterized in a standard radioligand binding assay, using conditions established previously (6Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Dougherty R.W. Miller L.J. Pancreas. 1996; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For this, enriched plasma membranes prepared from the receptor-bearing CHO cells (type A or type B CCK receptors) (10–15 μg per tube) were mixed with 1–2 pm radioligand (125I-d-Tyr-Gly-[(Nle28,31)CCK-26–33]) in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled fluorescent peptides. Tubes were incubated at 25 °C for 1 h to achieve steady-state binding. Bound radioligand was separated from free radioligand using a Skatron cell harvester (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) with receptor-binding filtermats. Bound radioactivity was quantified with a gamma spectrometer. Data were analyzed using the LIGAND program of Munson and Rodbard (8Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7771) Google Scholar), and data were graphed using the nonlinear least squares curve-fitting routine in the Prism program by GraphPad (San Diego, CA). The ability of the probes to stimulate signaling through the type A or type B CCK receptor was determined using a well-established assay of intracellular calcium concentration in Fura-2/AM-loaded receptor-bearing CHO cells (9Ganguli S.C. Park C.G. Holtmann M.H. Hadac E.M. Kenakin T.P. Miller L.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 593-598PubMed Google Scholar). In this assay, ∼2 million cells were loaded with 5 μm Fura-2/AM in Ham's F-12 medium for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed and stimulated with varied concentrations of the receptor probes at 37 °C, and fluorescence was quantified in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B luminescence spectrophotometer. Emission was determined at 520 nm after excitation at 340 and 380 nm, and calcium concentration was calculated from the ratio of the two intensities (10Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Peak intracellular calcium concentration was utilized to determine the agonist concentration dependence of this biological response. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Fluorescence of probes was analyzed while free in solution and while bound to CCK receptors. For the latter, fluorescent probes were incubated with receptor-bearing cell membranes (50 μg) at room temperature for 20 min in KRH buffer, pH 7.4. This suspension was then cooled, and the membranes were separated by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The ligand-bound membrane fraction was then washed with iced buffer, centrifuged, and resuspended in cold KRH buffer. Buffer was degassed by bubbling nitrogen to prevent quenching of fluorescence by soluble oxygen. Under these conditions, fluorescence emission was stable to photobleaching. Fluorescence measurements were performed with the membranes held in suspension at 20 °C by continuous stirring in a 1-ml quartz cuvette. Fluorescence emission spectra were acquired from these samples as rapidly as possible to ensure maximal ligand occupation of the receptor. Steady-state fluorescence spectra were recorded using a SPEX Fluorolog spectrofluorophotometer (SPEX Industries, Edison, NJ). The excitation and emission wavelengths were fixed at 482 and 518 nm, with a bandwidth of 6.8 nm. Similar incubations and measurements were performed with cell membranes that had not been exposed to the fluorescent probes. The latter were used to determine the effects of light scattering and background on the measurements, with these data subtracted from the experimental sample spectra. Collisional Quenching Experiments—Fluorescence quenching was performed using the hydrophilic reagent, potassium iodide (KI). Samples with receptor-bound fluorescent probe (50 μg of membrane protein per tube) were prepared as described above. Fluorescence was measured after sequential additions to the cuvette of freshly prepared KI (1 m KI stock in 10 mm Na2S2O3 to prevent air-induced oxidation of the iodide). The effects of dilution and ionic strength were calibrated by adding potassium chloride (1 m KCl) to the control sample and measuring the fluorescence. Corrected data were plotted according to the Stern-Volmer equation, Fo/F = 1 + KSV[Q], where Fo/F is the ratio of fluorescence intensity in the absence and presence of iodide and Q is the concentration of quencher. The Stern-Volmer quenching constant, KSV, was determined from the slope of Fo/F as a function of the iodide concentration [I–]. This value was then utilized with the value of the average fluorescence lifetime (〈τ〉, as described below) to determine the bimolecular quenching constant Kq (Kq = KSV/〈τ〉). Fluorescence Anisotropy Measurements—Steady-state anisotropy measurements were recorded using an Edinburgh spectrofluorophotometer equipped with polarizers and a thermostatically regulated cuvette, as described previously (1Harikumar K.G. Pinon D.L. Wessels W.S. Prendergast F.G. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18552-18560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Measurements were performed with constant optimal wavelengths for excitation and emission of each fluorophore noted above. Emission intensities were measured with excitation-side polarizer in the vertical position (V) and emission-side polarizer in the horizontal (H) and vertical (V) positions. Excitation wavelength was fixed at 482 nm. In each situation, this was in a region of relative plateau at or near the maximum in the absorbance spectrum of the probe. The measurements were performed at 4 °C, 20 °C, and 37 °C. Anisotropy was calculated according to the equation A = (IVV – GIVH)/(IVV + 2GIVH), where IVV is the intensity measured with both the excitation-side and emission-side polarizers in the vertical positions, IVH is the intensity measured with the excitation-side polarizer in the vertical position and the emission-side polarizer in the horizontal position. IHH is the intensity measured with both the excitation-side and emission-side polarizers in the horizontal-side positions, and IHV is the intensity measured with both the excitation side in the horizontal-side position and emission-side polarizer in the vertical position. The value of G was calculated by the equation G = IHH/IHV. Fluorescence Lifetime Measurements using Time-resolved Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Fluorescence lifetimes were measured by use of time-correlated single photon counting, as described previously (1Harikumar K.G. Pinon D.L. Wessels W.S. Prendergast F.G. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18552-18560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 11Doust T.A. Phillips D. Porter G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1984; 12: 630-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Receptor-bound probes were analyzed in a cuvette with a path length of 1 cm. Samples were excited using a pulse-picked, frequency-doubled titanium-sapphire picosecond laser (Coherent Mira 900, Palo Alto, CA). Fluorescence emission was collected at 25 °C through interference filters with a 6.8 nm bandwidth. The excitation wavelength was tunable with a pulse width of ∼2 ps full-width half-maximum. Data were collected in 1080 channels, with a width of 10.05 ps/channel. Fluorescence intensity decay analysis was performed using the GLOBALS Unlimited program package (12Beechem J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 37-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Models of single exponential and dual discrete exponential lifetime components were utilized. The quality of fit was judged using χ2 statistics. We assumed the fluorescence decay to be a sum of discrete exponentials, as in Eq. 1, I(t)=∑iαie−t/τi where I(t) is the intensity decay, τi is the decay time of the ith component, and αi is a weighting factor (amplitude) representing the contribution of the particular lifetime component to the fluorescence decay. The decay parameters were obtained using the nonlinear least squares iterative fitting procedure based on the Marquardt algorithm. The fractional fluorescence of the ith component at wavelength λ (fi(λ)) was calculated from Eq. 2. fi(λ)=(αi(λ)τi/Σαi(λ)τi) The mean average lifetime (〈τ〉) for the bi-exponential decays of fluorescence was calculated with Eq. 3, ⟨τ⟩=∑ifiτi where 〈τ〉 is the average lifetime, fi is the fraction of the ith decay component, and τi is the correspondent lifetime of the ith decay component. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed using Student's t test for unpaired values. Significant differences were considered to be at the p < 0.05 level. Characterization of Fluorescent Probes—Fluorescent agonist receptor ligands, Alexa488-Gly-[(Nle28,31)CCK-26–33] (CCK-8 probe) and Alexa488-Trp-Nle-Asp-Phe-NH2 (CCK-4 probe), were synthesized and purified to homogeneity by reversed-phase HPLC. Their structures were confirmed by mass spectrometry. These ligands were characterized pharmacologically in receptor binding studies using membranes isolated from CHO cells expressing either type A or type B CCK receptors. These probes bound to their receptors saturably and specifically with high affinity. Competition binding curves are shown in Fig. 2. Ki values were 0.33 ± 0.02 nm for CCK-8 and 9.7 ± 0.4 nm for Alexa488-CCK-8 at the type A CCK receptor and 0.57 ± 0.10 nm for CCK-8, 2.5 ± 0.5 nm for Alexa488-CCK-8, 21.1 ± 6.6 nm for CCK-4, and 2.4 ± 0.8 nm for Alexa488-CCK-4 at the type B CCK receptor. Neither CCK-4 nor Alexa488-CCK-4 displaced the binding of the CCK-like radioligand to the type A CCK receptor when used in concentrations as high as 1 μm. Of note, the Alexa moiety at the amino terminus of the probes interfered mildly with the binding affinity of CCK-8 at the type A CCK receptor (p < 0.01), but not at the type B CCK receptor (p > 0.05). Similarly, this modification was not tolerated at the amino terminus of CCK-4 for binding at the type A CCK receptor, but it actually enhanced binding of this probe at the type B CCK receptor (p < 0.01). Incubation with the non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue GppNHp during receptor binding is known to move the receptor toward its G protein-uncoupled state, which is expected to represent a low affinity state of the receptor. Indeed, this treatment was shown to result in a shift to the right of control binding, reflecting lower affinity binding for both Alexa488-CCK-8 and Alexa488-CCK-4 probes, as well as their parental peptides (Fig. 3). The biological activities of the probes were determined by measuring their ability to stimulate increases in intracellular calcium in receptor-bearing cells. Indeed, these probes stimulated intracellular calcium responses in a concentration-dependent manner, with maximal responses that were not different from those elicited by natural CCK-8 at the type A CCK receptor and CCK-4 at the type B CCK receptor. The biological response curves of these probes are shown in Fig. 4. EC50 values were 0.06 ± 0.01 nm for CCK-8 and 0.6 ± 0.01 nm for Alexa488-CCK-8 at the type A CCK receptor and 0.82 ± 0.18 nm for CCK-8, 1.22 ± 0.18 nm for Alexa488-CCK-8, 3.50 ± 0.61 nm for CCK-4, and 2.22 ± 0.27 nm for Alexa488-CCK-4 at the type B CCK receptor. Neither CCK-4 nor Alexa488-CCK-4 stimulated a significant intracellular calcium response in cells expressing the type A CCK receptor, even when used in concentrations as high as 1 μm. Once again, the amino-terminal Alexa had a small detrimental effect on activity at the type A CCK receptor (p < 0.05), but not at the type B CCK receptor (p > 0.05). Collisional Quenching of Fluorescent Ligands When Bound to Type A and Type B CCK Receptors—Experiments were performed to characterize the environment of the fluorophores within the receptor-bound ligands and understand the dynamic changes in this environment that occur during receptor activation. Fig. 5 shows the Stern-Volmer plots of quenching each fluorescent probe using potassium iodide. The bimolecular quenching constants (Kq) for bound ligands shown in Table I correlate with the extent of probe exposure to the aqueous environment. Consistent with previous observations (1Harikumar K.G. Pinon D.L. Wessels W.S. Prendergast F.G. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18552-18560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), incubation with GppNHp to move the receptor into its G protein-uncoupled, low affinity state resulted in a decrease in bimolecular quenching constants relative to control for each of the probes at type A and type B CCK receptors. Furthermore, the Alexa fluorescence was more easily quenched by iodide at the type B CCK receptor than at the type A CCK receptor. Of note, the potassium iodide quenching constants for these ligands as free in solution were actually lower than those for any of the receptor-bound peptides. This likely reflects ligand aggregation when free in solution, with the aggregate protecting the Alexa from the hydrophilic quencher. When the same probes are bound to the receptor, this aggregation does not occur.Table IQuenching of fluorescent CCK probes by iodide-GppNHp (active)+GppNHp (inactive)KsvKqKsvKqm-1×109m-1 s-1m-1×109m-1 s-1Alexa488-CCK-8 Bound to type A CCK receptor26.6 ± 1.27.5 ± 0.3315.0 ± 0.584.2 ± 0.16ap < 0.05 for Kq values for inactive versus active state of the same receptor using the same probe.

Open table in a new tab Previously, we measured bimolecular quenching constants for type A CCK receptor agonist and antagonist probes incorporating three distinct fluorophores, Alexa, acrylodan (6-acryloyl 2-dimethylaminonaphthalene), and 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl, at the same position at the amino terminus of CCK-8-like peptides (1Harikumar K.G. Pinon D.L. Wessels W.S. Prendergast F.G. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18552-18560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In those studies, each agonist had a higher quenching constant than the analogous antagonist, supporting the interpretation that the amino terminus of the probes moved into a more aqueous environment during activation of the type A CCK receptor. The mobility of the same probe (the CCK-8 probe used in the current studies) was more pronounced for the type B receptor compared with the type A CCK receptor. This suggested that the fluorophore within the CCK-8 probe occupying the activated type B receptor is more exposed to the aqueous environment than the same probe occupying the type A CCK receptor. Fluorescence Anisotropy of the Ligands When Bound to Type A and Type B CCK Receptors—Fluorescence anisotropy reflects the degree of rotational freedom of Alexa incorporated into each of the ligand probes, with lower anisotropy reflecting higher mobility of the fluorophore. Fig. 6 shows the fluorescence anisotropy of each of the probes when bound to these receptors at different temperatures. As expected, as temperature increased, fluorescence anisotropy decreased for each of the probes. Anisotropy values were significantly higher for each probe when bound to the type A or B CCK receptors in the presence of 1 μm GppNHp than when in their active, high affinity states. This suggests that this part of the probe is less mobile in the low affinity state of these receptors. Of note, the anisotropy was lower for type B receptors compared with type A CCK receptors at 20 °C and 37 °C, suggesting differences in molecular mobility during activation of these two receptors. These observations are consistent with the quenching results. There was no difference in anisotropy values between active and inactive states of the receptor at lower temperature. Current sets of data are consistent with the anisotropy observations obtained previously with analogous agonist and antagonist probes bound to the type A CCK receptor (1Harikumar K.G. Pinon D.L. Wessels W.S. Prendergast F.G. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18552-18560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Lifetime Measurements of Ligands When Bound to Type A and Type B CCK Receptors—Fluorescence decay was resolved into two exponential components for this analysis. Best fits for these data were determined using χ2 values. The average lifetime distribution of the fluorescent ligand reflects the degree of exposure of the fluorophores to an aqueous environment, with shorter lifetime indicating more exposure. The current data show that the average fluorescence lifetime values were shorter when probes were bound to the type B CCK receptor than to the type A CCK receptor (Table II). The average lifetime of these probes when bound to type A and type B CCK receptors was significantly lengthened in the presence of 1 μm GppNHp relative to the control state (p < 0.05) (Table II). This manipulation is known to shift the receptor into its low affinity, inactive conformation.Table IIFluorescence lifetime distribution of type B CCK receptor-bound fluorescent probesTreatmentτ1f1τ2f2χ2Average lifetimensnsnsAlexa488-CCK-8 -GppNHp4.00 ± 0.020.85 ± 0.010.85 ± 0.050.13 ± 0.011.08 ± 0.013.48 ± 0.02 +GppNHp4.01 ± 0.040.87 ± 0.010.96 ± 0.090.09 ± 0.011.07 ± 0.013.73 ± 0.04ap < 0.05 for fluorescence lifetime values for inactive versus active state of the type B CCK receptor using the same agonist probe.Alexa488-CCK-4 -GppNHp4.52 ± 0.130.75 ± 0.040.99 ± 0.380.14 ± 0.061.08 ± 0.033.63 ± 0.06 +GppNHp4.66 ± 0.120.73 ± 0.030.92 ± 0.170.24 ± 0.011.10 ± 0.013.79 ± 0.08ap < 0.05 for fluorescence lifetime values for inactive versus active state of the type B CCK receptor using the same agonist probe.a p < 0.05 for fluorescence lifetime values for inactive versus active state of the type B CCK receptor using the same agonist probe. Open table in a new tab The superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors reflects remarkable diversity of the structure of natural ligands and their molecular mechanisms for binding, despite evidence that these receptors evolved from a common precursor (13Kolakowski L.F. Receptors Channels. 1994; 2: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar). It is also noteworthy that within families of G protein-coupled receptors, natural ligands often are structurally related to each other, suggesting that they also evolved from common precursors (14Van Kesteren R.E. Tensen C.P. Smit A.B. Minnen VanJ. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Meyerhof W. Richter D. Van Heerikhuizen H. Vreugdenhil E. Geraerts W.P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3619-3626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Such ligands often have been shown to bind with molecular mechanisms that are similar to each other, as well. There has been much discussion about what has driven the evolution of ligand-receptor pairs (15Moyle W.R. Campbell R.K. Myers R.V. Bernard M.P. Han Y. Wang X. Nature. 1994; 368: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 16Vernier P. Cardinaud B. Valdenaire O. Philippe H. Vincent J.D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 375-381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The type A and type B CCK receptors and their natural ligands, CCK and gastrin, provide a very interesting opportunity to explore this question. Previous analysis has suggested that these receptors have evolved from a common receptor (17Vigna S.R. Thorndyke M.C. Williams J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4355-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), with the CCK-X receptor that has been isolated from Xenopus laevis brain believed to represent an ancestral precursor (18Schmitz F. Prat D.S. Wu M.J. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Beinborn M. Kopin A.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 436-441PubMed Google Scholar). This is supported by comparison of the structures of the three types of CCK receptors, with type A and type B CCK receptors sharing about 50% identity and both type A and type B CCK receptors sharing ∼55% identity with the CCK-X receptor. Gene duplication is postulated to have occurred at the level of the amniote, yielding two different receptors that have subsequently evolved independently (19Larsson L-I. Rehfeld J.F. Nature. 1977; 269: 335-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Whereas both types of CCK receptors bind and are activated by CCK-8, the type B CCK receptor is much more sensitive to CCK-4 than the type A CCK receptor. Structure-activity studies have shown that the latter requires the carboxyl-terminal seven amino acids of CCK, including a sulfated tyrosine in the position seven residues from the carboxyl terminus. A similar story has been proposed for the ligands CCK and gastrin, which are felt to have evolved from a common precursor by gene duplication and independent evolution (20Johnsen A.H. Rehfeld J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 419-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Here, CCK seems to be evolutionarily older than gastrin. Johnsen et al. (21Johnsen A.H. Jonson L. Rourke I.J. Rehfeld J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10221-10226Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) proposed that gastrin first appeared in chondrodrichthyeans, the group of animals also believed to be the first to have an acid-secreting stomach. With CCK-8 binding to both the type A and type B CCK receptors with equal affinity and having equal potency at each receptor and with both CCK and gastrin sharing their carboxyl-terminal pentapeptide-amide, it is attractive to postulate that the carboxyl-terminal region of CCK and gastrin might bind to these receptors in a similar manner. Indeed, this is the basis of using chimeric receptors to gain insight into the molecular basis for structurally similar but functionally distinct receptors, such as the type A and type B CCK receptors. It is noteworthy that such chimeric constructs between the type A and type B CCK receptors have not been informative of a single shared region contributing to CCK-4 binding and action or even of the region of the type A CCK receptor that interacts with the functionally critical tyrosine-sulfate residue within CCK-8 (22Kopin A.S. McBride E.W. Quinn S.M. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Beinborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5019-5023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 23Silvente-Poirot S. Wank S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14698-14706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The best explanation for this is that the CCK-receptor pairs might have evolved to include docking of CCK to the type A and type B CCK receptors in manners distinct from each other. Indeed, in the current work, we provide the first direct evidence to support this hypothesis. By using fluorescent ligand probes, we demonstrate that the environment of the fluorophore is different when bound to the type A and type B CCK receptors. The CCK-8-like probe binds to both receptors with similar affinities and potencies, yet the fluorophore is more exposed to the aqueous milieu when this ligand is bound to the type B receptor than to the type A receptor. This was confirmed by fluorescent ligand anisotropy, lifetimes, and hydrophilic quenching experiments. This might also explain the structure-activity data in which Alexa is not tolerated at the amino terminus of the CCK-4 analogue for binding or activation of the type A CCK receptor, whereas it is tolerated well at the type B CCK receptor. Our data even suggest that this modification of a CCK-4 analogue could enhance its binding affinity at the type B CCK receptor. If the amino-terminal region of CCK-4 is also situated more toward the aqueous milieu in the type B receptor than in the type A receptor, the Alexa could sterically interfere with type A CCK receptor binding while not interfering with binding to the type B CCK receptor. Our concept of understanding of the molecular basis of natural ligand binding to the type A CCK receptor is better refined than that of ligand binding to the type B CCK receptor. This is based on diverse experimental techniques, including ligand structure-activity relationships, site-specific photoaffinity labeling of the receptor, receptor mutagenesis, fluorescence resonance energy transfer, and theoretical molecular modeling (24Ji Z.

Toxicol. 2002; 91: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the best current working model of the natural agonist docking at the type A CCK receptor, the carboxyl terminus of CCK is situated adjacent to the amino-terminal tail region of the receptor just outside of transmembrane segment 1, whereas the amino terminus of the peptide is in a groove adjacent to the third extracellular loop and covered by the distal amino-terminal tail of the receptor (29Ding X.Q. Pinon D.I. Furse K.E. Lybrand T.P. Miller L.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 1041-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It is notable that photoaffinity labeling studies of the type B CCK receptor have provided data that appear to be incompatible with such docking and might actually support a model in which the carboxylterminal region of the peptide dips down within the confluence of helices (30Anders J. Bluggel M. Meyer H.E. Kuhne R. Ter Laak A.M. Kojro E. Fahrenholz F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6043-6055Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Indeed, such divergent docking is quite compatible with the fluorescence differences reported in the current work. It is also interesting that the general motion of the fluorescence-tagged agonist ligands observed during the activation of the type B CCK receptor is analogous to that observed previously for the type A CCK receptor (1Harikumar K.G.

Here, the amino-terminal fluorescent indicator moves into the aqueous milieu, where it is more easily quenched by iodide. Agonist-induced changes in conformation of the cytosolic face of rhodopsin and the β2 adrenergic receptor have been described previously (31Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar, 32Gether U. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol.

It is difficult to understand the relationship of the changes in the ectodomain of the CCK receptors probed in the current work and those in the literature. Only when we better understand the gobal conformation and conformational changes of these molecules will this become clearer. We thank Peter J. Calahan and William S.

Detailed characterization of the IgE-FcϵRI interaction may offer insights into possible modes of inhibiting the interaction, which could thereby act as a potential therapy for allergy. In this study, NMR, CD, and fluorescence spectroscopies have been used to characterize structurally the Cϵ3 domain of IgE and its interaction with other protein ligands, namely, Cϵ2, Cϵ4, sFcϵRIα, and CD23. We have shown that the recombinant Cϵ3 domain exists alone in solution as a “molten globule.” On interaction with sFcϵRIα, Cϵ3 adopts a folded tertiary structure, as shown by the release of the fluorescent probe 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonate and by characteristic changes in the 1H, 15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence NMR spectrum. However, the interactions between the Cϵ3 domain and Cϵ2, Cϵ4, or CD23 do not induce such folding and would therefore be expected to involve only local interaction surfaces. The conformational flexibility of the Cϵ3 domain of the whole IgE molecule may play a role in allowing fine tuning of the affinity and specificity of IgE for a variety of different physiological ligands and may be involved in the conformational change of IgE postulated to occur on interaction with FcϵRI.

IgE in mammals plays a crucial role in host defense against parasitic infections (1Sutton B.J. Gould H.J. Nature. 1993; 366: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). However, overproduction of specific IgE antibodies in response to common, innocuous antigens underlies allergic reactions (2Cookson W. Nature. 1999; 402: B5-B11Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Allergic diseases affect approximately one-third of the general population (3Ono S.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 347-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). IgE is a heterotetramer of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains, organized into discrete globular domains containing the immunoglobulin fold (reviewed in Refs. 1Sutton B.J. Gould H.J. Nature. 1993; 366: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar and 4Gould H.J. Sutton B.J. Beavil A.J. Beavil R.L. McCloskey N. Coker H.A. Fear D. Smurthwaite L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 579-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Each of these immunoglobulin domains is comprised of about 110 amino acids, folded into a β-sheet “sandwich” in the C-type topology. IgE contains an additional constant domain, Cϵ2, in place of the flexible hinge region found in IgG. IgE-Fc is a dimeric fragment of Cϵ2-Cϵ4 and retains full binding activity for the high affinity IgE receptor (FcϵRI) (5Basu M. Hakimi J. Dharm E. Kondas J.A. Tsien W.H. Pilson R.S. Lin P. Gilfillan A. Haring P. Braswell E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13118-13127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recently determined crystal structure of IgE-Fc (6Wan T. Beavil R.L. Fabiane S.M. Beavil A.J. Sohi M.K. Keown M. Young R.J. Henry A.J. Owens R.J. Gould H.J. Sutton B.J. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) indicates that the presence of the Cϵ2 domains causes IgE-Fc to assume a highly bent conformation, confirming previous scattering (7Beavil A.J. Young R.J. Sutton B.J. Perkins S.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14449-14461Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and fluorescence (8Zheng Y. Shopes B. Holowka D. Baird B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9125-9132Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) studies. This structural information, taken together with the effect of Cϵ2 domains on the kinetics of binding to FcϵRI (9McDonnell J.M. Calvert R. Beavil R.L. Beavil A.J. Henry A.J. Sutton B.J. Gould H.J. Cowburn D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), may account for the distinct features of the kinetics of the interaction of IgE with its receptor compared with those of IgG and its receptor (10Sondermann P. Oosthuizen V. Immunol. Lett. 2002; 82: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In order for IgE to trigger cellular responses, it must function in combination with a membrane-bound receptor. The human FcϵRI can form either a heterotetramer composed of three different transmembrane polypeptides, αβγ2, or a heterotrimer, αγ2 (11Ra C. Jouvin M.H. Kinet J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15323-15327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extracellular portion of the α chain is necessary for binding of the Fc region of IgE and consists of two globular domains, D1 and D2. FcϵRI is present constitutively on mast cells and basophils and is also expressed on activated eosinophils. The high binding affinity of FcϵRI for IgE (Ka ∼ 1010 m-1) means that most IgE is found fixed to the cells that bear FcϵRI even in the absence of bound antigen (12Ravetch J.V. Kinet J.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 457-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar). IgE also has a second, lower affinity cell surface receptor, CD23 (FcϵRII). CD23 is unlike other immunoglobulin receptors in that it is not a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily; instead, it belongs to the family of C-type lectins (13Weis W.I. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). The interaction of IgE with FcϵRI is a critical step in the initiation of an allergic response (2Cookson W. Nature. 1999; 402: B5-B11Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the complex sFcϵRIα/Cϵ3–4 has been determined and reveals two distinct binding sites on the extracellular portion of the α chain of sFcϵRIα (14Garman S.C. Wurzburg B.A. Tarchevskaya S.S. Kinet J.P. Jardetzky T.S. Nature. 2000; 406: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Comparison of the sFcϵRIα/Cϵ3–4 complex structure and the recent crystal structure of the whole IgE-Fc (Cϵ2–4) indicates that a substantial conformational change involving Cϵ2 may occur on binding to sFcϵRIα (6Wan T. Beavil R.L. Fabiane S.M. Beavil A.J. Sohi M.K. Keown M. Young R.J. Henry A.J. Owens R.J. Gould H.J. Sutton B.J. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 15Novak N. Bieber T. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 607-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The binding of IgE to both FcϵRI and CD23 has been localized to the Cϵ3 domains (16Henry A.J. Cook J.P. McDonnell J.M. Mackay G.A. Shi J. Sutton B.J. Gould H.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15568-15578Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), suggesting this domain might be an attractive target for structural and functional studies. However, Cϵ3 has proven a difficult protein to produce; attempts to express it in mammalian and yeast systems have been unsuccessful (data not shown). In hindsight, this may be due to the inherent instability of the Cϵ3 domain alone. Recombinant Cϵ3 has been expressed in bacteria and purified, and although it appears to have little recognizable secondary structure or hydrophobic core, it is able to bind to FcϵRIα (17Henry A.J. McDonnell J.M. Ghirlando R. Sutton B.J. Gould H.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7406-7413Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 18Vangelista L. Laffer S. Turek R. Gronlund H. Sperr W.R. Valent P. Pastore A. Valenta R. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 1571-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that this “unfolded” Cϵ3 domain could undergo a conformational change to a more ordered state on binding to FcϵRIα; however, initial far-UV CD studies on the individual proteins and mixtures were unable to confirm this (17Henry A.J. McDonnell J.M. Ghirlando R. Sutton B.J. Gould H.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7406-7413Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). “Molten globules,” initially described in 1983, were proposed as intermediates in protein folding pathways (19Ohgushi M. Wada A. FEBS Lett. 1983; 164: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). These compact intermediates are characterized by the presence of secondary structure without rigid tertiary structure (reviewed in Ref. 20Ptitsyn O.B. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 83-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because molten globules lack rigid tertiary structure, their amino acid side-chains have high internal mobility, leading to the exposure of some clusters of internal nonpolar groups. This allows them to bind hydrophobic molecules, such as 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonate (ANS), 1The abbreviations used are: ANS, 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonate; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. much more strongly than either the native or fully unfolded states. Over the last two decades, the native state of proteins has been increasingly viewed as consisting of a dynamic ensemble of conformational states. It has been shown that there is an uneven distribution of structural stability throughout proteins, with sites involved in mediating protein-protein interactions often characterized by the presence of regions of low structural stability (21Luque I. Freire E. Proteins. 2000; 41: 63-71Crossref Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Such an arrangement may facilitate ligand-induced conformational changes and can allow for fine-tuning of specificity and affinity between ligands and proteins (22Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). It has been estimated that 36–63% of cellular proteins or protein domains exist in a partially disordered state (23Dunker A.K. Brown C.J. Lawson J.D. Iakoucheva L.M. Obradovic Z. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6573-6582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar). When such a protein, existing as an ensemble of conformers, binds to a ligand, it may stabilize one protein conformer, shifting the equilibrium and causing a population shift in favor of this conformer (24Flynn G.C. Beckers C.J. Baase W.A. Dahlquist F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10826-10830Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 25Hornby D.P. Whitmarsh A. Pinarbasi H. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Shore P. Baldwin G.S. Waltho J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These changes in protein conformation can be monitored spectroscopically, using fluorescence, CD, and NMR. The melting temperature (Tm) of a protein, determined by differential scanning calorimetry, can provide a global measure of its stability (reviewed in Ref. 26Creighton T.E. Adv. Biophys. 1984; 18: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A comparison of the Tm obtained for IgE and that for IgG (27Dorrington K.J. Bennich H. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 8378-8384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Mimura Y. Sondermann P. Ghirlando R. Lund J. Young S.P. Goodall M. Jefferis R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45539-45547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) indicates that IgE is less stable than IgG. Thermal denaturation of proteolytic fragments of IgE indicates the determinants of the lower Tm are localized to the region that interacts with FcϵRI (27Dorrington K.J. Bennich H. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 8378-8384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The aim of the work described in this study is to characterize how structural and energetic contributions define the pathway by which IgE and FcϵRI interact. We have used spectroscopic techniques to observe the conformation of the isolated Cϵ3 domain in solution. The Cϵ3 domain alone exists as a molten globule, lacking stable tertiary structure. The effect of addition of a number of ligands on the conformation of Cϵ3 has been observed. Addition of sFcϵRIα to Cϵ3 causes the domain to adopt a folded structure. The folding of Cϵ3 can be monitored simply by the binding of a fluorescent hydrophobic ligand, such as ANS. Expression and Purification of sFcϵRIα—The production of a soluble fragment of human sFcϵRIα (Val1 to Lys176) for mammalian expression in the mouse myeloma cell line NSO (29Cook J.P. Henry A.J.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15579-15588Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and subsequent cloning and expression of a shorter construct (Val1 to Ala172) in yeast Pichia pastoris have been detailed previously (29Cook J.P.

The pPICZα vector (Invitrogen) containing the shorter sFcϵRIα construct with an N-terminal polyhistidine tag was transformed into P. pastoris strain SMD1168H. Fermentative growth of the P. pastoris clone was performed according to the manufacturer's guidelines (Invitrogen). Yeast supernatant was filtered and concentrated by flowing across a VivaFlow 200 membrane (VivaScience) and then dialyzed extensively against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4. Protein was purified on a phenyl-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) and a Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences) charged with nickel. Purified recombinant sFcϵRIα was concentrated and buffer exchanged into PBS, pH 5.0. The protein concentration was spectrophotometrically determined using an extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 2.56 for a 1 mg/ml solution (30Mackay G.A. Hulett M.D. Cook J.P. Trist H.M. Henry A.J.

Cloning of Recombinant Cϵ3—The Cϵ3 fragment (Cys328-Ser437), with C328S mutation, produced by PCR using an IgE-Fc cDNA clone isolated from U266 cells, was subcloned into the NdeI and BamHI cloning sites of pET5a expression vector (Novagen) as described previously (17Henry A.J. McDonnell J.M. Ghirlando R. Sutton B.J. Gould H.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7406-7413Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The Cϵ3 fragment was isolated from the pET5a clone by PCR using primers TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG and TATCACGAGGCCCTTT and subcloned into the NdeI and BamHI cloning sites of pET28a expression vector (Novagen). The integrity of the clone was confirmed by DNA sequencing (Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom). Expression and Purification of Recombinant Cϵ2, Cϵ3, Cϵ4, and CD23—Previously, the Cϵ2 construct (Ser225-Asp330), with C241S and C328S mutations, and the Cϵ4 construct (Ser437-Asn544) were produced by PCR using an IgE-Fc cDNA clone isolated from U266 cells. The Cϵ2 fragment was subcloned into the NdeI and BamHI cloning sites of pET5a expression vector (Novagen) (9McDonnell J.M. Calvert R. Beavil R.L. Beavil A.J. Henry A.J. Sutton B.J. Gould H.J. Cowburn D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The Cϵ4 fragment was subcloned into the NdeI and BamHI cloning sites of pET15b expression vector (Novagen). Previously, the derCD23 construct (Ser156-Glu298) was subcloned from CD23 cDNA by PCR (31Ikuta K. Takami M. Kim C.W. Honjo T. Miyoshi T. Tagaya Y. Kawabe T. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Recombinant Cϵ2, Cϵ3, Cϵ4, and CD23 were expressed in Escherichia coli host strain BL21(DE3). 15N- and 13C, 15N-labeled samples were prepared in M9 media with the addition of 1.0 g/liter 15NH4Cl or 3 g/liter [13C]glucose and 1.0 g/liter 15NH4Cl. Recombinant protein expression was induced by addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Rifampicin was added to the cultures 40 min after induction had been started, to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml as described previously (32Lee K.M. Androphy E.J. Baleja J.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cell pellets were resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer (100 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 50 mm MgCl2 in PBS, pH 7.4). After sonication, 5 μl of DNase was added to the solution and incubated for 1 h. Cells were then washed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 12 min and resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer. Washing was repeated at least three times. Cϵ2 and CD23 proteins were refolded and purified as described previously (9McDonnell J.M. Calvert R. Beavil R.L. Beavil A.J. Henry A.J. Sutton B.J. Gould H.J. Cowburn D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 33Shi J. Ghirlando R. Beavil R.L. Beavil A.J. Keown M.B. Young R.J. Owens R.J. Sutton B.J. Gould H.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2112-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For Cϵ3 preparations, the inclusion bodies were isolated by solubilizing the final pellet in 10 ml of 6 m guanidinium chloride, 0.02 m Na2HPO4, 0.5 m NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol at pH 7.4. This solution was then loaded onto a Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences) charged with nickel. Refolding of Cϵ3 was carried out while it was bound to the column. After washing of the immobilized Cϵ3 with 6 m guanidinium chloride, 0.02 m Na2HPO4, and 0.5 m NaCl at pH 7.4, the guanidinium chloride concentration was reduced to 0 m. Bound protein was then eluted by decreasing pH with a linear gradient to pH 1.5. The procedure for Cϵ4 was nearly identical, except that refolding was carried out in solution, according to the method of Taylor et al. (34Taylor M.A. Pratt K.A. Revell D.F. Baker K.C. Sumner I.G. Goodenough P.W. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 455-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and purification was performed on a Talon column (Clontech) charged with cobalt. Purified recombinant Cϵ2, Cϵ3, Cϵ4, and CD23 were each concentrated and buffer exchanged into PBS, pH 5.0. The protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient at 280 nm: 1.32 for a 1 mg/ml solution of Cϵ2 (9McDonnell J.M. Calvert R. Beavil R.L. Beavil A.J. Henry A.J. Sutton B.J. Gould H.J. Cowburn D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), 1.15 for Cϵ3 (17Henry A.J. McDonnell J.M. Ghirlando R. Sutton B.J. Gould H.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7406-7413Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), 1.51 for Cϵ4, and 2.81 for derCD23. There was no reaction between refolded Cϵ3 and 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (35Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21624) Google Scholar), showing that no free sulfydryl groups were present. CD Spectroscopy—The CD spectra of native and denatured Cϵ3 were recorded in either a Jasco J-600 or a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter at 20 °C, calibrated with reference to 1S-(+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid. Spectra in the far-UV region (260–195 nm) were recorded in cylindrical cells of 0.2-mm path length using a protein concentration of 0.2 mg/ml in PBS, pH 5.0. Spectra in the near-UV region (320–260 nm) were recorded in cylindrical cells of 5-mm path length, using a protein concentration of 3 mg/ml. In each case, three scans (recorded at scan rate of 10 nm/min with a time constant of 2 s) were averaged and corrected by subtraction of the spectrum of buffer alone. Mean residue ellipticities were calculated using a value of 112 for the mean residue weight of the protein. The far-UV spectrum was analyzed by CONTIN to give an estimate of the contribution of elements of regular secondary structure (36Provencher S.W. Glöckner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar). Fluorescence—The fluorescence spectra of native and denatured Cϵ3 were recorded on a Perkin Elmer LS 50 spectrofluorometer at 20 °C, using a protein concentration of 0.2 mg/ml in PBS, pH 5.0. Protein fluorescence emission was measured between 300 and 400 nm, after excitation at 290 nm. Cϵ3 was incubated for 1 h with various concentrations of guanidinium chloride. The concentration of the 6 m stock of guanidinium chloride was checked by refractive index measurements (37Nozaki Y. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 26: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Spectra were corrected for Raman scattering by the solvent. ANS binding to Cϵ3 was studied using an ANS concentration of 17.3 μm. ANS fluorescence emission was measured between 430 and 550 nm, after excitation at 370 nm. ANS fluorescence emission was measured both for native and denatured Cϵ3 and for Cϵ3 after addition of protein ligands (sFcϵRIα, Cϵ2, Cϵ4, and CD23) at equimolar concentrations. Three of the protein ligands (sFcϵRIα, Cϵ2, and CD23) do not alter ANS fluorescence emission when added separately to ANS solutions. However, Cϵ4 alone does appear to bind weakly to ANS, with a <3-fold increase in fluorescence and a modest blue shift (20 nm) in the λmax of relative to free ANS. This is probably due to exposure of hydrophobic surfaces that would not otherwise be exposed in the context of the IgE molecule. Emission spectra were corrected for the effect of dilution by performing control experiments in which buffer alone was added. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance—NMR samples of 270–300 μl, with 5% D2O and 0.02% sodium azide, were transferred into Shigemi tubes (BM-3). All spectra were recorded on home-built NMR spectrometers with Oxford Instrument magnets, at operating proton frequencies of 500 or 600 MHz. Spectra were collected over a range of temperatures from 5 °C to 35 °C; only spectra recorded at 25 °C are shown here. The proton carrier frequency was set on water at 4.74 ppm. One-dimensional NMR spectra were obtained using a sweep width of 16,000 Hz, 2048 points, and an acquisition time of 128 ms. Gradient enhanced 1H, 15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) experiments were performed at a proton frequency of 600 MHz. The spectral width in the direct 1H dimension was 20,000 Hz, collected over 2048 points, with an acquisition time (t2) of 102.4 ms. The spectral width in the indirect 15N dimension was 1700 Hz, collected over 100 points, with an acquisition time (t1) of 58.8 ms. In each case, 64 scans were collected. The carrier frequency was set at 120 ppm. All NMR titrations were carried out in PBS, pH 5.0. Characterization of Recombinant Cϵ3—Refolded Cϵ3 containing the correct intradomain disulfide bond (Cys358-Cys418) was shown to be predominantly monomeric by nonreducing SDS-PAGE and by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. In addition, NMR hydrodynamic relaxation studies can be used to give an estimate of the molecular mass of a sample relative to a series of protein standards. In this case, Cϵ3 was shown to be monomeric, having a molecular mass of ∼12,000 Da. The far-UV CD spectrum of refolded Cϵ3 is shown in Fig. 2a. Analysis of the spectrum by CONTIN (36Provencher S.W. Glöckner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar) indicates that Cϵ3 contains ∼35% β-sheet structure. This value is in good agreement with the ∼40% β-sheet structure present in the fully folded Cϵ3 domain within IgE-Fc (6Wan T. Beavil R.L. Fabiane S.M. Beavil A.J. Sohi M.K. Keown M. Young R.J. Henry A.J. Owens R.J. Gould H.J. Sutton B.J. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, the near-UV spectrum of refolded Cϵ3 exhibited only very small ellipticities, indicating little tight packing of side-chains. The solvent accessibility of the two tryptophan residues of Cϵ3 was measured by protein fluorescence spectroscopy. Refolded Cϵ3 emits fluorescence with λmax of 350 nm. As Cϵ3 is exposed to increasing concentrations of guanidinium chloride, the intensity of fluorescence emission increases, and the λmax shifts to 358 nm. A plot of percentage maximum change in fluorescence at 360 nm against guanidinium chloride concentration for Cϵ3 is linear. The unfolding of Cϵ3 is therefore not a cooperative process; this would be expected for a protein that lacks stable tertiary structure. ANS is a fluorescent hydrophobic probe that shows a stronger affinity for the molten globule state than for either the fully folded or unfolded states (38Semisotnov G.V. Rodionova N.A. Kutyshenko V.P. Ebert B. Blanck J. Ptitsyn O.B. FEBS Lett. 1987; 224: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Free ANS in aqueous solution shows weak fluorescence with a λmax of 515 nm. Binding of ANS to the molten globule state causes a large increase in its fluorescence. ANS free in solution emits fluorescence with a λmax of 515 nm. Incubation of ANS with Cϵ3 causes a dramatic increase in the fluorescence intensity and shifts the λmax to 470 nm (Fig. 2b). As Cϵ3 is unfolded by increasing guanidinium chloride concentrations, ANS becomes displaced, and its fluorescence emission returns to that characteristic for ANS alone. The 15N HSQC NMR spectrum of refolded Cϵ3 is shown in Fig. 2c. The lack of chemical shift dispersion in both dimensions is characteristic of a protein that lacks native stable tertiary structure and is sampling a series of different conformations during the course of the NMR experiment. Monomeric recombinant Cϵ3 alone in solution has native-like secondary structure and lacks rigid tertiary structure and is therefore typical of the molten globule state (reviewed in Ref. 20Ptitsyn O.B. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 83-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interaction of Cϵ3 with Protein Ligands—The effect of addition of the ligands sFcϵRIα, Cϵ2, Cϵ3, and CD23 on the conformation of Cϵ3 was studied using ANS fluorescence and NMR spectroscopies. Each of these ligands has been shown previously to bind to Cϵ3, using surface plasmon resonance and/or NMR (17Henry A.J. McDonnell J.M. Ghirlando R. Sutton B.J. Gould H.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7406-7413Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Fluorescence (sFcϵRIα, Cϵ2, Cϵ4, and CD23 as Ligands)— Cϵ3 alone in solution binds to ANS, causing an increase in fluorescence emission and a shift in the λmax compared with free ANS. Any alteration in the fluorescence emission properties of ANS after equimolar addition of ligands to the Cϵ3/ANS mixture will result from changes in the conformation of Cϵ3. sFcϵRIα, Cϵ2, and CD23 were shown not to bind to ANS, and although Cϵ4 binds weakly to ANS, the changes in intensity and λmax are small relative to those of Cϵ3 (less than a 3-fold increase in fluorescence intensity and a 20 nm blue shift in λmax). Addition of sFcϵRIα to Cϵ3 causes ANS to dissociate from Cϵ3, reducing the intensity and increasing the λmax of ANS fluorescence emission. This reduction in binding of ANS to Cϵ3 is an indication of the loss of the molten globule character, as would be expected if Cϵ3 adopted a more stable tertiary structure on binding to sFcϵRIα (Fig. 3). The fluorescence emission spectrum represents the average emission over all the conformations present in the sample. Unlike sFcϵRIα, addition of Cϵ2, Cϵ4, or CD23 to Cϵ3 does not cause ANS to dissociate from Cϵ3 (Fig. 3) because there is no change in the intensity or λmax of ANS fluorescence emission compared with that for Cϵ3 alone. This indicates that Cϵ3 does not adopt a stable tertiary structure on binding to Cϵ2, Cϵ4, or CD23. NMR (sFcϵRIα and Cϵ2 as Ligands)—The one-dimensional, 15N-filtered, proton NMR spectra of Cϵ3 before and after addition of sFcϵRIα are shown in Fig. 4a. On binding of sFcϵRIα, signal dispersion beyond 8.5 ppm is observed, indicating the formation of stable tertiary interactions within Cϵ3. The loss of the large broad signal at ∼8.3 ppm on binding sFcϵRIα indicates that the backbone amides of Cϵ3 are no longer in a random coil conformation. It can therefore be seen even by the simple one-dimensional proton NMR spectrum that Cϵ3 adopts a folded conformation on binding to sFcϵRIα. 15N HSQC experiments allow separation of the NMR signal into a second dimension, mapping the backbone amide groups of a protein according to their proton and nitrogen frequencies. Cϵ3 alone shows little chemical shift dispersion in both dimensions, ∼8.3 ppm in the 1H dimension (Fig. 2c). A reduction in temperature causes a decrease in the rate at which these conformations are sampled, reducing the line broadening, but even at lower temperatures, there is still little chemical shift dispersion. On addition of sFcϵRIα, the 15N HSQC for Cϵ3 shows large signal dispersion in both dimensions (Fig. 4b). The number of peaks observed in the 15N HSQC corresponds approximately to the number of residues in Cϵ3. Binding to sFcϵRIα clearly causes Cϵ3 to adopt a folded conformation with stable tertiary structure, rather than sampling a number of related conformations. A similar transition from molten globule state to fully folded conformation on interaction with a binding partner has been noted for a number of other proteins (24Flynn G.C. Beckers C.J. Baase W.A. Dahlquist F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10826-10830Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 25Hornby D.P. Whitmarsh A. Pinarbasi H. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Shore P. Baldwin G.S. Waltho J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In contrast, addition of Cϵ2 to 15N-Cϵ3 does not cause the same large change in chemical shift dispersion in Cϵ3 (Fig. 5). Cϵ3 does not appear to undergo the same transition from molten globule state to fully folded conformation on interaction with Cϵ2. HSQC spectra can be used to map protein-protein interaction surfaces at atomic resolution, by monitoring the perturbation in the position or intensity of the chemical shift on titration of a binding partner. Although the transition to folded conformation of Cϵ3 does not occur on incubation with Cϵ2, a number of cross-peaks in the HSQC spectrum of Cϵ3 apparently shift, appear or disappear on addition of Cϵ2. This indicates that Cϵ2 makes a limited number of local interactions on binding to Cϵ3. In order to investigate this interaction further, the corresponding NMR experiment was carried out, namely, addition of Cϵ3 to 15N-Cϵ2. The effect of adding Cϵ3 into 15N-Cϵ2 can be seen to cause only small perturbations of the HSQC compared with Cϵ2 alone (Fig. 6a). Such an observation indicates there is only a local interaction surface on the Cϵ2 when interacting with Cϵ3 present as a molten globule. Because the structure of Cϵ2 has been solved by NMR (9McDonnell J.M. Calvert R. Beavil R.L. Beavil A.J. Henry A.J. Sutton B.J. Gould H.J. Cowburn D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the backbone amides represented in the HSQC have been assigned. Hence, it is possible to determine where the interaction with Cϵ3 occurs by analysis of the change in intensity of each of the peaks (Fig. 6b). It can be seen that the plot of change in intensity appears relatively noisy; this may reflect some nonspecific aggregation occurring due to exposed hydrophobic residues of Cϵ3 and Cϵ2 that would normally be buried in the IgE. This aggregation is also seen in the difficulty of sample handling, with protein precipitating out of solution through the course of the Cϵ3/Cϵ2 titration. However, the area of greatest intensity change occurs between Gln273 and Asp278 of IgE. From the crystal structure of IgE-Fc (6Wan T. Beavil R.L. Fabiane S.M. Beavil A.J. Sohi M.K. Keown M. Young R.J. Henry A.J. Owens R.J. Gould H.J. Sutton B.J. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), it can be seen that one of the Cϵ2 domains interacts with an unstructured loop at the C-terminal region of Cϵ3 of the other chain (Fig. 6c). Because this interaction site is not dependent on a rigid tertiary structure of Cϵ3, it is likely to occur when Cϵ3 is present as a molten globule. Previously, recombinant Cϵ3 has been shown to bind to sFcϵRIα (17Henry A.J. McDonnell J.M. Ghirlando R. Sutton B.J. Gould H.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7406-7413Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), although no conformational change of Cϵ3 on binding to sFcϵRIα was observed using far-UV CD spectroscopy. We have shown through ANS fluorescence and NMR spectroscopies that Cϵ3 does indeed form a stable tertiary structure on binding to sFcϵRIα. However, this stable Cϵ3 tertiary structure is not formed on interaction with Cϵ2, Cϵ4, or CD23. The observation of this folded state will allow the use of NMR to map interactions of Cϵ3 with a variety of ligands at atomic resolution. In addition, we have validated the use of the ANS fluorescence assay using NMR. Such an assay could form the basis of a rapid method for screening additional ligands in order to identify those that cause the same changes in the tertiary structure of Cϵ3; the effect of candidate ligands could then be explored in more detail by NMR. When considered in the context of the whole IgE molecule, it is probable that the Cϵ3 domains do indeed retain a degree of flexibility, with their structural integrity dependent on interaction with other domains of IgE. The existence of a less structured region within IgE mapping to the interaction site with FcϵRIα has been known for some time (27Dorrington K.J. Bennich H. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 8378-8384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and could offer IgE a mechanism by which it can fine-tune its specificity and affinity according to the protein ligands present physiologically.

Previous in vitro studies have shown that three Sp1 binding sites (around -300) are part of a cytokine-responsive element and that two TC-rich boxes (around -160 and -125) and a CBF/NFY consensus sequence (around -80) confer optimal promoter activity by interacting among themselves and with the upstream Sp1 sites. Here we report that mutations of the Sp1 binding sites, TC-rich boxes or CBF/NFY consensus sequence lead to reduced transgene activity, thus underscoring the functional interdependence of the proximal promoter elements. Loss of the Sp1 binding sites was associated with loss of transgene expression in osteoblasts, whereas elimination of the CBF/NFY binding site (alone or in combination with the TC-rich boxes) was correlated with a lack of activity in the ventral fascia and head dermis and musculature. Additionally, transgene expression in skin fascia fibroblasts depended on the integrity of the Sp1 binding sites and TC-rich boxes, and on their physical configuration. Evidence is also presented suggesting cooperativity between cis-acting elements of the far upstream enhancer and proximal promoter in assembling tissue-specific protein complexes.

Type I collagen, the major structural component of the connective tissue, is produced predominantly by cells of mesenchymal origin in a tightly controlled spatiotemporal manner (1Ramirez F. Di Liberto M. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 1616-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Coordinated biosynthesis of the type I collagen subunits (α1(I) and α2(I) chains) is critically important for morphogenesis and growth, as well as for tissue homeostasis and repair (1Ramirez F. Di Liberto M. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 1616-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Moreover, abnormal activation of the human type I collagen genes (COL1A1 1The abbreviations used are: COL1A1, human α1(I) collagen gene; COL1A2 and Col1a2, human and mouse α2(I) collagen gene, respectively; CyRE, cytokine-responsive element; E, embryonic day; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactosidase. and COL1A2) in response to cytokines and other inflammatory agents is associated with excessive matrix deposition in a variety of fibrotic diseases, including liver cirrhosis, glomerulosclerosis, and scleroderma (2Varga J.

During the past 10 years, the COL1A2 gene has emerged as an informative model system in which to study the molecular mechanisms and cellular factors that control extracellular matrix assembly and function in normal and diseased conditions (4Ghosh A.K.

These studies were broadly based on two experimental “read-outs” of transcriptional regulation, namely cell transfections and transgenic mice. In vitro analyses have documented that a complex array of combinatorial interactions among transcription factors binding to the -378 proximal promoter sequence directs constitutive and cytokine-modulated expression of the COL1A2 gene (4Ghosh A.K.

Specifically, the sequence extending from nucleotides -313 to -183 (also known as the cytokine responsive element or CyRE) has been shown to mediate the antagonistic signals of transforming growth factor-β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interferon-γ through the activation of the Smad, JNK, and JAK/STAT pathways, respectively (7Zhang W.

Furthermore, cooperativity between TC-rich boxes at -173/-155 and -133/-108 and a CBF/NFY recognition sequence at -84/-80, as well as between these elements and the Sp1 sites of the CyRE, has been shown to optimize COL1A2 promoter activity (18Ihn H.

Finally, interferon-γ-responsive elements have been mapped to the 5′ TC-rich box and to the core promoter region (nucleotide +7) in association with binding of YB-1 and the RFX5/CIITA complex, respectively (20Higashi K.

Transgenic mouse work has demonstrated that high and tissue-specific transcription in vivo from the -378 promoter requires the participation of a relatively long (2.3 kb) enhancer element located some 20-kb upstream of the start site of transcription (22Antoniv T.T.

This work has also shown that the proximal promoter is capable by itself of directing collagen I-specific transcription, albeit inefficiently and in a mosaic pattern. Together, these findings were interpreted to indicate that the predominant function of the COL1A2 far upstream enhancer is to broaden and augment tissue-specific transcription from the proximal promoter (22Antoniv T.T. DeVal S. Wells D. Denton C.P. Rabe C. de Crombrugghe B. Ramirez F. Bou-Gharios G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21754-21764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The present study employed the transgenic approach to assess whether the far upstream enhancer could confer tissue specificity on its own, and whether individual elements of the proximal promoter contribute differently to COL1A2 transcription in vivo. The results suggest cooperativity between the far upstream enhancer and the proximal promoter in assembling tissue-specific protein complexes. They confirm in vitro observations indicating that interactions among proximal promoter elements are required for optimal transcription. They also indicate that transcription factors binding to individual promoter elements are responsible for distinct properties of COL1A2 expression in vivo. More generally, the study reiterates the highly combinatorial nature of COL1A2 transcription. DNA Constructs—The control LacZ reporter constructs harboring the far upstream enhancer (from -21.1 to -18.8 kb) and/or the proximal promoter of COL1A2 (from -378 to +52 bp) had been already described (22Antoniv T.T.

Mutant constructs were engineered using PCR amplification to insert single nucleotide substitutions into the various nuclear protein binding sites of the proximal promoter (18Ihn H. Ohnishi K.

Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Canada) (25Kothary R. Clapoff S. Darling S. Perry M.D. Moran L.A. Rossant J. Development. 1989; 10: 707-714Google Scholar). Preparation of linearized plasmid DNA for microinjection was according to the standard protocol (26Nagy A. Gertsenstein M. Vintersten K. Behringer R. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2003: 289-358Google Scholar). Generation and Analysis of Transgenic Embryos—Transgenic embryos were produced by the standard pronuclear injection of DNA into fertilized C57Bl/10 × CBA/Ca or B6C3 F1 eggs (26Nagy A. Gertsenstein M.

Plasmid DNA was digested with appropriate enzymes, purified from agarose gel, and microinjected at a concentration of 2-4 ng/ml in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 0.1 mm EDTA. Embryos were collected from the recipient females mainly at embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5) for whole-mount fixation and staining. This stage was chosen because it is characterized by high Col1a2 activity and to avoid decreased skin permeability because of increased keratinization (27Bou-Gharios G. Garrett L.A. Rossert J.

Positive embryos had comparable numbers of integrated transgenes. After cutting open the thorax and abdomen, embryos were placed in cold phosphate-buffered saline and fixed for 45-60 min in 0.2% glutaraldehyde, 2% formalin in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, containing 2 mm MgCl2 and EGTA. After three washes of 1 h each in the same buffer supplemented with 0.1% sodium deoxycholate and 0.2% Nonidet P-40, embryos were stained overnight at room temperature in 1 mg/ml of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactosidase solution (X-gal) containing 5 mm potassium ferro-cyanide and 5 mm ferricyanide. For the histology, X-gal-positive embryos were dehydrated and wax-embedded, and 6-μm tissue sections were prepared, de-waxed, and counterstained with eosin. Although we originally argued that COL1A2 promoter specificity is enhanced by the far upstream sequence, the data did not exclude the presence of tissue-specific elements in the far upstream enhancer as well (22Antoniv T.T.

To address this important point, we co-injected the linearized 2.3-kb long far upstream enhancer into fertilized mouse eggs together with a construct in which the LacZ reporter was under the control of the minimal heat shock promoter (hsp68lacZpA) (28DiLeone R.J. Marcus G.A. Johnson M.D. Kingsley D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1612-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Unlike transgenic embryos harboring only hsp68lacZpA (Fig. 1A1), those in which the heterologous promoter and COL1A2 far upstream enhancer had co-integrated into the genome (n = 7) consistently showed β-galactosidase activity that varied among different transgenes (Fig. 1, A2 and A3). Irrespective of the degree of transgene expression, LacZ was only transcribed in collagen I-producing tissues. For example, skin fascia, osteoblasts, and muscle were X-gal-positive in the highest transgene expressor but not to the same degree as in the transgene with the homologous promoter (Fig. 1, B-F). Together with our earlier results (22Antoniv T.T. DeVal S. Wells D. Denton C.P. Rabe C. de Crombrugghe B. Ramirez F. Bou-Gharios G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21754-21764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), these data suggested that tissue-specific determinants may reside within both the proximal promoter and far upstream enhancer of COL1A2. Next, we examined the transcriptional contribution of individual cis-acting elements in the proximal promoter within the context of the interaction with the far upstream enhancer. Accordingly, we engineered transgenic LacZ constructs containing the 2.3-kb far upstream enhancer sequence linked to mutant versions of the proximal promoter (Fig. 2A). The mutations included nucleotide substitutions in the three Sp1 binding sites of the CyRE (SPm transgene), in the binding sites of the two TC-rich boxes (TCm transgene), and in the CBF/NFY recognition sequence (CBm transgene) (Fig. 2B) (18Ihn H.

Science. 1988; 241: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Fifteen-and-a-half-day-old founder embryos (E15.5) were examined for transcriptional activity (as indicated by the overall intensity of whole-mount β-galactosidase staining) and for tissue distribution of LacZ activity (as monitored by histological analyses of β-galactosidase-positive embryos). All transgenic embryos were processed under the same experimental conditions to ensure reliable comparisons within and among transgenic constructs. Moreover, the activity of each mutant transgene was compared with that of the lines containing the wild-type enhancer and/or proximal promoter (22Antoniv T.T. DeVal S. Wells D. Denton C.P. Rabe C. de Crombrugghe B. Ramirez F. Bou-Gharios G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21754-21764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). SPm transgenics (n = 8) were found to express LacZ significantly less than the wild-type construct (Fig. 3, A1 and A2). Histological examination of β-galactosidase-positive embryos revealed great variability among different transgenic embryos, with distinct combinations of collagen I-producing cells displaying a mosaic pattern of transgene expression. Specifically, we found that β-galactosidase activity was relatively strong and uniform in the meninges, intercostal muscles, and kidney (Fig. 3, B-E). By contrast, no transgene expression was detected in osteoblasts or skin fascia fibroblasts (Fig. 3, B and D). These results suggested that the CyRE mutation impairs transgene expression in osteoblasts and skin fascia fibroblasts in addition to reducing the overall strength of the enhancer/promoter interaction. On average, the expression of positive embryos harboring the TCm construct (n = 3) was similar to that of the SPm embryos (Fig. 4, A1 and A2). Like them, there was no detectable LacZ activity in fascia mesenchymal cells (Fig. 4C). Unlike SPm embryos, mutations in the TC-rich boxes had little or no effect on transgene expression in osteoblasts (Fig. 4, B and D). Finally, TCm transgene activity was relatively higher in the lower back of the embryos (Fig. 4, A1 and A2). We concluded from these results that the TC-rich boxes of the proximal promoter contribute to COL1A2 expression in skin fascia fibroblasts but not in osteoblasts. The transcriptional strength of CBm transgenes (n = 4) was slightly higher than the SPm and TCm embryos (Fig. 5, A1 and A2). Unlike either of them, the CBm transgene was transcribed in both osteoblasts and skin fascia fibroblasts (Fig. 5, B-E). Interestingly, half of the CBm expressors exhibited a rather unique X-gal staining pattern characterized by intense labeling of the posterior region of the body and tail, with an almost defined boundary in the ventral side of the animals (Fig. 5A2). Histological sections confirmed this conclusion by showing an abrupt transition in skin fascia from cells expressing the transgene on the dorsal side to those negative on the ventral side (Fig. 5D). The transition was not correlated with changes in cell morphology or tissue organization. The CBm expression pattern thus supported the previous conclusions from the SPm and TCm transgenics that the CyRE complex contributes to osteoblast specificity and that factors binding to the CyRE and TC-rich boxes may cooperate in conferring skin fascia specificity. Additionally, the results raised the intriguing possibility that CBF/NFY may be involved in determining the pattern of COL1A2 expression in mesenchymal tissues. The last set of transgenic experiments was designed to provide independent validation for the last conclusion. Accordingly, two enhancer-containing transgenic constructs were engineered that harbored two distinct mutations in the region downstream of the CyRE. The first transgene (TC;CBm) contained nucleotide substitutions in both TC-rich boxes and CBF/NFY consensus sequence, whereas the CyRE region of the second transgene (TC;CBΔ) was artificially juxtaposed to the TATA box by deleting the sequence encompassing the TC-boxes and the CBF/NFY consensus sequence (Fig. 2). Both mutations led to higher β-galactosidase activity than mutations in individual promoter elements (Figs. 6 and 7, A). Additionally, TC; CBm and TC;CBΔ were expressed with the same rostral-ventral exclusion pattern as seen in half of the CBm embryos (Figs. 6 and 7, A). Histological analysis confirmed this similarity by showing X-gal staining in some internal organs, muscles, and bones (Figs. 6, C and D and 7, B-D) but not in the ventral portion of skin fascia (Figs. 6B and 7, G and H). This marked boundary was more evident in older (E16.5) TC;CBΔ embryos in which the dermis is more mature (Fig. 7, A1 and E). Another example of differential expression of the TC;CBΔ transgene at comparable anatomical locations was the strong X-gal staining of skeletal muscles in the hind limbs and the lack of such staining in the forelimbs (Fig. 7D). There was no detectable transgenic activity in the head region rostrally to shoulder level (Figs. 6 and 7, A). These observations thus inferred that CBF/NFY binding to a specific element of the proximal promoter contributes to patterned COL1A2 expression.Fig. 7Representative β-galactosidase staining of E16.5 (A1) and E15.5 (A2) TC;CBΔ embryos. Histological sections showing positive osteoblasts in the frontal bone (B, arrow) and maxilla (C) but not in Meckel's cartilage (c). Skeletal muscles of the hind limbs but not forelimbs are strongly stained (D and G, m). A distinct pattern of fascia staining in the back skin (F, f) is contrasted with ventral sections (E, arrows) in which body muscle is positive (m). In F, the arrow indicates the abrupt interruption of the staining in fascia.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) During the past 10 years, a large body of in vitro and in vivo studies have delineated the regulatory network of COL1A2 as consisting of multiple and overlapping nuclear protein binding sites, which are located in a distal enhancer, the proximal promoter, and the core promoter region (4Ghosh A.K. Exp. Biol. Med. 2002; 227: 301-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 6Verrecchia F. Mauviel A. Cell Signal. 2004; 16: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The present study advances our understanding of COL1A2 transcriptional regulation by providing new insights into the contribution of the enhancer and promoter interaction to tissue specificity. The conclusions discussed below relied on the analysis of COL1A2 transgenes according to the relative strength and cell-type specificity of LacZ expression. Previously we reported that the -378 COL1A2 promoter drives low transgene expression in a number of collagen I-producing cells, including osteoblasts (22Antoniv T.T. DeVal S. Wells D. Denton C.P. Rabe C. de Crombrugghe B. Ramirez F. Bou-Gharios G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21754-21764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Here we showed that the far upstream enhancer confers some collagen I specificity to the otherwise inactive hsp68 promoter. However, the higher variability in transgene expression seen with the far upstream enhancer in combination with the heterologous promoter, as opposed to the homologous promoter, strongly suggests that hsp68 lacks the requirements to stabilize this interaction. We therefore propose that complementary elements in the far upstream enhancer and proximal promoter cooperate in promoting optimal and tissue-specific expression of COL1A2. This hypothesis is in line with the emerging “enhanceosome” model whereby synergism between proteins distantly bound to DNA leads to a stereospecific multiprotein assembly on the promoter, which induces and/or stabilizes DNA looping and regulates transcription (29Ogata K. Sato K. Tahirov T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Our data also raise the possibility that the equivalent regulatory network of the mouse Col1a2 gene may not be organized exactly in the same way. First, we have found that the Col1a2 enhancer instructs hsp68 transcription in all collagen I-producing cells except osteoblasts (data not shown). Second, we did observe that osteoblasts very seldom express LacZ in transgenes containing only the -350 Col1a2 promoter sequence (27Bou-Gharios G. Garrett L.A. Rossert J. Niederreither K.

Another aim of the present study was to delineate the in vivo role of proximal promoter elements previously identified using the cell transfection approach (7Zhang W. Ou J. Inagaki Y. Greenwel P.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3712-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This is a particularly important goal if one were to translate the knowledge of COL1A2 regulation into new therapeutic modalities against fibrotic diseases (30Inagaki Y. Higashi K. Nemoto T. Kushida M. Okzaki I. Connect. Tissue Res. 2003; 35: 193-200Google Scholar, 31Varga J. Curr. Rheumatol. Rep. 2004; 6: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The loss of constitutive expression and cytokine response of transfected plasmids harboring mutations in the Sp1 binding sites of the CyRE have underscored the critical role of this transcription factor in COL1A2 regulation (23Tamaki T. Ohnishi K. Hartl C. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4299-4304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 32Inagaki Y. Truter S. Tanaka S. Di Liberto M. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3353-3358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Similar analyses have also inferred cooperative interaction(s) between Sp1 bound to the CyRE and Sp1/Sp3 and CBF/NFY bound to the downstream DNA elements (18Ihn H. Ohnishi K. Tamaki T. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26717-26723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 19Ihn H. Trojanowska M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3712-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The finding that mutations introduced in each of these binding sites reduce transgene activity is strong evidence that these protein interactions operate in vivo as well, and in concert with the enhancer-bound complex. The results are also consistent with implicating the CyRE-bound Sp1 in conferring bone specificity to the COL1A2 transgene. By contrast, the consequences of the mutations on skin fascia fibroblast expression are more difficult to interpret without invoking a contribution by the physical configuration of the promoter elements, and by the relative affinity of the binding proteins (33Fiering S. Whitelaw E. Martin D.I.K. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). On the one hand, loss of skin fascia expression in SPm and TCm transgenes would suggest that both DNA elements are required for fibroblast activity. On the other hand, skin fascia expression by the TC;CBm and TC;CBΔ transgenes would indicate a predominant role of the CyRE complex in driving fibroblast activity. We believe that this apparent discrepancy may reflect the fact that both the physical configuration of the promoter elements and the relative affinity of the binding proteins contribute to transgene activity (33Fiering S. Whitelaw E. Martin D.I.K. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We rest our belief on two correlative lines of evidence. First, the higher activity of the TC;CBm or TC;CBΔ constructs compared with those harboring mutations in only one of the two elements is consistent with earlier in vitro data suggesting multiple levels of both negative and positive interactions among the proximal promoter elements (18Ihn H. Ohnishi K. Tamaki T. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26717-26723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 19Ihn H. Trojanowska M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3712-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We therefore concur with these earlier studies in proposing that the nucleotide substitutions in the downstream elements may relieve some CyRE repression, thus restoring fibroblast activity. Second, the relatively higher X-gal-staining intensity of TC;CBΔ compared with TCm;CBm points to the involvement of promoter configuration (as evidenced by the closer proximity of the CyRE-bound factors to the TATA box) in determining the strength of the promoter/enhancer interaction and, implicitly, cell type-specific levels of transgene expression. Another intriguing finding of this study was the unique expression pattern of transgenic mice harboring mutations in the binding site of transcription factor CBF/NFY. Originally identified as a common regulator of the type I collagen genes, this heterotrimeric protein has been more recently shown to be absolutely required for embryonic development and also to be involved in chromatin remodeling (24Maity S.N. Golumbek P.T. Karsenty G. de Crombrugghe B. Science. 1988; 241: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 34Coustry F. Hu Q. de Crombrugghe B. Maity S.N. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8167-8172PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that nucleotide substitutions that abrogate CBF/NFY binding, alone or in combination with mutations in the TC-rich boxes, lead to loss of LacZ expression in the ventral and head regions of the dermis, as well as in the muscles of the forelimbs. The patterning of specific cell lineages implies that CBF/NFY may be essential for COL1A2 activity in those cells that do not express the transgene. It is worth noting that the dermal cell lineage in the ventral and fascial regions, which are LacZ negative, have a distinct embryonic origin from those of the dorsal region, which are LacZ positive. Although cells of the lateral and ventral dermis of the trunk originate from the somatopleura mesoderm and express dermo1, those of the dorsolateral dermis derive from the dermatome and express Msx1 (36Houzelstein D. Chéraud Y. Auda-Boucher G. Fontaine-Pérus J. Benoît R. Development. 2000; 127: 2155-2164PubMed Google Scholar). Our transgenic data therefore raise the intriguing possibility that CBF/NFY may be implicated in determining the pattern of COL1A2 expression in some mesenchyme cell lineages through a yet to be defined mechanism. In conclusion, this study is the first to elucidate the transcriptional roles of the cis-acting elements of the COL1A2 proximal promoter within a chromatin context and in relationship to the far upstream enhancer interaction. It is also the first to provide strong evidence indicating that the interaction is likely to be mediated by complementary sets of tissue-specific determinants leading to the assembly of a functional enhanceosome. Other DNA elements have been identified that need to be re-evaluated within the same in vivo context before a full account of the COL1A2 regulatory network is attained. They include the methylation dependent core promoter site, which modulates polII access to the transcription start site, the c-Myb binding sites at around -1.2 kb, which may be involved in scleroderma pathogenesis, and the sequences around evolutionarily conserved and unique DNase I hypersensitive sites (21Xu Y.

Harkey M.A. Torok-Storb B. Blood. 2002; 99: 507-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). These studies collectively support a role for ABCG2/Bcrp-1 in the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells and suggest that its forced overexpression may prove useful as a strategy for improving the contribution of genetically modified cells toward hematopoiesis as an in vivo selection strategy.Zhou et al. (4Zhou S. Schuetz J.D. Bunting K.D. Colapietro A.M. Sampath J. Morris J.J. Lagutina I. Grosveld G.C. Osawa M. Nakauchi H. Sorrentino B.P. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1028-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (1970) Google Scholar) reported that overexpression human ABCG2 in mouse bone marrow cells significantly blocked hematopoietic development leading to speculation that ABCG2/Bcrp-1 expression may play a role in early stem cell self-renewal by blocking differentiation. In contrast, overexpression of the related membrane transporter, human MDR1, resulted in HSC expansion and a myeloproliferative disease in mice (14Bunting K.D. Zhou S. Lu T. Sorrentino B.P. Blood. 2000; 96: 902-909Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Bunting K.D. Galipeau J. Topham D. Benaim E. Sorrentino B.P. Blood. 1998; 92: 2269-2279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, deletion of the murine homologue of ABCG2/Bcrp1 resulted in a marked decrease in the number of SP cells in the marrow, yet stem cell activity was not affected (16Zhou S. Morris J.J. Barnes Y. Lan L. Schuetz J.D. Sorrentino B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12339-12344Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Still, little is known regarding ABCG2 function in the hematopoietic compartment in primates.We therefore sought to determine the effects of forced expression of the ABCG2 gene in the nonhuman primate model, a model with proven relevance to human hematopoiesis. Toward this end, we cloned the full-length rhesus ABCG2 (Rh-ABCG2) cDNA and constructed an RD114-pseudotyped MFGS-ABCG2 retroviral vector along with a control vector. The present study demonstrates the first direct evidence that overexpression of ABCG2 in large animal bone marrow stem cells does not interfere with hematopoietic stem cell maturation in vivo. Furthermore, forced expression confers protection to mitoxantrone in vitro. These results suggest that overexpression of ABCG2 may be feasible as an in vivo selection strategy for gene therapy applications.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRhesus ABCG2 Cloning—Rhesus ABCG2 (Rh-ABCG2) cDNA was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from rhesus kidney, which expresses high levels of ABCG2. Total RNA was isolated from rhesus kidney using RNA STAT-60 (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX) with DNase and reverse-transcribed to cDNA with the SuperScript™ first strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). Rh-ABCG2 cDNA was amplified with Advantage 2 polymerase (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using a series of overlapping primers spanning the entire sequence designed using the published human sequence. Each PCR product was then cloned using the TOPO TA® cloning kit (Invitrogen). All of the sequences were confirmed using an ABI PRISM ™310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). After each clone was cut by the enzyme (SpeI, BshNI, and Eco72I), clones were ligated using the Rapid DNA ligation kit (Roche Applied Science) to make full-length Rh-ABCG2 cDNA. Sequence homology was 97% at the cDNA level and 96% at the protein level compared with that of human ABCG2 sequence (GenBank™ accession number AY841878).Generation of an RD114-pseudotyped MFGS-ABCG2 Retrovirus Producer Cell Line—To generate MFGS-Rh-ABCG2 vectors, Rh-ABCG2 cDNA was amplified with primers containing the 3′ BamHI site (5′-TTCGGGATCCCAAAGTGCTTCTTTTT-3′) and the 5′ PciI site (5′-GACAGACATGTCTTCCAGTAATGT-3′) with Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The PCR product was cloned using the TOPO TA® cloning kit (Invitrogen) and inserted into the NcoI-BamHI cloning site of MFGS as depicted in Fig. 1 (17Li F. Linton G.F. Sekhsaria S. Whiting-Theobald N. Katkin J.P. Gallin J.I. Malech H.L. Blood. 1994; 84: 53-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Tsai E.J. Malech H.L. Kirby M.R. Hsu A.P. Seidel N.E. Porada C.D. Zanjani E.D.

VSVG-pseudotyped MFGS-ABCG2 producer cells were made by transfection of 3T3 cells with the MFGS-ABCG2 plasmid, gag, pol, and env (VSVG) genes by calcium phosphate coprecipitation. RD114-pseudotyped MFGS-ABCG2 was then prepared by transducing the FLYRD18 packaging cell line (19Cosset F.L. Takeuchi Y. Battini J.L. Weiss R.A. Collins M.K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7430-7436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with supernatant from VSVG-pseudotyped MFGS-Rh-ABCG2 (20Brenner S. Whiting-Theobald N.L. Linton G.F. Holmes K.L. Anderson-Cohen M. Kelly P.F. Vanin E.F. Pilon A.M. Bodine D.M. Horwitz M.E. Malech H.L. Blood. 2003; 102: 2789-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Transduced cells were sorted after immunofluorescent staining with a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-human ABCG2 monoclonal antibody (clone 5D3; Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada) on a FACS Vantage flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). The brightest cells were plated at limiting dilution. A high titer producer clone was then selected, and a stable virus-transduced cell line was established. The control vector was constructed in an identical fashion and expresses the human gp91phox, a phagocyte oxidase subunit deficient in X-linked chronic granulomatous disease (20Brenner S. Whiting-Theobald N.L. Linton G.F. Holmes K.L. Anderson-Cohen M. Kelly P.F. Vanin E.F. Pilon A.M. Bodine D.M. Horwitz M.E. Malech H.L.

FLYRD18 MFGS vector producers were plated at 2 × 106/162-cm2 flask for 48–60 h with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 4 mm l-glutamine, penicillin (50 mg/ml), and streptomycin (50 mg/ml) (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2, and virus supernatant was collected. We performed transductions with RD114-pseudotyped vector particles separated from conditioned medium by ultracentrifugation (83,000 × g, 90 min, 4 °C) (20Brenner S. Whiting-Theobald N.L. Linton G.F. Holmes K.L. Anderson-Cohen M. Kelly P.F. Vanin E.F. Pilon A.M. Bodine D.M. Horwitz M.E. Malech H.L. Blood. 2003; 102: 2789-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). After ultracentrifugation, the viral pellet was suspended with 1% of the original volume of serum-free X-VIVO 10 (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) with 1% human serum albumin (20Brenner S. Whiting-Theobald N.L. Linton G.F. Holmes K.L. Anderson-Cohen M. Kelly P.F. Vanin E.F. Pilon A.M. Bodine D.M. Horwitz M.E. Malech H.L. Blood. 2003; 102: 2789-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Fresh vector supernatant was passed through a 0.22-μm filter (Nalgene) to remove cellular contamination before ultracentrifugation. Virus titer of the original neat supernatant determined on CD34+ PBPCs by terminal dilution studies was 2–4 × 106 infectious units/ml for both MFGS-ABCG2 and MFGS-gp91phox RD114-pseudotyped vectors, respectively. Cultures were initiated in Retronectin (Takara Shuzo, Otsu, Japan) precoated 6-well plates with 4 × 105 CD34+ PBPCs in 2 ml of growth medium (serum-free X-VIVO 10 with 1% human serum albumin; 100 ng/ml Flt-3 ligand, 100 ng/ml stem cell factor, 100 ng/ml thrombopoietin)/well. Beginning 16 h after culture initiation, CD34+ PBPCs were transduced 15 h/day over 3 days using dilutions of concentrated virus vector equivalent to 8 × 106 to 1 × 107 infectious units (2–5-fold concentrated from the original neat supernatant) with 5 μg/ml protamine sulfate (Sigma), whereas gp91phox-transduced CD34+ PBPCs served as control for native ABCG2 expression (17Li F. Linton G.F. Sekhsaria S. Whiting-Theobald N. Katkin J.P. Gallin J.I. Malech H.L. Blood. 1994; 84: 53-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kang E.M. de Witte M. Malech H. Morgan R.A. Phang S. Carter C.

Recombinant human Flt-3 ligand, stem cell factor, and thrombopoietin were purchased from RDI (Flanders, NJ). The percentage of cells expressing CD34 or both CD34 and CXCR4, the receptor for the chemokine SDF-1 involved in stem cell homing (22Lapidot T. Petit I. Exp. Hematol. 2002; 30: 973-981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar), was determined after transduction by flow cytometry using a FITC-conjugated anti-human CD34 antibody (clone 8G12) and a phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CXCR4 antibody (clone 12G5), respectively (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, San Jose, CA).Analysis of Transgene Expression and Hoechst Efflux Studies by Flow Cytometry—1 × 106 transduced cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.5% bovine serum albumin. After blocking of surface Fc receptors, the cells were incubated with FITC anti-human ABCG2. Human gp91phox expression was determined by indirect staining with murine monoclonal antibody 7D5 followed by FITC-conjugated goat antimouse IgG antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) (20Brenner S. Whiting-Theobald N.L. Linton G.F. Holmes K.L. Anderson-Cohen M. Kelly P.F. Vanin E.F. Pilon A.M. Bodine D.M. Horwitz M.E. Malech H.L. Blood. 2003; 102: 2789-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Transduced cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer and Cellquest software (Becton Dickinson) to determine the percentage of transgene expression in human CD34+ PBPCs. All of the antibody incubations were carried out for 30 min on ice. Rhesus and human SP cell analyses were performed exactly as described (2Goodell M.A. Rosenzweig M. Kim H. Marks D.F. DeMaria M. Paradis G. Grupp S.A. Sieff C.A. Mulligan R.C. Johnson R.P. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1337-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). At least 100,000 events were collected for each analysis. For the inhibitor experiments, fumitremorgin C (FTC) (the kind gift of S. Bates, National Institutes of Health), which is an ABCG2-selective inhibitor (23Rabindran S.K. He H. Singh M. Brown E. Collins K.I. Annable T. Greenberger L.M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5850-5858PubMed Google Scholar, 24Rabindran S.K. Ross D.D. Doyle L.A. Yang W. Greenberger L.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 47-50PubMed Google Scholar), was added to the cells at a final concentration at 10 μm. The cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 20 min before Hoechst staining. For antibody staining of Hoechst stained cells, all of the cells were resuspended into 100 μl of Hanks' balanced saline solution, 1 mm HEPES, 2% fetal calf serum (HBSS+) medium and incubated with FITC-conjugated rhesus lineage panel antibodies comprising CD3 (Becton Dickinson), CD20 (Becton Dickinson), and CD11b (Multenyi Biotec). After washing, the cells were resuspended into 0.5 ml of HBSS+ containing 2 μg/ml propidium iodide and analyzed on a FACS vantage flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson).Rhesus Cell Harvesting, Transduction, and Transplantation—Young rhesus macaques were housed and handled in accordance with the guidelines set by the Committee on Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, National Research Council, and the protocol was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the NHLBI, National Institutes of Health. Mobilized PB cells were harvested by apheresis and CD34-enriched as previously described (25Hanazono Y. Brown K.E. Handa A. Metzger M.E. Heim D. Kurtzman G.J. Donahue R.E. Dunbar C.E. Blood. 1999; 94: 2263-2270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For each animal, CD34-selected cells were divided into two equal fractions and transduced with either the ABCG2 or gp91phox vector as described above with concentrated vector supernatant (RQ3545, 3.5-fold; RQ3549, 8-fold) and infused fresh. The animals received lethal myeloablation and supportive care as previously described (26Nienhuis A.W. Donahue R.E. Karlsson S. Clark S.C. Agricola B. Antinoff N. Pierce J.E. Turner P. Anderson W.F. Nathan D.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 573-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).Δ to CFU Assay—An aliquot of cells pre- and post-CD34 selection as well as an aliquot of cells post-transduction were plated in MethoCult H4230 (Stem Cell Technologies) as previously described (27Tisdale J.F. Hanazono Y. Sellers S.E. Agricola B.A. Metzger M.E. Donahue R.E. Dunbar C.E. Blood. 1998; 92: 1131-1141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty-four colonies from each of the post-transduction samples plated were analyzed for the presence of the transferred gene by PCR (27Tisdale J.F. Hanazono Y. Sellers S.E. Agricola B.A. Metzger M.E. Donahue R.E. Dunbar C.E. Blood. 1998; 92: 1131-1141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Quantitative Real Time PCR Analysis—PB and BM samples were obtained at regular time points following recovery. Granulocyte (G) and mononuclear cells (MNC) were isolated as previously described (27Tisdale J.F. Hanazono Y. Sellers S.E. Agricola B.A. Metzger M.E. Donahue R.E. Dunbar C.E. Blood. 1998; 92: 1131-1141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The contribution to engraftment by ABCG2 and gp91phox vector-transduced cells was determined by real time PCR analysis with a SYBER® Green reporter as previously described (21Kang E.M. de Witte M.

The primer sequences for the ABCG2 vector were: forward primer (GGACCATCCTCTAGACTGCCAT) and reverse primer (CCTTCCGGTCATTGGAAGTTG), using the standard setting of 40 cycles with an annealing temperature of 60 °C by real time PCR using SYBER® Green PCR core reagents (PE Biosystems Warrington, UK). For the gp91phox vector, internal primers were used by amplifying the purified products of the outer reaction. The primer sequences for the gp91phox vector for the outer reaction were: forward primer (GCCGACACCAGACTAAGAAC) and reverse primer (GTGTGAATCGCAGAGTGAAG), and the cycle conditions were 95 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 0.5 min, and 72 °C for 1 min for eight cycles amplified with Advantage 2 polymerase PCR kit. The primer sequences for the inner reaction were: forward primer (GTGAAGGCTGCCGACCC) and reverse primer (CCAAACCAGAATGACAAAAATGG), using the standard setting of 40 cycles with an annealing temperature of 60 °C.Cytotoxicity Assay—Rhesus CD34+ PBPCs were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates and transduced under identical conditions with either the ABCG2 or control vector (n = 2). Mitoxantrone was then added at 0, 10, 25, 50, or 100 nm, and the cells were cultured for an additional 4 days. The percentage of living cells remaining was determined by flow cytometry after the addition of propidium iodide (2 μg/ml). To determine whether selection for ABCG2 expressing cells occurred during exposure to mitoxantrone, transduced cells were analyzed for ABCG2 expression after culture in the presence of 25 nm mitoxantrone and compared with those cultured in its absence.Statistical Analysis—The data are presented as the means ± standard deviation. The statistical significance of the data was determined by Student's t test. The significance level was set at 0.05.RESULTSConcentrated RD114-MFGS-ABCG2 and gp91phox Achieves High Transduction of Human CD34+ PBPC, and Rh-ABCG2-transduced CD34+ Cells Adopt an SP Phenotype—Gene transfer rates to CFU of greater than 70% were estimated by colony PCR analysis (data not shown). Fig. 2 (A and B) shows representative FACS analyses demonstrating high level expression of both Rh-ABCG2 and gp91phox. Fig. 2 (C–E) demonstrates analysis for the SP phenotype among mobilized human PB CD34 + cells transduced with either the control or ABCG2 vector or that performed with FTC. Among gp91phox-transduced cells, SP cells were detectable at only 0.03%. In contrast, greater than 50% of cells transduced with Rh-ABCG2 were of the SP phenotype, and these results matched that estimated by flow using the anti-ABCG2 antibody. Functional expression of Rh-ABCG2 was confirmed by blocking with FTC. These data demonstrate that forced expression of the Rh-ABCG2 gene results in a marked increase in the number of SP cells.Fig. 2A, expression of Rh-ABCG2 among transduced human CD34+ cells.

The overall percentage of cells expressing CD34 or both CD34 and CXCR4 was, however, higher after transduction with the Rh-ABCG2 vector compared with the control (CD34, 44.5 ± 11.7% versus 28.8 ± 12.58%; CD34 and CXCR4, 22.0 ± 8.60% versus 11.2 ± 7.14%; n = 5; Fig. 2G). On the other hand, the reduction in cell growth over the Rh-ABCG2 transduction resulted in equivalence the absolute number of CD34/CXCR4+ cells between the Rh-ABCG2 and control transduced fractions (CD34+, 3.7 ± 1.7 versus 4.3 ± 2.7 × 105; CD34/CXCR4+, 1.8 ± 0.97 versus 1.6 ± 1.1 × 105; n = 5; Fig. 2H). Additionally, there were no differences noted between the Rh-ABCG2- and gp91phox-transduced cells with respect to plating efficiency (52 ± 4.8 versus 43.8 ± 6.1 total CFU/500 cells plated for ABCG2- and gp91phox-transduced cells, respectively; n = 3; p = 0.076). These findings demonstrate that Rh-ABCG2 overexpression results in diminished growth in vitro but does not inhibit the differentiation of hematopoietic colony-forming progenitors.RD114-MFGS-Rh-ABCG2- and gp91phox-transduced Rhesus PB CD34 Cells Contribute Equally to Hematopoietic Reconstitution after Lethal Irradiation—The transplantation schema is depicted in Fig. 3A. Table I summarizes the apheresis yield, CD34 yield, CD34 enrichment, CFU transduction efficiency, and infused cell number. Approximately 95% of the separated cells were CD34+ (data not shown). Both animals engrafted rapidly, with neutrophil counts of more than 500 cells/μl by day 10. Fig. 3(B and C) shows amplification results and a standard curve for the dilutions of a known Rh-ABCG2 copy number into a background of nontransduced rhesus peripheral blood by real time PCR. Fig. 4 shows the real time PCR estimates for the overall level of engraftment by genetically modified cells in both animals. The percentage of cells containing either vector reached stable levels of 0.05–0.4% in both animals with no difference between engraftment levels by either the Rh-ABCG2 or control vector transduced cells 7 months after transplantation.Fig. 3Rhesus macaques underwent mobilization with rHu-stem cell factor and rHu-granulocyte colony-stimulating factor for 5 consecutive days. The mobilized PBPCs were collected by apheresis and CD34-enriched. The CD34-positive cells were split into two equal fractions and transduced with either of two equivalent titer retroviral vectors, one carrying the Rh-ABCG2 gene and the other carrying gp91phox. The cells were transduced on three occasions with a daily15-h exposure during the final 3 days of a 4-day culture on retronectin-coated flasks in the presence of Flt-3 ligand, thrombopoietin, and stem cell factor. At the end of transduction, the cells were collected and infused simultaneously into the irradiated monkey (A). Amplification results as obtained by real time PCR using MFGS-ABCG2 specific primers for the dilutions of a known copy number of the MFGS-Rh-ABCG2 producer cell DNA ranging from 100 to 0.01% in a background of nontransduced rhesus DNA is shown (B). The curves represent the number of cycles required for each sample to reach the level of detection. The negative control is the background DNA used in the aforementioned dilution. A standard curve by the control dilution is shown (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table ITransplant characteristic"

https://openalex.org/W2066400821,"Abstract Aspergilloglutamic peptidase (formerly called aspergillopepsin II) is an acid endopeptidase produced by Aspergillus niger var. macrosporus, with a novel catalytic dyad of a glutamic acid and a glutamine residue, thus belonging to a novel peptidase family G1. The mature enzyme is generated from its precursor by removal of the putative 41-residue propeptide and an 11-residue intervening peptide through autocatalytic activation. In the present study, the propeptide (Ala1–Asn41) and a series of its truncated peptides were chemically synthesized, and their effects on the enzyme activity and thermal stability were examined to identify the sequences and residues in the propeptide most critical to the inhibition and thermal stabilization. The synthetic propeptide was shown to be a potent competitive inhibitor of the enzyme (Ki = 27 nm at pH 4.0). Various shorter propeptide fragments derived from the central region of the propeptide had significant inhibitory effect, whereas their Ala scan-substituted peptides, especially R19A and H20A, showed only weak inhibition. Substitution of the Pro23-Pro24 sequence near His20 with an Ala-Ala sequence changed the peptide Lys18–Tyr25 to a substrate with His20 as the P1 residue. Furthermore, the propeptide was shown to be able to significantly protect the enzyme from thermal denaturation (ΔTm = ∼19 °C at pH 5.6). The protective potencies of the propeptide as well as truncated propeptides and their Ala scan-substituted peptides are parallel with their inhibitory potencies. These results indicate that the central part, and especially Arg19 and His20 therein, of the propeptide is most critical to the inhibition and thermal stabilization and that His20 interacts with the enzyme at or near the S1 site in a nonproductive fashion."
https://openalex.org/W2089368866,"The balance between matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMP) is important for extracellular matrix interactions of hematopoietic cells. MMP-independent growth modulating activity for TIMP-1 on B lymphocytes and erythroid progenitors has also been described, but a role for TIMP-1 in myelomonocytic differentiation has not been previously reported. In this study, we demonstrate that TIMP-1 overexpression impairs differentiation of the myeloblastic M1 cell line following interleukin (IL)-6 stimulation. We generated retroviral vectors coexpressing human TIMP-1 and the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and stably transduced murine M1 myeloid cells. TIMP-1 expressing cells showed a large reduction in IL-6-induced macrophage differentiation in vitro that was reversible with a specific monoclonal antibody. The differentiation delay in M1/TIMP-1 cells was also specifically reversible by pharmacologic phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3-K) inhibition. Additionally, overexpression of a TIMP-1/GFP fusion protein also impaired M1 differentiation and this protein was localized to the cell surface, consistent with an autocrine receptor-mediated mechanism. Surprisingly, TIMP-1 transduced cells had a selective advantage for growth in IL-6, indicating that functional effects on growth and differentiation of M1 cells were primarily through an autocrine mechanism. Intrinsic TIMP-1 expression in myeloid leukemia cells might thus impact upon survival or differentiation."
