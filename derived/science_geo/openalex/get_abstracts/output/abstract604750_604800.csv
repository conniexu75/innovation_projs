https://openalex.org/W2790768464,"Analysis of chromatin accessibility can reveal transcriptional regulatory sequences, but heterogeneity of primary tissues poses a significant challenge in mapping the precise chromatin landscape in specific cell types. Here we report single-nucleus ATAC-seq, a combinatorial barcoding-assisted single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin that is optimized for use on flash-frozen primary tissue samples. We apply this technique to the mouse forebrain through eight developmental stages. Through analysis of more than 15,000 nuclei, we identify 20 distinct cell populations corresponding to major neuronal and non-neuronal cell types. We further define cell-type-specific transcriptional regulatory sequences, infer potential master transcriptional regulators and delineate developmental changes in forebrain cellular composition. Our results provide insight into the molecular and cellular dynamics that underlie forebrain development in the mouse and establish technical and analytical frameworks that are broadly applicable to other heterogeneous tissues. This study describes single-nucleus ATAC-seq, a method to profile open chromatin in individual nuclei from frozen tissues. It is used to examine gene regulation in 15,000 nuclei comprising 20 distinct cell types in the developing mouse forebrain."

https://openalex.org/W2787519262,"RAF family kinases have prominent roles in cancer. Their activation is dependent on dimerization of their kinase domains, which has emerged as a hindrance for drug development. In mammals, RAF family kinases include three catalytically competent enzymes (ARAF, BRAF and CRAF) and two pseudokinases (KSR1 and KSR2) that have been described as scaffolds owing to their apparent ability to bridge RAF isoforms and their substrate, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK). Kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR) pseudokinases were also shown to dimerize with kinase-competent RAFs to stimulate catalysis allosterically. Although GTP-bound RAS can modulate the dimerization of RAF isoforms by engaging their RAS-binding domains, KSR1 and KSR2 lack an RAS-binding domain and therefore the regulatory principles underlying their dimerization with other RAF family members remain unknown. Here we show that the selective heterodimerization of BRAF with KSR1 is specified by direct contacts between the amino-terminal regulatory regions of each protein, comprising in part a novel domain called BRS in BRAF and the coiled-coil-sterile α motif (CC-SAM) domain in KSR1. We also discovered that MEK binding to the kinase domain of KSR1 asymmetrically drives BRAF-KSR1 heterodimerization, resulting in the concomitant stimulation of BRAF catalytic activity towards free MEK molecules. These findings demonstrate that KSR-MEK complexes allosterically activate BRAF through the action of N-terminal regulatory region and kinase domain contacts and challenge the accepted role of KSR as a scaffold for MEK recruitment to RAF."
https://openalex.org/W2789862286,"Addiction is proposed to arise from alterations in synaptic strength via mechanisms of long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD). However, the causality between these synaptic processes and addictive behaviors is difficult to demonstrate. Here we report that LTP and LTD induction altered operant alcohol self-administration, a motivated drug-seeking behavior. We first induced LTP by pairing presynaptic glutamatergic stimulation with optogenetic postsynaptic depolarization in the dorsomedial striatum, a brain region known to control goal-directed behavior. Blockade of this LTP by NMDA-receptor inhibition unmasked an endocannabinoid-dependent LTD. In vivo application of the LTP-inducing protocol caused a long-lasting increase in alcohol-seeking behavior, while the LTD protocol decreased this behavior. We further identified that optogenetic LTP and LTD induction at cortical inputs onto striatal dopamine D1 receptor-expressing neurons controlled these behavioral changes. Our results demonstrate a causal link between synaptic plasticity and alcohol-seeking behavior and suggest that modulation of this plasticity may inspire a therapeutic strategy for addiction. Addiction-related behaviors are believed to result from drug-evoked synaptic changes, but their causality is unclear. The authors show that bidirectional optogenetic modifications of synaptic strength distinctly alter alcohol-seeking behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2787937034,"Since the Industrial Revolution, the North Atlantic Ocean has been accumulating anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) and experiencing ocean acidification, that is, an increase in the concentration of hydrogen ions (a reduction in pH) and a reduction in the concentration of carbonate ions. The latter causes the 'aragonite saturation horizon'-below which waters are undersaturated with respect to a particular calcium carbonate, aragonite-to move to shallower depths (to shoal), exposing corals to corrosive waters. Here we use a database analysis to show that the present rate of supply of acidified waters to the deep Atlantic could cause the aragonite saturation horizon to shoal by 1,000-1,700 metres in the subpolar North Atlantic within the next three decades. We find that, during 1991-2016, a decrease in the concentration of carbonate ions in the Irminger Sea caused the aragonite saturation horizon to shoal by about 10-15 metres per year, and the volume of aragonite-saturated waters to reduce concomitantly. Our determination of the transport of the excess of carbonate over aragonite saturation (xc[CO32-])-an indicator of the availability of aragonite to organisms-by the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation shows that the present-day transport of carbonate ions towards the deep ocean is about 44 per cent lower than it was in preindustrial times. We infer that a doubling of atmospheric anthropogenic CO2 levels-which could occur within three decades according to a 'business-as-usual scenario' for climate change-could reduce the transport of xc[CO32-] by 64-79 per cent of that in preindustrial times, which could severely endanger cold-water coral habitats. The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation would also export this acidified deep water southwards, spreading corrosive waters to the world ocean."
https://openalex.org/W2787801510,"We previously reported the successful induction and completion of mouse spermatogenesis by culturing neonatal testis tissues. The culture medium consisted of α-minimum essential medium (α-MEM), supplemented with Knockout serum replacement (KSR) or AlbuMAX, neither of which were defined chemically. In this study, we formulated a chemically defined medium (CDM) that can induce mouse spermatogenesis under organ culture conditions. It was found that bovine serum albumin (BSA) purified through three different procedures had different effects on spermatogenesis. We also confirmed that retinoic acid (RA) played crucial roles in the onset of spermatogonial differentiation and meiotic initiation. The added lipids exhibited weak promoting effects on spermatogenesis. Lastly, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), triiodothyronine (T3), and testosterone (T) combined together promoted spermatogenesis until round spermatid production. The CDM, however, was not able to produce elongated spermatids. It was also unable to induce spermatogenesis from the very early neonatal period, before 2 days postpartum, leaving certain factors necessary for spermatogenic induction in mice unidentified. Nonetheless, the present study provided important basic information on testis organ culture and spermatogenesis in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2791384935,"This study was to investigate the prevalence of actual uptake of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), willingness to use daily oral PrEP under two cost scenarios, and potential issues related to PrEP use among men who have sex with men (MSM) with HIV negative/unknown sero-status in Hong Kong, China. Factors associated with the two measures of willingness were also investigated.403 eligible MSM completed the anonymous venue-based face-to-face interview/telephone interview.Only 1% had ever used PrEP. After being briefed about some facts of PrEP, the prevalence of willingness to use daily oral PrEP was 7.7% if they could purchase PrEP at private hospitals/clinics at HK$8,000 (US$1,032)/month (market rate) and 45.2% if free PrEP was provided by public hospitals/clinics in Hong Kong (free PrEP). After adjusted for significant background variables, significant factors of these two measures of willingness included: (1) number of correct responses to knowledge on PrEP, (2) perceived risk of HIV infection in the next six months, and (3) constructs of the Theory of Planned Behavior: positive and negative attitudes toward PrEP, perceived their significant others would support them take PrEP (perceived subjective norm), perceived number of local MSM who were willing to take PrEP (perceived descriptive norm), and confidence in using PrEP under the two scenarios (perceived behavioral control). Among all participants, 9.7% and 25.1% would start and discontinue using PrEP without consulting doctors; 26.0% would not take PrEP daily if it was provided for free, and 42.4% would not take up HIV testing every 3 months after using PrEP.Different strategies should be considered for promoting PrEP at market rate and if free PrEP is made available. Future promotion should increase their knowledge about PrEP, modify their perceptions related to HIV and PrEP, and address some potential issues related to PrEP use."
https://openalex.org/W2792159612,"Soil respiration (Rs) plays a key role in the carbon balance of forest ecosystems. There is growing evidence that Rs is strongly correlated with canopy photosynthesis; however, how Rs is linked to aboveground attributes at various phenological stages, on the seasonal and diurnal scale, remains unclear. Using an automated closed dynamic chamber system, we assessed the seasonal and diurnal patterns of Rs in a temperate evergreen coniferous forest from 2005 to 2010. High-frequency Rs rates followed seasonal soil temperature patterns but the relationship showed strong hysteresis. Predictions of Rs based on a temperature-response model underestimated the observed values from June to July and overestimated those from August to September and from January to April. The observed Rs was higher in early summer than in late summer and autumn despite similar soil temperatures. At a diurnal scale, the Rs pattern showed a hysteresis loop with the soil temperature trend during the seasons of high biological activity (June to October). In July and August, Rs declined after the morning peak from 0800 to 1400 h, although soil temperatures continued to increase. During that period, figure-eight-shaped diurnal Rs patterns were observed, suggesting that a midday decline in root physiological activity may have occurred in early summer. In September and October, Rs was higher in the morning than in the night despite consistently high soil temperatures. We have characterised the magnitude and pattern of seasonal and diurnal Rs in an evergreen forest. We conclude that the temporal variability of Rs at high resolution is more related to seasons across the temperature dependence."
https://openalex.org/W2791500801,"Background Vital sign measurements in hospitalized patients by nurses are time consuming and prone to operational errors. The Checkme, a smart all-in-one device capable of measuring vital signs, could improve daily patient monitoring by reducing measurement time, inter-observer variability, and incorrect inputs in the Electronic Health Record (EHR). We evaluated the accuracy of self measurements by patient using the Checkme in comparison with gold standard and nurse measurements. Methods and findings This prospective comparative study was conducted at the Internal Medicine ward of an academic hospital in the Netherlands. Fifty non-critically ill patients were enrolled in the study. Time-related measurement sessions were conducted on consecutive patients in a randomized order: vital sign measurement in duplicate by a well-trained investigator (gold standard), a Checkme measurement by the patient, and a routine vital sign measurement by a nurse. In 41 patients (82%), initial calibration of the Checkme was successful and results were eligible for analysis. In total, 69 sessions were conducted for these 41 patients. The temperature results recorded by the patient with the Checkme differed significantly from the gold standard core temperature measurements (mean difference 0.1 ± 0.3). Obtained differences in vital signs and calculated Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) were small and were in range with predefined accepted discrepancies. Conclusions Patient-calculated MEWS using the Checkme, nurse measurements, and gold standard measurements all correlated well, and the small differences observed between modalities would not have affected clinical decision making. Using the Checkme, patients in a general medical ward setting are able to measure their own vital signs easily and accurately by themselves. This could be time saving for nurses and prevent errors due to manually entering data in the EHR."
https://openalex.org/W2793541224,"Background aims Spontaneous mutagenesis often leads to appearance of genetic changes in cells. Although human multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSC) are considered as genetically stable, there is a risk of genomic and structural chromosome instability and, therefore, side effects of cell therapy associated with long-term effects. In this study, the karyotype, genetic variability and clone formation analyses have been carried out in the long-term culture MSC from human gingival mucosa. Methods The immunophenotype of MSC has been examined using flow cytofluorometry and short tandem repeat (STR) analysis has been carried out for authentication. The karyotype has been examined using GTG staining and mFISH, while the assessment of the aneuploidy 8 frequency has been performed using centromere specific chromosome FISH probes in interphase cells. Results The immunophenotype and STR loci combination did not change during the process of cultivation. From passage 23 the proliferative activity of cultured MSCs was significantly reduced. From passage 12 of cultivation, clones of cells with stable chromosome aberrations have been identified and the biggest of these (12%) are tetrasomy of chromosome 8. The random genetic and structural chromosomal aberrations and the spontaneous level of chromosomal aberrations in the hMSC long-term cultures were also described. Conclusions The spectrum of spontaneous chromosomal aberrations in MSC long-term cultivation has been described. Clonal chromosomal aberrations have been identified. A clone of cells with tetrasomy 8 has been detected in passage 12 and has reached the maximum size by passage 18 before and decreased along with the reduction of proliferative activity of cell line by passage 26. At later passages, the MSC line exhibited a set of cells with structural variants of the karyotype with a preponderance of normal diploid cells. The results of our study strongly suggest a need for rigorous genetic analyses of the clone formation in cultured MSCs before use in medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2787548101,"Histamine is used in bronchial and dermal provocation, but it is rarely considered an environmental risk factor in allergic disease. Because bed bugs defecate large amounts of histamine as a component of their aggregation pheromone, we sought to determine if histamine accumulates in household dust in bed bug infested homes, and the effects of bed bug eradication with spatial heat on histamine levels in dust. We collected dust in homes and analyzed for histamine before, and up to three months after bed bug eradication. Histamine levels in bed bug infested homes were remarkably high (mean = 54.6±18.9 μg/100 mg of sieved household dust) and significantly higher than in control homes not infested with bed bugs (mean < 2.5±1.9 μg/100 mg of sieved household dust). Heat treatments that eradicated the bed bug infestations failed to reduce histamine levels, even three months after treatment. We report a clear association between histamine levels in household dust and bed bug infestations. The high concentrations, persistence, and proximity to humans during sleep suggest that bed bug-produced histamine may represent an emergent contaminant and pose a serious health risk in the indoor environment."
https://openalex.org/W2566828544,"Zika virus (ZIKV), a disease spread primarily through the Aedes aegypti mosquito, was identified in Brazil in 2015 and was declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO). Epidemiologists often use common state-level attributes such as population density and temperature to determine the spread of disease. By applying techniques from topological data analysis, we believe that epidemiologists will be able to better predict how ZIKV will spread. We use the Vietoris-Rips filtration on high-density mosquito locations in Brazil to create simplicial complexes, from which we extract homology group generators. Previously epidemiologists have not relied on topological data analysis to model disease spread. Evaluating our model on ZIKV case data in the states of Brazil demonstrates the value of these techniques for the improved assessment of vector-borne diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2786272448,"Finding additional functional targets for combination therapy could improve the outcome for melanoma patients. In a spontaneous metastasis xenograft model of human melanoma a shRNA mediated knockdown of L1CAM more than sevenfold reduced the number of lung metastases after the induction of subcutaneous tumors for two human melanoma cell lines (MeWo, MV3). Whole genome expression arrays of the initially L1CAM high MeWo subcutaneous tumors revealed unchanged or downregulated genes involved in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) except an upregulation of Jagged 1, indicating a compensatory change in Notch signaling especially as Jagged 1 expression showed an increase in MeWo L1CAM metastases and Jagged 1 was expressed in metastases of the initially L1CAM low MV3 cells as well. Expression of 17 genes showed concordant regulation for L1CAM knockdown tumors of both cell lines. The changes in gene expression indicated changes in the EMT network of the melanoma cells and an increase in p53/p21 and p38 activity contributing to the reduced metastatic potential of the L1CAM knockdowns. Taken together, these data make L1CAM a highly interesting therapeutic target to prevent further metastatic spread in melanoma patients."
https://openalex.org/W2792244986,"The crop Water Footprint (WF) can provide a comprehensive knowledge of the use of water through the demarcation of the amount of the water consumed by different crops. The WF has three components: green (WFg), blue (WFb) and grey (WFgr) water footprints. The WFg refers to the rainwater stored in the root zone soil layer and is mainly utilized for agricultural, horticultural and forestry production. The WFb, however, is the consumptive use of water from surface or groundwater resources and mainly deals with irrigated agriculture, industry, domestic water use, etc. While the WFgr is the amount of fresh water required to assimilate pollutants resulting from the use of fertilizers/agrochemicals. This study was conducted on six agricultural fields in the Eastern region of Saudi Arabia, during the period from December 2015 to December 2016, to investigate the spatiotemporal variation of the WF of silage maize and carrot crops. The WF of each crop was estimated in two ways, namely agro-meteorological (WFAgro) and remote sensing (WFRS) methods. The blue, green and grey components of WFAgro were computed with the use of weather station/Eddy covariance measurements and field recorded crop yield datasets. The WFRS estimated by applying surface energy balance principles on Landsat-8 imageries. However, due to non-availability of Landsat-8 data on the event of rainy days, this study was limited to blue component (WFRS-b). The WFAgro of silage maize was found to range from 3545 m3 t-1 to 4960 m3 t-1; on an average, the WFAgro-g, WFAgro-b, and WFAgro-gr are composed of < 1%, 77%, and 22%, respectively. In the case of carrot, the WFAgro ranged between 297 m3 t-1 and 502 m3 t-1. The WFAgro-g of carrot crop was estimated at <1%, while WFAgro-b and WFAgro-gr was 67% and 32%, respectively. The WFAgro-b is occupied as a major portion in WF of silage maize (77%) and carrot (68%) crops. This is due to the high crop water demand combined with a very erratic rainfall, the irrigation is totally provided using groundwater delivered by center pivot irrigation systems. On the other hand, the WFRS-b estimated using Landsat-8 data was varied from 276 (±73) m3 t-1 (carrot) and 2885 (±441) m3 t-1 (silage maize). The variation (RMSE) between WFRS-b and WFAgro-b was about 17% and 14% for silage maize and carrot crops, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2786280034,"It has long been suggested that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a role in oxygen sensing via peripheral chemoreceptors, which would imply their involvement in chemoreflex activation and autonomic regulation of heart rate. We hypothesize that antioxidant affect neurogenic cardiovascular regulation through activation of chemoreflex which results in increased control of sympathetic mechanism regulating heart rhythm. Activity of xanthine oxidase (XO), which is among the major endogenous sources of ROS in the rat has been shown to increase during hypoxia promote oxidative stress. However, the mechanism of how XO inhibition affects neurogenic regulation of heart rhythm is still unclear.The study aimed to evaluate effects of allopurinol-driven inhibition of XO on autonomic heart regulation in rats exposed to hypoxia followed by hyperoxia, using heart rate variability (HRV) analysis.16 conscious male Wistar rats (350 g): control-untreated (N = 8) and pretreated with Allopurinol-XO inhibitor (5 mg/kg, followed by 50 mg/kg), administered intraperitoneally (N = 8), were exposed to controlled hypobaric hypoxia (1h) in order to activate chemoreflex. The treatment was followed by 1h hyperoxia (chemoreflex suppression). Time-series of 1024 RR-intervals were extracted from 4kHz ECG recording for heart rate variability (HRV) analysis in order to calculate the following time-domain parameters: mean RR interval (RRi), SDNN (standard deviation of all normal NN intervals), rMSSD (square root of the mean of the squares of differences between adjacent NN intervals), frequency-domain parameters (FFT method): TSP (total spectral power) as well as low and high frequency band powers (LF and HF). At the end of experiment we used rat plasma to evaluate enzymatic activity of XO and markers of oxidative stress: protein carbonyl group and 8-isoprostane concentrations. Enzymatic activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were measures in erythrocyte lysates.Allopurinol reduced oxidative stress which was the result of hypoxia/hyperoxia, as shown by decreased 8-isoprostane plasma concentration. XO inhibition did not markedly influence HRV parameters in standard normoxia. However, during hypoxia, as well as hyperoxia, allopurinol administration resulted in a significant increase of autonomic control upon the heart as shown by increased SDNN and TSP, with an increased vagal contribution (increased rMSSD and HF), whereas sympathovagal indexes (LF/HF, SDNN/rMSSD) remained unchanged.Observed regulatory effects of XO inhibition did not confirm preliminary hypothesis which suggested that an antioxidant such as allopurinol might activate chemoreflex resulting in augmented sympathetic discharge to the heart. The HRV regulatory profile of XO inhibition observed during hypoxia as well as post-hypoxic hyperoxia corresponds to reported reduced risk of sudden cardiovascular events. Therefore our data provide a new argument for therapeutical use of allopurinol in hypoxic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2786930965,"The quality of psychological studies is currently a major concern. The Many Labs Project (MLP) and the Open-Science-Collaboration (OSC) have collected key data on replicability and statistical effect sizes. We build on this work by investigating the role played by three measurement types: ratings, proportions and unbounded (measures without conceptual upper limits, e.g. time). Both replicability and effect sizes are dependent on the amount of variability due to extraneous factors. We predicted that the role of such extraneous factors might depend on measurement type, and would be greatest for ratings, intermediate for proportions and least for unbounded. Our results support this conjecture. OSC replication rates for unbounded, 43% and proportion 40% combined are reliably higher than those for ratings at 20% (effect size, w = .20). MLP replication rates for the original studies are: proportion = .74, ratings = .40 (effect size w = .33). Original effect sizes (Cohen’s d) are highest for: unbounded OSC cognitive = 1.45, OSC social = .90); next for proportions (OSC cognitive = 1.01, OSC social = .84, MLP = .82); and lowest for ratings (OSC social = .64, MLP = .31). These findings are of key importance to scientific methodology and design, even if the reasons for their occurrence are still at the level of conjecture."
https://openalex.org/W2792816907,"Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an autoimmune disorder of the peripheral nervous system triggered by molecular mimicry between pathogen lipopolysaccharides and host nerve gangliosides. Polymorphisms in the Fas receptor (FAS) and Fas ligand (FASL) genes may potentially alter the elimination of autoreactive immune cells and affect disease susceptibility or disease severity in GBS. We detected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in FAS (-1377G/A and -670A/G) and FASL (-843C/T) in a prospective cohort of 300 patients with GBS and 300 healthy controls from the Bangladeshi population. Genotype distributions were not significantly different between patients with GBS and healthy controls. The FAS -670 AG heterozygous (P = 0.0005, OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.5–4.2) and GG homozygous (P = 0.0048, OR = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.3–5.0) genotypes were more common in patients with anti-GM1 antibodies than patients without anti-GM1 antibodies. The FAS -670 G allele was more prevalent in anti-GM1 antibody-positive than -negative patients (P = 0.0002, OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.4–2.7) and also in patients with the axonal subtype than demyelinating subtype (P < 0.0001, OR = 4.8, 95% CI = 2.3–10.1). The 1377G/-670G GG haplotype was significantly associated with the axonal subtype (P < 0.0001) and anti-ganglioside antibody-positivity (P = 0.0008) in GBS. Serum sFas (237.5 pg/mL vs. 159.5 pg/mL; P < 0.0001) and sFasL (225.1 pg/mL vs. 183.4 pg/mL; P = 0.0069) were elevated in patients with GBS compared to healthy controls, and among patients with high serum sFas was associated with severe GBS (P = 0.0406). In conclusion, this study indicates FAS-FASL promoter SNPs may promote the production of cross-reactive anti-ganglioside antibodies in GBS."
https://openalex.org/W2791110452,"Decreased contractility in the non-ischemic border zone surrounding a MI is in part due to degradation of cardiomyocyte sarcomeric components by intracellular matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2). We recently reported that MMP-2 levels were increased in the border zone after a MI and that treatment with doxycycline for two weeks after MI was associated with normalization of MMP-2 levels and improvement in ex-vivo contractile protein developed force in the myocardial border zone. The purpose of the current study was to determine if there is a sustained effect of short term treatment with doxycycline (Dox) on border zone function in a large animal model of antero-apical myocardial infarction (MI). Antero-apical MI was created in 14 sheep. Seven sheep received doxycycline 0.8 mg/kg/hr IV for two weeks. Cardiac MRI was performed two weeks before, and then two and six weeks after MI. Two sheep died prior to MRI at six weeks from surgical/anesthesia-related causes. The remaining 12 sheep completed the protocol. Doxycycline induced a sustained reduction in intracellular MMP-2 by Western blot (3649±643 MI+Dox vs 9236±114 MI relative intensity; p = 0.0009), an improvement in ex-vivo contractility (65.3±2.0 MI+Dox vs 39.7±0.8 MI mN/mm2; p<0.0001) and an increase in ventricular wall thickness at end-systole 1.0 cm from the infarct edge (12.4±0.6 MI+Dox vs 10.0±0.5 MI mm; p = 0.0095). Administration of doxycycline for a limited two week period is associated with a sustained improvement in ex-vivo contractility and an increase in wall thickness at end-systole in the border zone six weeks after MI. These findings were associated with a reduction in intracellular MMP-2 activity."
https://openalex.org/W2787418465,"Protein binding can induce DNA kinks, which are for example important to enhance the specificity of the interaction and to facilitate the assembly of multi protein complexes. The respective proteins frequently exhibit amino acid sidechains that intercalate between the DNA base steps at the site of the kink. However, on a molecular level there is only little information available about the role of individual sidechains for kink formation. To unravel structural principles of protein-induced DNA kinking we have performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of five complexes that varied in their architecture, function, and identity of intercalated residues. Simulations were performed for the DNA complexes of wildtype proteins (Sac7d, Sox-4, CcpA, TFAM, TBP) and for mutants, in which the intercalating residues were individually or combined replaced by alanine. The work revealed that for systems with multiple intercalated residues, not all of them are necessarily required for kink formation. In some complexes (Sox-4, TBP), one of the residues proved to be essential for kink formation, whereas the second residue has only a very small effect on the magnitude of the kink. In other systems (e.g. Sac7d) each of the intercalated residues proved to be individually capable of conferring a strong kink suggesting a partially redundant role of the intercalating residues. Mutation of the key residues responsible for kinking either resulted in stable complexes with reduced kink angles or caused conformational instability as evidenced by a shift of the kink to an adjacent base step. Thus, MD simulations can help to identify the role of individual inserted residues for kinking, which is not readily apparent from an inspection of the static structures. This information might be helpful for understanding protein-DNA interactions in more detail and for designing proteins with altered DNA binding properties in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2790279718,"MMP (Matrix metalloproteinase) 9 is reported to affect glaucoma pathogenesis by altering intraocular pressure (IOP) through its role in remodeling the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the trabecular meshwork. A genetic variant at the promoter region in the MMP9 gene (-1562C>T) has a putative role in regulating its transcription rate and hence can affect genetic predisposition to primary glaucoma. The present study examined the association of -1562C>T promoter polymorphism in the MMP9 gene with Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG) and Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma (PACG) in a north Indian population. A total of 729 subjects (POAG = 224, PACG = 138 and 367 controls) were recruited for the study. Genotyping for the promoter sequence variant was done with PCR-RFLP method. Genotypic and allelic frequency distribution of the POAG and PACG data sets were compared to that of controls by chi-square test and genetic association was tested under different genetic models as implemented under PLINK. Statistically significant difference was observed in the genotype frequencies between PACG cases and controls (p = 0.030). However, in the POAG cases, this difference was only borderline (p = 0.052). Genetic model analysis, under the dominant model revealed 1.6 and 1.4 fold increased susceptibility to PACG and POAG (p = 0.012, p = 0.032) respectively. A higher frequency of CT genotype was observed in PACG as well as POAG males as compared to female subjects. According to the dominant model, CT+TT genotype conferred 1.8 fold higher risk of developing PACG among male patients as compared to the control group (p = 0.048, OR = 1.87;1.00–3.50). Current findings suggest significant association of MMP9 -1562C>T polymorphism with primary glaucoma in the targeted north Indian population and warrant further replication of the findings in other populations."
https://openalex.org/W2792210973,"Objectives The body variable associated with the diagnosis of Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is an elevated waist circumference (WC), although a number of other variables have been suggested. Among these, an elevated waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), ie a value higher than 0.5, that may identify abnormality, independently from height. An elevated WHtR provided the best correlation with MetS in a prior study in a large Italian population. In order to assess the validity of this conclusion, a long-term follow-up study re-examined this population, also in order to detect possible associations with cardiovascular (CV) risk. Methods and results 1,071 subjects with a complete follow-up of over 6 years were evaluated with a comparative assessment of the three anthropometric variables, namely WHtR, WC and body mass index (BMI). WHtR≥ 0.5 had the highest sensitivity for the identification of MetS, both in males and females (94.1% and 86.7% respectively). WHtR was of reduced specificity, occurring, yet less frequently (17.7% in males and 30% in females), in patients without MetS. By contrast, enlarged WC occurred with a lower frequency in male patients who developed MetS (30.2%) whereas in females, frequency was higher than in males (69.3%). Finally, a BMI≥ 25 kg/m2 had intermediate sensitivity and specificity regardless of gender. WC showed the highest odds ratio (2.62, 95%CI: 1.18–5.78) for the prediction of CV occurrence. Conclusion The present study confirms WHtR as an excellent screening tool in identifying MetS carriers, but, different from reports in other countries, it shows a lower specificity in our population."

Effectiveness of MH is usually evaluated by its capacity to generate an expiratory flow bias. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of MH-and its resulting flow bias-applied according to clinical practice versus according to expert recommendation on mucus movement in a lung model simulating a mechanically ventilated patient.Twelve physiotherapists were asked to apply MH, using a self-inflating manual resuscitator, to a test lung as if to remove secretions under two conditions: according to their usual clinical practice (pre-instruction phase) and after verbal instruction to perform MH according to expert recommendation was given (post-instruction phase). Mucus simulant movement was measured with a photodensitometric technique. Peak inspiratory flow (PIF), peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), inspiratory time (TINSP), tidal volume (VT) and peak expiratory flow (PEF) were measured continuously.It was found that MH performed post-instruction delivered a smaller VT (643.1 ± 57.8 ml) at a lower PIP (15.0 ± 1.5 cmH2O), lower PIF (38.0 ± 9.6 L/min), longer TINSP (1.84 ±0.54 s) and lower PEF (65.4 ± 6.7L/min) compared to MH pre-instruction. In the pre-instruction phase, MH resulted in a mean PIF/PEF ratio of 1.73 ± 0.38 and mean PEF-PIF difference of -54.6 ± 28.3 L/min, both out of the range for secretion removal. In the post-instruction phase both indexes were in the adequate range. Consequently, the mucus simulant was moved outward when MH was applied according to expert recommendation and towards the test lung when it was applied according to clinical practice.Performance of MH during clinical practice with PIF higher than PEF was ineffective to clear secretion in a lung model simulating a mechanically ventilated patient. In order to remove secretion, MH should result in an adequate expiratory flow bias."
https://openalex.org/W2793131781,"Chronic mild stress leads to depression in many cases and is linked to several debilitating diseases including mental disorders. Recently, neuronal tracing techniques, stereology, and immunohistochemistry have revealed persistent and significant microstructural alterations in the hippocampus, hypothalamus, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala, which form an interconnected system known as the stress circuit. Most studies have focused only on this circuit, however, some studies indicate that manipulation of sensory and motor systems may impact genesis and therapy of mood disorders and therefore these areas should not be neglected in the study of brain microstructure alterations in response to stress and depression. For this reason, we explore the microstructural alterations in different cortical regions in a chronic mild stress model of depression. The study employs ex-vivo diffusion MRI (d-MRI) to assess cortical microstructure in stressed (anhedonic and resilient) and control animals. MRI is followed by immunohistochemistry to substantiate the d-MRI findings. We find significantly lower extracellular diffusivity in auditory cortex (AC) of stress groups and a significantly higher fractional anisotropy in the resilient group. Neurite density was not found to be significantly higher in any cortical ROIs in the stress group compared to control, although axonal density is higher in the stress groups. We also report significant thinning of motor cortex (MC) in both stress groups. This is in agreement with recent clinical and preclinical studies on depression and similar disorders where significant microstructural and metabolic alterations were found in AC and MC. Our findings provide further evidence that the AC and MC are sensitive towards stress exposure and may extend our understanding of the microstructural effects of stress beyond the stress circuit of the brain. Progress in this field may provide new avenues of research to help in diagnosis and treatment intervention for depression and related disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2791733744,"Background Self-reported male circumcision (MC) status is widely used to estimate community prevalence of circumcision, although its accuracy varies in different settings depending on the extent of misreporting. Despite this challenge, self-reported MC status remains essential because it is the most feasible method of collecting MC status data in community surveys. Therefore, its accuracy is an important determinant of the reliability of MC prevalence estimates based on such surveys. We measured the concurrence between self-reported and physically verified MC status among men aged 25–39 years during a baseline household survey for a study to test strategies for enhancing MC uptake by older men in Nyanza region of Kenya. The objective was to determine the accuracy of self-reported MC status in communities where MC for HIV prevention is being rolled out. Methods Agreement between self-reported and physically verified MC status was measured among 4,232 men. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data on MC status followed by physical examination to verify the actual MC status whose outcome was recorded as fully circumcised (no foreskin), partially circumcised (foreskin is past corona sulcus but covers less than half of the glans) or uncircumcised (foreskin covers half or more of the glans). The sensitivity and specificity of self-reported MC status were calculated using physically verified MC status as the gold standard. Results Out of 4,232 men, 2,197 (51.9%) reported being circumcised, of whom 99.0% were confirmed to be fully circumcised on physical examination. Among 2,035 men who reported being uncircumcised, 93.7% (1,907/2,035) were confirmed uncircumcised on physical examination. Agreement between self-reported and physically verified MC status was almost perfect, kappa (k) = 98.6% (95% CI, 98.1%-99.1%. The sensitivity of self-reporting being circumcised was 99.6% (95% CI, 99.2–99.8) while specificity of self-reporting uncircumcised was 99.0% (95% CI, 98.4–99.4) and did not differ significantly by age group based on chi-square test. Rate of consenting to physical verification of MC status differed by client characteristics; unemployed men were more likely to consent to physical verification (odds ratio [OR] = 1.48, (95% CI, 1.30–1.69) compared to employed men and those with post-secondary education were less likely to consent to physical verification than those with primary education or less (odds ratio [OR] = 0.61, (95% CI, 0.51–0.74). Conclusions In this Kenyan context, both sensitivity and specificity of self-reported MC status was high; therefore, MC prevalence estimates based on self-reported MC status should be deemed accurate and applicable for planning. However MC programs should assess accuracy of self-reported MC status periodically for any secular changes that may undermine its usefulness for estimating community MC prevalence in their unique settings."
https://openalex.org/W2786098031,"Pronounced variations in faecal consistency have been described anecdotally for some carnivore species fed a structure-rich diet. Typically two faecal consistencies are distinguished, namely hard and firm versus liquid and viscous faeces. It is possible that a separation mechanism is operating in the carnivore digestive tract, as in many herbivore species. Six beagle dogs were fed two experimental diets in a cross-over design of 7 days. Test diets consisted of chunked day old chicks differing only in particle size (fine = 7.8 mm vs coarse = 13 mm) in order to vary dietary structure. Digestive retention time was measured using titanium oxide (TiO2) as marker. The total faecal output was scored for consistency and faecal fermentation profiles were evaluated through faecal short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) and ammonia (NH3) analyses. A total of 181 faecal samples were collected. Dietary particle size did not affect faecal consistency, fermentative end products nor mean retention time (MRT). However, a faecal consistency dichotomy was observed with firm faeces (score 2-2.5) and soft faeces (score 4-4.5) being the most frequently occurring consistencies in an almost alternating pattern in every single dog. Firm and soft faeces differed distinctively in fermentative profiles. Although the structure difference between diets did not affect the faecal dichotomy, feeding whole prey provoked the occurrence of the latter which raises suspicion of a digestive separation mechanism in the canine digestive tract. Further faecal characterisation is however required in order to unravel the underlying mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2786467868,"Infrared (IR) receptors are rare in insects and have only been found in the small group of so-called pyrophilous insects, which approach forest fires. In previous work the morphology of the IR receptors and the physiology of the inherent sensory cells have been investigated. It was shown that receptors are located on the thorax and the abdomen respectively and show an astounding diversity with respect to structure and the presumed transduction mechanism. What is completely missing, however, is any behavioral evidence for the function of the IR receptors in pyrophilous insects. Here we describe the responses of the Australian “firebeetle”, Merimna atrata to IR radiation. Beetles in a restrained flight were laterally stimulated with IR radiation of an intensity 20% above a previously determined electrophysiological threshold of the IR organs (40 mW/cm2). After exposure, beetles always showed an avoidance response away from the IR source. Reversible ablation experiments showed that the abdominal IR receptors are essential for the observed behavior. Tests with weaker IR radiation (11.4 mW/cm2) also induced avoidance reactions in some beetles pointing to a lower threshold. In contrast, beetles were never attracted by the IR source. Our results suggest that the IR receptors in Merimna atrata serve as an early warning system preventing an accidental landing on a hot surface. We also tested if another fire specific stimulus, the view of a large smoke plume, influenced the flight. However, due to an unexpected insensitivity of the flying beetles to most visual stimuli results were ambiguous."
https://openalex.org/W2786656796,"A more holistic understanding of the benefits of sight-restoring cataract surgery requires a focus that goes beyond income and employment, to include a wider array of well-being measures. The objective of this study is to examine the monetary and non-monetary benefits of cataract surgery on both patients as well as their caregivers in Vietnam. Participants were randomly recruited from a Ho-Chi-Minh City Hospital. A total of 82 cataract patients and 83 caregivers participated in the survey conducted for this study. Paired t-tests, Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests, and regression analysis are used to detect any statistically significant differences in various measures of well-being for patients and caregivers before and after surgery. There are statistically significant improvements in monetary and non-monetary measures of well-being for both patients and caregivers approximately three months after undergoing cataract surgery, compared with baseline assessments collected prior to surgery. Non-monetary measures of well-being include self-assessments of overall health, mental health, hope, self-efficacy, happiness and life satisfaction. For patients, the benefits included statistically significant improvements in earnings, mobility, self-care, the ability to undertake daily activities, self-assessed health and mental health, life satisfaction, hope, and self-efficacy (p<0.01). For caregivers, attendance at work improved alongside overall health, mental health, hope, self-efficacy, happiness and life satisfaction, three months post-surgery (p<0.01). Restoring sight has positive impacts for those suffering from cataracts and their caregivers. Sometimes the benefits are almost equal in their magnitude. The study has also demonstrated that many of these impacts are non-monetary in nature. It is clear that estimates of the rate of return to restoring sight that focus only on financial gains will underestimate the true returns to society of restoring sight from cataract surgeries."
https://openalex.org/W2790012511,"In basketball games, whenever players successfully shoot in streaks, they are expected to demonstrate heightened performance for a stretch of time. Streak shooting in basketball has been debated for more than three decades, but most studies have provided little significant statistical evidence and have labeled random subjective judgments the “hot hand fallacy.” To obtain a broader perspective of the hot hand phenomenon and its accompanying influences on the court, this study uses field goal records and optical tracking data from the official NBA database for the entire 2015–2016 season to analyze top-scoring leaders’ shooting performances. We first reflect on the meaning of “hot hand” and the “Matthew effect” in actual basketball competition. Second, this study employs statistical models to integrate three different shooting perspectives (field goal percentage, points scored, and attempts). This study’s findings shed new light not only on the existence or nonexistence of streaks, but on the roles of capability and opportunity in NBA hot shooting. Furthermore, we show how hot shooting performances resulting from capability and opportunity lead to actual differences for teams."
https://openalex.org/W2790305373,"High conformal techniques such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy and volumetric-modulated arc therapy are widely used in overloaded radiotherapy departments. In vivo dosimetric screening is essential in this environment to avoid important dosimetric errors. This work examines the feasibility of introducing in vivo dosimetry (IVD) checks in a radiotherapy routine. The causes of dosimetric disagreements between delivered and planned treatments were identified and corrected during the course of treatment. The efficiency of the corrections performed and the added workload needed for the entire procedure were evaluated. The IVD procedure was based on an electronic portal imaging device. A total of 3682 IVD tests were performed for 147 patients who underwent head and neck, abdomen, pelvis, breast, and thorax radiotherapy treatments. Two types of indices were evaluated and used to determine if the IVD tests were within tolerance levels: the ratio R between the reconstructed and planned isocentre doses and a transit dosimetry based on the γ-analysis of the electronic portal images. The causes of test outside tolerance level were investigated and corrected and IVD test was repeated during subsequent fraction. The time needed for each step of the IVD procedure was registered. Pelvis, abdomen, and head and neck treatments had 10% of tests out of tolerance whereas breast and thorax treatments accounted for up to 25%. The patient setup was the main cause of 90% of the IVD tests out of tolerance and the remaining 10% was due to patient morphological changes. An average time of 42 min per day was sufficient to monitor a daily workload of 60 patients in treatment. This work shows that IVD performed with an electronic portal imaging device is feasible in an overloaded department and enables the timely realignment of the treatment quality indices in order to achieve a patient’s final treatment compliant with the one prescribed."
https://openalex.org/W2791208437,"Even among isogenic cells, the time to progress through the cell cycle, or the intermitotic time (IMT), is highly variable. This variability has been a topic of research for several decades and numerous mathematical models have been proposed to explain it. Previously, we developed a top-down, stochastic drift-diffusion+threshold (DDT) model of a cell cycle checkpoint and showed that it can accurately describe experimentally-derived IMT distributions [Leander R, Allen EJ, Garbett SP, Tyson DR, Quaranta V. Derivation and experimental comparison of cell-division probability densities. J. Theor. Biol. 2014;358:129–135]. Here, we use the DDT modeling approach for both descriptive and predictive data analysis. We develop a custom numerical method for the reliable maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters in the absence of a priori knowledge about the number of detectable checkpoints. We employ this method to fit different variants of the DDT model (with one, two, and three checkpoints) to IMT data from multiple cell lines under different growth conditions and drug treatments. We find that a two-checkpoint model best describes the data, consistent with the notion that the cell cycle can be broadly separated into two steps: the commitment to divide and the process of cell division. The model predicts one part of the cell cycle to be highly variable and growth factor sensitive while the other is less variable and relatively refractory to growth factor signaling. Using experimental data that separates IMT into G1 vs. S, G2, and M phases, we show that the model-predicted growth-factor-sensitive part of the cell cycle corresponds to a portion of G1, consistent with previous studies suggesting that the commitment step is the primary source of IMT variability. These results demonstrate that a simple stochastic model, with just a handful of parameters, can provide fundamental insights into the biological underpinnings of cell cycle progression."
https://openalex.org/W2791263689,"Urban ecosystem assessments increasingly rely on widely available map products, such as the U.S. Geological Service (USGS) National Land Cover Database (NLCD), and datasets that use generic classification schemes to detect and model large-scale impacts of land-cover change. However, utilizing existing map products or schemes without identifying relevant urban class types such as semi-natural, yet managed land areas that account for differences in ecological functions due to their pervious surfaces may severely constrain assessments. To address this gap, we introduce the managed clearings land-cover type–semi-natural, vegetated land surfaces with varying degrees of management practices–for urbanizing landscapes. We explore the extent to which managed clearings are common and spatially distributed in three rapidly urbanizing areas of the Charlanta megaregion, USA. We visually interpreted and mapped fine-scale land cover with special attention to managed clearings using 2012 U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) images within 150 randomly selected 1-km2 blocks in the cities of Atlanta, Charlotte, and Raleigh, and compared our maps with National Land Cover Database (NLCD) data. We estimated the abundance of managed clearings relative to other land use and land cover types, and the proportion of land-cover types in the NLCD that are similar to managed clearings. Our study reveals that managed clearings are the most common land cover type in these cities, covering 28% of the total sampled land area– 6.2% higher than the total area of impervious surfaces. Managed clearings, when combined with forest cover, constitutes 69% of pervious surfaces in the sampled region. We observed variability in area estimates of managed clearings between the NAIP-derived and NLCD data. This suggests using high-resolution remote sensing imagery (e.g., NAIP) instead of modifying NLCD data for improved representation of spatial heterogeneity and mapping of managed clearings in urbanizing landscapes. Our findings also demonstrate the need to more carefully consider managed clearings and their critical ecological functions in landscape- to regional-scale studies of urbanizing ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2793213796,"In this paper, we investigate two types of nonlocal soliton equations with the parity-time (PT) symmetry, namely, a two dimensional nonlocal nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation and a coupled nonlocal Klein-Gordon equation. Solitons and periodic line waves as exact solutions of these two nonlocal equations are derived by employing the Hirota’s bilinear method. Like the nonlocal NLS equation, these solutions may have singularities. However, by suitable constraints of parameters, nonsingular breather solutions are generated. Besides, by taking a long wave limit of these obtained soliton solutions, rogue wave solutions and semi-rational solutions are derived. For the two dimensional NLS equation, rogue wave solutions are line rogue waves, which arise from a constant background with a line profile and then disappear into the same background. The semi-rational solutions shows intriguing dynamical behaviours: line rogue wave and line breather arise from a constant background together and then disappear into the constant background again uniformly. For the coupled nonlocal Klein-Gordon equation, rogue waves are localized in both space and time, semi-rational solutions are composed of rogue waves, breathers and periodic line waves. These solutions are demonstrated analytically to exist for special classes of nonlocal equations relevant to optical waveguides."

Proteomics keeps generating hundreds of biomarker candidates that need to be transferred towards true clinical application through targeted verification studies and towards clinically applicable analysis formats. The immunoaffinity assay AFFIRM (AFFInity sRM) combines the sensitivity of recombinant single chain antibodies (scFv) for targeted protein enrichment with a specific mass spectrometry readout through selected reaction monitoring (SRM) in an automated workflow. Here we demonstrate a 100 times improved detection capacity of the assay down to pg/ml range through the use of oriented antibody immobilization to magnetic beads. This was achieved using biotin-tagged scFv coupled to streptavidin coated magnetic beads, or utilizing the FLAG tag for coupling to anti-FLAG antibody coated magnetic beads. An improved multiplexing capacity with an 11-plex setup was also demonstrated compared to a previous 3-plex setup, which is of great importance for the analysis of panels of biomarker targets."
https://openalex.org/W2789751669,"The treatment of condylar fractures has long been controversial. In this paper, we established a database for accurate measurement, storage, management and analysis of patients' data, in order to help determine the best treatment plan.First of all, the diagnosis and treatment database was established based on XNAT, including 339 cases of condylar fractures and their related information. Then image segmentation, registration and three-dimensional (3D) measurement were used to measure and analyze the condyle shapes. Statistical analysis was used to analyze the anatomical structure changes of condyle and the surrounding tissues at different stages before and after treatment. The processes of condylar fracture reestablishment at different stages were also dynamically monitored. Finally, based on all these information, the digital diagnosis and treatment plans for condylar fractures were developed.For the patients less than 18 years old with no significant dislocation, surgical treatment and conservative treatment were equally effective for intracapsular fracture, and had no significant difference for neck and basal fractures. For patients above 18 years old, there was no significant difference between the two treatment methods for intracapsular fractures; but for condylar neck and basal fractures, surgical treatment was better than conservative treatment. When condylar fracture shift angle was greater than 11 degrees, and mandibular ramus height reduction was greater than 4mm, the patients felt the strongest pain, and their mouths opening was severely restricted. There were 170 surgical cases with condylar fracture shift angel greater than 11 degrees, and 118 of them (69.4%) had good prognosis, 52 of them (30.6%) had complications such as limited mouth opening. There were 173 surgical cases with mandibular ramus height reduction more than 4mm, and 112 of them (64.7%) had good prognosis, 61 of them (35.3%) had complications such as limited mouth opening.The establishment of XNAT condylar fracture database is helpful for establishing a digital diagnosis and treatment workflow for mandibular condylar fractures, providing new theoretical foundation and application basis for diagnosis and treatment of condylar fractures."
https://openalex.org/W2790122397,"Plaque border irregularity is a known imaging characteristic of vulnerable plaques, but its evaluation heavily relies on subjective evaluation and operator expertise. Aim of the present work is to propose a novel fractal-analysis based method for the quantification of atherosclerotic plaque border irregularity and assess its relation with cardiovascular risk factors.Forty-two asymptomatic subjects with carotid stenosis underwent ultrasound evaluation and assessment of cardiovascular risk factors. Total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) plasma cholesterol and triglycerides concentrations were measured for each subject. Fractal analysis was performed in all the carotid segments affected by atherosclerosis, i.e. 147 segments. The resulting fractal dimension (FD) is a measure of irregularity of plaque profile on long axis view of the plaque. FD in the severest stenosis (main plaque FD,mFD) was 1.136±0.039. Average FD per patient (global FD,gFD) was 1.145±0.039. FD was independent of other plaque characteristics. mFD significantly correlated with plasma HDL (r = -0.367,p = 0.02) and triglycerides-to-HDL ratio (r = 0.480,p = 0.002).Fractal analysis is a novel, readily available, reproducible and inexpensive technique for the quantitative measurement of plaque irregularity. The correlation between low HDL levels and plaque FD suggests a role for HDL in the acquisition of morphologic features of plaque instability. Further studies are needed to validate the prognostic value of fractal analysis in carotid plaques evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W2791501434,"Many studies have sought to describe the relationship between sleep disturbance and cognition in Parkinson’s disease (PD). The Parkinson’s Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS) and its variants (the Parkinson’s disease Sleep Scale-Revised; PDSS-R, and the Parkinson’s Disease Sleep Scale-2; PDSS-2) quantify a range of symptoms impacting sleep in only 15 items. However, data from these scales may be problematic as included items have considerable conceptual breadth, and there may be overlap in the constructs assessed. Multidimensional measurement models, accounting for the tendency for items to measure multiple constructs, may be useful more accurately to model variance than traditional confirmatory factor analysis. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that a multidimensional model (a bifactor model) is more appropriate than traditional factor analysis for data generated by these types of scales, using data collected using the PDSS-R as an exemplar. 166 participants diagnosed with idiopathic PD participated in this study. Using PDSS-R data, we compared three models: a unidimensional model; a 3-factor model consisting of sub-factors measuring insomnia, motor symptoms and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) symptoms; and, a confirmatory bifactor model with both a general factor and the same three sub-factors. Only the confirmatory bifactor model achieved satisfactory model fit, suggesting that PDSS-R data are multidimensional. There were differential associations between factor scores and patient characteristics, suggesting that some PDSS-R items, but not others, are influenced by mood and personality in addition to sleep symptoms. Multidimensional measurement models may also be a helpful tool in the PDSS and the PDSS-2 scales and may improve the sensitivity of these instruments."
https://openalex.org/W2790054050,"Crosstalk between leukemic cells and the tumor microenvironment is of importance in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). T cells seem to sustain the survival of CLL cells by various mechanisms. The Krüppel-like family of transcription factors (KLFs) are identified as regulators of proliferation and cell death. In the present study, we analyzed the expression of the wild type (WT) gene KLF6 and the oncogenic splice variant 1 (KLF6-SV1) at the mRNA level in subsets of T cells from CLL patients (n = 29), multiple myeloma patients (n = 6) and normal donors (n = 10). RNA Silencing was used for wtKLF6 and KLF6-SV1. Tumor cell apoptosis was measured. A significant overexpression of wtKLF6 and KLF6-SV1 in T cells of CLL patients compared to normal donors and myeloma patients was noted (p<0.002). Western blot showed that both wtKLF6 and KLF6-SV1 were expressed in purified T cells from CLL patients. KLF6-SV1 siRNA transfection induced a significant down-regulation of KLF6-SV1 in CLL T cells, which lost the capability to sustain the growth of leukemic cells. However, no such a significant effect was seen after wtKLF6 transfection of the autologous T cells. The results suggest that KLF6-SV1 may play a role in the regulation of survival CLL cells."

Serial PET/MRI were performed before, 4 hours after and 1-week after vascular disrupting agent, CKD-516 at a dose of 0.7 mg/kg (treated group, n = 10) or saline (control group, n = 8) administration. PET/MRI-derived parameters and their interval changes were compared between the treated and control group by using the linear mixed model. Each parameter within each group was also compared by using the linear mixed model.Changes of the volume transfer coefficient (Ktrans) and the initial area under the gadolinium concentration-time curve until 60 seconds (iAUC) in the treated group were significantly larger compared with those in the control group at 4-hour follow-up (mean, -39.91% vs. -6.04%, P = 0.018; and -49.71% vs. +6.23%, P = 0.013). Change of metabolic tumor volume (MTV) in the treated group was significantly smaller compared with that in the control group at 1-week follow-up (mean, +118.34% vs. +208.87%, P = 0.044). Serial measurements in the treated group revealed that Ktrans and iAUC decreased at 4-hour follow-up (P < 0.001) and partially recovered at 1-week follow-up (P = 0.001 and 0.024, respectively). MTV increased at a 4-hour follow-up (P = 0.038) and further increased at a 1-week follow-up (P < 0.001), while total lesion glycolysis (TLG) did not show a significant difference between the time points. SUVmax and SUVmean did not show significant interval changes between time points (P > 0.05).PET/MRI is able to monitor the changes of vascular and metabolic parameters at different time points simultaneously, and confirmed that vascular changes precede the metabolic changes by VDA, CKD-516."
https://openalex.org/W2793590781,"The quality of life for people in urban regions can be improved by predicting urban human mobility and adjusting urban planning accordingly. In this study, we compared several possible variables to verify whether a gravity model (a human mobility prediction model borrowed from Newtonian mechanics) worked as well in inner-city regions as it did in intra-city regions. We reviewed the resident population, the number of employees, and the number of SNS posts as variables for generating mass values for an urban traffic gravity model. We also compared the straight-line distance, travel distance, and the impact of time as possible distance values. We defined the functions of urban regions on the basis of public records and SNS data to reflect the diverse social factors in urban regions. In this process, we conducted a dimension reduction method for the public record data and used a machine learning-based clustering algorithm for the SNS data. In doing so, we found that functional distance could be defined as the Euclidean distance between social function vectors in urban regions. Finally, we examined whether the functional distance was a variable that had a significant impact on urban human mobility."
https://openalex.org/W2794277882,"Standardized uptake values (SUVs) are the most widely used quantitative imaging biomarkers in PET. It is important to evaluate the variability and repeatability of measured SUVs. Phantom studies seem to be essential for this purpose; however, repetitive phantom scanning is not recommended due to the decay of radioactivity. In this study, we performed count-based image reconstruction to avoid the influence of decay using two different PET/CT scanners. By adjusting the ratio of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose solution to tap water, a NEMA IEC body phantom was set for SUVs of 4.0 inside six hot spheres. The PET data were obtained using two scanners (Aquiduo and Celesteion; Toshiba Medical Systems, Tochigi, Japan). We set the start time for image reconstruction when the total radioactivity in the phantom was 2.53 kBq/cc, and employed the counts of the first 2-min acquisition as the standard. To maintain the number of counts for each image, we set the acquisition time for image reconstruction depending on the decay of radioactivity. We obtained 50 images, and calculated the SUVmax and SUVpeak of all six spheres in each image. The average values of the SUVmax were used to calculate the recovery coefficients to compare those measured by the two different scanners. Bland-Altman analyses of the SUVs measured by the two scanners were also performed. The measured SUVs using the two scanners exhibited a 10–30% difference, and the standard deviation (SD) of the measured SUVs was between 0.1–0.2. The Celesteion always exhibited higher values than the Aquiduo. The smaller sphere exhibited a larger SD, and the SUVpeak had a smaller SD than the SUVmax. The Bland-Altman analyses showed poor agreement between the SUVs measured by the two scanners. The recovery coefficient curves obtained from the two scanners were considerably different. The Celesteion exhibited higher recovery coefficients than the Aquiduo, especially at approximately 20-mm-diameter. Additionally, the curves were lower than those calculated from the standard 30-min acquisition images. We propound count-based image reconstruction to evaluate the variability and repeatability of measured SUVs. These results are also applicable for the standardization and harmonization of SUVs in multi-institutional studies."
https://openalex.org/W2793654845,"Background Polyomaviruses, including simian virus 40 (SV40), display evidence of lymphotropic properties. This study analyzed the nature of SV40-human lymphocyte interactions in established cell lines and in primary lymphocytes. The effects of viral microRNA and the structure of the viral regulatory region on SV40 persistence were examined. Results SV40 DNA was maintained in infected B cell and myeloid cell lines during cell growth for at least 28 days. Limiting dilution analysis showed that low amounts of SV40 DNA (~2 copies per cell) were retained over time. Infected B cells remained viable and able to proliferate. Genome copies of the SV40 microRNA-null mutant persisted at higher levels than the DNA of wild-type viruses. Complex viral regulatory regions produced modestly higher DNA levels than simple regulatory regions. Viral large T-antigen protein was detected at low frequency and at low levels in infected B cells. Following infection of primary lymphocytes, SV40 DNA was detected in CD19+ B cells and CD14+ monocytes, but not in CD3+ T cells. Rescue attempts using either lysates of SV40-infected B lymphocytes, coculture of live cells, or infectious center assays all showed that replication-competent SV40 could be recovered on rare occasions. SV40 infections altered the expression of several B cell surface markers, with more pronounced changes following infections with the microRNA-null mutant. Conclusion These findings indicate that SV40 can establish persistent infections in human B lymphocytes. The cells retain low copy numbers of viral DNA; the infections are nonproductive and noncytolytic but can occasionally produce infectious virus. SV40 microRNA negatively regulates the degree of viral effects on B cells. Significance Lymphocytes may serve as viral reservoirs and may function to disseminate polyomaviruses to different tissues in a host. To our knowledge, this report is the first extensive analysis of viral microRNA effects on SV40 infection of human lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2793905357,"Previously, we reported the strong negative interference of calcium dobesilate, a vasoprotective agent, in creatinine assays involving the Trinder reaction. It is hypothesized that a similar effect occurs in the detection of uric acid (UA), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The interferences of calcium dobesilate during the detection of the five serum analytes were investigated on automated systems/analysers, and the effects were compared among eight different assay systems for each analyte. A calcium dobesilate standard was added into two sets of the blank serum pools of each analyte at final concentrations of 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 μg/mL. The percentage deviation of each analyte value was calculated between each drug concentration and the drug-free samples. The clinically acceptable error levels for UA, TC, TG, HDL-C, and LDL-C were defined as ±4.87%, ±4.1%, ±9.57%, ±5.61%, and ±5.46%, respectively. The observed interference was concentration dependent for each analyte. In the presence of 16 μg/mL calcium dobesilate, which was within the therapeutic range, all seven Trinder reaction-based UA assay systems, two TG assay systems, two HDL-C assay systems and one TC assay system exhibited negative drug interferences. Calcium dobesilate negatively interferes with the detection of UA, TG, TC, and HDL-C in assay systems based on the Trinder reaction. The effect was most significant in UA and TG detection."
https://openalex.org/W2791843606,"Diabetic neuropathy is the most common complication of diabetes and is frequently associated with foot ischemia and infection, but its pathogenesis is controversial. We hypothesized that proinsulin expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells is a process relevant to this condition and could represent a link among hyperglycemia, nerve susceptibility, and diabetic foot lesions. We assessed proinsulin expression by using flow cytometry in dendritic cells from control participants and patients with type 2 diabetes with or without peripheral neuropathy or accompanied by diabetic foot. Among 32 non-neuropathic and 120 neuropathic patients with type 2 diabetes, we performed leg electromyography and found average sensory sural nerve conduction velocities of 48 ± 4 and 30 ± 4 m/s, respectively ( P < 0.03). Of those with neuropathy, 42 were without lesions, 39 had foot lesions, and 39 had neuroischemic foot lesions (allux oximetry <30 mmHg). In this well-defined diabetic population, but not in nondiabetic participants, a progressively increasing level of peripheral blood dendritic cell proinsulin expression was detected, which directly correlated with circulating TNF-α levels ( P < 0.002) and multiple conduction velocities of leg nerves ( P < 0.05). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that, in type 2 diabetes, proinsulin-expressing blood cells, possibly via their involvement in innate immunity, may play a role in diabetic peripheral neuropathy and foot lesions.-Sambataro, M., Sambado, L., Trevisiol, E., Cacciatore, M., Furlan, A., Stefani, P.

https://openalex.org/W2791750381,"High-throughput technologies generate considerable amount of data which often requires bioinformatic expertise to analyze. Here we present High-Throughput Tabular Data Processor (HTDP), a platform independent Java program. HTDP works on any character-delimited column data (e.g. BED, GFF, GTF, PSL, WIG, VCF) from multiple text files and supports merging, filtering and converting of data that is produced in the course of high-throughput experiments. HTDP can also utilize itemized sets of conditions from external files for complex or repetitive filtering/merging tasks. The program is intended to aid global, real-time processing of large data sets using a graphical user interface (GUI). Therefore, no prior expertise in programming, regular expression, or command line usage is required of the user. Additionally, no a priori assumptions are imposed on the internal file composition. We demonstrate the flexibility and potential of HTDP in real-life research tasks including microarray and massively parallel sequencing, i.e. identification of disease predisposing variants in the next generation sequencing data as well as comprehensive concurrent analysis of microarray and sequencing results. We also show the utility of HTDP in technical tasks including data merge, reduction and filtering with external criteria files. HTDP was developed to address functionality that is missing or rudimentary in other GUI software for processing character-delimited column data from high-throughput technologies. Flexibility, in terms of input file handling, provides long term potential functionality in high-throughput analysis pipelines, as the program is not limited by the currently existing applications and data formats. HTDP is available as the Open Source software (https://github.com/pmadanecki/htdp)."
https://openalex.org/W2794007090,"Incarcerated people remain a priority group in efforts to control and reverse the HIV epidemic. Following release, social instability and reengagement in key transmission risk behaviors increase the risk of secondary transmission of HIV. Targeted programs have been developed to facilitate reengagement in care on reentry. Evaluation of the impact of these initiatives requires a systematic, confidential, framework for assessment of linkage to care for persons released from corrections. By linking HIV viral load surveillance data to corrections release data, the time to the first laboratory monitoring service in the community as well as the virologic status can be assessed. Using this method, we linked release data for sentenced individuals released from Massachusetts state correctional facilities in 2012 to HIV surveillance data from the Massachusetts HIV/AIDS Surveillance Program (MHASP) for the years 2012-2013. We identified 41 individuals with HIV released in 2012. Ninety-one percent had identified virologic assessments post release, 41% within 30 days. Thirty-three percent did not have a viral load assessed for more than 90 days and 31% had detectable virus at the time of their initial assessment. Persons with longer incarcerations (> 180 days) were more likely to have suppressed viral load at the time of follow-up (p = 0.05). This work demonstrates the important value of HIV laboratory surveillance data and correctional release data as a tool to assess linkage to care following release from corrections. We encourage jurisdictions to explore utilizing similar methodology to evaluate the effectiveness of the linkage to HIV care after release from incarceration."
https://openalex.org/W3121140817,"We provide evidence that a personality trait, aggression, has a first-order effect on group financial decision making. In a laboratory experiment on group portfolio choice, highly aggressive subjects (measured by a standard psychology test) were much more likely to recommend risky investment strategies consistent with their own personal information, regardless of the information received by other group members. Outside of this group context, aggression had no effect on subject behavior. Thus, our aggression measure appears to capture an aggressive disposition, which seeks to dominate group decisions, rather than simply reflect risk attitudes or cognitive biases."

https://openalex.org/W2788081262,"Mediation analysis is often based on fitting two models, one including and another excluding a potential mediator, and subsequently quantify the mediated effects by combining parameter estimates from these two models. Standard errors of such derived parameters may be approximated using the delta method. For a study evaluating a treatment effect on visual acuity, a binary outcome, we demonstrate how mediation analysis may conveniently be carried out by means of marginally fitted logistic regression models in combination with the delta method. Several metrics of mediation are estimated and results are compared to findings using existing methods."
