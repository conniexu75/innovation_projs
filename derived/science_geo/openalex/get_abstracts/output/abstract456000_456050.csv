https://openalex.org/W2170039745,"Mice carrying mutations in multiple genes are traditionally generated by sequential recombination in embryonic stem cells and/or time-consuming intercrossing of mice with a single mutation. The CRISPR/Cas system has been adapted as an efficient gene-targeting technology with the potential for multiplexed genome editing. We demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene editing allows the simultaneous disruption of five genes (Tet1, 2, 3, Sry, Uty - 8 alleles) in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells with high efficiency. Coinjection of Cas9 mRNA and single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting Tet1 and Tet2 into zygotes generated mice with biallelic mutations in both genes with an efficiency of 80%. Finally, we show that coinjection of Cas9 mRNA/sgRNAs with mutant oligos generated precise point mutations simultaneously in two target genes. Thus, the CRISPR/Cas system allows the one-step generation of animals carrying mutations in multiple genes, an approach that will greatly accelerate the in vivo study of functionally redundant genes and of epistatic gene interactions."

Britnell et al. (p. 1311 , published online 2 May; see the Perspective by Hamm and Hess ) sandwiched a single layer of the transition metal dichalcogenide WS 2 between two sheets of graphene. The photocurrent response of the heterostructure device was enhanced, compared to that of the bare layer of WS 2 . The prospect of combining single or several-atom-thick layers into heterostructures should help to develop materials with a wide range of properties."

As sizes get smaller, fixed-winged flight becomes less efficient because of increased drag resistance. Ma et al. (p. 603 ) developed a tethered robotic fly with wings that flap through the use of piezo-electric materials. Control of the flight motion involved a feedback process, which allowed the tethered robotic fly to hover and make controlled flight maneuvers."
https://openalex.org/W2044071145,"The manipulation of traditionally unreactive functional groups is of paramount importance in modern chemical synthesis. We have developed an iron-dipyrrinato catalyst that leverages the reactivity of iron-borne metal-ligand multiple bonds to promote the direct amination of aliphatic C-H bonds. Exposure of organic azides to the iron dipyrrinato catalyst furnishes saturated, cyclic amine products (N-heterocycles) bearing complex core-substitution patterns. This study highlights the development of C-H bond functionalization chemistry for the formation of saturated, cyclic amine products and should find broad application in the context of both pharmaceuticals and natural product synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2003835684,"Human pluripotent stem cells are a powerful tool for modeling brain development and disease. The human cortex is composed of two major neuronal populations: projection neurons and local interneurons. Cortical interneurons comprise a diverse class of cell types expressing the neurotransmitter GABA. Dysfunction of cortical interneurons has been implicated in neuropsychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia, autism, and epilepsy. Here, we demonstrate the highly efficient derivation of human cortical interneurons in an NKX2.1::GFP human embryonic stem cell reporter line. Manipulating the timing of SHH activation yields three distinct GFP+ populations with specific transcriptional profiles, neurotransmitter phenotypes, and migratory behaviors. Further differentiation in a murine cortical environment yields parvalbumin- and somatostatin-expressing neurons that exhibit synaptic inputs and electrophysiological properties of cortical interneurons. Our study defines the signals sufficient for modeling human ventral forebrain development in vitro and lays the foundation for studying cortical interneuron involvement in human disease pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2057431271,"Directed differentiation from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) has seen significant progress in recent years. However, most differentiated populations exhibit immature properties of an early embryonic stage, raising concerns about their ability to model and treat disease. Here, we report the directed differentiation of hPSCs into medial ganglionic eminence (MGE)-like progenitors and their maturation into forebrain type interneurons. We find that early-stage progenitors progress via a radial glial-like stem cell enriched in the human fetal brain. Both in vitro and posttransplantation into the rodent cortex, the MGE-like cells develop into GABAergic interneuron subtypes with mature physiological properties along a prolonged intrinsic timeline of up to 7 months, mimicking endogenous human neural development. MGE-derived cortical interneuron deficiencies are implicated in a broad range of neurodevelopmental and degenerative disorders, highlighting the importance of these results for modeling human neural development and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2119110453,"Lamin and emerin mutations causing cardiomyopathies are associated with an impairment in actin dynamics, resulting in aberrant nuclear translocation and downstream signalling of the transcription factor MKL1, which is pivotal for cardiac development. Mutations in the nearly ubiquitously expressed nuclear envelope proteins lamin A/C and emerin can result in highly tissue-specific diseases such as Emery–Dreifuss muscular dystrophy and dilated cardiomyopathy. This study shows that mutations in lamins are associated with impairment in actin dynamics that causes aberrant nuclear translocation and downstream signalling of the transcription factor MKL1, which is pivotal for cardiac development. These results demonstrate the diverse impacts that nuclear envelope proteins have on cellular processes and suggest that therapies that correct impaired MKL1–SRF signalling may help to control cardiac disease associated with laminopathies. Laminopathies, caused by mutations in the LMNA gene encoding the nuclear envelope proteins lamins A and C, represent a diverse group of diseases that include Emery–Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, and Hutchison–Gilford progeria syndrome1. Most LMNA mutations affect skeletal and cardiac muscle by mechanisms that remain incompletely understood. Loss of structural function and altered interaction of mutant lamins with (tissue-specific) transcription factors have been proposed to explain the tissue-specific phenotypes1. Here we report in mice that lamin-A/C-deficient (Lmna−/−) and LmnaN195K/N195K mutant cells have impaired nuclear translocation and downstream signalling of the mechanosensitive transcription factor megakaryoblastic leukaemia 1 (MKL1), a myocardin family member that is pivotal in cardiac development and function2. Altered nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of MKL1 was caused by altered actin dynamics in Lmna−/− and LmnaN195K/N195K mutant cells. Ectopic expression of the nuclear envelope protein emerin, which is mislocalized in Lmna mutant cells and also linked to EDMD and DCM, restored MKL1 nuclear translocation and rescued actin dynamics in mutant cells. These findings present a novel mechanism that could provide insight into the disease aetiology for the cardiac phenotype in many laminopathies, whereby lamin A/C and emerin regulate gene expression through modulation of nuclear and cytoskeletal actin polymerization."

Islam et al. (p. 583 ) study a system of 16 trapped ions, using the Coulomb interactions between the ions to simulate exchange interactions present in magnetic systems. The measured spin correlations provide a window into the behavior of the system, as the effective magnetic field and the range of the interactions are tuned."

This Perspective covers recent discoveries about the dynamic patterning and structural self-formation of complex organ buds in 3D stem cell culture, including the generation of various neuroectodermal and endodermal tissues. For some tissues, epithelial-mesenchymal interactions can also be manipulated in coculture to guide organogenesis. This new area of stem cell research-the spatiotemporal control of dynamic cellular interactions-will open a new avenue for next-generation regenerative medicine."
https://openalex.org/W1966564846,"microRNAs regulate developmental cell-fate decisions, tissue homeostasis, and oncogenesis in distinct ways relative to proteins. Here, we show that the tumor suppressor microRNA miR-34a is a cell-fate determinant in early-stage dividing colon cancer stem cells (CCSCs). In pair-cell assays, miR-34a distributes at high levels in differentiating progeny, whereas low levels of miR-34a demarcate self-renewing CCSCs. Moreover, miR-34a loss of function and gain of function alter the balance between self-renewal versus differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, miR-34a sequesters Notch1 mRNA to generate a sharp threshold response where a bimodal Notch signal specifies the choice between self-renewal and differentiation. In contrast, the canonical cell-fate determinant Numb regulates Notch levels in a continuously graded manner. Altogether, our findings highlight a unique microRNA-regulated mechanism that converts noisy input into a toggle switch for robust cell-fate decisions in CCSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2009743738,"Roles for long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in gene expression are emerging, but regulation of the lncRNA itself is poorly understood. We have identified a homeodomain protein, AtNDX, that regulates COOLAIR, a set of antisense transcripts originating from the 3' end of Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). AtNDX associates with single-stranded DNA rather than double-stranded DNA non-sequence-specifically in vitro, and localizes to a heterochromatic region in the COOLAIR promoter in vivo. Single-stranded DNA was detected in vivo as part of an RNA-DNA hybrid, or R-loop, that covers the COOLAIR promoter. R-loop stabilization mediated by AtNDX inhibits COOLAIR transcription, which in turn modifies FLC expression. Differential stabilization of R-loops could be a general mechanism influencing gene expression in many organisms."

However, the contribution of sensory cues such as smells, sounds, and textures, etc., is difficult to eliminate. In virtual reality, these cues will not provide any information about the animals' position. Ravassard et al. (p. 1342 , published online 2 May) developed a virtual-reality system as immersive and close to the real world as possible and compared place cells in rats running in this apparatus and in the real world. Twice as many neurons were active in a real-world situation compared to virtual reality. While place cells in the real world encoded position, place cells in a virtual world encoded distance."

https://openalex.org/W2007698854,"Superoxide and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) originate from several natural sources and profoundly influence numerous elemental cycles, including carbon and trace metals. In the deep ocean, the permanent absence of light precludes currently known ROS sources, yet ROS production mysteriously occurs. Here, we show that taxonomically and ecologically diverse heterotrophic bacteria from aquatic and terrestrial environments are a vast, unrecognized, and light-independent source of superoxide, and perhaps other ROS derived from superoxide. Superoxide production by a model bacterium within the ubiquitous Roseobacter clade involves an extracellular oxidoreductase that is stimulated by the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), suggesting a surprising homology with eukaryotic organisms. The consequences of ROS cycling in immense aphotic zones representing key sites of nutrient regeneration and carbon export must now be considered, including potential control of carbon remineralization and metal bioavailability."
https://openalex.org/W2000450402,"Influencing Influenza Currently, there is anxiety that the avian H5N1 influenza virus will reassort with the highly transmissible and epidemic H1N1 subtype to trigger a virulent human pandemic. Y. Zhang et al. (p. 1459 , published online 2 May) used reverse genetics to make all possible reassortants between a virulent bird H5N1 with genes from a human pandemic H1N1. Virulence was tested in mice and transmissibility was tested between guinea pigs, which have both avian- and human-like airway influenza virus receptors. To assess what is happening to the receptor-ligand interactions as a result of these mutations, W. Zhang et al. (p. 1463 , published online 2 May) probed the structure of both wild-type and mutant hemagglutinin of H5 in complex with analogs of the avian and human receptor types. Certain mutations in the receptor-binding site changed binding affinity."
https://openalex.org/W2043399100,"Embryonic stem cell (ESC) pluripotency is governed by a gene regulatory network centered on the transcription factors Oct4 and Nanog. To date, robust self-renewing ESC states have only been obtained through the chemical inhibition of signaling pathways or enforced transgene expression. Here, we show that ESCs with reduced Oct4 expression resulting from heterozygosity also exhibit a stabilized pluripotent state. Despite having reduced Oct4 expression, Oct4(+/-) ESCs show increased genome-wide binding of Oct4, particularly at pluripotency-associated enhancers, homogeneous expression of pluripotency transcription factors, enhanced self-renewal efficiency, and delayed differentiation kinetics. Cells also exhibit increased Wnt expression, enhanced leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) sensitivity, and reduced responsiveness to fibroblast growth factor. Although they are able to maintain pluripotency in the absence of bone morphogenetic protein, removal of LIF destabilizes pluripotency. Our findings suggest that cells with a reduced Oct4 concentration range are maintained in a robust pluripotent state and that the wild-type Oct4 concentration range enables effective differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2018560113,"Mesp1 is regarded as the master regulator of cardiovascular development, initiating the cardiac transcription factor cascade to direct the generation of cardiac mesoderm. To define the early embryonic cell population that responds to Mesp1, we performed pulse inductions of gene expression over tight temporal windows following embryonic stem cell differentiation. Remarkably, instead of promoting cardiac differentiation in the initial wave of mesoderm, Mesp1 binds to the Tal1 (Scl) +40 kb enhancer and generates Flk-1+ precursors expressing Etv2 (ER71) and Tal1 that undergo hematopoietic differentiation. The second wave of mesoderm responds to Mesp1 by differentiating into PDGFRα+ precursors that undergo cardiac differentiation. Furthermore, in the absence of serum-derived factors, Mesp1 promotes skeletal myogenic differentiation. Lineage tracing revealed that the majority of yolk sac and many adult hematopoietic cells derive from Mesp1+ precursors. Thus, Mesp1 is a context-dependent determination factor, integrating the stage of differentiation and the signaling environment to specify different lineage outcomes."

https://openalex.org/W2068774954,"The mechanisms through which iron-dependent enzymes receive their metal cofactors are largely unknown. Poly r(C)-binding protein 1 (PCBP1) is an iron chaperone for ferritin; both PCBP1 and its paralog PCBP2 are required for iron delivery to the prolyl hydroxylase that regulates HIF1. Here we show that PCBP2 is also an iron chaperone for ferritin. Co-expression of PCBP2 and human ferritins in yeast activated the iron deficiency response and increased iron deposition into ferritin. Depletion of PCBP2 in Huh7 cells diminished iron incorporation into ferritin. Both PCBP1 and PCBP2 were co-immunoprecipitated with ferritin in HEK293 cells, and expression of both PCBPs was required for ferritin complex formation in cells. PCBP1 and -2 exhibited high affinity binding to ferritin in vitro. Mammalian genomes encode 4 PCBPs, including the minimally expressed PCBPs 3 and 4. Expression of PCBP3 and -4 in yeast activated the iron deficiency response, but only PCBP3 exhibited strong interactions with ferritin. Expression of PCBP1 and ferritin in an iron-sensitive, ccc1 yeast strain intensified the toxic effects of iron, whereas expression of PCBP4 protected the cells from iron toxicity. Thus, PCBP1 and -2 form a complex for iron delivery to ferritin, and all PCBPs may share iron chaperone activity."

https://openalex.org/W2078111119,"The cerebellum fine-tunes motor activity via its Purkinje cell output. Purkinje cells produce two different types of spikes, complex spikes and simple spikes, which often show reciprocal activity: a periodical increase in complex spikes is associated with a decrease in simple spikes, and vice versa. This reciprocal firing is thought to be essential for coordinated motor behavior, yet how it is accomplished is debated. Here, we show in Ptf1a::cre;Robo3lox/lox mice that selectively rerouting the climbing fibers from a contralateral to an ipsilateral projection reversed the complex-spike modulation during sensory stimulation. Strikingly, modulation of simple spikes, which is supposed to be controlled by mossy fibers, reversed as well. Climbing fibers enforce this reciprocity in part by influencing activity of inhibitory interneurons, because the phase of their activity was also converted. Ptf1a::cre;Robo3lox/lox mice showed severe ataxia highlighting that climbing fiber input and its impact on reciprocity of Purkinje cell firing play an important role in motor coordination."
https://openalex.org/W2058963806,"Recent studies have identified several mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein that allow the highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza A virus to transmit between mammals by airborne route. Here, we determined the complex structures of wild-type and mutant HAs derived from an Indonesia H5N1 virus bound to either avian or human receptor sialic acid analogs. A cis/trans conformational change in the glycosidic linkage of the receptor analog was observed, which explains how the H5N1 virus alters its receptor-binding preference. Furthermore, the mutant HA possessed low affinities for both avian and human receptors. Our findings provide a structural and biophysical basis for the H5N1 adaptation to acquire human, but maintain avian, receptor-binding properties."
https://openalex.org/W2003502313,"Neurofibrillary pathology of abnormally hyperphosphorylated Tau is a key lesion of Alzheimer disease and other tauopathies, and its density in the brain directly correlates with dementia. The phosphorylation of Tau is regulated by protein phosphatase 2A, which in turn is regulated by inhibitor 2, I2(PP2A). In acidic conditions such as generated by brain ischemia and hypoxia, especially in association with hyperglycemia as in diabetes, I2(PP2A) is cleaved by asparaginyl endopeptidase at Asn-175 into the N-terminal fragment (I2NTF) and the C-terminal fragment (I2CTF). Both I2NTF and I2CTF are known to bind to the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A and inhibit its activity. Here we show that the level of activated asparaginyl endopeptidase is significantly increased, and this enzyme and I2(PP2A) translocate, respectively, from neuronal lysosomes and nucleus to the cytoplasm where they interact and are associated with hyperphosphorylated Tau in Alzheimer disease brain. Asparaginyl endopeptidase from Alzheimer disease brain could cleave GST-I2(PP2A), except when I2(PP2A) was mutated at the cleavage site Asn-175 to Gln. Finally, an induction of acidosis by treatment with kainic acid or pH 6.0 medium activated asparaginyl endopeptidase and consequently produced the cleavage of I2(PP2A), inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A, and hyperphosphorylation of Tau, and the knockdown of asparaginyl endopeptidase with siRNA abolished this pathway in SH-SY5Y cells. These findings suggest the involvement of brain acidosis in the etiopathogenesis of Alzheimer disease, and asparaginyl endopeptidase-I2(PP2A)-protein phosphatase 2A-Tau hyperphosphorylation pathway as a therapeutic target."

We obtained mice bearing both heterozygous and homozygous mutations at this locus. We find that these mice display, in a mutation dose-dependent manner, erythrocytosis and pulmonary hypertension with a high degree of penetrance. These findings firmly establish missense mutations in HIF-2α as a cause of erythrocytosis, highlight the importance of this HIF-α isoform in erythropoiesis, and point to physiologic consequences of HIF-2α dysregulation.Background: Missense mutations have been identified in the HIF2A gene in patients with erythrocytosis.Results: A mouse knock-in line that models the first described HIF2A mutation exhibits erythrocytosis and pulmonary hypertension.Conclusion: The missense mutation is the cause of erythrocytosis, and is accompanied by pulmonary hypertension.Significance: The study demonstrates sequelae of global Hif-2α gain of function.

https://openalex.org/W2085712839,"It was shown previously that abnormal prohormone processing or inactive proconverting enzymes that are responsible for this processing cause profound obesity. Our laboratory demonstrated earlier that in the diet-induced obesity (DIO) state, the appetite-suppressing neuropeptide α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) is reduced, yet the mRNA of its precursor protein proopiomelanocortin (POMC) remained unaltered. It was also shown that the DIO condition promotes the development of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and leptin resistance. In the current study, using an in vivo model combined with in vitro experiments, we demonstrate that obesity-induced ER stress obstructs the post-translational processing of POMC by decreasing proconverting enzyme 2, which catalyzes the conversion of adrenocorticotropin to α-MSH, thereby decreasing α-MSH peptide production.

https://openalex.org/W2088645977,"The FGF14 protein controls biophysical properties and subcellular distribution of neuronal voltage-gated Na(+) (Nav) channels through direct binding to the channel C terminus. To gain insights into the dynamic regulation of this protein/protein interaction complex, we employed the split luciferase complementation assay to screen a small molecule library of kinase inhibitors against the FGF14·Nav1.6 channel complex and identified inhibitors of GSK3 as hits. Through a combination of a luminescence-based counter-screening, co-immunoprecipitation, patch clamp electrophysiology, and quantitative confocal immunofluorescence, we demonstrate that inhibition of GSK3 reduces the assembly of the FGF14·Nav channel complex, modifies FGF14-dependent regulation of Na(+) currents, and induces dissociation and subcellular redistribution of the native FGF14·Nav channel complex in hippocampal neurons. These results further emphasize the role of FGF14 as a critical component of the Nav channel macromolecular complex, providing evidence for a novel GSK3-dependent signaling pathway that might control excitability through specific protein/protein interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2062855385,"APOBEC3A (A3A) is a myeloid lineage-specific DNA cytosine deaminase with a role in innate immunity to foreign DNA. Previous studies have shown that heterologously expressed A3A is genotoxic, suggesting that monocytes may have a mechanism to regulate this enzyme. Indeed, we observed no significant cytotoxicity when interferon was used to induce the expression of endogenous A3A in CD14(+)-enriched primary cells or the monocytic cell line THP-1. In contrast, doxycycline-induced A3A in HEK293 cells caused major cytotoxicity at protein levels lower than those observed when CD14(+) cells were stimulated with interferon. Immunofluorescent microscopy of interferon-stimulated CD14(+) and THP-1 cells revealed that endogenous A3A is cytoplasmic, in stark contrast to stably or transiently transfected A3A, which has a cell-wide localization. A3A constructs engineered to be cytoplasmic are also nontoxic in HEK293 cells. These data combine to suggest that monocytic cells use a cytoplasmic retention mechanism to control A3A and avert genotoxicity during innate immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W2121935609,"The proteasome degrades ubiquitin-conjugated substrates; here, structural and functional insights from studies in yeast reveal that it is reconfigured during chaperone-mediated assembly. The proteasome is a protein complex that degrades ubiquitin-conjugated substrates. The 26S proteasome consists of a core particle (CP) and a regulatory particle (RP) formed of a base and lid. In this study, Daniel Finley and colleagues present structural and functional insights into the assembly of the base–CP complex. The proteasomal ATPase ring, comprising Rpt1–Rpt6, associates with the heptameric α-ring of the proteasome core particle (CP) in the mature proteasome, with the Rpt carboxy-terminal tails inserting into pockets of the α-ring1,2,3,4. Rpt ring assembly is mediated by four chaperones, each binding a distinct Rpt subunit5,6,7,8,9,10. Here we report that the base subassembly of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteasome, which includes the Rpt ring, forms a high-affinity complex with the CP. This complex is subject to active dissociation by the chaperones Hsm3, Nas6 and Rpn14. Chaperone-mediated dissociation was abrogated by a non-hydrolysable ATP analogue, indicating that chaperone action is coupled to nucleotide hydrolysis by the Rpt ring. Unexpectedly, synthetic Rpt tail peptides bound α-pockets with poor specificity, except for Rpt6, which uniquely bound the α2/α3-pocket. Although the Rpt6 tail is not visualized within an α-pocket in mature proteasomes2,3,4, it inserts into the α2/α3-pocket in the base–CP complex and is important for complex formation. Thus, the Rpt–CP interface is reconfigured when the lid complex joins the nascent proteasome to form the mature holoenzyme."

Results: Depletion of ferroxidase and ferroportin from human brain microvascular endothelial cells decreases their ability to efflux iron. Conclusion: Iron efflux from brain microvascular endothelial cell ferroportin requires exocytoplasmic ferroxidase activity. Significance: The mechanism of iron efflux from endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier is fundamental to how iron enters the brain."

Here we identify pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) as a novel PTP1B substrate in adipocytes. PTP1B deficiency leads to increased PKM2 total tyrosine and Tyr(105) phosphorylation in cultured adipocytes and in vivo. Substrate trapping and mutagenesis studies identify PKM2 Tyr-105 and Tyr-148 as key sites that mediate PTP1B-PKM2 interaction. In addition, in vitro analyses illustrate a direct effect of Tyr-105 phosphorylation on PKM2 activity in adipocytes. Importantly, PTP1B pharmacological inhibition increased PKM2 Tyr-105 phosphorylation and decreased PKM2 activity. Moreover, PKM2 Tyr-105 phosphorylation is regulated nutritionally, decreasing in adipose tissue depots after high-fat feeding. Further, decreased PKM2 Tyr-105 phosphorylation correlates with the development of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in rodents, non-human primates, and humans. Together, these findings identify PKM2 as a novel substrate of PTP1B and provide new insights into the regulation of adipose PKM2 activity."

https://openalex.org/W2086855587,"FGFRL1 is a newly identified member of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family expressed in adult pancreas. Unlike canonical FGFRs that initiate signaling via tyrosine kinase domains, the short intracellular sequence of FGFRL1 consists of a putative Src homology domain-2 (SH2)-binding motif adjacent to a histidine-rich C terminus. As a consequence of nonexistent kinase domains, FGFRL1 has been postulated to act as a decoy receptor to inhibit canonical FGFR ligand-induced signaling. In pancreatic islet beta-cells, canonical FGFR1 signaling affects metabolism and insulin processing. This study determined beta-cell expression of FGFRL1 as well as consequent effects on FGFR1 signaling and biological responses. We confirmed FGFRL1 expression at the plasma membrane and within distinct intracellular granules of both primary beta-cells and βTC3 cells. Fluorescent protein-tagged FGFRL1 (RL1) induced a significant ligand-independent increase in MAPK signaling. Removal of the histidine-rich domain (RL1-ΔHis) or entire intracellular sequence (RL1-ΔC) resulted in greater retention at the plasma membrane and significantly reduced ligand-independent ERK1/2 responses. The SHP-1 phosphatase was identified as an RL1-binding substrate. Point mutation of the SH2-binding motif reduced the ability of FGFRL1 to bind SHP-1 and activate ERK1/2 but did not affect receptor localization to insulin secretory granules. Finally, overexpression of RL1 increased cellular insulin content and matrix adhesion. Overall, these data suggest that FGFRL1 does not function as a decoy receptor in beta-cells, but rather it enhances ERK1/2 signaling through association of SHP-1 with the receptor's intracellular SH2-binding motif."
https://openalex.org/W2095302366,"Insulin activates a cascade of signaling molecules, including Rac-1, Akt, and AS160, to promote the net gain of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) at the plasma membrane of muscle cells. Interestingly, constitutively active Rac-1 expression results in a hormone-independent increase in surface GLUT4; however, the molecular mechanism and significance behind this effect remain unresolved. Using L6 myoblasts stably expressing myc-tagged GLUT4, we found that overexpression of constitutively active but not wild-type Rac-1 sufficed to drive GLUT4 translocation to the membrane of comparable magnitude with that elicited by insulin. Stimulation of endogenous Rac-1 by Tiam1 overexpression elicited a similar hormone-independent gain in surface GLUT4. This effect on GLUT4 traffic could also be reproduced by acutely activating a Rac-1 construct via rapamycin-mediated heterodimerization. Strategies triggering Rac-1 ""superactivation"" (i.e. to levels above those attained by insulin alone) produced a modest gain in plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, moderate Akt activation, and substantial AS160 phosphorylation, which translated into GLUT4 translocation and negated the requirement for IRS-1. This unique signaling capacity exerted by Rac-1 superactivation bypassed the defects imposed by JNK- and ceramide-induced insulin resistance and allowed full and partial restoration of the GLUT4 translocation response, respectively. We propose that potent elevation of Rac-1 activation alone suffices to drive insulin-independent GLUT4 translocation in muscle cells, and such a strategy might be exploited to bypass signaling defects during insulin resistance."

A previously reported LQT9 patient had prominent U waves on ECG, a feature that has been correlated with Kir2.1 loss of function. Our objective was to determine whether caveolin 3 (Cav3) associates with Kir2.1 and whether LQT9-associated CAV3 mutations affect the biophysical properties of Kir2.1. Kir2.1 current (IK1) density was measured using the whole-cell voltage clamp technique. WT-Cav3 did not affect IK1. However, F97C-Cav3 and T78M-Cav3 decreased IK1 density significantly by ∼60%, and P104L-Cav3 decreased IK1 density significantly by ∼30% at -60 mV. Immunostained rat heart cryosections and HEK293 cells cotransfected with Kir2.1 and WT-Cav3 both demonstrated colocalization of Kir2.1 and WT-Cav3 by confocal imaging. Cav3 coimmunoprecipitated with Kir2.1 in human ventricular myocytes and in heterologous expression systems. Additionally, FRET efficiency was highly specific, with a molecular distance of 5.6 ± 0.4 nm, indicating close protein location. Colocalization experiments found that Cav3 and Kir2.1 accumulated in the Golgi compartment. On-cell Western blot analysis showed decreased Kir2.1 cell surface expression by 60% when expressed with F97C-Cav3 and by 20% when expressed with P104L-Cav3 compared with WT-Cav3. This is the first report of an association between Cav3 and Kir2.1. The Cav3 mutations F97C-Cav3, P104L-Cav3, and T78M-Cav3 decreased IK1 density significantly. This effect was related to a reduced cell surface expression of Kir2.1. Kir2.1 loss of function is additive to the increase described previously in late INa, prolonging repolarization and leading to arrhythmia generation in Cav3-mediated LQT9."
https://openalex.org/W1971308852,"Homeostasis is essential for cell survival. However, homeostatic regulation of surface epithelia is poorly understood. The eye surface, lacking the cornified barrier of skin, provides an excellent model. Tears cover the surface of the eye and are deficient in dry eye, the most common eye disease affecting at least 5% of the world's population. Only a tiny fraction of the tear proteome appears to be affected, including lacritin, an epithelium-selective mitogen that promotes basal tearing when topically applied to rabbit eyes. Here we show that homeostasis of cultured corneal epithelia is entirely lacritin-dependent and elucidate the mechanism as a rapid autophagic flux to promptly restore cellular metabolism and mitochondrial fusion in keeping with the short residence time of lacritin on the eye. Accelerated flux appears to be derived from lacritin-stimulated acetylation of FOXO3 as a novel ligand for ATG101 and coupling of stress-acetylated FOXO1 with ATG7 (which remains uncoupled without lacritin) and be sufficient to selectively divert huntingtin mutant Htt103Q aggregates largely without affecting non-aggregated Htt25Q. This is in keeping with stress as a prerequisite for lacritin-stimulated autophagy. Lacritin targets the cell surface proteoglycan syndecan-1 via its C-terminal amino acids Leu(108)-Leu(109)-Phe(112) and is also available in saliva, plasma, and lung lavage. Thus, lacritin may promote epithelial homeostasis widely."

Managing patients’ therapeutic hope and spiritual distress—in addition to tighter regulation of commercial therapies and improved patient understanding—may offer a more comprehensive approach to reducing the overall incidence of stem cell tourism. Such patient support must occur early in the clinical relationship after appropriate assessment and discussion. “But what we call our despair is often only the painful eagerness of unfed hope.”—George Eliot, Middlemarch One of the most serious ethical problems facing stem cell science today concerns the large number of gravely ill adult and pediatric patients who travel for unproven stem cell treatments marketed via the Internet (Petersen and Seear, 2011Petersen A. Seear K. New Genetics and Society. 2011; 30: 329-346Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar; Levine and Wolf, 2012Levine A.D. Wolf L.E. JLME. 2012; 40: 122-134Google Scholar). This global phenomenon (hereafter referred to as stem cell tourism) puts patients and their families at risk of physical, financial, and emotional harm by unscrupulous snake oil salesmen bent on profiting off of people’s unfed hopes. In response, stem cell researchers, clinicians, bioethicists, policymakers, and professional societies like the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) have advocated strategies to reduce both the supply and the demand for stem cell tourism—the first of which is encouraging local governments and national regulatory bodies to crack down on fraudulent stem cell clinics, and the second of which is arming patients with information to discourage them from crossing borders to pursue fraudulent and potentially dangerous stem cell treatments. The ISSCR, for example, has developed a “Patient Handbook on Stem Cell Therapies,” which is available in multiple languages (http://www.isscr.org/home/publications/patient-handbook). Its purpose is to address common patient misperceptions about stem cell treatments and research. The ISSCR has also created a website called “A Closer Look at Stem Cell Treatments”—again, to help inform patients about the reality and dangers of unproven commercial stem cell therapies (http://www.closerlookatstemcells.org). Another group has advocated for better physician education about stem cell therapies, so that doctors can advise patients against traveling to offshore stem cell clinics (Caulfield and Zarzeczny, 2012Caulfield T. Zarzeczny A. Toronto Stem Cell Working GroupCan. Fam. Physician. 2012; 58 (e182–e185): 365-368PubMed Google Scholar). Efforts such as these emphasize the importance of regulation and information to reduce the overall incidence of stem cell tourism. As someone who has been closely involved with the above efforts, I believe these strategies are extremely important, but they may not be enough. While patient misinformation can often fuel a demand for stem cell tourism, therapeutic hope and spiritual distress might also be powerful motivators for those seeking unproven stem cell treatments. Therapeutic hope and spiritual distress (concepts that I define and analyze below) are complicated issues that require more than providing decision makers with the right information. Drawing on the academic literature from family medicine, nursing, and positive psychology, I discuss the complexities of therapeutic hope and spiritual distress, and I recommend some practical approaches to managing these possible conduits to stem cell tourism. What is therapeutic hope? At first glance, it may be tempting to lump therapeutic hope together with the more familiar notions of therapeutic misconception and misestimation. But there are some important differences, and these differences have implications for how we ought to manage therapeutic hope. The first difference is that therapeutic misconception and misestimation both fundamentally involve patient misunderstandings, whereas therapeutic hope need not. Patients might understand when an intervention’s chances of success are extremely remote at best, but may still want to “give it a shot” as long as a beneficial outcome cannot be ruled out as categorically impossible. The second important difference is that both therapeutic misconception and misestimation are viewed as problems associated with the enrollment of human subjects in biomedical research. Therapeutic hope, in contrast, is not restricted to a research context, for it often comes into play for patients and their families across a full range of clinical care settings, and can be especially powerful in serious cases where there may be few or no acceptable medical alternatives left. These differences may suggest to some readers that therapeutic hope is a deeply emotional, sometimes irrational motive not always amenable to rational discussion and realistic prognostications. This, I believe, would be to misunderstand of the nature of therapeutic hope. Hope is not some vague, amorphous yearning for something good to occur. In the psychological literature, hope is understood as having a dynamic “architecture” composed of (1) goal-directedness; (2) pathway thoughts concerning how to achieve one’s goals; and (3) the perception that one has the ability to pursue these pathways (Snyder, 2000Snyder C.R. Hypothesis: there is hope.in: Snyder C.R. Handbook of Hope: Theory, Measures, and Applications. Academies Press, San Diego2000: 3-21Crossref Google Scholar; Feudtner, 2009Feudtner C. N. Engl. J. Med. 2009; 361: 2306-2307Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Hope differs from wishful thinking in that the former is based on what a person believes are realistic expectations, and hope generates future-oriented behaviors. Unlike passive expectations or mere wishes, hope involves the active pursuit of valued goals through perceived pathways. This dynamic understanding of the nature of hope has direct relevance for our discussion of stem cell tourism. If a patient is motivated by therapeutic hope to pursue a commercial stem cell therapy, it is likely that this motivation will have the following structure: (1) the patient has the goal of disease amelioration; (2) he or she believes stem cell therapy is a pathway to this goal; and (3) he or she believes he or she is capable of pursuing this pathway by traveling to a stem cell clinic. Better patient education may (with limited success) cause a patient to reevaluate whether a proffered stem cell therapy is likely to serve as a pathway to his or her goal. In the ideal case, this reevaluation will cause the patient to abandon his or her plans to travel to a stem cell clinic. But notice how this informative approach does nothing to address the patient’s wider range of goals or to provide any alternative pathways. Failure to address the full complexity of therapeutic hope could have negative consequences for the patient. One negative consequence is that the patient may lose the will to remain actively engaged with his or her future well being. Typically when a person loses one pathway to a goal, this loss is followed by a shift to a new pathway, and the person remains emotionally engaged with the future. But when a goal is deemed unattainable because of a frustrated pathway and no new pathway emerges to take its place, then a person may disengage with any future-oriented behavior, or, alternatively, may fail to disengage completely from a lost goal and suffer as a result by failing to respond to new opportunities (Carver and Scheier, 1998Carver C.S. Scheier M.F. On the self-regulation of behavior. Cambridge University Press, New York1998Crossref Google Scholar). The take-home message of this analysis is that when one pathway becomes closed for a patient, another one must be offered in its place that could address his or her goals. Patients who seek a commercial stem cell therapy may view the treatment as a pathway to several other important goals related to their goal of disease amelioration. Indeed, the goal of disease amelioration may function as an intermediary step toward the patient’s longer-range goals, such as not being a burden on the family and wanting to lead a meaningful life. More realistic and attainable pathways to these longer-range goals must be explored with the patient and offered to him or her if possible. It is also important for caregivers to address the agency element of therapeutic hope. Patients and their families are able to deal better with serious illness when they maintain a sense of control over future events and anticipate successful outcomes (Carver and Scheier, 1998Carver C.S. Scheier M.F. On the self-regulation of behavior. Cambridge University Press, New York1998Crossref Google Scholar). Therapeutic hope may be one of the ways patients engage themselves in this coping strategy. Often a patient’s interest in pursuing a stem cell therapy is the manifestation of a desire to do something. The need to maintain a sense of control over one’s own future is crucial for many patients. Without it, it is easy for patients to slip into feelings of helplessness and despair. In striving to understand the nature of therapeutic hope, we must inevitably confront the notion of spiritual distress. As the quote by George Eliot above suggests, hope and despair are interrelated. We would not be susceptible to “the painful eagerness of unfed hope” if we were not beings capable of hoping. Maintaining therapeutic hope, one might say, is a way of warding off spiritual distress. Hope is the antidote to despair. But what exactly is spiritual distress, and why is it important for our discussion of stem cell tourism? It is important to begin by drawing a distinction between spirituality and religion. Spirituality refers to a person’s search for meaning and purpose in life. Religion constitutes one of several ways individuals can engage in spirituality. Spirituality involves experiential and emotional aspects of personal connection, inner peace, and support (Anandarajah and Hight, 2001Anandarajah G. Hight E. Am. Fam. Physician. 2001; 63: 81-89PubMed Google Scholar). A person can be spiritual without being religious. For example, some people find spirituality through a connection to nature, or the arts, or through their association with a particular community. This broad conception of spirituality can help inform our understanding of spiritual distress. According to the nursing and family medicine literature, spiritual distress results when individuals are unable to find sources of meaning, comfort, and connection (Anandarajah and Hight, 2001Anandarajah G. Hight E. Am. Fam. Physician. 2001; 63: 81-89PubMed Google Scholar). Severe, chronic illness can trigger spiritual distress in many ways. For instance, illness may reduce patients’ abilities to seek ways to fulfill their spiritual needs, or it may isolate them from their normal routines, such as their ability to attend church and community gatherings (Ross, 1995Ross L. Int. J. Nurs. Stud. 1995; 32: 457-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Some patients who believe in a center of control outside themselves (i.e., God) may come to question their relationship with God because of the illness experience. Other patients may be forced to realize that they are not in total control of their lives in the event of severe illness. As one nurse put it: “Many individuals do not seriously search for the meaning and purpose of life but live as if life will go on forever… Often it is not until the crisis, illness… or suffering occurs that the illusion (of security) is shattered… Therefore, illness, suffering… and ultimately death, by their very nature, become spiritual encounters as well as physical and emotional experiences” (Ross, 1995Ross L. Int. J. Nurs. Stud. 1995; 32: 457-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Many patients with intractable medical conditions targeted by dubious stem cell clinics—and many parents of very ill children—are susceptible to spiritual distress for the reasons just cited. Spiritual distress, if left alone, can cause some individuals to seek unhealthy ways of finding meaning and connection, all in an effort to recover a sense of hope and to stave off despair. Unscrupulous purveyors of stem cell “therapies” can easily exploit this vulnerability, as is apparent in the online advertising materials used by many clinics (Petersen and Seear, 2011Petersen A. Seear K. New Genetics and Society. 2011; 30: 329-346Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). From the patient’s point of view, placing therapeutic hope in a stem cell therapy may appear to be a tempting option, for not only might the therapy ease their physical ailments, but it may also relieve their felt symptoms of spiritual distress. For example, it appears that patient networking through blogs and internet chat rooms create for some who seek stem cell treatments a strong sense of community and interpersonal connection (Murdoch and Scott, 2010Murdoch C.E. Scott C.T. Am. J. Bioeth. 2010; 10: 16-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). If one of the causes of stem cell tourism is untreated spiritual distress, then the proper response cannot be “more information.” Patients who experience spiritual distress need support, not education. It is easy to conceptualize the worry over stem cell tourism as a type of consumer/marketplace problem, where regulation and buyer information are the usual corrective tools to battle fraud and the marketing of dangerous products. But this way of framing the issue is too narrow and limiting. Patients with serious illnesses are not consumers shopping around for the latest technology. Neither are they tourists looking for good travel recommendations. Many are individuals in crisis. If we shift our perspective on stem cell tourism and view it from the humanistic standpoint of the patient’s disease experience, then we will be able to see different, additional strategies to reduce patient demand for unproven stem cell therapies. If therapeutic hope and spiritual distress are two important drivers of patient interest in stem cell tourism, then these drivers need to be addressed in ways that are appropriate to them. Luckily, because therapeutic hope and spiritual distress are related, the strategies for clinically managing them are similar. For example, in order to take the spiritual needs of patients seriously, family physicians have developed and advocated the use of “spiritual assessment guides” that clinicians can use to take an inventory of a patient’s sources of hope, comfort, strength, and connection (Anandarajah and Hight, 2001Anandarajah G. Hight E. Am. Fam. Physician. 2001; 63: 81-89PubMed Google Scholar; Maugans, 1996Maugans T.A. Arch. Fam. Med. 1996; 5: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). These assessments can be done in 10–15 min or incrementally over a period of several visits as a form of “clinical chatting.” Spiritual assessments should begin after a physician has developed a comfortable relationship with the patient. These assessments can include questions about the patient’s support systems, spiritual beliefs, coping practices, and other personal values. Some authors have developed useful mnemonics to help guide discussions into these sensitive topics and I recommend these tools highly to the reader (Anandarajah and Hight, 2001Anandarajah G. Hight E. Am. Fam. Physician. 2001; 63: 81-89PubMed Google Scholar; Maugans, 1996Maugans T.A. Arch. Fam. Med. 1996; 5: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). When a patient’s illness becomes severe, a clinician’s routine inquiry about spiritual resources can flow naturally out of discussions about the patient’s social support systems. During these conversations, patients may feel comfortable discussing their hopes and fears of the unknown. Physicians should use these opportunities to identify for patients community resources, such as hospital pastoral care services or medical social workers trained to offer psychological and social support. Physicians will not know how to manage therapeutic hope appropriately, however, if they are unfamiliar with the goals patients are striving to achieve beyond their immediate medical treatment, their perceived pathways to these other goals, and their systems of support. Taking a spiritual assessment early in the doctor/patient relationship and maintaining informal discussions about the patient’s spiritual needs (broadly defined) are important steps toward empowering patients to resist the lure of stem cell tourism. By proactively engaging with patients and learning about their fears and goals related to disease amelioration, physicians—including clinician-scientists working in the stem cell field—can gain the knowledge necessary to recommend alternative pathways to patients’ goals concerning their quality of life and their relationships with loved ones. By identifying patients’ sources of meaning, comfort, and connection, clinicians can also identify and recommend social resources that may help maintain patients’ sources of spirituality. Making these recommendations a clinical reality will not be easy. Studies show that up to 77% of patients would like spiritual issues to be considered as part of their medical care, while only 10%–20% of physicians are willing to discuss these issues (Anandarajah and Hight, 2001Anandarajah G. Hight E. Am. Fam. Physician. 2001; 63: 81-89PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, medical schools do not usually include patient management of hope and distress in their curricula (Maugans, 1996Maugans T.A. Arch. Fam. Med. 1996; 5: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). But the ability to provide humanistic care should be included among the skills, attitudes, and competencies of all physicians, since not knowing how to manage therapeutic hope and spiritual distress could lead to bad patient outcomes. Taking therapeutic hope and spiritual distress seriously will provide more comprehensive care for patients and their families, and as a consequence of this, patients may become empowered to resist the lure of stem cell tourism. Of course, little is known about what drives patients to commercial stem cell clinics, and some patients may even consciously hide their intentions from their physicians (Levine and Wolf, 2012Levine A.D. Wolf L.E. JLME. 2012; 40: 122-134Google Scholar). More empirical research is needed in this area to help inform strategies to manage therapeutic hope and spiritual distress. Nevertheless, if patients seeking commercial stem cell therapies are similar to most other seriously ill patients discussed in the medical and nursing literature, then they too should be given a chance to channel their hopes appropriately toward courses of action that are more beneficial to them. Anyone concerned about stem cell tourism should consider supporting the kind of patient care being advocated here."

https://openalex.org/W2061480191,"Proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2) is activated by various agonists in platelets. We evaluated the signaling mechanism and the functional role of Pyk2 in platelets by using pharmacological inhibitors and Pyk2-deficient platelets. We found that platelet aggregation and secretion in response to 2-methylthio-ADP (2-MeSADP) and AYPGKF were diminished in the presence of Pyk2 inhibitors or in Pyk2-deficient platelets, suggesting that Pyk2 plays a positive regulatory role in platelet functional responses. It has been shown that ADP-, but not thrombin-induced thromboxane (TxA2) generation depends on integrin signaling. Unlike ADP, thrombin activates G12/13 pathways, and G12/13 pathways can substitute for integrin signaling for TxA2 generation. We found that Pyk2 was activated downstream of both G12/13 and integrin-mediated pathways, and both 2-MeSADP- and AYPGKF-induced TxA2 generation was significantly diminished in Pyk2-deficient platelets. In addition, TxA2 generation induced by co-stimulation of Gi and Gz pathways, which is dependent on integrin signaling, was inhibited by blocking Pyk2. Furthermore, inhibition of 2-MeSADP-induced TxA2 generation by fibrinogen receptor antagonist was not rescued by co-stimulation of G12/13 pathways in the presence of Pyk2 inhibitor. We conclude that Pyk2 is a common signaling effector downstream of both G12/13 and integrin αIIbβ3 signaling, which contributes to thromboxane generation."
https://openalex.org/W2026099594,"Protein translation and degradation are critical for proper protein homeostasis, yet it remains unclear how these processes are dynamically regulated, or how they may directly balance or synergize with each other. An important translational control mechanism is the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (eEF-2) by eukaryotic elongation factor-2 kinase (EF2K), which inhibits elongation of nascent polypeptide chains during translation. We previously described a reduction of EF2K activity in PC12 cells treated with NGF or forskolin. Here, we show that both forskolin- and IGF-1-mediated reductions of EF2K activity in PC12 cells are due to decreased EF2K protein levels, and this is attenuated by application of the proteasome inhibitor, MG132. We further demonstrate that proteasome-mediated degradation of EF2K occurs in response to A2A-type adenosine receptor stimulation, and that activation of protein kinase A (PKA) or phospho-mimetic mutation of the previously characterized PKA site, Ser-499, were sufficient to induce EF2K turnover in PC12 cells. A similar EF2K degradation mechanism was observed in primary neurons and HEK cells. Expression of a dominant-negative form of Cul1 in HEK cells demonstrated that EF2K levels are regulated by an SCF-type ubiquitin E3 ligase. Specifically, EF2K binds to the F-box proteins, βTRCP1 and βTRCP2, and βTRCP regulates EF2K levels and polyubiquitylation. We propose that the proteasomal degradation of EF2K provides a mechanistic link between activity-dependent protein synthesis and degradation."

Unexpectedly, IL-27 did not inhibit HIV-1 in T cell lines, whereas IL-2 inhibited HIV-1 replication in the human T cell lymphotrophic virus (HTLV)-1-transformed T cell lines, MT-2, MT-4, SLB-1, and ATL-2. No effects were seen in HTLV-1-negative cell lines. Utilizing MT-2 cells, we demonstrated that IL-2 treatment inhibited HIV-1 syncytia-inducing ability and dose-dependently decreased supernatant p24 antigen levels by >90%. Using real time PCR and Western blot analysis, we observed that IL-2 treatment induced the host restriction factor, APOBEC3G with accumulation into the lower molecular mass active form as characterized by FPLC. Further analysis revealed that the virus recovered from IL-2-treated MT-2 cells had impaired replication competency. This was found to be due to incorporation of APOBEC3G into the virion despite the presence of Vif. These findings demonstrate a novel role for IL-2 in regulating production of infectious HIV-1 virions in HTLV-1-infected cells through the induction of APOBEC3G.Background: Some cytokines exhibit dichotomous effects on HIV replication in different cell types.Results: IL-2 inhibits HIV-1 replication in MT-2 cells via intracellular induction and virion incorporation of the host restriction factor, APOBEC3G.Conclusion: Stimulation of MT-2 cell with IL-2 produces viruses with impaired replication competency.Significance: This new insight could open the door to additional host-based strategies to suppress HIV-1 replication.

In this regard, IL-2 has been shown to be capable of suppressing HIV-1 replication through the enhancement of CD8+ T cell function and enhancing HIV-1 replication in primary cultures of CD4+ T cells (19Chun T.W. Engel D. Mizell S.B. Ehler L.A. Fauci A.S. Induction of HIV-1 replication in latently infected CD4+ T cells using a combination of cytokines.J. Exp.

However, IL-2 effects on viral replication in other cell lines are poorly understood and highly variable. APOBEC3 (A3) proteins have been reported as potent host-antiviral restriction factors that encode DNA-editing deaminase enzymes. Of the seven A3 genes (A3A, A3B, A3C, A3D/E, A3F, A3G, and A3H) encoded by human genome, A3G and A3F are the most studied (22Malim M.H. APOBEC proteins and intrinsic resistance to HIV-1 infection.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2009; 364: 675-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). A3G has been shown to be packaged into virions in Vif-deleted HIV. It confers resistance to retroviral infection through the deamination of deoxycytidines to deoxyuridines during reverse transcription. This enzymatic activity results in G to A hypermutation of the plus strand DNA with production of incompetent viruses (6Mangeat B. Turelli P. Caron G. Friedli M. Perrin L. Trono D.

In addition to the enzymatic editing of HIV reverse transcripts, nonenzymatic mechanisms for A3G activity have also been suggested (23Bishop K.N. Holmes R.K. Malim M.H.

In those studies, using primary CD4 T cells, IL-2 was supplemented in the culture medium to maintain T cell proliferation. Our lab also recently found that IL-27 induces potent antiviral microRNAs (34Swaminathan S. Hu X. Zheng X. Kriga Y. Shetty J. Zhao Y. Stephens R. Tran B. Baseler M.W. Yang J. Lempicki R.A. Huang D.

Commun. 2013; 434: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), thus suggesting that IL-27 could be a potential therapeutic cytokine for viral infection. The present study initially sought to extend the IL-27-mediated anti-HIV effect by looking at other cell types including the HTLV-1 2The abbreviations used are: HTLV, human T cell lymphotrophic virus; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell; LMM, lower molecular mass. transformed cell line, MT-2. Unexpectedly, we found that IL-2 alone had a profound suppressive effect on HIV-1 replication in this system. The study was then modified to understand this observation by examining the relationships between IL-2 and host factors known to be involved in the regulation of HIV-1 infection. Here, we demonstrate that IL-2 inhibits HIV-1 replication in certain HTLV-1-infected cell lines by enhancing A3G expression and facilitating its incorporation into the virion of a Vif-positive virus. This new insight could open the door to additional host-based strategies to suppress HIV replication. The MT-2 (35Haertle T. Carrera C.J. Wasson D.B. Sowers L.C. Richman D.D. Carson D.A.

Briefly, fragments from SphI and EcoRI digestions of pNL4.3 were subcloned into the corresponding enzyme sites in pALTER (Promega, Madison, WI). A resulting plasmid, pALTER.NL, was used as the shuttle vector. A stop codon was induced in the vif gene in pALTER.NL using sense (5′-GCTAAGGACTGGTTTTAAAGACATCACTATGAAAG-3′) and a corresponding antisense primer with the QuikChange site mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA.), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The presence of the intended mutation without unexpected second site mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing, using ABI Prism genetic analyzer 3130x (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The intended clone (pALTERNL.dVif) was digested with SphI and EcoRI, and the fragment was used to replace the corresponding fragment of pNL4.3. DNA sequencing was used to ascertain the presence of the stop codon in the vif gene of pNL4.3delVif (p487) or pDelVif. All plasmid DNAs were purified using an Endofree Plasmid Maxi kit (Qiagen). MT-2 cells were transiently transfected with pLTR-Luc (with or without pTax) using TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus Bio, Madison, WI). Briefly, DNA and the lipid reagent were diluted in serum-free RPM1 and mixed together at a ratio of 1 μg of DNA to 12 μl of lipid. The DNA-lipid complex was incubated at room temperature for at least 20 min and added dropwise to MT-2 cells at a ratio of 1 μg of DNA to 1 × 106 cells.

Luciferase activity was normalized using total cellular protein measured with BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Western blotting was performed as previously described (43Oguariri R.M. Brann T.W. Imamichi T. Hydroxyurea and interleukin-6 synergistically reactivate HIV-1 replication in a latently infected promonocytic cell line via SP1/SP3 transcription factors.J. Biol.

Briefly, HIV-infected MT-2 cells were cultured in the presence or absence of IL-2 (20 units/ml) for 2, 4, or 7 days at 37 °C. Total cell lysates were obtained using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktails (Sigma-Aldrich) and phosphatase inhibitors (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Total protein was measured with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). An anti-β-actin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) served as an internal control (43Oguariri R.M. Brann T.W. Imamichi T. Hydroxyurea and interleukin-6 synergistically reactivate HIV-1 replication in a latently infected promonocytic cell line via SP1/SP3 transcription factors.J. Biol.

Fold changes were quantitated using the image processing and analysis in Java software (ImageJ software). For Western blotting using HIV virions, HIV-1-infected MT-2 cells were cultured for 4 days at 37 °C in the presence or absence of IL-2. The culture supernatants were filtered through a 0.22-μm filter, followed by ultracentrifugation, using the SW41 swing rotor at 10,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Pelleted virions were washed with PBS and then lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and the p24 amount was quantitated by a p24 capture antigen ELISA. A total of 2 ng of p24 was used for each Western blot analysis. The membranes were probed with patient plasma, anti-p24 monoclonal antibody (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), anti-APOBEC3G antibody, or anti-Vif monoclonal antibody (Abcam). MT-2 cells were infected with DNase I-treated HIVNL4.3 virus for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 1 μm azidothymidine. The cells were washed and cultured for 1, 2, 4, or 7 days in the presence or absence of IL-2 and/or azidothymidine. HIV binding assays and proviral DNA copy numbers were determined by real time PCR. In the HIV binding assay, MT-2 cells were pretreated with or without 20 units/ml of IL-2 for 4 days, and the cells were incubated with DNase-treated HIV-1 at 4 °C for 2 h, followed by washing with ice-cold PBS. HIV-1 infection or binding was evaluated by measuring the products of viral cDNA synthesis at 24 and 48 h postinfection, as described previously (45Sharova N. Wu Y. Zhu X. Stranska R. Kaushik R. Sharkey M. Stevenson M. Primate lentiviral Vpx commandeers DDB1 to counteract a macrophage restriction.PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000057Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Copy numbers were normalized to total cell numbers determined by real time PCR using CCR5-specific primers (11Fakruddin J.M. Lempicki R.A. Gorelick R.J. Yang J. Adelsberger J.W. Garcia-Pineres A.J.

Absolute numbers of copies of proviral DNA copy were determined at days 1, 2, 4, and 7 postinfection. To obtain absolute proviral DNA copy numbers, a standard curve was generated using serial dilutions of a plasmid encoding HIV gag region (pHIVgag) and RNaseP gene (pRNaseP) as described (47McN"

https://openalex.org/W1988889332,"Elastase from Aspergillus sp. is an important factor for aspergillosis. AFUEI is an inhibitor of the elastase derived from Aspergillus fumigatus. AFUEI is a member of the I78 inhibitor family and has a high inhibitory activity against elastases of Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus flavus, human neutrophil elastase and bovine chymotrypsin, but does not inhibit bovine trypsin. Here we report the crystal structure of AFUEI in two crystal forms. AFUEI is a wedge-shaped protein composed of an extended loop and a scaffold protein core. The structure of AFUEI shows remarkable similarity to serine protease inhibitors of the potato inhibitor I family, although they are classified into different inhibitor families. A structural comparison with the potato I family inhibitors suggests that the extended loop of AFUEI corresponds to the binding loop of the potato inhibitor I family, and AFUEI inhibits its cognate proteases through the same mechanism as the potato I family inhibitors."

We identified, biosynthesized, purified, and characterized lens epithelium-derived growth factor fragment (LEDGF1-326) as a novel protein therapeutic. LEDGF1-326 was produced at about 20 mg/liter of culture when expressed in the Escherichia coli system, with about 95% purity and aggregate-free homogeneous population with a mean hydrodynamic diameter of 9 ± 1 nm. The free energy of unfolding of LEDGF1-326 was 3.3 ± 0.5 kcal mol(-1), and melting temperature was 44.8 ± 0.2 °C. LEDGF1-326 increased human retinal pigment epithelial cell viability from 48.3 ± 5.6 to 119.3 ± 21.1% in the presence of P23H mutant rhodopsin-mediated aggregation stress. LEDGF1-326 also increased retinal pigment epithelial cell FluoSphere uptake to 140 ± 10%. Eight weeks after single intravitreal injection in Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rats, LEDGF1-326 increased the b-wave amplitude significantly from 9.4 ± 4.6 to 57.6 ± 8.8 μV for scotopic electroretinogram and from 10.9 ± 5.6 to 45.8 ± 15.2 μV for photopic electroretinogram. LEDGF1-326 significantly increased the retinal outer nuclear layer thickness from 6.34 ± 1.6 to 11.7 ± 0.7 μm. LEDGF1-326 is a potential new therapeutic agent for treating retinal degenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1976972843,"Gravity is responsible for the long-range order of the universe. Using Einstein's general relativity, we now think of gravity as the geometrical curvature of the four-dimensional fabric of space-time (1). Extreme cosmological events such as the merging of neutron stars or black holes induce ripples in the fabric of space-time (see the figure). However, these ripples, or gravitational waves, are extremely weak, and their detection has remained elusive. To measure the small signal, an interferometric detector is required that can detect strain to one part in 1021 (that is, a billionth of a nanometer for a kilometer-length interferometer). Such extreme gravity events are also rare, occurring only once every 10,000 years per galaxy (2). An advanced version of such a detector is designed to find gravitational waves on a regular basis (roughly tens of events annually) beginning in 2017 (3). This heroic experiment alone will be somewhat unsatisfying—gravitational wave interferometers will only be able to hear the wave and detect when something happens (literally “hear” as the operational frequency of tens to thousands of Hertz overlaps with the human auditory range). The interferometers will be blind to exactly where the merger occurs. To locate the source of the gravitational waves, collaboration between the physics and the astronomy communities together with extensive simulations are under way (4)."
