https://openalex.org/W2138910750,"We sequenced approximately 400,000 small RNAs from Caenorhabditis elegans. Another 18 microRNA (miRNA) genes were identified, thereby extending to 112 our tally of confidently identified miRNA genes in C. elegans. Also observed were thousands of endogenous siRNAs generated by RNA-directed RNA polymerases acting preferentially on transcripts associated with spermatogenesis and transposons. In addition, a third class of nematode small RNAs, called 21U-RNAs, was discovered. 21U-RNAs are precisely 21 nucleotides long, begin with a uridine 5'-monophosphate but are diverse in their remaining 20 nucleotides, and appear modified at their 3'-terminal ribose. 21U-RNAs originate from more than 5700 genomic loci dispersed in two broad regions of chromosome IV-primarily between protein-coding genes or within their introns. These loci share a large upstream motif that enables accurate prediction of additional 21U-RNAs. The motif is conserved in other nematodes, presumably because of its importance for producing these diverse, autonomously expressed, small RNAs (dasRNAs)."

The data support a role for COPI vesicles in recycling and cisternal maturation, showing that Golgi-resident proteins are present at a higher concentration than secretory cargo. Of the 1400 proteins, 345 were identified as previously uncharacterized. Of these, 230 had their subcellular location deduced by proteomics. This study provides a comprehensive catalog of the ER and Golgi proteomes with insight into their identity and function."
https://openalex.org/W2051655214,"The mechanisms controlling the transition from neurogenesis to gliogenesis in the vertebrate CNS are incompletely understood. We identified a family of transcription factors, called NFI genes, which are induced throughout the spinal cord ventricular zone (VZ) concomitantly with the induction of GLAST, an early marker of gliogenesis. NFIA is both necessary and sufficient for GLAST induction in the VZ. Unexpectedly, NFIA is also essential for the continued inhibition of neurogenesis in VZ progenitors. This function is mediated by the requirement of NFIA for the expression of HES5, a Notch effector. However, Notch effectors are unable to promote glial-fate specification in the absence of NFIA. Thus, NFIA links the abrogation of neurogenesis to a generic program of gliogenesis, in both astrocyte and oligodendrocyte VZ progenitors. At later stages, NFIA promotes migration and differentiation of astrocyte precursors, a function that is antagonized in oligodendrocyte precursors by Olig2."

The PP2A holoenzyme consists of a heterodimeric core enzyme, which comprises a scaffolding subunit and a catalytic subunit, and a variable regulatory subunit. Here we report the crystal structure of the heterotrimeric PP2A holoenzyme involving the regulatory subunit B′/B56/PR61. Surprisingly, the B′/PR61 subunit has a HEAT-like (huntingtin-elongation-A subunit-TOR-like) repeat structure, similar to that of the scaffolding subunit. The regulatory B′/B56/PR61 subunit simultaneously interacts with the catalytic subunit as well as the conserved ridge of the scaffolding subunit. The carboxyterminus of the catalytic subunit recognizes a surface groove at the interface between the B′/B56/PR61 subunit and the scaffolding subunit. Compared to the scaffolding subunit in the PP2A core enzyme, formation of the holoenzyme forces the scaffolding subunit to undergo pronounced conformational rearrangements. This structure reveals significant ramifications for understanding the function and regulation of PP2A. Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) plays an essential role in many aspects of cellular physiology.

This structure reveals significant ramifications for understanding the function and regulation of PP2A. Controlled protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are a fundamental regulatory mechanism in all aspects of biology (Hunter, 1995Hunter T. Protein kinases and phosphatases: the yin and yang of protein phosphorylation and signaling.Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2510) Google Scholar). Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a major serine/threonine phosphatase involved in many essential aspects of cellular function (Janssens and Goris, 2001Janssens V. Goris J.

Protein phosphatase 2A: a panoply of enzymes.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). PP2A plays an important role in cell-cycle regulation, cell-growth control, development, regulation of multiple signal transduction pathways, cytoskeleton dynamics, and cell mobility. The PP2A core enzyme consists of a 65 kDa scaffolding protein known as A or PR65 subunit and a 36 kDa catalytic subunit or C subunit. To gain full activity towards specific substrates, the PP2A core enzyme associates with a variable regulatory subunit to form a heterotrimeric holoenzyme. The variable regulatory subunits have four subfamilies: B (PR55), B′ (B56 or PR61), B″ (PR72), and B″′ (PR93/PR110), with at least 16 members in these subfamilies (Janssens and Goris, 2001Janssens V.

In mammalian cells, the scaffolding and the catalytic subunits each have two isoforms, which share high sequence similarity (Arino et al., 1988Arino J. Woon C.W. Brautigan D.L. Miller Jr., T.B.

In contrast, the sequence similarity among the four subfamilies of regulatory subunits is very low, and the expression levels of various regulatory subunits are highly diverse depending upon cell types and tissues (Janssens and Goris, 2001Janssens V.

Protein phosphatase 2A: variety of forms and diversity of functions.Acta Biochim. Pol. 2001; 48: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In this regard, the B subunits determine the substrate specificity as well as the spatial and temporal functions of PP2A. PP2A is also an important tumor suppressor protein (Janssens et al., 2005Janssens V. Goris J. Van Hoof C. PP2A: the expected tumor suppressor.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2005; 15: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Mutations in the scaffolding subunit that result in compromised binding to the regulatory or catalytic subunit of PP2A, or a total absence or substantial reduction of the scaffolding subunit, had been reported to be linked to a variety of primary human tumors (Calin et al., 2000Calin G.A. di Iasio M.G.

The PP2A scaffolding subunit contains 15 tandem repeats of a conserved 39-residue sequence known as a HEAT (huntingtin-elongation-A subunit-TOR) motif (Hemmings et al., 1990Hemmings B.A. Adams-Pearson C.

The catalytic subunit recognizes one end of the elongated scaffolding subunit by interacting with the conserved ridges of HEAT repeats 11–15 (Ruediger et al., 1992Ruediger R. Roeckel D. Fait J.

Despite recent advances, mechanistic understanding on the function and assembly of the PP2A holoenzyme has been slow to emerge. There is no structural information on any of the regulatory subunits, and it remains unclear how the regulatory subunit specifically recognizes the scaffolding subunit or the catalytic subunit. Methylation of the carboxyterminus of the catalytic subunit is thought to play an important role in the formation of a holoenzyme (Bryant et al., 1999Bryant J.C. Westphal R.S. Wadzinski B.E.

In this manuscript, we report the crystal structure of a PP2A holoenzyme, involving the α isoform of the scaffolding subunit (Aα), the α isoform of the catalytic subunit (Cα), and the γ1 isoform of the regulatory B′/B56/PR61 subunit (B′-γ1). This crystal structure reveals a number of unexpected findings that have significant biological implications for understanding the mechanisms and cellular functions of PP2A. The PP2A core enzyme, involving the full-length Aα and Cα, was assembled as described (Xing et al., 2006Xing Y. Xu Y. Chen Y. Jeffrey P.D. Chao Y. Zheng L. Li Z. Strack S. Stock J.B. Shi Y. Structure of Protein Phosphatase 2A Core Enzyme Bound to Tumor-inducing Toxins.Cell. 2006; 127: 341-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The PP2A core enzyme was methylated by a PP2A-specific leucine carboxyl methyltransferase (LCMT) in the presence of S-adenosyl methionine (SAM). The fully methylated PP2A core enzyme was incubated with a stoichiometric amount of the full-length B′-γ1. The heterotrimeric PP2A holoenzyme was purified to homogeneity by gel-filtration chromatography. The PP2A holoenzyme was incubated with 1.2 molar equivalence of microcystin-LR (MCLR) prior to crystallization. We succeeded in obtaining small crystals of the PP2A holoenzyme and were able to generate large, diffraction-quality crystals using macroseeding. These crystals were sensitive to radiation damage and diffracted X-rays to about 3.3 Å resolution at synchrotron. The structure was determined by a combination of molecular replacement and single-wavelength anomalous dispersion. The atomic model of the native holoenzyme has been refined to 3.3 Å resolution (Table 1).Table 1Statistics from Crystallographic AnalysisHoloenzymeNativeSeMet (Aα & Cα)SeMet (Aα & Cα)Protein componentsAα, B′-γ1, CαAα, B′-γ3, Cα(T)Aα, B′-γ1, Cα(T)Space groupP212121P212121P212121Resolution (outer shell) (Å)100–3.3 (3.42–3.30)100–3.6 (3.73–3.60)100–3.8 (3.94–3.80)Total observations443,360912,830261,894Unique observations70,28953,99245,951Data coverage (outer shell)99.9% (99.9%)99.9% (100.0%)99.7% (99.9%)Rsym (outer shell)0.104 (0.444)0.116 (0.446)0.109 (0.432)RefinementResolution (outer shell) (Å)100–3.3 (3.42–3.30)100–3.6 (3.73–3.60)100–3.8 (3.94–3.80)Number of reflections (|F| > 0)70,19953,47246,983Data coverage98.4%97.4%99.6%Rwork (outer shell)0.252 (0.392)0.267 (0.364)0.282 (0.332)Rfree (outer shell)0.297 (0.434)0.331 (0.439)0.335 (0.418)Total number of atoms20,47420,21220,212Number of waters000Rmsd bond length (Å)0.00830.0100.011Rmsd bond angles (degree)1.381.531.56Average B factorAα—two copies per a.u.69.6, 60.170.3, 48.181.3, 67.3Cα -—two copies per a.u.72.7, 70.169.2, 59.580.3, 76.4B′-γ—two copies per a.u.85.8, 79.184.3, 70.595.2, 86.3Ramachandran PlotMost favored (%)80.675.373.2Additionally allowed (%)17.622.523.8Generously allowed (%)1.42.02.5Disallowed (%)0.30.30.4Rsym = ∑h∑i | Ih,i − Ih | / ∑h∑i Ih,i, where Ih is the mean intensity of the i observations of symmetry-related reflections of h.

The structure of the PP2A holoenzyme exhibits a compact architecture, measuring 90 × 90 × 70 Å3 (Figure 1). Aα has an extensive, C-shaped structure characterized by double-layered α helices. Compared to the free form (Groves et al., 1999Groves M.R. Hanlon N. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. Barford D.

Xu Y. Chen Y. Jeffrey P.D. Chao Y. Zheng L. Li Z. Strack S. Stock J.B. Shi Y.

There are 15 HEAT repeats in Aα, with each HEAT repeat comprising a pair of antiparallel α helices. The interhelical region within each HEAT repeat forms a contiguous ridge—hereafter referred to as the ridge. As previously shown (Xing et al., 2006Xing Y. Xu Y. Chen Y. Jeffrey P.D. Chao Y. Zheng L. Li Z. Strack S. Stock J.B. Shi Y. Structure of Protein Phosphatase 2A Core Enzyme Bound to Tumor-inducing Toxins.Cell. 2006; 127: 341-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), Cα binds to one end of the scaffold through interactions with the ridge of HEAT repeats 11–15 (Figure 1), consistent with an earlier prediction (Ruediger et al., 1992Ruediger R. Roeckel D. Fait J. Bergqvist A. Magnusson G. Walter G. Identification of binding sites on the regulatory A subunit of protein phosphatase 2A for the catalytic C subunit and for tumor antigens of simian virus 40 and polyomavirus.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4872-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Interactions between Aα and Cα result in the burial of 2072 Å2 exposed surface area. The regulatory B′/PR61-γ1 subunit has an elongated, superhelical structure comprising 18 α helices (Figure 1A). The superhelical structure has an apparent curvature, with the convex side binding to Aα and the concave side facing up and tilted towards Cα. Strikingly, despite a complete lack of sequence homology, the structure of B′-γ1 closely resembles that of Aα. There are eight HEAT-like repeat motifs in B′-γ1. B′-γ1 makes extensive interactions with both Aα and Cα (Figure 1). On one hand, B′-γ1 binds to the conserved ridge of HEAT repeats 2–8 in Aα. On the other hand, B′-γ1 makes direct interactions with three surface areas of Cα, including helix α5 and the carboxyterminus. A total surface area of 4300 Å2 is buried as a result of interaction between the regulatory B′-γ1 subunit and the PP2A core enzyme. Approximately 55% of the buried surface area is due to interactions between B′-γ1 and Cα, with the rest coming from interactions between B′-γ1 and Aα. Interestingly, the carboxyterminus of Cα recognizes a surface groove at the interface between B′-γ1 and Aα (Figure 1B). The regulatory B′/PR61-γ1 subunit consists exclusively of α helices (Figure 2, Figure 3). Eighteen α helices stack against each other laterally to create an elongated, superhelical structure. The concave side of the curved superhelical structure is enriched with negatively charged amino acids, whereas the convex side contains a number of conserved hydrophobic residues (Figure 2A). These hydrophobic amino acids make important contributions in binding to the scaffolding subunit Aα. One unanticipated finding from the structural investigation is that the structure of B′-γ1 resembles that of Aα. Systematic structure-based search of the Protein Data Bank using the DALI server (Holm and Sander, 1993Holm L. Sander C. Protein structure comparison by alignment of distance matrices.J. Mol.

Intriguingly, both karyopherin α and β-catenin have the ability to interact with peptides using a concave surface (Conti et al., 1998Conti E. Uy M. Leighton L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J.

This analysis suggests the possibility that the regulatory B′/PR61 subunit may interact with PP2A substrates or other regulatory proteins using the acidic, concave surface (Figure 2B). Structure of B′-γ1 can be superimposed with that of Aα with a root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) of 5.1 Å over 254 aligned backbone alpha carbon atoms. This alignment identified 8 HEAT-like repeats in B′-γ1. Unlike the HEAT repeats in Aα or the armadillo motifs in β-catenin, these HEAT-like motifs exhibit little sequence homology and appear to lack a strong consensus sequence (Figure 3). Nonetheless, these motifs can be superimposed with each other with 0.9–2.5 Å pairwise rmsd (Figures 2C and 3). HEAT-like motif 7 of B′-γ1 is most homologous to the HEAT repeat of Aα. For the ease of discussion, the HEAT-like motifs of B′-γ1 are hereafter referred to as HEAT repeats. The interface between the catalytic subunit and the regulatory B′/PR61 subunit is extensive and consists of two major areas (Figure 4A). In one area, amino acids from HEAT repeats 6–8 of B′-γ1 interact with residues in the α5 region of Cα, mainly through hydrogen bonds (Figure 4B). At the center of this interface, the polar side chain of Gln125 in Cα makes a pair of hydrogen bonds to the main chain atoms in B′-γ1. The aliphatic portion of Gln125 side chain also mediates van der Waals contact with His339, Phe340, and Trp382 in B′-γ1. These interactions are further buttressed by three hydrogen bonds between the side chain of Asp131 in Cα and the amide nitrogen and side chain of Ser298 in B′-γ1 (Figure 4B). In the other area, the hydrophobic carboxyl terminus of Cα is nestled in a surface groove at the interface between Aα and B′-γ1 (Figure 4C). There are numerous van der Waals contacts at this interface. Three residues from Cα, Pro305, Tyr307, and Phe308, stack closely against each other and are surrounded by the aliphatic portion of the side chains of Lys256, Lys 258, Tyr292, and Lys295 in B′-γ1 and Asp63, Glu64, and Glu101 of Aα (Figure 4C). These van der Waals interactions are strengthened by six additional hydrogen bonds, one of which occurs between the side chain of Glu64 in Aα and the main chain amide nitrogen of residue 309 in Cα (Figure 4C). Importantly, mutation of Glu64 to Asp or Gly in Aα has been observed in cancer cells (Ruediger et al., 2001bRuediger R. Pham H.T. Walter G. Disruption of protein phosphatase 2A subunit interaction in human cancers with mutations in the A alpha subunit gene.Oncogene. 2001; 20: 10-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Supporting an important role for Glu64, the mutant proteins E64D and E64G exhibited significantly compromised ability to interact with the B′/PR61 subunit (Ruediger et al., 2001bRuediger R. Pham H.T. Walter G. Disruption of protein phosphatase 2A subunit interaction in human cancers with mutations in the A alpha subunit gene.Oncogene. 2001; 20: 10-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Our structural observation provides a rational basis for the mutagenesis result and for the cancer link. Although the carboxylate of Leu309 is fully methylated as judged by Western blot, we chose not to build the methyl group, because the electron density for the methyl group is weak. Nonetheless, the binding groove for the carboxyl terminus of Cα is very acidic (Figure 4A); methylation of the carboxyl terminus of Cα removes a negative charge and presumably facilitates its docking into the acidic groove. In addition to the two major interfaces, the extended loop within HEAT repeat 2 of B′-γ1 makes additional interactions with Cα. Arg268 of Cα, which mediates van der Waals contacts with MCLR, donates three hydrogen bonds to residues in B′-γ1: two to the main chain carbonyl oxygen atoms of residues 119 and 122 and one to the side chain of Asp123 (Figure 4D). B′-γ1 uses its convex surface to sit on the ridge of HEAT repeats 2–8 in Aα (Figure 4E). Although the buried surface area is large, the intensity of interaction does not appear to be high. The interface between B′-γ1 and Aα is scattered into a large area and a small area. The large area involves HEAT repeats 4 and 5 of B′-γ1 and the ridge of HEAT repeats 2–5 of Aα (Figure 4F). Trp140 and Phe141 of Aα make multiple van der Waals interactions with hydrophobic residues in B′-γ1. In addition, Arg183 of Aα donates a pair of charge-stabilized hydrogen bonds to Glu214 of B′-γ1 (Figure 4F). Lys256 of B′-γ1 forms a salt bridge with three acidic residues in Aα, Asp63, Glu100, and Glu101 (Figure 4F). The small area involves the extended loop in HEAT repeat 2 of B′-γ1 and the ridge of HEAT repeats 7 and 8, where Trp257 of Aα hydrogen bonds to main chain carbonyl oxygen of residue 107 in B′-γ1 (Figure 4F). All residues in B′-γ1 that mediate important contacts with residues in Cα and Aα are highly conserved. For example, Glu214, which accepts two hydrogen bonds from Arg183 of Aα (Figure 4F), and Asp123, which hydrogen bonds to Arg268 of Cα (Figure 4D), are invariant in all B′/PR61 family members across species (Figure 3). The other three B′-γ1 residues that contribute to hydrogen bonds at the interfaces, Lys295, Ser298, and His339, are conserved in all but one B′/PR61 family members (Figure 3). This analysis indicates that the binding interactions reported in this study are likely conserved in holoenzymes involving other B′/PR61 isoforms. PP2A is a tumor suppressor protein.

An alternative hypothesis is that movement variability arises before movements begin, during motor preparation. We examined this possibility directly by recording the preparatory activity of single cortical neurons during a highly practiced reach task. Small variations in preparatory neural activity were predictive of small variations in the upcoming reach. Effect magnitudes were such that at least half of the observed movement variability likely had its source during motor preparation. Thus, even for a highly practiced task, the ability to repeatedly plan the same movement limits our ability to repeatedly execute the same movement.

Thus, even for a highly practiced task, the ability to repeatedly plan the same movement limits our ability to repeatedly execute the same movement. In 1990, Larry Bird of America's Boston Celtics basketball team made 71 consecutive free throws, or foul shots, across almost two month's worth of games. While this is a remarkable feat, one cannot help but wonder: why did he miss the 72nd? Why could he not simply do what he had done the last 71 times? As humans, we take for granted that our behavior is variable, and that repeated attempts will have variable results, but what is the source of this variability? When we err, we often assume that something went wrong during the movement. But might variability also arise during motor preparation, well before the first muscle contracts? Answering such questions is critical to the study of motor control. Not only is variability a part of the behavior that must be explained, but hypotheses regarding motor-control strategies are fundamentally linked to hypotheses regarding the noise those strategies combat. Furthermore, different hypotheses can make similar predictions regarding mean behavior, such that deciding between candidate models requires examining movement variability (Kawato, 2004Kawato, M. (2004). Movement variability: a touchstone for competing computational theories.

Due to their elegance and explanatory power, these models have been very influential. Though they differ in some important ways, all assume that movement variability is generated “online,” during movement. Typically, it is assumed that the relevant noise stems from the periphery, especially at the neuromuscular junction. Recent studies (Hamilton et al., 2004Hamilton A. Jones K.E. Wolpert D.M.

Yet there is little direct evidence that online noise is the main source of variability or the principal limit on accuracy. Indeed, some recent observations support the opposite conclusion.

Haggard P. Wolpert D.M. The role of execution noise in movement variability.J. Neurophysiol. 2004; 91: 1050-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar found that variability in reach velocity was not accounted for by standard online noise models. This led them to propose more elaborate forms of online noise, but a more straightforward explanation is that considerable variability arises during motor preparation. Variability in motor preparation (and/or related sensorimotor transformations) has been previously considered important (Gordon et al., 1994Gordon J. Ghilardi M.F. Ghez C. Accuracy of planar reaching movements. I. Independence of direction and extent variability.Exp. Brain Res. 1994; 99: 97-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), particularly when a target must be remembered (McIntyre et al., 1997McIntyre J. Stratta F. Lacquaniti F.

Errors in pointing are due to approximations in sensorimotor transformations.J. Neurophysiol. 1989; 62: 595-608PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been recently argued that preparatory variability makes a negligible contribution to straightforward tasks using visible targets (van Beers et al., 2004van Beers R.J. Haggard P. Wolpert D.M. The role of execution noise in movement variability.J. Neurophysiol. 2004; 91: 1050-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The current study seeks to address this question: for a straightforward and well-practiced task, does motor preparation make a sizeable contribution to the observed behavioral variability? Comparisons of behavior with model predictions must contend with interpretational difficulties. Thus, we chose to address the issue directly by recording from neurons in dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) and primary motor cortex (M1) as monkeys performed a delayed-reach task. We compared trial-by-trial fluctuations in delay-period “preparatory” activity (well before reach onset) with trial-by-trial fluctuations in the subsequent reach velocity. We chose this comparison because (1) velocity variability is a ubiquitous feature of reaching, and (2) most delay-active neurons in PMd/M1 are strongly modulated by instructed-speed (Churchland et al., 2006aChurchland M.M. Santhanam G. Shenoy K.V. Preparatory activity in premotor and motor cortex reflects the speed of the upcoming reach.J. Neurophysiol. 2006; 96 (Published online July 19, 2006): 3130-3146https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.00307.2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, Cisek, 2006Cisek P. Preparing for speed. Focus on: “Preparatory activity in premotor and motor cortex reflects the speed of the upcoming reach”.J. Neurophysiol. 2006; 96 (Published online August 23, 2006): 2842-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). That modulation suggests that preparatory activity might also relate to the natural fluctuations in velocity. Of course, this is not guaranteed: trial-by-trial preparatory variability might be minimal, and contribute only a small proportion of the eventual behavioral variability. But we did in fact find that velocity variability was predicted by variability in the preceding delay-period activity. The sign and steepness of the relationship scaled, on average, with the sign and intensity of the tuning for instructed-speed. From the strength of this scaling, we estimate that at least half the observed movement variability had its source in movement preparation rather than in online noise. Thus, variability in motor preparation is a major source of movement variability, even for a well-practiced and straightforward task. Two rhesus monkeys performed a delayed-reach task (Figure 1A). Figure 1B illustrates the flow of a single trial: a delay period separates target appearance from the go cue, after which a reach is made. Monkeys were trained to reach at different speeds (“instructed-fast” or “instructed-slow”) depending on target color (red or green, respectively). Figure 1C plots hand velocity and position for reaches to a rightwards target (12 cm distance, ∼15 reaches/instructed-speed). As desired, peak velocities were higher for red targets, and lower (though still fairly rapid) for green targets. Figure 1D plots the peak velocity for all reaches to that target location for that day. Lines give the criteria for success. Performance was generally excellent, particularly as the two instructed-speeds were randomly interleaved (humans typically require training to achieve similar performance). Nevertheless, there was still measurable variability in peak velocity within each category. Such variability is a normal, presumably endemic feature of reaching. It has been explicitly noted previously (e.g., Messier and Kalaska, 1999Messier J. Kalaska J.F. Comparison of variability of initial kinematics and endpoints of reaching movements.Exp. Brain Res. 1999; 125: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, van Beers et al., 2004van Beers R.J. Haggard P. Wolpert D.M. The role of execution noise in movement variability.J. Neurophysiol. 2004; 91: 1050-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) and is also reflected in the universally observed variability of movement duration (e.g., Crammond and Kalaska, 2000Crammond D.J. Kalaska J.F. Prior information in motor and premotor cortex: activity during the delay period and effect on pre-movement activity.J.

Brain Res. 1991; 83: 285-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Similar levels of velocity variability are seen in motivated human subjects. The central question of this study is whether this velocity variability can be predicted by preparatory neural activity recorded during the delay period, well before movement initiation. We recorded, from PMd and M1, the responses of 136 neurons with tuned delay-period activity. We concentrate exclusively on the response during the delay period, which is known to relate to target direction and distance (Godschalk et al., 1985Godschalk M. Lemon R.N.

A neurophysiological study of the premotor cortex in the rhesus monkey.Brain. 1984; 107: 385-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Delay-period activity also depends upon the instructed-speed (Churchland et al., 2006aChurchland M.M. Santhanam G. Shenoy K.V. Preparatory activity in premotor and motor cortex reflects the speed of the upcoming reach.J. Neurophysiol. 2006; 96 (Published online July 19, 2006): 3130-3146https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.00307.2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Figure 2A shows example responses from an “instructed-fast preferring” neuron, tested at five target distances in its preferred direction. This neuron responds during the delay period and ceases to respond around movement onset. Delay-period activity is higher for instructed-fast reaches than for instructed-slow reaches (red versus green traces, respectively). The central question is whether, for trials of a given instructed-speed, higher peak velocities are preceded by higher delay-period firing rates. To illustrate the exploration of this issue, Figure 2B plots the occurrence of action potentials for 22 instructed-fast trials, all employing the 6 cm distant target. Reach velocity (black traces) is plotted on top of the mean reach velocity across all trials (gray traces). For presentation, trials are ordered from the fastest to the slowest. If velocity variability results entirely from online noise (e.g., in the muscles) then it should not correlate with the spike rate during the preceding delay-period. However, if velocity variability is partly due to preparatory variability, then such a correlation should exist. By visual inspection alone, it is difficult to determine whether a correlation exists. The natural variability in peak velocity is small and the spiking of the neuron is, like that of most cortical neurons, irregular even within a trial. We discuss below how these features impact our analyses and how statistical power can be improved by the appropriate pooling of data. Figure 3A illustrates the range of possible effects. Each dot corresponds to one hypothetical trial and plots the delay-period neural response versus peak velocity for instructed-slow (green) and -fast (red) trials. If the neural response can be measured exactly, and if it precisely indicates the “planned” reach speed, then expectations are clear (top panels). Presuming movement variability is not due to preparatory variability (left panel), there should be no preparatory variability, and thus no trial-by-trial correlation. Alternately, if movement variability is entirely due to preparatory variability (right panel), there should be a perfect correlation. Furthermore, the slope of a linear regression (black lines) should match the predicted slope, i.e. the gray line with slope(R¯instructed−fast−R¯instructed−slow)(V¯instructed−fast−V¯instructed−slow)(1) where R¯ and V¯are the mean firing rate and mean peak velocity. Unfortunately, neural firing rates cannot be measured exactly. Cortical neurons have noisy spiking statistics that approximate a Poisson process (Churchland et al., 2006bChurchland M.M. Yu B.M. Ryu S.I. Santhanam G. Shenoy K.V. Neural variability in premotor cortex provides a signature of motor preparation.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 3697-3712Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, Tolhurst et al., 1983Tolhurst D.J. Movshon J.A. Dean A.F. The statistical reliability of signals in single neurons in cat and monkey visual cortex.Vision Res. 1983; 23: 775-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Poisson spiking statistics will greatly reduce both trial-by-trial correlation coefficients (r) and the subjective impression of effect strength. Yet regression slopes still approximate the predicted slope (compare the two right panels in Figure 3A). Thus, if behavioral variability is not due to preparatory variability, we expect correlation coefficients and regression slopes near zero. If behavioral variability is due solely to preparatory variability, we expect modest correlation coefficients and regression slopes that approximate the predicted slope. Finally, given noisy spiking statistics, moderately large numbers of trials may be necessary to determine the presence or absence of effects. Empirically, statistical power is indeed a challenge. Figure 3B plots the delay-period response versus peak velocity for one example neuron/target location (same as in Figure 2B). For the instructed-slow condition, the correlation coefficient was 0.42 and the regression slope was 138 spikes/s per m/s (exceeding the predicted slope: 42 spikes/s per m/s). For the instructed-fast condition, the correlation coefficient was 0.31 and the regression slope was 40 spikes/s per m/s (roughly equal to the predicted slope). Yet given only 22 trials per condition, neither effect was statistically significant (p = 0.054 and 0.16, respectively). Thus, while there appear to be strong trial-by-trial effects, statistical power is poor at the level of a single neuron and single target location. Might statistical power be greater if we considered variability in reach distance or direction rather than velocity? As is discussed further below, behavioral variability in velocity, relative to the strength of “speed tuning,” is considerably greater than that for distance or direction. As can be seen in Figure 3B, the principal problem is not effect magnitude. The basic effect of instructed-speed is 20 spikes/s, and regression slopes are 138 and 40 spikes/s per m/s. These are sizeable effects, given that delay-period modulations in PMd/M1 are typically only a few tens of spikes/s (e.g., Crammond and Kalaska, 2000Crammond D.J. Kalaska J.F. Prior information in motor and premotor cortex: activity during the delay period and effect on pre-movement activity.J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 84: 986-1005PubMed Google Scholar, Lecas et al., 1986Lecas J.C. Requin J. Anger C. Vitton N. Changes in neuronal activity of the monkey precentral cortex during preparation for movement.J. Neurophysiol. 1986; 56: 1680-1702PubMed Google Scholar). Rather, statistical power is limited by the measurement of noisy spiking over a finite time (the 400–800 ms delay period). One might attempt to reduce that measurement variability using a much longer (e.g., 5 s) delay, but there is no guarantee that the state of motor preparation would remain stationary across that time. Alternately, measurement variability would matter less if we could encourage greater behavioral variability. This would certainly increase correlation coefficients and statistical power. However, it would also undermine the scientific purpose of the study. Certainly one can create behavioral variability by planning different movements on different trials. The central issue is whether performance, when near its best, still contains significant variability due to movement preparation. During training, considerable effort was expended to encourage monkeys to perform consistently, with velocity variability comparable to that of a human trying its best. An ironic consequence of this accurate behavior is that correlation coefficients and statistical power are expected to be low. In summary, those design features that limit statistical power are essential. Improving statistical power therefore necessitates analyzing more trials. In principal, one could employ a single target location so that ∼500 trials of the same type could be analyzed per neuron. However, that design renders the target completely predictable, allowing motor preparation to begin well before the delay (the analyzed epoch). We therefore tested each neuron using a range of target directions and distances (see Experimental Procedures). For statistical power, trials are pooled across target-locations with the same preferred instructed-speed (e.g., the different target distances in Figure 2A). To allow meaningful pooling, we express each trial's firing rate and peak velocity relative to the mean for that target location (see Experimental Procedures). Figure 4A plots the results of this analysis for neuron B24. Results are similar to those in Figure 3B, but effects are now statistically significant. Correlation coefficients are 0.33 and 0.30, and regression slopes (72 and 37 spikes/s per m/s) compare favorably with the mean predicted slope (38 spikes/s per m/s, averaged across target-locations). Figure 4B plots the same analysis for a second example neuron (A06). This neuron preferred the instructed-slow condition for all target locations. In agreement, trial-by-trial correlations are negative (−0.20 and −0.24). Regression slopes are −11 and −13 spikes/s per m/s, slightly less than the mean predicted slope of −15 spikes/s per m/s. The analysis in Figure 4 was repeated for all neurons where a robust instructed-speed preference spanned enough target locations to allow pooling of ≥50 trials (see Experimental Procedures). Correlation coefficients (Figure 5A) and regression slopes (Figure 5C) are expressed as positive values if they had the same sign as the predicted slope. Distributions were shifted significantly in the expected direction, and all individually significant effects (black bars) were in the expected direction. The prevalence of significant effects at the level of single neurons is notable, given the large number of neurons that presumably participate in motor preparation. This suggests considerable correlation among neurons, something addressed further below. The above analyses reveal the presence of trial-by-trial effects, but do not examine whether those effects scale as predicted. Are correlations stronger and regression slopes steeper when predicted slopes are steeper? This question can be addressed if we pool data not within each neuron, but across neurons and target locations that share a similar predicted slope. This approach also allows us to include data from all neurons, including those where the effect of instructed-speed was weak or present for only a few target locations. We pooled single-trial data across all neurons/target locations with a similar predicted slope (in bins from −60 to 110 spikes/s per m/s). As above, means were subtracted before pooling. Figure 5B plots, for each bin, the correlation between velocity and firing rate. All correlation coefficients have the predicted sign, and most were significant (i.e., the 95% confidence intervals don't overlap zero). Furthermore, correlation coefficients scaled in magnitude with the predicted slope, and were, for the extrema, −0.36 and 0.19. This analysis was repeated for measurements of the regression slope (Figure 5D). That slope differed significantly from zero for 11 of 15 bins, and every bin had a sign that agreed with the predicted slope. However, the trial-by-trial slope was quite convincingly smaller than the predicted slope, with 12/16 bins plotting significantly below the line of unity slope. The mean ratio of the trial-by-trial to predicted slope (the “slope-ratio”) was 0.47, and was similar (means of 0.43 and 0.50) for negative and positive predicted slopes. This analysis highlights a critical component of our experimental design: the use of instructed-speeds allows quantitative comparison of the measured and predicted slopes. The empirical slope-ratios fall, on average, halfway between the extremes illustrated in Figure 3A. We also analyzed the trial-by-trial relationship between peak velocity and peri-movement muscle activity. Twenty-four EMG recordings were made from the deltoid, biceps brachii, triceps brachii, trapezius, latissimus dorsi, and pectoralis major. Figure 6A plots representative single-trial recordings from the deltoid. As expected, EMG differed between the two instructed-speeds. Regardless of the ultimate cause (preparatory or online, central or peripheral), trial-by-trial variations in muscle activity are presumably the direct cause of peak-velocity variations. It was thus unsurprising to observe significant trial-by-trial relationships between EMG and velocity. Figure 6B plots, for this same recording, the mean EMG magnitude on each trial versus the peak velocity (EMG activity was rectified and averaged from −75 to +250 ms relative to movement onset). Trial-by-trial slopes are clearly present but are less than the predicted slope. Analyzed across all muscle recordings and target locations, correlation coefficients ranged from −0.03 to 0.45 and the mean slope-ratio was 0.41 (Figure 6C). A slope-ratio less than one is not necessarily unexpected. There are likely differences between the instructed-fast and -slow EMG beyond the differences related to peak velocity per se (e.g., greater cocontraction for the instructed-fast reaches beyond that expected, given their greater velocity). If so, the trial-by-trial slope will tend to underestimate the predicted slope (see the Discussion and the Supplemental Data for further consideration of this phenomenon). Still, it is noteworthy how similar the results were for neural data recorded during the preparatory period (mean slope-ratio = 0.47) and for EMG recorded during the movement (mean slope-ratio = 0.41). The analysis in Figures 6B and 6C was based on the average EMG in a window (−75 to +250 ms with respect to movement onset) that included the entire movement. Assuming that motor preparation involves planning of the entire movement, this is a reasonable window to use when comparing results for EMG and preparatory activity. However, we note that very similar results (mean slope-ratio = 0.42) were obtained using a shorter window (−75 to +50 ms) that preceded peak velocity. In a related analysis, instead of taking the average EMG for each trial, we took the projection of each trial's EMG onto the direction defined by the difference in mean (across trials) EMG between the two instructed-speeds. Slope-ratios were similar to those found when using the average, and this was true whether we used the long (−75 to +250 ms, mean slope-ratio = 0.36) or short (−75 to +50 ms, mean slope-ratio = 0.44) analysis period. As a control, we analyzed delay-period EMG activity. Trial-by-trial slopes are all near zero, and did not scale with the predicted slope (blue symbols in Figure 6C, mean ratio of −0.11). As changes in the EMG signal during the delay were rare, one would not expect delay-period EMG to predict upcoming reach velocity. If monkeys regularly “mistake” an instructed-slow trial for an instructed-fast trial (and vice versa), that could create a trial-by-trial relationship where one might not otherwise exist. However, most violations of the peak-velocity constraints involved reaching only slightly too fast or too slow. Large categorical errors were uncommon, and were excluded from further analysis (see Experimental Procedures). We also recomputed the most critical analysis (Figure 5D) using both stricter criteria (even minor peak-velocity violations rejected) and looser criteria (no rejections). Results were essentially identical to those originally obtained (mean slope-ratios of 0.49 and 0.42, respectively). A second concern regards potentially nonstationary behavior over the 1000–4000 trials performed during a session. Peak velocities were often slightly lower overall near the end of a session, presumably due to minor fatigue or waning motivation. This nonstationarity in behavior could, if there were a parallel n"

A poorly understood aspect of this control is the role and composition of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles that mediate transport and translation of neuronal RNAs. Here, we show that staufen- and FMRP-containing RNPs in Drosophila neurons contain proteins also present in somatic ""P bodies,"" including the RNA-degradative enzymes Dcp1p and Xrn1p/Pacman and crucial components of miRNA (argonaute), NMD (Upf1p), and general translational repression (Dhh1p/Me31B) pathways. Drosophila Me31B is shown to participate (1) with an FMRP-associated, P body protein (Scd6p/trailer hitch) in FMRP-driven, argonaute-dependent translational repression in developing eye imaginal discs; (2) in dendritic elaboration of larval sensory neurons; and (3) in bantam miRNA-mediated translational repression in wing imaginal discs. These results argue for a conserved mechanism of translational control critical to neuronal function and open up new experimental avenues for understanding the regulation of mRNA function within neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2148359857,"When humans attempt to perform two tasks at once, execution of the first task usually leads to postponement of the second one. This task delay is thought to result from a bottleneck occurring at a central, amodal stage of information processing that precludes two response selection or decision-making operations from being concurrently executed. Using time-resolved functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), here we present a neural basis for such dual-task limitations, e.g. the inability of the posterior lateral prefrontal cortex, and possibly the superior medial frontal cortex, to process two decision-making operations at once. These results suggest that a neural network of frontal lobe areas acts as a central bottleneck of information processing that severely limits our ability to multitask."
https://openalex.org/W2104073930,"Much of the genome is transcribed into long noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). Previous data suggested that bithoraxoid (bxd) ncRNAs of the Drosophila bithorax complex (BX-C) prevent silencing of Ultrabithorax (Ubx) and recruit activating proteins of the trithorax group (trxG) to their maintenance elements (MEs). We found that, surprisingly, Ubx and several bxd ncRNAs are expressed in nonoverlapping patterns in both embryos and imaginal discs, suggesting that transcription of these ncRNAs is associated with repression, not activation, of Ubx. Our data rule out siRNA or miRNA-based mechanisms for repression by bxd ncRNAs. Rather, ncRNA transcription itself, acting in cis, represses Ubx. The Trithorax complex TAC1 binds the Ubx coding region in nuclei expressing Ubx, and the bxd region in nuclei not expressing Ubx. We propose that TAC1 promotes the mosaic pattern of Ubx expression by facilitating transcriptional elongation of bxd ncRNAs, which represses Ubx transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2028620081,"Neural progenitors in the adult dentate gyrus continuously produce new functional granule cells. Here we used whole-cell patch-clamp recordings to explore whether a pathological environment influences synaptic properties of new granule cells labeled with a GFP-retroviral vector. Rats were exposed to a physiological stimulus, i.e., running, or a brain insult, i.e., status epilepticus, which gave rise to neuronal death, inflammation, and chronic seizures. Granule cells formed after these stimuli exhibited similar intrinsic membrane properties. However, the new neurons born into the pathological environment differed with respect to synaptic drive and short-term plasticity of both excitatory and inhibitory afferents. The new granule cells formed in the epileptic brain exhibited functional connectivity consistent with reduced excitability. We demonstrate a high degree of plasticity in synaptic inputs to adult-born new neurons, which could act to mitigate pathological brain function."
https://openalex.org/W2085240418,"Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) is thought to mediate morphological responses to a variety of extracellular signals. Surprisingly, we found no gross morphological deficits in nervous system development in GSK-3β null mice. We therefore designed an shRNA that targeted both GSK-3 isoforms. Strong knockdown of both GSK-3α and β markedly reduced axon growth in dissociated cultures and slice preparations. We then assessed the role of different GSK-3 substrates in regulating axon morphology. Elimination of activity toward primed substrates only using the GSK-3 R96A mutant was associated with a defect in axon polarity (axon branching) compared to an overall reduction in axon growth induced by a kinase-dead mutant. Consistent with this finding, moderate reduction of GSK-3 activity by pharmacological inhibitors induced axon branching and was associated primarily with effects on primed substrates. Our results suggest that GSK-3 is a downstream convergent point for many axon growth regulatory pathways and that differential regulation of primed versus all GSK-3 substrates is associated with a specific morphological outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2003717699,"Neural stem cells are retained in the postnatal subventricular zone (SVZ), a specialized neurogenic niche with unique cytoarchitecture and cell-cell contacts. Although the SVZ stem cells continuously regenerate, how they and the niche respond to local changes is unclear. Here we generated nestin-creER(tm) transgenic mice with inducible Cre recombinase in the SVZ and removed Numb/Numblike, key regulators of embryonic neurogenesis from postnatal SVZ progenitors and ependymal cells. This resulted in severe damage to brain lateral ventricle integrity and identified roles for Numb/Numblike in regulating ependymal wall integrity and SVZ neuroblast survival. Surprisingly, the ventricular damage was eventually repaired: SVZ reconstitution and ventricular wall remodeling were mediated by progenitors that escaped Numb deletion. Our results show a self-repair mechanism in the mammalian brain and may have implications for both niche plasticity in other areas of stem cell biology and the therapeutic use of neural stem cells in neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2018372068,"Recently we demonstrated that PLC(epsilon) plays an important role in beta-adrenergic receptor (betaAR) stimulation of Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release (CICR) in cardiac myocytes. Here we have reported for the first time that a pathway downstream of betaAR involving the cAMP-dependent Rap GTP exchange factor, Epac, and PLC(epsilon) regulates CICR in cardiac myocytes. To demonstrate a role for Epac in the stimulation of CICR, cardiac myocytes were treated with an Epac-selective cAMP analog, 8-4-(chlorophenylthio)-2'-O-methyladenosine-3',5'-monophosphate (cpTOME). cpTOME treatment increased the amplitude of electrically evoked Ca(2+) transients, implicating Epac for the first time in cardiac CICR. This response is abolished in PLC(epsilon)(-/-) cardiac myocytes but rescued by transduction with PLC(epsilon), indicating that Epac is upstream of PLC(epsilon). Furthermore, transduction of PLC(epsilon)(+/+) cardiac myocytes with a Rap inhibitor, RapGAP1, significantly inhibited isoproterenol-dependent CICR. Using a combination of cpTOME and PKA-selective activators and inhibitors, we have shown that betaAR-dependent increases in CICR consist of two independent components mediated by PKA and the novel Epac/(epsilon) pathway. We also show that Epac/PLC(epsilon)-dependent effects on CICR are independent of sarcoplasmic reticulum loading and Ca(2+) clearance mechanisms. These data define a novel endogenous PKA-independent betaAR-signaling pathway through cAMP-dependent Epac activation, Rap, and PLC(epsilon) that enhances intracellular Ca(2+) release in cardiac myocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2122902961,"It is widely presumed that odor quality is a direct outcome of odorant structure, but human studies indicate that molecular knowledge of an odorant is not always sufficient to predict odor quality. Indeed, the same olfactory input may generate different odor percepts depending on prior learning and experience. Combining functional magnetic resonance imaging with an olfactory paradigm of perceptual learning, we examined how sensory experience modifies odor perception and odor quality coding in the human brain. Prolonged exposure to a target odorant enhanced perceptual differentiation for odorants related in odor quality or functional group, an effect that was paralleled by learning-induced response increases in piriform cortex and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Critically, the magnitude of OFC activation predicted subsequent improvement in behavioral differentiation. Our findings suggest that neural representations of odor quality can be rapidly updated through mere perceptual experience, a mechanism that may underlie the development of odor perception."

Briefly, male mice (22–24 g) were anesthetized with a mixture of isoflurane (1.5–2%), oxygen, and nitrogen. A fiber optic probe was glued to the parietal bone (2-mm posterior and 5-mm lateral to the bregma) and connected to a Laser-Doppler Flowmetry (Periflux System 5010; Perimed, Jarfalla, Sweden) for continuous monitoring of cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the center of the ischemic territory. For MCAO, a 6-0 teflon coated black monofilament surgical suture (Doccol Co, Redlands, CA) was inserted into the exposed external carotid artery, advanced into the internal carotid artery and wedged into the cerebral arterial circle to obstruct the origin of MCA. The filament was left in place for 30 min and then withdrawn. Only animals that exhibited both a reduction in CBF more than 80% during MCAO and a recovery of CBF >80% by 10 min of reperfusion were included in the study.

In initial studies, SS20 was included as a control because it lacks free radical scavenging properties (2.Zhao K. Zhao G.M. Wu D. Soong Y. Birk A.V. Schiller P.W. Szeto H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34682-34690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). We found a difference in percent GSH change at 6-h post-ischemia between vehicle- and SS31-treated, but not between vehicle- and SS20-treated groups. Therefore, in subsequent studies we utilized only SS31. For measurement of infarct volume, vehicle or SS31 (2 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg of body weight) was administered immediately after reperfusion (0 h), and at 6 h, 24 h, and 48 h post-ischemia. The multiple injection paradigm was used, because there is a biphasic ROS production and sustained CD36 expression in post-ischemic brain (1.Cho S. Park E.M. Febbraio M. Anrather J. Park L.

Blood Flow Metab. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The dosage of SS31 used in the present study was based on the dosage previously used in protection against myocardial ischemia (22.Song W. Shin J. Lee J. Kim H. Oh D. Edelberg J.M. Wong S.C. Szeto H. Hong M.K. Coron. Artery Dis. 2005; 16: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and in a model of neurodegeneration (27.Petri S.

Mice were sacrificed 72 h after ischemia. Brains were removed, frozen, and sectioned (thickness, 30 μm) in a cryostat as previously described (1.Cho S. Park E.M. Febbraio M. Anrather J. Park L. Racchumi G. Silverstein R.L. Iadecola C. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Brain sections were collected serially at 600-μm intervals, and stained with Cresyl Violet. Infarct volume was determined using Axiovision (Zeiss, Germany) and the contribution because of swelling was corrected using the method described elsewhere (28.Lin T.-N. He Y.Y. Wu G. Khan M. Hsu C.Y. Stroke. 1993; 24: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Sample Preparation−Brain tissue from cortex and striatum of both ipsilateral and contralateral side were collected prior to ischemia (sham-operated non-ischemic animals) and 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h after 30 min of transient MCAO. Aliquots of right and left cortex and striatum were individually transferred into cryostat vials, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C until analyses. For determination of selected redox active compounds, each tissue sample was homogenized in 10 volumes of deionized water (w/v) at 4 °C using a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer fitted with a Teflon pestle attached to a motor. To precipitate proteins, a 100-μl aliquot of each homogenate was added to 400 μl of ice-cold 6.25% (w/v) metaphosphoric acid (MPA), and the sample was incubated for 10 min on ice. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, aliquots of the 5% MPA supernatant fractions were saved for HPLC determination of redox active analytes using electrochemical detection. HPLC Chromatography−Concentrations of the redox-active ascorbate and the aminothiols, cysteine and GSH, were measured without prior derivatization using a Perkin-Elmer Liquid Chromatograph equipped with an 8-channel coulometric array (CoulArray) detector (ESA, Inc., Chelmsford, MA) (29.Lakritz J. Plopper C.G. Buckpitt A.R. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 30.Pinto J.T. Van Raamsdonk J.M. Leavitt B.R. Hayden M.R. Jeitner T.M. Thaler H.T. Krasnikov B.F. Cooper A.J. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 1087-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The supernatant fractions from the 5% MPA homogenates were injected directly onto a Bio-Sil ODS-5S, 5-μm particle size, 4.0 × 250 mm, C18 column (Bio-Rad) and eluted at ambient temperature with a mobile phase consisting of 50 mm NaH2PO4, 0.05 mm 1-octanesulfonic acid, 1% acetonitrile (v/v), and 0.5% N,N-dimethylformamide (v/v) (pH 2.70) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. PEEK™ (polyetheretherketone) tubing was used throughout the HPLC system, and a 0.2 μm PEEK™ filter was placed pre- and post-column to protect both column and flow cells, respectively, from any particulate matter. A Rheodyne injection valve with a 5-μl sample loop was used to manually introduce samples. The 8-channel CoulArray detectors were set at 250, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, and 700 mV, respectively. To assure standardization between analyses, calibration standards were interspersed at intervals among sample runs. Peak areas were analyzed using ESA, Inc. software. Concentrations of each redox active compound (cysteine, ascorbic acid, and GSH) were obtained from appropriate standard curves and were reported as nmol/mg protein. Protein Determination−Protein precipitates from 5% MPA preparations were dissolved in 500 μl of 0.1 n NaOH, and protein was quantitated by a spectrophotometric method using bicinchoninic acid reagent (Pierce). Mice were sacrificed 4 days after an intraperitoneal injection of 3 ml of sterile 4% thioglycolate broth. The peritoneal cavity was exposed and 2–4 ml of sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was injected. The cavity was gently massaged and the PBS was withdrawn. Peritoneal lavage was repeated 3–4 times until the solution is no longer cloudy. Cells were obtained by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 15 min. MPM were cultured in a 12-well (2 × 106 cells/well, for CD36 mRNA), 6-well culture dish (5 × 106 cells/well, for CD36 Western analysis), or 8 chamber slide (1 × 105 cells/well, for foam cell formation) and incubated overnight with macrophage serum-free media (Invitrogen). The cells were washed with sterile PBS three times then treated with 25 μg/ml oxLDL with or without SS31 (1 μm or 10 nm) for 48 h. MPM were used for CD36 expression and foam cell formation. Relative mRNA levels of CD36 were quantified with real-time quantitative RT-PCR using fluorescent TaqMan technology. Total RNA was extracted from brain tissue or MPM using TRI reagent (MRC, Cincinnati, OH). 1 μg (brain tissue) or 200 ng (MPM) total RNA was reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT) primers and the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. PCR primers and probes specific for CD36 and β-actin were obtained as TaqMan predeveloped assay reagents for gene expression (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). β-Actin was used as an internal control for normalization of samples. The PCR reaction was performed using TaqMan Universal PCR Master mix, No AmpErase UNG, and Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) according to instructions provided by the manufacturers. Reactions were performed in a total volume of 20 μl and were incubated at 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C. Reactions without cDNA were included as controls. The results were analyzed by 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR Systems software. Thioglycolate-elicited MPM were harvested and plated in a 6-well culture dish (5 million cells/well) and incubated for overnight with macrophage serum-free media according to a published procedure (31.Febbraio M. Podrez E.A. Smith J.D. Hajjar D.P. Hazen S.L. Hoff H.F. Sharma K. Silverstein R.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 1049-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). The cells were then treated with 25 μg/ml oxLDL with or without SS31 (10 nm) for 48 h. MPM were homogenized in three volumes of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01 μm NaF, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40) with freshly added protease inhibitor. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and the protein concentration was determined (Bio-Rad). CD36 protein expression was determined according to the method described previously (1.Cho S. Park E.M. Febbraio M. Anrather J. Park L. Racchumi G. Silverstein R.L. Iadecola C. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Proteins (2 μg) were loaded on a gel, electrophoresed, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride filters using an electroblotting apparatus. Filters were treated for 1 h in TBS (pH 7.2) containing 0.1% Tween-20 and 5% dry milk, and then incubated with CD36 polyclonal antibodies (1:1000; AF2519; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) followed by mouse IgA-HRP (Sigma). For normalization, anti-β-actin antibody (1:1000, SC1615, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used. Filters were washed, and the bands were visualized using a chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce). Thioglycolate-elicited MPM were cultured in 8-well chamber slides. After an overnight incubation in macrophage serum-free media, cultures were treated with 25 μg/ml oxLDL with or without SS31 (10 nm) for 48 h. Cultures were washed with PBS, fixed in methanol for 5 min, stained with oil red-O for 4 h in a moisturized chamber, washed three times with PBS, and coverslipped. The experiments were repeated four times. To quantify the foam cell formation, four areas (625 μm2 each) were blindly selected from each culture. Areas that fell within threshold intensity by oil red-O staining were determined using Adobe Photoshop. Values were expressed as total pixels ± S.D. Ischemia Reduces Ascorbate and GSH Levels−Cysteine, ascorbate, and GSH levels were determined in the post-ischemic cortex and striatum. Whereas cysteine levels were gradually decreased in the non-ischemic hemispheres after ischemia, cysteine levels in the ischemic side were significantly higher than those in the contralateral side by 6 h after ischemia (Fig. 1, A and B). By contrast, the levels of ascorbate and GSH, the major water-soluble intracellular antioxidants in brain, were progressively decreased in the ipsilateral side within a few hours of reperfusion (Fig. 1, C–F). Antioxidant depletion was significant in both cortex and striatum by 6 h of reperfusion. The depletion was greater at 24 h, at a time when the infarct is histologically visible. These data suggest that biochemical changes toward pro-oxidation status precede histological changes. Treatment with SS31, but Not SS20, Attenuates GSH Depletion in Post-ischemic Cortex−To test the efficacy of SS31 on redox status, cysteine, ascorbate, and GSH levels were determined 6 h after ischemia in mice that were treated intraperitoneally (intraperitoneal) with saline (vehicle), SS31 (2 mg/kg), or SS20 (2 mg/kg) upon reperfusion (Table 1). The values were expressed as percent increase (cysteine) and percent depletion (ascorbate and GSH) compared with the contralateral values. No significant percent difference was observed in cysteine and ascorbate among vehicle-, SS31-, and SS20-treated groups (data not shown). By contrast, ischemia-induced percent GSH depletion in the ipsilateral cortex was significantly attenuated in SS31-treated animals compared with that of the vehicle-treated group (Fig. 2). The degree of ipsilateral GSH depletion in SS20-treated mice was not significantly different from that of vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 2). The data suggest that SS31 assists in maintaining antioxidant status and protects against ischemia-induced depletion of GSH in the cortex.TABLE 1Effect of SS peptides on ischemia-induced cysteine, ascorbate, and GSH levels C57BL/6 mice were subjected to 30 min of MCAO and treated with saline (Veh), SS31 (2 mg/kg body weight), or SS20 (2 mg/kg body weight) peptide immediately after reperfusion.

https://openalex.org/W2011615854,"Mig1 and Hxk2 are two major mediators of glucose repression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, the mechanism by which Hxk2 participates in the glucose repression signaling pathway is not completely understood. Recently, it has been demonstrated that Hxk2 interacts with Mig1 to generate a repressor complex located in the nucleus of S. cerevisiae. However, the mechanism by which Mig1 favors the presence of Hxk2 in the nucleus is not clear, and the function of Hxk2 at the nuclear repressor complex level is still unknown. Here, we report that serine 311 of Mig1 is a critical residue for interaction with Hxk2 and that this interaction is regulated by glucose. Our findings suggest that Snf1 interacts constitutively with the Hxk2 component of the repressor complex at high and low glucose conditions. Furthermore, we show that Snf1 binds to Mig1 under low glucose conditions and that binding is largely abolished after a shift to high glucose medium. We found that phosphorylation of serine 311 of Mig1 by Snf1 kinase is essential for Mig1 protein nuclear export and derepression of the SUC2 gene in glucose-limited cells. These results allow postulating that the Hxk2 operates by interacting both with Mig1 and Snf1 to inhibit the Mig1 phosphorylation at serine 311 during high glucose grown.

These results allow postulating that the Hxk2 operates by interacting both with Mig1 and Snf1 to inhibit the Mig1 phosphorylation at serine 311 during high glucose grown. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has developed mechanisms to adapt to fluctuations in food supply. This ability to grow in different media is a result of the capacity of S. cerevisiae to sense and respond to changes in the availability of nutrients. Although transcriptional control is the focus of the majority of investigated glucose responses, responses to environmental stimuli bring about changes in gene expression (1.Johnston M. Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 458-476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), mRNA stability (2.Cereghino G.P. Scheffler I.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and post-translational modifications (3.Thevelein J.M. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1753-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Among sugars, glucose is the preferred carbon and energy source. The information regarding glucose availability is transduced to the nucleus by three main systems, the Mig1-Hxk2 glucose repression signaling pathway (4.Gancedo J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 334-361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Moreno F. Herrero P. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 83-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the Snf3-Rgt2 sensing pathway (6.Ozcan S. Dover J. Rosenwald A.G. Wolfl S. Johnston M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12428-12432Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), and the Gpr1-cAMP pathway (7.Rolland F. Winderickx J. Thevelein J.M. FEMS Yeast Res. 2002; 2: 183-201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the glucose repression signaling pathway, two major mediators are proteins, Mig1 and Hxk2. The functions of both proteins have been extensively studied, but there is limited information about possible interactions among them in the repression pathway. The Mig1-dependent aspect of the glucose repression pathway has been elucidated in great detail. Snf1 kinase, a homologue of mammalian AMP-activated kinase, plays a central role in regulating this part of the pathway. The Snf1 kinase, under low glucose conditions, is activated and modifies the phosphorylation state of Mig1 (8.Carlson M. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Snf1 kinase forms a complex with an activating subunit Snf4 and one of the three Snf1-interacting proteins Sip1, Sip2, or Gal83, which target Snf1 to distinct subcellular locations (9.Vincent O. Townley R. Kuchin S. Carlson M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1104-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Regulation of Snf1 activity involves phosphorylation of the Snf1 catalytic subunit by three kinases (10.Nath N. McCartney R.R. Schmidt M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3909-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 11.Hong S.P. Leiper F.C. Woods A. Carling D. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8839-8843Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) and binding of Snf4 (12.Jiang R. Carlson M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3105-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In addition, a decreased Glc7 phosphatase activity, in a Δreg1 mutant strain for example, or the absence of the Hxk2 protein may also contribute to Snf1 activation (13.Treitel M.A. Kuchin S. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6273-6280Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 14.McCartney R.R. Schmidt M.C. J. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 20: 1321-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The activated Snf1 protein kinase phosphorylates at least four serine residues of Mig1 protein in low glucose growth conditions (13.Treitel M.A. Kuchin S. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6273-6280Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Mig1 phosphorylation causes translocation of the protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (16.De Vit M.J. Waddle J.A. Johnston M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1603-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Thus, the activity of Mig1 is regulated by phosphorylation and subcellular localization. In high glucose, Mig1 is dephosphorylated by the Glc7-Reg1 protein phosphatase complex (17.Alms G.R. Sanz P. Carlson M. Haystead T.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4157-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and is found primarily in the nucleus, where it can repress transcription. In contrast to the fairly well defined Mig1 portion of the glucose repression signaling pathway, the mechanisms underlying the Hxk2 functions are not fully understood. Evidence demonstrates that the nuclear localization of both Hxk2 and Mig1 proteins are required for glucose repression signaling (18.Herrero P. Martinez-Campa C. Moreno F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 19.Palomino A. Herrero P. Moreno F. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 697-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Current evidence suggests that Hxk2 nuclear localization is modulated by the availability of glucose, and Mig1 is required to sequester Hxk2 in the nucleus (20.Ahuatzi D. Herrero P. de la Cera T. Moreno F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14440-14446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Recent data revealed that the mechanism of Hxk2 sequestration in the nucleus is based on direct Hxk2 interaction with Mig1. This interaction is mediated by a 10-amino acid motif in Hxk2 located between Lys-6 and Met-15 (18.Herrero P. Martinez-Campa C. Moreno F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 20.Ahuatzi D. Herrero P. de la Cera T. Moreno F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14440-14446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and has been detected at the DNA level in vivo by chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments (21.Moreno F. Ahuatzi D. Riera A. Palomino C.A. Herrero P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, these findings suggest that the main role of Hxk2 is produced by interacting with Mig1 to generate a repressor complex located in the nucleus of S. cerevisiae. However, the mechanism by which Mig1 favors the presence of Hxk2 in the nucleus is not clear, and the function of Hxk2 at the nuclear repressor complex level is still unknown. In this study, the functions of Hxk2 in regulating the Mig1 phosphorylation state and its subcellular localization were analyzed. Here, we demonstrate that Hxk2 interacts in vivo with both Mig1 and the Snf1 catalytic subunit of the Snf1 protein kinase complex. We also show that serine 311 of Mig1 is a critical residue controlling Mig1 subcellular localization and derepression of genes regulated by the Hxk2-Mig1 glucose repression signaling pathway, such as the SUC2 gene.

Escherichia coli DH5α (F Ø80dlacZ ΔM15 recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 hsdR17(rk-rk-) supE44 relA1 deoRΔ (lacZ YA-argF)U169) was the host bacterial strain for the recombinant plasmid constructions. Fusion protein expression were performed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS (Promega, Madison, WI). Yeast cells were grown in the following media: YEPD, high glucose (2% glucose, 2% peptone, and 1% yeast extract), YEPE, low glucose (0.05% glucose, 3% ethanol, 2% peptone, and 1% yeast extract), and synthetic media containing the appropriate carbon source and lacking appropriate supplements to maintain selection for plasmids (2% glucose (SD), or 3% ethanol and 0.05% glucose (SE), and 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids). Amino acids and other growth requirements were added at a final concentration of 20–150 μg/ml. The solid media contained 2% agar in addition to the components described above. Plasmids−The plasmids used in this study are described in Table 1. For two-hybrid analysis, Mig1 is numbered from residues 1 to 504 (28.Tettelin H. Agostoni Carbone M.L. Albermann K. Albers M.

Mol. Gen. Genet. 1980; 178: 633-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In Mig1, residue 1 is the initiator methionine in the primary translation product. However, in Hxk2, residue 1 is a valine because the initiator methionine is cleaved off in the primary translation product. The plasmids carrying partial segments of MIG1 gene and the encoded products are named according to the codons/amino acids that are retained in the constructs. Plasmids pGBKT7/MIG1 and pACT2/HXK2 were constructed as indicated in a previous study (20.Ahuatzi D. Herrero P. de la Cera T. Moreno F. J. Biol.

To make plasmids pGBKT7/MIG1–381, -352, -240, -123, and -67, 384-bp SalI-SpeI, 471-bp SalI-ClaI, 807-bp SalI-NheI, 1157-bp SalI-SwaI, and 1325-bp SalI-MluI fragments were, respectively, removed from plasmid pGBKT7/MIG1, and the linear DNAs were blunt-ended by filling and circulated by self-ligation.

Open table in a new tab To mutate sites in Mig1, the 1515-bp BamHI-BamHI fragment from plasmid pGBKT7/MIG1, carrying the complete coding region of MIG1 gene, was cloned into pUC19 to give plasmid pUC19/MIG1. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by using plasmid pUC19/MIG1 as the template in the PCR reactions and the oligonucleotides described in Table 2. The mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Plasmids containing the corresponding mutations were digested with SpeI-NheI, and the resulting fragments were subcloned into the SpeI and NheI sites of pGBKT7/MIG1 to generate plasmids pGBKT7/MIG1 S278A, pGBKT7/MIG1S310A, and pGBKT7/MIG1S311A.TABLE 2Oligonucleotides used for PCRAmino acid replacementNameSense/antisenseSequenceS278AOL1SenseTTACCAAGGCCGCGAGCTTTAACGGATTTTCOL2AntisenseGAAAATCCGTTAAAGCTCGCGGCCTTGGTAAS310AOL3SenseCAGTTGAAGAGACCAGCTTCAGTTTTAAGTTTGOL4AntisenseCAAACTTAAAACTGAAGCTGGTCTCTTCAACTGS311AOL5SenseGTTGAAGAGACCAAGTGCAGTTTTAAGTTTGAOL6AntisenseTCAAACTTAAAACTGCACTTGGTCTCTTCAAC Open table in a new tab For fluorescence microscopy and glucose repression analysis, plasmids YEp352/MIG1::gfp, YEp352/MIG1S310A::gfp, and YEp352/MIG1S311A::gfp were constructed as follows: a 969-bp BamHI-BglII fragment containing the gfp gene was subcloned, respectively, into YEp352/MIG1, YEp352/MIG1S310A, and YEp352/MIG1 S311A plasmids first cleaved with BamHI. Plasmid YEp352/MIG1 was constructed as follows: a 2774-bp SacI-SacI fragment containing the complete coding region of MIG1 gene and 565 bp of the 5′ noncoding region promoter were subcloned into an SacI previously cleaved vector YEp352. The resulting plasmid, YEp352/MIG1, contained in a 2.77-kb SacI-SacI fragment the complete MIG1 gene under the control of its own promoter. Plasmids pGBKT7/MIG1S278A, pGBKT7/MIG1S310A, and pGBKT7/MIG1S311A were digested with SpeI-NheI, and the resulting fragments were subcloned into the SpeI and NheI sites of YEp352/MIG1 to generate plasmids YEp352/MIG1S278A, YEp352/MIG1S310A, and YEp352/MIG1S311A. Plasmid pWS93/MIG1 was generated by cloning a 1.5-kb PCR product containing the MIG1 gene into the BamHI site of vector pWS93, which expresses a triple HA epitope from the ADH1 promoter (a gift of P. Sanz, Valencia). The DNA sequence of all PCR-generated constructs was verified by sequencing. GST fusion vector pGEX/HXK2 was constructed as indicated previously (20.Ahuatzi D. Herrero P. de la Cera T. Moreno F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14440-14446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Microscopy−Yeast strains expressing the Mig1-GFP, Mig1S310A-GFP, or Mig1S311A-GFP fusion proteins were grown to early log phase (A600 of <0.7) in synthetic media containing the appropriate carbon source and lacking the appropriate supplements to maintain selection plasmids. The cells (25 μl) were loaded onto poly l-lysine-coated slides, and the remaining suspension was immediately withdrawn by aspiration. One microliter of DAPI (2.5 μg/ml in 80% glycerol) was added, and a covert slide was placed over the microscope slide. GFP and DAPI localization in live cultures was monitored by direct fluorescence using an Olympus BX61 microscope. Images were processed in Adobe Photoshop 6.0. Preparation of Crude Protein Extracts−Yeast protein extracts were prepared as follows: yeast cells were grown in 10–20 ml of synthetic high glucose medium (SD-ura) at 28 °C to an optical density at 600 nm of 1.0. Half of the culture was shifted to synthetic low glucose medium (SE-ura) for 1 h. Cells were collected, washed twice with 1 ml of 1 m sorbitol, and suspended in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.42 m NaCl, and 1.5 mm MgCl2. The cells were broken in the presence of glass beads by one pulse of 20 s using a FastPrep (Thermo Electron Co.), and 400 μl of the same buffer was added to the suspension. After centrifugation at 19,000 × g (14,000 rpm) for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was used as crude protein extract. Enzyme Assays−For β-galactosidase activity determinations, crude extracts were prepared with glass beads as described above and o-nitrophenol-β-d-galactopyranoside (2 mg/ml) was used as a substrate (30.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Specific activity was calculated in relation to total protein in the crude extract, using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Invertase activity was assayed in whole cells as previously described (31.Gascon S. Neumann N.P. Lampen J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1573-1577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and expressed as micromoles of glucose released per minute per 100 mg of cells (dry weight). Immunoblot Analysis−Mutant or wild-type yeast cells were grown to an optical density at 600 nm of 1.0 in selective medium containing high glucose (2%) and shifted to 0.05% glucose for 1 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation (3000 × g, 4 °C, 1 min), and crude extracts were prepared as described above. For Western blotting, 20–40 μg of proteins was separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to enhanced chemiluminescence polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by electroblotting, which was then incubated with an anti-HA or anti-Hxk2 antibody. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein-A was used as a secondary reactant. The complex was detected by the West Pico Chemiluminescent system (Pierce). Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis−The yeast two-hybrid analysis (32.Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4875) Google Scholar) employed yeast vectors pGADT7 and pGBDKT7 and host strains Y187 (described above) in accordance with the Match-maker two-hybrid system 3 from Clontech. The transformed yeasts were grown in high glucose (SD/-Leu,Trp) medium and shifted for 1 h to low glucose (SE/-Leu,Trp) medium. Assays for β-galactosidase activity followed protocols described elsewhere (30.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Expression levels of the GAD and GBD fusion proteins were controlled by Western blot analysis. Experiments were performed a minimum of three times. Values shown are representative results from individual experiments. Coimmunoprecipitation Assays−Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed by using whole cell extracts, from a wild-type yeast strain with a modified SNF1 gene, which codes for a C-terminal Snf1 protein tagged with 3HA epitopes. Extracts were incubated with anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-Pho4 polyclonal antibody for 1 h at 4°C. Protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were then added, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4°C. After extensive washes with Staph A buffer (150 mm NaCl, 100 mm Na2HPO4, 18 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.3, 20% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, 5% deoxycholate), immunoprecipitated samples were boiled in SDS-loading buffer. The supernatant was subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blot using anti-Hxk2 polyclonal antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein-A by the West Pico Chemiluminescent system (Pierce). GST Pull-down Experiments−GST fusion protein expression vectors pGEX-HXK2, pGEX-MIG1, and pGEX-MIG1(S311A) were transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS. Cells were grown to A600 0.5–0.8, induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 3 h, and collected by centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline buffer (150 mm NaCl, 100 mm Na2HPO4, 18 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.3) and sonicated. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (17,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C). Soluble extracts were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4°C, washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline buffer, and resuspended in the same buffer. The GST-Hxk2, GST-Mig1, and GST-Mig1S311A fusion proteins coupled to glutathione-Sepharose were incubated with yeast whole cell extracts from a wild-type yeast strain with modified SNF1 gene, which codes for a C-terminal Snf1 protein tagged with 3HA epitopes, for 1 h at 4°Cin phosphate-buffered saline buffer. The cell extracts were obtained from yeast cells grown in YEP medium containing high glucose (2%) and shifted to 0.05% glucose plus 3% ethanol (low glucose) for 1 h. Beads were gently washed five times with 2.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline buffer, boiled in 25 μl of sample-loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol), and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot using anti-HA antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein-A. Bound antibodies were detected using the West Pico Chemiluminescent system (Pierce). Mig1 Undergoes Hxk2-dependent Nucleocytoplasmic Transport−To gain insight into the molecular mechanism by which Hxk2 regulates Mig1 function, the glucose-dependent subcellular location of Mig1 was determined in Δhxk2 mutant cells. To detect Mig1 in live cells, GFP was fused to the C terminus of Mig1, and the fusion protein was expressed under control of the MIG1 promoter. It has been previously reported and our results confirmed (Fig. 1) that, in high glucose, Mig1 is located in the nucleus and, upon glucose removal, Mig1 rapidly translocates to the cytoplasm (16.De Vit M.J. Waddle J.A. Johnston M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1603-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 33.DeVit M.J. Johnston M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1231-1241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Interestingly, fluorescence microscopy revealed that, in the absence of the Hxk2 protein, Mig1 is located in the cytoplasm both at high and low glucose conditions (Fig. 1). Previous results indicate that Hxk2 associates directly with Mig1 and that the 6KKPQARKGSM15 motif of Hxk2 is required for interaction with Mig1 at high glucose-grown conditions (20.Ahuatzi D. Herrero P. de la Cera T. Moreno F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14440-14446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The most straightforward interpretation of this result could be that, in the absence of Hxk2, the protein kinase Snf1 is constitutively activated (15.Sanz P. Alms G.R. Haystead T.A. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1321-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 34.Mayordomo I. Estruch F. Sanz P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35650-35656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and, therefore, Mig1 should be constitutively localized in the cytoplasm. However, it could also be that the Mig1-Hxk2 complex is a carrier necessary for Mig1 translocation to the nucleus. This idea is supported by the fact that Hxk2 and Mig1 proteins are physically associated at the nuclear level (20.Ahuatzi D. Herrero P. de la Cera T. Moreno F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14440-14446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 21.Moreno F. Ahuatzi D. Riera A. Palomino C.A. Herrero P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and an Hxk2-Mig1-DNA complex seems to be required in vivo for glucose repression signaling (21.Moreno F. Ahuatzi D. Riera A. Palomino C.A. Herrero P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Therefore, we checked Mig1 localization in the double Δhxk2Δsnf1 mutant strain to determine whether Snf1 protein kinase activity is epistatic to Hxk2 function. The results demonstrate that Mig1 is targeted to the nucleus in the absence of Hxk2 protein (Fig. 2), indicating that the Hxk2 protein function is dispensable for nuclear localization. To determine whether the cytoplasmic localization of Mig1 in the Δhxk2 mutant cells growing in high glucose medium entails phosphorylation of Mig1, we examined Mig1 phosphorylation in vivo in response to high and low levels of glucose (Fig. 3). For this purpose, we prepared extracts from Δsnf1, Δhxk2, and Δhxk2Δsnf1 mutant strains transformed with the Mig1-HA construct. The transformed yeast cells were grown in the presence of high or low glucose. The mobility of Mig1 on SDS-PAGE was examined by Western blotting using an anti-HA antibody. The mobility of Mig1 varies depending on its phosphorylation state (14.McCartney R.R. Schmidt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36460-36466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A (lanes 1 and 2), in the presence of Hxk2, Mig1 from low glucose grown cells displays a slight shift in molecular weight, resulting in decreased mobility, in comparison to Mig1 from high glucose grown cells. However, in the absence of Hxk2 the Snf1 protein kinase complex assumes an active conformation even in the presence of glucose (13.Treitel M.A. Kuchin S. Carlson M. Mol. Cell."
https://openalex.org/W2023695831,"Hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic-nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels mediate the depolarizing cation current (termed Ih or If) that initiates spontaneous rhythmic activity in heart and brain. This function critically depends on the reliable opening of HCN channels in the subthreshold voltage-range. Here we show that activation of HCN channels at physiologically relevant voltages requires interaction with phosphoinositides such as phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). PIP2 acts as a ligand that allosterically opens HCN channels by shifting voltage-dependent channel activation ∼20 mV toward depolarized potentials. Allosteric gating by PIP2 occurs in all HCN subtypes and is independent of the action of cyclic nucleotides. In CNS neurons and cardiomyocytes, enzymatic degradation of phospholipids results in reduced channel activation and slowing of the spontaneous firing rate. These results demonstrate that gating by phospholipids is essential for the pacemaking activity of HCN channels in cardiac and neuronal rhythmogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2059059034,"Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) triggers a redox cycle between ferric and ferryl hemoglobin (Hb) leading to the formation of a transient protein radical and a covalent hemeprotein cross-link. Addition of H2O2 to highly purified human hemoglobin (HbA0) induced structural changes that primarily resided within β subunits followed by the internalization of the heme moiety within α subunits. These modifications were observed when an equal molar concentration of H2O2 was added to HbA0 yet became more abundant with greater concentrations of H2O2. Mass spectrometric and amino acid analysis revealed for the first time that βCys-93 and βCys-112 were oxidized extensively and irreversibly to cysteic acid when HbA0 was treated with H2O2. Oxidation of further amino acids in HbA0 exclusive to the β-globin chain included modification of βTrp-15 to oxyindolyl and kynureninyl products as well as βMet-55 to methionine sulfoxide. These findings may therefore explain the premature collapse of the β subunits as a result of the H2O2 attack. Analysis of a tryptic digest of the main reversed phase-high pressure liquid chromatography fraction revealed two α-peptide fragments (α128 - α139) and a heme moiety with the loss of iron, cross-linked between αSer-138 and the porphyrin ring.

Generation of superoxide (O2.) and its rapid dismutation to H2O2 occurs continuously during normal metabolic processes. However, plasma concentrations of H2O2 are maintained at relatively low levels (≤0.25 μm) in normal healthy humans because of efficient catalase activity (1.Frei B. Yamamoto Y. Niclas D. Ames B.N. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 175: 120-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Concentrations of H2O2 occurring in physiological compartments during pathological conditions (e.g. tissue injury and hemolytic/myolytic diseases) are not well defined largely because of limitations in accurately quantifying compartmentalized H2O2 (2.Stone J.R. Yang S. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2006; 8: 243-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). In vitro studies provide some information on the extent of H2O2 production, for example neutrophil migration to injured tissue sites is reported to generate quantities of H2O2 up to 1000 times greater than the maximum normal plasma concentrations (3.Martin II, W.J. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1984; 130: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). If such findings are translatable to in vivo levels of local tissue H2O2, then numerous modifications to cellular and plasma proteins may take place during peroxidative pathological conditions leading to amino acid and prosthetic group oxidation. The biological significance of oxidatively modified plasma proteins can be manifested as nonfunctional, immunogenic, and toxic biomolecular entities depending on the nature and extent of modification (4.Shacter E. Drug Metab. Rev. 2000; 32: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar).

A complex interplay exists between oxidation of heme iron, heme, and the hemeprotein leading to an irreversible loss of Hb function, Hb degradation, and potentially toxicity. Heme iron reacts with H2O2 in its ferrous (Fe2+) and ferric (Fe3+) forms; however, the oxidative processes proceed quite differently. For example, oxidation of Fe2+ by H2O2 results in the formation of ferryl heme (Fe4+) without generation of a protein or porphyrin-associated free radical. The remaining solution of H2O2 is oxidized by Fe4+ giving O2. and Fe3+. At this point the porphyrin ring may be degraded in a peroxidative cycle as O2. is generated and trapped in the heme pocket (7.Nagababu E. Rifkind J.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12503-12511Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 8.Nagababu E. Rifkind J.M. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2004; 6: 967-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the processes of heme degradation can be enhanced unintentionally when Hb is chemically modified and used as an HBOC, thus the nature of chemical modification greatly influences the geometry of heme and its susceptibility to oxidation and degradation (9.Nagababu E. Ramasamy S. Rifkind J.M. Jia Y. Alayash A.I. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7407-7415Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Fe3+ in the presence of H2O2 oxidizes to oxoferryl (Fe4+=O) and a protein- or prosthetic group-associated free radical resulting from the two-electron reduction of H2O2 to H2O (10.Reeder B.J. Svistunenko D.A. Cooper C.E. Wilson M.T. Antioxid. Redox. signal. 2004; 6: 954-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Previous work demonstrated that H2O2 reacted with metmyoglobin (MbFe3+) in greater than stoichiometric ratios results in the formation of a heme-protein adduct occurring between heme and an unspecified tyrosine (11.Catalano C.E. Choe Y.S. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10534-10541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additional studies demonstrated that stoichiometric ratios of MbFe3+ and H2O2 resulted in the formation of oxidized heme or iron chlorine products (12.Sugiyama K. Highet R.J. Woods A. Cotter R.J. Osawa Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 796-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Recent advances are being made to identify specific amino acids that may be carrying the stabilized radical (e.g. αTyr-42, βTyr-35, or βTyr-130) and to elucidate the basis of the migration of the radical (13.Svistunenko D.A.

Nitrone-antibody spin trapping of free radicals existing on amino acids of H2O2-reacted Hb have been analyzed with a combined EPR, immunostaining/enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and mass spectrometry approach. Work in this area successfully identified oxidative stress-induced Hb-associated amino acid radicals inside red blood cells (14.He Y.Y. Ramirez D.C. Detweiler C.D. Mason R.P. Chignell C.F. Photochem. Photobiol. 2003; 77: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and on extracellular Hb (αTyr-24, αTyr-42, αHis-20, and βCys-93) treated with H2O2 (15.Deterding L.J. Ramirez D.C. Dubin J.R.

Despite the focused research and development efforts to produce safe and effective HBOCs in recent years, pre-clinical and clinical experiences have revealed adverse oxidative and nitrosative toxicities that need to yet be fully understood (18.Buehler P.W. Alayash A.I. Transfusion (Bethesda). 2004; 44: 1516-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The nitric oxide (NO)-driven oxidation of the heme iron of the oxygenated forms of HBOCs and their uncontrolled rates of spontaneous oxidation (autoxidation) are undesirable characteristics that clearly compromise the use of these Hbs in vivo. Perhaps more importantly, the tendency of some HBOCs to rapidly undergo redox reactions that result in metHb formation and the production of harmful radicals is potentially a starting point for their oxidative toxicity (6.Alayash A.I. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2004; 3: 152-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Unlike previous evaluations of the influence of H2O2 on Hb solutions, we have purposefully used an ultrapurified human Hb (HbA0) to avoid any potential interference by contaminating red cell enzymes (e.g. superoxide dismutase and catalase) on the oxidative chemistry of Hb imparted by H2O2. In this study we have established the amino acids oxidized at stoichiometric and excess additions of H2O2 to HbA0 and confirmed the extent of oxidation. Key amino acids within the β-globin chain appear to be highly susceptible to H2O2 oxidation and at least in part responsible for a loss of α-helical structural integrity surrounding the heme pocket as determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Moreover, we have demonstrated that reproducible covalent cross-linking occurs between α-globin chains because of spontaneous reaction with heme/porphyrin released from H2O2-treated HbA0. The importance of these findings alludes to the potential for significant damage to Hb when local physiological H2O2 is elevated or in the event that Hb-derived blood substitutes may be employed to reestablish perfusion of ischemic tissue. Therefore, oxidative damage to Hb at both the heme and the protein levels may lead to tissue injury, immunogenicity, and potentially alterations in its own plasma clearance. Hemoglobin and Sample Preparation−Highly purified Hb (HbA0; purity >99%) was a kind gift of Hemosol, Inc., Canada, and was stored at -80 °C. The isolation and subsequent extensive purification and functional characteristics of HbA0 were described previously (7.Nagababu E. Rifkind J.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12503-12511Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 19.Adamson J.G. Moore C. Chang T.M. Blood Substitutes: Principles, Methods, Products and Clinical Trials. Vol. 2.

H2O2 in a 30% (w/w) solution was purchased from Sigma. HbA0 solutions were prepared in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at a concentration of 250 μm and treated with H2O2 at concentration ratios of heme to peroxide of 1:0, 1:1, 1:2.5, 1:5, and 1:10 in a total volume of 1 ml at room temperature for 1 h. In some experiments sub-stoichiometric levels of heme to peroxide (e.g. 1:0.1, 1:0.25, and 1:0.5) were used. In all experiments and after reaction, H2O2 was removed from the samples by buffer exchanging five times with equal volumes of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, using 30-kDa cut-off centrifuge tubes (Centricon YM30, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Samples were kept on ice or stored at -80 °C until further analysis. Circular Dichroism−A Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Inc., Easton, MD) was used to evaluate the CD spectra of untreated and H2O2-treated HbA0 in the Soret (350-450 nm) and far-UV (200-250 nm) CD spectrum. CD spectra in the Soret region were obtained using 100 μm HbA0 in 100 mm Hepes buffer, pH 6.85, whereas far-UV region spectra were obtained using 20 μm HbA0 in 50 μm phosphate buffer, pH 7. All measurements were obtained at ambient temperature using a 1-cm path length cell. Reverse Phase-HPLC−For analytical reverse phase (RP)-HPLC analysis, a Zorbax StableBond 300 C3 250 × 4.6-mm column connected with a 12 × 4.6-mm guard column (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) was used in a Waters HPLC system consisting of a Waters 626 pump, Waters 2487 dual-wave-length detector, and a Waters 600s controller installed with Millenium32 software (Waters Corp., Milford, MA). The running solvents A and B were prepared with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid dissolved in water or acetonitrile, respectively. The mobile phase gradient was started with 35% solvent B, increased to 37% solvent B in 5 min, to 40% solvent B in 5 min, and to 43% solvent B in 2 min. The concentration of solvent B was maintained at 43% for next 23 min and then increased to 80% in 5 min. Samples of 10 μl in volume were injected with a mobile phase flow rate set at 1 ml/min at ambient temperature. Absorbance of the eluants was monitored at 280 and 400 nm for protein and heme moieties, respectively, as described previously (12.Sugiyama K. Highet R.J. Woods A. Cotter R.J. Osawa Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 796-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Semi-preparative RP-HPLC was carried out on the same Waters HPLC system with a VyDac Protein C4 10 × 250-mm column (214TP510) and a mobile phase gradient increased from 35% solvent B to 42% in 10 min, to 43% in 30 min, to 44% in 25 min, and to 80% in next 5 min. About 1 μmol of H2O2-treated HbA0 sample in 500 μl was loaded onto the column, and the eluted peaks were collected into fractions at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. Absorbance was monitored at 280 and 400 nm for the presence of protein and heme, respectively, as described previously (12.Sugiyama K. Highet R.J. Woods A. Cotter R.J. Osawa Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 796-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Capillary RP-HPLC was carried out on a Phenomenex Luna 3-μm C18 column (150 × 0.3 mm) using a UMA model 600 system from Michrom BioResources (Auburn, CA) for the fractionation of the enzymatically cleaved HbA0 digest. The gradient of the mobile phase was maintained at 10% solvent B for 5 min and then increased to 50% solvent B in the next 60 min with the flow pumped at a rate of 50 μl/min. The absorbance was monitored at 214 nm for peptides, and the fractions were collected at 2-min intervals with a Spectra/Chrom CF-1 fraction collector (Spectrum Laboratories Inc., Rancho Dominquez, CA). Enzymatic Digestion of Hemoglobin−HbA0 samples from the HPLC fractions were denatured with 6 m urea in 0.5 m ammonium bicarbonate buffer, reduced with 10 μl of 100 mm dithiothreitol at 50 °C for 60 min, and alkylated with 10 μl of 500 mm iodoacetamide for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were reduced and alkylated using dithiothreitol and iodoacetamide followed by the addition of either trypsin (modified sequencing grade; Roche Diagnostics) or endoproteinase Lys-C (sequencing grade; Roche Diagnostics) reconstituted in 1% acetic acid. Digested samples were quenched by adding 10 μl of glacial acetic acid and applied to a capillary RP-HPLC for analysis. Fractions were collected and lyophilized followed by addition of 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid, 0.05% acetic acid prior to LC/MS analysis. Mass Spectrometry Analysis−The analysis of both intact HbA0 and HbA0 digest was performed in the nanospray mode on the QSTAR-XL (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) coupled to an LC Packings capillary HPLC (Dionex, Atlanta. GA) and an LCQ DECA ion trap coupled with the Surveyor capillary HPLC (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) mass spectrometers. Samples were dissolved in 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid, 0.05% acetic acid prior to column injection. A gradient from 0 to 60% trifluoroacetic acid (0.01%), acetic acid (0.05%) in water and trifluoroacetic acid (0.01%), acetic acid (0.05%) in acetonitrile was used for protein or peptide separation using a C18 100-Å column (15 cm × 75 nm; Vydac, Hesperia, CA). Mass Spectrometer Parameter Settings−The QSTAR mass analyzer was optimized with the nano source and operated in positive TOF-MS utilizing the information-dependent acquisition mode. The source parameters were adjusted with the following settings: declustering potential 60 V, focusing potential 250 V, second declustering potential 15 V, collision energy 0 (rolling energy), collision-activated gas pressure 7 p.s.i., ion release decay 6 V, and ion release decay 80.3. Switch criteria were established for ions greater than 150.00 m/z and for ions smaller than 1800.000 m/z with charge state selection set for isolation of +2 and +3 ions. The ion trap was optimized with the nanosource with a spray voltage of 2.2 kV and a heated capillary temperature of 180 °C. Ions were isolated with a mass isolation width (m/z) set at 2.0; AGC mode on; activation Q set at 0.25; activation time, 30 ms; and normalized collision energy set to 35% with a default charge set at +2. Scans were generated in both MS/MS and zoom scan mode of analysis. The tandem mass spectra for all peptide analyses were analyzed using both SEQUEST (ThermoFinnigan) and MASCOT (Matrix Science) algorithms. MS/MS data were further corroborated manually for sequence assignment. Molecular Modeling and Graphics−Model building, energy minimization, and calculations of solvent-accessible surface area (ASA) and molecular volume were all performed with the CHARMM program (21.Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (14019) Google Scholar); the program was also used to prepare the coordinate data for the image files. For the latter, the data were exported as an input file for POV-Ray ray tracing program, and the resulting files combined and hand-edited to produce the images in Fig. 7. The insertion of an added heme into the space between the two α subunits was done in several stages. First, the Protein Data Bank structure 1GZX was imported into CHARMM and energy-minimized with heavy atom restraint forces based on the crystallographic B-factors (1000/B). Next, the heme from the α1 subunit was replicated and translated to the space between residues 128 and 139 of each α subunit. That heme was then rotated around the axis normal to the plane defined by the backbone atoms (N, C-α, and C) of residues 128-139 from both α subunits, and the energy was evaluated in 5° increments. The added heme was rotated to the minimum energy position. The rest of the Hb complex was rigidly constrained, and this configuration was energy-minimized; the constraints preserve the minimized protein coordinates. The constraints were then replaced with the heavy atom restraints, and an additional energy minimization was performed. In all cases, the energy minimization protocol was 50 steps of the steepest descent algorithm, followed by 300 steps of the adopted basis Newton-Raphson algorithm. The ASA calculations used the Lee and Richards algorithm, with a probe radius of 1.6 Å. Fractional ASA for α residues 128-139 was computed with respect to an extended backbone, similar to a β-sheet. Structural Analysis by Circular Dichroism Spectrometry−Structural changes as a result of H2O2 reactivity with HbA0 were monitored in the Soret (350-450 nm) and the far-UV (200-280) regions of the CD spectrum. As shown in Fig. 1A, the integrity of the four heme groups within the α-helices making up each globin chain heme pocket are clearly altered with increasing H2O2 concentrations. The HbA0 Soret band wave-length occurring at 420 nm was shifted to ∼412 nm upon the addition of all concentrations of H2O2 indicating oxidation of iron and possible damage to heme. Increasing the molar concentration of H2O2 from 1- to 10-fold dramatically decreased ellipticity of the HbA0 Soret band as follows: heme:H2O2, 1:1, 9%; 1:2.5, 26%; 1:5, 40%; and 1:10, 70%, indicating the loss of intact heme/porphyrin. When considered in relation to the Soret region CD findings, the data presented in Fig. 1B may suggest a loss of B, C, and E α-helical content consistent with heme pocket collapse following heme/porphyrin loss. This can be tentatively estimated by evaluating changes in the CD far-UV region spectra of HbA0- and H2O2-treated HbA0 at 208 and 222 nm (22.Barrow C.J. Yasuda A. Kenny P.T. Zagorski M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 1075-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 23.Kelly S.M. Jess T.J. Price N.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1751: 119-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar). Comparison of the ellipticity of HbA0 versus HbA0:H2O2 (1:10) at both 208 and 222 nm suggests a 50% loss of the α-helical structure of HbA0, whereas the lesser molar ratios (1:1-1:5) may represent a progression toward loss of heme pocket structure. HPLC Analysis of H2O2-oxidized HbA0−The effects of H2O2 treatment on HbA0 were evaluated using an RP-HPLC method such that the absorbance at 280 and 400 nm was recorded to monitor protein and heme components of HbA0, respectively. The α-globin chains, β-globin chains, and heme moieties of untreated HbA0 were separated into three distinct peaks (Fig. 2A). Under our chromatographic conditions, heme, β-, and α-globin chains eluted at 14.5, 19.2, and 20.5 min, respectively. Chromatograms of HbA0 treated with increasing molar ratios of H2O2 (heme:H2O2, 1:1-1:10) are shown in Fig. 2, B-E. As H2O2 concentrations increased, the β-globin chain exhibited a qualitative loss in peak height. Conversely, the α-globin chain peak position appeared to increase in peak height relative to that of β-globin and was likely to include oxidatively modified species of both α- and β-globin chains and altered hemeprotein products (AHP). In Fig. 2F, a new heme peak (400 nm) eluted at a retention time similar to intact α-and β-globin chains, further indicating the presence of AHP products. These results are consistent with the previous observation that H2O2 induces extensive decomposition of β-globin chains (24.Osawa Y. Darbyshire J.F. Meyer C.A. Alayash A.I. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 46: 2299-2305Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The loss of intact globin chains within HbA0 is readily seen in the CD spectra of HbA0 treated with increasing H2O2 concentrations. LC/MS Analysis of H2O2-treated HbA0−Fig. 3, A-E, shows three-dimensional graphic images of the abundances against both time and m/z generated by the complete LC/MS data set of the intact and H2O2-treated HbA0. Fig. 3A depicts two base peaks derived from the LC/MS data set of the untreated HbA0 corresponding to the β and α subunits. Fig. 3, B-D, shows three-dimensional graphic plots of the LC/MS data set as a result of treatment of the protein with increasing concentrations of H2O2. The additional peaks representing AHPs in the LC/MS data set resulting from increasing H2O2 concentration are observed eluting much later than the β and α subunits. Close inspection of the data reveals that the peak corresponding to the β subunit of HbA0 is more susceptible to chemical and or physical alteration at even low concentrations of H2O2. This finding is evident by the gradual disappearance of the peak corresponding to the β chain with increasing H2O2 concentrations. Specifically, as shown in Fig. 3D, the peaks corresponding to the ionization of both the α and β subunits (Fig. 3A) are not present. The collapse of the multiply charged ionization envelope of both α and β chains shown in Fig. 3, A-D, is suggestive of a substantial conformational change in the HbA0 molecule as a direct result of the H2O2 oxidation. Fig. 4 shows full scan MS spectra and deconvoluted mass spectra of intact and H2O2-treated HbA0. Untreated HbA0 is shown in Fig. 4, A and B, indicating a higher level of ionization resulting from the α subunits when compared with less abundance in the ionization of the β subunits. This finding is consistent with previous reports regarding the observation of less ionization intensity in the β subunits of the HbA0 molecule when subjected to electrospray ionization (25.Mekecha T.T. Amunugama R. McLuckey S.A. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2006; 17: 923-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the data compiled in Fig. 4 reveal a gradual collapse of the multiply charged ion envelope of HbA0 as the H2O2 concentration increases, and this coupled with ion envelope deconvolution profiles demonstrates findings consistent with the data presented in Fig. 3, A-D. Identification of Modified β Chain Amino Acid Residues by LC/MS/MS Analysis−To evaluate the nature and site-specific oxidative modifications induced by H2O2 reactivity, HbA0 treated with a 1-10-fold molar excess of H2O2 was separated into fractions by semi-preparative HPLC (data not shown). The major fractions containing protein and AHP components were subjected to tryptic or endoproteinase Lys-C digestions, and the enzymatic digests were analyzed by LC/MS/MS. Alternatively, the tryptic digests were separated into fractions by HPLC so that individual fractions containing only a few peptides could be analyzed more extensively by LC/MS/MS analysis. The examination of critical amino acid residues in the H2O2-treated HbA0 led to the identification of specific oxidative modifications exclusive to the β-globin chains. Cysteic Acid Formation at βCys-93−LC/MS/MS analysis leading to the identification of βCys-93 oxidation to cysteic acid is described in detail, whereas the extent of oxidation to several other amino acids is summarized partially in the text and in tabular form. The LC/MS/MS spectra analysis resulting from the tryptic peptide containing the βCys-93 peptide was extensively evaluated for modification of the sequence. Fig. 5A shows the TIC of the HPLC-collected tryptic digest fraction containing the βCys-93 peptide at a retention time of 32.85 min. Fig. 5B shows the full scan MS spectra of doubly and triply charged ions corresponding to the modified βCys-93 peptide with a parent mass of 1469.32 [MH]1+. MS/MS analysis of the doubly charged ion at m/z = 735.27 resulted in the product ion collision-induced dissociation spectra shown in Fig. 5C. Identification of the collision-induced dissociation spectra and its resulting b and y series ion fragments conclusively identifies the cysteic acid modification at the βCys-93 residue. The presence of fragments y3 (413.11 Da) and y2 (262.13 Da) effectively localize three oxygen atoms (+48 Da) to βCys-93. Similar findings were observed with molar ratios of heme:H2O2 from 1:1 to 1:10. H2O2 treatment with 1-10 molar additions to HbA0 resulted in nearly identical amino acid oxidation patterns that include βCys-112, βMet-55, and βTrp-15 in addition to βCys-93 shown in Fig. 6, A and B, and summarized versus non-H2O2-treated but digested HbA0 in Table 1. Briefly, oxidation of βCys-112 was similarly deduced from the collision-induced dissociation spectra following MS/MS analysis of the triply charged ion (m/z = 589.9) for the βCys-112 peptide resulting in b and y series product ions consistent with cysteic acid at this residue position. The presence of fragments y9 (1059.45 Da) and y8 (908.46 Da) effectively localized three oxygen atoms (+48 Da) to βCys-112.FIGURE 6A, collision-induced dissociation carried out on the [MH]3+ ion at m/z = 589.9372 of the tryptic peptide at β105-β120 containing Cys-112.

Dreyfuss G. Science. 2002; 298: 1775-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Likewise, assembly of the U7 snRNP is facilitated by a specialized SMN complex that is charged with the unique set of Sm and LSm proteins of this particle (11Pillai R.S. Grimmler M. Meister G. Will C.L. Luhrmann R. Fischer U. Schumperli D. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2321-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). With a sedimentation coefficient of 25-40 S and an estimated molecular mass exceeding 1 megadalton, the SMN complex represents a macromolecular machine of great complexity. So far, nine major proteins termed SMN, Gemins 2-8, and unrip as well as nine Sm/LSm protein “substrates” (i.e. B/B′, D1, D2, D3, E, F, G, LSm10, and LSm11) have been identified as components of this assembly machinery (12Meister G. Eggert C. Fischer U. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 472-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 13Gubitz A.K. Feng W. Dreyfuss G. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 296: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Our knowledge about the architecture of the core SMN complex (i.e. the SMN complex without substrate proteins) is still limited and relies mostly on in vitro interaction assays using recombinant proteins. These studies have placed the SMN protein in the center with interactions to Gemins 2, 3, 5, and 7, as well as substrate Sm proteins. In contrast, other factors such as Gemins 2, 4-6, and 8 and unrip appeared to be peripheral and interact only with few other components of the complex (see Refs. 12Meister G. Eggert C. Fischer U.

The relevance of these interactions in the context of the native SMN complex remained unclear from these studies. To address this issue, we applied a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches (in vitro binding assays, co-immunoprecipitations and a yeast two-hybrid interaction system) to establish a comprehensive interaction map of the SMN complex. Furthermore, by use of a novel assay we were able to reconstitute the SMN complex in reticulocyte lysate. Interestingly, complex formation is severely compromised by an SMA-causing mutation in the SMN protein. Finally, we have assessed the contribution of the peripheral component Gemin5 to the activity of the SMN complex. DNA Constructs—Plasmids encoding full-length cDNAs corresponding to the open reading frames of SMN, unrip, and Gemins 2-7 have been described previously (15Grimmler M. Otter S. Peter C. Muller F. Chari A. Fischer U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 3099-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The full-length open reading frame of Gemin8 was purchased from RZPD (Clone IRAUp969F1069D6) and subcloned into the vectors pGEX6P-1 (GE Healthcare), pET28a (Novagen), and pHA (an N-terminal HA-tag containing derivative of pcDNA3.1; Invitrogen). Recombinant Proteins and in Vitro Protein Binding Assays—Expression and purification of single proteins or protein complexes were performed as described (15Grimmler M. Otter S. Peter C. Muller F. Chari A. Fischer U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 3099-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). [35S]Methionine-labeled proteins were produced using the TNT-T7 quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). In vitro co-translations of the entire SMN complex were carried out in one single TNT reaction with [35S]methionine, using a mixture of vectors encoding for the different SMN complex components. In the case of GST binding assays, in vitro translated proteins were incubated with ∼2 μg of purified GST fusion proteins, immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose (GE Healthcare), and allowed to bind in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 0.01% Igepal, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) at 4 °C for 1 h. After washing the resin extensively, bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 2× SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Coomassie staining and autoradiography of the dried gel. Preparation of HeLa Cell Extract, Antibodies, and Immunoprecipitations—HeLa cytosolic extract was prepared as described (17Grimmler M. Bauer L. Nousiainen M. Korner R. Meister G. Fischer U. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Antibodies against Gemins 5-8 were raised by injection of full-length human proteins into rabbits. Antibodies were affinity purified on columns with the respective covalently linked antigen. Anti-Gemin4 and anti-SmB/B′ were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Immunoprecipitations of the SMN complex were carried out in HeLa cytosolic extract, using a covalently linked 7B10 monoclonal SMN antibody (8Meister G. Buhler D. Pillai R. Lottspeich F. Fischer U. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 945-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Precipitated SMN complex was washed extensively with buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Igepal) of rising ionic strength (150 mm, 250 mm, 750 mm, 500 mm, 1 m, 1.5 m NaCl). Resulting SMN complexes were eluted by 2× SDS buffer and resolved on 8-20% SDS-PAGE gradient gels. For reconstitution of SMN complexes with SmB/D3, an immobilized complex was washed with 1.5 m NaCl high salt buffer and incubated with recombinant SmB/D3 heterodimer, purified as described (18Kambach C. Walke S. Young R. Avis J.M. de la Fortelle E. Raker V.A. Luhrmann R. Li J. Nagai K. Cell. 1999; 96: 375-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). After extensive washing, complexes were eluted by 2× SDS buffer and resolved in 8-20% SDS-PAGE. RNA Interference (RNAi)—Gemin2 levels were reduced by transfection of HeLa cells with two double-stranded 21-nucleotide-long siRNAs (sequences: RNAi-1, 5′-GGAAGCAAAGUGUGAAUAUTT-3′ and RNAi-2, 5′-GCAGCUCAAUGUCCAGAUGTT-3′). siRNAs were purchased from IBA Nucleic Acids Synthesis (Goöttingen, Germany) and transfected with Oligofectamine™ (Invitrogen), following the protocol of the manufacturer. Silencing of Gemin2 was assessed 52 h after transfection by Western blotting of total cell extract, using a monospecific Gemin2 antibody. Immunoprecipitations from these extracts were performed as described above, using extracts normalized for SMN by Western blotting with specific antiserum. Purification of Baculoviral Expressed Gemin5 and in Vitro Assembly of U snRNPs—His-tagged Gemin5 protein was expressed using the MultiBac system (19Berger I. Fitzgerald D.J. Richmond T.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1583-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 5 days post-infection by centrifugation and lysed with detergent (20 mm NaHEPES, 200 mm NaCl, 0.25% Triton X-100, pH 7.5). The clarified lysate was subjected to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid purification, washed, and eluted with imidazole. 60-200 mm imidazole elution fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 0.01% Igepal, and 1 mm dithiothreitol before further use. To analyze the role of Gemin5 in U snRNP assembly, an immunoprecipitated SMN complex in the presence and absence of recombinant SmB/D3 was incubated with 0.75 μg of recombinant Gemin5 in an assembly assay using 32P-labeled U1 snRNA (15Grimmler M. Otter S. Peter C. Muller F. Chari A. Fischer U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 3099-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Sm core formation was assessed by native gel electrophoresis after addition of buffer containing 4 m urea, 12.5 mg/ml heparin, and 16% glycerol as described (8Meister G. Buhler D. Pillai R. Lottspeich F. Fischer U. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 945-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Glycerol Gradient Centrifugation of the in Vitro Reconstituted SMN Complex—In vitro reconstituted, 35S-labeled SMN complexes were diluted with 1× phosphate-buffered saline to a final volume of 250 μl, layered on a 10-30% glycerol gradient, and centrifuged for 16 h in an SW60Ti rotor (4 °C, 24,000 rpm, Beckman Coulter Optima L-80 XP). Gradients were manually harvested in 22 fractions from top to bottom. Yeast Two-hybrid Interaction Trap—All yeast manipulations and the yeast two-hybrid interaction trap assay were carried out as described (20Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar, 21Golemis E.A. Serebriiskii I. Finley R.L. Kolonin M.G. Gyuris J. Brent R. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1999; 4 (21.40, Wiley, New York): 20.21.21-20Google Scholar). In brief, to analyze all possible protein-protein interactions within the SMN complex, the complex components (i.e. SMN, Gemins 2-8, and unrip) were subcloned into pEG202 vector (Clontech), which allows constitutive expression of LexA fusion proteins (DNA-binding domain, bait) and into the galactose inducible vector pJG4-5 to express B42-HA-fusion proteins (activation domain, prey). Plasmids were co-transformed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain EGY48 harboring the reporter plasmid pSH18-34 (Invitrogen). Positive clones were selected by blue staining of colonies on X-gal containing galactose/URA-HIS-TRP- dropout plates. Yeast clones were grown on glucose-containing dropout plates as a control. Interactions of Recombinant SMN Complex Components in Vitro—In a first series of experiments we used GST-tagged recombinant proteins to analyze the interactions with in vitro translated 35S-labeled components of the SMN complex, produced in reticulocyte lysate (Fig. 1A). In our hands, only SMN and Gemins 2 and 6-8 could be produced in Escherichia coli as soluble, full-length proteins, whereas Gemins 3-5 and unrip were degraded and/or misfolded. Robust binding of SMN, Gemins 2, 3, and 8 to immobilized GST-SMN was detected (lane 3), but no significant association of any translated protein was observed to GST alone (lane 2). An identical pattern could be observed when a complex composed of GST-SMN and Gemin2 was used as bait (lane 4), suggesting that Gemin2 binds predominantly to SMN. Consistently, GST-Gemin2 bound SMN only but no other protein of the SMN complex in this assay (lane 5). Next, we analyzed GST-Gemins 6 and 7, which have convincingly been shown to form a heterodimer (13Gubitz A.K. Feng W. Dreyfuss G. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 296: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In agreement with earlier findings, we observed binding of translated Gemin7 to GST-Gemin6 and vice versa (lanes 6 and 7). Whereas Gemin6 appears to bind to no other component, strong binding of Gemin7 to Gemins 2, 6, and 8 and unrip, and weak binding to SMN could be detected (lane 7). In the same assay, GST-Gemin8 bound to SMN as well as Gemin4 (lane 8). In conclusion, this first experimental strategy suggests that Gemin8 links the proteins Gemins 6 and 7 and unrip with the remainder of the SMN complex (see also supplemental Fig. 1 for additional binding assays that support this view). The data obtained from this set of experiments are depicted in Fig. 1B. A Co-immunoprecipitation Strategy Reveals Interactions of Gemins 3, 4, and 5—Three proteins of the SMN complex, namely Gemins 3, 4, and 5 could not be produced in E. coli as full-length proteins in a properly folded manner and in sufficient amounts to perform the experiments described above. Hence, the interactions of these proteins were analyzed by coimmunoprecipitation of co-translated and 35S-labeled components. In a first set of experiments, the interactions of Gemin3 were studied in detail (Fig. 2A). For this, Gemin3 was co-translated with single proteins of the SMN complex, tagged with either an HA-epitope (SMN, Gemins 2, 4, and 6-8 and unrip) or a V5 epitope (Gemin5). The co-translations were then precipitated via the respective tag and analyzed by autoradiography (see lanes 4-11 for inputs). Using this assay, we observed reproducible association of Gemin3 with SMN, Gemins 2, 4, and 5 (lanes 12-15). No other component of the SMN complex was co-precipitated in this experiment, and neither antibody precipitated Gemin3 alone (Fig. 2A, lanes 2, 3, and 16-19), implying specific interactions. Next, binding of Gemin4 with co-translated proteins of the SMN complex was determined by the same strategy (see Fig. 2B, for inputs see lanes 4-11). Only Gemin3 and to a lesser extent Gemin5 could be co-precipitated with Gemin4 (compare lanes 14 and 15 with lanes 12, 13, and 16-19). Finally, V5-tagged Gemin5 was analyzed (Fig. 2C). Weak but reproducible binding was observed to Gemin2 and Gemin4 (lanes 12 and 14), whereas the other components failed to interact in the same assay (lanes 11, 13, and 15-18). To further validate the unexpected interaction between Gemin2 and Gemin5, expression levels of Gemin2 were reduced by RNAi in HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 2E, transfection of two different 21-nucleotide-long siRNA duplices complementary to the Gemin2 mRNA but not a control siRNA reduced Gemin2 protein levels. SMN and Gemin7 levels were unaffected, whereas Gemin5 expression was reduced marginally (Fig. 2E, left panel, compare lane 1 with lanes 2 and 3). Extracts prepared from these cells were then immunoprecipitated with an anti-SMN monoclonal antibody and co-precipitated components detected by Western blotting. Whereas Gemins 2, 5, and 7 could be co-precipitated with SMN from extracts derived from control cells, the association of SMN with Gemin2 and Gemin5 was markedly reduced in the Gemin2 knockdown extracts (by at least 80%), while Gemin7 association was unaltered (Fig. 2E, right panel, compare lane 1 with lanes 2 and 3). These data illustrate that Gemin5 is tethered to the SMN complex predominantly via an interaction with Gemin2 in vivo. This conclusion was further supported by additional co-immunoprecipitation experiments and bacterial co-expression studies with truncation mutants of Gemin5 (supplemental Fig. 2). These confirmed the results obtained so far and further revealed the C-terminal half of Gemin5 (amino acids 721-1508) as the binding site for Gemin2 (supplemental Fig. 2). Analysis of Protein Contacts within the SMN Complex by a Yeast Two-hybrid System—The experiments described above revealed specific interactions of individual SMN complex components to each other in vitro. We next set forth to analyze interactions within the SMN complex in vivo using a yeast two-hybrid assay (20Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar, 21Golemis E.A. Serebriiskii I. Finley R.L. Kolonin M.G. Gyuris J. Brent R. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1999; 4 (21.40, Wiley, New York): 20.21.21-20Google Scholar). For this purpose, a panel of “bait”-vector constructs were created, encoding for fusions of the DNA-binding domain of the transcription factor LexA and either SMN, Gemins 2-8, or unrip (Fig. 3A, lanes 1-9, lane 10 shows the LexA control without a fusion partner). These plasmids were co-transformed with “prey”-vectors encoding for fusions of the activation domain B42 and the same proteins as in the bait vectors (panels a-i, panel j shows the B42 control). Binding of prey to bait fusion proteins was then assessed in a β-galactosidase enzyme assay upon induction of prey fusion expression. Interactions of SMN expressed from the prey-vector are shown in Fig. 3A, panel a. In agreement with earlier data and those shown in Figs. 1 and 2, SMN interacts with itself, Gemin2, Gemin3, and Gemin8 (panel a, lanes 1-3 and 8). Importantly, these interactions can also be observed when SMN is expressed as bait protein (see panels a-c and h, lane 1). The weak β-galactosidase activity observed in yeast co-transformed with SMN and Gemin6 most likely does not reflect a true interaction, as the latter fusion protein is auto-activating (panels a-j, lane 6 and data not shown). In the same system, we also observed binding of Gemin3 with Gemin4 and Gemin7 with Gemins 6 and 8. Furthermore, we could detect novel protein contacts of Gemins 4-8, and Gemin 2-4 as well as Gemin5 (compare panels a-i, lanes 1-9). Note that certain interactions such as SMN and Gemin2 (panel a, lane 2; panel b, lane 1), Gemins 6 and 7 (panel f, lane 7), and SMN oligomerization (panel a, lane 1) can be detected prior to induction, implying very strong binding. Taken together, this strategy supports most data obtained in vitro (summarized in Fig. 3B). However, binding partners of unrip that could readily be detected in vitro were not identified in the yeast system possibly due to misfolding in this host. A Novel Reconstitution System Reveals the Framework of the SMN Complex—The studies described thus far focused on interactions of single, isolated components. We next developed an experimental strategy to address whether the observed interactions also occur in the context of the SMN complex and how they contribute to its overall architecture. To this end, all proteins of the complex, including HA-tagged SMN were simultaneously translated and radiolabeled in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Following immunoprecipitation by anti-HA antibodies, the proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Strikingly, this led to an efficient co-precipitation of Gemins 2-4 and 6-8, whereas no proteins were precipitated from a mixture lacking tagged SMN (Fig. 4A, lanes 8 and 9, the inputs are depicted in lanes 1 and 2). Only Gemin5 and unrip are incorporated less efficiently into the complex and therefore co-precipitate weakly. Thus, a significant proportion of the SMN complex forms when all core components are co-translated. This observation is further supported by gradient centrifugation studies shown in Fig. 5. Co-translated SMN complex components sediment very similar to the endogenous complex (Fig. 5A, lanes 12-22 and data not shown), indicating the formation of a stable entity. In contrast, when SMN is omitted from the co-translation reaction the sedimentation behavior of all Gemins is in a lower molecular weight range (compare Fig. 5, A and B, lanes 12-22; note that lower migrating subcomplexes or single translated proteins can be observed in both translations, Fig. 5, A and B, lanes 2-11). Next, co-translation experiments were performed in the absence of selected single components. Consistent with the in vitro binding assays shown above all other complex components could still be co-immunoprecipitated with HA-SMN when Gemin2 was omitted from the co-translation (Fig. 4A, lane 10). Gemin2 is therefore a peripheral protein that is recruited to the complex predominantly via SMN. In contrast, co-translation in the absence of Gemin3 led to the formation of a complex that also lacked Gemin4 (lane 11), whereas omission of Gemin4 had no effect on the incorporation of the other proteins into the complex (lane 12). These data are consistent with the notion that Gemin3 and 4 interact and associate with the SMN complex predominantly via Gemin3 (22Meister G. Buhler D. Laggerbauer B. Zobawa M. Lottspeich F. Fischer U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1977-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 23Charroux B. Pellizzoni L. Perkinson R.A. Yong J. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1177-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We note, however, a weak but reproducible binding of Gemin4 to the SMN complex in the absence of Gemin3 (lane 11 and data not shown). This may indicate that Gemin4 also associates weakly with another protein, presumably Gemin8 as has been observed in the in vitro binding experiments and in the yeast interaction assay (Figs. 1, 2 and 3). Co-translation in the absence of Gemin7 strongly affected binding of Gemin6 and unrip (Fig. 4A, lane 13), and omission of Gemin8 led to the specific loss of Gemins 6 and 7 and unrip association to the complex (lane 14). These data in conjunction with those in the preceding sections indicate that Gemin8 constitutes the bridge between the Gemin6/Gemin7/unrip trimer and the rest of the SMN complex. These findings are summarized in Fig. 4B (panels a-e).FIGURE 5Analysis of the in vitro translated SMN complexes by gradient centrifugation. All SMN complex components were 35S-labeled and co-translated as His6 fusion proteins together with (A) or without (B) HA-tagged SMN in the TNT reticulocyte lysate system. The reactions were then layered on 10-30% glycerol gradients. Gradients were harvested manually from top to bottom in 22 fractions. A sample of each fraction was analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography of the dried gel (lanes 2-22). 10% input is shown (lane 1).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The neuromuscular disorder SMA is caused by reduced levels of or production of mutant SMN protein. It was therefore interesting to analyze whether pathogenic mutations in SMN would interfere with its incorporation into the complex. To address this, we chose the well characterized C-terminal mutation Y272C that has previously been reported to abolish SMN-oligomerization and Sm protein binding (7Lefebvre S. Burlet P. Liu Q. Bertrandy S. Clermont O. Munnich A. Dreyfuss G. Melki J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar, 24Lorson C.L. Strasswimmer J. Yao J.M. Baleja J.D. Hahnen E. Wirth B. Le T. Burghes A.H. Androphy E.J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 25Pellizzoni L. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11167-11172Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Strikingly, when the Y272C mutant was co-translated with all SMN complex components only Gemin2 could efficiently be co-precipitated, whereas binding to all other components was severely impaired (Fig. 4A, lane 18). Reduced or aberrant formation of the SMN complex may hence be a biochemical defect in patients carrying this and possibly other mutations. An Essential Role for Gemin5 in the Assembly Reaction—The assembly map established above places Gemin5 in the periphery of the complex with an interaction to Gemin2 (and possibly Gemin4). As Gemin5 appears to be unimportant for the integrity of the remaining SMN complex, we reasoned that it might have a functional role in the U snRNP assembly reaction. To explore this possibility, we devised a strategy to generate SMN complexes lacking Gemin5. This was achieved by treatment of immobilized purified human SMN complex with increasing concentrations of NaCl. Although most components of the complex remain stably associated up to 1.5 m salt, SmB/B′, D3, and Gemin5 dissociate almost quantitatively at 500 mm and 1.5 m NaCl, respectively (see Fig. 6A, left panel for a silver-stained gel of the purified complex, right panel for Western blots of the same samples with various antibodies). Native and Gemin5/SmB/D3-depleted SMN complexes were then tested for their ability to promote formation of the Sm core domain on radiolabeled U1 snRNA. Core formation was assessed by native gel electrophoresis. The native SMN complex efficiently promoted the formation of the Sm core domain, as evident by the slower migration of the U1 snRNA in the native gel and further retardation upon addition of the anti-Sm antibody Y12 (Fig. 6C, lanes 2 and 4). Interestingly, the salt-washed complex lacking Gemin5, B/B′, and D3 also promoted the formation of an RNP that could be super-shifted with antibody Y12 (lanes 3 and 5). This Sm-containing RNP most likely corresponds to the subcore particle that has been shown previously to form in vitro when isolated Sm proteins D1, D2, E, F, and G (but not B/B′ and D3) are incubated with U1 snRNA (3Raker V.A. Plessel G. Luhrmann R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2256-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Next, we asked whether Sm core domain formation could be restored upon re-addition of the missing Sm proteins B/B′ and D3. Surprisingly, although a recombinant B/D3 heterooligomer was efficiently bound by the salt washed complex (Fig. 6B, lane 4, indicated by asterisks), no Sm core formation could be observed. Note that the retardation of U1 snRNA in the native gel could not be further increased upon addition of Y12 and hence was not caused by Sm proteins (Fig. 6C, lanes 6 and 8, indicated by an asterisk). Thus, an SMN complex containing the complete set of Sm proteins but lacking Gemin5 can neither promote subcore formation nor Sm core assembly. To address the question whether the functionality of this defective SMN complex could be restored upon re-addition of Gemin5, this protein was expressed in insect cells and purified to homogeneity (supplemental figure 3). Strikingly, addition of recombinant Gemin5 to the assembly mixture partially restored the assembly reaction, as evident by the formation of a complex that could be super-shifted with Y12-antibody (Fig. 6C, lanes 7 and 9). In contrast, upon incorporation of a truncated version consisting of the C-terminal part of the Gemin5 protein, the SMN complex was inactive (Fig. 6 D and E, asterisk indicates unspecific RNA shift). In sum, these data are consistent with the notion that Gemin5 mediates an essential step in the assembly of U snRNPs, most likely in the transfer of Sm proteins onto the U snRNA. The function of the multisubunit SMN complex relies on the ordered interplay of the nine components SMN, Gemins 2-8, and unrip. Previous studies have revealed a great number of interactions among these proteins using various in vitro and in vivo assays (12Meister G. Eggert C. Fischer U.

However, as most interaction assays are error prone, it is not surprising that conflicting data regarding the interactions within the core SMN complex have been obtained. To circumvent this problem, we have delineated an interaction map that relies on several different and independent interaction assays. Only protein contacts that could be observed in at least two independent experimental systems were considered in the construction of an interaction network. Our studies have revealed a framework of the SMN complex with SMN, Gemin7, and Gemin8 as its backbone. These three proteins provide a binding platform for the other components of the complex via multiple interactions: SMN binds to Gemin2 (26Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G.

Whereas most components of the SMN complex form a very stable structure, the peripheral protein Gemin5 can be dissociated upon treatment with high salt. This finding suggests its incorporation into the complex via weak interactions mediated by Gemin2 and possibly Gemin4. Based on data presented here and in previous reports, we are now confident that we understand the architecture of the SMN complex. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that some protein-protein contacts might have escaped our detection or were erroneously excluded based on the stringent criteria described above. In addition, with the availability of the experimental strategies detailed above, we are now in a position to map the binding sites of other peripheral components of the SMN complex. These include substrate Sm/LSm proteins (12Meister G. Eggert C. Fischer U. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 472-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 13Gubitz A.K.

Most cases of SMA are caused by the reduced production of SMN protein. However, some cases of disease are also known, where patients express mutant versions of the protein. The majority of pathogenic mutations (deletions and missense mutations) cluster in the C-terminal domain responsible for SMN oligomerization and/or interaction with Sm proteins (7Lefebvre S.

This effect might be due to the inability of SMN to form oligomers and/or the disability to bind other proteins such as Gemin8, which contacts amino acids 242-294 of SMN, where the missense mutation Y272C is located (see supplemental Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 6). Future studies based on the novel reconstitution assay reported here will be required to resolve the issue whether other pathogenic SMN mutations result in the reduced formation of functional SMN complexes and if this is the underlying cause for the development of the disease SMA in patients. Conflicting data regarding the function of Gemin5 have recently been reported (33Shpargel K.B. Matera A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In two reports RNA interference was used to show that Gemin5 is dispensable for the assembly reaction (33Shpargel K.B. Matera A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In contrast, evidence for an essential role of Gemin5 in the formation of U snRNPs has been provided in another recent report (35Battle D.J. Lau C.K. Wan L. Deng H. Lotti F. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 273-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In this latter study, Gemin5 was shown to bind snRNAs in a sequence specific manner, suggesting its role in the recruitment of these to the SMN complex. Our finding that an SMN complex lacking Gemin5 fails to promote U snRNP assembly is consistent with this notion. However, we do not rule out additional functions of Gemin5 in the assembly reaction such as transfer of Sm proteins onto the U snRNA. The availability of Gemin5 expressed in insect cells will allow us to address these questions. We are grateful to I. Berger, T. J. Richmond, L. Pellizzoni, G. Morris, and F.

https://openalex.org/W2032235027,"Activation of the protease caspase-3 is commonly thought to cause apoptotic cell death. Here, we show that caspase-3 activity is regulated at postsynaptic sites in brain following stimuli associated with memory (neural activation and subsequent response habituation) instead of cell death. In the zebra finch auditory forebrain, the concentration of caspase-3 active sites increases briefly within minutes after exposure to tape-recorded birdsong. With confocal and immunoelectron microscopy, we localize the activated enzyme to dendritic spines. The activated caspase-3 protein is present even in unstimulated brain but bound to an endogenous inhibitor, BIRC4 (xIAP), suggesting a mechanism for rapid release and sequestering at specific synaptic sites. Caspase-3 activity is necessary to consolidate a persistent physiological trace of the song stimulus, as demonstrated using pharmacological interference and the zenk gene habituation assay. Thus, the brain appears to have adapted a core component of cell death machinery to serve a unique role in learning and memory."

The JAK2 mutant displays a much increased kinase activity and generates a PV-like phenotype in mouse bone marrow transplant models. This study shows that the anti-cancer drug erlotinib (Tarceva™) is a potent inhibitor of JAK2V617F activity. In vitro colony culture assays revealed that erlotinib at micro-molar concentrations effectively suppresses the growth and expansion of PV hematopoietic progenitor cells while having little effect on normal cells. Furthermore, JAK2V617F-positive cells from PV patients show greater susceptibility to the inhibitor than their negative counterparts. Similar inhibitory effects were found with the JAK2V617F-positive human erythroleukemia HEL cell line.

This study was initiated to identify an effective inhibitor of the mutated enzyme. Materials—Polyclonal anti-JAK2 and 4G10 monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., respectively. Erlotinib, imatinib mesylate, and gefitinib were purchased from a local pharmacy. Tyrphostin AG490 was purchased from LC Laboratories, and 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexabromocyclohexane (C6H6Br6) was requested from the NCI Developmental Therapeutics Program. Collection of Peripheral Blood and Purification of Human CD34+ Cells—Phlebotomized units of blood were obtained from patients who met the World Health Organization diagnostic criteria for PV and were treated with phlebotomy only. Normal peripheral blood samples were obtained from healthy donors after blood mobilization with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Institutional Review Board approvals have been obtained for the procedures, and each donor was consented. A CD34+ cell population was isolated from low density mononuclear cells of the blood by using the magnetic activated cell sorting CD34+ isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). Colony-forming Cell Assays—CD34+ cells (1000 cells) were cultured in 1 ml of semisolid medium (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) containing α-minimal essential medium, 0.9% methylcellulose, 30% fetal bovine serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.05 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0–50 μm erlotinib supplemented with 2 units/ml EPO alone or a mixture of six growth factors/cytokines (2 units/ml EPO, 100 ng/ml stem cell factor, 10 ng/ml interleukin 3, 100 ng/ml interleukin 6, 10 ng/ml granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and 100 ng/ml thrombopoietin). All cultures were performed in triplicate and various colony types enumerated using an inverted microscope at day 12–14 of culture according to the standard criteria. DNA Extraction and PCR Amplification—Individual hematopoietic cell colonies were taken out from the semisolid phase culture media and diluted into 1 ml of α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After spin down, genomic DNAs were isolated from the pelleted cells by using the Extract-N-Amp™ blood PCR kit from Sigma. The JAK2V617F mutation was detected by using nested allele-specific PCR as described previously (18Xu X. Zhang Q. Luo J. Xing S. Li Q. Krantz S.B. Fu X. Zhao Z.J. Blood. 2007; 109: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Generation of a Protein Substrate for JAK2 Kinase Activity Assays—A peptide fragment with a sequence of PQDKEYYKVKE derived from the autophosphorylation sites of human JAK2 was expressed as a GST fusion protein by using the pGex-2T vector. The fusion protein designated GST-JAKS was expressed in Escherichia coli cells and then purified by using a glutathione-Sepharose column. JAK2 Kinase Activity Assays—COS7 cells were transfected with pCDNA3 constructs carrying JAK2 or JAK2V617F as described previously (10Zhao R. Xing S. Li Z. Fu X. Li Q. Krantz S.B. Zhao Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22788-22792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 25 mm β-glycerophosphate (pH 7.3), 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 m NaCl, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cell extracts and anti-JAK2 immunoprecipitates were used for kinases assays in a buffer system containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mg/ml GST-JAKS. The reactions were allowed to proceed at room temperature for 20 min and then stopped by addition of the SDS gel sample buffer. Tyrosine phosphorylation of GST-JAKS was determined by Western blotting analysis with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Capture of Western blot images and quantification of band signals were carried out by using FluorChem SP imaging system from Alpha Innotech. Development of an Assay for Kinase Activity of JAK2V617F—Wild type JAK2 and the mutant JAK2V617F were expressed in COS7 cells. The overexpressed recombinant proteins were then immunopurified by using a specific anti-JAK2 antibody immobilized onto protein-A beads. Activity assays were carried out with substrate GST-JAKS, a GST fusion protein containing a C-terminal segment of JAK2 where the autophosphorylation sites reside. While JAK2V617F underwent strong autophosphorylation and caused marked phosphorylation of the added substrate, wild type JAK2 showed essentially no activity (Fig. 1, left panel). That GST-JAKS serves as a highly specific substrate for JAK2V617F was further demonstrated by the fact that when the tyrosine kinase activity assays were performed directly with crude cell extracts, only JAK2V617F-transfected cells gave rise to a phosphorylation of the substrate, while cells transfected with the control vector or wild type JAK2 showed no activity (Fig. 1, right panel). Note that tyrosine phosphorylation by JAK2V617F caused a slight mobility shift of GST-JAKS. As expected, the phosphorylation reaction occurred in the JAK2 portion of the fusion protein because GST alone was not phosphorylated (data not shown). The data further demonstrate that JAK2V617F is a hyperactive tyrosine kinase and provide a good assay system to screen for inhibitors of the mutated enzyme. Identification of Erlotinib as a Potent Inhibitor of JAK2V617F—Cell extracts obtained from JAK2V617F-transfected cells were employed to analyze the inhibitory effects of potential inhibitors. Included in our screening were the aforementioned anti-cancer drugs imatinib mesylate, gefitinib, and erlotinib and two other known inhibitors of JAK2, namely, AG490 and 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexabromocyclohexane. AG490, a putative JAK2 and EGFR inhibitor, had been shown to inhibit the growth of PV cells in vitro (8James C. Ugo V. Le Couedic J.P. Staerk J. Delhommeau F. Lacout C. Garcon L. Raslova H. Berger R. Bennaceur-Griscelli A. Villeval J.L. Constantinescu S.N. Casadevall N. Vainchenker W. Nature. 2005; 434: 1144-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (2939) Google Scholar), and 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexabromocyclohexane was recently reported to be a specific JAK2 inhibitor as well (19Sandberg E.M. Ma X. He K. Frank S.J. Ostrov D.A. Sayeski P.P. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 2526-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The data illustrated in Fig. 2 demonstrate that, among these chemicals, erlotinib was by far the most potent inhibitor. It displayed an IC50 value of 4 μm, where IC50 represents the concentration of compounds required to achieve a 50% reduction in the phosphorylation of the exogenous substrate. Imatinib mesylate, gefitinib, and AG490 also showed some inhibitory effects but only at much higher concentrations with IC50 values in submillimolar to millimolar ranges. In contrast, 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexabromocyclohexane exhibited virtually no inhibitory effect on JAK2V617F. We also analyzed the inhibitory effects of erlotinib on wild type JAK2. However, as shown in Fig. 1, JAK2 displayed essentially no kinase activity in comparison with the JAK2V617F mutant when cell extracts or immunoprecipitates were employed for assays. For this reason, we enriched the enzyme from extracts of JAK2-transfected COS7 cells by using a Mono Q anion-exchange column. The JAK2 protein was eluted at around 0.3 m NaCl, and we were able to detect the activity of this partially purified JAK2 by using GST-JAKS as a substrate. As shown in supplemental Fig. S1, JAK2 was also inhibited by erlotinib but with an IC50 value beyond 20 μm. This suggests that the enzyme is less sensitive to the inhibitor. However, the data should not be overinterpreted since the data may only reflect the fact that wild type JAK2 stays in an inactive state. Inhibition of PV Hematopoietic Progenitor Cell Growth by Erlotinib—The effectiveness of erlotinib in inhibiting the growth of JAK2V617F-positive PV hematopoietic progenitor cells was further analyzed with a cell-based system. For this purpose, CD34+ hematopoietic cells from normal and PV blood samples were cultured in a semisolid colony assay medium supplemented with erythropoietin to support the growth of erythroid cells or with a mixture of six growth factors/cytokines to stimulate growth of granulocytes/macrophages and megakaryocyte as well. Fig. 3 shows representative results obtained with one normal blood and two JAK2V617F-positive PV blood samples. Erlotinib effectively inhibited the growth of PV hematopoietic progenitor cells with an IC50 of ∼5 μm, while it hardly affected the growth of normal cells at double that concentration. It should be pointed out that the reported IC50 values of erlotinib for inhibition of the EGF receptor and various mutants were at submicromolar to micromolar according to cell-based assays (20Greulich H. Chen T.H. Feng W. Janne P.A. Alvarez J.V. Zappaterra M. Bulmer S.E. Frank D.A. Hahn W.C. Sellers W.R. Meyerson M. PLoS Med. 2005; 2: 1167-1176Crossref Scopus (578) Google Scholar). In addition, imatinib mesylate, a highly effective drug for treatment of BCR-ABL-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia, inhibited the in vitro growth of BCR-ABL-positive cells with an IC50 value at the submicromolar to micromolar range (21Druker B.J. Tamura S. Buchdunger E. Ohno S. Segal G.M. Fanning S. Zimmermann J. Lydon N.B. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (3167) Google Scholar, 22Deininger M.W. Goldman J.M. Lydon N. Melo J.V. Blood. 1997; 90: 3691-3698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Enhanced Sensitivity of JAK2V617F-positive Cells to Erlotinib—To verify the selectivity of erlotinib toward JAK2V617F-positive cells, genomic DNAs were extracted from hematopoietic cell colonies randomly collected from the culture plates, and then a highly sensitive nested allele-specific PCR method was employed to identify whether these colonies were JAK2V617F positive or not. Representative data are shown in Fig. 4. All the PV samples used were heterogeneous for the JAK2V617F mutation. When cultured in the absence of erlotinib, these cells gave rise to both JAK2V617F-positive and -negative colonies at certain percentages. In the presence of 5 μm erlotinib, percentages of JAK2V617F-positive colonies were significantly reduced while those of the JAK2V617F-negative colonies increased. Each colony theoretically represents a single hematopoietic progenitor cell seeded in the original culture plate. These data thus demonstrate that JAK2V617F-positive hematopoietic progenitor cells were more sensitive to the inhibition by erlotinib than JAK2V617F-negative cells, providing evidence that erlotinib inhibits PV hematopoietic cell growth by acting on JAK2V617F. Inhibition of a JAK2V617F-postive Cell Line by Erlotinib—We also analyzed the effects of erlotinib on the human erythroleukemia HEL cell line, which is known to contain the JAK2V617F mutation (23Quentmeier H. MacLeod R.A. Zaborski M. Drexler H.G. Leukemia. 2006; 20: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Erlotinib effectively inhibited growth of HEL with an IC50 of 2 μm but hardly affected murine erythroleukemia MEL and T cell leukemia Jurkat cells at that concentration (see supplemental Fig. S2). In fact, it took at least 40 μm of erlotinib to achieve a 40% inhibition with the later two cell lines. Our additional studies revealed that JAK2 is intact in MEL cells, while HEL cells contain homozygous JAK2V617F mutation. These results provide further evidence that erlotinib specifically targets JAK2V617F-positive cells. By performing biochemical assays with a highly specific substrate, we have found that erlotinib acts a potent inhibitor of JAK2V617F with an IC50 value of around 4 μm when analyzed in the presence of 0.2 mm ATP. Most importantly, our in vitro cell-based assays demonstrated that erlotinib preferentially inhibited the growth of JAK2V617F-positive PV hematopoietic progenitor cells with an IC50 of around 5 μm. This concentration is at close range of the reported values for inhibition of BCR-ABL-positive cells by imatinib mesylate (21Druker B.J. Tamura S. Buchdunger E. Ohno S. Segal G.M. Fanning S. Zimmermann J. Lydon N.B. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (3167) Google Scholar, 22Deininger M.W. Goldman J.M. Lydon N. Melo J.V. Blood. 1997; 90: 3691-3698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The latter drug has been found to be highly effective for treatment of BCR-ABL-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (2Druker B.J. Talpaz M. Resta D.J. Peng B. Buchdunger E. Ford J.M. Lydon N.B. Kantarjian H. Capdeville R. Ohno-Jones S. Sawyers C.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1031-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (4487) Google Scholar). As a potent inhibitor of JAK2V617F, erlotinib might be useful for the treatment of PV or other myeloproliferative disorders that bear an activation mutation of JAK2. Erlotinib (trade marked Tarceva) is an oral anti-cancer drug developed by OSI Pharmaceuticals, Genentech, and Roche Diagnostics. It is defined as an inhibitor of the EGFR PTK, but our study indicates that it also effectively inhibits JAK2V617F. Although it may also display some inhibitory activity toward wild type JAK2 and other members of the JAK family of tyrosine kinases, we believe that it can selectively inhibit JAK2V617F-positive cells because these cells have become “addicted” to the hyperactivity of the mutated enzyme. Such a phenomenon has been well demonstrated with imatinib mesylate, which selectively suppresses the growth of BCR-Abl-positive cells, although it also inhibits Abl and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor family of PTKs in vitro (2Druker B.J. Talpaz M. Resta D.J. Peng B. Buchdunger E. Ford J.M. Lydon N.B. Kantarjian H. Capdeville R. Ohno-Jones S. Sawyers C.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1031-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (4487) Google Scholar). Erlotinib has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer and, in combination with gemcitabine, for the treatment of locally advanced, inoperable or metastatic pancreatic cancer. It has a well established safety profile. The most common side effects in patients with non-small cell lung cancer receiving erlotinib monotherapy are mild to moderate rash and diarrhea. Considering its effectiveness in inhibiting JAK2V617F activity and JAK2V617F-positive PV cell growth, clinical trials of erlotinib for the treatment of PV and other related diseases appears to be well warranted. So far, there is no effective cure for the diseases. Our study also included another EGFR inhibitor, namely, gefitinib, but this drug was found to be poorly effective. Likewise, AG490 and imatinib mesylate were found to be only moderate inhibitors of JAK2V617F despite the fact that previous studies had shown that both AG490 and imatinib mesylate inhibited autonomous erythropoiesis of PV cells in vitro (8James C. Ugo V. Le Couedic J.P. Staerk J. Delhommeau F. Lacout C. Garcon L. Raslova H. Berger R. Bennaceur-Griscelli A. Villeval J.L. Constantinescu S.N. Casadevall N. Vainchenker W.

Blood. 2003; 102: 2240-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), an effect possibly attributable to their inhibition of the JAK2V617F activity. Imatinib mesylate at a concentration of 1 μm suppressed autonomous erythroid burst-forming unit growth in the absence of growth factors with a mean inhibition of 73% (24Oehler L. Jaeger E. Eser A. Sillaber C. Gisslinger H. Geissler K. Blood. 2003; 102: 2240-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Without a defined molecular target, this drug has been used in investigational treatment of PV and was shown to reduce phlebotomy requirements in polycythemia vera patients (25Silver R.T. Leukemia. 2003; 17: 1186-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Although imatinib mesylate-treated patients remained positive for JAK2V617F, there was a significant reduction in the percentage of mutant alleles that correlated with hematologic responses (26Jones A.V. Silver R.T. Waghorn K. Curtis C. Kreil S. Zoi K. Hochhaus A. Oscier D. Metzgeroth G. Lengfelder E. Reiter A. Chase A.J. Cross N.C. Blood. 2006; 107: 3339-3341Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We believe that erlotinib should be a more promising drug than AG490 and imatinib mesylate for the treatment of PV patients because: (a) it is a much more potent and selective inhibitor of JAK2V617F and (b) it inhibits growth of PV cells even in the presence of optimal concentrations of growth factors and cytokines. By analyzing the structures of the JAK2 kinase domain and existing tyrosine kinase inhibitors, we should be able to modify erlotinib to produce more potent and selective JAK2 inhibitors, which should serve as more effective drugs to treat diseases associated with the JAK2V617F mutation.

These activities are mainly mediated by the VEGFR2 receptor tyrosine kinase that upon stimulation, promotes the activation of numerous proteins including phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, Src, and ERK1/2. However, the VEGFR2-proximal signaling events leading to the activation of these targets remain ill defined. We have identified the Gab1 adapter as a novel tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in VEGF-stimulated cells. In bovine aortic endothelial cells, Gab1 associates with VEGFR2, Grb2, PI3K, SHP2, Shc, and PLCγ, and its overexpression enhances VEGF-dependent cell migration. Importantly, silencing of Gab1 using small interfering RNAs leads to the impaired activation of PLCγ, ERK1/2, Src, and Akt; blocks VEGF-induced endothelial cell migration; and perturbs actin reorganization and capillary formation. In addition, co-expression of VEGFR2 with Gab1 mutants unable to bind SHP2 or PI3K in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and bovine aortic endothelial cells mimics the defects observed in Gab1-depleted cells. Our work thus identifies Gab1 as a novel critical regulatory component of endothelial cell migration and capillary formation and reveals its key role in the activation of VEGF-evoked signaling pathways required for angiogenesis.

Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from preexisting vasculature, is a highly regulated process that is essential for the development of multicellular organisms (1Risau W.

Loss of this tight regulation, resulting in uncontrolled and excessive neovascularization, contributes to the development of many pathologies, including retinopathies, rheumatoid arthritis, and tumor growth (2Carmeliet P.

Rev. 2004; 25: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (2984) Google Scholar). At the cellular level, VEGF stimulation drives multiple responses including endothelial cell proliferation, migration, survival, and permeability (7Ferrara N. Clauss M. Breier G. Mechanisms of Angiogenesis, Birkhaöuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland. 94. 2005: 209-231Google Scholar, 11Zachary I. Clauss M. Breier G.

Recent reports however suggest that increased permeability is not required per se for normal or tumor-associated angiogenesis, but that it is essential for tumor cells to metastasize (13Eliceiri B.P.

Blood. 2005; 105: 1508-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). VEGF binds to two distinct receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), VEGFR1 (Flt-1) and VEGFR2 (KDR/Flk-1), but numerous studies suggest that VEGFR2 is the main receptor conveying the mitogenic, chemotactic, and survival effects of VEGF in endothelial cells (12Zachary I. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 1171-1177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Shibuya M. Claesson-Welsh L. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 549-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). VEGFR2 is composed of an extracellular domain containing seven immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular kinase domain typical of the PDGF receptor subclass family of RTKs (15Shibuya M. Claesson-Welsh L. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 549-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 16Yarden Y. Ullrich A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 443-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar). Following VEGF binding, VEGFR2 undergoes conformational changes leading to autophosphorylation on several sites, including Tyr1054 and Tyr1059 in the activation loop, Tyr951 and Tyr996 in the kinase insert domain, and Tyr1175 and Tyr1214 in the C terminus tail (17Takahashi T.

Accordingly, mutagenesis studies have demonstrated that phosphorylation of Tyr1175 of VEGFR2 is required for the activation of PLCγ and ERK1/2 and for endothelial cell proliferation (17Takahashi T. Yamaguchi S. Chida K. Shibuya M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2768-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 26Sakurai Y. Ohgimoto K. Kataoka Y. Yoshida N. Shibuya M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1076-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Recent work has further demonstrated that signaling downstream of this tyrosine residue is essential for vasculogenesis (26Sakurai Y. Ohgimoto K. Kataoka Y. Yoshida N. Shibuya M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1076-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In some circumstances, ERK1/2 activity also correlates with the stimulation of cell migration (27Eliceiri B.P. Klemke R. Stroömblad S. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1255-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). On the other hand, PI3K is mainly involved in the promotion of endothelial cell migration and cell survival, through AKT and AKT-dependent phosphorylation of eNOS (28Gerber H.P. MdMurtrey A.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 258-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). However, despite these and many other cellular targets identified so far, the VEGFR2-proximal signaling events involved in cell migration and proliferation in response to VEGF stimulation are not fully understood. Recent evidence has revealed that many signaling molecules are recruited to growth factor- or cytokine-activated receptors via scaffolding/adapter proteins, such as Gab1 (Grb2-associated binder-1), Gab2, and Gab3 (32Gu H. Neel B.G. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 122-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 33Liu Y. Rohrschneider L.R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 515: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Gab1, which is the most characterized in nonhematopoietic cells, was first identified as a Grb2-associated protein downstream of EGF and insulin-mediated signaling involved in cell growth and transformation (34Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) and as a direct Met/HGF receptor-interacting protein involved in epithelial morphogenesis (35Weidner K.M. Di Cesare S. Sachs M. Brinkmann V. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 384: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Gab1 encompasses a pleckstrin homology domain that mediates its interaction with specific membrane lipids (phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate derived from PI3K activity) (36Maroun C.R. Moscatello D.K. Naujokas M.A. Holgado-Madruga M. Wong A.J. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31719-31726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It also contains a large number of tyrosines and proline-rich regions that allow its interaction with the Src homology 2 and 3 domains of signaling molecules, including Grb2, PI3K, PLCγ, and SHP2 (32Gu H. Neel B.G. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 122-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 33Liu Y. Rohrschneider L.R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 515: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Following receptor activation, Gab1 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated and acts as a docking center for the assembly of multiprotein complexes. Thus, the diverse signaling pathways and biological activities induced downstream of various receptors might in part rely on the receptor’s ability to signal to specific adapter proteins in a time- and space-defined fashion. Gab1 has been described as a critical activator of the PI3K/Akt and SHP2/ERK1/2 pathways in many cell systems and has been shown to play important roles in several biological processes promoted by RTKs, including cell survival, differentiation, and morphogenesis (32Gu H. Neel B.G. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 122-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 33Liu Y. Rohrschneider L.R.

In particular, Gab1 has been shown to mediate HGF-induced PI3K and ERK1/2 activation as well as tubule formation following HGF stimulation of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells grown in collagen gels (39Maroun C.R. Holgado-Madruga M. Royal I. Naujokas M.A. Fournier T.M. Wong A.J. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1784-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 40Maroun C.M.

Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1419-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Given the critical role played by the PI3K and ERK1/2 pathways in VEGF-evoked angiogenic responses, we postulated that Gab1 could be involved in the mediation of VEGF-dependent biochemical and biological events. Here, we show that Gab1 associates with VEGFR2 and proteins previously reported to be activated in response to VEGF stimulation of endothelial cells. We also provide evidence that Gab1 acts as a VEGFR2-proximal signaling center and promotes the optimal activation of the PLCγ, ERK1/2, Src, and Akt pathways shown to be essential for the angiogenic responses of endothelial cells. Consistent with these findings, our data reveal a critical role for Gab1 in VEGF-dependent endothelial cell migration, actin reorganization, and capillary formation.

The sequence of the overlapping oligonucleotides used was 5′-GACGAGAGGGTCGACTTCGTTGTGGTGG-3′ in the sense and antisense orientation. The mutated nucleotides are underlined; the first two are silent mutations that generate a novel SalI restriction site. The Gab1ΔGrb2 (Δ341–348/P518A/R522A) mutant was generated by deleting and mutating the two proline-rich sequences previously shown to bind Grb2, GBS2 and GBS1 (Grb2-binding sequences 2 and 1), respectively (41Schaeper U.

The sequence of the oligonucleotides used to generate the GBS2 mutant (deletion of amino acids 341–348) was the following: 5′-CACCATTCCTGACATCCATCCAACTCATGAC-3′. The underlined nucleotide is a silent mutation that eliminates an EcoRV restriction site. The GBS1 mutations (P518A/R522A) were sequentially generated on the GBS2 mutant using two sets of oligonucleotides overlapping the following sequences: 5′-CTGACTGTGAACCAGCGCCGGTGGATAGGAAC-3′ (encompassing the P518A mutation) and 5′-CCAGCGCCGGTGGATGCGAACCTCAAGCCAGAC-3 (encompassing the P518A and R522A mutations). The P518A and R522A mutations generate new HaeII and BstF5I restriction sites, respectively. The pCR3-KDR (VEGFR2), pRK5-Flt1 (VEGFR1), and pCDNA3-Grb2 cDNA constructs were generously provided by Cam Patterson (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC), Jean-Philippe Gratton (Clinical Research Institute of Montreal), and Mounib Elchebly (University of Montreal), respectively. Construction of the Chimeric CSF-VEGFR2 Expression Vector—The full-length cDNA of human VEGFR2 was used as a template to generate the VEGFR2 transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain by PCR. PCR primers were designed to generate a new XhoI site at the 5′ end and XbaI site at the 3′ end. The upper primer (5′-GACGAACCTCGAGATCATTATTCTAGTAGG-3′) corresponds to nucleotides 2583–2612, and the lower primer (5′-TTGGGGTCTAGATCGATCCTTTTAAACAGGA-3′) is complementary to nucleotides 4365–4395 in the VEGFR2 sequence. To create a new XhoI site, nucleotides +2590 T, +2592 G, and +2595 A were converted to nucleotides C, C, and G, respectively, in the upper primer. This conversion does not lead to modification of the VEGFR2 amino acid sequence. To create a new XbaI site, the nucleotides outside of the VEGFR2 coding sequence, +4386 C and +4388 C, were converted to T and G, respectively, in the lower primer. The VEGFR2 PCR product was digested with XhoI and XbaI and cloned into the adenovirus transfer vector pShuttle-CMV (Qbiogene). The full-length cDNA of human CSF-1R (a kind gift of Martine Roussel, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, Memphis, TN) was used as a template to generate the extracellular domain of CSF-1R by PCR. PCR primers were designed to generate a new NotI site at the 5′ end and XhoI site at the 3′ end. The upper primer (5′-ACCTGGCGGCCGCTTCCCCACCGAGG-3′) corresponds to nucleotides –273 to –298, and the lower primer (5′-TGAAGAGGAACTCGAGCGGGGGATGCGTGTG-3′) is complementary to nucleotides +1816 to +1846 in the CSF-1R sequence. To create a new NotI site, nucleotides –278 C, –280 T, and –284 A in the CSF-1R sequence were all converted to G in the upper primer. To create a new XhoI site, nucleotides +1831 G, +1832 A, and +1833 T were converted to C, T, and T, respectively, thus causing a substitution of amino acid Asp511 to Leu511 in the CSF-1R. The CSF-1R PCR product and the adenovirus transfer vector pShuttle-CMV encompassing the VEGFR2 PCR product were both digested with NotI and XhoI and ligated together to generate the chimeric CSF-VEGFR2 expression vector (pSCMV.CSF-VEGFR2). DNA Transfection, Cell Stimulation, and Lysis—BAECs were plated (1.5 × 106 cells/100-mm dish; Falcon) and transfected 24 h later with 6 μg of plasmid DNA using Lipofectin (6 μl/μg of DNA) in serum-free DMEM low glucose according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (Invitrogen). The cells were washed the next day, and fresh medium was added for another 24 h, at which time the cells were trypsinized and used in a migration assay. For growth factor stimulation of BAECs, 5.4 × 105 cells/100-mm dish were grown for 3 days and then serum-starved (DMEM plus gentamycin) for 16 h. Cells were next incubated with VEGF (50 ng/ml) at 37 °C for the indicated times, washed, and incubated in PBS containing sodium vanadate (1 mm) for 30 min on ice. Cells were next lysed in 1 ml of buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 5 mm sodium fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin (Roche Applied Science). HEK 293 cells (9 × 105 to 1 × 106) were plated and transfected 24 h later with 10 μg of VEGFR2 or VEGFR1 cDNA plasmid and 5 μg of either empty vector (pCDNA 1.1) or Gab1 plasmids using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (44Wigler M. Pellicer A. Silverstein S. Axel R. Urlaub G. Chasin L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1373-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). For experiments with Grb2, 5 μg of cDNA construct were transfected in all conditions. The medium was changed the next morning, and the cells were serum-starved at night for another 16 h, after which time the cells were stimulated with VEGF as described above. siRNA Transfections—HMVECs (5.8 × 105) were seeded in 60-mm dishes the day before transfection. Pools of four nontargeting, control siRNAs and four specific Gab1 siRNAs (Smart Pools) were purchased from Upstate/Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). siRNA transfections (100 nm final concentration) were performed in DMEM high glucose using Targefect reagents according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (Targeting Systems Inc., Santee, CA). After a 2-h incubation, cells were rinsed twice in DMEM and then incubated in complete EBM-2 (supplemented with the EGM-2-MV bullet kit) for an additional 48 h. Next, cells were either starved in EBM for 6 h and processed for biochemical analysis or subjected to the migration and capillary formation assays as described. For rescue experiments, cells were electroporated with both siRNA and cDNA using the Nucleofector system from Amaxa Biosystems according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Briefly, HMVECs (1 × 106) were suspended in 100 μl of prewarmed nucleofection solution for microvascular cells (HMVEC-L) containing 23.3 μl of siRNAs (the amount equivalent to a concentration of 100 nm for a 60-mm dish) and 3 μg of plasmid DNA. Immediately following nucleofection, 500 μl of prewarmed complete EBM-2 was added to the cells, which were then transferred to 60-mm dishes containing 2.5 ml of the same prewarmed medium. Twelve hours later, medium was replaced (8 ml/60 mm), and cells were further incubated up to 48 h after nucleofection, at which time they were trypsinized and subjected to a migration assay. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—BAEC lysates (1–2 mg for co-immunoprecipitation experiments) and HEK 293 cell lysates (0.75–1 mg) were incubated with antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C (or overnight for co-precipitations), followed by incubation with 25 μl of a 50% (v/v) slurry of protein A- or protein G-conjugated Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for an additional 2–4 h. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and then denatured in 1× Laemmli sample buffer (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins or total protein extracts (40–50 μg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose Hybond ECL membranes (Amersham Biosciences), and blocked in 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2.5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h (or according to the recommended protocol for the phospho-specific antibodies). Proteins were detected by Western blotting with the appropriate antibodies and HRP-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), HRP-conjugated protein A (Amersham Biosciences), or HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (for anti-Ser(P)473AKT antibody; Cell Signaling) using the ECL detection kit according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (Amersham Biosciences). Migration Assay—Forty-eight hours after transfection or electroporation, BAECs or HMVECs (1 × 105 in 200 μl of serum-free low glucose DMEM) were seeded on Transwell filters (polycarbonate membrane, 8-μm pore size; Corning Brand, Fisher) precoated with 0.2% (w/v) gelatin (overnight at 4 °C) and inserted in 24-well plates. After a 30-min incubation (for BAECs only), VEGF (10 ng/ml), FGF (10 ng/ml), EGF (10 ng/ml), or HGF (10 ng/ml) were added to the lower chamber containing 800 μl of the same medium for 3 h (BAECs plus VEGF), 6 h (BAECs plus other growth factors), or 16 h (HMVECs). At the end of the assay, cells were fixed with phosphate-buffered formalin for 20 min and stained with crystal violet (0.1% in 20% (v/v) methanol) for a minimum of 60 min. Cells remaining on the upper surface of the filter were wiped off, and those that had migrated through the filter pores were visualized and counted (a minimum of 6 fields/insert at ×40 magnification). Proliferation Assay—Thirty hours after transfection of control and Gab1 siRNAs, HMVECs (7.5 × 104) were seeded in 24-well plates and incubated for 10 h in EBM-2 supplemented with the EGM-2-MV bullet kit. The cells were next rinsed twice in PBS (t = 0) and then incubated with or without VEGF (10 ng/ml) for 42 h (t = 1) in EBM containing 1% fetal bovine serum. Cell counts were determined using a hemacytometer at t = 0 and t = 1. In Vitro Angiogenesis Assay—Capillary tube formation by endothelial cells grown between layers of fibrin gels was evaluated using a “fibrin gel in vitro angiogenesis” assay kit (Chemicon International). Briefly, HMVECs (7 × 104 cells/well of a 24-well plate) were seeded on the first layer of fibrin gel (generated by mixing fibrinogen with thrombin) and incubated overnight in fully complemented EBM-2 medium. The medium was next aspirated, and a second layer of gel was overlaid on the apical surface of the cells and allowed to polymerize before basal EBM containing VEGF (10 ng/ml) was added to each well. Capillaries were photographed after 12 h of incubation using a Leica DM IL microscope (magnification of ×10) and a Leica DFC 320 camera. Total capillary tube length was measured in arbitrary units in two view fi"
https://openalex.org/W2151274072,"In cat visual cortex, we investigated with parallel recordings from multiple units the neuronal correlates of perceived brightness. The perceived brightness of a center grating was changed by varying the orientation or the relative spatial phase of a surrounding grating. Brightness enhancement by orientation contrast is associated with an increase of discharge rates of responses to the center grating but not with changes in spike synchronization. In contrast, if brightness enhancement is induced by phase offset, discharge rates are unchanged but synchronization increases between neurons responding to the center grating. The changes in synchronization correlate well with changes in perceived brightness that were assessed in parallel in human subjects using the same stimuli. These results indicate that in cerebral cortex the modulation of synchronicity of responses is used as a mechanism complementary to rate changes to enhance the saliency of neuronal responses."

Channel opening normally requires ATP binding to both nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), probable dimerization of the two NBDs, and phosphorylation of the R domain.

Loss-of-function mutations in the CFTR gene cause cystic fibrosis; thus, there is considerable interest in compounds that improve mutant CFTR function. Here we investigated the mechanism by which CFTR is activated by curcumin, a natural compound found in turmeric. Curcumin opened CFTR channels by a novel mechanism that required neither ATP nor the second nucleotide-binding domain (NBD2). Consequently, this compound potently activated CF mutant channels that are defective for the normal ATP-dependent mode of gating (e.g. G551D and W1282X), including channels that lack NBD2.

The CFTR chloride channel regulates salt and water transport across epithelial tissues (1.Frizzell R.A. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1995; 151: S54-S58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Smith A.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 1251-1254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). CFTR is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily (3.Hyde S.C. Emsley P. Hartshorn M.J. Mimmack M.M. Gileadi U. Pearce S.R. Gallagher M.P. Gill D.R. Hubbard R.E. Higgins C.F. Nature. 1990; 346: 312-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar) based on its general domain structure that includes two transmembrane domains (which form the pore) and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBD1 and NBD2, which bind and hydrolyze ATP). CFTR also has a large centrally localized regulatory domain (R domain) that is a special feature of this ABC transporter. The R domain has many sites for phosphorylation by cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases, which are the main physiologic activators of this channel (4.Mathews C.J. Tabcharani J.A. Chang X.B. Jensen T.J. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. J. Physiol. 1998; 508: 365-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). CFTR channel opening typically requires both kinase-mediated phosphorylation of the R domain and ATP binding to both NBDs (reviewed in Refs. 5.Sheppard D.N. Welsh M.J. Physiol.

Regarding the role of ATP in promoting channel opening, the available evidence supports a model in which two ATP molecules bind in pockets at an interface between the two NBDs (i.e. at the interface of an NBD1-NBD2 dimer) (7.Kidd J.F.

This model is based in part on structural and functional information that has been obtained for other ABC transporters (notably bacterial transporters (9.Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C.

Nucleotide-dependent dimerization of the NBDs has been proposed to drive conformational rearrangements of the translocation pathway (e.g. by a “tweezers-like” mechanism (11.Chen J. Lu G. Lin J.

How phosphorylation of the R domain controls CFTR channel opening is less clear. Phosphorylation appears to have little effect on nucleotide interactions with the NBDs as assayed by photolabeling the NBDs with azido-ATP analogs (12.Aleksandrov L. Aleksandrov A.A. Chang X.-B.

Physiol. 2003; 122: 333-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it has been proposed that phosphorylation controls a gating step downstream of ATP binding (13.Basso C. Vergani P. Nairn A.C. Gadsby D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 333-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, this view point is not universally accepted. Vais et al. (14.Vais H. Zhang R. Reenstra W.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C737-C745Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) have proposed that ATP binding to the NBDs is enhanced by phosphorylation of the R domain based on the results of a mutational analysis of the R domain. The focus of this study is on the mechanism by which curcumin, a dietary compound found in turmeric, activates wild type and mutant CFTR channels. Curcumin was reported originally by Egan et al. (15.Egan M.E. Pearson M. Weiner S.A. Rajendran V. Rubin D. Glockner-Pagel J. Canny S. Du K. Lukacs G.L. Caplan M.J. Science. 2004; 304: 600-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar) to enhance the synthesis and cell surface delivery of the most common CF mutant channel, ΔF508-CFTR, a processing mutant that normally is exported from the endoplasmic reticulum with very low efficiency (16.Cheng S.H.

The extent to which curcumin enhances ΔF508-CFTR processing is controversial, i.e. this biochemical effect could not be reproduced in several other laboratories (17.Song Y. Sonawane N.D. Salinos D.

(15.Egan M.E. Pearson M. Weiner S.A. Rajendran V. Rubin D. Glockner-Pagel J. Canny S. Du K. Lukacs G.L. Caplan M.J.

Li G. Clancy J.P. Kirk K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23622-23630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and Berger et al. (20.Berger A.L. Randak C.O. Ostedgaard L.S.

Here we show that curcumin promotes CFTR channel activity by a novel mechanism that is independent of ATP binding and dimerization of the two NBDs. This compound strongly activates mutant CFTR channels that are defective for ATP binding and/or NBD heterodimerization including channels that lack all of NBD2. CFTR constructs that are robustly activated by curcumin include two of the more common CF mutants, G551D (mutation in NBD1 (21.Gregory R.J. Rich D.P. Cheng S.H. Souza D.W. Paul S. Manavalan P. Anderson M.P. Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 3886-3893Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar)) and W1282X (nonsense mutation deleting most of NBD2 (22.Quint A. Lerer I. Sagi M. Abeliovich D. Am. J. Med. Genet. A. 2005; 136: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)). The mode of curcumin activation is interesting in several ways including a strong dependence on prior phosphorylation of the R domain by protein kinase A. The requirement for phosphorylation but not ATP binding or NBD2 provides good functional evidence that phosphorylation of the R domain can regulate CFTR channel opening without affecting nucleotide binding or the dimerization of the two NBDs. Our results indicate that curcumin is a useful functional probe of CFTR gating, which strongly activates mutant channels that otherwise cannot be opened by the normal ATP-dependent mode of gating. DNA Constructs, Cell Culture, and Transfections−Human wild type (WT) CFTR and the tested mutants were subcloned into the pCDNA3 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen) unless otherwise indicated. Point mutants and deletion constructs (e.g. Δ1198-CFTR) were generated by PCR mutagenesis using appropriate mutagenic oligonucleotides and verified by DNA sequencing of the entire PCR product. The ΔR/S660A-CFTR mutant was provided by M. Welsh (University of Iowa) (23.Rich D.P. Gregory R.J. Anderson M.P. Manavalan P. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Science. 1991; 253: 205-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), subcloned into the pCDNA3 vector, and truncated by PCR mutagenesis to make Δ1198/ΔR/S660A-CFTR. HEK-293T cells were transiently transfected with WT or mutant CFTR cDNA using the Lipofectamine transfection kit following the manufacturer’s recommendations (Invitrogen). HEK-293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 mm penicillin-streptomycin. HeLa cells stably transfected with W1282X-CFTR were provided by J. P. Clancy at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. The cells were grown on plastic coverslips for patch clamp recording and were used 1–3 days after transfection. Patch Clamp Analysis and Curcumin−Macroscopic and single channel currents were recorded in the excised, inside-out configuration. Patch pipettes were pulled from Corning 8161 glass to tip resistances of 1–2 mΩ (macroscopic recordings) or 9–12 mΩ (unitary current recording). CFTR channels were activated following patch excision by exposure of the cytoplasmic face of the patch to catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA; 110 units/ml; Promega) and MgATP (1.5 mm). CFTR currents were recorded in symmetrical solution containing 140 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine-Cl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm TES (pH 7.3). Macroscopic currents were evoked using a ramp protocol from +80 to -80 mV with a 10-s time period, unless otherwise indicated. The patches were held at ± 40 or 60 mV for unitary current recordings. All of the patch clamp experiments were performed at 21–23 °C. Signals from macroscopic and single channel recordings were filtered at 20 and 200 Hz, respectively. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using pCLAMP8 and pCLAMP9 software (Axon Instruments). The averaged data are presented as the means ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were made by performing unpaired t tests unless otherwise indicated. The curcumin preparation used for most patch clamp experiments was purchased from Sigma (catalog number C7727; >94% curcuminoid content with >80% curcumin; the rest primarily desmethoxycurcumin). Identical results were obtained using a different preparation from Fluka (also purchased through Sigma; catalog number 28260; >95% curcuminoid content). Cell Surface Biotinylation, Immunoprecipitations, and Immunoblotting−CFTR cDNAs were transfected in HEK 293T cells seeded in 100-mm dishes according to the Lipofectamine 2000 protocol (Invitrogen). Cell surface proteins were biotinylated using EZ-Link® Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce) 48 h after transfection. Briefly, the cells were rinsed three times with PBS containing 1 mm MgCl2 plus 0.1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, and rinsed once with PBS, pH 8.0. The cells were then incubated 30 min at 4 °C with EZ-Link® Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (1 mg/ml) in PBS (pH 8.0) or with PBS only (control experiment). After the biotinylation step the excess biotin was neutralized by incubating cells for 10 min at 4 °C with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Biotinylated cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 in PBS supplemented with protease inhibitors (complete, EDTA-free; Roche Applied Science) (1 ml/dish). The cells were scraped in lysis buffer and kept on ice for 1 h to achieve cell lysis. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation (14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C), and the total protein content of the supernatant was determined (MicroBCA protein assay kit; Pierce). Part of each sample (8.5 mg of total proteins) was incubated with streptavidin beads (streptavidin-agarose; Novagen) and part (850 μg of total proteins) with a monoclonal antibody directed against the CFTR amino-terminal tail (monoclonal antibody 3482; Chemicon) cross-linked to A/G-agarose beads (Protein A/G Plus-Agarose; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Streptavidin pulldowns and immunoprecipitations were carried out overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then rinsed three times with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and proteins were eluted by a 30-min incubation at 37 °C with reducing Laemmli buffer (50 mm dithiothreitol, 1.2% β-mercaptoethanol). After a quick centrifugation (1 min, 3500 rpm), proteins in the supernatants were resolved by SDS-PAGE analysis on a 4–15% acrylamide gel (Criterion gel; Bio-Rad) and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P transfer membranes; Millipore). The blots were successively incubated 1 h at room temperature with blocking buffer (5% milk in Tris (25 mm)-buffered saline (TBS)) followed by an overnight incubation at 4 °C with a monoclonal antibody directed against the CFTR R-domain (monoclonal antibody 1660; R&D Systems) diluted at 1:1000 in 4% milk with TBS plus 133 mm glucose, 0.4% Tween 20, and 8% glycerol. After extensive washing steps in TBS plus 0.2% Tween 20, each blot was incubated 1 h at room temperature with a goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (ImmunoPure® antibody; Pierce) diluted at 1:10,000 in the same solution used for the primary antibody. Following extensive washing in TBS plus 0.2% Tween 20, each blot was incubated 5 min with the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) and then exposed using HXR film (Hawkins X-Ray Supply). ATP-independent Activation of G551D-CFTR and Wild Type CFTR Channels by Curcumin−In a previous study we observed that the G551D regulation mutant is resistant to activation by a class of CFTR agonist that strongly activates ΔF508-CFTR and wild type channels (5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid (NPPB) analogs; Ref. 19.Wang W. Li G. Clancy J.P. Kirk K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23622-23630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). G551D-CFTR channels normally exhibit very low single channel open probabilities (Po) because this mutation disrupts the ABC signature sequence in NBD1, which lines the ATP-binding pocket at the NBD dimer interface in other ABC transporters (9.Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar, 10.Smith P.C. Karpowich N. Millen L. Moody J.E. Rosen J. Thomas P.J. Hunt J.F. Mol.

Cell. 2003; 12: 651-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows that G551D-CFTR channels are strongly stimulated by curcumin. Depicted is a typical macroscopic current record for a macropatch that was excised from a transfected HEK-293T cell. The cytosolic face of the patch was bathed in a solution that contained normally saturating concentrations of MgATP (1.5 mm) and PKA catalytic subunit (110 units/ml; see “Materials and Methods” and Fig. 1 legend for details). PKA inhibitory peptide was added at the first arrow to prevent continued phosphorylation of the channels (and to rule out an effect of the compound on channel phosphorylation). As noted previously, the neutral NPPB derivative (NPPB-AM) only weakly activates G551D-CFTR channels at a dose that maximally activates the wild type channel (10 μm; Ref. 19.Wang W. Li G. Clancy J.P. Kirk K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23622-23630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Conversely, curcumin exhibited a strong and dose-dependent activation of the G551D-CFTR currents (see also single channel data in Fig. 3). The activation by curcumin could be largely reversed by washing the curcumin from the bath if the time of exposure was shorter than 5 min (see below for discussion of persistent effects of curcumin). The gradual deactivation kinetics were presumably because of slow “off rates” for curcumin; for comparison, washing ATP from the bath rapidly deactivated wild type channels (Fig. 1C)). Identical results were obtained with two different curcumin preparations (see “Materials and Methods”).FIGURE 3Curcumin activates CFTR mutants primarily by increasing channel opening rates. Unitary currents were recorded at ±60 mV across micropatches obtained using small tip pipettes (see “Materials and Methods”). A, G551D-CFTR. B, Δ1198-CFTR.

All of the records are representative of at least three experiments except D and E (n = 2 each).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because the G551D-CFTR mutant is strongly disrupted for the normal ATP-dependent mode of channel gating, we tested whether curcumin also could activate this mutant in the absence of bath ATP. Fig. 1B shows that curcumin strongly stimulates G551D-CFTR currents after removing bath ATP and by adding hexokinase/glucose to enzymatically eliminate residual ATP. (In pilot experiments we observed that this dose of hexokinase/glucose completely inhibited WT-CFTR currents in the presence of 1.5 mm MgATP within 30 s). We also tested the effects of curcumin on wild type channels in the absence of bath ATP (Fig. 1C). Here the activation by curcumin was apparently more modest than that observed for the NBD1 mutant, but nonetheless, a reproducible activation by curcumin was observed in the absence of ATP. The WT-CFTR currents that were activated by curcumin in the absence of bath ATP approached 10–15% of the maximal currents achieved in the presence of saturating concentrations of PKA and ATP. Thus, both wild type channels and G551D-CFTR channels can be activated by curcumin under these conditions. The preceding results indicate that curcumin can activate wild type or mutant channels under conditions in which the normal ATP-dependent mode of gating is disrupted. To explore this point more fully we determined whether wild type channels that had been oxidized by a mixture of glutathione and diamide (strong thiol oxidizer) also could be activated by curcumin. Previously we determined that this mixture inactivates CFTR channels by oxidizing (apparently by glutathionylation) a cysteine near the ABC signature sequence in NBD2 (Cys-1344 (25.Wang W. Oliva C. Li G. Holmgen A. Lillig C.H. Kirk K.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 127-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar)). This modification disrupts channel gating, possibly by inhibiting ATP binding to NBD2 or the heterodimerization of the two NBDs. Fig. 1D shows that channels that have been oxidized in this way are strongly and reversibly stimulated by curcumin. The return of the current to near base-line levels following the removal of curcumin by bath perfusion rules out an antioxidant effect of this compound to reverse the covalent modification at NBD2 by diamide/GSH. For comparison, the subsequent addition of dithiothreitol also activated the current, but this effect could not be reversed by washing the reducing agent from the bath. Curcumin Activates CFTR Channels That Lack NBD2−The finding that curcumin promotes the opening of G551D-CFTR channels and wild type channels in the absence of ATP raised the possibility that this compound acts at a step downstream of ATP binding and possibly NBD dimerization. To explore this point further, we determined whether curcumin also activates CFTR channels that lack all or part of NBD2. To our initial surprise we found that CFTR channels that lack the entire NBD2 as well as the COOH-terminal tail (Δ1198-CFTR) express at high levels in HEK-293T cells where they localize to the cell surface as efficiently as wild type or G551D-CFTR channels (see schematic of constructs in Fig. 2A and surface biotinylation results in Fig. 2B). (Most CFTR deletion constructs are processing mutants that are exported inefficiently from the ER, including NBD1 deletion constructs (16.Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W.

Not surprisingly, Δ1198-CFTR channels exhibit very low (but detectable) activity in excised membrane patches irrespective of the presence or absence of ATP (see also single channel records in Fig. 3). Like for G551D-CFTR channels, however, the currents mediated by Δ1198-CFTR are markedly stimulated by curcumin (Fig. 2C). The EC50 for Δ1198-CFTR activation by curcumin was ∼20 μm, as determined in a series of titration experiments. (Fig. 2E). This stimulatory effect of curcumin was specific in that Δ1198-CFTR channels were negligibly activated by equivalent doses of two other compounds that activate wild type and ΔF508-CFTR channels, i.e. NPPB-AM (see also Fig. 1) and genistein (26.Wang F. Zeltwanger S. Yang I.C. Nairn A.C. Hwang T.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), or by a “half-curcumin” derivative, 4-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-3-buten-2-one (results not shown). The activation of Δ1198-CFTR channels by curcumin did not require bath ATP; in fact, ATP substantially reduced the curcumin response for this construct (see Fig. 4 and W1282X-CFTR below).FIGURE 4ATP inhibits Δ1198-CFTR channel activation by curcumin. A, bath ATP inhibits Δ1198-CFTR channel activation by curcumin either when present before curcumin addition (1.5 mm ATP) or when added during the initial, reversible phase of curcumin activation. B, 10 mm ATP markedly limits initial Δ1198-CFTR channel activation by curcumin but has no effect on the persistent currents that develop during prolonged exposure to curcumin. C, ATP inhibition of curcumin-activated Δ1198-CFTR currents can be partially reversed by increasing the bath curcumin concentration. D, bath ATP does not inhibit A462F/Δ1198-CFTR channels. E, mean data comparing the effects of bath ATP (1.5 mm) on Δ1198-CFTR (n = 16) and A462F/Δ1198-CFTR (n = 10) activation by 30 μm curcumin. The asterisks denote p < 0.001 for comparison between plus and minus ATP for Δ1198-CFTR (unpaired t test). Note that the absolute currents mediated by A462F/Δ1198-CFTR are lower because the A462F mutation partially disrupts ER processing and cell surface localization (33.Berger A.L. Ikuma M. Welsh M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).3 All of the records are representative of at least three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 2C provides a good example of another interesting feature of the stimulatory effect of curcumin; namely, the irreversible activation that develops during longer exposures (>5 min) to this compound. The magnitude of the persistently activated currents that remained following washout of 30 μm curcumin (25 min of exposure) was 52 ± 3% (n = 5) of the peak current that was measured prior to perfusing the compound from the bath. This feature was not unique to the activation of Δ1198-CFTR currents, i.e. persistently activated currents were observed for every CFTR construct that was tested including G551D and wild type CFTR (e.g. Fig. 1A). Conceivably, this persistent effect of curcumin is related to its reported ability to covalently react with nucleophilic amino acids in proteins (Refs. 27.Fang J. Lu J. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25284-25290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 28.Shiraki T. Kamiya N. Shiki S. Kodama T.S. Kakizuka A. Jingami H. J. Biol.

Because the Δ1198-CFTR construct is new to the CFTR field, we validated that the currents that are mediated by this construct are authentic CFTR currents in two ways: (i) by performing unitary currents recordings, which confirmed that this NBD2 deletion construct exhibits the appropriate single channel conductance (6–8 pS) and linear I-V behavior expected for CFTR channels (Fig. 3) (5.Sheppard D.N. Welsh M.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S23-S45Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 6.Gadsby D.C. Nairn A.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 577-607Crossref Scopus (369) Google Scholar) and (ii) by introducing a point mutation (K95E) in this deletion construct that had been shown by Linsdell (30.Linsdell P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8945-8950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) to induce strong outward rectification of the currents mediated by the full-length channel. Fig. 2D shows that the currents mediated by K95E/Δ1198-CFTR exhibit strong outward rectification, as expected, and that these rectifying currents are robustly activated by curcumin. We next determined whether W1282X-CFTR channels also can be activated by curcumin. W1282X is a fairly common nonsense mutation in certain CF populations including A"

The close homolog of L1 (CHL1, also referred to as CALL) is a cell adhesion molecule of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily.

Weinberger D.R. Schizophrenia genes, gene expression, and neuropathology: on the matter of their convergence.Mol. Psychiatry. 2005; 10: 40-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1626) Google Scholar). Although these findings suggest that CHL1 regulates synapse functioning, the role of CHL1 in the organization of the synaptic machinery has not been fully analyzed. The 70 kDa heat shock cognate protein (Hsc70) is a constitutively expressed member of the heat shock-inducible Hsp70 protein family. These proteins possess ATPase activity and perform numerous functions in cells, among which are protein folding and sorting, signal transduction, and apoptosis. Hsc70 also catalyzes, in vitro and in vivo, the release of clathrin from clathrin-coated vesicles as the final step of receptor-mediated endocytosis (Newmyer and Schmid, 2001Newmyer S.L. Schmid S.L. Dominant-interfering Hsc70 mutants disrupt multiple stages of the clathrin-coated vesicle cycle in vivo.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 607-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). A similar function is attributed to Hsc70 in synapses, where Hsc70 regulates uncoating of synaptic vesicles (SVs) in the clathrin-dependent recycling pathway (Zinsmaier and Bronk, 2001Zinsmaier K.E. Bronk P. Molecular chaperones and the regulation of neurotransmitter exocytosis.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 62: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In this pathway, following SV fusion, the SV membrane is endocytosed via formation of clathrin-coated pits on the synaptic plasma membrane, resulting in formation of clathrin-coated synaptic vesicles (CCSVs) (Takei et al., 1996Takei K. Mundigl O. Daniell L. De Camilli P. The synaptic vesicle cycle: a single vesicle budding step involving clathrin and dynamin.J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1237-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, Shupliakov et al., 1997Shupliakov O. Low P. Grabs D. Gad H. Chen H. David C. Takei K. De Camilli P. Brodin L. Synaptic vesicle endocytosis impaired by disruption of dynamin-SH3 domain interactions.Science. 1997; 276: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). During CCSV uncoating, Hsc70 co-operates with other proteins that target or regulate the activity of Hsc70, such as auxilin, which binds to Hsc70 in the presence of ATP and increases the activity of Hsc70 in CCSV uncoating (Morgan et al., 2001Morgan J.R. Prasad K. Jin S. Augustine G.J. Lafer E.M. Uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles in presynaptic terminals: roles for Hsc70 and auxilin.Neuron. 2001; 32: 289-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that Hsc70 binds to the intracellular domain of CHL1 and that this interaction is potentiated by ADP. CHL1 accumulates in the presynaptic plasma membrane, and there it recruits Hsc70 in an ADP-dependent manner. In response to synapse activation, CHL1 is targeted to SVs by endocytosis. CHL1 deficiency causes a reduction in levels of Hsc70 on SVs and leads to reduced clathrin release from CCSVs and reduced uptake and release of FM dyes in synaptic boutons. These observations suggest a role for CHL1 in regulating SV recycling via a clathrin-dependent pathway. To identify binding partners of the CHL1 intracellular domain (CHL1-ID), soluble protein fraction from adult mouse brain was used for two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis, after which proteins were either transferred to nitrocellulose membrane or subjected to silver staining. Blotted membranes were then incubated with recombinant CHL1-ID, and binding of CHL1-ID to proteins immobilized in the nitrocellulose membrane was analyzed. The most prominent binding was observed in the 70 kDa area at a slightly acidic isoelectric point of approximately 5.5 (Figure 1A). The corresponding spot in silver-stained gels was isolated and subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) analysis, which identified heat shock cognate Hsc70. To confirm this finding, nitrocellulose membranes used for the overlay experiments were stripped and reprobed with antibodies against Hsc70, which indeed bound to the area overlapping with the spot containing the binding partner of CHL1-ID (Figure 1A). For comparison, antibodies against Hsp70 were used, which revealed a 70 kDa spot with the more basic isoelectric point of 5.8. To analyze whether CHL1 associates with Hsc70 in brain tissue of adult mice, CHL1 was immunoprecipitated from brain lysates and immunoprecipitates were probed with antibodies against Hsc70. Approximately 20% of all Hsc70 coimmunoprecipitated with CHL1, suggesting that the observed interaction is physiologically relevant (Figure 1B). Analysis of the CHL1-ID amino acid sequence revealed an HPD tripeptide that had been identified in other proteins as a binding site for Hsp70 proteins (Figure 1C). This conserved HPD motif is present in the J domains of DnaJ-like proteins, which are co-chaperones of Hsp70 proteins that bind to Hsp70 proteins to induce their ATPase activity. A single mutation of any amino acid in the HPD tripeptide blocks the interaction between DnaJ and Hsp70 proteins, indicating that the HPD motif is crucial for this interaction (Tsai and Douglas, 1996Tsai J. Douglas M.G. A conserved HPD sequence of the J-domain is necessary for YDJ1 stimulation of Hsp70 ATPase activity at a site distinct from substrate binding.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9347-9354Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, Chamberlain and Burgoyne, 1997Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. The molecular chaperone function of the secretory vesicle cysteine string proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31420-31426Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Both mouse and human CHL1 sequences contain the HPD tripeptide, whereas it is not present in the intracellular domain of L1. To analyze the role of the HPD tripeptide in CHL1/Hsc70 complex formation, wild-type full-length CHL1, or full-length variants of CHL1 with the single amino acid mutation within the HPD tripeptide CHL1H1121Q (histidine exchanged to glutamine) or CHL1D1123A (aspartic acid exchanged to alanine), were transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and assayed by coimmunoprecipitation for their ability to associate with endogenously expressed Hsc70. Whereas Hsc70 coimmunoprecipitated with wild-type CHL1, it did not coimmunoprecipitate with any CHL1 variant mutated in the HPD tripeptide (Figure 1D), indicating that the HPD tripeptide is essential for the binding of Hsc70 to CHL1. Furthermore, when brain lysates were incubated with an HPD tripeptide-containing 20-mer peptide derived from the CHL1-ID sequence (HPDpeptideCHL1) and subsequently subjected to immunoprecipitation with CHL1 antibodies, Hsc70 did not coimmunoprecipitate (Figure 1E), indicating that the HPD tripeptide-containing peptide competed with endogenous CHL1 for binding to Hsc70. By contrast, preincubation with a similar peptide in which the histidine was exchanged to glutamine within the HPD tripeptide (QPDpeptideCHL1) did not affect the complex formation between CHL1 and Hsc70. Thus, the HPD tripeptide is essential for CHL1/Hsc70 complex formation in brain tissue. To investigate the possibility that CHL1 is involved in the regulation of synapse functions, we analyzed the subcellular distribution of CHL1 (Figure 2A). CHL1 was enriched in synaptosomes; the level of CHL1 was approximately six times higher in synaptosomes when compared with brain homogenates. At the subsynaptic level, CHL1 was particularly enriched in the synaptic plasma membrane. Unexpectedly, we also detected CHL1 in the crude SV fraction. In both the synaptic plasma membrane and SV fractions, CHL1 cofractionated with Hsc70. In cultured hippocampal neurons labeled with antibodies against CHL1 without permeabilization of the plasma membrane with detergent, CHL1 immunolabeling was localized to thin neurites negative for the dendritic marker MAP2 and positive for the axonal marker L1 (see Figure S1A in the Supplemental Data), indicating that CHL1 is enriched in the axonal plasma membrane. After permeabilization of neurons with detergent, intracellular CHL1 was also detected in the somata of neurons and, to a lesser extent, in their dendrites (Figure S1B). In accordance with the biochemical data, plasma membrane-associated CHL1 was highly expressed in presynaptic terminals visualized with antibodies against the SV protein SV2. In presynaptic terminals, CHL1 colocalized with Hsc70 (Figure 2B). CHL1 was detectable in both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, as indicated by apposition of CHL1 accumulations to the clusters of postsynaptic proteins of excitatory and inhibitory synapses (PSD95 and gephyrin, respectively), and by accumulation of CHL1 in synaptic boutons either positive or negative for GAD65, a presynaptic marker of inhibitory synapses (Figures 2C–2E). Cell adhesion molecules accumulated in synapses have been shown to anchor associated proteins at these sites (Sytnyk et al., 2004Sytnyk V. Leshchyns'ka I. Dityatev A. Schachner M. Trans-Golgi network delivery of synaptic proteins in synaptogenesis.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, Gerrow and El-Husseini, 2006Gerrow K. El-Husseini A. Cell adhesion molecules at the synapse.Front. Biosci. 2006; 11: 2400-2419Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To analyze levels of Hsc70 in presynaptic boutons, we labeled permeabilized cultured hippocampal neurons with Hsc70 antibody. Neurons were colabeled with synaptophysin antibody to identify presynaptic boutons, which were then graphically outlined to determine Hsc70 levels within the synaptophysin accumulations. Indeed, Hsc70 levels in synaptophysin accumulations were reduced in neurons derived from CHL1-deficient (CHL1−/−) mice (Figure 3A). Hsc70 levels were also reduced in synaptosomes isolated from CHL1−/− brains (Figure 3B), indicating that CHL1 is involved in targeting of Hsc70 to synapses. Interestingly, Hsc70 mRNA and protein levels were slightly increased in CHL1−/− brain homogenates (Figure 3B and Figure S3), probably reflecting a compensatory reaction to inefficient targeting of the protein to synapses. This observation excludes the possibility that reduced levels of Hsc70 in synaptosomes reflect an overall decreased expression of Hsc70 in CHL1−/− brains. Levels of the SV protein synaptophysin were the same in presynaptic boutons of cultured neurons and synaptosomes from both wild-type (CHL1+/+) and CHL1−/− mice (Figures 3A and 3B), showing that overall targeting of SVs was not affected in CHL1−/− brains. To analyze the effect of CHL1 on the subcellular localization of Hsc70 in detail, we cotransfected cultured CHL1−/− neurons with wild-type CHL1 or the tripeptide mutation CHL1H1121Q together with Hsc70 tagged with green fluorescent protein (Hsc70GFP). Transfected full-length CHL1 showed a distribution similar to endogenous CHL1 expressed by CHL1+/+ neurons; it was enriched in axons and SV2 antibody-labeled synaptic boutons (Figure 3C). In CHL1−/− neurons cotransfected with Hsc70GFP and the empty pcDNA3 vector, Hsc70GFP was still targeted to SV2 positive synaptic boutons. This finding indicates that cues other than CHL1 can recruit Hsc70 to synapses. Interestingly, levels of CSP, an SV-associated protein that directly binds to Hsc70, were 2-fold higher in CHL1−/− brain homogenates and synaptosomes (Figure S2), correlating with increased mRNA levels of CSP in CHL1−/− brains (Figure S3). Thus, Hsc70 may be recruited to CHL1−/− synapses by CSP. However, cotransfection with wild-type full-length CHL1 significantly enhanced the precision and degree of Hsc70GFP accumulation in synapses as determined by the ratio of Hsc70GFP levels in the center of SV2 clusters to the Hsc70 levels in the axon 3 μm away from the cluster center (Hsc70syn./Hsc70adj.). This ratio was two times higher in CHL1 cotransfected neurons (Figure 3C). In contrast to transfection with CHL1, transfection with the CHL1H1121Q mutant did not enhance targeting of Hsc70GFP to SV2 positive synaptic boutons, showing that the interaction between the HPD tripeptide of CHL1 and Hsc70 plays a crucial role in CHL1-mediated recruitment of Hsc70 to synapses. Interestingly, Hsc70 and CHL1 were present in both the synaptic plasma membrane and the SV fractions (Figure 2A), raising the possibility that CHL1 recruits Hsc70 to these subsynaptic compartments. Since interactions of Hsc70 with its binding partners are often regulated by nucleotides, changes in ATP/ADP concentration may provide an additional level of regulation. Thus, we tested whether ATP or ADP influence CHL1/Hsc70 complex formation. Amounts of Hsc70 that coimmunoprecipitated with CHL1 from brain lysates were approximately 4-fold higher in the presence of ADP than in the absence of nucleotides (Figure 4A), indicating that complex formation is enhanced by ADP. Interestingly, ATP reduced the efficiency of CHL1/Hsc70 complex formation to the level below the level observed in the absence of nucleotides. To analyze the role of CHL1 and nucleotides in the recruitment of Hsc70 to the plasma membrane, synaptic plasma membrane fractions were isolated from synaptosomes of CHL1+/+ and CHL1−/− brains. These fractions were then assayed for their ability to recruit Hsc70 from the soluble fraction of CHL1+/+ brain homogenates used as a source of endogenous Hsc70 (Figure 4B). Before incubation with the soluble fraction, peripheral proteins in the isolated synaptic membranes were stripped by alkaline treatment to remove Hsc70 that may have been copurified. Incubation with the soluble fraction resulted in the binding of Hsc70 to CHL1+/+, but not to CHL1−/−, synaptic plasma membranes, indicating that CHL1 is required to recruit Hsc70 to synaptic plasma membranes. Efficiency of the binding was approximately three times higher in the presence of ADP when compared with the binding process without nucleotides, whereas addition of ATP abolished the binding. To analyze the role of CHL1 in SVs, SVs were purified by fractionation of the crude SV fractions from CHL1+/+ and CHL1−/− brains through a linear sucrose gradient followed by SV immunoisolation with the synaptophysin antibodies (Figure 4C). Purified SVs were strongly enriched in synaptophysin and were negative for the marker of the plasma membrane Na,K-ATPase and the early endosome associated protein EEA1 (not shown). Purified SVs from CHL1+/+ brains contained CHL1, as revealed by immunoblot analysis (Figure 4C). Levels of Hsc70 were significantly decreased in CHL1−/− SVs compared with CHL1+/+ SVs (Figure 4C), indicating that CHL1 recruits Hsc70 to SVs. As a next step we tried to investigate the mechanisms that target CHL1 to SVs. As a transmembrane protein, CHL1 can be delivered to synapses in trans-Golgi network-derived organelles, which are then transformed to SVs (Hannah et al., 1999Hannah M.J. Schmidt A.A. Huttner W.B.

However, considering the high levels of CHL1 in the synaptic plasma membrane (Figure 2A), a more potent pathway for CHL1 accumulation in SVs could be its endocytosis during SV recycling. To test the latter possibility, we analyzed the sites of CHL1 endocytosis and recycling in cultured hippocampal neurons by visualizing CHL1-mediated uptake of cell surface bound CHL1 antibodies to intracellular organelles (Carroll et al., 1999Carroll R.C. Beattie E.C. Xia H. Luscher C. Altschuler Y. Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. von Zastrow M. Dynamin-dependent endocytosis of ionotropic glutamate receptors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 14112-14117Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). CHL1 antibodies were applied to live cultured neurons in culture medium, and neurons were then allowed to incorporate CHL1 antibodies either at resting conditions in the presence of nominal 4 mM K+ or in the presence of 47 mM K+ applied to stimulate exo- and endocytosis of SVs by depolarizing neuronal plasma membranes and inducing Ca2+ influx (Virmani et al., 2003Virmani T. Han W. Liu X. Sudhof T.C. Kavalali E.T. Synaptotagmin 7 splice variants differentially regulate synaptic vesicle recycling.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5347-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Antibodies bound to CHL1 at the cell surface were then removed by exposure to 0.5 M NaCl/0.2 M acetic acid, a procedure that did not result in abnormal swelling or degeneration of cells (not shown). Following permeabilization of neurons with detergent, internalized CHL1/CHL1 antibody complexes, resistant to acid stripping, were detected with fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies (Figure 4D; Carroll et al., 1999Carroll R.C. Beattie E.C. Xia H. Luscher C. Altschuler Y. Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. von Zastrow M. Dynamin-dependent endocytosis of ionotropic glutamate receptors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 14112-14117Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Colabeling with SV2 antibodies showed that the major sites of CHL1 antibody uptake colocalized with SV2 accumulations (Figure 4D). CHL1 was endocytosed to synaptic boutons even at resting conditions, probably due to antibody induced cross-linking of CHL1 at the cell surface, followed by internalization and/or basal synaptic activity in cultures. However, stimulation with high K+ enhanced CHL1 endocytosis to synaptic boutons: levels of CHL1 antibody internalized to SV2 positive synaptic boutons of neurons stimulated by high K+ were approximately two times higher than those of nonstimulated neurons (Figure 4D). To analyze the mechanisms by which CHL1 is endocytosed in synaptic boutons, we investigated whether CHL1 is present in CCSVs representing structural intermediates in the clathrin-dependent SV recycling pathway. Immunoblot analysis of the CCSVs isolated from brain tissue (Maycox et al., 1992Maycox P.R. Link E. Reetz A. Morris S.A. Jahn R. Clathrin-coated vesicles in nervous tissue are involved primarily in synaptic vesicle recycling.J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1379-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) showed that CCSVs contained CHL1 (Figure 4E). Clathrin coimmunoprecipitated with CHL1 from brain lysates, and the CHL1/clathrin complex formation was potentiated by ADP and inhibited by ATP in a manner similar to the regulation of the CHL1/Hsc70 complex (Figure 4A). Endocytosed CHL1 immunoreactive structures often appeared aside the major synaptic vesicle cluster labeled with antibodies against SV2 (Figure 4D), as has been reported before for CCSVs (Bloom et al., 2003Bloom O. Evergren E. Tomilin N. Kjaerulff O. Low P. Brodin L. Pieribone V.A. Greengard P. Shupliakov O. Colocalization of synapsin and actin during synaptic vesicle recycling.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The combined observations indicate that CHL1 is endocytosed via a clathrin-dependent pathway to be targeted to SVs in response to synapse activation. In neurons and nonneuronal cells, Hsc70 is the major ATPase mediating clathrin uncoating from clathrin-coated vesicles (Newmyer and Schmid, 2001Newmyer S.L. Schmid S.L. Dominant-interfering Hsc70 mutants disrupt multiple stages of the clathrin-coated vesicle cycle in vivo.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 607-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In synapses, Hsc70 uncoates clathrin from SVs recycling via a clathrin-dependent pathway (Zinsmaier and Bronk, 2001Zinsmaier K.E. Bronk P. Molecular chaperones and the regulation of neurotransmitter exocytosis.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 62: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, Morgan et al., 2001Morgan J.R. Prasad K. Jin S.

Uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles in presynaptic terminals: roles for Hsc70 and auxilin.Neuron. 2001; 32: 289-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether abnormalities in subcellular distribution of Hsc70 in CHL1−/− brains may affect levels of clathrin expression. Indeed, the intensity of clathrin labeling measured in synaptophysin clusters was slightly increased in cultured CHL1−/− versus CHL1+/+ neurons (Figure 5A). Protein and mRNA levels of clathrin were also higher in CHL1−/− brain homogenates (Figure 5B and Figure S3) and levels of clathrin protein were increased in CHL1−/− synaptosomes and purified SVs (Figures 5B and 5C), suggesting that CHL1 is important for clathrin uncoating from SVs. To assess the role of CHL1 in clathrin release from SVs, we isolated CCSVs from CHL1+/+ and CHL1−/− brains (Maycox et al., 1992Maycox P.R. Link E. Reetz A. Morris S.A. Jahn R. Clathrin-coated vesicles in nervous tissue are involved primarily in synaptic vesicle recycling.J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1379-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) and analyzed the rate of clathrin release from CCSVs in response to application of an ATP-regenerating cocktail. The extent of CCSV uncoating was assayed by following the transfer of the clathrin heavy chain from the pellet to the supernatant after centrifuge sedimentation of the vesicles (Chang et al., 2002Chang H.C. Newmyer S.L. Hull M.J. Ebersold M. Schmid S.L. Mellman I. Hsc70 is required for endocytosis and clathrin function in Drosophila.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). ATP-regenerating cocktail induced rapid clathrin uncoating from CHL1+/+ CCSVs, resulting in the release of 70%–100% of clathrin within 3–15 min (Figure 6), indicating that Hsc70, which copurifies with CHL1+/+ SVs (Figure 2A), was sufficient for clathrin release from these vesicles in the presence of ATP. In contrast, clathrin release from CHL1−/− CCSVs was severely impaired, resulting in the release of only 10% of all clathrin after 15 min of buffer application (Figure 6). A similarly impaired clathrin release was also observed when CHL1+/+ CCSVs were preincubated with recombinant CHL1-ID or HPDpeptideCHL1, thus inducing competition between endogenous CHL1 in SVs and recombinant CHL1-ID or HPDpeptideCHL1 for peripheral proteins associated with vesicles, including Hsc70 (Figure 6). In contrast, QPDpeptideCHL1 did not affect clathrin uncoating, indicating that the HPD motif is essential for CHL1-regulated clathrin release. Preincubation of CCSVs with two other binding partners of Hsc70, recombinant CSP (Tobaben et al., 2001Tobaben S. Thakur P. Fernandez-Chacon R. Sudhof T.C. Rettig J. Stahl B. A trimeric protein complex functions as a synaptic chaperone machine.Neuron. 2001; 31: 987-999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) or BAG-1 (Takayama et al., 1999Takayama S.

These observations suggest that TSP-1 represents an important link between diabetes, hyperglycemia, and accelerated atherogenesis. A large number of clinical studies and trials have conclusively identified hyperglycemia as an independent risk factor for development of both micro- and macrovascular complications (30Nathan D.M.

Recently, the Epidemiology of Diabetes Intervention and Complications study reported that, as compared with conventional therapy, intensive glycemic control reduced the risk of the most serious cardiovascular events such as heart attacks, stroke, and death by nearly 60%. These findings clearly underscore the importance of hyperglycemia as a critical player in the development of pathogenic complications associated with diabetes. Glucose regulates the expression of a number of vascular genes, and many of them have been linked to the development of atherosclerosis and abnormal angiogenesis (34Stenina O.I. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2005; 11: 2367-2381Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms activated by glucose that lead to changes in the gene expression profile in vascular cells remain controversial and incomplete. In this study we have undertaken an unbiased approach to identify specific molecular mechanisms that mediate the upregulation of TSP-1 expression in response to high glucose in cultured HASMC. Using different glucose analogs and metabolites sharing distinct, limited metabolic steps with glucose, we found that the hexosamine pathway of glucose breakdown controls the expression of TSP-1 in HASMC. Our results demonstrate that the transcriptional regulation of TSP-1 is mediated by protein glycosylation, which is increased as a result of activation of the hexosamine pathway. Stimulation of Cultured SMC with Glucose and Glucose Analogs—Primary HASMC isolates, kindly provided by Dr. Donald Jacobsen and Dr. Edward F. Plow (Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH) were grown to confluence in DMEM/F-12 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells with passage numbers between 3 and 12 were used in all experiments. 24 h before initiation of experiments, media were changed to low glucose (5 mm) DMEM supplemented with 0.2% FBS. Cells were stimulated with 30 mm glucose, fructose, mannose, galactose, 2-deoxyglucose, dihydroxyacetone, l-glucose, 2 mm glucosamine, 5 mm streptozotocin (STZ), and 100 μm O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene) amino-N-phenylcarbamate (PUGNAc) for 24 h. mRNA Stability Assay—Control cells or glucose-stimulated cells were treated with 5 μg/ml actinomycin D and then lysed at different time points from 20 min to 2 h after initiation of actinomycin D treatment. mRNA levels at each time point were quantified by densitometric scans of Northern blots. Northern Blots—Total RNA was extracted using TriZol reagent (Invitrogen). Isolated RNA was stored in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water at -80 °C. The purity and concentration were determined by measuring the optical density at 260 and 280 nm before use. The optical density ratio at 260/280 ranged from 1.7 to 2.0. For Northern blot analysis, 10 μg of SMC RNA was electrophoresed in 16.7% agarose-formaldehyde gels, transferred to nylon membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and hybridized to appropriate 32P-labeled cDNA probes using a Random prime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). The cDNA probe was a 600-bp fragment of TSP-1 cDNA corresponding to the N-terminal part of TSP-1 protein that has no homology with other thrombospondins. Membranes were prehybridized in ExpressHyb Hybridization solution (BD Biosciences) for 1 h at 68 °C. The heat-denatured cDNA probe was added, and hybridization was performed at 68 °C for 2 h. The membranes were then washed and exposed to Kodak BioMax MR film at -80 °C. Signal intensity was quantified using a Digital Science Imaging System (Version 2.0.1, Eastman Kodak Co.). Nuclear Run-on Assay—Nuclear run-on transcriptional assays were performed as described by Greenberg and Ziff (35Greenberg M.E. Ziff E.B. Nature. 1984; 311: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2009) Google Scholar). After incubation of HASMC with glucose, medium was aspirated, and lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitors) was added to the cells. All the buffers were prepared in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. After shaking at 4 °C for 10 min, cells were scraped and spun for 5 min at 1000 × g at 4 °C, and the pellet was washed with lysis buffer. Nuclei were resuspended in storage buffer (100 μl/plate) (50 mm Tris pH 8.3, 40% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA) and stored at -80 °C until used. For the in vitro transcription reactions, 20 million nuclei were resuspended in the reaction buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 150 mm NH4Cl, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 0.62 mm ATP, 0.31 mm GTP, 0.31 mm CTP, 80 units of RNase inhibitor, 125 μCi of [32P]UTP) and incubated for 20 min at 27 °C. 3 μ l of 10 mm UTP was added, and the incubation was continued for 10 min. This step was followed by the addition of 2 μl of RNase-free DNase I (10 units/ml), and the incubation was further continued for 10 min at 27 °C. Then, 75 μl of 20% SDS, 15 μ l of 0.5 m EDTA, 5 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 55 μl of 10 mg/ml proteinase K were added, and the resulting mixture was incubated for 2 h at 42 °C. After phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, RNA was dissolved in 50 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. 5 μg of TSP-1 or β-actin cDNA and 0.25 μg of 28 S cDNA were dissolved in a denaturing solution (25 μ l of 10 m NaOH, 4 m NaCl/ml), spotted on nylon membranes (PerkinElmer), UV-cross-linked, and dried in air. Membranes were prehybridized for 1 h at 42°C. The heat-denatured RNA probe and RNase inhibitor were added, and hybridization was performed at 42 °C overnight. After two 90-min washes in 30 mm sodium citrate, pH 7, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS at 42 °C, membranes were exposed to a Kodak BioMax MR film. Inhibition of Specific Metabolic Pathways—HASMC were incubated with 30 mm d-glucose for 24 h in the presence or absence of different glycosylation inhibitors (40 μm 6-diazo-5-oxonorleucine (DON), 40 μm azaserine, 1 mm benzyl 2-deoxy-α-d-galactopyranoside, BG). In the case of DON, cells were preincubated for 6-18 h prior to stimulation. To demonstrate that the effect of DON on TSP-1 expression was due to the inhibition of GFAT and the absence of the downstream metabolites of the hexosamine pathway, we used glucosamine to overcome DON inhibition. In these experiments cells were preincubated with 40 μm DON for 6 h followed by stimulation with 2 mm glucosamine for 24 h. Proliferation of Cultured Smooth Muscle Cells—HASMC were plated in 24-well clusters (Costar) (5000 cells/well) in 10% FBS, DMEM/F-12. 24 h later, the medium was changed to low glucose (5 mm) DMEM, and treatments were initiated as follows. After 4 h of pretreatment with inhibitors as indicated in the figure legends, 30 mm d-glucose, l-glucose, mannose, fructose, galactose, 2 mm glucosamine, 100 μm PUGNAc, and 0.8 μg/ml TSP-1 (Sigma) were added. TSP-1 was added both at the time of stimulation and again the next day to imitate continuous production of TSP-1 by sugar-stimulated cells. In some of these experiments, as shown in Fig. 8A, cells were treated with 2 μg/ml of anti-TSP-1 antibody (Clone 6.1, LabVision) or a control antibody against unrelated protein added at the time of stimulation and once again the next day. The control antibody did not affect HASMC proliferation (not shown). After 4 days of proliferation, plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the amount of cell DNA/well was measured using a CyQuant Cell proliferation assay kit (Molecular Probes). The time point was chosen because when the cells were plated at the density of 5000 cells/well (lower limit of the linear zone of detection in CyQuant assay), the difference in proliferation between glucose-stimulated and non-stimulated cells was greatest at 4 days. In another series of experiments, siRNA for TSP-1 and control siRNA (Ambion) were delivered to HASMC by nucleofection (Amaxa) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cell Transfection and Luciferase Assay—HASMC were plated in 24-well clusters (Costar) (0.3 × 106 cells/well) in 10% FBS, DMEM/F-12 media. The next day cells were transiently transfected with a -2033/+66 pTHBS-1 promoter-luciferase reporter construct, a control pGL3 vector, or with a -121/+66 pTHBS-1 promoter-luciferase construct, which was found to be unresponsive to glucose but still had high constitutive activity comparable with the full promoter reporter construct. The transfection procedure was carried out using Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s protocol. 6 h post-transfection, the plasmid DNA-containing medium was changed to low glucose (5 mm) 10% FBS, DMEM, and the transfected cells were treated with 30 mm glucose, fructose, mannose, or galactose, as appropriate. For inhibitor studies, cells were incubated with 30 mm glucose in the presence or absence of different glycosylation inhibitors, as indicated in the figures. After 42 h of incubation, cell extracts were assayed for luciferase activity using a luciferase assay kit (Promega). Protein concentrations in cell lysates were analyzed using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce), and the activity of luciferase was normalized to total protein concentrations in lysates. Overexpression of Glutamine; Fructose 6-Phosphate Amidotransferase—HASMC were trypsinized, washed, and plated in 6-well clusters (Costar) (0.8 × 106 cells per well) in 10% FBS, DMEM/F-12 media. Confluent cells were transiently transfected with 2 μg GFAT-pcDNA3.1 or with pcDNA3.1 as a control in Opti-MEM-1 reduced serum medium using Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 5 h post-transfection, the plasmid DNA-containing medium was replaced by 10% FBS, DMEM/F-12 media. Total RNA was extracted from the transfected cells 48 h post-transfection and subjected to Northern blotting, as previously described. To detect GFAT protein expression, whole cell lysates were prepared from the transfected cells using a hypotonic cell lysis buffer containing Nonidet P-40. Cell pellets were resuspended in protein sample buffer and boiled for 10 min, and samples were resolved in 8% SDS-PAGE gel. Proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue to detect overexpression of the 80-kDa protein. Western Blot—Lysates of cells transfected with GFAT or controls were analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis, and Western blotting was performed using human GFAT antibody (36Weigert C. Friess U. Brodbeck K. Haring H.U. Schleicher E.D. Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 852-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) kindly provided by Dr. E. D. Schleicher, University of Tubingen, Germany, anti-O-GlcNAc, an antibody recognizing cytoplasmic and intranuclear O-linked glycoproteins (Affinity Bioreagents, Inc.), and β-actin antibodies. Lysates of cells treated with different sugars, glucosamine, STZ, PUGNAc, and DON, as indicated in the figure legend, were resolved in 12% SDS-PAGE gel, and Western blotting was performed using anti-O-GlcNAc. The membrane was also stained with Ponceau S to determine equal protein loading. Detection of Intracellular Glycosylation by Immunofluorescence—Immunofluorescence was done using anti-O-GlcNAc antibody as described by Chen et al. (37Chen G. Liu P. Thurmond D.C. Elmendorf J.S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 534: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). HASMC were grown on coverslips in 6-well clusters (Costar; 0.75 × 106 cells per well) in 10% FBS, DMEM/F-12 medium. Confluent cells were placed in 0.2% FBS, low glucose (5 mm) DMEM for 24 h and then incubated with 30 mm d-glucose, mannose, and galactose for varying periods of time. At the appropriate end points, the media were aspirated, and the cells were fixed for 20 min at 25 °C in a solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% Triton-X. The cells were blocked in 5% donkey serum for 60 min at 25 °C. Subsequently, cells were incubated for 60 min at 25 °C with a 1:100 dilution of anti-O-GlcNAc (clone RL2) mouse monoclonal antibody against O-linked N-acetylglycosylated proteins in 5% donkey serum followed by incubation with a 1:50 dilution of rhodamine red-X-conjugated donkey anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (Jackson Immunoresearch Inc.) for 60 min at 25 °C. Quantitation of immunofluorescence was performed with Image-Pro Plus 4.5.1 (Media Cybernetics). Lactate Dehydrogenase Assay—The cytotoxicity of all sugars and inhibitors at the concentrations used was detected by the measurement of lactate dehydrogenase activity released from the cytosol of damaged cells into the supernatant, according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Roche Applied Science). Briefly, HASMC were grown in 6-well clusters in full growth medium. 24 h before an experiment, cells were placed in low glucose (5 mm) DMEM, 0.2% FBS and incubated with different glucose analogs in the presence or absence of glycosylation inhibitors, as previously described. At the appropriate end point, 100 μ l of supernatant was placed in a 96-well microtiter plate followed by the addition of 100 μl of the reaction mixture provided in the assay kit. The resulting mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and the absorbance of the samples was measured at 490 nm using a microplate reader. To determine the maximum lactate dehydrogenase release, the supernatant collected from Triton X-100-treated cells was included as a positive control. XTT (Sodium 3,3′-{1-[Phenylamino)carbonyl]-3,4-tetrazolium}-bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro) Benzene Sulfonic Acid Hydrate) Cell Viability Assay—The toxicity of glycosylation inhibitors at concentrations used in the present study was also assessed by the XTT viability assay based on the measurement of the activity of mitochondrial enzymes, according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Biotium, Inc.). Briefly, HASMC were plated in 96-well tissue culture plates. Confluent cells were placed in 100 μl of low glucose (5 mm) DMEM, 0.2% FBS for 24 h before stimulation with sugars. Cells were then treated with different glucose analogs as well as with glycosylation and GFAT inhibitors, as previously described. At the appropriate end point, activated XTT solution was added to each well, incubation was continued for 2-5 h, and the absorbance of the samples was measured at 490 nm using a microplate reader. Statistical Analyses—All values are presented as the means ± S.E., and significant differences between means were evaluated by the paired Student’s t test. Probability values of ≤0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Identification of the Hexosamine Pathway as a Candidate Mediator of TSP-1 Up-regulation by High Glucose in HASMC—Most of the effects of glucose depend on its intracellular breakdown (38Brownlee M. Nature. 2001; 414: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (7128) Google Scholar, 39Sheetz M.J. King G.L. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2002; 288: 2579-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). However, some effects result from a change in osmolarity or cell membrane properties and do not require glucose uptake by cells (40Igarashi M. Wakasaki H. Takahara N. Ishii H. Jiang Z.Y. Yamauchi T. Kuboki K. Meier M. Rhodes C.J. King G.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). To find out whether intracellular glucose metabolism is required for TSP-1 expression as well as to identify the specific steps in intracellular glucose breakdown controlling TSP-1 expression, we used different glucose analogs sharing distinct metabolic steps with glucose as follows; 1) glucose analogs that are transported into the cell and share limited metabolic steps with glucose (fructose, mannose, and galactose), 2) cell-permeable glucose analogs that cannot be metabolized (2-deoxyglucose, which cannot be metabolized beyond 2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate), 3) a downstream metabolite of the glycolytic pathway (dihydroxyacetone), and 4) a cellimpermeable glucose analog to provide osmolarity control (biologically inactive l-glucose). 30 mm l-glucose did not affect TSP-1 mRNA levels, excluding osmolarity change as a cause of TSP-1 up-regulation (Fig. 1). 30 mm 2-deoxyglucose and dihydroxyacetone failed to induce TSP-1 expression, suggesting that a limited breakdown of glucose is required and sufficient for up-regulation of TSP-1 mRNA levels. Other sugars (30 mm fructose, mannose, and galactose) increased TSP-1 mRNA expression up to 4-fold as compared with control cells (Fig. 1). This effect is similar to that of 30 mm d-glucose, suggesting that these four sugars share the metabolic pathway controlling TSP-1 expression. Production of metabolites for protein glycosylation is the common pathway shared by all of these sugars (Fig. 2). In glucose metabolism, formation of metabolites of glycosylation is mediated by an activation of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. The hexosamine pathway starts with fructose 6-phosphate, and our results with 2-deoxyglucose and dihydroxyacetone also limited the relevant steps of glycolysis to this intermediate, suggesting the hexosamine pathway as a candidate for a metabolic pathway mediating TSP-1 up-regulation by high levels of glucose. Hexosamine Pathway and Protein Glycosylation Mediate the Increase in TSP-1 mRNA Levels—To confirm that the hexosamine pathway and protein glycosylation mediate the up-regulation of TSP-1, we used specific inhibitors of GFAT, the ratelimiting enzyme of the hexosamine pathway, and direct glycosylation inhibitors that interfered with the transfer of a sugar moiety to a protein. Preincubation of HASMC with GFAT inhibitors, DON (40 μm, 18 h), and azaserine (40 μm, added at the time of glucose stimulation) inhibited the increase in glucose-induced TSP-1 mRNA levels by up to 9-fold and up to 12.9-fold, respectively (Fig. 3, A and B), as quantified by densitometric scans of Northern blots. Similarly, when HASMC were preincubated with 30 mm glucose in the presence of the direct glycosylation inhibitor BG (1 mm, added at the time of stimulation with glucose), there was no increase in TSP-1 mRNA expression. As shown in Fig. 3C, TSP-1 mRNA expression in response to 30 mm glucose was inhibited by 3-fold. The inhibitors also down-regulated the basal level of TSP-1, suggesting that the physiological concentration of glucose maintains constitutive TSP-1 expression. However, this down-regulation was not statistically significant, as shown in Fig. 3 (lower panel, representative of 3-4 independent experiments). The toxicity of the inhibitors was assessed by the release of lactate dehydrogenase and by the activity of mitochondrial enzymes, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Neither the viability nor the metabolic activity was affected by any of the inhibitors in the indicated concentrations for the times used in our experiments (data not shown). To confirm that the activation of the hexosamine pathway results in increased expression of TSP-1, we incubated HASMC for 24 h with 2 mm glucosamine, a downstream metabolite of the hexosamine pathway. In addition, cells were treated for 24 h with STZ (5 mm) and PUGNAc (100 μm). Both compounds are known to increase O-linked protein glycosylation by effectively inhibiting β-N-acetylglucosaminidase, an enzyme responsible for cleavage of O-GlcNAc residues from intracellular proteins. As shown in Fig. 3D, glucosamine, STZ, and PUGNAc significantly increased TSP-1 mRNA expression by 3.8-, 5.2-, and 5.2-fold, respectively, as compared with control cells. To show that the effect of GFAT inhibitors on TSP-1 expression is the result of specific inhibition of the hexosamine pathway and that the addition of downstream metabolites can overcome the effect of GFAT inhibitors, glucosamine was used to stimulate cells pretreated with DON. The inhibitory effect of DON (40 μm) on TSP-1 mRNA expression was completely reversed when cells were treated with glucosamine (Fig. 3E). Overexpression of GFAT Results in"
https://openalex.org/W1963739837,"A prevailing view regarding the regulation of connexin43 (Cx43) gap junction channels is that, upon intracellular acidification, the carboxyl-terminal domain (Cx43CT) moves toward the channel opening to interact with specific residues acting as a receptor site. Previous studies have demonstrated a direct, pH-dependent interaction between the Cx43CT and a Cx43 cytoplasmic loop (Cx43CL) peptide. This interaction was dependent on α-helical formation for the peptide in response to acidification; more recent studies have shown that acidification also induces Cx43CT dimerization. Whether Cx43CT dimerization is an important structural component in Cx43 regulation remains to be determined. Here we used an assortment of complimentary biophysical techniques to characterize the binding of Cx43CT or its mutants to itself and/or to a more native-like Cx43CL construct (Cx43CL100-155, residues 100-155). Our studies expand the observation that specific Cx43CT domains are important for dimerization. We further show that properties of the Cx43CL100-155 are different from those of the Cx43CL peptide; solvent acidification leads to Cx43CL100-155 oligomerization and a change in the stoichiometry and binding affinity for the Cx43CT. Homo-Cx43CT and Cx43CL100-155 oligomerization as well as the Cx43CT/Cx43CL100-155 interaction can occur under in vivo conditions; moreover, we show that Cx43CL100-155 strongly affects resonance peaks corresponding to Cx43CT residues Arg-376—Asp-379 and Asn-343—Lys-346. Overall, our data indicate that many of the sites involved in Cx43CT dimerization are also involved in the Cx43CT/Cx43CL interaction; we further propose that chemically induced Cx43CT and Cx43CL oligomerization is important for the interaction between these cytoplasmic domains, which leads to chemically induced gating of Cx43 channels.

Gap junctions are integral membrane proteins that enable direct cytoplasmic exchange of ions and low molecular weight metabolites between adjacent cells. They provide a pathway for the propagation and/or amplification of signal transduction cascades triggered by cytokines, growth factors, and other cell signaling molecules involved in growth regulation and development. Mutations in the gap junction proteins have been associated with hereditary non-syndromic deafness, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, oculodentodigital dysplasia, and cataracts, among other congenital human diseases (1Evans W.H. Martin P.E. Mol. Memb. Biol. 2002; 19: 121-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Gap junctions are formed by the apposition of connexons from adjacent cells, where each connexon is formed by six connexin proteins. Connexins are tetraspan transmembrane domain proteins with intracellular amino and carboxyl termini. There are 21 different connexin genes in the human genome. Although there is significant sequence homology among connexins, the major divergence in primary structures occurs in the cytoplasmic domains. The 43-kDa protein connexin43 (Cx43) 2The abbreviations used are: Cx43, connexin43; Cx43CT, connexin43 carboxyl terminus; Cx43CL, connexin43 cytoplasmic loop; BS3, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl suberate; EDC, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride; HSQC, heteronuclear single-quantum correlation; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; ZO-1, zonula ocludens-1; MTSL, 1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-d-pyrroline-3-methylmethanethiosulfonate. is the most abundant gap junction protein in various tissues (e.g. heart and brain) and is the focus of the present study. The importance of Cx43 gap junctions in the cardiovascular system is well established. In the heart they allow for the propagation of the action potential and the maintenance of a regular rhythm. If Cx43 channels close or are not present, normal propagation is disrupted, and lethal arrhythmias can ensue (2Rousset B. Ann. Endocrinol. (Paris). 1996; 57: 476-480PubMed Google Scholar, 3Reaume A.G. de Sousa P.A. Kulkarni S. Langille B.L. Zhu D. Davies T.C. Juneja S.C. Kidder G.M. Rossant J.

Circulation. 2001; 104: 1194-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The presence and proper regulation of Cx43 channels are also essential for normal cardiac embryogenesis (5Li W.E. Waldo K. Linask K.L. Chen T. Wessels A. Parmacek M.S. Kirby M.L. Lo C.W. Development. 2002; 129: 2031-2042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cx43 channels can be regulated in a variety of ways; for example, they are regulated by kinases (6Lampe P.D. Lau A.F. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1171-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Cx43 channels can also be regulated by other molecules and physiological conditions, such as variations in Ca+2, pH, intercellular voltage, cyclic nucleotides, neurotransmitters, and hormones (7Lampe P.D.

Res. 1999; 84: 1144-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The study of pH-dependent regulation of gap junctions becomes even more relevant given that intracellular acidification is a major consequence of tissue ischemia (15Cascio W.E. Johnson T.A. Gettes L.S. J. Cardiovasc. Electrophysiol. 1995; 6: 1039-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Experimental models of acute ischemia show that electrical uncoupling develops within 15 min after the onset of the ischemic event (16Kleber A.G. Riegger C.B. Janse M.J. Circ. Res. 1987; 61: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Uncoupling occurs before any detectable changes in the integrity of the gap junction plaque (17Bukauskas F.F. Bukauskiene A. Bennett M.V. Verselis V.K. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 137-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), suggesting that gap junction channels close while still in the membrane and before being internalized (18Saffitz J.E. Yamada K.A. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 45: 807-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Acidification-induced uncoupling also has an impact on the preservation of tissue surrounding the ischemic area in the heart and may be a key substrate for life-threatening arrhythmias during myocardial infarction (19Peters N.S. Coromilas J. Severs N.J. Wit A.L. Circulation. 1997; 95: 988-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). pH-induced closure of Cx43 channels involves interaction of the Cx43 carboxyl-terminal domain (Cx43CT) with a separate “receptor” domain. Based on the range of pH values corresponding to gating, histidine residues, particularly those located within the Cx43 cytoplasmic loop (Cx43CL), were proposed to be the candidates for the pH sensor (8Spray D.C. Burt J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C195-C205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Work performed in Xenopus oocytes showed that a Cx43CT truncation prevented acidification-induced uncoupling (20Morley G.E. Taffet S.M. Delmar M. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1294-1302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Co-expression of the Cx43CT as a separate fragment partially recovered this function, demonstrating the possible involvement of intramolecular interactions in pH gating (20Morley G.E. Taffet S.M. Delmar M. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1294-1302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). These data led to the notion that pH gating results from a “particle-receptor” interaction, modeled after the “ball-and-chain” mechanism of voltage-dependent inactivation (21Kreusch A.

In this case, the Cx43CT would act as the gating particle that, under appropriate conditions, would bind to a receptor affiliated with the pore. Further studies showed a direct, pH-dependent interaction between the Cx43CT and a peptide corresponding to the second half of the Cx43CL (22Duffy H.S. Sorgen P.L. Girvin M.E. O'Donnell P. Coombs W. Taffet S.M. Delmar M. Spray D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36706-36714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This interaction was dependent on the formation of an α-helical structure for the Cx43CL peptide (two histidines present) in response to acidification. We then proposed that the Cx43CL corresponds to the receptor for the Cx43CT (22Duffy H.S. Sorgen P.L. Girvin M.E. O'Donnell P. Coombs W. Taffet S.M. Delmar M. Spray D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36706-36714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Recent patch clamp studies have supported this hypothesis (23Seki A. Duffy H.S. Coombs W. Spray D.C. Taffet S.M. Delmar M. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 22-28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although a direct intramolecular interaction between the Cx43CT and Cx43CL was observed, we hypothesize that this interaction represents only part of the structural foundation for the particle-receptor hypothesis of pH gating. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) translational diffusion experiments indicated reduced mobility for the Cx43CT fragment at low pH, which could be explained by the formation of a higher molecular weight species (22Duffy H.S. Sorgen P.L. Girvin M.E. O'Donnell P. Coombs W. Taffet S.M. Delmar M. Spray D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36706-36714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Further studies applying a variety of biophysical methods demonstrated that the Cx43CT dimerized in a pH-dependent manner (24Sorgen P.L. Duffy H.S. Spray D.C. Delmar M. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 574-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Hence, dimerization of the Cx43CT may be one of the structural changes involved in the pH regulation of Cx43. In particular, we proposed that dimerization would increase the Cx43CT/Cx43CL binding affinity to bring the channel to a closed state and that the change in oligomeric state may play a role in modulating the molecular partners that associate with Cx43 under a given condition, thus acting as a switch for modifications in channel function. In this study we have used chemical cross-linking, sedimentation equilibrium, surface plasmon resonance, yeast two-hybrid, and NMR to characterize molecular events associated with chemical regulation of Cx43. Using both Cx43CT and Cx43CL wild-type constructs and a collection of Cx43CT mutants, we demonstrate that specific domains of the Cx43CT are important for pH-dependent dimerization. We further show that the properties of a more native-like Cx43CL construct are different from those of the previously characterized Cx43CL peptide (22Duffy H.S. Sorgen P.L. Girvin M.E. O'Donnell P. Coombs W. Taffet S.M. Delmar M. Spray D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36706-36714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar); in particular, our results demonstrate that solvent acidification leads to Cx43CL wild-type oligomerization, which in turn affects the stoichiometry and binding affinity for the Cx43CT. In addition, we show that homo-Cx43CT and Cx43CL oligomerization as well as the Cx43CT/Cx43CL interaction can occur within the cellular environment. Finally, our NMR studies led us to identify the Cx43CT residues that are affected by the interaction with the Cx43CL. We hypothesize that the pH-dependent structural modification of both the Cx43CT and Cx43CL domains is necessary for their association, which eventually leads to the closure of Cx43 gap junctions in response to low pH. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Glutathione S-Transferase-Cx43CT—The Cx43CT wild-type, Cx43CT mutants, 15N-labeled Cx43CT, and Cx43CL100-155 polypeptides were expressed and purified as described previously (22Duffy H.S. Sorgen P.L. Girvin M.E. O'Donnell P. Coombs W. Taffet S.M. Delmar M. Spray D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36706-36714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). All polypeptides were confirmed for purity and analyzed for degradation by SDS-PAGE. Chemical Cross-linking—Cross-linking of Cx43CT mutants, Cx43CL100-155, and Cx43CT mutants-Cx43CL100-155 was carried out for 1 h at room temperature using either 10 mm 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) or 1 mm bis(sulfosuccinimidyl suberate (BS3). The reactions occurred in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 5.8 and 7.5 and were quenched by the addition of ethanolamine-HCL to a final concentration of 100 mm. Complete quenching was achieved by leaving the reactions standing for 10 min at room temperature followed by heating in SDS sample buffer. The products of the reaction were then separated on 20% SDS-PAGE gels and bands visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad), the areas containing monomer and dimer Cx43CT wild type and mutants for pH 5.8 were highlighted while keeping the area constant. The volumes (mm2 × intensity), after adjusting for background, were used to calculate the percentage of dimer with respect to monomer for each Cx43CT mutant. This method accounts for minor variations in the amount of protein loaded on the SDS-PAGE gel and allowed us to quantitatively compare the dimerization differences in the Cx43CT mutants. Analytical Centrifugation—Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed using a Beckman ProteomeLab XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge and an AN-60Ti rotor available at the University of Nebraska Medical Center Analytical Ultracentrifuge Shared Resource Facility. The Cx43CT mutants were analyzed at 25 °C in PBS buffer (pH 5.8 and 7.5). For each condition data were collected at three concentrations (A280 = 0.3, 0.5, and 0.9) and two rotor speeds (18,000 and 26,000 rpm). Absorbance scans at 280 nm were taken after 14, 22, and 24 h at each speed; it was assumed that equilibrium was reached if the scans were unchanged. Data analysis was performed using the Beckman XL-A/XL-I software package within Microcal, ORIGIN Version 4. Each analysis consisted of six absorbance scans taken at three different nominal concentrations and at each of the two rotor speeds. Buffer densities were determined using a Mettler DE40 density meter operated at the experimental temperature, and data were analyzed with the program Sednterp v1.03. Partial specific volume was calculated in Sednterp from the amino acid composition. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)—All SPR experiments were performed using a Biacore 3000 at the University of Nebraska Medical Center Molecular Interaction Facility. Cx43CT wild type and mutants or Cx43CL in 1 mm maleate (pH 7.0) were immobilized covalently on the sensor chip CM-5 with EDC and N-hydroxysuccinimide according to the manufacturer’s specifications (Biacore AB, Sweden). In each flow cell 2 nmol of protein were loaded onto the surface, resulting in ∼2000 “response units” of protein captured. The amount of protein on each flow cell was calculated to be 0.22 pmol/mm2 ±1%. The sensor chip, including an activated flow cell for reference, was capped with an addition of 35 μl of 1 m ethanolamine. All analysis was performed at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. Before the loading of analytes, the chip was equilibrated with PBS containing 0.005% surfactant P-20 (PBS-P) (pH 5.8 or 7.5). Each analyte at various concentrations in the same buffer was injected in duplicate at random over the immobilized ligand. After injection of the analyte, PBS-P was reintroduced with a 300-s lag time to start dissociation. The chip was regenerated to base line by injection of 5 μl of 100 mm HCl or 0.1 m NaHCO3 (pH 8.6). Response curves were generated by subtraction of the background signal generated simultaneously by the reference flow cell. In both phases (association and dissociation), the first 5-8 s of recording were not included in the fit as to avoid artifacts resulting from peptide distribution within the flow cell. Association and dissociation rate constants (ka and kd) for the Cx43CL/Cx43CL and Cx43CT/Cx43CT interactions at pH 5.8 were calculated simultaneously from 6 curves of different concentrations of analyte by using the 1:1 Langmuir binding model in the BIAevaluation 4.1 software (Biacore). The best fit was determined from the amplitude and order of the residual data. For all best fits residual data distributed randomly and departed from the model by less than 1% (in relative response units amplitude). Calculated fits were discarded if χ-squared values were higher than 2 units/curve. The software uses numerical integration algorithms to generate ka and kd. The affinity constant (KD) was calculated from the ka and kd. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AH109 (BD Biosciences Clontech) was maintained on yeast extract, peptone, and dextrose agar plates. Co-transformation was done by the lithium acetate procedure as described in the instructions for the MATCHMAKER two-hybrid kit (BD Biosciences Clontech). For colony growth assays, AH109 cotransformants were streaked on plates lacking leucine and tryptophan and allowed to grow at 30 °C usually for 3 days or until colonies were large enough for further assays. An average of three to four colonies was then chosen and suspended in water, equilibrated to the same optical density 600 nm, and replated on plates lacking leucine and tryptophan (+HIS) as well as plates also lacking histidine (-HIS). NMR—NMR data were acquired at 7 °C using a 600-MHz Varian INOVA NMR spectrometer fitted with a cryo-probe at the University of Nebraska Medical Center NMR Core Facility. Gradient-enhanced two-dimensional 1H15N HSQC experiments (25Kay L.E. Keifer P. Saarinen T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10663-10665Crossref Scopus (2433) Google Scholar) were used to observe all backbone amide resonances in 15N-labeled Cx43CT. Data were acquired with 1024 complex points in the direct dimension and 128 complex points in the indirect dimension. Sweep widths were 10,000 Hz in the proton dimension and 2500 Hz in the nitrogen dimension. NMR spectra were processed using NMRPipe (26Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11570) Google Scholar) and analyzed using NMRView (27Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar). Preparation of Recombinant Cx43CT Mutants—Previous studies from our laboratory characterizing the pH-dependent regulation of Cx43 gap junction channels revealed pH-dependent Cx43CL α-helical formation (22Duffy H.S. Sorgen P.L. Girvin M.E. O'Donnell P. Coombs W. Taffet S.M. Delmar M. Spray D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36706-36714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), Cx43CT dimerization (24Sorgen P.L. Duffy H.S. Spray D.C. Delmar M. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 574-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and a Cx43CT/Cx43CL interaction (22Duffy H.S. Sorgen P.L. Girvin M.E. O'Donnell P. Coombs W. Taffet S.M. Delmar M. Spray D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36706-36714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To further characterize these events, we generated a series of recombinant Cx43CT deletion mutants (Fig. 1, top). The mutants were designed to model deletions of the dimerization domains (Cx43CT Δ281-295, Δ299-304, Δ314-327, and Δ340-348) (24Sorgen P.L. Duffy H.S. Spray D.C. Delmar M. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 574-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), the two helical domains (Cx43CT Δ314-327, Δ340-348, and Δ314-327,340-348) (28Sorgen P.L. Duffy H.S. Sahoo P. Coombs W. Delmar M. Spray D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54695-54701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), the ZO-1 PDZ-2 binding domain (Cx43CT Δ364-382) (28Sorgen P.L. Duffy H.S. Sahoo P. Coombs W. Delmar M. Spray D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54695-54701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), a region of currently unknown importance (Cx43CT Δ348-363), a carboxyl-terminal truncation mutant (Cx43CT Δ315-382), and a series of amino-terminal truncation mutants (Cx43CT Δ255-279, Δ255-295, and Δ255-313). Each of the Cx43CT mutant constructs were purified to homogeneity (Fig. 1, bottom). For clarity, the numbering of amino acids in full-length Cx43 was retained for the recombinant Cx43CT proteins. Chemical Cross-linking of Cx43CT Mutants—Although previous NMR studies revealed Cx43CT residues involved in dimerization (24Sorgen P.L. Duffy H.S. Spray D.C. Delmar M. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 574-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we were unable to identify sufficient intermolecular energy transfers by the nuclear Overhauser effect to generate models of the dimer structure. This may be due to spectral overlap as well as the dimer interaction being weak and transient. Therefore, to identify the minimal region(s) necessary for dimer formation and possible additional dimerization domains, recombinant Cx43CT mutants were exposed to the irreversible cross-linking agent EDC (Fig. 2A). EDC is a zerolength cross-linking agent used to couple carboxyl groups to primary amines. The reaction was conducted at two different pH values (5.8 and 7.5). To assure the accuracy of the trends in intensity changes and quantitate the cross-linking data, cross-linking for the wild type and each of the mutants was repeated in triplicate (data not shown), and densitometry was performed to determine the fraction of total protein found in the dimer form. The percent dimerization indicated in Fig. 2A is the average of the three cross-linking replicates. Cross-linking with the expected mobility for dimers was observed for each of the Cx43CT deletions at pH 5.8 except for the Cx43CT Δ315-382 mutant. However, when compared with wild type, the intensity of the dimer band significantly decreased for Cx43CT mutants Δ314-327, Δ314-327/Δ340-348, and Δ364-382 (∼69% decrease), moderately decreased for Cx43CT mutants Δ281-295 and Δ299-304 (∼28% decrease), and increased for the amino-terminal Cx43CT truncation mutants Δ255-280, Δ255-295, and Δ255-313. At pH 7.5 some dimeric species were observed; however, oligomerization was much more prevalent at the low pH, consistent with our previous studies, suggesting a pH dependence to the dimerization process (24Sorgen P.L. Duffy H.S. Spray D.C. Delmar M. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 574-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The involvement of Cx43CT residues 364-382 in dimerization, which was not previously identified by NMR (unlike Cx43CT residues 281-295, 299-304, and 314-327 (24Sorgen P.L. Duffy H.S. Spray D.C. Delmar M. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 574-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar)), was confirmed by SPR and EDC cross-linking of Cx43CT wild type to a peptide containing Cx43CT residues 364-382 (data not shown). Together, these results suggest that, rather than being localized to a single Cx43CT region, dimerization is a more global phenomenon that depends on the overall integrity of the carboxyl terminus domain. To confirm the results obtained in the presence of EDC (Fig. 2A), two Cx43CT mutants (Δ314-327/340-348 and Δ255-295) were assessed for cross-linking using a different cross-linking agent (BS3). This chemical was chosen over EDC because of its different optimal pH range (7.0-9.0 versus 4.5-7.5), spacer arm length (11.4 versus 0 Aå), and reactive group (only primary amines versus primary amines and carboxyl groups). As shown in Fig. 2B, there was an increase in band density of the Δ255-295 dimer and a decrease for Δ314-327/340-348 when compared with wild type. Interestingly, trimeric species were observed for the wild type and not the Cx43CT mutant Δ255-295. These results indicate that the BS3 cross-linking pattern for these mutants was consistent with that of the EDC cross-linking. Because of their distinctive effects, these mutants were used for further characterization of Cx43CT dimer formation. To characterize the binding affinity of the Cx43CT/Cx43CT interaction, SPR was performed (Fig. 2C). In this method an interaction between the ligand bound to the chip and analyte flowing over the chip results in an increase of mass. The signal is measured in arbitrary response units. Cx43CT was covalently bound to a carboxymethyl dextran matrix on the surface of a sensor chip and exposed to different concentrations of Cx43CT at pH 5.8. In agreement with the cross-linking data, Cx43CT interacted with itself at pH 5.8. The KD value of the Cx43CT/Cx43CT interaction at pH 5.8, estimated by using the 1:1 Langmuir binding model, was 0.21 μm. Molecular Mass Determination for Cx43CT Mutants—A more quantitative analysis of the effect of specific mutations on Cx43CT dimerization was obtained by sedimentation analysis. This method also allowed us to more accurately determine the stoichiometry of oligomerization at different pH values. Plots of optical density at equilibrium as a function of radius for Cx43CT mutants Δ314-327/340-348 and Δ255-295 are presented in Fig. 3A. Each plot was best fitted by a function derived from a self-association model to determine the fraction of protein in specific oligomeric states (Beckman XL-A/XL-I software package). A monomer-dimer-trimer model showed excellent convergence, as demonstrated by the minimal deviation seen in the residuals (top plot on each panel) and a weighted variance approaching unity (data not shown). In contrast, fits of data to single component (i.e. non-oligomeric), monomer-dimer, and monomer-dimer-tetramer models had weighted variance values significantly greater than one. The results for the monomer-dimer-trimer model were used to calculate the fraction of total protein that existed in the dimer conformation at a concentration of 70 μm (the same concentration as used in the cross-linking experiment in Fig. 2) at pH 5.8 and 7.5 (Fig. 3B). As compared with Cx43CT wild-type (86% dimer, pH 5.8, and 12% dimer, pH 7.5 (24Sorgen P.L. Duffy H.S. Spray D.C. Delmar M. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 574-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar)), the Cx43CT Δ314-327/340-348 mutation had an overall decrease in dimer formation, and the Cx43CT Δ255-295 mutation had an increase in dimer formation at both pH values. These results were qualitatively consistent with those obtained by cross-linking (see Fig. 2), although quantitative differences were also apparent (see “Discussion”). Characterizing Cx43CL Oligomerization—Previous studies to determine the receptor domain for the Cx43CT used a peptide corresponding to the second half of the Cx43CL (dubbed L2; Cx43CL119-144, residues 119-144 (22Duffy H.S. Sorgen P.L. Girvin M.E. O'Donnell P. Coombs W. Taffet S.M. Delmar M. Spray D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36706-36714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar)). Although the Cx43CL119-144 peptide allowed us to ascertain that the two domains interact under acidic conditions, a better system"
https://openalex.org/W1996810321,"Abstract Fungal prions are infectious filamentous polymers of proteins that are soluble in uninfected cells. In its prion form, the HET-s protein of Podospora anserina participates in a fungal self/non-self recognition phenomenon called heterokaryon incompatibility. Like other prion proteins, HET-s has a so-called “prion domain” (its C-terminal region, HET-s-(218–289)) that is responsible for induction and propagation of the prion in vivo and for fibril formation in vitro. Prion fibrils are thought to have amyloid backbones of polymerized prion domains. A relatively detailed model has been proposed for prion domain fibrils of HET-s based on a variety of experimental constraints (Ritter, C., Maddelein, M. L., Siemer, A. B., Luhrs, T., Ernst, M., Meier, B. H., Saupe, S. J., and Riek, R. (2005) Nature 435, 844–848). To test specific predictions of this model, which envisages axial stacking of β-solenoids with two coils per subunit, we examined fibrils by electron microscopy. Electron diffraction gave a prominent meridional reflection at (0.47 nm)-1, indicative of cross-β structure, as predicted. STEM (scanning transmission electron microscopy) mass-per-unit-length measurements yielded 1.02 ± 0.16 subunits per 0.94 nm, in agreement with the model prediction (1 subunit per 0.94 nm). This is half the packing density of ∼1 subunit per 0.47 nm previously obtained for fibrils of the yeast prion proteins, Ure2p and Sup35p, whence it follows that the respective amyloid architectures are basically different."
https://openalex.org/W1980713183,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis PimB has been demonstrated to catalyze the addition of a mannose residue from GDP-mannose to a monoacylated phosphatidyl-myo-inositol mannoside (Ac1PIM1) to generate Ac1PIM2. Herein, we describe the disruption of its probable orthologue Cg-pimB and the chemical analysis of glycolipids and lipoglycans isolated from wild type Corynebacterium glutamicum and the C. glutamicum::pimB mutant. Following a careful analysis, two related glycolipids, Gl-A and Gl-X, were found in the parent strain, but Gl-X was absent from the mutant. The biosynthesis of Gl-X was restored in the mutant by complementation with either Cg-pimB or Mt-pimB. Subsequent chemical analyses established Gl-X as 1,2-di-O-C16/C18:1-(α-d-mannopyranosyl)-(1→4)-(α-d-glucopyranosyluronic acid)-(1→3)-glycerol (ManGlcAGroAc2) and Gl-A as the precursor, GlcAGroAc2. In addition, C. glutamicum::pimB was still able to produce Ac1PIM2, suggesting that Cg-PimB catalyzes the synthesis of ManGlcAGroAc2 from GlcAGroAc2. Isolation of lipoglycans from C. glutamicum led to the identification of two related lipoglycans. The larger lipoglycan possessed a lipoarabinomannan-like structure, whereas the smaller lipoglycan was similar to lipomannan (LM). The absence of ManGlcA-GroAc2 in C. glutamicum::pimB led to a severe reduction in LM. These results suggested that ManGlcAGroAc2 was further extended to an LM-like molecule. Complementation of C. glutamicum::pimB with Cg-pimB and Mt-pimB led to the restoration of LM biosynthesis. As a result, Cg-PimB, which we have assigned as MgtA, is now clearly defined as a GDP-mannose-dependent α-mannosyltransferase from our in vitro analyses and is involved in the biosynthesis of ManGlcAGroAc2.

The Corynebacterianeae represent a distinct and unusual group within Gram-positive bacteria, with the most prominent members being the human pathogens Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae (1.Bloom B.R. Murray C.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1055-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar). In addition, the human pathogen Corynebacterium diphtheriae is the causal agent of diphtheria, and serious economic losses occur from the infection of animals by corynebacteria, such as Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and Corynebacterium matruchotii (2.Coyle M.B.

Furthermore, nonpathogenic bacteria belong to this taxon, such as Corynebacterium glutamicum, which is used in the industrial production of amino acids (4.Sahm H. Eggeling L. de Graaf A.A. Biol.

PimC has been demonstrated to allow further mannosylation to Ac1PIM3 (20.Kremer L. Gurcha S.S. Bifani P. Hitchen P.G. Baulard A. Morris H.R. Dell A. Brennan P.J. Besra G.S. Biochem.

Interestingly, the polar lipid profile revealed a previously uncharacterized major glycolipid. Furthermore, disruption of pimB in C. glutamicum abolished the synthesis of this novel glycolipid, which had a subsequent profound effect on LM biosynthesis. In addition, complementation with either Cg-pimB or Mt-pimB led to the restoration of wild type glycolipid and lipoglycan biosynthesis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains and Culture Conditions−The strains and plasmids used are given in Table 1 (26.Grant S.G.

C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 (wild type) and Escherichia coli DH5αmcr were grown in Luria-Bertani broth (LB; Difco) at 30 and 37 °C, respectively. For C. glutamicum, kanamycin was used at a concentration of 25 μg/ml, and spectinomycin was used at a concentration of 250 μg/ml where appropriate. The minimal medium used for C. glutamicum was CGXII, and mutants were selected on LBHIS (28.Eggeling L. Reyes O. Eggeling L. Bott M. Handbook of Corynebacterium Glutamicum. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL2005: 535-566Crossref Google Scholar). Samples for lipid analyses were prepared by harvesting cells grown either on BHIS for 9 h up to an A600 nm of 7–8 or on CGXII for 17 h up to A600 nm of 47–51. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, followed by saline washing and freeze drying. M. tuberculosis H37Rv DNA was obtained from Dr. J. T.

After purification and treatment with polynucleotide kinase, the fragment was ligated with SmaI-cleaved pK19mobsacB. To construct pEKEx3-Cg-pimB, chromosomal DNA of C. glutamicum together with primers p557up3 and p557low3 and KOD DNA polymerase were used to amplify Cg-pimB. The resulting 1232-bp fragment was cloned into the SmaI site of pUC18, from which the fragment was reisolated by digestion with ScaI/EcoRI to ligate it with SmaI/EcoRI-cleaved pEKEx3. Similarly, Mt-pimB was amplified using primers ppimBMtex and ppimbMtrev using M. tuberculosis chromosomal DNA. The resulting 1153-bp fragment was cloned into pUC18, subsequently excised as a SmaI/EcoRI fragment, which was ligated with SmaI/EcoRI-cleaved pEKEx3. All cloned fragments were verified by nucleotide sequencing.TABLE 2PCR primers Restriction enzyme recognition sites are in boldface type, and the ribosome binding site is in italic type.NamePrimerp557up5′-TTGGCCACTGCAAGCTGGGAAT-3′p557low5′-TGTGAAGATCGCATCCGGCATC-3′p557up25′-TGATGTCGCAGGGTTCTCCCAG-3p557low25′-GTTGATCAAATCAATGGGACCACC-3′puni5′-CGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC-3prsp15′-CACAGGAAACAGCTATGACCATG-3′p557up35′-CGCAGTACTAAGGAGATATAGATGTGGAGATAAT AAGGCCCATG-3′p557low35′-CGCGAATTCTTAAGCCTCGATGCTGATGCGG-3′ppimBMtex5′-TCCCCCGGGAAGGAGATATAGATGTGTGTGGCGT GCGCGTTGC-3′ppimbMtrev5′-CGGAATTCTTACGCGGCCTGGGTCGTGC-3′ Open table in a new tab Construction of Strains−Cells of C. glutamicum were made competent as described (28.Eggeling L.

CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL2005: 535-566Crossref Google Scholar) and transformed by electroporation with pK19mobsacB::pimB to kanamycin resistance, signifying the integration of the construct into the chromosome. Using the two different primer pairs prsp1/p557up2 and puni/p557low2, respectively, the correct disruption of Cg-pimB integration was verified. Competent cells of one disruption mutant were chosen and transformed by electroporation with either pEKEx3-Cg-pimB or pEKEx3-Mt-pimB to spectinomycin resistance, and the plasmid integrity of the recombinant clones was confirmed in plasmid preparations.Lipid Extraction and Analysis−Polar lipids and apolar lipids were initially extracted from 6 g of dry C. glutamicum cells according to the procedures of Dobson et al. (29.Dobson G. Minnikin D.E. Minnikin S.M. Parlett M. Goodfellow M. Ridell M. Magnusson M. Goodfellow M. Minnikin D.E. Chemical Methods in Bacterial Systematics. Academic Press, Inc., London1985: 237-265Google Scholar) by stirring in 220 ml of methanolic saline (20 ml of 0.3% NaCl and 200 ml of CH3OH) and 220 ml of petroleum ether for 2 h. The cells were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min. The resulting biphasic solution was separated, and the upper layer containing apolar lipids was recovered. An additional 220 ml of petroleum ether was added, mixed, and harvested as described above. The two upper petroleum ether fractions were combined and dried under reduced pressure.To extract polar lipids, 260 ml of CHCl3, CH3OH, 0.3% NaCl (9:10:3, v/v/v) was added to the lower aqueous CH3OH layer, and the solution was stirred for 4 h. This mixture was filtered, and the filter cake was re-extracted twice with 85 ml of CHCl3, CH3OH, 0.3% NaCl (5:10:4, v/v/v). CHCl3 (145 ml) and 0.3% NaCl (145 ml) were added to the combined filtrates. This mixture was stirred for 1 h and allowed to settle, and the lower layer containing the polar lipids was recovered and dried under reduced pressure. The polar lipid extract was examined by two-dimensional TLC on aluminum-backed plates of silica gel 60 F254 (Merck 5554), using CHCl3, CH3OH, H2O (65:25:4, v/v/v) in the first direction and CHCl3/CH3COOH/CH3OH/H2O (40: 25:3:6, v/v/v/v) in the second direction (29.Dobson G. Minnikin D.E. Minnikin S.M. Parlett M. Goodfellow M. Ridell M. Magnusson M. Goodfellow M. Minnikin D.E. Chemical Methods in Bacterial Systematics. Academic Press, Inc., London1985: 237-265Google Scholar). Glycolipids were visualized by spraying plates with α-naphthol/sulfuric acid followed by gentle charring of plates, by spraying with 5% ethanolic molybdophosphoric acid and charring, or by using a Dittmer and Lester reagent that is specific for phospholipids and glycophospholipids.Purification of Glycolipids−The crude polar lipid extract (250 mg) was dissolved in CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1, v/v) and applied to a DEAE-cellulose column (2 × 15 cm) for purification. The column was eluted with CHCl3/CH3OH (100 ml; 2:1, v/v) and increasing concentrations of ammonium acetate (1–500 mm) in CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1, v/v). The purification process was monitored by TLC using either CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (65:25:4, v/v/v) or CHCl3/CH3COOH/CH3OH/H2O (40:25:3:6, v/v/v/v) (29.Dobson G. Minnikin D.E. Minnikin S.M. Parlett M. Goodfellow M. Ridell M. Magnusson M. Goodfellow M. Minnikin D.E. Chemical Methods in Bacterial Systematics. Academic Press, Inc., London1985: 237-265Google Scholar). Glycolipids were visualized by spraying plates with α-naphthol/sulfuric acid followed by gentle charring of the plates. Lipid phosphates were stained and visualized using a modification of the Dittmer-Lester reagent for TLC (30.Ryu E.K. MacCoss M. J. Lipid Res. 1979; 20: 561-563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glycolipids were further purified into individual species by preparative TLC on 10 × 20-cm plastic-backed TLC plates of silica gel 60 F254 (catalog number 5735; Merck), run in CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (65:25:4, v/v/v). The plates were sprayed with 0.01% 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene dissolved in petroleum ether/acetone (9:1, v/v), and the glycolipids were visualized under UV light. Following detection, the plates were redeveloped in toluene, and the corresponding purified glycolipid bands were scraped from the plates and extracted from the silica gel using CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1, v/v).In Vitro Synthesis of Radiolabeled Mannolipids−C. glutamicum strains ATCC 13032 and the 13032::pimB mutant transformed with either pEKEx3, pEKEx3-Gg-pimB, or pEKEx3-Mt-pimB were cultured to the midlogarithmic growth phase in 2 liters of BHIS medium with appropriate antibiotics. Cells were harvested by centrifugation; resuspended in 20 ml of 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.9, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm MgCl2; and lysed immediately by passing twice through a French pressure cell (aperture pressure change = 3000 p.s.i.). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 27,000 × g (4 °C, 30 min), and membranes were deposited by centrifugation of the supernatant at 105,000 × g (4 °C, 90 min). The membrane pellet was gently resuspended in the above buffer to 250 μl and supplemented with CaCl2 to 10 mm and 25 μg of amphomycin in order to inhibit transfers of radiolabel to polyprenyl phosphate acceptors. This mixture was held at 37 °C for 15 min prior to the addition of 0.25 μCi of GDP-Man (0.3054 Ci/mmol; GE Healthcare). The reaction was held at 37 °C for a further 45 min before quenching with 4 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3, v/v/v). A biphase was formed by the addition of 1.75 ml of CHCl3 and 0.55 ml of H2O. The lower organic phase was washed twice with 2 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (3:47:48, v/v/v). The extract was dried, and radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation counting of a sample of the extract. Two-dimensional TLC analysis was carried out as above, and the mannolipids formed were visualized by phosphorimaging (Kodak K Screen).Extraction and Purification of Lipoglycans−Lipoglycans were extracted from delipidated cells as previously described (31.Nigou J.

Bordat Y. Martin C. Gicquel B. Puzo G. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3029-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were broken by sonication (MSE Soni-prep 150; 12-μm amplitude, 60 s on, 90 s off for 10 cycles, on ice) and the cell debris was refluxed five times with 50% C2H5OH at 68 °C for 12-h intervals. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant containing lipoglycans, neutral glycans, and proteins dried. This dried extract was then treated with hot phenol-H2O. The aqueous phase was dialyzed and dried before separate and extensive treatments with α-amylase, DNase, and RNase chymotrypsin and trypsin. Finally, the lipoglycan fraction was dialyzed extensively against water.The crude lipoglycan extract was resuspended in buffer A (50 mm ammonium acetate and 15% propan-1-ol) and subjected to octyl-Sepharose CL-4B hydrophobic interaction chromatography (2.5 × 50 cm) as previously reported (33.Leopold K. Fischer W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 208: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The column was initially washed with 4 column volumes of buffer A to ensure removal of neutral glycans, followed by buffer B (50 mm ammonim acetate and 50% propan-1-ol). The eluate was collected and concentrated to ∼1 ml and precipitated using 5 ml of C2H5OH, and the sample was dried using a Savant SpeedVac. The freeze-dried sample containing the retained material from the hydrophobic interaction column was then resuspended in buffer C (0.2 m NaCl, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate (w/v), 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8) to a final concentration of 200 mg/ml. The sample was gently mixed and left to incubate for 48 h at room temperature. The sample was then loaded onto a 200 ml Sephacryl S-200 column previously equilibrated with buffer C. The sample was eluted with 400 ml of buffer C at a flow rate of 3 ml/h, collecting 1.5-ml fractions. The fractions were monitored by SDS-PAGE using either a silver stain utilizing periodic acid and silver nitrate (34.Hunter S.W. Gaylord H. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12345-12351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or a Pro-Q emerald glycoprotein stain (Invitrogen), and individual fractions were pooled and dialyzed extensively against buffer D (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) for 72 h with frequent changes of buffer. The samples were further dialyzed against deionized water for 48 h with frequent changes of water, lyophilized, and stored at -20 °C.Glycosyl Compositional and Linkage Analysis−Glycosyl compositional analysis was performed by either routine gas chromatography (GC) or capillary electrophoresis analysis as described previously (35.Nigou J. Vercellone A. Puzo G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1353-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Glycosyl linkage analyses were performed as described previously (36.Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3170) Google Scholar). Briefly, per-O-methylated samples were hydrolyzed using 500 μl of 2 m trifluoroacetic acid at 110 °C for 2 h, reduced using 350 μl of a 10 mg/ml solution of NaBD4 (1 m aqueous NH4OH/C2H5OH, 1:1, v/v), and per-O-acetylated using 300 μl of acetic anhydride for 1 h at 110 °C. The resulting alditol acetates were solubilized in cyclohexane before analysis by GC and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) (37.Alderwick L.J. Radmacher E. Seidel M. Gande R. Hitchen P.G.

Chem. 2005; 280: 32362-32371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).GC analysis was performed using a Thermoquest Trace GC 2000 equipped with a flame ionization detector. Samples were separated using a temperature program as follows. Injector temperature was set at 50 °C, held for 1 min, and then increased to 110 °C at 20 °C/min. The oven was held at 110 °C and then ramped to 290 °C at 8 °C/min and held for 5 min to ensure that all of the products had eluted from the column. All of the data were collected and analyzed using Xcaliber (version 1.2) software.Gl-A, Gl-X, and Ac1PIM2 Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight-Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) Analyses−Analyses of PIMs were carried out on a Voyager DE-STR MALDI-TOF instrument (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) using the reflectron mode of detection as previously described (38.Gilleron M. Quesniaux V.F. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29880-29889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). PIMs were analyzed by the instrument operating at 20 kV in the negative ion mode, using an extraction delay time set at 200 ns. Typically, spectra from 100–250 laser shots were summed to obtain the final spectrum. All of the samples were prepared for MALDI-TOF-MS analyses using the on-probe sample clean-up procedure with cation exchange resin. The 2-(4-hydroxyphenylazo)-benzoic acid matrix was used at a concentration of 10 mg/ml in C2H5OH/H2O (1:1, v/v). Typically, 0.5 μl of PIM sample (10 μg) in a CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O solution and 0.5 μl of the matrix solution, containing 5–10 cation exchange beads, were deposited on the target, mixed with a micropipette, and dried under a gentle stream of warm air.Analyses of the Gl-A and Gl-X were carried out on a 4700 Proteomics Analyzer (with TOF-TOF optics; Voyager DE-STR; Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA) using the reflectron mode. Ionization was effected by irradiation with a Nd:YAG laser (355 nm) operating by pulses of 500 ps with a frequency of 200 Hz. Gl-A and Gl-X were analyzed in the positive ion mode. Spectra from 2500 to 5000 laser shots were summed to obtain the final spectrum. Typically, 0.3 μl of Gl-X (at 10 mg/ml in CHCl3/CH3OH, 1:1, v/v) and 0.3 μl of the matrix solution (2,5-dihydrobenzoic acid at ∼10 mg/ml in C2H5OH/H2O, 1:1, v/v) were deposited on the target. Collision-induced dissociation (CID)-MS/MS was performed using atmosphere as the gas type. The pressure was set to medium, and the collision energy was set to 1 kV.Analysis of per-O-methylated Gl-X was performed using an Applied Biosystems 4800 MALDI-TOF/TOF in the positive mode. MS/MS was performed with the collision energy set to 1 kV with air as the collision gas. The per-O-methylated sample was dissolved in CH3OH, and 0.5-μl aliquots were loaded onto the target plate with 0.5 μl of the matrix 2,5-dihydrobenzoic acid at 10 mg/ml in CH3OH/H2O. Sequazyme peptide mass standards were used as external calibrants (Applied Biosystems).NMR Spectroscopy−NMR spectra of lipoglycans were recorded on a Bruker DMX-500 equipped, with a double resonance (1H/X)-BBi z-gradient probe head.

Heat shock proteins had been shown to induce the activation of dendritic cells, T cells, and B cells. However, the possible contamination of endotoxin in heat shock protein preparations makes their function as an activator of immune system ambiguous. Here, we examined the ability of bacterial Hsp60 and Hsp70 to activate Jurkat T cells and primary T cells. We found that Burkholderia pseudomallei Hsp70 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis Hsp70 could costimulate Jurkat T cells to make IL-2 and signal through TLR5. This costimulatory activity is not due to endotoxin or contaminants signaling via TLR2 nor TLR4. However, recombinant Hsp70 expressed in Escherichia coli ΔfliC strain completely lost its ability to costimulate T cells. Thus, the activation of T cells by recombinant Hsp70 is ascribed to flagellin contamination.

Recombinant human Hsp70 and Hsp60 cleaned of endotoxin contamination failed to induce activation and cytokine secretion from antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages (4.Bausinger H. Lipsker D.

For example, human T cells were reported to directly respond to soluble human Hsp60 via TLR2 (7.Zanin-Zhorov A. Nussbaum G. Franitza S. Cohen I.R. Lider O.

Besides mammalian Hsps, mycobacterial Hsp70 has been shown to stimulate the release of cytokines and chemokines from dendritic cells (11.Wang Y. Kelly C.G. Singh M. McGowan E.G. Carrara A.S.

Furthermore, a mycobacterial Hsp70 fusion protein with ovalbumin was shown to elicit a CD4+ T cell-independent, ovalbumin-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response in mice (13.Huang Q. Richmond J.F. Suzue K. Eisen H.N. Young R.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Harmala et al. (14.Harmala L.A. Ingulli E.G. Curtsinger J.M. Lucido M.M.

However, the mechanism of the adjuvanticity of the fusion protein was not addressed. To determine whether bacterial Hsps belonging to the 60 and 70 families have a direct effect on T cells as had been reported for mammalian Hsp60 (10.Osterloh A. Meier-Stiegen F. Veit A. Fleischer B. von Bonin A. Breloer M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47906-47911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), we examine the ability of mycobacterial Hsp65 and Hsp70, as well as Burkholderia pseudomallei Hsp60 and Hsp70 to activate the human Jurkat T cell line as well as primary CD4+ T cells. Only Hsp70s are found to enhance T cell activation. However, this effect is completely abrogated when the recombinant proteins are made in Escherichia coli with the flagellin gene deleted. Thus, the costimulatory effect of T cell activation by Hsp70 is due to the presence of flagellin contamination in the recombinant protein preparations. Materials−LPS from E. coli 055:B5 (catalog number L4005), Pam3CSK4 (catalog code tlrl-pms), ionomycin (catalog number I9657), and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (catalog number P1585) were purchased from Sigma. Purified mouse anti-human CD3 monoclonal antibody (anti-CD3, catalog number 555329) was from BD Pharmingen. Recombinant Mycobacterium tuberculosis Hsp70 kindly provided by Dr. Paul A. MacAry (National University of Singapore) was purchased from Lionex GmbH (Product code: MT-70kDa, batch: 04-1). The pcDNA3.1 myc/His vector inserted with full-length cDNA encoding human TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 (pTLR2, pTLR4, and pTLR5) were kindly provided by Dr. Jinhua Lu (National University of Singapore). Cell Cultures−Jurkat clone E6-1 (ATCC, TIB-152) and human embryonic kidney HEK 293T (ATCC, CRL-11268) cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) and DMEM (Sigma), respectively, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Biological Industries, Kibbutz Beit Haemek, Israel), 2 mml-glutamine (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Sigma). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Recombinant Protein Purification−The full-length B. pseudomallei Hsp60 (BpHsp60), Hsp70 (BpHsp70), flagellin (Flg) genes and the full-length M. bovis Hsp65 (MbHsp65) gene with a His6 tag at the N terminus were cloned into the expression vector pQE-30 (Qiagen) and transformed into E. coli M15 cells. The expression vector of BpHsp70 was also transformed into E. coli ΔfliC–/– strain NK9375 kindly provided by Dr. N. Kleckner (15.Bates D. Epstein J. Boye E. Fahrner K. Berg H. Kleckner N. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 380-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The recombinant proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (16.Chen K. Lu J. Wang L. Gan Y.H. J. Leuk. Bio. 2004; 75: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Isolation of CD4+ T Cells from Human Peripheral Blood−Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were prepared from healthy blood donors using HISTOPAQUE®-1077 (Sigma). CD4+ T cells were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by magnetic cell sorting using human CD4+ microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec), according to manufacturer’s instruction. The purity of CD4+ T cells was over 98% as determined by flow cytometry via staining with CD3-PE and CD4-FITC (BD Pharmingen). Transient Transfection of Cell Lines−HEK 293T cells were seeded in the 24-well plate 24 h prior to transfection. The cells were transfected with two luciferase reporter plasmids, p5xNF-κB-luc (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and pRL-CMV (Promega, Madison, WI), using the GenePorter 2 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Gene Therapy System, La Jolla, CA). HEK 293T cells were also cotransfected with the pTLR5 plasmid. The total amount of DNA transfected was kept constant with the pcDNA empty vector. Jurkat cells were seeded at a density of 0.8 × 106/ml in the 24-well plate and transfected with 0.25 μg of each of the luciferase reporter plasmids per well using TransIT-Jurkat transfection reagent according to the manufacturer’s instruction (Mirus, Madison, WI). Determination of Relative NF-κB Activity−NF-κB activation was measured as previously described (17.Zhang H. Tay P.N. Cao W. Li W. Lu J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, 24 h post-transfection, cells were incubated with LPS, Pam3CSK4, Flg, or the recombinant Hsps protein for 6 h. The cells were lysed, and luciferase expression in the lysate was determined by the dual luciferase assay kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega). In each experiment, NF-κB-mediated luciferase expression was normalized to CMV-mediated constitutive luciferase expression and annotated as relative luciferase activity. Determination of IL-2 Concentration−Jurkat or CD4+ T cells (0.2 × 106/well) were incubated with LPS, Pam3CSK4, Flg, or the recombinant Hsps in 96-well MaxiSorp plate (Nunc), which was coated overnight with 100 μl of 2.5 μg/ml anti-CD3 antibody. After 20 h (24 h for CD4+ T cells), supernatant were collected and assayed for IL-2 production using OptEIA human IL-2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay set (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Colony PCR−Single colony of E. coli strain M15 and NK9375 was picked and subjected to PCR using the primer pair specific for fliC gene (5′-3′): ttatggcacaagtcattaatac/gattaaccctgcagcagagac (1501-bp amplicon). One PCR cycle consisted of the following: 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1.5 min. The total cycle number was 30 with a final elongation step at 72 °C for 7 min. The PCR product was separataed on a 1.2% agarose gel. Reverse Transcriptase-PCR−Total RNA of Jurkat cells was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Subsequently, 5 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed using 200 units of M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega). PCR was conducted using 1 μl of cDNA and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Promega). The primers used for amplification of TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 were described previously (18.Kadowaki N. Ho S. Antonenko S. de Waal Malefyt R. Kastelein R.A. Bazan F. Liu Y.J. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 863-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1691) Google Scholar). The PCR conditions consist of 30 cycles of the following: 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, followed by a final elongation step at 72 °C for 5 min. The PCR products (715 bp for TLR2, 623 bp for TLR4, and 446 bp for TLR5) were separated on a 1.2% agarose gel. Hsp70 but Not Hsp60 Species Enhance IL-2 Secretion in Jurkat Cells−To determine whether Hsp60 and Hsp70 proteins of bacterial origin could act directly on T cells, recombinant heat shock proteins were added to Jurkat clone E6-1 cells, which have their T cell receptors cross-linked by immobilized anti-CD3 antibody. Incubated with anti-CD3 antibody alone, Jurkat cells secreted IL-2 at basal level. IL-2 concentration in the supernatants displayed a dose-dependent increase with the addition of recombinant B. pseudomallei Hsp70 (BpHsp70) (Fig. 1A). However, recombinant B. pseudomallei Hsp60 (BpHsp60) and M. bovis Hsp65 (MbHsp65) did not enhance IL-2 secretion even up to the concentration of 20 μg/ml and 40 μg/ml respectively (Fig. 1, C and D). To determine whether the costimulatory effect on Jurkat cells is general for bacterial Hsp70, we tested the commercially available M. tuberculosis Hsp70 (MtbHsp70). Addition of MtbHsp70 at higher concentrations than that of BpHsp70 increased the IL-2 secretion in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). Hsp70 Costimulates Jurkat Cells in a Manner Similar to Flagellin−Endotoxin is known to be a common and potent contaminant of heat shock proteins (19.Tsan M.F. Gao B. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C739-C744Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). It is necessary to be cautious about the possibility that the contaminants could activate the secretion of IL-2 in Jurkat cells. The recombinant heat shock proteins used in our studies were produced in E. coli and extensively treated with deoxycholate to minimize LPS contamination. However, they could still be contaminated by bacterial components. To determine whether common bacterial contaminants could costimulate Jurkat T cells, we added TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 agonists to our assay. Addition of TLR2 agonist Pam3CSK4 and TLR4 agonist LPS even at a high concentration of 1 μg/ml failed to enhance IL-2 secretion, while the TLR5 agonist flagellin was able to costimulate Jurkat cells (Fig. 2A). The enhancement of IL-2 secretion was found at a wide range of concentration of flagellin, ranging from pg/ml to μg/ml (data not shown). We further examined the expression of TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 mRNAs in Jurkat cells. Only TLR5 mRNA was expressed in Jurkat cells, whereas TLR2 and TLR4 were not detected at mRNA level using gene specific primers (Fig. 2B). The pcDNA plasmid inserted with complete coding sequence of TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 was used as positive controls for the primers (Fig. 2B). Hsp70 Activates NF-κB in a Manner Similar to Flagellin−We further examined the ability of TLR agonists and heat shock proteins to stimulate NF-κB activation in the luciferase reporter gene assay in Jurkat cells (Fig. 3). Flagellin but not Pam3CSK4 nor LPS activated the NF-κB promoter on the firefly luciferase reporter plasmid through endogenous TLRs of Jurkat cells (Fig. 3A). BpHsp70 activated the NF-κB promoter in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). NF-κB activation was also induced by MtbHsp70 at the concentrations of micrograms/ml (Fig. 3C). However, there was no activation upon the addition of either BpHsp60 or MbHsp65 (data not shown). Thus, the Hsp70 species behaved similarly as flagellin in terms of inducing NF-κB activation. Presence of Contaminating Flagellin in Recombinant Hsp70 Preparations−To determine whether the ability of Hsp70 to costimulate Jurkat cells is independent of the effect of possible contaminating flagellin even in minute amounts, we expressed BpHsp70 protein in the E. coli strain NK9375, whose fliC gene is in-frame deleted (15.Bates D. Epstein J. Boye E. Fahrner K. Berg H. Kleckner N. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 380-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The absence of fliC gene in NK9375 was confirmed in colony PCR using gene specific primers (Fig. 4A). To verify that BpHsp70 expressed in NK9375 (ffBpHsp70) was truly flagellin-free, we transfected HEK293T cells with pTLR5 plasmid or control vector pcDNA and incubated the cells with this protein. ffBpHsp70 was unable to activate NF-κB in HEK 293T cells overexpressing TLR5, whereas BpHsp70 and MtbHsp70 retained their effectiveness in NF-κB activation (Fig. 4B). This shows that the ability of Hsp70 to activate NF-κB through TLR5 is due to contaminating flagellin in the recombinant protein preparations. Flagellin-free Hsp70 Loses Its Ability to Costimulate Human T Cells−We next examined the ability of the flagellin-free (ff) Hsp70 to activate NF-κB and costimulate Jurkat T cells. We found that ffBpHsp70 could not activate NF-κB promoter in Jurkat cells compared with BpHsp70 (Fig. 5A). The costimulation of Jurkat cells by BpHsp70 was also abrogated in ffBpHsp70 (Fig. 5B). ffBpHsp70 did not increase IL-2 secretion even at the concentration of 10 μg/ml (data not shown). Therefore, flagellin is the contaminant in Hsp70 proteins that is crucial in inducing IL-2 secretion and NF-κB activation in Jurkat cells. We next isolated CD4+ T cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and costimulated T cells in an anti-CD3-coated plate with flagellin, BpHsp70, or ffBpHsp70 for 24 h. The enhanced IL-2 production was found in cells costimulated by flagellin and BpHsp70 but not in those costimulated by ffBpHsp70 (Fig. 5C). The results were consistent with those found in Jurkat cells and verified the role of flagellin as the contaminant in Hsp70 to induce IL-2 secretion in human T cells. Having shown that Hsp70 did not directly stimulate T cells, we also determined whether it was able to regulate the response of Jurkat cells to various TLR agonists. No difference in IL-2 secretion was found between the stimulations of TLR agonists alone or in the presence of 1 or 5 μg/ml of flagellin free BpHsp70 (see the supplemental figure). This clearly showed that BpHsp70 did not modulate IL-2 production in the response of Jurkat cells to TLR agonists. Heat shock proteins are molecular chaperones known for their participation in the assembly and disassembly of proteins (20.Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3607) Google Scholar). In addition, they have also been found to bind peptides and chaperone them for better presentation on antigen presenting cells to elicit peptide-specific CTL responses (21.Srivastava P. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). What has been more controversial is the purported ability of heat shock proteins to activate antigen presenting cells directly akin to the action of cytokines. Several studies had shown that the activating ability of Hsp60 and Hsp70 was due to endotoxin contamination and the usual heat inactivation control of Hsp was invalid as it also abrogated the activity of low concentrations of LPS (4.Bausinger H. Lipsker D. Ziylan U. Manie S. Briand J.P. Cazenave J.P. Muller S. Haeuw J.F. Ravanat C. de la Salle H. Hanau D. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 3708-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 5.Gao B. Tsan M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 174-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 6.Gao B. Tsan M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22523-22529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Furthermore, human Hsp60 has been shown to bind LPS specifically in a saturable manner through the binding motif LKGK (22.Habich C. Kempe K. van der Zee R. Rumenapf R. Akiyama H. Kolb H. Burkart V. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 1298-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Besides the possibility of LPS contamination in Hsps, LPS-associated molecules as well as other PAMPs could also be a potential source of contamination. Our results with the activation of T cells by Hsp60 and Hsp70 show that only bacterial Hsp70 is contaminated with flagellin but not Hsp60. This shows that intrinsic differences exist between Hsp70 and Hsp60 family proteins in their biochemical properties and their ability to bind flagellin. Commercial preparations of the MtbHsp70 also contain flagellin. We did not examine whether recombinant mammalian Hsp60 and Hsp70 also have an affinity for flagellin. However, as flagellin is very potent in activating TLR5, care has to be taken to remove even traces of flagellin before examining the activation on various cell types. After producing our recombinant BpHsp70 in E. coli strain lacking flagellin, we completely abrogated the ability of the protein to activate NF-κB and costimulate Jurkat T cells. All the costimulatory activity could be ascribed to flagellin, in agreement with recent studies showing the ability of flagellin to costimulate Jurkat T cells and primary CD4+ T cells. Flagellin at nanogram levels was able to costimulate T cells to make IFN-γ (23.Caron G. Duluc D. Fremaux I. Jeannin P. David C. Gascan H. Delneste Y. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 1551-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) and IL-2 (24.Crellin N.K. Garcia R.V. Hadisfar O. Allan S.E. Steiner T.S. Levings M.K. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 8051-8059Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In our studies, flagellin at picogram levels could efficiently costimulate Jurkat T cells to make IL-2. This raises a particular point of concern. In studies where Hsps were shown to enhance CTL differentiation and activity, antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells were co-cultured with T cells in the presence of antigen and Hsps. Since human dendritic cells and T cells do express TLR5, it is important to ensure that the T cell activity observed was not due to a costimulatory effect of flagellin-contaminated Hsp nor due to a direct stimulation of the dendritic cells through TLR5 by flagellin. Flagellin has been shown to mature human dendritic cells and stimulate their production of chemokines (25.Means T.K. Hayashi F. Smith K.D. Aderem A. Luster A.D. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 5165-5175Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The same caution has to be applied to studies involving immunization of Hsp proteins as adjuvants in mice because flagellin is known to be a potent adjuvant in vivo (26.Lee S.E. Kim S.Y. Jeong B.C. Kim Y.R. Bae S.J. Ahn O.S. Lee J.J. Song H.C. Kim J.M. Choy H.E. Chung S.S. Kweon M.N. Rhee J.H. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 27.Honko A.N. Sriranganathan N. Lees C.J. Mizel S.B. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 1113-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). This is not to discount the ability of Hsps to stimulate the innate immune system. MacAry et al. (12.MacAry P.A. Javid B. Floto R.A. Smith K.G. Oehlmann W. Singh M. Lehner P.J. Immunity. 2004; 20: 95-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) had shown that mycobacterial Hsp70 could induce an intracellular calcium oscillation in dendritic cells not seen in the response to LPS or other TLR agonists. The same research group recently reported that mycobacterial Hsp70 signaled through the CCR5 chemokine receptor to stimulate dendritic cells (28.Floto R.A. MacAry P.A. Bonama J.M. Tan S.M. Kanpmann B. Hair J.R. Oh S.H. Houben E.N.G. Pieters J. Day C. Oehlmann W. Singh M. Smith K.G.C. Lehner P.J. Science. 2006; 314: 454-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Others had expressed mammalian Hsp60 on the surface of eukaryotic cells and still showed activation of T cells (10.Osterloh A. Meier-Stiegen F. Veit A. Fleischer B. von Bonin A. Breloer M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47906-47911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). As the binding ability of Hsps has been expanded with our description of flagellin contamination, one still needs to be cautious about the possibility of Hsps binding to other contaminants of bacterial origin that may not signal through the classical TLR signaling pathway or to endogenous PAMPs. An endogenous PAMP that had been described is uric acid (29.Shi Y. Evans J.E. Rock K.L. Nature. 2003; 425: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1396) Google Scholar) or, more accurately, monosodium urate crystals (30.Rock K.L. Hearn A. Chen C.J. Shi Y. Springer Semin. Immunopathol. 2005; 26: 231-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus, our studies have shown for the first time that flagellin contamination of recombinant Hsp70 preparations could contribute to observed stimulatory effect of Hsp on immune cells. As flagellin is a protein molecule, the usual controls of boiling or treatment with proteinase K will also abrogate the activity of flagellin. To exclude the possibility of flagellin contamination, it is critical that recombinant proteins are produced in E. coli strains not expressing flagellin. Download .pdf (.05 MB) Help with pdf files"

Animal models exhibiting altered Na/Ca exchanger expression display abnormal cardiac phenotypes. In humans, elevated Na/Ca exchanger expression/activity is linked with pathophysiological conditions including arrhythmia and heart failure. Whereas the molecular mechanisms underlying Na/Ca exchanger biophysical properties are widely studied and generally well characterized, the cellular pathways and molecular partners underlying the specialized membrane localization of Na/Ca exchanger in cardiac tissue are essentially unknown. In this report, we present the first direct evidence for a protein pathway required for Na/Ca exchanger localization and stability in primary cardiomyocytes. We define the minimal structural requirements on ankyrin-B for direct Na/Ca exchanger interactions. Moreover, using ankyrin-B mutants that lack Na/Ca exchanger binding activity, and primary cardiomyocytes with reduced ankyrin-B expression, we demonstrate that direct interaction with the membrane adaptor ankyrin-B is required for the localization and post-translational stability of Na/Ca exchanger 1 in neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes. These results raise exciting new questions regarding potentially dynamic roles for ankyrin proteins in the biogenesis and maintenance of specialized membrane domains in excitable cells.

Moreover, using ankyrin-B mutants that lack Na/Ca exchanger binding activity, and primary cardiomyocytes with reduced ankyrin-B expression, we demonstrate that direct interaction with the membrane adaptor ankyrin-B is required for the localization and post-translational stability of Na/Ca exchanger 1 in neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes. These results raise exciting new questions regarding potentially dynamic roles for ankyrin proteins in the biogenesis and maintenance of specialized membrane domains in excitable cells. Normal cardiac function requires the coordinate activity of a collection of ion channels and transporters to regulate myocyte depolarization and repolarization. One key component of cardiomyocyte excitation-contraction coupling is the precise cellular management of cytosolic calcium concentrations during systole and diastole. During cardiac depolarization, extracellular Ca2+ enters the cytosol via the L-type Ca2+ channel. This inward calcium current triggers calcium-induced calcium release through ryanodine receptors (RyR2) on the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). 3The abbreviations used are: SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein; WT, wild type.3The abbreviations used are: SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein; WT, wild type. This massive release of calcium from internal stores is essential for cardiomyocyte contraction. For proper myocyte relaxation, the influx of calcium into the cytosol must be precisely balanced by extrusion of calcium from the cytosol. Dysfunction in cardiomyocyte calcium-handling mechanisms may lead to a number of cardiac phenotypes including ext9rasystoles and arrhythmia, apoptosis, and/or heart failure (1.Birkeland J.A. Sejersted O.M. Taraldsen T. Sjaastad I. Scand. Cardiovasc. J. 2005; 39: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 2.Shannon T.R. Bers D.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1015: 28-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Whereas calcium is actively transported into the SR via the SR Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA2), a secondary mechanism for cytosolic calcium extrusion is the plasma membrane Na/Ca exchanger, which transports calcium down its concentration gradient in exchange for sodium (3.Nicoll D.A. Longoni S. Philipson K.D. Science. 1990; 250: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). In addition to regulating calcium efflux, the Na/Ca exchanger may also function in reverse mode to cause inward Ca2+ flux during the initial depolarization of the myocyte (4.Leblanc N. Hume J.R. Science. 1990; 248: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar).The cardiac Na/Ca exchanger is a nine transmembrane protein encoded by human NCX1. Normal function of the Na/Ca exchanger requires proper biophysical properties and precise localization at excitable cardiac membranes including the sarcolemma and cardiomyocyte transverse-tubule surfaces (5.Chen F.

Whereas the biophysical features of the cardiac Na/Ca exchanger are widely studied and well defined (10.Kang T.M. Hilgemann D.W.

Rev. 2001; 81: 1353-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Multiple lines of evidence predict a role for ankyrin polypeptides in the proper localization and stability of the Na/Ca exchanger at the cardiomyocyte plasma membrane. Ankyrin polypeptides directly bind to the cardiac Na/Ca exchanger with high affinity (14.Li Z.P. Burke E.P. Frank J.S. Bennett V. Philipson K.D. J. Biol.

Moreover, reduction of ankyrin-B expression (product of ANK2) in mice homozygous (ankyrin-B-/-) or heterozygous (ankyrin-B+/-) for a null mutation in ankyrin-B display decreased expression and abnormal localization of the Na/Ca exchanger 1 in both neonatal and adult cardiomyocytes (15.Mohler P.J.

Whereas these data predict a role for ankyrin-B in Na/Ca exchanger membrane localization, there is no clear evidence to support a direct role for ankyrin-B in Na/Ca exchanger membrane expression and stability.Here we define the molecular requirements of 220-kD ankyrin-B for cardiac Na/Ca exchanger 1 binding. Moreover, we report that direct interaction between ankyrin-B and Na/Ca exchanger is essential for the expression, localization, and post-translational stability of Na/Ca exchanger in primary cardiomyocytes. Specifically, we show that direct ankyrin-B-Na/Ca exchanger binding requires multiple charged tips on the β-hairpin loops, which connect adjacent α-helices of specific ANK repeats on the ankyrin-B membrane-binding domain. These data demonstrate that the Na/Ca exchanger binding site is distinct from the binding site for the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R) (19.Mohler P.J. Davis J.Q. Davis L.H. Hoffman J.A. Michaely P. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12980-12987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Using ankyrin-B mutants and ankyrin-B+/- cardiomyocytes, we demonstrate that direct ankyrin-B-Na/Ca exchanger interactions are necessary for proper localization of the Na/Ca exchanger. Moreover, metabolic labeling experiments reveal that direct ankyrin-B-Na/Ca exchanger interactions are not only required for membrane localization, but are also required for post-translational stability of Na/Ca exchanger in cardiomyocytes. Finally, we present data that ankyrin-B interactions with Na/Ca exchanger 1 are likely important for normal cardiomyocyte regulation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals−Mice used in these studies were neonatal (postnatal day 1 or 2) WT C57BL/6 mice and ankyrin-B+/- littermates (C57BL/6). Animals were handled according to approved protocols and animal welfare regulations of the Animal Care and Use Committee.Immunofluorescence−Neonatal cardiomyocytes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and fixed in warm 2% paraformaldehyde (37 °C). Cells were blocked/permeabilized in PBS containing 0.075% Triton X-100 and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and incubated in primary antisera over-night at 4 °C. Following washes (PBS plus 0.1% Triton X-100), cells were incubated in secondary antisera (Alexa 488, 568; Molecular Probes) for 4 h at 4 °C and mounted using Vecta-shield (Vector) and No. 1 coverslip. Images were collected on a Zeiss 510 Meta confocal microscope (63 power oil, 1.4 NA, pinhole equals 1.0 Airy Disc or 40 power water, 1.2 NA, pinhole equals 1.0 Airy Disc) using Carl Zeiss Imaging software. Both channels were collected on PMT3 using sequential scans to eliminate channel bleed-through. Identical imaging protocols (laser strength, pinhole size, gain, etc.) were used when comparing Na/Ca exchanger intensity in myocytes transfected with ankyrin-B mutants. Images were imported into Adobe Photoshop for cropping and linear contrast adjustment.Ankyrin-B and Na/Ca Exchanger 1 Constructs−GFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B mutant constructs were generated using standard molecular techniques and QuikChange Mutagenesis (Stratagene). Loop mutations were designed to replace ANK repeat β-hairpin loop tip residues with two alanine residues (19.Mohler P.J. Davis J.Q. Davis L.H. Hoffman J.A. Michaely P. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12980-12987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The mutated region was subcloned into a native GFP-220-kD ankyrin-B plasmid, and the plasmid was completely sequenced to verify that no additional mutations were introduced. Mutants were sequenced and expressed in HEK293 cells to confirm full-length protein expression. Full-length human NCX1 cDNA was cloned from a human heart library into pBacPak9 (Clontech) using standard molecular techniques and sequenced to ensure that no mutations were introduced by the cloning procedure.Binding Studies−GFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B and mutants were expressed in HEK293 cells and purified using affinity-purified GFP Ig coupled to protein A-agarose beads. Briefly, cells were lysed in homogenization buffer plus 1.0% Triton X-100 and 0.5% deoxycholate (16.Mohler P.J. Davis J.Q. Bennett V. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e423Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The extract was centrifuged at 100,000 × g, and the supernatant was incubated with GFP affinity-purified Ig coupled to protein A-Sepharose. The beads were washed with homogenization buffer + 1.0% Triton X-100. Purified proteins were incubated with 10 μg of affinity-purified GFP Ig or control Ig coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with homogenization buffer + 1.0% Triton X-100. Protein bound to each mutant GFP-220-kD ankyrin-B was eluted, analyzed by immunoblot, normalized for relative GFP ankyrin-B expression, and then compared with WT GFP-220-kD ankyrin-B binding.Statistics−When appropriate, data were analyzed using a two-tailed Student’s t test, and values less than p < 0.05 were considered significant. Values are expressed as the mean ± S.D.Na/Ca Exchanger Protein Purification−For purification of Na/Ca exchanger, a His tag was engineered to the C terminus. Human Na/Ca exchanger 1 was expressed in SF21 insect cells using a generated recombinant baculovirus as described (16.Mohler P.J. Davis J.Q. Bennett V. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e423Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The Na/Ca exchanger was purified using Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose as described (16.Mohler P.J. Davis J.Q. Bennett V. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e423Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar).Metabolic Labeling/Pulse-Chase Experiments−Neonatal cardiomyocytes were incubated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) without methionine for 2 h followed by a 1-3-h pulse period in DMEM containing [35S]methionine (100 μCi/ml) at 37 °C. Cells were washed and chased in normal medium plus 2 mm methionine for defined times (up to 72 h). Detergent-soluble lysates were prepared and NCX1 was immunoprecipitated using affinity-purified NCX1-specific monoclonal Ig (R3F1). Equal counts were immunoprecipitated to correct for small variations in protein concentrations. Radiolabeled Na/Ca exchanger was quantitated for each time point by phosphorimaging.Neonatal Cardiomyocytes−To generate the primary cardiomyocyte cultures, hearts were dissected from P1 or P2 mice and placed in 1 ml of Ham’s F-10. Atrial tissue was removed, and the ventricular chambers were rinsed to remove any remaining blood. Hearts were transferred into 1.5 ml of 0.05% trypsin, 200 μm EDTA in Ham’s F-10 medium (Mediatech). Hearts were minced into ∼20 small pieces using forceps and small scissors and incubated in the trypsin/EDTA medium at 37 °C. Following 15 min, the heart pieces were mixed by a Pasteur pipette and incubated for an additional 15 min. A mixture of 200 μl of soybean trypsin inhibitor (2 mg/ml; Worthington) and 200 μl of collagenase (0.2 mg/ml; 1980 units/mg; Sigma) was incubated with the cells for 35-50 min at 37 °C. The cell suspension was pelleted, resuspended in “Complete Medium” (40% DMEM, 40% Ham’s F-10, 20% fetal calf serum), and plated on plastic dishes. Following 5 h, the non-adhered cells (cardiomyocytes) were aspirated from the plate, pelleted, resuspended in Complete Medium, and plated on coverslips or Mattek tissue culture plates (fibronectin-coated; Roche Applied Science). Twenty-four hours later, the cardiomyocytes were washed with Ham’s F-10 and the Complete Medium was replaced with “Defined Medium” to prevent the overgrowth of fibroblasts. 100× Defined Medium consists of 100 μg/ml insulin, 500 μg/ml transferrin, 100 nm LiCl, 100 nm NaSeO4, and 10 nm thyroxine. Following 3.5 days in culture, cardiomyocytes were transfected as previously described (20.Mohler P.J. Gramolini A.O. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10599-10607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and imaged 42-56 h later.Immunoblots−Following 5 days in culture, whole cell lysates were obtained from primary wild-type and ankyrin-B+/- neonatal cardiomyocytes. Equal quantities of protein lysate (pooled from the myocyte cultures of multiple mouse hearts/genotype) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (3-8% Tris acetate gels) and immunoblot using antibodies specific for ankyrin-B (20.Mohler P.J. Gramolini A.O. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10599-10607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) or NCX1 (R3F1). Parallel immunoblots were performed using an ankyrin-unrelated protein antibody (NHERF1, Sigma) to confirm equal protein loading.RESULTSDirect Interaction between Ankyrin-B and Na/Ca Exchanger 1 Requires β-Hairpin Loop Tips of ANK Repeats 16-18−We previously demonstrated that Na/Ca exchanger 1 co-immunoprecipitates with 220-kD ankyrin-B from detergent-soluble lysates of rat heart using affinity-purified ankyrin-B Ig (15.Mohler P.J. Schott J.J. Gramolini A.O. Dilly K.W. Guatimosim S. duBell W.H. Song L.S. Haurogne K. Kyndt F. Ali M.E. Rogers T.B. Lederer W.J. Escande D. Le Marec H. Bennett V. Nature. 2003; 421: 634-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar, 16.Mohler P.J. Davis J.Q. Bennett V. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e423Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated the reverse that 220-kD ankyrin-B co-immunoprecipitates with Na/Ca exchanger 1 from detergentsoluble fractions of rat heart using affinity-purified Na/Ca exchanger Ig (16.Mohler P.J. Davis J.Q. Bennett V. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e423Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Ankyrin-B is co-localized with Na/Ca exchanger 1 over cardiac transverse tubules (16.Mohler P.J. Davis J.Q. Bennett V. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e423Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mice with reduced ankyrin-B expression display reduced Na/Ca exchanger 1 expression (15.Mohler P.J. Schott J.J. Gramolini A.O. Dilly K.W. Guatimosim S. duBell W.H. Song L.S. Haurogne K. Kyndt F. Ali M.E. Rogers T.B. Lederer W.J. Escande D. Le Marec H. Bennett V. Nature. 2003; 421: 634-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar), as well as aberrant localization of the transporter over the transverse tubule network (15.Mohler P.J. Schott J.J. Gramolini A.O. Dilly K.W. Guatimosim S. duBell W.H. Song L.S. Haurogne K. Kyndt F. Ali M.E. Rogers T.B. Lederer W.J. Escande D. Le Marec H. Bennett V. Nature. 2003; 421: 634-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar, 16.Mohler P.J. Davis J.Q. Bennett V. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e423Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). To establish whether direct interactions between ankyrin-B and Na/Ca exchanger are required for the membrane localization of cardiac Na/Ca exchanger 1, we first determined the structural requirements on 220-kD ankyrin-B for Na/Ca exchanger binding activity.220-kD ankyrin-B contains four major structural domains including a membrane-binding domain (24 ANK repeats), spectrin-binding domain, death domain, and C-terminal domain (Fig. 1A). Our previous experiments implicate the membrane-binding domain as necessary for high affinity direct interactions between ankyrin-B and Na/Ca exchanger (16.Mohler P.J. Davis J.Q. Bennett V. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e423Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) (kDa equals 5 nm); therefore, we focused on this domain in our binding experiments.To assess the structural requirements on ankyrin-B for direct Na/Ca exchanger 1 binding, we used a series of ankyrin-B membrane-binding domain mutants designed based on the crystal structure of the closely related ankyrin-R membrane-binding domain (21.Michaely P. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Anderson R.G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6387-6396Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). This structure consisted of ANK repeats 13-24 and revealed that the ANK repeats fold as pairs of antiparallel α-helices connected with a β-hairpin loop (21.Michaely P. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Anderson R.G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6387-6396Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The ANK repeats come together to form a large super helix, which surrounds a central cavity (21.Michaely P. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Anderson R.G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6387-6396Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Based on this structure, as well as other structures of proteins that contain consecutive ANK repeats, the β-hairpin loops between the α-helices are highly accessible to the solvent. Moreover, the tips of these β-hairpin loops are highly variable and have been implicated in mediating a number of protein interactions (22.Sedgwick S.G. Smerdon S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 311-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), including the interaction of ankyrin-B with the InsP3 receptor (19.Mohler P.J. Davis J.Q. Davis L.H. Hoffman J.A. Michaely P. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12980-12987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).The first series of ankyrin-B mutants harbored two alanine substitutions in the variable β-hairpin loop tips connecting each pair of ANK repeats within the membrane-binding domain (ANK repeats 1-24, Fig. 1B). Mutagenesis was performed in the context of GFP-tagged ankyrin-B (220 kD). Mutant plasmids were completely sequenced to verify that no additional mutations were introduced during PCR amplification. Wild-type ankyrin-B, as well as each GFP ankyrin-B mutant was expressed in HEK293 cells. Expressed proteins were immunopurified from the detergent-soluble fraction of the cells using immobilized affinity-purified GFP Ig and incubated with purified Na/Ca exchanger 1 derived from baculoviral expression (see “Experimental Procedures”). The quantity of pure Na/Ca exchanger 1 bound to each mutant was determined by immunoblot using an affinity-purified Na/Ca exchanger 1 Ig. Using similar methods, we determined the relative level of GFP-ankyrin-B mutant expression for each data point. The amount of Na/Ca exchanger 1 bound to each ankyrin-B mutant was corrected for relative to GFP-ankyrin-B expression. The mutant ankyrin-B constructs bound to Na/Ca exchanger 1 at levels similar to that of wild-type ankyrin-B (n = 5, p > 0.05). These results demonstrate that binding activity between ankyrin-B for Na/Ca exchanger 1 is not mediated by an individual ANK repeat β-hairpin loop (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Ankyrin-B single ANK repeat loop tip mutants do not disrupt ankyrin-B-Na/Ca exchanger interactions. Relative binding (compared with WT GFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B) of single β-hairpin loop tip mutants isolated from HEK293 cells with purified Na/Ca exchanger 1 (n = 5; p < 0.05). We did not observe significant binding of GFP to purified Na/Ca exchanger in our assays.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because the direct interaction between ankyrin-B and the InsP3 receptor requires multiple β-hairpin loop tips (19.Mohler P.J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 12980-12987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), we next tested the binding of purified Na/Ca exchanger to a series of ankyrin-B membrane-binding domain mutants, which harbor alanine substitutions in various combinations of consecutive ANK repeat β-hairpin loop tips (e.g. ANK repeats 5-6, 4-6, 3-6, 2-6, 1-6; see Fig. 1C). Binding analysis was performed as described above using GFP-ankyrin-B mutants expressed and immunopurified from HEK293 cells. Mutations to the β-hairpin loop tips of multiple ANK repeats including 1-6, 7-12, and 19-24 had no effect on ankyrin-B binding to purified Na/Ca exchanger 1 (Fig. 3). In contrast, mutations to the β-hairpin loop tips of consecutive ANK repeats 13-18 significantly reduced Na/Ca exchanger 1 binding to ankyrin-B. Further analysis revealed that the binding domain between Na/Ca exchanger 1 and ankyrin-B resides across the β-hairpin loop tips of ANK repeats 16-18 (Fig. 3). These results establish that multiple β-hairpin loop tips are required for the direct binding of ankyrin-B to the Na/Ca exchanger. Moreover, these results demonstrate that the Na/Ca exchanger associates with the membrane-binding domain of ankyrin-B on a site distinct from the InsP3 receptor binding site (Figs. 3 and 4).FIGURE 3Ankyrin-B-Na/Ca exchanger interactions require β-hairpin loop tips of ANK repeats 16-18.

Gray bars (R22-24, R21-24, R20-24, R19-24) denote ankyrin-B mutants that lack binding activity for InsP3 receptor (19.Mohler P.J. Davis J.Q. Davis L.H. Hoffman J.A. Michaely P. Bennett V. J. Biol.

Specifically, in neonatal cardiomyocytes derived from ankyrin-B+/- mice, Na/Ca exchanger is expressed only at cellular sites where ankyrin-B expression is not reduced (see arrows in Fig. 5B). Abnormal cellular phenotypes are rescued by exogenous expression of wild-type ankyrin-B cDNA (Fig. 5C), but not with ankyrin-B variants harboring loss-of-function mutations associated with human arrhythmia (15.Mohler P.J.

Accordingly, we used this cardiomyocyte ankyrin-B rescue assay to determine whether direct interaction between Na/Ca exchanger and ankyrin-B is required for the proper localization of Na/Ca exchanger in cardiomyocytes.

Recent biochemical evidence indicates that the UGT proteins may oligomerize in the membrane, but conclusive evidence is still lacking. In the present study, we have used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to study UGT1A oligomerization in live cells. This technique demonstrated that UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A7, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, and UGT1A10 self-oligomerize (homodimerize). Heterodimer interactions were also explored, and it was determined that UGT1A1 was capable of binding with UGT1A3, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A7, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, and UGT1A10. In addition to the in vivo FRET analysis, UGT1A protein-protein interactions were demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Co-expression of hemagglutinin-tagged and cyan fluorescent protein-tagged UGT1A proteins, followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-hemagglutinin beads, illustrated the potential of each UGT1A protein to homodimerize. Co-immunoprecipitation results also confirmed that UGT1A1 was capable of forming heterodimer complexes with all of the UGT1A proteins, corroborating the FRET results in live cells. These preliminary studies suggest that the UGT1A family of proteins form oligomerized complexes in the membrane, a property that may influence function and substrate selectivity.

UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) 2The abbreviations used are: UGT, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; CYP, cytochrome P450; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. are type I membrane-bound proteins localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and play an essential role in the elimination and detoxification of drugs, xenobiotics, and a host of endogenous compounds such as steroids, bile acids, bilirubin, and fatty acids (1.Dutton G.J. Glucuronidation of Drugs and Other Compounds. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1980Google Scholar). This process proceeds by the transfer of glucuronic acid from UDP-glucuronic acid to targeted substrates. The addition of the polar glucuronic acid to the lipophilic substrates increases the metabolite's water solubility, thereby facilitating excretion into water compartments of the cell for excretion into either the urine or bile. The UGTs are classified into two gene families, UGT1 and UGT2 (2.Mackenzie P.I. Owens I.S. Burchell B. Bock K.W. Bairoch A. Belanger A. Fournel-Gigleux S. Green M. Hum D.W. Iyanagi T. Lancet D.

The UGT2 subfamily of proteins is encoded by individual genes located in a gene cluster on chromosome 4 at 4q13-q21 (3.Monaghan G. Clarke D.J. Povey S. See C.G. Boxer M. Burchell B.

These are composed of the UGT2A1 and UGT2A2, along with the UGT2B members, which include UGT2B4, 2B7, 2B10, 2B11, 2B15, 2B17, and 2B28. The UGT2A proteins are localized to the olfactory system and are felt to be important in eliminating olfactory stimuli (6.Heydel J. LeClerc S. Bernard P. Pelczar H. Gradinaru D. Magdalou J. Minn A. Artur Y. Goudonnet H. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 90: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The UGT2B proteins are involved in the metabolism of endogenous compounds such as bile acids (7.Monaghan G. Burchell B. Boxer M. Mamm. Genome. 1997; 9: 692-694Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar), steroids (8.Hum D.W. Belanger A. Levesque E. Barbier O. Beaulieu M. Albert C. Vallee M. Guillemette C. Tchernof A. Turgeon D. Dubois S.

Gauthier S. Labrie F. Barbier O. Belanger A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 908-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In contrast, the UGT1 locus is located on chromosome 2q37 (11.Harding D. Jeremiah S.J. Povey S. Burchell B. Ann. Hum. Genet. 1990; 54: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and its gene products are linked to the metabolism of exogenous compounds, although UGT1A1 is the only UGT capable of conjugating the heme byproduct bilirubin (12.Bosma P.J.

The UGT1 locus encodes nine functional UGT1A proteins (UGT1A1 and UGT1A3 through UGT1A10) (2.Mackenzie P.I. Owens I.S. Burchell B. Bock K.W. Bairoch A. Belanger A. Fournel-Gigleux S. Green M.

Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The UGT1 locus is organized with a tandem array of 9 open reading frames encoding each of the exon 1 regions of the respective UGT1A proteins, flanked by open reading frames encoding exons 2–5. Based upon the start of transcription, each respective first exon sequence is processed with common exons 2–5, resulting in the synthesis of the 9 UGT1A gene products. Thus, each UGT1A protein is composed of a variable amino region (exon 1) and an identical carboxyl region (exons 2–5) (13.Ritter J.K. Chen F. Sheen Y.Y. Tran H.M. Kimura S. Yeatman M.T. Owens I.S. J.

The carboxyl region of the UGT1A proteins displays high sequence identity to the same region on the UGT2 proteins, implicating the conserved function of this region for recognition and binding of UDP-glucuronic acid. Within the UGT2 family of proteins, both the amino-terminal and the carboxyl regions have been shown to play an important role in substrate specificity (16.Mackenzie P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3432-3435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Li Q. Lou X. Peyronneau M.-A. Straub P.O. Tukey R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3272-3279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Preliminary findings suggest that the family of UGTs may be highly organized within the ER, existing as monomeric proteins as well as oligomers in homodimeric and heterodimeric states. In rat liver microsomes, UGT2B1 was shown to exist as a functional dimer, with evidence that the amino-terminal region was important in the protein-protein interaction of the UGT (18.Meech R. Mackenzie P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26913-26917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In addition, UGT2B1 was also shown to directly heterodimerize with the family of UGT1A proteins (19.Ikushiro S. Emi Y. Iyanagi T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7154-7161Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), although identification of the UGT1A proteins involved in the oligomerization was not characterized. Cross-linking studies using expressed human UGT1A1, in addition to a two-hybrid analysis, demonstrated that UGT1A1 formed a homodimer complex. It was also observed that the reduction of disulfide bond formation was shown to have little impact on UGT1A1 dimerization and mutagenesis of cysteine 223 to a tyrosine completely abolished UGT1A1 oligomerization, as did the deletion of a membraneembedded region spanning amino acids 152–180. Consistent with the UGT2B1 findings, the amino-terminal region was found to be important for UGT1A1 dimerization (20.Ghosh S.S. Sappal B.S. Kalpana G.V. Lee S.W. Chowdhury J.R. Chowdhury N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42108-42115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The focus of the current study is to explore the intermolecular interactions of the UGTs in living cells using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). FRET is a non-invasive spectroscopic method that can be used in live cells to monitor spatial and temporal intermolecular interactions of chimeric proteins that have acceptor and donor fluorophores attached (21.Clegg R.M. Wang X.F. Herman B. Fluorescence Imaging Spectroscopy and Microscopy. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996Google Scholar). FRET involves the transfer of energy from a donor fluorophore in its excited state to an acceptor fluorophore by a nonradiative dipole-dipole interaction (22.Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983Crossref Google Scholar) and is only able to occur if the proteins reside within angstroms from each other. To further complement the in vivo analysis of UGT protein-protein interactions by FRET, co-immunoprecipitation experiments provided additional biochemical evidence to support the existence of the UGT1A proteins forming homodimeric or heterodimeric aggregates in the membrane. Generation of the pUGT1A-CFP, pUGT1A-YFP, and pUGT1A-HA Plasmids−For the following study monomeric cyan fluorescent protein (mCFP) and monomeric yellow fluorescent protein (mYFP) variants were chosen as the donor and acceptor fluorophores, respectively. Because of the intrinsic property of the wild type CFP and YFP proteins to spontaneously aggregate at high concentrations, we elected to use the monomeric forms of the fluorophores, which would prevent spontaneous aggregation of the fluorophores in the membrane (23.Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar). mCFP and mYFP plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. Roger Tsien (University of California, San Diego). Both mCFP and mYFP were amplified by PCR with the sense primer (5′-ggatccaatggtgagcaagggcgaggag-3′) containing a BamHI site (underlined) and the antisense primer (5′-gcggccgctttacttgtacagctcgtccatgcc-3′) containing a NotI site (underlined). The mCFP and mYFP PCR products were subcloned into pCR 2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The amplified TOPO clones containing mCFP and mYFP were digested with BamHI and NotI restriction enzymes and each insert purified. The pEGFP-N1 expression vector (Clontech), which contains the green fluorescent protein gene flanked by a multicloning site, was digested with BamHI and NotI to remove the green fluorescent protein portion. The mCFP and mYFP inserts were ligated into the linearized pEGFP-N1 expression vector and the resulting plasmids identified as mCFP-N1 and mYFP-N1. To make the chimeric UGT1A1-CFP and UGT1A1-YFP proteins, UGT1A1 was amplified by PCR with a sense primer (5′-ctcgagATGgctgtggagtcccag-3′) containing an XhoI site (underlined) followed by an initiation ATG codon and an antisense primer (5′-ggatccccaatgggtcttggatttg-3′) with a BamHI site (underlined) followed by a mutated stop codon shown in bold. After the cloning of UGT1A1 PCR product into the pCR 2.1-TOPO vector, the insert was removed, purified by digestion with XhoI and BamHI, and subcloned into the XhoI and BamHI sites in the mCFP-N1 and mYFP-N1 plasmids, creating the pUGT1A1-CFP and pUGT1A1-YFP plasmids. To generate the hemagglutinin (HA) recognition sequence fused to the UGT1A1 protein, a UGT1A1-HA fragment was generated by PCR with a sense primer (5′-ctcgagatggctgtggagtcccag-3′) containing an XhoI site (underlined) and antisense primer (5′-ggatcctcaggcataatctggcacatcataagggtattccatccaatgggtcttgggattt-3′) containing a BamHI site (underlined) and the HA sequence in bold. The UGT1A1-HA PCR product was subcloned into pCR 2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and digested with XhoI and BamHI restriction enzymes to remove the insert. The UGT1A1-HA fragment was subcloned into the XhoI and BamHI multiple cloning site of the pcDNA 3.1(-) expression vector to produce the pUGT1A1-HA plasmid. Construction of UGT1A-CFP-, UGT1A-YFP-, and UGT1A-HA-tagged Expression Plasmids−To generate a library of the UGT1A-CFP-, UGT1A-YFP-, and UGT1A-HA-tagged constructs, we took advantage of the feature that all of the UGT1A proteins have a unique exon 1 region and a conserved 2–5 exon region. The pUGT1A1-CFP, pUGT1A1-YFP, and pUGT1A1-HA expression vectors were used to generate all subsequent constructs. This was done by removing the exon 1, exon 2, exon 3, and a portion of the exon 4 region of UGT1A1 from the CFP, YFP, and HA expression vectors and inserting in their place the accompanying regions of the other UGT1A cDNAs. The following procedures were performed for each UGT1A isoform. pUGT1A1-CFP, pUGT1A1-YFP, and pUGT1A1-HA plasmids were each digested with the restriction enzymes NheI (located in the multiple cloning site of each expression vector) and BstEII (located in exon 4 of each UGT1A isoform). Having constructed previously in our laboratory pcDNA 3.1 plasmids expressing UGT1A3, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A7, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, and UGT1A10, each of the UGT1A inserts encoding these regions was isolated by digestion with NheI and BstEII. Each of the UGT1A fragments was subcloned into the linearized pUGT1A1-CFP, pUGT1A1-YFP, and pUGT1A1-HA expression vectors that had the NheI and BstEII fragment removed. In all, 24 UGT1A constructs were made with each expressing a fusion protein with either CFP, YFP, or HA carboxyl-terminal tags. A list of the plasmid constructs is shown in Table 1.TABLE 1Plasmid constructs used in FRET analysis and co-immunoprecipitation studiespUGT1A-HA plasmidspUGT1A-CFP plasmidspUGT1A-YFP plasmids1pUGT1A1-HApUGT1A1-CFPpUGT1A1-YFP2pUGT1A3-HApUGT1A3-CFPpUGT1A3-YFP3pUGT1A4-HApUGT1A4-CFPpUGT1A4-YFP4pUGT1A6-HApUGT1A6-CFPpUGT1A6-YFP5pUGT1A7-HApUGT1A7-CFPpUGT1A7-YFP6pUGT1A8-HApUGT1A8-CFPpUGT1A8-YFP7pUGT1A9-HApUGT1A9-CFPpUGT1A9-YFP8pUGT1A10-HApUGT1A10-CFPpUGT1A10-YFP Open table in a new tab Microscopy and FRET Analysis−COS cells were plated at a density of 3.5 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates and co-transfected with 5 μg of pUGT1A-CFP and 5 μg of pUGT1A-YFP plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After 24 h the live cells were imaged using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 m inverted microscope. Donor (CFP) was excited at 455 nm and fluorescence emission detected in a bandwidth of 440–480 nm (CFP channel). Acceptor (YFP) was excited at 515 nm and fluorescence emission detected in a bandwidth of 530–535 nm (YFP channel). FRET excitation was conducted at 455 nm and fluorescence emission detected in a bandwidth of 530–535 nm (FRET channel). To correct for fluorescence bleed through into the FRET channel, cells transfected with only pUGT1A-CFP were used to determine the Donor correction factor and cells transfected with only pUGT1A-YFP were used to determine the Acceptor correction factor. Images of UGT1ACFP and UGT1AYFP expression in co-transfected cells were sequentially acquired with the Donor (CFP) channel, Acceptor (YFP) channel, and FRET channel under identical conditions. The image obtained with the FRET channel was evaluated using Carl Zeiss AxioVision FRET software and FRET calculated using the Acceptor ratio correction method (24.Youvan D.C. Silva C.M. Bylina J. Coleman W.J. Dilworth M.R. Yang M.M. Bio/Technology. 1997; 3: 1-18Google Scholar). The Acceptor ratio method corrects for the cross-talk from the Donor alone, the Acceptor alone, and background intensity using the following equation: Ac = Fc/(accgv-bgacc), where Ac = FRET concentration as Acceptor ratio and Fc = FRET concentration according to Youvan et al. (24.Youvan D.C. Silva C.M. Bylina J. Coleman W.J. Dilworth M.R. Yang M.M. Bio/Technology. 1997; 3: 1-18Google Scholar) calculated by the equation Fc = (fretgv-bgfret) - cfdon*(dongv-bgdon) - cfacc* (accgc-bgacc), with gv = intensity as gray value, bg = background intensity, cf = correction factor, fret = FRET image, don = Donor image, acc = Acceptor image. FRET efficiency was also analyzed by photobleaching the Acceptor (YFP) and measuring the increase in Donor signal (CFP). Cells co-transfected with pUGT1A1-CFP and pUGT1A1-YFP were initially imaged using the CFP and YFP channels. The same cell was then illuminated using the photobleaching cube (YFP excitation 515 nm) with the laser power set to 100% for 1-min intervals, followed by CFP and YFP image acquisitions. This was repeated every minute over a 10-min time course. To quantify changes in the CFP and YFP fluorescence intensity over the photobleaching time course, selected regions of interest were measured using the Carl Zeiss Axiovision FRET software and quantified using the Siegel evaluation method (25.Siegel R.M. Chan F.K. Zacharias D.A. Swofford R. Holmes K.L. Tsien R.Y. Lenardo M.J. Sci. STKE. 2000; 2000: L1Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The evaluation method uses the following equation: BL = [1-(dongvbef-bgdon-bef)/(dongvaft-bgdon-aft)*100, where BL = FRET concentration by Acceptor bleaching, Don = Donor image, gv = intensity as gray value, bef = before bleaching, aft = after bleaching. Co-immunoprecipitation of Expressed UGT1A Proteins− COS cells were plated at density of 3.5 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates and co-transfected with 5 μg of pUGT1A-HA and 5 μg of pUGT1A-CFP plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 24 h, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for 1 h on ice with 1 ml of 1× radioimmunoprecipitation buffer (0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.25% deoxycholic acid, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with 1% protease mixture inhibitor (Sigma). The lysed cells were centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 × g and the supernatant collected. The entire supernatant from one transfected well was mixed with 30 μl of anti-HA beads (Roche Applied Science) and incubated at 4 °C on a rocker platform overnight. The anti-HA beads were centrifuged for 1 min at 1000 × g and the supernatant discarded. The anti-HA beads were washed three times with 1 ml of cold lysis buffer. The anti-HA beads were then resuspended in 60 μl of electrophoresis sample buffer and heated to 95 °C for 10 min. The beads were centrifuged for 1 min at 1,000 × g and the supernatant collected and used for Western blot analysis. Western Blot Analysis−All Western blots were performed using 4–12% NuPAGE Bis Tris polyacrylamide gels as outlined by the supplier (Invitrogen) and resolved under denaturing conditions (50 mm MOPS, 50 mm Tris base, pH 7.7, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA). The resolved protein was transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane using a semi-dry transfer system (Norvex). The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20 (Tris-buffered saline) for 1 h at room temperature. Each membrane was washed in Tris-buffered saline solution and incubated with an anti-UGT1A antibody, kindly provided by Dr. Alain Belanger (Laval University, Quebec, Canada), in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.02% sodium azide at 4 °C overnight. Membranes were then washed five times with Tris-buffered saline solution and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit secondary antibody at a 1:5000 dilution in Tris-buffered saline solution containing 2% nonfat milk for 1 h of shaking at room temperature. Membranes were washed five times with Tris-buffered saline solution and visualized using Western Lightning Chemiluminescence reagents according to the manufacturer’s instructions (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) followed by exposure to x-ray film (Kodak). Functional Analysis of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase Activity− COS cells were plated at a density of 3.5 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates and transfected with either 2 μg of each plasmid (co-transfection) or 5 μg of plasmid (single transfection) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Whole cell lysates were prepared by resuspending cells in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2 followed by homogenization and sonication. Each catalytic assay was conducted in a 100-μl reaction that contained 350 μg of cellular protein, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.04 μCi of [14C]UDPGA (255.6 pmol/reaction), 8.5 mm saccharolactone, 100 μg of phosphatidylcholine, 0.5 mm UDP-glucuronic acid, and a final concentration of 500 μm for each substrate. The substrate octylgallate was used to determine UGT activity for UGT1A1 and UGT1A3 isoforms, whereas 2-napthol was used for UGT1A7. Each reaction was incubated in a 37 °C water bath for 60 min and then terminated with the addition of 100 μl of cold methanol. The protein was spun down by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 min and 100 μl of the supernatant spotted onto a Whatman glass-backed thin layer chromatography (TLC) plate. Chromatography was performed in a mixture (35:35:10:20 v/v) of n-butanol:acetone:acetic acid:water. Once the solvent front reached 2 cm from the top of the TLC plate, the plate was removed from the tank, dried, and exposed to a phosphor screen (GE Healthcare) overnight. The location of the glucuronides on the plate was identified, and that region of the TLC plate was scraped and placed in scintillation fluid for quantification with a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter LS6500, Fullerton, CA). Determination of FRET Analysis with Expressed UGT1ACFP and UGT1AYFP−To explore intermolecular protein-protein interactions between UGT1A1 proteins in vivo, UGT1A1-CFP-tagged and UGT1A1-YFP-tagged fusion constructs were made. Expression patterns of the UGT1A1CFP and UGT1A1YFP proteins were evaluated by transfecting pUGT1A1-CFP and pUGT1A1-YFP plasmids into COS cells, respectively, followed by fluorescence microscopy analysis. In Fig. 1, the top panel (1A1-CFP) and lower panel (1A1-YFP) of cells illustrate that both UGT1A1CFP and UGT1A1YFP fusion proteins exhibit fluorescence. Protein expression of each construct was excluded from the nucleus and resembles an ER localization expression pattern. The application of FRET has been used to monitor a vast array of protein interactions (26.Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4982) Google Scholar, 27.Miyawaki A.

To determine homodimerization of UGT1A1 in vivo, COS cells were co-transfected with pUGT1A1-CFP and pUGT1A1-YFP plasmids and the live cells evaluated for FRET. In Fig. 2A, co-expression of both UGT1A1CFP and UGT1A1YFP is indicated in the CFP and YFP channels, respectively. Analysis with the FRET channel after correction for Donor and Acceptor bleed through illustrates increased fluorescence, indicating that the two proteins reside in close proximity to each other within the ER membrane. Evaluation of FRET using Acceptor Ratio analysis depicted distinct color-coded regions, illustrating FRET efficiency ranging from 40% (green) upto 80% (red) throughout the cell. The acceptor photobleaching method was also implemented as an alternative method to quantify the absolute efficiency of FRET between the Donor (CFP) and Acceptor (YFP) fluorophores. For this experiment COS cells were co-transfected with pUGT1A1-CFP and pUGT1A1-YFP and the cells illuminated at 515 nm wavelength for 60 s, followed by CFP and YFP image acquisitions. This was repeated every minute over a 10-min time course. Using the acceptor photobleaching method, FRET is manifested by the dequenching of the Donor CFP signal by selective photobleaching of the Acceptor YFP over time, resulting in increased CFP signal. In Fig. 2B the Acceptor graph showed a sharp decrease in YFP fluorescence after each photobleaching exposure, whereas the Donor graph depicted a concomitant increase in CFP fluorescence throughout the photobleaching time course, indicating FRET between UGT1A1CFP and UGT1A1YFP. Moreover, the decrease in fluorescence gray value of the Acceptor (YFP) was directly proportional to the fluorescence gray value gained by the Donor (CFP), further confirming the high FRET efficiency observed in the Acceptor Ratio analysis in Fig. 2A. Because FRET can elucidate protein-protein interactions within angstrom distances, these results infer that the UGT1A1CFP and UGT1A1YFP fusion proteins are in physical contact within the membrane. FRET analysis suggests that UGT1A1 forms a homodimer complex. The UGT1A proteins share 100% amino acid identity in 244 amino acids at the carboxyl end with varying degrees of sequence divergence in the amino-terminal region. Hydropathy profiles indicate that each of the UGT1A proteins shows a conserved pattern of hydrophobicity with UGT1A1, allowing us to speculate that the other UGT1A proteins may behave in a similar pattern as UGT1A1 in the membrane. To examine this possibility, homodimerization among the other UGT1A proteins was explored. COS cells were co-transfected with the corresponding pUGT1A-CFP and pUGT1A-YFP plasmids to examine homodimerization potential as measured by FRET analysis (Fig. 3). As a negative control, COS cells were co-transfected with the pCFP and pYFP vectors. FRET analysis using Acceptor Ratio evaluation from pCFP/pYFP co-transfected cells showed no FRET signal as indicated by the dark blue color-coded region throughout the cell. However, Acceptor Ratio evaluations of cells co-transfected with the pUGT1A3-, pUGT1A4-, pUGT1A6-, pUGT1A7-, pUGT1A8-, pUGT1A9-, or pUGT1A10-CFP and -YFP pairs showed high FRET signals ranging from 40% (green) to 90% (red-white) FRET efficiency. It can be seen in each of the FRET channels that all of the UGT1A-CFP/YFP combinations produced a FRET signal. No FRET was identified in select regions of the cell, as indicated by the black and dark blue regions, particularly the nucleus. To examine the potential of UGT1A1 to dimerize with the other UGT1A proteins, co-transfection of COS cells with pUGT1A1-CFP and either pUGT1A3-YFP, pUGT1A4-YFP, pUGT1A6-YFP, pUGT1A7-YFP, pUGT1A8-YFP, pUGT1A9-YFP, or pUGT1A10-YFP was performed and evaluated for FRET. In Fig. 4, it is shown that Acceptor Ratio evaluation for each UGT1A1CFP/UGT1AYFP pair resulted in a high FRET signal ranging from 40% (green) to 100% (white) FRET efficiency among the cells. This evidence suggests that UGT1A1 is able to heterodimerize with either UGT1A3, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A7, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, or UGT1A10. Combined, these results suggest that each of the UGT1A proteins is capable of forming homodimers a"

Here we report that Crooked neck (Crn), the Drosophila homolog of the yeast Clf1p splicing factor, is directing peripheral glial cell maturation. We show that crooked neck is expressed and required in glial cells to control migration and axonal wrapping. Within the cytoplasm, Crn interacts with the RNA-binding protein HOW and then translocates to the nucleus where the Crn/HOW complex controls glial differentiation by facilitating splicing of specific target genes. By using a GFP-exon trap approach, we identified some of the in vivo target genes that encode proteins localized in autocellular septate junctions. In conclusion, here we show that glial cell differentiation is controlled by a cytoplasmic assembly of splicing components, which upon translocation to the nucleus promote the splicing of genes involved in the assembly of cellular junctions."
https://openalex.org/W2094117039,"Dendritic cells (DC) are the most potent antigen-presenting cells of the immune system and are able to sensitize even naïve T cells. Mature DC are characterized by expression of CD83, a surface molecule that is proposed to be involved in efficient T cell activation. It has been recently shown that CD83 mRNA is transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in a HuR- and CRM1-dependent manner. Therefore we here investigated the impact of two known protein ligands of HuR, pp32 and APRIL, on CD83 expression. Both pp32 (ANP32A) and APRIL (ANP32B) are shuttle proteins, and it has been reported earlier that these HuR ligands can act as adaptors that link HuR and the CRM1-specific nuclear export pathway. By employing RNA interference (RNAi) technology we demonstrate that pp32 is dispensable for CD83 expression, whereas APRIL contributes to the nuclear export and subsequent translation of CD83 mRNA. Furthermore, we have determined the nuclear import signal (NLS) as well as the nuclear export signal (NES) of human APRIL. Moreover, we analyzed the status of phosphorylation of endogenous APRIL and identified threonine 244 to be an as yet unrecognized phosphate acceptor. Finally, we were able to show that phosphorylation of this specific amino acid residue regulates the nuclear export of APRIL. In sum, we report here the signal sequences in APRIL that mediate its intracellular trafficking and provide evidence that this protein ligand of HuR is an important player in the post-transcriptional regulation of CD83 expression by affecting the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of CD83 mRNA.

Following uptake of antigen and exposure to inflammatory stimuli, they migrate to the secondary lymphoid organs, where, as mature DC, they can initiate antigen-specific T cell immune responses. The DC maturation process includes the modulation of endogenous chemokine and chemokine receptor expression profiles, as well as the up-regulation of several cytokines, costimulatory, and adhesion molecules (1.Banchereau J.

Although its exact function remains to be determined, accumulating data support the model that CD83 contributes to efficient T cell activation (reviewed in Refs. 8.Lechmann M. Zinser E. Golka A.

Therefore, the detailed analysis of the processes that regulate CD83 expression will not only improve our understanding of T cell activation, but may also result in the identification of novel drug targets that can potentially be exploited to modulate DC activity. In metazoans, the vast majority of mRNAs are transported from the nuclear site of transcription to the cytoplasm, the site of protein synthesis, via the TAP/NXF1 pathway (reviewed in Refs. 13.Izaurralde E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 210-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 14.Erkmann J.A. Kutay U. Exp.

In contrast, it has been recently shown that a small subpopulation of cellular transcripts, including the mRNA encoding CD83, can be translocated across the nuclear envelope via the completely unrelated CRM1 nuclear export pathway (16.Schütz S. Chemnitz J. Spillner C. Frohme M. Hauber J. Kehlenbach R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 997-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In another study, a novel cis-active RNA element, termed post-transcriptional regulatory element (PRE), which serves as binding site of the HuR nucleocytoplasmic shuttle protein, has been identified in CD83 mRNA (17.Prechtel A.T. Chemnitz J. Schirmer S. Ehlers C. Langbein-Detsch I. Stulke J. Dabauvalle M.C. Kehlenbach R.H. Hauber J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10912-10925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In contrast to the binding of HuR to AU-rich elements (AREs), which are frequently located in the 3′-untranslated region of early response gene (ERG) mRNAs (18.Barreau C. Paillard L. Osborne H.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 7138-7150Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar), the interaction of HuR with the CD83 PRE, which is located in the gene coding region, does not result in RNA stabilization, but rather mediates the nuclear export of this transcript. In this context it is interesting to note that Steitz and co-workers (19.Brennan C.M. Gallouzi I.E. Steitz J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 20.Gallouzi I.E. Brennan C.M. Steitz J.A. RNA. 2001; 7: 1348-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) previously provided evidence that HuR-dependent nuclear export of the ARE-containing c-fos mRNA is mediated by the ANP32 family members pp32 (ANP32a) and/or APRIL (ANP32b), which appear to serve as adaptor molecules, linking HuR and the nuclear export receptor CRM1. Therefore we hypothesized that the HuR ligands pp32 and/or APRIL may also play an important functional role in the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of CD83 mRNA. Here we analyzed the effect of pp32 and APRIL on CD83 expression. We demonstrate that the HuR ligand APRIL, but not pp32, regulates the cytoplasmic accumulation of CD83 transcripts and characterize the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of APRIL in detail. Molecular Clones−Wild-type and mutant genes were inserted into various vectors using standard methods and synthetic double strand oligonucleotides or PCR technology. Because of extensive sequence homology, human pp32 and APRIL sequences were pre-amplified from a cDNA derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with primers binding to the untranslated regions of the respective transcript (21.Chen T.H. Brody J.R. Romantsev F.E. Yu J.G. Kayler A.E. Voneiff E. Kuhajda F.P. Pasternack G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2045-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 22.Mencinger M. Panagopoulos I.

The plasmids pGEX-APRIL and pGEX-pp32 are bacterial expression vectors in which the human APRIL or the human pp32 cDNA are fused in-frame to the 3′-end of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) coding region by inserting the respective sequences between the EcoRI and BamHI or EcoRI and XhoI site of pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Biosciences), respectively. The eukaryotic expression vectors p3pp32-FLAG and p3APRIL-FLAG were created by fusing the 3′ terminus of the respective coding sequence to a sequence encoding the FLAG epitope and insertion of the product between the BamHI and XbaI or EcoRI and XbaI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), respectively. Derivatives of p3APRIL-FLAG were generated by using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Stratagene). In particular, following constructs were generated: p3APRIL NES1mut-FLAG (Leu60,63,66,69,71 all to Ala), p3APRIL NES2mut-FLAG (Leu83,87,90,93,95 all to Ala), p3APRIL NES3mut-FLAG (Leu109,112,115,118,120 all to Ala), and p3APRIL T244A (Thr244 to Ala). The vector pBC12/βGal-APRILwt, expressing β-galactosidase (β-Gal)-APRIL fusion protein was constructed by insertion of the PCR-generated APRIL cDNA between the XbaI and XhoI site of the vector pBC12/CMV/βGal (23.Ruhl M. Himmelspach M. Bahr G.M. Hammerschmid F. Jaksche H. Wolff B. Aschauer H. Farrington G.K. Probst H. Bevec D. Hauber J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1309-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The subsequent mutational inactivation of the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of APRIL (Lys239, Arg240, Lys241, Arg242 all to Ala) resulted in the pBC12/βGal-APRIL-NLSmut construct. The plasmid pBC12/βGal-NLS expresses a βGal-APRIL NLS (APRIL amino acid residues 239–242) fusion protein. The vector pBC12/CMV/HuR that expresses human HuR and the plasmid p3UTR-CD83, which contains an expression cassette that consists of the human CD83 cDNA flanked by the homologous 5′- and 3′-untranslated region (UTR), have been described elsewhere (17.Prechtel A.T.

RNA Isolation, Slot-blot Analysis, and PCR−Total cellular RNAs were isolated according to the manufacturer’s protocol by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). For isolation of cytoplasmic and nuclear RNAs, 2 × 105 cells were lysed on ice for 1 min using 100 μl of Nonidet P-40 buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH pH 7.8, 10 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25% Nonidet P-40). Subsequently, the lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 470 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Cytoplasmic RNA was isolated from 80 μl of the supernatant using TRIzol reagent. The nuclei were washed again in 100 μl of Nonidet P-40 buffer to deplete residual cytoplasmic RNA. Afterward, the nuclear RNA was isolated by using TRIzol reagent. If necessary, DNase treatment of the RNA samples was performed. Selected RNA samples were reversely transcribed using the first strand cDNA (AMV) synthesis kit for RT-PCR (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Subsequently, RT products were assayed by PCR. For detection of GAPDH sequences following primers were used: forward, 5′-TGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGT-3′; reverse, 5′-CATGTGGGCCATGAGGTCCACCAC-3′. The amplification profile involved 30 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min, primer annealing at 56 °C for 1 min, and primer extension at 72 °C for 1 min. CD83 mRNAs were detected by using following primer pairs: forward, 5′-GGTGAAGGTGGCTTGCTCCGAAG-3′, and reverse, 5′-GAGCCAGCAGCAGGACAATCTCC-3′. The amplification profile involved 25 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min, primer annealing at 56 °C for 1 min, and primer extension at 72 °C for 1 min. Real time PCR was performed in a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Amplification was monitored by SYBR green fluorescence. Standard curves were derived by serial dilution of p3UTR-CD83 and pGAPDH. RNAs were normalized by amplification of GAPDH. For immuno-PCR analysis, transiently expressed APRIL-FLAG protein was covalently cross-linked to HuR-CD83 mRNA complex by adding 1% formaldehyde to the medium for 5 min at 37 °C. Afterward, FLAG-tagged APRIL was immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal anti-FLAG-antibody. Coimmunoprecipitated CD83 mRNA was reverse-transcribed and analyzed by PCR as described above. For RNA fractionation control 10 μl of 0.1 μg/μl total, nuclear or cytoplasmic RNA were supplemented with 30 μlof RNA denaturation buffer (660 μl of formamide, 210 μl of 37% formaldehyde, 130 μl of 10× MOPS electrophoresis buffer, pH 7.0) and incubated for 5 min at 65 °C. Afterward, the samples were cooled on ice and supplemented with 40 μl of 20× SSC. Positively charged Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Biosciences) was preincubated in 20× SSC and placed on a slot-blotting Minifold II system (Whatman). The RNA samples were applied to the slots by vacuum soaking, and the membrane was subsequently washed with 500 μl of 10× SSC per slot. Afterward, the RNA was covalently cross-linked by UV irradiation (UV-Stratalinker 1800; Stratagene), and the membrane was subjected to Northern blot analysis described elsewhere (29.Valent P.

For heterokaryon analysis, 1 μg of the respective APRIL expression plasmid DNA together with 1 μg of pF25-Rev-GFP was cotransfected into 1.5 × 105 HeLa cells with polyethylenimine (PEI) reagent (Polyscience Inc.). Like-wise, 1.5 × 105 HeLa cells were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA expressing either βGal or the respective βGal-APRIL fusion proteins for subsequent indirect immunofluorescence microscopy.

Two days post-transfection, the culture supernatants, containing lentiviral particles, were harvested, and viral p24Gag antigen levels were determined by ELISA (Innogenetics N.V.). Subsequently, 2.5 × 106 Jurkat T cells were infected by spin-inoculation as previously described (33.O’Doherty U. Swiggard W.J. Malim M.H. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10074-10080Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar) using virus-containing supernatants equivalent to 1000 ng of p24 antigen. The respective Jurkat cultures were activated by serum depletion for 12 h, addition of 10% serum for 3 h followed by addition of 50 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and 1 μm ionomycin (both from Sigma) for additional 3 h prior to further analysis. For immuno-PCR 2 μg of p3APRIL-FLAG, 2 μg of pBC12/CMV/HuR, 2 μg of p3UTR-CD83 or the corresponding parental vectors, respectively, were cotransfected into 5 × 106 COS cells as described above. At 24 h post-transfection, the respective cell cultures were subjected to immuno-PCR analysis. Protein Analyses−Total cellular protein was isolated by lysis of the cells with lysis buffer A (0.1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes at pH 7.3, 1 mm EDTA, 4 mm EGTA, 5 mm NaF, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupetin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 125 μg/ml Pefablock (Biomol)) followed by denaturation in SDS buffer (65 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1.5% dithiothreitol). For isolation of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins 2 × 106 cells were lysed on ice for 1 min using 100 μlof Nonidet P-40-buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH pH 7.8, 10 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25% Nonidet P-40). Subsequently, the lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 470 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Cytoplasmic protein was isolated from 80 μlof the supernatant and denaturated in SDS buffer. The nuclei were washed again in 100 μl of Nonidet P-40-buffer to deplete residual cytoplasmic proteins. Afterward, the nuclear proteins were prepared by denaturation of the nuclei in SDS buffer. Immunoprecipitation analysis, SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analysis were performed as previously described (17.Prechtel A.T. Chemnitz J. Schirmer S. Ehlers C. Langbein-Detsch I. Stulke J.

Protein Purification−GST-APRIL and GST-pp32 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Accordingly, 500-ml cultures were grown to an A600 of ∼0.5, and protein expression was induced by addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to the respective culture media. After incubation at 30 °C for 3 h, bacteria were harvested and lysed in 20 ml of lysis buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 125 μg/ml Pefablock (Biomol), 3 mg lysozyme). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation and applied to 2 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 30 min. The Sepharose was washed three times with wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.4% Nonidet P-40) and bound GST proteins were eluted with 20 mm glutathione (dissolved in wash buffer). After extensive dialysis against PBS/20% glycerol, the proteins were subjected to further experiments. Metabolic Labeling and Pulse-Chase Experiments−Cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with cysteine/methionine-free medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum for 1 h. The cells were metabolically labeled for 30 min using 500 μCi of Tran35S-label (MP Biochemicals; 1175 Ci/mmol). Afterward the cultures were washed twice with PBS and either harvested or, in case of pulse-chase experiments, incubated further for various time periods in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin). For deglycosylation the cellular lysates were incubated with PNGase F (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy−For indirect immunofluorescence analysis cells were grown on coverslips and subsequently fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 25 min at ambient temperature. After incubation in 100 mm glycine/PBS for 10 min, the cells where permeabilized in PBS/0.1% Triton X-100 for 4 min at ambient temperature, followed by incubation in PBS/1% BSA for 30 min. Proteins were stained in PBS/1% BSA for 30 min with mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against βGal (1:200 dilution) or the FLAG epitope (1:5,000 dilution), followed by Alexa-Fluor-594-coupled anti-mouse antibody raised in goats (1:800 dilution, Molecular Probes). Nuclei were visualized by Hoechst 33258 (0.25 μg/ml in PBS) staining for 10 min. The cells were mounted in mowiol medium and analyzed using a Zeiss Axiovert-200 M microscope. Heterokaryon Assay−HeLa cells were seeded at day 1 post-transfection together with untransfected NIH 3T3 cells on coverslips. The cocultures, supplemented with 75 μg/ml cycloheximide to block de novo protein synthesis, were then further incubated for 2 h. Heterokaryon formation was induced by exposure of the cell cultures to 50% polyethylene glycol 3350 in PBS for 2 min at 37 °C. The coverslips were then washed extensively in PBS and returned to fresh culture medium containing 75 μg/ml cycloheximide. After incubation for another hour, cells were fixed and indirect immunofluorescence analysis was performed. Analysis of pp32 and APRIL Expression−In a previous study, we provided evidence that HuR is required for CD83 expression in Jurkat T cells (17.Prechtel A.T. Chemnitz J. Schirmer S. Ehlers C. Langbein-Detsch I. Stulke J. Dabauvalle M.C. Kehlenbach R.H. Hauber J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10912-10925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Therefore we analyzed here the expression level of the HuR ligands pp32 and APRIL in logarithmically growing Jurkat T cells. For this, we raised pp32- and APRIL-specific polyclonal antibodies in rabbits. At first, the respective sera were tested in Western blot analyses for their capacity to recognize purified pp32 or APRIL GST fusion proteins. As shown, both sera were highly specific and recognized their targets with similar affinities (Fig. 1A, lane 7 versus lane 8), allowing us to distinguish the closely related pp32 and APRIL proteins in this type of assay. The subsequent detection of the respective endogenous proteins in Jurkat cells revealed that the steady state expression level of APRIL is significantly higher than the level of pp32 in these cells (Fig. 1B, compare lane 1 and lane 2). To analyze, whether this difference is caused by protein stability, a protein pulse-chase experiment was performed (Fig. 1C). Th"
https://openalex.org/W2071096625,"A prominent feature of ionotropic glutamate receptors from the AMPA and kainate subtypes is their profound desensitization in response to glutamate—a process thought to protect the neuron from overexcitation. In AMPA receptors, it is well established that desensitization results from rearrangements of the interface formed between agonist-binding domains of adjacent subunits; however, it is unclear how this mechanism applies to kainate receptors. Here we show that stabilization of the binding domain dimer by the generation of intermolecular disulfide bonds apparently blocked desensitization of the kainate receptor GluR6. This result establishes a common desensitization mechanism in both AMPA and kainate receptors. Surprisingly, however, surface expression of these nondesensitizing mutants was drastically reduced and did not depend on channel activity. Therefore, in addition to its role at the synapse, we now propose an intracellular role for desensitization in controlling maturation and trafficking of glutamate receptors.

Therefore, in addition to its role at the synapse, we now propose an intracellular role for desensitization in controlling maturation and trafficking of glutamate receptors. L-glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, activates three distinct types of ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs): NMDA, AMPA, and kainate, named after their relative sensitivity to agonists. All iGluRs assemble as tetramers from pools of homologous subunits. Of these, subunits GluR1-4 assemble the AMPA receptors, and subunits GluR5-7 and KA1-2 form the kainate receptors (Dingledine et al., 1999Dingledine R. Borges K. Bowie D. Traynelis S.F. The glutamate receptor ion channels.Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 7-61PubMed Google Scholar). The subunits themselves consist of four principle domains: an extracellular N-terminal domain (NTD), which is implicated in subunit oligomerization; an extracellular ligand-binding domain (LBD), composed of the so-called S1 and S2 segments; a channel-forming domain, consisting of three transmembrane domains (M1, M3, and M4) and a reentrant loop (M2); and an intracellular C-terminal domain (CTD), involved in receptor trafficking and anchoring (Madden, 2002Madden D.R. The structure and function of glutamate receptor ion channels.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, Mayer, 2006Mayer M.L. Glutamate receptors at atomic resolution.Nature. 2006; 440: 456-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Currently, structural data is available only for the LBD (Erreger et al., 2004Erreger K. Chen P.E. Wyllie D.J. Traynelis S.F. Glutamate receptor gating.Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 2004; 16: 187-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, Mayer et al., 2006Mayer M.L. Ghosal A. Dolman N.P. Jane D.E.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2852-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), demonstrating the special folding of S1 and S2 in two globular domains that bind glutamate in a cleft formed between them (see Figure 1C). Activation of iGluRs is followed by either deactivation attributable to ligand unbinding or desensitization caused by closing of the ion channel pore while the receptor remains in a ligand-bound state. Both AMPA and kainate receptors desensitize completely and rapidly in response to glutamate, with a time constant of ∼5 ms (Dingledine et al., 1999Dingledine R. Borges K. Bowie D. Traynelis S.F. The glutamate receptor ion channels.Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 7-61PubMed Google Scholar). This profound desensitization, together with slow recovery, is thought to play an important role in determining the frequency and amplitude of excitatory responses in the brain and may provide a backup mechanism preventing excitotoxicity during brain damage that causes an increase in glutamate concentrations at the synapse (Frandsen and Schousboe, 2003Frandsen A.

Westbrook G.L. The impact of receptor desensitization on fast synaptic transmission.Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 96-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). In AMPA receptors there is a strong correlation between the extent of receptor desensitization and the stability of the dimer interface formed between LBDs of adjacent subunits. Key evidence for this correlation came from a single-point mutant L-to-Y (L483Y in GluR2) that abolished desensitization (Stern-Bach et al., 1998Stern-Bach Y. Russo S. Neuman M. Rosenmund C. A point mutation in the glutamate binding site blocks desensitization of AMPA receptors.Neuron. 1998; 21: 907-918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and was shown to stabilize the dimer interface (Sun et al., 2002Sun Y. Olson R. Horning M. Armstrong N. Mayer M. Gouaux E. Mechanism of glutamate receptor desensitization.Nature. 2002; 417: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Likewise, allosteric modulators, such as cyclothiazide, bind in the interface and block AMPA receptor desensitization (Jin et al., 2005Jin R. Clark S. Weeks A.M. Dudman J.T. Gouaux E. Partin K.M.

Mechanism of glutamate receptor desensitization.Nature. 2002; 417: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Conversely, point mutations that weaken the interaction between neighboring LBDs greatly accelerate the desensitization (Horning and Mayer, 2004Horning M.S. Mayer M.L.

Horning M. Armstrong N. Mayer M. Gouaux E. Mechanism of glutamate receptor desensitization.Nature. 2002; 417: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). These findings, together with previous work on conformational changes during ligand binding (Armstrong and Gouaux, 2000Armstrong N. Gouaux E. Mechanisms for activation and antagonism of an AMPA-sensitive glutamate receptor: crystal structures of the GluR2 ligand binding core.Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar), led Sun et al., 2002Sun Y. Olson R. Horning M. Armstrong N. Mayer M. Gouaux E. Mechanism of glutamate receptor desensitization.Nature. 2002; 417: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar to propose the following model for receptor activation and desensitization. According to this model, glutamate binding induces LBD cleft closure, a movement that pulls apart the linkers connecting the LBD to the transmembrane domains and thus opens the channel. In the next step, the dimer interface undergoes conformational rearrangements that break the contacts between the LBDs. This uncoupling relieves the strain on the ion channel linkers, allowing the ion channel to close even though the agonist remains bound with high affinity. Despite these extensive studies on AMPA receptors, in kainate receptors a similar correlation between the stability of the dimer interface and the extent of receptor desensitization is mostly lacking. Mutations introduced to the LBD dimer interface of GluR6 only moderately attenuated the desensitization, if at all, and mostly resulted in accelerated desensitization (Fleck et al., 2003Fleck M.W. Cornell E. Mah S.J. Amino-acid residues involved in glutamate receptor 6 kainate receptor gating and desensitization.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1219-1227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the role of dimer interface in kainate receptor desensitization remains an open question. In the course of analyzing the contribution of residues in the S2 segment to GluR6 function, we found a single residue, K696, which, when mutated to arginine, present in AMPA receptors, slowed the onset of desensitization by 5-fold. Structurally, K696 projects to the dimer interface and maps close to E787 from the adjacent subunit. Mutating these sites to cysteines resulted in an apparent block of receptor desensitization. This double-cysteine mutation also slowed the deactivation rate and increased agonist efficacy, a phenotype resembling the behavior of the L-to-Y mutation in the AMPA receptors. These results demonstrate that the dimer interface is a pivotal participant in the mechanism of kainate receptor desensitization as well. Surprisingly, however, surface expression of this nondesensitizing mutant was drastically reduced and did not depend on channel activity. Therefore, in addition to its role at the synapse, we suggest that the desensitization state is a key checkpoint recognized by the ER quality-control machinery to ensure that only receptors that can desensitize will reach the cell surface. Similar to previous studies (Fleck et al., 2003Fleck M.W. Cornell E. Mah S.J. Amino-acid residues involved in glutamate receptor 6 kainate receptor gating and desensitization.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1219-1227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Swanson et al., 1997Swanson G.T. Gereau IV, R.W. Green T. Heinemann S.F. Identification of amino acid residues that control functional behavior in GluR5 and GluR6 kainate receptors.Neuron. 1997; 19: 913-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), we looked for subtype-specific residues that control biophysical properties of the kainate receptor GluR6. Receptors were expressed in HEK293 cells, and channel kinetics was determined using patch-clamp recordings combined with rapid solution exchange. As shown in Figure 1A, GluR6 wild-type (wt) receptors completely and rapidly desensitized in response to a prolonged application of saturating glutamate (3 mM for 500 ms) with a desensitization time constant (τdes) of 4.4 ± 0.1 ms (n = 24; Figure 1D), in agreement with published data (Dingledine et al., 1999Dingledine R. Borges K. Bowie D. Traynelis S.F. The glutamate receptor ion channels.Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 7-61PubMed Google Scholar). In the course of screening residues in the S2 segment, we found that substitution of K696, a conserved residue in GluR5/6/7, with the equivalent arginine, present in all AMPA receptor subunits, slowed the onset of GluR6 desensitization by approximately 5-fold (K696R, τdes = 20.2 ± 0.9 ms, n = 12; Figures 1A and 1D). The K696R mutation also slowed the rate of channel closure in response to a brief application of glutamate (1 ms; Figure 1B), presenting a deactivation time constant (τdea) of 9.8 ± 0.3 ms (n = 8) compared to 2.3 ± 0.3 ms (n = 7) measured for GluR6 wt receptors. In contrast to the profound effects on the desensitization and deactivation rates, the K696R mutation had no significant effect on the rate of recovery from desensitization (data not shown). Structurally, K696, which maps to the end of helix F of the LBD (Mayer, 2005Mayer M.L. Crystal structures of the GluR5 and GluR6 ligand binding cores: molecular mechanisms underlying kainate receptor selectivity.Neuron. 2005; 45: 539-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, Nanao et al., 2005Nanao M.H. Green T. Stern-Bach Y. Heinemann S.F. Choe S. Structure of the kainate receptor subunit GluR6 agonist-binding domain complexed with domoic acid.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 1708-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), seems to project to the dimer interface and may interact with E787 from the adjacent subunit, a residue located at the end of helix J (Figure 1C). E787 is conserved across all kainate and AMPA receptor subunits. The corresponding residue, E755, in the AMPA receptor subunit GluR2 is proposed to be part of a hydrogen-bond network that connects the base and middle of helix J of one subunit with helix D of the adjacent subunit (Horning and Mayer, 2004Horning M.S. Mayer M.L. Regulation of AMPA receptor gating by ligand binding core dimers.Neuron. 2004; 41: 379-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that, in GluR6, the K696R mutation stabilizes the dimer interface by interacting with E787, thus accounting for the attenuation in receptor kinetics. Indeed, mutation of E787 to alanine (E-A), predicted to break the interaction between K696 and E787, was found to accelerate the onset of GluR6 desensitization (Figure 1D). Mutation of E787 to glutamine (E-Q) resulted in no detectable currents (n > 20 patches), but when combined with the K696R mutation, we observed small-current amplitudes with faster desensitization (K-R/E-Q, Figure 1D). Likewise, when combined, the K696R mutation attenuated the effect of E787A, exhibiting desensitization kinetics like GluR6 wt (K-R/E-A; Figure 1D). Based on these observations, we expected that mutation of K696 to alanine would accelerate the desensitization as observed for R6(E787A). However, instead we observed a reduced desensitization rate similar to the K696R mutation (Figure 1D). A similar reduced rate was also observed for K696 mutation to glutamate (K-E) or methionine (K-M), but not when mutated to phenylalanine (K-F), tyrosine (K-Y), or tryptophan (K-W), which exhibited GluR6 wt kinetics (Figure 1D). Although these results may not support a direct interaction between K696 and E787, the bidirectional kinetic effects of mutations at these positions support the hypothesis that the stability of the dimer interface is an important determinant of kainate receptor desensitization. To further establish a correlation between dimer interface stability and the extent of desensitization, we attempted to generate a nondesensitizing receptor by restricting dimer movement. Due to the short distance between K696 and E787, we predicted that mutating these residues to cysteines would generate an intersubunit disulfide bond, thereby locking the dimer conformation. However, no currents could be recorded from the double-cysteine mutant R6(K696C/E787C) (n > 50 patches). The single-cysteine mutant R6(K696C) exhibited current amplitudes compatible to GluR6 wt, with a moderate shift of the desensitization rate (τdes = 7.2 ± 0.3 n = 5 p < 0.01; Figure 1D), while no currents could be recorded from cells expressing the R6(E787C) mutant (n > 20 patches). In parallel to the experiments in HEK293 cells, we expressed the various mutants in Xenopus oocytes, and the extent of GluR6 receptor desensitization was estimated by measuring whole-cell currents before and after treatment with concanavalin A (ConA), a desensitization blocker of kainate receptors (Mayer and Vyklicky, 1989Mayer M.L. Vyklicky Jr., L. Concanavalin A selectively reduces desensitization of mammalian neuronal quisqualate receptors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1989; 86: 1411-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, Partin et al., 1993Partin K.M. Patneau D.K. Winters C.A. Mayer M.L. Buonanno A. Selective modulation of desensitization at AMPA versus kainate receptors by cyclothiazide and concanavalin A.Neuron. 1993; 11: 1069-1082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). As seen in Figure 2, application of glutamate for 2 s to oocytes expressing GluR6 wt receptors evoked only small currents (3–10 nA), if at all, reflecting the fast and complete desensitization of these receptors. However, after blocking the desensitization with ConA, robust steady-state currents (2–4 μA) were observed. The R6(K696R), in which the desensitization rate is ∼5-fold slower (Figure 1), exhibited a brief response to glutamate, which comprised ∼15% of the steady-state current recorded with ConA (Figure 2A). The single-cysteine mutant R6(K696C) behaved like GluR6 wt, while no currents could be recorded from oocytes expressing the counterpart mutant R6(E787C) even after treatment with ConA (Figure 2A). These results are similar to what we observed in the HEK293 cells. Surprisingly, however, in contrast to the apparent loss of function in the HEK293 cells, glutamate evoked high steady-state currents in oocytes expressing the double-cysteine mutant R6(K696C/E787C), which were not further affected by ConA. This result suggested that desensitization in this mutant is apparently blocked, as we initially predicted. In addition, we observed that, upon removal of glutamate, the duration of current return to baseline was 3- to 5-fold longer than that observed for GluR6 wt or for the mutants R6(K696R) and R6(K696C) (Figure 2A, note the timescale). In support of intersubunit connection between K696C and E787C in creating the nondesensitized phenotype, high steady-state currents were recorded from oocytes coexpressing the single-cysteine mutants, R6(K696C) and R6(E787C). This steady-state current comprised ∼30% of the currents recorded after ConA treatment, reflecting the mixed population of desensitizing and nondesensitizing receptors. To further support the idea that the double-cysteine mutant R6(K696C/E787C) generates nondesensitizing current in the absence of ConA, we recorded excised patches from oocytes and subjected them to fast perfusion. Similar to HEK293 cells, rapid glutamate application to patches excised from GluR6 wt induced fast desensitizing responses. However, the same application to patches excised from oocytes expressing the double-cysteine mutant resulted in completely nondesensitizing currents (Figure 2B). Western blot analysis under nonreducing conditions further confirmed the formation of a disulfide bond between the introduced cysteines in R6(K696C/E787C), but not in GluR6 wt or in the single-cysteine mutants (Figure 2C). Taken together, these results support our conclusion that stabilization of the dimer interface leads to desensitization block, as seen for the L-to-Y mutation in AMPA receptors (Stern-Bach et al., 1998Stern-Bach Y.

The L-to-Y mutation in AMPA receptors does not only block desensitization and slow deactivation (Robert et al., 2001Robert A. Irizarry S.N. Hughes T.E. Howe J.R.

Therefore, we wanted to test whether our double-cysteine mutation also has an effect on agonist apparent affinity. We thus measured EC50 values for glutamate and kainate (Figure 2D). For both agonists, R6(K696C/E787C) showed ∼15-fold increased apparent affinity as compared to GluR6 wt. A significant shift was also observed for R6(K696R) (5-fold, p < 0.001), in which the desensitization rate is 5-fold slower (Figure 1), but not for R6(K696C) (data not shown). Because K696 resides on helix F, which contains residues important for agonist binding and stabilization of the intradomain closed-cleft conformation (Armstrong and Gouaux, 2000Armstrong N. Gouaux E.

To distinguish between these two possibilities, we determined the IC50 values of the competitive antagonists NBQX (Figure 2D) and kynurenic acid (data not shown). No change in IC50 was observed for either antagonist, implying that the increase in agonist apparent affinity is a result of increased efficacy. Overall, the phenotype of the double-cysteine mutant in Xenopus oocytes, i.e., lack of desensitization, reduced deactivation, and increased efficacy, resembles the phenotype of the L-to-Y mutation in AMPA receptors (Robert et al., 2001Robert A.

Mechanism of glutamate receptor desensitization.Nature. 2002; 417: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), shown to stabilize the dimer interface. Therefore, we can conclude that, like in AMPA receptors, the stability of the dimer interface is a key determinant in kainate receptor gating as well. During revision of the present manuscript, a paper appeared (Zhang et al., 2006Zhang Y. Nayeem N. Nanao M.H. Green T. Interface interactions modulating desensitization of the kainate-selective ionotropic glutamate receptor subunit GluR6.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 10033-10042Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) showing results entirely compatible with our interpretation. The observation that the double-cysteine mutant R6(K696C/E787C) was functional in Xenopus oocytes while no currents could be detected in HEK293 cells suggests that cell-surface expression of this mutant in the HEK293 cells may be impaired. Indeed, confocal microscopy imaging on receptors tagged with EGFP at their N-termini revealed that, unlike GluR6 wt, which is targeted to the cell membrane, R6(K696C/E787C) is retained inside the cell, mostly around the nucleus (Figure 3A). To quantify surface expression, we performed ELISA assays using either HA- or EGFP-tagged receptors, and surface expression was determined as the ratio of immunological labeling of nonpermeable and permeable cells. As seen in Figure 3B, surface expression similar to that of GluR6 wt was observed for the active R6(K696R) and R6(K696C), as well as for the apparent inactive R6(E787C). In contrast, surface expression of the double-cysteine mutant R6(K696C/E787C) was drastically reduced. Previous studies have shown that mutant kainate receptor subunits incapable of binding glutamate do not traffic to the cell surface (Mah et al., 2005Mah S.J. Cornell E. Mitchell N.A. Fleck M.W. Glutamate receptor trafficking: endoplasmic reticulum quality control involves ligand binding and receptor function.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 2215-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, Valluru et al., 2005Valluru L. Xu J. Zhu Y. Yan S. Contractor A. Swanson G.T. Ligand binding is a critical requirement for plasma membrane expression of heteromeric kainate receptors.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6085-6093Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We therefore compared the surface expression of the double-cysteine mutant to that of R6(R523K), a mutant which is both defective in glutamate binding and trafficking (Mah et al., 2005Mah S.J. Cornell E. Mitchell N.A. Fleck M.W. Glutamate receptor trafficking: endoplasmic reticulum quality control involves ligand binding and receptor function.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 2215-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). As seen in Figure 3B, levels of surface expression were similar for both R6(R523K) and R6(K696C/E787C) mutants. To further examine receptor trafficking, we analyzed the glycosilation state of these mutants by treatment with endoglycosidase H (EndoH) and peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase). EndoH specifically cleaves high-mannose-type sugars characteristic of ER resident proteins. High-mannose-type sugars are further processed in the Golgi, and most glycoproteins acquire EndoH resistance. Sensitivity to EndoH therefore reflects the protein maturation state. PNGase, on the other hand, cleaves all N-linked glycans and thus serves as a control for full N-linked deglycosylation. As seen in Figure 3C, the majority of GluR6 wt and R6(K696R) protein is resistant to EndoH (left panels), consistent with the confocal microscopy and the cell-surface ELISA data (Figures 3A and 3B). In contrast, no EndoH-resistant fraction could be observed in R6(K696C/E787C) (bottom right panel) as well as in R6(R523K), which lacks functional glutamate binding (top right panel; Mah et al., 2005Mah S.J. Cornell E. Mitchell N.A. Fleck M.W. Glutamate receptor trafficking: endoplasmic reticulum quality control involves ligand binding and receptor function.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 2215-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Altogether, these results suggest that the nondesensitizing mutant was retained in the ER. To check that the nondesensitizing receptors are also retained in neurons, we expressed the EGFP-tagged GluR6 wt and R6(K696C/E787C) in cultured hippocampal neurons and included as a control the binding-site mutant R6(R523K). Total protein expression was detected by the GFP fluorescence intensity, and surface expression was determined by exposing the live neurons to anti-GFP antibody. As seen in Figure 4, GluR6 wt was targeted to the membrane, while no surface labeling was observed for either of these two mutants. It could be argued that the apparent impaired maturation and cell-surface expression of R6(K696C/E787C) may be caused by cell toxicity. Ion flux in response to traces of glutamate in the tissue culture media may cause cell death due to the block of receptor desensitization. This could then result in selection for cells with immature receptors. To test this possibility, we combined the nondesensitizing mutation with a mutation in the channel pore, M610R, shown to impair channel permeation (Robert et al., 2002Ro"
https://openalex.org/W2064111108,"5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-d-ribofuranoside (AICAr), a commonly used indirect activator of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), inhibits phosphatidylcholine (PC) biosynthesis in freshly isolated hepatocytes. In all nucleated mammalian cells, PC is synthesized from choline via the Kennedy (CDP-choline) pathway. The purpose of our study was to provide direct evidence that AMPK regulates phospholipid biosynthesis and to elucidate the mechanism(s) by which AMPK inhibits hepatic PC synthesis. Incubations of hepatocytes with AICAr resulted in a dose-dependent activation of AMPK and inhibition of PC biosynthesis. Surprisingly, adenoviral delivery of constitutively active AMPK did not alter PC biosynthesis. In addition, expression of dominant negative mutants of AMPK was unable to block the AICAr-dependent inhibition of PC biosynthesis, indicating that AICAr was acting independently of AMPK activation. Determination of aqueous intermediates of the CDP-choline pathway indicated that choline kinase, the first enzyme in the pathway, was inhibited by AICAr administration. Flux through the CDP-choline pathway was directly correlated to the level of intracellular ATP concentrations. Therefore, it is possible that inhibition of PC biosynthesis is another process by which the cell can reduce ATP consumption in times of energetic stress. However, unlike cholesterol and triacylglycerol biosynthesis, PC production is not regulated by AMPK."
https://openalex.org/W1979409616,"Sorgoleone, produced in root hair cells of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), is likely responsible for much of the allelopathic properties of sorghum root exudates against broadleaf and grass weeds. Previous studies suggest that the biosynthetic pathway of this compound initiates with the synthesis of an unusual 16:3 fatty acid possessing a terminal double bond. The corresponding fatty acyl-CoA serves as a starter unit for polyketide synthases, resulting in the formation of 5-pentadecatrienyl resorcinol. This resorcinolic intermediate is then methylated by an S-adenosylmethionine-dependent O-methyltransferase and subsequently dihydroxylated, yielding the reduced (hydroquinone) form of sorgoleone. To characterize the corresponding enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of the 16:3 fatty acyl-CoA precursor, we identified and cloned three putative fatty acid desaturases, designated SbDES1, SbDES2, and SbDES3, from an expressed sequence tag (EST) data base prepared from isolated root hairs. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analyses revealed that these three genes were preferentially expressed in sorghum root hairs where the 16:2 and 16:3 fatty acids were exclusively localized. Heterologous expression of the cDNAs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed that recombinant SbDES2 converted palmitoleic acid (16:1Δ9) to hexadecadienoic acid (16:2Δ9,12), and that recombinant SbDES3 was capable of converting hexadecadienoic acid into hexadecatrienoic acid (16:3Δ9,12,15). Unlike other desaturases reported to date, the double bond introduced by SbDES3 occurred between carbons 15 and 16 resulting in a terminal double bond aliphatic chain. Collectively, the present results strongly suggest that these fatty acid desaturases represent key enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the allelochemical sorgoleone.

Numerous plant species produce phytotoxic secondary metabolites, some of which may play a direct role in allelopathic interactions (1.Duke S.O. Rimando A.M. Baerson S.R. Scheffler B.E. Ota E.

These interactions often represent a form of chemical warfare occurring between neighboring plants competing for limited light, water, and nutrient resources (2.Inderjit Duke S.O.

Several Sorghum species have been reported to produce phytotoxins, which are exuded from their root systems into the rhizosphere, which suppress the growth of competing species (4.Einhellig F.A. Agron. J. 1996; 88: 886-893Crossref Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have contributed to the discovery and identification of the chemicals that are responsible for this observed allelopathic inhibition. For example, studies on the biologically active components of both water-soluble and water-insoluble exudates from roots of Sorghum bicolor have demonstrated their role in the growth inhibition of lettuce seedlings (Lactuca sativa), as well as a number of important invasive weed species (5.Netzly D.H. Butler L.G. Crop Sci. 1986; 26: 775-778Crossref Google Scholar). The major constituent of these exudates was identified as 2-hydroxy-5-methoxy-3-[(8′Z,11′Z)-8′,11′,14′-pentadecatriene]-p-benzoquinone, referred to as sorgoleone (Fig. 1) (6.Chang M. Netzly D.H. Butler L.G. Lynn D.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 7858-7860Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Early reports on the phytotoxicity of sorgoleone indicated that it is a strong inhibitor of CO2-dependent oxygen evolution in plastids (7.Einhellig F.A. Rasmussen J.A. Hejl A.M. Souza I.F. J. Chem. Ecol. 1993; 19: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Further studies on its mode of action have documented additional effects on both photosynthetic and mitochondrial electron transport (8.Rasmussen J.A. Hejl A.M. Einhellig F.A. Thomas J.A. J. Chem.

The herbicidal and allelopathic properties of sorgoleone make the isolation and characterization of the corresponding genes involved in sorgoleone biosynthesis highly desirable, as manipulation of the pathway in sorghum, or genetic modification of other plant species using these genes could provide important insights into the underlying allelochemical interactions involved (12.Duke S.O. Trends Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 192-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Sorgoleone biosynthesis is likely exclusive to root hairs, which appear as cytoplasmically dense cells in sorghum, containing large osmiophilic globules deposited between the plasma lemma and cell wall, presumably associated with sorgoleone rhizosecretion (13.Czarnota M.A. Paul R.N. Weston L.A. Duke S.O. Int. J. Plant Sci. 2003; 164: 861-866Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 14.Czarnota M.A. Rimando A.M. Weston L.A. J. Chem. Ecol. 2003; 29: 2073-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Labeling studies have demonstrated that the biosynthesis of sorgoleone involves the convergence of the fatty acid and polyketide pathways (15.Fate G.D. Lynn D.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 11369-11376Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 16.Dayan F.E. Kagan I.A. Rimando A.M. J. Biol.

Subsequent modifications of the alkylresorcinol intermediate are mediated by S-adenosylmethionine-dependent O-methyltransferases and possibly P450 monooxygenases, yielding the reduced form of sorgoleone (a hydroquinone). Upon exudation, the less stable hydroquinone rapidly oxidizes to the highly active benzoquinone form, which can persist in soil for extended periods (11.Czarnota M.A. Paul R.N. Dayan F.E. Nimbal C.I.

A highly unusual characteristic of the sorgoleone molecule is the presence of a terminal double bond in the aliphatic side chain derived from a desaturated 16:3 fatty acyl-CoA precursor. Although the biochemical pathways involved in biosyntheses of many commonly occurring polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in plants have been well characterized (19.Behrouzian B. Buist P.H. Curr.

In an attempt to isolate genes encoding fatty acid desaturases involved in the sorgoleone biosynthetic pathway, we have utilized an expressed sequence tag (EST) 3The abbreviations used are: EST, expressed sequence tag; GC, gas chromatograph; MS, mass spectrometry; FAME, fatty acid methyl esters; FAD, fatty acid desaturase; NMR, nuclear magnetic resonance; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; DMOX, 4,4-dimethyloxazoline; ORF, open reading frame. data base containing ∼5,500 sequences randomly selected from a cDNA library prepared from purified S. bicolor (genotype BT×623) root hairs. 4S.

Duke, submitted manuscript. In this report, we describe the cloning and functional characterization of two fatty acid desaturases, designated SbDES2 and SbDES3, which consecutively convert 16:1 fatty acid to 16:3 fatty acid having a terminal double bond, identified from mining of the sorghum root hair EST data base. 5Fatty acid nomenclature: X:Y indicates that the fatty acid contains X number of carbon atoms and Y number of double bonds. ΔZ indicates that a double bond is located at zth carbon atom counting from the carboxyl group. No designation for the configuration of double bond is used when the double bond in the fatty acid is in cis configuration. Yeast cells overexpressing the SbDES3 cDNA were able to convert 16:3Δ9,12 fatty acid substrate to its 16:3Δ9,12,15 trienoic form, which is considered to be the substrate used by polyketide synthases in the sorgoleone biosynthetic pathway (15.Fate G.D.

To our knowledge, this is the first plant fatty acid desaturase described to date exhibiting terminal desaturase activity. Furthermore, the tissue-specific accumulation of SbDES2 and SbDES3 transcripts correlates with the accumulation of 16:2 and 16:3 fatty acids in root hairs (as determined by GC/MS), strongly suggesting the participation of these enzymes in the sorgoleone biosynthetic pathway. Plant Material−Mature leaves, stems, and emerging panicles were harvested from ∼2-month-old, greenhouse-grown Sorghum bicolor (cv. BT×623) plants. Immature leaves and shoot apices were isolated from 8-day-old BT×623 seedlings maintained in a growth chamber at 28 °C, 16 h light/8 h dark, 400 μmol/m2 sec intensity. Total root systems and root hairs were isolated from 8-day-old seedlings grown using a capillary mat system (14.Czarnota M.A. Rimando A.M. Weston L.A. J. Chem.

Root hairs were isolated according to the method of Bucher et al. (22.Bucher M. Schroeer B. Willmitzer L. Riesmeier J.W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 35: 497-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (QRT-RTPCR) reactions were performed in triplicate using a GenAmp® 5700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as previously described (23.Baerson S.R.

Isolation of Sorghum cDNA Clones−To obtain full-length cDNA clones, both 5′- and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was carried out using the BD SMART™ RACE cDNA Amplification Kit (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Primer sets for 5′- and 3′-RACE were 2A03: 5′-CCAAGGAGGTGAAGTGGCAG-3′ and 5′-ATACTACCGGGAGCCACACAAG-3′; 25B05: 5′-TCGCTGACGAAATGGTTGAC-3′ and 5′-CCTCCTTGGCGTGTTCCTC-3′; 56D10: 5′-TGGACGATCACCTCAATCCTG-3′ and 5′-CAACAAGTTCTAGCTGCTTGATGC-3′, respectively. Products of the RACE amplifications were resolved on agarose gels, cloned into the pCR®4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and then confirmed by sequence analysis. Full-length cDNAs were then amplified with primer pairs complementary to the 5′- and 3′-ends of ORFs identified in RACE experiments, using Pfu thermostable DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and first-strand cDNA generated from RNA extracted from sorghum root hairs. Several independent isolates from each amplification were sequenced to ensure the authenticity of the ORFs. Phylogenetic Analysis−Amino acid sequences of putative homology to fatty acid desaturases were retrieved from GenBank™ using BLAST with standard default parameters. A data set was assembled from 54 sequences, in addition to the three sequences characterized here (SbDES 1–3). Sequences of the chlorophyte, Chlorella vulgaris, were included to root the phylogeny. Multiple sequence alignments were constructed with ClustalX ver. 1.81 (24.Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35620) Google Scholar). Three parameter sets were investigated to assess sensitivity to gap costs: default (gap opening, 10.0; gap extension, 0.2), (10.0, 1.0), and (1.0, 1.0). The alignments differed somewhat in length (463, 464, and 482 residues, respectively). Phylogenetic estimates were conducted separately for each alignment. The neighbor-joining method (25.Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar) as implemented in PAUP* ver. 4.0 b 10 6D. Swofford (2001) PAUP* Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony (*, other methods), Version 4, Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA. was used with default parameters, except that ties were broken randomly. Trees were midpoint rooted and nodal support was estimated by the bootstrap (27.Felsenstein J. Evolution. 1985; 39: 783-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), employing 5000 pseudoreplicate data sets. Trees estimated from the three alignments were extremely similar. The second alignment, with a 10:1 ratio of gap opening to extension penalties, was selected for further analysis. However, all interpretations made here would be identical on trees estimated from the other two alignments (not shown). Plasmid Construction for Heterologous Expression in S. cerevisiae−For heterologous expression in yeast, ORFs were cloned as HindIII/XhoI fragments 3′ to the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter in pYES2 (Invitrogen), yielding the plasmids pYE25B (for SbDES1 overexpression), pYE56D (for SbDES2 overexpression), and pYE2A (for SbDES3 overexpression). All three constructs were then transformed into yeast strain INVSc1 using the lithium acetate method (28.Burke D. Dawson D. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, NY2000: 103-105Google Scholar). To construct additional vectors for co-expression of two ORFs in yeast, the galactose-inducible promoter::SbDES3 (or SbDES1)::terminator expression cassettes were subcloned into the yeast shuttle vector pRS423 containing a his+ marker (29.Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). To achieve this, expression cassettes were amplified from pYE2A and pYE25B using the PCR primers Lgal (5′-gggcgcgccACGGATTAGAAGCCGCCGAG-3′) and Rcyc (5′-gggcgcGCCGCAAATTAAAGCCTTCGA-3′), cloned into the pCR®4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and confirmed by DNA sequence analyses. The expression cassettes were then excised using BssHII (for SbDES3) or AscI (for SbDES1), gel-purified, and subcloned into BssHII or AscI-digested pRS423, yielding pRS2A (containing SbDES3) and pRS25B (containing SbDES1). These plasmids were then transformed into the yeast strain INVSc1 harboring pYE56D as described above. All yeast transformants were confirmed by colony-PCR using gene specific primers, and by further restriction analyses performed using isolated plasmid preparations. Culture Conditions and Recombinant Protein Expression−Transformed yeast cells were grown in synthetic medium (SC-Ura) containing 2% (w/v) glucose as carbon source and 0.67% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids. In the case of co-expression, transformed yeast cells were grown in similar media lacking histidine (SC-UH) for the selection of pRS423. Induction of recombinant protein expression was performed as described by Dyer et al. (30.Dyer J.M. Chapital D.C. Kuan J.-C.W. Mullen R.T. Turner C. McKeon T.A. Pepperman A.B. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 2027-2038Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar): briefly, overnight cultures were pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in induction medium (2% (w/v) galactose, 0.67% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, and 0.1% (v/v) tergitol Nonidet P-40 (Sigma). The cells then were diluted in 20 ml of same medium to obtain an A600 of 0.4. Exogenous free fatty acids (Sigma), when included, were added to the diluted cells at a final concentration of 0.1% (v/v). Yeast cell lines, including empty vector controls, were induced at 20 °C for 48 h prior to harvest, both in the absence or presence of exogenous fatty acids added to cultures at a final concentration of 0.1% (v/v): palmitic acid, palmitoleic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, γ-linolenic acid, and α-linolenic acid (Sigma). For SbDES2 and SbDES3 co-expression experiments, yeast cultures were maintained at 30 °C to obtain optimal yields of the 16:3Δ9,12,15 product (Fig. 6, C and F; Table 1).TABLE 1Accumulation of fatty acid products in transformed yeastGeneProducts accumulatedC16:2C16:3C18:3SbDES24.4 (4.2, 4.5)NDaND, not detected.NDaND, not detected.SbDES3NDaND, not detected.NDaND, not detected.2.1 (2.3, 1.9)SbDES2/34.3 ± 0.31.6 ± 0.2NDaND, not detected.a ND, not detected. Open table in a new tab Fatty Acid Analyses−Cellular fatty acids from yeast and plant tissues were extracted according to the method of Peyou-Ndi et al. (31.Peyou-Ndi M.M. Watts J.L. Browse J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 376: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Fatty acids were analyzed as methyl ester derivatives on an Agilent 6980GC (Agilent Technologies, Foster City, CA) coupled to a JEOL GCMate II mass spectrometer (JEOL USA, Inc., Peabody, MA) using an Omegawax 250™ (Supelco, St. Louis, MO) capillary column, 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm film thickness. The fatty acids were identified by comparison of their retention times and mass spectra with those of authentic standards (Sigma). The inlet (splitless), GC interface, and ion chamber temperatures were 250, 250, and 230 °C, respectively. The volume of sample injected was 1 μl. The GC temperature program for analysis of the hexane extracts, with the exception of the root hair sample, was initial 110 °C held for 5 min, raised to 160 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min, raised to 190 °C at the rate of 1 °C/min, raised to 280 °C at the rate of 2 °C/min and held at this temperature for 2 min. The carrier gas was ultra high purity helium, flow rate 1 ml/min. The root hair hexane extract was analyzed using the following temperature program: initial 80 °C held for 3 min, raised to 170 °C at the rate of 10 °C/ min, raised to 200 °C at the rate of 1 °C/min, raised to 280 °C at the rate of 5 °C/min and held at this temperature for 2 min. For further confirmation of double bond positions, methyl esters were converted into their 4,4-dimethyloxazoline (DMOX) derivatives as previously described (32.Fay L. Richli U. J. Chromatogr. 1991; 541: 89-98Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar), except that the derivatization reactions were performed at 170 °C for 15 h. DMOX derivatives were analyzed by GC/MS using the same conditions as described above for the analysis of fatty acid methyl ester derivatives. Isolation and Analysis of 9,12,15(9Z,12Z)-Hexadecatrienoic Acid (16:3 FA) by GC/MS and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy−The 16:3 fatty acid generated by yeast cells overexpressing the SbDES2 and SbDES3 cDNAs was extracted with hexane and isolated by thin layer chromatography using aluminum-backed silica F254 plates (10 × 20 cm2, 0.2 mm silica thickness; EM Science) impregnated with AgNO3. The silica gel plates were pretreated with a solution of 5% AgNO3 in MeOH-H2O (95:5, v/v), air-dried for 60 min, placed in an oven at 80 °C for 16 h, and allowed to cool to room temperature prior to use. Extracts were then applied to plates and developed using CH2Cl2:ethyl acetate (88:12). The 16:3 fatty acid migrated as a band of Rf 0.12, which was scraped from the plate, extracted with CHCl3, and then dried under a stream of nitrogen. An aliquot was analyzed by GC/MS using the same conditions as those described above for the yeast and plant tissue extracts. The 16:3 fatty acid was further characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Bruker DRX 400 UltraShield™ spectrometer, XWIN-NMR Software Version 3.1; Bruker, Billerica, MA). 1H NMR (CDCl3): δ 5.80 (m, 1H, H-15); 5.30 (m, 4H, H-9, 10, 12, 13); 4.98 (br d, J = 17 Hz, 1H, H-16a); 5.02 (br d, J = 10 Hz, 1H, H-16b); 4.90–5.01 (br dd, 2H, H-16); 3.71 (s, 3H, OCH3), 2.78 (m, 4H, H-11, 14), 2.32–2.36 (m, 2H, H-2), 2.00 (m, 2H, H-8), 1.49 (m, 2H, H-3), 1.25–1.29 (m, 8H, H-4, 5, 6, 7). Fatty Acid Composition Analyses in Sorghum Tissues−The biosynthesis of the allelochemical sorgoleone is a multistep process involving both plastidic and cytoplasmic enzymes (15.Fate G.D. Lynn D.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 11369-11376Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 16.Dayan F.E. Kagan I.A. Rimando A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28607-28611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). One of the key steps is the formation of hexadecatrienoic acid (16:3Δ9,12,15), an unsaturated fatty acid proposed to serve as a precursor for the associated PKS in the pathway. To examine the presence and distribution of 16:2Δ9,12 and 16:3Δ9,12,15 in S. bicolor, the fatty acid compositions of various tissues (mature and immature leaves, stems, shoot apices, panicles, and whole root systems) were analyzed (Fig. 2A). The predominance of palmitic (16:0), linoleic (18:2), and linolenic (18:3) acids was observed in all sorghum tissues. Traces of 16:2 (peak at 27.0 min) and 16:3 (peak at 29.7 min) were observed in the chromatograms of extracted roots, as indicated by mass spectral data (not shown); however the low levels for these peaks precluded their unequivocal identification. As sorgoleone is a major component in the oily exudate droplets associated with sorghum root hairs (13.Czarnota M.A. Paul R.N. Weston L.A. Duke S.O. Int. J. Plant Sci. 2003; 164: 861-866Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 14.Czarnota M.A. Rimando A.M. Weston L.A. J. Chem. Ecol. 2003; 29: 2073-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), root hairs were also isolated and analyzed for the presence of the precursor C16 fatty acids. Two peaks (corresponding to 16:2 and 16:3 fatty acid) were detected in the lipid extracts (Fig. 2B) by GC/MS. The mass spectrum (Fig. 2C) of the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) corresponding to the 16:2 peak (Fig. 2B) exhibited a prominent molecular ion at m/z = 266.2, characteristic of a 16:2 methyl ester and identical to that of methyl 9,12-hexadecadienoate, whereas the spectrum of the second peak corresponding to 16:3 (Fig. 2B) had a molecular ion at m/z = 264.1, and a fragmentation pattern consistent with hexadecatrienoate possessing a terminal methylene (Fig. 2D). Collectively, these data identify the 16:3Δ9,12 and 16:3Δ9,12,15 fatty acids in root hairs, and furthermore, strongly suggest that these precursors are primarily synthesized in root hair cells. Identification and Cloning of Fatty Acid Desaturases from Sorghum−To identify the desaturases associated with the sorgoleone biosythetic pathway, particularly those involved in the terminal bond desaturation of C16 fatty acid, an EST data base generated using a cDNA library prepared from isolated sorghum root hair cells was mined. Data base mining was performed both by using the Magic Gene Discovery software (33.Cordonnier-Pratt M.-M. Liang C. Wang H. Kolychev D.S. Sun F. Freeman R. Sullivan R. Pratt L.H. Comp. Funct. Genom. 2004; 5: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and by BLAST analysis. From these analyses, we identified 47 desaturase-like ESTs, which assembled into 11 unique contigs. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that 3 of 11 unique desaturase sequences (suggested by clustering) were preferentially expressed in root hair cells (Fig. 3). The corresponding full-length cDNA clones were isolated using cDNA prepared from root hair cells, and designated SbDES1, SbDES2, and SbDES3. The protein sequences deduced from SbDES3 and SbDES1 were 90% identical to each other, and shared only 33.7% and 33.8% identity, respectively, with the sequence from SbDES2. BLAST analysis of these protein sequences revealed that both SbDES3 and SbDES1 exhibited significant similarity to known plant fatty acid desaturase (FAD3-type) sequences, and SbDES2 displayed a high degree of similarity to plant FAD2-type sequences (34.Los D.A. Murata N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1394: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 35.Shanklin J. Cahoon E.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 611-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). A previously isolated putative desaturase clone from the S. bicolor × S. sudanense hybrid, SX17 (36.Yang X. Scheffler B.E. Weston L.A. J. Exp. Bot. 2004; 55: 2251-2259Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), showed homology to the SbDES3 clone described in this article. Based on comparisons to known FADs, the predicted protein sequences of all three cDNAs exhibited all of the major structural features possessed by FADs from other systems (34.Los D.A. Murata N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1394: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 35.Shanklin J. Cahoon E.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 611-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar), notably the predicted transmembrane domains and three highly conserved histidine-rich motifs occurring in most membrane-bound desaturases (Fig. 4). The conserved histidine-rich motifs are believed to be required for fatty acid desaturase activity (37.Shanklin J. Whittle E. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12787-12794Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). These comparisons were further supported by phylogenetic analyses (Fig. 5). SbDES2 was most closely related to members of the plant microsomal FAD2-type desaturase subfamily which, among those functionally characterized, typically desaturate C16/C18 acyl chains at the Δ12 position. In contrast, both SbDES1 and SbDES3 were positioned within the group corresponding to the plant microsomal FAD3-type desaturases, which mainly catalyze the conversion of 18:2 to 18:3 in phospholipids (38.Browse J. McConn M. James Jr., D. Miquel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16345-16351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the closely related FAD3-like enzymes from wheat and rice (GenBank™ accession nos. BAA28358 and BAA11397- Fig. 5) catalyze the conversion of linoleic acid (18:2Δ9,12) to linolenic acid (18:3Δ9,12,15) (39.Kodama H. Akagi H. Kusumi K. Fujimura T. Iba K. Plant Mol.

Functional Characterization of FAD-like cDNAs in S. cerevisiae−For functional characterization of the putative FADs, vectors were engineered for heterologous expression in S. cerevisiae. The complete ORFs for SbDES1, SbDES2, and SbDES3, were cloned into the yeast expression vector pYES2, resulting in the vectors pYE25B, pYE56D, and pYE2A, respectively. Constructs were transformed into the S. cerevisiae strain INVSc1, and the resulting transformants were cultivated in the presence and absence of exogenously supplied pa"
https://openalex.org/W2079840956,"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is recognized as a multifunctional protein that is involved in Cl– secretion, as well as acting as a regulatory protein. In order for acid secretion to take place a complex interaction of transport proteins and channels must occur at the apical pole of the parietal cell. Included in this process is at least one K+ and Cl– channel, allowing for both recycling of K+ for the H,K-ATPase, and Cl– secretion, necessary for the generation of concentrated HCl in the gastric gland lumen. We have previously shown that an ATP-sensitive potassium channel (KATP) is expressed in parietal cells. In the present study we measured secretagogue-induced acid secretion from wild-type and ΔF508-deficient mice in isolated gastric glands and whole stomach preparations. Secretagogue-induced acid secretion in wild-type mouse gastric glands could be significantly reduced with either glibenclamide or the specific inhibitor CFTR-inh172. In ΔF508-deficient mice, however, histamine-induced acid secretion was significantly less than in wild-type mice. Furthermore, immunofluorescent localization of sulfonylurea 1 and 2 failed to show expression of a sulfonylurea receptor in the parietal cell, thus further implicating CFTR as the ATP-binding cassette transporter associated with the KATP channels. These results demonstrate a regulatory role for the CFTR protein in normal gastric acid secretion.

Defective or deficient copies of the protein on the cell surface result in abnormalities in viscosity and electrolyte content of various exocrine secretions. To date more than 1000 different mutations in the CFTR gene have been identified and associated with cystic fibrosis, the most common being the ΔF508 mutation. 70% of defective alleles are affected by this mutation causing a deletion of a phenylalanine residue at position 508. The defective protein is synthesized but recognized as abnormal and targeted for degradation.

The CFTR protein is a cAMP-regulated chloride channel that belongs to the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette transporters. It contains two membrane-spanning domains, each consisting of six helices, as well as two nuclear binding domains responsible for ATP hydrolysis, and a regulatory domain with phosphorylation sites for various protein kinases.

Stimulation by either hormonal (histamine and gastrin) or neuronal (acetylcholine) secretagogues via their corresponding receptors on the basolateral plasma membrane results in translocation and insertion of the H,K-ATPase from its inactive state in the cytoplasmic tubulovesicle elements to the apical membrane of the secretory canaliculi. Proton secretion then occurs by exchanging an H+ ion for a K+ ion at the expense of 1 ATP molecule via the H,K-ATPase. This proton secretion is coupled with the extrusion of a Cl– ion via an apical Cl– channel. To maintain the exchange of H+ for K+ it is necessary to have an apical K+ channel that secretes K+ into the lumen of the gland to provide a continuing K+ gradient for the H,K-ATPase. This cyclic K+ movement and the concurrent H+ and Cl– secretion leads to the generation of 0.1 n HCl in the lumen of the gland, which is then secreted into the interior of the stomach (22Duman J.G.

The molecular identity of both the K+ channel and the Cl– channel on the apical surface of the parietal cell is still in question, however, recently a variety of K+ channel proteins have been identified in the parietal cell so that the secretion of K+ may either be associated with multiple channel proteins, or complexes of these different K+ channels that have been identified (29Forte J.G.

Based on the putative role of CFTR in modulating ROMK2 activity (a protein identified in the parietal cells), we postulated a probable role for CFTR in gastric acid secretion. Maldigestion is a well recognized problem in cystic fibrosis patients, generally ascribed to pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (34Armand M. Hamosh M. Philpott J.R. Resnik A.K. Rosenstein B.J.

In fact, decreased pH of duodenal content due to impaired HCO–3 secretion in these patients worsens the pancreatic insufficiency by decreasing survival of lipolytic activity of exogenous enzymes and precipitates bile acids causing malabsorption. Clearly the focus for patients to enhance nutrient absorption has been on the pancreas. In two studies, treatment with H2-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors to decrease acid secretion and raise duodenal pH improved fat absorption in CF patients (39DiMagno E.P. Best. Pract. Res. Clin. Gastroenterol. 2001; 15: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 40Kaur S. Norkina O. Ziemer D. Samuelson L.C. De Lisle R.C. Am. J.

Nutr. 1982; 1: 559-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) even described gastric acid hypersecretion associated with pancreatic insufficiency in these patients, although Roulet et al., Hallberg et al., and McDaniel et al. demonstrated normal acid secretion (42Hallberg K.

It would also be reasonable to predict that patients with cystic fibrosis are at an increased risk for developing duodenal ulcers due to impaired HCO–3 secretion and reduced mucosal defense. However, Akiba et al. demonstrated the contrary was true. He suggested that HCO–3-trapped intracellularly may protect the duodenal mucosa from acid injury and may explain why ulceration is a rare occurrence in CF patients (45Akiba Y. Jung M. Ouk S. Kaunitz J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: G753-G759PubMed Google Scholar, 46Aterman K. Am. J. Dis. Child. 1961; 101: 210-215PubMed Google Scholar, 47Lloyd-Still J.D. Lloyd-Still J.D.

This has not been described as a possible protective factor. Alternatively, misregulation of the potassium recycling pathway by an absent or defective CFTR protein may prevent H,K-ATPase activity, also leading to elevations in gastric pH and reduced risk of ulcers.

Furthermore, ΔF508 knock-out mice demonstrated reduced parietal cell acid secretion from isolated glands as well as in whole stomach preparations when compared with their wild-type counterparts upon histamine stimulation. Our studies show that CFTR plays an important regulatory role in the mouse stomach in secretagogue-induced acid secretion. Animals—Wild-type CD-1 and C57BL/6 mice were housed in climate- and humidity-controlled light-cycled rooms, fed standard rodent chow, and allowed free access to water. Data obtained from wild-type CD-1 and C57BL/6 mice are pooled in the results section. Gene-targeted mice homozygous for the ΔF508 mutation (64Zeiher B.G. Eichwald E. Zabner J. Smith J.J. Puga A.P.

Lab. Anim. Sci. 1996; 46: 612-618PubMed Google Scholar), were also used for the study. All animals were fasted with free access to water or water plus Colyte solution, for 12–18 h prior to sacrifice to ensure a consistent minimum of basal gastric acid secretion. Isolation of Gastric Glands and Digital Imaging for pHi— Wild-type and transgenic mice were sacrificed by overdose of isoflurane anesthesia. Following laparotomy a total gastrectomy was performed, and the stomach was immediately rinsed with ice-cold HEPES-buffered Ringer solution (125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 32.2 mm HEPES, and 5 mm glucose, pH 7.4) (Table 1) to eliminate any residual food matter, and kept in HEPES solution on ice until use. 0.5-cm square sections were cut from the corpus and transferred to the stage of a dissecting microscope where individual gastric glands were hand-dissected using a previously described technique (66Waisbren S.J. Geibel J. Boron W.F. Modlin I.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1013-C1027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After isolation, the glands were transferred to coverslips precoated with adhesive Cell-Tak (BD Cell-Tak Cell and Tissue Adhesion, BD Biosciences) and mounted in a thermostatically controlled chamber maintained at 37 °C on an inverted microscope (Olympus IX50) attached to a digital imaging system (Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA) for the duration of the experiment. Isolated gastric glands were loaded with 10 μm of the pH-sensitive dye 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and 6)-carboxyfluorescein acetomethyl ester (BCECF-AM, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 10 min in HEPES at 37 °C. After the glands were loaded, the chamber was flushed with HEPES-buffered Ringer solution to remove non-de-esterfied dye. BCECF was excited at 490 ± 10 and 440 ± 10 nm, and the emitted fluorescence light was measured at 535 ± 10 nm using an intensified charge-coupled device camera. Data were collected every 12 s, and the ratio at 490/440 nm was initially recorded as arbitrary pH units, which were then converted to absolute intracellular pH (pHi) using a high K+/nigericin calibration technique (67Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar). Data are expressed as changes in pHi (ΔpHi) per minute. Acid extrusion was monitored in the absence of HCO–3 as intracellular alkalinization after the removal of Na+ from the bath and using the NH4Cl prepulse technique, which caused reproducible and sustained intracellular acidification. Alkalinization rate (ΔpHi/min) for the calculation of Na+-independent pHi recovery (H,K-ATPase activity) was measured in the pH range of 6.50–7.00. Na+-free solution eliminated the possibility of contribution to alkalinization rates by the Na/H-exchanger.TABLE 1Solution compositionHEPES0 Na+ HEPES0 Na+ HEPES + NH4ClHigh K+NaCl115 mmNMDG132.8 mm132.8 mm32.8 mmNH4Cl20 mmKCl5 mm5 mm5 mm105 mmMgSO41.2 mm1.2 mm1.2 mm1.2 mmCaCl21 mm1 mm1 mm1 mmMannitol5 mmGlucose10 mm10 mm10 mmHEPES32.2 mm32.2 mm32.2 mm32.2 mmpH (37 °C)7.47.47.47 Open table in a new tab Secretagogues—100 μm histamine, 100 μm carbachol, or 100 μm pentagastrin were used to induce acid secretion by wild-type mouse gastric glands. 100 μm histamine was used to assess acid secretory capability of isolated gastric glands from ΔF508-defective mice. Pharmacological Inhibitors of CFTR—CFTR inhibition was carried out using 100 μm glibenclamide. All drugs were present in combination with BCECF during incubation of the glands for 10 min before the experiment, as well as in all perfusate solutions excluding the K+/nigericin calibration solution. In addition to glibenclamide, the recently developed more CFTR-specific inhibitor CFTR-inh172 was also used at a dose of 10 μm in SLO-permeabilized mouse gastric glands as described by Ammar et al. (63Ammar D.A. Zhou R. Forte J.G. Yao X. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: G23-G33Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). During the 10-min incubation period, 1 μg/ml SLO was used to permeabilize the cell in the presence of histamine and CFTR-inh172. CFTR-inh172 and histamine were then included in all of the above-mentioned perfusate solutions. Experiments with similar doses of histamine, SLO, and vehicle (Me2SO) in the absence of CFTR-inh172 were also performed as controls. Isolated Perfused Whole Stomach pH Measurements—A total gastrectomy was performed on wild-type and ΔF508 (–/–) mice, following anesthesia with isoflurane and ligation of both the gastroesophageal and gastroduodenal junctions. Once excised, 0.2 cc of non-buffered saline was injected into the isolated whole stomach. The entire stomach was placed in a bath of oxygenated HEPES-buffered Ringer solution at 37 °C, pH 7.4, for 60 min in the absence of secretagogue (control) or in the presence of 200 μm histamine. Following incubation, the injected non-buffered saline solution was aspirated from the stomach, and its pH was measured. Immunohistochemistry—Male C57BL/6 mice (20–25 g) were anesthetized with pentobarbital intraperitoneal and perfused through the left ventricle with PBS buffer, pH 7.4, followed by paraformaldehydelysine periodate fixative (68McLean I.W. Nakane P.K. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1974; 22: 1077-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (3198) Google Scholar). Following perfusion for 5 min with fixative, the stomachs were removed, cleaned from food residues, and fixed overnight at 4 °C by immersion in paraformaldehydelysine periodate. Stomachs were then washed three times with PBS, and the sections were cut at a thickness of 5 μm after cryoprotection with 2.3 m sucrose and 50% polyvinylpyrrolidone in PBS for at least 12 h. Immunostaining was carried out as described previously (53Kirchhoff P. Wagner C.A. Gaetzschmann F. Radebold K. Geibel J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: G1242-G1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, sections were incubated with 1% SDS for 5 min, washed three times with PBS, and incubated with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 15 min prior to the primary antibody. The primary antibodies mouse monoclonal anti-human β gastric H+/K+-ATPase (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO) and goat anti-SUR-1/2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), were diluted at 1:1000 and 1:100, respectively, in PBS and applied overnight at 4 °C. Sections were then washed twice for 5 min with high NaCl PBS (PBS plus 2.7% NaCl), once with PBS, and incubated with the secondary antibodies (donkey-anti-mouse Alexa 546, donkey-anti-goat Alexa 488, or donkey-anti-mouse Alexa 488, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at a dilution of 1:200 for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were then washed twice with high NaCl PBS and once with PBS before mounting with Vecta-Mount (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The specimens were viewed with a Nikon E-800 microscope or a Zeiss LSM-410 confocal microscope. Statistics—All data are summarized as means ± S.E. Significance was determined using an unpaired Student’s t test with p < 0.05 considered to be statistically significant. Secretagogue-induced H,K-ATPase Activity in Isolated Gastric Glands from Wild-type Mice in the Presence and Absence of 100 μm Glibenclamide—The first series of experiments in this study assessed CFTR involvement in parietal cell secretagogue-induced acid secretion by H,K-ATPase using the CFTR inhibitor glibenclamide at a dose of 100 μm. To confirm that stimulation of the Na+-independent pHi recovery represented H,K-ATPase activity, glands were preincubated with 100 μm of the specific inhibitor of gastric H,K-ATPase omeprazole for 10 min in the presence of the specific secretagogue used. Omeprazole prevented the stimulatory effect of all secretagogues on the Na+-independent pHi recovery rate. Histamine-induced, Na+-independent intracellular recovery (0.088 ± 0.006 pH unit/min, n = 65 parietal cells from 11 glands from 11 mice) was abolished in the presence of 100 μm glibenclamide (0.013 ± 0.001 pH unit/min, n = 79 parietal cells from 8 glands from 6 mice) (Fig. 1). In addition to 100 μm histamine, the other classic secretagogues were used to stimulate H,K-ATPase activity and examine glibenclamide (100 μm)-dependent inhibition of acid secretion. 100 μm carbachol-induced intracellular alkalinization rates (0.086 ± 0.005 pH unit/min, n = 29 parietal cells from 5 glands from 4 mice) were significantly inhibited in the presence of 100 μm glibenclamide (0.020 ± 0.003 pH unit/min, n = 44 parietal cells from 4 glands from 4 mice). Intracellular recovery rates induced by 100 μm pentagastrin (0.102 ± 0.006 pH unit/min, n = 54 parietal cells from 9 glands from 7 mice) were also significantly reduced in the presence of 100 μm glibenclamide (0.046 ± 0.003 pH unit/min, n = 60 parietal cells from 5 glands from 4 mice) (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Bar graph showing the effect of 100 μm glibenclamide on acid secretion by isolated gastric glands stimulated with one of the three classic secretagogues (histamine, carbachol, and pentagastrin).

Histamine-induced, Na+-independent intracellular recovery (0.135 ± 0.015 pH unit/min, n = 11 parietal cells from 2 glands from 2 mice) was significantly reduced in the presence of 10 μm CFTR-inh172 (0.038 ± 0.005 pH unit/min, n = 38 parietal cells from 4 glands from 2 mice) (Fig. 3). Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of the β subunit of H,K-ATPase inside the parietal cells of mouse gastric glands from the corpus (Fig. 4B). However, no signal for SUR 1 and 2 could be detected inside the parietal cells of the same section (see Fig. 4A). Histamine-induced H,K-ATPase Activity in Isolated Gastric Glands from Gene-targeted Mice Homozygous for the ΔF508 Mutation—To confirm a role for CFTR in H,K-ATPase-mediated acid secretion by the parietal cell, 100 μm histamine was used to stimulate Na+-independent H+ extrusion in isolated gastric glands from cystic fibrosis mice homozygous for the ΔF508 mutation. In comparison to alkalinization rates of histamine-induced isolated gastric glands from wild-type mice (0.088 ± 0.006 pH unit/min, n = 65 parietal cells from 11 glands from 11 mice), glands isolated from transgenic ΔF508 cystic fibrosis mice (Fig. 5) had a substantially diminished response to 100 μm histamine (0.022 ± 0.002 pH unit/min, n = 102 parietal cells from 12 glands from 9 mice) (Fig. 6).FIGURE 6Histamine stimulation of gastric glands isolated from cystic fibrosis mice homozygous for the ΔF508 mutation demonstrate poor acid secretory response to histamine compared with wild-type gastric glands.

Proteases for RIP cleave transmembrane regions of substrate membrane proteins. However, the molecular mechanisms for the proteolysis of membrane-embedded transmembrane sequences are largely unknown. Here we studied the environment surrounding the active site region of RseP, an Escherichia coli S2P ortholog involved in the σE pathway of extracytoplasmic stress responses. RseP has two presumed active site motifs, HEXXH and LDG, located in membrane-cytoplasm boundary regions. We examined the reactivity of cysteine residues introduced within or in the vicinity of these two active site motifs with membrane-impermeable thiol-alkylating reagents under various conditions. The active site positions were inaccessible to the reagents in the native state, but many of them became partially modifiable in the presence of a chaotrope, while requiring simultaneous addition of a chaotrope and a detergent for full modification. These results suggest that the active site of RseP is not totally embedded in the lipid phase but located within a proteinaceous structure that is partially exposed to the aqueous milieu.

Proteases contribute to functional regulation of some membrane proteins by introducing specific cleavages into them. For example, eukaryotic membrane-bound proteases such as ADAMs (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) catalyze ectodomain shedding in which they cleave off extracellular domains of membrane proteins, including cytokines, growth factors, and adhesion molecules (1.Huovila A.P.

Recent studies showed that S2P homologs of Vibrio cholerae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (YaeL and Rv2869c, respectively) are involved in the pathogenic activities of these bacteria upon infection to host cells (6.Makinoshima H.

A. 2005; 102: 16403-16408Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, RseP (formerly called YaeL) is the S2P ortholog and is an essential regulator of the σE pathway of extracytoplasmic stress responses (7.Kanehara K. Ito K. Akiyama Y. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2147-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 8.Alba B.M. Leeds J.A. Onufryk C. Lu C.Z. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2156-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). σE is an alternative σ factor dedicated to this stress response and kept inactive by binding to the cytoplasmic domain of the membrane-bound anti-σE protein, RseA, under unstressed conditions (17.Missiakas D. Mayer M.P. Lemaire M. Georgopoulos C. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 355-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 18.De Las Peñas A. Connolly L. Gross C.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 373-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Extracytoplasmic stresses such as accumulation of unassembled outer membrane proteins in the cell envelope activate DegS, another membrane protease with a periplasmic active site, which cleaves RseA on the periplasmic side (site-1 cleavage) (19.Walsh N.P. Alba B.M. Bose B. Gross C.A. Sauer R.T. Cell. 2003; 113: 61-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Subsequently, RseP introduces the site-2 cleavage into RseA, liberating a complex between the RseA cytoplasmic domain and σE from the membrane (7.Kanehara K. Ito K. Akiyama Y. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2147-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 8.Alba B.M. Leeds J.A. Onufryk C. Lu C.Z. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2156-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Our in vivo and in vitro studies showed that RseP cleaves RseA within its transmembrane segment (9.Akiyama Y. Kanehara K. Ito K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4434-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The RseA cytoplasmic domain thus released to the cytoplasm is degraded by cytoplasmic proteases such as ClpXP, leading to the full activation of σE (20.Flynn J.M. Levchenko I. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2292-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The site-2 cleavage of RseA by RseP is usually dependent on the prior action of DegS; in this way short-circuited cleavage of intact RseA by RseP and consequent uncontrolled elevation in the expression of the σE-controlled genes are avoided (7.Kanehara K. Ito K. Akiyama Y. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2147-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 8.Alba B.M. Leeds J.A. Onufryk C. Lu C.Z. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2156-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Several elements, including the periplasmic PDZ domain of RseP, the Gln-rich regions in the RseA periplasmic domain, and periplasmic protein RseB, are involved in this negative regulation (21.Kanehara K. Ito K. Akiyama Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6389-6398Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 22.Grigorova I.L. Chaba R. Zhong H.J. Alba B.M. Rhodius V. Herman C. Gross C.A.

RseP has unexpectedly wide substrate specificity in that it can cleave transmembrane sequences derived from lactose permease (LacY) and the signal sequence of β-lactamase that share no apparent sequence homology with the RseA transmembrane segment (9.Akiyama Y. Kanehara K. Ito K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4434-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Helix-destabilizing residues in transmembrane sequences of substrates facilitate the proteolysis by RseP (9.Akiyama Y. Kanehara K. Ito K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4434-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Although extensive studies have characterized the biological functions of the RIP proteases, including those of the S2P family proteins, their molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Generally, RIP proteases have their active site residues located in predicted transmembrane segments and they are believed to catalyze proteolysis within the lipid bilayer (3.Weihofen A. Martoglio B. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 71-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 4.Wolfe M.S. Kopan R. Science. 2004; 305: 1119-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). This notion poses a question of how hydrolysis of a peptide bond is facilitated in the lipid environment with limited availability of water. Here, as an attempt to assess the environment around the active site motifs of RseP, we examined the ability of membrane-impermeable thiol-alkylating reagents to access engineered Cys residues placed at or around the active sites. Our results suggest that the proteolytic active site is not completely embedded in the lipid phase but is in a folded structure that is either partly integrated into or stabilized by the lipid bilayer.

Gene. 2001; 281: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) carried the rseP gene under the ara promoter control. pSTD881 (HA-MBP-RseA140) and pSTD1017 (HA-MBP-RseA(LacYTM1)140) were constructed by ligating a KpnI-HindIII fragment of pSTD797 (9.Akiyama Y. Kanehara K. Ito K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4434-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and a KpnI-HindIII fragment of pSTD835 (9.Akiyama Y. Kanehara K. Ito K.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4434-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and plasmids encoding single Cys derivatives of RseP-His6-Myc were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of pSTD892. The DNA sequences of the mutated genes were confirmed. Complementation Assays−KK31 (a ΔrseP strain having pKK6 with ara-controlled rseP) was transformed further with a plasmid carrying the wild type or mutant forms of lac-controlled rseP-his6-myc and grown in l-arabinose (0.2%) at 30 °C. The cultures were serially diluted with 0.9% saline, and portions of the diluted cultures were spotted on L agar plates containing 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (test plates) or 0.2% arabinose (control plates) and incubated at 30 °C. Analysis of the in Vivo Proteolytic Activities of the Single Cys Derivatives of RseP-His6-Myc−Cells of KK211 (ΔrseA ΔrseP) carrying pSTD881 (HA-MBP-RseA140) and KK374 (ΔrseA ΔrseP ΔdegS) carrying pSTD1017 (HA-MBP-RseA-(LacYTM1)140) were transformed further with a plasmid encoding a derivative of RseP-His6-Myc to be tested. They were grown in M9 medium supplemented with 20 amino acids (20 μg/ml each), thiamine (2 μg/ml), glucose (0.4%), and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) at 30 °C for 3 h. Proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-Myc and anti-HA antibodies as described previously (9.Akiyama Y. Kanehara K. Ito K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4434-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Assays for Alkylation of Single Cys RseP Derivatives−Cells of KK374 (ΔrseA ΔrseP ΔdegS) carrying a plasmid encoding a RseP-His6-Myc derivative were grown in L medium containing 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 1 mm cAMP at 30 °C for 3.5 h. They were collected by centrifugation, washed with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, suspended in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and disrupted by sonication. After removal of unbroken cells, total membranes containing cytoplasmic and outer membranes were precipitated by ultracentrifugation and suspended in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 15% glycerol, and 1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. This membrane fraction containing inverted membrane vesicles (IMVs) (see below) was used for thiol alkylation experiments. Protease accessibility tests of three cytoplasmic membrane proteins of known orientations, HflK, HflC, and FtsH, confirmed that these membrane preparations contained cytoplasmic membrane vesicles of homogeneously inverted sideness (supplemental Fig. S1 and data not shown). In AMS and EMA modification experiments, samples were subjected to the primary modification with either of these reagents and then to denaturation with SDS and the secondary modification by malPEG. We monitored the SDS-PAGE mobility retardation by the latter modification, representing the AMS- or EMA-unmodified fraction. IMVs were treated with 1 mm AMS or 0.5 mm EMA in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, in the presence or absence of 4 m GdnHCl and/or 1% Triton X-100 at 24 °C for the indicated time periods. Although we used 4 m GdnHCl in most experiments, results were essentially the same when the denaturant concentration was increased to 6 m in confirmatory experiments examining some crucial samples. Samples were then incubated with 62.5 mm dithiothreitol at 24 °C for 18 min to quench AMS or EMA, and proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and solubilized in buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1% SDS, and 1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. They were incubated further with malPEG (5 mm final concentration) at 37 °C for 30 min with vigorous mixing and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-Myc antibodies. For direct treatment of IMVs with malPEG, experiments were carried out as above except for the following two points: first, 5 mm malPEG was used instead of AMS or EMA and, second, proteins were acid precipitated and SDS solubilized for analysis by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting without any post-denaturation treatment with malPEG. In these experiments, the treatment of samples with Cys-alkylating reagents was carried out in the presence of a thiol-reducing reagent, Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, to avoid the formation of any artificial disulfide bond between the Cys residues in the RseP derivatives and other thiols and consequent interference with alkylation of the target Cys residues. The proportion of a single Cys derivative of RseP-His6-Myc that was modified with AMS or EMA was calculated according to the following equation: AMS or EMA modification (%) = 100 × (a-b)/a, in which a is the ratio of the malPEG-modified forms to total RseP-His6-Myc in the control sample that was prepared without AMS or EMA treatment and b is the ratio of the malPEG-modified forms to total RseP-His6-Myc in the AMS- or EMA-treated sample. For some unknown reasons, the RseP-His6-Myc derivatives with a single Cys residue at position 399, 400, or 408 showed low malPEG modification even when malPEG treatment was carried out after IMV proteins were directly acid precipitated and SDS solubilized. These proteins were not analyzed in this study. Construction and Activities of Single Cys Derivatives of RseP−To investigate the environments surrounding the active site of RseP, we constructed RseP variants having single cysteines at designated positions (Fig. 1) and examined their reactivities to membrane-impermeable Cys-specific alkylating reagents. We first eliminated the 2 intrinsic Cys residues (Cys-33 and Cys-427) in RseP-His6-Myc by changing them to Ala. Then selected residues in TM1 (the first transmembrane segment)-C1 (the first cytoplasmic loop) including the HEXXH motif as well as those in TM3-C2 including the LDG motif (Fig. 1) were mutated to Cys individually. The 2 His residues in the HEXXH motif are supposed to act as ligands for zinc coordination while the Glu residue is supposed to be directly involved in catalysis (5.Kinch L.N. Ginalski K. Grishin N.V. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Although the role of the LDG motif is unclear, this evolutionarily conserved and essential motif has been suggested to constitute the proteolytic active site of RseP together with the HEXXH motif (5.Kinch L.N. Ginalski K. Grishin N.V. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 10.Brown M.S. Ye J. Rawson R.B. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). Cys-less RseP is functional as it complemented the ΔrseP mutation (data not shown). As expected, a Cys substitution for any of the conserved residues (His-22, Glu-23, His-26, and Asp-402) in the HEXXH and LDG motifs abolished the complementation activity. All the other single Cys RseP derivatives, except N389C, were active in complementation (data not shown). We examined in vivo protease activities of the single Cys RseP derivatives by co-expressing them with a model substrate, HA-MBP-RseA(LacYTM1)140, having the first transmembrane region of LacY (9.Akiyama Y. Kanehara K. Ito K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4434-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) in the ΔrseP strain and examining the molecular sizes of the substrate protein accumulated in the cell by anti-HA immunoblotting (Fig. 2). All the RseP derivatives accumulated in the cell at levels comparable with the cellular abundance of the similarly expressed Cys-less and wild type RseP proteins (Fig. 2A). Whereas HA-MBP-RseA(LacYTM1)140 was detected as the full-length product (UC) in cells without RseP or in cells with the active site-mutated RseP, it was efficiently converted to the cleaved form (CL) in the presence of wild type RseP, Cys-less RseP, or a complementation-positive single cysteine RseP variant (Fig. 2, A and B). Similar results were obtained when another model substrate, HA-MBP-RseA140, having the transmembrane segment of the physiological substrate, RseA, was used as a substrate (data not shown). Thus, most of the single Cys replacements outside the active site motifs are silent with respect to the cellular functions of RseP, suggesting that their effects on the structure of RseP are negligible. Although it is difficult to assess whether the Cys substitutions of the active site motif residues cause any gross structural alteration, we observed that the H22C active site mutant retained the substrate binding ability, 3K. Koide, K. Ito, and Y. Akiyama, unpublished results. arguing against the above possibility. AMS Modification Assay to Probe the Environments of the Engineered Cys Residues−We first chose several Cys substitutions at regions predicted to be cytoplasmically exposed, periplasmically exposed, or membrane embedded based on the amino acid sequence information. Residues Ala-77 and Gly-416 are located in regions locally rich in charged residues in the C1 and the C2 loop, respectively (Fig. 1). IMVs were prepared from cells expressing either RseP(A77C)-His6-Myc or RseP(G416C)-His6-Myc and incubated with 1 mm AMS, an membrane-impermeable Cys-alkylating reagent of ∼500 Da, at 24 °C for various periods (Fig. 3). After quenching AMS with dithiothreitol, proteins were acid denatured, solubilized with SDS, and subjected to the second Cys alkylation with malPEG to modify all the sulfhydryl groups that had survived the first modification with AMS. The malPEG modification can be detected by the marked mobility retardation upon SDS-PAGE separation due to the addition of its molecular mass of ∼5 kDa to the modified protein. A distinct advantage of this assay over the conventional one that uses a radio- or a ligand-labeled Cys-alkylating reagent is that both the modified and unmodified proportions are visible directly and quantifiable unequivocally. When IMVs were directly treated with AMS, the AMS modification of the Cys residues at positions 77 and 416 proceeded relatively slowly, requiring ∼30 min to reach the level of 60–70%. On the other hand, these Cys residues were modified much more rapidly (within 5 min) and almost thoroughly when AMS treatment was carried out in the presence of 4 m GdnHCl, which should have denatured domains sufficiently exposed to the aqueous phase. Because the modification was also accelerated by treatment of IMVs with 1% Triton X-100, the membrane anchoring of RseP as well seems to contribute to the folding of the position 77 and position 416 regions of RseP. The fact that the modification went to completion without any denaturant or detergent, apart from their kinetic effects, indicates that these residues are indeed located in the soluble cytoplasmic region of the protein. Next, we examined AMS modifiability of cysteines introduced at position 136 and position 386 in the predicted second periplasmic region. We found that they were significantly modified when AMS modification was carried out using not only the intact spheroplasts (data not shown) but also IMVs (Fig. 4). The intactness and the sideness of IMVs were confirmed by proteinase K accessibility tests (supplemental Fig. S1). The exact reasons are unknown for the apparent access of AMS to the luminal side of IMVs, an observation with precedents (30.Kimura T. Ohnuma M. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 580-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 31.Kuwabara N. Inoue H. Tsuboi Y. Nakamura N. Kanazawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40567-40575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The simplest explanation may be that the small volume of the IMV lumen can be equilibrated rapidly even by slow diffusion of AMS across the membrane, although other possibilities such as translocation mediated by some channel-like membrane proteins and incomplete sealing of IMVs after the cell disruption cannot be excluded. In any case, our primary objective to distinguish between sequestered and exposed residues is not critically affected by the above observations. We then examined RseP positions 13 and 386, expected to be lipid embedded (Fig. 5). These positions reside within clusters of hydrophobic residues in the middle of the predicted TM1 and TM3 segments, respectively (Fig. 1B). In contrast to the Cys residues in the cytoplasmic and periplasmic loop regions, those at positions 13 and 386 were not at all modified with AMS in the native membranes. Neither the presence of GdnHCl alone nor Triton X-100 alone greatly accelerated the modification. Rapid and quantitative modification of Cys residues at these positions was observed only when the membranes were treated with the denaturant and the detergent simultaneously. The synergistic effects of the chaotrope and the detergent suggest that both integration into the lipid phase and local folding of the protein contribute to the stable structure that prevents the AMS access to Val-13 and Ile-386. In any case, these residues are fully sequestered from the aqueous phase. Taken together, our model experiments show that the AMS modifiability assays can provide faithful information on the environment of a target Cys residue with respect to its exposure to the aqueous phase versus sequestration within the lipid phase and/or a protein fold. AMS Modifiability of Cys Residues in the Active Site Regions−We prepared IMVs from cells expressing each of the RseP derivatives having a single Cys residue within and in the vicinity of the HEXXH motif (Fig. 1B) and treated them with AMS for 0–30 min either without any addition, in the presence of GdnHCl, or in the presence of GdnHCl plus Triton X-100. The fractions of the AMS-modified RseP after 15 min of incubation are shown in Fig. 6A, and the time courses of AMS modification for the Cys residues introduced at the positions of the HEXXH motif are shown in Fig. 6B. None of the TM1-C1 Cys residues examined was alkylated significantly upon AMS treatment of intact IMV, whereas they were fully reactive with AMS in the presence of the denaturant and the detergent. However, these Cys residues were different with respect to their AMS reactivities in the presence of GdnHCl alone. Those on the N-terminal side of the HEXXH motif (positions 16, 20, and 21) did not react with AMS even in the presence of GdnHCl, suggesting either that they are membrane embedded or that lipid phase integration of RseP stabilizes a proteinaceous structure that embraces them. The residues at the C-terminal side of the active site (positions 27, 30, 33, and 37) became almost completely accessible to AMS after GdnHCl denaturation. The latter residues may be located within a proteinaceous structure exposed to the cytoplasm. The Cys residues introduced at positions 22–26 within the motif showed intermediate extents of GdnHCl enhancement in AMS modification, indicating that these residues are partially exposed but still stabilized significantly by the lipid phase integration. These results suggest that both folding and lipid integration contribute to the sequestering of the HEXXH motif residues (22.Grigorova I.L. Chaba R. Zhong H.J. Alba B.M. Rhodius V. Herman C.

To identify proteins that interact with KLF5, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of a 17-day mouse embryo cDNA library with KLF5 as bait. The screen revealed 21 preys clustered in four groups as follows: proteins mediating gene expression, metabolism, trafficking, and signaling. Among them was protein inhibitor of activated STAT1 (PIAS1), a small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) ligase that regulates transcription factors through SUMOylation or physical interaction. Association between PIAS1 and KLF5 was verified by co-immunoprecipitation. Structural determination showed that the acidic domain of PIAS1 bound to both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of KLF5 and that this interaction was inhibited by the amino terminus of PIAS1. Indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated that PIAS1 and KLF5 co-localized to the nucleus. Furthermore, the PIAS1-KLF5 complex was co-localized with the TATA-binding protein and was enriched in RNA polymerase II foci. Transient transfection of COS-7 cells by PIAS1 and KLF5 significantly increased the steady-state protein levels of each other. Luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that PIAS1 significantly activated the promoters of KLF5 and PIAS1 and synergistically increased the transcriptional activity of KLF5 in activating the cyclin D1 and Cdc2 promoters. Importantly, PIAS1 increased the ability of KLF5 to enhance cell proliferation in transfected cells. These results indicate that PIAS1 is a functional partner of KLF5 and enhances the ability of KLF5 to promote proliferation.

Structural determination showed that the acidic domain of PIAS1 bound to both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of KLF5 and that this interaction was inhibited by the amino terminus of PIAS1. Indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated that PIAS1 and KLF5 co-localized to the nucleus. Furthermore, the PIAS1-KLF5 complex was co-localized with the TATA-binding protein and was enriched in RNA polymerase II foci. Transient transfection of COS-7 cells by PIAS1 and KLF5 significantly increased the steady-state protein levels of each other. Luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that PIAS1 significantly activated the promoters of KLF5 and PIAS1 and synergistically increased the transcriptional activity of KLF5 in activating the cyclin D1 and Cdc2 promoters. Importantly, PIAS1 increased the ability of KLF5 to enhance cell proliferation in transfected cells. These results indicate that PIAS1 is a functional partner of KLF5 and enhances the ability of KLF5 to promote proliferation. Understanding the molecular basis of cellular proliferation and signaling is an important goal in studying various disease conditions. Regulation of gene transcription plays an essential role in these processes. A number of Krüppel-like transcription factors play important roles in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation or in the pathogenesis of many diseases. Among them is Krüppel-like factor (KLF) 2The abbreviations used are: KLF, Krüppel-like factor; ANKRD17, ankyrin-repeat domain 17; ARFGAP3, ADP-ribosylation factor GTPase-activating protein 3; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; DCK, deoxycytidine kinase; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; FXNa, putative amino peptidase FXNa; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HA, hemagglutinin; HNRPF, heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein F; ICGC, interchromatin granule cluster; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; PCCA, propionyl coenzyme A carboxylase,α; PIAS1, protein inhibitor of activated STAT1; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PMM2, phosphomannomutase 2; pol II, RNA polymerase II; RRX, Rhodamine Red-X; SAF-A, scaffold attachment factor A; SAF-B, scaffold attachment factor B; SFRS15, splicing factor, arginine/serine-rich 15; SNAP23, synaptosomal associated protein 23; SNX3, sorting nexin 3; STAT1, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1; SUMO, small ubiquitin-like modifier; TBP, TATA-binding protein; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. 5, which belongs to the Sp/KLF family of transcription factors (1.Bieker J.J.

A mechanism by which KLF5 accomplishes its proproliferative effect is to transcriptionally activate several cell cycle-promoting genes, including cyclin D1, cyclin B1, and Cdc2 (9.Bateman N.W. Tan D.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3404-3413Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). As such, KLF5 has been shown to be an important mediator for the transforming effect of oncogenic H-Ras (11.Nandan M.O. Chanchevalap S. Dalton W.B. Yang V.W. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4757-4762Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 12.Nandan M.O. Yoon H.S. Zhao W. Ouko L.A. Chanchevalap S. Yang V.W. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3404-3413Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Upon overexpression, KLF5 itself leads to cellular transformation (13.Sun R. Chen X. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6897-6900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). These studies illustrate an important function of KLF5 in regulating cellular proliferation. To further elucidate the biochemical mechanisms of action of KLF5 in regulating physiologically relevant processes such as growth and proliferation, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify its interacting partners. Among the preys identified was protein inhibitor of activated STAT1 (PIAS1). The interaction between KLF5 and PIAS1 was further characterized. PIAS1 is a member of the PIAS family of proteins consisting of PIAS1, PIAS3, PIASx, and PIASy (14.Shuai K. Liu B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 593-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Mammalian PIAS proteins were initially identified as negative regulators of STAT signaling (15.Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K. Science. 1997; 278: 1803-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar, 16.Liu B. Liao J. Rao X. Kushner S.A. Chung C.D. Chang D.D. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10626-10631Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). PIAS proteins contain a RING domain and exhibit small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) E3 ligase activity (17.Jackson P.K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3053-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 18.Schmidt D. Muller S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 2561-2574Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). SUMO is a small protein with 32% identity to ubiquitin and is covalently attached to substrate proteins (19.Dohmen R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 113-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 20.Gill G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 21.Gill G.

SUMOylation typically occurs at the lysine residue of a consensus motif, ΨKXE (where Ψ is hydrophobic and X is any amino acid) (19.Dohmen R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 113-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 20.Gill G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 21.Gill G.

A. 2002; 99: 2872-2877Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), they can also regulate activities of their targets by protein-protein interaction without SUMOylation (14.Shuai K. Liu B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 593-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that PIAS1 directly binds to A/T-rich DNA segments through its SAP (SAF-A/B, Acinus, and PIAS) domain (30.Okubo S. Hara F. Tsuchida Y. Shimotakahara S. Suzuki S. Hatanaka H. Yokoyama S. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. Shindo H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31455-31461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). PIAS1 also interacts with TATA-binding protein (TBP), a rate-limiting factor for initiation of transcription (31.Prigge J.R. Schmidt E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12260-12269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). TBP is a subunit of TFIID, which is the first protein to bind to DNA during the formation of the preinitiation complex of RNA polymerase II (pol II). TFIID binding initiates the recruitment of other factors required for pol II to begin transcription (32.Timmers H.T. Meyers R.E. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8140-8144Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). pol II is mainly localized to nuclear speckles termed pol II foci (33.Iborra F.J. Pombo A. Jackson D.A. Cook P.R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Jackson D.A. Hassan A.B. Errington R.J. Cook P.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1059-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar), which overlie three spatially connected nuclear compartments, perichromatin fibrils, interchromatin granule clusters (ICGCs), and Cajal bodies (35.Dundr M. Misteli T. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Cajal bodies are initial assembly sites for pol II transcription machineries (35.Dundr M. Misteli T. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), which are delivered to ICGCs for storage and subsequently transported to active transcription sites located at the periphery of perichromatin fibrils, which represent nascent transcripts (35.Dundr M. Misteli T. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 36.Mintz P.J. Spector D.L. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 129: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Rapid shuttle of proteins between these compartments constantly occurs (35.Dundr M. Misteli T. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Remarkably, many of the TBP-interacting proteins isolated in yeast two-hybrid screens encoded either PIAS1 or PIAS3 (31.Prigge J.R. Schmidt E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12260-12269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Both PIAS1 and TBP bind to the minor groove of the A/T-rich DNA (30.Okubo S. Hara F. Tsuchida Y. Shimotakahara S. Suzuki S. Hatanaka H. Yokoyama S. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. Shindo H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31455-31461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 37.Kim J.L. Nikolov D.B. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 365: 520-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). Thus, PIAS1 may be important in regulating TBP. TBP is presumably localized to chromatin where transcription is initiated. However, it can also be localized to the storage/assembly sites for pol II transcription machineries such as Cajal bodies (38.Handwerger K.E. Murphy C. Gall J.G. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Previously, the role of PIAS1 as a SUMO E3 ligase was extensively studied. However, how PIAS1 acts as a transcriptional co-regulator was less well established, in part because the effects of PIAS1 in regulating transcription are highly context- and target-dependent. This study reports the identification of 21 preys that interact with KLF5 in a yeast two-hybrid screen. They include proteins involved in gene expression, metabolism, trafficking, and signaling. A specific interaction is demonstrated between KLF5 and PIAS1. A consequence of this interaction is enhanced steady-state levels of both proteins. This leads to a synergistic increase in the ability of KLF5 to transcriptionally activate a number of target genes that are important for cell cycle progression and to stimulate cell proliferation. Consistent with the up-regulation of KLF5 transcriptional activity by PIAS1, KLF5 and PIAS1 co-localize with TBP to pol II nuclear foci. These results indicate that PIAS1 is a positive regulator that enhances the transcriptional ability of KLF5 to promote proliferation. Plasmid Constructs−The bait plasmid, pGBKT7-KLF5, was constructed by fusing the coding region of mouse KLF5 (5.Conkright M.D. Wani M.A. Anderson K.P. Lingrel J.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1263-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain present in the pGBKT7 plasmid (Clontech). Several constructs were generated that contained partial deletions in the KLF5 sequence using appropriate restriction endonucleases. The pGADT7-Rec-PIAS1 plasmid was recovered from the yeast two-hybrid screen as a prey that specifically interacted with KLF5. Several deletion constructs were generated from this plasmid to produce truncated PIAS1 sequences. The pGL3-mPIAS1 luciferase reporter plasmid was generated by cloning 2 kb of the mouse PIAS1 promoter from genomic DNA using PCR. To generate the KLF5 luciferase reporter plasmid, pGL3-mKLF5, a 1.6-kb mouse KLF5 promoter was amplified from a bacterial artificial chromosome clone, RPCI-23 302C3 (ResGen, Invitrogen), and inserted into pGL3-Basic (Promega). Expression constructs containing 3xFLAG-PIAS1, 3xFLAG-PIAS3, and the PDGF-A luciferase reporter plasmids were generous gifts of Drs. K. Morohashi and D. Kaetzel (39.Komatsu T. Mizusaki H. Mukai T.

Gene (Amst.). 2005; 348: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). PMT3-KLF5, pMT3-KLF5-HA, and the cyclin D1 and Cdc2 luciferase reporter plasmids were described previously (11.Nandan M.O. Chanchevalap S. Dalton W.B. Yang V.W. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4757-4762Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 12.Nandan M.O. Yoon H.S. Zhao W. Ouko L.A. Chanchevalap S. Yang V.W. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3404-3413Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Yeast Two-hybrid Screening−To perform yeast two-hybrid screening, pGBKT7-KLF5 was used as the bait. This plasmid was transformed into the yeast strain AH109. The resulting strain was mated with the yeast strain Y187 pre-transformed with a MATCHMAKER 17-day mouse embryo cDNA library (Clontech) and selected on synthetic dropout (SD) plates lacking adenine, histidine, leucine, and tryptophan (SD/-ade/-his/-leu/-trp). Colonies obtained from the screen were confirmed by re-streaking on SD/-ade/-his/-leu/-trp containing X-gal. Plasmids from the positive clones were isolated, rescued in Escherichia coli, and sequenced to identify their cDNA inserts. The bait and prey were then co-transformed into AH109, and the specificity of the interactions was confirmed by growth on SD/-ade/-his/-leu/-trp plates. For deletion analysis, the various KLF5 bait and PIAS1 prey plasmids were co-transformed into AH109, and interactions were confirmed by growth on SD/-ade/-his/-leu/-trp in the absence or presence of X-gal. Transfection, Co-immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting− COS-7 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with pMT3 vector alone, pMT3-KLF5-HA, 3xFLAG-PIAS1, or pMT3-KLF5-HA and 3xFLAG-PIAS1. Twenty four hours following transfection, the cells were lysed by boiling in SDS sample buffer (0.625 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 8.75% glycerol containing 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), 5% of 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 5 μg/ml aprotinin) for 10 min. Then acid-washed glass beads (Sigma) were added, and the mixture was vigorously vortexed for 1 min to shear the DNA and reduce viscosity. The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 min, and the supernatant was saved for further analysis. For co-immunoprecipitation, COS-7 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids. Vector alone was also transfected whenever necessary to compensate for the total amount of plasmids transfected. One or 2 days after transfection, the cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 135 mm NaCl, and 20 mm NEM containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The lysate was incubated with a polyclonal anti-HA or monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) at 4 °C for 1 h. Pre-washed EZview Red protein G affinity gel (Sigma) was then added, and the mixture was rocked for an additional hour. The immune complexes were washed four times, and the precipitated proteins were detected by Western blotting with a monoclonal anti-HA (Covance), anti-FLAG (Sigma), or rabbit polyclonal anti-KLF5 antibody (raised against residues 95–111 of mouse KLF5). For immunoprecipitation of endogenous KLF5 and PIAS1, nuclear extracts from COS-7 cells were prepared, and immunoprecipitation was performed with a nuclear extract/co-immunoprecipitation kit (Active Motif). The extract was divided equally in half. Half of the extract was immunoprecipitated with a mouse monoclonal anti-PIAS1 antibody (Invitrogen), and the other half was immunoprecipitated with a mouse anti-HA antibody (Covance) as the control. This was followed by incubation with protein A-agarose beads (Upstate) in the presence of 5 mm NEM according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The precipitated proteins were detected by Western blotting with the rabbit anti-KLF5 and mouse anti-PIAS1. Immunofluorescence−COS-7 cells were transfected with vector alone, 3xFLAG-PIAS1, pMT3-KLF5-HA, or 3xFLAG-PIAS1 and pMT3-KLF5-HA. Twenty four hours following transfection, the cells were fixed with methanol and stained with mouse anti-FLAG and rabbit anti-HA antibodies (Sigma) followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse and rhodamine red-X (RRX)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The cells were then stained with Hoechst 33258 dye to visualize the nuclei. For bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation, the transfected cells were pulse-labeled with 100 μm BrdUrd for 30 min. After fixation in methanol, the cells were treated with 2 n HCl at room temperature for 30 min to denature the DNA, neutralized with 0.1 m sodium borate, pH 8.5, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h. The cells were stained sequentially with the following combination of antibodies: mouse anti-BrdUrd followed by a Cy5-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch), rabbit anti-HA (Sigma) followed by the RRX-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody, and FITC-conjugated chicken anti-FLAG (Immunology Consultants Laboratory). The cells were then stained with Hoechst dye to reveal the nuclei. Images were captured with an Axioskop 2 plus microscope (Zeiss). To demonstrate co-localization of KLF5 and PIAS1 with TBP, the HA-KLF5 and/or FLAG-PIAS1-transfected cells were stained with mouse anti-FLAG, chicken anti-HA (Chemicon), and rabbit anti-TBP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by FITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse, Rhodamine Red-X (RRX)-conjugated donkey anti-chicken, and aminomethylcoumarin-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch). As a control, the vector alone-transfected cells were stained with the same primary and secondary antibodies except anti-TBP. To demonstrate co-localization of KLF5 and PIAS1 with pol II, the HA-KLF5- and/or FLAG-PIAS1-transfected cells were stained with mouse anti-FLAG, chicken anti-HA (Chemicon), and a rabbit antibody raised against the large subunit of RNA polymerase II (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by FITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse, Rhodamine Red-X (RRX)-conjugated donkey anti-chicken, and Cy5-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The vector alone-transfected cells were stained with the same primary and secondary antibodies except anti-pol II. The cells were also stained with Hoechst dye to reveal the nuclei. Luciferase Assays−COS-7 cells were transfected with equal amounts of vector alone, pMT3-KLF5, 3xFLAG-PIAS1, or pMT3-KLF5 and 3xFLAG-PIAS1, together with the KLF5, PIAS1, PDGF-A, cyclin D1, or Cdc2-luciferase reporter. A Renilla luciferase control vector was co-transfected to normalize the transfection efficiency. Cell lysis and reporter assay were performed 2 days after the transfection with dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays−To examine the binding of KLF5 and PIAS1 to target promoters, COS-7 cells were transfected as described in the luciferase assays, except that pMT3-KLF5 was replaced with pMT3-KLF5-HA whenever necessary to efficiently pull down KLF5. The HA tag does not affect KLF5 activity. ChIP assays were performed with DNA purified from the corresponding cells, using chromatin immunoprecipitation assay kit (Upstate) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Immunoprecipitation was conducted using mouse anti-FLAG or rabbit anti-HA, KLF5, or FLAG antibody (Sigma), whereas mouse anti-His (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or normal rabbit serum (IgG) was used as the negative control. Nested PCR was performed after each immunoprecipitation. For the KLF5 promoter, the first-round PCR primers were GGAGAGATCTCCCTCCGCGTC and AGCGATCGCGATCCCACCTCGC. The second-round (nested) primers were GGAGAGATCTCCCTCCGCGTC and CGTCACCGCCGAGGTCCTC. For the PIAS1 promoter, the first-round primers were CGAGGGGGTAGTAACTGTCAAAC and TTGCGTCTGTCAGCGCAAGCG. The nested primers were CCGCTTGGCGCCATTAT and GTCCGCAAGCTTGCGTCTGTCAGCGCAAGCGC. For the PDGF-A promoter, the first-round primers were GGGGCTTTGATGGATTTAGCTGC and AGAGGGTTATAGCGCCGCC. The nested primers were ATTTAGCTGCTTGCGCG and AGAGGGTTATAGCGCCGCC. For the cyclin D1 promoter, the first-round primers were AGGAAATGCTGGCCACCATCTTG and GGTTTTCATAGAAATGCAAATCGC. The nested primers were CTGCTGGAATTTTCGGG and CGGCAGGCCACACGC. For the Cdc2 promoter, the first-round primers were TGAGGTAGAAACAAAGCACAGCG and AGAGCCAGCTTTGAAGCCAAGTG. The nested primers were ACATTTTTGAGGCGGTC and AGCCAAGTGCGAGCAG. A small fraction of each lysate prior to the immunoprecipitation was also amplified with nested PCR or with a GAPDH PCR mixture kit (Active Motif) as the positive and negative controls for input. Identification of Proteins That Interact with KLF5−To identify proteins interacting with KLF5, we screened a mouse 17-day embryonic cDNA library under high stringency with a KLF5-GAL4 DNA-binding domain fusion construct as the bait. We chose the embryonic library because KLF5 is highly expressed during this stage of development (8.Ohnishi S. Laub F. Matsumoto N. Asaka M. Ramirez F. Yoshida T. Terada M. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 217: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). After screening 106 independent clones with the bait, 30 positive clones that represented 21 genes were identified (Table 1). These preys can be divided into four groups. The largest group of the preys is involved or is predicted to be involved in the regulation of gene expression and contains ANKRD17, DnaJ homolog subfamily C member 4, HNRPF, PIAS1, PRIM2, RPS2, REC14, and SFRS15. The second group contains three known and one predicted metabolic enzymes, DCK, FXNa, PCCA, and PMM2, which catalyze nucleic acid, amino acid, lipid, and carbohydrate metabolism. The third group contains PI3KR1/p85α, the major regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). Strikingly, four proteins directly involved in intracellular trafficking, ARFGAP3, α-taxilin, SNAP23, and SNX3, were also isolated from the screen, and they make up the fourth group. Many of the preys are known nuclear proteins (Table 1).TABLE 1Proteins identified in the yeast two-hybrid screen that interacted with KLF5 The symbols used are as follows: ++, the prey is primarily localized to the nucleus; +, the prey has been reported to be localized to the nucleus although the nucleus is not the primary location; (–), the prey is localized in the cytoplasm but in a perinuclear location.Gene NameGene ontologyNuclearPIAS1Transcriptional co-regulator and SUMO E3 ligase++HNRPFPre-mRNA splicing factor that interacts with TBP and RNA polymerase II++PRIM2 (DNA primase 2)Primase essential to DNA replication++REC14 (recombination protein REC14)aPreys that were represented by more than one clonesTranscriptional regulation++SFRS15aPreys that were represented by more than one clonesPre-mRNA splicing factor that interacts with RNA polymerase II carboxyl-terminal domain++RPS2 (ribosomal protein S2)Ribosomal subunit+DNAJC4 (DnaJ homolog subfamily C member 4)Putative chaperone activityNDbND indicates not determinedANKRD17Marker for liver developmentNDDCKNucleic acid metabolism+FXNaaPreys that were represented by more than one clonesPutative amino peptidaseNDPCCAAmino acid and fatty acid metabolism+PMM2GDP-mannose and dolichol-phosphate-mannose synthesis(–)PI3KR1/p85α (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, regulatory subunit, polypeptide 1)PI 3-kinase signal pathways+α-TaxilinIntracellular vesicle transport+ARFGAP3Vesicle budding(–)SNAP23aPreys that were represented by more than one clonesMembrane fusion; vesicle targeting+SNX3Intracellular trafficking(–)KIAA1033UnknownNDLOC 380885UnknownNDRIKEN cDNA F830013N24UnknownNDRP23-418O21aPreys that were represented by more than one clonesUnknownNDa Preys that were represented by more than one clo"

The activity of GSK-3 is known to be modulated by protein phosphorylation and differential complex formation. However, little information is available regarding the function and regulation of plant GSK-3/shaggy-like kinases (GSKs). Analysis of the in vivo kinase activity of MsK1, a GSK from Medicago sativa, revealed that MsK1 is active in healthy plants and that MsK1 activity is down-regulated by the elicitor cellulase in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Surprisingly, cellulase treatment triggered the degradation of the MsK1 protein in a proteasome-dependent manner suggesting a novel mechanism of GSK-3 regulation. Inhibition of MsK1 kinase activity and degradation of the protein were two successive processes that could be uncoupled. In a transgenic approach, stimulus-induced inhibition of MsK1 was impeded by constant replenishment of MsK1 by a strong constitutive promoter. MsK1 overexpressing plants exhibited enhanced disease susceptibility to the virulent bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. MAP kinase activation in response to pathogen infection was compromised in plants with elevated MsK1 levels. These data strongly suggest that tight regulation of the plant GSK-3, MsK1, may be important for innate immunity to limit the severity of virulent bacterial infection.

Acta. 1984; 788: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Despite its name, GSK-3 is a multifunctional serine/threonine protein kinase that acts as a regulator of numerous signaling pathways (3Cohen P. Frame S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar, 4Doble B.W. Woodgett J.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar, 5Jope R.S. Johnson G.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar). As a component of the Wnt signaling pathway, GSK-3 participates in the regulation of cell proliferation, cell fate specification, and differentiation throughout the animal kingdom (6Logan C.Y. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 781-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (4179) Google Scholar, 7van Amerongen R. Berns A. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 1065-1072PubMed Google Scholar). Misregulation of this pathway promotes degenerative diseases and cancer. GSK-3 is present in a multiprotein complex that can have variable constituents. In the absence of Wnt, GSK-3 phosphorylates the transcriptional regulator β-catenin and thereby targets β-catenin for degradation. When cells receive Wnt signals, the protein complex undergoes rearrangement (8Li L. Yuan H. Weaver C.D. Mao J. Farr 3rd, G.H. Sussman D.J. Jonkers J. Kimelman D. Wu D.

As a consequence, β-catenin accumulates and modulates gene expression.GSK-3 is also an integral part of the mammalian phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, which is involved in controlling cell survival, proliferation, apoptosis as well as metabolism. Upon stimulation of this pathway by insulin, growth factors, or stress, GSK-3 is phosphorylated by protein kinase B (11Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4326) Google Scholar, 12Shaw M. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Biochemical and structural work suggest that the phosphorylated N terminus of GSK-3 prevents substrate binding and blocks access to the catalytic center (13Frame S. Cohen P. Biondi R.M. Mol.

Biol. 2001; 2: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar).GSK-3 is evolutionary conserved among eukaryotes. Mammals have two GSK-3 genes, whereas Drosophila melanogaster generates numerous isoforms from a single SHAGGY-locus by differential splicing. Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes four GSK-3 homologs involved in mitotic chromosome segregation, meiosis, stress response, and metabolic regulation. Plants have a family of GSK-3/SHAGGY-like kinases (GSKs) that can be grouped into four classes according to sequence similarity (16Jonak C. Hirt H.

Nam K.H. Science. 2002; 295: 1299-1301PubMed Google Scholar). bin2 is allelic to dwarf12 (30Choe S. Schmitz R.J. Fujioka S. Takatsuto S. Lee M.O. Yoshida S. Feldmann K.A. Tax F.E.

Biol. 2002; 242: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Brassinosteroids (BRs) are plant steroid hormones that are important for cell growth and development. BIN2 is a negative regulator of the Arabidopsis BR response. Genetic analyses place BIN2 downstream of the plasma-membrane leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase BRI1 (brassinosteroid-insensitive 1), which mediates the perception of BR signals (32Li J.

It has been proposed that BR signaling inhibits BIN2 activity; however, to date no BR-dependent regulation of BIN2 at the level of the transcript, the protein, or protein activity has been demonstrated. Recently, two additional BIN2-related GSKs have been implicated in BR signaling (39Vert G. Chory J. Nature. 2006; 441: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar).Some data point to a role for GSKs in plant stress responses. In Medicago sativa, WIG (wound-induced GSK) is activated upon wounding of leaves. Activation of WIG appears to be a post-translational process, whereas inactivation requires the transcription and translation of one or more proteins (20Jonak C. Beisteiner D. Beyerly J. Hirt H. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1467-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). MsK4 activity is rapidly induced in alfalfa roots by high salinity stress. Overexpression of MsK4 modulates stress tolerance and carbohydrate metabolism (40Kempa S. Rozhon W. Šamaj J. Erban A. Baluška F. Becker T. Haselmayer J. Schleiff S. Kopka J. Hirt H. Jonak C. Plant J., in press. 2007; Google Scholar). In A. thaliana, plants overexpressing AtGSK-1 showed enhanced salt and drought tolerance (41Piao H.L. Lim J.H. Kim S.J. Cheong G.W. Hwang I. Plant J. 2001; 27: 305-314Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Plant growth and development is severely affected by a multitude of adverse environmental conditions. To respond to these threats, plants have developed sophisticated signal transduction mechanisms that mediate and coordinate physiological responses. Although our knowledge about plant stress signaling has advanced, major gaps still remain. We aimed at identifying novel components in plant stress signal transduction. In a screen for stress-induced alteration of in vivo GSK kinase activities, we identified MsK1, an alfalfa GSK, as an elicitor-responsive GSK. Molecular and phenotypical analyses of transgenic plants indicate that MsK1 has a defense-related function in the plant innate immune response. Moreover, a novel molecular mechanism for GSK regulation is presented.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlant Cultivation—M. sativa cv. Europa plants were grown hydroponically for 4 days. After treatment with the indicated concentrations of cellulase (Fluka) or proteasome inhibitor MG115 (Sigma), roots were detached beneath the hypocotyl and shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen.A. thaliana ecotype Columbia (Col-0) seeds were germinated on 0.5× MS medium (Sigma). After 9 days, seedlings were transferred to soil. Plants were grown under long day conditions (16 h light/8 h dark) at 50 μE/(m2 s) cool white light. For infection with Pseudomonas syringae, plants were grown under short day conditions (8 h light/16 h dark). For kinase assays and Western analysis, leaves were detached at the petioles and incubated for 2 h in 0.5× MS medium plus 2% glucose prior to addition of cycloheximide (Sigma), cellulase, or treatment with P. syringae as indicated.Generation of MsK1-Myc Overexpression Plants—The MsK1 cDNA was tagged with the Myc epitope and put under control of the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35 S-promotor and cloned into the binary plant expression vector pGreenII 0029 (42Hellens R.P. Edwards E.A. Leyland N.R. Bean S. Mullineaux P.M. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 42: 819-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). This construct was used to transform A. thaliana Col-0 plants with the floral dipping method (43Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformed plants were selected by germination on kanamycin-containing medium.MsK1-specific Antibody—A rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against the synthetic peptide QCPFLGL from the C terminus of MsK1 (Davids Biotechnologie). Crude serum antibody was used for immunocomplex kinase assays. For Western analysis, peptide affinity-purified antibody was used. T3/T7 coupled in vitro translation kit (Amersham Biosciences) was used to in vitro translate MsK1, MsK2, MsK4, WIG, and SIMK. Immunodepletion assays were performed by preincubation of 2 μl of MsK1 antibody with 20 μg of immunization peptide at 4 °C prior to Western blotting.Protein Extraction from Plant Material—Total proteins were extracted from A. thaliana leaves and M. sativa roots by grinding in homogenization buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 15 mm EGTA, 75 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm NaF, 0.5 mm NaVO3, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 15 mm 4-nitrophenyl phosphate bis-[tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane], 0.1% Tween 20, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin) as described (44Jonak C.

Protein amounts were determined by the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s specifications.Western Analysis—Equal amounts of proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Milipore). Membranes were probed with anti-MsK1 or anti-Myc (A-15, Santa-Cruz) antibodies. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Santa-Cruz) was used as a secondary antibody. The reaction was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using the CDP-Star™ detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences).Immunocomplex Kinase Assays—100 μg of total protein extracts were used for immunocomplex kinase assays as previously described (44Jonak C.

Depending on the batch, the substrate myelin basic protein (MBP; Sigma) was a single or a double band. MsK1-antibody was used to immunoprecipitate MsK1.

Bacteria were grown on NYGA medium (0.5% trypton peptone, 0.3% yeast extract, 2% glycerol, 1.5% Bacto-agar) at 28 °C. For plant infection, liquid cultures were inoculated from plates and grown in NYG medium (0.5% trypton peptone, 0.3% yeast extract, 2% glycerol) at 28 °C overnight. Plants were vacuum infiltrated and bacterial titers were determined as described in Ref. 48Whalen M.C. Innes R.W. Bent A.F. Staskawicz B.J. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar.RESULTSMsK1 Activity and Protein Levels Are Regulated by Cellulase—To identify novel functions for plant GSKs, we transiently expressed alfalfa GSKs in protoplasts and analyzed their kinase activities in response to various treatments (50Wrzaczek M. MsK1, a Glycogen Synthase Kinase from Medicago sativa, Modulates Plant Stress Tolerance. 2004; (Ph.D. thesis, University of Vienna)Google Scholar). MsK1 emerged as a potential stress-regulated signaling component. Previously, MsK1 was shown to be expressed in leaves, stems, flowers, and roots (19Pay A. Jonak C. Bogre L. Meskiene I. Mairinger T. Szalay A. Heberle-Bors E. Hirt H. Plant J. 1993; 3: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To study the function of the MsK1 protein kinase in response to stress, we produced an antibody against MsK1 (supplemental Fig. 1) and used this antibody to determine the in vivo kinase activity of MsK1 by immunokinase assays after exposure of plants to various challenges. We found MsK1 activity to be high under normal growth conditions, whereas exposure to cellulase, which has been described as an elicitor of plant defense responses (46Rentel M.C. Lecourieux D. Ouaked F. Usher S.L. Petersen L. Okamoto H. Knight H. Peck S.C. Grierson C.S. Hirt H. Knight M.R. Nature. 2004; 427: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), caused reduced MsK1 activity in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Alfalfa seedlings were exposed to increasing concentrations of cellulase for 10 min. Protein extracts from roots of these seedlings were immunoprecipitated with the MsK1 antibody. Subsequent kinase assays using MBP as a substrate showed that exposure to 0.05% or higher concentrations of cellulase abated MsK1 kinase activity (Fig. 1A, upper panel). Protein gel blot analyses of the same cell extracts revealed that MsK1 protein levels also decreased with increasing cellulase concentrations concomitant with the appearance of a high molecular smear (Fig. 1A, middle panel). Staining of the membrane with Ponceau controlled for equal protein loading (Fig. 1A, lower panel). Cellulase treatment did not affect the steady state RNA expression level of MsK1 (data not shown).To examine the kinetics of MsK1 down-regulation by cellulase, roots were treated with 0.1% cellulase and samples were taken at different time points. Immunokinase assays with the MsK1 antibody showed that MsK1 activity dropped as early as 30 s after application of cellulase and stayed low during the experimental period of 1 h (Fig. 1B, upper panel). In contrast to the rapid decline in MsK1 activity, MsK1 protein levels remained high for 5 min before decreasing (Fig. 1B, middle panel). The high molecular smear appeared after only 30 s of cellulase treatment. These data indicate that the inhibition of MsK1 activity precedes the degradation of the MsK1 protein.Proteasome-dependent Regulation of MsK1—Proteasome-mediated protein degradation plays an important role in many signaling pathways (51Moon J. Parry G. Estelle M. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 3181-3195Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 52Smalle J. Vierstra R.D. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2004; 55: 555-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar, 53Sullivan J.A. Shirasu K. Deng X.W. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 948-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). To test whether the disappearance of the MsK1 protein and the concomitant appearance of the high molecular smear depend on the 26 S proteasome, seedlings were pretreated with the proteasome inhibitor N-carbobenzoxyl-Leu-Leu-norvalinal (MG115) prior to cellulase exposure. Immunokinase assays showed that MsK1 activity was comparable in untreated and MG115-treated roots. Application of cellulase decreased MsK1 activity irrespective of the proteasome-inhibitor pretreatment (Fig. 2, upper panel). However, in contrast to roots that had been directly challenged with cellulase, MsK1 protein levels of MG115-pretreated roots remained high (Fig. 2, middle panel). Taken together, inhibition of the proteasome with MG115 prevented MsK1 degradation but did not prevent inhibition of MsK1 kinase activity. These results indicate that MsK1 is controlled at two levels that can be uncoupled: MsK1 kinase activity is first blocked by cellulase and MsK1 protein is then subsequently degraded by a proteasome-dependent mechanism.FIGURE 2Proteasome-dependent regulation of MsK1 protein levels. Seedlings were preincubated with 100 μm N-carbobenzoxyl-Leu-Leu-norvalinal (MG115) for 2 h prior to treatment with 0.1% cellulase for the indicated time points. Control seedlings (Ctrl) were not pretreated. MsK1 kinase activity was measured in immunocomplex kinase assays using MBP as a substrate (upper panel). MsK1 protein levels were detected by Western blot analysis (middle panel).

We generated A. thaliana plants expressing a Myc-tagged version of MsK1 under the control of the strong Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35 S-promoter. Several transgenic lines were obtained. Lines 3 and 13 carried a single T-DNA insertion and were thus selected for further characterization. Protein gel blot analysis using a Myc antibody showed that MsK1-Myc protein was present in lines 3 and 13. No signal was obtained in wild-type plants or in plants transformed with the empty vector (Fig. 3A, upper panel). Immunokinase assays using a Myc antibody revealed that MsK1-Myc kinase was active under normal growth conditions in lines 3 and 13 (Fig. 3A, lower panel).FIGURE 3MsK1-Myc protein stability in overexpressor plants. A, detection of MsK1-Myc protein and kinase activity. Western blot analysis with Myc antibody was performed on total protein extracts from MsK1-Myc overexpressing lines 3 and 13, vector control (V) and wild-type (WT) A. thaliana (upper panel). To determine MsK1-Myc kinase activity, immunocomplex kinase assays with a Myc antibody and MBP as substrate were performed with the same protein extracts (lower panel). B, MsK1-Myc kinase activity and protein amount after cellulase treatment. Seven-day-old seedlings of line 3 and wild-type plants were either untreated (lane 1), treated with 0.2% cellulase for 1 h (lane 2), incubated with 100 μm CHX for 2 h (lane 3), or preincubated with CHX for 1 h prior to a 1-h incubation with cellulase (lane 4). MsK1-Myc kinase activity was determined by immunocomplex kinase assays using a Myc anti-body and MBP as a substrate (upper panel). Protein amounts were analyzed by Western blot analysis using a Myc antibody (middle panel). Ponceau staining after Western blotting is shown as a loading control (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To analyze the regulation MsK1 in Arabidopsis, MsK1 protein kinase activity was determined in MsK1 overexpressing plants of line 3 after cellulase treatment. Immunokinase assays with the Myc antibody revealed that MsK1-Myc kinase activity was high in untreated plants and was only marginally reduced by cellulase treatment (Fig. 3B, upper panel). Similarly, MsK1 steady state protein levels remained high in cellulase-treated plants (Fig. 3B, middle panel). In wild-type Medicago plants, MsK1 is rapidly inactivated and degraded when exposed to cellulase (Fig. 1). The constant supply of MsK1-Myc by the strong constitutive 35 S-promoter might mask the regulation of MsK1-Myc in the transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Indeed, when protein synthesis was inhibited by cycloheximide (CHX) prior to application of cellulase, MsK1-Myc activity and protein levels decreased in response to cellulase (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained with transgenic line 13 (data not shown). Wild-type plants showed neither any Myc-kinase activity nor any protein recognized by the Myc antibody in protein gel blot analysis. These data suggest that MsK1 is regulated post-transcriptionally both in Arabidopsis and Medicago.MsK1 Overexpressing Plants Are More Sensitive to Virulent P. syringae—The MsK1-Myc overexpressing plants were indistinguishable from wild-type and vector control plants when grown under standard conditions. Because cellulase can induce defense responses, the sensitivity of MsK1-Myc overexpressing plants to the bacterial pathogen P. syringae pv. tomato (Pst) DC3000 was assessed. Pst is an agriculturally important plant pathogen that is also strongly pathogenic toward A. thaliana. Pst encodes cell wall degrading enzymes implicated in virulence (54Buell C.R. Joardar V.

Samples were taken immediately after infiltration and 1, 2, 3, and 4 days post-infection and colony forming units/cm2 leaf area were calculated for each line (Fig. 4A). 1 h after infiltration (Day 0), similar amounts of bacteria were present in MsK1 overexpressing lines 3 and 13 as in wild-type and vector controls. One day post-infection, slightly more bacteria grew in MsK1 overexpressors than in wild-type and vector control plants. This effect was enhanced on day 2 post-infiltration. On day 3, ∼8-fold more bacteria were present in MsK1 overexpressors as compared with control plants. On day 4, both transgenic and control plants started to show symptoms of disease and bacterial titers decreased. When plants were infected with the avirulent strain, Pst DC3000 AvrRpt2+, no difference was observed in the susceptibility between MsK1 overexpressing and control plants (supplemental Fig. 2).FIGURE 4MsK1-Myc overexpression plants are more susceptible to virulent Pseudomonas syringae.

https://openalex.org/W1993177753,"Propionyl-l-carnitine (PLC) has been introduced among the therapeutic approaches of peripheral arterial disease, and more recently, an increase of intimal cell apoptosis has been demonstrated to contribute to its effectiveness in rabbit carotid postinjury myointimal hyperplasia prevention. How PLC mediates these effects on vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) remains poorly understood. We investigated the role of NF-κB in PLC-induced arterial remodeling. <i>In vivo</i>, daily PLC treatment 15 days after injury resulted in a reduction of relative rat aortic intimal volume, an increase of apoptosis, Bax up-regulation without changing the Bcl-2 level, and a reduction of NF-κB, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and survivin in myointimal thickening compared with controls. In the presence of 10% serum, a reduced G<sub>1</sub> → S phase progression preceded PLC-induced intimal cell apoptosis; in 0.1% serum cultures, in a dose-dependent manner, PLC rapidly induced intimal cell apoptosis and reduced p65, p50, IAP-1, and IAP-2 expression. Inhibiting NF-κB activation through SN50 increased apoptotic rate and Bax expression in intimal but not in medial SMCs, and successive PLC treatment failed to induce a further increase in apoptotic rate. Bax antisense oligodeoxynucleotide reduced PLC-induced intimal cell apoptosis and cytochrome <i>c</i> release. The PLC-induced attenuation of NF-κB activity in intimal cells was also due to the increase of IκB-α bioavailability, as the result of a parallel induction of IκB-α synthesis and reduction of phosphorylation and degradation. Collectively, these findings document that NF-κB activity inhibition contributes to PLC-induced proliferative arrest and Bax-related apoptosis of intimal SMCs."
https://openalex.org/W2010095686,"Acyl carrier protein (ACP), a small protein essential for bacterial growth and pathogenesis, interacts with diverse enzymes during the biosynthesis of fatty acids, phospholipids, and other specialized products such as lipid A. NMR and hydrodynamic studies have previously shown that divalent cations stabilize native helical ACP conformation by binding to conserved acidic residues at two sites (A and B) at either end of the “recognition” helix II. To examine the roles of these amino acids in ACP structure and function, site-directed mutagenesis was used to replace individual site A (Asp-30, Asp-35, Asp-38) and site B (Glu-47, Glu-53, Asp-56) residues in recombinant Vibrio harveyi ACP with the corresponding amides, along with combined mutations at each site (SA, SB) or both sites (SA/SB). Like native V. harveyi ACP, all individual mutants were unfolded at neutral pH but adopted a helical conformation in the presence of millimolar Mg2+ or upon fatty acylation. Mg2+ binding to sites A or B independently stabilized native ACP conformation, whereas mutant SA/SB was folded in the absence of Mg2+, suggesting that charge neutralization is largely responsible for ACP stabilization by divalent cations. Asp-35 in site A was critical for holo-ACP synthase activity, while acyl-ACP synthetase and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine acyltransferase (LpxA) activities were more affected by mutations in site B. Both sites were required for fatty acid synthase activity. Overall, our results indicate that divalent cation binding site mutations have predicted effects on ACP conformation but unpredicted and variable consequences on ACP function with different enzymes.

The requirement for ACP in these diverse processes suggests that interactions between ACP and its partner enzymes must be specific. Information about how individual amino acid residues contribute to ACP conformation and interactions with functionally diverse enzymes will provide insight into the design of novel antimicrobial agents against ACP-dependent targets that are essential for bacterial growth and pathogenesis.

E. coli ACP has an inherently mobile structure that maintains a dynamic equilibrium of at least two conformers, with the loop region and helix II being particularly flexible (20.Kim Y. Prestegard J.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8792-8797Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 21.Andrec M. Hill R.B. Prestegard J.H.

Electrostatic repulsion undoubtedly contributes to conformational flexibility of ACP in this very acidic central region (with 14 acidic and no positive residues between positions 30 and 60); this flexibility in turn is thought to be important in facilitating rapid association and dissociation of ACP with its various partner enzymes. Indeed, computational docking analyses and mutagenic studies with E. coli fatty acid synthase components and other enzymes (22.Zhang Y.M. Rao M.S. Heath R.J. Price A.C. Olson A.J. Rock C.O.

Marrakchi H. White S.W. Rock C.O. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The co-crystal structure of Bacillus subtilis ACP and holo-ACP synthase also supports the importance of helix II of ACP in this regard (26.Parris K.D. Lin L. Tam A. Mathew R. Hixon J. Stahl M.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 537: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) approaches have revealed specific binding of divalent cations to ACP and stabilization of ACP conformation by cation binding. Two divalent cation binding sites exist on E. coli ACP at neutral pH with an average Kd/site of about 80 μm (27.Tener D.M. Mayo K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 189: 559-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and relaxation perturbed two-dimensional NMR studies have identified seven residues involved in these relatively low affinity interactions (31.Frederick A.F. Kay L.E. Prestegard J.H. FEBS Lett. 1988; 238: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Site A (consisting of Glu-30, Asp-35, and Asp-38) resides at the N-terminal end of helix II and site B (Glu-47, Asp-51, Glu-53, and Asp-56) at the other. V. harveyi ACP shares 86% amino acid sequence identity with its E. coli counterpart, and six of the seven putative cation binding residues are identical with Asp replacing Glu at position 30 (Fig. 1). Unlike E. coli ACP, however, V. harveyi ACP is largely unfolded at neutral pH in the absence of millimolar concentrations of Mg2+ or attached acyl chains (32.Flaman A.S. Chen J.M. Van Iderstine S.C. Byers D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35934-35939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The role of acidic helix II residues in maintaining the stability or flexibility of ACP conformation, as well as their contributions to ACP function with specific enzyme partners, remains largely uncharacterized. Moreover, whether divalent cation binding influences ACP function is unknown. In the present study, putative divalent cation-binding residues on recombinant V. harveyi ACP (rACP) were mutagenized (alone or in combination) to corresponding neutral amide forms and the consequences on ACP conformation were examined. Four enzyme systems that employ ACP in different reactions were also investigated to identify ACP regions or residues important for each interaction. Materials−[9,10-3H]Myristic acid (49 Ci/mmol), [3H]uridine diphosphate N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (39.7 Ci/mmol), and [2-14C]malonyl-CoA (51 mCi/mmol) were from NEN/PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [3H]Acetyl-CoA (4.7 Ci/mmol), Factor Xa restriction protease, pGEX-5X-3 vector, glutathione-Sepharose 4B, and SOURCE 15Q anion exchange resin were from Amersham Biosciences (GE Healthcare).

Uniplate Silica Gel G 250 micron TLC plates were from Analtech. All other chemicals were of the highest quality available. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Purification of Mutant V. harveyi ACPs−ACP mutants were constructed on a pGEX-5X-3 vector containing the V. harveyi acpP gene (32.Flaman A.S. Chen J.M.

Plasmids encoding GST-ACP fusion proteins were maintained in E. coli JM109 (Promega) and transformed into E. coli BL21 (Stratagene) for protein expression. All mutant ACPs exhibited roughly comparable levels of expression with rACP, and none were lethal to E. coli cells. ACPs were purified essentially as described (32.Flaman A.S. Chen J.M. Van Iderstine S.C. Byers D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35934-35939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Crude cell extract of E. coli holo-ACP synthase (ACPS) was prepared (33.Lambalot R.H. Walsh C.T. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 279: 254-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and added prior to glutathione-Sepharose chromatography to maximize the conversion of GST-apo-ACPs to the holo form. GST-ACPs were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B and cleaved by Factor Xa to produce a recombinant V. harveyi ACP (rACP) with an N-terminal extension of four amino acids (GIPL). ACPs were further purified to homogeneity on a SOURCE 15Q anion exchange column (Waters 650 Advanced Protein Purification System) and quantified using the Micro BCA protein assay. Apo-ACPs were obtained using the same method from preparations without added exogenous ACPS. Each apo-ACP is less negatively charged than its holo counterpart because of the absence of the 4′-phosphopantetheine prosthetic group, and thus was readily separated from holo-ACP by SOURCE 15Q anion exchange chromatography (AktaFPLC). The identities of selected ACPs were confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Circular Dichroism−Spectra from a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter were recorded at 25 °C using a 0.1 cm water-jacketed cell. Holo-ACPs were diluted to 3–10 μm in 10 mm sodium phosphate, 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 7.0), and spectra were measured from 260 to 190 nm in continuous mode at a scanning speed of 10 nm/min directly or within 1 min after addition of MgCl2, CaCl2, or MnCl2. Native PAGE−ACPs and acyl-ACPs were resolved by conformationally sensitive native gel electrophoresis (34.Rock C.O. Cronan Jr., J.E. Armitage I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2669-2674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on a 20% polyacrylamide gel at room temperature. Protein bands were visualized by staining with GelCode Blue Stain reagent. Holo-ACP Synthase Assay−A modification of the assay described by Lambalot and Walsh (33.Lambalot R.H. Walsh C.T. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 279: 254-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) was performed at 25 or 37 °C in a final volume of 10 μl containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm apo-ACPs, and either partially purified E. coli ACPS from an over-expressing strain (33.Lambalot R.H. Walsh C.T. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 279: 254-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) or purified C-terminally His6-tagged E. coli ACPS. [3H]Acetyl-CoA (57 μm, 440 dpm/pmol) was added to start the reaction and 4 μl was removed at the appropriate time and quenched with 800 μl of cold 10% trichloroacetic acid (w/v) and 20 μl of bovine serum albumin (25 mg/ml). After incubation on ice for 15 min, the precipitate was obtained by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min, washed twice with 800 μl of cold 10% trichloroacetic acid (w/v), and solubilized in 50 μl of formic acid. Product formation was measured by liquid scintillation analysis (Beckman LS6500 Multi-Purpose Scintillation Counter) and corrected for blank values obtained in the absence of added apo-ACP (<2% of control values). Acyl-ACP Synthetase (AAS) Assay−V. harveyi AAS was partially purified by DEAE-Sepharose and Sephacryl S-300 chromatography (35.Fice D. Shen Z. Byers D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1865-1870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the standard assay, holo-ACPs (50 μm) were incubated at 25 or 37 °C for 30 min with AAS (0.5 μgof total protein corresponding to 2 milliunits of activity), 10 mm MgSO4, 10 mm ATP, 0.1 mm [9,10-3H]myristic acid (888 dpm/pmol) in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and 5 mm dithiothreitol (25 μl total volume). Samples (10 μl) were spotted on filter paper, washed three times with methanol/chloroform/acetic acid (6:3: 1), and product formation was measured by liquid scintillation counting (35.Fice D. Shen Z. Byers D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1865-1870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); values were corrected for blanks obtained in the absence of added holo-ACP (<5% of rACP control values). V. harveyi AAS was also used to prepare myristoyl-ACPs for native PAGE analysis and β-hydroxymyristoyl-ACP substrates for LpxA assay, except that unlabeled myristic acid and dl-β-hydroxymyristic acid (Sigma) were used, respectively. Reactions were allowed to proceed up to 24 h at room temperature to maximize conversion to acyl-ACPs. β-Hydroxymyristoyl-ACPs were further purified by application to a Vivapure Q Mini M Spin Column (Vivascience) equilibrated in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. Following elution with 0.2 m NaCl, ACPs were eluted with 0.5 m NaCl and quantified using the Micro BCA protein assay. FAS Assay−V. harveyi FAS was partially purified from V. harveyi cultures as described (36.Gong H. Byers D.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 302: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and separated from endogenous ACP using ammonium sulfate fractionation (between 40 and 75% saturation). The standard assay was performed at 25 or 37°C for 1 h in a final volume of 40 μl containing 10 mm Na+/K+-phosphate, pH 7.0, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm NADPH, 0.5 mm NADH, 10 μm acetyl-CoA, 23 μm [2-14C]malonyl-CoA (48 dpm/pmol), FAS preparation (40 μg of total protein), and 10 μm ACPs. The reaction was stopped with 40 μl of 1 m KOH and incubated at 60 °C for 1 h. After acidification with 40 μlof 2 m HCl, fatty acids were extracted into 1 ml of hexane and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Blank values (minus holo-ACP or NAD(P)H) were <5% of [14C]malonyl-CoA incorporation into acyl-rACP control. LpxA Assay−Assays were performed at 25 °C as previously described (37.Sweet C.R. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19565-19574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Each 10-μl reaction mixture contained 40 mm Na+-HEPES, pH 8.0, 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 μm β-hydroxymyristoyl-ACP, purified His6-tagged LpxA (∼1.2 μm), and 2.5 μm [3H]UDP-GlcNAc (10,000 dpm/pmol). Samples (2 μl) were removed at various times up to 10 min (linear portion of assay) and spotted on a silica gel G TLC plate which was developed in chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (25: 25:2:4). Formation of the acylated product (Rf ∼ 0.6) was quantified using a Bioscan System 200 Imaging Scanner with Win-Scan software and corrected for blank values (<5% of β-hydroxymyristoyl-rACP control of 0.5–1.0 pmol/min/μg enzyme). Fluorescence Assay for ACP-LpxA Interaction−Wild-type and mutant holo-ACPs (0.3 mm) were reduced by incubation with 2.5 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine-HCl for 30 min, followed by reaction with IAEDANS (5 mm final concentration) for 2 h at room temperature. Complete modification of the single phosphopantetheine sulfhydryl group to form AEDANS-ACP was indicated by its decreased mobility on native-PAGE, and the product was purified by SOURCE 15Q anion-exchange chromatography. AEDANS-ACPs (1 μm) in 0.1 m NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 0.1 mm EDTA were titrated sequentially with increasing amounts of LpxA in the same buffer. Fluorescence emission spectra were measured on a PerkinElmer LS50B spectrofluorimeter (10-mm cell) with excitation wavelength of 336 nm and excitation and emission slit widths of 5 and 10 nm, respectively. After correction of fluorescence intensities for dilution (<10% total), the total area under the fluorescence emission curve (400–600 nm) was used to calculate apparent LpxA-ACP dissociation constants using GraphPad Prism software, assuming a 1:1 binding stoichiometry. Preparation and Conformational Analysis of Mutant ACPs−Of the seven acidic residues implicated in divalent cation binding by E. coli ACP (Fig. 1), positions 35, 38, 47, 56, and to a lesser extent positions 30 and 53, are invariant or highly conserved among ACPs from plants and bacteria. Position 51 in site B is the least conserved and tolerates various non-conservative replacements. The conserved residues are likely to not only play a role in cation binding, but may also be important in the interaction of ACP with enzymes. To examine the individual and combined contribution of these acidic residues, site-directed mutagenesis was employed for substitution with the corresponding neutral amino acids. Nine mutants were constructed, i.e. six individual mutants D30N, D35N, D38N, E47Q, E53Q, and D56N, and three global site-elimination mutants SA (D30N/D35N/D38N), SB (E47Q/D51N/E53Q/D56N), and SA/SB. ACPs were expressed in E. coli BL21 cells as GST fusion proteins and purified to homogeneity to eliminate contamination of the mutant proteins with host cell ACP. Circular dichroism (CD) was used to examine the effects of divalent cation binding site mutations on the secondary structure of ACP and dependence of ACP folding on MgCl2 (Fig. 2). This takes advantage of the fact that V. harveyi ACP is largely unfolded at physiological pH and adopts a native-like conformation containing ∼50% α-helix in the presence of millimolar levels of Mg2+ (32.Flaman A.S. Chen J.M. Van Iderstine S.C. Byers D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35934-35939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Addition of 10 mm Mg2+ to holo-rACP increased the magnitude of ellipticity at 220 nm by 2.5-fold and shifted the negative trough at 201–208 nm indicative of increased α-helical content (Fig. 2A); similar Mg2+-dependent conformational transitions were observed for the six individual mutants (data not shown). However, the two site-elimination mutants SA and SB exhibited more residual helical content in the absence of divalent cations, and became folded to a similar extent as rACP upon addition of Mg2+ (Fig. 2A). The effect of Mg2+ on [θ]220 was significantly (p < 0.05) greater for the SA mutant than for SB (Fig. 2B and Table 1), whereas the double site-elimination mutant SA/SB contained substantial helical content even in the absence of Mg2+, with only a modest further effect of Mg2+ on [θ]220 (1.2-fold increase). The midpoint of the Mg2+-induced conformational transition ([θ]220) was comparable for holo forms of SA, SB, and rACP (Table 1), suggesting that sites A and B can bind Mg2+ independently and with similar affinity, and that there is little cooperativity between these sites in divalent cation-induced ACP folding. Similar results were observed with the corresponding apo-ACPs (Fig. 2C), although ∼2-fold higher levels of Mg2+ were required to elicit conformational change (Table 1).TABLE 1CD parameters of ACP titration with Mg2+ACP type[θ]220 ratio (fold increase)aRatio of [θ]220 in buffer containing 10 mm MgCl2 versus 0.1 mm EDTA.Mg2+ transition midpoint (mm)bMgCl2 concentration (mm) at the midpoint of the titration curve.HoloApoHoloAporACP2.47 ± 0.252.96 ± 0.040.49 ± 0.081.15 ± 0.08SA2.20 ± 0.311.77 ± 0.070.78 ± 0.111.33 ± 0.18SB1.64 ± 0.171.68 ± 0.020.54 ± 0.141.23 ± 0.10SA/SB1.21 ± 0.101.15 ± 0.07NDcNot determined.NDa Ratio of [θ]220 in buffer containing 10 mm MgCl2 versus 0.1 mm EDTA.b MgCl2 concentration (mm) at the midpoint of the titration curve.c Not determined. Open table in a new tab Conformational changes of rACP were also monitored in response to Ca2+ and Mn2+ which, like Mg2+ increased α-helical content in the 0.1–1.0 mm range (Fig. 3). However, although all three divalent cations elicited a maximum conformational change at around 5 mm, higher levels of Ca2+ and Mn2+ (but not Mg2+) decreased the secondary structure content of rACP. Results from the CD deconvolution program k2d (38.Andrade M.A. Chacon P. Merelo J.J. Moran F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar) indicated that 50 mm Ca2+ or Mn2+ caused a 40% decrease in α-helical content of rACP, compared with 5 mm Ca2+ or Mn2+. Native PAGE at pH 9.2 is very sensitive to both the intrinsic charge and conformation of ACP, and can readily distinguish apo-, holo-, and fatty acylated forms in which a more compact and thus mobile conformation of this acidic protein is progressively stabilized (34.Rock C.O. Cronan Jr., J.E. Armitage I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2669-2674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression and preparation of V. harveyi rACP and mutant ACPs without treatment with exogenous E. coli holo-ACPS during purification resulted in a mixture of apo- and holo-ACPs in most cases (Fig. 4). Post-lysis incubation with ACPS and coenzyme A increased conversion to holo-ACP, whereas a faster migrating acyl-ACP band was observed upon further incubation with myristic acid and ATP in the presence of V. harveyi AAS. Most apo and holo individual mutants had electrophoretic mobilities that were comparable to the corresponding forms of rACP, with the exception of apo- and holo-D35N, which migrated considerably faster than its rACP counterparts (Fig. 4). In contrast to individual ACP mutants, the three site-elimination mutants SA, SB, and SA/SB exhibited increased mobility relative to their apo- and holo-rACP counterparts. These mutants would be less negatively charged than rACP at pH 9.2, indicating that they have a significantly decreased hydrodynamic radius (i.e. a more compact conformation) under these conditions, consistent with CD results. Upon enzymatic myristoylation, all ACP mutants were able to interact with the covalently attached acyl chain as exhibited by further increased mobility relative to holo-ACPs (Fig. 4). Mutant ACPs as Enzyme Substrates−Closer inspection of Fig. 4 reveals differences in the relative amounts of apo-, holo-, and acyl-forms of various mutant ACPs, suggesting that divalent cation binding site mutations may affect their substrate properties with specific ACP-dependent enzymes. Whereas rACP was typically ∼50% converted to the holo form in vivo by endogenous host cell ACPS, some ACP mutants such as D35N, D56N, SA, and SA/SB appeared mainly as apo-ACPs (Fig. 4). Surprisingly, D38N and E53Q were completely modified to the holo form in vivo, and no apo-ACP was recovered for these mutants. A more quantitative assay measuring holo-ACP formation from [3H]acetyl-CoA confirmed that E. coli ACPS activity at 37 °C is ≥95% impaired with apo-ACP substrates containing individual site A mutations D35N and D56N, as well as mutants SA and SA/SB (Table 2). In contrast, mutants D30N, E47Q, and SB supported partial ACPS activity. The dependence of ACPS activity on the concentrations of rACP and mutant SB was further examined (Fig. 5A). Similar to previous reports (39.Flugel R.S. Hwangbo Y. Lambalot R.H. Cronan Jr., J.E. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 959-968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 40.McAllister K.A. Peery R.B. Zhao G. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 4737-4748Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), ACPS exhibited substrate inhibition at low rACP concentrations, precluding accurate kinetic evaluation, although this was not observed for the SB mutant for which activity was actually greater than for rACP at higher concentrations (up to 50 μm, not shown). These results suggest that combined site B mutations may decrease affinity of ACP for E. coli ACPS, but alleviate substrate inhibition at higher ACP concentrations.TABLE 2Enzyme activities with individual ACPsACP typeHolo-ACP synthaseaActivity of partially purified E. coli ACPS (0.7 μg) was measured using 50 μm apo-ACPs in a 30-min assay.Acyl-ACP synthetaseFatty acid synthasepmol/min/mgpmol/min/μgpmol/min/mgrACP530 ± 604.78 ± 0.4069 ± 12D30N193 ± 311.67 ± 0.2030 ± 3D35N0bActivity at or below blank"

In this report we identify the integrin β4 subunit as a novel caspase substrate using an expression cloning strategy. Together with its α6 partner, α6β4 integrin anchors epithelial cells to the basement membrane at specialized adhesive structures known as hemidesmosomes and plays a critical role in diverse epithelial cell functions including cell survival and migration.

Taken together, we have identified a previously unrecognized proteolytic truncation of integrin β4 generated by caspases that disrupts key structural and functional properties of epithelial cells and promotes apoptosis. Apoptosis is a genetically regulated cellular suicide program activated by diverse signals that results in a series of stereotypical events culminating in cell death. These events include membrane blebbing, nuclear and DNA fragmentation, loss of cell adhesion, dismantling of the cytoskeleton, and packaging the nuclear and cytoplasmic remnants into apoptotic bodies which are engulfed and degraded by adjacent cells. Caspases are highly conserved cell death proteases that execute many of these stereotypical events by cleaving target proteins at aspartic acid residues (1Cryns V. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). For example, caspases trigger the internucleosomal fragmentation of DNA by cleaving ICAD, an inhibitor of the caspase-activated DNase (CAD), thereby releasing ICAD from the inactive ICAD·CAD complex and activating CAD (2Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar, 3Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X.

Caspases also disrupt the actin microfilament network by proteolyzing and activating the actin-severing protein gelsolin and by cleaving actin directly (11Kothakota S. Azuma T. Reinhard C. Klippel A.

Bredesen D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2234-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In addition, caspases proteolyze several components of adherens junctions and desmosomes, intercellular junctions attached to the actin microfilament or cytokeratin intermediate filament networks, respectively, which play a critical role in cell-cell adhesion in epithelial tissues. Indeed, classical (E-cadherin) and desmosomal cadherins (desmoglein-1 and -3 and desmocollin-3), β-catenin, plakoglobin, and desmosomal plaque proteins (plakophilin-1, desmoplakin-1 and -2) are all caspase substrates (13Steinhusen U.

Clearly, adherens junctions and desmosomes and their associated cytoskeletal networks have been extensively targeted for degradation by caspases. The proteolytic disassembly of these structures by caspases likely contributes to the disruption of cell-cell adhesion and the dramatic cytoskeletal reorganization that typifies apoptosis. In an effort to systematically decipher the molecular mechanisms by which caspases induce apoptosis, we have used a small pool expression cloning approach to isolate caspase substrates (9Byun Y.

Integrins are a family of heterodimeric cell surface receptors composed of an α and β subunit that adhere cells to the extracellular matrix (ECM) and transmit signals from the ECM that regulate cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, and migration (21Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3809) Google Scholar). The integrin β4 subunit is distinguished from other integrin subunits by virtue of several unique characteristics. In contrast to the short intracellular domains of other integrins, integrin β4 has a large cytoplasmic tail spanning ∼1000 amino acids that consists of two pairs of fibronectin type III (FNIII) 2The abbreviations used are: FNIII, fibronectin type III; JEB, junctional epidermolysis bullosa; WT, wild type; TRAIL, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, room temperature; zVAD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone. 2The abbreviations used are: FNIII, fibronectin type III; JEB, junctional epidermolysis bullosa; WT, wild type; TRAIL, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, room temperature; zVAD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone. repeats separated by a connecting sequence (22Nievers M.G.

BioEssays. 1998; 20: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Moreover, the integrin β4 subunit and its α6 partner (α6β4 integrin) are receptors for the extracellular matrix protein laminin-5, recently designated laminin-332 by a laminin nomenclature committee (24Aumailley M. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Carter W.G. Deutzmann R. Edgar D. Ekblom P. Engel J. Engvall E. Hohenester E. Jones J.C. Kleinman H.K. Marinkovich M.P. Martin G.R. Mayer U. Meneguzzi G. Miner J.H. Miyazaki K.

Matrix Biol. 2005; 24: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). α6β4 integrin is organized into multiprotein cytoplasmic plaques called hemidesmosomes that anchor cells in the basal layer of epithelial tissues, including skin and the mammary gland, to the basement membrane. Hemidesmosomes are attached to the cytokeratin network, whereas other integrins are attached to actin microfilaments (22Nievers M.G. Schaapveld R.Q. Sonnenberg A. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 23Jones J.C. Hopkinson S.B. Goldfinger L.E. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Additional protein components of hemidesmosomes are BP180 (BPAG2), a type II transmembrane protein, BP230 (BPAG1), and the linker protein plectin. Importantly, the cytoplasmic tail of integrin β4 plays a key role in the localization of α6β4 integrin to hemidesmosomal structures and in the recruitment of other hemidesmosomal proteins to these structures. Specifically, the first and/or second FNIII repeat and a portion of the connecting sequence are required for assembly of α6β4 integrin into hemidesmosomes and plectin binding, whereas the third FNIII repeat and part of the connecting sequence mediate BP180 binding (25Spinardi L.

BP230 interacts with the third and fourth FNIII repeats and the carboxyl terminus of integrin β4 (28Hopkinson S.B. Jones J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The paramount importance of hemidesmosomes in maintaining the structural integrity of certain epithelial tissues is evident from patients with junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) with congenital pyloric atresia, a fatal skin blistering disease characterized by abnormal hemidesmosomes, detachment of epithelial cells from the basement membrane, and mutations in the β4 or α6 subunit genes (29Vidal F.

Indeed, mice with targeted deletion of the entire integrin β4 gene or the cytoplasmic domain lack hemidesmosomes and develop a JEB-like syndrome notable for increased detachment and death of epithelial cells (31Dowling J.

Moreover, deletion of integrin β4 or its carboxyl-terminal tail in keratinocytes results in profound abnormalities in cell migration and cell survival that likely impair wound healing (34Russell A.J. Fincher E.F. Millman L. Smith R. Vela V. Waterman E.A. Dey C.N. Guide S. Weaver V.M. Marinkovich M.P. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3543-3556Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 35Nikolopoulos S.N.

Taken together, these findings point to a critical role for the cytoplasmic tail of integrin β4 in the structural integrity, function, and survival of certain epithelial tissues. In this report we demonstrate for the first time that the integrin β4 subunit is cleaved by caspase-3 and -7 at Asp1109 in vitro and in cells undergoing apoptosis, thereby removing much of its cytoplasmic tail, including all four FNIII repeats. Caspase proteolysis of integrin β4 generates a carboxyl-terminal product that is unstable and rapidly degraded by the proteasome and an amino-terminal cleavage product that is unable to assemble into mature hemidesmosomes. In addition, caspase cleavage of integrin β4 sensitizes epithelial cells to apoptosis and inhibits cell migration. Collectively, our results point to a novel caspase-mediated truncation of integrin β4 that disrupts key structural and functional properties of epithelial cells and promotes apoptosis. Plasmid Constructs—cDNAs encoding wild-type (WT) full-length integrin β4 or its cytoplasmic tail (amino acids 734–1752) were constructed by PCR amplifying the human integrin β4 cDNA using the primer pairs 5′-ccgggaattcATGGCAGGGCCACGCCCCAGCCCA-3′ and 5′-ccggctcgagTCAAGTTTGGAAGAACTGTTGGTCC-3′ (WT) or 5′-ccgggaattcATGGGGAAGTACTGTGCCTGCTGC-3′ and 5′-ccggctcgagTCAAGTTTGGAAGAACTGTTGGTCC-3′ (tail). The PCR products were then digested with EcoRI and XhoI and subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). A D1109E mutant full-length and tail β4 construct in which the putative caspase cleavage site at Asp1109 was replaced with a Glu residue were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using the primers 5′-GACCCAGATGAACTGGAGCGGAGCTTCACGAGTCA-3′ and 5′-TGACTCGTGAAGCTCCGCTCCAGTTCATCTGGGTC-3′. cDNAs encoding carboxyl-terminal GFP-tagged, full-length integrin β4 (WT-β4) or the amino-terminal caspase cleavage fragment composed of amino acids 1–1109 (caspase-truncated β4, designated Tr-β4) were generated by PCR amplification of the wild-type human integrin β4 cDNA using the primers 5′-ggccctcgaggccaccATGGCAGGGCCACGCCCC-3′ and 5′-ggggctcgagAGTTTGGAAGAACTGTTGGTCC-3′ (WT-β4) or 5′-ggccctcgaggccaccATGGCAGGGCCACGCCCC-3′ and 5′-ggggctcgagGTCCAGTTCATCTGGGTCCC-3′ (Tr-β4). The PCR products were digested with XhoI and subcloned into pLEGFP-N1 (BD Biosciences). Each cDNA was verified by DNA sequence analysis.

Caspase Cleavage of Integrin β4 in Vitro—Full-length integrin β4, the WT integrin β4 cytoplasmic tail, or mutant D1109E integrin β4 tail were 35S-labeled with [35S]methionine using the TNT T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation system (Promega). 35S-Labeled full-length integrin β4 was incubated with buffer or 2.5 ng of caspase-3 for 1 h at 37 °C, whereas the 35S-labeled tail proteins were incubated with buffer or 2.5 or 25 ng of caspase-1, -2, -3, -5, -6, -7, -8, or -9 for 1 h at 37 °C; cleavage reactions were analyzed as described previously (19Cryns V.L.

MDA-MB-435 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Immortalized integrin β4-deficient keratinocytes derived from a patient with JEB with pyloric atresia (34Russell A.J. Fincher E.F. Millman L. Smith R. Vela V. Waterman E.A. Dey C.N. Guide S.

JEB keratinocytes were cultured in defined keratinocyteserum-free medium (Invitrogen) and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). For MCF-10A cells, apoptosis was induced by adding 1 μg/ml recombinant tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), which was produced as described previously (39Kamradt M.C.

To verify that the apoptotic cleavage of integrin β4 was mediated by caspases, cells were pretreated for 1 h with vehicle or 50 μm zVAD-fmk, a broad spectrum caspase inhibitor, and then treated with TRAIL or staurosporine. In some experiments cells were pretreated for 1 h with vehicle or 100 nm epoxomicin (Calbiochem), a proteasome inhibitor, and then treated with TRAIL to determine whether the apoptotic cleavage product of integrin β4 was degraded by the proteasome. Apoptosis was induced in MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells by adding 1 μg/ml TRAIL in combination with 1 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma); the latter agent sensitizes these cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Apoptotic nuclei (fragmented or condensed) were scored by staining with 10 μg/ml Hoescht 33258 (Sigma) as described previously (41Kamradt M.C. Chen F. Cryns V.L. J. Biol.

Immunoblotting—Whole cell lysates were prepared from both floating and adherent cells using SDS sample buffer consisting of 8 m urea, 1% SDS in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 15% β-mercaptoethanol. Protein concentration was measured using the NI protein assay (Genotech). Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose and immunoblotted as described previously (36Cryns V.L.

Transfection and Retroviral Transduction—MDA-MB-435 carcinoma cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg of pcDNA3 plasmids containing full-length WT or mutant D1109E integrin β4 using Lipofectamine PLUS reagent (Invitrogen). For retroviral transduction of JEB keratinocytes, 10 μg of pLEGFP-N1 vector (BD Biosciences) or pLEGFP-N1 plasmid containing WT integrin β4 (WT-β4) or caspase-truncated integrin β4 (Tr-β4) were transfected into the Phoenix amphotrophic retrovirus packaging cell line (ATCC), and the retroviral supernatant was prepared as described previously (42Moyano J.V.

Investig. 2006; 116: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). JEB cells were incubated with retrovirus for 48 h, and pools were then generated by selection in 125 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) for 10 days. The expression of proteins in these pools was confirmed by immunoblotting with a GFP antibody. Apoptosis was induced in JEB pools by treatment with 5 μg/ml TRAIL, and apoptosis was scored by nuclear morphology as described under “Cell Culture and Apoptosis Experiments” in this section. Cell Surface Expression of Integrin β4—JEB keratinocytes stably expressing GFP vector or GFP-tagged WT-β4 or Tr-β4 were collected, washed with PBS, and incubated with an integrin β4 extracellular domain antibody (3E1, Chemicon) for 45 min at RT. Cells were then washed, incubated with goat anti-mouse Cy5 secondary antibody for 30 min at RT, washed, and fixed in 0.5% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at RT. Cell surface expression of integrin β4 was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using a DakoCytomation CyAn Flow Cytometer. Microscopy—JEB cells stably expressing integrin β4 constructs were cultured on glass coverslips, washed with PBS, fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at RT, and permeabilized with prechilled 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min. Slides were incubated with primary antibodies against plectin (43Skalli O. Jones J.C. Gagescu R. Goldman R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) (1:50 dilution) or BP180 (44Hopkinson S.B. Riddelle K.S. Jones J.C. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1992; 99: 264-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) (1:50 dilution) for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing, slides were incubated with secondary antibodies, Alexa Fluor 594 F(ab′)2 fragments of either goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgGs (Molecular Probes) (1:200 dilution) for 1 h at 37 °C. Slides were incubated with 0.5 ng/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma) for 15 min at RT and then washed with PBS. Coverslips were mounted with ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Confocal images of planes near the basal cell-substrate surface were obtained with a Zeiss LSM510 UV META confocal microscope. Images were analyzed with Zeiss LSM5 software. For localization and colocalization studies, 100 cells in each of two experiments were scored. Wound Closure Assay—JEB cells stably expressing GFP constructs were sorted by flow cytometry to ensure GFP expression, plated in 6-well plates, and grown overnight. The following day cells were washed with PBS, scraped with a pipette tip, washed again with PBS, and grown in fresh medium (medium was replenished every 24 h). Forty-eight hours later wounds were photographed using a Nikon ECLIPSE TE 2000-U microscope, and wound closure was measured with MetaMorph software (Version 6.1r6, Universal Imaging). For immunoblotting, confluent JEB cells stably expressing GFP-tagged WT-β4 were scraped with a pipette tip in a grid-like pattern (multi-scratch wound assay) to increase the percentage of migrating cells for analysis. Identification of the Integrin β4 Subunit as a Caspase-3 Substrate in Vitro by Small Pool Expression Cloning—We have previously described an expression cloning method to systematically identify cDNAs encoding putative caspase substrates from small pools of a cDNA library (9Byun Y.

In these experiments caspase-3 was added to 35S-labeled protein pools derived from small cDNA pools (48 cDNAs in each pool) of a human prostate adenocarcinoma cDNA library (Invitrogen). Pools with protein bands that were cleaved by caspase-3 were identified. An ∼75-kDa protein (Fig. 1A, indicated by an asterisk) in 35S-labeled pool 59 was proteolyzed by caspase-3 into a fragment of ∼58 kDa (Fig. 1A, indicated by the arrow) in vitro. To identify the caspase-3 substrate corresponding to the ∼75-kDa band in protein pool 59, we divided cDNA pool 59 into progressively smaller pools, 35S-labeled these pools, and incubated them with caspase-3. In this way, a single cDNA (59A5) encoding an ∼75-kDa protein (Fig. 1B, doublet, indicated by an asterisk) was cleaved by caspase-3 into a ∼58-kDa product (Fig. 1B, doublet, indicated by an arrow) in vitro. Sequence analysis of cDNA 59A5 revealed that it encoded amino acids 593–1266 of the integrin β4 subunit (45Hogervorst F. Kuikman I. von dem Borne A.E. Sonnenberg A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 765-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The cDNA contains two ATG codons near the 5′-end, which likely results in the observed doublet of the 35S-labeled protein (Fig. 1B). Importantly, 35S-labeled full-length integrin β4 (Fig. 1C, indicated by the asterisk) was proteolyzed by caspase-3 into products of ∼130 and ∼79 kDa (Fig. 1C, indicated by arrows). Taken together, these results indicate that the integrin β4 subunit is proteolyzed by caspase-3 at a single site in vitro. The Cytoplasmic Tail of the Integrin β4 Subunit Is Cleaved at Asp1109 by Caspases-3 and -7 in Vitro—Because caspases are intracellular proteases that do not have access to the extracellular and transmembrane domains of integrin β4, we examined the sensitivity of the 35S-labeled cytoplasmic tail of integrin β4 (amino acids 734–1752) to a panel of recombinant caspases. Incubation of the 35S-labeled β4 cytoplasmic tail with caspase-3 generated prominent fragments of ∼79 and ∼43 kDa (Fig. 2A, indicated by arrows) and reduced the amount of the intact cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 2A, denoted by an asterisk). Caspase-7, which cleaves substrates at a similar DEXD motif as caspase-3 (46Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S.

A faint band corresponding to the ∼43-kDa product was also observed when the 35S-labeled β4 cytoplasmic tail was incubated with caspase-8. However, caspases-1, -2, -5, -6, and -9 did not proteolyze the β4 cytoplasmic tail. Of note, the observed ∼79-kDa product was similar in size to the fragment produced by caspase-3 cleavage of full-length 35S-labeled β4 (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that the cyto"

From purified components we have determined the effect of TOGp on thermally induced tubulin association in vitro in the presence of 1 mm GTP and 3.4 m glycerol. Physicochemical parameters describing the mechanism of tubulin polymerization were deduced from the kinetic curves by application of the classical theoretical models of tubulin assembly. We have calculated from the polymerization time curves a range of parameters characteristic of nucleation, elongation, or steady state phase. In addition, the tubulin subunits turnover at microtubule ends was deduced from tubulin GTPase activity. For comparison, parallel experiments were conducted with colchicine and taxol, two drugs active on microtubules and with tau, a structural microtubule-associated protein from brain tissue. TOGp, which decreases the nucleus size and the tenth time of the reaction (the time required to produce 10% of the final amount of polymer), shortens the nucleation phase of microtubule assembly. In addition, TOGp favors microtubule formation by increasing the apparent first order rate constant of elongation. Moreover, TOGp increases the total amount of polymer by decreasing the tubulin critical concentration and by inhibiting depolymerization during the steady state of the reaction.

Microtubules are highly dynamic structures that switch between growing and shrinking phases both in vivo and in vitro. These cytoskeleton polymers are necessary for many functions within the cell including intracellular transport, motility, morphogenesis, and cell division. The intrinsic dynamic instability of microtubules is further modified in the cell by numerous protein factors that favor alternatively elongation, shortening, or anchoring of these polymers. Because the mitotic spindle plays a crucial role in cell division, it has been used for decades as an important target in cancer chemotherapy. Many tubulin poisons have been identified, some of them, taxanes and vinca alkaloids, have demonstrated therapeutic value. However, all tubulin poisons are not of clinical utility. This has led to extensive efforts to explore other targets that could affect spindle integrity. A promising approach is to identify the protein regulators that modulate tubulin polymerization and to investigate their mechanism of action. The dynamic instability of microtubules is controlled in vivo by several classes of cellular factors including depolymerizing kinesins (MCAK/XKCM1) (1Hunter A.W. Caplow M. Coy D.L. Hancock W.O.

This last group is composed of structural MAPs (MAP2, tau) that were first identified in brain tissue and of a group of XMAP215-related proteins whose generic member was first characterized in Xenopus eggs (4Gard D.L. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2203-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). TOGp (HUGO gene CKAP5), which is highly expressed in tumors and brain (5Charrasse S. Mazel M. Taviaux S. Berta P. Chow T. Larroque C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 406-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), is the human homolog of XMAP215. TOGp promotes microtubule assembly both in solution and from nucleation centers (6Charrasse S. Schroeder M. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Ango F. Cassimeris L. Gard D.L. Larroque C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1371-1383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was evidenced that this MAP possesses a high affinity for polymer lattice and that it binds protofilaments by its N terminus (7Spittle C. Charrasse S. Larroque C. Cassimeris L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20748-20753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).

In addition to the human TOGp and to the frog XMAP215 protein, members of this group have been independently discovered in Drosophila melanogaster (Msps), in Dictyostelium discoideum (DdCP224), and in Arabidopsis thaliana (Mor1) (10Cullen C.F.

Adachi Y. Kinoshita N. Niwa O. Toda T. Yanagida M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1465-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 15Garcia M.A. Vardy L. Koonrugsa N. Toda T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3389-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), whereas one member, StuII, was characterized in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (16Wang P.J. Huffaker T.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1271-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This evolutionary conserved protein family is implicated in microtubule polymer assembly and spindle formation. Microtubules are hollow cylindrical aggregates of 25-nm diameter composed of heterodimers of α- and β-tubulin. Each of these subunits binds 1 mol of GTP. GTP bound to α-tubulin is not exchanged, whereas β-tubulin-bound GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP soon after tubulin polymerization. A significant amount of the free energy of this hydrolysis goes into the microtubule via a conformational change of the tubulin dimer; its consequence is to destabilize the structure. Microtubules can spontaneously assemble in vitro from a solution of purified tubulin in the presence of GTP by a temperature jump from 0 to 37 °C. The kinetics of tubulin assembly are generally interpreted as a two-step nucleation elongation process. The theoretical interpretation of tubulin polymerization is based on the actin helical aggregation model (17Oosawa F. Kasai M. J. Mol. Biol. 1962; 4: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 18Wegner A. Engel J. Biophys. Chem. 1975; 3: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, the polymerization of microtubules is much more complex than the assembly of actin filaments and necessitates kinetic as well as thermodynamic considerations (19Erickson H.P. Pantaloni D. Biophys. J. 1981; 34: 293-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Its mathematical analysis requires an infinite set of interrelated differential equations (20Hall D. Biophys. Chem. 2003; 104: 655-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the case of actin, some approximations were introduced by Wegner and Engel (18Wegner A. Engel J. Biophys. Chem. 1975; 3: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), leading to simplify the process to two inter-related differential equations, which after integration give a numerical solution of the polymerization curves (21Tobacman L.S. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3207-3214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Houmeida A. Bennes R. Benyamin Y. Roustan C. Biophys. Chem. 1995; 56: 201-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The actin model cannot be directly extrapolated to tubulin. Microtubule elongation is well documented both at the structural and mechanistic levels; in contrast, nucleation is still poorly understood, mainly because it is composed of weakly concentrated transient intermediates (23Caudron N. Arnal I. Buhler E. Job D. Valiron O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50973-50979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Voter and Erickson (24Voter W.A. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10430-10438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) introduced a two-dimensional nucleation mechanism that improves the fitting with the experimental kinetic curves. More recently Flyvbjerg et al. (25Flyvbjerg H. Jobs E. Leibler S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5975-5979Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) formulated a new assembly model in which the final nucleus is the result of a series of intermediate aggregates formed by the step by step addition of a variable number of tubulin monomers. Quantitative parameters describing the mechanism of tubulin assembly can be deduced from the kinetics by application of the theoretical models. It is possible to calculate from the polymerization time curves a range of physicochemical parameters characteristic of nucleation, elongation, or steady state phase. In addition, the tubulin subunit turnover at microtubule ends can be deduced from tubulin GTPase activity. In this paper we have determined the influence of TOGp on these kinetic parameters. The results showed that this MAP was a strong activator of microtubule production, able to influence various steps of the reaction at low concentration. For comparison, parallel experiments were conducted with colchicine and taxol, two microtubule reactive drugs, and with tau, a classical MAP from brain tissue. Tubulin was prepared according to the purification procedure described by Williams and Lee (26Williams Jr., R.C. Lee J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 376-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). TOGp was isolated from pig brain cytosol. Pig brains were obtained from the local slaughterhouse and transported to the laboratory on ice within 2 h after bleeding. Meninges and superficial blood vessels were removed from the brains at 4 °C. Two brains (160 g) were homogenized in 200 ml of PEM buffer (100 mm Pipes/NaOH, pH 6.6, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) for 30 s in a Warring blender mixer. The tissue was further disrupted by means of a Tenbroeck homogenizer with a Teflon pestle (five strokes on ice). The homogenate was centrifuged at 125,000 × g for 75 min at 5 °C, and the supernatant was recovered. This fraction was brought to 32% saturation by adding progressively solid ammonium sulfate at room temperature. The precipitate was recovered by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in 250 ml of a H2O/PEM (v/v) mixture. The solution was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 4 liters of PEM buffer. A small protein precipitate was eliminated after centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 20 min. The protein TOGp was purified from the supernatant in two chromatographic steps. Hydroxyapatite—The column (1.6 × 20 cm) was filled with Macro-Prep ceramic hydroxyapatite from Bio-Rad and equilibrated with PEM buffer. The column was loaded with the cleared supernatant and rinsed with PEM buffer. The proteins were eluted with two successive salt concentration gradients. First the KCl concentration was raised from 0 to 2 m in PEM buffer. Then the PEM buffer was replaced by phosphate buffer (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin), and a second gradient from 10 to 600 mm potassium phosphate was applied to the column. Usually, TOGp eluted with ∼400 mm potassium phosphate. The protein fractions were analyzed by Western blotting, and the chromatographic fractions enriched in TOGp were pooled. DEAE-Sepharose—This chromatography was performed in TEM buffer (Tris/HCl, 20 mm, pH 8.2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) on a 1 × 10 cm column of DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow from Amersham Biosciences. The protein fraction eluted from the hydroxyapatite column was dialyzed against 2 liters of TEM buffer for 5 h and loaded on the column, and unadsorbed proteins were eliminated by rinsing with the TEM buffer. A KCl concentration gradient from 0 to 0.1 m in TEM buffer was then applied. The protein fractions eluted with this gradient were immediately stored at -80 °C. The qualitative composition of each fraction was determined on SDS-PAGE, and Western blots revealed with anti-TOGp antibodies. We applied the purification procedure described by Cleveland et al. (27Cleveland D.W. Hwo S.Y. Kirschner M.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 116: 207-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar) to the 125 000 g pig brain supernatant. Rabbit polyclonal anti-TOGp antibodies were prepared as previously mentioned (6Charrasse S. Schroeder M. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Ango F. Cassimeris L. Gard D.L. Larroque C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1371-1383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal anti-tau (clone tau-2) and mouse monoclonal anti-β-tubulin antibodies (clone Tub 2.1) were from Sigma. Immunogold-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (5- and 15-nm particles) were from British Biocell International (Cardiff, UK). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody and Texas-Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody were from Cappel (MP Biomedicals, Strasbourg, France). Proteins were resolved in denaturing 6% acrylamide gels, in a discontinuous buffer system, as described by Laemmli (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar). Then they were electrotransferred for 1 h at 350 mA on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P from Millipore, Bedford, MA) in Tris/glycine buffer (48 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine, pH 9.2, 1.3 mm SDS and 20% methanol). Protein bands were stained nonspecifically by Amido Black. Membranes were blocked overnight in 6% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4 °C. They were subsequently probed for 2 h with either anti-TOGp, anti-tubulin, or anti-tau antibodies, diluted 1/1000. The blots were rinsed and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody (1/2000) conjugated with peroxidase. Bound antibodies were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent ECL from Amersham Biosciences. The protein extract was resolved in a 6% acrylamide gel under denaturing conditions. After the run, the gel was stained with 0.2% Coomassie Blue R250 dissolved in 2% acetic acid, 50% methanol (high performance liquid chromatography grade). It was destained in 30% methanol. The 160- and 130-kDa polypeptides were both sequenced. They were excised from the gel and hydrolyzed by trypsin according to Rosenfeld et al. (29Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). The resulting digest was fractionated using reverse phase chromatography on C8 then C18 Aquapore (2 × 10 mm) columns from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) and eluted by an acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The eluate was monitored by UV spectroscopy (220 nm). Purified peptides were sequenced on a Procise sequencer from Applied Biosystem using the pulsed liquid program. Proteins resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Selected protein spots were excised from the gel and destained. After reduction and alkylation of disulfide bonds, the dried gel pieces were incubated with trypsin. The resulting peptides were extracted, purified with Millipore Zip-Tip C18 columns, and added to the α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed at the Institut de Gé;nomique Fonctionnelle (CNRS UPR 2580, Montpellier, France) using a Ultraflex apparatus from Bruker Daltonics (Billerica, MA). The peptide masses were matched with the theoretical peptide masses of all proteins in the Swiss-Prot data base using the MASCOT search engine. Tubulin polymerization was monitored turbidimetrically at 350 nm with a MC2 (Safas, Monaco) spectrophotometer equipped with a thermal-jacketed cuvette holder. The cuvette had a 10-mm path length and was 2 mm wide internally. The final volume of the sample was 200 μl. Experiments were run in PEM buffer, 3.4 m glycerol (25% v/v), 1 mm GTP, tubulin amount was varied from 5 to 20 μm, and MAPs or drugs were added in the medium as indicated elsewhere. The reaction mixture was prepared at 0 °C, and the reaction was started by placing the cuvette in the spectrophotometer cell compartment thermostatted at 37 °C. The GTPase activity was detected by using the PiPer phosphate assay kit from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Briefly, inorganic phosphate is combined with maltose to give glucose 1-phosphate and glucose. Then glucose oxidase converts glucose to gluconolactone and H2O2. Finally horseradish peroxidase converts Amplex Red to Resorufin in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Resorufin can be detected by measuring the increase in fluorescence or absorbance of the solution. Tubulin was polymerized at 37 °C in the conditions indicated above, except that the amount of GTP was lowered to 0.1 mm to diminish the deep red coloration of the blank. The medium was divided in ten 50-μl samples that were incubated at 37 °C. At various time intervals the polymerization was stopped by denaturing the proteins for 5 min in boiling water. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was mixed with an equal volume of the kit reagent. The reaction was developed for 3 h at 37°C, and the absorbance was measured at 570 nm. A dilution range was prepared in the same conditions from a50 μm potassium phosphate solution to standardize the assay. Tubulin assembly is usually described as a sequence of bimolecular reactions (for details, see Ref. 20Hall D. Biophys. Chem. 2003; 104: 655-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) in which the polymer is built by successive additions of basal units of α- and β-tubulin dimers; for simplicity, these building blocks are frequently termed monomers. The initial bimolecular reactions are thermodynamically unfavorable (24Voter W.A. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10430-10438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); small aggregates tend to dissociate. Once a certain size, n monomers (commonly named “critical nucleus”), is reached, the addition of the next monomer gives a polymer more stable than its precursor. From this step the elongation takes place by polymerization of subunits onto the microtubule ends. The reaction continues until the elongation process is compensated by the release of monomers at microtubule ends. At that time the polymer is in simple equilibrium with a fixed (critical) concentration of tubulin subunits. As indicated above, we followed the reaction of polymerization at 350 nm. It was shown previously (30Johnson K.A. Borisy G.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 117: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) that there is a quite linear relationship between the turbidity and the total amount of microtubules. In consequence we considered the absorbance at 350 nm (A350 nm) as proportionally related to the mass concentration of tubulin polymer. Information concerning nucleation as well as elongation was drawn from the analysis of the sigmoid kinetics (30Johnson K.A. Borisy G.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 117: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 31Sternlicht H. Ringel I. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10540-10550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two distinct parts can be seen on the curves; from time 0 to the first few minutes there is a lag phase corresponding principally to nucleation, then an exponential decay process takes place corresponding to elongation. Nucleation—This phase may be characterized by various parameters. The determination of the tenth time, t1/10 (the time necessary to produce 10% of the final amount of polymer) is of current use to estimate the lag time duration. Moreover, according to the theoretical models, we find that two parameters can be used to characterize the nucleus size. In this paper we termed these parameters p and q. The former is defined by Flyvbjerg et al. (25Flyvbjerg H. Jobs E. Leibler S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5975-5979Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), on the basis of the “scaling” properties of the polymerization curves obtained with various amounts of tubulin. From the experimental results, these authors noticed that the increase in polymer concentration for the earliest times is proportional to tp. They formulated a theoretical model in which the parameter p was indicative of the number of successive steps in the nucleation process. The value of p can be easily determined by plotting log(A(t)/A∞) against log t. The second parameter, q, originates from the theory of helical aggregation of macromolecules of Oosawa and Kasai (17Oosawa F. Kasai M. J. Mol. Biol. 1962; 4: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). In the case of actin polymerization, it was demonstrated that the half-time of the reaction (t½) was proportional to [M0]q, [M0] being the initial monomer concentration. This relationship is valuable with other characteristic times, t1/20 or t1/10 (24Voter W.A. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10430-10438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Tobacman L.S. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3207-3214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Flyvbjerg H. Jobs E. Leibler S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5975-5979Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Parameter q is obtained from the log-log plot of the tenth time of polymerization versus the total amount of monomer. Tobacman and Korn (21Tobacman L.S. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3207-3214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that it is equal to half of the nucleus size (n/2), whereas according to Voter and Erickson (24Voter W.A. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10430-10438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) it is equal to (n + 1)/2. This apparent discrepancy is due in fact to different definitions of the critical nucleus in the two papers. In the former, the nucleus is defined as the first polymer that is itself more stable than its precursor, whereas in the second paper the nucleus is the least stable intermediate in the reaction. Nevertheless parameter q gives an objective estimation of the number of monomers in the critical nucleus. Elongation—Elongation develops after the lag phase following a procedure that is strongly similar to a first order chemical reaction. According to the pioneering work of Johnson and Borisy (30Johnson K.A. Borisy G.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 117: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) the elongation reaction rate can be interpreted as the sum of the rates of polymerization and depolymerization as indicated in the equation dP/dt = -dM/dt = k+[M][E] - k- [E], where P represents the polymer, [M] is the concentration of free tubulin, [E] is the concentration of assembly competent microtubule ends, k+ is an apparent second order association rate constant corresponding to the sum of the rate constants for monomer addition at the two filament ends, and k- is an apparent first order dissociation rate constant corresponding to the sum of the rate constants for monomer dissociation at the two filament ends. At steady state the reactions of growth and shortening of microtubules are identical. At that time [M] is equal to [M∞], the critical concentration of tubulin. Consequently, k+ [M∞][E] = k-[E], and k- = k+[M∞]. It can be determined that the critical concentration [M∞] is equal to k-/k+ or to 1/K (K is the equilibrium association constant (30Johnson K.A. Borisy G.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 117: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar)). By replacing k- by its value in the differential equation, dP/dt =-dM/dt = k+[E]([M] - [M∞]). It can be assumed that [E] is constant during the elongation phase, the expression reduces to a pseudo-first order rate expression, the product k+ [E] can be replaced by a constant termed k, and the factor ([M] - [M∞]) represents the concentration of active tubulin named [Ma]. After integration, ln[Ma]/[Ma0] = -kt. The ratio [Ma]/[Ma0] is easily accessible from the measures of the absorbance at 350 nm. It is equal to (A∞ - At)/A∞), where At represents the absorbance at a given time, and A∞ is the absorbance maximum obtained at the plateau of the kinetic curve. By plotting ln(1 - At/A∞) as a function of time, the pseudo-first order rate constant of elongation, kobs, can be determined. Microtubules were prepared in a spectrophotometer cuvette (200 μl final volume) at 37 °C as indicated above in the microtubule assembly assays. Polymers prepared with native 200-kDa TOGp and control polymers with tubulin alone were incubated simultaneously. First Method—Microtubules were centrifuged at 36,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of PEM buffer, 25% glycerol, 0.1 mm GTP. Anti-TOGp antibodies (5 μl) were added, and the mixture was incubated for 3 h at 30°C. The antibodies were eliminated by centrifugation at 36,000 × g for 30 min at 35 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of PEM/glycerol/GTP buffer and mixed with 5 μl of immunogold-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (5- and 15-nm gold-labeled antibodies were used alternatively). The incubation lasted 2 h at 30°C. The secondary antibody was eliminated by centrifugation at 30 °C, and the microtubules were suspended in 200 μl of fresh buffer and placed at 30 °C. Second Method—After tubulin aggregation at 37 °C, 4 μlof anti-TOGp antibodies were added to the solution, and the incubation was continued for 3 h at 30°C. The secondary antibody (15 μl) was then included, and the incubation was prolonged for 2 h. The polymers were separated from tubulin and antibodies by centrifugation in a 2-ml sucrose gradient (37–60%) for 1 h at 180,000 × g in a swinging rotor thermostatted at 30 °C. Microtubules were present in the first 0.1-ml fraction at the bottom of the gradient. Microtubules were diluted in PEM/glycerol/GTP buffer to a protein concentration of 0.2 mg/ml, deposited onto Formvar-carbon coated grids, and negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate. Grids were examined using a Jeol 1200 EX electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. Primary cultures of hypothalamus cells were prepared by mechanoenzymatic dissociation of fetal (day 17) rat hypothalamus. Cells (106) were plated in 16-mm diameter culture dishes containing a 10-mm glass coverslip previously coated with poly-d-lysine (32Rage F. Benyassi A. Arancibia S. Tapia-Arancibia L. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 1056-1062PubMed Google Scholar). Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere in minimum Eagle’s medium containing 10% Nu serum, 0.6% glucose, 2 mm glutamine, 2.5 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin adjusted to pH 7.3. Two days after seeding, the cells on the coverslip were fixed for 10 min in cold methanol (-20 °C) and gradually rehydrated with PBS. Cells were then incubated for 60 min with a mixture of anti-TOGp rabbit antiserum (1/200) and anti-tubulin monoclonal antibody (1/200) in PBS containing 1 mg/ml albumin. After washing in PBS, incubation was carried out in the same solution containing both fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies and Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies. Stained cells were mounted in 0.25% Airvol 205 in PBS, and images were recorded using a 63× NA objective on a Leica inverted microscope.

Cdh1 is a co-activator of the APC aiding in the onset and maintenance of G1 phase, whereas phosphorylation of Cdh1 at the end of G1 phase by cyclin-dependent kinases assists in the inactivation of APCCdh1. Here, we suggest additional components are involved in the inactivation of APCCdh1 independent of Cdh1 phosphorylation. We have identified proteins known as Acm1 and Bmh1, which bind and form a ternary complex with Cdh1. The presence of phosphorylated Acm1 is critical for the ternary complex formation, and Acm1 is predominantly expressed in S phase when APCCdh1 is inactive. The assembly of the ternary complex inhibits ubiquitination of Clb2 in vitro by blocking the interaction of Cdh1 with Clb2. In vivo, lethality caused by overexpression of constitutively active Cdh1 is rescued by overexpression of Acm1. Partially phosphorylated Cdh1 in the absence of ACM1 still binds to and activates the APC. However, the addition of Acm1 decreases Clb2 ubiquitination when using either phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated Cdh1.

Substrate specificity of the APC is attributed to co-activator proteins that associate with particular substrates throughout the cell cycle (5Kramer E.R. Gieffers C. Holzl G. Hengstschlager M.

The co-activators Cdc20 and Cdh1 are thought to aid in the recruitment of particular substrates through substrate binding independent of the APC or in assemblies known as APCCdc20 or APCCdh1 (8Eytan E.

Co-activators interact with the APC at specific times during the cell cycle, with Cdc20 activating the APC from early to late M phase and Cdh1 activating the APC from late M phase through G1 (5Kramer E.R.

Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Cdh1 has been demonstrated as an important control mechanism for the APCCdh1 complex (16Zachariae W. Schwab M. Nasmyth K. Seufert W. Science. 1998; 282: 1721-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Cdh1 is cell cycle-dependent and is considered to be the main regulatory mechanism by which APCCdh1 is inactivated. Cdh1 is phosphorylated in S phase, G2, and mitosis and dephosphorylated in G1 (16Zachariae W. Schwab M. Nasmyth K. Seufert W. Science. 1998; 282: 1721-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of Cdh1 corresponds to high levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity. When the CDK consensus phosphorylation sites within Cdh1 from budding yeast were mutated to alanine, Cdh1 activated the APC constitutively, failing to accumulate mitotic cyclins (16Zachariae W. Schwab M. Nasmyth K. Seufert W. Science. 1998; 282: 1721-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Cdh1 is phosphorylated at the G1/S phase transition by G1 and S phase cyclins that activate the CDK in budding yeast, Cdc28. Cdh1 remains hyperphosphorylated until late in mitosis when Cdc14 phosphatase is activated allowing Cdh1 to reactivate the APC (15Huang J.N. Park I. Ellingson E. Littlepage L.E. Pellman D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 17Prinz S. Hwang E.S. Visintin R. Amon A. Curr.

Schwab M. Nasmyth K. Seufert W. Science. 1998; 282: 1721-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Additionally, in vitro phosphorylation of recombinant Cdh1 by CDKs is sufficient for inactivation of the APC (18Jaspersen S.L. Charles J.F. Morgan D.O. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 227-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Protein-protein interactions have also been shown to be important in the regulation of Cdh1 (19Reimann J.D. Gardner B.E. Margottin-Goguet F. Jackson P.K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3278-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 20Chen J. Fang G. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1765-1770Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotes, Emi1 and Mad2B have been shown to inhibit Cdh1 through protein-protein interactions (19Reimann J.D.

However, similar inhibitors in yeast have not yet been identified. To discover potentially novel Cdh1 interacting proteins, we performed a proteomic screen of Cdh1 immunoprecipitations in budding yeast. In the process, we identified a multiprotein complex that forms with Cdh1, consisting of a previously uncharacterized protein Acm1 (YPL267W) and two members of the 14-3-3 protein family known as Bmh1 and Bmh2. The expression of Acm1 is cell cycle-dependent, and Acm1 is necessary for complex formation with Cdh1 and Bmh1. Formation of the complex, which we refer to as the CAB complex or Cdh1/Acm1/Bmh1 complex, is restricted to the cell cycle window in which Acm1 is expressed. Without Acm1, Clb2 levels in vivo appear lower when compared with cells containing Acm1 under certain growth conditions. Complex formation inhibits APCCdh1 activity in vitro, and lethality caused by overexpression of constitutively active Cdh1 is rescued by Acm1 overexpression. The CAB complex functions to block substrate binding with the co-activator. Partially phosphorylated Cdh1 binds and activates the APC in the absence of Acm1. Lastly, we have shown the ability of Acm1 and Bmh1 to inhibit APCCdh1 despite the Cdh1 phosphorylation state. Taken together, our data suggest the existence of an additional inactivation mechanism of APCCdh1 independent of Cdh1 phosphorylation. Cloning—Cloning for p415ADH-FLAGCdh1 and pNC219-FLAGCdh1m9 have been described previously (21Hall M.C. Warren E.N. Borchers C.H. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 1278-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The resulting centromeric plasmid, p415ADH-FLAGCdh1, constitutively expresses 3×FLAG-CDH1 from the ADH promoter. pNC219-FLAGCdh1m9 expresses the 3×FLAG-CDH1 phosphomutant with 9 of 11 CDK sites mutated to alanine from the GAL promoter. The plasmids pHLP117 expressing 3HA-Acm1 from its natural promoter, pHLP107 expressing FLAG-Acm1 from the ADH promoter, and pHLP106 expressing FLAG-Acm1 from the GAL1 promoter were gifts from M. Hall. The plasmids pRSETClb2, pET28-His6-Cdh1, and pET28-His6-Ubc4 were gifts from D. Barford (22Passmore L.A. McCormack E.A. Au S.W. Paul A. Willison K.R. Harper J.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 786-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). BMH1 and CLB2 were amplified by PCR from yeast genomic DNA and cloned into pGEX-4T-1 at the BamH1 and XhoI sites yielding a GST tag on the N terminus of Bmh1 and Clb2 for overexpression in Escherichia coli. All PCR-generated constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Strains and Media—Yeast strains are described in Table 1. Media were YPD (20 g/liter peptone (Fisher), 10 g/liter yeast extract (Bacto), 20 g/liter dextrose (MP Biomedicals)), YP (20 g/liter peptone, 10 g/liter yeast extract) and synthetic medium (6.7 g/liter yeast nitrogen base lacking amino acids (Difco), 20 g/liter dextrose, or 20 g/liter raffinose, appropriate amino acid dropout mix (Q-Biogene)).TABLE 1S. cerevisiae strains used in this studyStrainRelevant genotypeSourceW1588-4cMATa ade2-1 can1-100 His3-11 15 leu2-3 112 trp1-1 ura3-1R.

BAR1 cells require 3 μg/ml α-factor peptide for an effective G1 arrest. Arresting in S phase requires the addition of 10 mg/ml hydroxyurea (Sigma). M phase arrests are carried out by the addition of 15 mg/ml nocodazole (Sigma). This laboratory has acquired a cdc15-2 yeast strain that allows cell cycle arrest in telophase induced by temperature shift from 25 °C to 37 °C. Cell cycle arrests are monitored by phase-contrast microscopy until >90% of the cells have achieved the desired morphology. Cdh1 Purification—Yeast cells were grown asynchronously to A600 = 1 and lysed in 1 volume of APC-C lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 400 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) by vortexing for 45 min at 4 °C in 1.7-ml microcentrifuge tubes containing 0.5 ml of 0.5-mm glass beads. Cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min. Soluble extracts were pooled and cleared a second time at 5000 rpm for 5 min. Extracts were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody-coupled resin (Sigma) for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Bound Cdh1 was washed extensively with APC-C buffer (25 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 400 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and eluted 2× with FLAG peptide (250 μg/ml) in APC-C buffer. APC Purification—Yeast cells were grown and lysed, and lysates were cleared in the same manner as for Cdh1. Extracts from YNL172W-TAP were incubated with calmodulin affinity resin (Stratagene) for 1.5 h at 4 °C in APC-C buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2. Cells from YKA156 (2 liters) were grown to A600 = 0.5 at 25 °C, and temperature was shifted to 37 °C for 2 h. Extracts from YKA156 were incubated with EZView anti-FLAG M2 antibody-coupled resin (Sigma) for 1.5 h at 4 °C, washed extensively with APC-C buffer, and eluted 2× with FLAG peptide (250 μg/ml) in low salt APC-C buffer (25 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol). Acm1 Purification—Yeast cells were grown and lysed, and lysates were cleared in the same manner as for Cdh1 purifications. Extracts from YPL267W-TAP were incubated with calmodulin affinity resin (Stratagene) for 1.5 h at 4 °C in APC-C buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2. Acm1 bound to beads was used in binding assays. Acm1 used in the ubiquitination assay and Clb2 binding assay was eluted with TAP elution buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.6 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm EDTA) for 30 min at room temperature while shaking at 700 rpm. MgCl2 was added to the elution buffer at a final concentration of 15 mm. FLAG-Acm1 used in the ubiquitination assay and binding assays was purified in the same manner as APC. Bmh1/Clb2 Purification—Overnight cultures of E. coli harboring BMH1 or CLB2 in the pGEX-4T-1 plasmid were grown and used to inoculate 1 liter of 2XYT (16 g/liter Tryptone, 10 g/liter yeast extract, 5 g/liter NaCl) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Cultures were grown for 8 h at 37°C, temperature was shifted to 23 °C, and isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added (100 μm final contration). Cells were grown overnight and harvested by centrifugation. The resulting cell pellet was resuspended in 1× phosphate-buffered saline 0.5 m NaCl keeping suspension on ice. Cells were lysed 3× using sonication for 20-s intervals with a 40-s pause. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 4 °C and 25,000 rpm for 30 min. Cleared lysates were incubated with 100 μl of washed GSH beads (glutathione-Sepharose 4B, Amersham Biosciences) for 10 min. Beads and lysate were pipetted and transferred to Bio-Rad micro columns. Beads were washed with 5 column volumes of 1× phosphate-buffered saline 0.5 m NaCl. Bound protein was used on the GSH beads for binding assays. Bmh1 used in the ubiquitination assay was treated with biotinylated thrombin (Novagen) to cleave the GST tag. The sample was treated with streptavidin-agarose to remove thrombin. Buffer was exchanged with 40 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.6 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2 using Microcon filters with a 10-kDa cutoff (Millipore). In Vitro Binding Assays—Compact reaction columns (USB) were used for all binding assays. Protein used as bait was immobilized on affinity beads and washed in the reaction column. Protein used as prey was added to each column and allowed to incubate for times noted at 4 °C under rotation. Columns were washed with five column volumes of APC-C lysis buffer and eluted in 1× NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) unless the immobilized protein used the TAP tag. In TAP purifications, APC-C buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2 was used for washes. Five percent of each reaction was loaded on the gel. Ubiquitination Assay—Ubiquitination assays were carried out as described by D. Barford (22Passmore L.A. McCormack E.A. Au S.W. Paul A. Willison K.R. Harper J.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 786-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The substrate Clb2 (pRSETClb2), the co-activator Cdh1 (pET28-His6-Cdh1), and the E2 Ubc4 (pET28-His6-Ubc4) were prepared using the TnT T7 Quick-coupled in vitro transcription/translation kit (Promega) unless otherwise noted. APC (YKA156) and Acm1 were purified from budding yeast (see APC and Acm1 purification), whereas Bmh1 was expressed and purified from E. coli (see Bmh1 purification). APC used in each reaction was 1/50th of the elution from 2 liter of cells. Clb2 was radiolabeled with [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Reactions were run on a 4–12% Bis-Tris NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen), dried, and imaged using Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences). Flow Cytometry—Cells were prepared as described previously (23Hall M.C. Torres M.P. Schroeder G.K. Borchers C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16698-16705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). DNA content was measured on a FACScan instrument and ModFit LT software (Verity Software House, Inc.) used to calculate percentages of G1, S, and G2/M cells present. Protein Identification and Mass Spectrometry—Elutions from Cdh1 purifications were acetone-precipitated, reconstituted in 1× LDS sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol, and separated on a 4–12% Bis-Tris NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen). Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue or silver. Protein bands were excised, destained, and incubated with trypsin. After digestion, samples were frozen, lyophilized, and resuspended in a small volume of 50% methanol/0.1% formic acid. Peptide masses were analyzed on a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems), and proteins were identified using the MASCOT search engine (Matrix Science). Samples that needed further analysis were analyzed on a nano-ESI Q-TOF (Micromass) mass spectrometer (47Parker C.E. Warren M.R. Loiselle D.R. Dicheva N.N. Scarlett C.O. Borchers C.H. Methods Mol. Biol. 2005; 301: 117-151PubMed Google Scholar). Gel Filtration—FLAG immunoprecipitations were prepared from S phase-arrested cells in APC-C buffer. The samples were fractionated on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 gel-filtration column with extraction buffer on an AKTA Explorer system (Amersham Biosciences) at 0.4 ml/min. Fractions were collected in 0.5-ml increments, and each fraction was acetone-precipitated. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting with an α-FLAG antibody. Acm1 and Bmh1 Associate with Cdh1 in Vivo and in Vitro and Form a Ternary Complex—To identify potential interacting proteins of Cdh1, we used a targeted proteomic approach consisting of immunoprecipitations with genomically FLAG-tagged Cdh1 followed by mass spectrometric analysis. We discovered three proteins known as Acm1, Bmh1, and Bmh2 in budding yeast, which stably interact with Cdh1 under high salt wash conditions (Fig. 1A). The untagged parent strain was used as a control. C-terminal Cdh1 fragments were also identified by mass spectrometry. Interestingly, we did not identify any other specific proteins in the Cdh1 immunoprecipitation presumably due to the high salt wash conditions, which disrupt all but the most stable protein complexes. Gel-filtration analysis of the complex showed co-elution of Cdh1 and Acm1 in a stoichiometric interaction (data not shown). Acm1 (APCCdh1 modulator 1) is a previously uncharacterized protein with no known function, although it was originally identified as a potential CDK substrate (24Ubersax J.A. Woodbury E.L. Quang P.N. Paraz M. Blethrow J.D. Shah K. Shokat K.M. Morgan D.O. Nature. 2003; 425: 859-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). However, as members of the 14-3-3 family of proteins, Bmh1 and Bmh2 have been associated with a variety of cellular processes and have been defined as phosphoserine-binding proteins (25Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar, 26Muslin A.J. Xing H. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). We believe two possibilities for these interactions exist, either as potential APCCdh1 substrates or as regulators of Cdh1. To confirm the specificity of the interactions between Cdh1, Acm1, and Bmh1, we used in vitro binding assays. FLAG-tagged Cdh1 and TAP-tagged Acm1 were purified from yeast while recombinant Bmh1 was expressed in E. coli. GST-Bmh1 was immobilized on GSH beads and incubated with Cdh1-FLAG. GST bound to GSH beads was used as a control. Acm1-TAP was immobilized on calmodulin beads and incubated with Cdh1-FLAG. Empty calmodulin beads served as a control. Like-wise, Acm1-TAP was incubated with GST-Bmh1. We observed stable interactions between Bmh1 and Cdh1, Acm1 and Cdh1, and Acm1 and Bmh1 under high salt wash conditions (Fig. 1B). To see if any one component of the CAB complex was necessary for complex formation, we performed immunoprecipitations from strains deleted for components of the complex. We expressed N-terminally FLAG-tagged Cdh1 in WT, acm1Δ, bmh1Δ, and bmh2Δ strains and immunopurified it with anti-FLAG antibody followed by gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometric analysis. Gel slices for each region where Cdh1, Acm1, Bmh1, and Bmh2 migrate were analyzed. Bmh1 and Bmh2 cannot be detected in the absence of Acm1. In the bmh1Δ strain, Acm1 and Bmh2 still associated with Cdh1. Likewise, Acm1 and Bmh1 still associated with Cdh1 in the bmh2Δ strain (Fig. 1C). Additionally, we incubated purified FLAG-Cdh1 from either wild-type or acm1Δ cells with immobilized GST-Bmh1 in an in vitro binding assay. Without Acm1, Cdh1 does not bind Bmh1 (Fig. 1D, lane 6). The Bmh1/Cdh1 binding in Fig. 1B is attributed to the presence of Acm1, which co-purifies with Cdh1. Together these findings illustrate the dependence of the CAB complex formation on Acm1 as well as a possible redundancy between Bmh1 and Bmh2. Acm1 Is Expressed in S Phase and Has an Effect on Cell Cycle Progression—Because Cdh1 activates the APC in a cell cycle-dependent manner, the interaction with Acm1 and the 14-3-3 proteins could also fluctuate throughout the cell cycle. To determine whether these proteins were regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner, Acm1-TAP and Bmh1-TAP protein levels were analyzed in cell lysates from G1, S, and M phase-arrested cells. Acm1 levels were found to be significantly higher in S phase over the other cell cycle phases, whereas Bmh1 levels remain constant in each cell cycle stage (Fig. 2A). This finding is in agreement with the Acm1 mRNA expression pattern throughout the cell cycle (27Spellman P.T. Sherlock G. Zhang M.Q. Iyer V.R. Anders K. Eisen M.B. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Futcher B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3273-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (3899) Google Scholar). Analysis of Acm1 mRNA expression levels from the Saccharomyces Genome Database revealed the closest pattern of gene expression to Acm1 is observed for Clb5 (27Spellman P.T. Sherlock G. Zhang M.Q. Iyer V.R. Anders K. Eisen M.B. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Futcher B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3273-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (3899) Google Scholar). Clb5-Cdc28 is believed to be the primary cyclin-CDK complex responsible for phosphorylation of Cdh1 during S phase, although other G1 cyclin-CDK complexes are also involved (15Huang J.N. Park I. Ellingson E. Littlepage L.E. Pellman D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 28Amon A. Irniger S. Nasmyth K.

Biol. 2001; 21: 5071-5081Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Acm1 protein levels are highest in S phase when Cdh1 is phosphorylated and APCCdh1 becomes inactivated. This observation suggested an involvement of Acm1 in phosphorylation-mediated regulation of APCCdh1 during S phase. We did not expect the deletion of ACM1 to induce large perturbations in the cell cycle. According to the Saccharomyces Genome Database, cells with ACM1 systematically deleted were viable (30Giaever G. Chu A.M. Ni L. Connelly C. Riles L. Veronneau S. Dow S. Lucau-Danila A. Anderson K.

Indeed, acm1Δ cells grow at normal rate when compared with WT cells. To see if deleting ACM1 had any effect within a single cell cycle, cells from acm1Δ and wild-type strains were synchronized in S phase with hydroxyurea, released, and analyzed by flow cytometry for DNA content in 20-min intervals (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, FACS analysis of acm1Δ cells showed an increase (14%) in the S phase cell population in comparison to wild-type cells at 80 min after release. This effect was reproducible but to slightly varying degrees (data not shown). Additionally, the acm1Δ strain resynchronized with WT cells in M phase. The effect in S phase progression in acm1Δ cells suggests Acm1 may play a role in cell cycle progression throughout S phase. If the CAB complex does play a role in APCCdh1 regulation, one would expect a difference in APCCdh1 substrate levels in cells lacking Acm1. To test whether APCCdh1 substrates are affected in acm1Δ cells, we performed a G1 block-release experiment in cells containing Acm1 compared with cells void of Acm1 and examined levels of the known APCCdh1 substrate Clb2. Interestingly, we found a slight decrease in Clb2 levels in early time points in the absence of Acm1 under certain growth conditions (Fig. 2C). The cycling pattern of Clb2 corresponds to that of Acm1, although Acm1 increases to its maximum slightly before Clb2 reaches its highest level. An increased level of APCCdh1 activity in the strain lacking Acm1 could explain this difference in Clb2 levels between the two strains. However, the effects in the cell cycle are slight, so CAB complex formation may exist as an overlapping inhibitory mechanism in addition to phosphorylation for APCCdh1. CAB Complex Formation Inhibits APCCdh1-mediated Ubiquitination of Clb2—Because Acm1 was predominantly expressed in S phase when APCCdh1 activity is inhibited and cells lacking Acm1 exhibited a difference in Clb2 levels, we investigated whether the CAB complex formation affected APCCdh1 activity directly. To demonstrate a possible inhibitory effect of Acm1 and Bmh1 on APC activity, an in vitro ubiquitination assay was used to measure ubiquitination of the substrate Clb2 (Fig. 3A). APC and TAP-tagged Acm1 were purified from yeast while Ubc4 (E2), Cdh1, and S35-labeled Clb2 were expressed in vitro and incubated together for the assay. The degree of substrate ubiquitination was measured by phosphorimaging analysis of S35-labeled Clb2. With Bmh1 levels held constant, increasing concentrations of Acm1-TAP resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of Clb2 ubiquitination (lanes 3–5). A mock purification from acm1Δ cells was used to rule ou"
https://openalex.org/W1975730136,"Fnr is a regulator that controls the expression of a variety of genes in response to oxygen limitation in bacteria. To assess the role of Fnr in photosynthesis in Rubrivivax gelatinosus, a strain carrying a null mutation in fnrL was constructed. It was unable to grow anaerobically in the light, but, intriguingly, it was able to produce photosynthetic complexes under high oxygenation conditions. The mutant lacked all c-type cytochromes normally detectable in microaerobically-grown wild type cells and accumulated coproporphyrin III. These data suggested that the pleiotropic phenotype observed in FNR is primarily due to the control at the level of the HemN oxygen-independent coproporphyrinogen III dehydrogenase. hemN expression in trans partially suppressed the FNR phenotype, as it rescued heme and cytochrome syntheses. Nevertheless, these cells were photosynthetically deficient, and pigment analyses showed that they were blocked at the level of Mg2+-protoporphyrin monomethyl ester. Expression of both hemN and bchE in the FNR mutant restored synthesis of Mg2+-protochlorophyllide. We, therefore, conclude that FnrL controls respiration by regulating hemN expression and controls photosynthesis by regulating both hemN and bchE expression. A comprehensive picture of the control points of microaerobic respiration and photosynthesis by FnrL is provided, and the prominent role of this factor in activating alternative gene programs after reduction of oxygen tension in facultative aerobes is discussed.

Anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria can develop the required machinery for growth under aerobic respiration, anaerobic respiration, or photosynthesis under anaerobiosis and light. This faculty requires tight control to ensure production of the required complexes and rapid adaptation to changes in environmental conditions. Under anaerobiosis and light, purple bacteria perform anoxygenic photosynthesis on the basis of a bacteriochlorophyll-mediated process. It takes place within the membrane-bound photosynthetic apparatus composed of pigment-protein complexes (reaction center (RC) 2The abbreviations used are: RC, reaction center; LH, light harvesting; kb, kilobase; MgPMe, Mg2+-protoporphyrin monomethyl ester; kb, kilobase; WT, wild type. and light harvesting (LH)) and involves membrane cytochromes. Synthesis of tetrapyrroles (heme and chlorophyll) is then a crucial process necessary for photosynthesis and respiratory growth of these organisms. Heme synthesis and its regulation have been studied in many organisms (for review, see Refs. 1Schobert M. Jahn D. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 4: 287-294PubMed Google Scholar, 2Panek H.

A key step in this pathway corresponds to the conversion of coproporphyrinogen III to protoporphyrinogen IX. In facultative aerobic prokaryotes, two structurally different enzymes catalyze this reaction depending on the oxygenation level. Under high oxygenation, the oxidation is catalyzed in Escherichia coli by the oxygen-dependent coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (HemF). Under anaerobiosis, an oxygen-independent coproporphyrinogen III dehydrogenase (HemN) is required (5Troup B. Jahn M. Hungerer C. Jahn D. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 673-680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Troup B. Hungerer C. Jahn D. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3326-3331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Genet. 1997; 31: 61-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). A key step in the chlorophyll pathway in facultative aerobes corresponds to the cyclization of Mg2+-protoporphyrin monomethyl ester (MgPMe). Two structurally unrelated enzymes catalyze this reaction depending again on the oxygen tension. Under high oxygen the oxidation is catalyzed by the oxygen-dependent MgPMe oxidase (AcsF). Under anaerobiosis, an oxygen-independent MgPMe dehydrogenase (BchE) is required (8Porra R.J. Urzinger M. Winkler J. Bubenzer C. Scheer H. Eur. J.

In purple bacteria the photosynthesis genes are expressed preferentially under anaerobic photosynthesis conditions. Gene induction was mainly studied in Rhodobacter capsulatus and Rhodobacter sphaeroides species, and it involves many transcriptional regulators (11Zeilstra-Ryalls J.H. Gomelsky M. Yeliseev A.A.

Among these factors, Fnr was shown to regulate both photosynthesis and respiratory genes (14Zeilstra-Ryalls J.H. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6422-6431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Zeilstra-Ryalls J.H. Gabbert K. Mouncey N.J. Kaplan S. Kranz R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7264-7273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In E. coli the global transcriptional regulator Fnr monitors the availability of oxygen in the medium through its sensory domain composed of a labile [4Fe-4S] (16Lazazzera B.A. Beinert H. Khoroshilova N. Kennedy M.C. Kiley P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2762-2768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). It binds to its target sequence TTGAN6TCAA (N is any nucleoside) as a homodimer. The sensing mechanism implies the transformation of the [4Fe-4S] cluster to a [2Fe-2S] in the presence of oxygen, preventing the dimerization process (17Moore L.J. Kiley P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45744-45750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 18Kiley P.J. Beinert H. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 22: 341-352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This study focuses on the Rubrivivax gelatinosus global anaerobic regulator Fnr and the requirement of this factor for photosynthetic and microaerobic growth. We have previously detailed the AcsF/BchE enzyme replacement and suggested a similar HemF to HemN replacement during the shift from an aerobic to an anaerobic environment (10Ouchane S. Steunou A.S. Picaud M. Astier C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6385-6394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Other examples of such enzyme replacement have been reported (19Raymond J. Blankenship R. Geobiology. 2004; 2: 199-203Crossref Google Scholar). This work further investigates the key targets of FnrL in the tetrapyrrole pathway and elucidates how enzyme replacement during a shift from aerobic to anaerobic growth is affected by FnrL. Bacterial Strains and Growth Media—E. coli was grown at 37 °C on LB medium. R. gelatinosus Strain 1 (20Uffen R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3298-3302Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and the mutants were grown at 30 °C aerobically in the dark (high oxygenation, 250-ml flasks containing 20 ml of medium, or moderate oxygenation, 100-ml flasks containing 50 ml of medium) or microaerobically (low oxygenation, 50-ml flasks filled with 50 ml of medium) or anaerobically in the light (photosynthesis) in malate growth medium. Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations for E. coli and R. gelatinosus:50 μg/ml kanamycin, 50 μg/ml ampicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 μg/ml spectinomycin, and 3 μg/ml chloramphenicol.

The membranes were then resuspended in the same buffer. Pigment Extraction and Analysis—Pigments were extracted from cell suspensions by mixing with 20 volumes of ice-cold acetone/methanol (7:2, v:v) and recovering the supernatant after a low speed centrifugation. The extraction was repeated until the pellet was colorless. For isolating porphyrins from cell suspensions or growth media, the extraction of pigments was done with 16 volumes of ice-cold acetone, 0.1 m NH4OH (9:1, v:v). This extract was mixed with hexane (v:v) and centrifuged at low speed. Bchl and carotenoids passed into the hexane upper phase, whereas porphyrins were recovered in the ammonia/acetone sub-phase. This phase was dried; porphyrins were redissolved in ethyl ether or acetone before identification by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. In some experiments, the porphyrin extract was analyzed by thin layer chromatography on high performance thin layer chromatography reversed-phase plates (RP18WF254, Merck) following a published protocol (42Gough S.P. Petersen B.O. Duus J.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 6908-6913Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Porphyrin spots were revealed by their fluorescence under UV light, scraped off, and extracted in dimethyl-sulfoxide or acetone before spectroscopic characterization. Coproporphyrin (excreted by low-iron grown R. sphaeroides), Mg2+-protoporphyrin monomethyl ester, and protochlorophyllide (excreted by R. gelatinosus AcsF and BchJ mutants, respectively) were used as standards in these experiments as well as a Mg2+-protoporphyrin monomethyl ester standard (kindly provided by Dr. Bollivar, Illinois Wesleyan University). Spectroscopic Analyses—Absorption spectroscopy was performed with a CARY 500 spectrophotometer. Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Xenius Spectrofluometer (SAFAS, Monaco). The emission and excitation bandwidths were set, respectively, at 2.5 and 5 nm, and the scan speed was 10 or 50 nm/min. Heme Staining—The purified membrane proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained for covalently bound heme with 3,3′, 5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine as described in Thomas et al. (21Thomas P.E. Ryan D. Levin W. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 75: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). Molecular Biology Techniques—Standard methods were performed if not otherwise indicated according to Sambrook et al. (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual..2nd Ed. Ed. Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmids were purified using the Qiagen prep plasmid kit. DNA was treated with restriction enzymes and other nucleic acid-modifying enzymes according to the manufacturer's specifications. DNA fragments were analyzed on agarose gels, and restriction fragments were purified using the Geneclean kit (BIO 101, Inc.). PCR reactions were carried out by using genomic or plasmid templates in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing the DNA, the PCR buffer, 200 μm concentrations of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 1 μm concentrations of each primer, 5% Me2SO and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase. All Primers used in this work are listed in Table II (supplemental material). DNA sequencing was performed using a 3100 Genetic Analyzer automatic DNA sequencer. The sequence of fnrL and of hemN2 reported in this paper were deposited in GenBank™ as accession number AY648960. Gene Cloning and Plasmid Constructions for Allele Replacement—To clone the fnrL gene from genomic DNA of R. gelatinosus, a 1.4-kb fragment was amplified by PCR using the primers ol-fnr-F and ol-fnr-R. The fragment was cloned into the PCR cloning vector pGEM-T to give pSO7000. The fnrL gene was inactivated by the insertion of the Ω cassette in the unique BstEII site within the fnrL coding sequence. Briefly, plasmid pSO7000 was subjected to BstEII restriction enzyme digestion and treated with Klenow polymerase before ligation with the 2-kb SmaI-digested Ω cassette conferring resistance to spectinomycin and streptomycin. The resulting recombinant plasmid was designated pSO7001. To clone the promoter-less hemN2 gene in the pBBR1MCS-2 expression vector, a 1.4-kb PCR fragment was amplified using ol-hemN2-F and ol-hemN2-R. The fragment was cloned first in pGEM-T and then subcloned in pBBR1MCS-2 at the ApaI-SpeI to give plasmid pSO7002. To clone bchE (promoter-less) in pSO7002, the gene (1.7 kb) was amplified by PCR using primers ol-bchE-F and ol-bchE-R and cloned in pGEM-T. The fragment was digested with SpeI-(SphI-blunted) and cloned downstream of hemN2 at the SpeI-(XbaI-blunted) site of pSO7002. This plasmid was designated pSO7003. The sequence and the orientation of both fragments were confirmed by sequencing. To construct a hemN2-lacZ fusion, the promoter region of hemN2 containing the putative FnrL binding site was amplified by PCR (193-bp DNA fragment). The primers (ol-hemN2-BamHI and ol-hemN2-XbaI) were designed to create XbaI and BamHI sites at the ends of the amplified fragment. The sequence and the orientation of the amplified DNA fragment were confirmed by sequencing after cloning into the BamHI and XbaI site of the lacZ transcriptional fusion vector plasmid pSO3001 to generate the fusion plasmid pSO3033 (hemN2-lacZ). Gene Transfer and Strain Selection—Transformation of R. gelatinosus cells was carried out by electroporation as previously described (23Ouchane S. Picaud M. Reiss-Husson F. Vernotte C. Astier C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 379-385PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on Malate plates supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic. Subsequently, after transformant selection, template genomic DNA was prepared from the transformants, and confirmation of the antibiotic resistance marker presence at the desired locus was performed by PCR. FnrL Amino Acid Sequence Analyses—The fnrL gene was located downstream of the ccoNOQPG operon encoding the cbb3 cytochrome oxidase. BlastP and Clustal analyses indicated that the FnrL polypeptide shares extensive similarity with the Fnr protein from β proteobacteria, R. gelatinosus PM1 (80% identity and 87% similarity), Azoarcus sp. (65% identity and 80% similarity), and Polaromonas sp. (64% identity and 82% similarity). Relatively low similarity was observed with Fnr protein from phototrophic α proteobacteria including R. sphaeroides (28% identity and 50% similarity) and R. capsulatus (27% identity and 47% similarity). The FnrL polypeptide (246 amino acids) contains all characteristics and conserved domains of Fnr protein from numerous bacteria (supplemental data). A helixturn-helix DNA binding sequence is identified in the C terminus of the polypeptide, and the four cysteine residues (Cys-17, Cys-20, Cys-26, and Cys-119), which are part of the conserved sensory domain, are well conserved. Anaerobic Induction of Photosynthesis Requires the FnrL Product; FNR Mutant Construction and Characterization—To gain insight into the role of the fnrL gene in photosynthesis, the fnrL gene was disrupted with the spectinomycin/streptomycin resistance cartridge inserted at the BstEII site of fnrL (Fig. 1). Wild type cells electroporated with pSO7001 plasmid were plated on selective medium under respiratory conditions to select transformants. Colonies resulting from double crossover events were orange compared with the purple color of the wild type colonies. A selected colony was subsequently tested for its aerobic and anaerobic photosynthetic growth characteristics. Interestingly, the mutants carrying insertions in fnrL were able to grow under aerobic conditions but were photosynthesis-deficient. This result indicates that anaerobic photosynthetic growth of R. gelatinosus requires a functional fnrL gene. Chlorophyll and Chlorophyll-binding Protein Production in the WT and the FNR Mutant during Aerobic Growth—To assess the effect of mutation in the fnrL gene on the bacteriochlorophyll and bacteriochlorophyll-binding protein (RC-LHI/LHII) synthesis, the wild type and the FNR mutant were grown under different oxygen conditions, and equal amounts of membrane protein prepared from these cells were analyzed by spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 1A, spectral analysis of the membranes showed that both wild type and FNR produce comparable amounts of photosynthetic complexes under high oxygenation conditions. However, in the FNR mutant a slight shift of the 870-nm peak and a reduction in the absorbance at 800 nm were observed, indicating a small reduction of the level of LHII. Thus, it seems that the mutation in fnrL slightly affects the antenna size under these conditions. Nevertheless, when grown under low oxygenation conditions, a substantial reduction of the peaks at 860-800 nm was observed in the FNR mutant, indicating that the amount of photosynthetic complexes was drastically reduced in this mutant (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that photosynthetic complex production requires the presence of the FnrL protein when oxygen tension drops. Pigments were extracted from equal amounts of membrane protein to estimate the amount of bacteriochlorophyll a in these strains. Under high oxygenation conditions, both wild type and FNR produced comparable amounts of bacteriochlorophyll a, as shown by the peak at 770 nm (Fig. 1C). Under low oxygenation conditions, the amount of bacteriochlorophyll a in the FNR mutant is, however, drastically reduced (Fig. 1D). Given the inability of the FNR strain to grow under photosynthetic conditions, we concluded that the FNR mutant cannot produce bacteriochlorophyll a pigments and complexes under photosynthetic anaerobic conditions. The FnrL Protein Is Also Required for Cytochrome Induction—The FNR mutant had a doubling time (2.5 h) comparable with that of the wild type when grown under high oxygenation conditions, whereas under low oxygenation conditions the FNR mutant growth was slower (4 h doubling time). It was established that a drop in oxygen tension induces expression of the cbb3-type cytochrome oxidase in R. gelatinosus WT. To assess the impact of fnrL disruption on cbb3 oxidase, staining of WT and the FNR mutant membranes for covalently bound heme was performed to check the presence of cytochrome c subunits CcoP (32 kDa) and CcoO (23 kDa) of cbb3. As shown on the heme staining gel (Fig. 2A), both subunits were detected in wild type and FNR membranes grown under high oxygenation conditions. The band at 43 kDa present in the WT and in the mutant corresponds to the reaction center-attached tetraheme cytochrome c (PufC). As oxygen tension drops, all c cytochromes were decreased in the FNR mutant. Under low oxygenation conditions, the membranes from the WT contained all these c-type cytochromes, with increased amounts of the cbb3 c-type subunits. In the FNR mutant membranes, only traces of c cytochrome could be detected. The same gel was further stained with Coomassie Blue to check the total amount of loaded proteins (Fig. 2B). We concluded that as a result of fnrL inactivation, synthesis of heme was significantly weaker, and consequently, this inactivation had a pleiotropic effect on cytochrome production. Consistent with this, the FNR mutant grows slower under low oxygenation conditions. Tetrapyrrole Analyses in the FNR Mutant—Decrease of all c-type cytochromes, normally detectable by heme staining in microaerobically grown wild type cells, in the FNR mutant prompted us to analyze the porphyrins in this mutant. Indeed, microaerobic-grown FNR cells secreted a red pigment into the medium (Fig. 2C1). This pigment was UV-light fluorescent (Fig. 2C2), presumably due to the accumulation and secretion of heme biosynthesis pathway intermediates. Therefore, porphyrins were extracted from the growth medium by ammonia/acetone/hexane treatment and analyzed by spectroscopy (Fig. 3A). The major absorption band at 396 nm and the minor ones at 498-530-565-617 nm as well as the fluorescence emission bands (Fig. 3B) observed in the (622-687 nm) range indicated that the extract contained coproporphyrin III (oxidized coproporphyrinogen III) (24Smith K.M. Porphyrins and Metalloporphyrins. Elsevier, Amsterdam1975: 872-877Google Scholar). However, the emission spectrum also showed a 578-nm band that could not be attributed to coproporphyrin III. This minor component (which was present in variable amounts from one culture to another) could be distinguished from coproporphyrin III by its absorption at 410 nm, as shown by the excitation spectra (Fig. 3B). It could be tentatively identified as a metallo-coproporphyrin III (possibly zinc), a derivative already found to be excreted together with coproporphyrin in other cultures (25Miah I. Biotechnology. 2002; 1: 21-27Crossref Google Scholar, 26Mason M.G. Ball A.S. Reeder B.J. Silkstone G. Nicholls P. Wilson M.T. Appl. Environ.

Chem. 1991; 37: 1173-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Given that coproporphyrinogen III is converted to protoporphyrinogen IX under low oxygen tension by hemN, we concluded that the hemN gene is not functional in the absence of FnrL. Analysis of hemN Expression; Micro-aerobic Induction of hemN2 Requires the FnrL Product—To elucidate the role of FnrL in hemN gene expression, we have cloned a hemN gene that mapped in the photosynthetic gene cluster of R. gelatinosus. But in the course of this study we discovered that R. gelatinosus possesses two hemN genes, hemN1 and hemN2. Both genes contain an FNR consensus sequence in their respective promoters, suggesting that regulation of both hemN genes is mediated by the FnrL regulator. However, only hemN2 encodes a functional oxygen-independent coproporphyrinogen III dehydrogenase. 3S. Ouchane, unpublished information. To quantify hemN2 promoter activity and the impact of FnrL, lacZ fusion to hemN2 promoter was constructed and introduced in the WT and in the FNR mutant. The resulting strains were cultivated under high and low oxygenation conditions, and hemN2 expression was monitored by assaying β-galactosidase activity. As shown in Fig. 4, expression of the hemN2 gene in highly oxygenated WT and FNR cultures was very low and independent of FnrL. The expression was strongly induced (5-fold) under oxygen limitation conditions in the wild type (1560 units). However, induction of hemN2 gene under oxygen limitation was dependent on FnrL, since the promoter activity was still low in the FNR mutant (320 units). Furthermore, hemN2 expression was also strongly induced under anaerobic photosynthetic conditions in the WT (1600 units; not shown). Because the FNR mutant does not grow anaerobically, it was not possible to assess the predicted role of FnrL in anaerobic hemN2 expression in the mutant. Phenotypic Consequences of hemN Expression in trans in the FNR Mutant—The data obtained from porphyrin analyses of the FNR mutant grown under microaerobic conditions in combination with hemN mutant analyses suggest that hemN2 is the first crucial tetrapyrrole gene controlled by Fnr. Therefore, we suggest that Fnr controls respiration and photosynthesis first at the level of hemN2. To test this model, a plasmid carrying a promoter-less hemN2 gene under the control of a lacZ promoter was introduced in the FNR mutant (Fig. 5). Cells bearing either the empty vector (FNR-0) or the vector carrying hemN2 under the lacZ promoter (FNR-N2) were grown under low oxygen conditions and tested for red fluorescence upon illumination with UV light. This test was positive for cells bearing the vector plasmid (control) as they secreted coproporphyrin III into the medium. For the FNR mutant bearing the extra copies of hemN2, fluorescence was considerably reduced in the culture (Fig. 5A). Porphyrin content analyses from the medium and the cells showed that there was no coproporphyrin III (see below). Thus, it appears that constitutive expression of hemN2 is sufficient to rescue the heme synthesis in the cells grown under low oxygen conditions despite the absence of FnrL. Similar experiments were performed with hemN1; however, extra copies of hemN1 did not restore the heme synthesis pathway. Suppression of the FNR heme-deficient phenotype by hemN2 suggested that these cells may contain a functional photosystem and the cytochrome cbb3 oxidase. To test these hypotheses, cytochrome c type content in the membranes from these strains was analyzed by heme staining. As shown in Fig. 5B, the FNR-0 mutant strain bearing the empty vector had a cytochrome c profile similar to that of the FNR mutant, whereas the FNR-N2 mutant strain bearing the hemN2 gene retrieved a cytochrome c profile comparable with that of the WT. These results clearly demonstrate that heme and cytochrome syntheses necessitate a functional FnrL under low oxygen tension. Yet the FNR-N2 mutant bearing the extra copies of hemN2 remained photosynthesis-deficient and incapable of photosystem production, indicating that there must be at least a photosynthesis-involved gene that requires FnrL-mediated expression under the photosynthetic growth lifestyle. What then is the target gene of FnrL in photosynthetic growth in addition to hemN2? BchE, the Key Step in Chlorophyll Synthesis, Is Controlled by FnrL—If FnrL regulates the expression of other photosynthesis genes, then the promoter of these genes is expected to have an FNR consensus binding sequence. No FNR binding motif was found in the photosynthetic gene cluster (genes involved in chlorophyll synthesis, bchCXYZ, bchFNBHLM, bchGP, and the pufBALMC operon encoding the LH/RC subunits). However, inspection of the bchE gene promoter revealed the presence of a TTGAN6CCAA sequence that may serve for FNR-mediated induction of these chlorophyll biosynthesis genes under low oxygen tension and anaerobic conditions. Under these conditions, in the absence of bchE expression, no chlorophyll synthesis could be achieved, and no functional photosynthetic complexes could assemble in the membrane leading to photosynthetically incompetent cells. If FnrL is required for the expression of bchE, then the FNR mutant expressing hemN2 in trans should accumulate MgPMe (10Ouchane S. Steunou A.S. Picaud M. Astier C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6385-6394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, FNR and FNR-hemN2 cells were grown under high oxygenation and low oxygenation conditions, and their membranes and tetrapyrrole content were analyzed. As shown in Fig. 6, spectral analyses of the membranes showed that both FNR and FNR-N2 produced comparable and very low amounts of Bchl complexes under low oxy"

Plant chloroplasts contain a unique version of the cpn10 co-chaperonin, cpn20, which consists of two homologous cpn10-like domains (N-cpn20 and C-cpn20) that are connected by a short linker region. Although cpn20 seems to function like other single domain cpn10 oligomers, the structure and specific functions of the domains are not understood. We mutated amino acids in the “mobile loop” regions of N-cpn20, C-cpn20 or both: a highly conserved glycine, which was shown to be important for flexibility of the mobile loop, and a leucine residue shown to be involved in binding of co-chaperonin to chaperonin. The mutant proteins were purified and their oligomeric structure validated by gel filtration, native gel electrophoresis, and circular dichroism. Functional assays of protein refolding and inhibition of GroEL ATPase both showed (i) mutation of the conserved glycine reduced the activity of cpn20, whether in N-cpn20 (G32A) or C-cpn20 (G130A). The same mutation in the bacterial cpn10 (GroES G24A) had no effect on activity. (ii) Mutations in the highly conserved leucine of N-cpn20 (L35A) and in the corresponding L27A of GroES resulted in inactive protein. (iii) In contrast, mutant L133A, in which the conserved leucine of C-cpn20 was altered, retained 55% activity. We conclude that the structure of cpn20 is much more sensitive to alterations in the mobile loop than is the structure of GroES. Moreover, only N-cpn20 is necessary for activity of cpn20.

However, full and efficient functioning requires both domains. It is now well accepted that protein folding in the cell requires the assistance of a family of proteins known as chaperones (1.Ellis J. Nature. 1987; 328: 378-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). One family of chaperones, known as Type I “chaperonins,” is composed of two members that cooperate to fold proteins in the cell during processes of synthesis, translocation, or stress (2.Levy-Rimler G. Bell R.E. Ben-Tal N. Azem A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The prototypes of these proteins are the bacterial GroEL (chaperonin 60 or cpn60) 3The abbreviations used are: cpn60, chaperonin 60; Rubisco, ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase; ch, chloroplast; N-cpn20, N-terminal cpn10-like domain; C-cpn20, C-terminal cpn10-like domain; MDH, malate dehydrogenase.3The abbreviations used are: cpn60, chaperonin 60; Rubisco, ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase; ch, chloroplast; N-cpn20, N-terminal cpn10-like domain; C-cpn20, C-terminal cpn10-like domain; MDH, malate dehydrogenase. and GroES (chaperonin 10 or cpn10). GroEL is a cylindrical oligomer constructed of two back-to-back heptameric rings, of 60 kDa subunits each. The co-chaperonin GroES is a smaller ring formed from seven identical 10-kDa subunits. Unfolded proteins bind to the inner cavity of one ring of the GroEL cylinder, and are released by the binding of ATP and GroES to the opposing toroid. The structure and mechanism of these proteins from Escherichia coli have been extensively reviewed (3.Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3084) Google Scholar, 4.Sigler P.B.

Biochem. 1984; 24: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Early studies indicated that the chloroplast proteins were structurally distinct from GroEL and GroES (for a review see Ref. 6.Boston R.S. Viitanen P.V. Vierling E. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 191-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Whereas the bacterial and mammalian cells contain only one homolog each of cpn60 and cpn10, the plant cell codes for several homologs of the chaperonin proteins. A survey of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome has identified 29 genes that potentially encode chaperonins (7.Hill J.E. Hemmingsen S.M. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2001; 6: 190-200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of these, 9 contain chloroplast signal sequences, three of them for co-chaperonin homologs. One of these homologs was previously identified in both pea and spinach as being twice the size of the classic cpn10 co-chaperonin (8.Bertsch U. Soll J. Seetharam R. Viitanen P.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8696-8700Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis showed that the protein was composed of two linked cpn10 homologs, joined by a putative linker region of Thr-Asp-Asp-Val-Lys-Asp (9.Baneyx F. Bertsch U.

This double co-chaperonin, called cpn20 (ch-cpn20) or cpn21, contained a signal sequence and was shown to be imported into the chloroplast. In vitro, it was capable of assisting GroEL and chloroplast cpn60 in refolding denatured Rubisco (8.Bertsch U. Soll J. Seetharam R. Viitanen P.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8696-8700Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 10.Dickson R. Weiss C. Howard R.J. Alldrick S.P. Ellis R.J. Lorimer G. Azem A. Viitanen P.V. J. Biol.

Cross-linking studies indicated that spinach cpn20 existed as many oligomeric species in solution, however, the conformation bound by GroEL has yet to be elucidated (12.Sharkia R. Bonshtien A.L. Mizrahi I. Weiss C. Niv A. Lustig A. Viitanen P.V. Azem A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1651: 76-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).Cloning of the homologous gene from A. thaliana showed it to be 61% identical to that from spinach (13.Hirohashi T. Nishio K. Nakai M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1429: 512-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 14.Koumoto Y. Shimada T. Kondo M. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Hara-Nishimura I. Nishimura M. Plant J. 1999; 17: 467-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Structural studies suggested that, in contrast to the heptameric GroES prototype, this homolog was tetrameric: both native gel electrophoresis and gel filtration experiments gave an estimated molecular mass of 70–80 kDa (13.Hirohashi T. Nishio K. Nakai M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1429: 512-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 14.Koumoto Y. Shimada T. Kondo M. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Hara-Nishimura I. Nishimura M. Plant J. 1999; 17: 467-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Tobacco plants transformed with heterologous cpn20 under a constitutive promoter accumulated the protein in chloroplast stroma, confirming chloroplast localization. In line with its function as a heat shock protein, Northern blot analysis showed that the Arabidopsis cpn20 was heat-inducible (14.Koumoto Y. Shimada T. Kondo M. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Hara-Nishimura I. Nishimura M. Plant J. 1999; 17: 467-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).The two cpn10-like domains of Arabidopsis cpn20 are 46% identical to each other (13.Hirohashi T. Nishio K. Nakai M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1429: 512-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 14.Koumoto Y. Shimada T. Kondo M. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Hara-Nishimura I. Nishimura M. Plant J. 1999; 17: 467-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Each side contains the highly conserved N-terminal PLXDRV motif and has its own “mobile loop,” the region that was shown to be responsible for binding to cpn60 (15.Landry S.J. Taher A. Georgopoulos C. van der Vies S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11622-11627Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 16.Landry S.J. Zeilstra-Ryalls J. Fayet O. Georgopoulos C. Gierasch L.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Two studies published a decade ago on the spinach homolog of cpn20 cloned each domain separately to determine the role of each. Both studies found that the individual domains were not functional in vitro, but did exhibit some activity in vivo, suggesting that each of the two domains may be able to function independently (9.Baneyx F. Bertsch U. Kalbach C.E. van der Vies S.M. Soll J. Gatenby A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10695-10702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 17.Bertsch U. Soll J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 1039-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, the lack of activity in vitro may suggest that overall oligomeric structure is necessary for full function. Thus, the significance of the double domain structure remains unclear.In this work, we mutated conserved amino acids in the mobile loops of A. thaliana cpn20. Our approach used information from previous mutation analyses of GroES, which were able to map amino acids critical for binding to GroEL. We altered conserved mobile loop amino acids in the N-terminal cpn10-like domain (N-cpn20), the C-terminal cpn10-like domain (C-cpn20), or in both. Structural analyses were carried out on the purified proteins to ensure their oligomeric integrity and their functionality was tested in vitro. Overall, our results suggest that the structure of cpn20 is much more sensitive to changes in the mobile loop region than is GroES. We also show that whereas the primary protein folding assistance by cpn20 resides in its N-terminal domain, maximal activity of the protein requires a functional C terminus as well.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of Single Domain (truncated) cpn20 Constructs−The N-cpn20 and C-cpn20 homologs of mature wild type cpn20 from A. thaliana (At5g20720) were cloned individually by PCR into pGEM T-easy (Promega) with primers that added the restriction site NdeI before the N terminus of each domain and XhoI after the C terminus of each domain, as follows: for N-cpn20: cpn20-1, 5′-TAACATATGGCTTCTGTTGTTGCCCCTAAG-3′; cpn20-2, 5′-TAACTCGAGCTCTGTCTCAAGAATGCC-3′; for C-cpn20: cpn20-3, 5′-TAACATATGAAAGATCTCAAACCTTTGAAT-3′; cpn20-4, 5′-TAACTCGAGAGAAAGTATAGCCATCAC-3′. The constructs were further cloned into pET22b+ (Novagen), and overexpressed with a His6 tag derived from the vector.Preparation of cpn20 Mutants−Mutagenesis was carried out on pGEM-T-easy (Promega) containing the mature wild type A. thaliana cpn20 (At5g20720) gene, using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The following primers were used to introduce site-specific mutations (mutated codon is underlined): G32A1, 5′-AGAGGAGAAGACTTTAGGTGCGATCTTACTTCCATCCACTG-3′; G32A2, 5′-CAGTGGATGGAAGTAAGATCGCACCTAAAGTCTTCTCCTCT-3′; G130A1, 5′-GGAGAAAACAGCTGGAGCGTTGTTGTTAACCGAGA-3′; G130A2, 5′-TCTCGGTTAACAACAACGCTCCAGCTGTTTTCTCC-3′; L35A1, 5′-GAGAAGACTTTAGGTGGTATCTTAGCACCATCCACTGCTCAATCAAAAC-3′; L35A2, 5′-GTTTTGATTGAGCAGTGGATGGTGCTAAGATACCACCTAAAGTCTTCTC-3′; L133A1, 5′-GCTGGAGGGTTGTTGGCAACCGAGACTACCAAAGA-3′; L133A2, 5′-TCTTTGGTAGTCTCGGTTGCCAACAACCCTCCAGC-3′. For preparation of the double glycine mutants, pGEM-T-easy containing the G32A mutant was used as a template and mutagenesis was performed using the G130A1 and G130A2 primers. To generate the double leucine mutant, the L35A mutant in pGEM-T-easy was used as a template and mutagenized using primers L133A1 and L133A2. Final constructs were inserted into the expression vector pET22b+ (Novagen) between NdeI and XhoI restriction sites. Six histidine residues upstream to the XhoI of the vector were added to the C terminus of the proteins.Preparation of GroES Mutants−GroES in pTRC99a (obtained from Yechezkel Kashi at the Technion Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel) served as a template for mutagenesis, using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The following primers were used to introduce site-specific mutations: G24A1, 5′-GAAACTAAATCTGCTGGCGCAATCGTTCTGACCGGC-3′; G24A2, 5′-AGCCGGTCAGAACGATTGGCGCAGCAGATTTAGTTTC-3′; L27A1, 5′-GCTGGCGGCATCGTTGCAACCGGCTCTGCAGCG-3′; L27A2, 5′-CGCTGCAGAGCCGGTTGCAACGATGCCGCCAGC-3′. All constructs were fully sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired mutation.Purification of Ch-cpn20 Mutants, Single Domain (Truncated) Proteins, and Wild Type Proteins−Ch-cpn20 constructs described above were overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3). Overnight cultures in Luria broth containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) were diluted 1:10 into the same medium and grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.7. Overexpression was then induced for 3 h with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at the same temperature. Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 6000 × g in a SLC-4000 rotor. For the preparation of cell-free extracts, cell pellets were resuspended 1:7 (w/v) in 20 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.4, 5% glycerol, 200 mm NaCl, 30 mm imidazole, 1 μg/ml protease inhibitor mixture (pepstatin, chymostatin, anti-pain, leupeptin, aprotinin, all purchased from Sigma), 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1,500 units DNase (Sigma), homogenized, and passed through a microfluidizer. Debris was removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 35,000 × g in an ultra-centrifuge in a Ti-70 rotor. Supernatant was bound to nickel-agarose resin (Rimon Biotech), washed, and eluted with 300 mm imidazole. Relevant fractions were concentrated and desalted (PD10 columns, GE Healthcare) to a final buffer of 20 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol. Single domain proteins were further purified on a Superdex (GE Healthcare) 200 gel filtration column in 20 mm Na-HEPES and 300 mm NaCl.Purification of GroES and GroES Mutants−GroES was purified using an adaptation of a method previously described (18.Eisenstein E. Reddy P. Fisher M.T. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 119-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). GroES constructs described above were grown and harvested as described for cpn20 constructs. Cells were resuspended at a volume to weight ratio (v/w) of 1:3 in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Cell lysates were prepared by sonication for 5 min on ice. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm) was added to the buffer directly before sonication. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 40 min in a SS34 rotor. The supernatant was heated for 20 min at 70 °C (to enrich for the heat-stable GroES), transferred for an additional 10 min to ice, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was diluted in water 1:3 and loaded on an anion exchange column (20 ml, Source Q, Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C, which was pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.4. The proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl in 20 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.4, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions (3 ml) enriched with GroES were eluted between 200 and 300 mm NaCl. These were pooled, concentrated, and further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences), pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Na-HEPES and 200 mm NaCl, and eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions (3 ml) enriched for GroES were concentrated and stored in aliquots at –80 °C.GroEL Purification−GroEL in pTRC99a (obtained from Yechezkel Kashi at the Technion Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel) was overexpressed in E. coli DH5α cells and purified using two ion-exchange dimensions followed by gel filtration, similar to previously described methods (19.Azem A. Diamant S. Goloubinoff P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6671-6675Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).Protein Determination−Protein concentration was determined using the bicinchonicic acid protein assay kit (Sigma) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Protein concentrations refer to monomer concentration unless otherwise indicated.In Vitro Refolding of Heat-denatured Malate Dehydrogenase (MDH)−Thermal denaturation of mitochondrial MDH (0.33 μm) was performed at 47 °C for 30 min in the presence of 10 μm GroEL, 50 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. The chaperonin-assisted MDH refolding was initiated by bringing the sample to room temperature and adding co-chaperonin at various concentrations and 2 mm ATP (20.Goloubinoff P. Diamant S. Weiss C. Azem A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Following a 1-h incubation either at room temperature or 37 °C, aliquots were removed and assayed for MDH activity by adding a reaction mixture containing 150 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.28 nm NADH, and 0.5 mm oxaloacetate. MDH activity was determined by monitoring the oxidation of NADH as a function of time at 340 nm (21.Badcoe I.G. Smith C.J. Wood S. Halsall D.J. Holbrook J.J. Lund P. Clarke A.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9195-9200Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Refolding yields are expressed as a percentage of maximal refolding obtained using GroES. Spontaneous refolding of MDH was generally 1–2%, whereas in the presence of ATP alone, refolding yields were 5–10%. The refolding reaction using GroES generally yields about 80% of an equal amount of native MDH.ATP Hydrolysis−The ATPase assay used in this study couples the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate by pyruvate kinase and the conversion of pyruvate to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase. During this process, the oxidation of NADH is monitored at 340 nm. Each 1-ml reaction mixture contained: GroEL (5 μm), 10 μm co-chaperonin, 50 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm NADH, 0.2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 20 units of pyruvate kinase, and 10 units of lactate dehydrogenase. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 2 mm ATP. A reduction in the absorbance of NADH was monitored at 340 nm for 4 min. Rates were extracted from the linear phase of the reaction.Native Gels−Proteins (10 μg) were separated on 10% polyacrylamide mini-gels using the Laemmli buffer system and omitting SDS and β-mercaptoethanol (22.Laemmli U.K. Beguin F. Gujer-Kellenberger G. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 47: 69-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar).Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy (CD)−CD experiments were conducted using an Aviv CD spectrometer model 202. Wavelength scans were performed using 1 mg/ml of protein diluted in 5 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.4, and 50 mm NaCl, in a 0.1-mm cell at increasing temperatures. Each spectrum was obtained by averaging 5 spectra recorded from 260 to 190 nm. Data were recorded every 1 nm with an averaging time of 4 s. The protein was equilibrated for 1 min at each temperature before initiating the scan. Raw data were corrected for buffer contribution, smoothed, and converted to molar ellipticity.CD temperature scans were performed in a 1-mm path cuvette at a protein concentration of 0.3 mg/ml. Scans were performed by varying the temperature from 4 to 80 °C and data were collected every 1 °C with an equilibration time of 30 s. Ellipticity was monitored at 222 nm.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONMutagenesis Strategy−The double cpn20 constitutes an intriguing divergence from classic GroES-like cpn10 molecules in that it is composed of two GroES-like domains. The first logical experiment in attempting to explain the significance of such redundancy would be to separate the homologous domains. Single domain clones from spinach chloroplast were previously designed to address this topic and found inactive in vitro (9.Baneyx F. Bertsch U. Kalbach C.E. van der Vies S.M. Soll J. Gatenby A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10695-10702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 17.Bertsch U. Soll J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 1039-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In vivo, some activity was reported for the individual domains. Upon close examination, we found that the division site chosen between the two cpn10-like domains did not fall in the purported linker site (9.Baneyx F. Bertsch U. Kalbach C.E. van der Vies S.M. Soll J. Gatenby A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10695-10702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A); instead, it fell within the C terminus of the N-domain. Suspecting that this might explain the observed in vitro inactivity of the protein domains, we began by separately cloning each cpn10-like domain of cpn20 from A. thaliana, dividing the gene in the center of the purported linker region (Fig. 1A). As in the previously published works, these halves were inactive in vitro (data not shown).The results may suggest that the whole molecular configuration and perhaps inter-domain interaction is required for stability and function of the protein. Thus, we utilized a different approach to analyzing the contribution of each domain for function of the protein, which preserved the larger order molecular interactions. This approach involved mutating amino acids critical for binding to GroEL, in one domain or the other, thereby allowing us to inactivate each domain separately.The amino acids chosen for mutagenesis were based on extensive structural studies of the bacterial GroES, which have identified residues important for GroEL binding. The unstructured mobile loop region of GroES was first identified as being important for the binding of co-chaperonin to GroEL (15.Landry S.J. Taher A. Georgopoulos C. van der Vies S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11622-11627Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 16.Landry S.J. Zeilstra-Ryalls J. Fayet O. Georgopoulos C. Gierasch L.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). This mobile loop is highly conserved in all known cpn10 homologs (23.Richardson A. Schwager F. Landry S.J. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4981-4987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Further mutagenesis and other studies confirmed that the “IVL” motif within the GroES mobile loop was primarily responsible for the affinity of cpn10 to cpn60 (15.Landry S.J. Taher A. Georgopoulos C. van der Vies S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11622-11627Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 16.Landry S.J. Zeilstra-Ryalls J. Fayet O. Georgopoulos C. Gierasch L.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 23.Richardson A. Schwager F. Landry S.J. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4981-4987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 24.Richardson A. Georgopoulos C. Genetics. 1999; 152: 1449-1457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the preceding GG allowed for formation of the hairpin that is adopted upon binding to GroEL (15.Landry S.J. Taher A. Georgopoulos C. van der Vies S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11622-11627Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 16.Landry S.J. Zeilstra-Ryalls J. Fayet O. Georgopoulos C. Gierasch L.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Other amino acids in the mobile loop region were also shown to contribute to the affinity of cpn10 to cpn60 (23.Richardson A. Schwager F. Landry S.J. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4981-4987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).An alignment of the mobile loop region from the N-cpn20, C-cpn20, and cpn10 from various origins is presented in Fig. 1B. The mutations carried out in the present study are labeled with an asterisk. In one set of mutants, one of the conserved Gly was mutated to Ala. In the other set of mutants, the highly conserved L of the GroES “IVL” binding site (ILL in N-cpn20 and LLL in C-cpn20) was mutated to Ala. The mutations were carried out in the N-terminal domain (G32A,L35A), the C-terminal domain (G130A,L133A), or in both cpn10-like domains of the full-length cpn20 (GDM-glycine double mutant; LDM-leucine double mutant). For comparison, the same mutations were made in GroES (G24A,L27A).Purification and Structural Properties of Wild Type and Mutated Ch-cpn20−Wild type and mutant cpn20 were purified as His-tagged proteins on a nickel-agarose resin. GroES and its mutants were purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A gel showing purified mutants is shown in Fig. 2. The integrity of the oligomeric structure and stability of the purified mutants were examined using gel filtration, native gel electrophoresis, and CD spectroscopy. Gel filtration analysis showed that all the purified mutants, wild type cpn20, and GroES eluted primarily in 2–3 fractions when run on a Superdex 200 gel filtration column. Although the GDM mutant elutes in the same fractions, it appears over a broader range of higher oligomeric species than the others (Fig. 3). These results are supported by native gel electrophoresis showing that cpn20 and most of its mutated forms migrate slightly more slowly than GroES, whose oligomeric molecular mass is 70 kDa (data not shown). This is consistent with reports published previously suggesting that ch-cpn20 from A. thaliana forms a tetrameric structure (13.Hirohashi T. Nishio K. Nakai M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1429: 512-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 14.Koumoto Y. Shimada T. Kondo M. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Hara-Nishimura I. Nishimura M. Plant J. 1999; 17: 467-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Similar to results from the gel filtration, native gel electrophoresis showed that the GDM double mutant seemed to form a significant amount of higher order structures, indicating that mutation of the conserved glycines on both domains has a deleterious effect on the structure of cpn20.FIGURE 2Purification of GroES, cpn20, and cpn20 mutants.

Fractions of 1 ml were collected and run on SDS-PAGE. Total (T) contains 5 μg of the loaded sample.

Fig. 4, A–C, present sample traces of representative cpn20 mutants L35A and G130A compared with wild type ch-cpn20. Interestingly, the double cpn20 exhibits a similar CD spectrum to GroES, indicating a similar secondary structure. Moreover, for all the mutants, a clear transition between 200 and 250 nm was observed at temperatures greater than 60 °C, similar to the results previously reported for GroES (25.Boudker O. Todd M.J. Freire E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 770-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition to the spectra, thermal denaturation was monitored at 222 nm between 4 and 80 °C and indicated a similar degree of thermal stability for cpn20 and all the mutant proteins, with a Tm of ∼50 °C (representative curves in Fig. 4D; all cpn20 mutants in supplemental data). Despite a similar Tm, the denaturation curve of GDM was biphasic (Fig. 4E). The increase in ellipticity at higher temperatures observed for GDM indicates that the protein aggregated (26.Gur E. Biran D. Gazit E. Ron E.Z. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1391-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and this was supported by a large amount of white precipitate in the cuvette at the end of the experiment. Overall, the results indicate that, with the exception of the GDM double mutant, the mutations did not affect the oligomeric structure of the proteins.FIGURE 4Circular dichroism analysis of cpn20 mutants.
