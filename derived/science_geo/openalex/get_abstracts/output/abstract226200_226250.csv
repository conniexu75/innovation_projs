Except for slight activity against L-glutamate, no oxidation of L-amino acids was observed. Recently a means for inducing the formation of a soluble L-amino acid oxidase by the mold was reported by Bender, Krebs, and Horowitz (2). This is accomplished by reducing the biotin content of the basal medium (3) from the 5 γ per liter usually employed to 0.25 γ per liter. When cultured in such a medium, Neurospora produces an active L-amino acid oxidase which can be demonstrated both in extracts and in the medium. Reduction of the biotin level produces no effect on the D-amino acid oxidase, which is still found in extracts but not in the culture medium. The activity of the L-oxidase toward thirty-eight amino acids has been investigated by Bender and Krebs (4). 

The initial purpose of the present investigation was to explore certain possibilities for a genetic study of the enzyme. Of special interest was the fact, cited by Bender et al. (a), that the oxidase could not be detected in all of the wild type strains tested. The question arose as to whether this is due to the genetic inability of certain strains to form the enzyme. In connection with the investigation of this problem a general survey of the properties of the enzyme was carried out, together with a preliminary study of the mechanism of the biotin effect and of the adaptive formation of the enzyme. The results of these studies are reported below. 

Simultaneously with our investigation and independently of it, Dr. K. Burton (5), working in Professor Krebs’ laboratory, has carried out a study of the Neurospora L-amino acid oxidase. Where our respective studies overlap mutual confirmation was obtained in most essential points. We wish to thank Dr. Burton for permission to read his manuscript before publication."

Although these authors interpreted their results as showing that oc-aminoadipic acid was a precursor in the biosynthesis of lysine by Neurospora, other pathways are conceivable. 

During the isolation of α-aminoadipic acid from a natural protein radioactive α-aminoadipic acid was added as a marker for chromatographic analysis (2). In order to identify the isolated amino acid an aliquot was provided as a growth substance for the Neurospora mutant 33933. Thus the opportunity was available to follow the radioactivity and determine whether or not α-aminoadipic acid was a precursor to lysine."

https://openalex.org/W180499543,"In a study of transaminase systems Braunstein (1) learned that α-aminoadipic acid takes part in transamination. Both pigeon breast muscle mince and a purified glutamic transaminase extracted from it were active in transferring an amino group from alanine to α-ketoadipic acid. A plant aspartic transaminase was inactive with the same substrate. 

Experiments by Borsook and Dubnoff (2) on the synthesis of arginine by rat kidney slices showed that, in addition to the activity of glutamic and aspartic acids in transferring amino groups to citrulline, lysine was active. They suggested at that time that lysine was converted to glutamic acid. Since aminoadipic acid was active in transamination, Braunstein suggested (3) that the lysine activity in arginine synthesis was due to its conversion into aminoadipic acid. Dubnoff and Borsook (4) repeated their previous experiments using aminoadipic acid as a substrate and found that it could aminate citrulline sufficiently well to explain the activity of lysine. 

That one path of lysine degradation in guinea pig liver homogenate was through α-aminoadipic acid was proved by Borsook et al. (5) using radioactive L-lysine as a substrate and isolating radioactive α-aminoadipic acid from the reaction mixture. The aminoadipic acid was further degraded to α-ketoadipic acid and glutaric acid (6). Geiger and Dunn (7) and Stevens and Ellman (8) independently found that aminoadipic acid was unable to replace lysine as an essential amino acid in rats and in two bacteria used in bioassays for lysine, Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Streptococcus faecalis. 

The occurrence of free aminoadipic acid in biological material raises the possibility that this amino acid may be a protein constituent. In the research described herein evidence is presented that a-aminoadipic acid is part of a natural protein."

Therefore, when absorbed by living tissues, they may be expected to combine with the nucleic acids of the nucleus and cytoplasm, thereby exerting an influence upon cell multiplication and metabolism. Thus, it appeared of interest to study the effect of this trivalent ion upon the growth rate of rapidly multiplying bacterial cells. Streptococcus faecalis R was selected because it is being used extensively for microbiological assays and its nutritional requirements are well known. The availability of radioactive La140 as a tracer facilitated such experiments. Lanthanum has been shown to be bactericidal for a large number of organisms (2) and to influence CO, production (3). More recently, Bjorkman and Horsfall (4) have reported alterations in the elution behavior of the Lee strain of influenza B virus by means of a single treatment with stable lanthanum acetate. These alterations persisted on serial passages in the absence of lanthanum and were similar to those induced by ultraviolet irradiation."
