https://openalex.org/W1544761069,"Abstract Viscosimetric and centrifugal analyses of nasal and tracheal proteoglycan preparations indicate that: a, the proteoglycan molecules from both cartilages have very similar physical properties (limiting viscosity numbers of 140 and 145 ml per g and s0 values of 25 and 20 S, respectively); b, about 80% of the proteoglycan molecules in each preparation can form aggregates; and c, the aggregates are much larger in nasal than in tracheal preparations (s0 values of 93 and 43 S, respectively). Hyaluronic acid is present at a concentration of 0.4 to 0.8% (w/w) in nasal proteoglycan aggregate preparations. Evidence is presented which suggests that the hyaluronic acid-proteoglycan interactions described by Hardingham and Muir ((1972) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 279, 401) are involved in aggregate formation and that the relative sizes of the aggregates are probably determined by the relative sizes of the hyaluronic acid molecules. Mild proteolysis of proteoglycan aggregates with papain removes the chondroitin sulfate and keratan sulfate from the aggregates while leaving about 25% of the total protein still bound to hyaluronic acid. This bound protein fraction was separated from the hyaluronic acid by chromatography on Sephadex G-200 with 4 m guanidine hydrochloride as the solvent. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that this fraction contains two proteins (molecular weights approximately 40,000 and 65,000) both of which are reduced to smaller peptide fragments when treated with β-mercaptoethanol. The two proteins retain their ability to bind to hyaluronic acid. The interactions between the proteins and the hyaluronic acid in the intact aggregates partially protect the hyaluronic acid from digestion with bacterial chondroitinase."
https://openalex.org/W1556587164,"Abstract By means of new or modified procedures troponin-tropomyosin complex was fractionated into three components plus tropomyosin, and then reconstituted in the absence of urea. Tropomyosin was separated from troponin by hydroxyapatite column chromatography, a method giving sharper separation than the previously used technique of isoelectric precipitation. The chromatography also separated the tropomyosin into two fractions. One gave a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis, and the other a double band; and the complete absence of proline suggested that each was a different form of pure tropomyosin. Troponins I, T, and C were separated by DEAE-Sephadex chromatography in 6 m urea as previously, but the separation was found to be much improved if the troponin was treated with a Ca2+ chelator before being applied to the column. The activity of the troponin fractions was assayed at varying ratios to actin both with and without tropomyosin present. It was found that near physiologic ratios to actin, either the combination of troponin I plus tropomyosin or troponin I plus troponin T inhibited the acto-heavy meromyosin ATPase. However, in both cases when troponin C, which is necessary for Ca2+ sensitivity, was added, the inhibition was reversed not only in the presence but also in the absence of Ca2+. Only when both troponin T and tropomyosin were present in addition to troponin I and C did inhibition occur in the absence but not in the presence of Ca2+. We therefore conclude first, that if troponin T is present tropomyosin may not be required for inhibition by troponin I at physiologic ratios to actin, second, that all three components plus tropomyosin are necessary to restore full Ca2+ sensitivity, and third, that this reconstitution can be accomplished by combining the individual components in the absence of urea."
https://openalex.org/W1492080952,"Abstract A protein-hyaluronic acid complex was isolated from Sepharose 2B chromatography of a sequential chondroitinase plus trypsin digest of a proteoglycan aggregate preparation from bovine nasal cartilage. Two were subsequently isolated from this complex by Sephadex G-200 chromatography with 4 m guanidine hydrochloride as the eluent. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that the two had molecular weights of about 90,000 and 45,000 and that treatment with β-mercaptoethanol did not decrease their sizes. The larger protein gave a broad, diffuse band in the gel, perhaps attributable to the 10 to 15% keratan sulfate present in this fraction. The larger protein accounted for 20%, and the smaller for 10% of the protein in the original proteoglycan aggregate preparation. Both retained their ability to bind to hyaluronic acid. Experiments with aggregate preparations reconstituted from mixtures with [3H]acetylated or unlabeled proteoglycans showed that the larger protein fraction is derived from a portion of the protein in the proteoglycan monomer molecules while the smaller is derived from one of the small molecular weight link proteins that are present in proteoglycan aggregate preparations."
https://openalex.org/W1977309516,"Brain catechol synthesis was estimated by measuring the rate at which brain dopa levels rose following decarboxylase inhibition. Dopa accumulation was accelerated by tyrosine administration, and decreased by treatments that lowered brain tyrosine concentrations (for example, intraperitoneal tryptophan, leucine, or parachlorophenylalanine). A low dose of phenylalanine elevated brain tyrosine without accelerating dopa synthesis. Our findings raise the possibility that nutritional and endocrine factors might influence brain catecholamine synthesis by controlling the availability of tyrosine."
https://openalex.org/W1486203466,"A protein-keratan sulfate core preparation isolated from a chondroitinase digest of bovine nasal proteoglycan chromatographed as a single peak (Kav = 0.65) on a Sepharose 2B column. Sepharose 2B elution patterns for mixtures of the core preparation with different proportions of hyaluronic acid indicated that slightly more than 70% of the core molecules could bind to hyaluronic acid. When the hyaluronic acid was saturated with core molecules, each core molecule occupied a minimum length of 8 to 10 hyaluronic acid disaccharides. Hyaluronic acid oligosaccharides were isolated by Sephadex G-50 chromatography of partial digests of hyaluronic acid with testicular hyaluronidase. Sepharose 2B chromatographic analyses showed that the interaction of reactive core molecules with larger hyaluronic acid molecules was strongly inhibited by HA10 (5 disaccharide repeat units) and by HA9 derived from a β-glucuronidase digest of HA10. HA8, smaller hyaluronic acid oligosaccharides and chondroitin were essentially ineffective in inhibiting the core-hyaluronic acid interaction. Low concentrations of HA10 effectively decreased the viscosity of a mixture of hyaluronic acid with intact proteoglycan, whereas higher concentrations of HA8, HA6, or HA4 caused much smaller decreases. Thus the binding site for hyaluronic acid in reactive core (or intact proteoglycan) molecules interacts strongly with HA10 or larger oligomers, while it only interacts weakly with HA4-HA8 oligomers. Chondroitin did not decrease the viscosity of such a mixture at all, showing that there is specificity for the configuration of the 4-hydroxyl in the glucosamine residues in the hyaluronic acid oligosaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W1599579794,"Abstract Based on the effects of osmotic shock, two categories of transport systems have previously been shown to exist in gram-negative bacteria: (a) the shock-sensitive systems, which are associated with periplasmic binding proteins and which are absent from isolated membrane vesicles, and (b) the shock-insensitive systems, whose carrier proteins are not released by osmotic shock and which are active in membrane vesicles. In this extension of an earlier report (Berger, E. A. (1973) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 70, 1514) energy coupling for several amino acid permeases was examined by studying the ability of various energy sources to drive uptake in starved Escherichia coli cells blocked at specific sites of energy metabolism. We conclude that the energy donors for the two classes of transport systems are fundamentally different. The following evidence suggests the obligatory requirement of phosphate bond energy for the shock-sensitive but not the shock-resistant permeases. (a) Mutants defective in the Ca, MgATPase cannot use oxidative energy supplied by d-lactate or phenazine methosulfate plus ascorbate to drive the shock-sensitive systems. The shock-resistant systems, however, are quite active with these electron donors. (b) Arsenate abolishes the activities of the shock-sensitive but not the shock-resistant permeases. (c) When supplied with a source of glycolytic ATP, the shock-sensitive systems in an ATPase mutant are quite active and are relatively resistant to anaerobiosis and the uncoupler 2,4-dinitrophenol. The shock-resistant systems appear to be driven by an energy-rich membrane state which can be formed by either respiration or ATP hydrolysis: (a) these permeases are strongly inhibited by dinitrophenol, (b) they do not require Ca, MgATPase activity when driven by respiratory energy, (c) in the presence of a source of glycolytic ATP, these systems display respiration-independent activities which are diminished by the ATPase mutation and (d) N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide stimulates proline transport in membrane vesicles and intact cells of strain DL 54, a mutant believed to possess a Ca, MgATPase which is not only inactive but is also defective in its structural role in the membrane (Bragg P. D., and Hou, C. (1973) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 50, 729)."

https://openalex.org/W1587901430,"Abstract Constant infusion of [14C]tyrosine has been used to measure the fractional rates of protein synthesis in vivo in skeletal muscle, heart and liver of normal, streptozotocin diabetic and insulin-treated rats. Diabetes resulted in a 70% reduction in the rate of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle, and a 44% reduction in that in heart. Insulin treatment increased the protein synthesis rate in both tissues in diabetic, but not in normal animals. Changes in the RNA to protein ratio in skeletal muscle and heart in response to diabetes and insulin treatment were qualitatively similar to those in the rate of protein synthesis, but were less pronounced. No effects of diabetes, insulin treatment, or fasting on the rate of synthesis of hepatic tissue proteins in vivo could be observed. Diabetes resulted in a slight fall in the RNA to protein ratio in liver. The results are discussed in the light of data from various laboratories on the effect of diabetes on protein synthesis in subcellular systems."

https://openalex.org/W1617458175,"Abstract The interaction of purified human antithrombin-heparin cofactor and human plasmin was studied in the presence and absence of heparin. Antithrombin is a progressive, timedependent inhibitor of the proteolytic and esterolytic activities of plasmin. Incubation of plasmin with antithrombin for 15 to 30 min results in 90 to 100% inhibition of both activities of the enzyme. The presence of heparin dramatically accelerates the rate of interaction of antithrombin and plasmin, with nearly complete inhibition within 30 s of incubation. Sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis of reduced and nonreduced proteins indicates that antithrombin functions as a potent antiplasmin by forming an undissociable complex which is stable in the presence of denaturing or reducing agents (or both). This complex represents a 1:1 stoichiometric combination of enzyme and inhibitor. Heparin increases the rate of formation of this complex without affecting its dissociability or stoichiometry."
https://openalex.org/W1554425830,"Abstract It was previously reported (Kudryk, B., Reuterby, J., and Blomback, B. (1973) Thromb. Res. 2, 297) that conjugated fibrinogen, after activation with thrombin, has affinity for Fragment D (Fg-D) obtained by digestion of fibrinogen with plasmin. NH2-terminal analysis of the conjugates suggests that fibrinopeptides are released during activation. Conjugates activated with Reptilase have similar affinity characteristics but show a lower content of glycine NH2-terminal groups, suggesting release of only fibrinopeptide A. Most significant is the finding that a conjugated NH2-terminal CNBr fragment of fibrinogen (N-DSK; (Aα1-51, Bβ1-115, γ1-78)2), after thrombin activation and apparent release of fibrinopeptides, has comparable affinity for Fg-D. All of these different conjugates have the strongest affinity for the high molecular weight subspecies of Fg-D (Fg-Ds). These findings are in favor of the existence of two binding domains in fibrinogen which are important for the fibrinogen-fibrin transition. One domain is in Fg-D and the other is in N-DSK. Experiments with an analog of N-DSK showed that certain structures in N-DSK may be of particular importance for binding or activation, or both."
https://openalex.org/W1490847753,"Abstract The lipophilic dye, rhodamine 6G, has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation, with a Ki of about 3 µm, corresponding to 1.2 nmoles of dye per mg of mitochondrial protein. ATP-supported Ca2+ accumulation was blocked, but not that driven by succinate oxidation. Concentrations of rhodamine 6G above 20 µm slowly uncouple respiration and inhibit respiration-dependent Ca2+ uptake. Neither the dinitrophenol-stimulated ATPase nor uncoupled respiration of intact mitochondria were inhibited by the dye, even at 50 µm. Arsenate-stimulated respiration, on the other hand, was partially blocked by 7.5 µm dye, but energy-linked phosphate accumulation was unaffected. Below 10 µm rhodamine 6G, no mitochondrial swelling, loss of matrix protein, or endogenous K+, Ca2+, or Mg2+, was observed. The dye was bound very tightly to mitochondria, being present at 1.3 and 0.8 nmoles per mg of protein for the inner and outer membranes, respectively. Binding was also monitored by direct measurement of H+ release into the suspending medium in the presence of rhodamine 6G. Some 0.6 to 0.75 mole of H+ was ejected per mole of dye added, of which only about 50% was firmly bound. A red shift occurred on binding, the λmax increasing from 527 to 535 nm. The related compound, rhodamine B, a free acid and uncharged at pH 7, was completely without influence on mitochondrial energy-linked functions. Kinetic studies on the rate of ADP-stimulated H+ uptake in the presence and absence of rhodamine 6G yielded nonlinear, Lineweaver-Burk plots and were of noncompetitive type. The Km for ADP decreased from 56 to 29 µm in the presence of 4 µm rhodamine 6G. When the data is expressed as a Hill plot, straight lines are obtained, with the value of (η), the interaction coefficient, increasing from 1.28 to 1.72 after dye addition. Rhodamine 6G did not inhibit the Mg2+ATPase in sonicated submitochondrial particles, unlike aurovertin. It did, however, block adenine nucleotide binding to intact mitochondria, both for [14C]ATP and [14C]ADP. Inhibition by 10 µm dye for low levels of added nucleotide was identical with that caused by 10 µm atractyloside, but was only very slight at higher nucleotide concentrations (0.2 mm). The results of this study support the conclusion that rhodamine 6G blocks the adenine nucleotide translocase apparently being similar to atractyloside and bongkrekic acid. However, in sharp contrast to these inhibitors, rhodamine 6G did not inhibit the 2,4-dinitrophenol-stimulated ATPase of intact mitochondria. Consequently, uncouplers destroy the dye's ability to interfere with the translocase, and this suggests a lipid binding to be involved in the action of rhodamine 6G."
https://openalex.org/W1586767993,"Abstract Microsomal sodium and potassium ion-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase ((Na+ + K+)-ATPase) was prepared from canine renal medulla by the method of Kyte. The two polypeptides of the enzyme were co-purified to homogeneity by solubilization with sodium cholate in the presence of egg lecithin and by removal of contaminating protein by sedimentation. This purified (Na+ + K+)-ATPase was reconstituted into lipid vesicles by slow removal of the cholate. A fraction of this enzyme was oriented in the vesicle membranes in such a way as to catalyze active uptake of 22Na+, dependent on externally added ATP and inhibitable by internally trapped cardiac glycosides, to a level 3-fold higher (60 mm) than the initial concentration of Na+ within the vesicles (20 mm). Double label experiments with 42K+ and 22Na+ indicated that the ratio of K+ efflux to Na+ uptake is far below the 2:3 ratio of K+ influx to Na+ efflux observed in nerve axons and erythrocyte ghosts. Parallel experiments employing 36Cl- and 22Na+ demonstrated that 36Cl- is co-transported along with 22Na+ in the amount necessary to maintain bulk electrical neutrality of charge transported across the membrane. The mechanism of selective transport of Cl- along with actively pumped Na+, rather than exchange of K+ for Na+, cannot be explained by the observation that the permeability of the vesicles to Cl- is roughly 2-fold higher than that for K+. It appears that this reconstituted (Na+ + K+)-ATPase either is capable of pumping Cl- as well as Na+ or is equipped with some specific mechanism for translocating Cl- along with actively pumped Na+."
https://openalex.org/W1679301758,"Abstract We have studied a mutant of Escherichia coli, DL-54, which lacks Ca2+, Mg2+-stimulated ATPase activity and cannot use ATP as an energy source for active transport and other work functions. The purpose of the investigation was to explain the unexpected observation that vesicles of this mutant were also defective in coupling respiration to nutrient accumulation. In vesicles of mutant DL-54, unlike those of the wild type, oxidation of d-lactate did not support accumulation of amino acids, rubidium (in presence of valinomycin), or the lipid-soluble dibenzyldimethylammonium ion. All these functions were restored by treating the vesicles with N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD), an inhibitor of the ATPase complex. Accumulation of amino acids in response to an artificial electrical potential (imposed by valinomycin-mediated K+ efflux) was also deficient in the mutant but was restored by DCCD. We infer that DCCD restores the capacity of mutant vesicles to establish an electrical potential across the membrane which, in turn, may be the immediate driving force for active transport and other work functions. Extrusion of protons by the respiratory chain is a possible mechanism for the generation of a membrane potential. Vesicles of DL-54, unlike those of the parent, exhibit no proton pulse unless they have been first treated with DCCD. A plausible basis for all these phenomena was found in the observation that the permeability of the membrane to protons was far higher in DL-54 than in the parent strain. Treatment with DCCD reduced the proton permeability to the low level characteristic of the wild type and thus prevented dissipation of the electrical potential."

https://openalex.org/W1507331795,"The oscillations observed previously in the operation of the purine nucleotide cycle correspond to oscillations in the glycolytic pathway, as shown by metabolite assays. The oscillatory process involves the activation of phosphofructokinase by its product fructose diphosphate, as well as control by the adenine mononucleotides. The changes in the concentrations of ATP, ADP, and AMP associated with the glycolytic oscillations, and the corresponding changes in the concentrations of GTP and GDP, account for the behavior of the purine nucleotide cycle. The responsiveness of the purine nucleotide cycle to changes in the [ATP]:[ADP] ratio is consistent with its proposed role in maintaining a high [ATP]:[ADP] ratio in the face of a high rate of ATP usage during muscular contraction."
https://openalex.org/W1543093457,"The reduction of aldehyde oxidase (EC 1.2.3.1) by the substrate N1-methylnicotinamide under anaerobic conditions is a biphasic reaction. In the present work we present evidence that this behavior is due to the presence, in standard preparations, of active and inactive enzyme, the former being responsible for the fast reaction and differing from the latter by the presence of a persulfide group. It is also demonstrated that the earlier reported inactivation of the enzyme by cyanide is due to cyanolysis of this persulfide group."

https://openalex.org/W1519901342,"Abstract The relative rates of synthesis of chondroitin 4-sulfate, chondroitin 6-sulfate, and hyaluronic acid by intact 8-day chick embryo vertebral cartilage are found to be influenced in a complex fashion by varying concentrations of d-glucosamine in the culture medium. At 0.17 mm d-glucosamine the intracellular pool of UDP-N-acetylhexosamine is less than 5 nmoles per mg of tissue protein and the rate of chondroitin 6-sulfate synthesis is approximately twice the rate of chondroitin 4-sulfate synthesis. When the concentration of d-glucosamine in the culture medium is increased to 2 mm, the UDP-N-acetylhexosamine level rapidly comes to a steady state level of 30 to 35 nmoles per mg of protein and the overall rate of mucopolysaccharide synthesis is approximately doubled over the rate observed at the lower d-glucosamine level. At 4 and 25 mm d-glucosamine, the pool size of UDP-N-acetylhexosamine remains at 30 to 35 nmoles per mg of protein, but the rate of synthesis of chondroitin 4-sulfate and chondroitin 6-sulfate is lowered, as is the rate of incorporation of l-[3H]leucine into protein. The rate of hyaluronic acid synthesis, on the other hand, increases progressively as the d-glucosamine concentration is raised to 25 mm. At 0.17 mm d-glucosamine, hyaluronic acid synthesis represents approximately 5 % of the total mucopolysaccharide synthesis; at 25 mm d-glucosamine, hyaluronic acid synthesis is 40 % of the total mucopolysaccharide synthesis. The incorporation of d-[14C]glucosamine into chondroitin 4-sulfate and chondroitin 6-sulfate proceeds with a lag. The lag is more pronounced for chondroitin 4-sulfate, and at all d-glucosamine concentrations chondroitin 6-sulfate is formed in excess of chondroitin 4-sulfate in the early stages of the incubation. However, at a time in the incubation which varies with the d-glucosamine concentrations, the rate of chondroitin 4-sulfate synthesis begins to exceed the rate of chondroitin 6-sulfate synthesis and after a 20-hour incubation, the total amount of chondroitin 4-sulfate that accumulates is in excess of the amount of chondroitin 6-sulfate. At all d-glucosamine concentrations, the sum of the rates of chondroitin 4-sulfate, chondroitin 6-sulfate, and chondroitin synthesis is linear; thus, the change in rates of synthesis of individual mucopolysaccharides is not accompanied by a diminution in the over-all rate of mucopolysaccharide synthesis. d-Galactosamine is incorporated into chondroitin sulfate at approximately one-tenth the rate of d-glucosamine incorporation. Increasing concentrations of d-glucosamine in the culture medium have the same qualitative effects on mucopolysaccharide synthesis as corresponding levels of d-glucosamine."

Complete or partial control lasting up to 165 days was achieved in 64 percent of recipients by using two to three pancreases of fetal age (15 to 18½ days) placed under each kidney capsule.

https://openalex.org/W1533540814,"Abstract Phosphoenzyme and dephosphoenzyme from the purified (sodium + potassium)-activated adenosine triphosphatase from Squalus acanthias were reduced with sodium [3H]borohydride followed by acid hydrolysis and treatment with NaOH. Standard homoserine and α-amino-δ-hydroxyvaleric acid were added, and amino acid analysis was carried out in an amino acid analyzer. In a modified buffer, homoserine and α-amino-δ-hydroxyvaleric acid were clearly separated without any overlapping of any of the other amino acids. There was a strong radioactive peak coinciding with the homoserine peak. The radioactivity in the homoserine peak from the dephosphoenzyme was less than 5% of that from the phosphoenzyme. No radioactivity was associated with any other amino acid. The yield of radioactivity from the 32P-labeled acyl phosphate recovered as radioactive homoserine ranged from 19 to 34%. In the complete amino acid analysis, the remainder of the tritium radioactivity was eluted with neutral material and in a small peak emerging at about 25 min. There was no difference in these peaks between dephospho- and phosphoenzyme. Since reduction of an aspartyl β-phosphate residue gives rise to homoserine and reduction of a glutamyl γ-phosphate residue gives rise to α-amino-δ-hydroxyvaleric acid, which can be recoverd after acid hydrolysis of the protein and alkaline treatment, we conclude that the acyl phosphate residue in the (sodium + potassium)-activated adenosine triphosphatase is an aspartyl β-phosphate residue. Under conditions of standard protein hydrolysis in acid for 36 hours, 13% of the α-amino-δ-hydroxyvaleric acid was quantitatively converted to proline. The remainder of the α-amino-δ-hydroxyvaleric acid was recovered unchanged."
https://openalex.org/W1594945712,"Abstract Tryptophan synthase (l-serine hydro-lyase-adding indole) (EC 4.2.1.20) of Neurospora crassa was studied in reaction mixtures containing [2-14C]indoleglycerolphosphate and non-labeled indole. A detailed kinetic analysis of the passage of isotope from indoleglycerolphosphate to indole and to tryptophan during the synthesis of tryptophan revealed that: (a) indole disappears first and indoleglycerolphosphate is utilized after the indole concentration falls to barely detectable levels; (b) significant amounts of radioactivity appear in indole; and (c) the specific radioactivity of the tryptophan formed is much lower than that of indoleglycerolphosphate but 2- to 5-fold higher than that of indole depending inversely upon the initial indole concentration. The analyses of these observations are interpreted as evidence that indole is an enzyme-bound or channeled intermediate in the conversion of indoleglycerolphosphate to tryptophan. The enzyme was separated from reaction mixtures containing an equilibrium mixture of labeled indoleglycerolphosphate and labeled indole by passage of the mixtures through ultrafilters which retained material of molecular weights greater than 50,000. Radioactive indole was found exchangeably bound to the retained enzyme. From these results, it was estimated that 2 to 3 moles of indole were bound per mole of enzyme. The results are interpreted as evidence that the Neurospora enzyme fits well the conceptual framework of the surface model (Davis, R. H. (1967) in Organizational Biosynthesis (Vogel, H. J., Lampen, J. O., and Bryson, V., eds) pp. 303–322, Academic Press, New York) and that the enzyme may have evolved, as first suggested (Bonner, D. M., DeMoss, J. A., and Mills, S. E.

https://openalex.org/W1544749959,"Abstract Incubation of a microsomal fraction from mouse mastocytoma with UDP-[14C]glucuronic acid and unlabeled UDP-N-acetylglucosamine resulted in the formation of a nonsulfated polysaccharide containing [14C]glucuronic acid as the only labeled component present in significant amounts. Similar incubations, carried out in the presence of 3'-phosphoadenylylsulfate yielded a sulfated polymer, with [14C]iduronic acid comprising one-third of the total labeled uronic acid. Products obtained by sulfation of preformed, 14C-labeled glycosaminoglycan showed the same proportion of [14C]iduronic acid. Since the preformed polysaccharide contained radioactive glucuronic acid only, it is concluded that the [14C]iduronic acid residues of the sulfated product had been formed by C-5 epimerization of labeled glucuronic acid units, on the polymer level. Oligosaccharides, isolated after deaminative cleavage of 14C-labeled microsomal polysaccharide, were characterized with regard to the contents and location of iduronic acid and sulfate residues. The results showed that iduronic acid units and ester sulfate groups were accumulated within the same sections of the polysaccharide chain, and suggest therefore that the epimerization of glucuronic acid residues is somehow linked to the sulfation of hydroxyl groups."
https://openalex.org/W1549580994,"Abstract Rat liver phosphofructokinase was purified to homogeneity with a specific activity of 84 units per mg of protein. The sodium dodecyl sulfate-treated purified enzyme migrated as a single band in 5% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel with an apparent molecular weight of 82,000 for the protomer. Polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis demonstrated that the molecular weight of the purified enzyme was 325,000 to 365,000 indicating that the monomer consists of four protomers. The initial velocity kinetics in the forward and the reverse direction revealed clearly intersecting patterns. The product inhibition kinetics were as follows. Fructose-1,6-P2 was a competitive inhibitor versus fructose-6-P at nonsaturating and saturating concentrations of MgATP. In the reverse reaction, fructose-6-P was a competitive inhibitor versus fructose-1,6-P2 at saturating concentrations of MgADP. The noncompetitive inhibition of fructose-1,6-P2 versus MgATP was completely overcome by saturating concentrations of fructose-6-P. MgADP was a noncompetitive inhibitor versus MgATP both at nonsaturating and saturating concentrations of fructose-6-P. MgADP exhibited also noncompetitive inhibition versus fructose-6-P at nonsaturating concentrations of MgATP but the inhibition became uncompetitive at saturating concentrations of MgATP. The results are in accordance with an ordered Bi Bi reaction mechanism where fructose-6-P is the first, MgATP the second substrate to bind, and MgADP the first and fructose-1,6-P2 the second product to be released."
https://openalex.org/W2129773900,SUMMARY These studies were designed to determine whether insulin affected the ATPase system of the adipocyte plasma mem- brane. The hormone was found to stimulate the Mg2+- ATPase significantly at concentrations as low as 5 microunits per ml and reaching maximum stimulation between 50 to 100 microunits per ml. The effect occurred at the earliest time point measured (2.0 min) and was linear over a 20-min incubation. The maximal mean dBerence in specific activity caused by 100 microunits of insulin per ml was 1.10 f 0.11 pmoles of Pi per mg of protein per 10 min in 25 experiments and was a 12.1% increase over the basal mean specific activity of 9.82 f 0.38. Insulin did not stimulate the sodium and potassiti ion-activated Mg2+ATPase of the plasma membrane nor the Mg2+ATPase of either the adipo- cyte mitochondrial or microsomal fractions. Epinephrine had no effect on the plasma membrane Mg2+ATPase. Pre- incubation of adipocytes with insulin prior to preparation of the plasma membranes or preincubation of the membranes prior to assay did not prevent the insulin stimulation of the Mg2+ATPase. The basal enzyme activity of insulin-pre- treated membranes or of membranes from insulin-pre- treated cells was signi&antly lower than the corresponding controls. Oligomycin and sodium azide significantly lowered the basal Mg2+ATPase specific activity and prevented the insulin stimulation of the enzyme but neither agent blocked the binding of insulin to the plasma membranes. Con- canavalin A mimicked the effect of insulin on the plasma membrane Mg2+ATPase but produced a greater magnitude of change and could overcome the inhibition caused by oligo- mycin and sodium azide. The data suggest that insulin stimulates the Mg2+ATPase after interacting with the mem- brane receptor but the role of this phenomenon in the mech- anism of insulin action remains to be determined. Insulin is known to cause a set

Under the experimental conditions employed, protein(s) required for the expression of the alternate pathway is synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes at a constant rate for 2.5 hours after an initial 0.5-hour lag. Titration of chloramphenicol-treated cultures with salicylhydroxamic acid and cyanide shows that the flux of reducing equivalents through the cytochrome chain proceeds at the maximum possible rate, while the flux of reducing equivalents through the alternate respiratory pathway proceeds at a variable rate. The flux through the cytochrome chain decreases with a half-life of 4.6 hours upon addition of chloramphenicol and the flux through the alternate oxidase pathway increases as the flux through the cytochrome chain decreases. The alternate pathway is synthesized and assembled during a time period when only small changes occur in the flux through the cytochrome chain and oxidative phosphorylation is not affected. The data are consistent with a model for induction of the pathway that proposes a mitochondrially synthesized repressor protein to repress the nuclear genes that code for the alternate oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W2142044736,"Abstract The effects of sodium and potassium on the rate of ouabain binding to sodium and potassium ion-activated adenosine triphosphatase, isolated from the outer medulla of canine kidney, were examined in the presence of a magnesium ATP complex (37°; pH 7.4). In the presence of high sodium (≥ 10 mm), sodium accelerated and potassium retarded the rate of binding through a process kinetically defined by competition between sodium and potassium for a common site. The slow rate of binding in the presence of magnesium·ATP was also elevated by low sodium and retarded by potassium. The sensitivity of the latter reaction to potassium appeared to be an inverse function of the magnesium·ATP concentration and the ability of potassium to inhibit ouabain binding in the absence of sodium correlated with its ability to inhibit a ouabain-sensitive, magnesium-dependent ATPase activity, which was observed in the absence of sodium. These findings are consistent with glycoside binding to a receptor conformation that exist within the enzyme turnover cycle, which can operate under three conditions: high sodium and high potassium = fast rate; low sodium and zero potassium = intermediate rate; zero sodium and zero potassium = very slow rate. The antagonism between magnesium·ATP and potassium may reflect conversion of the enzyme from one state to another by magnesium·ATP which counteracts a potassium-induced stabilization of the other state. The kinetic data are also consistent with the existence of two sodium-dependent glycoside binding sites. If the latter were the case, analysis of the reaction rates at varying concentrations of sodium suggested two apparent sites for sodium-enzyme interaction, one with Ka of 16 mm and the other with Ka of 0.63 mm."

The associated fungus, ‘Hyphomyces destruens’, has neither been legitimately described nor satisfactorily placed in any group of fungi except broadly in the Phycomycetes, on the grounds of the morphology of the hyphae in tissue and culture."
https://openalex.org/W2099480362,"Cell-free extracts of Neurospora crassa have been obtained which in the presence of O2 and Fe2+ catalyze the transfer of the sulfur atom of cysteine to the imidazole ring of hercynine (histidine betaine) to form ergothioneine (2-mercaptohistidine betaine). The general nature of the conversion has been established by the isolation of an intermediate compound, S-(β-amino-β-carboxyethyl)ergothioneine sulfoxide, which is subsequently converted by a pyridoxal-requiring enzyme to ergothioneine and pyruvate. Chemical synthesis of the intermediate sulfoxide has been accomplished by the condensation of β-chloroalanine with ergothioneine and oxidation of the resultant thioether with hydrogen peroxide."
https://openalex.org/W1510102401,"Abstract The phosphoryl acceptor substrate of phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11), namely d-fructose-6-P, can exist in four forms in solution due to facile ring-chain tautomerization, anomerization, and hydration. These forms include the cyclic α- and β-furanose anomers and the acyclic keto and hydrated keto forms. In order to establish the tautomeric and anomeric specificity of phosphofructokinase (from rabbit muscle), several structurally locked, isosteric analogues of the four forms of d-fructose-6-P were tested kinetically for enzymatic activity. 2,5-Anhydro-d-mannitol-1-P (structurally identical with 2,5-anhydro-d-mannitol-6-P) and 2,5-anhydro-d-glucitol-6-P were synthesized and characterized. The former, a novel analogue of β-d-fructofuranose-6-P, was found to be an alternate substrate with kinetic constants closer to the natural substrate than any compound yet reported (Km = 0.41 mm and a Vmax relative to fructose-6-P = 87%). The latter, an analogue of α-d-fructofuranose-6-P, was found to be an effective competitive inhibitor of phosphofructokinase (Ki = 0.34 mm). d-Xylulose-5-P, d-mannitol-1-P (identical with d-mannitol-6-P), d-glucitol-6-P, and dihydroxyacetone, good analogues of the acyclic keto form of d-fructose-6-P and its hydrate, were inactive as inhibitors or alternate substrates. These findings indicate that, in binding, the fructose-6-P site has a tautomeric specificity for the cyclic furanose forms of its substrate, whereas in phosphorylation, it has a more restrictive anomeric specificity, accepting only β-d-fructofuranose-6-P. It seems that phosphofructokinase has evolved so as to phosphorylate the form of its substrate most abundant in solution. It is proposed that this enzyme be more accurately renamed ATP:β-d-fructofuranose 6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase."
https://openalex.org/W18312891,"Abstract The approximate number and molecular weight of pea seedling ribosomal proteins were determined by two-dimensional electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels containing either urea or sodium dodecyl sulfate. The small (40 S) ribosomal subunit contained 32 to 40 proteins and the large (60 S) subunit 44 to 55 proteins. The great majority of ribosomal proteins were basic and had molecular weights between 20,000 and 30,000. At least two proteins of higher molecular weight were found in the large subunit. Structural homologies between ribosomal proteins of different origin were estimated by two-dimensional electrophoretic analysis, by immunoelectrophoresis, double-diffusion tests, and quantitative immunoprecipitation. A high degree of evolutionary conservation was found, by the above methods, among ribosomal proteins of several species of higher plants, whereas little homology was found between chloroplast proteins and cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins of the same plant. No homologies were detected between chloroplast ribosomal proteins and proteins extracted from ribosomes of either mitochondria, bacteria, or blue-green algae."
https://openalex.org/W2011936962,A factor or factors concentrated on leukocytes of cancer patients depress the proliferative response of lymphocytes to stimulation with autologous tumor. Inhibitory activity with material eluted from cells resides in neither high nor lower molecular weight fractions but in a combination of the two. The finding suggests that in vitro inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation to autochthonous tumor occurs because of antigen-antibody complexes.

https://openalex.org/W1480095916,"Abstract Treatment of spinach chloroplasts with 25 to 100 µm potassium permanganate in the presence of light, magnesium, and ADP gives rise to 35 to 60% inhibition of the subsequent phosphorylation and ATPase activities. For half-maximal inhibition, 5 to 10 µm ADP is necessary and ADP is not replaceable by other nucleotides. The light requirement can be met by preillumination as well as by an acid bath of the chloroplasts. The presence of any one of the substances, Pi, arsenate, ATP, or NH4Cl protects the enzyme against permanganate inhibition. Comparison of electron transport rates and pH rise of the control chloroplasts with those of permanganate-treated chloroplasts indicates that permanganate treatment makes the chloroplasts insensitive to ATP-induced stimulation of pH rise and to inhibition of electron transport by ATP. Kinetic analysis of trypsin-activated Ca2+-ATPase activity indicates that as a result of permanganate treatment the affinity of chloroplast coupling factor 1 for ATP has decreased and that the inhibition of this ATPase by ADP has switched from allosteric to competitive. Thus, permanganate seems to modify chloroplast coupling factor 1 and change its control functions by attacking at a site which is only rendered accessible in the presence of ADP and Mg2+ in an energized state of the chloroplasts."

https://openalex.org/W1546910772,"Abstract Mutants of Escherichia coli limited in their ability to synthesize phosphatidic acid become severely restricted in their capacities for growth and macromolecular synthesis. This paper reports the effects of partial limitation of phosphatidic acid synthesis in a mutant of E. coli, resulting from an altered sn-glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.15). The alteration in the Km of this enzyme for sn-glycerol 3-phosphate is correlated with intracellular glycerol-P concentration, rates of lipid and macromolecule synthesis, and growth rate. The reduction in the rate of lipid synthesis correlates well with the reduction in macromolecule synthesis and growth rate and suggests a rapid mechanism for coordination of these processes. Inhibition of lipid synthesis causes a specific reduction in the size of the ATP pool and it is postulated that an activation of ATPase by altered membrane environment may be the possible mechanism of ATP reduction and subsequent loss of synthetic capacities."
https://openalex.org/W1573693094,"Abstract The observed standard free energy change (ΔG0obs) for the ATP-pyrophosphorylase reaction (EC 3.6.1.8) has been calculated for near physiological conditions of temperature, ionic strength, and free magnesium concentration. The observed equilibrium constant (Kobs) for the acetyl-CoA synthetase reaction (EC 6.2.1.1) has been determined at both 25 and 38°, pH 7.0, ionic strength 0.25, and varying free [Mg2+]. The Kobs of this reaction reflects the difference between the ΔG0obs for the hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA and the ΔG0obs for the hydrolysis of ATP to AMP and inorganic PPi. Using Σ and square brackets to indicate total concentrations of all the ionic species present: [see PDF for equation] The observed value of this constant varies with the free [Mg2+] being 10.7 (38°) and 15.1 (25°) at free [Mg2+] = 0; 9.17 (38°) and 12.9 (25°) at free [Mg2+] = 10-4 m, and 9.88 (38°) and 11.4 (25°) at free [Mg2+] = 10-3 m. The values of ΔH0obs for this reaction are also a function of the free [Mg2+], being 4.9 Cal per mole (20.5 kJ per mole) at free [Mg2+] = 0; 4.8 Cal per mole (20.0 kJ per mole) at free [Mg2+] = 10-4 m; and 3.6 Cal per mole (15.3 kJ per mole) at free [Mg2+] = 10-3 m. The ΔG0obs for the hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA is virtually unaffected by the free [Mg2+] and has been previously determined to be -8.54 Cal per mole (-35.75 kJ per mole) under the same conditions of temperature, pH, and ionic strength. Therefore, at 38°, pH 7.0, ionic strength 0.25, and taking the standard state of liquid water to have unit activity ([H2O] = 1), the ΔG0obs for the reaction [see PDF for equation] can be calculated at 38° and ionic strength of 0.25 to be -10.0 Cal per mole (-41.84 kJ per mole) at free [Mg2+] = 0; -9.91 Cal per mole (-41.46 kJ per mole) at free [Mg2+] = 10-4 m; and -9.96 Cal per mole (-41.67 kJ per mole) at free [Mg2+] = 10-3 m. The corresponding equilibrium constants for the hydrolysis of ATP to AMP and inorganic pyrophosphate under these conditions are 10.8 x 106 m ([Mg2+] = 0), 9.26 x 106 m (free [Mg2+] = 10-4 m), and 9.98 x 106 m (free [Mg2+] = 10-3 m)."
https://openalex.org/W2416608665,"Abstract The binding of adenylyl imidodiphosphate (App(NH)p), an analog of ATP with an imido group (--NH--) in place of the terminal oxygen bridge, to myosin and heavy meromyosin was studied. Binding studies were performed at 23–25° in 0.020 m Tris-HCl, 1.00 mm MgSO4, and 0.100 m NaCl at pH 7.4. The dissociation constant of App(NH)p with myosin, 0.400 ± 0.040 µm, is identical with the previously reported Km value for ATP hydrolysis, 0.41 µm (Schliselfeld, L., and Barany, M. (1968) Biochemistry 7, 3206–3213). The dissociation constant of App(NH)p with heavy meromyosin, 0.393 ± 0.104 µm, is nearly identical with the Km value for the hydrolysis of ATP, 0.164 ± 0.033 µm. The low salt-insoluble myosin has a maximum binding value of 1.18 ± 0.04 moles of App(NH)p per 500,000 g of protein. The low salt-soluble heavy meromyosin has a maximum binding value of 2.13 ± 0.08 moles of App(NH)p per 350,000 g of protein. This indicates that the aggregation of myosin molecules at low salt concentration causes a steric hindrance for 41% of the nucleotide binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W2086230404,"CHEMICAL regulation of sexual development in fungi was suggested in the 1880s by Sachs and de Bary (see ref. 1). Burgeff2 later demonstrated that the so-called + and − strains of Mucor mucedo if separated by a colloidion membrane, produced zygophores that grew toward each other. The presence of diffusible substances which function in the sexual cycle has since been demonstrated in, for example, Achlya1,3–8, Allomyces9,10, Ascobolus11–13, Mucor14–20, Saccharormyces21–23, and Neurospora24–27. Varied functions have been attributed to these extracts. In some well studied systems, such as Achlya and Mucor, chemical substances have been reported at almost all stages of sexual development, each serving to initiate the next stage4,17."
https://openalex.org/W1513010528,"Abstract Two mutant strains of Escherichia coli K, K-18 lacking restriction activity (endonucleolytic cleavage of foreign DNA), and the other, K-19 lacking both restriction and modification activities (specific DNA methylation that protects against the homologous restriction activity), complement in vivo to yield a wild type phenotype. Although neither mutant extract alone binds unmodified DNA, the wild type extract and the mixture of mutant extracts do. Retention of the DNA-enzyme complex on membrane filters was used as an assay to purify the two mutant restriction enzymes. Both of these sediment like the wild type enzyme. Complementation in vitro by the two mutant enzymes could be demonstrated by specific DNA binding, cleavage of the unmodified DNA, and restriction-dependent ATP hydrolysis. All of these activities are absent in the individual mutant endonucleases but present in the wild type restriction endonuclease from E. coli K. However, both mutant enzymes show an activity that hydrolyzes ATP which is different from that of the wild type enzyme since it does not require unmodified DNA, but is dependent on the presence of S-adenosylmethionine."
