Some structural elements for membrane translocation of the estrogen receptor α (ERα) have been described, but the mechanisms relevant to other steroid receptors are entirely unknown. Here, we identify a highly conserved 9 amino acid motif in the ligand binding domains (E domains) of human/mouse ERα and ERβ, progesterone receptors A and B, and the androgen receptor. Mutation of the phenylalanine or tyrosine at position–2, cysteine at position 0, and hydrophobic isoleucine/leucine or leucine/leucine combinations at positions +5/6, relative to cysteine, significantly reduced membrane localization, MAP and PI 3-kinase activation, thymidine incorporation into DNA, and cell viability, stimulated by specific SR ligands. The localization sequence mediated palmitoylation of each SR, which facilitated caveolin-1 association, subsequent membrane localization, and steroid signaling. Palmitoylation within the E domain is therefore a crucial modification for membrane translocation and function of classical sex steroid receptors.

Jacobson H.I. Rec. Prog. Horm. Res. 1962; 18: 387-414Google Scholar). However, evidence also supports distinct pools of functional membrane-localized SR, binding estrogen (2Pietras R.J. Szego C.M. Nature. 1977; 265: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), progesterone (P), or androgen (reviewed in Ref. 3Losel R. Wehling M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 46-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Overall, very little is understood regarding the mechanisms of translocation of SR to the plasma membrane (PM). From a structure/function relationship for membrane localization, estrogen receptors (ER) have been best studied. Serine 522 and cysteine 447 in the E domain are necessary for strong physical association of ERα with caveolin-1, and subsequent membrane translocation (4Razandi M. Alton G. Pedram A. Ghonshani S. Webb D. Levin E.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 1633-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 5Acconcia F. Ascenzi P. Bocedi A. Spisni E. Tomasi V. Trentalance A. Visca P. Marino M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Cysteine 447 has been reported to be a site of palmitoylation (5Acconcia F. Ascenzi P. Bocedi A. Spisni E. Tomasi V. Trentalance A. Visca P. Marino M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), a modification that generally increases protein hydrophobicity and membrane association of proteins (6Basu J. Curr. Sci. 2004; 87: 212-217Google Scholar). Other regions, such as the N terminus (A/B) region of ERα have also been reported to participate in membrane localization (7Song R.X. McPherson R.A. Adam L. Bao Y. Shupnik M. Kumar R. Santen R.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), but this has been disputed (4Razandi M. Alton G. Pedram A. Ghonshani S. Webb D. Levin E.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 1633-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). ER have been localized to caveolae rafts in the membrane (8Kim H.P. Lee J.Y. Jeong J.K. Bae S.W. Lee H.K.

Metab. 1999; 10: 369-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Here, ER closely associate with signaling proteins, leading to rapid activation of G proteins and subsequent multiple transducer signals (reviewed in Ref. 11Levin E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 1951-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Evidence strongly supports the idea that the membrane and nuclear ERα and ERβ proteins are distinct pools of the classical receptor proteins in several cells (12Razandi M. Pedram A. Merchenthaler I. Greene G.L. Levin E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2854-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 13Pedram A. Razandi M. Levin E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 1996-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Regarding other steroid receptors, virtually nothing is known about the mechanisms of membrane localization. Related to this, a report identified a new family of membrane heptahelical G protein -coupled receptors that bind progesterone (P) and are products of genes distinct from the gene encoding the classical progesterone receptor(s) (PR) (14Zhu Y. Bond J. Thomas P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2237-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether these proteins or the classical PR mediate rapid actions of P at the membrane (15Boonyaratanakornkit V. Scott M.P. Ribon V. Sherman L. Anderson S.M. Maller J.L. Miller W.T. Edwards D.P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 269-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). In the studies here, we identified a highly conserved sequence and mechanism required for membrane localization of multiple SRs. Mutational analysis established that a 9 amino acid motif in the E domains of ERα and ERβ, PR, and the androgen receptor (AR) mediates membrane translocation via palmitoylation, events necessary for rapid signaling by these receptors. Plasmids and Constructs—Mouse ERα (pcDNA3-ERα kindly provided by K. Korach), ERβ (pSG5-ERβ from J. Gustaffson), human PRB (pLEM-PR) and human AR (pCMV5-AR kindly provided by D. Tindall) were used as wild-type (wt) controls and templates for creating mutations by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based, site-directed mutagenesis (kit from Stratagene). Primers used and the alanine mutants created are shown in Table 1, and all PCR products were sequenced for mutation verification. CHO cells or steroid receptor-negative breast cancer cells were transfected with wt or mutant SR using lipofectamine (4Razandi M. Alton G. Pedram A. Ghonshani S. Webb D. Levin E.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 1633-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), recovered overnight, then exposed for 2 h to 10 nm E2, 100 nm P, or 10 nm T, and immunofluorescent microscopy was carried out for receptor localization, as described (4Razandi M. Alton G. Pedram A. Ghonshani S. Webb D. Levin E.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 1633-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). First antibodies were against the receptor C terminus (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and second antibody was conjugated to FITC (Molecular Probes). For each condition, 300 cells were counted to compare the PM localization of wt versus mutant SR-expressing CHO cells, in two separate experiments. Protein expression was controlled by limiting the amount of plasmid used, to simulate the expression of endogenous SRs expressed at the membrane of MCF-7 and LnCap cells, determined by Western blot (data not shown). To create a fusion protein containing the 9 amino acid motif from ERα (FVCLKSIIL) C terminus to the GFP protein, we used the oligonucleotides (5′-aattctttgtgtgcctcaaatctattattttgg and gatcccaaaataatagatttgaggcacacaaag) to form double-stranded DNA containing the ERα sequence flanked by sticky ends recognizing EcoRI and BamHI enzymes. The DNA was ligated to pEGFP-C2 (Clontech), linearized by EcoRI and BamHI.TABLE 1Primers used for site-directed mutagenesisPlasmid mutationPrimersForwardReversemERαF449AGAACCTGCAGGGTGAAGAGGCTGATGGATTTGAGGCACACAGCCTCTGTGTGCCTCAAATCCATCTCACCCTGCAGGTTCC451AGCAGGGTGAAGAGTTTGTGGCCCCGAAAATGATGGATTTGAGGGCCATCAAATCCATCATTTTGCCAAACTCTTCACCCTGCI456AGTGTGCCTCAAATCCATCGCTTTCACTCCGGAATTAAGCAAAGCGATGGGCTTAATTCCGGAGTGATTTGAGGCACACL457AGTGCCTCAAATCCATCATTGCGCGTGTACACTCCGGAATTAAGCGCAATTAATTCCGGAGTGTACACTGATGGATTTGAGGCAmERβY416AGTTAAAACTGCAGCACAAAGAAGATCATGGCCTTCACACACAGTGCTTCTTTCACTGTGTGTGAAGGCCATGATGTGCTGCAGTTTTAACC418AGCAGCACAAAGAATATCTGGCCGGAGAATCATGGCCTTCACGGCCAGATAGTGAAGGCCATGATTCTCCTTCTTTGTGCTGCI423ACTGTGTGTGAAGGCCATGGCACATACTGGAGTTGAGGAGTGCCATGGCTCCTCAACTCCAGTATGCCTTCACACACAGL424ATGTGTGAAGGCCATGATTGCCCGTACATACTGGAGTTGAGGGCAATCATTCAACTCCAGTATGTACGGCCTTCACACAhPRF818ATTCAAGTTAGCCAAGAAGAGGCGTAACAATACTTTCATACAGAGGGCCCCTCTGTATGAAAGTATTGTTACTCTTCTTGGCTAACTTGAAC820ATCAAGTTAGCCAAGAAGAGTTCCTCATTGTATTAAGAAGTAACAATACTTTCATTGCAATGAAAGTATTGTTACTTCTTAATACGCGAGGAACTCTTCTTGGCTAACTL825AGAGTTCCTCTGTATGAAAGTATTGGCACTTCCAAAGGAATTGTATTAAGAAGTGCCTTCTTAATACAATTCCTTTGGAAAATACTTTCATACAGAGGAACTCL826AGAGTTCCTCTGTATGAAAGTATTGTTAGGCCCTTCCAAAGGAATTGTATTAAGTGCCACTTAATACAATTCCTTTGGAAGGGTAACAATACTTTCATACAGAGGAACThARF805ACACCCCCCAGGAAGCCCTGTGCATGTGCTTTCATGCACAGGGCTTCCTAAAGCAGGGGGGTGC807AFCCCCAGGAATTCCTGGCCATGAAAAGTAGCAGTGCTTTCATGGCCAGGAATTGCACTGCTGCTACTCCTGGGGL812ACTGTGCATGAAAGCACTGGCACTCTTACTGGAATAATGCTGAAGAGTGCCAGTGCAGCATTATTCCAGTCTTTCATGCACAGL813AGCATGAAAGCACTGCTAGCCTTCAGCCCACTGGAATAATGCTGAAGGCTAGCATTATTCCAGTGGAGTGCTTTCATGC Open table in a new tab To test whether key residues of the ERα palmitoylation motif dictated translocation to a palmitoyl acyltransferase, or promoted palmitoylation, we constructed a plasmid with additional membrane targeting sequences. A myristoylation sequence (the first 15 amino acids of p60src, mgsskskpkdpsgrr), was fused to the N terminus of wild-type ERα. A single-stranded oligonucleotide containing the myristoylation sense sequence (5′-gatccatggggagtagcaagagcaag cct aag gac ccc agc cag cgc cgg-3′) was annealed to a complementary antisense sequence, (5′-aattccggcgctggctggggtccttaggcttgctcttgctactcccatg-3′) in 10 mm Tris/50 mm NaCl/1 mm EDTA, at 95 °C for 5 min. The annealed oligonucleotides contained sticky ends for ligation to a BamHI-and EcoRI-digested site at 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. ERα in pcDNA3 was digested with BamHI and EcoRI, gel-purified, and ligated to the double-stranded oligo containing the myristoylation sequence. The resulting vector, Myr-ERα, expressed the myristoylation sequence in frame to wild-type ER. The same method was used to fuse the myristoylation sequence to mutant ER vectors containing amino acid changes, F-A or IL-AA. The constructs were verified by sequencing. In some studies, siRNAs to caveolin-1 or control (GFP) were obtained from Qiagen, cat. no. Si00299635. siRNA, 3 μg in 1 ml of buffer, per 500,000 cells in a single well, was transfected at 0 h with OLIGOfectamine as described (13Pedram A. Razandi M. Levin E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 1996-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), after time course studies showed maximal protein knockdown at 48 h. wtERα was transfected at 24 h, and microscopy of ERα localization in CHO cells was performed at 48 h. For other studies, CHO were transfected and recovered, incubated with 10 μm 2-bromopalmitate for 6 h, followed by 2 h of incubation with steroid. Transcription studies utilized a triple, tandem estrogen response element/luciferase reporter (kindly provided by John Couse/Ken Korach), transiently transfected into CHO cells, with or without the various ERα constructs. Luciferase activity was determined after incubation of the cells with 10 nm E2 for 24 h, as described (16Pedram A. Razandi M. Aitkenhead M. Hughes C.C.W. Levin E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50768-50775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Estradiol-specific Binding—CHO cells were transfected to express wt or mutant ERα, and whole cell binding of 17β-[3H]E2 (1 nm) to equilibrium was carried out in the presence or absence of 100 nm unlabeled E2 (nonspecific binding) (13Pedram A. Razandi M. Levin E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 1996-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Palmitoylation of SRs Expressed in CHO-K1 Cells—CHO-K1 cells were grown on 100-mm-diameter dishes in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/nutrient mixture F12 Ham without phenol red. Twenty-four hours after transfection with wildtype or mutant SRs, the cells were synchronized without serum overnight, then labeled with [3H]palmitic acid (0.5 mCi/ml) for 1 h. 10 nm 17β-E2 or other sex steroids were added for another 4 h, the cells washed, then lysed in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture, and 0.2% Triton X-100). Nuclear pellets were collected by low speed centrifugation (6000 rpm) and solubilized by sonication. Equal amounts of solubilized cell extracts (supernatant and nuclear fractions) were immunoprecipitated for 2 h at 4 °C with antibodies to ERα (MC-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), ERβ (51-7700, directed against the C terminus, Zymed Laboratories Inc.), PR (SC-539, C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or AR (SC-815, C-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) each conjugated to protein A-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitates were washed with lysis buffer, then eluted with 4× Laemmli sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol after boiling for 5 min. Samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, followed by fluorography and autoradiography. Some aliquots underwent counting by β-scintillation. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance plus Schefe’s test, and incorporated counts were normalized per milligram of protein from each condition. To determine whether palmitoylation occurred at internal site(s) via thioester linkage, CHO cells expressing wtERα were incubated with 1 μm unlabeled palmitic acid for 2 h. The cells were washed, then lysed, and ER was immunoprecipitated. The supernatant containing isolated ER was exposed to buffer containing or not containing 1 m hydroxylamine at pH 7.2 for 2 h. Hydroxylamine cleaves thioester linkage of the fatty acyl group to cystine (17Drisdel R.C. Alexander J.K. Sayeed A. Green W.G. Methods. 2006; 40: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The buffers were centrifuged, and the supernatants sent for analysis by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HT Laboratories Inc., San Diego). Kinase Signaling—ERK activity in CHO cells expressing wt or mutant SR was determined at 8 min after exposure to steroid ligand. Activity of immunoprecipitated and protein normalized ERK was directed against the myelin basic protein substrate in an in vitro assay, as described (4Razandi M. Alton G. Pedram A. Ghonshani S. Webb D. Levin E.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 1633-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase activity was determined as phosphorylation of AKT at serine 473 (13Pedram A. Razandi M. Levin E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 1996-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), after 15 min of exposure of the cells to steroid. p38β activity was determined similarly to ERK, immunoprecipitating this kinase from ERβ-expressing cells incubated with/without 10 nm E2 for 30 min. Protein-normalized immunoprecipitates were used in an in vitro assay with the substrate ATF2 protein. p38β antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was also used to immunoblot total p38β protein (for normalization). All studies were repeated. Cell Biology Studies—CHO or HCC-1569 cells (ER/PR/AR-negative breast cancer cells) expressing the various SR constructs were recovered, synchronized overnight in serum and steroid-free medium. Progression from G1 to S phase was reflected by thymidine incorporation (DNA synthesis) in response to steroid ± kinase inhibitors, 10 mm PD98059 (MEK) or 100 nm wortmannin (PI3K), determined at 24 h as described (13Pedram A. Razandi M. Levin E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 1996-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). In some experiments, 2-Br was added prior to assay. Cell viability was separately quantified by the colorimetric MTT assay (Sigma). The conversion of MTT to MTT-formazan crystal by mitochondrial enzymes occurs in viable cells. In brief, CHO cells were transiently transfected with different SR constructs, and recovered for 24 h. Cells were exposed or sham exposed to brief UV radiation (50 J/M2), and incubated in the presence or absence of specific steroid ligands for 24 h. The cells were then washed in medium without phenol red and incubated with medium containing MTT 1 mg/ml for 4 h at 37°C. MTT/formazan was extracted by overnight incubation at 37 °C with 100 ml of extraction buffer. Optical densities at 570 nm were measured using buffer as a blank. The optical density of the control vector alone (sham UV) was converted to 100% viability, and all other densities were normalized to this value as a percent of control. Functional Analysis of Mutated ERα—Many heptahelical G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) contain a conserved F(X6)LL sequence, where X is any amino acid and L is leucine or isoleucine (18Duvernay M.T. Zhou F. Wu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30741-30750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). F, LL, and the precise 6 amino acid spacing between F and LL are required for protein export from the endoplasmic reticulum. Upon sequence mutation, membrane localization of several GPCRs was not found (18Duvernay M.T. Zhou F. Wu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30741-30750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In the E domain of human/mouse ERα proteins, a sequence highly homologous to F(X6)LL is present. In contrast to typical GPCRs, the third amino acid of this motif in ERα is cysteine (amino acid 447 in the human) (Fig. 1A). We expressed wtERα or F445A, C447A, and IL453/454AA mutant ERα in ER-null CHO cells. Wild-type receptor was detected in a discontinuous pattern at the PM in 95% of successfully transfected cells, but no mutant receptors were observed at this location (Fig. 1B and Table 2). Similar results were obtained after expression in ER-null breast cancer cells (data not shown). Whole cell and cytoplasmic ER protein was comparable by immunoblot in wildtype and mutant receptor-expressing cells (Fig. 1D). All receptors comparably localized to the nucleus (Fig. 1D) but each mutant ERα protein was significantly less abundant at the PM. We previously established the purity of our subcellular fractionation approach (4Razandi M. Alton G. Pedram A. Ghonshani S. Webb D. Levin E.R. Mol.

Wt compared with mutant ERα supported rapid and robust ERK activation by E2 (Fig. 1E), and stronger PI3K activation. Specific binding of labeled E2 was similar for wt and mutant ERα (Fig. 1F), and the transcriptional activities of the various ERα constructs were comparable in ERE-luciferase-transfected CHO cells (Fig. 1G). Palmitoylation and Function of Membrane ER—How does this motif promote the PM localization of functional ERα? The cysteine residue has been reported to be a site for palmitoylation, potentially mediating ERα translocation to the PM (5Acconcia F. Ascenzi P. Bocedi A. Spisni E. Tomasi V. Trentalance A. Visca P. Marino M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Here we determined whether cysteine and other amino acids in our identified motif affect ERα lipidation and PM localization/function. Membrane Localization and Signaling—We found that cytoplasmic/membrane wtERα underwent palmitoylation, not influenced by steroid ligand (Fig. 2A). Importantly, wtERα in the nucleus did not show this acylation. This supports the idea that palmitoylation drives the SR specifically to the PM. Furthermore, virtually no palmitoylation of the cysteine mutant receptor was detected in this cell fraction. Thus, Cys447 is apparently the only palmitoylation site in ERα. Scant lipidation occurred in cells expressing the F or IL mutants (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2Palmitoylation of ERα. A, CHO cells transfected with wt or mutant ER constructs were labeled with [3H]palmitate.

Christophersen B.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 917: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This compound prevents wtER palmitoylation (Fig. 2A, lane 5), the membrane localization of expressed wtERα (Fig. 1B), and the localization of endogenous ERα to the PM in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1C). 2-Br also dampened E2-induced ERK and PI 3-kinase activities via endogenous membrane ER in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 2B), or ERK in CHO-wtERα cells (Fig. 2C). Palmitoylation is the co- or post-translational attachment of palmitic acid to a cysteine, promoted by a palmitoyl acyltransferase enzyme (PAT) (6Basu J. Curr. Sci. 2004; 87: 212-217Google Scholar). This most often occurs in the N-terminal region of membrane-bound signaling molecules by amide linkage. However, internal cysteine residues can be reversibly S-palmitoylated via thioester linkage. To support the idea that palmitoylation occurred by thioester bonding of palmitic acid to the designated cystine, a plasmid encoding a GFP-wtERα fusion protein was expressed in CHO cells, incubated with 3H-labeled or unlabeled palmitic acid, then immunoprecipitated from the cells. Isolated GFP-ER was then incubated in buffer with or without hydroxylamine. Hydroxylamine cleaves thioester bonding of fatty acyl groups (17Drisdel R.C. Alexander J.K. Sayeed A. Green W.G. Methods. 2006; 40: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Here, hydroxylamine blocked palmitoylation of ERα (Fig. 2D, left) and liberated palmitic acid (right). The latter was identified by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry as a 256 Da peak, compatible with palmitic acid. This was found released in the buffer from hydroxylamine-treated ER but not in the control buffer (latter not shown). Next, we determined cell transition through G1 to S phase of the cell cycle. Compared with wtERα, each mutant receptor resulted in ∼50% less E2-stimulated thymidine incorporation (TI) (Fig. 2E). 2-Br also significantly but incompletely blocked the ability of wtERα to support this action. 2-Br further decreased E2-induced TI when the palmitoylation inhibitor was combined with F449A mutant expression, perhaps further impairing palmitoylation. Finally, wtERα-induced TI was significantly but partially prevented by inhibitors of MEK (PD98059) or PI3 kinase (wortmannin) (Fig. 2F). Thus, membrane localization of palmitoylated ERα leads to signal transduction that contributes to cell cycle progression. Palmitoylation Facilitates ER Association with Caveolin-1—We previously showed that membrane translocation of ERα requires the physical association of the steroid receptor with caveolin-1 protein, mediated in part through serine 522 of ERα (4Razandi M. Alton G. Pedram A. Ghonshani S. Webb D. Levin E.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 1633-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Further, the scaffolding domain of caveo-lin-1 (amino acids 80–100) was necessary for the membrane localization of both caveolin and ER. We asked whether palmitoylation promotes caveolin-1/ER association, leading to membrane transport. CHO cells contain endogenous caveolin-1 but lack ER. Transfection of wtERα led to membrane ERα association with caveolin-1, this aspect promoted by E2 (Fig. 3A). This was substantially diminished from expression of each mutant receptor (top), and wtERα association with caveolin-1 was inhibited by 2-Br (Fig. 3A, bottom). This protein-protein interaction was important to membrane localization because knockdown of caveolin-1 with siRNA prevented wtERα localization at the membrane (Fig. 3B). Is the identified 9 amino acid motif in ERα sufficient to dictate membrane localization? To address this issue, we attached the E domain motif to a protein that normally does not translocate to the membrane. We cloned the ERα motif C terminus to green fluorescent protein in the pEGFP-C2 plasmid. Transfection of the parent vector, pEGFP-C2, resulted in diffuse cellular fluorescence in CHO cells (Fig. 3C). In contrast, expression of the fusion protein resulted in membrane localization, although a weaker fluorescent intensity was seen. The fusion protein was palmitoylated, and this was reversed by treatment of the precipitated protein with hydroxylamine (Fig. 3D). Thus, the 9 amino acid sequence bestows protein localization at the membrane and palmitoylation. The F and IL amino acids in the E domain motif might localize steroid receptors to the modifying PAT in a subcellular partition, and/or promote the physical interaction of the enzyme(s) with the SRs. To investigate this, we cloned a myristoylation sequence from Src to wt, F445A, and IL453/454AA mutant ERα. wtERα without the myristoylation fusion sequence was expressed in CHO cells and revealed predominantly a nuclear distribution, with cytoplasmic and membrane localization also seen (data not shown). In contrast, wt and mutant ERα containing the myristoylation sequence localized only at the cytoplasmic/membrane interface (Fig. 3E). wtER but not mutant ER underwent palmitoylation despite myristolate-induced membrane localization of all constructs. This suggests that the amino acids flanking cystine facilitate the physical and functional interaction of ERα with a palmitoyl acyltransferase. Analysis of Other SRs—ERβ contains a comparable 9 amino acid motif except that tyrosine is present rather than phenylalanine at 416 in the native protein (Fig. 1A). Expressed wtERβ localized to the cell membrane in 93% of transfected cells, not seen with the mutant forms (Fig. 4A and Table 2). All mutations, especially at cysteine 418, impaired cytoplasmic/membrane ERβ palmitoylation (Fig. 4B). As with ERα, wild-type nuclear ERβ was not palmito"

Protein substrates are known for eight of the nine subtilisinlike serine proteinases. Cleavage of the substrates generally results in the production of mature bioactive proteins as well as processing intermediates or, occasionally, the inactivation of the cleaved protein (12Seidah N.G. Khatib A.M. Prat A. Biol. Chem. 2006; 387: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The only subtilisin-like serine proteinase without an identified protein substrate is PCSK9. Like the other PCs, PCSK9 is synthesized as an inactive proenzyme and contains a triad of residues (Asp186, His226, and Ser386) that are required for catalytic activity (3Seidah N.G. Benjannet S.

Much attention has been focused on the biological role and potential substrates of PCSK9 since the discovery that gain-of-function mutations in PCSK9 cause an autosomal dominant form of familial hypercholesterolemia (15Abifadel M.

Conversely, humans with loss-of-function mutations in PCSK9 have lower plasma LDL cholesterol levels, and PCSK9 knock-out mice have increased LDLR protein expression in liver (19Cohen J.

The genetic data from humans and the in vivo studies in mice demonstrate that PCSK9 reduces the number of the LDLRs; however, the mechanism by which PCSK9 carries out this function is only partially known. Evidence is consistent with the secreted form of PCSK9 binding directly to the LDLR and resulting in degradation of the receptor (13Lagace T.A. Curtis D.E. Garuti R. McNutt M.C. Park S.W.

For the secreted form of PCSK9 to destroy LDLRs, the PCSK9-LDLR complex must be internalized into endosomal/lysosomal compartments (13Lagace T.A. Curtis D.E. Garuti R. McNutt M.C. Park S.W. Prather H.B. Anderson N.N. Ho Y.K. Hammer R.E. Horton J.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 2995-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Although binding and internalization of PCSK9 and the LDLR are required for PCSK9 to promote degradation of the receptor, it is not known whether PCSK9 acts catalytically in the process to cleave either the LDLR or an accessory protein that affects LDLR stability. Inactivation of the catalytic activity using routine mutagenesis results in either PCSK9 remaining sequestered in the ER or in improper folding of the protein. Therefore, we have addressed this question by expressing the prodomain and an inactive catalytic domain in trans in cells and purifying the resultant recombinant protein complex from the medium. Using this reagent we provide evidence that PCSK9 catalytic activity is not required for PCSK9 to bind and degrade LDLRs in cultured human hepatoma HepG2 cells. Construction of Trans and Mutant PCSK9 Expression Vectors— Details of plasmid construction are in the supplemental material. Transient and Stable Transfection of Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) 293 Cells with PCSK9 Mutants—HEK 293 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen). For stable lines expressing trans-PCSK9, HEK 293S cells (23Reeves P.J. Thurmond R.L. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Additional details of the transfections are in the supplemental material. Antibodies and Immunoblot Analysis—Monoclonal antibody 3C12 (IgG subclass 1) resulted from immunization with full-length human PCSK9 (24Zhao Z. Tuakli-Wosornu Y. Lagace T.A. Kinch L. Grishin N.V.

Recombinant human PCSK9 prodomain purified from Escherichia coli was used to produce monoclonal antibody 1A1 (IgG subclass 2a). Both antibodies recognize epitopes in the prodomain of PCSK9. Additional antibodies used are in the supplemental material. PCSK9 Activity Assays—HepG2 cells were incubated with PCSK9 and proteins prepared as described (13Lagace T.A. Curtis D.E. Garuti R. McNutt M.C. Park S.W. Prather H.B. Anderson N.N. Ho Y.K. Hammer R.E. Horton J.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 2995-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Ligand blotting of purified human LDLR was performed as described (13Lagace T.A. Curtis D.E. Garuti R. McNutt M.C. Park S.W. Prather H.B. Anderson N.N. Ho Y.K. Hammer R.E. Horton J.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 2995-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar) using the buffer described in the supplemental material. Among the PC family of mammalian serine proteases, autocatalytic cleavage of the prodomain is required for entry into the secretory pathway. Accordingly, mutating the conserved serine (Ser386) of the catalytic triad in PCSK9 prevents autocatalytic cleavage resulting in retention of the protein within the ER (8Naureckiene S. Ma L. Sreekumar K. Purandare U. Lo C.F. Huang Y. Chiang L.W. Grenier J.M. Ozenberger B.A. Jacobsen J.S. Kennedy J.D. DiStefano P.S. Wood A. Bingham B. Arch. Biochem.

Chem. 2004; 279: 50630-50638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). To determine whether catalytic activity is required for exogenous PCSK9 to destroy LDLRs, an alternative strategy was employed to obtain secreted catalytically inactive PCSK9. An expression plasmid was constructed that contained the signal peptide and prodomain of PCSK9 followed by a V5 epitope tag. A second expression plasmid was constructed that contained the signal sequence, catalytic, and C-terminal portions of PCSK9 followed by a FLAG tag. The two plasmids were co-transfected into HEK 293 cells to determine whether the PCSK9 fragments expressed in trans could associate and be secreted from the cell. As shown in Fig. 1A, the prodomain and catalytic fragments were similarly expressed in the transfected cells (lanes 3–5); however, secretion of either peptide only occurred when both fragments were co-expressed (lane 10). The ability to purify PCSK9 by co-expressing the prodomain and catalytic fragment of PCSK9 now provided a means to mutate key amino acid residues of the catalytic triad to determine whether catalytic activity was required for PCSK9 activity. An HEK 293S cell line was subsequently established that stably expressed the “trans-PCSK9” or a trans-PCSK9 protein containing an alanine substituted for the serine at position 386 (S386A) of the catalytic triad. This amino acid change abolishes the autocatalytic cleavage of PCSK9 (3Seidah N.G. Benjannet S. Wickham L. Marcinkiewicz J. Jasmin S.B. Stifani S. Basak A. Prat A. Chretien M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 928-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar, 17Park S.W. Moon Y-A. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50630-50638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). From these cell lines, large amounts of the recombinant purified protein could be obtained to characterize their binding properties and test for activity. Secreted trans-PCSK9 proteins were purified using the FLAG epitope as previously described (13Lagace T.A. Curtis D.E. Garuti R. McNutt M.C. Park S.W. Prather H.B. Anderson N.N. Ho Y.K. Hammer R.E. Horton J.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 2995-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Fig. 1B shows that the catalytic fragment and prodomain co-purify with both proteins expressed in trans, indicating the two fragments interact and are secreted together in a manner similar to that of the wild-type PCSK9 purified from HEK 293S cells stably transfected with a single plasmid encoding the full-length PCSK9 protein. The alanine to serine change at position 386 of the purified protein was confirmed by sequencing using mass spectrometry (data not shown). Further evidence that the S386A mutation produces a catalytically inactive protein was gained from the immunoblot data using an antibody that recognizes the V5 tag present at the C terminus of the prodomain. Immunoblot of purified PCSK9 or trans-PCSK9 using an anti-V5 or anti-PCSK9 prodomain antibody revealed that only the trans-PCSK9(S386A) retained the V5 tag (Fig. 1C). This indicates that the wild-type trans-PCSK9 could cleave the V5 tag from the prodomain and the trans-PCSK9(S386A) could not. The sequence of the cleavage site in trans-PCSK9 (VFAQ152↓GKP) was verified by mass spectrometry and was found to occur at the same residue at which the prodomain is normally cleaved from full-length PCSK9 (VFAQ152↓SIP). We first determined whether the secreted recombinant trans-PCSK9 proteins could bind to the LDLR by ligand blotting using purified LDLR protein. Fig. 1D shows that the purified trans-PCSK9 and trans-PCSK9(S386A) proteins bound the LDLR with affinities similar to that measured with purified PCSK9 protein derived from a single plasmid encoding the full-length protein. We next tested whether catalytic activity was required for PCSK9 to degrade LDLRs when added to the medium of HepG2 cells cultured in sterol-depleted medium to induce LDLR expression (13Lagace T.A. Curtis D.E. Garuti R. McNutt M.C. Park S.W. Prather H.B. Anderson N.N. Ho Y.K. Hammer R.E. Horton J.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 2995-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). After incubation with purified PCSK9, the surface proteins of the cells were covalently modified with a cell-impermeable biotinylation reagent and then isolated using streptavidin beads. Total cellular LDLRs in whole-cell extracts and cell surface LDLRs were measured by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (13Lagace T.A. Curtis D.E. Garuti R. McNutt M.C. Park S.W. Prather H.B. Anderson N.N. Ho Y.K. Hammer R.E. Horton J.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 2995-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The amounts of whole-cell and cell surface PCSK9 were also measured by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using an anti-FLAG antibody that detected only exogenously added PCSK9. Fig. 2 shows that PCSK9 purified from the full-length plasmid (PCSK9), trans-PCSK9, and trans-PCSK9(S386A) had nearly identical potencies in reducing the number of LDLRs on the cell surface at all concentrations tested without affecting another cell surface receptor, the transferrin receptor (compare lanes 6–10 in Fig. 2, A–C). FLAG-tagged PCSK9 was detected in whole-cell extracts in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2, A–C, lanes 2–5) but was not detected among the biotin-labeled cell surface proteins (lanes 7–10), suggesting that most of the cell-associated PCSK9 had been internalized. Of note, catalytically inactive PCSK9 functioned to degrade LDLRs at 0.5 μg/ml, a concentration similar to that found in human plasma (Fig. 2C, lane 7) (13Lagace T.A. Curtis D.E. Garuti R. McNutt M.C. Park S.W. Prather H.B. Anderson N.N. Ho Y.K. Hammer R.E. Horton J.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 2995-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). These results indicate that catalytic activity of PCSK9 is not required to degrade LDLRs when PCSK9 is added exogenously to HepG2 cells. Previously, point mutations in human PCSK9 were identified that resulted in a gain-of-function and hypercholesterolemia (15Abifadel M. Varret M. Rabes J-P. Ouguerram K. Devillers M. Cruaud C. Benjannet S. Wickham L. Erlich D. Villéger L. Farnier M. Beucler I. Bruckert E. Chambaz J. Chanu B. Lecerf J.-M. Luc G. Moulin P. Weissenbach J. Prat A. Krempf M. Junien C. Seidah N.G. Boileau C. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 154-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (2221) Google Scholar). One gain-of-function PCSK9 mutation, PCSK9(D374Y), binds to the LDLR with ∼25-fold greater affinity and is ∼10-fold more active in reducing LDLRs than the wild-type protein (13Lagace T.A. Curtis D.E. Garuti R. McNutt M.C. Park S.W. Prather H.B. Anderson N.N. Ho Y.K. Hammer R.E. Horton J.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 2995-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 14Cunningham D. Danley D.E. Geoghegan K.F. Griffor M.C. Hawkins J.L. Subashi T.A. Varghese A.H. Ammirati M.J. Culp J.S. Hoth L.R. Mansour M.N. McGrath K.M. Seddon A.P. Shenolikar S. Stutzman-Engwall K.J. Warren L.C. Xia D. Qiu X. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). If the hypothesis that binding of PCSK9 to LDLR, but not catalytic activity, is required for PCSK9 to degrade the LDLR is correct, then the introduction of the D374Y mutation into the catalytically inactive PCSK9(S386A) should still confer increased binding and enhanced degradation capacity. To test this possibility, an HEK 293S cell line was established that stably expressed PCSK9 in trans and that contained both the D374Y and S386A mutations in the catalytic fragment (trans-PCSK9(D374Y-S386A)). The binding of the trans-PCSK9(D374Y-S386A) was first evaluated by ligand blotting (Fig. 3A). The affinity of trans-PCSK9(D374Y-S386A) for the LDLR was similar to that of the D374Y protein, both of which had an apparent higher affinity for LDLR than the wild-type PCSK9 protein. When added to the medium of HepG2 cells at one-tenth the concentration of wild-type PCSK9, the trans-PCSK9(D374Y-S386A) and the PCSK9(D374Y) proteins were able to degrade the LDLRs on the cell surface (Fig. 3, C and D, lanes 7–10). These data further support the conclusion that the binding of PCSK9 to the LDLR facilitates the degradation of the LDLR through a mechanism that does not require proteolytic activity of PCSK9. In this report, we demonstrate that introducing a mutation in PCSK9 that abolishes catalytic activity but does not interfere with the secretion of the protein failed to alter the mutant protein's ability to bind to the LDLR or to mediate the destruction of LDLRs when added to the medium of cultured HepG2 cells. These results support a model in which exogenous PCSK9 binds to the LDLR, which then either targets the LDLR to the lysosome for degradation or prevents the recycling of the receptor in a manner that is independent of inherent catalytic activity of the protein. These data indicate that unlike other PCs, PCSK9 is unique as a subtilisin-like serine protease in that the protein carries out a biological function that is independent of its proteolytic activity. Studies have demonstrated that PCSK9 and the LDLR interact directly and that the association of PCSK9 with the cell surface and its subsequent internalization is dependent upon the presence of LDLRs (13Lagace T.A. Curtis D.E. Garuti R. McNutt M.C. Park S.W. Prather H.B. Anderson N.N. Ho Y.K. Hammer R.E. Horton J.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 2995-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 22Zhang D.W.

In addition, both proteins colocalize to a late endocytic/lysosomal compartment, and internalization is required for PCSK9 to reduce LDLR protein levels because this activity is blocked in the absence of autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia (ARH), an endocytic adaptor protein required in hepatocytes for LDLR internalization in clathrin-coated pits (13Lagace T.A. Curtis D.E. Garuti R. McNutt M.C. Park S.W. Prather H.B. Anderson N.N. Ho Y.K. Hammer R.E. Horton J.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 2995-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 22Zhang D.W.

Inasmuch as PCSK9 is a member of the proteinase K subfamily of subtilisin-related serine endo-proteases, it seemed likely that PCSK9 cleaved the LDLR, which then facilitated degradation. A second possibility was that PCSK9 cleaved another as yet unidentified protein that ultimately mediated the destruction of LDLRs. The data of Fig. 2 indicate that catalytic activity is not required for PCSK9 to mediate the destruction of LDLRs when added exogenously to HepG2 cells. The data of Fig. 3 further support the conclusion that binding of PCSK9 to the LDLR is sufficient to target LDLRs for degradation, because inactivating the catalytic site in the hyperactive protein PCSK9(D374Y) did not change the ∼10-fold higher specific activity of the protein (13Lagace T.A. Curtis D.E. Garuti R. McNutt M.C. Park S.W. Prather H.B. Anderson N.N. Ho Y.K. Hammer R.E. Horton J.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 2995-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). These data also support the conclusion that the gain-of-function of PCSK9(D374Y) is a result of its increased affinity for the LDLR. Previous studies have suggested that cleavage of PCSK9 is required for the protein to be secreted from cells (9Benjannet S. Rhainds D. Essalmani R. Mayne J. Wickham L. Jin W. Asselin M.C. Hamelin J. Varret M. Allard D. Trillard M. Abifadel M. Tebon A. Attie A.D. Rader D.J. Boileau C. Brissette L. Chretien M. Prat A. Seidah N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48865-48875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). We have found that if catalytically inactive mutants are highly overexpressed, a significant amount of unprocessed PCSK9 is secreted into the medium. The secreted full-length but catalytically inactive protein was purified and tested in vitro as described in Figs. 1 and 2; however, the uncleaved PCSK9 protein did not bind to the LDLR nor did it reduce LDLRs in HepG2 cells (data not shown). Thus, cleavage of the prodomain may be required for PCSK9 to adopt a conformation that mediates LDLR binding. The data of Fig. 1 demonstrates that the PCSK9 prodomain is capable of performing a chaperone function in trans, as evidenced by the ER exit and secretion of trans-PCSK9 and the uncompromised ability of the protein to bind to the LDLR. Previously, it has been shown that mature, active furin can be formed in monkey kidney BSC-40 cells by the co-expression of the furin prodomain and a furin fragment lacking the prodomain on separate plasmids (11Anderson E.D. Molloy S.S. Jean F. Fei H. Shimamura S. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12879-12890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In the case of PCSK9, the ability of the prodomain to function in trans allowed for studies of the effect of catalytic function on LDLR degradation independent of effects on PCSK9 trafficking in the secretory pathway. The crystal structure of PCSK9 was recently solved at 2.0-Å resolution (14Cunningham D. Danley D.E. Geoghegan K.F. Griffor M.C. Hawkins J.L. Subashi T.A. Varghese A.H. Ammirati M.J. Culp J.S. Hoth L.R. Mansour M.N. McGrath K.M. Seddon A.P. Shenolikar S. Stutzman-Engwall K.J. Warren L.C. Xia D. Qiu X. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The prodomain failed to contain an apparent target loop that is found in the prodomains of other proprotein convertases and typically is the site of a second cleavage event that results in exposure and activation of the protease. The absence of a target loop in the prodomain of PCSK9 has been interpreted as evidence that catalytic activity may not be involved in the LDLR-lowering function of PCSK9 (14Cunningham D. Danley D.E. Geoghegan K.F. Griffor M.C. Hawkins J.L. Subashi T.A. Varghese A.H. Ammirati M.J. Culp J.S. Hoth L.R. Mansour M.N. McGrath K.M. Seddon A.P. Shenolikar S. Stutzman-Engwall K.J. Warren L.C. Xia D. Qiu X. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The current studies provide direct experimental evidence that exogenously added PCSK9 reduces LDLRs in a manner that requires LDLR binding but not catalytic activity. Studies by Maxwell et al. (25Maxwell K.N. Fisher E.A. Breslow J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2069-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) showed that overexpression of PCSK9 in HepG2 cells induces degradation of LDLRs intracellularly in a post-ER compartment, and Nassoury et al. (26Nassoury N. Blasiole D.A. Tebon Oler A. Benjannet S. Hamelin J. Poupon V. McPherson P.S. Attie A.D. Prat A. Seidah N.G. Traffic. 2007; 8: 718-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) have suggested that the two proteins interact in the ER and co-localize in the Golgi apparatus in hepatocytes. The results of our studies do not preclude the possibility that PCSK9 can function intracellularly in a manner that requires catalytic activity. Previously, Cohen et al. (19Cohen J. Pertsemlidis A. Kotowski I.K. Graham R. Garcia C.K. Hobbs H.H. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar) reported that one of every 50 African-Americans inherits a nonsense mutation in PCSK9 that lowers LDL cholesterol levels by ∼40%. In a 15-year prospective study, non-sense mutations in PCSK9 reduced LDL cholesterol levels by 28%, which was associated with a reduction in the frequency of coronary heart disease of 88% in African-Americans (27Cohen J.C. Boerwinkle E. Moseley T.H. Hobbs H.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 2006; 354: 1264-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2466) Google Scholar). In addition, individuals that carry these cholesterol-lowering loss-of-function mutations in PCSK9 appear to have a normal life span (27Cohen J.C. Boerwinkle E. Moseley T.H. Hobbs H.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 2006; 354: 1264-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2466) Google Scholar). Thus, genetic data from humans with loss-of-function mutations in PCSK9 validate PCSK9 as a potential target for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and suggest that inhibitors of the protease would be of therapeutic benefit. The lack of a requirement for PCSK9 catalytic activity in reducing LDLRs has important implications for the development of PCSK9 inhibitors. It has been shown previously that LDLR levels do not change when a catalytically dead enzyme that is not secreted is expressed in liver (17Park S.W. Moon Y-A. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50630-50638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) or in cultured liver cells (28). Thus, the current data now suggest that inhibitors of PCSK9 catalytic activity will have to function intracellularly in the ER to block PCSK9 secretion and, hence, its ability to reduce LDLR protein levels.

These features dictate the exquisite substrate specificity of LSD1 and provide a structural framework to explain the fine tuning of its catalytic activity and the active role of CoREST in substrate recognition. Lysine methylation is among the most well characterized histone modifications, and its existence has been known since the early days of chromatin research (1Sims III, R.J. Nishioka K. Reinberg D.

Cell. 2007; 128: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8092) Google Scholar). This type of epigenetic mark provides a huge potential for functional responses in that it can occur in different forms (mono-, di-, and tri-methylation) and on different histone sites, each having a specific physiological meaning. Histone methylation has been long thought to be a low turnover epigenetic mark, but the recent discovery of histone demethylases (3Shi Y. Lan F. Matson C. Mulligan P. Whetstine J.R. Cole P.A.

FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2203-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) has challenged this view by demonstrating that histone lysine methylation can be actively and dynamically regulated. Two classes of histone demethylases have been uncovered; the enzymes of the JmjC family use iron as cofactor, whereas lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) 4The abbreviations used are: LSD1, lysine-specific demethylase 1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PDB, Protein Data Bank. employs FAD as the prosthetic group (5Klose R.J.

LSD1 catalyzes the oxidative demethylation of mono- and dimethyl Lys4 of histone H3, generating hydrogen peroxide and formaldehyde (3Shi Y. Lan F. Matson C. Mulligan P. Whetstine J.R. Cole P.A.

FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2203-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The enzyme is implicated as a key component of distinct co-activator and co-repressor complexes in a surprisingly wide range of cellular processes where it participates in the dynamic transition of transcriptional programs (6Wang J. Scully K. Zhu X. Cai L. Zhang J. Prefontaine G.G. Krones A. Ohgi K.A. Zhu P. Garcia-Bassets I. Liu F. Taylor H. Lozach J. Jayes F.L. Korach K.S. Glass C.K. Fu X.D. Rosenfeld M.G.

Cell. 2006; 23: 377-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) have revealed that the catalytic center is located in the core of the enzyme main body. A protruding tower domain consisting of two remarkably long helices forms the docking site for the co-repressor protein (Fig. 1A). Here, we describe the structural analysis of LSD1-CoREST bound to a 21-amino acid H3 peptide in which pLys4 (“p” is for peptide) is mutated to Met. The structural analysis illuminates the molecular properties that enable LSD1 to function as a key transcriptional regulator through both its histone demethylase activity and its highly specific binding to the H3 N-terminal tail. Protein Purification—Escherichia coli cells overproducing the GST-fused LSD1-binding domain of CoREST (residues 305–482) were harvested 8 h after the addition of 0.25 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells (10 g) were disrupted with an Emulsiflex C3 cell disruptor and the extract loaded onto a Glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (GE Healthcare) followed by extensive washing with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.2, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA. GST-tag cleavage was performed by incubating the column-bound protein with 80 units of Prescission protease (GE Healthcare) overnight at 4 °C. Next, the eluted protein was gel-filtered using a Superdex 200 column equilibrated in 5% (w/v) glycerol, 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2. Human recombinant LSD1 was expressed and purified following published protocols (7Forneris F. Binda C. Vanoni M.A. Battaglioli. E. Mattevi A. J. Biol.

The protein lacks the N-terminal 122 amino acids (with reference to the sequence deposited in the NCBI data base under accession code NP_055828). Purified CoREST was mixed with LSD1 in a 1.5:1 molar ratio for 1 h and gel-filtered on a Superdex 200 column equilibrated in 5% (w/v) glycerol, 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2. The elution peak had the retention volume expected for the CoREST-LSD1 complex, the formation of which was further verified by SDS-PAGE analysis.

The structure of the ternary complex was obtained using a peptide bearing Met in place of Lys in position 4. With respect to the wild-type peptide (Ki = 1.8 μm) (7Forneris F. Binda C. Vanoni M.A. Battaglioli. E. Mattevi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41360-41365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), such a mutation led to a 30-fold increase in binding affinity (Ki = 0.05 μm), making the pLys4Met substrate analogue a strong inhibitor and an ideal candidate for structural studies (Table 1). The electron density map allowed us to unambiguously position the 16 N-terminal amino acids of the ligand (Fig. 1B). Peptide binding does not induce any conformational change, as indicated by the root-mean-square deviation of 0.4 Å from ligand-free LSD1-CoREST (799 equivalent Cα atoms). The peptide binds in a funnel-shaped pocket (Figs. 1A and 2A) adopting a folded conformation in which three structural elements can be identified: a helical turn (residues 1–5) located in front of the flavin, a sharp bent (residues 6–9), and a more extended stretch (residues 10–16) that remains partially solvent-exposed on the rim of the binding pocket (Fig. 2A). All amino acids fall in the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot and therefore do not appear to adopt strained conformations. The core of the peptide structure is formed by pArg2, pGln5, and pSer10, which are engaged in several intramolecular interactions (Fig. 2, B and C). The side chain of pArg2 is crucial in that it establishes H-bonds with the carbonyl oxygens of pGly12 and pGly13 and the side chain of pSer10. Moreover, all peptide residues define an intricate network of very specific intermolecular contacts with LSD1, often involving electrostatic interactions (Fig. 2). Among these, the N-terminal amino group of pAla1 favorably interacts with the C terminus of helix 524–540 (Figs. 1A and 2C), whereas the pArg2 and pArg8 form salt bridges with the carboxylate groups of, Asp375, Asp553, Asp556, and Glu379. The side chains of pLys9 and pLys14 are partially disordered, pointing toward the solvent (Fig. 2A). However, they both can establish favorable electrostatic interactions with a cluster of negatively charged residues on the LSD1 surface that involve Asp553, Asp556, Asp557, and Glu559 (Fig. 2A). The three-dimensional structure of the ternary complex explains several biological properties of LSD1. The peptide residue in position 4 binds right in front of the cofactor, with the side chain pointing toward the flavin ring of FAD (Fig. 2B). This residue is made solvent-inaccessible by the peptide C-terminal portion that effectively seals the active center. A modeling analysis (Fig. 2D) in which pMet4 is replaced by dimethyl Lys shows that the dimethyl group can be easily accommodated in the space between the peptide and the flavin. The predicted position of the pLys4-N–CH3 group (the site of oxidative demethylation) is at about 3 Å distance from the reactive N-5 atom of the flavin, and the geometry of the flavin-methylamino group interactions is identical to those of the flavodehydrogenases-oxidases (19Fraaije M.W. Mattevi A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 126-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). In particular, the methylamino group of the substrate is fixed in position through the interaction with an aromatic side chain (Tyr761; Fig. 2, B and D) as typically found in other flavin-dependent amine oxidases. Thus, the structure is fully compatible with the proposed oxidative mechanism for demethylation that involves flavin-mediated oxidation of the N–CH3 group of methyl-Lys4. An astonishing feature is the intricacy of the interactions between LSD1 and the histone peptide, which is consistent with the exquisite specificity of the enzyme (Fig. 2). LSD1 is not active toward peptides shorter than 16 amino acids, and optimal activity is detected with peptides comprising the N-terminal 21 amino acids of H3 (7Forneris F. Binda C. Vanoni M.A. Battaglioli. E. Mattevi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41360-41365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Consistently, the structure shows that the first 16 amino acids of the H3 peptide all specifically interact with the protein. After pPro16, the electron density is too poorly defined to allow model building (Fig. 1B). We speculate that the flexibility of amino acids 17–21 may be required to allow the tail to protrude from the nucleosomal particle to reach the binding pocket. The complexity of the peptide-enzyme interactions rationalizes the ability of LSD1 to recognize epigenetic modifications on H3. pSer10 is solvent-inaccessible, being part of the intramolecular interactions that stabilize the peptide conformation. Phosphorylation of this residue is predicted to disrupt this binding geometry in keeping with the fact that pSer10-phosphorylated peptides are unable to bind to LSD1 (7Forneris F. Binda C. Vanoni M.A. Battaglioli. E. Mattevi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41360-41365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Likewise, both pArg2 and pArg8 side chains establish several inter- and intramolecular H-bonds, explaining the reduced binding affinity caused by arginine methylation (20Forneris F. Binda C. Dall'Aglio A. Fraaije M.W. Battaglioli E. Mattevi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35289-35295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). pLys9 and pLys14 are solvent-accessible and close to a cluster of negatively charged residues on the LSD1 surface (Fig. 2a). Indeed, methylation of pLys9 (that preserves the side chain positive charge) does not affect the normal kinetic parameters and, therefore, is not expected to perturb the peptide binding (7Forneris F. Binda C. Vanoni M.A. Battaglioli. E. Mattevi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41360-41365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Conversely, lysine acetylation with consequent removal of the positive charge is predicted to diminish the favorable interaction with the surrounding negatively charged protein environment, accounting for the 6-fold increase in Km caused by pLys9 acetylation and the lack of LSD1 activity on hyperacetylated peptides and nucleosomes (9Shi Y. Matson C. Lan F. Iwase S. Baba T. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 1-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 20Forneris F. Binda C. Dall'Aglio A. Fraaije M.W. Battaglioli E. Mattevi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35289-35295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Taken together, these structural data explain the unique combination of specificity and affinity of LSD1 for deacetylated/dephosphorylated H3 that enables the enzyme to demethylate Lys4 and to have non-enzymatic functions in the recruitment of other chromatin-modifying proteins and protein complexes (6Wang J.

The co-repressor protein CoREST is necessary to make LSD1 able to act on intact nucleosomal particles (8Lee M.G. Wynder C. Cooch N. Shiekhattar R. Nature. 2005; 437: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Moreover, CoREST-bound LSD1 exhibits a 2-fold increase in the rate of catalysis measured with peptide substrate (Table 1). The three-dimensional structure offers a clue to understanding these functional properties, indicating that the co-repressor indirectly takes part in substrate binding (Fig. 2, A and C). In particular, residues 14–16 of the histone peptide are in contact with helix 372–395 (Figs. 1A and 2A) of LSD1, which in turn extensively interacts with CoREST. The shortest distance between a CoREST residue and the peptide is 7.2 Å (Pro311–pGly13). These structural features combined with the functional data suggest that CoREST may have a dual role in optimizing LSD1 activity; it contributes to the overall architecture of the peptide-binding site and is very likely to interact physically with the nucleosomal particles, thus facilitating their recognition by LSD1.

https://openalex.org/W2118611619,"Selenium (Se), a micronutrient essential for human health, is incorporated into at least 25 selenoproteins including selenoprotein P (SePP), which transports Se within the body. This research identified two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the SePP gene, one in the coding region (position 24731, causing an Ala to Thr change) and one in the 3'untranslated region (position 25191). Their frequency was similar in Caucasian, Chinese, and South Asian populations. Prospectively genotyped volunteers were supplemented for 6 wk with 100 microg sodium selenite/day. Blood samples were analyzed for plasma Se and selenoprotein biomarkers at baseline, after supplementation, and during a washout period. Plasma Se, SePP, and glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPx3) levels increased with supplementation. Baseline plasma Se content depended on both SePP genotypes and body mass index. Presupplementation SePP concentration was associated with gender and genotype at SNP 24731 and postsupplementation concentration with SNP 25191. Both SNPs and gender were associated with differences in GPx3 activity, plasma, and erythrocyte thioredoxin reductase 1 concentrations and lymphocyte glutathione peroxidase 1 and 4 activities and concentrations. In conclusion, the data reveal two common functional SNPs within the human SePP gene that may predict behavior of biomarkers of Se status and response to supplementation and thus susceptibility to disease."
https://openalex.org/W2159322879,"Previous research has reported that a functional polymorphism in the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene promoter can moderate the association between early life adversity and increased risk for violence and antisocial behavior. In this study of a combined population of psychiatric outpatients and healthy volunteers (N = 235), we tested the hypothesis that MAOA genotype moderates the association between early traumatic life events (ETLE) experienced during the first 15 years of life and the display of physical aggression during adulthood, as assessed by the Aggression Questionnaire. An ANOVA model including gender, exposure to early trauma, and MAOA genotype as between-subjects factors showed significant MAOAxETLE (F(1,227) = 8.20, P = 0.005) and genderxMAOAxETLE (F(1,227) = 7.04, P = 0.009) interaction effects. Physical aggression scores were higher in men who had experienced early traumatic life events and who carried the low MAOA activity allele (MAOA-L). We repeated the analysis in the subgroup of healthy volunteers (N = 145) to exclude that the observed GxE interactions were due to the inclusion of psychiatric patients in our sample and were not generalizable to the population at large. The results for the subgroup of healthy volunteers were identical to those for the entire sample. The cumulative variance in the physical aggression score explained by the ANOVA effects involving the MAOA polymorphism was 6.6% in the entire sample and 12.1% in the sub-sample of healthy volunteers. Our results support the hypothesis that, when combined with exposure to early traumatic life events, low MAOA activity is a significant risk factor for aggressive behavior during adulthood and suggest that the use of dimensional measures focusing on behavioral aspects of aggression may increase the likelihood of detecting significant gene-by-environment interactions in studies of MAOA-related aggression."
https://openalex.org/W2124838135,"Aeration of the lung and the transition to air-breathing at birth is fundamental to mammalian life and initiates major changes in cardiopulmonary physiology. However, the dynamics of this process and the factors involved are largely unknown, because it has not been possible to observe or measure lung aeration on a breath-by-breath basis. We have used the high contrast and spatial resolution of phase contrast X-ray imaging to study lung aeration at birth in spontaneously breathing neonatal rabbits. As the liquid-filled fetal lungs provide little absorption or phase contrast, they are not visible and only become visible as they aerate, allowing a detailed examination of this process. Pups were imaged live from birth to determine the timing and spatial pattern of lung aeration, and relative levels of lung aeration were measured from the images using a power spectral analysis. We report the first detailed observations and measurements of lung aeration, demonstrating its dependence on inspiratory activity and body position; dependent regions aerated at much slower rates. The air/liquid interface moved toward the distal airways only during inspiration, with little proximal movement during expiration, indicating that trans-pulmonary pressures play an important role in airway liquid clearance at birth. Using these imaging techniques, the dynamics of lung aeration and the critical role it plays in regulating the physiological changes at birth can be fully explored."

We demonstrate that neurons exposed to DNA damage or oxidative stress exhibit extensive mitochondrial fission, an early event preceding neuronal loss. The extent of mitochondrial fragmentation and remodeling is variable and depends on the mode and the severity of the death stimuli. Interestingly, whereas mitofusin 2 loss of function significantly induces cell death in the absence of any cell death stimuli, expression of mitofusin 2 prevents cell death following DNA damage, oxidative stress, and K+ deprivation induced apoptosis. More importantly, whereas wild-type Mfn2 and the hydrolysis-deficient mutant of Mfn2 (Mfn2RasG12V) function equally to promote fusion and lengthening of mitochondria, the activated Mfn2RasG12V mutant shows a significant increase in the protection of neurons against cell death and release of proapoptotic factor cytochrome c.

These findings highlight a signaling role for Mfn2 in the regulation of apoptosis that extends beyond its role in mitochondrial fusion. It has been recently demonstrated that the apoptotic program includes the regulated induction of mitochondrial fragmentation (1Frank S. Gaume B. Bergmann-Leitner E.S. Leitner W.W. Robert E.G.

The regulatory mechanisms and functional importance of these events during death remain unclear. For example, it is not clear whether the inhibition of mitochondrial fusion is an essential step in apoptosis or if fragmentation is promoted mainly because of the increase in fission. In addition, it has been shown that the loss of either Drp1 or hFis1 delayed, but did not block cell death, questioning the importance of the mitochondria morphological shift in the apoptotic cascade (5Estaquier J. Arnoult D. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1086-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 6Parone P.A. James D.I. Da Cruz S. Mattenberger Y. Donze O. Barja F. Martinou J.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 7397-7408Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In this context, there is an emerging emphasis on the examination of mitochondrial fusion in the context of cell death. Mitochondrial fusion is regulated by at least three essential GTPases, the outer membrane-anchored proteins mitofusin 1 (Mfn1), 3The abbreviations used are: Mfn, mitofusin; CGN, cerebellar granule neurons; MOI, multiplicity of infection; ROS, reactive oxygen species; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; GFP, green fluorescent protein; OCT, ornithine carbamyl transferase; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; DIV, days in vitro. 3The abbreviations used are: Mfn, mitofusin; CGN, cerebellar granule neurons; MOI, multiplicity of infection; ROS, reactive oxygen species; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; GFP, green fluorescent protein; OCT, ornithine carbamyl transferase; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; DIV, days in vitro. and mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) along with the intermembrane space GTPase, Opa1 (7Shaw J.M. Nunnari J. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 178-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 8Chen H. Detmer S.A. Ewald A.J. Griffin E.E. Fraser S.E. Chan D.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar). Although the functions of Mfn2 overlap with Mfn1 in the process of mitochondrial fusion (9Detmer S.A. Chan D.C. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), there are clear distinctions between these two GTPases. Perhaps most informative of their distinct function is their biochemical difference in nucleotide binding and hydrolysis properties, where Mfn1 has a faster GTPase hydrolysis rate and higher affinity for nucleotide relative to Mfn2 (10Ishihara N. Eura Y. Mihara K. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 6535-6546Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 11Eura Y. Ishihara N. Yokota S. Mihara K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 134: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). In addition, Mfn1, but not Mfn2, has been shown to genetically interact with Opa1 (12Cipolat S. Martins de Brito O. Dal Zilio B. Scorrano L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15927-15932Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar), a member of the dynamin family of mechanoenzymes. This relationship with Opa1 would suggest that Mfn1 plays a central role with Opa1 in the fusion process. In an in vitro mitochondrial docking assay, expression of Mfn1 significantly enhanced the tethering reaction, whereas Mfn2 resulted in tethering with low efficiency, suggesting a secondary role for Mfn2 in docking (10Ishihara N. Eura Y. Mihara K. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 6535-6546Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Recently, compelling evidence has emerged supporting additional roles for Mfn2 that goes beyond the regulation of the mitochondrial fusion. First, Mfn2 is colocalized in punctate with Bax and Drp1 at sites of future fission (13Karbowski M. Lee Y.J. Gaume B. Jeong S.Y. Frank S. Nechushtan A. Santel A. Fuller M. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 931-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). This suggests that Mfn2 activity may affect mitochondrial recruitment of Bax or Drp1 during cell death. Second, Mfn2, but not Mfn1, can interact directly with Ced9 or Bclxl in HEK293 cells, suggesting a mechanism for cross-talk with antiapoptotic Bcl family proteins (3Delivani P. Adrain C. Taylor R.C. Duriez P.J. Martin S.J. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 761-773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Third, Mfn2, not Mfn1, has been shown to modulate metabolism through function of complex 1, IV, and V (14Bach D. Pich S. Soriano F.X. Vega N. Baumgartner B. Oriola J. Daugaard J.R. Lloberas J. Camps M. Zierath J.R. Rabasa-Lhoret R. Wallberg-Henriksson H. Laville M. Palacin M. Vidal H. Rivera F. Brand M. Zorzano A. J. Biol.

Genet. 2005; 14: 1405-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Fourth, it was also shown that cytosolic Bax plays a specific role in the steady state activity of Mfn2 as a regulator of mitochondrial fusion (16Karbowski M. Norris K.L. Cleland M.M. Jeong S.Y. Youle R.J. Nature. 2006; 443: 658-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Most importantly, Mfn2 seems to be critical for the function of the nervous system as point mutations in this molecule have been associated with Charcot Marie Tooth neuropathy type 2A (17Zuchner S. Mersiyanova I.V. Muglia M. Bissar-Tadmouri N. Rochelle J. Dadali E.L. Zappia M. Nelis E. Patitucci A. Senderek J. Parman Y. Evgrafov O. Jonghe P.D. Takahashi Y. Tsuji S. Pericak-Vance M.A. Quattrone A. Battologlu E. Polyakov A.V. Timmerman V. Schroder J.M. Vance J.M. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 449-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). Understanding the role of mitofusin 2 in response to acute neuronal injury is therefore crucial for development of novel therapeutic strategies. Because of the importance of Mfn2 in fusion as well as its importance in the nervous system, we therefore asked whether Mfn2 is involved in the regulation of acute injury using primary cerebellar granule neurons. To examine the role of this GTPase in apoptosis signaling, we have constructed adenoviral vectors carrying both wild type and a hydrolysis-deficient mutant of Mfn2, Mfn2RasG12V (18Neuspiel M. Zunino R. Gangaraju S. Rippstein P. McBride H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25060-25070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), and Mfn2RasG12V lentivirus for long term transduction of these neurons. We asked: (a) whether Mfn2 could protect neurons against different mechanisms of injury and (b) whether this protection is by promoting mitochondrial fusion and shifting the morphological equilibrium or through an additional role for Mfn2 that is distinct from the stimulation of mitochondrial fusion. The results of our studies demonstrate that mitochondrial fragmentation in response to neuronal injury is dramatic and occurs as an early event. Furthermore, we show that Mfn2 signals mitochondrial fusion in neurons and protects against neuronal death. Our results indicate that the increased activation of mitochondrial fusion by expression of Mfn2 or Mfn2RasG12V cause an equally dramatic increase in the mitochondrial lengths to greater than 30 μm extending throughout the processes. Interestingly, while both wild type Mfn2 and Mfn2RasG12V result in the equal lengthening of mitochondria, the Mfn2RasG12V is most protective against neuronal cell death and release of pro-apoptotic factors. These findings emphasize a signaling role for Mfn2 that goes beyond its role in the regulation of mitochondrial fusion.

Three random fields were chosen for each group, and the images of cells in these fields were taken with a fluorescence microscope using the appropriate filters.

Representative samples were photographed using a Zeiss Axiovert 100 (Oberkochen, Germany) fluorescence microscope equipped with a QiCam Digital camera (QImaging Corporation, Burnaby, Canada) and Northern Eclipse software (Empix Imaging Inc. Mississauga, ON, Canada). The total number of cells in each field was counted. Cell death was expressed as a percentage of total cells. DNA Damage, K+ Deprivation, and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)-induced Cell Death—To model in vitro DNA damage-induced cell death, CGNs were treated with 10 μm camptothecin (Sigma-Aldrich) following 2 days in vitro (2 DIV). Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was used to model ROS-induced cell death. CGNs were treated with H2O2 following 2 DIV for 5 min after which the medium was replaced with conditioned medium taken from the parallel cultures with no treatment. Because of unstable nature of H2O2, the concentration used in each replicate was optimized prior to each treatment and 75–100 μm was used to induce 50–70% cell death following 24 h of treatment. To model K+ deprivation-induced cell death, neurons were transduced at the time of plating with purified lentiviruses 1.5 MOI and after 7 days in vitro the media containing 25 mm K+ was changed to a low potassium media of 5 mm. Cytochrome c Release—Neurons were fixed and stained with cytochrome c and/or Tom20 and Hoechst following treatment with hydrogen peroxide or camptothecin. For each replicate, a total of 100 neurons were counted from 3–5 different fields. In each case, a Z stack of the field was taken for analysis using a Zeiss 510 meta confocal microscope. A diffuse cytochrome c staining or complete lack of staining was identified as release. Time Lapse Microscopy—CGNs were seeded on 4-well plates (Nalgene Nunc International, Rochester, NY) with attached glass coverslips coated with poly d-lysine (VWR International), and infected with the YFP-tagged ornithine carbamyl transferase (OCT-YFP), a mitochondrial matrix protein, at the time of seeding. Following each treatment, neurons were imaged to track individual mitochondria in real time. The coverslips were mounted in a temperature-controlled chamber (37 °C) in regular growth media supplemented with 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and visualized with an Olympus ×100 oil immersion objective, numerical aperture 1.4, on an Olympus IX80 Laser scanning confocal microscope operated by FV1000 software v1.4a. The YFP was excited with 515-nm line of a multiple line Ar laser, the Mitofluor Red was excited with the 543-nm line of He/Ne green laser, and the Alexa 647 was excited with the 633-nm line of He/Ne red laser. All images shown demonstrate cells that are representative of moderate infection efficiencies and that have been obtained from at least three independent experiments. Immunofluorescence—At each time point, neurons were fixed for 30 min with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (1× PBS) and then rinsed twice with 1× PBS. Cells were permeabilized with 300 μl of ice-cold 0.4% Triton-X in 1× PBS for 10 min. Cells were stained with the primary antibodies in 10% normal goat serum-0.4% Triton X/PBS for 1 h. The cells were washed 3 × 5 min with ice-cold 1× PBS. Cells were incubated with the secondary antibodies to either TOM 20 (1: 250, a kind gift from Dr. Gordon Shore) (22Goping I.S. Millar D.G. Shore G.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) or cytochrome c (1:250; BD Biosciences, Franklin Lake, NJ) in 10% normal goat serum-0.4% Triton X/PBS for 1 h. The cells were washed for 5 min and stained with Hoechst for 5 min. Following Hoechst staining, neurons were washed with 1× PBS for 3 × 5 min and mounted. Representative samples were photographed using a Zeiss Axiovert 100 (Oberkochen, Germany) fluorescence microscope equipped with a QiCam Digital camera (QImaging Corporation) and Northern Eclipse software (Empix Imaging Inc.). Mitochondrial Length Measurement—Whole cell images were acquired by exciting at 549 nm with the CY3 filter (Chroma Technology Corp., Rockingham, VT). Mitochondrial length was measured by tracing the mitochondria using Northern Eclipse software. Mitochondrial length varied remarkably even in control neurons. For comparison purposes mitochondria were classified into different categories with a length ranging from less than 0.5 μm, 0.5–1 μm, 1–2 μm, 2–3 μm, and greater than 3 μm. Quantification and Statistical Analysis—For cell death studies, a minimum of 500 cells per field (three fields per replicate) was scored for each treatment at the indicated time points. For mitochondrial length measurements, a minimum of 500 mitochondria for each treatment (per replicate) was scored. The data represent the mean and S.D. from three independent experiments (n = 3), where n stands for each independent experiment. p values were obtained using two-way analysis of variance and Tukey post-hoc tests or Student’s t test. A p value <0.05 was considered significant and was indicated on the graphs by an asterisk. Mitochondrial Fragmentation Occurs Following DNA Damage-induced Neuronal Death—It has been suggested that mitochondria remodel following acute neuronal injury (23Rintoul G.L. Filiano A.J. Brocard J.B. Kress G.J. Reynolds I.J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7881-7888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether mitochondria undergo fragmentation or remodeling following DNA damage-induced neuronal death. The DNA damage model induced by topoisomerase inhibitor, camptothecin, occurs physiologically following stroke or trauma and is believed to contribute to the extensive neuronal loss after acute injury (24McGahan L. Hakim A.M. Robertson G.S. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 56: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To model in vitro DNA damage-induced cell death, primary cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) were treated with 10 μm camptothecin. This concentration of camptothecin was shown to induce a slow cell death resulting in about 40% neuronal loss by 24 h (Fig. 1D). To track individual mitochondria in real time, we created adenovirus vectors containing the 32 amino acid targeting signal of ornithine carbamyl transferase fused to YFP (OCT-YFP) (25Harder Z. Zunino R. McBride H. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 340-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and infected the CGN cultures at the time of seeding. Mitochondrial dynamics were documented within the first 16 h using fluorescence time lapse microscopy. We quantified the percentage and timing of mitochondrial fragmentation following treatment with camptothecin. CGN cultures were fixed and stained with anti-TOM20, a mitochondrial protein import receptor (22Goping I.S. Millar D.G. Shore G.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and Hoechst to identify cell nuclei at different time points following treatment (Fig. 1B). Mitochondria in neurons exhibited variable length. The data were therefore binned into different length categories from less than 0.5 to greater than 3 μm. Quantification of mitochondrial lengths showed that immediately following exposure to camptothecin, 96% of mitochondria had a length of greater than 0.5 μm, as in the control neurons (Fig. 1C). Of these 41 ± 1% ranged within 0.5–1 μm; 47 ± 4% had a length of between 1 and 2 μm, and 9.3 ± 0.9% had a length of 2–3 μm. At 6 h following treatment with camptothecin, 20 ± 2.5% of the mitochondria were fragmented with a length of less than 0.5 μm. Following 12 h of treatment, however, there was a dramatic change in morphology where 56 ± 3% of mitochondria exhibited a length of less than 0.5 μm. The fragmentation was maximal by 24 h where 70.2 ± 0.4% of mitochondria exhibited a length of less than 0.5 μm. Only 3.4 ± 1.7% of mitochondria had a length of 2–3 μm at 24 h. These results demonstrate that mitochondrial fragmentation is initiated 3–6 h following exposure of neurons to camptothecin and there is a remarkable difference in the mitochondria pool by 12 h. To confirm whether this change in morphology was because of mitochondrial membrane scission rather than organelle swelling, we performed a video analysis of mitochondria within cells treated with camptothecin. In many videos, mitochondria were observed to clearly divide into much smaller fragments upon 6 h of treatment with camptothecin. Therefore, although we did observe some mitochondrial swelling (Fig. 1A, box), we also observed mitochondrial fission (Fig. 1A and supplemental movie 1). To ask whether mitochondrial fragmentation correlates with the cell death, the rate of cell death was evaluated by counting the percentage of cells exhibiting pyknotic nuclei. Pyknotic nuclei indicative of apoptosis were observed following 12 h of treatment (Fig. 1D). Cell death increased to 20 ± 3% at 12 h and was maximal at 24 h (39 ± 2.6%) within the given time frame. Based on these results, we conclude that mitochondrial fragmentation is initiated 6–9 h prior to the degradation of the nucleus following DNA damage-induced cell death. Mitochondrial Fragmentation Is an Early Event Following Oxidative Stress—In many types of acute neuronal injury such as stroke, a primary cause of death is the exposure to ROS, which initiates a complex signaling cascade (26Cole K. Perez-Polo J.R. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 2004; 22: 485-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We next asked whether mitochondrial fragmentation also occurs following oxidative stress. CGN cultures were infected with OCT-YFP at the time of seeding and treated with H2O2 for 5 min after which the medium was replaced by conditioned media. Time lapse microscopy studies revealed that mitochondria undergo fragmentation within 1 h following treatment (Fig. 2A and supplemental movie 2). Mitochondria were also documented to transition from rod-like to spherical following fragmentation. This kind of mitochondrial remodeling following fission was indeed a common event in this mode of cell death (Fig. 2B and supplemental movie 3). Interestingly exposure of neurons to hydrogen peroxide for longer than 5 min resulted directly in mitochondrial remodeling within first 20 min (Fig. 2C and supplemental movie 4). This concentration was toxic to cells as 100% of neurons were dead following first 2 h of treatment. Interestingly, unlike treatment with camptothecin where the fragmented mitochondria remained highly motile, the motility of fragmented mitochondria was substantially attenuated upon treatment with hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 2D and supplemental movies 1 and 5). To quantify the timing and percentage fragmentation of mitochondria and its correlation to cell death, mitochondrial and nuclear morphology were evaluated (Fig. 3A). Immediately following exposure to ROS, greater than 94% of mitochondria had a length of greater than 0.5 μm (Fig. 3B). Neurons treated with hydrogen peroxide exhibited signs of mitochondrial fragmentation as early as 3 h where 31 ± 6% of mitochondria had a length of less than 0.5 μm. Mitochondrial fragmentation continued to increase to 62.3 ± 1.4% and 88.5 ± 1.2% at 12 and 24 h, respectively. To ask whether the onset of mitochondrial fragmentation correlates with cell death, apoptosis was examined by Hoechst to detect pyknotic nuclei (Fig. 3C). The results of cell death studies were confirmed using colorimetric MTT survival assay (data not shown). At 12 h following treatment, 30 ± 2.5% of neurons exhibited pyknotic nuclei whereas cell death was maximal by 24 h when 50 ± 2% of neurons exhibited pyknotic nuclei. These results show that mitochondrial fragmentation was detected 3 h after treatment and 9 h before the apoptotic nuclei were considerably detected. These findings suggest that mitochondrial fragmentation may serve as an early apoptotic signaling event in this mode of injury.FIGURE 3Mitochondrial fragmentation following oxidative stress. CGNs were treated with 100 μm H2O2 at 2 DIV. Neurons were stained as described in the legend to Fig. 1. A, panel shows representative images of mitochondria at each time point stained for Tom20 and Hoechst. B, mitochondrial length was assessed at the indicated time points following H2O2 treatment and measurements were binned according to length. The length is classified based on the frequency at different lengths (less than 0.5, 0.5–1, 1–2, and greater than 3μm). C, cell death was assessed at the indicated times by nuclear morphology revealed by Hoechst stain. n = 3, *, p < 0.05; bar, 30 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Together, our results demonstrate that mitochondrial fragmentation is an early common event following acute injury in CGNs. We therefore asked whether preventing the fragmentation of the mitochondria by activation of the mitochondrial fusion machinery could prevent cell death induced by DNA damage and oxidative stress. Increased Activation of Mfn2 Blocks Mitochondrial Fragmentation and Protects Neurons against Acute Injury—To examine whether activating mitochondrial fusion could protect neurons against cell death, we created adenovirus vectors containing the CFP-tagged wild-type Mfn2 and the hydrolysis-deficient, constitutively active mutant Mfn2RasG12V (18Neuspiel M. Zunino R. Gangaraju S. Rippstein P. McBride H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25060-25070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Primary neurons were infected 48 h prior to exposure to oxidative stress or DNA damage. We first examined whether these proteins could affect the mitochondrial morphology in untreated neurons. Cells were infected in parallel with adenovirus vectors carrying Mfn2, Mfn2RasG12V, or GFP control, and the mitochondrial morphology was evaluated 48-h later (Fig. 4). To confirm protein expression a Western blot analysis was performed with neurons infected with Mfn2 or Mfn2RasG12V (Fig. 4A). In unchallenged neurons (Fig. 4, B and E) the majority of mitochondria had an average length between 1 and 2 μm (53.8 ± 1.3%); however, increased expression of Mfn2:CFP (Fig. 4C) or Mfn2RasG12V: CFP (Fig. 4D) resulted in a significant increase in the length of the mitochondria. The majority of mitochondria were greater than 3 μm as a result of increased levels of Mfn2 (33.97 ± 5%) and Mfn2RasG12V:CFP (42.9 ± 4.2%) expression (Fig. 4E). These results demonstrate that enhanced activation of Mfn2 results in increased mitochondrial length. We next asked whether activation of Mfn2 could prevent mitochondrial fragmentation and ultimately protect neurons against death induced by neuronal injury. To test whether activation of Mfn2 could protect neurons against DNA damage, parallel cultures were exposed to 10 μm camptothecin. The mitochondrial morphology and apoptosis were evaluated following 24 h (Fig. 5A). Mitochondrial fragmentation was dramatically inhibited with both Mfn2:CFP or Mfn2RasG12V:CFP expression (Fig. 5A). Following 24 h of treatment, GFP-infected neurons showed only 9.6 ± 1.1% of mitochondria measuring greater than 3 μm, whereas the expression of Mfn2:CFP and Mfn2RasG12V:CFP resulted in 33.4 ± 3.2% and 42.17 ± 7% of mitochondria being greater than 3 μm. Interestingly, the group of mitochondria measuring greater than 3 μm had a widely varied length distribution, with some single mitochondria spanning long projections and measuring greater than 30 μm. These results reveal that expression of Mfn2 or constitutive activation by expression of Mfn2RasG12V could equally prevent the breakdown of the mitochondria typically seen following DNA damage. Most importantly, increasing the levels of Mfn2 resulted in increased protection against cell death induced by DNA damage (Fig. 5C). Following 24 h of treatment, 34 ± 1.6% of neurons exhibited pyknotic nuclei in the GFP control, and this was reduced to 23.9 ± 1.6% in the Mfn2 cultures. Increased activation of Mfn2 through delivery of Mfn2RasG12V:CFP was significantly more protective than t"
https://openalex.org/W1969573745,"Adiponectin is an adipokine with potent anti-inflammatory properties. However, the mechanisms by which adiponectin suppresses macrophage function are not well understood. Treatment of RAW264.7 macrophages with adiponectin for 18 h decreased lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) production. Here we demonstrate that globular adiponectin (gAcrp) initially increased TNF-α expression in RAW264.7 macrophages; this TNF-α then contributed to increased expression of interleukin-10, which in turn was required for the development of tolerance to subsequent LPS exposure. gAcrp-mediated increases in TNF-α mRNA accumulation were associated with increased TNF-α promoter activity. gAcrp increased the DNA binding activity of both Egr-1 and NFκB; mutation of either the Egr-1 or NFκB binding sites in the TNF-α promoter decreased gAcrp-stimulated promoter activity. Further, co-transfection with either dominant negative Egr-1 or the IκB super-repressor prevented gAcrp-stimulated TNF-α promoter activity. gAcrp also increased Egr-1 promoter activity, mRNA accumulation, and DNA binding activity. Inhibition of ERK1/2 with U0126 potently suppressed gAcrp-stimulated Egr-1 promoter activity, as well as TNF-α promoter activity. In summary, these data demonstrate that adiponectin initially increases TNF-α production by macrophages via ERK1/2→Egr-1 and NFκB-dependent mechanisms; these increases in TNF-α in turn lead to increased expression of interleukin-10 and an eventual dampening of LPS-mediated cytokine production in macrophages.

Adiponectin acts on target tissues via the activation of adiponectin receptors 1 and 2 (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2) (5Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Ito Y. Tsuchida A. Yokomizo T. Kita S. Sugiyama T. Miyagishi M.

In addition to regulating glucose and lipid metabolism, adiponectin influences the activity of the innate immune system. Both AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 are expressed in monocytes and macrophages (6Chinetti G. Zawadski C. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 314: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence indicates that AdipoR1 is critical to the anti-inflammatory effects of adiponectin (7Yamaguchi N.

Adiponectin is hypothesized to dampen the early phases of macrophage inflammatory responses (8Yokota T. Oritani K. Takahashi I. Ishikawa J. Matsuyama A. Ouchi N. Kihara S. Funahashi T. Tenner A.J.

This anti-inflammatory response to adiponectin has been implicated as a potential mechanism for the anti-atherogenic properties of adiponectin (11Okamoto Y. Kihara S. Ouchi N. Nishida M. Arita Y.

In response to either the globular or full-length forms of adiponectin, macrophages exhibit decreased sensitivity to LPS-stimulated signaling. In particular, LPS-stimulated NFκB and ERK1/2 activation have been found to be sensitive to the inhibitory effects of adiponectin (7Yamaguchi N. Argueta J.G. Masuhiro Y. Kagishita M. Nonaka K.

Physiol. 2006; 290: G998-G1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Suppression of these toll-like receptor 4-mediated signaling pathways is thought to contribute to decreased activation of key transcription factors (nuclear factor κB (NFκB) and early growth response protein 1 (Egr-1)) that regulate cytokine expression in macrophages (7Yamaguchi N. Argueta J.G. Masuhiro Y. Kagishita M. Nonaka K. Saito T. Hanazawa S. Yamashita Y. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 6821-6826Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 10Thakur V. Pritchard M.T. McMullen M.R. Nagy L.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: G998-G1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The mechanisms for the profound inhibitory effects of adiponectin on macrophage function are not well understood. The phenotypic characteristics of adiponectin-treated macrophages are similar to that observed in response to repeated/prolonged exposure to LPS/endotoxin, or what is often called “endotoxin tolerance” (14Dobrovolskaia M.A. Vogel S.N. Microbes Infect. 2002; 4: 903-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). One recent report demonstrates that short-term treatment of macrophages with adiponectin first increases the expression of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-6 (15Tsatsanis C. Zacharioudaki V. Androulidaki A. Dermitzaki E. Charalampopoulos I. Minas V. Gravanis A. Margioris A.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 335: 1254-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar); continued exposure to adiponectin then promotes the development of tolerance to subsequent pro-inflammatory signals, such as the toll-like receptor 4 ligand LPS or the toll-like receptor 3 ligand poly(I·C) (15Tsatsanis C. Zacharioudaki V. Androulidaki A. Dermitzaki E. Charalampopoulos I. Minas V. Gravanis A. Margioris A.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 335: 1254-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Wolf et al. have demonstrated that adiponectin induces the expression of anti-inflammatory mediators, such as IL-10 (16Wolf A.M. Wolf D. Rumpold H. Enrich B. Tilg H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 630-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar); however, it is not yet known whether IL-10 is essential for the inhibitory effects of adiponectin on LPS-stimulated signaling in macrophages. To better understand the mechanisms by which adiponectin leads to the development of tolerance to pro-inflammatory signals, here we have investigated in detail the short-term responses of RAW 264.7 macrophages to adiponectin. In addition to the activation of NFκB by adiponectin (15Tsatsanis C. Zacharioudaki V. Androulidaki A. Dermitzaki E. Charalampopoulos I. Minas V. Gravanis A. Margioris A.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 335: 1254-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), we found that adiponectin also activates the transcription factor Egr-1 via an ERK1/2-dependent pathway. In combination, NFκB and Egr-1, two potent transcription factors that regulate pro-inflammatory gene expression in macrophages, then contributed to increased TNF-α expression. This rapid increase in TNF-α expression then led to increased IL-10 expression; IL-10 in turn mediated the development of tolerance to subsequent stimulation of RAW 264.7 macrophages by LPS after a longer period of exposure to adiponectin. Materials—LPS from Escherichia coli serotype 026:B6 (tissue culture-tested, L-2654) was purchased from Sigma; all experiments were carried out with a single lot of LPS (Lot 064K4077). All cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen. Antibodies were from the following sources: phospho-ERK1/2, Egr-1, p50, and p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and total ERK1/2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). Anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG peroxidase were purchased from Chemicon (Indianapolis, IN). Recombinant human globular adiponectin (gAcrp) expressed in E. coli was purchased from Peprotech, Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ). Endotoxin contamination of all reagents used to treat RAW264.7 macrophages was routinely monitored in the laboratory using a kinetic chromogenic test based on the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay (Kinetic-QCL; BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD). Endotoxin-free plasmid preparation kits were from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Luciferase reporter constructs have been previously described: pTNF-α-LUC (containing –615 to +1 nucleotide TNF-α promoter and mutated constructs in a luciferase reporter) (17Yao J. Mackman N. Edgington T.S. Fan S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17795-17801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) and the Egr-1 LUC (containing 1.2 kb of the Egr-1 promoter) (18Calandra T. Bucala R. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 17: 77-88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were from N. Mackman, University of California San Diego. The plasmid containing the dominant negative Egr-1 (pCMVETTL) was a gift from D. L. Wong and V. Sukhatme (19Papanikolaou N.A. Sabban E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26683-26689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the IκB super-repressor (IκB-AA (pRc/CMV IκB S32A/S36A) was a gift from J. Didonato (20DiDonato J. Mercurio F. Rosette C. Wu-Li J. Suyang H. Ghosh S. Karin M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Silencer-validated siRNA for TNFR SF1A (TNF-RI) or scrambled siRNA were from Ambion (Austin, TX). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits for TNF-α and IL-10 were from BIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA); neutralizing antibodies to TNF-α and IL-10 were from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) and BD Biosciences, respectively. Culture of RAW 264.7 Macrophages and Luciferase Assays—The murine RAW 264.7 macrophage-like cell line was routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2 (21Shi L. Kishore R. McMullen M. Nagy L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14777-14785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To test the role of secreted TNF-α or IL-10 in mediating the effects of gAcrp, in some experiments cells were co-cultured with increasing concentrations of neutralizing antibodies to TNF-α or IL-10 or the appropriate normal IgG controls during gAcrp treatment. For luciferase reporter assays, RAW 264.7 macrophages were grown in 6-well plates to 60–70% confluency and then transiently transfected with control and expression vectors using Superfect transfection reagent (for DNA-only transfections) or TransMessenger transfection reagent (for siRNA transfections) (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were co-transfected with pTK-RL (Promega, Madison, WI), an expression vector for Renilla luciferase under the control of the thymidine kinase promoter, as a control for transfection efficiency. Transfected cells were subcultured and seeded at 10.2 × 104/cm2 in 96-well plates. After 24 h (for DNA-only transfections) or 4 h (for siRNA transfections), medium was removed and cells stimulated or not with gAcrp or LPS in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/fetal bovine serum. Cells were then extracted in lysis buffer and luciferase activities measured using the Dual Luciferase assay system (Promega). In some experiments, RAW264.7 macrophages were preincubated with 50 μg/ml polymyxin B. Western Blot Analysis of ERK1/2 Phosphorylation—RAW264.7 macrophages were stimulated with or without 1 μg/ml gAcrp for 0–60 min. Cells were then moved to ice, washed with 2 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and lysed in Laemmli sample buffer containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and probed by Western blot for phospho-ERK1/2 and total ERK1/2. Isolation of Nuclear Extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—RAW264.7 macrophages were treated with or without 1 μg/ml gAcrp for 0–4 h. In some experiments, cells were pretreated with 10 μg/ml polymixin B for 60 min. Nuclei were isolated and nuclear proteins extracted using the Nuclei EZ Prep kit from Sigma. Nuclear extracts (5 μg of protein) were then used to assess DNA binding activity by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using an oligonucleotide probe for the sequence for the Egr-1 binding site in the TNF-α promoter (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Coralville, IA) or for the consensus sequence for the NFκB binding site (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as previously described (22Kishore R. Hill J.R. McMullen M.R. Frenkel J. Nagy L.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: G6-G15Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Real-time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from RAW264.7 macrophages using the RNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen), with on-column DNA digestion using the RNase-free DNase set (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two hundred to three hundred nanograms of total RNA were reverse transcribed using the RETROscript kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) with random decamers as primers. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was performed in an MX3000P apparatus (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), using the Brilliant SYBR Green QPCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The relative amount of target mRNA was determined using the comparative threshold (Ct) method by normalizing target mRNA Ct values to those for β-actin (ΔCt). The primer sequences are as follows: TNF-α, F 5′-CCC TCA CAC TCA GAT CAT CTT CT-3′, R 5′-GCT ACG ACG TGG GCT ACA G-3′; IL-10, F 5′-CCA AGC CTT ATC GGA AAT GA-3′, R 5′TTT TCA CAG GGG AGA AAT CG-3′; Egr-1, F 5′-AGC GAA CAA CCC TAT GAG CAC-3′, R 5′-TCG TTT GGC TGG GAT AAC TCG-3′; β-actin, F 5′-CTT TGC AGC TCC TTC GTT GC-3′, R 5′-ACG ATG GAG GGG AAT ACA GC-3′. All primers used for real-time PCR analysis were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. Statistical analyses of real-time PCR data were performed using ΔCt values. Statistical Analysis—Values reported are means + S.E. Data were analyzed by the general linear models procedure followed by least square means analysis of differences between groups (SAS, Carey, IN). Adiponectin has potent anti-inflammatory effects on macrophages. We have previously reported that exposure of primary cultures of rat Kupffer cells to globular or full-length adiponectin for 18 h suppresses subsequent LPS-stimulated TNF-α production (10Thakur V. Pritchard M.T. McMullen M.R. Nagy L.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: G998-G1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Here we report a similar effect of an 18-h treatment with adiponectin on LPS-stimulated TNF-α protein secretion in RAW 264.7 macrophages (Fig. 1A). Treatment of RAW264.7 macrophages with increasing concentrations of gAcrp or full-length adiponectin dose dependently decreased LPS-stimulated TNF-α production (Fig. 1A). TNF-α concentration in the medium of cells not treated with LPS was undetectable (data not shown). RAW 264.7 macrophages were more sensitive to gAcrp compared with full-length adiponectin (Fig. 1A). Therefore, all subsequent experiments in this report were carried out with gAcrp at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. Decreased LPS-stimulated TNF-α production after overnight treatment with gAcrp was associated with decreased accumulation of TNF-α mRNA accumulation in response to LPS treatment (Fig. 1B). The characteristics of macrophages after overnight exposure to Acrp, i.e. decreased toll-like receptor 4-stimulated signal transduction and cytokine expression (7Yamaguchi N. Argueta J.G. Masuhiro Y.

Physiol. 2006; 290: G998-G1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), are reminiscent of the development of tolerance to LPS (14Dobrovolskaia M.A. Vogel S.N. Microbes Infect. 2002; 4: 903-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 23Fan H. Cook J.A. J. Endotoxin. Res. 2004; 10: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Because tolerance to LPS can be mediated by the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (24Grutz G. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2005; 77: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), we next asked whether the desensitization of LPS-stimulated TNF-α production by gAcrp was mediated by IL-10. gAcrp increased IL-10 mRNA accumulation, with a peak accumulation at 5 h of exposure to gAcrp (Fig. 2A), similar to the increase in IL-10 mRNA observed in human leukocytes after treatment with adiponectin (16Wolf A.M. Wolf D. Rumpold H. Enrich B. Tilg H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 630-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 23Fan H. Cook J.A. J. Endotoxin. Res. 2004; 10: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). IL-10 peptide accumulated in the medium during gAcrp treatment (Fig. 2B). Co-culture of RAW264.7 macrophages with neutralizing antibodies against IL-10 during 18 h of exposure to gAcrp prevented the gAcrp-mediated desensitization of LPS-stimulated TNF-α mRNA accumulation (Fig. 1B). Because gAcrp-stimulated IL-10 expression was required for long-term desensitization of LPS-stimulated TNF-α expression by gAcrp, we next investigated the mechanisms by which gAcrp increased IL-10 expression. IL-10 expression is induced by a number of pro-inflammatory mediators, including viruses, LPS, and TNF-α (25Moore M.J. Rosbash M. Science. 2001; 294: 1841-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar); LPS induction of IL-10 expression is dependent on TNF-α production (26Sato T.A. Keelan J.A. Mitchell M.D. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that short-term treatment of RAW 264.7 macrophages with gAcrp would rapidly increase the expression of TNF-α and that this increase in TNF-α expression would contribute to gAcrp-stimulated IL-10 expression. Exposure of RAW 264.7 macrophages to 1 μg/ml gAcrp rapidly increased the accumulation of TNF-α mRNA with an apparent peak at 2 h (Fig. 3A); this increase preceded the peak in IL-10 mRNA accumulation at 5 h (Fig. 2A). Secretion of TNF-α peptide by RAW264.7 macrophages was also increased in response to gAcrp treatment, with TNF-α detected in the medium within 1 h of exposure to gAcrp (Fig. 3B). Increased accumulation of TNF-α mRNA was associated with an increase in the expression of a luciferase reporter construct driven by the murine TNF-α promoter (Fig. 3C). To rule out any effect of contaminating endotoxin in the gAcrp preparation in mediating this increase in TNF-α promoter activity, RAW 264.7 macrophages were pretreated with polymyxin B, an antibiotic that binds to LPS, prior to stimulation with either 100 ng/ml LPS or 1 μg/ml gAcrp. Although polymyxin B decreased LPS-stimulated TNF-α promoter activity, it had no effect on the response to gAcrp (Fig. 3D). Two strategies were taken to test the role of gAcrp-stimulated TNF-α production in mediating increased IL-10 production during gAcrp treatment. First, RAW 264.7 macrophages were co-cultured with a neutralizing antibody to TNF-α during exposure to gAcrp. Antibodies against TNF-α decreased gAcrp-stimulated increases in IL-10 mRNA, whereas control antibodies had no effect (Fig. 4A). A second approach was to knock down TNF-RI with siRNA strategies. We hypothesized that if TNF-α were required for gAcrp-stimulated IL-10 expression, then knock down of TNF-RI expression should prevent this response. RAW264.7 macrophages were transiently transfected with siRNA against TNF-RI or scrambled siRNA, as a control. Cells were co-transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid containing the full-length IL-10 promoter. gAcrp increased IL-10 promoter-driven luciferase activity in cells co-transfected with scrambled siRNA by 48-fold over basal (Fig. 4B). This response was reduced to 11-fold in cells co-transfected with siRNA against TNF-RI (Fig. 4B). As a further control for the efficacy of the siRNA knock down of the TNF-RI, TNF-α-stimulated expression of an NFκB-cis reporter plasmid was also found to be suppressed in RAW264.7 macrophages transfected with siRNA against TNF-RI compared with cells transfected with scrambled siRNA (data not shown). Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that gAcrp-stimulated TNF-α expression contributed to the gAcrp-stimulated production of IL-10 and therefore to the anti-inflammatory effects of gAcrp. Transcriptional activation of TNF-α can involve the activation of distinct sets of transcription factors binding to at least two regions of the TNF-α promoter that include NFκB, Egr-1, and AP-1 binding sites (17Yao J.

Although the exact array of transcription factors interacting with the TNF-α promoter is to some extent cell- and species-specific (28Means T.K. Pavlovich R.P. Roca D. Vermeulen M.W. Fenton M.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), recruitment of NFκB and Egr-1 appears to be required for full activation of TNF-α expression in most types of macrophages (17Yao J. Mackman N. Edgington T.S. Fan S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17795-17801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 27Tsai E.Y. Falvo J.V. Tsytsykova A.V. Barczak A.K.

Treatment of RAW 264.7 macrophages with 1 μg/ml gAcrp activated the DNA binding activity of both Egr-1 and NFκB (Fig. 5A). Sixty minutes after treatment with gAcrp, nuclear extracts exhibited increased DNA binding activity of Egr-1, as well as both the p50 and p65 subunits of NFκB (Fig. 5A). The identity of each DNA-binding protein was confirmed in supershift assays using specific antibodies against each transcription factor protein (Fig. 5A). To test the functional contribution of Egr-1 and NFκBin mediating gAcrp-stimulated TNF-α expression, RAW 264.7 macrophages were transfected with a full-length TNF-α promoter-luciferase reporter construct or constructs in which the κB-3 site or Egr-1 site was mutated. Both 100 ng/ml LPS and 1 μg/ml gAcrp stimulated TNF-α promoter-driven luciferase expression to an equivalent level. Mutation of the Egr-1 or κB-3 sites reduced both LPS- and gAcrp-stimulated luciferase expression by 60–70 and 90%, respectively (Fig. 5B). To further validate the contribution of these two transcription factors, RAW 264.7 macrophages were co-transfected with the TNF-α promoter-luciferase reporter and a dominant negative Egr-1 construct or the IκB super-repressor. In both conditions, gAcrp-stimulated TNF-α promoter activity was reduced (Fig. 6). Taken together, these data indicate that both Egr-1 and NFκB were involved in gAcrp-stimulated TNF-α promoter activation. Because a previous report also found that gAcrp can activate NFκB in monocytes (15Tsatsanis C. Zacharioudaki V. Androulidaki A. Dermitzaki E. Charalampopoulos I. Minas V. Gravanis A. Margioris A.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 335: 1254-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), here we have further investigated the novel observation that gAcrp increases the activity of Egr-1. Egr-1 is an immediate early gene involved in regulating the expression of a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (29Guha M. Mackman N. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1980) Google Scholar). gAcrp rapidly and transiently increased Egr-1 mRNA (Fig. 7A) and DNA binding activity (Fig. 7B). Increased expression of Egr-1 in response to LPS or tissue factor requires the activation of the MAPK family member ERK1/2 (30Shi L. Kishore R. McMullen M. Nagy L.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1205-C1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 31Guha M. O'Connell M.A. Pawlinski R. Hollis A. McGovern P. Yan S.F. Stern D. Mackman N. Blood. 2001; 98: 1429-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether inhibition of ERK1/2, p38, or JNK would prevent gAcrp-stimulated Egr-1 mRNA accumulation. Pretreatment of RAW264.7 macrophages with the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 completely inhibited gAcrp-stimulated Egr-1 mRNA accumulation, whereas pretreatment with SB203580 to inhibit p38, or SP600125 to inhibit JNK, had no effect on gAcrp-stimulated Egr-1 mRNA accumulation (Fig. 8A). Similarly, pretreatment of RA"

We have developed one such approach based on previously described broad-range reverse transcription PCR/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (RT-PCR/ESI-MS) technology.Analysis of base compositions of RT-PCR amplicons from influenza core gene segments (PB1, PB2, PA, M, NS, NP) are used to provide sub-species identification and infer influenza virus H and N subtypes. Using this approach, we detected and correctly identified 92 mammalian and avian influenza isolates, representing 30 different H and N types, including 29 avian H5N1 isolates. Further, direct analysis of 656 human clinical respiratory specimens collected over a seven-year period (1999-2006) showed correct identification of the viral species and subtypes with >97% sensitivity and specificity. Base composition derived clusters inferred from this analysis showed 100% concordance to previously established clades. Ongoing surveillance of samples from the recent influenza virus seasons (2005-2006) showed evidence for emergence and establishment of new genotypes of circulating H3N2 strains worldwide. Mixed viral quasispecies were found in approximately 1% of these recent samples providing a view into viral evolution.Thus, rapid RT-PCR/ESI-MS analysis can be used to simultaneously identify all species of influenza viruses with clade-level resolution, identify mixed viral populations and monitor global spread and emergence of novel viral genotypes. This high-throughput method promises to become an integral component of influenza surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W2045545196,"Background Mobile teledermatology has recently been shown to be suitable for teledermatology despite limitations in image definition in preliminary studies. The unique aspect of mobile teledermatology is that this system represents a filtering or triage system, allowing a sensitive approach for the management of patients with emergent skin diseases. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study we investigated the feasibility of teleconsultation using a new generation of cellular phones in pigmented skin lesions. 18 patients were selected consecutively in the Pigmented Skin Lesions Clinic of the Department of Dermatology, Medical University of Graz, Graz (Austria). Clinical and dermoscopic images were acquired using a Sony Ericsson with a built-in two-megapixel camera. Two teleconsultants reviewed the images on a specific web application (http://www.dermahandy.net/default.asp) where images had been uploaded in JPEG format. Compared to the face-to-face diagnoses, the two teleconsultants obtained a score of correct telediagnoses of 89% and of 91.5% reporting the clinical and dermoscopic images, respectively. Conclusions/Significance The present work is the first study performing mobile teledermoscopy using cellular phones. Mobile teledermatology has the potential to become an easy applicable tool for everyone and a new approach for enhanced self-monitoring for skin cancer screening in the spirit of the eHealth program of the European Commission Information for Society and Media."
https://openalex.org/W2043714862,"While recently developed short-read sequencing technologies may dramatically reduce the sequencing cost and eventually achieve the $1000 goal for re-sequencing, their limitations prevent the de novo sequencing of eukaryotic genomes with the standard shotgun sequencing protocol. We present SHRAP (SHort Read Assembly Protocol), a sequencing protocol and assembly methodology that utilizes high-throughput short-read technologies. We describe a variation on hierarchical sequencing with two crucial differences: (1) we select a clone library from the genome randomly rather than as a tiling path and (2) we sample clones from the genome at high coverage and reads from the clones at low coverage. We assume that 200 bp read lengths with a 1% error rate and inexpensive random fragment cloning on whole mammalian genomes is feasible. Our assembly methodology is based on first ordering the clones and subsequently performing read assembly in three stages: (1) local assemblies of regions significantly smaller than a clone size, (2) clone-sized assemblies of the results of stage 1, and (3) chromosome-sized assemblies. By aggressively localizing the assembly problem during the first stage, our method succeeds in assembling short, unpaired reads sampled from repetitive genomes. We tested our assembler using simulated reads from D. melanogaster and human chromosomes 1, 11, and 21, and produced assemblies with large sets of contiguous sequence and a misassembly rate comparable to other draft assemblies. Tested on D. melanogaster and the entire human genome, our clone-ordering method produces accurate maps, thereby localizing fragment assembly and enabling the parallelization of the subsequent steps of our pipeline. Thus, we have demonstrated that truly inexpensive de novo sequencing of mammalian genomes will soon be possible with high-throughput, short-read technologies using our methodology."

https://openalex.org/W2067865758,"Cerebellar Purkinje cells (PC) in vivo are commonly reported to generate irregular spike trains, documented by high coefficients of variation of interspike-intervals (ISI). In strong contrast, they fire very regularly in the in vitro slice preparation. We studied the nature of this difference in firing properties by focusing on short-term variability and its dependence on behavioral state.Using an analysis based on CV(2) values, we could isolate precise regular spiking patterns, lasting up to hundreds of milliseconds, in PC simple spike trains recorded in both anesthetized and awake rodents. Regular spike patterns, defined by low variability of successive ISIs, comprised over half of the spikes, showed a wide range of mean ISIs, and were affected by behavioral state and tactile stimulation. Interestingly, regular patterns often coincided in nearby Purkinje cells without precise synchronization of individual spikes. Regular patterns exclusively appeared during the up state of the PC membrane potential, while single ISIs occurred both during up and down states. Possible functional consequences of regular spike patterns were investigated by modeling the synaptic conductance in neurons of the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN). Simulations showed that these regular patterns caused epochs of relatively constant synaptic conductance in DCN neurons.Our findings indicate that the apparent irregularity in cerebellar PC simple spike trains in vivo is most likely caused by mixing of different regular spike patterns, separated by single long intervals, over time. We propose that PCs may signal information, at least in part, in regular spike patterns to downstream DCN neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1977551568,"Pore-forming toxins are biological weapons produced by a variety of living organisms, particularly bacteria but also by insects, reptiles, and invertebrates. These proteins affect the cell membrane of their target, disrupting permeability and leading eventually to cell death. The pore-forming toxins typically transform from soluble, monomeric proteins to oligomers that form transmembrane channels. The Cry toxins produced by <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> are widely used as insecticides. These proteins have been recognized as pore-forming toxins, and their primary action is to lyse midgut epithelial cells in their target insect. To exert their toxic effect, a prepore oligomeric intermediate is formed leading finally to membrane-inserted oligomeric pores. To understand the role of Cry oligomeric pre-pore formation in the insecticidal activity we isolated point mutations that affected toxin oligomerization but not their binding with the cadherin-like, Bt-R<sub>1</sub> receptor. We show the helix α-3 in domain I contains sequences that could form coiled-coil structures important for oligomerization. Some single point mutants in this helix bound Bt-R<sub>1</sub> receptors with similar affinity as the wild-type toxin, but were affected in oligomerization and were severally impaired in pore formation and toxicity against <i>Manduca sexta</i> larvae. These data indicate the pre-pore oligomer and the toxin pore formation play a major role in the intoxication process of Cry1Ab toxin in insect larvae."

We then confirmed the efficacy of the inhibitory peptides in vitro against the fluorescent peptide, anthrax protective antigen (PA83), and influenza hemagglutinin substrates and also in mice in vivo against two unrelated toxins, anthrax and Pseudomonas exotoxin. Peptides with Phe/Tyr at P1′ were more selective for furin. Peptides with P1′ Thr were potent against multiple PCs. Our strategy of basing the peptide sequence on a furin cleavage motif known for an avian flu virus shows the power of starting inhibitor design with a known substrate.

Our results confirm that inhibiting furin-like PCs protects the host from the distinct furin-dependent infections and lay a foundation for novel, host cell-focused therapies against acute diseases. Furin and related PCs are specialized serine endoproteases that cleave the multibasic motifs RX(R/K/X)R and transform proproteins into biologically active proteins and peptides (1Thomas G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). Structurally and functionally, furin resembles its evolutionary precursor: the prohormone-processing kexin of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Furin is currently the most studied enzyme of the PC family. Seven PCs (furin, PC2, PC1/3, PC4, PACE4, PC5/6, and PC7) have been identified in humans (2Fugere M. Day R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 26: 294-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Furin is expressed in all examined tissues and cell lines and is mainly localized in the trans-Golgi network. Some proportion of the furin molecules cycles between the trans-Golgi and the cell surface. Because of the overlapping substrate preferences and cell/tissue expression, there is redundancy in the PC functionality, albeit certain distinct functions of the individual PCs have also been demonstrated. Furin knockout, however, is lethal in mice (3Scamuffa N. Calvo F. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. Khatib A.M. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1954-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In addition to normal cell functions, PCs, 3The abbreviations used are: PC, proprotein convertase; Cipro, ciprofloxacin; DEC-RVKR-CMK, decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethylketone; HA, hemagglutinin; LF, lethal factor; PA, protective antigen; PEx, Pseudomonas exotoxin A; Pyr-RTKR-AMC, pyroglutamic acid-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-methylcoumaryl-7-amide; SiNPs, silica nanoparticles; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide. 3The abbreviations used are: PC, proprotein convertase; Cipro, ciprofloxacin; DEC-RVKR-CMK, decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethylketone; HA, hemagglutinin; LF, lethal factor; PA, protective antigen; PEx, Pseudomonas exotoxin A; Pyr-RTKR-AMC, pyroglutamic acid-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-methylcoumaryl-7-amide; SiNPs, silica nanoparticles; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide. including furin, are implicated in many pathogenic states, because they process to maturity membrane fusion proteins and pro-toxins of a variety of both bacteria and viruses, including anthrax and botulinum toxins and influenza A H5N1 (bird flu), flaviviruses, and Marburg and Ebola viruses (1Thomas G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). After processing by furin and the subsequent endocytic internalization in the complex with the respective cell surface receptor followed by acidification of the endosomal compartment, the processed, partially denatured, infectious proteins expose their membrane-penetrating peptide region and escape into the cytoplasm (4Collier R.J. Young J.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 45-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The intact toxins and viral proteins are incapable of accomplishing these processes. Evidence suggests that the inhibition of cellular furin prevents aggressive disease (2Fugere M. Day R. Trends Pharmacol.

These results lead to the logical suggestion that furin is a promising drug target in infectious diseases; an experimental confirmation, however, has been limited because research efforts have been focused primarily on anthrax (5Jiao G.S. Cregar L. Wang J. Millis S.Z. Tang C. O'Malley S. Johnson A.T. Sareth S. Larson J. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Because no natural protein inhibitors of furin are known, d-Arg-based peptides, α1-antitrypsin Portland, and the synthetic inhibitor decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethylketone (DEC-RVKR-CMK) are used in vitro and in cell-based tests (1Thomas G.

Here, we designed nanomolar peptide inhibitors modeled from the extended furin cleavage sequence of avian influenza A H5N1 (12Basak A. Zhong M. Munzer J.S. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. Biochem.

We then proceeded to demonstrate the efficacy of the inhibitory peptides in assays in vitro and in cell-based and animal tests. Our results suggest that furin antagonists can provide host protection against multiple furin-dependent, but otherwise unrelated pathogens. Reagents—Reagents were purchased from Sigma unless indicated otherwise. A TMB/M substrate and GM6001 were from Chemicon. The inhibitor DEC-RVKR-CMK was obtained from Bachem. The protease inhibitor mixture set III and the fluorescence peptide substrate pyroglutamic acid-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide (Pyr-RTKR-AMC) were obtained from Calbiochem. Sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)hexanoate (EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-Long Chain(LC)-biotin) was from Pierce. Anthrax PA83 and Pseudomonas exotoxin A were purchased from List Biological Laboratories. Recombinant human furin, PC5/6, PC4, and PC7, and rat PACE4 were prepared in the S2 Drosophila expression system (Invitrogen) and purified to homogeneity as described previously (15Fugere M. Limperis P.C. Beaulieu-Audy V. Gagnon F. Lavigne P. Klarskov K. Leduc R. Day R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7648-7656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of Avian Influenza A H5N1 HA—The ectodomain of HA was cloned into the baculovirus pAcGP67A transfer vector (BD Biosciences) to allow for secretion of the recombinant protein. To facilitate the yield of the HA precursor, the C-terminal region of the contract contained the bacteriophage T4 fibritin “foldon” trimerizing sequence, a thrombin cleavage site, and a His6 tag (RSLVPRGSPGSGYIPEAPRDGQAYVRKDGEWVLLSTFLGHHHHHH; the thrombin site, the T4 foldon, and His tag sequences are italicized, underlined, and shown in bold, respectively). Infection of Sf9 insect cells and virus amplification were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (BD Pharmingen). Infected cells (3 × 106 cells/ml infected at a multiplicity of infection equal to 1–3) were cultured in suspension for 3 days in 4 liters of sf900-II SFM serum-free medium (Invitrogen). Cells were then removed by centrifugation. The soluble HA was purified from the supernatant by metal affinity chromatography on an nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column followed by the Mono Q fast-protein liquid chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex-200 10/30 column equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 80 mm NaCl. The yield of the purified HA trimer was 1.5 mg/liter of cell culture. In Vitro Cleavage of PA83, HA, and PEx—PA83, HA, and Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PEx) were each labeled with EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (at a 1:20 protein-biotin molar ratio) for 30 min on ice. Biotin-labeled PA83, PEx, and HA (500 ng each) were co-incubated for 3 h at 37 °C with furin, PC7, PACE4, PC4, and PC5/6 (one unit of activity each). One unit of activity is equal to the amount of the enzyme that is required to cleave 1 pmol/min of the Pyr-RTKR-AMC substrate at 37 °C. The 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.5), and 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5) buffers were supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The cleavage was stopped by adding a 5× SDS sample buffer. The digested samples were analyzed by Western blotting with ExtrAvidin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and a 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethyl benzidine (TMB/M) substrate. Binding and Processing of PA83 by Cultured Cells—Glioma U251 cells (3 × 105) were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in serum-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with biotin-labeled PA83 (1 μg/ml). Where indicated, DEC-RVKR-CMK (20 μm) and the inhibitory peptides (2–20 μm) were added to the cells. After incubation, cells were washed and lysed in an radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 1% IGEPAL, pH 7.4) containing a protease inhibitor mixture set III, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm EDTA. To measure cell-associated PA83 and PA63, the samples were analyzed by Western blotting with ExtrAvidin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and a TMB/M substrate. Cytotoxicity Assay—Murine macrophage-like cells RAW 264.7 were grown to confluence in wells of a 48-well plate in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (16Forino M. Johnson S. Wong T.Y. Rozanov D.V. Savinov A.Y. Li W. Fattorusso R. Becattini B. Orry A.J. Jung D. Abagyan R.A. Smith J.W. Alibek K. Liddington R.C. Strongin A.Y. Pellecchia M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9499-9504Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The cells were replenished with fresh medium (0.1 ml/well) and then incubated with inhibitors for 4 h. To protect the peptide from proteolysis in vivo, the TPRARRRKKRT peptide sequence was amidated at the C terminus and had β-Ala at the N terminus. Anthrax protective antigen-83 (PA83) and lethal factor (LF) were then added to the final concentrations of 500 ng/ml and 25 ng/ml, respectively. After incubation for an additional 1 h, cell viability was assessed by using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) staining. Cells were incubated with 0.5 mg/ml MTT in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium for 45 min at 37 °C; the medium was aspirated, and the blue pigment produced by the viable cells was solubilized with 0.5% SDS/25 mm NaCl in 90% isopropyl alcohol. The concentration of oxidized MTT in the samples was measured at 570 nm. Each datum point represents the results of at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate. The percentage of viable cells was calculated by using the following equation: (A570 of cells treated with LF, PA83, and inhibitor) – (A570 of cells treated with LF and PA83) (A570 of cells treated with LF alone) – (A570 of cells treated with LF and PA83). The TPRARRRKKRT peptide alone when incubated with cells in concentrations up to 0.5 mm had no effect on cell viability. Animal Experiments with Anthrax Spores and Pseudomonas Toxin—To protect the peptide from proteolysis in vivo, the TPRARRRKKRT peptide sequence was amidated at the C terminus and had β-Ala at the N terminus. Purification of anthrax spores and the inhalation model of anthrax using A/J mice was described previously (17Sabet M. Cottam H.B. Guiney D.G. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 2006; 47: 369-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 18Wu C.C. Hayashi T. Takabayashi K. Sabet M. Smee D.F. Guiney D.D. Cottam H.B. Carson D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 3990-3995Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A/J mice (8 mice/group) received B. anthracis Sterne spores (4 × 105/animal in 20 μl of phosphate-buffered saline). On the day following infection, mice received the TPRARRRKKRT peptide (12.5 mg/kg intraperitoneal) in phosphate-buffered saline and then continued to receive injections once daily for the remainder of the experiment. Control mice received an equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline. Mice treated with ciprofloxacin (Cipro) received 25 mg/kg subcutaneous treatments daily beginning on the fourth day following infection. C57/BL6 mice (5 mice/group) received one intramuscular injection of PEx (500 ng/animal, 2× LD50) (19Gill D.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1982; 46: 86-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mice received one injection of the TPRARRRKKRT peptide (12.5 mg/kg intraperitoneal) either 24 h prior to toxin injection or simultaneously with toxin injection. An additional group of mice, after receiving one injection of the peptide 24 h prior to toxin injection, continued to receive daily injections of the peptide for the remainder of the experiment. Peptides Synthesis—A 96-well format centrifugal synthesizer and purification and characterization of the peptides were described earlier (20Hachmann J. Lebl M. Biopolymers. 2006; 84: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 21Kozlov I.A. Melnyk P.C. Zhao C. Hachmann J.P. Shevchenko V. Srinivasan A. Barker D.L. Lebl M. Comb. Chem.

Peptide synthesis was performed in wells of a 96-well flat bottom polypropylene microtiter plate (Evergreen Scientific). The peptides were amidated at the C terminus. In addition to the C-end amidation, peptides used for their attachment to silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) exhibited hydroxylaminoacetic acid at the N terminus (prepared by attachment of t-butoxycarbonyl-NHOCH2-COOH at the last step of the synthesis). The purity of the peptides was confirmed by use of reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and by mass spectrometry. The peptide for the cell-based assays and in vivo studies was synthesized manually in a plastic syringe equipped with a frit (CSPS Pharmaceuticals) using Rink resin (1 g, 0.45 mmol/g, Novabiochem). Diisopropylcarbodiimide was used for coupling (2 × 1 h) and 20% 4-methylpiperidine (20Hachmann J. Lebl M. Biopolymers. 2006; 84: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 23Hachmann J. Lebl M. J. Comb. Chem. 2006; 8: 149Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) for Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) group deprotection. Final deprotection and cleavage from the resin was performed by using Mixture K (82.5% TFA, 5% phenol, 5% H2O, 5% thioanisoee, 2.5% ethanedithioe) (24King D.S. Fields C.G. Fields G.B. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1990; 36: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). The peptide sample was precipitated and washed (5×) in ether, dissolved in 0.1 m HCl, and lyophilized. The peptide was then dissolved in 10 ml of 0.1 m HCl and purified on a Sephadex LH-20 column equilibrated in 0.1 m HCl. Fractions containing the peptide were pooled and lyophilized. High-performance liquid chromatography (μBondapak C18, Waters, 10-μm particles, 125-Å pore size, 3.9 × 150 mm, gradient 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O to 40% acetonitrile, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in 15 min, flow rate 1.5 ml/min, detection by UV at 217 nm) of the peptide determined the purity of the material to exceed 95%. Mass spectrometry analysis of the synthesized peptide confirmed the identity of the product (calculated molecular weight, 1495.81; found M + H, 1497). Protease Assays with Fluorescence Peptides—The assay for PC activity was performed using a Pyr-RTKR-AMC substrate (24 μm). The concentrations of the catalytically active proteinases were measured using a fluorescence assay by titration against a standard DEC-RVKR-CMK solution of a known concentration. The buffer for furin cleavage reactions was 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The buffer for PACE4, PC4, PC5/6, and PC7 was 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2. The total assay volume was 0.1 ml. Enzyme concentrations were 10 nm. Increasing concentrations of the inhibitory peptides were preincubated with the enzymes for 30 min. The steady-state rate of substrate hydrolysis was monitored continuously (λex = 360 nm and λem = 460 nm) using a fluorescence spectrophotometer at 37 °C. The IC50 values were derived from fitting the V0 versus log [I]t plots with sigmoidal dose-response curves, and the inhibition constant (Ki) was derived using the Cheng-Prusoff equation: Ki = IC50/(1 + [S]/Km), where V0 is the steady-state velocity of substrate hydrolysis, [I]t is the total inhibitor concentration, [S] is the substrate concentration, Km is the Michaelis-Menten constant, and Ki(app) is the apparent inhibition constant. Preparation of SiNPs and Immobilization of Peptides—A cyclohexane, Triton X-100, and n-hexanol 24.8-ml mixture (volume ratio, 4.2:1:1) was converted to a nanoemulsion by stirring at room temperature for 1 h. Water (940 μl) and tetramethyl orthosilicate (100.5 μl) were added. The mixture was sonicated for 1 h to facilitate the diffusion of tetramethyl orthosilicate into the encapsulated water droplets in the nanoemulsion. 28% NH3 in water (59 μl) was added to catalyze the hydrolysis of tetramethyl orthosilicate and condensation to form the SiNPs. The reaction mixture was stirred for 24 h, followed by the addition of tetramethyl orthosilicate (10.05 μl) and then, in 30 min, aminopropyl trimethoxysilane (11.8 μl). The mixture was stirred for an additional 24 h, and then the amino-SiNPs were precipitated by 25-ml acetone washed with water and anhydrous ethanol. The presence of amino groups on SiNPs was confirmed by using fluorescamine in methanol followed by sonication of the sample for 5 min at room temperature and fluorescence analysis (λex = 390 nm, λem = 475 nm). An aliquot of SiNPs in ethanol was placed on the lacey carbon film covering a 300-mesh copper grid (Ted Pella), and ethanol was then allowed to evaporate. Transmission electron microscopy images showed the uniform, 15 ± 1 nm diameter, amino-SiNPs. Because the density of the SiNPs is equal to pure silica (1.96 g/cm3), the molecular weight of SiNPs was calculated to be 2000 kDa. 4-Formylbenzoyl chloride/triethylamine (1:3 molar ratio) was allowed to react with amino-SiNPs in dimethyl formamide for 40 min at 0 °C and then at room temperature overnight. Aldehyde-SiNPs were separated by the addition of water to the sample and extensively washed in water. To accomplish the binding of the peptides to aldehyde-SiNPs, a suspension of aldehyde-SiNPs (∼0.2 mg/0.1 ml) was co-incubated for 48 h in a shaker with 1 mm solution of the peptides (which exhibited a hydroxylamine group) in 1 m citrate buffer, pH 5.1-Me2SO mixture (1:1, v/v). Beads were then centrifuged and washed with water. Derivatization of the Furin Cleavage Sequence—Furin and related PCs are directly implicated in many pathogenic states, because they process membrane fusion proteins and pro-toxins of a variety of pathogenic bacteria and viruses, including anthrax and the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza. Our results show that both PA83 and the HA precursor (HA0) from the H5N1 influenza virus (13Stevens J. Corper A.L. Basler C.F. Taubenberger J.K. Palese P. Wilson I.A. Science. 2004; 303: 1866-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 14Chen J. Lee K.H. Steinhauer D.A. Stevens D.J. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 409-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) are sensitive to the processing by several individual PCs as opposed to furin alone (Fig. 1). PA83 was converted to PA63 by furin and also by PC4 and PC5/6 (1 activity unit each) with an ∼90% efficiency, whereas PACE4 and PC7 (1 activity unit each) accomplished a PA83-to-PA63 conversion with an ∼70 and 40% efficiency, respectively. Both furin and PC5/6 were efficient in cleaving HA, whereas PACE4 and PC4 and, especially PC7, were much less efficient. The pathogenicity of H5N1 correlates with the extended furin cleavage motif, TPQRERRRKKR ↓ GL, within the HA sequence (12Basak A. Zhong M. Munzer J.S. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Following furin cleavage, the resulting activated HA becomes competent to initiate fusion with the host membrane. We used the extended furin cleavage sequence of HA as the starting point to obtain uncleavable peptide sequences that competitively inhibit cleavage of a fluorescent peptide substrate by furin (15Fugere M. Limperis P.C. Beaulieu-Audy V. Gagnon F. Lavigne P. Klarskov K. Leduc R. Day R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7648-7656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Alanine-scanning mutagenesis using single, double, and triple substitutions (A, AA, and AAA, respectively) was used to modify the peptide sequence. The inhibitory potency of the synthesized peptides was measured in the cleavage reaction with a fluorescent peptide substrate. The presence of the Gln residue at position P9 of the TPQRERRRKKRG cleavage motif was not necessary for inhibition. Mutagenesis of TPRERRRKKRG led us to a potent inhibitor of furin (TPRARRRKKRG, Ki = 57 nm). The sequences and the Ki values of the peptides are shown in Fig. 2, Table 1 and in supplemental Table S1. The inhibitory potency of TPRARRRKKRG against furin and other purified PCs (PACE4, PC4, PC5/6, and PC7) was improved further by substitution of the P1′ C-terminal glycine by several other amino acid residues, including threonine (TPRARRRKKRT, Ki = 23 nm) (Fig. 2 and supplemental Table S2). Other PCs (PACE4, PC4, PC5/6, and PC7) were also inhibited but with less efficiency (Table 1). Overall, peptides with aromatic C-terminal residues (Phe or Tyr) were more selective for furin, whereas TPQRARRRKKRT and TPRARRRKKRT were potent pan-inhibitors of PCs (Ki = 150–300 nm) (Table 1). Co-incubation of the peptides with furin followed by mass spectrometry analysis showed that the inhibitory peptides were resistant to furin proteolysis (not shown).TABLE 1Ki values of the inhibitory peptides against PCsPeptideKiFurinPACE4PC4PC5/6PC7μmTPRARRRKKRI0.0300.2670.5620.4920.135TPRARRRKKRT0.0230.1620.4410.2320.152TPQRARRRKKRT0.0330.2960.5150.1880.206TPQRARRRKKRW0.0340.1920.9520.4330.172TPQRARRRKKRF0.0380.6020.7720.8061.133TPQRARRRKKRY0.0471.0200.6240.6491.220 Open table in a new tab Cell-based and in Vivo Activity Tests—We next determined if the HA-derived peptides could inhibit intoxication by two unrelated pathogens, anthrax and Pseudomonas toxins. Host cleavage of anthrax PA83 by PCs is a prerequisite for the translocation of the toxic enzymes, LF and edema factor, into the host cell cytosol (4Collier R.J. Young J.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 45-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). It is well established that, following its binding with the cell receptor, furin cleavage of PA83 occurs directly at the cell membrane rather than in the intracellular milieu (25Bradley K.A. Young J.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 65: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In our tests, U251 cells, which in addition to furin, PC5/6, and PC7 express sufficient levels anthrax toxin receptor (26Remacle A.G. Rozanov D.V. Fugere M. Day R. Strongin A.Y. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 5648-5655Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), were allowed to bind and process PA83. The amounts of cell-associated PA83 and PA63 were determined by Western blotting. Thus, using a cell-based assay in U251 cells, we determined that at a 20 μm concentration TPRARRRKKRX peptides with C-terminal Phe, Trp, Thr, and Tyr accomplished a near complete inhibition of PA83 processing by cellular PCs (Fig. 3A). Consistent with inactivation of cell surface PCs and subsequent PA83 processing, the TPRARRRKKRT peptide inhibited delivery of the PA63·LF complex into the cytosol and protected cells from LF-induced cytotoxicity (Fig. 3B) with an efficiency similar to that of GM6001 (16Forino M. Johnson S. Wong T.Y. Rozanov D.V. Savinov A.Y. Li W. Fattorusso R. Becattini B. Orry A.J. Jung D. Abagyan R.A. Smith J.W. Alibek K. Liddington R.C. Strongin A.Y. Pellecchia M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9499-9504Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Because of its inhibitory activity (27Turk B.E. Wong T.Y. Schwarzenbacher R. Jarrell E.T. Leppla S.H. Collier R.J. Liddington R.C. Cantley L.C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), GM6001, a hydroxamate inhibitor of the LF metalloproteinase (2–5 μm), also rescued cells from LF intoxication and was used as a control. The peptide alone at concentrations ≤0.5 mm displayed no toxicity and had no effect on cell viability (not shown). We next tested the peptide in a mouse model of inhalation anthrax. A/J mice (8 mice/group) received B. anthracis Sterne spores (4 × 105/animal). On the day following infection, mice received the TPRARRRKKRT peptide (12.5 mg/kg intraperitoneal) and then continued to receive injections once daily for the remainder of the experiment. Mice treated with antibiotic Cipro received 25 mg/kg subcutaneous treatments daily beginning on the fourth day following infection. This post-exposure peptide plus Cipro regimen protected 90% of the infected mice from disease, compared with 40% using either the peptide or Cipro alone (Fig. 3C). We carried out a similar set of experiments with an unrelated toxin, Pseudomonas exotoxin A, the processing of which occurs in the intracellular milieu. Consistent with the earlier data (28Chiron M.F. Fryling C.M. FitzGerald D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31707-31711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 29Fogle M.R.

Immun. 1995; 63: 82-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), PEx was resistant to PC cleavage at pH 7.5 but following unfolding at pH 5.5 PEx (66 kDa) was readily processed by furin, PC4, and PC5/6 to produce the 28-kDa N-terminal fragment and the toxic 37-kDa C-terminal fragment (Fig. 4A). As expected, furin proteolysis of PEx was inhibited by the TPRARRRKKRT peptide in the cleavage reaction in vitro (data not shown). To demonstrate the efficacy of the peptide in vivo, C57/BL6 mice (5 mice/group) received one intramuscular injection of PEx (500 ng/animal, 2× LD50) (19Gill D.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1982; 46: 86-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and one injection of the TPRARRRKKRT peptide (12.5 mg/kg intraperitoneally) either 24 h prior to toxin injection or simultaneously with toxin injection. Another group of mice, after receiving one injection of the peptide 24 h prior to toxin injection, continued to receive daily injections of the peptide for the remainder of the experiment. Daily injections of the peptide provided protection (60% survival) from the lethal action of PEx, demonstrating efficacy against a second, otherwise unrelated, furin-dependent pathogen (Fig. 4B). Immobilization on the Peptides on Silica Nanoparticles—Given that cell surface-associated PCs in bronchial epithelial cells are the first to encounter inhaled pathogens, we suggest the development of an inhalation drug that could be used for acute treatment or for prophylactic use in civilian or battlefield settings. We investigated peptide immobilization on SiNPs, which have been widely used for biosensing and catalytic applications (31Bottini M. Magrini A. Di Venere A. Bellucci S. Dawson M.I. Rosato N.

When peptides with either the GGG or the GGGGGG and GAGAGA linkers were immobilized on 15 nm diameter 4-formylbenzoyl chloride-activated SiNPs with a density of ∼100 peptide molecules/particle (Fig. 5), the inhibitory efficacy of the immobilized peptides against furin was similar on a molar basis to that of the soluble peptides. Immobilization without a linker reduced the inhibitory efficacy (Table 2). Similar to soluble peptides, the immobilized TPRARRRKKRT peptide inhibited PA83 processing by furin (Fig. 6). SiNPs showed no cell toxicity, even at high concentrations (e.g. 50 nm SiNPs (3 × 1017 SiNP particles)/100,000 cells).TABLE 2Ki values of the soluble and immobilized peptides against furinPeptideN-terminal linker, KiNoneGGG-GGGGGG-GAGAGA-μmPeptide aloneTPRARRRKKRT0.0230.0390.0660.047TPRARRRKKRF0.0380.0670.0450.056TPRARRRKKRY0.0470.0420.0540.057TPQRARRRKKRW0.0340.0670.0880.127Peptide on nanobeadsTPRARRRKKRT4.91.992.322.57TPRARRRKKRW3.854.289.09NDaND, not determined.a ND, not determined.

Furin is enriched in the Golgi apparatus and also on cell surfaces where it functions to cleave a number of functionally important cellular proteins, including proteinases, integrins, signaling receptors, growth factors, hormones, and neuropeptides, into their respective mature forms. In addition to furin, six additional, albeit less characterized, furin-related PCs are known in humans. In addition to processing cellular precursor proteins, PCs are also utilized by a number of pathogens. Pathogens or their toxins, including viruses and bacterial toxins, exploit host PCs to become fully functional and to allow entry into host cells and to cause disease onset. The low pathogenicity viral subtypes have mutations in the cleavage site sequence and thus a reduced sensitivity to furin (12Basak A. Zhong M. Munzer J.S. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Overall, proteolytic processing by furin is an important determinant in the pathogenicity of viruses and bacterial toxins. To develop sharply focused and specific antagonists of pathogen entry, we developed nanomolar range peptide inhibitors of host cell furin and furin-related PCs. For these purposes, we modified the sequence of the extended furin cleavage sequence of avian influenza A H5N1 HA. HA is synthesized as a precursor molecule (HA0), which undergoes proteolytic processing into two subunits (HA1 and HA2), which are held together by disulfide bonds (33Leikina E. Ramos C. Markovic I. Zimmerberg J. Chernomordik L.V. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5701-5710Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Without proteolysis, the acid-triggered conformational change of HA that occurs in the endosomes and that exposes the fusion peptide cannot occur, and the virus is non-infectious. The resulting competitive inhibitors TPRARRRKKRX with C-terminal Phe, Trp, Thr, and Tyr were highly potent not only against furin but also against related PCs, including PACE4, PC4, PC5/6, and PC7. These inhibitors were capable of efficiently inhibiting furin proteolysis of anthrax PA83 and avian influenza H5N1 HA in vitro. The peptide inhibitors protected cells from LF-induced cytotoxicity. Most importantly, we then confirmed the efficacy of the inhibitory peptides in mice in vivo against two unrelated toxins, anthrax and Pseudomonas exotoxin. Because cell surface-associated PCs in bronchial epithelial cells are the first to encounter inhaled pathogens, including influenza A H5N1 (bird flu), we developed an inhaled, nanoparticle-immobilized drug to minimize potential side-effects and optimize delivery. The specific furin inhibitors we designed are superior relative to d-Arg-peptides, which have been shown to cross-react with multiple host and pathogen targets, including both furin and anthrax lethal factor (6Peinado J.R. Kacprzak M.M. Leppla S.H. Lindberg I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 321: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In summary, we have shown that peptides based on the cleavage motif of avian influenza H5N1 HA are efficient inhibitors of host cell furin and related PCs and that these inhibitors inhibit manifestation of toxicity by PC-dependent, but otherwise unrelated, pathogens. Our results support and extend the earlier, albeit less conclusive, observations by other authors (6Peinado J.R. Kacprzak M.M. Leppla S.H. Lindberg I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 321: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 7Sarac M.S. Cameron A. Lindberg I. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 7136-7139Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 8Sarac M.S.

Because furin is likely essential for normal cell functions in adults, we suggest that our results represent a proof-of-principal from which novel, short-term therapeutics and prophylactics of furin-dependent acute disease pathogens, including anthrax, bird flu, Marburg, Ebola, and flaviviral infections will emerge (35Kandel R.

PAK3 is implicated in dendritic spine morphogenesis and is a key regulator of synaptic functions. However, the underlying roles of PAK3 in these processes remain poorly understood. We report here that the three mutations R419X, A365E, and R67C, responsible for mental retardation have different effects on the biological functions of PAK3.

We also report that PAK3 binds significantly more Cdc42 than Rac1 and is selectively activated by endogenous Cdc42, suggesting that PAK3 is a specific effector of Cdc42. Interestingly, the expression of the three mutated proteins in hippocampal neurons affects spinogenesis differentially. Both kinase-dead mutants slightly decrease the number of spines but profoundly alter spine morphology, whereas expression of the R67C mutant drastically decreases spine density.

These results demonstrate that the Cdc42/PAK3 is a key module in dendritic spine formation and synaptic plasticity. The number, shape, and structure of dendritic spines change in response to synaptic activity, and anomalies of spine morphogenesis are often associated with cognitive defects, such as mental retardation, Alzheimer disease, Down syndrome, autism, and schizophrenia (1Purpura D.P.

PAK3 is a member of the PAKs group I, which are effectors of Rac1 and Cdc42 GTPases. Interestingly, inhibition of PAKs by expression of an inhibitory peptide in postnatal forebrains impaired synaptic plasticity (10Hayashi M.L. Choi S.Y. Rao B.S. Jung H.Y. Lee H.K. Zhang D.

PAKs also play a fundamental role in cognitive deficits in Alzheimer disease (11McPhie D.L. Coopersmith R. Hines-Peralta A. Chen Y. Ivins K.J. Manly S.P. Kozlowski M.R. Neve K.A. Neve R.L. J.

Concerning PAK3, reduction of its expression or expression of a PAK3 kinase-dead mutant induced abnormal elongated dendritic spines and decreased mature spine synapses (13Boda B. Alberi S.

PAK3 knockdown and knock-out experiments induce abnormal long term potentiation, indicating a major role for PAK3 in synaptic plasticity (13Boda B. Alberi S. Nikonenko I. Node-Langlois R. Jourdain P.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 6641-6650Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). How PAK3 regulates spinogenesis and synaptic plasticity is still unknown. To address this question, we introduced the three identified mental retardation mutations into the PAK3 gene and analyzed their effects on the functions of PAK3. Two mutations, R419X and A365E, are located in the kinase domain, whereas the third one, R67C, is present in the regulatory domain, at the N-terminal end of the p21-GTPase-binding domain (PBD). We show that the two mutations R419X and A365E completely inactivate the catalytic function of the kinase. We also report that Cdc42 is the main activator of PAK3 and that the R67C mutation severely impairs PAK3 binding to Cdc42 and the subsequent activation of PAK3. Interestingly, whereas the mutated proteins are normally localized in dendritic spines, their expression in hippocampal neurons of organotypic slice cultures induces different phenotypes. Our data delineate a new pathway linking the Cdc42 GTPase to PAK3 in dendritic spine morphogenesis. Antibodies—Antibodies to HA (12CA5) were purchased from Roche Diagnostics (Meylan, France). The anti-PAK3-N19 antibody directed against the 19 N-terminal amino acids and the GFP antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Tebu, Le Perray en Yvelines, France); the monoclonal anti-HA-7-agarose conjugate and the polyclonal anti-FLAG (F7425) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, the monoclonal anti-Cdc42 and anti-Rac1 were obtained from BD Biosciences. Plasmid Constructions—All PAK3 constructs were derived from the mouse PAK3 gene, without alternatively spliced exon, herein named as PAK3 (16Rousseau V. Goupille O. Morin N. Barnier J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3912-3920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). All of the PAK3 mutants were generated from the pHA-PAK3a plasmid previously described (16Rousseau V. Goupille O. Morin N. Barnier J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3912-3920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) with Pfu polymerase (Promega, Charbonnieres, France), using procedures based upon the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and confirmed by sequencing. The mutations introduced into PAK3 include the three mutations responsible for mental retardation: R67C (oligonucleotide set: 5′-ccaataagaagaaagagaaagagtgcccagagatctctcttcc-3′ and 5′-ggaagagagatctctgggcactctttctctttcttcttattgg-3′) leading to the HA-PAK3a-R67C plasmid; A365E (oligonucleotide set: 5′-gtatggatgaaggacagatagaagctgtctgtagagagtgcc-3′ and 5′-ggcactctctacagacagcttctatctgtccttcatccatac-3′) leading to the HA-PAK3a-A365E plasmid; R419X (oligonucleotide set: 5′-cactcctgagcaaagtaaatgaagcactatggtgggaac-3′ and 5′-gttcccaccatagtgcttcatttactttgctcaggagtg-3′) leading to the HA-PAK3-R419X plasmid. The PAK3 double mutant H78L-H81L was generated with the oligonucleotide set: 5′-ctcttccttcagactttgagctcacgattcttgtgggttttgatgcagtcac-3′ and 5′-gtgactgcatcaaaacccacaagaatcgtgagctcaaagtctgaaggaagag-3′, leading to the HA-PAK3-H78L-H81L plasmid. The HA-PAK3-K297L plasmid containing the mutation K297L leading to a kinase dead construct was previously described (16Rousseau V. Goupille O. Morin N. Barnier J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3912-3920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The BamHI/XbaI fragments of the different HA-tagged PAK3 constructs described above were subcloned into the BamHI/XbaI-linearized pEGFP vector (Clontech, Ozyme, St. Quentin en Yvelines, France), to obtain GFP-tagged PAK3 plasmids named GFP-PAK3-wt, GFP-PAK3-R67C, GFP-PAK3-A365E, GFP-PAK3-R419X, GFP-PAK3-H78L-H81L, and GFP-PAK3-K297L. The p3x-FLAG-Tiam1-C580 was obtained by subcloning Tiam1 C580 insert, corresponding to the DH-PH domain, from pUT SV1-Tiam1 C580 (a gift from J. Collard, The Netherland Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) into the p3xFLAG-myc-CMV-24 expression vector (Sigma-Aldrich) using NotI restriction sites. Yeast expression plasmids containing the PAK3-wt, PAK3-H78L-H81L, or PAK3-R67C cDNAs fused in-frame to the Gal4-activation domain were obtained by ligation into vector pGAD3S2X (a gift from J. Camonis, Institut Curie, Paris, France) after BamHI/XbaI digestion. The GTPase plasmids in GFP and LexA vectors were kindly provided by P. Fort (Centre de Recherche de Biochimie Macromoléculaire (CRBM), Montpellier, France) and in the latter constructs, the coding sequences were modified to allow nuclear localization of GTPases. The plasmid coding for the Intersectin DH-PH domain, pCGN-ITSN1L(DH-PH), was kindly provided by J. O’Bryan (University of Illinois College of Medicine, Chicago, IL). The red fluorescent protein (mRFP1)-actin plasmid was a gift from C. Gauthier-Rouviere (CRBM), and mRFP1 was a gift from R.Y. Tsien (Howard Hughes Medical Institute Laboratories, San Diego, CA). Cell Culture, Transfection, and Confocal Imaging for COS7 Cells and Dissociated Hippocampal Neurons—Culture and transfection of COS7 cells were done as previously described (16Rousseau V. Goupille O. Morin N. Barnier J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3912-3920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Plasmid expression was limited to 30 h to avoid protein over expression. Primary cultures of dissociated hippocampal neurons were prepared from embryonic day 18 (E18) rats as reported by Goslin and Banker (17Goslin K. Asmussen H. Banker G. Culturing Nerve Cells. 1998; (, 2nd Ed., MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, pp.): 339-370Google Scholar). Cultures were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) at 7 days in vitro (DIV) and fixed at DIV 21. Alternatively, transfection at DIV 18 gave rise to the same results. The neurons, cultured DIV 21, display spines that possess the characteristics of mature synapses. Indeed, in these cultures, we observed actin concentration in spines, PSD-95 aggregates in the spine head, and electrophysiological recordings show functional synaptic transmission (18Poea-Guyon S. Amar M. Fossier P. Morel N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17164-17172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Simultaneous transfection of the RFP-actin plasmid was used to confirm the presence of spines in transfected neurons. RFP-actin and tagged GFP wild-type or mutant PAK3 cDNA expression plasmids were co-transfected at a ratio of 1:2. Imaging was carried out with a Leica (Mannheim, Germany) confocal microscope using the 488 nm band of an argon laser and the 561 nm band of a diode-pumped solid-state laser for excitation of GFP or RFP, respectively. Well differentiated and simultaneous transfected neurons were chosen, and images were acquired with a 63× objective (1.4 numerical aperture). Because dendritic spines often cross several z planes, we took z series stacks of 1-1.5 μm (typically 5-8 frames) from the bottom to the top of dendrites and used Image J software to generate image projections. Hippocampal Slice Cultures, Transfection, Image Acquisition, and Analysis—Rat organotypic hippocampal slice cultures were prepared as described by Stoppini et al. (19Stoppini L. Buchs P.A. Muller D. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1991; 37: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2529) Google Scholar). Cultures were maintained 11-12 days in vitro and transfected using a gene gun (Bio-Rad) technique according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Plasmid DNAs at a ratio of 20 μg of pcDNA3.1-EGFP to 40 μg of HA-PAK3 constructs were precipitated onto 10 mg of 1.6-μm gold microcarriers. Transfection of 10-30 cells per slice culture was reproducibly obtained, and expression was stable until 7-8 days. Control experiments showed that cells co-transfected with EGFP and DsRed constructs expressed green and red fluorescence in all cases (n = 7). Two days after transfection hippocampal organotypic cultures were submerged in a chamber perfused with an extracellular medium containing (in mm): 124 NaCl, 1.6 KCl, 2.5 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 24 NaHCO3, 1.2 KH2PO4, 10 glucose, and 2 ascorbic acid, saturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2, pH 7.4, temperature of 33 °C. Imaging of dendritic segments was performed through a60× water immersion objective using a Visitron (Puchheim, Germany) spinning disk confocal system. Control experiments showed that repetitive imaging under those conditions did not affect the morphology or viability of transfected cells. Z-stacks of 50- to 200-μm-long dendritic segments were taken on secondary and tertiary dendrites of pyramidal neurons, and the characteristics of dendritic protrusions were measured using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA). The parameters analyzed were protrusion (spines and filopodia) density and length, measured from the limit of the dendrite to the tip of the protrusion. Cell Lysis, Immunoprecipitation, Kinase Assay, Pulldown, and Immunoblotting Analysis—Transfected cells were lysed as previously described (16Rousseau V. Goupille O. Morin N. Barnier J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3912-3920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In some experiments, to activate the kinase, cleared cell extracts of PAK3-transfected cells were incubated with increasing amounts of recombinant Cdc42-V12 in the presence of 25 μm ATP during 30 min at room temperature. Extracts were then immunoprecipitated by incubating them with 4 μl of 12CA5 anti-HA antibody and 50 μl of protein G-agarose (Sigma-Aldrich) overnight at 4 °C. After washing the immunocomplexes, aliquots were subjected to immunoblotting to ensure that PAK proteins were correctly expressed and immunoprecipitated. Protein samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences, GE Healthcare Europe, Orsay, France). Immunodetection was performed using the SuperSignal chemiluminescent reagent (Pierce, Perbio Science, Berbieres, France). Quantification of chemiluminescence was performed after acquisition with a charge-coupled device camera GeneGnome (Syngene, Ozyme, Voisin le Bretonneux, France) using quantification software (GeneSnap and GeneTools, Syn-Gene, Ozyme). GST-Cdc42-V12 recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli -BL21LysS and purified on glutathione-agarose beads as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences, GE Healthcare Europe). For kinase reactions, immunoprecipitates were washed one more time in the kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 25 mm MgCl2, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm orthovanadate). Immunoprecipitates were then incubated in the kinase buffer containing 20 μm ATP and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences, GE Healthcare Europe) for 20 min at 30 °C, in the absence or in the presence of 3 μg of H2B (Sigma-Aldrich) or 3 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP) (Sigma) as a substrate. Boiling in SDS-Laemmli sample buffer stopped the reaction, and the products were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The incorporation of 32P was quantified using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Co-immunoprecipitation was performed as previously described (16Rousseau V. Goupille O. Morin N. Barnier J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3912-3920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS7 cells were transfected with 5 μg of active GFP-tagged Rac1 or Cdc42 along with 5 μg of HA-tagged PAK3 constructs. Cell lysates in Robert’s lysis buffer were immunoprecipitated overnight with anti-HA-agarose conjugate. Immune complexes were separated by electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Western blotting analysis was performed with anti-PAK3 N19 antibodies to detect PAK3, anti-HA (12CA5) to identify HA-PAK3 and HA-ITSN proteins, anti-GFP antibodies to detect co-precipitated Cdc42 or Rac1 proteins, and anti-FLAG (F7425 from Sigma) to reveal FLAG-Tiam1. Pulldown assays to determine the active Cdc42 and Rac1 levels in cell lysates expressing intersectin or Tiam1 were performed using GST-PBD-PAK3 as described (16Rousseau V. Goupille O. Morin N.

Two-hybrid Analysis—Transformants were grown on tryptophan/leucine drop-out agar plates (Clontech, San Francisco, CA) for 3 days at 30 °C. The interactions were assessed using liquid culture β-galactosidase assays with O-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma-Aldrich) as the substrate, according to the Clontech protocol. β-Galactosidase activity was quantified by spectrophotometer readings and converted to β-galactosidase units by normalizing to the number of cells. The interaction of PAK3-wt with Cdc42-V12 was defined to be 100%. Experiments were repeated three times in triplicate. Differential Effects of PAK3 Mental Retardation Mutations on Its Kinase Activity—The three mutations responsible for mental retardation are located in different functional regions of the PAK3 protein (Fig. 1A). The first mutation, located in the catalytic domain, generates a stop codon TGA at the position coding for arginine 419 (R419X), leading to a truncated protein, which is devoid of kinase activity (7Allen K.M. Gleeson J.G. Bagrodia S. Partington M.W. MacMillan J.C. Cerione R.A. Mulley J.C. Walsh C.A. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The second mutation, in the kinase domain, corresponds to a substitution of a conserved alanine residue to a glutamate (A365E) (9Gedeon A.K. Nelson J. Gecz J. Mulley J.C. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2003; 120A: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The third mutation present at the extremity of the PBD domain mutates the arginine 67 to a cysteine residue (R67C) (8Bienvenu T. des Portes V. McDonell N. Carrie A. Zemni R. Couvert P. Ropers H.H. Moraine C. van Bokhoven H. Fryns J.P. Allen K. Walsh C.A. Boue J. Kahn A. Chelly J. Beldjord C. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2000; 93: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The molecular defects associated with the A365E and R67C mutations have not yet been described. To assess the effects of the three mutations R419X, A365E, and R67C, on the biochemical properties of PAK3, we introduced them into the coding sequence of the PAK3 gene. We compared these new mutated forms to two well described PAK mutants: the kinase-dead mutant PAK3-K297L and a GTPase-deficient binding mutant PAK3-H78L-H81L (20Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28191-28198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). To analyze their respective kinase activity, the different PAK3 mutants were co-expressed in COS7 cells with constitutively active V12 or inactive N17 forms of Cdc42. Kinase assay were performed with HA-immunoprecipitated PAK3 proteins using the MBP as substrate (Fig. 1B). The wild-type PAK3 protein is strongly activated when co-expressed with Cdc42-V12, whereas no activity is detected when co-expressed with the inactive N17 form of the GTPase. As expected, the PAK3-K297L and the PAK3-R419X proteins had no detectable kinase activity. We also report here that the A365E mutation completely abolished the kinase activity of PAK3. Surprisingly, the PAK3-R67C protein showed the same kinase activity as the wild-type protein when it was co-expressed with Cdc42-V12 (R67C: 110 ± 12.4% compared with wild-type). Kinase assays measured by autophosphorylation confirmed these results (supplemental Fig. S1A). We observed similar activation of wild-type PAK3 and PAK3-R67C when they were co-expressed with Rac1-V12 (supplemental Fig. S1B). Thus, contrary to the R419X and A365E mutants, which are devoid of kinase activity, the kinase activity of the R67C mutant is similar to that of the wild-type PAK3 protein, in these experimental conditions. PAK3 Binds More Efficiently Cdc42 than Rac1—Despite its full activation when Cdc42 was overexpressed, the location of the R67C substitution at the NH2 extremity of the PBD suggested that this mutation may impair the binding of PAK3 to the GTPases and its activation. We first quantitatively compared the interaction of constitutively active or inactive Rac1 and Cdc42 to the wild-type PAK3 protein using a liquid β-galactosidase two-hybrid assay (Fig. 2A). We verified that inactive forms N17 of Rac1 and Cdc42 did not bind PAK3 (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S2). We also verified that the PAK3-H78L-H81L protein, impaired in GTPase binding, did not interact with Cdc42-V12 or Rac1-V12 (supplemental Fig. S2). As shown in Fig. 2A, the wild-type PAK3 protein interacts strongly with the active Cdc42 bait. In contrast, the interaction with the active form of Rac1 is very faint, ∼2% of the interaction between PAK3 and Cdc42. Quantification of these different interactions are presented in supplementary data (supplemental Fig. S2C). To confirm that the PAK3 protein binds more strongly Cdc42 than Rac1, HA-PAK3 co-expressed with active forms of GFP-Rac1 and GFP-Cdc42 were immunoprecipitated, and isolated complexes were analyzed for the presence of the associated GTPases (Fig. 2B). Because the interaction of PAK proteins with the GTPases could be regulated by autophosphorylation, we used kinase-dead mutants of PAK3 (K297L) (22Jung J.H. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40025-40031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Quantification of co-immunoprecipitated GTPases showed that the amount of Cdc42 bound to PAK3 is 10-fold higher than Rac1 (the interaction with Rac1 reached 11 ± 0.58% of the normalized interaction with Cdc42) (Fig. 2C). The R67C Mutation Decreases Cdc42 Binding to PAK3—We next analyzed the interaction of the PAK3-R67C protein with Rac1 and Cdc42 GTPases using the liquid β-galactosidase two-hybrid assay and co-immunoprecipitation. Interestingly, we show that the R67C mutation decreased the binding of PAK3 to Cdc42 (Fig. 3A). This interaction decreased to 70% compared with the interaction with wild-type PAK3. However, the binding of PAK3-R67C to Rac1 was not significantly different from PAK3-wt and remained faint. To confirm this result, we examined GTPase co-immunoprecipitation with PAK3 proteins from co-transfected COS7 cells. We verified that Cdc42-V12 and Rac1-V12 did not bind the PAK3-H78L-H81L protein (Fig. 3, B and D). In agreement with the two-hybrid assays, we found a strong decrease of the amount of Cdc42 co-immunoprecipitated with PAK3-R67C (down to 40%) (Fig. 3C). However, in these conditions PAK3-R67C binds five times more Rac1 than the wild-type PAK3 protein does (Fig. 3, D and E). We also analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation the interaction of Cdc42 with the three kinase-dead mutants PAK3-K297L, PAK3-R419X, and PAK3-A365E. We found that these mutations did not impair the binding of PAK3 with this GTPase in agreement with the first characterization of the interaction of PAK3 with Cdc42 (supplemental Fig. S3) (7Allen K.M.

Leung T. Michael G. Hall C. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25070-25078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Altogether our results demonstrate that PAK3 binds Cdc42 more efficiently than Rac1 and that the R67C mutation significantly decreased the binding of PAK3 to Cdc42 and increased the binding to Rac1. R67C Mutation Impairs Kinase Activation by Cdc42—Although the R67C protein is activated when Cdc42-V12 is co-expressed in COS7 cells (Fig. 1B), the interaction with this GTPase is weak (Fig. 3, A and B). This apparent discrepancy could be explained by the high expression level of Cdc42-V12, which may bypass the loss of affinity of PAK3-R67C for Cdc42-V12. To more precisely control the amount of Cdc42 used to activate PAK3, we performed an in vitro kinase assay, by adding increasing amounts of GST-Cdc42-V12 to transfected cell lysates. Hence, lysates of COS7 cells expressing PAK3-wt or PAK3-R67C were incubated without Cdc42 or with a precise amount of GST-Cdc42-V12 protein before performing the kinase assay. As shown in Fig. 4A, PAK3-R67C is significantly less activated by Cdc42-V12 than the wild-type protein, under these conditions. To analyze the in vivo activation of PAK3 by endogenous Cdc42 and Rac1, we took advantage of the ability of the guanine exchange factors (GEFs), intersectin and Tiam1, to promote specific activation of Cdc42 and Rac1, respectively (24Michiels F. Habets G.G. Stam J.C. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 338-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 25Hussain N.K. Jenna S. Glogauer M. Quinn C.C. Wasiak S. Guipponi M. Antonarakis S.E. Kay B.K. Stossel T.P. Lamarche-Vane N. McPherson P.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). We verified the specificity of the GEFs by monitoring the levels of active Cdc42 and Rac1 in a pulldown assay using GST-PBD-PAK3 to sequester active GTP-bound GTPases. The overexpression of Tiam1 caused an increase in endogenous levels of Rac1-GTP but not Cdc42-GTP, whereas the expression of intersectin stimulated the production of Cdc42-GTP and to a lesser extent Rac1-GTP (Fig. 4B). The activation of Rac1 by intersectin is due to an endogenous activation of Rac1 by Cdc42 (26Czuchra A. Wu X. Meyer H. van Hengel J. Schroeder T. Geffers R. Rottner K. Brakebusch C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4473-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To analyze the activation of PAK3 by intersectin and Tiam1, we performed kinase assays with the standard substrate histone 2B. The same results were obtained with the substrate MBP (data not shown). We observed that the co-transfection of PAK3 wild type with the constitutively active form of intersectin induced an increase of its kinase activity. Interestingly, the R67C-mutated protein was not activated in these conditions (Fig. 4, C and D). However, the expression of the constitutively active form of Tiam1 did not activate either PAK3 wild-type or R67C mutant (Fig. 4, E and F). Taken together, our results prove that PAK3 is mainly activated by the intersectin-Cdc42 module and that the R67C mutation, which inhibits the binding of PAK3 to Cdc42, impairs PAK3 activation. Moreover, although the R67C mutation increases the binding of PAK3 to Rac1 (Fig. 3D), it doesn't allow an activation of PAK3 by the Tiam1-Rac1 module. Thus, the main molecular defect of the R67C protein is its absence of activation by Cdc42 due to a decrease of its affinity to this GTPase.

Because of the size and diversity of the eicosanoid class of signaling molecules produced, a thorough and systematic investigation of these biological processes requires the simultaneous quantitation of a large number of eicosanoids in a single analysis. We have developed a robust liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method that can identify and quantitate over 60 different eicosanoids in a single analysis, and we applied it to agonist-stimulated RAW264.7 murine macrophages. Fifteen different eicosanoids produced through COX and 5-LO were detected either intracellularly or in the media following stimulation with 16 different agonists of Toll-like receptors (TLR), G protein-coupled receptors, and purinergic receptors. No significant differences in the COX metabolite profiles were detected using the different agonists; however, we determined that only agonists creating a sustained Ca(2+) influx were capable of activating the 5-LO pathway in these cells. Synergy between Ca(2+) and TLR pathways was detected and discovered to be independent of NF-kappaB-induced protein synthesis. This demonstrates that TLR induction of protein synthesis and priming for enhanced phospholipase A(2)-mediated eicosanoid production work through two distinct pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1977328687,"Abstract The heme protein indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is induced by the proinflammatory cytokine interferon-γ (IFNγ) and plays an important role in the immune response by catalyzing the oxidative degradation of l-tryptophan (Trp) that contributes to immune suppression and tolerance. Here we examined the mechanism by which nitric oxide (NO) inhibits human IDO activity. Exposure of IFNγ-stimulated human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) to NO donors had no material impact on IDO mRNA or protein expression, yet exposure of MDM or transfected COS-7 cells expressing active human IDO to NO donors resulted in reversible inhibition of IDO activity. NO also inhibited the activity of purified recombinant human IDO (rhIDO) in a reversible manner and this correlated with NO binding to the heme of rhIDO. Optical absorption and resonance Raman spectroscopy identified NO-inactivated rhIDO as a ferrous iron (FeII)-NO-Trp adduct. Stopped-flow kinetic studies revealed that NO reacted most rapidly with FeII rhIDO in the presence of Trp. These findings demonstrate that NO inhibits rhIDO activity reversibly by binding to the active site heme to trap the enzyme as an inactive nitrosyl-FeII enzyme adduct with Trp bound and O2 displaced. Reversible inhibition by NO may represent an important mechanism in controlling the immune regulatory actions of IDO."

The amplicon was first subcloned in pGEM®-T Easy vector (Promega) and then cloned between the NcoI and NotI sites of the pETM11 expression vector. Fusion protein containing an N-terminal His tag was expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) and extracted from inclusion bodies using 8 m urea, pH 8, as described (15Schrodel A. Volz J. de Marco A. J.

Anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, and anti-rat IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Promega) were used at 1/15,000, 1/30,000, and 1/15,000 dilutions, respectively. Relative protein band quantitation was done using the Phoretix 1D software. Measurements of PO Activity—PO activity was assayed 6 h post-challenge with a mixture of S. aureus and E. coli (each at A600 = 0.4) or PBS (control). Hemolymph was collected in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing protease inhibitors, and protein concentration was determined using the protein assay kit from Bio-Rad. Five μg of total hemolymph proteins in 40 μl of PBS containing protease inhibitors were mixed with 120 μl of saturated l-3,4-dihydroxiphenylalanine solution; absorbance at 492 nm was measured after incubation at room temperature for 30 min. Survival Experiments—E. coli and S. aureus were cultured to A600 = 0.7, pelleted, washed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline to the indicated concentrations. Bacterial infections and survival assays were done as described (12Blandin S. Moita L.F. Kocher T. Wilm M. Kafatos F.C. Levashina E.A.

CLIPA8, a Hemolymph Protein, Is Cleaved by Wounding and Bacterial Infections—Immunoblotting of hemolymph from naive mosquitoes (Fig. 1A, c lane) revealed a full-length CLIPA8 protein (CLIPA8-F) with an apparent molecular mass of 47 kDa. However, soon after S. aureus injection into mosquitoes, a cleaved form of CLIPA8 (CLIPA8-C) corresponding to the noncatalytic protease domain appeared at 38 kDa in immunoblotted hemolymph extracted in reducing SDS buffer (Fig. 1A). Quantitative analysis of band intensity (Fig. 1A, bar graph) revealed that the CLIPA8-C levels increased after S. aureus infection, peaked at 6 h, and returned to the basal level by 24 h post-infection. Furthermore, CLIPA8 mRNA expression peaked at 12 h post-infection with S. aureus and E. coli (2.5- and 1.7-fold, respectively, relative to PBS-injected controls) and remained relatively high at 24 h post-infection (Fig. 2). In contrast, CLIPA8-F did not increase in response to infection (data not shown), suggesting that the observed transcriptional induction during this immune response may serve protein replenishment rather than accumulation. Both CLIPA8-F and CLIPA8-C are absent from hemolymph of mosquitoes treated with double-stranded (ds) CLIPA8 RNA (Fig. 1B, lane 6). Further analysis revealed that CLIPA8 cleavage in the hemolymph is induced robustly by additional bacterial species, including E. coli, E. cloacae, and E. faecalis, but is relatively minor after sterile PBS injection (Fig. 1B). Quantitation of CLIPA8-C band intensities revealed a 17-, 43-, 26-, 40-, and 5-fold increase in the abundance of CLIPA8-C in hemolymph in response to the injection of E. coli, E. cloacae, E. faecalis, S. aureus, or sterile PBS alone, respectively, as compared with control noninjected mosquitoes. Hence, CLIPA8 cleavage is induced much more effectively by infection rather than by injury per se.FIGURE 2Transcript levels of CLIPA8 in whole mosquitoes challenged with E. coli (gray), S. aureus (black), or PBS (white).

Immunoblotting of mosquito hemolymph, extracted under nonreducing conditions, revealed that both CLIPA8-C and CLIPA8-F migrated as a single band (Fig. 1B, lane 7), indeed indicating the presence of a disulfide bond that bridges both domains. CLIPA8 Is Essential for Melanization of Bacteria—The facts that CLIPA8 is essential for P. berghei ookinete melanization (7Volz J. Muller H.M. Zdanowicz A. Kafatos F.C. Osta M.A. Cell Microbiol. 2006; 8: 1392-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and is cleaved in the hemolymph following bacterial challenge prompted us to investigate the potential involvement of CLIPA8 in bacterial melanization. We injected E. coli or S. aureus in wild type, dslacZ, or dsCLIPA8-treated adult A. gam-biae and utilized light microscopy to score for the presence of melanized bacterial clumps in the mosquito abdomens, after dissection 3 days post-infection. Such clumps were detected in wild type mosquitoes injected with E. coli (Fig. 3B, arrows) or S. aureus (Fig. 3C, arrows) but not in noninjected (Fig. 3A) or PBS-injected mosquitoes (data not shown). These clumps appear as easily identifiable black bodies clustering mainly on both sides of the dorsal blood vessel. Studies in another mosquito species established that the large melanotic clumps appearing after bacterial infections are formed by aggregation of singly melanized bacteria in the hemocoel (11Hernandez-Martinez S. Lanz H. Rodriguez M.H. Gonzalez-Ceron L. Tsutsumi V. J. Med. Entomol. 2002; 39: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Interestingly, after challenge with E. coli or S. aureus, melanized clumps were present in dslacZ-treated controls (Table 1) but absent from dsCLIPA8-treated mosquitoes (Fig. 3, D and E, respectively). The same clear difference was observed (data not shown) with two additional bacteria, E. cloacae (Gram-negative) and E. faecalis (Gram-positive), indicating that CLIPA8 is indeed required for melanization of bacteria in A. gambiae. If so, silencing CLIPA8 should also abolish hemolymph PPO activation by bacteria. We measured PO enzymatic activity in the hemolymph of dsCLIPA8 and dslacZ mosquitoes 6 h after infection with a mixture of E. coli and S. aureus. The infected dslacZ controls exhibited strong induction of PO activity, whereas the infected dsCLIPA8 mosquitoes showed only basal levels, as did wild type noninjected (WT) or PBS-injected (WT/PBS) mosquitoes (Fig. 3J). The fact that sterile PBS injection did not activate PPO in the hemolymph indicates that any PPO activation induced by wounding is localized, in contrast to the systemic activation that occurs after bacterial challenge. Taken together our results establish that CLIPA8 is essential for bacterial melanization in A. gambiae. Interestingly, dsCLIPA8 mosquitoes melanized wound surfaces as efficiently as did dslacZ controls (Fig. 3, F and G), suggesting that CLIPA8 is not essential for that process. CLIPA8 is also not required for the formation of spontaneous, large melanotic pseudotumors (Fig. 3, H and I), which develop in the absence of injected bacteria in mosquitoes silenced for the major melanization inhibitor, SRPN2 (5Michel K. Budd A. Pinto S. Gibson T.J. Kafatos F.C. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 891-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Melanized bacterial clumps in wild-type and dsRNA-treated A. gambiae mosquitoes Mosquitoes were challenged with E. coli or S. aureus (each at A600 = 0.4).

To this aim, we compared the survival rates of dslacZ- and dsCLIPA8-treated mosquitoes over 7 days post-infection with E. coli or S. aureus. To ensure that CLIPA8 was efficiently silenced throughout this period, we performed immunoblot analysis on hemolymph extracted from mosquitoes at different time points after dsCLIPA8 injection. The results confirmed that CLIPA8 is absent from the hemolymph of dsCLIPA8 mosquitoes even at 15 days after dsRNA injection (Fig. 4A). Remarkably, dsCLIPA8 mosquitoes survived E. coli and S. aureus infections as efficiently as did dslacZ controls (Fig. 4B), and harbored similar numbers of bacteria as controls (Fig. 4C); these numbers were much lower than in dsRel2-RHD mosquitoes, which succumb to E. coli and S. aureus infections (14Meister S. Kanzok S.M. Zheng X.L. Luna C. Li T.R. Hoa N.T. Clayton J.R. White K.P. Kafatos F.C. Christophides G.K. Zheng L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 11420-11425Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). This comparison strongly suggests the existence of an effective antibacterial response, other than melanization, downstream of Rel2. The phenol oxidase cascade is an integral part of insect physical and innate immune defenses, including cuticle sclerotization and melanization of pathogens. Melanization requires the limited proteolysis of inactive PPO to PO by pro-phenoloxidase-activating enzymes and their associated cofactors, including the serine protease homologs. Microscopy studies in different mosquito species revealed that bacteria are efficiently melanized in the hemocoel (9Hillyer J.F. Schmidt S.L. Christensen B.M. J. Parasitol. 2003; 89: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 10Hillyer J.F. Schmidt S.L. Christensen B.M. Microbes Infect. 2004; 6: 448-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 11Hernandez-Martinez S. Lanz H. Rodriguez M.H. Gonzalez-Ceron L. Tsutsumi V. J. Med. Entomol. 2002; 39: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar); however, no genetic analysis has yet been conducted to assess the contribution of melanization to mosquito survival after bacterial infections. Here we have addressed this question using in vivo functional genetic analysis based on RNA interference. We show that CLIPA8, an SPH essential for the melanization of P. berghei ookinetes in the mosquito midgut, is required for PPO activation and the melanization of bacteria in the mosquito hemolymph. The fact that CLIPA8 is essential for the melanization of both Plasmodium and bacteria indicates the existence of at least a partial overlap in the genetic modules that regulate the melanization response of A. gambiae to both microorganisms. We also demonstrate by immunoblotting that CLIPA8 is cleaved following bacterial challenge; however, both the protease and clip domains remain tethered by a disulfide bond as has been shown for other insect SPHs (19Yu X.Q. Jiang H. Wang Y. Kanost M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 33: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 21Kwon T.H. Kim M.S. Choi H.W. Joo C.H. Cho M.Y. Lee B.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6188-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Cleaved CLIPA8 is most probably the functional form of the protein, and recent structural analysis of the H. diomphalia pro-phenoloxidase-activating factor (PPAF)-II, which belongs to the SPH family, revealed that uncleaved PPAF-II is a monomer, whereas cleaved PPAF-II is a large oligomer that binds tightly to PO (22Piao S. Song Y.L. Kim J.H. Park S.Y. Park J.W. Lee B.L. Oh B.H. Ha N.C. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4404-4414Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The CLIPA8-C band detected in immunoblots is often weak compared with CLIPA8-F, and a similar observation has been reported for M. sexta SPH1 and SPH2 (19Yu X.Q. Jiang H. Wang Y. Kanost M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 33: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). This imbalance could be due either to rapid clearance of the cleaved functional forms from the hemolymph to contain the melanization response or to their entrapment together with PO and possibly other proteins in the melanin capsule that forms around pathogens. Interestingly, even though CLIPA8 cleavage in the hemolymph was also detected after injection of sterile PBS and 3 days post-silencing of the major melanization inhibitor SRPN2 (data not shown), CLIPA8 was not required for melanization of wound surface nor for the formation of spontaneous melanotic pseudotumors in dsSRPN2 mosquitoes. These observations suggest the existence of distinct mechanisms for PPO activation during wound healing and melanotic pseudotumor formation. Genome sequence comparisons had shown that the PPO family encompasses many more genes in A. gambiae than in Drosophila (23Christophides G.K. Zdobnov E. Barillas-Mury C. Birney E. Blandin S. Blass C. Brey P.T. Collins F.H. Danielli A. Dimopoulos G. Hetru C. Hoa N.T. Hoffmann J.A. Kanzok S.M. Letunic I. Levashina E.A. Loukeris T.G. Lycett G. Meister S. Michel K. Moita L.F. Muller H.M.

Science. 2002; 298: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar); moreover, no orthologs of the essential CLIPA8 melanization factor have been identified in Drosophila or other insects to date (Ref. 23Christophides G.K. Zdobnov E. Barillas-Mury C. Birney E. Blandin S. Blass C. Brey P.T. Collins F.H. Danielli A. Dimopoulos G. Hetru C. Hoa N.T. Hoffmann J.A. Kanzok S.M. Letunic I. Levashina E.A. Loukeris T.G.

Science. 2002; 298: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar and data not shown). These observations suggested the possibility that hemolymph phenol oxidase activity may be essential for antibacterial defense in Anopheles, although it is dispensable in Drosophila (24Leclerc V.

Nevertheless, our data do not support this hypothesis; dsCLIPA8-treated mosquitoes were as resistant to bacterial infections as dslacZ controls, although they failed to activate hemolymph PPO. However, these results do not exclude a potential role for melanization in enhancing the effectiveness of different immune reactions as demonstrated recently in Drosophila (25Tang H. Kambris Z.

In each of these cases, GnT-V was overexpressed, and an altered cellular phenotype linked to tumor invasiveness was correlated with altered receptor glycosylation and function.

Wang Q.Y. Guo H.B. Shen Z.H. Chen H.L. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1795-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In PyMT-induced mouse mammary tumor cells in the GnT-V null background, EGFR was reported to show a higher level of co-localization with EEA-1, an early endosomal marker, suggesting that altered N-glycans on EGFR may affect nonligand induced receptor endocytosis (10Partridge E.A. Le Roy C. Di Guglielmo G.M. Pawling J. Cheung P. Granovsky M. Nabi I.R. Wrana J.L. Dennis J.W. Science. 2004; 306: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). The mechanism of how the downstream signaling of the EGFR in these cells with aberrant GnT-V activity is affected is not clear, however, nor whether these effects on signaling result in changes in the EGF-induced invasive phenotype of the tumor cells. To test directly if decreased levels of GnT-V-modified N-glycan expression affect EGF-mediated invasiveness, we chose a human breast carcinoma cell line, MDA-MB231, used by many investigators for invasiveness studies, to produce a population of cells whose GnT-V expression was attenuated by the expression of small interfering RNA (siRNA). EGF treatment of these cells results in a relatively rapid loss of strong adhesion to substrate and a stimulation of motility and invasiveness. We found that knockdown of GnT-V by siRNA expression caused reduced N-linked β(1,6)-branching on glycoproteins, including EGFR, which resulted in significant inhibition of EGF-stimulated cell detachment from matrix and actin arrangement. Moreover, knockdown of GnT-V also decreased EGF-mediated activation of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, which consequently inhibited the EGF-mediated dephosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), consistent with the attenuation of invasiveness-related phenotypes, including decreased actin rearrangement and cell motility. Our results demonstrate for the first time that regulation of the activity of a specific tyrosine phosphatase, SHP-2, and dephosphorylation of FAK result from inhibition of GnT-V expression and mediate subsequent reduced carcinoma invasiveness-related properties in vitro.

Cells and Cell Culture—Human breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB231 was from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). MDA-MB231 cells were cultured in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with high glucose (Hyclone) containing 10% FBS and 2 mml-glutamine. Small Interfering RNA—The human GnT-V (NM_002410)-specific oligonucleotides that contained a 19-nucleotide sequence corresponding to nucleotides 791-809 downstream of the transcription start site (GAGAAAGCGGAAGAAAGTC), which is separated by a 9-nucleotide noncomplementary spacer (TTCAAGAGA) from the reverse complement of the same 19-nucleotide sequence, were chosen for targeted suppression of GnT-V. The sequences of forward and reverse strands of oligonucleotides were 5′-GATCCCCGAGAAAGCGGAAGAAAGTCTTCAAGAGAGACTTTCCGCTTTCTCTTTTTA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTAAAAAGAGAAAGCGGAAAGTCTCTCTGAAGACTTTCTTCCGCTTTCTCGGG-3′, respectively. Control RNA strands were used as previously described (33Abbott K.L. Troupe K. Lee I. Pierce M. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 2837-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Forward and reverse oligonucleotides were annealed to form a duplex and inserted into the BglII/HindIII cleavage site of pSUPER retroviral vector (pSUPER.retro.neo/gfp). The recombinant plasmids containing either control RNAs or GnT-V siRNAs were transformed into competent Escherichia coli cells, selected, and amplified for later use. Transfection—Cell transfections were performed with Lipofectamine™ 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions using 5 μg of recombinant retroviral pSUPER/60-mm dish. 24 h after transfection, cells were selected for 3 weeks under G418 (800 μg/ml), and cells with the highest GFP expression were isolated using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Nonclonal populations of transfected cells were used for all experiments. The human pcDNA3/GnT-V plasmid (34Guo H.B. Liu F. Chen H.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) was used for transient expression of GnT-V. Cells were incubated for 48 h after transfection and used for the indicated experiments. Quantitative Real Time Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—The RNeasy kit (Qiagen) was used to isolate total RNA. Reverse transcription reactions were performed using Superscript III (Stratagene) and random primers. Primers used in the quantitative real time reverse transcription-PCR analysis were as follows: human GnT-V forward (5′-GAGCAGATCCTGGACCTCAG-3′) and reverse (5′-GCTGTCATGACTCCAGCGTA-3′); human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase forward (5′-CAGCCTCAAGATCATCAGCA-3′) and reverse (5′-GTCTTCTGGGTGGCAGTGAT-3′). Real time reactions were performed using the iQTMSYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) under the following conditions: 30 s at 95 °C for 1 cycle, 10 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 65 °C for 40 cycles, 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 80 cycles of 55 °C for 10 s for melting curve analysis. GnT-V Activity Assay—Cells were trypsinized, pelleted, and lysed with 50 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100. Insoluble debris was pelleted by microcentrifugation (10 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant was used for the GnT-V activity assay using UDP-[3H]GlcNAc as donor substrate and a synthetic trisaccharide acceptor (35Shoreibah M. Perng G.S. Adler B. Weinstein J. Basu R. Cupples R. Wen D. Browne J.K. Buckhaults P. Fregien N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15381-15385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sep-Pak columns (Waters) were used to separate the substrates and products. Assays were performed in duplicate, the data were averaged, and the results were expressed as specific activity (cpm/h/mg). Protein concentration in the cell lysates was determined using the BCA assay (Pierce). Flow Cytometry Analysis—Cells were grown to subconfluence and detached with 2 mm EDTA in PBS. Cells (106) were washed, resuspended in 100 μl of FCM buffer (PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.01% sodium azide), and then incubated with phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-EGFR or biotinylated L-PHA, concanavalin A, and Datura stramonium agglutinin at 4 °C for 30 min, followed by incubation with PE-conjugated streptavidin (10 μl) at 4 °C for 30 min. After a wash with ice-cold FCM buffer, analysis was performed using the FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) instrument. Cell Spreading Assay—Subconfluent cells were detached and resuspended in DMEM culture medium containing 2% FBS. After incubation for 15 min at 37 °C, cells were transferred to 6-well plates and grown in DMEM containing 2% FBS with or without EGF (50 ng/ml) for 60 min. In some experiments, cells were pretreated with swainsonine for 24 h before being used for the spreading assay. The percentage of spread cells was calculated by the ratio of the number of spread cells versus the total number of cells. Cells were considered as spread if they became flattened and lost nuclear refractivity. Wound Healing Assay—Cells (4 × 105) were seeded on 6-well plates and grown to confluence. A clear area was then scraped in the monolayer with a 200-μl yellow plastic tip. After being washed with serum-free DMEM, the plate was incubated at 37 °C in low serum (2%) DMEM containing EGF (100 ng/ml) for the indicated times. Migration of cells into wounded areas was evaluated with an inverted microscope and photographed. In Vitro Cell Motility Assay—Motility assays were performed using 24-well Transwell units with 8-μm pore size polycarbonate inserts (6Guo H.B. Lee I. Kamar M. Akiyama S.K. Pierce M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6837-6845PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, cells (5 × 104), suspended in 500 μl of DMEM containing 2% FBS and 100 ng/ml EGF, were added into the upper compartment of the Transwell unit, and 700 μl of DMEM containing 2% FBS was added into the lower compartment. Cells were allowed to migrate for 12 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells on the upper side of the membrane were then removed, whereas the cells that migrated through the membrane to the underside were fixed and stained with crystal violet. Cell numbers were then counted in five separate fields using light microscopy at ×100 magnification. The data were expressed as the mean value of cells in five fields based on two independent experiments. Fluorescent Staining—Cells were cultured on chamber slides, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, and permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100. For actin and vinculin double staining, cells were starved overnight, treated with EGF (100 ng/ml) for the indicated times, and fixed in HistoChoice for 15 min at room temperature, followed by permeabilization with cold methanol at -20 °C for 3 min (36Jaggi M. Rao P.S. Smith D.J. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Hemstreet G.P. Balaji K.C. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 483-492PubMed Google Scholar). After blocking with 10% goat serum, cells were stained with biotinylated L-PHA, rhodamine-phalloidin, and vinculin, respectively, followed by incubation with rhodamine-conjugated streptavidin or fluorescence-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:250). After washing with PBS, the chamber slides were mounted, and the cells were subjected to deconvolution fluorescence microscopy. Immunoblotting—Cells were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin). Twenty μg of total cell lysate protein, determined using the BCA protein assay procedure (Pierce), were boiled in 2× SDS sample buffer for 5 min, electrophoresed on a 7% polyacrylamide minigel, and then transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After blocking with 3% BSA in PBS, the membrane was incubated for 2 h at room temperature with primary antibodies (1:1000) in TBS buffer containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST). The membrane was then washed with TBS and probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (1:3000) for 1 h at room temperature. After the membrane was washed with TBS, protein bands were developed with ECL reagents and exposed on x-ray film. Images of immunoblots and lectin blots were quantified using a Fluor-S imager (Bio-Rad). Cell Surface Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Subconfluent cells were washed and detached using 2 mm EDTA. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS and incubated with 1 mg/ml NHS-LC-biotin in PBS for 20 min at 4 °C on a rocking platform. After washing with PBS, cells were lysed by incubation with lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin) for 30 min at 4 °C. For the detection of surface EGFR levels, cell lysates (400 μg of protein) were incubated with 50 μl of streptavidin-agarose at 4 °C overnight. The pellets were washed twice in lysis buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gels were then transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed with antibody against EGFR. For lectin precipitation of EGFR (37Salicioni A.M. Gaultier A. Brownlee C. Cheezum M.K. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10005-10012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), cell extracts were treated by boiling in 100 μl of denaturation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, and 5 mm EDTA) for 5-10 min, followed by the addition of 900 μl of lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors as mentioned above. Lysates were then incubated with biotinylated L-PHA (5 μg) overnight at 4 °C under agitation, followed by incubation with streptavidin-agarose at 4 °C for 2 h under agitation. N-Linked β(1,6)-branching on EGFR was then detected by using antibody against EGFR after SDS-PAGE and membrane transfer, as described above. For immunoprecipitation of FAK and proteins containing phosphotyrosine, serum-starved cells were treated with EGF (100 ng/ml) for the indicated times. After washing with PBS, cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 20 mm pyrophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 0.2 mm ammonium molybdate, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin) for 30 min and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatants (450 μg of protein) were used for immunoprecipitation of FAK or Tyr(P) as described above. Immunocomplexes were then separated by reducing SDS-PAGE (7.5%), transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with mouse anti-PY20 and antibody against FAK and SHP-2 for FAK immunoprecipitation or probed with FAK and paxillin antibodies for Tyr(P) precipitation. Tyrosine Phosphatase Activity Assay—Subconfluent cells were starved in serum-free medium overnight and then stimulated with EGF (100 ng/ml) for the indicated times. Cells were lysed in ice-cold buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin) for 30 min at 4 °C. Endogenous phosphate was removed from cell lysates using spin columns of Sephadex G-25 resin (Amersham Biosciences). Phosphatase SHP-2 was immunoprecipitated using antibody against SHP-2, and precipitated proteins were then subjected to an in vitro activity assay performed with the tyrosine phosphatase assay kit using Tyr phosphopeptide (DADEpYLIPQQG, where pY represents phosphotyrosine) as substrate. A serially diluted standard of 1 mm KH2PO4 was used to generate a standard curve. The levels of precipitated SHP-2 were detected by Western blotting and used for the normalization of phosphatase activity of SHP-2. The results were expressed as relative activity of phosphatase (pmol/min/μl). EGF Binding Assays—Competitive EGF binding assays were performed as previously described by Sato et al. (38Sato Y. Takahashi M. Shibukawa Y. Jain S.K. Hamaoka R. Miyagawa J. Yaginuma Y. Honke K. Ishikawa M. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11956-11962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In brief, 8 × 104 cells were seeded into 24-well plates and grown over-night. Cells were then incubated in serum-free DMEM containing 0.1% BSA at 37 °C for 1 h. The medium was then replaced with ice-cold DMEM containing 0.1% BSA and 125I-EGF (5 × 104 cpm) in the presence of cold EGF with a concentration range of 0-2.0 ng/ml. Nonspecific binding was measured by the prior addition of 1 μm cold EGF. After incubation at 4 °C for 2 h, the cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and then hydrolyzed by adding 0.5 ml of 1 m NaOH. Cell lysates were transferred into glass tubes, and the cell-bound radioactivity was counted with a γ-counter and expressed as mean value of cpm/well ± S.D.

https://openalex.org/W2033457416,"Chromosome segregation in mitosis is orchestrated by dynamic interaction between spindle microtubules and the kinetochore, a multiprotein complex assembled onto centromeric DNA of the chromosome. Here, we show that Homo sapiens (Hs) NUF2 is required for stable kinetochore localization of centromere-associated protein E (CENP-E) in HeLa cells. HsNUF2 specifies the kinetochore association of CENP-E by interacting with its C-terminal domain. The region of HsNUF2 binding to CENP-E was mapped to its C-terminal domain by glutathione S-transferase pulldown and yeast two-hybrid assays. Suppression of synthesis of HsNUF2 by small interfering RNA abrogated the localization of CENP-E to the kinetochore, demonstrating the requirement of HsNUF2 for CENP-E kinetochore localization. In addition, depletion of HsNUF2 caused aberrant chromosome segregation. These HsNUF2-suppressed cells displayed reduced tension at kinetochores of bi-orientated chromosomes. Double knockdown of CENP-E and HsNUF2 further abolished the tension at the kinetochores. Our results indicate that HsNUF2 and CENP-E are required for organization of stable microtubule-kinetochore attachment that is essential for faithful chromosome segregation in mitosis.

The kinetochore is a supramolecular complex assembled at each centromere in eukaryotes. It provides a chromosomal attachment point for the mitotic spindle, linking the chromosome to the microtubule, and functions in initiating, controlling, and monitoring the movements of chromosomes during mitosis. The kinetochore of animal cells contains two regions: the inner kinetochore, which is tightly and persistently associated with centromeric DNA sequences throughout the cell cycle, and the outer kinetochore, which contains many dynamic protein components that interact with microtubules only during mitosis. The stable propagation of eukaryotic cells requires that each chromosome is accurately duplicated and faithfully segregated. During mitosis, attaching, positioning, and bi-orientating kinetochores with the spindle microtubules play essential roles in chromosome segregation and genomic stability (see Refs. 1Fukagawa T. Exp.

Abrieu A. Zheng Y. Sullivan K.F. Cleveland D.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). CENP-E participates in the chromosome movements from prometaphase to anaphase (6Yen T.J. Compton D.A. Wise D. Zinkowski R.P. Brinkley B.R. Earnshaw W.C. Cleveland D.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1245-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). It moves toward and tethers kinetochores to microtubule “plus” ends (7Wood K.W. Sakowicz R. Goldstein L.S.B. Cleveland D.W. Cell. 1997; 91: 357-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), helping mono-oriented chromosomes align at the metaphase plate before bi-orientation (5Yao X. Abrieu A.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). During this process, its location on the kinetochore depends on BUBR1 and CENP-F (9Chan G.K. Schaar B.T. Yen T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Unattached kinetochores are also the sensing apparatus for the mitotic checkpoint, which delays anaphase onset until all kinetochores have properly attached to spindle microtubules (10Rieder C.L. Schultz A. Cole R. Sluder G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1301-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 11Li X. Nicklas R.B. Nature. 1995; 373: 630-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). In this context, CENP-E as a kinetochore attachment sensor is also involved in a spindle checkpoint signaling pathway. It activates BUBR1-related checkpoint signaling in a microtubule-dependent manner (12Mao Y. Abrieu A. Cleveland D.W. Cell. 2003; 114: 87-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 13Mao Y. Desai A. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and CENP-E/BUBR1 interaction is quite important in controlling this spindle checkpoint (5Yao X. Abrieu A. Zheng Y. Sullivan K.F. Cleveland D.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 12Mao Y. Abrieu A. Cleveland D.W.

Thus, CENP-E is necessary for microtubule-kinetochore conjugation, chromosome congression, and spindle checkpoint activation.Homo sapiens (Hs) NUF2 is a kinetochore protein that forms a stable complex with HEC1, HsSPC24, and HsSPC25 (named the HsNDC80 complex). Depletion of HsNUF2 by RNA interference results in a strong prometaphase block with an active spindle checkpoint, which is correlated with low but detectable MAD2 at kinetochores that have no or few stable kinetochore microtubules (14DeLuca J.G. Moree B. Hickey J.M. Kilmartin J.V. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). HEC1 was originally identified as a retino-blastoma protein-associated protein. Microinjection of anti-HEC1 antibodies into cultured cells disrupts mitotic progression (15Chen Y. Riley D.J. Chen P.L. Lee W.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6049-6056Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Both the Nuf2-Ndc80 complex and its human homolog, NUF2-HEC1, have been shown to be important for stable microtubule-kinetochore attachment, chromosome alignment, and also spindle checkpoint activation in mitosis (14DeLuca J.G.

Given our recent success in obtaining the full-length CENP-E cDNA clone and the finding that the original CENP-E clone missed 38 amino acids (e.g. Ref. 20Xue Y. Liu D. Fu C. Dou Z. Zhou Q. Yao X. Chin. Sci. Bull. 2006; 51: 1836-1847Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar), we conducted a new search for kinetochore proteins that specify the kinetochore localization of CENP-E using the new cDNA clone. We chose its C terminus as bait and conducted a yeast two-hybrid assay in which the kinetochore protein HsNUF2 was identified as one of several dozen positive clones. Our biochemical characterization validated the interaction between HsNUF2 and CENP-E. In addition, our study shows that HsNUF2 specifies the kinetochore localization of CENP-E and is essential for a stable microtubule-kinetochore attachment.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and Synchronization—HeLa and 293T cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained as subconfluent monolayers in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) and 100 units/ml penicillin plus 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 10% CO2. Cells were synchronized at G1/S with 5 mm thymidine for 16 h, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and cultured in thymidine-free medium for 12 h for release. After another round of thymidine treatment for 12 h, cells were released for 9-10 h to initiate prometaphase. In some cases, 100 nm nocodazole was added to the cell culture to synchronize cells in prometaphase.Antibodies—Affinity purification of rabbit anti-CENP-E antibody was as described previously (22Yao X. Anderson K.L. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal antibody to HsNUF2 was purchased from Abcam and used at a 1:1000 dilution for Western blotting and at a 1:300 dilution for immunofluorescence. Mouse monoclonal antibody to HEC1 was purchased from Abcam and used at a 1:1000 dilution for Western blotting and at a 1:500 dilution for immunofluorescence. Mouse monoclonal antibodies to glutathione S-transferase (GST) and maltose-binding protein (MBP) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA) and used at a 1:1000 dilution for Western blotting. Mouse monoclonal antibody to green fluorescent protein (GFP) was obtained from BD Biosciences. Rabbit antibody against the C-terminal tail of human CENP-E was generated as described previously (20Xue Y. Liu D. Fu C. Dou Z. Zhou Q. Yao X. Chin. Sci. Bull. 2006; 51: 1836-1847Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar).Plasmids—Full-length human CENP-E and HsNUF2 cDNAs or fragments were subcloned into pGBKT7 (Clontech), pGADT7 (Clontech), pGEX4T3 (GE Healthcare), pMAL-C2 (New England Biolabs), and pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) vectors. The following plasmids were used for in vitro and in vivo studies: BD-CENP-E-(2167-2701) (where BD represents the Gal4 DNA-binding domain) and BD-CENP-E-(2131-2701) in pGBKT7; AD-HsNUF2-(1-464) (where AD represents the Gal4 DNA activation domain), AD-D1 (aa 1-341), AD-D2 (aa 424-464), AD-D3 (aa 341- 424), and AD-D4 (aa 212-424) in pGADT7; GST-CENP-E-(2167-2701) and GST-HsNUF2 in pGEX4T3; MBP-CENP-E-(2167-2701) in pMAL-C2; and GFP-HsNUF2, GFP-D1 (HsNUF2-(281-341)), GFP-D2 (HsNUF2-(126-281)), GFP-D3 (HsNUF2-(246-341)), GFP-D4 (HsNUF2 lacking aa 341-424), and GFP-D5 (HsNUF2-(281-464)) in pEGFP-C1. All constructs were sequenced in full.Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—Yeast two-hybrid assays were performed as described (21Lou Y. Yao J. Zereshki A. Dou Z. Ahmed K. Wang H. Hu J. Wang Y. Yao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20049-20057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Briefly, two CENP-E baits containing aa 2167-2701 and 2131-2701 were inserted into the BamHI-EcoRI sites of pGBKT7 individually to create a fusion with aa 1-147 of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain. The resultant pGBKT7/CENP-E C termini were transformed into strain AH109 along with the GAL4 reporter plasmid pCL and the negative control plasmid pGBKT7-Lam. Protein expression was validated by Western blotting using Gal4 and an anti-CENP-E antibody that reacts with the C-terminal tail. Transformants did not activate the HIS3 reporter gene and were transformed with the HeLa cDNA library. Transformants were selected on Leu-/Trp-/His- synthetic dropout plates, and positive clones were streaked onto Leu-/Trp-/His-/Ade- 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-α-d-galactopyranoside (X-α-gal)-positive synthetic dropout plates. Almost 400 colonies were picked out on Leu-/Trp-/His-/Ade- X-α-gal-positive synthetic dropout plates. Minipreparation plasmids were isolated from Escherichia coli DH5α, and PCR products were digested with several restriction enzymes and grouped according to their digestion patterns. Specificity of the interaction was independently verified by re-transforming the candidate cDNAs back into strain AH109 along with pGBKT7/CENP-E C termini. Those cDNAs that could form colonies on Leu-/Trp-/His-/Ade- synthetic dropout plates were sent for sequencing.Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—GST-CENP-E-(2167-2701), GST-HsNUF2, and MBP-CENP-E-(2167-2701) were expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3)pLysS and purified using glutathione (GST-CENP-E-(2167-2701) and GST-HsNUF2) and amylase (MBP-CENP-E-(2167-2701)) beads as described previously (23Cao X. Ding X. Guo X. Zhou R. Forte J.G. Teng M. Yao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13584-13592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Pulldown Assays—In vitro pulldown assays were performed with bacterially expressed and purified GST-CENP-E-(2167-2701). GST-CENP-E-(2167-2701) with beads was combined with cell lysates of 293T cells transfected individually with a GFP-HsNUF2 series for 24 h 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, and 2 mm KH2PO4, 0.20% Tween 20 (TPBS) for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with ice-cold TPBS and then boiled for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE for Coomassie Blue staining or transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane for Western blotting.To demonstrate a physical interaction between recombinant HsNUF2 and CENP-E, GST-tagged HsNUF2 immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) was used as an affinity matrix for incubation with purified MBP-CENP-E-(2167-2701). The agarose beads were washed five times with PBS before being boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The proteins were then fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.Interaction Domain Mapping by Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—A series of AD-HsNUF2 deletion plasmids were cotransformed with BD-CENP-E-(2167-2701) into yeast strains. After 3 days of incubation, those colonies that grew on Leu-/Trp-/His- synthetic dropout plates were inoculated onto Leu-/Trp-/His-/Ade- X-α-gal-positive synthetic dropout plates to map the domain of HsNUF2 interaction with CENP-E. Only those strains transformed with AD-D3 (aa 341-424) and AD-D4 (aa 212-424) grew on Leu-/Trp-/His-/Ade- X-α-gal-positive synthetic dropout plates and turned blue. Strains transformed with AD-D1 (aa 1-341) and AD-D2 (aa 424-464) did not grow, indicating that these two fragments cannot bind to the CENP-E C terminus.Co-immunoprecipitation—HeLa cells were synchronized at prometaphase as described above. The cells were then lysed with 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.02% sodium azide, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (which was added prior to use). Anti-CENP-E polyclonal antibody HpX and anti-HsNUF2 monoclonal antibody were incubated for 2 h with protein A/G beads and washed three times with wash buffer (0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.02% sodium azide, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (added just before use)) to prepare for the co-immunoprecipitation experiment. These antibody-bound protein A/G beads were added to the cell lysate and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C. After incubation, the beads were washed four times with wash buffer and once with PBS. Samples were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane to perform Western blotting.Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—For the siRNA studies, the 21-mers of the siRNA duplexes against HsNUF2 (target sequence, 5′-AAGCATGCCGTGAAACGTATA-3′) (14DeLuca J.G. Moree B. Hickey J.M. Kilmartin J.V. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), HEC1 (target sequence, 5′-AAGTTCAAAAGCTGGATGATCTT-3′) (18Martin-Lluesma S. Stucke V.M. Nigg E.A. Science. 2002; 297: 2267-2270Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), and CENP-E (target sequence, 5′-AAACACTTACTGCTCTCCAGTTT-3′) (18Martin-Lluesma S. Stucke V.M. Nigg E.A. Science. 2002; 297: 2267-2270Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) were synthesized by Dharmacon Research Inc. (Lafayette, CO). After trial experiments using a series of concentrations and time course assays, treatment at 100 nm for 48 h was finally selected as the most efficient conditions for repressing target proteins.Transfection and Immunofluorescence—Cells were transfected with siRNA and GFP-tagged plasmids in a 24-well plate using Oligofectamine reagent and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), respectively, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. For immunofluorescence, HeLa cells were seeded onto sterile acid-treated 12-mm coverslips in 24-well plates (Corning Corp., Corning, NY). Single thymidine-blocked and thymidine-released cells were transfected with HsNUF2, HEC1, or CENP-E siRNA and GFP fusion plasmids as described above. Fixation and staining were done as described previously (8Schaar B.T. Chan G.K. Maddox P. Salmon E.D. Yen T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Antibody HpX and antibodies against GFP, HsNUF2, HEC1, and ACA were used at dilutions of 1:500, 1:300, 1:300, 1:500, and 1:1000, respectively. Images were acquired using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope with AxioVision Version 3.0 software.Fluorescence Intensity Quantification and Kinetochore Distance Measurement—The fluorescence intensity of kinetochore protein labeling was measured using a Zeiss LSM 510 NLO confocal microscope scan head mounted transversely on an Axiovert 200 inverted microscope with a 100 × 1.3 numerical aperture PlanApo objective. The images from double labeling were collected using a dichroic filter set with Zeiss LSM 5 image processing software. The distance between sister kinetochores marked with ACA was measured as the distance between the peak fluorescence as described previously (5Yao X. Abrieu A. Zheng Y. Sullivan K.F. Cleveland D.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). To test whether double repression of HsNUF2 and CENP-E eliminates the tension across the sister kinetochore, we added 100 nm nocodazole to the aliquots of siRNA-treated cells 30 h after the transfection for additional 18 h (5Yao X. Abrieu A. Zheng Y. Sullivan K.F. Cleveland D.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The distance between sister kinetochores marked with ACA was measured as described above.Quantification of the level of kinetochore-associated protein was conducted as described by Johnson et al. (25Johnson V.L. Scott M.I.F. Holt S.V. Hussein D. Taylor S.S. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1577-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In brief, the average pixel intensities from at least 50 kinetochore pairs from five cells were measured, and background pixel intensities were subtracted. The pixel intensities at each kinetochore pair were then normalized against ACA pixel values to account for any variations in staining or image acquisition. The values of specific siRNA-treated cells were then plotted as a percentage of the values obtained from cells transfected with a control siRNA duplex.RESULTSHsNUF2 Is a Novel CENP-E-binding Partner—CENP-E contains an N-terminal microtubule-based motor domain, a central coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal kinetochore-targeting domain. It has been reported the C terminus of CENP-E interacts with known kinetochore proteins BUBR1 and CENP-F, both of which are believed to be involved in anchoring CENP-E on kinetochores (9Chan G.K. Schaar B.T. Yen T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Further research indicated that the interaction between CENP-E and BUBR1 is very important in spindle checkpoint activation (5Yao X. Abrieu A. Zheng Y. Sullivan K.F. Cleveland D.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that CENP-E binds BUBR1 and activates its kinase activity and that the spindle checkpoint signal is silenced as CENP-E captures a microtubule (12Mao Y. Abrieu A. Cleveland D.W. Cell. 2003; 114: 87-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 13Mao Y. Desai A. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that CENP-E is a key kinetochore protein in the spindle checkpoint signaling pathway and possibly links tension production to spindle checkpoint signal activation.We recently succeeded in generating a full-length human cDNA clone of CENP-E, and we discovered a deletion of 38 amino acids in the original clone (20Xue Y. Liu D. Fu C. Dou Z. Zhou Q. Yao X. Chin. Sci. Bull. 2006; 51: 1836-1847Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and corrected this deletion. To identify proteins that associate with the CENP-E C-terminal tail, aa 2167-2701 of CENP-E cDNA were used as bait to screen a HeLa cDNA library using the Gal4 yeast two-hybrid system as described previously (21Lou Y. Yao J. Zereshki A. Dou Z. Ahmed K. Wang H. Hu J. Wang Y. Yao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20049-20057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Screening was performed on a total 1 × 105 clones, and we identified 43 positive clones. Following analysis by HaeIII and AluI restriction digests, we identified several novel interacting partners of CENP-E. Nucleotide sequencing revealed that one of these interactors encodes the C terminus of HsNUF2 (aa 212-424). Its sequence matches that of HsNUF2 (GenBank™ accession number NP_663735).To verify the specificity of interaction between HsNUF2 and CENP-E and to define further the domain(s) that mediates the interaction between them, we took advantage of yeast genetics and sought to perform additional yeast two-hybrid screens to map the binding interface(s). To this end, we used reverse transcription-PCR to obtain the full-length cDNA of HsNUF2 from a HeLa cell library, and we cloned it into the pGADT7 vector.To better define the domain responsible for the specific interaction between HsNUF2 and CENP-E, we performed a computational structure prediction analysis of HsNUF2 to search for protein/protein interaction modules (supplemental Fig. 1). Among various binding modules searched, we found that both proteins contain coiled-coil domains. The coiled coil of HsNUF2 is located between aa 245 and 340, whereas the extended coiled coil of CENP-E is located between aa 581 and 2415. Because coiled coils mediates protein/protein interactions, we sought to test whether coiled coils mediate the association between CENP-E and HsNUF2-(1-341) (D1). To this end, a series of deletion mutants were generated as illustrated in Fig. 1A. The HsNUF2 deletion mutant plasmids were each cotransformed with the cDNA of the CENP-E C terminus into yeast cells. We used β-galactosidase activity (lacZ reporter) as a measure for protein/protein interaction. As shown in Fig. 1B, yeast genetic assay indicated that a region adjacent to the coiled coils of HsNUF2 bound to the CENP-E C-terminal tail. Thus, our yeast two-hybrid assay clearly demonstrated that the C terminus of CENP-E (aa 2167-2701) interacts directly with HsNUF2.Mapping the CENP-E-binding Interface in HsNUF2—To define the precise binding region of HsNUF2, we generated additional deletion constructs of HsNUF2 based on the bioinformatics analysis. Deletion mutant cDNAs of HsNUF2 were cotransformed with CENP-E C-terminal tail cDNA into yeast cells. As expected, the region containing aa 341-424 of HsNUF2 bound to the CENP-E C-terminal tail (AD-D3) (Fig. 1, A and B), but its interaction efficiency seemed to be equal to that of aa 212-424 (AD-D4) (Fig. 1, A and B), which suggests that the coiled coil of HsNUF2 (aa 246-340) is not required for CENP-E binding (Fig. 1B).To validate the interaction between CENP-E and HsNUF2 observed in our yeast two-hybrid assay, we carried out a pulldown assay using bacterial recombinant GST-CENP-E protein as an affinity matrix to score the biochemical binding activity of the HsNUF2 protein and its deletion mutants. To this end, GFP-tagged HsNUF2 and its deletion mutant proteins were expressed in 293T cells to obtain soluble HsNUF2 proteins as illustrated in Fig. 1C. Aliquots of mitotic 293T cell lysates containing GFP-HsNUF2 and its deletion mutants were incubated with GST-CENP-E-(2167-2701). As shown Fig. 1D, only full-length HsNUF2 and D5 (aa 281-464) could bind to CENP-E based on their retention on the GST-CENP-E affinity matrix as judged by Western blot analysis of the GFP tag. Deletion of the region containing aa 341-424 (D4) (Fig. 1, C and D) abolished the binding of HsNUF2 to GST-CENP-E. Thus, our biochemical study confirmed that the HsNUF2 C terminus (aa 281-464) binds to CENP-E and that aa 341-424 of HsNUF2 are essential for such binding activity.To examine whether the recombinant HsNUF2 protein binds to the CENP-E protein directly, we carried out a pulldown assay in which GST-tagged recombinant HsNUF2 was purified on glutathione-agarose beads and used as an affinity matrix to absorb purified MBP-CENP-E1 in test tubes. As shown in Fig. 1E (lanes 2 and 4), GST-tagged HsNUF2 and D5 pulled down MBP-CENP-E, indicating a physical interaction between CENP-E and HsNUF2 in vitro. MBP-CENP-E was never pulled down by GST-glutathione beads (Fig. 1E, lane 6), indicating a specific physical interaction between HsNUF2 and CENP-E. Thus, we conclude that HsNUF2 directly interacts with CENP-E via its C-terminal tail.HsNUF2 Forms a Cognate Complex with the Mitotic Kinesin CENP-E—To confirm the interaction between CENP-E and HsNUF2 observed in our pulldown assay and test whether CENP-E forms a complex with HsNUF2, we used anti-CENP-E antibody to immunoprecipitate soluble CENP-E and potential partner proteins from lysates of mitotically arrested HeLa cells. Immunoblotting with anti-CENP-E antibody confirmed a successful precipitation of CENP-E, and immunoblotting against HsNUF2 demonstrated that HsNUF2 was coprecipitated (Fig. 2A, lane 8). Immunoprecipitation of HsNUF2 using a mouse antibody confirmed the presence of a complex of HsNUF2 and CENP-E, although the proportion of HsNUF2 relative to CENP-E in the precipitate (Fig. 2A, lane 4) was 2-3-fold that seen with anti-CENP-E antibody (lane 8), suggesting a greater accumulation of HsNUF2. Neither CENP-E nor HsNUF2 was precipitated with control IgG (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 7), and no tubulin was detected in any of the immunoprecipitates. Thus, we conclude that HsNUF2 and CENP-E can form a complex in vivo.FIGURE 2CENP-E forms a complex with HsNUF2 in vivo. A, co-immunoprecipitation of CENP-E and HsNUF2 from mitotic HeLa cells. Extracts from nocodazole-synchronized mitotic HeLa cells were incubated with antibodies against HsNUF2 (lanes 1 and 4) and CENP-E (lanes 5 and 8), and immunoprecipitates (IP) were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Lanes 3 and 7, immunoprecipitation with nonspecific IgG antibody from the same mitotic extracts. Western blotting verified co-immunoprecipitation of HsNUF2 (middle panel) and CENP-E (upper panel). No tubulin was detected in either HsNUF2 or CENP-E immunoprecipitates (lower panel). Lanes 2 and 6 are non-binding materials.

https://openalex.org/W2091370988,"Planetary systems are formed within the disks of dust and gas around young stars that are the left-overs from the star formation process. The terrestrial planet forming regions of these disks subtend tiny angles, way beyond the angular resolution of even the largest ground- and space-based telescopes. Now using a new instrument at the Keck Interferometer, gases including water vapour and atomic hydrogen have been observed within one astronomical unit (one Sun–Earth distance) of the young star MWC 480. The water vapour was probably produced by the sublimation of migrating icy bodies, and it could provide a reservoir of water for the production of terrestrial planets. This paper reports spectrally dispersed near-infrared interferometric observations that probe the gas (which dominates the mass and dynamics of the inner disk) and dust within one astronomical unit (Sun–Earth distance) of the young star MWC 480. Water vapour and atomic hydrogen exist interior to the edge of the dust disk. The water vapor is likely produced by the sublimation of migrating icy bodies. Planetary systems (ours included) formed in disks of dust and gas around young stars. Disks are an integral part of the star and planet formation process1,2, and knowledge of the distribution and temperature of inner-disk material is crucial for understanding terrestrial planet formation3, giant planet migration4, and accretion onto the central star5. Although the inner regions of protoplanetary disks in nearby star-forming regions subtend only a few nano-radians, near-infrared interferometry has recently enabled the spatial resolution of these terrestrial zones. Most observations have probed only dust6, which typically dominates the near-infrared emission. Here I report spectrally dispersed near-infrared interferometric observations that probe the gas (which dominates the mass and dynamics of the inner disk), in addition to the dust, within one astronomical unit (1 au, the Sun–Earth distance) of the young star MWC 480. I resolve gas, including water vapour and atomic hydrogen, interior to the edge of the dust disk; this contrasts with results of previous spectrally dispersed interferometry observations7,8. Interactions of this accreting gas with migrating planets may lead to short-period exoplanets like those detected around main-sequence stars4. The observed water vapour is probably produced by the sublimation of migrating icy bodies9, and provides a potential reservoir of water for terrestrial planets10."
https://openalex.org/W2034563844,"Cathepsin C is a cysteine protease required for the activation of several pro-inflammatory serine proteases and, as such, is of interest as a therapeutic target. In cathepsin C-deficient mice and humans, the N-terminal processing and activation of neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G, and proteinase-3 is abolished and is accompanied by a reduction of protein levels. Pharmacologically, the consequence of cathepsin C inhibition on the activation of these serine proteases has not been described, due to the lack of stable and non-toxic inhibitors and the absence of appropriate experimental cell systems. Using novel reversible peptide nitrile inhibitors of cathepsin C, and cell-based assays with U937 and EcoM-G cells, we determined the effects of pharmacological inhibition of cathepsin C on serine protease activity. We show that indirect and complete inhibition of neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G, and proteinase-3 is achievable in intact cells with selective and non-cytotoxic cathepsin C inhibitors, at concentrations ∼10-fold higher than those required to inhibit purified cathepsin C. The concentration of inhibitor needed to block processing of these three serine proteases was similar, regardless of the cell system used. Importantly, cathepsin C inhibition must be sustained to maintain serine protease inhibition, because removal of the reversible inhibitors resulted in the activation of pro-enzymes in intact cells. These findings demonstrate that near complete inhibition of multiple serine proteases can be achieved with cathepsin C inhibitors and that cathepsin C inhibition represents a viable but challenging approach for the treatment of neutrophil-based inflammatory diseases.

In a murine model of collagen-antibody induced arthritis, the clinical score of arthritis was lower in NE–/–/CG–/– double mutant mice compared with single deletions of either NE or CG. Deletion of cathepsin C provided equivalent protection as NE/CG double mutants in this model (14Adkison A.M. Raptis S.Z. Kelley D.G. Pham C.T.N. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) and significant protection in the collagen-induced arthritis model (37Hu Y. Pham C.T.N. Arthritis Rheum. 2005; 52: 2553-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Based on this genetic data, cathepsin C inhibition should result in a reduction in activity of several clinically important serine protease targets and could potentially be of superior efficacy to blocking individual serine proteases, especially in complex inflammatory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Several potent and selective cathepsin C inhibitors have been described, but most suffer from poor metabolic stability and cytotoxicity (38Korver G.E. Kam C-M. Powers J.C Hudig D. Int.

Partial inhibition of serine proteases by a cathepsin C inhibitor has been shown with Gly-Phe-DMK, a metabolically unstable and cytotoxic compound (12McGuire M.J. Lipsky P.E. Thiele D.L. J. Biol.

We used two neutrophil-like cell lines to demonstrate for the first time that near complete inhibition of NE, CG, and Pr-3 is achievable with selective cathepsin C inhibitors but not by inhibitors of other cysteine cathepsins. Inhibition of CG and NE was maintained for several days, but removal of the reversible inhibitor resulted in a gradual recovery of serine protease activities. These data validate the development of small molecule inhibitors of cathepsin C as a strategy to block the processing and activity of multiple proinflammatory proteases but also highlight a potential difficulty, in that a high and sustained level of cathepsin C inhibition may be required for efficacy.

Recombinant human cathepsins C and L were purchased from R&D Systems, recombinant human cathepsin S from Calbiochem, human liver cathepsin H from Biomol, and human liver cathepsin B from Sigma-Aldrich. Methionine and glutamine-free RPMI 1640 and mouse recombinant granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor were obtained from BIOSOURCE Int. RPMI 1640, sodium pyruvate, penicillin-streptomycin, PBS solutions were from Mediatech, Inc. Fetal bovine serum was purchased from HyClone. [35S]Methionine (1000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Cell-based Assays—U937 cells (ATCC 1593.2) were propagated in U937 culture media (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm Hepes, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin). EcoM-G cells (clone EPSΔ1 ER 3.3 (45Sykes D.B. Kamps M.P. Blood. 2001; 98: 2308-2318Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) from Dr. Mark Kamps, University of California-San Diego) were grown in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin, 10 ng/ml recombinant murine granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, and 1 μm β-estradiol. The U937 cathepsin G aprotinin-agarose assay is described in greater details below. The U937 NE 7-day incubation assay is described in the legend of Fig. 3. All experiments using EcoM-G cells were performed with cultures <3 months of age. Exponentially growing EcoM-G cells were washed once with PBS and seeded in 96-well plates at 0.5 × 106 cells/ml in EcoM-G culture media without β-estradiol. The cells were incubated for 24 h, at which time compound diluted in Me2SO (final Me2SO, 0.5%) was added. EcoM-G cells were differentiated for another 24 h, harvested by centrifugation at 400 × g, and processed for serine protease activity determination. Data were plotted using SigmaPlot 9.0, and sigmoidal curve fitting was performed using the Hill four-parameter equation. Cytotoxicity Assays—U937 cells were plated at a density 0.4 × 106 cells/ml in U937 culture media, with 0.2 ml of cell suspension per well, in 96-well dishes. Vehicle (Me2SO) or compound diluted in Me2SO, were added. In all wells the final Me2SO concentration was 0.5%. After 24 h, some of the cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and processed to measure either cathepsin C activity (see below) or cell viability. For incubations exceeding 24 h, the cells were harvested every 24 h and re-seeded in U937 culture media containing freshly added inhibitors. Viability was determined using the TACS Annexin V-FITC kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer’s specifications and two-color flow cytometric analysis on a FACSCalibur system (BD Biosciences). Cells were considered viable if they failed to stain for annexin V or propidium iodide. Cathepsin C Active Site Labeling—Ala-4-[125I]Phe-DMK (2000 Ci/mmol) was added directly to a final concentration of 0.5 nm to U937 cells (200,000 cells) seeded in culture media and that had been preincubated for 30 min with either vehicle or cathepsin inhibitors. Labeling proceeded for 15 min before quenching by addition of unlabeled Ala-4-(I)Phe-DMK (1 μm). The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 400 × g for 5 min and washed with PBS containing 1 μm of Ala-4-(I)Phe-DMK. The cells were lysed 15 min on ice with 20 mm MES, pH 6.0, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. Proteins were denatured by addition of reducing Laemmli buffer, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and resolved on 10–20% SDS-PAGE gels. The gels were fixed as described below and exposed to film for 6–24 h. [35S]Methionine Labeling and Aprotinin-Agarose Binding—Exponentially growing U937 cells were washed in PBS and plated at 2 × 106 cells/ml in methionine glutamine-free RPMI 1640/10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. The cells were methionine-starved for 30 min before the addition of [35S]methionine (10 μCi/ml). Me2SO (0.5%) or cathepsin inhibitors were added during the methionine starvation. After 30 min, the cells were harvested, washed twice with PBS, re-seeded in complete U937 culture medium in the presence of vehicle or cathepsin C inhibitors, and incubated for an additional 3 h. At the end of the chase period, the cells were washed two times with PBS and lysed on ice for 15 min in lysis buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was mixed with 4 volumes of binding buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40). Where indicated, L-694,458 or cathepsin G inhibitor I was mixed with the lysate 30 min before addition of aprotinin-agarose. The beads were incubated with lysate (or purified serine proteases) for 1 h at room temperature with gentle rotation and pelleted by brief centrifugation at 750 × g. The beads were washed three times with binding buffer and once with lysis buffer A. Bound proteins were eluted by addition of Laemmli buffer and heating at 95 °C for 5 min. The polypeptides were resolved on 10–20% SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen), fixed in 40% methanol/7.5% acetic acid before soaking in Enlightning™ (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and drying. The gels were exposed to Kodak BioMax MR film with intensifying screens for 24–48 h. Densitometry on 35S-labeled CG was performed using a Bio-Rad GS-800 calibrated densitometer and QuantityOne software. Curve fitting was performed with Sigma Plot 9.0 using the Hill four-parameter equation. Western Blotting, Immunoprecipitation, and Silver Stains—New Zealand White rabbits were immunized with keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptide (H-SEIVGGRRARPHC) corresponding to the unprocessed N terminus of pro-human NE using a protocol approved by the Merck & Co. animal care committee. The immunization was followed by successive boosts in complete Freund’s adjuvant. Antibodies were purified from crude antisera on an H-SEIVGGRRARPHC column. The affinity-purified antibody was diluted to 5 μg/ml in TBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and 5% powdered milk and was used to probe nitrocellulose membranes onto which 50 μg of extracts had been transferred. Antigen-antibody complexes were revealed by incubation with anti-rabbit-IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 5000-fold in TBS-T plus 5% milk and development with West-femto chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce) on Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Biosciences). The limit of detection was 20 ng of purified human sputum NE. Immunoprecipitations for each experimental conditions were carried out with extracts from 2 × 106 U937 cells that had been metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine as described above. Rabbit anti-cathepsin G antibodies (10 μg) were added to the extract in a buffer that contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5 m NaCl, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Protein A-Sepharose beads were added for another hour. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 300 × g and washed 3× in binding buffer A and 1× in lysis buffer A. Bound proteins were eluted from the beads with 1× Laemmli buffer and resolved by 10–20% SDS-PAGE. Fluorography was performed as described above. Silver staining was performed using a silver nitrate method described previously (46Rabilloud T. Electrophoresis. 1992; 13: 429-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Protease Activity Assays—Neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G, or proteinase-3 enzymatic activities were measured from U937 and EcoM-G cytosolic lysates, in a final assay volume of 110 μl. Briefly, cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed with either NE lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40) for serine protease assays, or with cathepsin C lysis buffer (25 mm MES, pH 6.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 0.2% Nonidet P-40) for cathepsin C assays. Debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and supernatants were retained. The extracts were mixed with assay buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 m NaCl) supplemented with a peptide substrate specific for the serine protease assessed: for NE, 400 μm methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-AMC; for CG, 1 mm Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide; and for Pr-3, 10 μm L2p-Tyr-Asp-Ala-Lys-Gly-Asp-Dpa-NH2 (47Koehl C. Knight G. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12609-12612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Cleavage of the substrate was monitored spectrophotometrically using Spectramax plate readers (Molecular Devices), and kinetic rates were calculated from the linear portion of the reaction. Release of AMC was measured with excitation at 370 nm and emission of 450 nm for 10 min. For p-nitroanilide, substrate cleavage was measured by absorbance at 405 nm for 5 min. Pr-3 substrate cleavage was monitored by loss of intramolecular substrate quenching (excitation, 328 nm; emission, 393 nm) for 5 min. The specificity of each reaction was ascertained by using protease inhibitors (L-694,458 for NE, and cathepsin G inhibitor I for CG). NE activity in U937 and EcoM-G was fully inhibited by L-694,458, and similarly, the CG activity detected in crude lysates was completely inhibited by cathepsin G inhibitor I. To demonstrate that cleavage of L2p-Tyr-Asp-Ala-Lys-Gly-Asp-Dpa-NH2 was due to Pr-3 and not NE in crude EcoM-G lysates, the serpin SLPI was used. SLPI is active against NE but not against Pr-3. Cleavage of L2p-Tyr-Asp-Ala-Lys-Gly-Asp-Dpa-NH2 was not inhibited by SLPI, whereas cleavage of methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-AMC was abolished in the presence of SLPI. 5N. Méthot, data not shown. Cathepsin C activity was determined in a similar manner on cytosolic extracts normalized for protein content and on purified recombinant protein (R&D Systems). The assay was performed by mixing the lysate (diluted 1:10 in cathepsin C lysis buffer) to 25 mm MES, pH 6.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, supplemented with 50 μm of NH2-Gly-Arg-AMC. The concentration of substrate used for the cathepsin C assay is equivalent to twice the Km value, under the assay conditions used. When using purified enzyme, 1 nm cathepsin C was used. Cathepsin L enzymatic assays were performed with purified recombinant cathepsin L (R&D Systems) with 0.35 nm enzyme, 2 μm substrate (Z-Phe-Arg-AMC) in 50 mm MES, pH 5.5, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm DTT, and 10% Me2SO. Human recombinant cathepsin S (Calbiochem) was used at 1 nm with 40 μm Z-Val-Val-Arg-AMC in 50 mm MES, pH 6.5, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm DTT, 100 mm NaCl, 0.001% bovine serum albumin, and 10% Me2SO. Cathepsin H activity was assayed with 2.1 μg/ml enzyme in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm DTT, and 20 μm Z-Arg-AMC. Cathepsin B assays were performed with 1 nm enzyme in 50 mm MES, pH 6.0, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm DTT, 0.001% Triton X-100, 10% Me2SO, and 83 μm t-butoxycarbonyl-Leu-Lys-Arg-AMC. In all cases, the potencies of the compounds on the various cathepsins were determined by preincubating the diluted enzyme with the inhibitor for 10 min, and then adding the protease substrate. All reactions were carried out at room temperature. Cell Permeability and Cytotoxicity of Selective Nitrile Cathepsin C Inhibitors—Gly-Phe-DMK is the only cathepsin C inhibitor described to date that was shown to block NE and CG activities in U937 cells, albeit incompletely, and only after 3 days or more of incubation (12McGuire M.J.

Both inhibitors fully blocked cathepsin C activity but showed significant cytotoxicity, with only 32% viable cells remaining after 72 h of incubation with 1 μm inhibitor (Table 2). New cathepsin C inhibitors from the dipeptide α-aminoacetonitrile class (supplemental Table S1) were therefore prepared and tested for cytotoxicity and cathepsin C inhibition. Nitrile inhibitors reversibly block cysteine protease activity (48Robichaud J. Oballa R. Prasit P. Falgueyret J-P. Percival M.D Wesolowski G. Rodan S.B. Kimmel D. Johnson C. Bryant C. Venkatraman S.

https://openalex.org/W2006551808,"Tic40 is a component of the protein import apparatus of the inner envelope of chloroplasts, but its role in the import mechanism has not been clearly defined. The C terminus of Tic40 shares weak similarity with the C-terminal Sti1 domains of the mammalian Hsp70-interacting protein (Hip) and Hsp70/Hsp90-organizing protein (Hop) co-chaperones. Additionally, Tic40 may possess a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) protein-protein interaction domain, another characteristic feature of Hip/Hop co-chaperones. To investigate the functional importance of different parts of the Tic40 protein and to determine whether the homology between Tic40 and co-chaperones is functionally significant, different Tic40 deletion and Tic40:Hip fusion constructs were generated and assessed for complementation activity in the Arabidopsis Tic40 knock-out mutant, tic40. Interestingly, all Tic40 deletion constructs failed to complement tic40, indicating that each part removed is essential for Tic40 function; these included a construct lacking the Sti1-like domain (ΔSti1), a second lacking a central region, including the putative TPR domain (ΔTPR), and a third lacking the predicted transmembrane anchor region. Moreover, the ΔSti1 and ΔTPR constructs caused strong dominant-negative, albino phenotypes in tic40 transformants, indicating that the truncated Tic40 proteins interfere with the residual chloroplast protein import that occurs in tic40 plants. Remarkably, the Tic40:Hip fusion constructs showed that the Sti1 domain of human Hip is functionally equivalent to the Sti1-like region of Tic40, strongly suggesting a co-chaperone role for the Tic40 protein. Supporting this notion, yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays demonstrated the in vivo interaction of Tic40 with Tic110, a protein believed to recruit stromal chaperones to protein import sites.

Most chloroplast proteins are nucleus-encoded, synthesized in precursor form (each one with a cleavable transit peptide), and post-translationally imported into the organelle (1Bédard J. Jarvis P. J.

Import is mediated by translocon complexes in the outer and inner envelope membranes, termed TOC 2The abbreviations used are: TOC, translocon at the outer envelope membrane of chloroplasts; TIC, translocon at the inner envelope membrane of chloroplasts; BiFC, bimolecular fluorescence complementation; Hip, Hsp70-interacting protein; Hop, Hsp70/Hsp90-organizing protein; TPR, tetratricopeptide repeat; CaMV, cauliflower mosaic virus; GBD, Gal4 DNA-binding domain; GAD, Gal4 activation domain; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; mtHsp70, matrix Hsp70; AtHip, A. thaliana Hip; hs, H. sapiens; ps, Pisum sativum; at, A. thaliana; rn, R. norvegicus. and TIC, respectively. Once translocation through the TOC is initiated, this complex associates with the TIC allowing preprotein transport across both membranes simultaneously. Several components of the TIC complex have been identified, including Tic40 and Tic110, but the functions of many of these proteins remain unclear (1Bédard J. Jarvis P. J. Exp.

The TIC complex also recruits stromal chaperones, which are thought to drive protein import and mediate the folding of newly imported proteins (5Kessler F. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7684-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 6Akita M. Nielsen E. Keegstra K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 7Nielsen E. Akita M.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 991-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Tic40 was identified by its association with preproteins undergoing import (9Ko K. Budd D. Wu C. Seibert F. Kourtz L.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37467-37472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Like Tic110, the bulk of Tic40 protrudes into the stroma where it may interact with stromal chaperones (12Chou M.L. Fitzpatrick L.M. Tu S.L. Budziszewski G. Potter-Lewis S. Akita M. Levin J.Z.

Plant J. 2005; 41: 412-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Tic40 shares homology with eukaryotic Hip and Hop co-chaperones (11Stahl T. Glockmann C. Soll J. Heins L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37467-37472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 12Chou M.L. Fitzpatrick L.M. Tu S.L. Budziszewski G. Potter-Lewis S. Akita M. Levin J.Z. Keegstra K. Li H.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2970-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Weak sequence similarity between Tic40 and Hip/Hop is restricted to ∼60 C-terminal residues, which in the co-chaperones constitute a conserved region termed the Sti1 domain (Sti1 is the yeast homolog of Hop). However, in silico and immunological studies have revealed that the C-proximal region of Tic40 immediately upstream of the putative Sti1 domain likely contains a TPR domain, which is another characteristic feature of Hip/Hop co-chaperones (12Chou M.L. Fitzpatrick L.M. Tu S.L. Budziszewski G. Potter-Lewis S. Akita M. Levin J.Z. Keegstra K. Li H.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2970-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Hip interacts with Hsp70 and regulates its ATPase cycle by stabilizing the ADP-bound, high substrate affinity form of the chaperone (14Hoöhfeld J. Minami Y. Hartl F.U. Cell. 1995; 83: 589-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). In addition, Hip possesses intrinsic chaperone activity, binding specifically to unfolded proteins and preventing their aggregation (14Hoöhfeld J. Minami Y. Hartl F.U. Cell. 1995; 83: 589-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 15Bruce B.D. Churchich J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 738-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Hop interacts with both Hsp70 and Hsp90 to mediate their association (16Chen S. Smith D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35194-35200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 17Johnson B.D. Schumacher R.J. Ross E.D. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3679-3686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) but, unlike Hip, does not seem to function as a chaperone itself (18Bose S. Weikl T. Bugl H. Buchner J. Science. 1996; 274: 1715-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 19Freeman B.C. Toft D.O. Morimoto R.I. Science. 1996; 274: 1718-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Together, Hip and Hop facilitate the transfer of some Hsp70-bound protein substrates (e.g. steroid hormone receptors) to Hsp90, in order for them to undergo further folding and reach their final conformation (20Frydman J. Hoöhfeld J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 87-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In addition to Tic40, the Arabidopsis genome encodes two Hip homologs, AtHip-1 and AtHip-2 (21Webb M.A. Cavaletto J.M. Klanrit P. Thompson G.A. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2001; 6: 247-255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The former is structurally similar to mammalian Hip along its entire length, and so it is likely to function as a canonical Hip co-chaperone. The latter possesses a truncated Hip-like region and a thioredoxin domain, suggesting an involvement in redox regulation. Neither are closely related to Tic40. The homology between Tic40 and Hip/Hop co-chaperones suggests that Tic40 may play similar (co)chaperone roles during chloroplast import. In mitochondrial protein import (which is functionally similar to chloroplast import), matrix Hsp70 (mtHsp70) is the key component of the presequence translocase-associated motor, the complex that drives preprotein translocation (22Wiedemann N. Frazier A.E. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14473-14476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 23Neupert W. Brunner M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In addition to mtHsp70, the presequence translocase-associated motor contains Tim44, which recruits mtHsp70 to the import site, and a range of co-chaperones that regulate mtHsp70 activity (22Wiedemann N. Frazier A.E. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14473-14476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In chloroplasts, Hsp70 is not associated functionally with the TIC (6Akita M. Nielsen E. Keegstra K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 7Nielsen E. Akita M. Davila-Aponte J. Keegstra K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 935-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 8Kouranov A. Chen X. Fuks B. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 991-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Instead, the Hsp100 homolog, Hsp93, associates with the translocon in an ATP-dependent fashion and is thought to be functionally analogous to mtHsp70 (6Akita M. Nielsen E. Keegstra K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 7Nielsen E. Akita M. Davila-Aponte J. Keegstra K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 935-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 8Kouranov A. Chen X. Fuks B. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 991-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Tic110 has been proposed to recruit Hsp93 to the stromal face of the TIC (cf. Tim44 in mitochondria) and to provide an initial binding site for preproteins as they emerge into the stroma (6Akita M. Nielsen E. Keegstra K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 7Nielsen E. Akita M. Davila-Aponte J. Keegstra K.

Chem. 2003; 278: 38617-38627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). More recently, Tic40 was reported to mediate the regulation of Hsp93 activity and the transferral of translocating preproteins between other components of the TIC complex (25Chou M.L. Chu C.C. Chen L.J. Akita M. Li H.M. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 893-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The former role is supported by the fact that yeast Hop (Sti1) is able to interact with Hsp104, another Hsp100 chaperone (26Abbas-Terki T. Donzé O. Briand P.A. Picard D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7569-7575Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Tic110, Hsp93, and Tic40 were found to associate with a translocating preprotein at a similar late stage of import (12Chou M.L. Fitzpatrick L.M. Tu S.L. Budziszewski G. Potter-Lewis S. Akita M. Levin J.Z. Keegstra K. Li H.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2970-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Arabidopsis knock-out mutations, tic110, hsp93, and tic40, interact genetically, supporting the notion that the proteins cooperate functionally in vivo (13Kovacheva S. Bédard J. Patel R. Dudley P. Twell D. Riíos G. Koncz C. Jarvis P. Plant J. 2005; 41: 412-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To further investigate the hypothesis that Arabidopsis Tic40 (atTic40) plays (co)chaperone roles during import, we assessed its functional similarity with human Hip; domain-swap constructs were generated and tested for their ability to complement the tic40 knock-out mutation in Arabidopsis plants. Additionally, to determine the importance of different domains of Tic40, a series of atTIC40 deletion constructs were used in similar tic40 complementation studies. Plant Materials and Growth—All Arabidopsis thaliana plants were of the Columbia-0 ecotype. The tic40-4 mutant used has been described previously (13Kovacheva S. Bédard J. Patel R. Dudley P. Twell D. Riíos G. Koncz C. Jarvis P. Plant J. 2005; 41: 412-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Plants were grown on Murashige-Skoog medium using published procedures (13Kovacheva S. Bédard J. Patel R. Dudley P. Twell D. Riíos G. Koncz C. Jarvis P. Plant J. 2005; 41: 412-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 27Aronsson H. Jarvis P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Constructs were stably introduced into tic40-4 plants using the floral dip method (28Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Complementation Construct Generation—cDNA fragments for construct assembly were amplified using Proof Start polymerase (Qiagen, Crawley, UK). The atTic40 template for amplification was cDNA 144K24T7 (accession T76608), whereas the hsHip template included the full coding sequence between the NcoI and KpnI sites of pSPUTK (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Constructs were assembled from PCR fragments and cDNA restriction fragments downstream of the atTIC40 promoter in pSP72 (Promega, Madison, WI). Promoter-construct fusions were transferred to a pBluescript II KS (Stratagene) derivative containing the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S terminator. These cassettes were transferred to the pBin19 T-DNA vector for Agrobacterium and plant transformation. Because the atTIC40 promoter used in these constructs failed to drive robust expression, it was replaced by the CaMV 35S promoter. A detailed account of these cloning procedures is provided as Supplemental Material. Characterization of Transgenic Lines—Chlorophyll quantification, immunoblotting, reverse transcription-PCR, electron microscopy, chloroplast isolation, and protein import assays were all conducted using standard procedures, as described previously (13Kovacheva S. Bédard J. Patel R. Dudley P. Twell D. Riíos G. Koncz C. Jarvis P. Plant J. 2005; 41: 412-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 27Aronsson H. Jarvis P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—Assays were done using the Matchmaker GAL4 Two-hybrid System 3 (Clontech). Gal4 DNA-binding domain (GBD) fusions were made in the pGBKT7 vector, and Gal4 activation domain (GAD) fusions were made in the pGADT7 vector. Sequence encoding the soluble domain of atTic40 (Tic40ΔN; residues 129-447 of the precursor) was cloned from cDNA 144K24T7 as a DraI-BamHI fragment into SmaI-BamHI-cut pGBKT7 or pGADT7; note that the pGBKT7-Tic40 clone was unusable for interaction analysis, because it caused strong auto-activation of the HIS3 histidine reporter. Sequence encoding the soluble domain of atTic110 (Tic110ΔN; residues 144-1016 of the precursor) was amplified from cDNA RAFL09-95-B13 (accession AY099850) using the following primers: Tic110 SmaI forward, 5′-acc cgg gtg tac cgg agg tag ctg-3′; Tic110 XhoI reverse, 5′-act cga gga ttt aaa aga cga aat tgc c-3′. After sequencing, the SmaI-XhoI-cut Tic110 fragment was cloned into SmaI-XhoI-cut pGADT7 and into SmaI-SalI-cut pGBKT7. The constructs were co-transformed into yeast strain AH109 for the plate growth assays. The control clones, pGBKT7-p53 (pGBKT7-53) and pGADT7-SV40T (pGADT7-T), were supplied by the manufacturer (Clontech). Quantitative growth assays were conducted using yeast strain HF7c, essentially as described previously (29Maple J. Aldridge C. Møller S.G. Plant J. 2005; 43: 811-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) except that cultures were grown to an A600 of 0.5 prior to spotting. The difference in growth on synthetic dropout (SD) medium lacking histidine, tryptophan, and leucine (SD-HTL) versus SD medium lacking tryptophan and leucine (SD-TL) was measured after 1 day only. Fluorescence Microscopy—Full-length coding sequences for atTic40 and atTic110, as well as the atTic40 ΔTM deletion mutant (all three lacking stop codons), were amplified by PCR using cDNA templates described above and the ΔTM binary construct with the following primers: Tic40 XhoI forward, 5′-act cga gat atg gag aac ctt acc cta g-3′; Tic40 KpnI reverse, 5′-agg tac ccg tca ttc ctg gga aga gct g-3′; Tic110 XhoI forward, 5′-tct cga gac cat gaa tcc ctc act c-3′; and Tic110 KpnI reverse, 5′-tgg tac caa aga cga aat tgc cct c-3′. To generate full-length YFP fusions, all three sequences were cloned as XhoI-KpnI fragments into pWEN18 (30Kost B. Spielhofer P. Chua N.H. Plant J. 1998; 16: 393-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To generate half-YFP fusions for the bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays, the two full-length sequences were cloned the same way into pWEN-NY and pWEN-CY (29Maple J. Aldridge C. Møller S.G. Plant J. 2005; 43: 811-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Protoplasts were prepared from 14-day-old, wild-type Arabidopsis seedlings essentially as described previously (31Jin J.B. Kim Y.A. Kim S.J. Lee S.H. Kim D.H. Cheong G.W. Hwang I. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1511-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Seedlings were chopped with a razor blade in solution containing 2% cellulose and 0.08% macerozyme and incubated for 3.5 h. For transfection, 5 μg of plasmid DNA (per clone) was used with 100 μl of protoplast suspension (2 × 106 per ml) and 110 μl of 40% PEG4000 solution. Fluorescence analysis was performed using a Nikon Eclipse TE-2000E inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with filters for analyzing YFP (exciter HQ500/20x, emitter HQ535/30m) and chlorophyll autofluorescence (exciter D480/30x, emitter D660/50m) (Chroma Technologies, Rockingham, VT). For BiFC analysis, samples were analyzed 16-24 h after (co)transfection. The pWEN-NY-Tic110 with pWEN-CY-Tic40 combination was repeated three times and with relevant controls; the empty vectors (pWEN-NY and pWEN-CY) and the pWEN-NY-Tic110 with pWEN-CY-Tic40 clones did not produce detectable fluorescence when transformed alone (data not shown; supplemental Fig. S5). atTic40 Contains Several Conserved Domains—To identify regions of Tic40 that may be important for function, Tic40 sequences from different plant species were aligned (supplemental Fig. S1). The degree of conservation varied considerably along the length of the alignment. Distinct, highly conserved regions corresponding to the transit peptide cleavage site and the predicted transmembrane domain (11Stahl T. Glockmann C. Soll J. Heins L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37467-37472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) were detected. In addition, three conserved motifs were found in the central part, upstream of a highly conserved C-terminal region. Very high conservation in the C-terminal ∼150 residues suggested that this region may contain one or more important functional domains. Interestingly, the C terminus of atTic40 was found to display weak similarity to the C termini of eukaryotic Hip and Hop co-chaperones, as reported previously (11Stahl T. Glockmann C. Soll J. Heins L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37467-37472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 12Chou M.L. Fitzpatrick L.M. Tu S.L. Budziszewski G. Potter-Lewis S. Akita M. Levin J.Z. Keegstra K. Li H.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2970-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, only an ∼60 residue C-terminal region of atTic40 shows clear homology to the Hip/Hop proteins (Fig. 1A); previous comparisons of Hip and Hop led to the detection of this conserved domain, termed the Sti1 domain (14Hoöhfeld J. Minami Y. Hartl F.U. Cell. 1995; 83: 589-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The human Hip (hsHip) Sti1 domain shares low but significant similarity with the human Hop (hsHop) Sti1 domain, equivalent to ∼25% identity across 60 residues. As shown in Fig. 1B, the atTic40 C terminus is more similar to the Sti1 domains of mammalian Hip proteins (35% identity) than to those of mammalian Hop proteins (19% identity). This homology with the Hip/Hop Sti1 domains suggests that this region of atTic40 may constitute a conserved Sti1 domain. Moreover, the fact that it resides at the extreme C terminus suggests that it may perform a similar function. Deletion Mutants of the atTic40 Protein—To investigate the functional importance of different parts of the Tic40 protein, three deletion constructs were made from a full-length atTIC40 cDNA (Fig. 1C): ΔTM lacked codons 95-136, including the predicted transmembrane domain; ΔSti1 lacked codons 391-447 and contained a premature in-frame stop codon (introduction of these mutations also generated an I390L missense mutation); and ΔTPR lacked the entire region between the predicted transmembrane and Sti1 domains (codons 139-389), including the C-proximal region proposed to constitute a TPR domain (an in-frame fusion between residues 138 and 390 was generated, as well as an A137V missense mutation). The deletion constructs (and the full-length atTIC40 cDNA, termed WT40) were inserted into a T-DNA vector carrying the CaMV 35S promoter and terminator sequences and used to transform tic40 knock-out plants. Multiple (≥19) transformants (T1 plants) were identified for each of the four constructs. Single insertion lines (segregating three resistant T2 plants for every sensitive T2 plant) were further propagated to identify homozygous lines. These were subjected to PCR genotyping, to confirm homozygosity of the tic40 mutation and the presence of the appropriate atTic40 transgene (supplemental Fig. S2), before further analysis. As expected, the positive control construct, WT40, complemented tic40 fully, restoring wild-type-like appearance and growth in most transformants (Fig. 2A). By contrast, none of the atTic40 deletion constructs gave clear tic40 complementation (Fig. 2A). A total of 24, 34, and 38 transformants were identified for ΔTM, ΔSti1, and ΔTPR, respectively. All ΔTM transformants displayed a tic40-like phenotype (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, identification of ΔTPR transformants (and, to a lesser extent, ΔSti1 transformants) was more difficult, because many plants displayed a more severe phenotype than the tic40 mutant: i.e. seedlings with very small, albino cotyledons. Most ΔTPR transformants (23 of 38) produced T2 progenies containing seedlings with albino cotyledons, whereas only three of the ΔSti1 transformants expressed the albino phenotype (Fig. 2A). The effects of the various deletion constructs were quantified by measuring chlorophyll concentrations in several representative lines (Fig. 2B). As expected, chlorophyll levels in WT40 plants were comparable with those in the wild type, and those in tic40-like ΔTM and ΔSti1 transformants were comparable with those in tic40. By contrast, albino ΔTPR seedlings contained drastically reduced levels of chlorophyll (∼11% of the amount in tic40). atTic40 Deletion Mutants Are Expressed and Targeted to Chloroplasts—Failure of the deletion constructs to complement tic40 suggested that the deleted proteins were nonfunctional or that they were not expressed and/or targeted to chloroplasts properly. To eliminate the latter possibilities, we assessed accumulation of the proteins by immunoblotting, using an antibody raised against the pea Tic40 (psTic40) C terminus (residues 128-436) (11Stahl T. Glockmann C. Soll J. Heins L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37467-37472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). As expected, WT40 control plants overexpressed a Tic40 protein of the same size (∼44 kDa) as that in wild type (Fig. 3A); that the apparent size of mature atTic40 is larger than predicted (41 kDa) is consistent with previous observations and may be due to its high proline content (12Chou M.L. Fitzpatrick L.M. Tu S.L. Budziszewski G. Potter-Lewis S. Akita M. Levin J.Z. Keegstra K. Li H.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2970-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This protein could also be detected in isolated chloroplasts, where it was resistant to exogenously applied thermolysin protease, demonstrating proper targeting to the organelle (Fig. 3B). Expression products were also detected in ΔTM, ΔSti1, and ΔTPR plants (Fig. 3A). In the ΔTM lines, two faint bands were detected: one at ∼43 kDa and another more diffuse band at ∼36 kDa (Fig. 3A). It was recently reported that the atTic40 precursor is subjected to two distinct proteolytic processing events during its targeting to the inner envelope membrane (32Li M. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The first processing event is carried out by the stromal processing peptidase, which cleaves after residue 42 to yield an intermediate form of the protein in the stroma; the second event occurs concomitantly with inner membrane insertion and is mediated by a thus far unidentified, envelope-associated peptidase that cleaves after residue 76 (supplemental Fig. S1). Because the transmembrane domain of atTic40 is essential for membrane insertion (32Li M. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), our ΔTM protein is predicted to accumulate as an intermediate in the stroma. Thus, the ∼43-kDa band in Fig. 3A most likely corresponds to the intermediate form of the ΔTM protein, which has a calculated size of 40 kDa but is expected to have a larger apparent size (12Chou M.L. Fitzpatrick L.M. Tu S.L. Budziszewski G. Potter-Lewis S. Akita M. Levin J.Z. Keegstra K. Li H.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2970-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, a ΔTM:YFP fusion protein yielded distinctly stromal fluorescence in transfected Arabidopsis protoplasts, which was in marked contrast with the envelope-associated fluorescence provided by a full-length atTic40:YFP fusion (supplemental Fig. S3). The low abundance of the ΔTM intermediate (Fig. 3A) probably reflects the instability of the protein when mis-localized to the stroma. We therefore suggest that the additional, diffuse band at ∼36 kDa includes stromal proteolytic fragments of the ΔTM protein (Fig. 3A). Consistent with this interpretation, this band was resolved into at least two distinct fragments in Fig. 3B. As expected, all detected ΔTM forms (∼43- and ∼36-kDa fragments) were completely protected from protease in isolated chloroplasts, indicating that all bands contained fully imported protein (Fig. 3B). In the ΔSti1 lines, a single and abundant protein of ∼35 kDa was detected. This is most likely the mature, processed ΔSti1 protein (calculated size, 34 kDa), because it was also detected in isolated, protease-treated chloroplasts (Fig. 3B). Finally, a protein of the expected size (13 kDa) was detected in ΔTPR seedlings (Fig. 3A). It was not possible to isolate chloroplasts from these albino seedlings, but the strong effect of the ΔTPR protein on chloroplast biogenesis (Fig. 2, A and B) strongly suggests that it too is properly targeted to the organelle. The fact that the ΔTM, ΔSti1, and ΔTPR proteins are expressed (and, in the case of ΔTM and ΔSti1, properly targeted to chloroplasts) means that their failure to complement tic40 can be attributed to effects o"

In this context, we analyzed the catalytic properties and solved the crystal structure of phenylalanine hydroxylase from the psychrophilic bacterium Colwellia psychrerythraea 34H (CpPAH). CpPAH displays highest activity with tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) as cofactor and at 25 °C (15 °C above the optimal growth temperature). Although the enzyme is monomeric with a single l-Phe-binding site, the substrate binds cooperatively. In comparison with PAH from mesophilic bacteria and mammalian organisms, CpPAH shows elevated [S0.5](l-Phe) (= 1.1 ± 0.1 mm) and Km(BH4)(= 0.3 ± 0.1 mm), as well as high catalytic efficiency at 10 °C. However, the half-inactivation and denaturation temperature is only slightly lowered (Tm ∼ 52 °C; where Tm is half-denaturation temperature), in contrast to other cold-adapted enzymes. The crystal structure shows regions of local flexibility close to the highly solvent accessible binding sites for BH4 (Gly87/Phe88/Gly89) and l-Phe (Tyr114–Pro118). Normal mode and COREX analysis also detect these and other areas with high flexibility. Greater mobility around the active site and disrupted hydrogen bonding abilities for the cofactor appear to represent cold-adaptive properties that do not markedly affect the thermostability of CpPAH.

There appears to be an extensive increase in flexibility in certain regions of the structures investigated, accompanied by high activity at low temperatures and some increase in thermolability (2Methe B.A. Nelson K.E.

PAH is a non-heme iron-dependent enzyme, which in mammals is found mainly in the liver catalyzing the hydroxylation of l-Phe using molecular oxygen and (6R)-l-erythro-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) as co-substrates. In mammals this is the first step in the catabolism of l-Phe to carbon dioxide and water. In humans, excessively high levels of l-Phe are toxic to the brain, and a dysfunction of human PAH is associated with phenylketonuria (for review see Ref. 5Scriver C.R. Kaufman S. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Valle D. Sly W.S. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 1667-1724Google Scholar). In fact, other severe human diseases (e.g. alcaptonuria, tyrosinemia, tyrosinosis, Richner-Hanhart syndrome, and hawkinsinuria) are also associated with enzyme deficiencies in the catabolism of l-Phe and l-Tyr. Over the past few years, the functional and structural studies of several forms of human and rat PAH, including free and ligand-bound states and disease-related mutants, have advanced the understanding of the main catalytic features of the enzyme and genotype-phenotype relationships in phenylketonuria (6Erlandsen H.

In bacteria, PAH is relatively rare and is found predominantly within the phylum Proteobacteria. PAH from Chromobacterium violaceum (CvPAH) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been cloned, purified, biochemically characterized, and crystallized (10Nakata H. Yamauchi T. Fujisawa H. J. Biol.

Bacterial PAH crystal structure determination has been reported only for CvPAH, which shares the fold of the catalytic domain of human and rat PAHs (14Erlandsen H. Kim J.Y. Patch M.G. Han A. Volner A. Abu-Omar M.M. Stevens R.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 645-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The physiological role of PAH in bacteria is unclear, but studies of the PAH system in P. aeruginosa have provided some insights into the catabolic function of the enzyme. Interestingly, expression of PAH (PhhA) and of a bacterial ortholog of pterin 4a-carbinolamine dehydratase (PhhB), both included in the same operon, is required to enable the organism to utilize l-Phe as a sole carbon source (16Song J. Xia T. Jensen R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2789-2796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Song J. Jensen R.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 497-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, the finding that activation of both PhhA and PhhB expression by l-Phe occurs also in the presence of better carbon sources such as glucose indicates that this operon might be dedicated to the provision of derivative compounds of l-Phe (17Song J. Jensen R.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 497-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Functional studies of bacterial enzymes have improved our understanding of bacterial metabolism, adaptation, and evolution and are also relevant to the understanding of the mammalian orthologs. The evolution of mammalian PAH and of the other aromatic amino acid hydroxylases, i.e. tyrosine hydroxylase and tryptophan hydroxylases, 1 and 2, appears to have proceeded via juxtaposition of bacterial PAH with a precursor of the regulatory domain of chorismate mutase-prephenate dehydratase (P-protein) (18Aravind L. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 1023-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 19Xie G. Brettin T.S. Bonner C.A. Jensen R.A. Microb. Comp.

Amino Acids (Vienna). 2005; 28: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), corresponding to the N-terminal regulatory domain of the hydroxylases. Tetrameric eukaryotic PAH, which is highly regulated both by phosphorylation and positive cooperativity for l-Phe, could thus have evolved from a monomeric bacterial PAH. Here we report the cloning, expression, purification, and the structural and functional characterization of the monomeric bacterial PAH from the psychrophilic bacterium C. psychrerythraea (CpPAH). The structure of the enzyme has been analyzed and compared with that of ortholog PAHs from the mesophilic prokaryote C. violaceum (CvPAH; optimum growth temperature, 25 °C) and human (hPAH). The structural features help to explain the kinetic properties and particular cold-adaptive characteristics of CpPAH. Growth of C. psycherythraea 34H and Detection of Gene Expression—C. psychrerythraea 34H was grown to stationary phase in Marine Broth (Difco 2216) at 9 °C. Pellets were resuspended in freshly prepared Tris-EDTA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) with lysozyme (0.4 mg/ml) and incubated at room temperature for 5 min before the total RNA was isolated using the SV (“spin or vacuum”) total RNA isolation kit according to the manufacturer's manual (Promega). PAH mRNA was subsequently detected using the following primer and the reverse transcriptase SuperScript™ (Invitrogen): 5′-CCTTAAGCTCGAGACTGGCTTTTTTCACCGGAAATT-3′. Amplification was performed using Phusion™ DNA polymerase (Finnzymes) in a PCR using the following primers: 5′-GGGAATTCCATATGGCAAAAGGAACAAAGTATGTT-3′ and 5′-CCTTAAGCTCGAGACTGGCTTTTTTCACCGGAAATT-3′ (NdeI and XhoI restriction sites are underlined). C. psychrerythraea genomic DNA was used as positive control (not shown). Cloning, Expression, and Purification—The PAH gene from C. psycherythraea 34H (CpPAH) was amplified by PCR using the primers described above. The PCR products were purified using the Stratagene PCR purification kit, digested with NdeI and BamHI, and ligated into NdeI-BamHI-digested pET-30a using the rapid DNA ligation kit (Roche Applied Sciences). Recombinant CpPAH was overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 Star™(DE3) by growing transformed cells in LB broth containing kanamycin (30 μg/ml) at 37 °C and induction with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Eight hours after induction at 22 °C (A600 nm = 0.7–0.8), the cells were harvested and disrupted using a French press, and the supernatant was applied to a TALON® Superflow metal affinity resin column (Clontech). C-terminal His6-tagged-CpPAH was purified at 4 °C by washing with 10 mm imidazole and eluting with 150 mm imidazole in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7, followed by size-exclusion chromatography on a HiLoad Superdex 200 column, which also removed the imidazole. The enzyme was kept concentrated in 20 mm NaHepes, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, in liquid nitrogen. The catalytic domain (Gly103–Gln428) of human PAH (hPAH) was purified as described previously (22Knappskog P.M. Flatmark T. Aarden J.M. Haavik J. Martínez A. Eur. J.

Activity Measurements—Steady-state PAH activity was measured by high pressure liquid chromatography with fluorimetric detection of l-Tyr (23Døskeland A.P. Døskeland S.O. Øgreid D. Flatmark T. J.

Under the selected standard assay conditions, the amount of product was linear with time (up to 5 min) and amount of enzyme (up to 5 μg) when l-Phe and BH4 were added simultaneously to initiate the assay. [S0.5] and Km values were determined at the specified temperature and concentrations of l-Phe and BH4 (with or without 5 min preincubation with l-Phe) and customarily with 1 μg of CpPAH and a 1-min assay. The data were fitted to a Hill equation (for l-Phe) or to a Michaelis-Menten equation (for BH4). Thermal inactivation experiments were performed by incubating the enzyme at the indicated temperatures in 20 mm NaHepes, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7, in the absence and the presence of 5 mm l-Phe for 10 min, followed by chilling of the samples on ice and immediate assay (1 min at 10 °C). Tyrosine hydroxylase activity was measured at 10 and 20 °C as described (25Reinhard Jr., J.F. Smith G.K. Nichol C.A. Life Sci. 1986; 39: 2185-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), using reaction mixtures containing 0.2–1.0 μg of purified CpPAH, 0.05 mg/ml catalase, 20 μm ferrous ammonium sulfate, and 50 μm l-Tyr and initiating the reactions by adding BH4 (up to 1 mm) with 5 mm dithiothreitol, and up to a 10-min reaction time. The l-Tyr-dependent oxidation of the cofactor was measured using a similar reaction mixture but additionally including 200 μm NADH and 0.4 units of dihydropteridine reductase (from sheep liver; Sigma). The reaction was started by adding 75 μm BH4, and ΔA340 was recorded for 1 min. The rate of NADH oxidation (pterin oxidation) was calculated using ϵ340 nm = 6220 m-1·cm-1. CD Spectroscopy—CD was performed as described (26Thórólfsson M. Ibarra-Molero B. Fojan P. Petersen S.B. Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Martínez A.

Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Determination—Crystallization was performed using the hanging drop method. Crystals of native CpPAH were grown by mixing 1-μl drops of 10 mg/ml protein (in 20 mm NaHepes, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.0) with a 1-μl reservoir solution containing 1.6–1.8 m ammonium sulfate, 100 mm NaCl, and 20 mm NaHepes, pH 7.5. The drops were equilibrated at 4 °C, and crystals suitable for data collection purposes appeared after about 3 weeks. The crystals had overall dimensions of ∼120 × 100 × 80 μm3, were cryo-protected with 25% glycerol and the reservoir additives, and flash-cooled in a nitrogen stream (Oxford Instruments) operating at 100 K. One crystal was soaked in 1 mm 7,8-dihydrobiopterin (BH2), 1.9 m ammonium sulfate, 80 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 25% glycerol for 15 min at 4 °C and then flash-cooled. This surprisingly resulted in the apo form of CpPAH with the iron atom missing in the crystal structure. All diffraction data were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), Grenoble, France, at ID14-EH1 (for the native, holo-CpPAH) and at the Swiss-Norwegian Beamline (CpPAH-apo). The crystals belong to the space group P21 with unit cell dimensions for the native structure of a = 40.28 Å, b = 86.02 Å, c = 87.57 Å, and β = 97.01°. The two molecules in the asymmetric unit (A/B) give a water content of 49% and a Matthews coefficient of 2.5 Å3/Da. The native structure was solved by the molecular replacement method using MOLREP (28Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Cryst. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4137) Google Scholar) and the crystal structure of PAH from C. violaceum (CvPAH, PDB 1LTV) as search model. The refinement and incorporation of solvent molecules were done using REF-MAC5 (29Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Lebedev A. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

The final native model includes 536 residues, 2 iron atoms, and 847 water molecules, resulting in an R-factor of 16.4% and an R-free of 19.52%.

The program HBPLUS version 3.15 (31McDonald I.K. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 777-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar) was used to calculate hydrogen bonds satisfying the following criteria for the parameters Donor (D), Acceptor (A), Acceptor Antecedents (AA), and (calculated) hydrogen (H): maximum distances for D-A 3.5 Å, H-A 2.5 Å; minimum angle for D-H-A, D-A-AA, and H-A-AA of 90°. All ion pairs were included in the calculations. The WHAT IF Web Interface (32Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8 (52-56): 29Google Scholar) was used to identify ion pairs with interatomic distances <6 or <4 Å between the side chains of Asp or Glu to Arg, Lys, or His residues. Electrostatic surfaces were calculated with DelPHi (33Rocchia W. Sridharan S. Nicholls A. Alexov E. Chiabrera A. Honig B. J. Comput. Chem. 2002; 23: 128-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar) and displayed with PyMOL (DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA). Models of CpPAH with only BH4 and with BH4 and the substrate analog (2-thienyl)-l-alanine (THA) were prepared based on the hPAH·BH4 (PDB 1J8U) and hPAH·Fe(II)·BH4·THA (PDB 1MMK) crystal structures. Computational Structural Analysis—The low frequency normal modes of CpPAH (molecules A and B), CvPAH (PDB 1LTV) and hPAH (PDB 1PAH), which provide information on regions with slow motions, were computed and analyzed by normal mode analysis (NMA) using the web server WebNM (34Hollup S.M. Salensminde G. Reuter N. BMC Bioinformatics. 2005; 6: 52Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The regional folding/unfolding conformational fluctuations and residue-specific stability constants were calculated using the COREX/BEST algorithm (35Hilser V.J. Methods Mol.

Calculations of the energies of charge-charge interactions were performed using a Tanford-Kirkwood model with the solvent accessibility correction of Gurd (at pH 7); other methodological details are given in Refs. 37Ibarra-Molero B.

Dielectric constants of 4.0 and 78.5 were used for the protein and the aqueous solvent, respectively. In this study, we calculated the energy of charge-charge interactions of group i with the rest of the ionizable groups in the protein 〈Wi 〉, which can be used to estimate the total charge-charge interaction energy in the proteins (〈Wq-q 〉), as shown in Equation 1.〈Wq-q〉=12∑i=1n〈Wi〉(Eq. 1) Expression of PAH in C. psychrerythraea 34H; Cloning, Expression, and Purification of CpPAH—C. psychrerythraea displayed a growth optimum around 9 °C when cultivated in Marine Broth at temperatures from 0 to 15 °C. Reverse transcriptase PCR confirmed that PAH was expressed in C. psychrerythraea cultivated under these conditions (Fig. 2A). Addition of l-Phe at concentrations of up to 30 mm added to the Marine Broth medium stimulated the growth. This is opposite to what is found for E. coli and other bacteria that do not possess PAH (39Polen T. Kramer M. Bongaerts J. Wubbolts M. Wendisch V.F. J. Biotechnol. 2005; 115: 221-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) where l-Phe in high amounts appears to be toxic. Nevertheless, C. psychrerythraea 34H did not grow in minimal medium (M9), and the addition of l-Phe (up to 50 mm) to this medium did not stimulate growth. After cloning the CpPAH gene into the vector pET-30a, the enzyme was successfully expressed in E. coli, and purified by chromatography on TALON® resin and consequent size-exclusion chromatography. CpPAH showed apparent molecular masses of 31 and 28 kDa by SDS-PAGE and analytic gel filtration chromatography, respectively (Fig. 2B and data not shown). The enzyme, with estimated molecular weight from the amino acid sequence of 30.71 kDa (31.77 kDa when the His tag is included), thus appears to be monomeric. Catalytic Properties of CpPAH—The enzyme activity is stimulated (40–70% depending on assay conditions and temperature) by the addition of 100 μm Fe(II) added as ferrous ammonium sulfate. This stimulation by iron is also found in other non-heme iron-dependent aromatic amino acid hydroxylases (40Fitzpatrick P.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14083-14091Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), including bacterial CvPAH (12Chen D. Frey P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25594-25601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 41Volner A. Zoidakis J. Abu-Omar M.M. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2003; 8: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and is probably because of the stabilization of the iron-bound holoenzyme during catalysis. 100 μm ferrous iron was thus routinely included in the activity assays. The nature of the cofactor for the bacterial PAHs is unclear. For eukaryote forms of the aromatic amino acid hydroxylases, it has been shown that 6(R)-BH4 (BH4) is the natural cofactor (42Werner-Felmayer G. Golderer G. Werner E.R. Curr. Drug Metab. 2002; 3: 159-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). C. psychrerythraea and other bacteria that contain the PAH gene also include enzymes supporting BH4 synthesis and recycling, but it was interesting to investigate the capacity of other cofactors to sustain CpPAH activity. We selected the following: (i) synthetic 6,7-dimethyl-tetrahydropterin (DMPH4), which elicits high activity in CvPAH (41"

In Escherichia coli, PtdGro is degraded to DAG by the transfer of the sn-glycerol-1-P head group to membrane-derived oligosaccharides (1Schulman H. Kennedy E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4250-4255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Goldberg D.E. Rumley M.K. Kennedy E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5513-5517Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These periplasmic oligosaccharides function in osmotic homeostasis (3Kennedy E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1092-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and PtdGro is used as a substrate in their biosynthesis in the periplasmic space. The DAG formed is converted to PtdOH for the resynthesis of PtdGro by DgkA (4Raetz C.R.H. Newman K.F. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 137: 860-868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DgkA is an inner membrane lipid kinase that exists as a trimer with each monomer containing three membrane-spanning domains (5Smith R.L. O'Toole J.F. Maguire M.E. Sanders II, C.R. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5459-5465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Oxenoid K. Sonnichsen F.D. Sanders C.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12876-12882Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The physiological substrate for DgkA is DAG, but the enzyme also less efficiently phosphorylates related lipids, like ceramide, that are not found in the bacterium (7Schneider E.G. Kennedy E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3739-3741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Schneider E.G. Kennedy E.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 441: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The dgkA mutants are viable under growth conditions that do not osmotically stress the bacteria and where membrane-derived oligosaccharide production is minimal (9Rumley M.K. Therisod H. Weissborn A.C. Kennedy E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11806-11810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lacroix J.M. Loubens I. Tempete M. Menichi B. Bohin J.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1745-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, dgkA is an essential gene in cells growing in an osmotically challenging environment, and lethality is induced in dgkA mutants by including arbutin in the medium, which acts as an artificial sugar acceptor of glycerol-P groups from PtdGro (11Jackson B.J. Bohin J.P. Kennedy E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 976-981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Fiedler W. Rotering H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4799-4806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inactivation of DgkA interrupts the diacylglycerol cycle, leading to the accumulation of neutral lipid, primarily DAG (13Raetz C.R.H. Newman K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3882-3887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Bielawska A. Perry D.K. Hannun Y.A. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 298: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). DgkA is the founding member of a large family of proteins that constitute the widely distributed prokaryotic type of DagK (Pfam01219). This family of integral membrane proteins contrasts with the mammalian DagK superfamily consisting of soluble lipid kinases that transiently associate with the membrane and function in regulating intracellular phospholipid signaling (15Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11447-11450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The catalytic cores of these proteins define a distinct family of soluble lipid kinases (Pfam00781) that includes some bacterial proteins of unknown function.It has been recognized for some time that the sn-glycerol-1-P polymer that adorn most Gram-positive LTAs arise from PtdGro (Fig. 1). LTAs are polydisperse macroamphiphiles composed of poly(sn-glycerol-1-P) attached to a glycolipid anchor and contribute to the continuum of anionic charge that forms a protective layer surrounding the bacterium (for a review, see Ref. 16Neuhaus F.C. Baddiley J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 686-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). The length of the polyglycerol-P chain varies from 14 to 33 repeating units, and in the prototypical Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis, the repeating units are attached to diglucosyldiacylglycerol. The gene product that catalyzes the polymerization step is unknown. Metabolic labeling experiments identify PtdGro as the source of the glycerol-1-P groups (17Koch H.U. Haas R. Fischer W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 138: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 18Cabacungan E. Pieringer R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 147: 75-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Taron D.J. Childs III, W.C.

Acta. 1984; 793: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), which means that the biosynthesis of a single LTA molecule requires the utilization of an average of 25 PtdGro molecules. Accordingly, PtdGro turnover is rapid in these bacteria (17Koch H.U. Haas R. Fischer W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 138: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 19Taron D.J. Childs III, W.C. Neuhaus F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 1110-1116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the large amount of DAG formed requires a DagK for its efficient reintroduction into the phospholipid biosynthetic pathway (Fig. 1). Because B. subtilis has a homolog of the E. coli dgkA gene, it has been assumed that the product of this gene is the DagK that carries out this function; however, dgkA is not an essential gene in B. subtilis (21Kobayashi K.

A. 2003; 100: 4678-4683Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). In light of the high demand for PtdGro in LTA biosynthesis, the finding that dgkA was dispensable was somewhat surprising and stimulated our investigation of phospholipid turnover in B. subtilis. This work shows that the B. subtilis dgkA gene does not encode a DagK but rather is an undecaprenol kinase (UdpK). The authentic DagK is identified as the product of the essential yerQ (dgkB) gene that encodes a soluble DagK belonging to the eukaryotic DagK protein superfamily (Pfam00781). DgkB is directly tied to the recycling of DAG in vivo (Fig. 1) based on the analysis of lipid metabolism and LTA formation in a conditional dgkB (yerQ) knock-out strain.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Sources of supplies were as follows: phospholipids, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol, 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol, N-acetoyl-d-erythro-sphingosine, N-palmitoyl-d-erythro-sphingosine, d-erythro-sphingosine, ceramide (brain), and ceramide (egg) (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc.); l-3-phosphatidylinositol (porcine liver) (Doosan Serdary Research Laboratories); undecaprenol, 1,2-[14C]dipalmitoylphosphatidic acid, and [γ-32P]ATP (American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc.); [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham Biosciences); 1-oleoyl-rac-glycerol (Sigma); anti-His antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene); and restriction enzymes (Promega). LB medium consisted of 10 g of tryptone, 5 g of yeast extract, and 10 g of NaCl per liter. All other chemicals were of reagent grade or better.Construction of the Conditional Knock-out yerQ Mutant—The integrative plasmid pMUTIN4 (22Vagner V. Dervyn E. Ehrlich S.D. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 3097-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) containing the IPTG-inducible Pspac promoter was used for conditional expression of yerQ in B. subtilis. Plasmid pGES434 (Fig. 2) was constructed using a 393-bp DNA fragment, generated by PCR using primers YerQMutUp (5′-CATAATTAAAGCTTGTTAGTGTAAAAATGGATC; HindIII site underlined) and YerQMutLow (5′-ATGACAGGATCCGCCGCTTTTAAAATATC; BamHI site underlined), carrying the ribosome binding site and a 5′ portion of yerQ. The amplified product was digested with HindIII and BamHI and cloned into pMUTIN4 previously digested with the same restriction enzymes. Strain GS435 was generated by integration of the circular form of plasmid pGES434 into the B. subtilis chromosome by a single crossover event (Fig. 2). This approach resulted in conditional inactivation of the target gene whose expression was controlled by the Pspac promoter via IPTG supplementation of the medium (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Construction and structure of the B. subtilis conditional yerQ (dgkB) knock-out strain. A, the essential yerQ gene was placed under control of the Pspac promoter as outlined under “Experimental Procedures,” and the structure of the chromosomal DNA in strain GS435 is diagramed. B, B. subtilis strain GS435 dgkB conditional knock-out was grown in liquid medium supplemented with (•) or without (○) IPTG, resulting in either a normal growth pattern (•) or growth arrest (○) when the cellular level of DkgB became limiting. The arrow indicates the point in cell growth where the metabolic labeling experiments were performed (see Fig. 5). The growth characteristics of strain GS435 were very reproducible. The error bars were smaller than the symbols on the graph.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Construction of Expression Plasmids—The following strains were used to obtain genomic DNA: E. coli, DH1; B. subtilis, P31K6; Staphylococcus aureus, RN4220; Streptococcus pneumoniae, T4. The E. coli and B. subtilis dgkA genes were amplified by PCR using forward primers that contained coding sequence for six histidines at the NH2 terminus and an NcoI site at the initiating codon and the reverse primers with a BamHI site downstream of the stop codon. The S. aureus SAR1989 and SAR780 genes were amplified by PCR using primer pairs containing an XhoI site upstream of the initiating codon and a BamHI site after the stop codon to create an amino-terminal His-tagged protein. Primers for the amplification of B. subtilis yerQ, bmrU, ytlR, and SP1045 included an NcoI site at the initiating codon and a coding sequence for six histidines at the carboxyl terminal codon followed by a BamHI site downstream of the engineered stop codon. The inserts were then transferred to either pET15b (Novagen) or pPJ131, a plasmid that was derived from pBluescript II KS+ by deleting its XhoI site, followed by inserting the XbaI-BamHI fragment of pET15b into the multiple cloning site. In plasmids pAJ001–pAJ006 and pAJ011, the G nucleotide directly downstream of the ATG (part of the NcoI site) was mutated using QuikChange (Stratagene) to a nucleotide that corresponded to the gene sequence. The sequences were verified by the Hartwell Center for Bioinformatics and Biotechnology at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Plasmid pAJ018 was constructed using PCR to amplify the nucleotide sequence in pAJ001 including the ribosomal binding site and tagged E. coli dgkA. The forward primer contained a BamHI site, and the reverse primer contained an XbaI site downstream of the stop codon, and the product was ligated into the B. subtilis expression vector pHCMC02 (23Nguyen H.D.

Plasmid. 2005; 54: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).Complementation Experiments—Electrocompetent cells of strains FB21625 or GS435 were transformed with the indicated plasmids, and the transformants were recovered on LB plates supplemented with 100 μg/ml carbenicillin or LB plates supplemented with 100 μg/ml carbenicillin, 0.5 μg/ml erythromycin, 12.5 μg/ml lincomycin, and 250 μm IPTG. Individual clones were isolated and streaked on LB plates either with or without 90 mm arbutin to test for complementation of the E. coli dgkA mutant phenotype (11Jackson B.J. Bohin J.P. Kennedy E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 976-981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternately, the cells were streaked on LB plates supplemented with 100 μg/ml carbenicillin, 0.5 μg/ml erythromycin, and 12.5 μg/ml lincomycin either in the presence or absence of IPTG to test for complementation of the B. subtilis dgkB growth phenotype.DagK Assays—The DagK assay was modeled after the assay developed by Walsh and Bell (24Walsh J.P. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6239-6247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assays contained 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm LiCl, 5 mm [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity = 0.02 Ci/mmol), and 4 mol % (1 mm) in the micelle phase of 50 mm octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (critical micellar concentration = 25 mm) in a final volume of 100 μl. The reactions were initiated by the addition of protein and incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. Reactions were quenched by the addition of 700 μl of chloroform/methanol/HCl (1:2:0.03, v/v/v), and the lipids were extracted after adding 350 μl of water and 100 μl of chloroform (100 μl). Both long- and short-chain PtdOH were efficiently extracted by this method. Radioactivity in the organic layer was quantified by a liquid scintillation counter, and the lipids were separated by thin layer chromatography on Silica Gel H layers developed with chloroform, methanol, water, ammonium hydroxide, 250 mm EDTA (45:35:8.4:1.5:0.16, v/v/v/v/v).Purification of B. subtilis DgkB—The E. coli Rosetta strain (Novagen) harboring the His-tagged B. subtilis DgkB expression plasmid pAJ011 was grown in LB medium, supplemented with 100 μg/ml carbenicillin and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol, at 37 °C with rotary shaking until the A600 reached 0.8. Then 400 μm IPTG was added to induce expression of B. subtilis DgkB, and rotary shaking of the culture was continued at 25 °C for 16 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (6000 × g for 15 min), resuspended in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm imidazole, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Bacterial lysis was achieved by a lysozyme (1 mg/ml) digest for 10 min at 4 °C followed by one freeze-thaw cycle of cells in the presence of 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100. The viscosity of the cell-free extract was reduced by the addition of 0.2 mg of DNase along with 2 mm CaCl2 and 2 mm MgCl2. After the insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation (20,000 × g for 40 min), the extract was loaded onto an Ni2+-NTA affinity column (Qiagen). The resin was washed with 10 column volumes of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm imidazole, and 10% (v/v) glycerol, followed by 10 column volumes of the same buffer containing 50 mm imidazole. B. subtilis DgkB was eluted from the column in the same buffer containing 500 mm imidazole. The protein was concentrated to 3.0 mg/ml using a centrifugal filter device (Amicon) and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Protein purity was assessed by SDS gel electrophoresis. Aliquots (150 μl) were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. Protein was measured by the Bradford method (25Noto T. Miyakawa S. Oishi H. Endo H. Okazaki H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1982; 35: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).Preparation of Extracts Containing DgkA—Strain FB21625 (dgkA::Tn5) harboring plasmids pAJ001 (E. coli DgkA), pAJ002 (B. subtilis DgkA), or pPJ131 (control) were grown overnight in 5 ml of LB medium supplemented with 100 μl of carbenicillin. The cells were harvested and resuspended in 0.5 ml of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm imidazole, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cells were lysed with lysozyme (1 mg/ml for 10 min at 4 °C), followed by freeze-thawing the samples in the presence of 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 20 min.Radiolabeling of Lipids and LTA—Strain GS435 was grown in LB medium (5 ml), supplemented with 0.5 μg/ml erythromycin and 12.5 μg/ml lincomycin and 250 μm IPTG, at 37 °C with rotary shaking. At A600 = 0.4, two aliquots of 80 μl of culture were filtered on a 0.45-μm membrane filter (Millipore), and after two rinses with 3 ml of medium, the filter disks were transferred to 5 ml of LB medium supplemented with the above antibiotics either with or without IPTG. Cell growth was monitored, and at the time indicated in the figures, cells were labeled either with 0.5 mCi of [1-14C]acetate (55 mCi/mmol) for 10 min or 2 mCi of [γ-32P]orthophosphate (6000 Ci/mmol) for 30 min. Cells were filtered and resuspended in nonradioactive medium, followed by removal of 0.5-ml aliquots periodically. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, the lipids were extracted, and the total radioactivity incorporated was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Diacylglycerol and polar lipids were separated on Silica Gel G layers with hexane/ether/acetic acid (80: 20:1), and the radioactive content of the bands was determined by scraping and scintillation counting. Orthophosphate-labeled phospholipids were separated on Silica Gel H layer using a mixture of chloroform, methanol, water, ammonium hydroxide, 250 mm EDTA (45:35:8.4:1.5:0.16, v/v/v/v/v), and activities in each phospholipid fraction were quantified using the Typhoon 9600 PhosphorImager. All results were normalized to 0.5-ml samples of radiolabeled culture. LTA was extracted from 5 ml of culture after labeling cells for 30 min with [32P]orthophosphate and purified on octyl-Sepharose column (Vc = 1 ml) using an isopropyl alcohol gradient between 5 and 80% (v/v) and collecting 3-ml fractions (26Behr T.

B. subtilis DgkA is clearly related to E. coli DgkA, which is a bona fide DagK. B. subtilis DgkA has three predicted transmembrane helices and regions corresponding to the two signature sequence motifs shared by members of the Gram-negative group of DgkAs and the Pfam01219 protein family (Fig. 3). These motifs (VEΦLNSAIEXVVDR and HXLSXXAKDMGSAA) are located in the second cytoplasmic loop and extend into the third transmembrane domain (Fig. 3A). Therefore, we tested the activity of B. subtilis DgkA using a genetic complementation strategy based on the sensitivity of E. coli strain FB21625 (dgkA::Tn5) to arbutin. Although E. coli DgkA complemented the arbutin-sensitive growth phenotype of strain FB21625, expression of B. subtilis DgkA did not (Table 1). The DagK constructs were His-tagged, and protein expression was verified by Western blotting using anti-His antibody (not shown). These data indicated that B. subtilis DgkA was not a DagK.FIGURE 3DgkA and DgkB Sequence alignments. A, alignment of four representative Gram-negative and Gram-positive members of the prokaryotic diacylglycerol kinase (DgkA) superfamily, Pfam01219. Residues that are common to three of four Gram-negative DgkA sequences are highlighted in both groups of proteins, and the position of the aligned sequences in the structure of E. coli DgkA are shown diagrammatically above the alignments. The EΦLNSAIEAVVD sequence defines the proteins as members of Pfam01219. B, alignment of six prokaryotic members of the soluble DagK superfamily, Pfam00781. The proteins are separated into two groups, with three examples of DgkBs (two are experimentally known to have DagK activity) and three other family members that are experimentally known not to have DagK activity. The top alignment shows the similarities between these proteins that group them in Pfam00781 (GGDGTΦNEVVXG) and probably defines the ATP binding site. The lower group of sequences shows the alignment of a conserved sequence in the DgkBs (KGXEΦLPYD) that is not found in the prokaryotic family members that lack DagK activity.

Open table in a new tab A bioinformatic analysis of the B. subtilis genome revealed three genes (yerQ, bmrU, and ytlR) that belonged to the soluble DagK protein family, Pfam00781 (Fig. 3B). Although the overall sequence identity among the family members is low, the group is defined by the presence of the common GGDGTΦNEVVXG motif that may represent a shared ATP binding sequence. Therefore, we tested each of these genes in the complementation assay and found that only yerQ complemented the arbutin-sensitive growth phenotype of strain FB21625 (Table 1). These data indicated that yerQ encoded a DagK; therefore, we have renamed the gene dgkB to indicate this fact. We also tested a few other Gram-positive members of Pfam00781. Of these, SAR1989 of S. aureus complemented the dgkA mutant, indicating that it was also a dgkB gene. However, the other Pfam00781 member in S. aureus (SAR0780), the two other members in B. subtilis (BmrU and YtlR), and the only member of this family in S. pneumoniae (SPR1045) did not complement the dgkA mutant phenotype (Table 1). All of these proteins were expressed in strain FB21625, based on a Western blot with anti-His antibody. The His-tagged BmrU, YtlR, SP1045, and SAR0780 proteins were purified through the affinity chromatography step. Each was recovered as a soluble protein, and none of these purified proteins exhibited any DagK activity in vitro (not shown). These genetic and biochemical studies lead us to conclude that of none of these proteins function as DagKs.The dgkB gene was flagged as an essential gene based on a systematic genome-wide inactivation of B. subtilis genes (21Kobayashi K.

Strain GS435 was able to grow in the presence of IPTG but did not form colonies on plates that lacked the inducer, confirming the essential nature of the dgkB gene (Table 1). Unlike temperature-sensitive mutants, the removal of inducer in liquid cultures did not result in the immediate inactivation of the protein or cessation of cell proliferation, but rather cell growth continued until the preexisting protein was diluted out by subsequent cell divisions as illustrated by the growth curves shown in Fig. 2B. There were three phases to cell growth in the absence of inducer. First, a log phase that was nearly identical to the IPTG-supplemented culture representing the period of time when DgkB was present in sufficient quantities to permit normal growth. Second, there was a transition phase where the cell culture continued to increase in density but at a rate continually slower than that of wild type. This phase was when the cellular content of DgkB was becoming limiting for growth. Third, there is a final plateau phase, where the cells ceased proliferation. E."
https://openalex.org/W2025153605,"Heme-regulated phosphodiesterase from Escherichia coli (Ec DOS) is a gas-sensor enzyme that hydrolyzes cyclic dinucleotide-GMP, and it is activated by O2 or CO binding to the Fe(II) heme. In contrast to other well known heme-regulated gas-sensor enzymes or proteins, Ec DOS is not specific for a single gas ligand. Because Arg97 in the heme distal side in Ec DOS interacts with the O2 molecule and Met95 serves as the axial ligand on the distal side of the Fe(II) heme-bound PAS domain of Ec DOS, we explored the effect of mutating these residues on the activity and gas specificity of Ec DOS. We found that R97A, R97I, and R97E mutations do not significantly affect regulation of the phosphodiesterase activities of the Fe(II)-CO and Fe(II)-NO complexes. The phosphodiesterase activities of the Fe(II)-O2 complexes of the mutants could not be detected due to rapid autoxidation and/or low affinity for O2. In contrast, the activities even of the gas-free M95A and M95L mutants were similar to that of the gas-activated wild-type enzyme. Interestingly, the activity of the M95H mutant was partially activated by O2, CO, and NO. Spectroscopic analysis indicated that the Fe(II) heme is in the 5-coordinated high-spin state in the M95A and M95L mutants but that in the M95H mutant, like wild-type Ec DOS, it is in the 6-coordinated low-spin state. These results suggest that Met95 coordination to the Fe(II) heme is critical for locking the system and that global structural changes around Met95 caused by the binding of the external ligands or mutations at Met95 releases the catalytic lock and activates catalysis.

The GGDEF subdomain expresses diguanylate cyclase activity, and catalyzes the synthesis of one molecule of cyclic diGMP from two molecules of GTP via the linear intermediate diguanosine tetraphosphate. The GGDEF subdomain is ∼180 amino acids long and has a conserved amino acid sequence, GG(D/E)(D/E)F. The EAL subdomain has a phosphodiesterase activity that hydrolytically cleaves cyclic diGMP into l-diGMP and/or GMP, and is 260 residues in length, including the conserved amino acid sequence EAL. Metabolism of c-diGMP may be physiologically important because the genome of Escherichia coli K-12, for example, encodes 19 proteins with GGDEF subdomains and 17 with EAL subdomains. Heme-regulated phosphodiesterase from E. coli (Ec DOS) contains a heme-bound PAS domain in the N-terminal region and a phosphodiesterase domain with GGDEF and EAL subdomains in the C-terminal region (11Delgado-Nixon V.M. Gonzalez G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2685-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 12Chang A.L. Tuckerman J.R. Gonzalez G. Mayer R. Weinhouse H. Volman G. Amikam D. Benziman M. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3420-3426Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Although Ec DOS also contains a GGDEF subdomain, it does not appear to have guanylate cyclase activity. Thus, the precise roles of the GGDEF domain in the catalysis and structure of Ec DOS remain unclear. In contrast, the EAL domain in Ec DOS appears to contain the catalytic domain, so that this domain retains high phosphodiesterase activity that rapidly converts c-diGMP into linear dinucleotide GMP (l-diGMP) (3Méndez-Ortiz M.M. Hyodo M. Hayakawa Y. Membrillo-Hernández J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8090-8099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 4Schmidt A.J. Ryjenkov D.A. Gomelsky M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4774-4781Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Furthermore, E. coli with a knock-out of the Ec DOS gene display a morphology and growth rate different from those of the wild-type strain, suggesting that the enzyme is important for cell development and/or proliferation (13Yoshimura-Suzuki T. Sagami I. Yokota N. Kurokawa H. Shimizu T. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 6678-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In well known heme-bound gas-sensor proteins, binding of specific gases to the Fe(II) heme (for example, CO for CooA, NO for soluble guanylate cyclase, and O2 for FixL) causes a change in the heme environment that is transduced intramolecularly to the other domain to regulate the function (14Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Gonzalez G. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2005; 99: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Each of these heme-bound gas-sensor enzymes can recognize only a single physiologically relevant gas. We recently reported, however, that the phosphodiesterase activity of full-length, dithionite-reduced Ec DOS is up-regulated upon binding of either O2 or CO binding to the Fe(II) heme (15Takahashi H.

Although the amino acid sequence and overall structure of the heme-containing PAS domains of Ec DOS and FixL are similar, Ec DOS is activated by both O2 and CO, whereas FixL is down-regulated only by O2. Thus, Ec DOS appears to be a novel heme-bound gas-sensor enzyme with the unprecedented ability to recognize more than one type of gas molecule. To understand why, in contrast to other gas-sensor heme proteins, Ec DOS lacks strict gas selectivity, the roles of the residues around the heme in catalytic activation must be determined. O2 bound to the Fe(II) heme interacts directly with Arg97 on the heme distal side (Fig. 1A) (16Park H. Suquet C. Satterlee J.D. Kang C-H. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2738-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Thus, Arg97 appears to be important for recognizing different gas molecules. Met95 binds directly to the Fe(II) heme as the endogenous axial ligand (Fig. 1B) (17Kurokawa H. Lee D.S. Watanabe M. Sagami I. Mikami B. Raman C.S. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20186-20193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and the coordination of Met95 to the Fe(II) heme is cleaved by binding of the external axial ligands O2, CO, and NO. Thus, both Arg97 and Met95 may play important roles in the regulation of catalysis by gas binding. To explore the role of these two residues, we generated full-length Ec DOS with mutations at Arg97 and Met95, and examined their catalytic activities and activation by O2, CO, and NO. As in studies of SmFixL (18Akimoto S. Tanaka A. Nakamura K. Shiro Y. Nakamura H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), in the current experiments, we measured the catalytic activity in the presence of DTT rather than sodium dithionite to more accurately reflect the physiological conditions in vivo.Itwas found that mutation of Arg97 did not significantly affect the catalytic activation by gases, whereas the mutation of Met95 led to high enzyme activity even in the absence of gases as well an inability to be activated by gas binding. Our results imply that Met95 plays a critical role in the activation of c-diGMP hydrolysis upon gas binding by Ec DOS. Materials—All chemical reagents were of the highest grade available and were purchased from Wako Chemicals (Osaka, Japan) and used without further purification. Calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (CIAP) was obtained from Takara Bio (Otsu, Japan), c-diGMP was from BIOLOG (Bremen, Germany), 6-(2-hydroxy-1-methyl-2-nitrosohydrazine)-N-methyl-1-hexanamine (NOC9) was from DOJINDO (Kumamoto, Japan), and BIOMOL GREEN™ reagent was from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). The QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Oligonucleotides used for plasmid construction and for site-directed mutagenesis were obtained from Nippon Gene (Sendai, Japan). Construction of Expression Plasmid and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The cloning of Ec DOS and construction of the expression plasmid pET28a(+) were previously described (19Sasakura Y. Hirata S. Sugiyama S. Suzuki S. Taguchi S. Watanabe M. Matsui T. Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23821-23827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Mutants were generated as described in the supplementary materials. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Protein Overexpression and Purification—The wild-type and mutant Ec DOS proteins were overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) using the pET28a(+) expression plasmid, which contains an N-terminal His6 tag and a thrombin cleavage site. A single colony was put in 50 ml of Luria-Bertani (LB) medium containing 20 μg/ml kanamycin and 0.5% glucose and then shaken overnight at 200 rpm and 37 °C. The cultured medium was added to 1 liter of terrific broth (TB) medium containing 20 μg/ml kanamycin. Then, the medium was shaken for 4 h at 120 rpm and 37 °C. After the medium was cooled down to 20 °C, δ-aminolevulinic acid was added to 0.45 mm and incubated with shaking for another 20 h. The E. coli cells were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 5000 × g and 4 °C, and finally stored at -80 °C. The following protein purification procedures were performed on ice or at 4 °C. E. coli cells frozen at -80 °C were suspended in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 20 mm imidazole, 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (buffer A), and 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme. The solution was sonicated and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatants were applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column. The Ec DOS fractions were eluted with a linear gradient of 20–300 mm imidazole in buffer A. The solution containing Ec DOS was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) with 5% glycerol (buffer B), and then thrombin protease (Wako Chemicals, Osaka, Japan) (1 unit/mg of protein) was added to cleave the His tag. Subsequently, the sample solution was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column, and the His tag-free Ec DOS was eluted in the flow-through fractions using buffer B. The Ec DOS fractions were then applied to DEAE column, and Ec DOS was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in buffer B. After the proteins were dialyzed against buffer B, the purified Ec DOS was concentrated with Centriprep (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and Centrisalt I (Sartorius AG, Goettigen, Germany). The purified proteins were >95% homogenous as confirmed by SDS-PAGE. The sample was stored at -20 °C in the presence of 40% glycerol. Optical Absorption Spectroscopy—All spectral data were obtained using a UV-1600PC (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) spectrophotometer in a glove box that can maintain the oxygen concentration under 100 ppm (Hirasawa, Tokyo, Japan). The heme of Ec DOS proteins was reduced using either 10 mm DTT or small quantities of sodium dithionite in PDE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2) under anaerobic conditions. The Fe(II) heme, Fe(II) heme-O2, and Fe(II) heme-CO complexes were prepared in anoxic (10% H2 and 90% N2 gas), O2-saturated, or CO-saturated buffer, respectively. The gas-saturated buffer solutions were obtained by bubbling the buffer with the appropriate gas for at least 1 h. The Fe(II) heme-NO complexes were prepared by adding of 50 or 100 μm NOC9 to the solution of Fe(II) heme complex. Phosphodiesterase Assay—Ec DOS hydrolyzes c-diGMP to l-diGMP as demonstrated by reversed-phase liquid chromatography (supplementary materials Fig. 1S). On the other hand, in our phosphodiesterase assay, we used a colorimetric method, namely, l-diGMP that is converted to a guanylyl (3′,5′)guanosine by Ec DOS. CIAP reacts with only l-diGMP because CIAP lacks phosphodiesterase activity and thus reacts only with terminal phosphate groups. CIAP therefore converts l-diGMP to GpG (guanylyl (3′,5′)guanosine) and phosphate. One product, phosphate, was quantified by colorimetrically using BIOMOL GREEN reagent (Biomol). The change in absorbance at 630 nm (supplementary materials Fig. 2S, A) was measured with a Benchmark Microplate Reader™ (Bio-Rad) and used to determine phosphate concentration by comparison with a standard curve (supplementary materials Fig. 2S, B). All steps were performed in the globe box. Wild-type and mutant Ec DOS proteins were diluted in PDE buffer. The wild-type and Arg97 mutant enzymes were fully reduced to the Fe(II) form by adding 10 mm DTT. For the Met95 mutants, a trace amount of sodium dithionite was used to completely reduce the heme iron to the Fe(II) complex because DTT cannot reduce the heme iron in the Met95 mutant proteins. Subsequently, excess dithionite was removed by gel filtration on Superdex G-25. After complete reduction the Fe(II) form was confirmed by optical absorption spectroscopy, Fe(II)-CO and Fe(II)-O2 complexes were prepared by diluting the sample in gas-saturated PDE buffer containing 10 mm DTT. The Fe(II)-NO sample was prepared by adding 50 μm or 100 μm NOC9 to the sample of Fe(II) enzyme. The phosphodiesterase reaction was performed at 25 °C in a mixture with 71.4 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 71.4 mm NaCl, 7.14 mm MgCl2, 2.14 units/μl of CIAP, 14.3 mm DTT, and 0.29 μm Ec DOS and initiated by the addition of 0.3 volumes of 0.33 mm c-diGMP. After the desired time, the reaction was terminated by the addition of an equal volume of 1 m HCl. The solution was then centrifuged for 5 min at 15,000 × g to remove denatured proteins as precipitates. The supernatant (100 μl) was mixed with 200 μl of BIOMOL GREEN, and the mixture incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. The change in absorbance at 630 nm was measured as described above. The initial rates of the reactions are averages of at least three time course experiments. The experimental errors are shown in the l-diGMP hydrolysis time course data of Fig. 3, and also in Figs. 5S and 6S (supplementary materials). Note that the stick diagrams in Figs. 3B, 4, and supplemental materials Fig. 7 S do not have error bars because values were calculated from averaged data points.FIGURE 4Comparison of the catalytic activities of the Fe(II) (white), Fe(II)-O2 (hatched), Fe(II)-CO (gray), and Fe(II)-NO (black) complexes of the Arg97 (A) and Met95 (B) mutant enzymes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Optical Absorption Spectra of the Mutants—We first collected optical absorption spectra for the gas-free and gas-bound Fe(II) heme complexes of the R97A, R97I, and R97E mutants of full-length Ec DOS (Fig. 2). The absorption maxima of the mutant proteins are summarized in Table 1. The optical absorption spectra of these Arg97 mutants in the absence or presence of CO and NO were essentially the same as for the wild-type protein, suggesting that the coordination structure (6-coordinated low-spin form) and the heme environment were not substantially changed by the Arg97 mutations. The spectra of the Fe(II)-O2 complexes for the Arg97 mutants as measured with a conventional absorption spectrometer, however, could not be detected due to rapid autoxidation (>10 s-1) and/or a low affinity for O2 (data not shown). It is likely, therefore, that Arg97 is important for stabilizing the Fe(II)-O2 complex.TABLE 1Optical absorption spectral maxima (nm) of the Fe(II) complexes for the wild-type, Arg97 mutant, and Met95 mutant proteins in the absence and presence of O2, CO, and NO Coordination structures and spin states of the heme iron are shown in parentheses.EcDOSFe(II)Fe(II)-O2Fe(II)-COFe(II)-NOSoretβαSoretβαSoretβαSoretβαWT428532 (6cLS)a6cLS, 6-coordinate low-spin heme complex563417542 (6cLS)578424542 (6cLS)578421541 (6cLS)571R97A427532 (6cLS)563NDbND, not determined due to rapid autooxidation and/or low affinity for O2424541 (6cLS)570421541 (6cLS)579R97I427532 (6cLS)563ND424540 (6cLS)571421542 (6cLS)574R97E427532 (6cLS)563ND424541 (6cLS)572421541 (6cLS)576M95A434556 (5cHS)c5cHS, 5-coordinate high-spin heme complex416541 (6cLS)576424541 (6cLS)572421541 (6cLS)578M95L434559 (5cHS)417541 (6cLS)579424541 (6cLS)579421544 (6cLS)579M95H429531 (6cLS)562417541 (6cLS)579424541 (6cLS)571421541 (6cLS)578a 6cLS, 6-coordinate low-spin heme complexb ND, not determined due to rapid autooxidation and/or low affinity for O2c 5cHS, 5-coordinate high-spin heme complex Open table in a new tab Optical absorption spectra of the Met95 mutants of the full-length enzyme for the gas-free and gas-bound Fe(II) heme complexes were essentially the same as those previously reported for the mutants of the isolated heme-bound PAS domain (20Taguchi S.

Note that both the M95A and M95L mutants were 5-coordinate high-spin complexes, whereas the M95H mutant was a 6-coordinate low-spin complex in which His must be an axial ligand. In the remaining experiments, we reduced the wild-type and Arg97 mutant enzymes to the Fe(II) heme state using DTT, whereas we reduced the Met95 mutant proteins with sodium dithionite. It was, therefore, examined whether there were differences in the optical absorption spectra of the Fe(II) heme complexes when the enzymes were reduced with DTT and sodium dithionite. We found that the spectra of the Fe(II) heme complexes were essentially the same, even if the heme iron was reduced by DTT or sodium dithionite, suggesting that the heme environment of the full-length enzyme is not influenced by the reducing agent. Phosphodiesterase Activity of the Wild-type Enzyme—Activities of other heme-bound oxygen-sensor enzymes, such as SmFixL, in the presence of DTT are much more sensitive to oxygen and appear to reflect the activity of the native enzyme under hypoxic conditions (18Akimoto S. Tanaka A. Nakamura K. Shiro Y. Nakamura H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the present study, therefore, we used 10 mm DTT to reduce the wild-type enzyme, and we measured the catalytic activity in the glove box to provide anoxic conditions. High pressure liquid chromatography (as shown in supplementary materials Fig. 1S) is used in general to measure phosphodiesterase cleavage of c-diGMP. However, this method is time consuming. In this report, we use colorimetric detection of products in the development of a rapid c-diGMP cleavage assay (“Experimental Procedures” and supplementary materials Fig. 2S). Fig. 3 shows the time course of l-diGMP generation by Fe(II), Fe(II)-O2, Fe(II)-CO, and Fe(II)-NO complexes of wild-type Ec DOS in the presence of 10 mm DTT. The initial velocities are compared in Fig. 3B and are summarized in Table 2. The binding of O2, CO, or NO to the heme enhanced the activity 6–7-fold. The finding that even NO binding markedly enhanced the catalytic activity was surprising because other heme gas-sensor proteins such as FixL, CooA, and soluble guanylate cyclase strictly distinguish O2, CO, and NO, respectively (14Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Gonzalez G. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2005; 99: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). This emphasizes that Ec DOS is a novel gas-sensor enzyme that has the unprecedented ability to be activated by all three of these gases.TABLE 2Phosphodiesterase activities (nmol l-diGMP/nmol of Ec DOS) of the Fe(II) complexes of the wild-type, Arg97 mutant, and Met95 mutant enzymes in the absence and presence of O2, CO, and NO Numbers in the parentheses indicate the -fold increase in the activity compared with that of the gas-free wild-type enzyme.Ec DOSActivitiesaNamomole of l-diGMP/nmol of Ec DOS-Fold activationbFold increase in the activity of the gas-bound forms compared with that of the gas-free formFe(II)Fe(II)-O2Fe(II)-COFe(II)-NOWT9.7 (1.0)61 (6.3)70 (7.2)68 (7.0)6.3-7.2R97A5.6 (0.58)NDcND, not determined due to rapid autoxidation and/or low affinity for O268 (7.0)65 (6.7)12R97I8.2 (0.85)ND87 (9.0)87 (9.0)11R97E5.3 (0.55)ND37 (3.8)48 (4.9)7.0-9.1M95A69 (7.1)74 (7.6)78 (8.0)85 (8.8)1.1-1.2M95L79 (8.1)90 (9.3)96 (9.9)82 (8.5)1.0-1.2M95H23 (2.4)52 (5.4)82 (8.5)72 (7.4)2.3-3.5a Namomole of l-diGMP/nmol of Ec DOSb Fold increase in the activity of the gas-bound forms compared with that of the gas-free formc ND, not determined due to rapid autoxidation and/or low affinity for O2 Open table in a new tab Effects of Arg97 Mutations on the Phosphodiesterase Activity—The optical absorption spectra of the Arg97 mutants in the absence or presence of CO and NO were similar to those of the wild-type enzyme (Table 1), suggesting that the heme environments of the mutants and wild-type enzyme are essentially the same. Therefore, we examined the activities of the mutant enzymes in the presence of CO or NO. It was found that CO and NO binding markedly enhanced (6.5–13-fold) the catalytic activity of the three Arg97 mutants, although in the absence of these gases, the activities of the R97A and R97E mutants were lower than that of the wild-type enzyme (Table 2 and supplementary materials Fig. 1S). Because the autoxidation of the O2-bound Arg97 mutant proteins was very rapid (>10 s-1) and/or the affinities of the Fe(II) heme complexes for O2 were low, we could not measure the catalytic activity of the O2-bound Arg97 mutant enzymes. Effects of Met95 Mutations on the Phosphodiesterase Activity—Addition of up to 100 mm DTT was not sufficient to fully reduce the Met95 mutants due to the relatively low redox potential of the heme iron in the mutant proteins. This was also observed for the same mutants of the isolated PAS domain (21Hirata S. Matsui T. Sasakura Y. Sugiyama S. Yoshimura T. Sagami I. Shimizu T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4771-4779Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used a trace amount of sodium dithionite to completely reduce the heme to the Fe(II) complex. After removing excess sodium dithionite by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25, we measured the catalytic activities of the Met95 mutant proteins in the same buffer containing 10 mm DTT. Interestingly, the gas-free M95A and M95L mutants showed high activities without gas binding; specifically, the activities of these two mutants were 7–8-fold higher than that of the gas-free wild-type enzyme (Table 1 and supplementary materials Fig. 2S). The activities of the gas-bound bound forms of the mutants were almost as high as the gas-free forms (Table 2). In other words, the catalytic activities of the mutant enzymes were not enhanced by gas binding. In contrast, the activity of the gas-free M95H mutant was 2-fold higher than that of the wild-type enzyme, and the gas molecules enhanced its activity 2–3-fold. The PAS fold is characterized by several α-helices flanking a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet scaffold (17Kurokawa H. Lee D.S. Watanabe M. Sagami I. Mikami B. Raman C.S. Shimizu T. J. Biol.

Here we found that NFBD1 protects cells from apoptotic cell death by inhibiting phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15 under steady state as well as early phase of DNA damage, thereby blocking its transcriptional and pro-apoptotic activities. During late phase of DNA damage, a remarkable reduction of NFBD1 was observed in dying but not in surviving A549 cells bearing wild-type p53. Small interference RNA-mediated knockdown of the endogenous NFBD1 resulted in an increase in sensitivity to adriamycin in A549 cells but not in p53-deficient H1299 cells. Immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter analyses demonstrated that NFBD1 binds to the NH2-terminal region of p53 and strongly inhibits its transcriptional activity. Additionally, BRCT domains, which can interact with p53, reduced the adriamycin-induced phosphorylation levels of p53 at Ser-15 and also suppressed the transcriptional activity of p53. Thus, our present findings strongly suggest that NFBD1 plays an important role in the decision of cell survival and death after DNA damage through the regulation of p53.

Although the functional role of the BRCT domain is currently unclear, the early works indicated that the BRCT domains of BRCA1 act as a transactivator (4Chapman M.S. Verma I.M.

Consistent with this notion, the point mutations detected within the BRCT domains of BRCA1 markedly inhibited its transcriptional activity (4Chapman M.S. Verma I.M.

Alternatively, the BRCT domains function as protein-protein interaction modules (7Bork P. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For example, the BRCT domains of BRCA1 as well as 53BP1 were required for the interaction with p53 (8Iwabuchi K. Bartel P.L. Li B. Marraccino R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

NFBD1/MDC1 (nuclear factor with BRCT domain 1/mediator of DNA damage checkpoint protein 1) is a large nuclear protein bearing three characteristic structural domains, including an NH2-terminal forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, an internal PST (proline/serine/threonine-rich) repeat domain, and tandem repeat of COOH-terminal BRCT domains (10Nagase T.

We have initially reported that NFBD1 acts as a nuclear transcriptional factor with an anti-apoptotic function (11Ozaki T. Nagase T. Ichimiya S. Seki N. Ohira M. Nomura N. Takada N. Sakiyama S. Weber B.L. Nakagawara A. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In accordance with our results, siRNA-mediated knockdown of NFBD1 led to a significant increase in the number of apoptotic cells (15Xu X. Stern D.F. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1842-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In addition, the elimination of NFBD1 expression increased the sensitivity to irradiation (16Peng A. Chen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8873-8876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that NFBD1 has an anti-apoptotic function; however, the precise molecular mechanisms behind the anti-apoptotic effect of NFBD1 remain to be explored. Previous studies strongly suggest that NFBD1 is closely involved in early cellular responses to genotoxic stress. Upon DNA damage, NFBD1 was phosphorylated in an ATM/Chk2-dependent manner and cooperated with γH2AX to recruit DNA repair proteins to the sites of DNA damage (12Goldberg M. Stucki M. Falck J.

Consistent with this notion, NFBD1 was associated with the DNA double strand break repair MRN complex, including MRE11, RAD50, and NBS1, and also co-localized with the MRN complex as well as γH2AX at the nuclear foci in response to DNA damage (12Goldberg M.

Deletion analysis revealed that the FHA and BRCT domains of NFBD1 are required for the binding to the MRN complex and γH2AX, respectively (15Xu X. Stern D.F.

Furthermore, siRNA-mediated knockdown of NFBD1 led to a significant decrease in the number of irradiation-induced NBS1 foci (14Stewart G.S. Wang B. Bignell C.R. Taylor A.M.R. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2003; 421: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar), and the FHA and BRCT domains of NFBD1 were responsible for the formation of irradiation-induced nuclear foci containing NFBD1 (12Goldberg M.

In response to a wide variety of cellular stresses, including genotoxic stress, p53 is phosphorylated, and its halflife is dramatically prolonged. During the DNA damage-induced apoptosis, p53 is directly phosphorylated at Ser-15 and Ser-20 by ATM and Chk2, respectively (19Shieh S.Y. Ahn J. Tamai K. Taya Y. Prives C.

Such phosphorylation events contribute to the increased stability and activity of p53 by facilitating its dissociation from E3 ubiquitin protein ligase MDM2 (reviewed in Ref. 24Vousden K.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1602: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that NFBD1 abrogates the adriamycin (ADR)-mediated apoptosis through the inhibition of the transcriptional as well as pro-apoptotic activity of p53. Our present findings strongly suggest that NFBD1 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cell survival and death after DNA damage. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS7 and HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and penicillin (100 IU/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml). A549 and H1299 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium with the same supplements. Where indicated, cells were treated with ADR. For transfection, COS7 cells were transfected with the indicated expression plasmids using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science), except for A549 and H1299 cells, for which Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) was used. Cell Survival Assay—Cell viability was determined by a modified 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) 2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. In brief, A549 cells were cultured overnight at 5 × 103 cells per well in a 96-well plate, and then exposed to ADR. At the indicated time periods after the treatment with ADR, 10 μl of MTT solution was added to each culture, and the mixture was maintained for another 3 h at 37 °C. The absorbance readings for each well were carried out at 570 nm using the microplate reader (model 450; Bio-Rad). Isolation of RNA and RT-PCR—Total RNA was prepared from A549 cells using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. A total of 1 μg of total RNA was used to generate cDNAs with random primers by SuperScript IIreverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR amplification was carried out under standard conditions with rTaq DNA polymerase (Takara, Ohtsu, Japan). The primer sets used in this study were designed based on the cDNA sequences corresponding to each of the genes by using Primer3 software (Whitehead Institute). The primer sequences were as follows: p21WAF1, 5′-ATGAAATTCACCCCCTTTCC-3′ (sense) and 5′CCCTAGGCTGTGCTCACTTC-3′ (antisense); p53, 5′-GTCCAGATGAAGCTCCCAGA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAAGGCCTCATTCAGCTCTC-3′ (antisense); NFBD1, 5′-AGCAACCCCAGTTGTCATTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGCGCTGCTGAGACTTCTTC-3′ (antisense); BAX, 5′-AGAGGATGATTGCCGCCGT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAACCACCCTGGTCTTGGAT-3′ (antisense); PUMA, 5′-CTGTGAATCCTGTGCTCTGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCCTCCCTCTTCCGAGATTT-3′ (antisense); NOXA, 5′-CTGGAAGTCGAGTGTGCTACT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCAGGTTCCTGAGCAGAAGAG-3′ (antisense); and GAPDH, 5′-ACCTGACCTGCCGTCTAGAA-3′ (sense) and 5′TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′ (antisense). PCR products were separated by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide. Antibody Production—The cDNA sequence encoding the NH2-terminal region of human NFBD1 (amino acid residues 1-150) was subcloned into the bacterial expression plasmid pGEX-4T-2 (Amersham Biosciences), expressed in Escherichia coli DH5α, and purified with a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column. The antiserum against NFBD1 was produced by immunizing rabbit with the above purified glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. Construction of the Deletion Mutants of NFBD1—NFBD1 cDNA fragment encoding NH2-terminal FHA domain (amino acid residues 2-141), central PST domain (amino acid residues 788-1645), or COOH-terminal BRCT domains (amino acid residues 1858-2068) was amplified by PCR with the following primers: 5′-GAATTCGAGGACACCCAGGCTATT-3′ and 5′-GAGCTCAGTCCTCTGTTTCCCGTC-3′ or 5′-CCGGAATTCGACCAACATCCAGAGAGC-3′ and 5′-TCGCCGGCGAGTGAGTTCTAGTCTCCG-3′ or 5′-GAATTCAGCCTCCGACGCACCAAA-3′ or 5′-GAGCTCAGTACCTACTGTAGTGGT-3′, respectively. PCR primers also included 5′-EcoRI and 3′-XhoI or 5′-EcoRI and 3′-NotI restriction sites (boldface and underlined) to aid cloning. PCR products were then inserted in-frame into the appropriate restriction sites of the pcDNA3-FLAG to give pcDNA3-FLAG-FHA, pcDNA3-FLAG-PST, and pcDNA3-FLAG-BRCT. RNA Interference—To construct an expression plasmid for siRNA against NFBD1, two DNA oligonucleotides were designed to produce 19-nucleotide siRNA. Oligonucleotides used are as follows: 5′-CCCCAGCTCGAGCCTTCCACTTCTTCAAGAGAGAAGTGGAAGGCTCGAGCTTTTTTGGAAAC-3′ and 5′-TCGAGTTTCCAAAAAAGCTCGAGCCTTCCACTTCTCTCTTGAAGAAGTGGAAGGCTCGAGCTGGGGAGCT-3′. These two oligonucleotides were mixed in equimolar amounts and annealed under the standard conditions. The annealed oligonucleotide was inserted into the SacI and XhoI restriction sites of pcDNA3 derivative in which the cytomegalovirus promoter was replaced with the H1 promoter. Generation of Stable A549 Cell Lines—To establish stable cell lines expressing siRNA against p53, A549 cells were stably transfected with pSUPER-p53 (OligoEngine, Seattle, WA) or with the backbone plasmid, and cultured in the presence of G418 (400 μg/ml). Two weeks after the selection in G418, drug-resistant clones were isolated and allowed to proliferate in medium containing G418. Immunoblotting—Protein lysates (50 μg) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and probed with anti-p53 (DO-1; Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA), anti-FLAG (M2; Sigma), anti-BAX (6A7; eBioscience, San Diego), anti-GFP (1E4; MBL, Nagoya, Japan), anti-p21WAF1 (H-164; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-actin (20-33; Sigma), anti-p53 (Ser-15) (16G8; Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), or with anti-PUMA (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) antibody, followed by an incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Protein-antibody complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation—Precleared whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with normal rabbit serum (NRS) or with the anti-NFBD1 antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were recovered using protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). After extensive washing with the lysis buffer, bound proteins were eluted out by boiling in SDS sample buffer and processed for immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. In Vitro Binding Assay—35S-Labeled FLAG-tagged FHA, PST, and BRCT domains were transcribed and translated in vitro using the TnT T7 QuickCoupled transcription/translation system (Promega, Madison, WI). For pulldown assay, cell lysates prepared from COS7 cells were incubated with the radiolabeled proteins for 2 h at 4 °C. After incubation, the reaction mixture was immunoprecipitated with anti-p53 antibody (DO-1) for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by an incubation with protein G-Sepharose beads. The immunoprecipitates were recovered by brief centrifugation, washed with the lysis buffer, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. After gel drying, radiolabeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Indirect Immunofluorescence—For immunofluorescence, fixation was in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilization was in 0.2% Triton X-100. Coverslips were with anti-p53 (DO-1), anti-p53 (Ser-15) (16G8) or with anti-NFBD1 antibody. Cells were imaged by confocal microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Apoptosis Assay—A549 cells were transiently co-transfected with the constant amount of the expression plasmid for green fluorescence protein (GFP) together with or without the NFBD1 expression plasmid or the expression plasmid for siRNA against NFBD1. Twenty four hours after transfection, cells were treated with ADR or left untreated and incubated for another 24 h. Transfected cells were identified by the presence of green fluorescence. To verify apoptosis, cell nuclei were stained with DAPI to reveal nuclear condensation and fragmentation. The number of GFP-positive cells with apoptotic nuclei was scored. Luciferase Reporter Assay—H1299 cells were transiently co-transfected with the indicated expression plasmids and reporter constructs. Forty eight hours post-transfection, whole cell lysates were prepared, and luciferase activity was assessed using a Promega dual luciferase assay system. The firefly luminescence signal was normalized based on the Renilla luminescence signal. The results were obtained from at least three sets of transfection and were presented as the mean ± S.D. Down-regulation of NFBD1 in Response to a Variety of Genotoxic Agents—To explore the role of NFBD1 during the DNA damage response, we examined the expression kinetics of NFBD1 in human lung carcinoma A549 cells exposed to a variety of genotoxic agents, including ADR, camptothecin (CPT-11), cisplatin (CDDP), or etoposide (VP-16). In addition to the genotoxic agents, we also investigated the effect of nongenotoxic agents such as nocodazole (NOC) and paclitaxel (PTX) on NFBD1. A549 cells were exposed to the indicated agents at the concentrations recommended by Saito et al. (25Saito S. Yamaguchi H. Higashimoto Y. Chao C. Xu Y. Fornace Jr., A. Appella E. Anderson W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37536-37544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). To examine the expression levels of NFBD1, we have generated a specific polyclonal antibody against the NH2-terminal region of human NFBD1 (amino acid residues 1-150). The specificity of this antibody was verified by immunoblotting (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1A, A549 cells treated with the indicated genotoxic agents underwent apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner as examined by MTT assay. Similar results were also obtained by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (data not shown). In contrast, the nongenotoxic agents had undetectable effect on the viability of A549 cells. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the ADR treatment results in an accumulation of p53 as well as a phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15, which is associated with a significant induction of one of the downstream effectors of p53, p21WAF1 (Fig. 1B). It is worth noting that NFBD1 is strongly reduced in response to ADR in a time-dependent manner. Similar results were also obtained in A549 cells exposed to CPT-11, CDDP, or VP-16. On the other hand, NFBD1 levels remained unchanged even at the later time points after the addition of NOX or PTX. Additionally, the treatment of A549 cells with these nongenotoxic agents had a marginal effect on the accumulation of p53 and p21WAF1 as compared with those of the genotoxic agents. Next, we performed RT-PCR using total RNA prepared from A549 cells exposed to 600 nm ADR for the indicated time periods. As shown in Fig. 1C, NFBD1 mRNA levels were dramatically decreased in a time-dependent manner, accompanied with an up-regulation of p21WAF1, BAX, PUMA, and NOXA. The expression levels of p53 mRNA remained constant in ADR-treated A549 cells. These results suggest that NFBD1 is regulated at mRNA level in response to ADR. Previously, it has been shown that NFBD1 associates with the members of the MRN complex, such as MRE11 and NBS1, and accumulates at nuclear foci in response to DNA damage (12Goldberg M. Stucki M. Falck J. D'Amours D. Rahman D. Pappin D. Jiri B. Jackson S.P. Nature. 2003; 421: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 14Stewart G.S. Wang B. Bignell C.R. Taylor A.M.R. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2003; 421: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, our immunofluorescence staining showed that NFBD1 co-localizes with NBS1 at nuclear foci within 1 h of exposing A549 cells to ADR, and NFBD1 nuclear foci are still present up to 24 h later (data not shown). ADR-mediated induction of p53 was undetectable after 1 h of treatment (Fig. 2A). Intriguingly, a significant nuclear accumulation as well as phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15 was observed in cells 24 h after the treatment with ADR, which was associated with a disappearance of NFBD1 (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, NFBD1-containing nuclear foci were clearly present in cells lacking p53 induction. Collectively, these observations strongly suggest that there exists an inverse relationship between the expression of NFBD1 and p53 in response to DNA damage. ADR-mediated Apoptosis in A549 Cells Is Regulated in a p53-dependent Manner—Because A549 cells carry wild-type p53 (25Saito S. Yamaguchi H. Higashimoto Y. Chao C. Xu Y. Fornace Jr., A. Appella E. Anderson W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37536-37544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), it is likely that the ADR-mediated apoptosis is regulated in a p53-dependent manner. To confirm this notion, we performed siRNA-mediated knockdown of p53. We transfected the empty plasmid or the expression plasmid for siRNA against p53 into A549 cells, and we established two control transfectants (C1 and C2) as well as two stable transfectants expressing siRNA for p53 (53R1 and 53R2) (Fig. 3A). We then performed MTT assay to examine a possible effect of p53 on the ADR-mediated apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 3B, 53R1 and 53R2 cells displayed a significant increase in cell viability as compared with the control transfectants and the parental A549 cells. Thus, it is likely that the ADR-mediated apoptosis in A549 cells is regulated at least in part in a p53-dependent manner. To examine the possible effect of NFBD1 on the ADR-mediated apoptosis, A549 cells were transiently transfected with the empty plasmid or with the expression plasmid for NFBD1. Twenty four hours after transfection, cells were treated with 600 nm ADR. At the indicated time periods after the addition of ADR, cell viability was measured by MTT assay. As shown in Fig. 3C, the enforced expression of NFBD1 caused a remarkable increase in cell viability as compared with that of cells transfected with the empty plasmid. We next determined the time course of p53 expression in A549 cells overexpressing NFBD1 in response to ADR. As shown in Fig. 3D, ADR-mediated accumulation as well as phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15 became detectable as early as 3 h of ADR exposure, and the levels of p53 were maintained up to 96 h in control cells. In addition, p53-dependent induction of p21WAF1 and PUMA was detected at 6 h after the ADR treatment, and their expression levels persisted thereafter. In contrast, a significant reduction in the amounts and phosphorylation levels of p53 was detected in NFBD1-overexpressing cells at 24 h after the addition of ADR (Fig. 3E). This down-regulation of p53 was associated with a decrease in the expression levels of p21WAF1 and PUMA. These results indicate that NFBD1 could inhibit the p53 phosphorylation at Ser-15, thereby reducing its transcriptional activity as well as stability. NFBD1 Inhibits the p53-mediated Transcriptional Activation—To examine whether NFBD1 could affect the p53-mediated transcriptional activation, p53-deficient H1299 cells were transiently co-transfected with a constant amount of the expression plasmid for p53, luciferase reporter construct driven by the p53-responsive element derived from p21WAF1, MDM2, or BAX promoter together with or without the increasing amounts of the NFBD1 expression plasmid, and luciferase activity was measured 48 h after transfection. As shown in Fig. 4, A-C, co-expression of p53 with NFBD1 resulted in a significant repression of the p53-mediated transcriptional activation. Consistent with the luciferase reporter assay, RT-PCR analysis revealed that NFBD1 inhibits the p53-mediated up-regulation of PUMA and BAX mRNA expression (Fig. 4D). To examine whether NFBD1 could affect the pro-apoptotic activity of p53, H1299 cells were transiently co-transfected with the indicated combinations of the expression plasmids, and their viability was measured by MTT assay. As shown in Fig. 4E, the enforced expression of p53 alone led to a decrease in cell viability as compared with that of cells transfected with the empty plasmid. As expected, p53-mediated decrease in cell viability was restored by co-expression with NFBD1. Effect of NFBD1 on the ADR-mediated Apoptosis—Next, we sought to examine the possible effect of the endogenous NFBD1 on the ADR-mediated apoptosis. To this end, we utilized an siRNA-mediated knockdown of NFBD1 in A549 cells as shown in Fig. 5A. Silencing of NFBD1 in A549 cells resulted in an increased sensitivity to ADR as compared with the control cells (Fig. 5B). To confirm the anti-apoptotic effect of NFBD1 in detail, A549 cells were transiently co-transfected with the constant amount of the GFP expression plasmid together with the empty plasmid, or with the expression plasmid for NFBD1 or siRNA against NFBD1. GFP served as an indicator for transfected cells. Twenty four hours after transfection, cells were treated with 600 nm ADR or left untreated and incubated for another 24 h. Cell nuclei were then stained with DAPI, and the number of GFP-positive cells with apoptotic nuclei was scored. The enforced expression of NFBD1 led to a decrease in the number of apoptotic cells in response to ADR as compared with that of the control cells (Fig. 5, C and D). As expected, siRNA-mediated knockdown of NFBD1 caused a significant increase in the number of apoptotic cells in response to ADR. In contrast to A549 cells, overexpression of NFBD1 and silencing of NFBD1 in p53-deficient H1299 cells had an undetectable effect on the ADR-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 5E). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that NFBD1 prevents the ADR-mediated apoptosis by modulating p53. Next, we examined the possible effect of the siRNA-mediated knockdown of the endogenous NFBD1 on the p53-mediated transcriptional activation. For this purpose, H1299 cells were transiently co-transfected with the constant amount of p53 expression plasmid together with or without the increasing amounts of the expression plasmid for siRNA against NFBD1. As shown in Fig. 6, A-C, siRNA-mediated knockdown of the endogenous NFBD1 in H1299 cells increased the p53-dependent luciferase activities driven from p21WAF1, MDM2, or BAX promoter. In addition, similar results were obtained in U2OS cells bearing wild-type p53 (supplemental Fig. 1). Furthermore, the down-regulation of the endogenous NFBD1 resulted in a significant increase in the phosphorylation levels of p53 at Ser-15 as well as the amount of p53 (Fig. 6D). Under our experimental conditions, the exogenously expressed p53 was phosphorylated in the absence of DNA-damaging agents. Similar observations were also described (26Rodicker F. Putzer B.M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2737-2741PubMed Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that NFBD1 inhibits the transcriptional as well as"

To examine specific interactions between T-type Ca2+ channel subtypes and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRS), the Cav3.1 (α1G), Cav3.2 (α1H), and Cav3.3 (α) T-type Ca2+1Ichannels were co-expressed with the M1 Gαq/11-coupled mAChR. Perforated patch recordings demonstrate that activation of M1 receptors has a strong inhibitory effect on Cav3.3 T-type Ca2+ currents but either no effect or a moderate stimulating effect on Cav3.1 and Cav3.2 peak current amplitudes. This differential modulation was observed for both rat and human T-type Ca2+ channel variants. The inhibition of Cav3.3 channels by M1 receptors is reversible, use-independent, and associated with a concomitant increase in inactivation kinetics. Loss-of-function experiments with genetically encoded antagonists of Gα and Gβγ proteins and gain-of-function experiments with genetically encoded Gα subtypes indicate that M1 receptor-mediated inhibition of Cav3.3 occurs through Gαq/11. This is supported by experiments showing that activation of the M3 and M5 Gαq/11-coupled mAChRs also causes inhibition of Cav3.3 currents, although Gαi-coupled mAChRs (M2 and M4) have no effect. Examining Cav3.1-Cav3.3 chimeric channels demonstrates that two distinct regions of the Cav3.3 channel are necessary and sufficient for complete M1 receptor-mediated channel inhibition and represent novel sites not previously implicated in T-type channel modulation.

Neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine have been shown to either attenuate or stimulate low threshold Ca2+ currents depending on the type of native cells examined, and sometimes multiple forms of modulation can be observed within the same cell type (25Castillo P.E.

In this regard, the description of the modulation of specific T-type Ca2+ channels in heterologous systems will provide insights crucial toward further investigations within native systems. This approach is also well suited for GPCR studies as most neurotransmitters activate multiple receptor subtypes in neurons.Within thalamic reticular, hippocampal pyramidal, and olfactory granule cells, there is evidence for the expression of both T-type Ca2+ channels and Gαq/11-coupled muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) (25Castillo P.E.

As both T-type Ca2+ currents and mAChRs have been independently shown to play important physiological roles within these cell types, their functional coupling could be relevant to a number of neuronal processes. Here we studied the modulatory effects of mAChRs on the three main subtypes of low threshold T-type Ca2+ channels expressed in the mammalian nervous system. We found the selective modulation of Cav3.3 Ca2+ channels by Gαq/11-coupled mAChRs and combined pharmacological, genetic, and chimeric channel approaches to examine the G-protein-mediated pathway and structural regions responsible for the distinct Cav3.3 signaling characteristics.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMolecular Biology—Human Cav3.1–Cav3.3 T-type Ca2+ channel α1 subunit chimeras were constructed as described in detail by Hamid et al. (37Hamid J. Peloquin J.B. Monteil A. Zamponi G.W. Neuroscience. 2006; 143: 717-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293H, Invitrogen) were grown in standard Dulbec-co’s modified Eagle’s medium (10% fetal bovine serum and 50 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin) to ∼80% confluence and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 95% atmosphere and 5% CO2. The generation of stable T-type cell lines (in HEK 293, tsa-201) expressing rat brain Cav3.1, Cav3.2, or Cav3.3 α1 subunits has been described previously (16Santi C.M. Cayabyab F.S. Sutton K.G. McRory J.E. Mezeyova J. Hamming K.S. Parker D. Stea A. Snutch T.P. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 396-403Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stable cell lines were transiently transfected with human muscarinic M1, M2, M3, M4, or M5 cDNAs (all in pcDNA3.1) using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). As a reporter for transfection, all transient transfections included co-transfection with either CD8 or pEGFP marker plasmids at a 1:0.25 molar ratio compared with receptor and/or channel plasmid DNA, unless otherwise indicated. Lipofectamine-mediated transfections used 1–1.25 μgof DNA/35-mm dish and 5 μl of Lipofectamine/dish. In G-protein experiments, stable Cav3.3 cells were co-transfected with M1 receptors and equal amounts of either MAS-GRK3ct (in pcDNA3.1), Gαt (in pcDNA3.1), or RGS2 (in pEGFP) using Lipofectamine. Only MAS-GRK3ct and Gαt transfections required co-transfection with marker plasmids as RGS2 expression could be directly detected with fluorescence. In Gα transfection experiments, stable Cav3.3 cells were transfected with constitutively active mutants of Gαq,Gα11,orGα13 (Gαq-Q209L, Gα11-Q209L, and Gα13-Q226L, respectively, all in pcDNA3.1) using Lipofectamine. Twelve to 18 h after transfection, the medium was changed from Opti-MEM I to regular Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, and cells were transferred to a 28 °C incubator. The M1 to M5, Gαq-Q209L,Gα11-Q209L, and Gα13-Q226L cDNAs were all obtained from the UMR cDNA Resource Center (Rolla, MO), and the RGS2 and MAS-GRK3ct constructs were a generous gift from Dr. Brett Adams.In separate experiments, HEK 293H cells were co-transfected with M1 and wild type (WT) or chimeric human Cav3.1 or Cav3.3 channels using standard Ca2+ phosphate transfection with 2 μg of total cDNA/dish, 0.15 to 0.4 μg of channel cDNA/dish, and 0.2 μg of M1 cDNA/dish. In a subset of these experiments involving co-transfection of WT Cav3.3 and M1, either 200 μm di-C8 PI(4,5)P2 (Echelon Biosciences Inc., Salt Lake City, UT) or 50 μg/ml PI(4,5)P2 IgG2b antibody (∼1:30 dilution) (Assay Designs, Ann Arbor, MI) was included in the internal solution to explore the role of PI(4,5)P2 signaling. As the PI(4,5)P2 antibody was supplied in a phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 10% calf serum and 0.05% sodium azide, the control Cav3.3 + M1 cells were recorded in an internal solution containing a 1:30 dilution of phosphate-buffered saline with 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.05% sodium azide. Electrophysiological recordings for all experiments were performed 24–48 h after transfection. Transiently transfected cells were selected for CD8 or pEGFP expression using either adherence of Dynabeads (Dynal, Great Neck, NY) or fluorescence of EGFP under UV light.Electrophysiological Recordings and Analysis—Macroscopic currents were recorded using the perforated patch clamp technique to reduce current rundown and to preserve cytoplasmic signaling pathways. The external recording solution contained (in mm) 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 40 tetraethylammonium chloride, 92 CsCl, 10 glucose, pH 7.4, and the internal pipette solution contained (in mm) 120 Cs+ methanesulfonate, 11 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 2 MgCl2, 75–100 μm β-escin, pH 7.2. For these perforated patch recordings, experimental recording did not begin until the series resistance was below 20 megohms and constant, as measured by amplifier compensation. Whole-cell recordings were used for the transiently transfected WT or chimeric human Cav3.1 and Cav3.3 channel experiments as well as the Gα transfection experiments. The internal solution for these recordings contained (in mm) 120 Cs+ methanesulfonate, 11 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 2 MgCl2, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 sodium GTP. Macroscopic currents were recorded using Axopatch 200A and 200B amplifiers (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), controlled and monitored with Pentium 4 personal computers running pClamp software version 9 (Axon Instruments). Patch pipettes (borosilicate glass BF150-86-10; Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) were pulled using a Sutter P-87 puller and polished with a Narishige (Tokyo, Japan) microforge, with typical resistances of 3–6 megohms when filled with internal solution. The bath was connected to the ground via a 3 m KCl agar bridge.Data were low-pass filtered at 2 kHz using the built-in Bessel filter of the amplifier, with sampling at 10 kHz. The amplifier was also used for capacitance and series resistance compensation between 70 and 85% on every cell. Leak subtraction of capacitance and leakage current was performed on-line using a P/5 protocol or else performed with Clampfit (Axon Instruments) during off-line analysis. Figures and fittings utilized the software program Microcal Origin (version 7.5, Northampton, MA). All recordings were performed at room temperature (20–22 °C).The voltage dependence of activation for Cav3.1, Cav3.2, and Cav3.3 currents was measured by a series of 100–220-ms depolarizing pulses applied from a holding potential of–110 mV to membrane potentials from –80 to +10 mV, increasing at 5-mV increments, with 2 s between pulses. The potential that elicited peak currents (“peak potential” ranging from –45 to –25 mV) was obtained from this protocol and used in subsequent protocols. Series resistance was also monitored with a 5-ms depolarizing pulse to –105 mV immediately before the test pulse to ensure that this variable was relatively constant, and any changes in peak current levels were not because of significant changes in series resistance. Effects of saturating concentrations of mAChR agonist (1 mm CCh) on stable T-type currents were then investigated using steps to peak potential every 5 s (0.2 Hz) from a holding potential of –110 mV. These depolarizing steps were 80 ms in duration for Cav3.1 and Cav3.2 and 200 ms in duration for Cav3.3. The –140-mV prepulse protocol for Cav3.3 included a 1-s prepulse to –140 mV to remove any accumulated channel inactivation. To quantify the percent of channel inhibition, stimulation, or washout during CCh or control solution perfusion, the peak current magnitude at equilibrium was averaged (2–5 values). When distinct effects were observed (i.e. stimulation versus no effect of M1 on Cav3.1 currents), all cells displaying a >10% modulating effect with a clear exponential time course were grouped into one group, while the rest of the cells were grouped into the “no effect” group.Current-voltage relationships were fitted with the modified Boltzmann equation, I = (Gmax × (Vm–Erev))/(1 + exp({Vm–V0.5a}/ka)), where Vm is the test potential; V0.5a is the half-activation potential; Erev is the extrapolated reversal potential; Gmax is the maximum slope conductance, and ka reflects the slope of the activation curve. Data from CCh concentration-response studies were fitted with the equation, y = ((A1–A2)/{1 + (x/x0)P}+A2), where A1 is initial amplitude (=0) and A2 is final block value; x0 is IC50 (concentration causing 50% inhibition of currents), and P gives a measure of the steepness of the curve. The activation and inactivation rates during steps to peak potential were well described by single exponential curves to give τact and τinact values, respectively. Statistical significance was tested with Student’s t tests with significance being determined at a confidence interval of p < 0.02.Solutions, Drugs, and Perfusion—A 25 mm stock of β-escin (in distilled H2O) was prepared fresh, with dilution to working stocks in intracellular solution. Carbachol (CCh) was added directly to the extracellular recording solution. Wortmannin, okadaic acid, genistein, and H9 were all obtained from Tocris Cookson (Ellisville, MO). (Rp)-cAMP was obtained from BioMol International (Plymouth Meeting, PA). BAPTA-AM was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Unless otherwise stated, all other drugs were obtained from Sigma. Drugs were dissolved in either distilled H2OorMe2SO, according to manufacturer’s solubility data. The highest concentration of Me2SO in the recording solution did not exceed 0.1%, a concentration that did not detectably affect T-type properties (data not shown). Gravity-driven perfusion occurred at a rate of ∼400 μl/min, and the outputs of the manifold were placed within close proximity of the cell, resulting in the cell being bathed in new solutions with minimal delay (within 1 s).RESULTSMuscarinic M1 Receptors Selectively Inhibit Cav3.3 T-type Ca2+ Channels—To investigate the potential for T-type Ca2+ channel modulation by mAChRs, we transiently transfected HEK cell lines stably expressing individual subtypes of recombinant rat brain T-type channels with the human muscarinic M1 receptor. Perforated patch recordings with β-escin demonstrated that activation of M1 with 1 mm CCh caused a rapid (<30 s) and robust inhibition of exogenously expressed rat brain Cav3.3 T-type channel peak currents (–45 ± 2%, n = 34) (Fig. 1, C and F). Only a small subpopulation of stable Cav3.3 cells (<10%) was not affected by CCh application (likely representing cells untransfected with the M1 receptor).Activation of M1 with 1 mm CCh had no significant effect (p > 0.05) on the voltage dependence of Cav3.3 currents but significantly increased both the rates of activation and inactivation (p < 0.001; Table 1). In contrast to the clear inhibition of Cav3.3 T-type currents, activation of M1 receptors with 1 mm CCh largely had no effect on the peak current amplitude of either rat brain Cav3.1(–2.1 ± 2.0%, n = 18) or Cav3.2 channels (–0.1 ± 2.3%, n = 17) (Fig. 1, A, B, D, and E). In a small subset of both Cav3.1 and Cav3.2 currents we noted a stimulation induced by M1 activation (Cav3.1 = 35 ± 12%, n = 4; Cav3.2 = 36 ± 12%, n = 5), with a slower time course to equilibrium of greater than 1 min (n = 3 and n = 4, respectively). For the prevalent null effect on Cav3.1 and Cav3.2 currents, 1 mm CCh application had no significant effect on channel activation and inactivation kinetics or the voltage dependence of activation (p > 0.05; Table 1).TABLE 1Effects of receptor activation on T-type channel kinetic and voltage-dependent properties2 mm Ca2+ control1 mm carbacholτactτinactV50actτactτinactV50actmsmsmVmsmsmVCav3.3 + M1′(inhibition)6.0 ± 0.4, n = 2786 ± 6, n = 27-51 ± 2, n = 134.1 ± 0.3, n = 27ap < 0.001.31 ± 2, n = 27ap < 0.001.-49 ± 1, n = 13Human Cav3.3 + M1(whole-cell; inhibition)9.7 ± 0.8, n = 10117 ± 6, n = 10-44 ± 1, n = 45.4 ± 0.6, n = 10ap < 0.001.41 ± 5, n = 10ap < 0.001.-47 ± 1, n = 4Cav3.3 + M2(no effect)6.1 ± 0.7, n = 1081 ± 9, n = 10-53 ± 3, n = 45.5 ± 0.7, n = 1076 ± 9, n = 10-52 ± 3, n = 4Cav3.3 + M3(inhibition)9.5 ± 0.9, n = 9104 ± 13, n = 9-53 ± 4, n = 46.2 ± 0.6, n = 9bp < 0.02.56 ± 6, n = 8bp < 0.02.-50 ± 4, n = 4Cav3.3 + M4(no effect)6.7 ± 0.9, n = 6110 ± 18, n = 6-50 ± 1, n = 56.0 ± 0.9, n = 6101 ± 16, n = 6-51 ± 2, n = 5Cav3.3 + M5(inhibition)8.6 ± 0.9, n = 6127 ± 23, n = 7-48 ± 1, n = 55.6 ± 0.6, n = 649 ± 6, n = 7bp < 0.02.-45 ± 1, n = 5Cav3.3 + Control Plasmid6.0 ± 0.4, n = 578 ± 13, n = 55.2 ± 0.2, n = 571 ± 12, n = 5Cav3.1 + M1(no effect)2.3 ± 0.2, n = 1719 ± 2, n = 17-36 ± 2, n = 172.1 ± 0.2, n = 1717 ± 1, n = 17-39 ± 3, n = 11Human Cav3.1 + M1(whole-cell; no effect)2.0 ± 0.4, n = 914 ± 1, n = 9-42 ± 2, n = 61.2 ± 0.1, n = 913 ± 1, n = 9-51 ± 3, n = 4Cav3.2 + M1(no effect)4.7 ± 0.2, n = 1636 ± 2, n = 15-42 ± 1, n = 74.3 ± 0.2, n = 1634 ± 2, n = 15-40 ± 2, n = 7a p < 0.001.b p < 0.02.

Additionally, similar to that for the rat Cav3.1 T-type channel, application of 1 mm CCh to HEK cells co-transfected with the human Cav3.1 channel and M1 receptor had no significant effect on peak current amplitude (–0.3 ± 2.0%, n = 9) or channel kinetics (for 100% cells tested; p > 0.05; Fig. 7B; Table 1).

https://openalex.org/W2094037155,"Background Within genus Drosophila, the endemic Hawaiian species offer some of the most dramatic examples of morphological and behavioral evolution. The advent of the Drosophila grimshawi genome sequence permits genes of interest to be readily cloned from any of the hundreds of species of Hawaiian Drosophila, offering a powerful comparative approach to defining molecular mechanisms of species evolution. A key step in this process is to survey the Hawaiian flies for characters whose variation can be associated with specific candidate genes. The wings provide an attractive target for such studies: Wings are essentially two dimensional, and genes controlling wing shape, vein specification, pigment production, and pigment pattern evolution have all been identified in Drosophila. Methodology/Principal Findings We present a photographic database of over 180 mounted, adult wings from 73 species of Hawaiian Drosophila. The image collection, available at FlyBase.org, includes 53 of the 112 known species of “picture wing” Drosophila, and several species from each of the other major Hawaiian groups, including the modified mouthparts, modified tarsus, antopocerus, and haleakalae (fungus feeder) groups. Direct image comparisons show that major wing shape changes can occur even between closely related species, and that pigment pattern elements can vary independently of each other. Among the 30 species closest to grimshawi, diverse visual effects are achieved by altering a basic pattern of seven wing spots. Finally, we document major pattern variations within species, which appear to result from reduced diffusion of pigment precursors through the wing blade. Conclusions/Significance The database highlights the striking variation in size, shape, venation, and pigmentation in Hawaiian Drosophila, despite their generally low levels of DNA sequence divergence. In several independent lineages, highly complex patterns are derived from simple ones. These lineages offer a promising model system to study the evolution of complexity."

However, all of the nuclear functions of IKKα are not understood. In this study, using mouse embryonic fibroblasts IKKα knock-out and reexpressing IKKα after retroviral transduction, we demonstrate that IKKα contributes to NF-κB/p65 DNA binding activity on an exogenous κB element and on some, but not all, endogenous NF-κB-target promoters. Indeed, p65 chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that IKKα is crucial for p65 binding on κB sites of icam-1 and mcp-1 promoters but not on iκbα promoter. The mutation of IKKα putative nuclear localization sequence, which prevents its nuclear translocation, or of crucial serines in the IKKα activation loop completely inhibits p65 binding on icam-1 and mcp-1 promoters and rather enhances p65 binding on the iκbα promoter. Further molecular studies demonstrated that the removal of chromatin-bound HDAC3, a histone deacetylase inhibiting p65 DNA binding, is differentially regulated by IKKα in a promoter-specific manner. Indeed, whereas the absence of IKKα induces HDAC3 recruitment and repression on the icam-1 promoter, it has an opposite effect on the iκbα promoter, where a better p65 binding occurs. We conclude that nuclear IKKα is required for p65 DNA binding in a gene-specific manner.

NF-κB consists of homo- or heterodimers of a group of five proteins, namely NF-κB1 (p50 and its precursor p105), NF-κB2 (p52 and its precursor p100), p65/RelA, c-Rel, and RelB (5Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3377) Google Scholar). In unstimulated cells, NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm through its tight association with inhibitory proteins of the IκB family, comprising notably IκBα (5Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3377) Google Scholar). Upon cellular stimulation with proinflammatory cytokines, lipopolysaccharide, antigens or viral products, the so-called classical NF-κB activation pathway is engaged. IκBα is rapidly phosphorylated on Ser32 and Ser36, which triggers its polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26 S proteasome. The freed NF-κB then translocates into the nucleus, where it binds κB sites and enhances transcription of a large number of genes implicated notably in the inflammatory response (5Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3377) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of IκBα on Ser32 and Ser36 is achieved by the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, which includes the scaffold protein NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO; also called IKKγ) (6Yamaoka S. Courtois G.

This alternative pathway is engaged notably upon lymphotoxin-β or B cell-activating factor induction and enhances NF-κB-inducing kinase- and IKKα-dependent processing of p100 into p52 (8Dejardin E.

IKK-independent phosphorylation of IκBα on Tyr42 has also been reported upon sodium pervanadate or hypoxia/reoxygenation treatment (11Takada Y. Mukhopadhyay A. Kundu G.C. Mahabeleshwar G.H. Singh S.

This tyrosine phosphorylation is mediated by c-Src tyrosine kinase and triggers dissociation/degradation of IκBα from NF-κB complexes, allowing NF-κB to translocate into the nucleus (12Fan C. Li Q.

Generation of knock-out mice for IKK complex subunits has revealed that IKKβ is the main kinase responsible for IκBα Ser32 and Ser36 phosphorylation and that NEMO/IKKγ assembles the IKKs into a functional kinase complex upon the classical pathway (15Li Z.W.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 854-862PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, whereas IKKα is crucial for p100 phosphorylation and subsequent NF-κB activation through the alternative pathway (10Dejardin E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 72: 1161-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), in most cases this kinase is not required for the signal-induced phosphorylation of IκBα in the cytoplasm. Nevertheless, an optimal induction of NF-κB-dependent genes through the classical pathway appears to rely on the nuclear translocation of IKKα (19Gloire G. Dejardin E. Piette J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 72: 1081-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Indeed, once in the nucleus, IKKα acts in a process called derepression that allows full NF-κB-mediated transcription by removing repressor complexes, such as SMRT and HDAC3, from target promoters (20Hoberg J.E. Yeung F. Mayo M.W. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 245-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). IKKα also phosphorylates histone H3, a component of nucleosomes. This phosphorylation triggers subsequent acetylation of histone H3 on Lys14 by the IKKα-associated histone acetyltransferase CREB-binding protein, a crucial step in modulating chromatin accessibility at NF-κB-responsive promoters (21Anest V.

Nature. 2003; 423: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Besides a role of nuclear IKKα in positively regulating NF-κB-dependent gene transcription, IKKα also limits NF-κB activation in LPS-stimulated macrophages by mediating p65 and c-Rel turnover through phosphorylation of their C-terminal part (24Lawrence T. Bebien M. Liu G.Y. Nizet V. Karin M. Nature. 2005; 434: 1138-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Some authors have also suggested that IKKα contributes to direct p65 DNA binding, since electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) experiments using ikkα-/- MEFs or HeLa cells transfected with IKKα small interfering RNA exhibit a clear inhibition of NF-κB binding activity upon TNF-α treatment, despite a quite unaltered IκBα phosphorylation/degradation (25Li Q. Lu Q. Hwang J.Y. Buscher D. Lee K.F. Izpisua-Belmonte J.C. Verma I.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 26Takaesu G. Surabhi R.M. Park K.J. Ninomiya-Tsuji J.

Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Johnson R. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar), including recent data obtained by p65 chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis on several NF-κB target genes in ikkα-/- MEFs (21Anest V. Hanson J.L. Cogswell P.C. Steinbrecher K.A. Strahl B.D. Baldwin A.S. Nature. 2003; 423: 659-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 23Yamamoto Y. Verma U.N. Prajapati S. Kwak Y.T. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 2003; 423: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Such a discrepancy reflects the need to determine whether or not a general mechanism can be drawn for all genes or whether some promoter-specific effects occur. Here, we have addressed the role of IKKα in the control of NF-κB/p65 DNA binding in mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking IKKα or complemented with either wild-type (WT) or mutant IKKα upon TNF-α stimulation. We showed that IKKα is required for p65 DNA binding on specific, but not all NF-κB-dependent, promoters. Indeed, p65 ChIP assays revealed that IKKα is crucial for p65 binding on κB sites of the icam-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule-1) and mcp-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) promoters but not on the iκbα promoter. This binding requires IKKα catalytic activity and an intact nuclear localization sequence (NLS), suggesting that IKKα acts in the nucleus to mediate its effects. Further molecular studies demonstrated that IKKα modifies HDAC3 recruitment in a promoter-specific manner, thereby explaining its gene-specific activity. Cell Culture, Antibodies, and Reagents—MEFs were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% of heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 2 mm l-glutamine. Antibodies against p65 and HDAC3 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) (sc-109 for p65 ChIP and Western blotting, sc-372G for p65 immunocytochemistry, and sc-11417 for HDAC3 ChIP). The antibodies against IKKα were from Pharmingen (for Western blotting) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-7182 for immunocytochemistry). Antibody against IKKβ was from Upstate Biotechnology (catalog number 05-035). Other antibodies were from StressGen (HSP60) and BD Transduction Laboratories (NBS1). Antibody against IκBα was a gift from R. Hay (St. Andrews, UK). Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-goat and 546 goat anti-rabbit antibodies were from Molecular Probes. Human recombinant TNF-α was from Peprotech, trichostatin A (TSA) was from Sigma, and SYBR green PCR master mix was from Applied Biosystems. Sodium pervanadate was prepared as described (29Gloire G.

The IKKα NLS mutant was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) by replacing Lys235, Lys236, and Lys237 of WT IKKα with alanines. These constructs were transfected by the calcium phosphate method into 293T cells in combination with the pEC ampho expression vector (8Dejardin E. Droin N.M. Delhase M. Haas E. Cao Y. Makris C.

Two days later, supernatants were collected and filtered prior to the transduction of ikkα-/- MEFs, and IKKα expression was confirmed by Western blotting. Western Blotting and EMSA—Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (30Dejardin E. Bonizzi G. Bellahcene A. Castronovo V. Merville M.P. Bours V. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1835-1841PubMed Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic extracts were analyzed by Western blotting as described (31Schoonbroodt S. Ferreira V. Best-Belpomme M. Boelaert J.R. Legrand-Poels S.

Immunocytochemistry and Confocal Microscopy—p65 and IKKα nuclear translocation was visualized by confocal microscopy. To visualize p65, TNF-α-treated MEFs were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% fetal calf serum, slides were incubated with goat anti-p65 antibody (sc-372G; 1:100 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 37 °C and then washed and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-goat antibody (1:400 dilution) for 1 h at 37 °C. The slides were then washed, incubated with propidium iodide to visualize nuclei, mounted, and analyzed with a Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope (Van Hopplynus). For IKKα immunolocalization, slides were incubated in 100% methanol at -20 °C for 6 min and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% gelatin (Bio-Rad) and 0.25% bovine serum albumin (Invitrogen). Then cells were incubated with the primary antibody (sc-7182; 1:100 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in blocking solution overnight at 4 °C. After washing, cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:100 dilution) for 2 h at room temperature. Samples were mounted and analyzed with a LSM 510 Zeiss confocal microscope. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—ChIP assays were carried out, and the solutions were prepared in our laboratory following the Upstate Cell Signaling protocol. After cross-linking with formaldehyde, treated cells were lysed and sonicated such that DNA fragments were 200–1,000 base pairs in length. After a preclear with protein A-agarose beads saturated with herring sperm DNA (Sigma), extracts were incubated overnight with a rabbit polyclonal anti-p65 antibody (sc-109; 2 μg; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or HDAC3 antibody (sc-11417; 2 μg; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To take into account aspecific binding to the beads, a treated extract was also incubated with an irrelevant antibody (anti-FLAG; M2; Sigma). The next day, precipitation was carried out with saturated protein A-agarose beads. Cross-link was reversed at 65 °C for 4 h, and precipitated DNA was purified using phenol/chloroform extraction. Quantitative PCR (using SYBR green PCR master mix; Applied Biosystems) was performed on the immunoprecipitated DNA by normalizing to input DNA for each sample. The following primers, amplifying specific κB sites of the following genes, were used: icam-1 forward, 5′-CATTACTTCAGTTTGGAAATTCCTAGATC3′; icam-1 reverse, 5′-GGAACGAGGGCTTCGGTATT-3′; mcp-1 forward, 5′-CACCCCATTACATCTCTTCCCC-3′; mcp-1 reverse, 5′-TGTTTCCCTCTCACTTCACTCTGTC-3′; IκBα forward, 5′-TGGCGAGGTCTGACTGTTGTGG-3′; IκBα reverse, 5′-GCTCATCAAAAAGTTCCCTGTGC-3′. IKKα Is Required for NF-κB DNA Binding on an Exogenous κB Element upon Pervanadate and TNF-α Stimulation—To assess potential additional roles of the IKK complex subunits beside the signal-induced degradation of the IκBα proteins in the cytoplasm, we treated MEF cells with sodium pervanadate (Pv). This treatment induces tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκBα through a IKK-independent mechanism (12Fan C. Li Q. Ross D. Engelhardt J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2072-2080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 13Imbert V. Rupec R.A. Livolsi A. Pahl H.L. Traenckner E.B. Mueller-Dieckmann C. Farahifar D. Rossi B.

Piette J. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 5485-5494Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As revealed by an electromobility shift assay using a probe corresponding to the κB site of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat, Pv induces a strong NF-κB activation in WT MEFs, due to an almost complete degradation of IκBα (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, Pv-induced NF-κB DNA binding activity is totally abolished in MEFs lacking both IKKα and IKKβ, despite unaltered IκBα degradation (Fig. 1A). The analysis of single knock-out MEFs for either IKKα or IKKβ revealed that the abolition of NF-κB binding activity is still observable in ikkα-/- MEFs, but there is a partial recovery of NF-κB DNA binding in ikkβ-/- MEFs, suggesting that IKKα is required for NF-κB DNA binding on an exogenous κB element (Fig. 1A). To further confirm the role of IKKα in NF-κB binding, we reconstituted ikkα-/- MEFs with retroviral expression vectors encoding either wild-type IKKα or the inactivable IKKα mutant harboring the mutations S176A and S180A within the activation loop (IKKα AA) (32Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). As control, we used ikkα-/- MEFs reconstituted with an empty vector. Western blot analysis confirmed the expression of IKKα in reconstituted MEFs (Fig. 1B). We observed a recovery in NF-κB DNA binding in ikkα-/- MEFs reconstituted with both IKKα WT and AA upon Pv stimulation but not in MEFs transduced with an empty vector (Fig. 1C). The kinetics of IκBα degradation were mostly the same in the three cell lines (Fig. 1C). These data suggest that IKKα contributes to the NF-κB DNA binding on an exogenous κB element in Pv-stimulated MEFs independently of its kinase activity. The same experiments were carried out with TNF-α as an inducer. Mobility shift assays revealed a clear inhibition of NF-κB DNA binding in ikkα-/- MEFs transduced with an empty vector, compared with WT MEFs, despite a similar profile of IκBα degradation (Fig. 2A). Reconstitution of ikkα-/- MEFs with IKKα WT or AA restored a normal NF-κB binding upon TNF-α induction (Fig. 2B). Altogether, these results suggest that IKKα is required for NF-κB DNA binding independently of its kinase activity.FIGURE 2IKKα is required for TNF-α-induced NF-κB DNA binding on an exogenousκB element. A and B, MEFs that were WT and ikkα-/- transduced with an empty vector or a vector coding for IKKα WT or AA were treated with TNF-α (200 units/ml) for the indicated times.

Maeda S. Sano Y. Roop D.R. Karin M. Nature. 2004; 428: 660-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). To further explore whether IKKα must enter into the nucleus to modulate the NF-κB DNA binding activity, we generated a mutant form of IKKα bearing alanines instead of three important lysines within its NLS (33Sil A.K.

This mutant failed to accumulate in the nucleus when overexpressed in 293T cells, whereas the wild-type IKKα did (Fig. 3A). Next we reconstituted ikkα-/- MEFs with retrovirus encoding IKKα NLS mutant. Western blot analysis confirmed the expression of IKKα NLS-mutated in reconstituted MEFs (Fig. 3B). To further characterize the functionality of IKKα NLS in MEFs, we carried out confocal microscopy. Detection of endogenous IKKα in WT MEFs revealed that the cellular distribution of IKKα is mainly cytoplasmic, but this protein also appears in the nucleus as speckles (Fig. 3C). Similar results were obtained using ikkα-/- MEFs transduced with WT IKKα (Fig. 3C). On the contrary, no nuclear distribution was observed using the NLS-mutated IKKα (Fig. 3C). Absence of immunoreactivity in ikkα-/- MEFs confirmed antibody specificity (Fig. 3C). This suggests that a small portion of IKKα enters within the nucleus in MEFs, and the mutation of IKKα NLS prevents this translocation. We next carried out a mobility shift experiment with MEFs expressing NLS-mutated IKKα compared with MEFs expressing WT IKKα. TNF-α and Pv-induced NF-κB DNA binding was strongly reduced in MEFs expressing NLS-mutated IKKα, despite a quite unaltered IκBα degradation (Fig. 3D). These data suggest that a small fraction of IKKα functions in the nucleus enhancing NF-κB DNA binding. p65 Translocates Normally into the Nucleus in ikkα-/- MEFs or MEFs Expressing NLS-mutated IKKα upon TNF-α Stimulation—To explore whether the absence of NF-κB DNA binding in MEFs lacking IKKα or expressing IKKα NLS-mutated is due to an altered NF-κB nuclear translocation, we performed a large panel of anti-p65 Western blots on cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts of MEFs treated with TNF-α. As shown in Fig. 4A, p65 nuclear accumulation is maximal after 30 min of treatment in WT MEFs and then decreases at 60 min. The same profile of p65 nuclear translocation was observed in ikkα-/- MEFs reconstituted with an empty vector or expressing IKKα WT or AA (Fig. 4A). p65 nuclear translocation was also observed in MEFs where the IKKα NLS was mutated. Interestingly, the basal level of nuclear p65 is more important compared with other cells (Fig. 4A). Western blot analysis for cytoplasmic p65 revealed that its level of expression is constant across the analyzed cell lines (Fig. 4A). The purity of extracts was controlled by reprobing the membrane with antibodies raised against NBS and HSP60 (Fig. 4A). Unaltered p65 nuclear accumulation upon TNF-α stimulation of MEFs lacking IKKα or expressing IKKα NLS-mutated was further confirmed by immunolocalization of p65 using confocal microscopy (Fig. 4B). This experiment also confirmed an elevated basal nuclear accumulation of p65 in MEFs IKKα NLS-mutated (Fig. 4B). Altogether, we conclude that inhibition of NF-κB activation observed by EMSA in the absence of IKKα or when IKKα NLS is mutated is not due to a lack of p65 translocation. IKKα Mediates Recruitment of p65 on Specific NF-κB-dependent Endogenous Promoters—To extend our analyses, we used p65 ChIP assays to determine whether defects in NF-κB DNA binding observed by electromobility shift assays were also confirmed on endogenous promoters. After chromatin immunoprecipitation with p65 antibody, real time PCR was used to amplify κB consensus sequences of promoters of three NF-κB target genes: icam-1, mcp-1, and iκbα. These genes were selected because they encode proteins important in inflammation and innate immunity (icam-1 and mcp-1) or for the negative feedback of NF-κB regulation (iκbα). TNF-α treatment of WT MEFs induced two waves of p65 recruitment on icam-1 and mcp-1 promoter κB sites, which reached a maximum at 30 and 120 min. However, p65 recruitment is clearly inhibited in ikkα-/- MEFs, particularly after 30 and 60 min of treatment (Fig. 5, A and B). Interestingly, p65 recruitment on iκbα promoter in ikkα-/- MEFs is slightly reduced but not totally inhibited, as observed for icam-1 and mcp-1 (Fig. 5C). Similar results were obtained with the interleukin-6 promoter (data not shown). These data suggest that IKKα is required for p65 DNA binding on some but not all promoters. Reconstitution of ikkα-/- MEFs with a vector encoding WT IKKα completely restored recruitment of p65 on icam-1 and mcp-1 promoters, whereas no changes were observed regarding p65 DNA binding on iκbα promoter (Fig. 6, A–C). Complementation of ikkα-/- MEFs with IKKα AA or NLS clearly inhibits p65 recruitment on icam-1 and mcp-1 promoters but not on the iκbα promoter (Fig. 6, A–C). In this case, an increase in p65 DNA binding is even observed (Fig. 6C). Collectively, these experiments prompt us to conclude that IKKα is crucial for p65 DNA binding on some but not all promoters. Indeed, the iκbα promoter does not seem to require IKKα for p65 recruitment, whereas icam-1 and mcp-1 promoters do. p65 recruitment on these promoters is abrogated by IKKα AA or NLS mutations, whereas these mutations rather enhance p65 binding on the iκbα promoter.FIGURE 6p65 recruitment on specific endogenous promoters in MEFs expressing IKKα wild-type, AA, or NLS-mutated. ikkα-/- MEFs transduced with either an empty vector or vector coding for IKKα WT, AA, or NLS-mutated were treated with TNF-α (200 units/ml) for the indicated times.

Intraepithelial lymphocytes and immune cells of the lamina propria express cytokines such as interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-2, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and TNF-β. Many of these cytokines are known to stimulate proliferation and differentiation of IEC cells (1Sansonetti P.J. Nat. Rev.

Cell Res. 1996; 225: 422-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), but the mechanisms have not been elucidated. Janus kinase 3 (Jak3) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that interacts with receptors for IL-2, IL-5, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15 through the common γ-chain (8Safford M.G. Levenstein M. Tsifrina E. Amin S.

This suggests that both proteins may be important for intestinal wound repair, but the role of Jak3 has not been investigated previously in intestinal epithelial repair mechanisms.Villin is an actin-binding protein expressed in specific epithelial cells including those of the intestines. It can nucleate, cap, sever, and bundle actin filaments. Previously we have shown that the actin modifying activity of villin can be regulated by either its binding to different ligands (e.g. Ca2+, PIP2) or through tyrosine phosphorylation (11Kumar N.

Also the migratory capacity of IEC was shown to be reduced in villin knock-out mice during an experimental colitis condition (15Ferrary E. Cohen-Tannoudji M. Pehau-Arnaudet G. Lapillonne A. Athman R.

In this report, we demonstrate that intestinal epithelial cells express functionally specific Jak3, a potent non-receptor tyrosine kinase whose biological functions have been presumed to be largely limited to lymphocyte and macrophage populations (8Safford M.G.

These were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). For IL-2 treatments, confluent monolayers of cells were kept in DMEM containing 0.1% fetal calf serum for 17 h before replacement with fresh media containing human recombinant IL-2 (Sigma).Immunoprecipitations (IP) and Immunoblotting—For IP confluent Caco-2 and HT-29 Cl-19A cells were lysed using lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.15 units/ml aprotinin, 20 μm leupeptin, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1% Nonidet P-40 at 4 °C for 20 min. The cell lysates were subjected to IP with pY20-, Jak3-, and villin-specific antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The immunoblotting of the SDS-PAGE-separated protein complex was done using the same antibodies.Wound closure assay and immunofluorescence microscopy (IFM) were done as described previously (14Tomar A. Wang Y. Kumar N. George S. Ceacareanu B. Hassid A. Chapman K.E. Aryal A.M. Waters C.M. Khurana S. Mol. Biol.

Merz H. Schorle H. Schimpl A. Feller A.C. Horak I. Cell. 1993; 75: 253-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar) and in human colitis patients (7Melgar S. Yeung M.M. Bas A.

Immunol. 2003; 134: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), we investigated whether IL-2 stimulates IEC migration in vitro using a scratch wound assay. As shown in Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1 recombinant human IL-2 stimulated wound closure in the differentiated HT-29 Cl-19A and Caco-2 (supplemental Fig S2, A and B) cells in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment of IECs with IL-2 led to more than a 2-fold increase in wound closure of both of these cell lines. To determine whether IL-2-stimulated cell migration was mediated by activation of Jaks in general and Jak3 in particular, the cells were treated with either the pan-Jak inhibitor AG-490 or the Jak3-specific inhibitor WHI-P131. The IL-2-stimulated increase in wound closure was specifically diminished by both inhibitors to the same extent, suggesting that IL-2-induced wound closure in intestinal epithelial cells is mediated by Jak3 activation.IL-2 Induces the Activation of Jak3—The functional role of Jak3 in intestinal epithelial cells has not been identified previously, and there is only one report to date showing that Jak3 is expressed in intestinal epithelial cells (18Lin Q.

Pathol. 2005; 167: 969-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular basis of IL-2-induced wound closure in IEC, we determined the activation of Jak3, an IL-2 receptor-interacting kinase, in response to IL-2 treatment. Following treatment of IEC with IL-2 for different periods of time, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (pY20) and then were immunoblotted with a Jak3-specific antibody. As shown in Fig. 2A (upper panel), IL-2 induced an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak3 in both HT-29 Cl-19A and Caco2 (supplemental Fig S3) cells. Although phosphorylation increased rapidly and then decreased by 120 min, phosphorylation of Jak3 was sustained at a high level for at least 60 min. These results demonstrate that activation of Jak3 is not restricted to immunocytes but also occurs in IEC.FIGURE 2A, time course of IL-2-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak3 in HT-29 Cl-19A. Confluent cells were treated with IL-2 (50 units/ml) for the indicated times. Cells were lysed using lysis buffer, and equal amounts of Jak3 protein (input control, lower panel) were subjected to immunoprecipitation using a phosphotyrosine (pY20)-specific antibody. Western analysis (IB, immunoblot) of the SDS-PAGE-separated protein complex was done using a Jak3-specific antibody (upper panel).

To determine whether IL-2 regulates the distribution of Jak3 in IEC, HT-29 Cl-19A cells were treated with IL-2, and the distribution of Jak3 was analyzed by IFM using a Jak3-specific monoclonal antibody. As shown in Fig. 2B (with an enlarged view of a single cell in the lower panel) the distribution of Jak3 in serum-starved HT-29 Cl-19A cells (Control) is cytoplasmic without clear compartmentalization. However, treatment with IL-2 for 15 min led to redistribution of Jak3 to the cell margin in subconfluent cells (Fig. 2C) with higher concentrations of Jak3 localized in regions of the cells where there were intercellular spaces (indicated by arrows). These regions typically contain lamellipodial and filopodial extensions as the cell spreads (enlarged view of single cell in the lower panel of Fig. 2C). We chose the 15-min time point because the maximum phosphorylation of Jak3 following IL-2 treatment occurs at that time. The redistribution of Jak3 to the cell margin was inhibited by the Jak3 inhibitor WHI-P131, as shown in Fig. 2D, and the enlarged view of a single cell in the corresponding lower panel. These results demonstrate that IL-2-induced activation of Jak3 is necessary for its recruitment at the cell margin.IL-2 Stimulates Jak3 Interactions with Villin—Given that villin plays a significant role in cytoskeletal remodeling and cell migration in IEC (14Tomar A. Wang Y. Kumar N. George S. Ceacareanu B. Hassid A. Chapman K.E. Aryal A.M. Waters C.M. Khurana S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4807-4817Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), we tested the hypothesis that IL-2-stimulated cell migration in intestinal enterocytes was mediated through activation of villin. Following IL-2 treatment of HT-29 Cl-19A cells, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with pY20 and immunoblotted with an antibody against villin. As shown in Fig. 3A (upper panel), treatment of IEC with IL-2 led to a rapid increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of villin for up to 15 min with a subsequent decrease by 60 min. To test the hypothesis that Jak3 is responsible for the tyrosine phosphorylation of villin in IL-2-stimulated intestinal enterocytes, the cells were treated with WHI-P131, and the tyrosine phosphorylation of villin was assessed. Fig. 3B shows that the tyrosine phosphorylation of villin stimulated by 15 min of IL-2 treatment was completely blocked by the Jak3 inhibitor WHI-P131. To determine whether Jak3 associates with villin, we immunoprecipitated cell lysates from IL-2-treated or untreated cells with mouse IgG (as a negative control)-, Jak3 (as a positive control)-, or villin-specific antibodies and immunoblotted with the Jak3-specific antibody. As shown in Fig. 3C, IL-2 treatment stimulated association of Jak3 with villin, and this association was blocked by WHI-P131. The association of Jak3 with villin was also confirmed by IFM (supplemental Fig. S4). Supplemental Fig S4 shows that Jak3 did not co-localize with villin in control cells (A), but treatment with IL-2 led Jak3 to co-localize with villin at the cell periphery and filopodial extension (B). Co-localization was not apparent in cells treated with IL-2 in the presence of Jak3 inhibitor WHI-P131. To determine whether Jak3 directly phosphorylates villin, we performed a cell-free kinase assay using bacterially expressed recombinant villin and Jak3 kinase. The autoradiogram of SDS-PAGE-separated reaction mixtures shows that Jak3 directly phosphorylates villin in the presence of radioactive ATP (Fig. 3D, upper panel). For these experiments villin alone was used as a negative control to show nonspecific radioactivity associated with villin and villin + Src was taken as a positive control, because Src is a known kinase for villin (14Tomar A. Wang Y. Kumar N. George S. Ceacareanu B. Hassid A. Chapman K.E. Aryal A.M. Waters C.M. Khurana S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4807-4817Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The input control for equal amounts of recombinant villin is shown in Fig. 3D, lower panel. These results suggest that villin is a direct cellular substrate of Jak3.FIGURE 3A–C, IL-2 stimulates the interactions of Jak3 with villin. A, time course of IL-2-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of villin. Equal amounts of villin protein (input control, lower panel) from cells treated with IL-2 (50 units/ml) for the indicated times were immunoprecipitated with pY20 and immunoblotted (IB) with an antibody against villin (upper panel) using procedures similar to those described in Fig. 2. B, inhibition of Jak3 blocks the tyrosine phosphorylation of villin. Procedures similar to those described in A were followed, except the cells were treated with IL-2 in the presence or absence of the Jak3 inhibitor WHI-P131.

Cells were treated with or without IL-2 for 1 h and subjected to immunoprecipitation as mentioned under “Experimental Procedures” using IgG-, Jak3-, and villin-specific antibodies. The SDS-PAGE-separated protein complex was immunoblotted with a Jak3-specific antibody. The lanes shown are from the same blot (unrelated lanes were removed for clarity). D, Jak3 directly phosphorylates recombinant villin in vitro. An in vitro kinase assay was done as reported previously (16Wang R. Griffin P.R. Small E.C. Thompson J.E. Arch Biochem.

Procedures similar to those described in Fig. 2, B–D, were followed, except rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin was used to stain F-actin in the paraformaldehyde-fixed cells. For planar distribution of actin, the first plane of the cells was determined using bright field images through the adjustment of the focal plane using the software LSM Pascal (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) to the point where no images were visible and above which the boundary of cells was visible with a 1 μm change of the focal plane. The subsequent 19 planes were taken using the first plane as a reference.

HT-29 CL-19A cells were first wounded and then treated with IL-2 for 15 min in the presence or absence of the Jak3 inhibitor WHI-P131. The cells were fixed and stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin, and planar distributions of F-actin were examined using confocal microscopy. Fig. 3E shows a uniform distribution of F-actin in planes at different distances from the substratum in control cells, whereas cells treated with IL-2 for 15 min exhibit a loss of actin filaments from the basal planes (Fig. 3F). Inhibition of Jak3 with WHI-P131 partially prevented the loss of F-actin from the basal planes (Fig. 3G). WHI-P131 alone had no effect on actin redistribution (supplemental Fig S5). To quantify these results, we measured the average fluorescence per unit area of the cells as a function of the distance from the substratum. Fig. 3H summarizes these results from seven different fields from three independent experiments for each condition. Although substantial levels of F-actin were measured in the first 5-μm distance from the substratum in control cells, very little F-actin was measured in these planes in IL-2-treated cells. However, treatment with WHI-P131 partially blocked the F-actin redistribution caused by IL-2. This may be due to the presence of other actin-remodeling proteins activated by IL-2.DISCUSSIONIL-2 is secreted by lymphocytes and plays a major role in stimulating proliferation of mucosal lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and macrophages (20Waldmann T.A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Until recently, IL-2 was thought to be restricted to regulating the growth and differentiation of immunocytes during inflammatory response (21Kaempfer R. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1994; 206: 176-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 22Kikuchi T. Watanabe M. Ohno T. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1991; 82: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), but there is increasing evidence that IL-2 is important for the maintenance and repair of the gut mucosa. Functional IL-2 receptors have been identified in several intestinal cell lines, in rat small intestinal enterocytes, and in human colonocytes, implying a physiological role for IL-2 in modulating epithelial function (4Ciacci C. Mahida Y.R. Dignass A. Koizumi M. Podolsky D.K. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 92: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 5Reinecker H.C. Podolsky D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8353-8357Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Also, human colitis patients show substantial reduction in the expression of IL-2 (7Melgar S. Yeung M.M. Bas A. Forsberg G. Suhr O. Oberg A. Hammarstrom S. Danielsson A. Hammarstrom M.L. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2003; 134: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Moreover, disruption of the IL-2 gene leads to prolonged intestinal inflammation, severe ulcerative colitis, and death in knock-out mice, suggesting that IL-2 is important for the control of inflammation in the intestine (6Sadlack B. Merz H. Schorle H. Schimpl A. Feller A.C. Horak I. Cell. 1993; 75: 253-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that IL-2 helps to minimize intestinal inflammation by enhancing the wound repair of IEC. To test this hypothesis we studied intestinal epithelial wound repair in vitro using post-confluent differentiated IECs treated with recombinant human IL-2. Our results show that IL-2 increased IEC wound repair in a dose-dependent manner. However, at higher concentrations of IL-2 the mucosal wound repair was independent of IL-2 concentrations. We speculate that immune cell production of IL-2 is tightly regulated in the normal intestine but is up-regulated following injury to facilitate wound repair. IL-2 has been shown to enhance wound repair of undifferentiated IEC, but the mechanism has not been determined (3Dignass A.U. Podolsky D.K. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 422-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We investigated the mechanism through which IL-2 regulates intestinal epithelial wound repair.Our results demonstrate that IL-2 induces cell migration in the intestinal enterocytes through activation of Jak3. Janus kinases play an essential role in cytokine signaling and have been reported to regulate plasma membrane expression of their cognate receptors (19Hofmann S.R. Lam A.Q. Frank S. Zhou Y.J. Ramos H.L. Kanno Y. Agnello D. Youle R.J. O'Shea J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5039-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For example, overexpression of Jak3 in HeLa cells enhanced accumulation of the γ-chain (γc) of the IL receptor at the plasma membrane. Moreover, membrane expression of γc was necessary for the membrane localization of Jak3, where it co-localized with the γc of IL-2 receptors (19Hofmann S.R. Lam A.Q. Frank S. Zhou Y.J. Ramos H.L. Kanno Y. Agnello D. Youle R.J. O'Shea J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5039-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that IL-2 stimulated wound repair in intestinal enterocytes through time-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak3 (Fig. 2A), which led to the redistribution of Jak3 to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2C). Jak3 appeared to localize into subcellular structures at the edge of cells, which may be important in the wound closure process. We speculate that IL-2-stimulated activation of Jak3 led to Jak3 recruitment at the plasma membrane through the γc of IL-2 receptors.We demonstrated a novel mechanism through which IL-2-stimulated wound closure in intestinal enterocytes involves a time-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the intestinal cytoskeletal component villin. Furthermore, Jak3 interacts directly with villin, and inhibition of Jak3 prevents IL-2-induced villin phosphorylation. Also, Jak3 directly phosphorylates recombinant villin in a cell free assay. Moreover tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak3 in cells remained elevated after 6 h (∼10-fold higher compared with the initial level), whereas tyrosine phosphorylation of villin returned to the initial level by 1 h. To our knowledge this is the first report showing direct interactions of Jak3 with any actin-binding protein and its functional significance. We speculate that Jak3 and villin may coordinate the initiation of the wound repair process, and this may be followed by alternative signaling pathways during long-term repair mechanisms. Src kinase was previously reported to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of villin during epidermal growth factor-induced wound repair of intestinal epithelial cells (14Tomar A. Wang Y. Kumar N. George S. Ceacareanu B. Hassid A. Chapman K.E. Aryal A.M. Waters C.M. Khurana S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4807-4817Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Our studies demonstrate an alternative pathway for the tyrosine phosphorylation of villin during intestinal wound repair.Rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton is essential for cell migration during wound repair, and our results demonstrate for the first time that IL-2 stimulates planar redistribution of F-actin in migrating cells (Fig. 3E). IL-2 treatment led to the loss of F-actin from the basal plane of the migrating enterocytes within 15 min. This loss of F-actin may facilitate two processes important for cell migration. First, the severing of actin filaments at the leading edge of cells generates new actin nuclei for polymerization to promote cellular extension. Next, the initial detachment of the leading edge of the cells from the substratum allows cell body movement. The redistribution of Jak3 may facilitate these processes through its interactions and tyrosine p"
https://openalex.org/W1970832793,"Pancreatic and lung inflammation during acute pancreatitis is a poorly understood, but clinically important, phenomenon. The proto-oncogene Tpl2 (tumor progression locus-2) has recently been shown to have important immunomodulatory effects on some inflammatory processes, but its importance to pancreatitis has not been previously examined. Our studies were designed to (a) define the effects of Tpl2 on pancreatic and lung inflammation during pancreatitis and (b) identify mechanisms and cell types responsible for those effects. We examined pancreatitis-associated Tpl2 effects in wild type and Tpl2-/- mice subjected to either secretagogue-induced or bile salt-induced pancreatitis. To determine the myeloid or non-myeloid lineage of cells responsible for the Tpl2 effects, we used Tpl2-/- chimeric mice generated by lethal irradiation followed by bone marrow transplantation. Mechanisms responsible for the effects of Tpl2 ablation on caerulein-induced proinflammatory events were evaluated under in vivo and in vitro conditions using the techniques of electrophoretic mobility shift assay, immunoblot analysis, and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. We found that Tpl2 ablation markedly reduced pancreatic and lung inflammation in these two dissimilar models of pancreatitis, but it did not alter pancreatic injury/necrosis in either model. The reduction in caerulein-induced pancreatic inflammation is dependent upon Tpl2 ablation in non-myeloid cells and is associated with both in vivo and in vitro inhibition of MEK, JNK, and AP-1 activation and the expression of MCP-1, MIP-2, and interleukin-6. Non-myeloid cell expression of Tpl2 regulates pancreatic inflammation during pancreatitis by mediating proinflammatory signals and the generation of neutrophil chemoattracting factors. Pancreatic and lung inflammation during acute pancreatitis is a poorly understood, but clinically important, phenomenon. The proto-oncogene Tpl2 (tumor progression locus-2) has recently been shown to have important immunomodulatory effects on some inflammatory processes, but its importance to pancreatitis has not been previously examined.

Non-myeloid cell expression of Tpl2 regulates pancreatic inflammation during pancreatitis by mediating proinflammatory signals and the generation of neutrophil chemoattracting factors. Severe acute pancreatitis is a devastating disease associated with considerable morbidity and with mortality rates that can reach or exceed 20%. Most of the early deaths during severe pancreatitis are the result of inflammation-related complications including the systemic immune response syndrome and/or pancreatitis-associated lung injury, which clinically presents as the adult respiratory distress syndrome. The events responsible for regulating the inflammatory response in acute pancreatitis, and for coupling pancreatic injury with lung injury, are poorly understood but are of considerable clinical importance because interventions that prevent or limit those responses are likely to reduce the morbidity and mortality of the disease. Tpl2 is a proto-oncogene that has been shown to function as a MAP3K (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase) and, in this way, to play critical roles in certain inflammatory conditions. We now report the first studies that have examined the possible immunomodulatory effects of Tpl2 in acute pancreatitis. The results of our studies lead us to conclude that Tpl2 acts as a critical regulator of pancreatitis-associated inflammation by mediating the induction of chemoattracting chemokines and that it is Tpl2 expressed by a non-myeloid-derived pancreatic cell type (possibly the pancreatic acinar cell) that exerts this effect. Our findings also indicate that pancreatic inflammation and acinar cell injury/necrosis during pancreatitis are separable events that are not interdependent, as believed previously, and that the extent of lung inflammation as well as the extent of lung injury during pancreatitis correlates better with the severity of pancreatic inflammation than the extent of pancreatic injury/necrosis. All experiments were performed according to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Tufts-New England Medical Center. Tpl2-deficient (Tpl2-/-) mice were generated and their identity confirmed by PCR analysis as described previously (1Dumitru C.D. Ceci J.D. Tsatsanis C. Kontoyiannis D. Stamatakis K. Lin J.H.

Animals were housed in standard shoebox cages in a climate-controlled room with an ambient temperature of 23 ± 2 °C and a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. They were fed standard laboratory chow, given water ad libitum, and randomly assigned to experimental groups. Tpl2 -/- mice were back-crossed 10 times into a C57B6 background, and C57B6 mice served as the wild type control for each experiment. FD-4 (fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextran with an average mass of 4 kDa) was purchased from Sigma.

Recombinant MEK1 was purchased from Upstate (Temecula, CA). Caerulein (the decapeptide analog of cholecystokinin) and all other reagents were purchased from Sigma unless stated otherwise. Evaluation of Tpl2 Expression and Activation in the Pancreas during Secretagogue-induced Pancreatitis—The expression of Tpl2 in pancreas samples was evaluated by immunoblot analysis. To examine activation of Tpl2 we used a kinase assay employing recombinant MEK as a substrate (2Das S. Cho J. Lambertz I. Kelliher M.A. Eliopoulos A.G. Du K. Tsichlis P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23748-23757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Mouse pancreatic acini were pacified by incubating at 37 °C for 2 h to allow any signal transduction pathways activated during the process of preparation to return to base line. They were incubated with 100 nm caerulein and after 5 min were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing Complete® protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and phosphatase inhibitors (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). The cells were then lysed, the Tpl2 was immunoprecipitated, and its ability to phosphorylate exogenous MEK was determined by immunoblot analysis as described earlier (2Das S. Cho J. Lambertz I. Kelliher M.A. Eliopoulos A.G. Du K. Tsichlis P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23748-23757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Elicitation and Evaluation of Secretagogue-induced Experimental Pancreatitis—Secretagogue-induced pancreatitis (3Lampel M. Kern H.F. Virchows Arch. A Pathol. Anat. Histol. 1977; 373: 97-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) was elicited by administration of 12 hourly intraperitoneal injections of caerulein (50 μg/kg). At either 12 or 24 h after the initial caerulein injection, the animals were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation, and samples of pancreas, lung, and blood were rapidly harvested. Serum amylase activity was determined using 4,6-ethylidene (G7)-p-nitrophenyl (G1)-α1-d-maltoheptoside as the substrate as described previously (4Sharma A. Tao X. Gopal A. Ligon B. Andrade-Gordon P. Steer M.L. Perides G. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: G388-G395Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Pancreatic edema was quantitated by measuring pancreatic water content and expressing it as a percentage of tissue wet weight (5Perides G. Sharma A. Gopal A. Tao X. Dwyer K. Ligon B. Steer M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: G713-G721PubMed Google Scholar). The extent of acinar cell injury/necrosis on hematoxylin/eosin sections was evaluated by a morphologist without knowledge of the sample identity as described previously (4Sharma A. Tao X. Gopal A. Ligon B. Andrade-Gordon P. Steer M.L. Perides G. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: G388-G395Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Pancreatic inflammation (i.e. neutrophil sequestration within the pancreas) was quantitated by measurement of pancreatic myeloperoxidase activity as described by Haqqani et al. (6Haqqani A.S. Sandhu J.K. Birnboim H.C. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 273: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) by determining the bromide-enhanced chemiluminescence using a Lumimark microplate reader (Bio-Rad). Acinar cell apoptosis was quantitated using the terminal transferase-mediated dUTP-nick end labeling (TUNEL) technique (7Kaiser A.M. Saluja A.K. Sengupta A. Saluja M. Steer M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1295-C1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For this purpose, samples were counterstained with methyl green to permit counting of all nuclei, and apoptosis was expressed as the percent of total acinar cells showing positive staining. Elicitation and Evaluation of Duct Infusion-induced Experimental Pancreatitis—To elicit duct infusion-induced pancreatitis, the biliopancreatic duct of mice was cannulated with a 30-gauge blunted needle connected to a Harvard infusion apparatus, and the bile duct was clamped at the liver hilus. The pancreatic duct was then infused with sodium taurocholate (5% w/v, 10 μl) in methylene blue-containing saline at a rate of 5 μl/min (8van Acker G.J. Weiss E. Steer M.L. Perides G. Gastronenterology. 2006; 130: A-708Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours later samples of blood and pancreas were rapidly removed and used for quantitation of serum amylase activity, pancreatic edema, acinar cell injury/necrosis, and pancreatic inflammation employing techniques identical to those utilized with the secretagogue-induced model. Quantitation of Secretagogue-induced Pancreatitis-associated Lung Inflammation and Injury—Lung inflammation during secretagogue-induced pancreatitis was quantitated by measuring lung myeloperoxidase activity using the technique described above for measurement of pancreas myeloperoxidase activity. In this case, however, the lungs were first rinsed in situ by perfusion with 3 ml of saline instilled through a cannula placed into the pulmonary artery via the right ventricle. Lung injury during secretagogue-induced pancreatitis was evaluated by quantitating the leakage of intravenously administered FD-4 into the bronchoalveolar space (9Han X. Fink M.P. Uchiyama T. Yang R. Delude R.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: L259-L267Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Fifteen minutes before sacrifice, mice used for evaluation of pulmonary microvascular permeability were given 10 mg/kg FD-4 in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline by tail vein injection. After sacrifice, a 400-μl sample of blood was obtained by cardiac puncture with a heparinized needle, and all animals underwent a bronchoalveolar lavage. For this, the trachea was exposed, and a PE-240 cannula was inserted for a distance of 0.5 cm into the trachea via a small incision. With constant flow (0.1 ml/s), the lungs were lavaged twice with the same 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (37 °C). This wash process was repeated twice, and the combined wash fluid (BAL) (∼2.6 ml recovered) was kept on ice. The blood sample was centrifuged for 5 min at 2000 × g, and the plasma was removed. The presence of FD-4 in the BAL and the plasma (1% dilution) was measured using a Hitachi fluorimeter with excitation at 494 nm and emission at 518 nm. Background levels of fluorescence, determined in each group by measuring fluorescence in blood and BAL from animals that did not receive FD-4, were subtracted from the actual FD-4 readings. Lung micro-vascular permeability (i.e. injury) was expressed as the ratio of fluorescence units in BAL to fluorescence units in 1% plasma. Generation of Bone Marrow Chimeric Animals—Bone marrow donor animals were prepared by pretreating wild type and Tpl2-/- mice with 5-fluorouracil (160 mg/kg intravenously). Five days later, the animals were sacrificed, and bone marrow was collected from their harvested tibias and femurs as described (10Cui Y.Z. Hisha H. Yang G.X. Fan T.X. Jin T. Li Q. Lian Z. Ikehara S. Bone Marrow Transplant. 2002; 30: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Other wild type and Tpl2-/- mice destined to serve as bone marrow recipients were placed in sterile cages and given sterile food and water for 1 week prior to and 1 week following bone marrow transplantation. These recipient mice were then exposed to a total of 900-1000-cGy irradiation delivered in two treatment sessions separated by 4 h (i.e. lethal irradiation). Two hours later, a suspension of donor-derived bone marrow cells (200 μl) with added penicillin (100,000 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and amphotericin B (0.25 μg/ml) was administered by tail vein injection, and the animals were observed for either 2 weeks or 120 days to allow for bone marrow engraftment and restitution prior to subsequent experimentation. During that period of observation, animals (<5% of each group) failing to maintain and gain weight normally and those appearing unhealthy were euthanized. The adequacy of bone marrow restitution in the remaining animals was evaluated by measuring circulating blood hematocrit and quantitating the circulating leukocytes prior to induction of pancreatitis. Only animals with normal hematocrit and leukocyte counts were used in these subsequent experiments. Based upon studies performed by others (11Matute-Bello G. Lee J.S. Frevert C.W. Liles W.C. Sutlief S. Ballman K. Wong V. Selk A. Martin T.R. J. Immunol. Methods. 2004; 292: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), this lethal irradiation/bone marrow transplantation protocol would be expected to yield the following four groups of mice: (a) global wild type mice (i.e. mice with wild type myeloid and non-myeloid cells); (b) global Tpl2-/- mice (i.e. mice with Tpl2-/- myeloid and non-myeloid cells); (c) chimeric mice with wild type myeloid and Tpl2-/- non-myeloid cells; and (d) chimeric mice with Tpl2-/- myeloid and wild type non-myeloid cells. To confirm that, indeed, the appropriate chimeric animals had been generated, DNA was isolated from circulating leukocytes using the Qiagen kit (Qiagen, Studio City, CA) and PCR analysis of that DNA was performed using the Tpl2 forward (cttcagtcatcttaacactcaggc), the neomycin forward (ctgcacgagactagtgagacgtgc), and common reverse (ctgcttggaacttgctgttctagatg) primers. The Tpl2 primers give rise to a 180-bp product, and the neomycin forward and reverse primer give rise to a 480-bp product. The PCR was performed by combining all three primers in the mixture. Preparation and Assay of Pancreatic Fragments—After an overnight fast, Tpl2-/- and wild type mice weighing 20-25 g were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation, and the pancreas was rapidly removed. Pancreas fragments (12Jaffrey C. Eichenbaum D. Denham D.W. Norman J. Pancreas. 1999; 19: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) were prepared by injecting the excised pancreas with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F12 containing 15 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 mm sodium pyruvate, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The injected pancreas was cut into small (<0.2 mm3) pieces, which were washed three times with the same medium. The fragments were pacified by preincubation for 2 h at 37 °C while being shaken in the Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F12. The medium was replaced, and the fragments were then incubated at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 10-8 m caerulein for the indicated times. For studies of enzyme secretion, the net stimulated amylase secretion into the incubation medium over 30 min was calculated as the percent of total amylase content (13Powers R.E. Saluja A.K. Houlihan M.J. Steer M.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1986; 77: 1668-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For studies of intra-acinar cell activation of chymotrypsinogen and trypsinogen, fragments were exposed to increasing concentrations of caerulein (0-10-8 m) for 30 min and then homogenized, and enzyme activity was fluorimetrically quantitated using Boc-Gln-Ala-Arg-MCA (methyl-coumaryl-7-amide) as the substrate for trypsin (5Perides G. Sharma A. Gopal A. Tao X. Dwyer K. Ligon B. Steer M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: G713-G721PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of Proinflammatory Signaling Cascades—Nuclear and cytoplasmic protein extracts from pancreatic fragments were prepared as described (14Dingham J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9150) Google Scholar). JNK and MEK activation was evaluated by immunoblot analysis using the cytoplasmic protein extracts and antibodies raised against the phosphorylated forms of JNK (Thr183/Tyr185) and MEK1/2 (Ser217/Ser221) (Cell Signaling). After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, immunoreactive bands were visualized by quantitating chemiluminescence using a commercially available kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). AP-1 activation was evaluated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using the nuclear protein extracts, and a [32P]ATP-labeled 5′-cgcttgatgagtcagccggaa-3′ probe (Promega, Madison, WI) (15Blinman T.A. Gukovsky I. Mouria M. Zaninovic V. Livingston E. Pandol S.J. Gukovskaya A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1993-C2003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of NF-κB was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for p65 (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) on nuclear extracts prepared with the nuclear extract kit (Active Motif) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The degradation of IκB-α was evaluated by immunoblotting of cytoplasmic extracts using antibodies to IκB-α (Cell Signaling) (16Hietaranta A.J. Saluja A.K. Bhagat L. Singh V.P. Song A.M. Steer M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 388-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Evaluation of Neutrophil Chemoattractant Expression by Pancreas and Pancreatic Fragments Using Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR for the housekeeping gene ARP and the neutrophil chemoattractant genes MCP-1, MIP-2, and IL-6 was performed as described previously (17Perides G. Tao X. West N. Sharma A. Steer M.L. Gut. 2005; 54: 1461-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) using the following primers: ARP forward, 553aaactggagacaaggtggga, and reverse, 1021ttggttactttggcgggatta (489 bp); MCP-1 forward, 182ctcacctgctgctactcattc, and reverse, 499gcttgaggtggtgtggaaaa (318 bp); MIP-2 forward, 117accaaccaccaggctacaggg, and reverse, 461cagacagcgaggcacatcagg (345 bp); IL-6 forward, 33agttgccttcttgggactgat, and reverse, 421ctctggctttgtctttcttgt (389 bp). Analysis of Data—The results reported represent the mean ± S.E. of values obtained from multiple determinations in three or more experiments. The significance of the changes was evaluated by using Student's t test when the data consisted of only two groups or by analysis of variance when comparing three or more groups. A p value of ≤0.05 was considered as indicating a significant difference. In all of the figures, vertical bars denote S.E., and the absence of such bars indicates that the S.E. is too small to illustrate. Tpl2 Is Expressed in Mouse Pancreas and Tpl2 Is Activated after Supramaximal Secretagogue Stimulation—As shown in Fig. 1A, expression of Tpl2 could be detected when pancreas homogenates from wild type but not Tpl2-/- mice were subjected to immunoblotting using anti-Tpl2 antibodies. Because there are no good phosphospecific antibodies for Tpl2, we were not able to monitor Tpl2 activation by probing for phospho-Tpl2 during caerulein-induced pancreatitis. Tpl2 activation during pancreatitis, was therefore monitored via an in vitro kinase assay that employs the physiologic substrate for Tpl2 (MEK1) (3Lampel M. Kern H.F. Virchows Arch. A Pathol. Anat. Histol. 1977; 373: 97-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Tpl2 was first immunoprecipitated from acini that had been exposed to either buffer alone or to buffer containing 100 nm caerulein for 5 min. The immunoprecipitated Tpl2 was then incubated with recombinant MEK-1 and ATP for 10 min at room temperature, and the products of the kinase reaction were immunoblotted and probed with a phospho-MEK-specific antibody. We found that Tpl2 immunoprecipitated from acini incubated with caerulein phosphorylated recombinant MEK in the in vitro kinase assay but that Tpl2 immunoprecipitated from non-caerulein-stimulated acini was not able to phosphorylate MEK1 (Fig. 1B). Isolated acini from wild type and Tpl2-/- mice, however, did not differ in their responses to caerulein. Both types of acini secreted amylase in a biphasic manner, and when stimulated with supramaximal caerulein concentrations (>0.1 nm), intracellular trypsin activity was observed (Fig. 1, C and D). Genetic Ablation of Tpl2 Reduces Pancreatic Inflammation without Altering the Magnitude of Hyperamylasemia, Edema, or Acinar Cell Injury/Necrosis during Secretagogue-induced Pancreatitis—Pancreatic edema (Fig. 2A), acinar cell injury/necrosis (Fig. 2B), and pancreatic myeloperoxidase activity (i.e. inflammation) (Fig. 2C) were all increased 12 and 24 h after the start of supramaximal secretagogue stimulation in wild type animals and, under these conditions, serum amylase activity was also increased (data not shown). Pancreatic edema (Fig. 2A), acinar cell injury/necrosis (Fig. 2B), and serum amylase activity (not shown) were also similarly increased 12 and 24 h after the start of caerulein administration to Tpl2-/- mice. In contrast, no caerulein-induced increase in pancreatic myeloperoxidase activity was observed 12 h after the start of caerulein administration to Tpl2-/- mice, and the increased myeloperoxidase activity observed 24 h after the start of caerulein administration to wild type animals was markedly attenuated when caerulein was administered to Tpl2-/- animals (Fig. 2C). Representative photomicrographs of pancreas sections obtained from both wild type and Tpl2-/- mice 24 h after the start of caerulein administration also indicate that Tpl2 ablation reduces caerulein-induced neutrophil sequestration within the pancreas without altering pancreatic edema or the extent of acinar cell injury/necrosis (Fig. 2D). Genetic Ablation of Tpl2 Does Not Alter the Mode of Acinar Cell Death during Secretagogue-induced Pancreatitis—On purely morphological grounds, the histological distinction between necrosis and apoptosis is imprecise, particularly when the inflammatory reaction has been altered. To determine whether Tpl2 ablation changes the mode of cell death during pancreatitis, studies were performed using the TUNEL staining technique (7Kaiser A.M. Saluja A.K. Sengupta A. Saluja M. Steer M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1295-C1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to quantitate acinar cell apoptosis during secretagogue-induced pancreatitis in wild type and Tpl2-/- mice. For these studies, the mice were given six, rather than 12, hourly injections of caerulein, because the extensive tissue injury noted at the later time made accurate quantitation of apoptosis using the TUNEL technique impossible. As shown in Fig. 2E, after six hourly injections of caerulein the fraction of TUNEL-positive acinar cells was not altered by Tpl2 ablation. Roughly 3-4% of acinar cells were TUNEL-positive in both Tpl2+/+ and Tpl2-/- mice. Genetic Ablation of Tpl2 Reduces Pancreatic Inflammation without Altering the Severity of Pancreatic Edema or Acinar Cell Injury/Necrosis during Duct Infusion-induced Pancreatitis—To exclude the possibility that the effects of Tpl2 ablation on pancreatitis might be model-specific and limited to the secretagogue-induced model, we also induced pancreatitis in wild type and Tpl2-/- mice by retrograde infusion of sodium taurocholate into the pancreatic duct. As shown in Fig. 2, F-H, the extent of pancreatic edema and acinar cell injury/necrosis is comparably increased when either wild type or Tpl2-/- mice are infused with sodium taurocholate, and a marked rise in pancreatic myeloperoxidase activity is observed when wild type mice are infused with sodium taurocholate. That duct infusion-induced rise in myeloperoxidase activity, however, is significantly blunted by Tpl2 ablation (Fig. 2H). Representative photomicrographs of samples taken from wild type and Tpl2-/- mice infused with sodium taurocholate also demonstrate that acinar cell injury/necrosis is similar in both groups but that sequestration of neutrophils within the pancreas is markedly reduced in Tpl2-/- mice (Fig. 2, I and J). Genetic Ablation of Tpl2 Reduces Lung Inflammation and Injury during Secretagogue-induced Pancreatitis—Previously reported studies indicate that intrapulmonary sequestration of neutrophils (i.e. lung inflammation) and an increase in pulmonary microvascular permeability (i.e. lung injury) are evident after 12 hourly injections of caerulein (18Yamanaka K. Saluja A.K. Brown G.E. Yamaguchi Y. Hofbauer B. Steer M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G23-G30PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of Tpl2 in coupling pancreatitis to lung inflammation and lung injury during secretagogue-induced pancreatitis, the effect of Tpl2 ablation on these phenomena were evaluated 12 and 24 h after the first of 12 caerulein injections. As shown in Fig. 3A, lung myeloperoxidase activity is increased 12 h after the first administration of caerulein to wild type animals and even further increased 24 h after the start of caerulein administration, but that increase in lung myeloperoxidase activity is significantly attenuated by genetic ablation of Tpl2. The leakage rate of intravenously administered FD-4 into the bronchoalveolar space was employed as a measure of pulmonary microvascular permeability (9Han X. Fink M.P. Uchiyama T. Yang R. Delude R.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: L259-L267Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and as shown in Fig. 3B, the rate of FD-4 leakage is significantly increased 12 h after the final administration of caerulein to wild type animals. In contrast, no significant increase in pulmonary microvascular permeability is noted in Tpl2-/- mice evaluated at the same time. Leakage of FD-4 is also increased 24 h after the start of caerulein administration to wild type mice but, again, no increase in Tpl2-/- mice is observed at that time. These observations indicate that Tpl2 ablation reduces both lung inflammation and lung injury during secretagogue-induced pancreatitis. Anti-inflammatory Effect of Tpl2 Ablation Is Mediated by Tpl2 Expression in Non-myeloid Cells—To determine whether the protection of the Tpl2-/- mice from pancreatic inflammation was due to the Tpl2 ablation in hematopoietic or pancreatic epithelial cells, we transplanted wild type and Tpl2-/- bone marrow into both wild type and Tpl2-/- recipient mice. This allowed us to generate chimeric animals with Tpl2 ablation confined to either myeloid or non-myeloid cells (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4, B and C, pancreatic inflammation during secretagogue-induced pancreatitis is markedly reduced in reconstituted global Tpl2-/- mice and in mice with Tpl2 ablation confined to non-myeloid cells, but it is not reduced in mice with Tpl2 ablation confined to myeloid cells. Similar results are observed when the Tpl2 chimeric animals were treated with caerulein either 2 weeks (Fig. 4C) or 120 days (Fig. 4D) after bone marrow transplantation. Genetic Ablation of Tpl2 Interferes with Caerulein-induced Activation of Proinflammatory Transcription Factors and Proinflammatory Kinases and with the Expression of Neutrophil Chemoattractants in the Pancreas—Our finding that Tpl2 ablation in a non-myeloid cell type reduces inflammatory responses during pancreatitis led us to hypothesize that, in wild type mice, Tpl2 might play a critical proinflammatory role in pancreatitis by regulating events leading to chemoattraction and activation of inflammatory cells to sites of pancreatic injury. To explore this possibility, we examined the effects of Tpl2 ablation on a variety of caerulein-induced pancreatic proinflammatory events under both in vivo and in vitro conditions. We found that genetic ablation of T"

The enzymatic defect results in the deposition of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) in the vascular endothelium. To better understand the underlying pathogenesis of Fabry disease, the caveolar lipid content of primary cultured mouse aortic endothelial cells isolated from α-Gal A null mice was measured. Lipid mass analysis revealed that the excessive Gb3 in cultured α-Gal A-deficient mouse aortic endothelial cells accumulated in endothelial plasma membrane caveolar fractions. The levels of glucosylceramide and lactosylceramide increased in parallel with Gb3 levels in an age-dependent manner, whereas globotetraosylceramide (Gb4) levels reached maximal levels by 6 months of age and then rapidly decreased at older ages. The levels of cholesterol enriched in caveolar membranes declined in parallel with the progressive deposition of Gb3. Depleting Gb3 with recombinant human α-Gal A protein or d-threo-ethylenedioxyphenyl-P4, an inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase, restored cholesterol in cultured α-Gal A-deficient mouse aortic endothelial cell caveolae. By contrast, recombinant human α-Gal A was less effective in normalizing the cholesterol content. These results demonstrate the caveolar accumulation of glycosphingolipids in an in vitro model of a lysosomal storage disease and raise the possibility that dynamic changes in the composition of plasma membrane lipid microdomains may mediate the endothelial dysfunction seen in Fabry disease. Cardiovascular complications, including stroke and myocardial infarction, result in premature mortality in patients with Fabry disease, an X-linked deficiency of α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A).

These results demonstrate the caveolar accumulation of glycosphingolipids in an in vitro model of a lysosomal storage disease and raise the possibility that dynamic changes in the composition of plasma membrane lipid microdomains may mediate the endothelial dysfunction seen in Fabry disease. Fabry disease is one of 42 recognized lysosomal storage disorders. Fabry disease results from the absence or decreased activity of the lysosomal hydrolase α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A). 2The abbreviations used are: α-Gal A, α-galactosidase A; Gb3, globotriaosylceramide; Gb4, globotetraosylceramide; MAEC, mouse aortic endothelial cell; d-t-EtDO-P4, d-threo-ethylenedioxyphenyl-2-palmitoylamino-3-pyrrolidinopropanol; FBS, fetal bovine serum; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; GlcCer, glucosylceramide; LacCer, lactosylceramide; HPTLC, high performance thin layer chromatography. α-Gal A is transmitted as an X-linked recessive gene (1Anderson W. Br. J. Dermatol. 1898; 10: 113Crossref Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 2Fabry J. Arch. Dermatol. Syphilis. 1898; 43: 187Crossref Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The lack of enzymatic activity of α-Gal A in Fabry patients leads to the progressive accumulation of glycolipids with α-galactosyl linkages, primarily globotriaosylceramide (Gb3). Gb3 accumulates in the lysosomes of numerous tissues throughout the body, most notably the vascular endothelium. Fabry disease is a systemic disorder and functionally affects the skin, eyes, kidney, heart, and autonomic nervous system. The premature mortality of affected patients, however, primarily occurs from cardiovascular catastrophes such as strokes and myocardial infarctions (3Desnick R.J. Wasserstein M.P. Adv. Nephrol. Necker. Hosp. 2001; 31: 317-339PubMed Google Scholar). Although it is well documented that cardiovascular abnormalities are the most common and predominant clinical manifestation of Fabry disease, the precise biological role of Gb3 deposition in the pathogenesis of the large vessel vasculopathy in Fabry disease remains unknown. The generation of knock-out mice lacking α-Gal A activity has provided a useful model for the study of the vasculopathy in Fabry disease (4Ohshima T. Murray G.J. Swaim W.D. Longenecker G. Quirk J.M. Cardarelli C.O. Sugimoto Y. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Brady R.O. Kulkarni A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2540-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Although these mice do not display a spontaneous vasculopathy, they exhibit a robust thrombotic response to oxidant-induced injury (5Eitzman D.T. Bodary P.F. Shen Y. Khairallah C.G. Wild S.R. Abe A. Shaffer-Hartman J. Shayman J.A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and accelerated atherosclerosis when bred on an apo-E1 null background (6Bodary P.F. Shen Y. Vargas F.B. Bi X. Ostenso K.A. Gu S. Shayman J.A. Eitzman D.T. Circulation. 2005; 111: 629-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In addition, these mice display impaired contraction to phenylephrine and impaired acetylcholine-stimulated vasorelaxation in their aortic rings. 3J. Park and J. A. Shayman, unpublished data. All three findings are age-dependent. Because these phenotypes are observed in either living mice or isolated vessels, establishing a mechanistic basis for the vasculopathy has been difficult. As an initial step in studying potential mechanisms, a method for growing primary cultures of aortic endothelial cells derived from the α-Gal A null mice was established (7Shu L. Murphy H.S. Cooling L.L. Shayman J.A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 2636-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These cells retain high levels of Gb3 and thus provide a potentially useful reagent for probing the Fabry phenotype. The vascular models established to date in the α-Gal A null mice are consistent with the presence of an endothelial signaling defect in nitric oxide generation. How an enzyme deficiency resulting in the lysosomal accumulation of Gb3 might result in the impairment in agonist-stimulated nitric oxide formation is unknown. Plasma membrane-associated glycosphingolipids have long been demonstrated to regulate the activity of signaling molecules, including receptor tyrosine kinases (8Bremer E.G. Hakomori S. Bowen-Pope D.F. Raines E. Ross R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6818-6825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Src kinases (9Shu L. Shayman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31419-31425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and phospholipase C (10Shu L. Lee L. Shayman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18447-18453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Receptor-mediated endocytosis is regulated by glycosphingolipids as well. However, little if any data exist demonstrating a cross-talk between lysosomes and plasma membrane signaling. Furthermore, with the exception of Niemann-Pick C disease, little data exist demonstrating the accumulation of sphingolipids outside of the lysosome in storage diseases. To evaluate whether the glycosphingolipid content in plasma membrane caveolar fractions is affected in the setting of lysosomal storage disease, aortic endothelial cells from α-Gal A null mice were studied. We report that absence of α-Gal A activity in mouse aortic endothelial cells (MAECs) results in the age-dependent accumulation of globo series glycosphingolipids in plasma membrane caveolin-associated lipid rafts. Reagents—Recombinant human α-Gal A enzyme (Fabrazyme®), produced in a Chinese hamster ovary mammalian cell expression system, was a kind gift from Genzyme Corp. (Cambridge, MA). d-threo-Ethylenedioxyphenyl-2-palmitoylamino-3-pyrrolidinopropanol (d-t-EtDO-P4) was synthesized in our laboratory as previously described (11Lee L. Abe A. Shayman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14662-14669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Endothelial cell growth supplement was purchased from BD Biosciences. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was obtained from America Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA). Collagen type I, collagenase type I, and Percoll were from Sigma-Aldrich. OptiPrep was purchased from Accurate Chemical & Scientific Corp. (Westburg, NY). All of the lipid internal standards were acquired from Matreya (Pleasant Gap, PA). Animals—C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). α-Gal A-knock-out mice with a 129SVJXC57BL/6 cross-breeding background were bred and maintained under standard protocols at the University of Michigan as previously described. The genotype of α-Gal A-deficient mice was confirmed by PCR analysis. The care and euthanasia of the mice was in accordance with the standards in “The Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” DHEW publication number (National Institutes of Health) 86-23, revised 1985. Cell Cultures—The primary MAECs were isolated from α-Gal A-knock-out and wild-type C57BL/6J mice, at ages from 1 to 8 months, by utilizing a non-mechanical and non-enzymatic method with minor modifications as described previously (7Shu L. Murphy H.S. Cooling L.L. Shayman J.A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 2636-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Penicillin, streptomycin, and fungizone significantly delayed endothelial cells growth from explanted aortic rings and were therefore omitted from RPMI plating medium. The outgrowth of endothelial cells from aortic rings was markedly facilitated within first 72 h in the absence of antibiotics. Aortic rings thus were discarded at culture day 3 to avoid the possible contamination of non-endothelial cell types (12Chen S.F. Fei X. Li S.H. Microvasc. Res. 1995; 50: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). After removing the aortic rings, cells were maintained in completed RPMI medium consisting of 20% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1× nonessential amino acid, 0.05 mg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.1 mg/ml heparin until confluent. Cell Treatments—Because high concentrations of serum (≥15%) in culture medium induced increased Gb3, the percentage of serum in medium was gradually reduced after cells were serially passaged. MAECs at passages 0 and 1 (P0 and P1) were grown in RPMI medium containing 20% FBS, and MAECs at P2 and P3 were cultured in 15% FBS-RPMI medium. MAECs at P4, only maintained in 10% FBS-RPMI medium in excess of 2 days, were used for experiments unless otherwise indicated. A stock solution of d-t-EtDO-P4 dissolved in 100% Me2SO was diluted with plain RPMI, and recombinant human α-Gal A was freshly reconstituted with plain RPMI medium just before use. Treated MAECs, maintained in 10% FBS-RPMI, were exposed to either 0.3 μm d-t-EtDO-P4 or 10 μg/ml recombinant human α-Gal A for 1 or 2 days before being harvested. Isolation of Caveolae—Caveolae were isolated from cultured MAECs using a detergent-free method that takes advantage of the unique buoyant density of caveolar membranes (13Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown in 150- × 25-mm dishes were collected by scraping in buffer A (0.25 m sucrose/20 mm Tricine/1 mm EDTA, pH 7.8). Whole cells were fractionated by homogenization, and plasma membrane fractions were separated by centrifugation in buffer A containing 30% Percoll. Caveolar membranes were further purified from plasma membrane fractions by centrifugation in a 20% to 10% OptiPrep linear gradient and concentrated by a second centrifugation in a 5% OptiPrep-Buffer A discontinuous gradient. A distinct opaque band of caveolar membrane in the 5% OptiPrep was collected for lipid extraction and mass analysis. Immunoblotting—The total protein concentration of each sample was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Sigma) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Equal amounts of fraction proteins were mixed with sample loading buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol (v/v), 2% SDS (w/v), and 0.003% bromphenol blue (w/v). Samples separated under non-reducing conditions were directly subjected to SDS-PAGE using a 6–13% gradient, and samples separated under reducing conditions were heated for 5 min at 90 °C in sample loading buffer containing 1.5% 2-mercaptoethanol before electrophoresis. The transferred nylon membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.6) containing 5% skimmed dry milk and 5% calf serum overnight, and probed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) against mouse caveolin 1 and 2. The primary antibodies were detected with goat anti-rabbit IgG and visualized with the ECL-plus system. Annexin II was detected with a mouse monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories, San Jose, CA). Lipid Extraction—The extraction of total cellular lipids followed a protocol as previously described by Shu et al. (14Shu L. Lee L. Chang Y. Holzman L.B. Edwards C.A. Shelden E. Shayman J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The caveolar membrane lipids were extracted from caveolar fractions with chloroform and methanol. A mono-phase was formed by the addition of chloroform and methanol to the caveolar membranes at a volume ratio of 1:2:0.8 (chloroform/methanol/caveolar fraction). After sonication in a bath sonicator for 15 min, caveolar proteins were precipitated from the mono-phase mixture by centrifugation at 2500 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was collected with a Pasteur pipette into a new glass tube, and organic and water dual phases were created by the addition of 4 ml of chloroform, 3 ml of methanol, and 4.2 ml of 0.9% NaCl solution. The sample was centrifuged at 1250 × g for 5 min. The upper aqueous phase was discarded. The lower organic phase was transferred into another new glass tube and extensively washed with chloroform, methanol, and 0.9% NaCl, at the theoretical ratio of 1:1:1 (v/v), four times to remove coextracted OptiPrep in caveolar lipids. The lipids in chloroform portion were dried under a stream of nitrogen and redissolved into chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). Lipid Analysis—Neutral glycosphingolipids were purified from crude whole cellular and caveolar membrane lipids by base and acid hydrolysis as described in detail (7Shu L. Murphy H.S. Cooling L.L. Shayman J.A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 2636-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were normalized for equal amounts of lipids using a total phospholipid assay with potassium phosphate monobasic as a standard (15Ames G.F. J. Bacteriol. 1968; 95: 833-843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A portion of the lipids (100 nmol of total phospholipid phosphate) was incubated with NaOH (0.21 m) in methanol at 37 °C for 1 h. After neutralization with HCl (0.25 m), the lipids in the chloroform phase were incubated with 0.05 m HCl/25 mm HgCl2 at 37 °C for 15 min. The extracted neutral lipids were then purified with methanol/30 mm EDTA (2:1.6, v/v) once and methanol/water (2:1.6, v/v) twice. The neutral glycosphingolipids Gb3, Gb4, GlcCer, and LacCer were analyzed with two successive solvent systems as previously reported (7Shu L. Murphy H.S. Cooling L.L. Shayman J.A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 2636-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Alternatively, GlcCer and LacCer were separated in a solvent system consisting of chloroform/methanol/water (65/25/4, v/v) and quantified by comparison to standard curves of authentic standards. Following development in 100 ml of chloroform/acetic acid (9:1, v/v) for 30 min, cholesterol and fatty acids in crude lipid extracts (50–100 nmol of total phospholipid phosphate) were identified from TLC plates by comparison to known standards run in parallel on the same plates. Statistics—The data from three separate experiments were pooled, analyzed by the Student test t, and expressed as mean ± S.E. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Mouse and other small animal aortic endothelial cells are resistant to isolation by enzymatic treatment. Therefore, an explanting procedure was employed to generate primary cultures of endothelial cells. This procedure provides an efficient and reliable technique for the isolation and cultivation of murine aortic endothelial cells. The experimental conditions were modified and optimized from those originally reported. The outgrowth of aortic endothelial cells was enhanced by the removal of antibiotics from the plating medium. The contamination of other mixed cell types, including fibroblasts, was minimized by removal of the aortic rings prior to the time at which non-endothelial cells started to migrate from the aortic rings. The purity of the endothelial cell population was controlled by the addition of heparin, which promoted markedly endothelial cells growth by stimulating the activation of endothelial cell growth factor (16Thornton S.C. Mueller S.N. Levine E.M. Science. 1983; 222: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar) and induced an anti-proliferative effect on smooth muscle cells by blocking the activity of platelet-derived growth factor (17Clowes A.W. Karnovsky M.J. J. Surg. Res. 1978; 24: 161-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The purity of the glycosphingolipid-enriched plasma membrane fractions, from MAECs obtained from wild-type and α-Gal A-knock-out mouse aortas, was evaluated (Fig. 1). Caveolin 1, caveolin 2, and annexin II were highly enriched in the membrane fractions from both wild-type and null endothelial cells. Multimeric caveolins 1 and 2 were highly enriched in both wild-type and null cells. The levels of multimeric caveolin 1 were lower in the knock-out cells and decreased with age. The opposite trend was observed for caveolin 2. Annexin II levels were consistently higher in the raft fractions recovered from the knock-out cells. The effect of serum on the induction of Gb3 in wild-type cultured cells was eliminated by gradually reducing the concentration of serum in the culture medium. Previously we demonstrated that total cellular Gb3 was absent in wild-type endothelial cells (7Shu L. Murphy H.S. Cooling L.L. Shayman J.A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 2636-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). After 4 days of culture in 10% FBS-RPMI medium, no Gb3 was detected in caveolar lipids extracted from wild-type MAECs as well (Fig. 2A, lane 1). However, under these experimental conditions, the presence of Gb3 in cultured α-Gal A-knock-out MAECs persisted and progressively increased in caveolar membrane lipids (Fig. 2A, lanes 2–4) as well as in total cellular lipids (Fig. 2B) as a function of the age of the mice. The Gb3 accumulation in α-Gal A-knock-out MAECs was retained in the cultured cells up to 5 passages without decrement (data not shown). The Gb3 content did decrease 10–20% at later passages (P6–P8). By mass analysis, it was observed that the accumulation of Gb3 in caveolar membranes isolated from cultured α-Gal A-knock-out MAECs was age-dependent (Fig. 2B) but gender-independent (data not shown). At earlier ages (≤2 months) the Gb3 levels in caveolar membranes were comparable to levels measured as total cellular lipids. With increasing age (≥5 months), however, higher Gb3 was found in caveolar membranes when normalized as recovered phospholipid phosphate. The accumulation of Gb3 in caveolar membranes reached a plateau in cells from 5- to 6-month-old mice, whereas the plateau for total cellular Gb3 was observed in cells obtained from 4-month-old mice. The surprisingly large increase of Gb3 in caveolar membranes raised a possibility that the content of other caveolar lipids, normally enriched within caveolar membranes, would change as well. GlcCer and LacCer are two biosynthetic precursors of Gb3. The levels of GlcCer in total cellular and caveolar membrane lipids of wild-type and α-Gal A-knock-out MAECs were compared by HPTLC charred with 8% cupric sulfate in 8% phosphoric acid (Fig. 3). There was no statistical difference in the levels of GlcCer between in total cellular (Fig. 3A) and in caveolar membrane lipids (Fig. 3B) isolated from cultured wild-type MAECs. However, the levels of GlcCer in caveolar membrane lipids extracted from cultured α-Gal A-knock-out MAECs significantly changed in an age-dependent (Fig. 3B) and gender-independent manner (data not shown). The levels of GlcCer in both total cellular and caveolar membrane lipids of MAECs from younger Fabry mice (2 months of age) were markedly lower compared with wild-type cells. With increasing age the levels of GlcCer in the caveolar membranes of Fabry MAECs increased linearly. By 8 months of age, the GlcCer level in caveolar lipids of α-Gal A-knock-out MAECs was 25% higher than in those of wild-type MAECs. A plateau point for GlcCer accumulation in caveolar lipids of α-Gal A-knock-out MAECs could not be documented even in cells obtained from 8-month-old mice. The levels of LacCer in total cellular (Fig. 4A) and caveolar membranes (Fig. 4B) were measured using a solvent system that consisted of chloroform/methanol/water (65/25/4, v/v), and determined according to a standard curve generated from known amounts of LacCer. Compared with stably expressed LacCer in caveolar membranes of wild-type MAECs, the levels of LacCer in caveolar membranes of α-Gal A-knock-out MAECs increased with age and paralleled Gb3 accumulation. The linear increase of caveolar LacCer in α-Gal A-knock-out MAECs also did not reach a plateau at 8-month-old Fabry mice. Differences in globotetraosylceramide (Gb4), a downstream biosynthetic product of Gb3, were also observed when measured in the caveolar lipids in cultured Fabry MAECs in comparison to whole cell Gb4 (Fig. 5). The pattern of Gb4 change was different than that observed with GlcCer and LacCer. Gb4 increased in caveolar lipids of α-Gal A-knock-out MAECs and reached maximal levels in cells from 6-month-old mice. However, the amount of Gb4 in the caveolar lipids from MAECs obtained from Fabry mice older than 6 months decreased to wild-type levels, implicating the induction of an alternative pathway for metabolism. It is well established that caveolae lipids not only are enriched in glycosphingolipids, but also in cholesterol. Thus, the levels of cholesterol in caveolar membrane and total cellular lipids of Fabry MAECs were compared with the levels of cholesterol in wild-type MAECs. With progressive deposition of Gb3 in total cellular and caveolar lipids, cholesterol levels in both lipid samples decreased gradually (Fig. 6A) as detected with a solvent system containing 90% chloroform and 10% acetic acid (v/v). At 8 months of age, the amount of cholesterol in the caveolae of α-Gal A-knock-out MAECs was 63% lower compared with that in caveolae of 2-month-old cells (Fig. 6B). The enrichment of fatty acids in caveolar lipids of cultured MAECs was an unexpected finding (Fig. 6A, lanes 6 and 7). However, most of the fatty acid increase was no longer observed in the caveolar lipids of cultured MAECs isolated from Fabry mice ≥6 months of age (Fig. 6A, lanes 8 and 9). We previously reported that two pharmacological agents, recombinant human α-Gal A protein and the GlcCer synthase inhibitor d-t-EtDO-P4, depleted Gb3 from total cellular lipids of cultured α-Gal A-knock-out MAECs with different efficiencies (7Shu L. Murphy H.S. Cooling L.L. Shayman J.A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 2636-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this study, the effects of these two pharmacological strategies on the depletion of Gb3 present in caveolae of α-Gal A-knock-out MAECs were compared (Fig. 7A). The clearance of excessive Gb3 from caveolae by d-t-EtDO-P4 was readily observed. A single treatment with 0.3 μm d-t-EtDO-P4 for 24 h was as effective as 1 or 1.5 μm d-t-EtDO-P4 for 2 days in eliminating caveolar Gb3, and remained effective even when removed from the culture medium for 2 days (Fig. 7B). By contrast, enzymatic depletion of Gb3 with recombinant human α-Gal A protein was dose- and time-dependent. Increasing the concentration of enzyme from 10 to 60 μg/ml for 1 day reduced the caveolar Gb3 levels from 67% to 95% (data not shown). However, a rebound of Gb3 was observed in caveolar lipids when no further enzyme was given for 2 days (Fig. 7B). The cholesterol levels in caveolar and total cellular lipids of treated α-Gal A-knock-out MAECs were also examined (Fig. 8A). Cultured α-Gal A-knock-out MAECs were exposed to either recombinant human α-Gal A or d-t-EtDO-P4 for 2 days. Removing Gb3 by d-t-EtDO-P4 restored cholesterol levels on both total cellular and caveolar lipids under all treatment conditions (Fig. 8B). However, only partial recovery of the cholesterol content with α-Gal A treatment was observed. Caveolar cholesterol levels were also measured after a 2-day incubation with a single dose of α-Gal A (10 μg/ml) or d-t-EtDO-P4 (0.3 μm) followed by replacement with α-Gal A- and d-t-EtDO-P4-free media. The cells were then cultured for another 2 days (Fig. 8C). The caveolar cholesterol levels remained comparable to those measured in the wild-type cells in Fabry MAECs previously treated with d-t-EtDO-P4 but decreased within 2 days in those cells treated with α-Gal A. Over 40 lysosomal storage diseases have been identified. Fourteen of these disorders involve the accumulation of sphingolipids. Duve (18Duve C. Science. 1975; 189: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) recognized that these diseases often resulted from the failure of lysosomal enzymes to function properly. Subsequently, it has been recognized that the molecular basis for lysosomal storage could result from the defective transport or lysosomal enzymes, defective lysosomal membrane transporters, and the lack of activator proteins that regulate lysosomal hydrolase activity (19Futerman A.H. van Meer G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 554-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). While much is known about the proximate molecular and genetic basis of these disorders, how individual diseases result in cellular and organ pathophysiology is significantly less well understood. Indeed, it has been difficult to understand how the common finding of intralysosomal metabolite accumulation results in such a wide range of phenotypes among the 40 different disorders. Several hypotheses have been considered to explain the cellular pathology of lysosomal storage disease. These hypotheses include derangements in lysosomal stability, aberrant intracellular trafficking, altered gene expression with the activation of secondary biochemical pathways, and defects in intracellular signaling. An alternative hypothesis, namely that sphingolipids accumulate outside of the lysosomes, has received considerably less attention. Under this hypothesis, the cellular pathology results from the presence of abnormal levels of sphingolipids in membrane compartments external to the lysosome affecting the regulation of signaling processes, which are dependent on the local sphingolipid composition and levels. Sphingolipids in addition to cholesterol are important components of caveolin-associated lipid rafts. Not only are these subsets of lipid rafts highly enriched in sphingomyelin and glycosphingolipids, but the endosomal trafficking of these rafts appears to be specifically regulated. For example, fluorescently tagged sphingolipids are recycled to the cell surface through early endosomes rather than cycled to late endosomes of lysosomes (20Puri V. Watanabe R. Singh R.D. Dominguez M. Brown J.C. Wheatley C.L. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 535-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Late endosomes or vacuoles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae contain low amounts of sphingolipids and ergosterol (21Zinser E. Daum G. Yeast. 1995; 11: 493-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). These and other findings suggest that sphingolipids are not stochastically sorted to lysosomes but, rather, the amounts of caveolin-associated lipids that enter the late endosome and lysosomes are limited and regulated. These findings led Simons and Gruenberg (22Simons K. Gruenberg J. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 459-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) to postulate that the capacity or tolerance of late endosomes for raft lipids is limited. Excess lipid accumulation in these organelles results in a “traffic jam” with secondary cellular changes. These secondary changes include mistargeting of caveolar proteins, alterations in lysosomal membrane function and activity, and perturbations in lysosome biogenesis and autophagy. Independent of these abnormalities, the effects of aberrant changes in sphingolipid content within caveolae should also be considered. Glycosphingolipids have long been recognized as important mediators of cell signaling responses at the plasma membrane. The activity of receptor tyrosine kinases, including the insulin receptor and epidermal growth factor receptor, is directly modulated by the associated ganglioside content. The activities of phospholipase Cγ-1 and a variety of Src kinases can be similarly demonstrated to be dramatically affected by genetic or pharmacologic manipulations of cellular glycosphingolipids (9Shu L. Shayman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31419-31425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 10Shu L. Lee L. Shayman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18447-18453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that these changes may be mediated by the direct binding of tetraspanins to membrane glycosphingolipids as part of a larger structure termed a glycosynapse (23Todeschini A.R. Dos Santos J.N. Handa K. Hakomori S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8123-8133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). These observations beg an important question, namely, do specific glycosphingolipids and changes in their relative concentrations regulate specific signaling phenomena? In the present study we have studied the plasma membrane caveolin-associated lipid raft content in endothelial cells of wild-type and α-Gal A null mice. These cells may represent a useful model of Fabry disease, because they retain high levels of Gb3 even following serial passages. Importantly, we observed that the caveolar content of Gb3 is increased in the knock-out cells compared with wild-type cells. The change in Gb3 content is increased as a function of the age of the mice. Secondary changes are also observed in the levels of the Gb3 precursors GlcCer and LacCer. Caveolin-associated levels of these neutral glycosphingolipids are below those of the wild-type cells and increase with age. By 6–8 months of age the levels of these glycolipids are equal to or in excess of those in the wild-type cells. At this point in time, the levels of cholesterol decrease proportionately. By contrast, no change in sphingomyelin levels is observed. The caveolar content of glycosphingolipids also changed following pharmacological treatment. Treatment of Fabry endothelial cells with α-Gal A and d-t-EtDO-P4 were comparably effective in lowering the Gb3 content of the raft fractions. These data suggest that the turnover of Gb3 is sufficiently rapid to respond to acute changes in synthesis or degradation. The changes in glycosphingolipid content differed, however, between the two agents. The effect of d-t-EtDO-P4 persisted for a considerably longer period of time compared with α-Gal A upon withdrawal of drug. The response to the two agents differed in additional potentially important respects. α-Gal A treatment resulted only in the reduction of Gb3. By contrast, GlcCer, LacCer, and G4 levels decreased when the GlcCer synthase inhibitor was used. Finally, although both agents partially reversed the loss of cholesterol in the caveolae, EtDO-P4 was more effective than α-Gal A in normalizing the cholesterol content and the effect was more persistent. Collectively, these data suggest that both the composition and content of raft-associated lipids change dynamically in the endothelium of the α-Gal A null mouse. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a change in plasma membrane caveolin-associated glycosphingolipids in a lysosomal storage disorder. However, the non-glycosphingolipid lipid composition in detergent-resistant membrane fractions has been studied in another mouse model of lysosomal storage disease, Niemann-Pick C. In a recent study the cholesterol content of plasma membranes was observed to be increased from hepatocytes of NPC–/– mice. The increased cholesterol impaired insulin signaling and was restored following cholesterol depletion (24Ikonen E. Vainio S. Sci. STKE 2005,. 2005; : pe3Google Scholar). In other studies cholesterol levels have been reported to be increased, decreased, or unchanged (25Dahl N.K. Reed K.L. Daunais M.A. Faust J.R. Liscum L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4889-4896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Koike T. Ishida G. Taniguchi M. Higaki K. Ayaki Y. Saito M. Sakakihara Y. Iwamori M. Ohno K. Biochim. Biophys.

In summary, this study demonstrates the age-dependent change of Gb3 and related globo series glycosphingolipids in the caveolin-associated lipid raft fractions of plasma membranes from the α-galactosidase A null mouse endothelial cells. The changes are rapid, complex, and reversible by agents that either block Gb3 synthesis or promote its degradation. The complexity of these changes will be an important variable in fully understanding the basis of the vascular pathology of Fabry disease and the pathophysiology of lysosomal storage diseases more generally."

To identify new Freud-1 gene targets, data base mining for Freud-1 recognition sequences was done. A highly homologous intronic element (D2-DRE) was identified in the human dopamine-D2 receptor (DRD2) gene, and the role of Freud-1 in regulating the gene at this site was assessed. Recombinant Freud-1 bound specifically to the D2-DRE, and a major protein-D2-DRE complex was identified in nuclear extracts that was supershifted using Freud-1-specific antibodies. Endogenous Freud-1 binding to the D2-DRE in cells was detected using chromatin immunoprecipitation. The D2-DRE conferred strong repressor activity in transcriptional reporter assays that was dependent on the Freud-1 recognition sequence. In three different human cell lines, the level of Freud-1 protein was inversely related to DRD2 expression. Knockdown of endogenous Freud-1 using small interfering RNA resulted in an up-regulation of DRD2 RNA and binding sites, demonstrating a crucial role for Freud-1 in DRD2 regulation. A previously uncharacterized single nucleotide A/G polymorphism (rs2734836) was located adjacent to the D2-DRE and conferred allele-specific Freud-1 binding and repression, with the major G-allele having reduced activity. These studies demonstrate a key role for Freud-1 to regulate DRD2 expression and provide the first mechanistic insights into its transcriptional regulation.

Dopamine-D2 receptors function as both pre-synaptic autoreceptors and post-synaptic receptors, and play key roles in regulating dopaminergic neurotransmission. Increased levels of dopamine-D2 receptors or dopaminergic hyperactivity have been implicated in schizophrenia (1Abi-Dargham A. Rodenhiser J. Printz D. Zea-Ponce Y. Gil R. Kegeles L.S. Weiss R.

A polymorphism in the putative DRD2 promoter confers decreased transcriptional activity and has been negatively associated with schizophrenia (7Arinami T. Gao M. Hamaguchi H. Toru M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). However, the transcriptional mechanisms for regulation of the human DRD2 gene have yet to be elucidated. To identify new transcriptional regulators in the nervous system, we previously characterized the serotonin-1A (5-HT1A) receptor promoter region and identified a novel dual repressor element (DRE) that negatively regulates its expression (8Lemonde S. Rogaeva A. Albert P.R. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 857-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 9Ou X.M. Jafar-Nejad H. Storring J.M. Meng J.H. Lemonde S. Albert P.R. J. Biol.

The DRE consists of adjacent and partially overlapping repressor elements: 5′-repressor element (FRE; major regulator in neuronal cells) and 3′-repressor element (9Ou X.M. Jafar-Nejad H.

Analysis of DRE-binding proteins revealed that a novel protein, Freud-1 (Five prime repressor under dual repression-binding protein-1)/CC2D1A (Coiled-coil and C2 Domain containing 1A) binds to and represses the 5-HT1A receptor gene through the FRE (10Ou X.M.

In 5-HT1A-expressing raphe cells, inactivation of Freud-1 by calcium-calmodulin kinase or using antisense to Freud-1 leads to up-regulation of 5-HT1A receptor expression. Thus, Freud-1 helps to establish the basal level of 5-HT1A receptor expression in raphe neurons. Freud-1 is evolutionarily conserved and contains a variable number of Drosophila melanogaster 14 repeats, a helix-loop-helix, and a C2 (protein kinase C-conserved region 2) calcium-phospholipid binding domain (10Ou X.M.

Neuroscientist. 2004; 10: 575-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Recently, linkage analysis in patients with autosomal recessive non-syndromic mental retardation has revealed a deletion mutation that eliminates exons 14–16 of the CC2D1A/Freud-1 gene and encodes a truncated protein lacking the fourth Drosophila melanogaster 14, helix-loop-helix, and C2 domains (12Basel-Vanagaite L.

The C2 domain is essential for Freud-1 DNA binding and repressor functions, implying that the mutated Freud-1 protein is non-functional (10Ou X.M. Lemonde S. Jafar-Nejad H. Bown C.D. Goto A.

Neurosci. Res. 2007; (., in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, data base mining identified a highly conserved DRE sequence in the second intron of the DRD2 gene (D2-DRE) and two proximal and previously uncharacterized polymorphisms. We investigated the allele-dependent binding and repression of the D2-DRE by Freud-1 and the role of Freud-1 in regulation of dopamine-D2 receptor expression. We find that Freud-1 functions as a transcriptional regulator of the human DRD2 gene. Plasmid Constructs—Cloning of mouse Freud-1 (mFreud-1; NCBI accession ABC56419) into pET30A and pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) has been previously described (10Ou X.M. Lemonde S. Jafar-Nejad H. Bown C.D.

All plasmids were purified by maxiprep kit (Sigma), quantified spectrophotometrically, and verified by ethidium bromide staining. For reporter assays, triplicate samples were extracted with 200 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega), supernatants were collected, assayed for luciferase activity using the Promega Luciferase Assay system using a 1250 luminometer (Bio Orbit, Turku, Finland), and normalized to β-galactosidase activity using 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d galactoside (Sigma) conversion to methylumbelliferone (λex = 350 nm, λem = 450 nm), and activity was normalized to that of pGL3-Basic vector (Promega).

Cells were harvested, and mFreud-1 was purified by TALON metal affinity resin (Promega). In vitro transcription/translation of mFreud-1 was performed using TNT® Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate system (Promega) with 1 μg of pcDNA3-mFreud-1. Electrophoretic Mobility Gel Shift Assay (EMSA)—Complementary D2-DRE oligonucleotides used for reporter constructs were annealed and end-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using 2.5 units of Klenow (New England Biolabs, Pickering, ON) and purified over Sephadex G-50 column (GE HealthCare). Nuclear extracts (5 μg/sample), in vitro transcribed/translated mFreud-1 (5 μl/sample), or purified mFreud-1 (4 μg/sample) was preincubated with or without double-stranded competitor DNA: D2-DRE(A), D2-DRE(G), D2-DRE(m3), E2F (5′-tatagtgtactctactattctgctc-3′), 5-HT DRE (5′-cggcataagcaagcccttattgcacagagc-3′).

Polyclonal rabbit anti-human Freud-1Long antibody (anti-hFreud-1; 1:20,000) was raised (Cedarlane, Hornby, ON) against bacterially expressed and purified (nickel nitrilotriacetic acid beads; Qiagen, Mississauga, ON) S-/His-tagged hFreud-1Long (pTriEX4 vector; Novagen, Madison, WI) as antigen (NCBI accession number Q6P1N0). Anti-CC2D1A antibody was used in CHIP assays (1:1000 dilution) and in supershift EMSAs in the presence or absence of its specific blocking peptide (Bethyl Laboratories), which was preincubated with the antibody overnight at 4 °C. In addition, anti-β-actin (1:20,000; Sigma), anti-cRaf (1:3,000; BD Biosciences), and anti-histone H1 (1:1,000; Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) were used as controls.

Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C followed by horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit (1:2000; New England Biolabs) or anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:2000; Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) and tertiary BM chemiluminescence blotting substrate (Roche Applied Science). Specificity of anti-hFreud-1 antibody was assessed by Western blot and immunoprecipitation analyses, where a ∼130-kDa band was identified only with immunized serum (supplemental Fig. S1) and verified by mass spectrometry (Ottawa Genomics Innovation Center Proteomics Facility; data not shown). CHIP assays were performed as described in Upstate protocol (Upstate Biotechnology) with modifications. Cells were washed 3× with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4), cross-linked for 15 min at room temperature in PBS supplemented with 1 mm MgCl2 and 1% formaldehyde (v/v), rinsed 3× with PBS, and lysed (18Nowak D.E. Tian B. Brasier A.R. Biotechniques. 2005; 39: 715-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Shearing of genomic DNA (100–400-bp fragments; data not shown) was done by sonication on ice with the addition of 212–300-μm-diameter glass beads (Sigma) (19Weinmann A.S. Bartley S.M. Zhang T. Zhang M.Q. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6820-6832Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) 15× at the setting of 7 for 20 s time (60 Sonic Dismembrator, Fisher). De-cross-linking was done overnight at 65 °C followed by 1 h of digestion with proteinase K (Sigma) and phenol/chloroform extraction. The results were analyzed using quantitative PCR (QPCR; Rotor-Gene RG-3000; Corbett Life Science, Sydney, Australia) with two sets of oligonucleotide primers; one designed to amplify a 124-bp (5′-ctactgtgggcattgcactttat-3′ and 5′-tgaacttggccacgttacatg-3′) and the other to amplify a 206-bp region (5′-ccttccagggcagcagcttagtag-3′ and 5′-ataagacatctactgtgggcattg-3′) containing D2-DRE. The PCR reaction was performed using qTaq™ DNA polymerase mix (Clontech), and amplification cycles were 92 °C for 10 min, 92 °C for 30 s, 54 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, 84 °C for 20 s (25 cycles), and terminated at 72 °C for 10 min. The results were visualized using SYBR Green (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) incorporation and verified on agarose gel. Immunoprecipitation—Cells were rinsed 2× with ice-cold PBS and lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 mm EDTA) supplemented with 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) on ice for 30 min followed by sonication (60 Sonic Dismembrator, Fisher) once at the setting of 3 for 10 s. Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was diluted 10× with PBS/protease inhibitor mixture. The lysates were precleared with 40 μl of protein A-agarose beads (GE HealthCare) with rotation at 4 °C for 30 min and combined with anti-hFreud-1 antibody (1:1000) overnight at 4 °C. The following day 20 μl of protein A-agarose beads were added and incubated (2 h, 4 °C). The supernatant was then collected, and the beads were washed with 1 ml of NETIN buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) 3× with gentle inversion and spun for 10 s at 1000 × g. The beads were then boiled for 5 min in 2× loading buffer (200 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 0.8% SDS, 1.6% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.04% bromphenol blue, 4% glycerol) and subjected to Western blot analysis. Nuclear and Cytosolic Fractionation and siRNA—Nuclear/cytosolic fractionation was performed as previously described (20Czesak M. Lemonde S. Peterson E.A. Rogaeva A. Albert P.R. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 1864-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed on ice with extraction buffer (10 mm KCl, 10 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.6, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm spermidine, 0.15 mm spermine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) for 10 min. The resultant nuclei were washed (50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.6, 25% glycerin, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm spermidine, 0.15 mm spermine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× protease inhibitor mixture), lysed with nuclear extraction buffer (500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.6, 25% glycerin, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm spermidine, 0.15 mm spermine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× protease inhibitor mixture), and analyzed for success of fractionation and the presence of Freud-1 by Western blot analysis. Stealth siRNA targeting hFreud-1 (5′-ggcgcucuaucagacagcaauugaa-3′) and a scrambled negative control (5′-ggcucucuaagagacaacuugcgaa-3′) were designed online (Invitrogen). A7 and SK-N-AS cells were transfected using HiPerFect (Qiagen) transfection reagent and Y-79 cells using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) for Y-79, with a final siRNA concentration of 20 and 33 nm, respectively. Transfection efficiency control was performed with BLOCK-iT™ Fluorescent Oligo (Invitrogen) demonstrating ∼90% efficiency (data not shown). The cells were analyzed 72 h post-transfection. Ligand Binding Assay—Dopamine-D2 receptor sites were measured by specific binding of the antagonist [3H]spiperone (119 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were prepared from A7, SK-N-AS, and Y-79 cells as previously described (21Kushwaha N. Harwood S.C. Wilson A.M. Berger M. Tecott L.H. Roth B.L. Albert P.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 1518-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Membranes were diluted with ⅕ TME buffer (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm EDTA) supplemented with 0.1% ascorbic acid and 9000 cpm of [3H]spiperone in the presence or absence of apomorphine (10–6 m; Sigma). After 30 min incubation at room temperature, the samples were filtered through GF/C glass microfiber filters (Whatman, Clifton, NJ) and washed 3× with 5 ml of ice-cold 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4. The filters were then combined with 3 ml of scintillation fluid (InterSciences Inc., Markham, ON), and radioactivity was detected using the Packard TRI-CARB 2100TR scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The receptor binding was normalized to protein concentration determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Preparation of RNA, cDNA, and QPCR Analysis—The RNA was isolated using TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen) followed by DNase treatment with TURBO DNA-free™ kit (Ambion, Austin, TX), and cDNA was generated using the Cells-to-cDNA™ II kit (Ambion). The resulting cDNA was analyzed for glyseraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; control) and dopamine-D2 expression levels by QPCR analysis and SYBR Green detection method. More specifically, amplification cycles were 95 °C for 3 min, 92 °C for 20 s, 60 °C for 20 s, 72 °C for 20 s (40 cycles), and terminated at 72 °C for 15 min performed with PCR primers (IDT, Coralville, IA) for human GAPDH (5′-cgacagtcagccgcatcttctttt-3′ and 5′-gcgcccaatacgaccaaatcc-3′) and human dopamine-D2 receptor cDNA (5′-tcgtcgccacactggtcatgc-3′ and 5′-gcttggagctgtagcgcgtattgta-3′). The resulting PCR products were analyzed as previously described, (22Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (127155) Google Scholar) using the 2–ΔΔCT method, validated by analyzing ΔCT (CT,hFreud-1 – CT,GAPDH), which produced a slope of 0.0633 (slope < 0.1 validates the use of this method). In addition, PCR products were verified on agarose gel (data not shown). Identification and Function of the D2-DRE—To identify new DNA elements recognized by Freud-1, a Blast Search was performed using the rat 5-HT1A 3′DRE sequence, a known Freud-1 binding site (9Ou X.M. Jafar-Nejad H. Storring J.M. Meng J.H. Lemonde S. Albert P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8161-8168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A highly homologous sequence was recognized in the second intron of the DRD2 (D2-DRE; position 12432–12461, GenBank™ AF050737). The D2-DRE displayed strong nucleotide identity (80.6%) to the rat 5-HT1A 3′DRE (Fig. 1A), with highest homology (95.7%) within the FRE, required for Freud-1 protein binding (9Ou X.M. Jafar-Nejad H. Storring J.M. Meng J.H. Lemonde S. Albert P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8161-8168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the level of interspecies homology of mammalian D2-FRE sites was similar to that between the functional FREs of human and rat 5-HT1A receptor genes (Fig. 1B), suggesting a conserved role for this site. Because of its conserved sequence, the D2-DRE was examined further as a potential Freud-1 regulatory element of the DRD2 gene. To determine whether nuclear proteins bind to the D2-DRE, nuclear extracts from HEK293 or dopamine-D2 receptor-positive A7 cells and labeled complementary D2-DRE oligonucleotides were co-incubated and examined by EMSA (Fig. 2A). In both cell types a major protein-D2-DRE complex was observed (arrow) that was competed with excess unlabeled D2-DRE double-stranded oligonucleotides but not unrelated double-stranded E2F primers. Mutant D2-DRE(m3) double-stranded oligonucleotides incorporating mutations shown to reduce Freud-1 binding to the 5-HT1A 3′DRE (9Ou X.M. Jafar-Nejad H. Storring J.M. Meng J.H. Lemonde S. Albert P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8161-8168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) did not compete for the major protein-D2-DRE complex compared with the nonmutated D2-DRE. The DNA sequence specificity of the major protein-D2-DRE complex is consistent with the binding of Freud-1 to the D2-DRE. The transcriptional regulatory activity of the D2-DRE was examined using luciferase reporter assays. A7 and HEK293 cells transiently transfected with D2-DRE-containing plasmid displayed reduced luciferase activity compared with vector-transfected cells, indicating that the D2-DRE confers repressor activity (Fig. 2B). Similarly, strong repressor activity was observed when D2-DRE was placed downstream of the SV40 promoter (data not shown), supporting its role as a position-independent repressor element. The D2-DRE(m3) mutant construct lacked significant activity in A7 cells and marginally reduced transcriptional activity in HEK293 cells, consistent with the weak protein binding activity of this mutant element (Fig. 2A). These results indicate that the sequence specificity of the D2-DRE conforms to a Freud-1 binding site. Taken together, the protein binding and repressor activities of the D2-DRE suggest its role as a repressor element of the DRD2 gene. Analysis of the sequence surrounding the D2-DRE (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP) revealed two previously uncharacterized single nucleotide polymorphisms, A/G (rs2734836) and A/C (rs2734835). The more proximal polymorphism (rs2734836) is located 8 bp downstream of the D2-DRE. The effect of the rs2734836 polymorphism on D2-DRE repressor activity was analyzed using reporter constructs incorporating D2-DRE with either A- or G-allele (D2-DRE(A) or -(G)). Although both D2-DRE alleles displayed significant repression in A7 cells, the G-allele exhibited significantly less repression than the A-allele. Similarly, in HEK293 cells the A-allele repressed luciferase activity to less than 20% of control, whereas the G-allele displayed only 50% repression (Fig. 2B). These data indicate that the A-allele of the rs2734836 polymorphism has a stronger repressor activity in both cell lines than the G-allele. Freud-1 Interacts with the D2-DRE—To address whether Freud-1 is present in the protein-D2-DRE complex from HEK293 nuclear extracts, an antibody specific for Freud-1 (anti-mFreud-1 (10Ou X.M. Lemonde S. Jafar-Nejad H. Bown C.D. Goto A. Rogaeva A. Albert P.R. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7415-7425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) was included to supershift the complex (Fig. 3A). In the presence of anti-mFreud-1 antibody but not preimmune serum, a slowly migrating protein-D2-DRE complex was observed (solid arrowhead), consistent with the presence of antibody-bound Freud-1 in the complex. Similarly, incubation of nuclear extracts from A7 cells with anti-CC2D1A antibody (human Freud-1) resulted in a mobility shift of the protein-D2-DRE complex (Fig. 3B, solid arrowhead). The supershifted complex was partially displaced by inclusion of antigenic blocking peptide, indicating the specificity of the antibody. These results indicate that Freud-1 is present in nuclear extracts and binds to the D2-DRE. We examined whether Freud-1 directly interacts with the D2-DRE using in vitro transcribed and translated mouse Freud-1 protein. Incubation of recombinant Freud-1 with labeled D2-DRE revealed a specific protein-DNA complex that was efficiently competed by excess unlabeled D2-DRE (Fig. 3C, arrow) but not by unrelated E2F primers (data not shown), indicating that Freud-1 binds directly to the D2-DRE. The influence of the rs2734836 polymorphism on the binding of recombinant Freud-1 was determined by EMSA with either the labeled A- or G-allele of the D2-DRE (Fig. 3D). The intensity of the Freud-1-D2-DRE complex was greater for D2-DRE(A) than for D2-DRE(G), suggesting a greater binding affinity of Freud-1 for the A-allele (Fig. 3D, lanes 2 versus 7). Consistent with this, a 100-fold excess of unlabeled A-allele completely displaced DRE binding, whereas the G-allele was only partially effective (Fig. 3D, lanes 3 versus 4). Unlabeled rat 5-HT1A 3′DRE oligonucleotides competed as effectively as the D2-DRE A-allele, consistent with specific binding of Freud-1 to both DRE sites (Fig. 3D). These results demonstrate that the G-allele of the rs2734836 polymorphism displays reduced affinity for Freud-1 binding, correlating with a decrease in Freud-1-mediated repression at the G-allele compared with the A-allele (Fig. 2B). To address whether endogenous Freud-1 is bound to the DRD2 gene in cells, quantitative CHIP assays were conducted. Anti-CC2D1A antibody was used to immunopre"
https://openalex.org/W2061027559,"Post-translational acetylation of histone tails is often required for the recruitment of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers, which in turn mobilize nucleosomes on the chromatin fiber. Here we show that the lower lobe of the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler RSC exists in a dynamic equilibrium and can be found extended away or retracted against the tripartite upper lobe of the complex. Extension of the lower lobe increases the size of a central cavity that has been proposed to be the nucleosome binding site. We show that the presence of acetylated histone 3 N-terminal tail peptides stabilizes the lower lobe of RSC in the retracted state, suggesting that domains recognizing the acetylated histone tails reside at the interface between the two lobes. Based on three-dimensional reconstructions, we propose a model for the interaction of RSC with acetylated nucleosomes.

Based on three-dimensional reconstructions, we propose a model for the interaction of RSC with acetylated nucleosomes. The acetylation of lysines at the N-terminal histone tails is a crucial modification whose extent appears to correlate with the transcriptional state of chromatin. Hyperacetylated chromatin is transcriptionally active, whereas hypoacetylated chromatin regions are repressed. A key role for acetylated lysines is the direct recruitment of ATP-dependent remodelers via specific binding of bromodomains that reside in these complexes (1Wu J. Grunstein M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 619-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 2Jenuwein T. Allis C.D.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1348-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Once recruited, ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes mobilize nucleosomes in the chromatin fiber, thereby enhancing the accessibility of specific DNA regions (4Smith C.L. Peterson C.L. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2005; 65: 115-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 5Verger A. Crossley M. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 2154-2162Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, most of the known bromodomains are found in a single complex, the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler RSC (3Kasten M. Szerlong H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Werner M. Cairns B.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1348-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The RSC complex belongs to the SWI/SNF class of chromatin remodelers, with orthologous complexes in Drosophila (PBAP) and mammals (PBAF) (6Mohrmann L. Verrijzer C.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1681: 59-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). RSC contains about 15 sub-units and shares two identical and at least four homologous subunits with the prototypic member of its class, the yeast SWI/SNF complex (7Cairns B.R. Lorch Y. Li Y. Zhang M.

The segregation of bromodomains in RSC strongly suggests that the recognition and binding of acetylated lysines is a crucial component for the remodeling action of the complex. The Rsc4 subunit presents preferential binding to histone 3 (H3) 3The abbreviations used are: H3, histone 3; TAP, tandem affinity purification; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino) triphosphate. peptides acetylated at Lys-14, and RSC binding on nucleosomes is enhanced upon histone tail acetylation (3Kasten M. Szerlong H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Werner M. Cairns B.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1348-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 9Carey M. Li B. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 481-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). As a first step toward understanding the mechanism of RSC-mediated chromatin remodeling, we used negative stain electron microscopy and single-particle averaging techniques to investigate the effect of acetylated histone tail peptides on the structure of RSC. RSC Purification and Sample Preparation—The C terminus of the Sth1 subunit of RSC was modified by insertion of a PCR fragment containing the TAP tag and a kanamycin resistance marker at the endogenous STH1 locus. The RSC complex was purified from S. cerevisiae using a standard TAP procedure (10Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar). To help preserve the integrity of the complex, 20% glycerol was used throughout the purification except in the final elution step. The elution buffer contained 20 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.6), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm imidazole, 5 mm EGTA, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. As the RSC complex is unstable, the sample was prepared for electron microscopy immediately after purification. For experiments in the presence of N-terminal H3 tails, we used the peptide ARTKQTARKSTGGKAPRKQL, unmodified, acetylated at Lys-9 or Lys-14, or methylated at Lys-4. In addition, we used a Lys-9-acetylated polyalanine peptide (AAAAAAAAKAAAAAAAAAAA) and a Lys-9-acetylated peptide with the H3 peptide residues in random order (GRKKQATTKRASPTRQKLAG). All peptides were purchased from the peptide synthesis facility at Tufts Medical School (Boston, MA). RSC complexes at a concentration of ∼0.05–0.1 mg/ml were incubated with peptide for 5 min at a final concentration of 0.25 mm. Experiments in the presence of ATP analogue were performed with AMP-PNP at a final concentration of 5 mm. Electron Microscopy—RSC complexes were prepared for electron microscopy using the conventional negative staining protocol (11Ohi M. Li Y. Cheng Y. Walz T. Biol. Proced. Online. 2004; 6: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 μl of sample was adsorbed to a glow-discharged carbon-coated copper grid, washed with two drops of deionized water, and stained with two drops of 0.75% uranyl formate. The sample was imaged at room temperature with a Tecnai T12 electron microscope equipped with an LaB6 filament and operated at an acceleration voltage of 120 kV. Images of untilted specimens and image pairs of specimens tilted to 60° and 0° were recorded using low dose procedures at a magnification of ×52,000 and a defocus value of about–1.5 μm. Images were taken on Kodak SO-163 film and developed for 10 min with full-strength Kodak D-19 developer at 20 °C. Image Processing—Micrographs were digitized with a Zeiss SCAI scanner using a step size of 7 μm, and 3 × 3 pixels were averaged to obtain a pixel size of 4.04 Å on the specimen level. For the projection analysis, particles were interactively selected using the display program WEB associated with the SPIDER program suite (12Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1817) Google Scholar). The particles were windowed into 130 × 130-pixel images and subjected to 10 cycles of multireference alignment and K-means classification specifying from 20 to 45 output classes. For the initial classification of the RSC complex in each condition, we used 2,500–5,000 particles. To confirm our results and interpretations, the experiments were repeated three times with different RSC preparations, whereas all conditions were tested in parallel within each set of experiments. Based on the first classification, we then selected only the images that displayed particles with both lobes. These intact particles were subjected to a second multireference alignment to improve their classification. Based on the results from the first and second classification steps, we calculated mean values and standard deviations for particle states (open, closed, and those missing the lower lobe; see Fig. 1). For three-dimensional reconstruction of RSC in the closed and fully open states, 4,252 pairs of particles were selected interactively from the images of both the untilted sample and the 60° tilted sample (56 image pairs) using WEB. The selected particles were windowed into 130 × 130-pixel images, and the particles from the untilted specimens were classified into 35 classes as described above. After an additional classification step of particles with both lobes, particle images from classes with similar projection averages of RSC in the closed or fully open state (four and five classes, respectively) were combined and used for three-dimensional reconstruction with the random conical tilt technique (13Radermacher M. Wagenknecht T. Verschoor A. Frank J. J. Microsc. 1987; 146: 113-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The particles selected from the images of the tilted specimens of these classes (914 particles for the closed state and 684 for the open state) were used to calculate an initial three-dimensional reconstruction by back-projection, back-projection refinement, and angular refinement. After angular refinement, the corresponding particles from the images of the untilted specimen were added (total of 1,828 and 1,368 projections for the closed and open state, respectively), and the images were subjected to another cycle of angular refinement. The resulting density maps served as an input model for FREALIGN (14Grigorieff N. J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 157: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), which was used for further refinement of the orientation parameters of the individual particles and to correct for the contrast transfer function of each particle image according to its defocus value. The correct defocus value for each particle image was deduced from the position of each particle in the image and the tilt angles and defocus values of the images, which were determined with CTFTILT (15Mindell J.A. Grigorieff N. J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 142: 334-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). The resolutions of the final three-dimensional reconstructions were estimated using Fourier shell correlation and were 40 Å for both the closed state and the open state using the Fourier shell correlation = 0.15 criterion (16Rosenthal P.B. Henderson R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 721-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar). We purified RSC by a standard tandem affinity purification procedure using yeast cells that expressed a C-terminally TAP-tagged RSC Sth1 subunit (10Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 1). Classification of images of 4,252 negatively stained particles showed that all complexes adsorbed to the carbon support film in two preferred orientations that are related to each other by a 180° rotation. RSC particles consisted of two major lobes, separated by a central cavity (Fig. 1a). The upper lobe is elongated and consists of three connected, roughly globular domains (Fig. 1, labeled 1–3). The oval-shaped lower lobe was missing in around 50% of the particles, similar to what was previously reported (17Asturias F.J. Chung W.H. Kornberg R.D. Lorch Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13477-13480Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1b), suggesting a weak connection between the two lobes. We therefore performed a second classification step using only complete particles in which both lobes were present (supplemental Fig. 2). These intact complexes constituted about 50% ± 10% of the particle population. Our analysis showed that domains 2 and 3 in the upper lobe of RSC were always well defined and may thus form a rigid scaffold. In contrast, the density for domain 1 was found at variable angles with respect to the rigid scaffold and is occasionally smeared out, suggesting increased variance in its position (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. 2). A recent electron microscopy study of RSC by Leschziner et al. (18Leschziner A.E. Saha A. Wittmeyer J. Zhang Y. Bustamante C. Cairns B.R. Nogales E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 4913-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) also reported positional variability of domain 1 (referred to as the “arm” in that study), although to a much greater extent than what we see in our class averages. In addition to the flexibility of domain 1, we observe a much more pronounced variability in the position of the lower lobe in our class averages. The oval-shaped lower lobe is connected to the upper lobe by a flexible hinge at the side of domain 1 of the upper lobe. Pivoting from this hinge, the lower lobe can be found either contacting the upper lobe (designated closed state) or rotated away from the upper lobe to a varying degree (designated open state) (Fig. 1a and supplemental Fig. 2). Based on the numbers of particles classified in each category, there are similar numbers of open and closed RSC complexes, with the closed ones usually being slightly more prevalent than the open ones (Fig. 2). In a next step, we examined the positioning of the lower lobe of RSC in the presence of unmodified and modified H3 peptides containing the first 20 N-terminal amino acids. To increase the statistical significance of our results, all experiments were repeated three times with different RSC samples, and all conditions were tested in parallel within the same set of experiments. The percentage of complexes missing the lower lobe was approximately the same in all analyzed data sets without any particular condition affecting the amount of incomplete particles in a statistically significant manner (Fig. 2). In contrast to the presence of the unmodified H3 tail peptide, which did not significantly affect the distribution of the complexes (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. 3), incubation with H3 tail peptides carrying acetylated lysines caused a dramatic increase in the number of RSC particles adopting the closed conformation. H3 peptides acetylated at either lysine 9 or lysine 14 caused the lower lobe to pack against the upper lobe in more than 90% of the intact particles (Fig. 2 and supplemental Figs. 4 and 5). This tight interaction leads to a more rigid structure and better defined appearance of the lower lobe. As a control, we incubated RSC with an H3 peptide dimethylated at lysine 4, a modification that has been shown to recruit the chromatin remodeling ATPase Isw1p in S. cerevisiae (19Santos-Rosa H. Schneider R. Bernstein B.E. Karabetsou N. Morillon A. Weise C. Schreiber S.L. Mellor J. Kouzarides T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1325-1332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The methylated peptide did not affect the position of the lower lobe, and the particles showed approximately the same distribution between open and closed RSC complexes seen without peptide and with unmodified H3 peptide (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. 6). To test whether the position of the lower lobe might be related to the nucleotide state of the ATPase Sth1 subunit, we also tested the effect of the ATP analogue AMP-PNP alone and in combination with H3 peptide acetylated at Lys-14. The addition of AMP-PNP alone did not significantly change the ratio of RSC in the open and closed conformations, whereas its combination with the acetylated peptide resulted in the same increase in closed complexes as observed in the case of the acetylated peptide alone without AMP-PNP (Fig. 2 and supplemental Figs. 7 and 8). Furthermore, preliminary experiments with a Lys-9-acetylated peptide containing the remaining residues of the H3 peptide in random order show RSC in predominantly closed states, similarly to the results obtained with Lys-9-acetylated wild-type H3 peptide. In contrast, the presence of a polyalanine peptide with an acetylated lysine at position 9 did not affect the positioning of the lower lobe (data not shown), suggesting that the combination of charge and acetylation is required for lower lobe closure. Further experiments with various peptide sequences will, however, be required to fully characterize the influence of the peptide sequence, charge, and acetylation state on the equilibrium between the open and closed RSC conformations. These results describe the first observations for the interplay of histone tail acetylation with structural changes in an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex. One possibility is that peptide binding on one of the RSC lobes causes an allosteric conformational change that results in the stabilization of the lower lobe in the closed conformation. This transition might be a prerequisite or a substep in the remodeling mechanism itself. Alternatively, both lobes of the RSC complex might be involved in the binding of acetylated peptides. Without bound substrate, the lower lobe in RSC appears to exist in a dynamic equilibrium and to be able to sample both the open and the closed conformations. Only if a peptide containing an acetylated lysine residue is bound to one of the lobes would the lower lobe “lock on” as it samples the closed state, whereas it would simply open again if the substrate were not present, a situation reminiscent of iron binding in between transferrin lobes (20Baker H.M. Anderson B.F. Baker E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3579-3583Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). To gain better insight into the fully open and closed states of RSC, we calculated three-dimensional reconstructions of each conformation using the random conical tilt approach (13Radermacher M. Wagenknecht T. Verschoor A. Frank J. J. Microsc. 1987; 146: 113-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). The random conical tilt reconstructions also confirmed that the two projection maps correlate to open and closed structures of the RSC complex rather than reflecting different views of the same RSC conformation. Although our models are expected to be flattened due to the negative staining technique, the final three-dimensional maps at ∼40 Å resolution are in very good agreement with the projection averages of the open and closed states of RSC particles (Fig. 1a). Although the two reconstructions show very similar structural features, the only significant difference between the two maps at this resolution is the position of the lower lobe. In the fully open state, the lower lobe is projecting away from the complex by pivoting from the hinge to its left by ∼20 °, enlarging the central cavity to a distance between the lobes of ∼5.5 nm (Fig. 3). Our reconstructions reveal overall similar features to the three-dimensional map of RSC presented by Asturias et al. (17Asturias F.J. Chung W.H. Kornberg R.D. Lorch Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13477-13480Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), although in our density maps, the lower lobe is connected to the upper lobe on the opposite side of the complex (the side of domain 1 rather than the side of domain 3), and the central cavity can only accommodate a nucleosome if the lower lobe pivots outwards to its open state (Fig. 4). The three-dimensional reconstructions obtained by Asturias et al. (17Asturias F.J. Chung W.H. Kornberg R.D. Lorch Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13477-13480Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and by us show, however, striking differences to those recently presented by Leschziner et al. (18Leschziner A.E. Saha A. Wittmeyer J. Zhang Y. Bustamante C. Cairns B.R. Nogales E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 4913-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In the density maps presented by Leschziner et al. (18Leschziner A.E. Saha A. Wittmeyer J. Zhang Y. Bustamante C. Cairns B.R. Nogales E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 4913-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the proposed nucleosome binding site appears to be a central channel with top and bottom exits that are rotated by 90° when compared with our maps. In addition, in their three-dimensional maps, domain 1 (referred to as “arm” in that work) appears to be pointing toward the lower lobe (referred to as “lid” in that work), whereas all projection averages show this domain pointing in the opposite direction. Since the two-dimensional projections of RSC look very similar in our study and the ones by Asturias et al. (17Asturias F.J. Chung W.H. Kornberg R.D. Lorch Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13477-13480Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and Leschziner et al. (18Leschziner A.E. Saha A. Wittmeyer J. Zhang Y. Bustamante C. Cairns B.R. Nogales E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 4913-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the large differences may be due to the different reconstruction schemes used. While the similar three-dimensional reconstructions of RSC presented here and previously by Asturias et al. (17Asturias F.J. Chung W.H. Kornberg R.D. Lorch Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13477-13480Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) were calculated with the established random conical tilt approach (13Radermacher M. Wagenknecht T. Verschoor A. Frank J. J. Microsc. 1987; 146: 113-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), the differing three-dimensional reconstruction reported by Leschziner et al. (18Leschziner A.E. Saha A. Wittmeyer J. Zhang Y. Bustamante C. Cairns B.R. Nogales E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 4913-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) was calculated by the new and not yet fully proven orthogonal tilt reconstruction method, which was used for the first time in that study without independent verification of the resulting three-dimensional maps.FIGURE 4The central cavity of an open RSC complex can accommodate a nucleosome. Modeling reveals that a nucleosome can occupy the central cavity in RSC only when the lower lobe is in the open state. The nucleosome fits as a slice between the upper and lower lobes of RSC. The scale bar is 25 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The mobile lower lobe in the RSC complex is likely to be a key component for nucleosome binding and chromatin remodeling. Interestingly, one of the lobes in the homologous PBAF complex also appears to be connected by a hinge, adopting variable positions with respect to the remaining complex (21Leschziner A.E. Lemon B. Tjian R. Nogales E. Structure (Camb.). 2005; 13: 267-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Binding of the nucleosome in the cavity between the upper and lower lobe of RSC would block the approach of DNases and thus protect the nucleosomal DNA from digestion, as reported previously (17Asturias F.J. Chung W.H. Kornberg R.D. Lorch Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13477-13480Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 22Saha A. Wittmeyer J. Cairns B.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Modeling shows that the central cavity of RSC is large enough to accommodate a nucleosome only when the lower lobe is in its open position but not when it is closed against the upper lobe (Fig. 4). In this model, the nucleosome can load from the side of RSC and bind in either orientation as a slice in between upper and lower lobes, which is consistent with the symmetric DNA digestion patterns reported by Saha et al. (22Saha A. Wittmeyer J. Cairns B.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Our analysis shows that the presence of acetylated H3 peptides, but not that of an acetylated lysine containing polyalanine peptide, stabilizes RSC in the closed state. This finding suggests that domains close to the interface of the upper or lower lobes recognize acetylated lysines and also certain amino acid residues in the histone peptides. Bromodomains that recognize acetylated histone tails are found in subunits Rsc1, Rsc2, Rsc 4, and Sth1 (3Kasten M. Szerlong H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Werner M. Cairns B.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1348-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and it is thus reasonable to speculate that these proteins might reside close to the interface of upper and lower lobes in RSC. Whether due to an allosteric mechanism or binding to both RSC lobes, the effect of histone acetylation would presumably be modulated by the presence of a complete nucleosome. In this case, the dynamic nature of the lower lobe might enable RSC to merely sense and accommodate a nucleosome into the central cavity, whereas the presence of acetylated lysines in histone tails would be required for stronger interactions with RSC bromodomains and for stabilizing the nucleosome at the interface of the RSC upper and lower lobes. The acetylation-mediated tight loading of the histone octamer should be a prerequisite for the translocation of DNA from the fixed nucleosomal core as has been recently suggested (22Saha A. Wittmeyer J. Cairns B.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar).

We analyzed FOS of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to elucidate its detailed degradation pathway. The major FOSs were high mannose-type ones bearing 3-9 Man residues. About 94% of the total FOSs had one GlcNAc at their reducing end (FOS-GN1), and the remaining 6% had two GlcNAc (FOS-GN2). A cytosolic endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase mutant (tm1208) accumulated FOS-GN2, indicating involvement of the enzyme in conversion of FOS-GN2 into FOS-GN1. The most abundant FOS in the wild type was Man5GlcNAc1, the M5A′ isomer (Manα1-3(Manα1-6)Manα1-6(Manα1-3)Manβ1-4GlcNAc), which is different from the corresponding M5B′ (Manα1-2Manα1-2Manα1-3(Manα1-6)Manβ1-4GlcNAc) in mammals. Analyses of FOS in worms treated with Golgi α-mannosidase I inhibitors revealed decreases in Man5GlcNAc1 and increases in Man7GlcNAc1. These results suggested that Golgi α-mannosidase I-like enzyme is involved in the production of Man5-6-GlcNAc1, which is unlike in mammals, in which cytosolic α-mannosidase is involved. Thus, we assumed that major FOSs in C. elegans were generated through Golgi trafficking. Analysis of FOSs from a Golgi α-mannosidase II mutant (tm1078) supported this idea, because GlcNAc1Man5GlcNAc1, which is formed by the Golgi-resident GlcNAc-transferase I, was found as a FOS in the mutant. We concluded that significant amounts of misfolded glycoproteins in C. elegans are trafficked to the Golgi and are directly or indirectly retro-translocated into the cytosol to be degraded.

We concluded that significant amounts of misfolded glycoproteins in C. elegans are trafficked to the Golgi and are directly or indirectly retro-translocated into the cytosol to be degraded. It is known that N-linked oligosaccharides play important roles in the quality control of glycoproteins. An oligosaccharide composed of 14 sugars (Glc3Man9GlcNAc2) is transferred en bloc from a dolichol-linked donor to the Asn residue of nascent polypeptide chains by oligosaccharyltransferase (OST), 2The abbreviations used are: OST, oligosaccharyltransferase; FOS, free oligosaccharide; FOS-GN1, FOS with one GlcNAc residue at the reducing end; FOS-GN2, FOS with two GlcNAc residues at the reducing end; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ERAD, ER-associated degradation; DMJ, deoxymannojirimycin; KIF, kifunensin; EDEM, ER degradation-enhancing α-mannosidase-like protein; ENGase, endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase; PNGase, peptide:N-glycanase; PA, pyridylamine; GnT-I, β-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I; ESI-MS, electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary.2The abbreviations used are: OST, oligosaccharyltransferase; FOS, free oligosaccharide; FOS-GN1, FOS with one GlcNAc residue at the reducing end; FOS-GN2, FOS with two GlcNAc residues at the reducing end; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ERAD, ER-associated degradation; DMJ, deoxymannojirimycin; KIF, kifunensin; EDEM, ER degradation-enhancing α-mannosidase-like protein; ENGase, endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase; PNGase, peptide:N-glycanase; PA, pyridylamine; GnT-I, β-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I; ESI-MS, electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. and the oligosaccharides serve as tags indicating the folding state of glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Then, properly folded and assembled glycoproteins are transported to their destinations such as the extracellular space, plasma membrane, or inner compartments via the Golgi apparatus, with some accompanying modifications on the oligosaccharides.The presence of free oligosaccharides (FOSs) has been reported in the cytosol of several types of animal cells (1Cacan R.

These FOSs were thought to be generated from the ER by the following pathways. First, ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of glycoproteins is involved in generation of FOS. Misfolded or unassembled glycoproteins are recognized by ER degradation-enhancing α-mannosidase-like protein (EDEM), retro-translocated into the cytosol through the Sec61 translocon (7Tsai B. Ye Y. Rapoport T.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar) or the Hrd1 complex (8Plemper R.K. Wolf D.H. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1999; 26: 125-130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and subjected to ubiquitin-proteasome degradation. The N-glycans on the misfolded glycoproteins are released by peptide:N-glycanase (PNGase) in the cytosol before the degradation by the proteasome (9Suzuki T. Park H. Hollingsworth N.M. Sternglanz R. Lennarz W.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1039-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 10Spiro R.G. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1025-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Second, FOS may be generated as the hydrolysis products of a part of the dolichol-linked oligosaccharides in the luminal face of the ER by the action of OST. Free triglucosylated oligosaccharide is then hydrolyzed by ER α-glucosidases and ER α-mannosidase I; thereafter, the resulting Man8-9GlcNAc2 are transported into the cytosol in an ATP-dependent manner (11Moore S.E. Bauvy C. Codogno P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6034-6042Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Third, monophospho-oligosaccharides may be released from dolichol-linked oligosaccharide intermediates on the cytosolic face of the ER membrane, possibly by a cytosolic pyrophosphatase. The N,N′-diacetylchitobiose moiety of these FOSs (FOS-GN2) in the cytosol is believed to be hydrolyzed by a cytosolic endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (ENGase) to produce FOS with a single GlcNAc residue (FOS-GN1) (12Cacan R. Verbert A. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 13Verbert A. Cacan R. Biochim. Biophys.

FOS-GN1 species are further trimmed by cytosolic α-mannosidase to form M5B′ (Manα1-2Manα1-2Manα1-3(Manα1-6)Manβ1-4GlcNAc) (15Haeuw J.F. Strecker G. Wieruszeski J.M. Montreuil J. Michalski J.C. Eur.

Subsequently, they are transported to the lysosome to be degraded by lysosomal α- and β-mannosidases (3Moore S.E. Spiro R.G. J. Biol.

Although it has been known that significant amounts of FOSs are produced in the ER and cytosol, their biological functions or physiological significance remain to be uncovered.Caenorhabditis elegans is a genetically and developmentally well characterized multicellular eukaryote. In addition, C. elegans shares many fundamental biological pathways with higher eukaryotes, which makes it attractive for investigating functions of various biological compounds, such as glycoconjugates. The structures of N-linked oligosaccharides on glycoproteins from mixed stages of C. elegans have been examined by several groups (19Natsuka S. Adachi J. Kawaguchi M. Nakakita S. Hase S. Ichikawa A. Ikura K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 20Cipollo J.F. Costello C.E. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol.

J. 2001; 357: 167-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). According to those reports, the most abundant N-glycans on glycoproteins are those of the high mannose-type (Man3-9GlcNAc2); there are also minor amounts of methylated, fucosylated, phosphorylcholine-substituted hybrid- or complex-type oligosaccharides. Although fucosylated and phosphorylcholine-substituted oligosaccharides are unique to this lower eukaryote, fundamental sections of the glycoprotein synthetic pathway are well conserved.Previously, we cloned a cDNA encoding ENGase from C. elegans (eng-1, F01F1.10) based on the sequence homology with Endo-M from the fungus strain Mucor hiemalis (23Kato T. Fujita K. Takeuchi M. Kobayashi K. Natsuka S. Ikura K. Kumagai H. Yamamoto K. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 24Fujita K. Kobayashi K. Iwamatsu A. Takeuchi M. Kumagai H. Yamamoto K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 432: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although ENGase is predicted to be involved in FOS metabolism in the cytosol, there has been no report that shows direct evidence of this. To clarify this speculation, we employed C. elegans as a model animal and analyzed FOS in the cytosol. In this report, we present structural analyses of neutral FOS in the wild-type and two mutant worms and show evidence indicating that a significant amount of FOSs are generated through ER-Golgi trafficking.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExtraction and Labeling of FOS from C. elegans—C. elegans N2 Bristol strain (wild type) and the mutant strains tm1208 and tm1078 obtained from the National Bioresource Project for the Experimental Animal Nematode C. elegans (Tokyo Women's Medical University, Japan) were maintained and cultured on nematode-growing medium agar plates or in liquid medium with Escherichia coli OP50 as food. Worms were harvested and washed with M9 buffer (22 mm KH2PO4, 42 mm Na2HPO4, 86 mm NaCl, and 1 mm MgSO4). Contaminating food and worm debris were removed by the sucrose floatation method. To obtain cell extract of the worms, a suspension of ∼2.5-ml of worms was resuspended in 8 ml of ice-cold FOS extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm deoxymannojirimycin (DMJ), 0.5 mm swainsonine) and disrupted by sonication using an Insonater 201M (Kubota, Japan) on ice. The extract of worms was centrifuged (17,300 × g) for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was further centrifuged (106,000 × g) for 60 min at 4 °C. This supernatant was used as a cytosolic fraction. For purification of FOSs, the cytosolic fraction was quickly heated at 100 °C for 5 min to inactivate enzymes followed by addition of ethanol up to a concentration of 60% to precipitate proteins. After removal of the precipitates by centrifugation at 17,300 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was concentrated and applied onto a Sephadex G-15 column (2.8 × 40 cm, Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 50 mm NH4OH. The fractions eluted after the void volume and until the corresponding elution position of Man were collected and concentrated. The solution was desalted using a Dowex 50 × 2 column (H+ form, Sigma), followed by a Dowex 1 × 2 column (OH- form, Sigma). The desalted FOS was lyophilized and PA-labeled according to a previous method (25Hase S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). PA-FOSs were further applied onto a ConA-Sepharose 4B column (1.5 × 6 cm, Amersham Biosciences), and 0.3 m methyl-α-mannopyranoside-eluted fractions were concentrated and desalted by gel filtration.HPLC Analyses—To separate the FOS-GN1 and FOS-GN2 species, reversed-phase HPLC was performed using a Cosmosil 5C-18 AR-II column (4.6 × 250 mm, Nacalai Tesque, Japan). The column equilibrated with eluant A (water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) was washed with eluant A for 25 min at a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min, and then elution was performed by linearly increasing the acetonitrile concentration of eluant B (acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) from 0 to 7% in 25 min, at the same flow rate. Almost all FOS-GN1 species were eluted in the flow-through fractions within 33 min, and FOS-GN2 species were eluted after 35 min in these conditions. Size-fractionation HPLC was carried out using a Shodex NH2P-50 column (4.6 × 250 mm, Showa Denko, Japan). Two eluants were used: eluant C, 80% acetonitrile; eluant D, 20% acetonitrile. The column was equilibrated with C:D = 9:1 (v/v) at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min. After injecting a sample, elution was carried out with the same buffer for 5 min, and then linear gradient elution was performed to attain C:D = 2:3 for more 30 min. PA-FOSs were detected by fluorescence using an excitation of 310 nm and an emission of 380 nm.ESI-MS—The mass spectrometry was carried out using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Sciex API-III, triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer with an atmospheric pressure ionization ion source. The analyses were operated in the positive ion mode. Samples were dissolved in 50% acetonitrile containing 0.05% formic acid and introduced into the electrospray needle by mechanical infusion through a microsyringe at a flow rate of 5 μl/min.1H NMR Spectroscopy—Prior to NMR analysis, PA-FOS was exchanged in D2O (99.95 atom %D) with lyophilization, and finally dissolved in 200 μl of D2O (99.95 atom %D). 1H NMR spectrum was recorded at 600 MHz on an Avance (Bruker Bio-spin) instrument at a probe temperature of 333 K referenced with HOD δ = 4.32.Exoglycosidase Digestion—α-Mannosidase and β-N-acetyl-hexosaminidase from jack bean (Seikagaku Kogyo, Japan), and α1,2-specific mannosidase from Aspergillus saitoi (Seikagaku Kogyo) were used for exoglycosidase digestion of PA-FOS. α-Glucosidase II digestion was performed using the membrane fraction from a mycelia of Aspergillus oryzae according to a previous method (26Arai M.A. Matsuo I. Hagihara S. Totani K. Maruyama J. Kitamoto K. Ito Y. Chembiochem. 2005; 6: 2281-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).α-Mannosidase Inhibitor Treatment—The wild-type worms were harvested from nematode-growing medium agar plates with M9 buffer, washed several times, and resuspended in 2 ml of M9 buffer. Golgi α-mannosidase I inhibitors, DMJ (Merck, Germany) or KIF (Merck), were added to the worm suspension to a final concentration of 1 mm or 0.1 mm, respectively, and incubated for 4 h at 20 °C with gentle agitation. After incubation, worms were frozen in liquid nitrogen and subjected to extraction of FOS.Genomic Southern Blot Analysis—The genomic DNA from the wild-type worms (20 μg) was digested with HpaI (Toyobo, Tokyo), and then separated by electrophoresis on a 0.6% agarose gel. Separated products were blotted onto a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and hybridized with an ECL-labeled probe in gold hybridization buffer (Amersham Biosciences). The DNA probe was made by PCR using a primer pair of TKp57 (gacagaatcgaaagtgaatagtctgg) and TKp232 (cgccatctatctcaactacaac) and cosmid F01F1 as a template. The eng-1 DNA was detected using ECL detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences).Western Blot Analysis of C. elegans Extracts—Crude whole extracts of worms were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After blocking with 2% (w/v) skim milk, the blot was incubated with rabbit anti-ENG-1 polyclonal antibody (1:3000) raised against the recombinant ENG-1 expressed in E. coli, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). ENG-1 was visualized using the SuperSignal® West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce).Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy—To generate the mammalian expression vector pME-eng-1, eng-1 cDNA was inserted to the XhoI/MluI site of pME18Sf+ plasmid. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) K1 cells were transiently transfected with pME-eng-1 using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). Cells cultured on glass coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were stained with a rabbit anti-ENG-1 antibody (1:3000) and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000, Invitrogen), and analyzed by a fluorescent microscopy (Olympus).RESULTSStructural Analyses of Neutral FOS in the Wild-type C. elegans—We attempted to obtain high mannose-type FOS in the cytosolic fraction of the wild-type C. elegans, because cytosolic FOS might be produced in an early step of N-glycan synthesis and might have primitive structures without complex Golgi modifications. First, the worms were disrupted to extract FOS, and they were pyridylamine (PA)-labeled and purified by ConA-Sepharose column chromatography. The ConA-binding fractions were applied to a reversed-phase HPLC. Because it was previously reported that both PA compounds of FOS-GN1 and FOS-GN2 could be separated by reversed-phase HPLC (27Kimura Y. Matsuo S. Tsurusaki S. Kimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Nishimura M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1570: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), in our case, we supposed that the FOS-GN1 species must be eluted at the flow-through fraction (5-33 min, Fraction A) and FOS-GN2 species must be eluted later (after 35 min, Fraction B) (Fig. 1A). Each fraction was collected, concentrated, and further analyzed by size-fractionation HPLC. Upon HPLC of Fraction A, several peaks (1a-1h) were detected at the elution position of 3-11 Glc units (Fig. 1B, upper chart). A similar elution pattern was observed on HPLC of Fraction B, although the retention time of each peak (2a-2h) was a little longer compared with those of the corresponding peaks (1a-1h) on HPLC of Fraction A, because of the presence of one more GlcNAc (Fig. 1B, lower chart). By comparison with the retention times of standard PA-oligosaccharides, peaks 1a-1h and 2a-2h were presumed to be M3′∼M9′, G1M9′ (with one GlcNAc) and M3∼M9, G1M9 (with two GlcNAcs), respectively (see Tables 1 and 2 for abbreviations). The molecular masses of 1a-1g were analyzed by ESI-MS to confirm the sugar composition (Table 3). To analyze their structures in detail, Fractions A and B were treated with several kinds of exoglycosidases and analyzed by size-fractionation HPLC. By treatment of Fraction A with jack bean α-mannosidase, which hydrolyzes α1,2-, α1,3-, and α1,6-linked Man residues, only one peak was found at the corresponding elution position of M1′, although there were very minor species refractory to jack bean α-mannosidase (Fig. 1C, middle chart). This fact suggested that almost all FOSs of the worm were constituted of α-linked Man residues. Next, we carried out a treatment of Fraction A with α1,2-specific mannosidase, which resulted in an increase of peak 1c and a decrease of peaks 1d, 1e, 1g, and 1h (Fig. 1C, bottom chart). Peak 1c was completely resistant to 1,2-α-mannosidase (Fig. 1D), suggesting that peak 1c represents the M5A′ isomer (Manα1-3(Manα1-6)Manα1-6(Manα1-3)Manβ1-4GlcNAc), because M5A′ is the only M5 isomer that does not contain any α1,2-linked Man residues. We further confirmed the structure of peak 1c by 1H NMR. Four anomeric shifts from α-Man (indicated as 4, 4′, A, and B) and one from β-Man (indicated as 3) were found at δ 5.057, 4.789, 5.085, 4.832, and 4.770, respectively (Table 4). These anomeric and other chemical shifts of peak 1c were largely similar to those of the published data of non-pyridylaminated M5A′ (28Priem B. Gitti R. Bush C.A. Gross K.C. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 445-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) or M5A-PA (29Kimura Y. Hase S. Kobayashi Y. Kyogoku Y. Ikenaka T. Funatsu G. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 103: 944-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), supporting the notion that the isomeric structure of peak 1c was M5A′. The peak on the corresponding elution position of peak 1f also seemed to be resistant to 1,2-α-mannosidase treatment. Meanwhile, α-glucosidase treatment of peak 1h altered its elution position to subsequently correspond with that of M9′ (Fig. 1E), confirming this peak as representing glucosylated M9′ (G1M9′). Peak 1g was also sensitive to α-glucosidase (data not shown) and appeared to represent G1M8′. Thus, the remaining peak at the elution position of 1f after 1,2-α-mannosidase treatment of Fraction A was assumed to represent G1M7′ converted from G1M8′ and G1M9′. Fraction B was also analyzed in the same way. The amount of each FOS calculated from the peak areas of the HPLC chart (Fig. 1B) are summarized (Tables 1 and 2). As a result, M5A′ was found to be the most abundant FOS in C. elegans (42.3 pmol/mg of protein), and 94% of the total FOS was comprised of GN1 species (FOS-GN1, 108 pmol/mg of protein, FOS-GN2, 6.9 pmol/mg of protein).TABLE 1Structures and amounts of GN1 species of the free oligosaccharides in C. elegansView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Structures and amounts of GN2 species of the free oligosaccharides in C. elegansView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab TABLE 3ESI-MS analysis of pyridylaminated oligosaccharides of C. elegansPeakObserved massCompositionm/z1a786.4Hex3HexNAc-PA1b948.2Hex4HexNAc-PA1c1110.5Hex5HexNAc-PA1d1272.5Hex6HexNAc-PA1e1435.0Hex7HexNAc-PA1f1597.0Hex8HexNAc-PA1g1758.5Hex9HexNAc-PA Open table in a new tab TABLE 4Chemical shifts (ppm) of structural reporter group of PA-oligosaccharide of peak 1c observed on 600 MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy referenced to HOD δ = 4.32View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab ENG-1 Is Involved in Conversion of FOS-GN2 into FOS-GN1—A large part of FOSs in the wild type was the FOS-GN1 species, which is supposed to be produced by ENGase in the cytosol. Our previous study on the substrate specificity of ENGase from C. elegans (ENG-1 or Endo-CE) demonstrated that the enzyme preferably hydrolyzed high mannose-type PA-oligosaccharides than complex-type ones, which is consistent with the idea that ENG-1 is involved in the FOS metabolism. Therefore, we attempted to confirm that ENG-1 indeed acts on FOS-GN2 species. We obtained a mutant of eng-1(tm1208), which harbors a genomic deletion of 511 bp in length over the first intron and exon 3 of eng-1 gene as revealed by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 2, A and B). This genomic deletion results in the abolition of protein expression in the mutant (Fig. 2C). ENGase activity toward a substrate Man5GlcNAc2-PA was not detected at all in the lysate of the mutant (data not shown). Although no apparent morphological and behavioral phenotypes were observed, life span was slightly shorter than that of the wild type (data not shown). The FOS-GN1 and FOS-GN2 in this mutant were analyzed by the same method used for analyses of FOS in the wild type (supplemental Table S1). In the wild type, the amount of FOS-GN1 species (sum of M5′-M9′) was major, whereas in the eng-1 mutant (tm1208), GN2 species (M5-M9) was accumulated, although the total amount of FOS was smaller than that of the wild type (Fig. 2D). ENG-1 has no apparent signal sequence, and the protein expressed in CHO-K1 cells was distributed throughout the cell (Fig. 2E), suggesting that ENG-1 substantially contributes to the conversion of FOS-GN2 into FOS-GN1 in the cytosol.FIGURE 2ENG-1 contributes to the conversion of GN2 into GN1 in the cytosol.

The mammalian M5B′ isoform is considered to be a result of the actions of the cytosolic α-mannosidase, which is classified as a class 2 α-mannosidase. However, no candidate cytosolic α-mannosidase homologue was found in the C. elegans genome as revealed by phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 3). Furthermore, we could not detect any neutral α-mannosidase activity in the cytosolic fraction of C. elegans using p-nitrophenyl-α-mannopyranoside as a substrate (data not shown), although its activity in mammals is detectable using the same substrate.FIGURE 3A phylogenetic tree of α-mannosidases. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on amino acid sequences using the ClustalW program. Predicted α-mannosidases in the C. elegans genome (open reading frame names in bold italic) and some α-mannosidases from the human, mouse, rat, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were used.

We previously demonstrated that ER stress induces transcription of the ER Golgi intermediate compartment protein ERGIC-53. To investigate the molecular events that regulate unfolded protein response-mediated induction of the gene, we have analyzed the transcriptional regulation of ERGIC-53. We found that the ERGIC-53 promoter contains a single cis-acting element that mediates induction of the gene by thapsigargin and other ER stress-causing agents. This ER stress response element proved to retain a novel structure and to be highly conserved in mammalian ERGIC-53 genes. The ER stress response element identified contains a 5′-end CCAAT sequence that constitutively binds NFY/CBF and, 9 nucleotides away, a 3′-end region (5′-CCCTGTTGGCCATC-3′) that is equally important for ER stress-mediated induction of the gene. This sequence is the binding site for endogenous YY1 at the 5′-CCCTGTTGG-3′ part and for undefined factors at the CCATC 3′-end.

ATF6α is an ER transmembrane protein that, during ER stress, can be recruited by transport vesicles destined for the Golgi complex, where, consequent to intramembrane proteolysis, a 50-kDa cytosolic form is generated that activates transcription of UPR genes (26Yoshida H.

We have studied the regulation of the ERGIC-53 promoter in an attempt to shed light on the transcriptional mechanisms that control ERGIC-53 expression. The transcriptional regulation of ERGIC-53 by the UPR requires a single cis-acting element (ERGIC-53 ERSE), which is highly conserved in mammals and is different from the other types of ERSE identified. Antibodies—The following antibodies were used in EMSA and ChIP assays: mouse monoclonal anti-ATF6α (Active Motif), mouse monoclonal anti-YY1 and anti-HA epitope, and rabbit polyclonal anti-NFY-CBF/A, anti-XBP1, anti-Sp1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Cell Culture and Induction of ER Stress—HeLa cells, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from wild type or IRE1α knock-out mice (38Lee K. Tirasophon W. Shen X. Michalak M. Prywes R. Okada T. Yoshida H. Mori K. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 452-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar), were grown at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2, 95% atmosphere in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 4.5 g/liter glucose, and 2mm glutamine. To induce ER stress, we incubated actively growing cells for 8 h (unless otherwise indicated) with 300 nm thapsigargin (TG), 2 mm DTT, or 10 μm MG132 (Sigma) before harvesting. RNA Extraction and Real Time RT-PCR Analyses—Serial dilutions of total RNA obtained from HeLa, wild type, and IRE1–/– MEF cells (RNeasy kit; Qiagen) were reverse transcribed (Invitrogen) and subjected to real time RT-PCR using the iCycler Apparatus (Bio-Rad) and analyzed by the SybrGreen method. The following primers were used to amplify the corresponding transcripts in human cells: ERGIC-53-forward, 5′-GGG CAG CAT GGG CAG ATT AC-3′; ERGIC-53-reverse, 5′-CAT AGA CGC CTC CAG CAG AGC-3′; GAPDH-forward, 5′-GAA GGT GAA GGT CGG AGT C-3′; GAPDH-reverse, 5′-GAA GAT GGT GAT GGG ATT TC-3′. The following primers were designed to amplify the corresponding transcripts in murine cells: ERGIC-53 forward, 5′-GGA CAG CCT GGG CAG GTC TC-3′; ERGIC-53 reverse, 5′-GGG TGC TGG ATG CCA CTC A-3′; c-ABL forward, 5′-GGT ATG AAG GGA GGG TGT ACC A-3′; and c-ABL reverse, 5′-CAC TTG ATT GAG TCG GTC TCA CAA CT-3′. The following primers were used to amplify the Grp94 transcripts from both human and murine cells: Grp94 forward, 5′-TCC GCC TTC CTT GTA GCA GAT A-3′; Grp94 reverse, 5′-TGT TTC CTC TTG GGT CAG CAA T-3′. Expression level was calculated according to the 2–ΔΔCT method (39Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods (Orlando. 2001; 25 ()): 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (127155) Google Scholar) by using either GAPDH or c-Abl mRNA as a control gene. Construction of Plasmids—A 1084-bp fragment spanning from nt –874 to +202 of the human BiP/Grp78 promoter (EMBL Data Library accession number X59969) (40Chao C.C. Lin-Chao S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6481-6485Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and a 1036-bp fragment corresponding to the LMAN1/ERGIC-53 gene (NCBI ref/NT_025028) from nt –1003 to +33 were isolated by PCR amplification from genomic DNA extracted from HeLa cells, and PCR fragments were gel-purified and cloned by using the pGEM-T Easy Vector system (Promega). The Bip/Gpr78 promoter region spanning from nt –838 to –16 was PCR-amplified with synthetic oligonucleotides having KpnI-XhoI flanking restriction sites and subcloned in the pGL3Basic vector (Promega) to drive the expression of firefly luciferase reporter gene. Similarly, the ERGIC-53 promoter region (nt –1000 to –1) was ligated to the KpnI-HindIII site of the pGL3Basic vector (Promega) upstream from the luciferase reporter gene. Progressive deletion of the 5′-flanking region of the ERGIC-53 promoter was obtained by PCR amplification using forward primers containing the 5′-KpnI site and common reverse primers with the 3′-HindIII site. The –149 to –1 and –149 to –63 fragments were obtained by PCR, digested, and inserted in the KpnI-BglII site of the pGL3 promoter vector (Promega), which contains the SV40 minimal promoter upstream from the luciferase coding sequence (SV40Luc). Synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to the ERSE-I consensus sequence, the –32 to –1 and the –65 to –31 region of the ERGIC-53 ERSE, and cassette and point mutations of ERGIC-53 ERSE were synthesized, in vitro annealed, and inserted in the KpnI-BglII site of the pGL3 promoter vector and controlled by sequencing. The pCGN-ATF6-(1–373) and pCGN-ATF6-(1–273) expression vectors (31Baumeister P. Luo S. Skarnes W.C. Sui G. Seto E. Shi Y. Lee A.S. Mol.

The pCGN-ATF6-(1–373) m1 was already described (25Wang Y. Shen J. Arenzana N. Tirasophon W. Kaufman R.J. Priwes R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27013-27020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection Experiments for Transient Expression of Reporter Plasmids—Actively growing HeLa and MEF cells were seeded onto 60-mm plates at ∼20–30% of confluence and transfected with 1 μg of luciferase reporter plasmids and 0.5 μg of the RSV-β-Gal reporter control plasmid (Promega) by using the FuGene Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science). Cells were incubated with the Fugene-DNA complex for 16 h at 37 °C, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega) 48 h after transfection. To measure LacZ reporter gene activity (β-galactosidase), we incubated cell extracts for 1 h at 37 °C in β-galactosidase assay buffer (200 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1.33 mg/ml o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside). The reaction was blocked by adding 1 m sodium carbonate, and absorbance was measured at 420 nm. We measured luciferase activity with a Berthold luminometer in 40 μl of cell lysate supplemented with 100 μl of luciferase assay reagent (Promega). “Relative luciferase activity” is defined as the luciferase-to-β-galactosidase activity ratio and normalized for the protein concentration of each sample. “-Fold induction” is defined as the ratio between the enzyme activities of treated cells with respect to that of untreated cells. In all experiments, values are reported as the average and S.D. of at least three independent experiments carried out in duplicate. Statistical analysis was performed using Student’s t test (n = 6–8). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—1 × 106 HeLa cells were treated or not for 2–4 h with 300 nm TG for the UPR induction. For the ChIP analysis of overexpressed ATF6α, HeLa cells were transfected with 6 μg of the pCGN-ATF6-(1–373) and pCGN-ATF6-(1–273) expression vectors (31Baumeister P. Luo S. Skarnes W.C. Sui G.

J. 2002; 366: 787-795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and harvested 24 h after transfection. Experiments were performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Briefly, cells were exposed to 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C to obtain protein-DNA cross-linking. The nuclear fraction was sonicated to obtain chromatin fragments of 200–1000 bp; an aliquot (5% of the total volume) was removed from each sample and used as the input fraction. Chromatin was precleared by preincubation with a DNA salmon sperm/protein A-agarose 50% slurry (Upstate Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C. The agarose was centrifuged, and the precleared chromatin supernatant was then incubated with the indicated antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The protein-DNA-antibody complexes were collected by the addition of the salmon sperm DNA-protein A-agarose (2 h at 4 °C) and washed, and protein-DNA cross-linking was reversed (4 h at 65 °C). DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, and aliquots (25%) of the purified materials underwent PCR (5 min at 94 °C; 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 52 °C, 1 min at 72 °C for 40 cycles; 5 min at 72 °C). The following primers were used in the PCR: 5′-TGAACCAATGGGACCAGC-3′ and 5′-CTCACCGTCGCCTACTCG-3′ to amplify a 254-bp fragment of the human Bip/Grp78 promoter spanning from nt –267 to nt –13; 5′-AAGCGAAGGTTGGAGTCC-3′ and 5′-CGCCATCTTGGATTCTCC-3′ to amplify a 271-bp fragment of the LMAN1/ERGIC-53 promoter extending from nt –226 to nt +45. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts and Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assays—5–6 × 106 HeLa cells were either treated for 2 h with 300 nm TG to induce ER stress or transiently transfected with 6 μg of the pCGN-ATF6-(1–373) expression vector and harvested 48 h after transfection. Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by scraping. The cell pellet was resuspended in extraction buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, passed through a needle, kept on ice for 45 min, and centrifuged (15 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C). The nuclear pellet was then resuspended in high salt extraction buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and incubated for 45 min at 4 °C. The nuclear extract supernatant was obtained by centrifugation (30 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C), protein concentration was determined, and 5-μg aliquots were stored at –80 °C until used. Double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides were radiolabeled using [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci mmol–1; Amersham Biosciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Fermentas). The binding reaction was carried out for 20 min at room temperature with 5 μg of nuclear proteins in 4% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm DTT, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.250 μg/μl poly(dI-dC) containing 30,000 cpm of radiolabeled probe and a 50–100-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide when indicated. For supershift experiments, 4 μg of specific anti-NFY/CBF-A and 10 μg of either anti-YY1- or anti-HA-specific antibody was added to the binding reaction and incubated for 30 min before the addition of the radiolabeled probe. DNA-protein complexes were separated by 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and revealed by PhosphorImager analysis (Typhoon 8600; Amersham Biosciences). Isolation of the ERGIC-53 Minimal Inducible Promoter—To identify ERSE elements in the ERGIC-53 promoter, we looked for transcription factor binding sites (TESS analysis) on about 1000 bp of the 5′-region of the ERGIC-53 gene. Three 5′-CCAAT motifs scored high as binding sites for the transcription factor NFY/CBF. This result suggested the presence of three putative ERSEs located at positions –334 to –316, –277 to –259, and –62 to –44 (Fig. 1A). Alignment of the three ERGIC-53 ERSE-like sequences with ERSE of human genes responsive to ER stress (Fig. 1B) revealed differences in the downstream region (excluding the 5′-CCAAT box). In addition, five sites had a high affinity for transcription factors of the SP family of proteins (Fig. 1A), and the ERGIC-53 promoter lacked known transcription initiation sequences (Fig. 1A). Thus, we attempted to isolate the ERGIC-53 minimal inducible promoter by measuring the activity of the firefly luciferase reporter gene driven by deletion mutants lacking the three ERSE-like sequences we had identified (Fig. 2A). Expression vectors were transfected in HeLa cells treated or not with TG. The 1036-bp region containing all three putative ERSE enhanced luciferase expression 3.61 ± 0.98-fold in TG-treated cells (Fig. 2A, right). Deletions of the –335 to –317 and –278 to –259 ERSE-like sequences reduced the basal activity in untreated cells, but the -fold induction was retained in the –149 to –1 region (Fig. 2A, right) that contains the –62 to –35 ERSE-like motif (Fig. 1A). With the three intact ERSE-Is, TG caused a 6.2 ± 1.12-fold increase in the expression of the control Grp78/BiP promoter. Thus, the minimal inducible region was retained in the –149 to –1 region. This region could initiate transcription in response to various ER stress inducers (Fig. 2B), giving a -fold induction of the reporter gene of 4.2 ± 0.49 with TG, 3.24 ± 0.62 with the reducing agent DTT, and 2.14 ± 0.38 with proteasome inhibitor MG132. In contrast, the undeleted Grp78/BiP promoter enhanced luciferase activity in response to TG and DTT by 6.79 ± 0.72- and 6.72 ± 0.78-fold, respectively and by 4.98 ± 0.52-fold in response to MG132. Finally, the activity of the –149 to –1 ERGIC-53 promoter was consistent with the -fold ERGIC-53 mRNA induction by TG as measured by real time RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 2C), indicating that the –149 to –1 region (Fig. 2A, right) that contains a single ERSE-like is sufficient to ensure higher ERGIC-53 mRNA levels in response to TG treatment. UPR Regulates ERGIC-53 Transcription by Means of a Single ERSE—To identify the ERSE within the –149 to –1 region, we first compared the luciferase activity of this region with that of the –149 to –63 deletion mutant that lacks the putative ERSE (Fig. 3A). Deletion mutants were placed upstream from the SV40Luc vector to drive the expression of the luciferase reporter gene. As expected, reporter assays confirmed that the –149 to –1 region conferred thapsigargin-mediated activation of the SV40Luc vector and enhanced the activity of reporter gene by 2.50 ± 0.08-fold. Conversely, the ERSE-lacking mutant (–149 to –63) was inactive in thapsigargin-treated cells, which indicates that the putative ERGIC-53 ERSE is located within the –63 to –1 region of the promoter (Fig. 3A). Thus, we mapped the boundaries of the ERGIC-53 ERSE, by investigating the capacity of the –65 to –31 and –32 to –1 deletion mutants to confer TG-mediated activation to the SV40Luc reporter vector (Fig. 3B). We also compared the activity of ERGIC-53 promoter deletions with that of the reporter gene under the control of the ERSE-I consensus sequence (20Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 21Roy B. Lee A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1437-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The results of luciferase assays showed that the ERGIC-53 ERSE spans from nucleotide –65 to nucleotide –31 of the promoter. In addition, the -fold induction of the SV40Luc vector driven by the ERGIC-53 ER"

NOSs first hydroxylate l-arginine to Nω-hydroxy-l-arginine (NOHA). This intermediate then becomes a substrate for the second reaction, which produces l-citrulline and NO. To carry out these two reactions, the heme iron at the active site of NOSs must first be reduced to be able to bind molecular oxygen (O2) and to form an oxygenated complex (FeIIO2). The electron is supplied by NADPH via the reductase domain in mammalian NOSs and from an independent reductase for the bacterial NOSs (6Wang Z.Q. Lawson R.J. Buddha M.R. Wei C.C. Crane B.R.

The FeIIO2 complex must then be activated to form the oxidizing intermediate that oxidizes the substrates (l-arginine and NOHA). The hydroxylation of l-arginine requires an additional external electron initially supplied by tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B) to allow oxygen activation. Oxygen activation is thought to occur via a mechanism similar to that proposed for cytochrome P450 and to involve a Compound I intermediate defined as an oxyferryl (FeIV=O) heme with an associated radical (2Alderton W.K.

A second proton is then recruited, leading to the heterolytic cleavage of the O–O bond and the formation of a water molecule and a Compound I-type intermediate. Unlike the hydroxylation of l-arginine, the conversion of NOHA to NO and citrulline requires only a transiently supplied electron to activate the heme-bound O2. Many mechanisms for the hydroxylation of NOHA have been put forward (8Rosen G.M. Tsai P. Pou S. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 1191-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 11Huang H. Hah J.M.

In general, it has been suggested that an activated form of the oxygenated complex (peroxy or hydroperoxy), produced after the transfer of an electron from H4B, can perform an electrophilic attack on the guanidino carbon of NOHA to form a tetrahedral intermediate that undergoes conversion to l-citrulline and NO with a concomitant electron donation back to H4B (14Wei C.C. Wang Z.Q. Hemann C. Hille R. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46668-46673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). NOSs likely evolved two different mechanisms of oxygen activation to oxidize their two substrates in the first and second catalytic cycles, respectively. Interactions between the oxygen atoms of the FeIIO2 complex and the substrates, together with the electron/proton donor properties of the cofactor, likely play critical roles in determining how NOSs catalyze these reactions. Although H4B has been more extensively characterized, including its involvement as an electron donor in the first and second reactions (10Stuehr D.J. Wei C.C. Wang Z. Hille R.

We used stopped-flow spectrophotometry and continuous-flow resonance Raman spectroscopy to probe the FeIIO2 complex of Staphylococcus aureus NOS (saNOS) with the substrate l-arginine (23Chartier F.J.M. Blais S.P. Couture M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9953-9962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Our results showed that l-arginine binding causes a downshift in the frequency of the νO–O mode but has no effect on the frequency of the νFe–O mode (23Chartier F.J.M. Blais S.P. Couture M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9953-9962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A similar downshift of the νO–O frequency has also been reported for the oxygenated complex of mammalian neuronal NOS (nNOS) (24Rousseau D.L. Li D. Couture M. Yeh S-R. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2005; 99: 306-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Analysis of the kinetics of formation and decay of the FeIIO2 complex revealed that l-arginine stabilizes the complex against autoxidation to the ferric form in saNOS. These findings indicate that hydrogen-bonding interactions involving the heme-bound O2 and l-arginine stabilize the FeIIO2 complex against autoxidation. Hydrogen-bonding interactions also decrease the frequency of the νO–O mode by modulating the amount of π -backbonding from the heme iron (23Chartier F.J.M. Blais S.P. Couture M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9953-9962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To complement our first study of the FeIIO2 complex of saNOS in the presence of l-arginine (23Chartier F.J.M. Blais S.P. Couture M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9953-9962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we now report an investigation of the interactions of the FeIIO2 complex in the presence of NOHA for saNOS and Bacillus subtilis NOS (bsNOS) by resonance Raman spectroscopy. Specifically, we report the frequencies of the νO–O and νFe–O modes of NOHA-bound saNOS and bsNOS as well as of l-arginine-bound bsNOS. Differences in the frequencies of the νFe–O and νO–O modes were observed in the presence of NOHA with respect to those measured with l-arginine, indicating that the hemebound O2 is involved in substrate-specific interactions in both NOSs. The implications of these results for the mechanisms of oxygen activation by NOSs are discussed. Materials—H4B and NOHA were purchased from Sigma. Argon and 16O2 gas were from Praxair, Inc. (Mississauga, ON, Canada). 18O2 gas (99% purity) was from ICON (Mt. Marion, NY). Enzyme Preparation—saNOS and bsNOS were expressed in Escherichia coli from the cloned genes and purified as described previously (25Chartier F.J.M. Couture M. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 1939-1950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 26Chartier F.J.M. Couture M. Biochem. J. 2007; 401: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Samples were maintained in 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dl-dithiothreitol. Where indicated, NOHA (500 μm) was added to the purified enzymes. For samples containing H4B, a concentration of 500 μm was used. The association of H4B and NOHA with saNOS and bsNOS and that of l-arginine with bsNOS were monitored by measuring the displacement of dl-dithiothreitol bound to the ferric enzymes by optical spectroscopy (25Chartier F.J.M. Couture M. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 1939-1950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Stopped-flow Spectroscopy—Stopped-flow experiments were carried out as described previously (23Chartier F.J.M. Blais S.P. Couture M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9953-9962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, anaerobic protein samples (5 μm) were reduced with the minimum amount of sodium dithionite required to reduce the heme. Complete reduction of the sample was verified by optical spectroscopy. Rapid mixing experiments with reduced saNOS and bsNOS and molecular oxygen were carried out at 21 °C. O2 gas (100%) was used to saturate anaerobic buffer with O2. This solution was then used to prepare buffers of the specified oxygen concentrations. The kinetics of formation and decay of the FeIIO2 complex were followed at individual wavelengths in kinetic scanning mode. Kinetic traces were recorded at 5-nm intervals from 380 to 460 nm and from 515 to 610 nm, which generated optical spectra versus time data sets. The kinetic data were analyzed using SPECFIT global analysis software (Spectrum Software Associates, Chapel Hill, NC) with a kinetic model involving four states for the data obtained from saNOS and bsNOS saturated with NOHA: state A corresponded to the initial reduced protein; state B corresponded to the transient FeIIO2 complex; state C corresponded to an intermediate; and state D corresponded to the resting ferric form. For the data obtained from bsNOS saturated with l-arginine, a three-state model was used: state A corresponded to the initial reduced protein; state B corresponded to the transient FeIIO2 complex; and state C corresponded to the resting ferric form. The deconvoluted optical spectra, the fits at all wavelengths, and the time course of the appearance and decay of the four kinetic states were obtained from these analyses. Resonance Raman Spectroscopy—Resonance Raman spectra of the oxygenated intermediates were acquired with a custom-made continuous-flow T-mixer as described previously (23Chartier F.J.M. Blais S.P. Couture M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9953-9962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Prior to mixing, the reduced forms of saNOS and bsNOS (80 μm) were prepared by equilibrating the enzymes with pure argon gas for at least 30 min at room temperature and by adding the minimum amount of sodium dithionite required to reduce the heme completely. Optical spectra in the visible region (from 450 to 700 nm), recorded directly from the 10-ml syringe containing the reduced proteins, were recorded to assess the complete reduction of the protein. Pure 16O2 and 18O2 gases were used to prepare oxygenated buffers of known concentrations. The rapid mixer was made anaerobic using a 10 mm sodium dithionite solution, followed by washing with anaerobic buffer to remove the dithionite. Oxygenated buffers (16O2 and 18O2 in two separate mixing experiments) and the reduced proteins were mixed at a 1:1 ratio from 10-ml syringes. The output at 441.6 nm from a helium-cadmium laser (Liconix laser, Melles Griot, Ottawa, Ontario) at ∼10 milliwatts was focused on the sample inside the channel of the quartz flow cell. The resonance Raman spectra of saNOS/NOHA/H4B and saNOS/NOHA samples were acquired 4.5 and 10 ms after mixing, respectively, using previously described equipment (25Chartier F.J.M. Couture M. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 1939-1950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Those of bsNOS/l-Arg and bsNOS/NOHA were acquired 22 and 32 ms after mixing, respectively. Several 30-s spectra (12Cho K-B. Gauld J.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 10267-10270Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 13Cho K-B. Gauld J.W. J. Phys. Chem.

All resonance Raman spectra were obtained at room temperature (25 °C) and were calibrated with the lines of indene. The spectrum of reduced myoglobin was recorded before each experiment to check for small calibration differences on different days. The spectrum of the buffer was also recorded for each experiment to subtract the quartz diffraction signal originating from the detection tube of the continuous-flow mixer. Stopped-flow Spectroscopy—Stopped-flow optical spectroscopy was used to obtain the rates of formation and decay of the FeIIO2 complex of saNOS in the presence of NOHA (without H4B) (Fig. 1). The kinetics of formation and decay of the FeIIO2 complex of saNOS in the presence of NOHA and H4B have already been reported (Table 1) (23Chartier F.J.M. Blais S.P. Couture M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9953-9962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Reduced saNOS saturated with NOHA was mixed with O2-saturated buffer. The data were acquired by kinetic scanning in the 380–460 nm (Soret region) (Fig. 1A) and 515–610 nm (supplemental Fig. 1) regions of the absorption spectrum. These kinetic scanning data were first studied by global analysis using a three-state sequential kinetic model (A → B → C). The three-state model did not fit the data properly (supplemental Fig. 2), and inconsistent rates were calculated from the two optical region data sets.TABLE 1Rates of formation and decay of the oxygenated complexes of saNOS at 21 °C and the wavelength maxima of the Soret absorption bands of the oxygenated complexesProteinRate of FeIIO2 formationRate of decay (fraction)aThe rate of decay corresponds to autoxidation when catalysis cannot occur, i.e. with either the substrate or H4B absent.

Open table in a new tab A four-state model (A → B → C → D) best fit the data and produced consistent results in both regions of the absorption spectrum (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. 1). The kinetic traces recorded at 430 and 450 nm and the corresponding fits to the four-state model are shown in Fig. 1B. These wavelengths show that four states are indeed needed to fit all the transitions observed. The residuals of the fits at all wavelengths were small in amplitude and randomly distributed (Fig. 1C), indicating that a good fit to the four-state model was obtained. State A, with a Soret optical transition centered at 410 nm, corresponded to reduced saNOS (Fig. 1E, solid line) and reacted with molecular oxygen at a rate of 230 s–1 to form the FeIIO2 complex (state B), which had a Soret absorption maximum centered at 425 nm (Fig. 1E, dashed line; and Table 1). State B was identified as an FeIIO2 complex from the isotope shifts induced by 16O2 and 18O2 in the resonance Raman spectra (see below). The FeIIO2 complex subsequently decayed at a rate of 34 s–1 to an intermediate (state C), which had a broad Soret band (Fig. 1E, dotted line). This intermediate may be composed of a mixture of several states. Finally, the enzyme returned at a rate of 1.6 s–1 to the resting ferric state, which had a Soret optical transition at 400 nm (Fig. 1E, dotted/dashed line; and Table 1). In the 515–610 nm region (Fig. 1F), reduced saNOS had a wavelength absorption maximum centered at 552 nm (solid line); the FeIIO2 complex had two maxima near 556 and 570 nm (dashed line); state C had one maximum at 554 nm (dotted line); and the ferric form, which is five-coordinate and high spin, did not have any strong absorption maximum in this optical region (dotted/dashed line). Notably, the absorption bands at 550 and 580 nm observed in the stopped-flow mixing experiments of O2 with reduced saNOS saturated with NOHA and H4B (23Chartier F.J.M. Blais S.P. Couture M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9953-9962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), which are characteristic of the FeIIINO complex, were not observed here. Previous studies have shown that an FeIIINO complex is not formed in single turnover experiments from NOHA with pterin-free NOSs (27Boggs S. Huang L. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2332-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 28Adak S. Aulak K.S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 33554-33561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), thus supporting the crucial role for H4Bin the synthesis of NO from NOHA. Our studies are no exception. We detected NO synthesis as an FeIIINO complex in single turnover experiments with saNOS/NOHA/H4B (23Chartier F.J.M. Blais S.P. Couture M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9953-9962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), but not with NOHA alone (Fig. 1). Therefore, even though the rate of decay of the oxygenated complexes of saNOS/NOHA is only moderately increased in the presence of H4B (Table 1), the presence of H4B is nevertheless necessary to observe the FeIIINO complex in the course of the reactions of saNOS/NOHA with O2, thus implying that it is necessary for NO synthesis. Resonance Raman Spectroscopy in the High Frequency Region of the FeIIO2 Complex—To characterize the oxygenated complexes of saNOS with NOHA and H4B and with NOHA alone, we used a custom-made continuous-flow mixer with a dead time of 0.5 ms (23Chartier F.J.M. Blais S.P. Couture M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9953-9962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The high frequency region of the resonance Raman spectra was first obtained to determine the oxidation and spin states of the FeIIO2 complex. The spectra were recorded at 4.5 and 10 ms after mixing reduced saNOS/NOHA with the O2-saturated buffer in the presence and absence of H4B, respectively. At these times, the FeIIO2 complexes had reached maximum concentrations of 81 and 72% of the heme available for saNOS/NOHA with (23Chartier F.J.M. Blais S.P. Couture M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9953-9962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and without H4B (Fig. 1D), respectively. The spectra showed that the oxidation state marker band ν4 was at 1374 cm–1 and that the coordination and spin state marker band ν3 was at 1501 cm–1 in samples with H4B (Fig. 2, traces A and B) and without H4B(traces C and D). The FeIIO2 complexes of saNOS/NOHA and saNOS/NOHA/H4B were thus ferric and low spin like the oxygenated complexes of other heme proteins (24Rousseau D.L. Li D. Couture M. Yeh S-R. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2005; 99: 306-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 30Sjodin T. Christian J.F. Macdonald I.D. Davydov R. Unno M. Sligar S.G. Hoffman B.M. Champion P.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6852-6859Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The shoulder on the ν4 mode at 1349 cm–1 and the small intensity ν3 mode at 1468 cm–1 indicated that a small amount of reduced five-coordinate saNOS was present, likely the remains of starting material predicted to correspond to 12 and 11% of the reaction mixtures at 4.5 and 10 ms following the initiation of the reactions based on the kinetic data with NOHA/H4B (23Chartier F.J.M. Blais S.P. Couture M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9953-9962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and NOHA (Fig. 1D), respectively. These assignments are supported by the resonance Raman spectra of saNOS/NOHA obtained later after the initiation of the reactions (Fig. 3). At 56 ms (Fig. 3, trace B) and 81 ms (trace A) after mixing, the ν3 and ν4 lines of reduced saNOS were no longer observed, unlike the 10 ms spectrum (trace C). These results are consistent with stopped-flow data indicating that no reduced form remained at those times (Fig. 1D). Also consistent with stopped-flow data, the spectrum obtained at 81 ms displayed a ν3 line at 1488 cm–1, which corresponded to ferric five-coordinate saNOS and which represented 8% of the heme at that time. Also, at 81 ms, state C had reached its maximum concentration. Our results show that, with a ν4 line at 1372 cm–1 and a ν3 line at 1501 cm–1, this intermediate was mostly six-coordinate and low spin. Isotopic substitution was used to identify an oxygen-sensitive mode in the high frequency region. The 16O2-minus-18O2 difference spectra of saNOS/NOHA/H4B (Fig. 2, trace E) and saNOS/NOHA (trace F) revealed the presence of single isotope-sensitive lines at 1135 cm–1 with 16O2 and 1070 cm–1 with 18O2. These lines corresponded to the νO–O mode, as the isotopic shift of 65 cm–1 was on par with the value expected for an O–O diatomic harmonic oscillator. The frequency was the same as that of substrate-free saNOS (Table 2). These results demonstrate that NOHA and H4B did not change the frequency of the νO–O mode with respect to that of the FeIIO2 complex of substrate-free and pterin-free saNOS at 1135 cm–1 (Table 2). However, the line at 1135 cm–1 was significantly sharper in the spectrum of the FeIIO2 complex with NOHA (width at a half-height of 20 cm–1) than in that of substrate-free saNOS (width at a half-height of 22 cm–1). In the 16O2-minus-18O2 difference spectrum of saNOS/NOHA recorded 81 ms after mixing (Fig. 2, trace G), the intensity of the νO–O line was much lower than at 10 ms (trace F), indicating that only a small amount of the FeIIO2 complex remained after 81 ms, which was expected based on the stopped-flow data (Fig. 1D).TABLE 2Frequencies of the νFe–O and νO–O modes of saNOS, nNOS, iNOS, and P450camProteinνFe–O (18O2)νO–O (18O2)Ref.cm-1cm-1saNOS517 (487)1135 (1071)23Chartier F.J.M.

We expressed Bad in mouse embryonic fibroblasts to sensitize them to apoptosis, and tested cell lines derived from knock-out mice to establish the significance of the interaction between the adaptor protein Grb10 and the Raf-1 protein kinase in anti-apoptotic signaling pathways targeting Bad. When compared with wild-type cells, both Grb10 and Raf-1-deficient cells exhibit greatly enhanced sensitivity to apoptosis in response to Bad expression. Structure-function analysis demonstrates that, in this cellular model, the SH2, proline-rich, and pleckstrin homology domains of Grb10, as well as its Akt phosphorylation site and consequent binding by 14-3-3, are all necessary for its anti-apoptotic functions. As for Raf-1, its kinase activity, its ability to be phosphorylated by Src on Tyr-340/341 and the binding of its Ras-associated domain to the Grb10 SH2 domain are all necessary to promote cell survival. Silencing the expression of either Grb10 or Raf-1 by small interfering RNAs as well as mutagenesis of specific serine residues on Bad, coupled with signaling inhibitor studies, all indicate that Raf-1 and Grb10 are required for the ability of both the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and MAP kinase pathways to modulate the phosphorylation and inactivation of Bad. Because total Raf-1, ERK, and Akt kinase activities are not impaired in the absence of Grb10, we propose that this adapter protein creates a subpopulation of Raf-1 with specific anti-apoptotic activity.

The best known models for receptor-mediated anti-apoptotic cascades include interleukin-3 signaling in hematopoietic cells and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) 3The abbreviations used are: IGF, insulin-like growth factor; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase; IRES, internal ribosomal entry site; PH, pleckstrin homology domain, PR, proline-rich domain; IGF-1R; insulin growth factor 1 receptor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; SH2, Src homology domain 2; FBS, fetal bovine serum; HEK, human embryonic kidney; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; Gpp(NH)p, guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate.3The abbreviations used are: IGF, insulin-like growth factor; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase; IRES, internal ribosomal entry site; PH, pleckstrin homology domain, PR, proline-rich domain; IGF-1R; insulin growth factor 1 receptor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; SH2, Src homology domain 2; FBS, fetal bovine serum; HEK, human embryonic kidney; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; Gpp(NH)p, guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate. signaling in fibroblasts. To date, several distinct anti-apoptotic signaling pathways have been characterized (1Baserga R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 2LeRoith D. Roberts Jr., C.T.

A second anti-apoptotic pathway is the mitogenic MAPK cascade that is characterized by the sequential activation of the Raf, MEK, ERK, and p90RSK kinases (5Bonni A. Brunet A. West A.E. Datta S.R.

Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7203-7215Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) have identified an additional IGF-1R-dependent pathway that requires the mitochondrial relocalization of a complex containing a 14-3-3 protein, the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4, and the Raf-1 kinase (6Peruzzi F.

One of the end points of these signaling pathways is the serine phosphorylation and inactivation of the Bcl-2 protein family member Bad (7Downward J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E33-E35Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation event is followed by the binding of Bad to 14-3-3 proteins and its sequestration in the cytoplasm, thus preventing it from inactivating the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL on the mitochondrial surface (8Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2246) Google Scholar). Several serine residues have been identified as sites for Bad-inactivating phosphorylation; Akt promotes cell survival by phosphorylating serine 136 (9Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H.

Phosphorylation on any of these serine residues appears sufficient to permit binding to 14-3-3 isoforms (13Datta S.R. Katsov A. Hu L. Petros A. Fesik S.W. Yaffe M.B. Greenberg M.E. Mol.

Grb10 is a member of a superfamily of adaptor proteins that includes Grb7 and Grb14 (15Margolis B. Silvennoinen O. Comoglio F. Roonprapunt C. Skolnik E. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8894-8898Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 16Ooi J. Yajnik V. Immanuel D. Gordon M. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Margolis B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1621-1630PubMed Google Scholar); these share a common overall structure, including an N-terminal region harboring a conserved proline-rich motif, a central plekstrin homology (PH) domain, a C-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, and a conserved region located between the PH and SH2 domains (the BPS) that has been shown to act as a pseudosubstrate for the kinase domain of receptor-tyrosine kinases (17Depetris R.S. Hu J. Gimpelevich I. Holt L.J. Daly R.J. Hubbard S.R. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 325-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Extensive experimentation directed at understanding the possible roles of Grb10 in regulating the metabolic and mitogenic responses to insulin and IGF-1 has indicated a multitude of functions both positive and negative (18Holt L.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 393-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 19Lim M.A. Riedel H. Liu F. Front. Biosci. 2004; 9: 387-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 20Riedel H. Front. Biosci. 2004; 9: 603-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In particular, several lines of evidence implicate Grb10 in apoptosis including an extensive list of cell survival-related binding partners such as the IGF-1 receptor, Raf-1, MEK1, and Akt kinases, the p85 subunit of the PI3K, the 14-3-3 adaptor protein, and the Nedd4 ubiquitin ligase (20Riedel H. Front. Biosci. 2004; 9: 603-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 21Urschel S. Bassermann F. Bai R.Y. Muench S. Peschel C. Duyster J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16987-16993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of a Grb10 protein containing an inactivating mutation in its SH2 domain promotes apoptosis in transfected cells (22Nantel A. Mohammad-Ali K. Sherk J. Posner B.I. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10475-10484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation clearly demonstrate that most of the endogenous Grb10 protein is peripherally associated with the mitochondria, the organelle that is at the center of the apoptosis control machinery, and that these molecules transiently relocalize to the plasma membrane following receptor activation. Finally, the endogenous Grb10 and Raf-1 proteins can be co-immunoprecipitated from mitochondrial extracts, an interaction that is enhanced following the activation of Raf-1 by ultraviolet radiation (23Nantel A. Huber M. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35719-35724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Overall, an important component of Grb10 function in cell survival appears to be dependent on its relationship with the Raf-1 kinase. The Raf proteins are highly conserved serine-threonine protein kinases that transmit signals between a wide range of cell surface receptors and the MAPK cascade that contains the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK). Activated Ras binds to Raf with high affinity and mediates its translocation from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, where kinase activation occurs via phosphorylation (24Marshall M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed a new role for the Raf-1 kinase that is independent of the activation of the MAPK cascade and whose effect is to increase resistance to apoptosis (25Baccarini M. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 783-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 26Huser M. Luckett J. Chiloeches A. Mercer K. Iwobi M. Giblett S. Sun X.M. Brown J. Marais R. Pritchard C.

Hori M. Otsu K. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 937-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The importance of Raf-1 as an apoptotic modulator was greatly reinforced by the phenotype of mouse raf-1 knock-outs. Raf-1-deficient embryos die in gestation and show increased apoptosis in several tissues, whereas a cardiac-specific deletion ultimately leads to heart failure also linked to excess apoptosis. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) isolated from Raf-1-/- embryos are more sensitive to apoptosis induced by Fas, etoposide, and staurosporine. Surprisingly, activation of the MAPK pathway in Raf-1 knockouts remained unchanged, possibly due to redundancy provided by the isoforms A-Raf and B-Raf (26Huser M. Luckett J. Chiloeches A. Mercer K.

In this report, we use a novel in vivo assay to measure the effectiveness of anti-apoptotic signaling pathways and demonstrate that the interaction between the adaptor Grb10 and kinase Raf-1 is important for cell survival. Generation and Analysis of Grb10-/- Mice and Cell Lines—Generation of Grb10/LacZ knock-in mice expressing the bacterial β-galactosidase cDNA under the transcriptional control of the endogenous Grb10 promoter has been performed by conventional gene targeting methodology. Briefly, a XbaI-XhoI genomic fragment of mGrb10 was isolated (positions 11808-5675 relative to AL663087) to generate the required homology arms for successful targeting. At the unique SmaI site at position 10,155 (and position 340 relative to the mGrb10 cDNA BC016111), a cassette containing (from 5′ to 3′) stop codons in all three reading frames, an IRES-LacZ-pA element, and finally a floxed PGK-NeoR-bpA was inserted. Correctly targeted ES clones were verified by Southern analysis with external 5′ and 3′ probes and used to generate mutant mice by standard techniques. The resulting mice phenocopy two other mutants that are functionally null for the imprinted gene Grb10, a retroviral insertion mutant of Grb10 (30Charalambous M. Smith F.M. Bennett W.R. Crew T.E. Mackenzie F. Ward A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8292-8297Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), and a mouse that inherits a paternal disomy for proximal chromosome 11 (31Cattanach B.M. Shibata H. Hayashizaki Y. Townsend K.M. Ball S. Beechey C.V. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1998; 80: 41-47Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primary mouse epithelial fibroblasts were produced from day 13 mouse embryos (day of plug = day 1) from appropriate crosses. After dissection, embryos were washed twice in sterile phosphate-buffered saline solution. Embryos were decapitated, eviscerated, and then passed several times through an 18-gauge needle. Each embryo was resuspended in 1 ml of 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml DNase and 500 μg/ml collagenase. Subsequent to triturating, embryos were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and centrifuged at 1,200 × g for 5 min. Ultimately, each disassociated embryo was plated in a 100-mm dish in 10% FBS in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin. Six independent pools of Grb10+/+ and Grb10-/- MEF cell lines were produced from two primary mouse epithelial fibroblasts lines from each genotype by spontaneous immortalization over a period of 6 weeks. All showed similar growth rates and activation profiles of the ERK and Akt kinases following serum treatment. Transcriptional profiles, as determined with DNA microarrays, were similar within the same genotypes and, in a comparison of the Grb10+/+ with Grb10-/- cells, did not show any significant changes in the levels of transcripts encoding known regulators of mitochondrial apoptosis (data not shown). Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney 293A (HEK293A) cells and the human breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF-7 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Hyclone) containing 10% FBS (Hyclone), whereas MEF were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose (Hyclone) containing 10% FBS. A human breast adenocarcinoma cell line MDA-MB231, purchased from ATCC, was grown in RPMI 1640 (Hyclone) medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Raf-1 knock-out, and the wild-type control MEF cell lines were kindly provided by Dr. C. Pritchard (University of Leicester, UK) (26Huser M. Luckett J. Chiloeches A. Mercer K. Iwobi M. Giblett S. Sun X.M. Brown J. Marais R. Pritchard C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1940-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Grb14 knock-out with their wild-type control MEFs were a kind gift from Dr. R. J. Daly (Garvan Institute of Medical Research, St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, Australia) (32Cooney G.J. Lyons R.J. Crew A.J. Jensen T.E. Molero J.C. Mitchell C.J. Biden T.J. Ormandy C.J. James D.E. Daly R.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 582-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Expression Constructs and Transfection Methods—Mouse Grb10δ (mGrb10δ) and Raf-1 kinase (mRaf-1) were cloned from cDNA prepared from MEF cells mRNA, using the Expand Long Template PCR System® (Roche), subcloned into pcDNA 3.1myc/his plasmid (Invitrogen), and sequenced. Mouse Bad cDNA, kindly provided by Dr. G. Shore (McGill Cancer Center, McGill University, Montreal, Canada), was subcloned into the biscistronic vector pIRES-hrGFP-1a (Stratagene). Point mutations into mGrb10δ, mRaf-1, and Bad were performed using the QuikChange® multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mammalian GST-Bad construct, pEBGmBad was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Deleted constructs were generated by overlapping PCR (33Mayer B.J. Jackson P.K. Van Etten R.A. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 34Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6809) Google Scholar), subcloned into pcDNA 3.1myc/his plasmid (Invitrogen), and sequenced. The HA-tagged human Grb10 construct subcloned into pcDNA3 was provided by Dr. S. Giorgetti-Peraldi (INSERM U145, Institut Federatif de Recherche 50, Faculté de Médecine, Nice, France). Transient transfections of these constructs in HEK293 and MEF cells were performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations, using Superfect® transfection reagent (Qiagen). In Fig. 4, following transfection MEFs were treated with 150 nm Src Inhibitor I (Calbiochem), 10 nm of the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin, or 5 μm of the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 (Cell Signaling Technology) and respective cell lysates were processed for Western blotting. Fluorescence Microscopy—Phase-contrast and epifluorescence images were taken using a Leica DMIRE2 inverted microscope (Leica Microsystems Canada) equipped with a Hamamatsu cooled CCD camera at ×200 or 400 magnification, using the appropriate filters. Openlab software (Improvision, MA) was used for image acquisition. For each field, 2 separate pictures were taken: phase-contrast and green fluorescence (for imaging the cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)). Apoptotic Sensitivity Assay—MEF were seeded in 6-well plates and transiently transfected with 0.5 μg of either of the empty reporter vectors (pIRES-hrGFP-1a or vectors) containing the various pIRES-Bad-hrGFP constructs. Alternatively, we also cotransfected pIRES-Bad-hrGFP with 0.3 μg of expression plasmids containing the various tagged Raf-1 or Grb10 genes. 16-18 h post-transfection, GFP-positive cells were visualized microscopically and apoptotic cells were distinguished from live cells based on their morphology; small, round, blebbing, and/or floating cells were scored as apoptotic, whereas flat adherent cells were scored as normal. Hoecht staining confirmed that these rounded/blebbing cells also contained condensed and fragmented nuclei, another hallmark of apoptosis (not shown). Unless otherwise indicated the data presented are the mean ± S.D. of four independent experiments. Immunoblotting, Immunoprecipitation, and Pull-down Experiments—Transfected HEK293A and MEF were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche) and Phosphatase Mixtures I and II (Sigma). All lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g. Raf-1 (E10), Grb10 (K20), c-myc (9E10), and actin antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotech. Bad Ser-112, Bad Ser-136, Bad Ser-155, and Bad antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology. Monoclonal antibody to HA was produced in our monoclonal antibody facility and was a kind gift of Anne Marcil (BRI-NRC, Montreal, Canada). For immunoblotting, total cell lysates (50 μg of protein) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto either nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After incubation with appropriate primary antibodies, signals were revealed by chemiluminescence (Roche) using corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. For co-immunoprecipitations, 1 mg of clarified lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 3 μg of anti-c-myc monoclonal antibody. Immune complexes were collected on protein L-agarose (Sigma), washed five times in lysis buffer, and processed for immunoblotting. Cell lysate from MEFs overexpressing mammalian GST-Bad alone or with either mycRaf-1 or mycGrb10δ were subjected to an overnight GST pull down at 4 °C. Following several washes with lysis buffer, proteins were eluted from beads and processed for Western blotting using phosphoserine-specific Bad antibodies. Small Interfering RNA—MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 cells plated at a density of 0.5 to 1 × 105 cells per well in six-well plates were transfected with 2 μm small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligoduplexes using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The sequences of each oligoduplex targeting specifically human Grb10 (hGrb10) and human Raf-1 (hRAF-1) genes were as followed: hGrb10, 5′-CAAAAUUCUCUGACCUGAUdTdT-3′ duplexed with AUCAGGUCAGAGAAUUUGGdTdT-3′, and hRAF-1, 5′-AGCAAAGAACAGUGGUCAAdTdT-3′ duplexed with 5′-UUGACCACUGUUCUUUGCUdTdT-3′. Silencing was assessed 48 h post-transfection by Western blotting using specific Grb10 and Raf-1 antibodies. Alternatively, Grb10 or Raf-1 knocked down cells were rescued with either mouse Grb10δ (mGrb10δ) or mouse Raf-1 (mRaf-1) cDNA, respectively, 24 h following siRNA transfection. Transfection of both human Grb10-specific oligos with its respective human cDNA targets, i.e. MychGrb10, lowered the expression of the transfected human mycGrb10 constructs, whereas the same oligos transfected with the mouse mycGrb10 did not alter the expression of the mouse Grb10 construct. The same experiments were performed with Raf-1 oligos (data not shown). Bad-dependent Apoptotic Sensitivity in MEFs—To directly measure the effectiveness of signaling pathways leading to cell survival in cell lines lacking the Grb10 adaptor protein, we developed an assay to evaluate apoptotic sensitivity based on the expression of the pro-apoptotic modulator Bad. We have generated transgenic mice lacking functional Grb10 due to a LacZ insertion in the first coding exon of the Grb10 locus. Pups and newborn mice with an inactivated maternal Grb10 allele exhibited the same enhanced growth phenotype previously described by others (30Charalambous M. Smith F.M. Bennett W.R. Crew T.E. Mackenzie F. Ward A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8292-8297Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). MEF originating from both wild-type and Grb10 knock-in mice express low levels of endogenous Bad (Fig. 1A). Transfection of small amounts of bicistronic Bad vector in which the expression of Bad is driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter and the expression of the GFP cistron is directed by an internal ribosomal entry site sequence, allowed us to study its regulation in these knock-out-derived cell lines. Microscopic examination of transfected MEFs was used to evaluate the percentage of apoptotic cells in the GFP-positive population 16-18 h post-transfection (Fig. 1A). Hoescht staining for the nucleus integrity revealed that apoptotic cells are round and detached, whereas healthy cells are flat and attached to the cell plate (data not shown). Sensitivity to apoptosis is presented as the ratio of scored apoptotic cells over total number of transfected cells. Grb10-/- MEFs are more sensitive than wild-type to Bad expression and this pro-apoptotic phenotype can be reverted by expressing the wild-type gene (Fig. 1, A and B). Protective effect of Grb10δ overexpression was achieved with 0.3-0.5 μg of cDNA transfected. As an additional control, Bad-mediated cell death assays were performed in MEFs lacking Grb14, an adaptor protein structurally related to Grb10 and belonging to the Grb7 superfamily (32Cooney G.J. Lyons R.J. Crew A.J. Jensen T.E. Molero J.C. Mitchell C.J. Biden T.J. Ormandy C.J. James D.E. Daly R.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 582-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 35Daly R.J.

Cell Signal. 1998; 10: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These showed no change in Bad-dependent apoptotic sensitivity when compared with wild-type cells, thus confirming the specific role of Grb10 in cell survival (data not shown). Moreover, activation of the anti-apoptotic Akt and ERK kinases upon serum, IGF-I, or epidermal growth factor stimulation remained the same in these MEFs (data not shown). To determine which domain modules of Grb10 were required for its anti-apoptotic activity, several mutants, illustrated in Fig. 1C, were tested in the Bad-mediated cell death assay (Fig. 1D). Constructs carrying deletions in the proline-rich (PR) and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains as well as a point mutation in a conserved arginine residue that is necessary for the SH2 domain to recognize its ligands (22Nantel A.

Finally, Fig. 1E shows that mutagenesis of serine 428 to alanine, an Akt phosphorylation site known to promote the interaction of Grb10 to 14-3-3 (21Urschel S. Bassermann F. Bai R.Y. Muench S.

Overall these results demonstrate that Grb10 promotes cell survival, and that its binding to other molecules through the SH2 domain, the PR region, as well as the PH domain, is essential for proper anti-apoptotic signaling.

We recently identified cytochrome c as a cellular activity that catalyzes the formation of oleamide from oleoyl-CoA and ammonium ion, in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (21Driscoll W.J. Chaturvedi S. Mueller G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22353-22363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the course of characterizing this activity, we examined glycine as a potential nitrogen donor. We report here that cytochrome c catalyzes the formation of N-oleoylglycine from oleoyl-CoA and glycine. This discovery highlights the potential importance of cytochrome c as a mechanism for the generation of both long chain fatty acyl glycines and long chain primary fatty acid amides. This possibility is relevant to understanding the biochemistry of sleep, thermal regulation, nociception, and also apoptosis, where cytochrome c exhibits unique catalytic activities that mediate programmed cell death (22Kagan V.E.

Radiochemicals and Chemicals—[glycine-1-14C]Oleoylglycine (4.1 mCi/mol) was prepared as a custom synthesis by PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [1-14C]Oleoyl-CoA (53 mCi/mmol) was purchased from GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ. Rat and yeast cytochrome c, equine myoglobin, H2O2, glycine, fatty acyl-CoAs, and other laboratory reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Oleoylglycine was purchased from Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI. The rat cytochrome c was determined to be homogeneous as described in Ref. 21Driscoll W.J. Chaturvedi S. Mueller G.P. J. Biol.

Assay for Oleoylglycine-synthesizing Activity and Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC)—Assays for oleoylglycine synthesis were performed at 37 °C in 100 μl 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing the desired amounts of cytochrome c (or myoglobin or hemoglobin), glycine, H2O2, and [14C]oleoyl-CoA (see Ref. 21Driscoll W.J. Chaturvedi S. Mueller G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22353-22363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Reactions were terminated by the addition of 5 μl of 1 n HCl and extracted with 4 volumes of ethyl acetate. The organic layer was collected, dried under nitrogen, solubilized in 25 μl of ethanol and spotted to heat-desiccated (45 min at 95 °C) Silica Gel G Uniplates™ (Analtech, Newark, DE). TLC plates were developed (1 h) using chloroform/methanol/glacial acetic acid, 90:10:1. Data were visualized using a FAL-5100 phosphorimager (FUJIFILM, Stamford, CT), and quantitative image analysis was performed with Multi Gauge V3.0 software (FUJIFILM). Data are expressed as percent conversion of oleoyl-CoA substrate to oleoylglycine product calculated on the basis of a defined amount of radiolabeled oleoylglycine standard run on each plate. Reverse Phase HPLC—Separations were carried out at 45 °C on a 4.6 × 250 mm Luna 5μ C8 column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) using a series 1100 HPLC (Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, DE) operated at 1 ml/min. The column was equilibrated with 50% solvent A (5% acetonitrile in water; 0.005% trifluoroacetic acid) and 50% solvent B (5% water in acetonitrile; 0.005% trifluoroacetic acid). Samples and standards were solubilized in 50 μl of ethanol for injection. Following sample injection, initial conditions were maintained for 5 min followed by a linear gradient to 100% B over 10 min. The system was maintained at 100% B for 10 min and returned to initial conditions over 5 min. Elution profiles were monitored at 205 nm. Fractions were collected and dried by lyophilization. Mass Spectrometry—Mass fragmentation analysis was performed by electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry (MS) using a Q-Star®XL quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA). Oleoylglycine standard and lyophilized HPLC samples were first dissolved in 100% ethanol, adjusted to 50% acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid and infused into the ionization source (5,500 volts) at a rate of 10 μl per minute. Parent ions were identified and fragmented to produce product ions while preserving a small amount of parent ion. Confirmation of parent ion masses was established for each sample by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MS using gentisic acid matrix and a Voyager™ MALDI-TOF DE STR instrument (Applied Biosystems) operated in positive ion reflectron mode. Synthesis of Oleoylglycine by Cytochrome c—Fig. 1 presents the time course for the formation of oleoylglycine by cytochrome c. Rat cytochrome c was incubated with oleoyl-CoA, glycine, and H2O2 for the times indicated. Panel A presents a representative TLC analysis of the reaction products observed. Radioactive bands that co-migrated with [14C]oleoylglycine standard (arrow, right lane) intensified overtime to a maximum signal by 10 min. Panel B is the graphic presentation of the oleoylglycine TLC data obtained through quantitative image analysis. Further investigations revealed that the loss of activity after 10 min was due to oxidative damage caused by exposure of the protein to H2O2. Specifically, preincubation of cytochrome c with H2O2 resulted in a loss of enzymatic activity, loss of antibody reactivity by Western analysis, change of mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and loss of signature ion mass on MALDI-TOF MS (data not shown). Oleoylglycine-synthesizing Activity of Cytochrome c: Comparison with Other Heme-containing Proteins—Fig. 2, panel A, demonstrates the dependence of oleoylglycine production on cytochrome c at submicellar (20 μm) and micellar (250 μm) concentrations of oleoyl-CoA. A threshold for oleoylglycine synthesis was observed at ∼40 nm cytochrome c per reaction at both substrate concentrations. Above this threshold the production of oleoylglycine by cytochrome c demonstrated essentially a log-linear relation up to a maximum. The formation of oleoylglycine product at 20 μm oleoylglycine substrate was maximal a 640 nm cytochrome c, because of exhaustion of oleoyl-CoA substrate. In contrast, maximum production of oleoylglycine at 250 μm oleoyl-CoA was 10-fold greater. Panel B presents a comparison of the oleoylglycine synthetic activity of rat and yeast cytochrome c to bovine hemoglobin and equine myoglobin, and the effect of H2O2 on these activities. The basal levels of oleoylglycine synthetic activity observed for rat and yeast cytochrome c in the absence of H2O2 were 4–5-fold greater than those observed for hemoglobin and myoglobin. The addition of H2O2 increased the oleoylglycine synthetic activity of rat and yeast cytochrome c by ∼19- and 9-fold, respectively, whereas hemoglobin and myoglobin remained essentially inactive. Therefore, the ability of cytochrome c to robustly synthesize oleoylglycine is not shared by heme-containing proteins in general. Optimal Reactant Concentrations for Oleoylglycine Synthesis by Cytochrome c—Fig. 3 shows the concentration dependence for oleoyl-CoA, glycine, and H2O2 on the formation of oleoylglycine by cytochrome c. Reactions were performed at optimal, fixed concentrations of two of the reactants with varied concentrations of the third. Data are expressed as a percent of maximum conversion of oleoyl-CoA to oleoylglycine for each experiment. Untransformed data are given in the figure legend. Panel A shows the dose response for increasing concentrations of oleoyl-CoA. The reaction was maximal at ∼100 μm oleoyl-CoA and half-maximal at ∼30 μm. Additional analyses of similar experiments using saturating concentrations of oleoyl-CoA confirmed a Km of ∼30 μm for oleoyl-CoA (not shown). It should be noted that oleic acid does not serve as a substrate for oleoylglycine synthesis by cytochrome c. Panel B shows the results of a similar experiment in which concentrations of glycine were varied. Glycine became saturating at ∼300 mm, and half-maximal activity was achieved at ∼40 mm glycine. The effects of increasing concentrations of H2O2 on oleoylglycine formation by cytochrome c are presented in panel C. In comparison to oleoyl-CoA or glycine, H2O2 exhibited a broad range of concentration effect. Half-maximal conversion was observed at ∼60 μm H2O2. At concentrations 10 mm and above, H2O2 reduced the formation of oleoylglycine as compared with maximum conversion observed over the range of 1–3 mm. As discussed above, the decrease in activity observed at higher H2O2 concentrations was caused by oxidative damage caused by H2O2 itself. The findings presented in panels A, B, and C are representative of results of at least three independent experiments. Verification of Oleoylglycine as a Cytochrome c Reaction Product—The identity of oleoylglycine as an enzymatic product was confirmed by HPLC and mass spectral fragmentation analysis. Reaction products were isolated by solvent extraction and reverse phase HPLC from large scale syntheses using non-radioactive oleoyl-CoA and either glycine or isotopically labeled glycine-13C2. The peak eluting at the retention time of oleoylglycine standard (18.6 min; Fig. 4, panel A) was analyzed by ESI MS/MS and MALDI-TOF MS as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Both ESI and MALDI-TOF analyses revealed that the most prominent peaks in the spectra exhibited the correct masses for oleoylglycine and 13C2-labeled oleoylglycine at m/z 340.53 and 342.54, respectively (confirmatory MALDI-TOF results not shown). These peaks were absent from the HPLC effluents (18.6 min) of negative control reactions. Panel B presents the fragmentation spectrum for commercially obtained oleoylglycine standard. Signature ions in the spectrum include oleoylglycine parent ion (m/z 340.53), glycine daughter ion (m/z 76.07), and glycine immonium ion (m/z 30.04). Additionally, the series of ions differing by 14 amu reflects products of varying lengths of the alkane chain. Panel C shows the fragmentation spectrum for cytochrome c-synthesized oleoylglycine. It is qualitatively identical to that of standard oleoylglycine (panel B). Substitution of glycine-13C2 for glycine in the synthesis reaction (panel D) produced oleoylglycine parent and glycine daughter ions that were two mass units heavier (m/z 342.54 and m/z 78.08, respectively) than those observed for unlabeled oleoylglycine. The glycine immonium ion was one mass unit heavier (m/z 31.04) than its 12C counterpart (m/z 30.03). These data provide unequivocal evidence for the synthesis of oleoylglycine by cytochrome c from oleoyl-CoA and glycine. Oleoylglycine Synthesis by Cytochrome c Demonstrates Specificity for Long Chain Fatty Acyl-CoA Substrates—A substrate specificity study was conducted using varying chain length acyl-CoAs as competing substrates against [14C]oleoyl-CoA. The data presented in Fig. 5 show that acyl-CoAs with chain lengths of 16 carbons or more were the most effective competitors. Interestingly, octanoyl-CoA, while not as potent as the longer chain acyl-CoAs, was able to inhibit oleoylglycine synthesis. MALDI-TOF MS was used to confirm that palmitoyl glycine, stearoyl glycine, and arachidonyl glycine were, in fact, generated from their respective CoA substrates by cytochrome c (data not shown). The diverse chemical nature and biologic importance of lipid signaling molecules became appreciated with the discovery of the prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and thromboxanes. Recently, long chain fatty acyl glycines have been recognized as a potential new class of lipid messengers. Prototype members of this class include oleoylglycine and arachidonoyl glycine, which occur naturally (1Merkler D.J. Chew G.H. Gee A.J. Merkler K.A. Sorondo J.P. Johnson M.E.

Toxicol. 2006; 46: 101-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), the actions of fatty acyl glycines are likely to be mediated through G-protein-coupled receptors, as has been recently reported for arachidonoyl glycine (4Kohno M. Hasegawa H. Inoue A. Muraoka M. Miyazaki T. Oka K. Yasukawa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 347: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). While long chain fatty acyl glycines exhibit distinct pharmacologic properties, their in vivo functions and regulation remain to be defined. An understanding of the biosynthetic pathway for long chain fatty acyl glycines will help to advance knowledge in these areas. Toward this goal, the present report documents the ability of cytochrome c to catalyze the formation of oleoylglycine utilizing oleoyl-CoA, glycine, and H2O2 as reactants. Previous investigations revealed cytochrome c as a cellular activity capable of catalyzing the synthesis of oleamide from oleoyl-CoA and ammonia, in the presence of H2O2 (21Driscoll W.J. Chaturvedi S. Mueller G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22353-22363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This finding suggested that a primary amine might substitute for ammonia. In exploring this possibility we discovered that glycine effectively supports the formation of oleoylglycine by cytochrome c. The reaction exhibits a similar time course, reactant concentration optima, preference for long chain acyl-CoAs and Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to oleoyl-CoA, as was observed for the generation oleamide ((21Driscoll W.J. Chaturvedi S. Mueller G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22353-22363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar); Table 1).

Chem. 1985; 260: 7573-7580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicates that the present findings involving varying concentrations of fatty acyl-CoAs (Figs. 2, 3, and 5) were not influenced by either the absence or presence of micelle formation.TABLE 1Reaction characteristics for enzymatic synthesis of oleoylglycine and oleamide by cytochrome cParameterOleoylglycine synthesisOleamide synthesisKm for oleoyl-CoA30 μm21 μm[H2O2] concentration optimum2 mm2 mm[Amine] concentration optimum300 mm125 mmpH optimum7.57.5Temperature optimum35-50 °C35-50 °CChain length specificity for fatty acyl-CoAsYesYes Open table in a new tab While incomplete, our working model predicts that oleoyl-CoA binds to cytochrome c with a geometry that places the thioester adjacent to the heme center. In this position the iron can accept an electron liberated by the nucleophilic attack of glycine at the thioester bond. In this mechanism, Fe3+ is reduced to Fe2+ and subsequently reoxidize to Fe3+ by H2O2. This model is supported by evidence that cytochrome c exhibits: (i) high binding affinity for long chain fatty acyl-CoA molecules (26Stewart J.M. Blakely J.A. Johnson M.D. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 78: 675-681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), (ii) peroxidase enzymatic activity (27Zhao Y. Wang Z.B. Xu J.X. J. Biol.

The present findings indicate that cytochrome c provides a possible mechanism for the glycination of unsaturated long chain fatty acyl-CoAs in vivo. Cytochrome c may therefore have a central role in the generation of oleoylglycine, which either can act independently (3Chaturvedi S. Driscoll W.J. Elliot B.M. Faraday M.M. Grunberg N.E. Mueller G.P. Prostaglandin Other Lipid Mediat. 2006; 81: 136-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), or serve as a substrate for the generation of oleamide (1Merkler D.J. Chew G.H. Gee A.J. Merkler K.A. Sorondo J.P. Johnson M.E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12667-12674Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The ability of cytochrome c to catalyze the formation of bioactive lipid messengers may be relevant to the process of apoptosis where cytochrome c is liberated from the mitochondria and becomes catalytically active (see Refs. 22Kagan V.E. Tyurin V.A. Jiang J. Tyurina Y.Y. Ritov V.B. Amoscato A.A. Osipov A.N. Belikova N.A. Kapralov A.A. Kini V. Vlasova I.I. Zhao Q. Zou M. Di P. Svistunenko D.A. Kurnikov I.V. Borisenko G.G. Nat. Chem.

In this regard the formation of oleamide, either directly by cytochrome c or via the conversion of oleoylglycine by PAM (1Merkler D.J. Chew G.H. Gee A.J. Merkler K.A. Sorondo J.P. Johnson M.E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12667-12674Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) could play an important role in defining the extent of an apoptotic event. Under pathologic conditions including myocardial infarction and stroke, apoptotic molecules can be inappropriately transmitted from cell-to-cell (14Ito A. Morita N. Miura D. Koma Y. Kataoka T.R.

Res. 2004; 61: 386-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This process of bystander killing appears to result from a failure of gap junctions to close. Because oleamide normally inhibits gap junction communication (7Boger D.L. Patterson J.E. Guan X. Cravatt B.F. Lerner R.A. Gilula N.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4810-4815Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 13Guan X. Cravatt B.F. Ehring G.R. Hall J.E. Boger D.L. Lerner R.A. Gilula N.B. J.

Carcinogenesis. 2004; 25: 2015-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and presumably, bystander killing, it is possible that the spread of apoptosis across healthy networks of cells results, at least in part, from a failure in the synthesis or actions of oleamide. Preliminary experiments conducted in our laboratory using cultured HeLa cells and staurosporine to induce apoptosis have revealed that oleamide synthesis is indeed up-regulated in this paradigm. 4G. Mueller and W. Driscoll, unpublished observations. In addition to apoptosis, lipid messengers generated by cytochrome c may serve in more conventional roles of intercellular communication. Immunoreactive cytochrome c is concentrated in secretory granules (35Soltys B.J. Andrews D.W. Jemmerson R. Gupta R.S. Cell Biol. Int. 2001; 25: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), structures also known to contain PAM (5Eipper B.A. Stoffers D.A. Mains R.E. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1992; 15: 57-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). This subcellular localization raises the possibility that cytochrome c may generate oleoylglycine for regulated secretion or subsequent conversion to oleamide by PAM. Finally, the possibility that the generation of oleoylglycine occurs within mitochondria remains to be established. We have also verified that, in addition to glycine, cytochrome c will catalyze the conjugation of other selected, but not all, amino acids with oleoyl-CoA. Further, cytochrome c effectively utilizes other primary amines and other long chain fatty acyl-CoAs as substrates (Ref. 21Driscoll W.J. Chaturvedi S. Mueller G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22353-22363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). 4G. Mueller and W. Driscoll, unpublished observations. Accordingly, cytochrome c exhibits the potential to generate a diverse spectrum of lipid signaling molecules as well as precursor substrates for other bioactivating enzymes such as PAM. We thank Dr. David Grahame for helpful discussion concerning possible enzymatic mechanisms for cytochrome c."
https://openalex.org/W2042412051,"Engagement of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) by its signal transduction ligands evokes inflammatory cell infiltration and activation of the vessel wall. However, soluble RAGE (sRAGE), the truncated form spanning the extracellular binding domain of RAGE, has potent anti-inflammatory properties by acting as a decoy for RAGE ligands. We now show that sRAGE binds with high affinity to atherogenic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) modified by hypochlorous acid (HOCl), the major oxidant generated by the myeloperoxidase-H2O2-chloride system of phagocytes activated during inflammation. We further demonstrate that sRAGE can be coprecipitated with HOCl-LDL from spiked serum. To determine the functional significance of sRAGE binding to HOCl-LDL, cell association studies with macrophages were performed. sRAGE effectively inhibited cellular uptake of HOCl-LDL and subsequent lipid accumulation. Using Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing class B scavenger receptor CD36 or SR-BI, two preferential scavenger receptors for HOCl-LDL, we demonstrate that sRAGE only interferes with CD36-mediated uptake of HOCl-LDL. The present findings indicate that sRAGE acts as a sink for HOCl-LDL, which is abundantly present in human atherosclerotic lesions. We propose that sRAGE represents a physiological antagonist that interferes with scavenger receptor-mediated cholesterol accumulation and foam cell formation of macrophages."

Overexpression of POSH induces apoptosis in a variety of cell types, but apoptosis can be prevented by co-expressing the pro-survival protein kinase Akt. We report here that POSH is a direct substrate for phosphorylation by Akt in vivo and in vitro, and we identify a major site of Akt phosphorylation as serine 304 of POSH, which lies within the Rac-binding domain. We further show that phosphorylation of POSH results in a decreased ability to bind activated Rac, as does phosphomimetic S304D and S304E mutation of POSH. S304D mutant POSH also shows a strongly reduced ability to induce apoptosis. These findings identify a novel mechanism by which Akt promotes cell survival.

(Plenty of SH3 domains) is a recently discovered pro-apoptotic protein that appears to be widely expressed in multiple cell types, although at low levels. POSH was first identified as a binding partner of activated Rac and has been shown to act as a scaffolding protein in a kinase cascade signaling pathway that leads to apoptotic cell death (1Tapon N. Nagata K.-I. Lamarche N. Hall A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1395-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 2Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In this pathway, Rac activates one of the mixed lineage kinases (MLKs, a group of MAPKKKs), which in turn phosphorylate and activate MKK4 and/or MKK7 (which are MAPKKs) which then phosphorylate and activate c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs, one group of MAPKs) (2Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Activated JNKs induce release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and trigger subsequent apoptosis. POSH directly binds Rac, MLK, and another scaffold protein, JIP (JNK-interacting protein), which in turn binds MKK4/7 and JNK, to facilitate this pathway. This multiprotein signaling assembly has been termed PJAC, for POSH-JIP apoptotic complex (3Kukekov N.V. Xu Z. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15517-15524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The role of POSH as a scaffold for this signaling complex appears to be critical; in an apoptotic model involving withdrawal of nerve growth factor from cultures of neuronally differentiated PC12 cells or rat primary sympathetic neurons, apoptosis was dramatically reduced by pretreatment with POSH short interfering RNA or antisense oligonucleotides (4Zhang Q.G. Wang R.M. Yin X.H. Pan J. Xu T.L. Zhang G.Y. J. Neurochem. 2005; 95: 784-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The decision of a cell to undergo apoptosis is not undertaken lightly; apoptotic pathways are subject to regulation at many levels, and cells must integrate a variety of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic signals. Regulation of the PJAC apoptotic pathway appears to follow this pattern, with multiple regulatory interactions. One form of regulation of PJAC may lie in the expression level of POSH protein within cells. POSH is maintained within healthy cells at very low levels, at least in part by POSH auto-ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (5Kim G.H. Park E. Kong Y.Y. Han J.K. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Increasing the level of POSH protein by microinjection or ectopic expression induces apoptosis in a variety of cell types (1Tapon N. Nagata K.-I. Lamarche N. Hall A.

Another potential regulator of the POSH-JIP apoptotic complex appears to be the pro-survival kinase Akt, also known as protein kinase B. Three closely related Akt genes exist (AKT1–3) that have both significant functional overlap as well as specific unique functions (10Bellacosa A. Franke T.F. Gonzalez-Portal M.E. Datta K. Taguchi T.

Recently a direct binding interaction between POSH and Akt2 was described, in which binding of Akt2 to POSH prevents MLK3 binding and thereby inhibits PJAC assembly and apoptotic signaling by JNK. This binding interaction was found to be specific to Akt2; Akt1 showed no such binding to POSH (23Figueroa C. Tarras S. Taylor J. Vojtek A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47922-47927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, despite this isoform-specific interaction of Akt2 and POSH, activated Akt1 is fully able to protect cells from apoptosis induced by overexpression of POSH (1Tapon N. Nagata K.-I. Lamarche N. Hall A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1395-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 2Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Thus, the precise physiologic importance of this isoform-specific interaction is unclear. It is also unclear whether Akt in general opposes POSH-induced apoptosis at the level of the PJAC complex or at more downstream sites. Furthermore, it has yet to be addressed whether Akt might regulate PJAC function by directly phosphorylating POSH and, if so, how this might affect POSH function. These questions are the subject of this study. Cell Culture—HEK293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. MDA-MB-231 cells were grown in the same media, additionally supplemented with 1 mm l-glutamine, minimum Eagle's medium nonessential amino acids, and 10 ng/ml insulin. Fetal bovine serum was obtained from HyClone (Logan, UT). All other media components were obtained from Invitrogen. DNA Constructs and GST-POSH Fusion Proteins—Human POSH cDNA was cloned by RT-PCR as follows. RNA was isolated from HEK293 cells using Trizol, as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen), and used to prepare first strand cDNA using murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with oligo(dT) as primer. This cDNA was then used as template in two different PCRs to separately amplify the 5′- and 3′-halves of POSH, which were subsequently reassembled using the internal BamHI site. The 5′-half of POSH was amplified by PCR using the primers POSH-5′-R1 (GGCG GAA TTC ACT AGT ACC ATG GAT GAA TCA GCC TTG) and POSH-(1303–1326) (CCG TAA ATG TGC TTA CTG GTC AGT). The product of this reaction contains engineered EcoRI and SpeI sites at the 5′-end and included the endogenous BamHI site. The 3′-half of POSH was amplified using POSH-5′-(1273–1296) (ATG GGA CCG AGG CCC ATG GCA) and POSH-myc-Not (GCG TGC GGC CGC TCA CAG GTC CTC CTC GCT GAT) to generate a product containing the endogenous BamHI site at its 5′-end and extending to include the remaining coding sequence, followed by an engineered Myc epitope tag, and a NotI site. The two POSH fragments were then subcloned and reassembled to generate a full-length Myc-tagged cDNA. The resulting cDNA was entirely sequenced and confirmed to be in agreement with GenBank™ sequences for human POSH. To generate GST-POSH fusion proteins in mammalian cells, the Myc-tagged POSH cDNA described above was subcloned into the vector pEBG-SrfI (a generous gift from Yusen Liu (24Chen P. Hutter D. Liu P. Liu Y. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 24: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar)), using SpeI and NotI sites, to generate pEBG-POSH. To generate full-length GST-POSH fusion proteins in Escherichia coli, the C-terminal Myc epitope tag was replaced with a 6-histidine tag using the primer POSH-3′-6His (GG CGC AGC GGC CGC TCA ATG ATG ATG ATG ATG ATG CGT CGA CTC TAT GTT TTC CAC AAA GCT), and the fragment was subcloned into pGEX4T-1 (GE Healthcare) using EcoRI and NotI sites to generate pGEX-POSH-6H. A series of smaller GST-POSH fusions were also constructed and contained the amino acid residues of POSH as indicated: GST-POSH-(53–888), GST-N-POSH-(1–434), GST-C-POSH-(444–888), GST-POSH-SH3-1-(130–197), GST-POSH-SH3-2-(196–260), GST-POSH-SH3-3-(444–509), GST-POSH-SH3-4-(825–888), GST-POSH-RBD (Rac-binding domain, 292–362), and GST-POSH-linker-(53–134). These fusions were constructed by PCR using primers that inserted an EcoRI site immediately before the first amino acid of POSH indicated, and a stop codon followed by an XhoI site immediately after the last amino acid of POSH indicated. Those constructs that extended to the C terminus of POSH (residue 888) were made using the primer POSH3′6His and as such encoded a six-histidine tag following residue 888, followed by a stop codon and an NotI site, rather than XhoI. PCR products were cloned into pGEX4T-1 using EcoRI and XhoI or NotI sites, and the resulting plasmids were completely sequenced. GST-POSH fusion proteins were produced from E. coli (BL21-CodonPlus-RIL, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), containing the corresponding pGEX-POSH plasmids by growing the cells to log phase at 37 °C, and then induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h at 30 °C. GST-POSH proteins were purified from cell lysates by affinity chromatography with glutathione-agarose (GE Healthcare), as described previously (25Kassenbrock C.K. Hunter S. Garl P. Johnson G.L. Anderson S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24967-24975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). GST-POSH proteins containing a six-histidine tag were additionally purified by affinity chromatography with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). To construct GFP-POSH, this same EcoRI, NotI fragment was first cloned into pBS-KS(-) and then cut back out with EcoRI and SacII. This EcoRI, SacII fragment was then cloned into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) to generate pGFP-POSH. pcDNA3.1 myr-Akt1 was generously provided by Dr. Philip Tschilis. pcDNA3.1 myr-Akt2 was generated in our laboratory as follows. Human Akt2 cDNA was cloned by RT-PCR using cDNA prepared from HEK293 cells as described above and the primers myr-Akt2-HA F primer (ATC GAT AAG CTT ATG GGT TCT TCT AAA TCT AAA CCT AAA AAT GAG GTG TCT GTC ATC AAA GAA GGC) and myr-Akt2-HA-R (GAT ATC ACT AGT TCA GGC ATA GTC GGG CAC GTC ATA GGG ATA CTC GCG GAT GCT GGC CGA). The product of this reaction encodes a protein with a myristoylation sequence at the N terminus and a hemagglutinin epitope tag at the C terminus and was subcloned into the vector pCDNA3.1(+), using engineered HindIII and EcoRV sites. The resulting plasmid was sequenced and confirmed to be in agreement with GenBank™ sequences for human Akt2. Microinjections—MDA-MB-231 cells were counted and plated at a density of 1 × 10 5 cells per 35-mm dish the day before micro-injections were to take place. The cells were injected with a control vector encoding GFP (pEGFP-C1, Clontech) or pGFP-POSH, plus or minus pcDNA3.1-myr-Akt1 or myr-Akt2. In some experiments separate vectors encoding GFP (pEGFP-C1) and POSH (pcDNA-POSH), rather than a GFP-POSH fusion protein, were employed and gave similar results. The concentration of each DNA was 0.25 μg/μl. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive cells were counted 4 h post-injection. 18 h following injection GFP-positive cells were again examined, assessed for viability/apoptotic changes, and quantitated. Cells were visualized using an Axiovert 200 MOT microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY). Fluorescence images were captured using a Hamamatsu ORCA ER CCD camera run by Openlab (Improvision, Lexington, MA). Transfections and Western Immunoblotting—Transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate method, as described by Xu and Greene (26Xu Z. Greene L.A. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 406: 479-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), with HEK293T cells plated at 30,000/cm2 in 10-cm dishes 20–24 h prior to transfection, and fresh growth medium was added 3–4 h before transfection. Transfected cells were lysed 18–24 h later in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1.0% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with protease inhibitors (catalog number 1 697 498, Roche Applied Science). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 30 min at 13,000 × g at 4 °C, and protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (Pierce). 1 mg of lysate protein was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads in binding buffer (50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4) overnight at 4 °C with rocking to recover GST-POSH. The beads were pelleted and washed three times with binding buffer. The proteins were then solubilized in SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to Immobilon-P (Millipore, Bedford, MA) for immunoblotting. Antibodies used in immunoblots are as follows: anti-phospho-Akt substrate antibody (PAS) was obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies, anti-GST antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), monoclonal anti-Rac antibody was from Sigma, and anti-POSH antibody was a generous gift of Dr. Yuval Reiss (Proteologics, Rehovot, Israel). Horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies were obtained from Bio-Rad and visualized by chemiluminescence (Western Lightning, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). In Vitro Kinase Reactions—1 μg of purified GST or GST-POSH protein was incubated with 20 ng of active Akt1 (Upstate catalog number 14-276, Millipore) or Akt2 (Upstate catalog number 14-447) in 40 μl of a kinase buffer consisting of 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% Brij-35, and 0.25 mm ATP. For experiments involving 32P, ATP was reduced to 0.1 mm, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP was added. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h and terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer, followed by boiling. Phosphopeptide Analysis by Mass Spectrometry—5 μg of GST-POSH-(53–888) was phosphorylated in vitro with either Akt1 or Akt2 as described above. After the reaction GST-POSH was recovered on glutathione-Sepharose beads and washed twice in 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Thesit, followed by one wash in 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm DTT. Bound proteins were then denatured and reduced by boiling for 5 min in the above buffer containing 1% SDS. Samples were cooled and alkylated by the addition of iodoacetamide to a final concentration of 10 mm for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. Samples were then diluted 5-fold with 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm CaCl2, 2% Thesit and digested with 0.5 μg of trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega, Madison, WI) overnight at 37 °C. Acetic acid was then added to 0.25 m followed by acetonitrile to 30%, and the tryptic digests were incubated with 10 μl of immobilized Fe3+ resin (PHOS-Select, Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature with rotation. Fe3+ beads were recovered by centrifugation, washed three times with 250 mm acetic acid, 30% acetonitrile, once with H2O, and then eluted with 0.4 m NH4OH. Eluted peptides were analyzed by high resolution MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry performed on a Bruker Ultraflex MALDI-TOF/TOF instrument. For identification of minor phosphorylation sites, 10 μg of S304A-GST-POSH-(1–888) was phosphorylated in vitro with either Akt1, Akt2, or no added kinase at 30 °C for 2 h, and the reaction products were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. The bands containing GST-POSH were excised and digested in-gel with trypsin, and phosphopeptides were recovered by binding to a titanium dioxide matrix, as directed by the manufacturer (Phos-trap, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Eluted peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, as above. Rac Binding—35S-Labeled L61Rac was prepared by in vitro transcription and translation using [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and the TnT T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System as described by the manufacturer (Promega), and used without further purification. For the phosphorylation time course experiment, kinase reactions were performed in duplicate containing 2 μg of purified GST-POSH-(53–888) protein and 40 ng of active Akt in 20 μl of 50 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm ATP. The reactions were set up on ice and transferred to 30 °C for varying times (0–60 min), following which the reactions were returned to ice, and 1 unit of apyrase was added to remove residual ATP. Glutathione-Sepharose (30 μl of 50% slurry in phosphate-buffered saline, 1% BSA, 0.1% Thesit) and 35S-labeled L61 Rac (1 μl, diluted 1:10 in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Thesit) were then added, and the reactions were rotated at 4 °C for 2 h to allow protein binding. The samples were then centrifuged, and the Sepharose pellets were washed four times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Thesit, to remove unbound protein. Washed samples were then resuspended in SDS sample buffer, followed by boiling. Aliquots of each sample were analyzed by scintillation counting, SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining and autoradiography, and SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with phospho-Akt substrate antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). For the experiments with Ser-304 mutants, binding reactions containing 5 μg of GST or full-length GST-POSH and 10 μg of BSA in 55 μl of 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1% Thesit were assembled on ice, and then 35S-L61-Rac and glutathione-agarose were added as above. Binding, washing, and further analysis were as above. Caspase Assays—24 h prior to transfection, MDA-MB-231 cells were plated at 20,000 cells/well in 96-well plates. The next day cells were transfected with pEBG or pEBG-POSH-S304 mutants using Superfect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to manufacturer's protocol. 24 h post-transfection, cells were lysed and assayed for caspase activity by the addition of 100 μl of Caspase-Glo® 3/7 reagent to each well according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Madison, WI). Reactions were done in triplicate, including no treatment, transfection vehicle alone, and vector alone controls. The contents of the wells were mixed using a plate shaker for 30 s and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Luminescence was measured using a luminometer. Akt Prevents POSH-induced Apoptosis—Overexpression of POSH induces apoptosis in a variety of different cell types, including Swiss 3T3 and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, neuronally differentiated PC12 cells, primary rat sympathetic neurons, and HEK293 cells (1Tapon N.

Neuron. 2002; 35: 697-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Here we examined the effects of POSH overexpression in an additional cell type, MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. These cells were chosen because they have low levels of endogenous activated Akt, 4S. M. Anderson and M. M. Richert, unpublished data. and we wished to examine POSH-induced death in the absence of activated Akt. Preliminary experiments indicated that transfection of POSH or a GFP-POSH fusion construct induced rapid cell death in MDA-MB-231 cells (not shown). In Fig. 1B we quantitate this effect by micro-injecting cells with an expression vector encoding either GFP or GFP-POSH and monitoring subsequent cell survival at 4 and 18 h after injection. Greater than 90% of cells injected with GFP-POSH undergo cell death by 18 h. As seen in other cell types, POSH-induced cell death in MDA-MB-231 cells appears to occur by apoptosis, as evidenced by cell rounding, increased refractivity, nuclear condensation, surface blebbing, and detachment from the plate (see Fig. 1A), whereas control cells injected with GFP alone do not show such morphological changes. However, when these cells are injected with both GFP-POSH and activated forms of either Akt-1 or Akt-2, apoptosis is dramatically reduced. These constitutively active Akt forms contain a myristoylation sequence (abbreviated as myr-Akt), which directs them to the plasma membrane and results in their activation. Similar results demonstrating rescue of POSH overexpressing neuronal PC12 cells by co-expression of myr-Akt-1 have also been reported (2Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Akt Directly Phosphorylates POSH—Akt interacts with several members of the PJAC complex to exert a variety of anti-apoptotic effects. We wanted to ask whether Akt might directly phosphorylate POSH. We examine this question in Fig. 2. In Fig. 2A HEK293T cells were transfected with pEBG-POSH, encoding a GST-POSH fusion protein, plus and minus an expression vector for myr-Akt1. Cells were treated with the caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD to prevent apoptosis. After 24 h the cells were lysed, and GST-POSH was recovered on glutathione-agarose. Analysis of recovered protein by Western blot using antibodies to GST shows similar levels of GST-POSH protein expression with and without Akt (Fig. 2A, lower panel, compare lanes 2 and 3). To examine possible POSH phosphorylation, we made use of a commercially available phospho-specific antibody that recognizes a variety of Akt substrates in their phosphorylated forms (PAS; Cell Signaling Technology). This PAS antibody shows strong reactivity with GST-POSH precipitated from cells co-expressing myr-Akt1, as compared with cells expressing GST-POSH alone (Fig. 2A, upper panel, compare lanes 2 and 3), indicating that expression of active Akt1 results in POSH phosphorylation in vivo. To confirm that POSH is directly phosphorylated by Akt1 (versus other kinases activated by Akt1), we attempted to reconstitute Akt phosphorylation of POSH in vitro, using purified proteins. A full-length GST-POSH fusion protein was produced in E. coli, purified, and incubated with purified preparations of active Akt1 or Akt2 in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Reaction products were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Fig. 2B shows the results of this experiment. It can be seen that full-length GST-POSH is indeed directly phosphorylated by both Akt1 and Akt2 in vitro, whereas GST alone is unmodified (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 5 and 6 with 2 and 3). Akt Phosphorylates POSH within the Rac-binding Domain—To investigate how phosphorylation might affect POSH function, we sought to identify the precise site(s) of POSH phosphorylation by Akt. Toward this end, we made use of a slightly truncated form of POSH lacking the RING domain (residues 1–52), because previous experiments had indicated that this form was more efficiently phosphorylated in vitro (not shown). GST-POSH-(53–888) was phosphorylated by either Akt1 or Akt2 and digested with trypsin, and phosphopeptides were recovered by immobilized Fe3+ affinity chromatography. Eluted peptides were then analyzed by high resolution MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, with the results presented in Fig. 3A. In both the Akt1- and the Akt2-phosphorylated samples, a total of four peaks were observed with m/z ratios that closely matched the values predicted for phosphopeptides derived from POSH. All correspond to peptides containing a single phosphate group derived from same region of POSH, residues 301–313 with the sequence KRHSFTSLTMANK. The four peaks observed correspond to phosphopeptides either containing or lacking the first lysine residue (Lys-301) and with the methionine residue (Met-310) either oxidized or unmodified. No other phosphopeptides were detected in this experiment, although additional studies have revealed several minor phosphorylation sites (described in more detail below). The large, unoxidized form of this peptide (m/z ratio of 1600.8) from the Akt2 sample was subjected to further analysis by fragmentation and tandem MS-MS, which is shown in Fig. 3B. This analysis yielded the predominant peak expected for loss of phosphate (observed m/z of 1503.1, predicted 1502.8), confirming the phosphorylation status of the peptide. This peptide contains four potential phosphorylation sites (KRHSFTSLTMANK), and the theoretical ion series expected for phosphorylation at each site were compared with the observed MS-MS spectrum. This analysis strongly supports serine 304 as the site of phosphate addition. For example, prominent peaks observed at m/z 491.3 and 638.4 are in excellent agreement with values expected for the b-Pi 4 and b-Pi 5 ions calculated for phosphorylation at Ser-304 (expected m/z of 491.3 and 638.4) but do not match any of the ions expected for phosphorylation at Ser-307, Thr-306, or Thr-309. Similarly, ion peaks are observed closely matching all expected positions in the y series assuming Ser-304 as the site of phosphorylation, whereas only partial y series matches are observed for the other possible sites. It is of interest that Ser-304 lies within the Rac-binding domain of POSH, previously identified as residues 292–362 (1Tapon N. Nagata K.-I. Lamarche N. Hall A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1395-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Akt Phosphorylates POSH at Multiple Sites—To determine whether Akt may phosphorylate POSH at other sites in addition to Ser-304, we constructed mutant forms of GST-POSH in w"
https://openalex.org/W2011007294,"We studied the regulation of murine CD80, a gene whose basal transcriptional status was characterized by the presence of a stalled RNA polymerase II complex on the promoter-proximal region. Stimulus-induced activation of productive elongation involved a complex interplay of regulated events that included a synergy between ordered cofactor recruitment. This cascade of recruitments was initiated through the engagement of transcription factor NF-κB, leading to the temporal association of histone acetyltransferases and the consequent selective acetylation of a transcription start site downstream nucleosome. This in turn culminated into the nucleosomal association of Brd4-associated P-TEFb, a protein complex containing kinase specific for serine 2 of Rbp 1, the largest subunit of the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. The consequent phosphorylation of serine 2 residues in CTD by CDK9 in the P-TEFb complex then facilitated escape of polymerase II into the productive elongation phase. Thus, the cooperative mechanisms that integrate between independent pathways characterize regulation of the elongation step of transcription, thereby providing another level at which specificity of gene regulation can be achieved.

Thus, the cooperative mechanisms that integrate between independent pathways characterize regulation of the elongation step of transcription, thereby providing another level at which specificity of gene regulation can be achieved. The transcription cycle involves distinct stages of preinitiation, initiation, promoter clearance, elongation, and termination. The vast majority of studies, however, have focused primarily on elucidating mechanisms regulating preinitiation and initiation. Although the subsequent steps of elongation and mRNA processing have received considerably less attention (1Shilatifard A. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1437-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), more recent findings are revealing the dynamic and regulated nature of these processes (2Sims R.J. II I Belotserkovskaya R. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2437-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 3Saunders A. Core L.J. Lis J.T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Thus, processivity of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) 3The abbreviations used are: Pol II, polymerase II; CTD, carboxyl-terminal domain; TS, transcription start site; RT, reverse transcription; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; siRNA, small interfering RNA; nt, nucleotide(s); LM, ligation-mediated; MNase, micrococcal nuclease. is now known to be regulated by a class of proteins collectively termed as transcription elongation factors. Regulation by such factors can either be active or passive, depending upon whether they affect the rate of catalysis by Pol II (2Sims R.J. II I Belotserkovskaya R. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2437-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of Rpb1, the largest subunit of Pol II, also represents a key player in regulating entry of the latter into the productive elongation phase. CTD consists of multiple repeats of the heptapeptide sequence YSPTSPS, and hyperphosphorylation of serine residues in this repeat region is a hallmark of the productive elongation phase of the transcription cycle (2Sims R.J. II I Belotserkovskaya R. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2437-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 4Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19009-19012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Ser2 and Ser5 residues of CTD have been identified as the major phosphorylation sites (5Palancade B. Bensaude O. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 3859-3870Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), whereas CDK7, CDK8, and CDK9 are the major CTD kinases (6Prelich G. Eukaryot. Cell. 2002; 1: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed that these two modifications can be detected differentially in the various regions of the gene and are associated with distinct stages of the transcription cycle (7O'Brien T. Hardin S. Greenleaf A. Lis J.T. Nature. 1994; 370: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 8Komarnitsky P. Cho E.J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 9Cheng C. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1961-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Here we examined the mechanism of regulation of expression of the murine CD80 gene from a newly identified transcription start site. CD80 is a key costimulatory molecule that is expressed primarily on the professional antigen presenting cells in an inducible manner (10Sharpe A.H. Freeman G.J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 116-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar). Previous studies on the murine CD80 promoter have identified the presence of two transcription start sites located at 315 (TS1) and 1742 (TS2) nucleotides upstream of the translation start site (11Selvakumar A. White P.C. Dupont B. Immunogenetics. 1993; 38: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 12Borriello F. Freeman G.J. Edelhoff S. Disteche C.M. Nadler L.M. Sharpe A.H. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5038-5048PubMed Google Scholar). Our present studies reveal the operation of a post-initiation mechanism of regulation involving a preassembled preinitiation complex and a stalled RNA polymerase II in the promoter-proximal regions. Importantly, the activation of transcription, marked by the release of stalled polymerase II, was preceded by a series of interlinked recruitment events that included transcription factor NF-κB, P/CAF, and CBP/P300 histone acetyltransferases and CDK9, a kinase specific for serine 2 of CTD. Thus, the cooperative and ordered recruitment of the protein cofactors served for the stimulus-dependent regulation of transcription elongation from this newly identified transcription start site. Cell Culture and Reagents—FO cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1× penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were stimulated by directly adding 10 μg/ml of the anti-CD40 antibody to the cells in complete medium. For the inhibition experiments, the cells were pretreated for 2 h prior to stimulation with either 300 μm capsaicin, cycloheximide (10 μg/ml), or 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosyl-benzimidazole (DRB) (50 nm) (purchased from Sigma). The source of the various antibodies used in this manuscript, as well as the sequences of primers used for the various experiments, are listed in supplemental Table S1. RNA Isolation and RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol (Invitrogen) and digested with RNase free DNase I prior to reverse transcription reaction. No RT control was performed for each preparation. The manufacturer’s instructions were followed for real time PCR using QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR kit, (Qiagen) and RT-PCR using a Qiagen One-Step RT-PCR kit. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—The ChIP procedure was carried out following the manufacturer’s instructions (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) with some modifications. Briefly, following specific stimulus, 3 × 106 cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C and quenched with 0.125 m glycine for 10 min at room temperature. Chromatin was sheared to an average size of <500 bp and precleared with protein A-agarose beads. The soluble chromatin was incubated overnight with 2–3 μg of antibody followed by incubation with the blocked beads. The immune complexes were collected by centrifugation and washed following the manufacturer’s protocol. Input and immunoprecipitated chromatin samples were reverse cross-linked by incubating at 65 °C overnight in presence of 200 mm NaCl. Following proteinase K digestion, DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. Precipitated DNA was diluted serially, analyzed by PCR consisting of 28–32 amplification cycles, and resolved on agarose gel. The antibodies and the primer sequences employed have been listed in supplemental Table S1. Nuclease Digestions, Ligation-mediated (LM)-PCR, Nucleosome Mapping, and KmnO4 Footprinting—Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) and restriction enzyme digestion followed by LM-PCR was performed as described previously (13Weinmann A.S. Plevy S.E. Smale S.T. Immunity. 1999; 11: 665-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The amplification cycles employed were 20 (restriction enzyme), 18 (DNase I), and 22 (MNase). Mononucleosomes were isolated from formaldehyde fixed cells as described previously (14Soutoglou E. Talianidis I. Science. 2002; 295: 1901-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) with the modification that nuclei were digested with 150 units of MNase at 37 °C for 30 min. For each Southern hybridization, 20 μg of purified MNase-digested DNA was used. KMnO4 treatment of the cells was performed at final concentrations of 2.5 and 5 mm with 2 min of incubation at room temperature. Following quenching with β-mercaptoethanol and piperidine cleavage, first strand synthesis was performed prior to ligation with unidirectional linker and LM-PCR. siRNA—Target specific siRNA were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. or Dharmacon Inc. and transfected using SuperFect kit (Qiagen) at 10 μg/5 × 106 cells as recommended by the manufacturer. The negative control siRNA was targeted against green fluorescent protein. After 24–48 h in culture, the cells were employed for respective experiments. Western blotting was performed to monitor the efficiency of transfection. CD40-dependent Up-regulation Of CD80 Is Initiated from a Novel Start Site—Fig. 1A provides a schematic representation of the murine CD80 promoter, indicating the positions of both TS1 and TS2. To examine induction of the murine CD80 transcript, we stimulated the plasmacytoma cell line, FO, with anti-CD40 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1B, accumulation of CD80 mRNA could be first detected by 5 h, with its levels continuing to increase thereafter. Parallel experiments where cells were treated with cycloheximide prior to stimulation revealed that induction of the CD80 transcript did not require de novo protein synthesis (supplemental Fig. S1A). To further characterize the transcript, we next performed RT-PCR using the two distinct primer pairs P1/P2 and P3/P4, illustrated in Fig. 1A, and designed to amplify the two anticipated transcripts originating from either TS1 or TS2. Amplification with both primer pairs was obtained (Fig. 1C), suggesting either that the product was selectively derived from TS2 or that it represented the sum of transcripts originating from both the initiation sites. To resolve between these two possibilities, we next performed a primer extension analysis using either the P2 or the P4 primer. A primer extension product was obtained with P2 (Fig. 1D, panel a) but not with the labeled P4 primer (Fig. 1D, panel b), suggesting that the CD40 mRNA preparation did not include a transcript originating from TS1. Interestingly, however, the primer extension product obtained with the P2 primer revealed a discrepancy in size of ∼70 nt from that expected for a transcript being generated from the previously described position of TS2 (12Borriello F. Freeman G.J. Edelhoff S. Disteche C.M. Nadler L.M. Sharpe A.H. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5038-5048PubMed Google Scholar) (illustrated as TS2* in Fig. 1A). This was further verified by 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends experiments wherein sequencing of the resultant product identified the correct position of TS2 to be located at 72 nt upstream of its previously described location (supplemental Fig. S1B). Additional validation of this finding was obtained through RT-PCR employing primers upstream of P1 (supplemental Fig. S1C). Importantly, the presence of a single extension product with primer P2 also rules out the presence of multiple start sites in this region. Thus, from the results described here, the correct position of TS2 appears to be –1814 nt with respect to the translation start site (Fig. 1A). Further, stimulation of FO cells with anti-CD40 specifically induces transcription of CD80 from this site. The TS2-proximal Promoter Is Organized into Three Translationally Positioned Nucleosomes—The chromatin environment represents at least one of the critical factors that exercise transcriptional control over a given gene (15Narlikar G.J. Fan H.Y. Kingston R.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the TS2-proximal region for its nucleosomal organization. Initial experiments involved a low resolution analysis where Southern blotting was performed on in vivo MNase-digested nuclear DNA. Seven independent probes spanning the promoter region from –3320 to –1086 nt (Fig. 2A, panel a) were employed after first ascertaining that they hybridize with comparable efficiency to a cloned fragment of the CD80 promoter. Three of these yielded a positive signal in Southern blot experiments, indicating that the corresponding regions in vivo were resistant to MNase digestion (Fig. 2A, panel b). In subsequent experiments, soluble chromatin was immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific to either histone H3, histone H4, or YY1 (the latter as a negative control). Immunoprecipitated DNA was then released by reverse cross-linking prior to subjecting it to dot blot hybridization with these seven probes. The hybridization profile obtained here (Fig. 2A, panel c) was similar to that observed in Fig. 2A (panel b), further supporting that the protection observed for these three regions likely derives from their organization into nucleosomes. By employing ligation-mediated PCR on mononucleosomal preparations, we were able to map the boundaries of these nucleosomes. Thus, these three nucleosomes, designated as 1, 2, and 3, could be positioned between –1395 to –1540, –2209 to –2354, and –2599 to –2744, respectively, relative to the translation start site (Fig. 2, B and C). To further confirm these positions, we also isolated DNA fragments from mononucleosome preparations that had first been immunoprecipitated with antibodies against either H3 or H4. Although these fragments yielded a PCR amplification product with primer pairs designed to amplify the 135-bp core nucleosome, this was not the case when any of the primers was substituted with one that was immediately outside the identified nucleosomal region (supplemental Fig. S1, E and F). Thus, these cumulative results establish the existence of three translationally positioned nucleosomes in the regions that flank TS2. Interestingly, stimulation of cells with anti-CD40 led to selective changes in acetylation status only at nucleosome 1, with no such change at nucleosomes 2 and 3. This was revealed from mononucleosome ChIP experiments employing antibodies directed against various acetylated derivatives of H3 and H4 histones. For nucleosome 1, acetylation at lysines 18, 23, and 27 of H3 were the first stimulation-induced events observed (Fig. 2D). Acetylation at lysines 9 and 14 was also detected by 4 h of stimulation, which then persisted over the remainder of the experiment. Finally, the lysine tail of H4 was found to be constitutively acetylated, although no further attempts were made to delineate the residues involved. Thus, stimulation of cells with anti-CD40 resulted in dynamic changes in acetylation status specifically at nucleosome 1. Polymerase Is Stalled at the TS2-proximal Region—To probe the mechanism by which anti-CD40 induces CD80 expression from TS2, we next examined for the recruitment of the basal transcription machinery. The cells were stimulated with anti-CD40 for varying times, and ChIP assays were performed using antibodies either against TATA-box-binding protein, TFIIB, or Pol II. Irrespective of the dilution employed, an equal and persistent signal was obtained with proximal promoter-specific primers for all the three antibodies (Fig. 3A). This suggested a constitutive occupancy by the basal Pol II machinery at the TS2-proximal promoter region. Constitutive occupancy of this promoter region could also be confirmed by in vivo DNase I footprinting experiments (supplemental Fig. S2A). Further, as shown in Fig. 3A, stimulation did not lead to any further increase in the extent of association of these proteins with the promoter. These ChIP experiments were subsequently repeated with primers designed to amplify ∼320 bp in different regions of both the promoter and the coding sequences, with several dilutions of the immunoprecipitated DNA. A typical profile is illustrated in Fig. 3B, which reveals that TFIIB signal remained primarily localized to the proximal promoter region over the time course of the experiment. In contrast, the signal for Pol II increased in a time-dependent manner over the exon and the 3′-untranslated region. Thus, although Pol II was primarily localized to the promoter-proximal region in unstimulated cells, stimulation with anti-CD40 resulted in its redistribution over the entire gene. A stalled polymerase has also been shown to associate with the existence of an open complex in the regions corresponding to the site of stalling (16Krumm A. Meulia T. Brunvand M. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2201-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Thus, to additionally verify the presence of a stalled Pol II in promoter-proximal regions, we also performed in vivo KMNO4 footprinting assays to establish stimulus-specific open complexes in the promoter-proximal regions. The presence of unique in vivo KMNO4-sensitive T residues could indeed be detected in the TS2 downstream region (Fig. 3C), indicative of the presence of an open complex. Further, the sensitivity of the T residues in the region ∼200 bp downstream of TS2 showed a marked decrease in KMNO4 sensitivity upon stimulation of cells, supporting the likelihood of this region being the site of stalling of Pol II in unstimulated cells. Thus, these cumulative findings reveal the operation of a post-initiation mechanism of regulation of transcription from TS2. CD80 Expression Is Dependent on Cofactor Recruitment at the Promoter—In view of the previously described significance of both NF-κB and HMG(I)Y during CD80 up-regulation (17Donepudi M. Raychaudhuri P. Bluestone J.A. Mokyr M.B. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6491-6499Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 18George A.A. Sharma M. Singh B.N. Sahoo N.C. Rao K.V. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 811-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), we next monitored for their time-dependent recruitment at the CD80 promoter following stimulation of cells with anti-CD40. In repeated ChIP experiments we observed increased recruitment of both the p65 and p50 subunits of NF-κB by 2 h of stimulation time, and this association then persisted over the remainder of the experiment (Fig. 4A). In contrast HMG(I)Y was constitutively associated with the promoter region, but it dissociated by 1 h of stimulation. Importantly, siRNA-mediated silencing of p65 expression abrogated the CD40-dependent induction of CD80 (Fig. 4B), implicating an obligatory role for NF-κB recruitment in this process. An inspection of the TS2-proximal regions revealed the presence of a conserved NF-κB-binding consensus site located between +50 to +60 nt relative to TS2. The ability of this site to interact with NF-κB was initially established by performing electrophoretic mobility shift assay, supershifts, and cross-competition with a known target oligonucleotide for NF-κB binding (not shown). This result was subsequently confirmed by Scanning ChIP assays with anti-p65 or anti-p50 antibodies and cross-linked soluble chromatin subjected to Sau3A1 digestion to ensure multiple directed cleavages on the promoter prior to immunoprecipitation. For PCR, primer pairs designed to amplify in the expected Sau3A1 fragments (Fig. 4C, panel a) of the CD80 promoter were employed whereas primers pairs across the Sau3A1 site served as the controls. As shown in Fig. 4C (panel b), amplification was obtained only in the region around +55, suggesting that CD40-dependent recruitment of NF-κB occurred at this site. H3 served as the positive control and YY1 as the negative control in these experiments. In separate in vitro footprinting experiments with the purified recombinant protein, we also localized the HMG(I)Y-binding site to a region spanning between –1714 and –1709 nt (supplemental Fig. S2B). Our observations in Fig. 2D that stimulation of cells with anti-CD40 resulted in the specific modulation of the acetylation profile at nucleosome 1 also prompted us to examine for the recruitment of histone acetyltransferases. This was achieved through mononucleosome ChIP assays. As shown in Fig. 4D, an increased association of P/CAF with the promoter could be detected by 1 h of stimulation. These levels peaked by 3 h and then declined thereafter. Dissociation of P/CAF was accompanied by the corresponding recruitment of both CBP and P300 (Fig. 4D). These latter events were detected by 5 h of stimulation, coinciding with the time point at which CD40-dependent transcription was initiated. To ascertain whether histone acetyltransferase recruitment was relevant to CD80 induction, we depleted cells of P/CAF by siRNA prior to their stimulation with anti-CD40. As shown in Fig. 4E (panel a), P/CAF suppression led to a complete inhibition of CD40-dependent CD80 induction, thus supporting a direct role for P/CAF in CD80 regulation. The acetylation of H3K18 was also blocked in P/CAF knock-down cells (Fig. 4E, panel b). P-TEFb Recruitment Constitutes the Rate-limiting Step during CD80 Induction—Entry of Pol II into a productive elongation phase is also marked by the phosphorylation of serine residues in the CTD. Serine 2 and serine 5 residues of CTD are known substrates of P-TEFb and TFIIH, respectively, and the phosphorylation status of these residues is closely linked to the process of initiation and elongation (2Sims R.J. II I Belotserkovskaya R. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2437-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 3Saunders A. Core L.J. Lis J.T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next monitored the phosphorylation status of serine 2 and serine 5 of CTD and the resultant alterations as a function of cell stimulation. Phosphorylation of serine 5 could be detected even in unstimulated cells, although there was a further increase in this level by 5 h of stimulation (Fig. 5A). This is consistent with our earlier finding in Fig. 3C that an initiation-competent form of Pol II was constitutively associated with the promoter-proximal region. In contrast, significant levels of serine 2 phosphorylation became detectable only between 4 and 5 h of stimulation with anti-CD40, correlating well with the time point at which CD80 mRNA begins to accumulate. The time-dependent recruitment of the three CTD kinases was next examined. As shown in Fig. 5B, CDK7, a kinase subunit of TFIIH, was constitutively associated with the promoter with no significant change in its status upon stimulation. Similarly CDK8, a repressor that functions by phosphorylating CDK7, was also constitutively bound to the promoter, although stimulation led to its time-dependent dissociation (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, dissociation of CDK8 was succeeded by the recruitment of CDK9, the kinase subunit of P-TEFb. This was achieved between 4 and 5 h of stimulation, well in keeping with the observed kinetics of CTD serine 2 phosphorylation, as well as that of the accumulation of the CD80 transcript. The above results suggested that CDK9 recruitment could likely constitute the critical step during CD40-mediated CD80 up-regulation. This could occur through the resulting phosphorylation of CTD at serine 2, thereby conferring elongation competence to Pol II. To test this, we employed siRNA to deplete cells of CDK9 prior to stimulation with anti-CD40. As shown in Fig. 5C, depletion of CDK9 (panel b) led to a complete inhibition of CD40-induced CD80 up-regulation (panel a). Further, there was also no increase in phosphorylation at serine 2 of CTD (panel c). Thus, CDK9 recruitment appears to represent the crucial and penultimate step during CD40-dependent up-regulation of CD80. A subsequent ChIP analysis on mononucleosome preparations revealed that CDK9 engagement involved its direct interaction with nucleosome 1 (Fig. 5D). P-TEFb Recruitment Involves an Ordered Process—Our cumulative results revealed that CD40-mediated induction of CD80 expression involved the active recruitment of several distinct proteins at the promoter. Whereas recruitment of both NF-κB and P/CAF occurred early after stimulation, that of CBP and P-TEFb took place close to the time point of appearance of the transcript. To explore for a possible relationship between these events, we selectively silenced these individual molecules by siRNA and then examined for the consequences. Inhibition of expression of the p65 subunit of NF-κB resulted in a marked inhibition in the subsequent recruitment of P/CAF, CBP, and P-TEFb (Fig. 6A), thus revealing the critical role played by this transcription factor in the cascade of events that follow. Further, these findings also indicate that P/CAF recruitment occurs in an NF-κB-dependent manner. In comparison, specific suppression of P/CAF expression led to inhibition of the association of both CBP and P-TEFb, although that of NF-κB was unaffected (Fig. 6A). The silencing of CBP expression had no effect on the CD40-dependent association of NF-κB and P/CAF with the promoter, but activation-dependent engagement of P-TEFb was markedly inhibited (Fig. 6A). However, the inhibition of CDK9 expression did not affect the stimulus-dependent recruitment of p65, P/CAF, or CBP (Fig. 6A). These results, therefore, provide a resolution to the observed chronology of recruitment events and identify them to represent an ordered and interdependent process that likely leads to the cooperative assembly of a multimolecular complex. Thus, recruitment of NF-κB at the promoter facilitates P/CAF association. It is possible then that the resulting acetylation at nucleosome 1 provides the interacting site for the bromodomain of CBP, although NF-κB may also play a cooperative role in this process. It was, however, interesting that the subsequent recruitment of P-TEFb was dependent upon the histone acetyltransferases P/CAF and CBP, implicating that the acetylation status of nucleosome 1 was somehow relevant to this process. Our earlier findings that P-TEFb engagement involved its direct interaction with the nucleosome (Fig. 5D) provided additional support for such a possibility. Recent studies have identified a double bromodomain-containing protein, Brd4, to be directly associated with a significant proportion of cellular P-TEFb (19Jang M.K. Mochizuki K. Zhou M. Jeong H.S. Brady J.N. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 523-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). Such complexes were found to be devoid of inhibitory subunits such as HEX1M1, MAQ1, and 7SK RNA (20Marshall R.M. Grana X. Front. Biosci. 2006; 11: 2598-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It was therefore possible that the interaction of P-TEFb with the nucleosome, upon stimulation of cells with anti-CD40, was mediated through Brd4. To ascertain this we specifically silenced Brd4 expression by siRNA and stimulated the resulting cells with anti-CD40. Suppression of Brd4 expression also led to the specific inhibition of CD40-dependent recruitment of CDK9 at the CD80 promoter (Fig. 6B). A direct demonstration of the association of Brd4 with the nucleosome was, however, not possible because of the lack of commercially available antibodies against this protein. Nonetheless, these results do support the above-described process of ordered recruitment, which is initiated by the association of NF-κB and culminates with the recruitment of Brd4-complexed P-TEFb. Finally, interaction of Pol II with the nucleosomal complex could be demonstrated by ChIP assays on mononucleosomal preparations, using antibodies against Pol II. As shown in Fig. 6C (panel a), nucleosome 1-bound DNA could also be immunoprecipitated and cross-linked to Pol II, but only after 5 h of stimulation of cells with anti-CD40. This timing is coincident with that for the induction of CD80 transcript, as well as that for CDK9 recruitment. Further, this interaction was abolished in cells that had first been depleted of CDK9 by siRNA (Fig. 6C, panel b), supporting the possibility that the interaction of Pol II with the nucleosome was likely mediated through involvement of CDK9. Our present study contributes to the accumulating body of evidence reinforcing the relevance of transcription elongation as a regulatory event during Pol II transcription of a variety of both housekeeping and inducible genes. In addition, however, it also furnishes new insights into the level of intricacy that such regulation can entail. Pol II transcription elongation comprises the three stages of promoter escape, promoter-proximal pausing, and productive elongation, with either of the first two steps having the potential to be rate-limiting. As shown here, the basal transcriptional status of murine CD80 in the context of TS2 was characterized by aborted elongation because of arrest of Pol II in the promoter-proximal region. Release from its stalled position and consequent entry into the productive elongation phase, required stimulation of cells with anti-CD40. Surprisingly, however, we observed the presence of stimulus-dependent open complexes in the region ∼200 bp downstream of the transcription start site, a likely indicator of the stalled polymerase in this region that resumed productive elongation post-stimulation. Promoter-proximal pausing usually results either from transcript slippage or from polymerase backtracking. Both of these phenomena are normally predominant within a RNA-DNA hybrid length of ∼30 nt, by which point the TEC is stabilized (3Saunders A. Core L.J. Lis J.T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Although the likelihood of polymerase stalling at multiple sites on the promoter cannot be ruled out in view of the data presented here, CD80 appears to present a discrepant example where the polymerase stalling, at least in part, occurred subsequent to the formation of a stable TEC. In view of the known property of chromatin to impede elongation, a role for nucleosome 1 in inducing this paused state of the TEC may seem likely. Earlier studies have implicated a role for CDK7 in proximal promoter stalling of RNA Pol II (21Schwartz B.E. Larochelle S. Suter B. Lis J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6876-6886Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Our finding of the constitutive association of CDK7 with the TS2-proximal promoter may suggest a similar role for CDK7 in the present case. Consistent with the known requirements for the release of a paused TEC, TS2-initiated transcriptional activation of CD80 also required the stimulus-dependent recruitment of P-TEFb at the promoter-proximal region. This then led to the hyperphosphorylation of CTD at serine 2 and the consequent resumption of transcription elongation. A surprising aspect of this process, however, was that this end point in fact represented the culmination of an intricately executed cascade of events. As suggested by the ChIP experiments, initiation of this cascade was marked by two distinct events. One of these was the anti-CD40 induced dissociation of HMGI(Y) from the promoter, whereas the other was the activation and recruitment of the p65-p50 heterodimer of NF-κB at its target site. Although CD40 ligation is known to activate NF-κB, our more recent results suggest that the induced dissociation of HMGI(Y) is mediated through its phosphorylation, in a protein kinase C-dependent manner. 4M. Sharma, A. A. George, B. N. Singh, N. C. Sahoo, and K. V. S. Rao, unpublished results. It has been shown at previous instances, including our own results (18George A.A. Sharma M. Singh B.N. Sahoo N.C. Rao K.V. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 811-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), that HMGI(Y) can function by modulating the promoter architecture. The fact that we could map at least one HMGI(Y)-binding site between the NF-κB-binding element and the nucleosome 1, which were separated by a few hundred nucleotides, raises an interesting possibility of a parallel regulatory pathway that could operate in the form of HMGI(Y)-driven promoter architecture. Clearly, as suggested by cumulative siRNA experiments, the NF-κB-dependent recruitment of P/CAF led to the activation of acetylation events at nucleosome 1. It is likely that such a structural framework provided by the promoter architecture also accounts for the regio-selectivity of NF-κB-associated P/CAF where acetylation at nucleosome 1, but not at either nucleosome 2 or nucleosome 3, was specifically initiated. In view of the fact that TEC pausing occurred close to nucleosome 1, we anticipated remodeling at the latter to serve as the regulatory step. However, repeated experiments failed to yield any evidence for nucleosome remodeling, when monitored at the level of either restriction enzyme accessibility or nucleosome sliding (data not shown). On the contrary, our results suggest that nucleosome 1 primarily functioned by serving as a locus for the regulated recruitment of P-TEFb. Thus, as revealed from the combination of our sequential siRNA and mononucleosome ChIP experiments, the P/CAF-dependent acetylation of nucleosome 1 paved the way for the subsequent engagement of CBP. This led to an increase in the spectrum of H3 lysine residues acetylated, and the hyperacetylated nucleosome then provided the docking site for a Brd4-complexed form of P-TEFb. Finally, tethering of P-TEFb to nucleosome 1 facilitated its interaction with CTD and the consequent initiation of hyperphosphorylation of the latter at serine 2. The events outlined above, consisting of a cooperative process of ordered cofactor recruitments, are reminiscent of the mechanisms delineated for the preinitiation step of transcription. However, whereas such an elaborate process is required to ensure target-specific assembly of the preinitiation complex in such cases, the end result here was to facilitate the release of a stalled TEC. In view of the increasing number of genes that are now being found to be controlled at the level of transcription elongation (22Kim T.H. Barrera L.O. Zheng M. Qu C. Singer M.A. Richmond T.A. Wu Y. Green R.D. Ren B. Nature. 2005; 436: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar), it is not unreasonable to expect the existence of mechanisms that also regulate the expression of such genes in a specific manner. Thus, by revealing the level of intricacy that can be involved during the release of a stalled TEC, our present report provides an insight into how such specificity may be achieved.

https://openalex.org/W2019128278,"Bax-induced permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane and release of cytochrome c are key events in apoptosis. Although Bax can compromise mitochondria in primitive unicellular organisms that lack a classical apoptotic machinery, it is still unclear if Bax alone is sufficient for this, or whether additional mitochondrial components are required. The protozoan parasite Giardia lamblia is one of the earliest branching eukaryotes and harbors highly degenerated mitochondrial remnant organelles (mitosomes) that lack a genome. Here we tested whether human Bax expressed in Giardia can be used to ablate mitosomes. We demonstrate that these organelles are neither targeted, nor compromised, by Bax. However, specialized compartments of the regulated secretory pathway are completely ablated by Bax. As a consequence, maturing cyst wall proteins that are sorted into these organelles are released into the cytoplasm, causing a developmental arrest and cell death. Interestingly, this ectopic cargo release is dependent on the carboxy-terminal 22 amino acids of Bax, and can be prevented by the Bax-inhibiting peptide Ku70. A C-terminally truncated Bax variant still localizes to secretory organelles, but is unable to permeabilize these membranes, uncoupling membrane targeting and cargo release. Even though mitosomes are too diverged to be recognized by Bax, off-target membrane permeabilization appears to be conserved and leads to cell death completely independently of mitochondria."

Interestingly, the domain architecture of CAMTAs is very similar to that of the NFκB transcription factor precursors p100, p105, and Relish (16Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev.

Gong P. Reddig K. Mitra M. Guo P. Li H.S. Cell. 2006; 127: 847-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Here we report that in the same system, a CG-1 domain-containing dCAMTA fragment (referred to as CG fragment) had much lower transcription activity than the full-length protein due to defective nuclear transport of the fragment. Remarkably, in co-transfected cells the CG fragment associated with and prevented nuclear transport of a full-length dCAMTA protein. The interaction site was mapped to a region within the CG-1 domain. These data suggest that dCAMTA may dimerize through the mapped region. We further demonstrated that the potential dimerization of full-length dCAMTA protein is required for its nuclear localization and for its visual regulation function in the fly eye (7Han J. Gong P. Reddig K. Mitra M. Guo P. Li H.S. Cell. 2006; 127: 847-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA Construction and Mutagenesis—The plasmid pCMV-dCAMTA-Myc has a full-length dCAMTA cDNA (including 21-bp 5′-untranslated region) inserted at the HindIII/XhoI sites of a pCMV-TAG5C vector (Stratagene). Plasmids pCMV-FLAG-CG and pCMV-FLAG-TA contain the CG and the TA fragment, respectively, between the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pCMV-Tag2B (Stratagene). The plasmids for GST-CG and GST-TA fusions were constructed by inserting an EcoRV and a SalI/EagI fragment of dCAMTA into the SmaI and SalI/NotI sites, respectively, of the vector pGEX-5X-2 (Stratagene). Plasmids for truncated CG fragments were generated by restriction digestion and ligation of the pGEX-5X-CG construct. Site-directed mutagenesis of pGEX-5X-CG was conducted using mutation-containing primers and a QuikChange kit (Stratagene). Mutant fragments were subcloned into a pcDNA3-dCAMTA plasmid to generate a full-length dCAMTA mutant, which was subsequently transferred into the vector pCMV-Tag2B or pCaSpeR-hs.Cell Transfection and Immunohistochemistry—Using a Polyfect transfection reagent (Qiagen), the plasmids were introduced into 293 cells that were cultured on coated coverslips (2-cm, round) in 6-cm dishes. Two days after transfection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, washed twice, and incubated with mouse anti-Myc, rabbit anti-FLAG, or both antibodies (diluted 1:200 in phosphate-buffered saline; Sigma). After washes, fluorescein isothiocyanate- and TRITC-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) were used to label the Myc and FLAG signals, respectively. The stained coverslips were mounted to slides using a 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-containing VectorShield medium (Vector Labs).Luciferase Assay—A dFbxl4 promoter sequence (-625 to ∼+87) was inserted upstream to a luciferase gene in a modified pGL3-basic vector (Promega) from which an intrinsic CGCG box (in the multiple cloning region) had been removed. The construct or the vector (for control) was introduced into 293 cells alone or together with the dCAMTA DNAs. After 24 h, cells were harvested and examined with a luciferase assay system (Promega).Glutathione-Sepharose Binding Assay—GST fusion proteins were expressed in BL-21 cells and purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Approximately 20 μg of each protein was coupled again to 40 μl of glutathione-Sepharose and incubated with head extracts (in phosphate-buffered saline that contained 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors) of 200 heat-shocked p[hs-dCAMTA];tes2 flies (7Han J. Gong P. Reddig K. Mitra M. Guo P. Li H.S. Cell. 2006; 127: 847-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) or with 0.5 ml of 293 cell extracts in Tris-buffered saline. After three washes with Tris-buffered saline, proteins were eluted with 20 mm glutathione in TBS and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.Fly Genetics—Both wild type and tes2 flies had a w1118 background. To generate dCAMTA transgenic flies, a wild type dCAMTA cDNA or mutant variants were subcloned into a pCaSpeR-hs vector, and injected into w; tes2 flies. All flies were raised in an approximate 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. To drive expression of dCAMTA through the heat shock promoter, flies were shocked at late pupal stage by immersing the fly vials in a 37 °C water bath for 1 h. All flies were examined at 1-2 days old.Real-time Reverse Transcription PCR—Total RNA was extracted from 1- to 3-day-old fly heads using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). A 1-h heat shock was applied to the fly 10 h before the extraction. Real-time reverse transcription PCR was conducted using an ABI PRISM7700 and a SuperScript III Platinum One-Step kit (Invitrogen). The raw mRNA level was determined as 2-CT, where CT is the number of cycles required for the SYBR Green fluorescence to cross the threshold of 30 arbitrary fluorescence units. The relative mRNA levels were calculated after setting the raw level of each gene in the wild type fly as 100%. The primer pair for dFbxl4 is cgatgctaacgaaaacgctg/cggacgttgagccaatagc, which produces a PCR fragment of 189 bp.Electroretinogram (ERG) Recording—ERG was examined as previously described (20Li H.S. Montell C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1411-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The fly eye was stimulated with 5-s orange light pulses (4000 lux). To quantitate the speed of response termination, the time required for 1/3 recovery was measured. For each genotype, data of seven flies were averaged, and the standard error of mean (S.E.) was calculated and presented as error bar.Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assays—The DNA probe CCAACAGTCGCATGGGCAGCGTGCCCACGCG (or CGGG)CACCATTGGCGCCAGTATGAG was synthesized with overlapping primer pairs using PCR and labeled with 3′-biotin (Pierce). One microgram of GST or GST-CG fragment (with Arg483, 484Glu mutations) was incubated with 10 fmol-labeled probes, either with or without the presence of 2 pmol-unlabeled probes, in 20 μl of binding solution (Pierce lightshift chemiluminescent electrophoretic mobility shift assay kit) for 20 min, and then loaded to 6% PAGE gel. The signal was developed according to the manual included in the kit.RESULTSA CG-1 Domain-containing Fragment Localized a Full-length dCAMTA Protein in the Cytoplasm—In a study for mapping functional domains of dCAMTA, we found that a CG-1 domain-containing fragment (Fig. 1A, CG fragment) was able to stimulate expression of a luciferase reporter gene through a dFbxl4 promoter (7Han J. Gong P. Reddig K. Mitra M. Guo P. Li H.S. Cell. 2006; 127: 847-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) in transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells (Fig. 1B). Thus, this fragment may also contain a transcription activation region that is next to the CG-1 domain (5Bouche N. Scharlat A. Snedden W. Bouchez D. Fromm H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21851-21861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 15Song K. Backs J. McAnally J. Qi X. Gerard R.D. Richardson J.A. Hill J.A. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. Cell. 2006; 125: 453-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the CG fragment displayed a much lower activity of transcription compared with a full-length dCAMTA protein (1.37 ± 0.33 versus 2.93 ± 0.57, Fig. 1B).To attempt to explain why this fragment is less efficient in transcription activation, we used tag peptide antibodies to examine the distributions of the fragment (with a FLAG tag) and the full-length protein (with a Myc tag) in the transfected cells. The result showed that in contrast to the nuclear localization of the full-length protein, most CG fragment signals were observed in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1C), suggesting that a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) is missing in the fragment. The low level of transcription activity of the CG fragment could have been contributed by the residual amount of proteins in the nuclei.Surprisingly, when the full-length protein and the CG fragment were transfected together into the same cells, both proteins failed to enter the nuclei (Fig. 1D). As a consequence, the luciferase expression level in the co-transfected cells (0.77 ± 0.21) was even lower than that of the CG fragment alone (Fig. 1B). In the cytoplasm, the full-length protein and the fragment appeared to be co-localized in the same areas (Fig. 1D), which could be because of dimerization of these two proteins and because the formed heterodimer was somehow unable to enter the nucleus. As the CG fragment displayed a higher protein level than the full-length protein in Western blot (Fig. 1E), it is likely that most full-length proteins had been retained in the cytoplasm by the fragment.A Region in the CG-1 Domain Mediates the dCAMTA-dCAMTA Interaction—If the CG fragment really dimerizes with the full-length dCAMTA protein, we should be able to detect a direct, biochemical interaction between these two. In a glutathione-Sepharose binding assay, we found that the CG fragment, which was fused to a GST, pulled down overexpressed full-length dCAMTA from head extracts of a transgenic fly (Fig. 2B). In addition to the CG-1 domain, dCAMTA contains a TIG domain and an ankyrin-repeat region that may mediate protein-protein interaction. Nonetheless, a fragment (referred to as TA fragment, Fig. 2A) that contains both of these regions failed to bind any dCAMTA protein from the fly heads (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2The CG fragment may mediate dCAMTA dimerization. A, locations of the CG and TA fragments in the dCAMTA molecule. B, in a glutathione-Sepharose binding assay, a GST-fused CG fragment, but not TA fragment, pulled down dCAMTA protein from head extracts of heat-shocked p[hs-dCAMTA];tes flies. Lane one was loaded with 1/20 of input. C, the GST-CG fragment pulled down FLAG-CG from transfected 293 cell extracts. Lane one was loaded with 1/10 of input.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine whether the CG fragment interacts with its counterpart in the full-length protein, we attempted to pull down FLAG-tagged dCAMTA fragments from 293 cell extracts using the GST-CG fusion protein. The result showed that the FLAG-CG, but not a FLAG-TA fragment, bound to the GST-CG protein (Fig. 2C). In control experiments, the GST-TA fusion protein did not pull down either fragment from the cell extracts (Fig. 2C).The above observations suggest that a region in the CG fragment may mediate homodimerization of dCAMTA. To map this region, we truncated the GST-CG fusion protein into shorter fragments and tested their binding to the FLAG-CG. The fragments amino acids 274-535 or amino acids 274-509, but not amino acids 274-445, pulled down the FLAG-CG from cell extracts (Fig. 3A). The data indicate that the region amino acids 445-509, which is entirely included in the CG-1 domain, is critical for the interaction between CG fragments. Most residues in this mapped region are conserved among CAMTA proteins from different species (Fig. 3B). We created two adjacent mutations, Arg483 and Arg484, to glutamic acid (E), in the GST-CG fragment. In glutathione-Sepharose binding assays, these mutations completely disrupted the binding between the GST- and the FLAG-CG fragments (Fig. 3C), suggesting that the residues Arg483 and Arg 484 are required for dimerization of the CG fragment.FIGURE 3A potential dCAMTA dimerization site was mapped to a region within the CG-1 domain. A, sequential truncation of the GST-CG fragment identified a region (amino acids 445-509) critical for the interaction with FLAG-CG. The bottom panel shows the amount of FLAG-CG protein pulled down by different GST fusions. B, amino acid residues in the mapped interaction region. The residues that are conserved among different CAMTA proteins are in red and capitalized. C, mutation of two conserved residues in the mapped region, Arg483 and Arg 484, disrupted the interaction between the GST- and FLAG-CG fragments. D, The R483E,R484E mutant CG fragment (mut.CG) failed to associate with and retain the full-length dCAMTA in the cytoplasm of co-transfected cells. E, the dCAMTA-dependent transcription activity in these co-transfected cells was the same as that of dCAMTA alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test whether the residues Arg483 and Arg484 mediate the CG fragment/full-length protein association in the 293 cells, we introduced a FLAG-tagged R483E,R484E mutant CG fragment into the cell together with the full-length dCAMTA and examined their intracellular distributions. In the co-transfected cells, most fragment signals were still observed in the cytoplasm, whereas virtually all full-length proteins were localized in the nucleus (Fig. 3D). As the mutant fragment failed to prevent the nuclear transport of the full-length protein, the luciferase expression level in these cells was as high as that of the full-length dCAMTA alone (Fig. 3E). Thus, the residues Arg483 and Arg484 are indispensable for the interaction between the CG fragment and the full-length dCAMTA in live cells and could be involved in a potential dimerization of dCAMTA.The dCAMTA-dCAMTA Interaction Site Is Required for the Transcription Activity and the Physiological Function of dCAMTA in the Fly Eye—In the dCAMTA mutant flies tes1 and tes2, the target gene dFbxl4 has a much reduced expression level (7Han J. Gong P. Reddig K. Mitra M. Guo P. Li H.S. Cell. 2006; 127: 847-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To examine whether Arg483 and Arg484 are required for in vivo transcription activity of dCAMTA, we generated transgenic flies that express an R483E,R484E mutant dCAMTA protein in the tes2 background through a heat shock promoter and examined the expression level of dFbxl4. According to real-time reverse transcription PCR, the dFbxl4 mRNA level in these flies was not significantly increased compared with that in tes flies (Fig. 4). In contrast, overexpression of a wild type dCAMTA protein completely recovered the level of dFbxl4 expression. The data indicate that Arg483 and Arg484 are critical for in vivo transcription activity of dCAMTA, probably due to their role in the potential dimerization of dCAMTA.FIGURE 4Mutation of Arg483 and Arg484 disrupted in vivo transcription activity of dCAMTA in transgenic flies. The lower chart shows the results of a real-time PCR. A wild type dCAMTA protein, but not the R483E,R484E mutant variant, recovered the expression level of dFbxl4 in a tes2 mutant background. The dCAMTA proteins were expressed through a heat shock promoter 10 h before the RNA extraction. The gene RPL32 was used as a control. See top panel for dCAMTA protein levels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)With insufficient dFbxl4, the light receptor rhodopsin cannot be deactivated promptly in tes photoreceptors, and as a consequence the light response terminates much more slowly than wild type in both ERG and single-cell current recordings (7Han J. Gong P. Reddig K. Mitra M. Guo P. Li H.S. Cell. 2006; 127: 847-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This slow termination of light response phenotype was fully rescued by overexpression of wild type dCAMTA proteins. Once the residues Arg483 and Arg484 had been mutated, however, dCAMTA failed to improve the termination speed of light response in the tes mutant background (Fig. 5). In contrast, mutation of two conserved residues (I1852,1937 to Asn) in the C-terminal region did not significantly impair this visual function of dCAMTA (Fig. 5). Thus, the residues Arg483 and Arg484 are critical for the role of dCAMTA in rhodopsin regulation, which suggests that dCAMTA might need to form dimers to function in fly photoreceptor neurons.FIGURE 5Mutation of Arg483 and Arg484 impaired the function of dCAMTA in fly visual regulation. A, in tes2 mutant background, a wild type dCAMTA protein and an I1852N,I1937N mutant variant rescued the slow termination of light response phenotype in ERG recordings. The R483E,R484E mutant protein failed to improve the speed of response termination. All proteins were expressed through a heat shock promoter. The event markers at the bottom represent 5-s light stimuli.

In a electrophoresis mobility shift assay, the mutated CG fragment still bound to and changed the mobility of a biotin-labeled CGCG box-containing DNA probe (7Han J. Gong P. Reddig K. Mitra M. Guo P. Li H.S. Cell. 2006; 127: 847-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6A). This binding appeared to be specific because it was blocked by unlabeled probe of high concentration. In addition, changing the CGCG box into CGGG abolished this DNA-protein interaction (Fig. 6A).FIGURE 6The R483E,R484E mutation disrupted the nuclear localization, not the DNA binding capability, of dCAMTA protein. A, in electrophoresis mobility shift assays, the mutant CG fragment bound to a CGCG box-containing DNA probe (CCAACAGTCGCATGGGCAGCGTGCCCACGCGCACCATTGGCGCCAGTATGAG), but not after the CGCG box changed to CGGG. 200-fold of unlabeled CGCG probes abolished the binding in the competition test (compt.). B, a full-length R483E,R484E dCAMTA variant (mut.dCAMTA), tagged with FLAG, failed to localize in the nuclei of transfected 293 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As the dimerization did not appear to be critical for dCAMTA binding to specific promoter sequences, we next examined whether it is required for nuclear localization of dCAMTA by expressing a FLAG-tagged full-length mutant protein in 293 cells. Immunostaining of the transfected cells showed that the majority of mutant proteins were localized in the cytoplasm and failed to enter the nuclei (Fig. 6B), suggesting that the Arg483,484-dependent dimerization could be important for appropriate presentation of the NLS. Thus, the mutant dCAMTA protein could be non-functional in the fly eye because of the impaired nuclear localization.DISCUSSIONIn addition to the functions in brain tumor suppression (11Barbashina V.

It is of great significance to study the transcription activities of CAMTA.CAMTA transcription factors stimulate gene expression primarily through binding to CGCG box-containing promoter sequences (5Bouche N.

In the holoenzyme, regions 2 and 4 of the σ subunit are positioned at an optimal distance to allow specific recognition of the -10 and -35 promoter elements, respectively. In free σ, the promoter binding regions are positioned closer to each other and are masked for interactions with the promoter, with σ region 1 playing a role in the masking. To analyze the DNA-binding properties of the free σ, we selected single-stranded DNA aptamers that are specific to primary σ subunits from several bacterial species, including Escherichia coli and Thermus aquaticus. The aptamers share a consensus motif, TGTAGAAT, that is similar to the extended -10 promoter. We demonstrate that recognition of this motif by σ region 2 occurs without major structural rearrangements of σ observed upon the holoenzyme formation and is not inhibited by σ regions 1 and 4. Thus, the complex process of the -10 element recognition by RNA polymerase holoenzyme can be reduced to a simple system consisting of an isolated σ subunit and a short aptamer oligonucleotide.

Most promoters of housekeeping genes are recognized by a holoenzyme containing the primary σ subunit, called σ70 in Escherichia coli or σA in most other bacterial species. Primary σ subunits from different bacteria share four conserved regions each consisting of two or more subregions. Conserved regions 2.4, 3.0, and 4.2 of the σ subunit have been implicated in specific recognition of the -10 (consensus sequence TATAAT), the extended -10 (TG), and the -35 (TTGACA) promoter elements, respectively (1Gross C.A.

Based on indirect biochemical and biophysical data, several mechanisms of inhibition of DNA-binding activity in free σ have been proposed. First, the N-terminal region of σ (region 1.1) was shown to inhibit DNA binding. Deletion of this region allows σ70 to weakly bind double-stranded promoter DNA with some specificity (17Dombroski A.J.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2446-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) but does not allow the recognition of single-stranded nontemplate oligonucleotides by free σ (15Severinova E. Severinov K.

Chem. 1997; 272: 3487-3494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was proposed that region 1.1 may inhibit DNA binding by (i) direct masking of σ region 4 (17Dombroski A.J.

Second, it was shown that free σ adopts a compact conformation in which DNA-recognition domains σ2 and σ4 are brought closer to each other than in the holoenzyme (23Callaci S. Heyduk E. Heyduk T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 229-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The sub-optimal positioning of σ2 and σ4 is likely to interfere with simultaneous recognition of the -10 and -35 elements. Furthermore, the close proximity of σ2 and σ4 to each other and to other protein parts may directly mask DNA binding sites in free σ (24Sorenson M.K. Ray S.S. Darst S.A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 127-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 25Sorenson M.K. Darst S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Finally, it was proposed that some local differences in the structure of the DNA binding domains in free σ and in holo-RNAP may also be associated with the differences in DNA binding properties of the protein (12Callaci S. Heyduk T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3312-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 27Callaci S. Heyduk E. Heyduk T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32995-33001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, because the structure of free σ is unknown, the exact nature of the coreinduced rearrangements and the mechanism of inhibition of DNA binding by free σ are unclear. Previously, we characterized ssDNA aptamers that contained the -10 promoter element and were recognized specifically by the free σA subunit from T. aquaticus (sTaps, for sigma T. aquaticus aptamers) (26Feklistov A. Barinova N. Sevostyanova A. Heyduk E. Bass I. Vvedenskaya I. Kuznedelov K. Merkiene E. Stavrovskaya E. Klimasauskas S. Nikiforov V. Heyduk T. Severinov K. Kulbachinskiy A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It was shown that the binding of sTaps is accompanied by a conformational change in σA and leads to an increase in the distance between domains σ2 and σ4. It was concluded that (i) the isolated σA subunit has all determinants required for specific recognition of the -10 promoter element, and (ii) the increase in the σ2-σ4 distance may be required for the unmasking of the DNA binding sites of σA. However, it remained unknown whether free σs from other bacterial species can also recognize promoter sequences and whether this requires similar conformational changes in the protein. In this work, we describe a novel class of aptamers that contain motifs similar to the -10 and TG promoter elements and are recognized efficiently by σ subunits from various bacterial species. We demonstrate that the aptamers interact with σ region 2 and that this interaction does not require major conformational changes of σ, which has been observed upon the holoenzyme formation (23Callaci S. Heyduk E. Heyduk T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 229-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and sTap binding (26Feklistov A. Barinova N. Sevostyanova A. Heyduk E. Bass I. Vvedenskaya I. Kuznedelov K. Merkiene E. Stavrovskaya E. Klimasauskas S. Nikiforov V. Heyduk T. Severinov K. Kulbachinskiy A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The aptamer binding is also not inhibited by σ regions 1 and 4. Thus, specific DNA recognition by σ region 2 can occur without large structural changes of the σ subunit. Proteins—Wild-type and mutant E. coli σ70, T. aquaticus, and Deinococcus radiodurans σA were obtained as described (26Feklistov A. Barinova N. Sevostyanova A. Heyduk E. Bass I. Vvedenskaya I.

The fragment of the rpoD gene encoding for amino acids 1-565 of E. coli σ70 was amplified from genomic DNA and cloned between NdeI and EcoRI sites of pET28. The protein was overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified as described (29Zenkin N. Kulbachinskiy A. Yuzenkova Y. Mustaev A. Bass I. Severinov K. Brodolin K. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 955-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Selection of Aptamers to E. coli σ70—The selection of aptamers was performed essentially as described previously (26Feklistov A. Barinova N. Sevostyanova A. Heyduk E. Bass I. Vvedenskaya I. Kuznedelov K. Merkiene E. Stavrovskaya E. Klimasauskas S. Nikiforov V. Heyduk T. Severinov K. Kulbachinskiy A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The library used for the selection was 5′-GGGAGCTCAGAATAAACGCTCAA-32N-TTCGACATGAGGCCCGGATC, where N is a random nucleotide. The selection was performed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 240 mm NaCl, and 60 mm KCl. The amounts of ssDNA and the σ70 subunit were varied from 3 nmol and 500 pmol, respectively, in the first round of selection, to 100 and 10 pmol in subsequent rounds. Selection was performed using N-terminally hexahistidine-tagged σ70. σ70 and DNA were incubated for 30 min in 1 ml of the binding buffer, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) was added, unbound DNA was removed by extensive washing, and σ-DNA complexes were eluted with binding buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. The eluted DNA was amplified using primers corresponding to the fixed regions of the library (5′-GGGAGCTCAGAATAAACGCTCAA and BBB-5′-GATCCGGGCCTCATGTCGAA, where B is a biotin residue), DNA strands were separated by size on 10% denaturing PAGE, and the nonbiotinylated strand was purified and used for the next round of selection. After ten rounds, the enriched library was amplified with primers containing EcoRI and HindIII sites and cloned into the pUC19 plasmid. Individual aptamers were obtained by PCR or purchased from Syntol (Moscow). Analysis of σ-Aptamer Interactions—Determination of equilibrium Kd values for binding of aptamers to the σ subunit was done by the nitrocellulose binding method (30Carey J. Cameron V. de Haseth P.L. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2601-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and purified by PAGE. Each aptamer (0.1 nm) was incubated with a series of dilutions of the σ subunit or its fragments (from 1 nm to 3 μm) in 50 μl of binding buffer for 30 min at room temperature; the samples were filtered through 0.45-μm nitrocellulose filters (HAWP, Millipore), and the filters were washed with 5 ml of the buffer and quantified with PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). To calculate apparent equilibrium dissociation constants, the data were fit to a hyperbolic equation, B = Bmax*[σ]/([σ] + Kd), where B is a percentage of DNA bound, Bmax is the maximum binding at infinite concentration of σ, and Kd is the dissociation constant. The fitting was performed by nonlinear regression algorithm using GraFit (Erithacus Software). For each aptamer-σ combination, Kd measurements were independently repeated two to three times, and averages were calculated. The experimental variation among replicate measurements usually did not exceed 30% of the average value. Cross-linking Experiments—Cross-linking was performed in 15 μl of the binding buffer. The samples contained 10 nm of 5′-labeled sEcap1 or nontemplate oligonucleotide and 100 nm σ70. The nontemplate oligonucleotide was closely related to the nontemplate strand of a lacUV5 promoter: 5′-ATTGCGTATAATGTGTGGA. The samples were incubated for 15 min at 25 °C, irradiated for 10 min under a 254 nm UV lamp (4 watts, Spectroline), and separated on 5% SDS-PAGE. For the mapping of the cross-linking sites, the DNA-protein complexes were eluted with 400 μl of 0.03% SDS, freeze-dried, and dissolved in 20 μl of 50mm HCl. 10-μl aliquots were withdrawn, and 1 m CNBr was added to the remaining samples to 50 mm. The reaction was stopped after 5 min by adding an equal volume of stop buffer containing 2% SDS, 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 20% glycerol. The degradation products were separated on 13% SDS-PAGE. Luminescence Resonance Energy Transfer Distance Measurements—The double-cysteine mutant of σ70 was labeled with europium chelate and Cy5 and purified as described previously (23Callaci S. Heyduk E. Heyduk T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 229-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Distance measurements were conducted at 25 °C as described (23Callaci S. Heyduk E. Heyduk T.

Oligonucleotides and the E. coli core RNAP were added to 100 and 60 nm, when present, respectively. The control oligonucleotide that did not bind σ70 was an sTap1 aptamer described previously (26Feklistov A. Barinova N. Sevostyanova A. Heyduk E. Bass I. Vvedenskaya I. Kuznedelov K. Merkiene E.

Structural Features of Aptamers Recognized by the σ70 Subunit of E. coli RNA Polymerase—As the primary target for aptamer selection, we chose the σ70 subunit from E. coli, which has a well defined promoter specificity and has been used as a model to study the process of promoter recognition for many years (1Gross C.A. Chan C. Dombroski A. Gruber T. Sharp M. Tupy J. Young B. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 141-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). ssDNA aptamers were selected from a library of 75-nucleotide-long ssDNA containing a 32-nucleotide central region of random sequence surrounded by regions with fixed sequences. The initial ssDNA library showed poor affinity for σ70 (apparent Kd > 10 μm). Control experiments demonstrated that free σ70 also did not bind nontemplate oligonucleotides containing the -10 promoter element (Kd > 10 μm). After 10 rounds of selection, the affinity of the enriched library significantly increased (Kd ∼ 85 nm). The library was cloned, and insert sequences of 30 individual clones were determined. The resulting sequences were named sEcaps (for sigma E. coli aptamer) (Fig. 1A). All the aptamers exhibited high affinity for σ70 and bound it with Kd values ranging from 30 to 100 nm. For several clones, it was possible to minimize the size of the aptamers by removing the whole fixed library regions without decreasing the aptamer affinity. One of the minimal aptamers, sEcap1, had even higher affinity to σ70 (Kd ∼ 20 nm) than the full-length variant and was chosen for further studies. The majority of the aptamers share the octanucleotide sequence TGTAGAAT, which is located at different positions within the central region of the library (Fig. 1A). In this sequence, the underlined motif is similar to the bacterial primary σ -10 promoter element but contains G instead of T at the third position. The dinucleotide TG located to the left of the -10-like sequence matches the TG motif of the extended -10 promoters (see below). In all the aptamers, the conserved 8-nucleotide motif is preceded by G-rich regions, which can potentially form G-quadruplexes. The G-quartet structure is important for aptamer binding, because aptamer variants with substitutions in this region did not interact with σ. The binding of the aptamers also depended on the presence of potassium ions, which are known to stabilize G-quartets (data not shown). The proposed secondary structure of sEcap1 is shown on Fig. 1B. In the structure, the G-quadruplex is followed by a single-stranded region containing the conserved aptamer motif. Although aptamer ligands are usually highly specific to their target proteins (32Gold L. Polisky B. Uhlenbeck O. Yarus M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 763-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar), we found that the aptamers selected in this work were recognized with equally high efficiencies by σ subunits from various bacterial species, including T. aquaticus and D. radiodurans (Kd values for sEcap1 were 9.5 and 6.4 nm, respectively). This indicated that the aptamers interact with a highly conserved epitope of σ. Aptamers Interact with σ70 Region 2—The presence of the conserved -10-like element in sEcaps suggested that it is essential for aptamer binding and is likely recognized by σ conserved region 2, similarly to the -10 element in promoters. Indeed, a mutant variant of sEcap1 bearing an ATCTCG sequence instead of the -10-like motif did not bind σ70 (data not shown). Adenine at the second position of the -10 element (-11A) is the most conserved promoter base and was previously shown to be critical for promoter recognition and opening (33Lim H.M. Lee H.J. Roy S. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14849-14852Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We found that a substitution of C for A at this position of the -10-like motif in sEcap1 completely abolished aptamer binding (Kd > 3 μm). Interestingly, an sEcap1 mutant bearing the perfect -10 element consensus (TATAAT) also exhibited poor binding to σ (Kd > 1 μm) indicating that the -10 element in sEcaps is recognized by free σ70 with a somewhat different specificity than the -10 promoter element by holo-RNAP. At the same time, changes at other positions of the TAGAAT motif had less dramatic effect on aptamer recognition (Kd for aptamer variants with point nucleotide changes at the first, fourth, and fifth positions of this motif ranged from 20 to 80 nm). To localize the σ region(s) involved in interactions with the aptamer, we performed cross-linking of σ70 with radioactively labeled sEcap1. Irradiation of the σ70-sEcap1 complex with UV light at 254 nm resulted in the appearance of a cross-linked DNA-protein complex that had lower mobility than free DNA on a denaturing gel (Fig. 2A, lane 1). The cross-link was highly specific, because its efficiency was dramatically reduced in the case of the sEcap1 variant that contained the -11A to C mutation (Fig. 2A, lane 2). For mapping of the cross-linking sites in the σ70 subunit we used a method of limited chemical cleavage of modified protein at Met residues (34Grachev M.A. Lukhtanov E.A. Mustaev A.A. Zaychikov E.F. Abdukayumov M.N. Rabinov I.V. Richter V.I. Skoblov Y.S. Chistyakov P.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 35Mustaev A. Zaychikov E. Grachev M. Kozlov M. Severinov K. Epshtein V. Korzheva N. Bereshchenko O. Markovtsov V. Lukhtanov E. Tsarev I. Maximova T. Kashlev M. Bass I. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 191-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In a control reaction, we performed cross-linking of σ70 in a complex of E. coli holo-RNAP with a single-stranded nontemplate oligonucleotide containing the -10 element (Fig. 2B). The cross-linking site of this oligonucleotide was previously mapped between σ70 Met residues 413 and 456 (9Kulbachinskiy A. Mustaev A. Goldfarb A. Nikiforov V. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The treatment of σ70, radioactively labeled with sEcap1, with BrCN in single-hit conditions resulted in the formation of a characteristic pattern of radiolabeled peptides corresponding to the C terminus of the protein (Fig. 2B, lane 3). This pattern was identical to that observed in the case of the control nontemplate oligonucleotide (lane 2). The shortest labeled peptide corresponded to cleavage at Met-413. Shorter peptides resulting from cleavage at and C-terminal to Met-456 were not detected on the autograph and, therefore, did not contain the site of modification (Fig. 2B, see also Ref. 9Kulbachinskiy A. Mustaev A. Goldfarb A. Nikiforov V. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This indicated that the site of cross-linking is located between Met-413 and Met-456. This region contains conserved regions 2.3 and 2.4 of σ70, which have been previously implicated in the recognition of the -10 element in promoters. σ70 Regions 1, 3, and 4 Are Not Important for Aptamer Recognition—To check whether other parts of σ70, besides region 2, are important for aptamer binding, we analyzed interactions of sEcap1 with three σ fragments, encompassing amino acids 1-565, 1-448, and 102-448 of σ70 (Table 1). The first and the second of the fragments lacked conserved region 4.2 and regions 3 and 4, respectively. The third fragment lacked regions 3 and 4 and the N-terminal segment, including region 1.1 (amino acids 1-93) and the first 8 amino acids from region 1.2, and corresponded to structural domain σ2, which is conserved in all σ70-family proteins (15Severinova E.

Cell. 1996; 87: 127-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). We found that the affinities of all three fragments to sEcap1 did not differ significantly from the affinity of the full-length σ70 (Table 1). All fragments recognized sEcap1 specifically, because the -11C mutation abolished aptamer binding (Kd > 3 μm). This indicates that the presence of regions 1, 3, and 4 in full-length σ70 is neither required for nor inhibitory to aptamer binding.TABLE 1Recognition of sEcap1 and its mutants by E. coli σ70 and T. aquaticus σAσ SubunitAptamer KdTGTAGAATTGCTAGAATCCTAGAATnmσ701-613 (WT)aWT, full-length wild type σ subunit.18.7 ± 5.669.5 ± 15.3>30001-56529.3 ± 6.7NDbND, not determined.>30001-44822.7 ± 7.389.0 ± 20.7>3000102-44817.6 ± 6.5ND>3000σAWT9.5 ± 3.1ND>3000Q260H20.0 ± 5.3ND65.9 ± 21.3a WT, full-length wild type σ subunit.b ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab The TG Element in Aptamers Is Recognized by σ Region 2.4—The TG motif present in all the aptamers resembles the TG element of the extended -10 promoters but, in contrast to the promoters, is located immediately upstream of the -10-like sequence. To check whether the position of TG is essential for aptamer recognition, we studied an sEcap1 mutant, which contained an additional cytosine nucleotide inserted between the TG motif and the -10-like element (“TGC sEcap1”). This aptamer was recognized by σ70 with almost as high affinity as wild-type sEcap1 (Kd ∼ 70 nm, Table 1 and Fig. 3A). At the same time, an aptamer mutant in which the TG motif was substituted by CC (“CC sEcap1”) did not bind σ (Kd > 3 μm, Fig. 3A). Therefore, the TG motif is essential for aptamer binding and can be specifically recognized by σ70 when located at the same position as in the extended -10 promoters. The observed difference in the TG position in the aptamers and promoters likely reflects some differences in conformations of σ and/or DNA in the σ-sEcap complex and in the holoenzyme RNAP-promoter complex during transcription initiation. Suppression genetics studies initially suggested that TG in the extended -10 promoters is recognized by region 3.0 of σ70 (37Barne K.A. Bown J.A. Busby S.J. Minchin S.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4034-4040Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Later, region 2.4 was also shown to play a role in the recognition of this motif (38Sanderson A. Mitchell J.E. Minchin S.D. Busby S.J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 544: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We therefore used aptamers as model DNA substrates to analyze the roles of these σ regions in"
