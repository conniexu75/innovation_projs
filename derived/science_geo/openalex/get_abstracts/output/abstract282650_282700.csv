https://openalex.org/W2087587525,Warmeling of samples of marine sediments to room temperatures prior to the extraction of interstitial water accounts for the apparent enrichments of potassium ion (13.3 percent) and chloride ion (1.4 percent) and depletions of magnesium ion (2.5 percent) and calcium ion (4.9 percent). These differences are the result of changes in ion-exchange selectivity as a function of temperature.
