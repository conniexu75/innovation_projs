https://openalex.org/W2121562033,"Analysis of cloned sequences for yeast histone genes H2A and H2B reveals that there are only two copies of this pair of genes within the haploid yeast genome. Within each copy, the genes for H2A and H2B are separated by approximately 700 bp of spacer DNA. The two copies are separated from one another in the yeast genome by a minimum distance of 35-60 kb. Sequence homology between the two copies is restricted to the genes for H2A and H2B; the spacer DNA between the genes is nonhomologous. In both copies, the genes for H2A and H2B are divergently transcribed. In addition, both plasmids code for other nonhistone proteins. Sequences coding for histones H3 and H4 have not been detected in the immediate vicinity of the genes for H2A and H2B."

https://openalex.org/W1981783129,"The karyotypes of pristane-induced mouse plasmacytomas were studied by G banding. Only primary tumors or early passage generations were analyzed. In contrast to murine T cell leukemias that showed a regular trisomy of chromosome 15, all plasmacytomas showed a consistent translocation of the distal part of chromosome 15 to either chromosome 6 [rcpT(6;15)] or 12 [T(12;15)]. The specific breakpoints were at 6C, 15D3/E ro D2/3 and 12F2. Early passage generations often showed a mixed population with two different translocations, suggesting polyclonal origin. Considered together with the known karyotypic features of murine and human lymphomas, these findings support the theory that the nonrandom chromosomal changes in lymphoproliferative malignancies are associated with the type of the target cell, rather than with the etiological agent. Moreover, the involvement of the chromosomes known to carry the heavy chain (12) and the light chain (6) determinants, respectively, raises the question of whether the translocations may be related to the DNA level rearrangements known to occur during the differentiation of normal plasma cells."

https://openalex.org/W2080131469,"Rabbit chromosomal DNA contains a cluster of four linked beta-like globin genes arranged in the orientation 5'-beta 4-(8kb)-beta 3-(5 kb)-beta 2-(7-kb)-beta 1-3'. Determination of the nucleotide sequence of gene beta 1 confirms that this gene corresponds to the second type of two common co-dominant alleles encoding the adult beta-globin chain. With the exception of two nucleotide substitutions in the large intervening sequence (intron), the intron and flanking sequences are identical with the nucleotide sequence of the first type determined by Weissmann et al. (1979). A 14S polyadenylated transcript containing large intron sequences (possibly a mRNA precursor) is detected in the bone marrow cells of anemic rabbits. Gene beta 2 has limited sequence homology to adult and embryonic beta-globin probes and lacks a detectable mRNA transcript in the erythropoietic tissues examined. It contains at least one intervening sequence analogous to the large intron in gene beta 1. Genes beta 3 and beta 4 both contain an intron of 0.8 kb. Partial DNA sequence analysis indicates that the large intron in beta 4 is located between codons for amino acids lysine and leucine in an analogous position to that of the large intron in beta 1. In addition, a second smaller intron interrupts the 5' coding sequences of gene beta 4. Both genes beta 3 and beta 4 are transcribed in embryonic globin-producing cells. Their DNA sequence homology is limited, however, to a segment of approximately 0.2 kb located on the 5' side of the large intron."

https://openalex.org/W1984093090,"Abstract Cellular fibronectin is a major cell surface glycoprotein that can mediate the adhesion of cells to collagen in vitro. To analyze its mechanism of action, we have undertaken experiments to isolate fragments of fibroblast fibronectin that retain different active sites. In this paper, we describe the purification of three chymotryptic fragments with apparent molecular weights of 40,000, 160,000 and 205,000 from chicken cellular fibronectin. These fragments were electrophoretically pure and retained different biologically active sites, as determined by a series of bioassays and competitive inhibition experiments. The 40K fragment was identified as the collagen-binding fragment. The 160K fragment was found to contain the cell surface-binding site(s) of cellular fibronectin. The 205K fragment contained both collagen-binding and cell surface-binding sites, and apparently represents the sum of the 40K and 160K fragments. When native fibronectin is cleaved to the 205K fragment, a polypeptide region containing all interchain disulfide bonds is lost. This alteration was accompanied by decreased hemagglutinating activity and loss of the capacity to restore a normal morphology to transformed cells, whereas cell attachment to collagen and cell spreading activities remained. Our results directly support the idea that the fibronectin molecule consists of separate structural domains containing different biological characteristics."

https://openalex.org/W1973455868,"Four different regions of rabbit beta-like globin gene sequences designated beta 1, beta 2, beta 3 and beta 4 were identified in a set of clones isolated from a bacteriophage lambda library of chromosomal DNA fragments (Maniatis et al., 1978). Restriction mapping and blot hybridization (Southern, 1975) studies indicate that a subset of these clones containing beta 1 and beta 2 hybridizes to an adult beta-globin cDNA clone (Maniatis et al., 1976) more efficiently than to a human gamma-globin cDNA clone (Wilson et al., 1978), while another subset containing beta 3 and beta 4 displays the converse hybridization specificity. beta 1 was identified as the adult beta-globin gene, while beta 2, beta 3 and beta 4 have not been identified with any known rabbit globin polypeptides. Cross-hybridization and transcriptional orientation experiments indicate that the set of beta-like gene clones contains overlapping restriction fragments encompassing 44 kb of rabbit chromosomal DNA. In addition, all four genes have the same transcriptional orientation and are arranged in the order 5'-beta 4-beta 3-beta 2-beta 1-3'."

https://openalex.org/W2041514880,"The complexity of nonadenylated mRNA [poly(A)-mRNA] has been determined by hybridization with single-copy DNA (scDNA) and cDNA. Our results show that poly(A)- and poly(A)+ mRNA are essentially nonoverlapping (nonhomologous) sequence populations of similar complexity. The sum of the complexities of poly(A)+ mRNA and poly(A)- mRNA is equal to that of total polysomal RNA or total mRNA, or the equivalent of approximately 1.7 x 10(5) different sequences 1.5 kb in length. Poly(A)- mRNA, isolated from polysomal RNA by benzoylated cellulose chromatography, hybridized with 3.6% of the scDNA, corresponding to a complexity of 7.8 x 10(4) different 1.5 kb sequences. The equivalent of only one adenosine tract of approximately 20 nucleotides per 100 poly(A)- mRNA molecules 1.5 kb in size was observed by hybridization with poly(U). cDNA was transcribed from poly(A)- mRNA using random oligonucleotides as primers. Only 1-2% of the single-copy fraction of this cDNA was hybridized using poly(A)+ mRNA as a driver. These results show that poly(A)- mRNA shares few sequences with poly(A)+ mRNA and thus constitutes a separate, complex class of messenger RNA. These measurements preclude the presence of a complex class of bimorphic mRNAs [that is, species present in both poly(A)+ and poly(A)- forms] in brain polysomes."

https://openalex.org/W2011357268,"A 13.5 Kb fragment of Bombyx mori DNA containing a single tRNA2Ala gene has been cloned, and transcribed in vitro with Xenopus germinal vesicle extracts. The primary transcription product of the tRNA2Ala gene has been isolated and shown to possess an unprocessed triphosphorylated 5' terminus. Products resulting from processing of this transcript have also been isolated and characterized. Complete nucleotide sequence analysis of this cloned alanine tRNA gene and its primary transcript shows that transcription initiates three nucleotides away from the mature tRNA2Ala 5' end and terminates in a U cluster 22 nucleotides beyond the last encoded 3' nucleotide of the mature species. Sequence determination of the products of in vitro maturation shows that in contrast to the tRNA processing mechanism characteristic of procaryotes, the extra 3'-nucleotides in this silkworm tRNA precursor are removed by a single endonucleolytic cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W2055284010,"A cDNA library has been constructed from an RNA preparation highly enriched in silkmoth chorion mRNAs. Many distinct clones have been identified from this library using a stepwise procedure: scoring for infrequent hexanucleotide restriction enzyme recognition sequences; detailed characterization with restriction enzymes that recognize relatively frequent tetranucleotide sequences; probing the arrangement of the corresponding sequences in chromosomal DNA by the Southern procedure; and detailed cross-hybridization analysis. Unique clones, as well as two classes of distinct but related clones, were revealed by hybridization. The cross-hybridization analysis was greatly facilitated by a newly developed, semiquantitative dot hybridization procedure. The same procedure made it feasible to conveniently estimate the relative abundance of several different sequences in an mRNA mixture. Cloned sequences which scored as relatively abundant in total chorion mRNA were tested with stage-specific chorion mRNA at a very stringent criterion of hybridization. They were thus characterized as early, middle or late sequences with respect to development. The characterized cDNA clones can now be used as probes for studying the evolution, chromosomal organization and regulated developmental expression of the chorion multigene families."

https://openalex.org/W2169538498,"We have previously reported that chromatin preparations from human cultured fibroblasts contain a single homologous serum protein. In this paper we present evidence, based on immunological identity and physicochemical properties, that this serum protein is fibronectin. Furthermore, using a radioimmunoassay system, we have estimated that fibronectin represents about 0.7% of the total protein in both chromatin preparations and whole fibroblasts. Using a nitrocellulose filter assay system, we also show that fibronectin is a DNA-binding protein having an equilibrium constant of 4.6 × 10−6 M. Equilibrium competition experiments have demonstrated that fibronectin has the ability to differentiate among nucleotides, indicating that fibronectin-DNA interaction is at least partially specific, and that a minimum polymer length of 12–18 nucleotides is required for effective binding to occur. Fibronectin has been isolated readily from plasma using DNA-affinity chromatography. We do not have direct evidence that fibronectin is an actual nonhistone chromosomal protein, but fibronectin is a DNA-binding protein (at least under in vitro assay conditions) and appears to be a normal constituent of chromatin as chromatin is currently isolated from cell nuclei."
https://openalex.org/W2026284254,"Mutant dl 309 is a viable Ad5 deletion mutant. Whereas wild-type Ad5-infected HeLa cells contain two VAI RNA species [VAI(A) and VAI(G)] which differ by three nucleotides at their 5' ends, dl 309-infected HeLa cells contain VAI(G) but no VAI(A) RNA. Nucleotide sequence analysis indicates that dl 309 lacks two base pairs which precede the 5' end of VAI(A) by 22 nucleotides. Since the 5' ends of VAI RNAs are not processed, the 309 deletion serves to identify a portion of the sequence required for RNA polymerase III initiation. Since dl 309 grows as well as wild-type Ad5 in HeLa cells, the VAI(A) species is not essential for viral growth in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W2126801687,"Complete or partial sequences are reported from six chorion cDNA clones of the silkmoth Antheraea polyphemus. The proteins encoded belong to the two major chorion protein classes, A and B, each of which is encoded by a multigene family. The sequence comparisons define some major features of the families and suggest how these genes may be evolving. Deletions and insertions might be involved in expanding or contracting internally repetitive regions. Sequence divergence is localized, thus defining sequence domains of distinct evolutionary properties and presumably distinct functions."
https://openalex.org/W1997529213,"Five independent clones containing the natural chicken ovomucoid gene have been isolated from a chicken gene library. One of these clones, CL21, contains the complete ovomucoid gene and includes more than 3 kb of DNA sequences flanking both termini of the gene. Restriction endonuclease mapping, electron microscopy and direct DNA sequencing analyses of this clone have revealed that the ovomucoid gene is 5.6 kb long and codes for a messenger RNA of 821 nucleotides. The structural gene sequence coding Ifor the mature messenger RNA is split into at least eight segments by a minimum of seven intervening sequences of various sizes. The shortest structural gene segment is only 20 nucleotides long. All seven intervening sequences are located within the peptide coding region of the gene, and the sequences at the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions of the mRNA are not interrupted by intervening sequences. The DNA sequences of the regions flanking the 5′ and 3′ termini of the gene have been determined. Thirty nucleotides before the start of the messenger RNA coding sequence is the heptanucleotide TATATAT, which is also present in a similar location relative to the chicken ovalbumin gene and other unique sequence eucaryotic genes. This sequence resembles that of the Pribnow box in procaryotic genes where a promoter function has been implicated. Seven nucleotides past the 3′ end of the gene is the tetranucleotide TTGT, a sequence found to be present at identical locations as either TTTT or TTGT in other eucaryotic genes that have been sequenced. These conserved DNA sequences flanking eucaryotic genes may serve some regulatory function in the expression of these genes."

The action of choline is suppressed by atropine but not by two agents that block choline uptake (hemicholinium-3 and triethylcholine), and is not potentiated by an anticholinesterase (physostigmine). Choline therefore appears to excite cortical neurons by a direct action, which may be a significant component of its beneficial therapeutic effects."

https://openalex.org/W1990387781,"DNA (760 bp) isolated from nucleosome tetramers of staphylococcal nuclease-digested chicken embryo chromatin was highly enriched for tRNA genes and subsequently cloned in E. coli chi 1776. The location of genes coding for chicken embryo tRNALys, tRNAPhe and tRNAiMet within the cloned nucleosome tetramer DNA was determined using restriction endonucleases for which single cleavage sites could be predicted from the respective tRNA base sequence. All our tRNA genes reside nonrandomly at four locations on nucleosome tetramer DNA. The spacing between the tRNA gene locations is approximately 190 bp, similar to the DNA repeat length of chicken embryo chromatin. The four tRNA gene locations were also defined in noncloned nucleosome tetramer DNA highly enriched for tRNA genes. The majority of genes coding for tRNALys, tRNAPhe and tRNAiMet, respectively, are located in equal proportion 40-45, 230, 420 and 610 bp distant from the 5' end of the tRNA-identical strand. Thus the tRNA structural gene sequences all appear to begin about 20 bp ""inside"" the nucleosome core. As observed with nucleosomal DNA not enriched for tRNA genes, the phase relationship between tRNA genes and nucleosome location is maintained over a distance of 4-6 subsequent nucleosomes. A cloned molecule of nucleosomal DNA containing both a tRNALys gene and a tRNAiMet gene in the same polarity reveals that a phase adjustment might be necessary for the nucleosomes between these two tRNA genes in chicken embryo chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W2050340626,"Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) is a biotransformation product of theophylline (1,3-dimethylxanthine) in the human fetus. Liver explants, obtained from human fetuses with gestational ages of 12 to 20 weeks, were incubated with theophylline and produced caffeine and, in lesser amounts, 1,3-dimethyluric acid and 3-methylxanthine. These findings suggest that the predominant pathway in theophylline metabolism in the fetus and newborn infant is the methylation reaction producing caffeine. This may contribute to the neonate's exceedingly slower elimination of caffeine relative to theophylline. Caffeine produced from theophylline may add to the pharmacologic effects of theophylline in newborn infants with apnea."

https://openalex.org/W2002547486,"Upon treatment with agents such as thrombin, collagen or concanavalin A, blood platelets change shape, secrete serotonin and phosphorylate two proteins having molecular weights of approximately 20,000 and 40,000. We have analyzed the relationship of this protein phosphorylation to shape change and release aided by the fact that while shape change occurs independently of extracellular calcium, release of serotonin displays a rather strict calcium requirement. Under limited calcium conditions, where virtually no serotonin release occurs, (Con A)-stimulated phosphorylation is uninhibited. Divalent cations (Mg++, Co++ and Zn++) also inhibit release but not phosphorylation. The microtubule effectors colchicine and D2O show concomitant effects on release and phosphorylation, indicating a microtubule involvement prior to phosphorylation. Papaverine inhibits release and phosphorylation while not strongly influencing shape change, suggesting that shape change does not require phosphorylation. We therefore conclude that phosphorylation of these proteins takes place after shape change but prior to release, and although it may be required for secretion to occur, the two processes are easily separated. Thus phosphorylation of these proteins is not likely to be an integral component of the release mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2003042258,"Within 72–96 hr after preparation, about 10% of the karyoplasts made from mouse L929 cells regenerated to reform whole viable cells. As soon as 30 hr after preparation, however, nearly all of the remaining 90% of karyoplasts were dead. By separating living and dead karyoplasts at 30 hr, therefore, that fraction destined to complete regeneration was effectively purified. Complete separation was accomplished by sedimentation through Ficoll-paque (Pharmacia), a patented preparation originally developed for the separation of monocytes from whole blood. With the addition of this technique to the previously reported purification scheme for karyoplasts, various biochemical and morphological studies were attempted. Of particular importance are results indicating that karyoplasts that regenerate do not initially contain any more cytoplasm than the average karyoplast in a preparation—that is, about 10% of the cytoplasm within a whole cell. Electron microscopy of karyoplasts immediately after preparation indicated an unequal partitioning of cytoplasmic organelles at the time of enucleation. For example, karyoplasts initially contained about 11.4% of the mitochondrial volume of whole cells, but only 2.9% of the Golgi apparatus. The size of the karyoplasts and the volume occupied by a variety of organelles was followed throughout the process of regeneration. Although there was an approximately linear increase in the diameter of regenerating karyoplasts, there appeared not to be a simple concordant increase in the volume occupied by all cellular organelles. An extensive investigation was performed to determine whether or not karyoplasts contained centrioles. Immediately after enucleation, 15,000 random thin sections through karyoplasts, which represented about 100 complete bodies, were examined for the presence or absence of centrioles. No centrioles were observed. Examination of the cytoplasts revealed that they contained a sufficient number of centrioles to account for all of the centrioles that were present in the whole cells before enucleation. Centrioles were first detected in karyoplasts at 24 hr after preparation, about the same time that karyoplasts regained the ability to adhere to the surface of tissue culture dishes. At this time, however, the average karyoplast had less than one centriole. By 72 hr, the regenerated karyoplasts had approximately the same number of centrioles as whole cells."

https://openalex.org/W2132531241,"We have analyzed the histone genes from the sea urchin Lytechinus pictus. Examination of native DNA from individuals reveals four major Eco RI restriction endonuclease histone gene DNA fragments which have been labeled A (6.0 kb), B (4.1 kb), C (3.1kb) and D (1.2 kb). The fragments A, B and C have been cloned into E. coli plasmids (pLpA, pLpB and pLpC). These histone gene fragments display length and sequence heterogeneity in different individuals. The plasmid pLpA contains the coding regions for H1, H4, H2B and H3 histones, and we determined that the DNA fragment D is tandem to A in native DNA and that it contains the H2A gene. The plasmids pLpB and pLpC contain the histone genes H2A-H1-H4 and H2B-H3, respectively, and together contain the sequences for the five major histones. Restriction analysis of native L. pictus DNA reveals that B and C are tandem to each other but not intermingled with the A--D-type repeat units, and are thus in separate clusters with a repeat length of 7.2 kb. Since the two cluster types do not segregate, they are not alleles. Hybridization of histone mRNA to exonuclease III-digested linear DNA demonstrated an identical polarity of the histone genes in the A--D- and B--C-type repeat units. This result revealed that the L. pictus histone genes have a polarity which is the same as other sea urchin histone genes examined to date--that is, 3' H1-H4-H2B-H3-H2A 5'. Restriction endonuclease cleavage patterns of the cloned segments indicate that considerable sequence heterogeneity exists between the two types of histone gene repeat units."

The shifts in perception of size occurred whether individual stripes in the grating were narrower than, equal to, or wider than the rectangle. Rectangle width was underestimated only if the grating stripes were extremely wide, with a spatial frequency lower than most of the effective amplitude spectrum of the rectangle. These findings (and complementary ones with horizontal gratings) suggest that the visual system codes size on the basis of spatial frequency components, rather than directly in terms of width."
https://openalex.org/W1999782053,"Mesenchymal cells isolated from stage 24 embryonic chicken limb buds were infected with the temperature-sensitive transformation mutants of Rous sarcoma virus tsNY68, tsNY10 and tsLA25 at the nonpermissive temperature for transformation (41 degrees C). Virus infection greatly inhibited subsequent limb bud chondrogenesis under nontransforming conditions, as indicated by a reduction in the rate of 35SO4 incorporation into cell-associated proteoglycans. The inhibition of chondrogenesis was directly related to the percentage of cells infected with tsNY68 at 41 degrees C. The observed inhibition of chondrogenesis was independent of src gene expression since this effect was also caused by many viruses which lack the src gene, including the leukosis viruses RAV-1, RAV-2 and MAV-2(0); the src deletion mutant RSVtd107; and the reticuloendotheliosis viruses REV-T and SNV. Infection of mesenchymal cells with tsNY68 under nontransforming conditions did not cause changes in parameters such as the rate of thymidine incorporation, total cell DNA and total cell protein. Infection with tsNY68 at 41 degrees C resulted in altered kinetics of 35SO4 incorporation into cell-associated proteoglycans and a corresponding reduction in 35SO4-labeled proteoglycans extracted from the cell layer. There were no apparent quantitative effects on the rate of accumulation of proteoglycans in the culture medium. The proteoglycans extracted from the cells and the collected medium of tsNY68-infected cultures were smaller than those of uninfected cultures, as shown by agarose gel chromatography."
