Although often attributed to unhealthy lifestyle choices or environmental factors, obesity is known to be heritable and highly polygenic; the majority of inherited susceptibility is related to the cumulative effect of many common DNA variants. Here we derive and validate a new polygenic predictor comprised of 2.1 million common variants to quantify this susceptibility and test this predictor in more than 300,000 individuals ranging from middle age to birth. Among middle-aged adults, we observe a 13-kg gradient in weight and a 25-fold gradient in risk of severe obesity across polygenic score deciles. In a longitudinal birth cohort, we note minimal differences in birthweight across score deciles, but a significant gradient emerged in early childhood and reached 12 kg by 18 years of age. This new approach to quantify inherited susceptibility to obesity affords new opportunities for clinical prevention and mechanistic assessment.

This new approach to quantify inherited susceptibility to obesity affords new opportunities for clinical prevention and mechanistic assessment. Severe obesity, defined as a BMI of 40 kg/m2 or more, is a rapidly growing public health issue already afflicting 8% of American adults (Flegal et al., 2016Flegal K.M. Kruszon-Moran D. Carroll M.D. Fryar C.D. Ogden C.L.

Res. 1998; 6: 51S-209SPubMed Google Scholar). Although present in less than 1% of the population in middle-income countries such as India and China, the prevalence of severe obesity in these countries has increased more than 100-fold over the last three decades and shows no signs of slowing (NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC), 2017NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC)Worldwide trends in body-mass index, underweight, overweight, and obesity from 1975 to 2016: a pooled analysis of 2416 population-based measurement studies in 128·9 million children, adolescents, and adults.Lancet. 2017; 390: 2627-2642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3851) Google Scholar). Individuals with severe obesity are often stigmatized because of the commonly held belief that their condition results primarily from unhealthy lifestyle choices (Tomiyama et al., 2018Tomiyama A.J.

However, obesity is known to be heritable, suggesting that inborn DNA variation confers increased susceptibility in some individuals and protection in others (Elks et al., 2012Elks C.E. den Hoed M.

Inherited susceptibility to obesity can, in rare cases, be attributed to a large-effect mutation that perturbs energy homeostasis or fat deposition (Barsh et al., 2000Barsh G.S. Farooqi I.S. O’Rahilly S. Genetics of body-weight regulation.Nature. 2000; 404: 644-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). For example, genetic inactivation of the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) gene is associated with obesity in both mouse models and humans (Farooqi et al., 2003Farooqi I.S. Keogh J.M. Yeo G.S. Lank E.J.

However, for the vast majority of severely obese individuals, no such monogenic mutation can be identified (Larsen et al., 2005Larsen L.H. Echwald S.M. Sørensen T.I. Andersen T. Wulff B.S.

Their genetic susceptibility may instead result from the cumulative effects of numerous variants with individually modest effects—a “polygenic” model. This paradigm is similar to other complex diseases in which polygenic inheritance, involving many common genetic variants, accounts for the majority of inherited susceptibility (Golan et al., 2014Golan D.

Genet. 2015; 96: 377-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). A recently published genome-wide association study (GWAS) quantified the relationship between each of 2.1 million common genetic variants and BMI in over 300,000 individuals (Locke et al., 2015Locke A.E. Kahali B. Berndt S.I. Justice A.E. Pers T.H. Day F.R. Powell C. Vedantam S. Buchkovich M.L.

None of the individual variants account for a large proportion of the phenotype. The strongest association was noted for a common variant at the FTO locus; the risk allele was associated with a statistically robust but clinically modest increase in weight of approximately 1 kg per inherited risk allele. Obtaining meaningful predictive power thus requires aggregating information from many common variants into a polygenic score (Chatterjee et al., 2016Chatterjee N. Shi J. García-Closas M. Developing and evaluating polygenic risk prediction models for stratified disease prevention.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2016; 17: 392-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, Khera et al., 2018Khera A.V. Chaffin M. Aragam K.G. Haas M.E. Roselli C. Choi S.H. Natarajan P. Lander E.S. Lubitz S.A.

Genet. 2018; 50: 1219-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). However, previous efforts to create an effective polygenic score for obesity have had only modest success (Loos and Janssens, 2017Loos R.J.F. Janssens A.C.J.W. Predicting Polygenic Obesity Using Genetic Information.Cell Metab. 2017; 25: 535-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Here we use recently developed computational algorithms and large datasets to derive, validate, and test a robust polygenic predictor of BMI and obesity. This genome-wide polygenic score (GPS) integrates all available common variants into a single quantitative measure of inherited susceptibility. It identifies a subset of the adult population that is at substantial risk of severe obesity—in some cases equivalent to rare monogenic mutations—and others that enjoy considerable protection. The GPS is associated with only minimal differences in birthweight, but it predicts clear differences in weight during early childhood and profound differences in weight trajectory and risk of developing severe obesity in subsequent years. To create a GPS, we obtained the average effects for each of 2,100,302 genetic variants on BMI from the largest published GWAS study of obesity to date (Locke et al., 2015Locke A.E. Kahali B. Berndt S.I. Justice A.E. Pers T.H. Day F.R. Powell C. Vedantam S. Buchkovich M.L.

We used a recently developed computational algorithm to reweight each variant according to the effect size and strength of statistical significance observed in the prior GWAS, the degree of correlation between a variant and others nearby, and a tuning parameter that denotes the proportion of variants with non-zero effect size (Vilhjálmsson et al., 2015Vilhjálmsson B.J. Yang J. Finucane H.K. Gusev A. Lindström S. Ripke S. Genovese G. Loh P.R. Bhatia G. Do R. et al.Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, Discovery, Biology, and Risk of Inherited Variants in Breast Cancer (DRIVE) studyModeling Linkage Disequilibrium Increases Accuracy of Polygenic Risk Scores.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2015; 97: 576-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Because the best choice of this tuning parameter is difficult to know a priori, a range of 5 values was tested, as recommended previously (Vilhjálmsson et al., 2015Vilhjálmsson B.J. Yang J. Finucane H.K. Gusev A. Lindström S. Ripke S. Genovese G. Loh P.R. Bhatia G.

J. Hum. Genet. 2015; 97: 576-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). We set out to validate these 5 scores and to choose the best score for further analysis by testing their ability to predict measured BMI in a validation dataset of 119,951 middle-aged adult participants of the UK Biobank. The UK Biobank enrolled participants aged 40 to 69 years from across the United Kingdom and allows linkage of measurements such as BMI to extensive genetic data (Bycroft et al., 2018Bycroft C. Freeman C. Petkova D. Band G. Elliott L.T. Sharp K. Motyer A. Vukcevic D. Delaneau O.

Within this dataset, we estimated the heritability of BMI explained by common variants to be 23.4% using a recently developed approach (Bulik-Sullivan et al., 2015Bulik-Sullivan B.K. Loh P.R.

Genet. 2015; 96: 377-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Each of the five candidate GPSs was strongly associated with observed BMI (p < 0.0001), with similar correlation coefficients ranging from 0.283 to 0.292 (Table S1). Nearly identical results were obtained after adjustment of each of the candidate GPSs for genetic background, as assessed by principal components of ancestry (Table S2). We selected the best score, with a correlation of 0.292, to take forward into four testing datasets below. Additional details of GPS derivation and validation are provided in Figure 1 and the STAR Methods. Our GPS of 2,100,302 variants had substantially greater predictive power than a sixth polygenic score comprised of only the 141 independent variants that had reached genome-wide levels of statistical significance in the prior GWAS. Within the 119,951 participants in the validation dataset, correlation with BMI for this 141-variant score was only 0.133. This lower strength of association using fewer variants is consistent with earlier studies, where predictors of up to 97 variants had a relatively low correlation with measured BMI, ranging from 0.01 to 0.12 (Belsky et al., 2013Belsky D.W.

Having derived and validated a new polygenic predictor that considerably outperformed earlier scores, we explored the predictive power of the GPS on BMI, weight, and severe obesity in 306,135 individuals of four independent testing datasets, spanning an age spectrum from middle age to time of birth (Table 1).Table 1Genome-wide Polygenic Score for Obesity, Assessed in Four Independent Testing DatasetsUK BiobankPartners HealthCareFramingham Offspring/CARDIAAvon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Childrenn participants288,0166,5363,7227,861Study designcross-sectionalcase-controllongitudinallongitudinalAge range40–69 years≥18 years18–40 yearsbirthFemale sex55%61%48%49%Outcomesweight, severe obesity, bariatric surgery, cardiometabolic diseases, mortalitybariatric surgeryincident severe obesity (27 years median follow-up)weight at birth and subsequent visits (0–18 years)CARDIA, Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults.

We determined the extent to which the GPS predicted weight and severe obesity in a testing dataset of 288,016 middle-aged participants of the UK Biobank (independent of the 119,951 validation dataset participants studied above). The participant mean age was 57 years, and 55% were female. The mean weight was 78.1 kg, and the mean BMI was 27.4 kg/m2. 23.9% of the participants were obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2), and 1.8% met criteria for severe obesity. The GPS approximated a normal distribution in the population (Figure S1). The correlation of the GPS and observed BMI was 0.29, identical to the UK Biobank validation dataset. Correlations were similar when participants were stratified into 5-year age bins, ranging from 0.28 to 0.31 (Table S3). We next stratified the population according to GPS decile and found a striking gradient with respect to BMI, weight, and prevalence of obesity (Figures 2A–2C). For example, the average BMI was 30.0 kg/m2 for those in the top decile of the GPS and 25.2 kg/m2 for those in the bottom decile, a difference of 4.8 kg/m2 (p < 0.0001). Similarly, the average weight was 85.3 kg for those in the top decile versus 72.2 kg for those in the bottom decile, a difference of 13.0 kg (p < 0.0001). 43.2% of those in the top decile were obese versus 9.5% of those in the bottom decile (Figure S2). Severe obesity was present in 1,621 of 28,784 (5.6%) in the top decile of the GPS versus 69 of 28,834 (0.2%) in the bottom decile, corresponding to a 25-fold gradient in risk of severe obesity (p < 0.0001).Figure S2Relationship of Genome-wide Polygenic Score Distribution with Obesity, Related to Figure 2Show full caption288,016 middle-aged UK Biobank participants were binned into 10 deciles according to the polygenic score, with significant differences in the prevalence of obesity (body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m2) noted across deciles of the polygenic score (p < 0.0001).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) 288,016 middle-aged UK Biobank participants were binned into 10 deciles according to the polygenic score, with significant differences in the prevalence of obesity (body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m2) noted across deciles of the polygenic score (p < 0.0001). Despite the strength of these associations, polygenic susceptibility to obesity is not deterministic. Among those in the top decile of the GPS, 83% were overweight or obese, but 17% had a BMI within the normal range, and 0.2% were underweight (Figure 2D). These results were nearly identical after adjustment of the GPS for genetic background, as assessed by principal components of ancestry (Figure S3). Traditional analyses of rare genetic mutations are performed by comparing heterozygous mutation carriers with noncarriers. An important example is the p.Tyr35Ter premature stop codon in MC4R present in 0.02% of the population and typically inherited as a shared haplotype with the p.Asp37Val missense mutation, which has been shown previously to completely inactivate MC4R activity in in vitro functional assays (Larsen et al., 2005Larsen L.H. Echwald S.M. Sørensen T.I. Andersen T. Wulff B.S. Pedersen O.

A recent analysis linked this variant to an average weight increase of 7 kg (Turcot et al., 2018Turcot V. Lu Y. Highland H.M. Schurmann C. Justice A.E. Fine R.S. Bradfield J.P. Esko T. Giri A.

Genet. 2018; 50: 26-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). We sought to mimic this approach using the GPS by labeling the top decile of the GPS distribution as “carriers” and those in the remainder of the distribution as non-carriers (Figure 3A). The 10% of the population who carried a “high GPS” demonstrated an average BMI that was 2.9 kg/m2 higher and a weight 8.0 kg higher than noncarriers (p < 0.0001 for both comparisons). The results were similar when high-GPS carriers were compared with individuals within the middle quintile of the score distribution instead of the bottom 90% of the distribution, with differences in BMI and weight of 2.6 kg/m2 and 7.4 kg, respectively. Furthermore, the magnitude of risk conferred by a high GPS increased at more extreme levels of observed obesity. The proportion of high-GPS carriers was 9.7% among individuals with a BMI of less than 40 kg/m2, 31% among the 5,232 individuals with a BMI of 40 kg/m2 or more, 42.3% among the 331 individuals with a BMI of 50 kg/m2 or more, and 61.5% among the 26 individuals with a BMI of 60 kg/m2 or more. Compared with the remainder of the GPS distribution, a high GPS was associated with a 4.2-, 6.6-, and 14.4-fold increased risk of a BMI of 40, 50, and 60 kg/m2 or more, respectively (Figure 3B). Another indicator of extreme obesity involves individuals who undergo treatment with bariatric surgery, acknowledging that factors in addition to severity of obesity contribute to the decision to move forward with an invasive procedure to assist with weight loss. We identified 208 such participants in the UK Biobank testing dataset, of whom 81 (38.9%) carried a high GPS. This finding was replicated among 714 severely obese patients treated with bariatric surgery within the Partners HealthCare System (Hatoum et al., 2013Hatoum I.J. Greenawalt D.M. Cotsapas C. Daly M.J. Reitman M.L. Kaplan L.M. Weight loss after gastric bypass is associated with a variant at 15q26.1.Am. J. Hum.

Med. 2016; 6: E2Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). 238 of these 714 (33%) patients carried a high GPS. A combined analysis of the 922 bariatric surgery participants noted a high GPS in 319 (34.6%). Compared with the remainder of the distribution, a high GPS was associated with a 5.0-fold increased risk of severe obesity treated with bariatric surgery (Figure 3B). Beyond severe obesity, individuals in the UK Biobank who carried a high GPS were at increased risk for six common cardiometabolic diseases, including a 28% increased risk of coronary artery disease, a 72% increased risk for diabetes mellitus, a 38% increased risk for hypertension, a 34% increased risk for congestive heart failure, a 23% increased risk for ischemic stroke, and a 41% increased risk for venous thromboembolism (p < 0.05 for each; Figure 4). We next determined the relationship between a high polygenic score and all-cause mortality. Death following enrollment occurred in 8,102 (2.8%) participants over a median follow-up of 7.1 years, including 940 (3.3%) of those in the top decile of the polygenic score distribution and 7,162 (2.8%) in the remainder of the distribution (p < 0.0001). In a survival analysis that additionally included time to death in the statistical model, a high polygenic score was associated with a 19% increased risk of incident mortality (p < 0.0001). Rare inactivating mutations in the MC4R gene are among the most common monogenic mutations for obesity (Farooqi et al., 2003Farooqi I.S. Keogh J.M. Yeo G.S. Lank E.J. Cheetham T. O’Rahilly S.

Here, we used host sensing of small molecules by G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) as a lens to illuminate bioactive microbial metabolites that impact host physiology. We screened 144 human gut bacteria against the non-olfactory GPCRome and identified dozens of bacteria that activated both well-characterized and orphan GPCRs, including strains that converted dietary histidine into histamine and shaped colonic motility; a prolific producer of the essential amino acid L-Phe, which we identified as an agonist for GPR56 and GPR97; and a species that converted L-Phe into the potent psychoactive trace amine phenethylamine, which crosses the blood-brain barrier and triggers lethal phenethylamine poisoning after monoamine oxidase inhibitor administration. These studies establish an orthogonal approach for parsing the microbiota metabolome and uncover multiple biologically relevant host-microbiota metabolome interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2937386865,"DNA repair has been hypothesized to be a longevity determinant, but the evidence for it is based largely on accelerated aging phenotypes of DNA repair mutants. Here, using a panel of 18 rodent species with diverse lifespans, we show that more robust DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, but not nucleotide excision repair (NER), coevolves with longevity. Evolution of NER, unlike DSB, is shaped primarily by sunlight exposure. We further show that the capacity of the SIRT6 protein to promote DSB repair accounts for a major part of the variation in DSB repair efficacy between short- and long-lived species. We dissected the molecular differences between a weak (mouse) and a strong (beaver) SIRT6 protein and identified five amino acid residues that are fully responsible for their differential activities. Our findings demonstrate that DSB repair and SIRT6 have been optimized during the evolution of longevity, which provides new targets for anti-aging interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2938430282,"Expansion of transposable elements (TEs) coincides with evolutionary shifts in gene expression. TEs frequently harbor binding sites for transcriptional regulators, thus enabling coordinated genome-wide activation of species- and context-specific gene expression programs, but such regulation must be balanced against their genotoxic potential. Here, we show that Krüppel-associated box (KRAB)-containing zinc finger proteins (KZFPs) control the timely and pleiotropic activation of TE-derived transcriptional cis regulators during early embryogenesis. Evolutionarily recent SVA, HERVK, and HERVH TE subgroups contribute significantly to chromatin opening during human embryonic genome activation and are KLF-stimulated enhancers in naive human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). KZFPs of corresponding evolutionary ages are simultaneously induced and repress the transcriptional activity of these TEs. Finally, the same KZFP-controlled TE-based enhancers later serve as developmental and tissue-specific enhancers. Thus, by controlling the transcriptional impact of TEs during embryogenesis, KZFPs facilitate their genome-wide incorporation into transcriptional networks, thereby contributing to human genome regulation."

We functionally characterized 61 MC4R variants identified in 0.5 million people from UK Biobank and examined their associations with body mass index (BMI) and obesity-related cardiometabolic diseases. We found that the maximal efficacy of β-arrestin recruitment to MC4R, rather than canonical Gαs-mediated cyclic adenosine-monophosphate production, explained 88% of the variance in the association of MC4R variants with BMI. While most MC4R variants caused loss of function, a subset caused gain of function; these variants were associated with significantly lower BMI and lower odds of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and coronary artery disease. Protective associations were driven by MC4R variants exhibiting signaling bias toward β-arrestin recruitment and increased mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activation. Harnessing β-arrestin-biased MC4R signaling may represent an effective strategy for weight loss and the treatment of obesity-related cardiometabolic diseases.

Harnessing β-arrestin-biased MC4R signaling may represent an effective strategy for weight loss and the treatment of obesity-related cardiometabolic diseases. Obesity is associated with type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease, which together account for significant morbidity, mortality, and substantial healthcare costs globally (Heymsfield and Wadden, 2017Heymsfield S.B. Wadden T.A. Mechanisms, Pathophysiology, and Management of Obesity.N. Engl. J. Med. 2017; 376: 254-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). While advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in weight regulation have informed the development of new weight-loss therapies, some drugs lack target specificity, while others affect multiple signaling pathways downstream of their intended target, leading to adverse effects that limit their long-term use (Bray et al., 2016Bray G.A. Frühbeck G. Ryan D.H. Wilding J.P. Management of obesity.Lancet. 2016; 387: 1947-1956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Therefore, there is a substantial unmet need for safe and effective weight-loss therapies. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are targeted by approximately 30% of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medicines, highlighting their tractability for drug discovery (Hauser et al., 2017Hauser A.S. Attwood M.M. Rask-Andersen M. Schiöth H.B. Gloriam D.E. Trends in GPCR drug discovery: new agents, targets and indications.Nat. Rev.

Oprea T.I. Overington J.P. A comprehensive map of molecular drug targets.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2017; 16: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). Classically, upon ligand binding, GPCRs interact with heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding (G) proteins to direct signaling and gene transcription, a response that is attenuated within minutes when phosphorylated GPCRs bind β-arrestins, which sterically prevent their coupling to G proteins (Rajagopal and Shenoy, 2018Rajagopal S. Shenoy S.K. GPCR desensitization: Acute and prolonged phases.Cell. Signal. 2018; 41: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This molecular interaction also promotes the internalization of ligand-bound receptors to early endosomes, from where GPCRs either recycle rapidly to the cell membrane or translocate to lysosomes for degradation (Shenoy and Lefkowitz, 2011Shenoy S.K. Lefkowitz R.J. β-Arrestin-mediated receptor trafficking and signal transduction.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2011; 32: 521-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, Shinyama et al., 2003Shinyama H. Masuzaki H. Fang H. Flier J.S. Regulation of melanocortin-4 receptor signaling: agonist-mediated desensitization and internalization.Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 1301-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). β-arrestins may also directly/indirectly mediate signaling via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-mediated phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). While balanced GPCR agonists signal with comparable efficacy through multiple pathways, the development of biased agonists, which preferentially activate signaling through either G protein-dependent or G protein-independent β-arrestin-mediated pathways, is emerging as a powerful way of emphasizing favorable signals, while de-emphasizing signals that may lead to adverse effects (Povsic et al., 2017Povsic T.J.

Such targeted drug discovery relies on the precise delineation of the relative contributions of G proteins versus β-arrestins to the physiological consequences of GPCR activation. Here, we focused on the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R), a brain-expressed Gαs-coupled GPCR involved in weight regulation (Fan et al., 1997Fan W. Boston B.A. Kesterson R.A. Hruby V.J. Cone R.D.

Feeding-induced release of the melanocortin peptides, α- and β-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), leads to activation of MC4R-expressing neurons, resulting in reduced food intake (Cowley et al., 2001Cowley M.A. Smart J.L.

Targeted deletion of Mc4r in rodents causes weight gain in a gene-dosage-dependent manner (Huszar et al., 1997Huszar D. Lynch C.A. Fairchild-Huntress V. Dunmore J.H. Fang Q. Berkemeier L.R. Gu W.

In humans, rare heterozygous MC4R variants that reduce Gαs-mediated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation in cells have been identified in obese children and adults in many populations (Vaisse et al., 1998Vaisse C.

We hypothesized that a more refined understanding of MC4R signaling and its impact on clinical phenotypes in the general population may inform the design of drugs targeting this pathway to treat common obesity and its complications. We performed genetic association studies in approximately 0.5 million people from UK Biobank, focusing on 61 nonsynonymous variants identified in MC4R. 12 of the 61 were nonsense/frameshift variants; the remainder (n = 49) were missense variants whose functional properties were characterized in cells quantifying canonical Gαs-mediated cAMP production and the recruitment of β-arrestin to MC4R. In meta-regression analyses using the functional consequence of MC4R variants as the predictor, we found that 88% of the variance in the association of different MC4R variants with BMI was explained by their effect on β-arrestin recruitment. A subset of individuals (6%, n = 28,161) were carriers for gain-of-function (GoF) alleles that exhibited signaling bias, preferentially increasing β-arrestin recruitment rather than cAMP production. These individuals had significantly lower BMI (p = 2 × 10−42) and up to 50% lower risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and coronary artery disease. Cumulatively, the characterization of BMI-lowering variants in MC4R demonstrates the pivotal role of β-arrestin-mediated MC4R signaling in human energy homeostasis. These findings have relevance for the development of β-arrestin-biased MC4R agonists for weight loss and for the treatment of obesity-associated metabolic disease. We studied 61 independent nonsynonymous variants in MC4R (pairwise R2 < 0.01; variant allele frequency 2%–0.0001%) that were directly genotyped (n = 59) or well imputed (info score > 0.8; n = 2) in 452,300 European ancestry participants from UK Biobank (Table S1; STAR Methods), which is a UK population-based cohort of people aged 40–69 years (Bycroft et al., 2018Bycroft C.

Of the 61 MC4R variants, 12 were nonsense/frameshift variants and 49 were missense variants (Table S1). To characterize the functional consequences of all missense variants in MC4R (Figure 1; Table S2), HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with constructs encoding wild-type (WT) or mutant MC4Rs. We measured canonical Gαs-mediated signaling by quantifying the maximal efficacy of ligand (NDP-αMSH)-induced cAMP production in a time-resolved assay (Figure 1A). Additionally, we quantified the interaction between WT/mutant MC4R and β-arrestin-2 using a time-resolved enzyme complementation assay (Figure 1B). We found that 58 of 61 (95%) nonsynonymous MC4R variants had functional consequences; 47 (77%) resulted in a loss of function (LoF), 9 (15%) resulted in a significant GoF, 2 (3%) had opposing effects on the two signaling pathways, and 3 (5%) were wild-type like in both assays (Figures 1A–1D; Table S2). In contrast to most previous studies of human MC4R variants, which have measured the direct/indirect accumulation of cAMP, we find that the majority of MC4R variants present in UK Biobank affect both cAMP production and the recruitment of β-arrestin-2 to MC4R. We next performed genetic association studies with a series of primary phenotypes recorded in UK Biobank: BMI and obesity, hemodynamic phenotypes known to be affected by MC4R signaling (resting heart rate, systolic and diastolic BP), and risk of type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease. We found that LoF variants in MC4R were associated with higher BMI and higher odds of obesity, severe obesity, type 2 diabetes, and coronary artery disease (Figure 1E). These results align with reports of LoF MC4R variants identified in cohorts of obese and severely obese individuals (Farooqi et al., 2003Farooqi I.S. Keogh J.M. Yeo G.S. Lank E.J. Cheetham T.

In contrast, we found that GoF MC4R variants were strongly associated with lower BMI (p = 2 × 10−47) and lower odds of obesity (p = 3 × 10−38), severe obesity (p = 1 × 10−09), type 2 diabetes (p = 4 × 10−06), and coronary artery disease (p = 0.02) (Figure 1E). GoF variants, but not LoF variants, were associated with lower diastolic BP and lower resting heart rate (Table S3). Associations with BMI were robust in sensitivity analyses that excluded ultra-rare genetic variants (variant allele frequency < 0.001%) and factored in manually curated cluster-plot quality scores (Table S4; STAR Methods). The association of LoF variants with BMI was particularly strong for variants resulting in protein truncation or complete LoF of either pathway in vitro (Table S4). For six overlapping nonsynonymous variants, associations with BMI were consistent with external validation data from the GIANT consortium (Locke et al., 2015Locke A.E. Kahali B. Berndt S.I.

The association of LoF alleles in MC4R with type 2 diabetes was validated using exome sequencing data from the T2D Knowledge Portal; odds ratio (OR) for carriers of rare LoF variants versus noncarriers, 1.59; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.22–2.08; p = 0.0007; Pheterogeneity compared to the estimate in UK Biobank from this study = 0.21. We next used random-effects meta-regression to investigate whether β-arrestin recruitment or cAMP production explained the variance in the association of different MC4R variants with BMI (Figure 2; STAR Methods). We found that β-arrestin recruitment was a statistically significant predictor of the association of different MC4R variants with BMI (p = 3 × 10−05) and explained 88% of the variance in these associations (Figure 2). Several different sensitivity analyses supported the robustness of this association, including multivariable models with cAMP production as an additional predictor, leave-one-out analyses excluding one of the variants in each iteration, models restricted to rare variants (variant allele frequency < 0.5%—i.e., excluding the two variants with the largest weight in the main analysis), models including nonsense/frameshift variants, and models excluding ultra-rare genetic variants and factoring in manually curated cluster-plot quality scores (Table S5; STAR Methods). In contrast, cAMP production did not predict the associations of different MC4R variants with BMI either on its own (p = 0.19) or when the degree of β-arrestin recruitment was also included in the model (p = 0.52; Table S5). Increased β-arrestin recruitment also predicted lower estimates of association with BMI among the 20 variants that were WT-like for cAMP production (p = 0.02; Table S5). Increased β-arrestin recruitment remained a predictor of BMI associations when using the functional category (LoF, WT-like, or GoF) rather than the actual experimental value as predictor (p = 0.04; Table S5); there was evidence that both LoF and GoF variants contributed to this association (Table S5). Taken together, these results suggest that β-arrestin-mediated MC4R signaling plays a critical role in the regulation of human body weight. We hypothesized that naturally occurring genetic variants that preferentially affect signaling through one pathway versus the other (exhibit bias) may provide insights into the physiological consequences of targeting a specific pathway therapeutically. Among 11 variants resulting in a GoF (including two that were GoF for cAMP but LoF for β-arrestin), five (T11S, T101N, F201L, G231S, R236C) exhibited significant bias toward cAMP production, four (V103I, I251L, I289L, I317V) exhibited significant bias toward β-arrestin recruitment, and two (L304F, Y332C) showed no evidence of biased signaling (Figure 3A). GoF MC4R mutants that led to increased β-arrestin recruitment (but not those that predominantly increased cAMP production) resulted in enhanced signaling via the MAPK pathway measured by quantifying ERK1/2 phosphorylation assayed using western blotting (Figures 3B–3D). In UK Biobank, approximately 1 in every 16 participants (6.1%; n = 27,750) carried one copy of a β-arrestin-biased GoF allele, while 1 in every 1,102 (0.1%; n = 411) carried two alleles. Carriers of one GoF allele had a BMI that was on average 0.39 kg/m2 lower than noncarriers (p = 2 × 10−42; Figure 3E), while carriers of two alleles had a BMI that was 0.88 kg/m2 lower (p = 7x10−05; Figure 3E). The latter is equivalent to ∼2.5 kg lower body weight for a person 1.7 m tall. Carriers of two β-arrestin-biased GoF alleles had an approximately 50% lower risk of obesity (OR, 0.51; p = 8 × 10−06; Figure 3E), type 2 diabetes (OR, 0.52; p = 0.03; Figure 3E), and coronary artery disease (OR, 0.50; p = 0.02; Figure 3E) compared to noncarriers; carriers of one allele had intermediate risk (Figure 3E). Conversely, carriers of GoF variants exhibiting bias toward cAMP production had similar BMIs, and risks of obesity and cardio-metabolic disease as noncarriers; these variants were associated with a significant increase in systolic and a marginal (but nonsignificant) increase in diastolic BP compared to noncarriers (Tables S3 and S6). Associations of β-arrestin-biased GoF alleles in MC4R with cardio-metabolic outcomes were directionally consistent with those observed with a 97-variant polygenic score for lower BMI derived from a previous genome-wide study (Locke et al., 2015Locke A.E.

For coronary artery disease, the OR (95% CI) per kg/m2 genetically lower BMI, was 0.94 (0.93–0.95) for the 97-variant polygenic score versus 0.82 (0.72–0.95) for the β-arrestin-biased MC4R GoF variants, P heterogeneity = 0.07. Interestingly, MC4R GoF variants were more strongly associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes (OR [95% CI] per kg/m2 genetically lower BMI, 0.86 [0.85–0.87] for the 97-variant polygenic score versus 0.72 [0.62–0.83] for the β-arrestin-biased MC4R GoF variants, P heterogeneity = 0.01). Experimental studies in rodents and humans have shown that impaired MC4R signaling increases insulin secretion (Fan et al., 2000Fan W. Dinulescu D.M. Butler A.A. Zhou J. Marks D.L. Cone R.D.

https://openalex.org/W2938447226,"The conventional view posits that E3 ligases function primarily through conjugating ubiquitin (Ub) to their substrate molecules. We report here that RIPLET, an essential E3 ligase in antiviral immunity, promotes the antiviral signaling activity of the viral RNA receptor RIG-I through both Ub-dependent and -independent manners. RIPLET uses its dimeric structure and a bivalent binding mode to preferentially recognize and ubiquitinate RIG-I pre-oligomerized on dsRNA. In addition, RIPLET can cross-bridge RIG-I filaments on longer dsRNAs, inducing aggregate-like RIG-I assemblies. The consequent receptor clustering synergizes with the Ub-dependent mechanism to amplify RIG-I-mediated antiviral signaling in an RNA-length dependent manner. These observations show the unexpected role of an E3 ligase as a co-receptor that directly participates in receptor oligomerization and ligand discrimination. It also highlights a previously unrecognized mechanism by which the innate immune system measures foreign nucleic acid length, a common criterion for self versus non-self nucleic acid discrimination."
https://openalex.org/W2936600357,"AMPA- and NMDA-type glutamate receptors mediate distinct postsynaptic signals that differ characteristically among synapses. How postsynaptic AMPA- and NMDA-receptor levels are regulated, however, remains unclear. Using newly generated conditional knockin mice that enable genetic control of neurexin alternative splicing, we show that in hippocampal synapses, alternative splicing of presynaptic neurexin-1 at splice site 4 (SS4) dramatically enhanced postsynaptic NMDA-receptor-mediated, but not AMPA-receptor-mediated, synaptic responses without altering synapse density. In contrast, alternative splicing of neurexin-3 at SS4 suppressed AMPA-receptor-mediated, but not NMDA-receptor-mediated, synaptic responses, while alternative splicing of neurexin-2 at SS4 had no effect on NMDA- or AMPA-receptor-mediated responses. Presynaptic overexpression of the neurexin-1β and neurexin-3β SS4+ splice variants, but not of their SS4- splice variants, replicated the respective SS4+ knockin phenotypes. Thus, different neurexins perform distinct nonoverlapping functions at hippocampal synapses that are independently regulated by alternative splicing. These functions transsynaptically control NMDA and AMPA receptors, thereby mediating presynaptic control of postsynaptic responses."
https://openalex.org/W2938145061,"The proteasome mediates selective protein degradation and is dynamically regulated in response to proteotoxic challenges. SKN-1A/Nrf1, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated transcription factor that undergoes N-linked glycosylation, serves as a sensor of proteasome dysfunction and triggers compensatory upregulation of proteasome subunit genes. Here, we show that the PNG-1/NGLY1 peptide:N-glycanase edits the sequence of SKN-1A protein by converting particular N-glycosylated asparagine residues to aspartic acid. Genetically introducing aspartates at these N-glycosylation sites bypasses the requirement for PNG-1/NGLY1, showing that protein sequence editing rather than deglycosylation is key to SKN-1A function. This pathway is required to maintain sufficient proteasome expression and activity, and SKN-1A hyperactivation confers resistance to the proteotoxicity of human amyloid beta peptide. Deglycosylation-dependent protein sequence editing explains how ER-associated and cytosolic isoforms of SKN-1 perform distinct cytoprotective functions corresponding to those of mammalian Nrf1 and Nrf2. Thus, we uncover an unexpected mechanism by which N-linked glycosylation regulates protein function and proteostasis."

As a consequence of congestive schedule, controlling the training load (TL) and thus the level of effort and fatigue of players to reach higher performances during the matches is therefore critical. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to provide the first report of seasonal internal and external training load that included Hooper Index (HI) scores in elite soccer players during an in-season period. Nineteen elite soccer players were sampled, using global position system to collect total distance, high-speed distance (HSD) and average speed (AvS). It was also collected session rating of perceived exertion (s-RPE) and HI scores during the daily training sessions throughout the 2015-2016 in-season period. Data were analysed across ten mesocycles (M: 1 to 10) and collected according to the number of days prior to a one-match week. Total daily distance covered was higher at the start (M1 and M3) compared to the final mesocycle (M10) of the season. M1 (5589m) reached a greater distance than M5 (4473m) (ES = 9.33 [12.70, 5.95]) and M10 (4545m) (ES = 9.84 [13.39, 6.29]). M3 (5691m) reached a greater distance than M5 (ES = 9.07 [12.36, 5.78]), M7 (ES = 6.13 [8.48, 3.79]) and M10 (ES = 9.37 [12.76, 5.98]). High-speed running distance was greater in M1 (227m), than M5 (92m) (ES = 27.95 [37.68, 18.22]) and M10 (138m) (ES = 8.46 [11.55, 5.37]). Interestingly, the s-RPE response was higher in M1 (331au) in comparison to the last mesocycle (M10, 239au). HI showed minor variations across mesocycles and in days prior to the match. Every day prior to a match, all internal and external TL variables expressed significant lower values to other days prior to a match (p<0.01). In general, there were no differences between player positions. Conclusions: Our results reveal that despite the existence of some significant differences between mesocycles, there were minor changes across the in-season period for the internal and external TL variables used. Furthermore, it was observed that MD-1 presented a reduction of external TL (regardless of mesocycle) while internal TL variables did not have the same record during in-season match-day-minus."
https://openalex.org/W2936875025,"Stem cell heterogeneity is recognized as functionally relevant for tissue homeostasis and repair. The identity, context dependence, and regulation of skeletal muscle satellite cell (SC) subsets remains poorly understood. We identify a minor subset of Pax7+ SCs that is indelibly marked by an inducible Mx1-Cre transgene in vivo, is enriched for Pax3 expression, and has reduced ROS (reactive oxygen species) levels. Mx1+ SCs possess potent stem cell activity upon transplantation but minimally contribute to endogenous muscle repair, due to their relative low abundance. In contrast, a dramatic clonal expansion of Mx1+ SCs allows extensive contribution to muscle repair and niche repopulation upon selective pressure of radiation stress, consistent with reserve stem cell (RSC) properties. Loss of Pax3 in RSCs increased ROS content and diminished survival and stress tolerance. These observations demonstrate that the Pax7+ SC pool contains a discrete population of radiotolerant RSCs that undergo clonal expansion under severe stress."

While all MuSCs express the transcription factor PAX7, we show that a subset also express PAX3 and exhibit resistance to environmental stress. Upon systemic TCDD treatment, PAX3-negative MuSCs display impaired survival, atypical activation, and sporadic differentiation through xenobiotic aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling. We further show that PAX3-positive MuSCs become sensitized to environmental stress when PAX3 function is impaired and that PAX3-mediated induction of mTORC1 is required for protection. Our study, therefore, identifies a functional heterogeneity of MuSCs in response to environmental stress controlled by PAX3."
https://openalex.org/W2939845078,"In contrast to temporal coding by synaptically acting neurotransmitters such as glutamate, neuromodulators such as monoamines signal changes in firing rate. The two modes of signaling have been thought to reflect differences in release by different cells. We now find that midbrain dopamine neurons release glutamate and dopamine with different properties that reflect storage in different synaptic vesicles. The vesicles differ in release probability, coupling to presynaptic Ca2+ channels and frequency dependence. Although previous work has attributed variation in these properties to differences in location or cytoskeletal association of synaptic vesicles, the release of different transmitters shows that intrinsic differences in vesicle identity drive different modes of release. Indeed, dopamine but not glutamate vesicles depend on the adaptor protein AP-3, revealing an unrecognized linkage between the pathway of synaptic vesicle recycling and the properties of exocytosis. Storage of the two transmitters in different vesicles enables the transmission of distinct signals."

This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempt among adolescent students and identify the factors associated with them.Total of 6,531 students of grade 7 to 11 from 74 schools representing all three ecological belts and five development regions participated in this cross sectional study. To select the representative sample from study population, two stage cluster sampling method was used. Standardized self-administered questionnaire were completed by participants. Multivariable logistic regression was done to identify the factors associated with suicidal ideation and attempt.Nearly 13.59% of the participants had considered suicide while 10.33% had attempted it. Food insecurity (OR = 2.32, CI = 1.62-3.32), anxiety (OR = 2.54, CI = 1.49-4.30), loneliness (OR = 2.51, CI = 1.44-4.36) and gender (OR = 1.39, CI = 1.03-1.89) were identified as risk factors of suicidal ideation. Anxiety (OR = 3.02, CI = 1.18-7.74), loneliness (OR = 2.19, CI = 1.28-3.73) truancy (OR = 1.99, CI = 1.40-2.82), cigarette use (OR = 3.13, CI = 1.36-7.23) and gender (OR = 1.60, CI = 1.07-2.39) were identified as risk factors of suicidal attempt. Having 3 or more close friends was found to have protective effect (OR = 0.35, CI = 0.16-0.75) against suicidal attempt.Study reveals relatively high prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicidal attempt among school-going adolescents in Nepal. Appropriate coping strategies for factors like anxiety, loneliness seem could be useful for preventing both suicidal ideation and attempt."
https://openalex.org/W2953223133,"DNA methylation age (DNAm age) has become a widely utilized epigenetic biomarker for the aging process. The Horvath method for determining DNAm age is perhaps the most widely utilized and validated DNA methylation age assessment measure. Horvath DNAm age is calculated based on methylation measurements at 353 loci, present on Illumina’s 450k and 27k DNA methylation microarrays. With increasing use of the more recently developed Illumina MethylationEPIC (850k) microarray, it is worth revisiting this aging measure to evaluate estimation differences due to array design. Of the requisite 353 loci, 17 are missing from the 850k microarray. Similarly, an alternate, 71 loci DNA methylation age assessment measure created by Hannum et al. is missing 6 requisite loci. Using 17 datasets with 27k, 450k, and/or 850k methylation data, we compared each sample’s epigenetic age estimated from all 353 loci required by the Horvath DNAm age calculator, and using only the 336 loci available on the 850k array. In 450k/27k data, removing loci not on the 850k array resulted in underestimation of Horvath’s DNAm age. Underestimation of Horvath DNAm age increased from ages 0 to ~20, remaining stable thereafter (mean deviation = -3.46 y, SD = 1.13 for individuals ≥20 years). Underestimation of Horvath’s DNAm age by the reduced 450k/27k data was similar to the underestimation observed in the 850k data indicating it is driven by missing probes. In analogous examination of Hannum’s DNAm age, the magnitude and direction of epigenetic age misestimation varied with chronological age. In conclusion, inter-array deviations in DNAm age estimations may be largely driven by missing probes between arrays, despite default probe imputation procedures. Though correlations and associations based on Horvath’s DNAm age may be unaffected, researchers should exercise caution when interpreting results based on absolute differences in DNAm age or when mixing samples assayed on different arrays."
https://openalex.org/W2952700770,"The neutrophil enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a major enzyme made by neutrophils to generate antimicrobial and immunomodulatory compounds, notably hypochlorous acid (HOCl), amplifying their capacity for destroying pathogens and regulating inflammation. Despite its roles in innate immunity, the importance of MPO in preventing infection is unclear, as individuals with MPO deficiency are asymptomatic with the exception of an increased risk of candidiasis. Dysregulation of MPO activity is also linked with inflammatory conditions such as atherosclerosis, emphasising a need to understand the roles of the enzyme in greater detail. Consequently, new tools for investigating granular dynamics in vivo can provide useful insights into how MPO localises within neutrophils, aiding understanding of its role in preventing and exacerbating disease. The zebrafish is a powerful model for investigating the immune system in vivo, as it is genetically tractable, and optically transparent. To visualise MPO activity within zebrafish neutrophils, we created a genetic construct that expresses human MPO as a fusion protein with a C-terminal fluorescent tag, driven by the neutrophil-specific promoter lyz. After introducing the construct into the zebrafish genome by Tol2 transgenesis, we established the Tg(lyz:Hsa.MPO-mEmerald,cmlc2:EGFP)sh496 line, and confirmed transgene expression in zebrafish neutrophils. We observed localisation of MPO-mEmerald within a subcellular location resembling neutrophil granules, mirroring MPO in human neutrophils. In Spotless (mpxNL144) larvae—which express a non-functional zebrafish myeloperoxidase—the MPO-mEmerald transgene does not disrupt neutrophil migration to sites of infection or inflammation, suggesting that it is a suitable line for the study of neutrophil granule function. We present a new transgenic line that can be used to investigate neutrophil granule dynamics in vivo without disrupting neutrophil behaviour, with potential applications in studying processing and maturation of MPO during development."

PET MC is presented for two of these scans using a customized version of the Multiple Acquisition Frame method. Prospective MC of MRI acquisition of two healthy subjects is demonstrated using a motion-aware MRI sequence. Real-time motion estimates are accompanied with a tracking validity parameter to improve tracking reliability.For both modalities, MC shows that motion induced artifacts are noticeably reduced and that motion estimates are sufficiently accurate to capture motion ranging from small respiratory motion to large intentional motion. In the PET/MRI study, a time-activity curve analysis shows image improvements for a patient performing head movements corresponding to a tumor motion of ±5-10 mm with a 19% maximal difference in standardized uptake value before and after MC.The first markerless motion tracker is successfully demonstrated for prospective MC in MRI and MC in PET with good tracking validity.As simultaneous PET/MRI systems have become available for clinical use, an increasing demand for accurate motion tracking and MC in PET/MRI scans has emerged.

https://openalex.org/W2936915796,"With biodiversity facing unparalleled threats from anthropogenic disturbance, knowledge on the occurrences of species and communities provides for an effective and fast approach to assess their status and vulnerability. Disturbance is most prominent at the landscape-level, for example through habitat loss from large-scale resource extraction or agriculture. However, addressing species responses to habitat changes at the landscape-scale can be difficult and cost-ineffective, hence studies are mostly conducted at single areas or habitat patches. Moreover, there is a relative lack of studies on communities, as opposed to focal species, despite the former may carry more comprehensive information. Here, we used a multi-region, multi-species hierarchical occupancy model to study a meta-community of mammals detected by camera traps across five distinct areas within a heterogeneous landscape in Tanzania, and aimed to assess responses to human disturbance and environmental variables. Estimated species richness did not vary significantly across different areas, even though these held broadly different habitats. Moreover, we found remarkable consistency in the positive effect of distance to human settlements, a proxy for anthropogenic disturbance, on community occupancy. The positive effect of body size and the positive effect of proximity to rivers on community occupancy were also shared by communities. Results yield conservation relevance because: (1) the among-communities consistency in responses to anthropogenic disturbance, despite the heterogeneity in sampled habitats, indicates that conservation plans designed at the landscape-scale may represent a comprehensive and cost-efficient approach; (2) the consistency in responses to environmental factors suggests that multi-species models are a powerful method to study ecological patterns at the landscape-level."

EETs have pleiotropic effects, including anti-inflammatory activity. Using a Connectivity Map (CMAP) approach, we identified an inverse-correlation between an exemplar EPHX2 inhibitor (EPHX2i) compound response and an inflammatory bowel disease patient-derived signature. To validate the gene-disease link, we tested a pre-clinical tool EPHX2i (GSK1910364) in a mouse disease model, where it showed improved outcomes comparable to or better than the positive control Cyclosporin A. Up-regulation of cytoprotective genes and down-regulation of proinflammatory cytokine production were observed in colon samples obtained from EPHX2i-treated mice. Follow-up immunohistochemistry analysis verified the presence of EPHX2 protein in infiltrated immune cells from Crohn's patient tissue biopsies. We further demonstrated that GSK2256294, a clinical EPHX2i, reduced the production of IL2, IL12p70, IL10 and TNFα in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease patient-derived explant cultures. Interestingly, GSK2256294 reduced IL4 and IFNγ in ulcerative colitis, and IL1β in Crohn's disease specifically, suggesting potential differential effects of GSK2256294 in these two diseases.

The Sec61 translocon (SEC61) serves as the receptor for ribosomes that translate secretory/integral membrane protein-encoding mRNAs, but whether SEC61 also serves as a translation site for cytosolic protein-encoding mRNAs remains unknown. Here, using a BioID proximity-labeling approach in HEK293T Flp-In cell lines, we examined interactions between ER-resident proteins and ribosomes in vivo. Using in vitro analyses, we further focused on bona fide ribosome interactors (i.e. SEC61) and ER proteins (ribophorin I, leucine-rich repeat–containing 59 (LRRC59), and SEC62) previously implicated in associating with ribosomes. We observed labeling of ER-bound ribosomes with the SEC61β and LRRC59 BioID reporters, comparatively modest labeling with the ribophorin I reporter, and no labeling with the SEC62 reporter. A biotin pulse-chase/subcellular fractionation approach to examine ribosome exchange at the SEC61β and LRRC59 sites revealed that, at steady state, ribosomes at these sites comprise both rapid- and slow-exchanging pools. Global translational initiation arrest elicited by the inhibitor harringtonine accelerated SEC61β reporter-labeled ribosome exchange. RNA-Seq analyses of the mRNAs associated with SEC61β- and LRRC59-labeled ribosomes revealed both site-enriched and shared mRNAs and further established that the ER has a transcriptome-wide role in regulating proteome composition. These results provide evidence that ribosomes interact with the ER membrane via multiple modes and suggest regulatory mechanisms that control global proteome composition via ER membrane-bound ribosomes.

Although these candidate ribosome receptors display high binding affinity to ribosomes in vitro, little is known regarding the potential diversity of ribosome–ER protein interactions in vivo and how a multiplicity of ribosome receptors might contribute to mRNA transcriptome localization and translation on the ER. That ribosomes may associate with the ER via Sec61 translocon-independent interactions raises additional questions regarding ribosome exchange on the ER (33Hsu J.C.-C. Nicchitta C.V. Proteome expression: the subcellular organisation of protein synthesis.eLS. 2018; 10.1002/9780470015902.a000571810.1002/9780470015902.a0005718Crossref Google Scholar, 34Potter M.D. Seiser R.M.

In current views, ribosome exchange is translation-dependent; cytosolic ribosomes initiate the translation of secretory/membrane protein-encoding mRNAs and then undergo SRP-dependent trafficking to the ER, with ribosome release back to the cytosol occurring upon termination (35Lingappa V.R. Blobel G. Early events in the biosynthesis of secretory and membrane proteins: the signal hypothesis.Recent Prog. Horm.

In the case of ER-bound ribosomes translating cytosolic mRNAs, additional mechanisms of ribosome localization and exchange on the ER need to be considered. For example, ribosomes may undergo cytosol–ER exchange independently of translation. Advancing the understanding of this phenomenon is necessary to elucidate how cells partition ribosomes between the cytosol and ER and how that process is regulated. Here, we utilized BioID proximity labeling to investigate ribosome-proximal localization of four proposed ER ribosome receptors (ribophorin I, Sec61β, LRRC59, and Sec62) and to monitor ER–cytosol exchange of BioID-tagged ribosomes. BioID utilizes a mutant bacterial biotin ligase (BirA*) that releases a soluble amine-reactive biotin intermediate (biotin-AMP) from the active site, covalently tagging near-neighbor proteins and providing in vivo spatial information (38Roux K.J. Kim D.I. Raida M. Burke B. A promiscuous biotin ligase fusion protein identifies proximal and interacting proteins in mammalian cells.J. Cell Biol. 2012; 196 (22412018): 801-81010.1083/jcb.201112098Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar). Of the four candidate ribosome receptors examined, two (Sec61β and LRRC59) labeled ER ribosomes. Intriguingly, the ribosomal protein-labeling patterns of the two reporters were distinct, consistent with distinct ribosome interaction sites for the two proteins. RNA-Seq analysis of mRNAs from the different ribosome populations revealed both highly enriched and shared transcripts. Taken together, these data are consistent with a higher-order spatial organization of translation on the ER and suggest mechanisms whereby the ER could serve a broad role in proteome expression. Recent reports identify a mRNA transcriptome-wide function for ER-associated ribosomes in proteome expression (15Reid D.W. Nicchitta C.V.

The four BirA* chimeras thus include well-studied complexes (e.g. Sec61 translocon (Sec61β) and OST (ribophorin I)) and proteins implicated in ribosome association but lacking an established function in mammalian cells (i.e. LRRC59 and Sec62). To assess the subcellular localization and proximity labeling activity of the ribosome interactor–BioID chimera introduced above, reporter cell lines were induced with doxycycline for 16 h with 50 μm biotin supplementation, and expression patterns were determined by immunofluorescence microscopy using antisera directed against BirA*. Biotin-labeling patterns were examined by staining with a streptavidin–AF647 conjugate (Fig. 1A). A cell line containing the cloning vector backbone served as a negative control (empty vector). As depicted in Fig. 1A, all reporter cell lines displayed perinuclear reticular staining with the BirA antisera, consistent with an ER localization for all BioID chimeras. Streptavidin staining of proximal biotin-labeled targets mirrored the BirA*-staining patterns, suggesting that the primary interactomes are largely confined to the ER (Fig. 1, A and B). These findings were further validated in comparisons of the staining patterns for streptavidin and the resident ER membrane protein TRAPα (Fig. 1B). As with the data depicted in Fig. 1A, we observed extensive overlap of the streptavidin-staining pattern with that of TRAPα and little discernible tagging of cytosolic proteins. The immunofluorescence data depicting reporter expression and biotin labeling (Fig. 1) were further evaluated in cell fractionation studies (Fig. 2). Using a previously validated sequential detergent fractionation protocol (47Jagannathan S. Nwosu C. Nicchitta C.V.

These data are depicted in Fig. 2B and demonstrate that all ER membrane protein reporters were recovered in the membrane fraction (M) and displayed SDS-PAGE mobilities consistent with their predicted molecular weights (Fig. 2A). Consistent with the immunofluorescence data shown in Fig. 1, overnight biotin labeling was highly enriched in the membrane fractions (M) (Fig. 2 (C and D), TRAPα as ER marker), with only modest labeling of cytosolic proteins (C) (Fig. 2 (C and D), β-tubulin as cytosolic marker). Interestingly, the biotin-labeling patterns of the membrane fractions (Fig. 2C) were distinct from one another, indicating that the BioID reporters reside in different protein environments. The relative paucity of biotinylated cytosolic proteins was unexpected, given that the reactive biotin-AMP intermediate diffuses from the BirA* active site to modify solution-accessible lysines (49Choi-Rhee E.

https://openalex.org/W2936315436,"Purpose Oligometastasis is a state in which cancer patients have a limited number of metastatic tumors; patients with oligometastases survive longer than those with polymetastases. Extensive disease (ED)-small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is considered a systemic disease and a poor survival. This study investigated whether the concept of oligometastases is prognostic factor also applicable to patients with ED-SCLC. Methods We performed a retrospective study of 141 consecutive patients with ED-SCLC between 2008 and 2016. The patients were divided into four subgroups: group 1; patients with solitary metastatic site in one organ (n = 31), group 2; patients with 2–5 metastatic sites in one organ (n = 18), group 3; patients with over 6 metastases in one organ (n = 15), and group 4; patients with 2 or more metastatic organs (n = 77). Results It was identified that 49 patients with ED-SCLC had oligometastases (groups 1 + 2) and 92 had polymetastases (groups 3 + 4). The prognoses of patients with ED-SCLC and oligometastases, defined as ≤5 metastases in a single organ, were significantly superior to those of patients with polymetastases [16.0 (95% CI, 11.0–21.0) months vs. 6.9 (95% CI, 6.0–7.8) months; p<0.001]. 43 of 49 patients with ED-SCLC and oligometastases were relapsed after initial chemotherapy, and 38 (88%) experienced local recurrence. Conclusions Patients with ED-SCLC and oligometastases may have improved survival than those with polymetastases. As oligometastatic ED-SCLC tends to recur locally, local therapy combined with systemic chemotherapy may be a treatment option."

Design Pragmatic-open-label randomised controlled trial. Setting Five maternity hospitals Population Pregnant women with PGLBP Method 1:1 randomization to standard care or standard care plus acupuncture (5 sessions by an acupuncturist midwife). Main outcome measure Efficacy: proportion of days with self-assessed pain by numerical rating scale (NRS) ≤ 4/10. Cost effectiveness (societal viewpoint, time horizon: pregnancy): incremental cost per days with NRS ≤ 4/10. Indirect non-healthcare costs included daily compensations for sick leave and productivity loss caused by absenteeism or presenteeism. Results 96 women were allocated to acupuncture and 103 to standard care (total 199). The proportion of days with NRS ≤ 4/10 was greater in the acupuncture group than in the standard care group (61% vs 48%, p = 0.007). The mean Oswestry disability score was lower in the acupuncture group than with standard care alone (33 versus 38, Δ = 5, 95% CI: 0.8 to 9, p = 0.02). Average total costs were higher in the control group (€2947) than in the acupuncture group (€2635, Δ = —€312, 95% CI: -966 to +325), resulting from the higher indirect costs of absenteeism and presenteeism. Acupuncture was a dominant strategy when both healthcare and non-healthcare costs were included. Costs for the health system (employer and out-of-pocket costs excluded) were slightly higher for acupuncture (€1512 versus €1452, Δ = €60, 95% CI: -272 to +470). Conclusion Acupuncture was a dominant strategy when accounting for employer costs. A 100% probability of cost-effectiveness was obtained for a willingness to pay of €100 per days with pain NRS ≤ 4."

This study describes how fish use mangrove forests in an Indo-Pacific mangrove-coral reef seascape. Sampling was conducted using underwater video cameras (UVCs) to describe spatial and temporal variations in fish assemblages across a small-scale (~ 2.5 km2) system, and over the tidal and lunar cycle. UVCs were deployed in the two main component habitats of mangrove forests: at the mangrove forest edge, and inside the forest (5 m from the forest edge), to establish patterns of utilisation of fish across the tidal and lunar cycle. Proximity to coral reefs had a strong influence on the mangrove fish community, as most fish recorded were reef-associated. Juveniles of 12 reef species were observed, including two species classified as vulnerable on the IUCN list, and one endemic species. Fish assemblages on the mangrove edge differed significantly from those inside the forest. Most fish utilised the forest edge, with few species making regular use of in-forest habitats, supporting the contention that most fish species remain on the edge and potentially retreat into the forest for opportunistic feeding, or when threatened by larger predators. Species-specific patterns of utilisation varied across the tidal and lunar cycle. Small differences in depth profiles and substrate across the small-scale system had a significant effect on fish assemblages, highlighting the importance of accounting for spatial heterogeneity in these factors. These data provide important information for managers to implement adequate conservation strategies that include broader interconnected habitat mosaics."
https://openalex.org/W2940969179,"The hydrolysis of β-lactam antibiotics by β-lactamase enzymes is the most prominent antibiotic resistance mechanism for many pathogenic bacteria. Out of this broad class of enzymes, metallo-β-lactamases are of special clinical interest because of their broad substrate specificities. Several in vitro inhibitors for various metallo-β-lactamases have been reported with no clinical efficacy. Previously, we described a 10-nucleotide single stranded DNA aptamer (10-mer) that inhibits Bacillus cereus 5/B/6 metallo-β-lactamase very effectively. Here, we find that the aptamer shows uncompetitive inhibition of Bacillus cereus 5/B/6 metallo-β-lactamase during cefuroxime hydrolysis. To understand the mechanism of inhibition, we report a 2.5 Å resolution X-ray crystal structure and solution-state NMR analysis of the free enzyme. Chemical shift perturbations were observed in the HSQC spectra for several residues upon titrating with increasing concentrations of the 10-mer. In the X-ray crystal structure, these residues are distal to the active site, suggesting an allosteric mechanism for the aptamer inhibition of the enzyme. HADDOCK molecular docking simulations suggest that the 10-mer docks 26 Å from the active site. We then mutated the three lysine residues in the basic binding patch to glutamine and measured the catalytic activity and inhibition by the 10-mer. No significant inhibition of these mutants was observed by the 10-mer as compared to wild type. Interestingly, mutation of Lys50 (Lys78; according to standard MBL numbering system) resulted in reduced enzymatic activity relative to wild type in the absence of inhibitor, further highlighting an allosteric mechanism for inhibition."

The model development is based on established conceptual models from the literature, which are translated into mathematical formulations and solved numerically. The capability of the proposed model is demonstrated through a case study at Ängelholm Beach, Sweden. The model is calibrated and validated against a seven-year long data set on morphological evolution and sediment grain-size samples. Beach and dune evolution is then simulated from 2018 to 2100 for a range of sea level rise scenarios. The model results are promising, and suggest that the model has potential to be used for long-term assessment of climate change impact on beaches and dunes."

The hearts of mutant VCP transgenic mice also exhibit profound defects in cardiomyocyte nuclear morphology with increased nuclear envelope proteins and nuclear lamins. Proteomics revealed overwhelming interactions of endogenous VCP with ribosomal, ribosome-associated, and RNA-binding proteins in the heart, and impairment of cardiac VCP activity resulted in aggregation of large ribosomal subunit proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2940161247,"Spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models have improved the ability to estimate densities of rare and elusive animals. However, SCR models have seldom been validated even as model formulations diversify and expand to incorporate new sampling methods and/or additional sources of information on model parameters. Information on the relationship between encounter probabilities, sources of additional information, and the reliability of density estimates, is rare but crucial to assessing reliability of SCR-based estimates. We used a simulation-based approach that incorporated prior empirical work to assess the accuracy and precision of density estimates from SCR models using spatially unstructured sampling. To assess the consequences of sparse data and potential sources of bias, we simulated data under six scenarios corresponding to three different levels of search effort and two levels of correlation between search effort and animal density. We then estimated density for each scenario using four models that included increasing amounts of information from harvested individuals and telemetry to evaluate the impact of additional sources of information. Model results were sensitive to the quantity of available information: density estimates based on low search effort were biased high and imprecise, whereas estimates based on high search effort were unbiased and precise. A correlation between search effort and animal density resulted in a positive bias in density estimates, though the bias decreased with increasingly informative datasets. Adding information from harvested individuals and telemetered individuals improved density estimates based on low and moderate effort but had negligible impact for datasets resulting from high effort. We demonstrated that density estimates from SCR models using spatially unstructured sampling are reliable when sufficient information is provided. Accurate density estimates can result if empirical-based simulations such as those presented here are used to develop study designs with appropriate amounts of effort and information sources."
https://openalex.org/W2939855379,"Tubule-interstitial injury (TII) is a critical step in the progression of renal disease. It has been proposed that changes in proximal tubule (PT) albumin endocytosis plays an important role in the development of TII. Some reports have shown protective effects of lithium on kidney injury animal models that was correlated to proteinuria. We tested the hypothesis that lithium treatment ameliorates the development of TII due to changes in albumin endocytosis. Two experimental models were used: (1) TII induced by albumin overload in an animal model; (2) LLC-PK1 cells, a PT cell line. Lithium treatment ameliorates TII induced by albumin overload measured by (1) proteinuria; (2) collagen deposition; (3) area of tubule-interstitial space, and (4) macrophage infiltration. Lithium treatment increased mTORC2 activity leading to the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (PKB) at Ser473 and its activation. This mechanism enhanced albumin endocytosis in PT cells, which decreased the proteinuria observed in TII induced by albumin overload. This effect did not involve changes in the expression of megalin, a PT albumin receptor. In addition, activation of this pathway decreased apoptosis in LLC-PK1 cells, a PT cell line, induced by higher albumin concentration, similar to that found in pathophysiologic conditions. Our results indicate that the protective role of lithium treatment on TII induced by albumin overload involves an increase in PT albumin endocytosis due to activation of the mTORC2/PKB pathway. These results open new possibilities in understanding the effects of lithium on the progression of renal disease."

The CoP coordinates during a stance phase for self-paced level walking between adolescent with three different severities of IS (mild IS, moderate IS, and severe IS) and age-matched normal subjects were measured with foot pressure measurement. The average data of three trials were compared among groups with repeated measure analysis of variance. Results showed that the TUG was different between normal and AIS subjects, indicating use of TUG as a marker of functional walking performance in AIS is plausible but studies with larger sample size is needed before using TUG to identify AIS with different scoliosis severity. The results also showed that the CoP displacement, velocity and acceleration during a stance phase was different across groups, and with the most prominent deviations found in the moderate IS group. The medial-lateral shifting of the CoP trajectory at mid-foot regions in all IS groups deviated the most. A tendency of asymmetry in CoP progression pattern between feet in IS groups was also found. The deviation of the spine alignment in frontal plane could change the CoP progression patterns during level walking, suggesting the risk of the locomotors subjecting to abnormal loading during daily walking. Education and conservative interventions might be needed for preservation of medical outcome and prevention of back pain and/or musculoskeletal consequences later in the lives of AIS with and without surgical correction."

That notwithstanding, Liver function test showed significantly elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and total bilirubin [P<0.001 for all comparisons]. Similarly, the Malaria+CHB group had significantly elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6 [P<0.05 for all comparisons]. In women with Malaria+CHB, correlation analysis showed significant negative association of the pro-inflammatory cytokines responses with malaria parasitemia [IL-1β (P<0.001; r = -0.645), IL-6 (P = 0.046; r = -0.394) and IL-12 (P = 0.011; r = -0.49)]. On the other hand, the pro-inflammatory cytokine levels positively correlated with HBV viremia [TNF-α (P = 0.004; r = 0.549), IL-1β (P<0.001; r = 0.920), IL-6 (P<0.001; r = 0.777), IFN-γ (P = 0.002; r = 0.579), IL-2 (P = 0.008; r = 0.512) and IL-12 (P<0.001; r = 0.655)]. Also, for women in the Malaria+CHB group, parasitemia was observed to diminish HBV viremia [P = 0.003, r = -0.489].Put together the findings suggests that Malaria+CHB could exacerbate inflammatory cytokine responses and increase susceptibility to liver injury among pregnant women in endemic settings."
https://openalex.org/W2937814326,"Biomechanical research on tendon tissue evaluating new treatment strategies to frequently occurring clinical problems regarding tendon degeneration or trauma is of expanding scientific interest. In this context, storing tendon tissue deep-frozen is common practice to collect tissue and analyze it under equal conditions. The commonly used freezing medium, phosphate buffered saline, is known to damage cells and extracellular matrix in frozen state. Dimethyl sulfoxide, however, which is used for deep-frozen storage of cells in cell culture preserves cell vitality and reduces damage to the extracellular matrix during freezing. In our study, Achilles tendons of 26 male C57/Bl6 mice were randomized in five groups. Tendons were deep frozen in dimethyl sulfoxide or saline undergoing one or four freeze-thaw-cycles and compared to an unfrozen control group analyzing biomechanical properties, cell viability and collagenous structure. In electron microscopy, collagen fibrils of tendons frozen in saline appeared more irregular in shape, while dimethyl sulfoxide preserved the collagenous structure during freezing. In addition, treatment with dimethyl sulfoxide preserved cell viability visualized with an MTT-Assay, while tendons frozen in saline showed no remaining metabolic activity, indicating total destruction of cells during freezing. The biomechanical results revealed no differences between tendons frozen once in saline or dimethyl sulfoxide. However, tendons frozen four times in saline showed a significantly higher Young’s modulus over all strain rates compared to unfrozen tendons. In conclusion, dimethyl sulfoxide preserves the vitality of tendon resident cells and protects the collagenous superstructure during the freezing process resulting in maintained biomechanical properties of the tendon."
https://openalex.org/W2940343943,"Background The bacterial load of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) is assumed to play a role in transmission and sequelae. We assessed urogenital CT cycle quantification (Cq) values, as an indicator for CT load, of men and women diagnosed by general practitioners (GPs), hospital physicians and the STI clinic. Methods Urogenital CT-positive samples (n = 2,055 vaginal swabs, n = 77 cervical swabs, n = 1,519 urine samples and n = 19 urethral swabs) diagnosed by GPs, hospital physicians and the STI clinic from the Maastricht Medical Microbiology Laboratory were included (2012–2016). The outcome measure ‘urogenital Cq values’ was used as an inversely proportional measure for CT load. Among all patients, multivariate linear regression analyses were used to assess primary determinants for mean urogenital Cq values, stratified by sex. Additional clinical determinants were assessed among STI clinic patients. Results In men, mean urogenital Cq values were similar between GPs, hospital physicians and the STI clinic (32.7 and 33.5 vs. 32.7; p>0.05). Women visiting the GP had lower urogenital Cq values than women visiting the STI clinic (30.2 vs. 30.9; p = <0.001). Women visiting the hospital had higher urogenital Cq values than women visiting the STI clinic (32.4 vs. 30.9; p = <0.001). Among STI clinic women, urogenital Cq values were lower in women with concurrent anorectal CT and in rectally untested women compared to anorectal CT-negative women (30.7 and 30.6 vs. 33.9; p = <0.001). Conclusion Men visiting different STI care providers had similar urogenital Cq values, which could be an indicator for similar CT loads. The lower Cq values of women visiting the GP compared to women visiting the STI clinic could be an indicator for higher CT loads and likely higher transmission potential. Notably, urogenital Cq values of STI clinic women were much lower (>3 Cq) when STI clinic women also had anorectal CT. This finding could indicate higher urogenital CT loads and likely higher chances of transmission and sequelae."

However, little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying the fat deposition after castration. Here, the intramuscular fat (IMF) content of the steer group was shown to be much higher than the bull group. To understand transcriptional changes in the genes involved in fat deposition following castration, differential expression patterns of mRNAs in liver tissue were investigated in steers and bulls using RNA sequencing. In total, we obtained 58,282,367-54,918,002 uniquely mapped reads, which covered 90.13% of the currently annotated transcripts; 5,864 novel transcripts and optimized 9,088 known genes were determined. These results indicated that castration could change the expression patterns of mRNAs in liver tissue, and 282 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected between steers and bulls. KEGG pathway analysis showed that the DEGs were mostly enriched in PPAR signaling pathway, steroid biosynthesis, steroid hormone biosynthesis, and biosynthesis of fatty acids. Furthermore, eight DEGs were corroborated via quantitative real-time PCR and we found that FABP1 gene knockdown in bovine hepatocytes prominently reduced intracellular triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion in culture medium. In summary, these results indicate that FABP1 may promote fat deposition by promoting the production and secretion of TAG and VLDL in steer liver."
https://openalex.org/W2938531062,"Recombinant herpesvirus vaccine vectors offer distinct advantages in next-generation vaccine development, primarily due to the ability to establish persistent infections to provide sustainable antigen responses in the host. Recombinant bovine herpesvirus-4 (BoHV-4) has been previously shown to elicit protective immunity in model laboratory animal species against a variety of pathogens. For the first time, we describe the induction of antigen-specific immune responses to two delivered antigens in the host species after intranasal nebulization of recombinant BoHV-4 expressing the chimeric peptide containing the bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) glycoprotein E2 and the bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) glycoprotein D (BoHV-4-A-CMV-IgK-gE2gD-TM). In this study, four cattle were immunized via intranasal nebulization with the recombinant BoHV-4 construct. Two of the cattle were previously infected with wild-type BoHV-4, and both developed detectable serologic responses to BVDV and BoHV-1. All four immunized cattle developed detectable viral neutralizing antibody responses to BVDV, and one steer developed a transient viral neutralizing response to BoHV-1. Approximately one year after immunization, immunosuppressive doses of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone were administered intravenously to all four cattle. Within two weeks of immunosuppression, all animals developed viral neutralizing antibody responses to BoHV-1, and all animals maintained BVDV viral neutralizing capacity. Overall, nebulization of BoHV-4-A-CMV-IgK-gE2gD-TM persistently infects cattle, is capable of eliciting antigen-specific immunity following immunization, including in the presence of pre-existing BoHV-4 immunity, and recrudescence of the virus boosts the immune response to BoHV-4-vectored antigens. These results indicate that BoHV-4 is a viable and attractive vaccine delivery platform for use in cattle."

Full system automation of 3D microscope scans and custom image analysis routines allows hundreds of individual cells to be automatically segmented and the mRNA-protein content to be digitally counted. Single-molecule intron and mRNA content is measured by single-molecule fluorescence in-situ hybridization (smFISH), while protein content is quantified though the use of antibody probes. To mimic immune response to bacterial infection, human monocytic leukemia cells (THP-1) were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the expression of two inflammatory genes, IL1β (interleukin 1β) and TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor α), were simultaneously quantified by monitoring the intron, mRNA, and protein levels over time. The simultaneous labeling of cellular content allowed for a series of correlations at the single-cell level to be explored, both in the progressive maturation of a single gene (intron-mRNA-protein) and comparative analysis between the two immune response genes. In the absence of LPS stimulation, mRNA expression of IL1β and TNF-α were uncorrelated. Following LPS stimulation, mRNA expression of the two genes became more correlated, consistent with a model in which IL1β and TNF-α upregulation occurs in parallel through independent mechanistic pathways. This smFISH methodology can be applied to different complex biological systems to provide valuable insight into highly dynamic gene mechanisms that determine cell plasticity and heterogeneity of cellular response."
https://openalex.org/W2940398165,"An imbalance in copper (Cu) tissue homeostasis has a degenerative effect on spermatogenesis and male fertility. The high-affinity Cu transporter 1 (CTR1; SLC31A1) is the major protein responsible for Cu acquisition in eukaryotes and is highly expressed in mouse testes. Studies on yeast and Drosophila have demonstrated the conserved essential function of Cu and CTR1 for meiosis and fertility, implying that CTR1 may play an essential function in mammalian spermatogenesis. In mice, spermatogenesis takes place within the seminiferous epithelium, where tight junctions between somatic Sertoli cells (SCs) create a specialized microenvironment for the development of meiotic germ cells (GCs) by tightly regulating the free transport of metabolites and ions to reach these cells. Here, it is demonstrated that within the seminiferous epithelium, CTR1 is expressed on the membrane of primary pachytene spermatocytes and SCs. To examine the physiological significance of CTR1 in spermatogenesis, mice with a GC-specific (Ctr1ΔGC) and SC-specific (Ctr1ΔSC) disruption of the Ctr1 gene were generated. The testis of Ctr1ΔGC mice exhibits a severe progressive loss of GCs starting at postnatal day (PND) 28 leading to testis hypoplasia by adulthood. No spermatogenic recovery was observed in Ctr1ΔGC testis beyond PND 41, despite the presence of FOXO-1 expressing undifferentiated spermatogonial cells. However, Ctr1ΔSC mice displayed functional spermatogenesis and were fertile, even though testicular Cu levels and Cu-dependent cellular activities were significantly reduced. These results reveal, for the first time, the importance of CTR1 expression by GCs for maintaining functional spermatogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2936802575,"Brachytherapy is a well-established treatment of localized prostate cancer. Few studies have documented long-term results, specifically biochemical progression-free survival (bPFS) in men with brachytherapy alone, with or without short-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), or in combination with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). Our aim was to analyze long-term bPFS of brachytherapy treated patients.Retrospective analysis of 1457 patients with low and intermediate risk prostate cancer treated with brachytherapy alone (1255) or combined with EBRT (202). Six-months ADT was administrated for all EBRT combined patients and for prostate volume downsizing when >55 cc (328). Failure was by the Phoenix definition. Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariate Cox regression estimated and compared 10-yr and 15-yr rates of bPFS.Median follow-up was 6.1 yr. Ten and 15-yr bPFS rates of the entire cohort were 93.2% and 89.2%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, PSA density (PSAD), ADT and clinical stage were significantly associated with failure. The most powerful independent factor was PSAD with a HR of 3.5 (95% CI, 1.7-7.4) for PSAD above 0.15. No significant difference was found between low and intermediate risks patients regardless of treatment regimen. However, comparison of two intermediate risk groups, Gleason score (GS) 7, PSA<20 ng/ml versus GS≤6 and PSA = 10-20 ng/ml, revealed 10- and 15-yr bPFS rates of 94.2% and 94.2% compared to 88.2% and 79.9%, (P = 0.022), respectively. ADT improved bPFS rates in low risk patients. The ten and 15-yr bPFS rates were 97.6% and 94.6% compared to 92.3% and 88.2%, (P = 0.020), respectively.Our retrospective large scale study suggests that brachytherapy provides excellent long-term bPFS rates in low and intermediate risk disease. Combination of brachytherapy with EBRT yields favorable outcomes in GS 7 intermediate risk patients and short-term ADT has a positive effect on outcomes in low risk patients. Further prospective studies are warranted to discriminate the role of adding either EBRT and/or ADT to brachytherapy protocols."
https://openalex.org/W2939519423,"Sustaining employees' well-being and high performance at work is a challenge for organizations in today's highly competitive environment. This study examines the dynamic reciprocal relationship between the variability in office workers' eudaimonic well-being (i.e., activity worthwhileness) and their extra-role performance. Eighty-three white-collar employees filled in a diary questionnaire twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon, on four consecutive working days. The results show that eudaimonic well-being displays clear variability in a short time frame. In addition, Bayesian Multilevel Structural Equation Models (MSEMs) reveal a significant positive relationship between the levels of state eudaimonic well-being in the afternoon and the increase in the levels of state extra-role performance from that afternoon to the next morning. Moreover, the overall levels of self-reported state eudaimonic well-being across the diary measurements are significantly and positively related to the overall levels of extra-role performance assessed by the supervisor during the diary measurement. Finally, there is a significant negative relationship between the amount of intra-individual variability in state eudaimonic well-being during the week and the overall levels of self-rated state extra-role performance during the same week. These findings shed light on the dynamic nature of both the eudaimonic component of well-being and performance, highlighting the importance of eudaimonic well-being for extra-role performance and expanding the happy-productive worker thesis. The results suggest that the daily eudaimonic experience of meaning at work should complement the experience of hedonic well-being because it is an important factor in achieving better and more sustainable employee performance on a daily basis."

Dense-core vesicles (DCVs) in neuroendocrine cells are maintained at an acidic pH, which is part of the electrochemical driving force for neurotransmitter loading and is required for hormonal propeptide processing. Genetic loss of CAPS1 (aka calcium-dependent activator protein for secretion, CADPS), a vesicle-bound priming factor required for DCV exocytosis, dissipates the pH gradient across DCV membranes and reduces neurotransmitter loading. However, the basis for CAPS1 binding to DCVs and for its regulation of vesicle pH has not been determined. Here, MS analysis of CAPS1 immunoprecipitates from brain membrane fractions revealed that CAPS1 associates with a rabconnectin3 (Rbcn3) complex comprising Dmx-like 2 (DMXL2) and WD repeat domain 7 (WDR7) proteins. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, we found that Rbcn3α/DMXL2 and Rbcn3β/WDR7 colocalize with CAPS1 on DCVs in human neuroendocrine (BON) cells. The shRNA-mediated knockdown of Rbcn3β/WDR7 redistributed CAPS1 from DCVs to the cytosol, indicating that Rbcn3β/WDR7 is essential for optimal DCV localization of CAPS1. Moreover, cell-free experiments revealed direct binding of CAPS1 to Rbcn3β/WDR7, and cell assays indicated that Rbcn3β/WDR7 recruits soluble CAPS1 to membranes. As anticipated by the reported association of Rbcn3 with V-ATPase, we found that knocking down CAPS1, Rbcn3α, or Rbcn3β in neuroendocrine cells impaired rates of DCV reacidification. These findings reveal a basis for CAPS1 binding to DCVs and for CAPS1 regulation of V-ATPase activity via Rbcn3β/WDR7 interactions.

https://openalex.org/W2939631736,"Prospective memory (PM), the ability to remember an intention in the future, is essential to children's everyday lives. We explored age differences (6- to 7- vs. 10- to 11-year-olds) in PM depending on the nature of the task and the children's motivation. Children performed event-based PM tasks (in which the cue was presented during the ongoing activity) and activity-based PM tasks (in which the cue consisted of finishing the ongoing activity). Additionally, the children were assigned to either a reward condition or a no-reward condition. The results showed better performance in event than in activity based tasks, with older children outperforming younger children in both. There was a marginal effect of reward for PM accuracy. These patterns suggest that the cue detection process and children's motivation play a role in PM performance during development."
https://openalex.org/W2936413622,"Aim Knowledge is scarce regarding mothers’ and fathers’ experiences of being a parent of a child with VACTERL association—a complex malformation. The aim of the study was to describe experiences of being a parent of a child with VACTERL association. Method Semi-structured interviews were performed with ten mothers and nine fathers face-to-face or by telephone and analyzed by using Qualitative content analysis. Results The parents described crisis reactions at the discovery of malformations in their child. Involvement in care was reported from the initial hospital admission until actively taking responsibility for treatments at home. Eventually the health condition became an integrated part of everyday life. The parents expressed the importance of meeting other families with a child with VACTERL. Descriptions were given of more or less professionalism with perceived discrepancies of knowledge and experience between the healthcare professionals in the tertiary hospital and those in the local hospital. Difficulties in receiving medical support during the initial period at home were described. Furthermore, emotional support and practical arrangements regarding parental accommodation and transportation varied. Conclusion Being a parent of a child with VACTERL association involves crisis, mixed emotional reactions and shared responsibility for the child´s treatment and care with the professional care providers. Psychological processing, good medical care and support from experts, and peer support from other parents is essential in the parents’ struggle to reach self-confidence and adaptation. A care plan with individualized tailored care for each child including a training and support plan for the parents is warranted. To reduce the described discrepancies in knowledge and experience between the local and tertiary hospital, video sessions with the parents and responsible professionals at the local and tertiary hospital could be an appropriate mode of transferring information at discharge and follow up of the child."
https://openalex.org/W2936964172,"Background From 2013 to 2017, more than one thousand avian influenza A (H7N9) confirmed cases with hundreds of deaths were reported in mainland China. To identify priorities for epidemic prevention and control, a risk assessing framework for subnational variations is needed to define the epidemic potential of A (H7N9). Methods We established a consolidated two-stage framework that outlined the potential epidemic of H7N9 in humans: The Stage 1, index-case potential, used a Boosted Regression Trees model to assess population at risk due to spillover from poultry; the Stage 2, epidemic potential, synthesized the variables upon a framework of the Index for Risk Management to measure epidemic potential based on the probability of hazards and exposure, the vulnerability and coping capacity. Results Provinces in southern and eastern China, especially Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangzhou, have high index-case potential of human infected with A (H7N9), while northern coastal provinces and municipalities with low morbidity, i.e. Tianjin and Liaoning, have an increasing risk of A (H7N9) infection. Provinces in central China are likely to have high potential of epidemic due to the high vulnerability and the lack of coping capacity. Conclusions This study provides a unified risk assessment of A (H7N9) to detect the two-stage heterogeneity of epidemic potential among different provinces in mainland China, allowing proactively evaluate health preparedness at subnational levels to improve surveillance, diagnostic capabilities, and health promotion."
https://openalex.org/W2937449675,"Introduction Low birth weight (LBW, <2500 g) may predict an increased risk of an adverse cardiometabolic profile later in life, but long-term effects in different populations and birth weight strata are still unclear. We explored laboratory markers of cardiometabolic risk in children born with marginally LBW (2000–2500 g). Methods This was a prospective longitudinal cohort study including 285 Swedish marginally LBW children and 95 normal birth weight (NBW, 2501–4500 g) controls. At 3.5 and 7 years of age, blood samples for glucose, insulin, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), cholesterol, triglycerides, high- and low density lipoprotein (HDL and LDL), apolipoprotein B (ApoB) and apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) were assessed and compared between the groups. Results No significant differences in levels of insulin, HOMA-IR, hs-CRP or blood lipids were observed between marginally LBW and NBW children. At 7 years there was a higher proportion of marginally LBW children with elevated levels of insulin, defined as above the 90th percentile of the control group (21% vs 8.6%, p = 0.038). This association was, however, confounded by maternal ethnicity. In marginally LBW children born small for gestational age (SGA), mean fasting glucose was significantly higher compared to controls (4.7 vs 4.5 mmol/L, p = 0.020). Conclusions There were no significant differences in insulin, insulin resistance, hs-CRP or blood lipids between the marginally LBW children and controls. The subgroup of marginally LBW children born SGA may present early signs of glucose imbalance already at school age."
https://openalex.org/W2938900462,"Health care is believed to be suffered from a ""cost disease,"" in which a heavy reliance on labor limits opportunities for efficiencies stemming from technological improvement. Although recent evidence shows that U.S. hospitals have experienced a positive trend of productivity growth, skilled nursing facilities are relatively ""low-tech"" compared to hospitals, leading some to worry that productivity at skilled nursing facilities will lag behind the rest of the economy.To assess productivity growth among skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) in the treatment of conditions which frequently involve substantial post-acute care after hospital discharge.We constructed an analytic file with the records of Medicare beneficiaries that were discharged from acute-care hospitals to SNFs with stroke, hip fracture, or lower extremity joint replacement (LEJR) between 2006 and 2014. We populated each record for 90 days starting at the time of SNF admission, detailing for each day the treatment site and all associated costs. We used ordinary least square regression to estimate growth in SNF productivity, measured by the ratio of ""high-quality SNF stays"" to total treatment costs. The primary definition of a high-quality stay was a stay that ended with the return of the patient to the community within 90 days after SNF admission. We controlled for patient demographics and comorbidities in the regression analyses.Our sample included 1,076,066 patient stays at 14,394 SNFs with LEJR, 315,546 patient stays at 14,154 SNFs with stroke, and 739,608 patient stays at 14,588 SNFs with hip fracture. SNFs improved their productivity in the treatment of patients with LEJR, stroke, and hip fracture by 1.1%, 2.2%, and 2.0% per year, respectively. That pattern was robust to a number of alternative specifications. Regressions on year dummies showed that the productivity first decreased and then increased, with a lowest point in 2011. Over the study period, quality continued to rise, but dominated by higher costs at first. Costs then started to decrease, driving productivity to grow.There has been substantial productivity growth in recent years among SNFs in the U.S. in the treatment of post-acute-care-intensive conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2936047948,"Introduction The prevalence of HIV infection in South African pregnant women has been approximately 30% over the past decade; however, there has been a steady decline in mother-to-child transmission of HIV from 8% in 2008 to <2% in 2015. We evaluated the immunogenicity of live-attenuated trivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV) following the primary vaccination series (doses at birth, 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age) in HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU), HIV-infected infants initiated on early anti-retroviral treatment (HIV+/ART+), HIV-infected infants on deferred ART (HIV+/ART-) and HIV-unexposed infants (HU) as the referent group. Methods Serum polio neutralization antibody titres were evaluated to serotype-1, serotype-2 and serotype-3 at 6, 10 and 18 weeks of age. Antibody titres ≥8 were considered seropositive and sero-protective. Results At 18 weeks of age, following the complete primary series of four OPV doses, no differences in GMTs, percentage of infants with sero-protective titres and median fold change in antibody titre (18 weeks vs 6 weeks) were observed in HEU infants (n = 114) and HIV+/ART+ infants (n = 162) compared to HU infants (n = 104) for the three polio serotypes. However, comparing HIV+/ART- infants (n = 70) to HU infants at 18 weeks of age, we observed significantly lower GMTs for serotype-1 (p = 0.022), serotype-2 (p<0.001) and serotype-3 (p<0.001), significantly lower percentages of infants with sero-protective titres for the three serotypes (p<0.001), and significantly lower median fold change in antibody titre for serotype-1 (p = 0.048), serotype-2 (p = 0.003) and serotype-3 (p = 0.008). Conclusion Delaying initiation of ART in HIV-infected infants was associated with an attenuated immune response to OPV following a four-dose primary series of vaccines, whereas immune responses to OPV in HIV-infected children initiated on ART early in infancy and HEU children were similar to HU infants."
https://openalex.org/W2936768658,"Selenium plays an important, but vastly neglected role in human nutrition with a narrow gap between dietary deficiency and toxicity. For a potential biofortification of food with Se, as well as for toxicity-risk assessment in sites contaminated by Se, modelling of local and global Se cycling is essential. As bioavailability of Se for rice plants depends on the speciation of Se and the resulting interactions with mineral surfaces as well as the interaction with Se uptake mechanisms in plants, resulting plant Se content is complex to model. Unfortunately, simple experimental models to estimate Se uptake into plants from substrates have been lacking. Therefore, a mass balance of Se transfer between lithosphere (represented by kaolinite), hydrosphere (represented by a controlled nutrient solution), and biosphere (represented by rice plants) has been established. In a controlled, closed, lab-scale system, rice plants were grown hydroponically in nutrient solution supplemented with 0-10 000 μg L-1 Se of either selenate or selenite. Furthermore, in a series of batch experiments, adsorption and desorption were studied for selenate and selenite in competition with each of the major nutrient oxy-anions, nitrate, sulfate and phosphate. In a third step, the hydroponical plants experiments were coupled with sorption experiments to study synergy effects. These data were used to develop a mass balance fitting model of Se uptake and partitioning. Adsorption was well-described by Langmuir isotherms, despite competing anions, however, a certain percentage of Se always remained bio-unavailable to the plant. Uptake of selenate or selenite by transporters into the rice plant was fitted with the non-time differentiated Michaelis-Menten equation. Subsequent sequestration of Se to the shoot was better described using a substrate-inhibited variation of the Michaelis-Menten equation. These fitted parameters were then integrated into a mass balance model of Se transfer."

We utilized UHPLC-MS/MS to determine the profile of full set of ceramides, sphingosine, and sphingosine 1-phosphate in this xenograft mouse model. The tissues isolated and investigated were from brain, lung, heart, liver, spleen, kidney, bladder, tumors and blood. With the exception of equal volume of blood plasma (100ul), all tissues were studied with the same amount of protein (800ug). Results demonstrated that brain contained the highest level of ceramide and kidney had the highest level of sphingosine, whereas sphingosine 1-phosphate and dihydrosphingosine 1-phosphate were heavily presented in the blood. Brain also comprised the highest level of phospholipids. As for the species, several ceramides, usually present in very low amounts in cultured tumor cells, showed relatively high levels in certain tissues. This study highlights levels of bioactive sphingolipids profiles in xenograft mouse model of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and provides resources to investigate potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers that target bioactive sphingolipids metabolism pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2938880615,"Multiple-use public lands require balancing diverse resource uses and values across landscapes. In the California desert, there is strong interest in renewable energy development and important conservation concerns. The Bureau of Land Management recently completed a land-use plan for the area that provides protection for modeled suitable habitat for multiple rare plants. Three sets of habitat models were commissioned for plants of conservation concern as part of the planning effort. The Bureau of Land Management then needed to determine which model or combination of models to use to implement plan requirements. Our goals were to: 1) develop a process for evaluating the existing habitat models and 2) use the evaluation results to map probable and potential suitable habitat. We developed a method for evaluating the construction (input data and methods) and performance of existing models and applied it to 88 habitat models for 43 rare plant species. We also developed a process for mapping probable and potential suitable habitat based on the existing models; potential habitat maps are intended only to guide future field surveys. We were able to map probable suitable habitat for 26 of the 43 species and potential suitable habitat for 41 species. Forty percent of the project area contains probable suitable habitat for at least one species (43,338 km2), with much of that habitat (43%) occurring on lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management. Lands prioritized for renewable energy development contain 3% of the habitat modeled as suitable for at least one species. Our products can be used by agencies to review proposed projects and plan future plant surveys and by developers to target sites likely to minimize conflicts with rare plant conservation goals. Our methods can be broadly applied to understand and quantify the defensibility of models used in conservation and regulatory contexts."
https://openalex.org/W2940950100,"Reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) is the most frequent exogenous virus that contaminates attenuated vaccines. Therefore, it is extremely important to select REV-free specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chicken embryos. Generally, REV infection is assessed by detecting REV antibodies in SPF chickens. This present study seeks to evaluate REV infection by replacing serum antibody detection with yolk antibody detection. A cohort of 40 nineteen-week-old SPF chickens were artificially inoculated with REV, with 32 SPF chickens raised in another isolation environment served as a blank control. Eggs and serum from 23-week-old chickens were sampled, and yolks were diluted separately to ratios of 1:150, 1:200, 1:300 and 1:400, which were detected together with serum. We found that the yolk antibody detection findings at a dilution of 1:300 had the highest coincidence rate compared with that based on serum antibody measurements. At a dilution ratio of 1:300 for yolk antibody, 72 chickens were continuously observed for 10 weeks from 25- to 34-weeks-old. Our findings were based on serum antibody or yolk antibody detection, and the evaluation results were completely consistent. Therefore, all serum antibody-positive chickens were yolk antibody-positive, and vice versa. Accordingly, vaccine producers can estimate REV cleanliness in a poultry farm by sampling yolk antibody titers."
