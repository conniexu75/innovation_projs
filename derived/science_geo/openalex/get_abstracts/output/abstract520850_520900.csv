https://openalex.org/W1966557314,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs), formed by non-sequential back-splicing of pre-mRNA transcripts, are a widespread form of non-coding RNA in animal cells. However, it is unclear whether the majority of circRNAs represent splicing by-products without function or are produced in a regulated manner to carry out specific cellular functions. We show that hundreds of circRNAs are regulated during human epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and find that the production of over one-third of abundant circRNAs is dynamically regulated by the alternative splicing factor, Quaking (QKI), which itself is regulated during EMT. Furthermore, by modulating QKI levels, we show the effect on circRNA abundance is dependent on intronic QKI binding motifs. Critically, the addition of QKI motifs is sufficient to induce de novo circRNA formation from transcripts that are normally linearly spliced. These findings demonstrate circRNAs are both purposefully synthesized and regulated by cell-type specific mechanisms, suggesting they play specific biological roles in EMT."

Although the major pathways in turnover have been identified, accounting for disparate half-lives has been elusive. We show that codon optimality is one feature that contributes greatly to mRNA stability. Genome-wide RNA decay analysis revealed that stable mRNAs are enriched in codons designated optimal, whereas unstable mRNAs contain predominately non-optimal codons. Substitution of optimal codons with synonymous, non-optimal codons results in dramatic mRNA destabilization, whereas the converse substitution significantly increases stability. Further, we demonstrate that codon optimality impacts ribosome translocation, connecting the processes of translation elongation and decay through codon optimality. Finally, we show that optimal codon content accounts for the similar stabilities observed in mRNAs encoding proteins with coordinated physiological function. This work demonstrates that codon optimization exists as a mechanism to finely tune levels of mRNAs and, ultimately, proteins."

RNA polymerase II preferentially associated with the smallest clutches while linker histone H1 and heterochromatin were enriched in the largest ones. Our results reveal how the chromatin fiber is formed at nanoscale level and link chromatin fiber architecture to stem cell state. Eukaryotic nucleosomes are a repeating unit of the chromatin, formed by 146 base pairs (bp) of DNA wrapped around octamers of the four core histone proteins (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) (Luger et al., 1997Luger K. Mäder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Crystal structure of the nucleosome core particle at 2.8 A resolution.Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6912) Google Scholar). The histone H1 binds DNA entry/exit points of nucleosomes and to linker DNA between nucleosomes to compact the chromatin (Woodcock et al., 2006Woodcock C.L. Skoultchi A.I. Fan Y.

According to the “textbook picture,” chromatin compaction follows a hierarchical model where nucleosomes form a “beads-on-string” fiber of 10 nm in diameter, which folds into higher ordered fibers of 30 nm, which in turn compact progressively into larger fibers of 100–200 nm (Finch and Klug, 1976Finch J.T.

The existence of this hierarchical organization inside intact eukaryotic nuclei in vivo has recently been debated after cryo-electron microscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and electron spectroscopic imaging experiments failed to detect the 30-nm fiber (Efroni et al., 2008Efroni S.

Human mitotic chromosomes consist predominantly of irregularly folded nucleosome fibres without a 30-nm chromatin structure.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 1644-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). These studies led to the overall conclusion that the eukaryotic nuclei are mainly composed of 10 nm fibers even though the core histone proteins could not be identified unequivocally using these methods due to their lack of molecular specificity. In addition, genome-wide analyses have revealed that nucleosomes are depleted at promoter and terminator regions and at many enhancers (Struhl and Segal, 2013Struhl K. Segal E. Determinants of nucleosome positioning.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Since the 30-nm fiber arrangement imposes specific constrains on nucleosome occupancy and positioning (Fussner et al., 2011aFussner E. Ching R.W. Bazett-Jones D.P. Living without 30nm chromatin fibers.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2011; 36: 1-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), genome-wide analyses along with the latest imaging results argue against a hierarchical organization of nucleosomes along the chromatin fiber. However, due to the limitations of previous approaches, which either lack molecular specificity or are based on population studies, histones have not been specifically visualized in intact nuclei and thus the organization of nucleosomes along the chromatin fiber has not been resolved so far. Here, we used super-resolution nanoscopy (stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy [STORM]) (Rust et al., 2006Rust M.J. Bates M. Zhuang X. Sub-diffraction-limit imaging by stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM).Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 793-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (5665) Google Scholar) to visualize the structure of the chromatin fiber of a large variety of different cells at single cell level with a resolution of ∼20 nm by imaging the core histone protein H2B. Super-resolution has previously been used to visualize chromatin in interphase (Bohn et al., 2010Bohn M. Diesinger P. Kaufmann R. Weiland Y. Müller P. Gunkel M. von Ketteler A. Lemmer P. Hausmann M.

Sauer M. Live-cell super-resolution imaging with trimethoprim conjugates.Nat. Methods. 2010; 7: 717-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and in dividing nuclei (Matsuda et al., 2010Matsuda A. Shao L. Boulanger J. Kervrann C. Carlton P.M. Kner P. Agard D. Sedat J.W. Condensed mitotic chromosome structure at nanometer resolution using PALM and EGFP- histones.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e12768Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Up to date, however, super-resolution studies of chromatin have not addressed questions regarding the organization of single or groups of nucleosomes, the overall nucleosome occupancy level of DNA and whether these parameters are consistent with the 30-nm fiber. Moreover, how the chromatin organization changes at the nanoscale level as a function of cell state such as pluripotent or differentiated state, while of fundamental significance for DNA accessibility and gene expression, has not yet been addressed. Overall, a quantitative approach that can estimate the number of nucleosomes within the chromatin fiber and thus identify nucleosome spatial arrangement has been lacking. Our observations indicate that nucleosomes are grouped in discrete domains along the chromatin fiber, which we termed “nucleosome clutches” in analogy with “egg clutches.” Clutches are interspersed with nucleosome-depleted regions and the number of nucleosomes per clutch is very heterogeneous in a given nucleus arguing against the existence of a well-organized and ordered fiber. These observations were validated by computer simulations, which were also used to estimate the nucleosome occupancy of the chromatin fiber. Two-color STORM showed increased levels of H1 in larger and denser clutches containing more nucleosomes, which formed the “closed” heterochromatin. On the other hand, “open” chromatin was formed by smaller and less dense clutches which associated with RNA Polymerase II. Strikingly, despite the heterogeneity in clutch size in a given nucleus, on average differentiated cells contained larger and denser clutches compared to stem cells. These results reveal the nanoscale architecture of the chromatin fiber by showing how nucleosomes are arrayed in intact interphase nuclei. To reveal the organization of chromatin at nanoscale resolution, we recorded STORM images of the core histone protein H2B in interphase human fibroblast nuclei (hFb) since H2B is one of the histones with fewer tail modifications and functional variants with known function (Kamakaka and Biggins, 2005Kamakaka R.T. Biggins S. Histone variants: deviants?.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 295-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). STORM images revealed a striking organization of H2B inside the nucleus (Figure 1A, left), which was not evident with conventional fluorescence microscopy (Figure S1A). H2B appeared clustered in discrete and spatially separated nanodomains (Figure 1A, left zooms). The H2B nanodomain density (number of nanodomains per unit area) was ∼25% higher in the nuclear periphery, where the heterochromatin is thought to be located, compared to the nuclear interior. Since H2B is a core histone of the nucleosome octamer, its localization should reflect the arrangement of nucleosomes within the chromatin fiber. Accordingly, another core histone protein of the nucleosome octamer, H3, was similarly clustered in discrete nanodomains (Figure S1B). Furthermore, as expected, ∼85% of H3 co-localized with H2B (Figure S1C).Figure S1Super-Resolution Imaging of Different Core Histone Proteins under Various Fixation and Labeling Conditions, of Living Cells and of H3 Acetylation, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Comparison of super-resolution (STORM) image of H2B (upper portion) to conventional fluorescence microscopy image of H2B labeled with a primary anti-H2B antibody and Alexa Fluor 647- conjugated secondary antibody (lower portion, gray).

The nanodomain areas and the number of localizations per nanodomain were comparable in living and fixed cells. To rule out the possibility that the observed clustered distribution of H2B was due to sample preparation or labeling methods used, we performed a series of control experiments. First, the clustered distribution of H2B was independent of the fixation and permeabilization protocols used (Figures S1D and S1E). Second, STORM images contained discrete nanodomains when H2B was indirectly labeled using an antibody against SNAP tag in cells stably expressing H2B-SNAP (Figure S1F). Third, we ruled out potential artifacts in H2B STORM images associated with the large size of the antibody by comparing to nanobody labeling (Figures S1G–S1N). Fourth, labeling efficiency defects were also ruled out by computer simulations of nucleosome arrangements (see further details in Extended Experimental Procedures and DNA Fiber Is Not Fully Occupied with Nucleosomes section). Finally, to confirm the existence of H2B nanodomains in living cells we imaged H2B-mEos2 or H2B-PA-mCherry expressing hFbs. In both cases super-resolution imaging reveled discrete and spatially separated nanodomains as in the case of fixed cells (Figures 1B and S1O). We next analyzed the nucleosome organization in cells undergoing massive epigenome modifications and chromatin rearrangements. For this, hFbs were treated with Trichostatin A (TSA) (TSA-hFb), a potent inhibitor of histone deacetylase enzyme, which leads to genome-wide decondensation of chromatin through accumulation of acetylation groups on histone tails (Tóth et al., 2004Tóth K.F. Knoch T.A. Wachsmuth M. Frank-Stöhr M. Stöhr M. Bacher C.P. Müller G. Rippe K. Trichostatin A-induced histone acetylation causes decondensation of interphase chromatin.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 4277-4287Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). As expected, there was a large increase in H3 acetylation after TSA treatment (Figure S1P). TSA treatment also resulted in visually evident changes in the nuclear distribution of H2B nanodomains (Figure 1A, right), which appeared dimmer and hence contained less localizations. Furthermore, the nanodomains were also more dispersed within the nucleus (Figure 1A, right zooms). The H2B nanodomain density was enhanced by ∼10% in the nuclear periphery of TSA-hFbs compared to the nuclear interior, although it was less dense than the nuclear periphery of untreated hFbs. Finally, the distribution of acetylated H3 was also highly dispersed in the nuclei, mirroring the spatial re-distribution observed for the H2B nanodomains after TSA treatment (Figure S1P). These changes overall indicate that nucleosomes undergo spatial rearrangement in hFb nuclei upon chromatin decondensation. To gain quantitative insight into the H2B nanodomains, we next developed a cluster identification algorithm to group the localizations in STORM images into nanodomains (Extended Experimental Procedures; Figures 1C and S1Q). Quantitative analysis revealed that the distributions of the number of localizations per nanodomain, nanodomain areas, and nanodomain nearest neighbor distances (nnds) were shifted to lower values in TSA-hFbs compared to hFbs (Figure 1D), and hence nucleosomes showed statistically significant spatial re-organization after TSA treatment and chromatin decondensation. In control experiments, nanodomain areas of hFbs were similar when H2B was labeled with an antibody (Mean Area ± SEM = 830 ± 70 nm2, n = 11 cells), with GFP-nanobody in hFbs transfected with H2B-GFP (Mean Area ± SEM = 660 ± 70 nm2, n = 7 cells, p = 0.1760) and in living or fixed hFbs expressing H2B-mEos2 or H2B-PA-mCherry (Mean Area ± SEM = 660 ± 30 nm2 in living cells, n = 12 cells, p = 0.068 and 610 ± 40 nm2 in fixed cells, n = 5 cells, p = 0.1088, Figure S1R), indicating that the large size of the antibody or fixation did not significantly affect the spatial resolution of H2B STORM images or the organization of nanodomains. The number of localizations per nanodomain was lower when using fluorescent proteins compared to organic fluorophores as expected (Figure S1R), since mEos2 and PA-mCherry are known to undergo less blinking and photoactivate with only moderate efficiency (Durisic et al., 2014Durisic N.

Biol. 2014; 20: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) compared to AlexaFluor647. To assess the nucleosome organization of pluripotent cells, we next imaged H2B in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). mESCs were cultured under two different media conditions: (1) with serum and the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (sLif), and (2) with inhibitors of two kinases (Mek and Gsk3) known as “2i” and Lif (2iLif). mESCs cultured in sLif have heterogeneous morphology, exhibit heterogeneous expression of pluripotency factors (Cahan and Daley, 2013Cahan P. Daley G.Q. Origins and implications of pluripotent stem cell variability and heterogeneity.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 14: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), and display appreciable expression of ectoderm and mesoderm genes (Marks et al., 2012Marks H. Kalkan T. Menafra R.

On the other hand, 2iLif maintains mESCs in a ground-state (Ying et al., 2008Ying Q.L. Wray J. Nichols J. Batlle-Morera L. Doble B. Woodgett J. Cohen P. Smith A. The ground state of embryonic stem cell self-renewal.Nature. 2008; 453: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (2544) Google Scholar), characterized by no predetermined program of their transcriptional profile and a more homogenous expression of pluripotency factors (Marks et al., 2012Marks H.

As expected, mESCs cultured in sLif expressed varying levels of the pluripotency marker Nanog (Figure S2A). Low Nanog expressing cells (Figure S2A, upper) had bright nanodomains in STORM images (i.e., containing a large number of localizations) (Figure 2A, type 1, yellow arrowheads). On the other hand, high Nanog expressing mESCs cultured in sLif (Figure S2A, lower) mostly had dim nanodomains (Figure 2B, type 2, cyan arrowheads). In addition, the nanodomains appeared more dispersed inside the nucleus. Nanodomains of mESCs cultured in 2iLif and of mESCsTcf3−/− were mostly dim (Figures 2C, 2D, and 2G). Similar to 2iLif, the deletion of Tcf3 (mESCsTcf3−/−), a key effector of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, was also previously shown to maintain the ground-state of pluripotency (Cole et al., 2008Cole M.F.

Here, high-throughput sequencing and crosslinking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) experiments of human Argonaute (AGO) during HCV infection showed robust AGO binding on the HCV 5'UTR at known and predicted miR-122 sites. On the human transcriptome, we observed reduced AGO binding and functional mRNA de-repression of miR-122 targets during virus infection. This miR-122 ""sponge"" effect was relieved and redirected to miR-15 targets by swapping the miRNA tropism of the virus. Single-cell expression data from reporters containing miR-122 sites showed significant de-repression during HCV infection depending on expression level and site number. We describe a quantitative mathematical model of HCV-induced miR-122 sequestration and propose that such miR-122 inhibition by HCV RNA may result in global de-repression of host miR-122 targets, providing an environment fertile for the long-term oncogenic potential of HCV."
https://openalex.org/W2162563461,"Dynamics of the nucleosome and exposure of nucleosomal DNA play key roles in many nuclear processes, but local dynamics of the nucleosome and its modulation by DNA sequence are poorly understood. Using single-molecule assays, we observed that the nucleosome can unwrap asymmetrically and directionally under force. The relative DNA flexibility of the inner quarters of nucleosomal DNA controls the unwrapping direction such that the nucleosome unwraps from the stiffer side. If the DNA flexibility is similar on two sides, it stochastically unwraps from either side. The two ends of the nucleosome are orchestrated such that the opening of one end helps to stabilize the other end, providing a mechanism to amplify even small differences in flexibility to a large asymmetry in nucleosome stability. Our discovery of DNA flexibility as a critical factor for nucleosome dynamics and mechanical stability suggests a novel mechanism of gene regulation by DNA sequence and modifications."

Here, we utilized human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived endothelial cells (ECs) to show that heterozygous nonsense mutations in NOTCH1 that cause aortic valve calcification disrupt the epigenetic architecture, resulting in derepression of latent pro-osteogenic and -inflammatory gene networks. Hemodynamic shear stress, which protects valves from calcification in vivo, activated anti-osteogenic and anti-inflammatory networks in NOTCH1+/+, but not NOTCH1+/−, iPSC-derived ECs. NOTCH1 haploinsufficiency altered H3K27ac at NOTCH1-bound enhancers, dysregulating downstream transcription of more than 1,000 genes involved in osteogenesis, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Computational predictions of the disrupted NOTCH1-dependent gene network revealed regulatory nodes that, when modulated, restored the network toward the NOTCH1+/+ state. Our results highlight how alterations in transcription factor dosage affect gene networks leading to human disease and reveal nodes for potential therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2063704000,"Adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) have been used to prevent and treat influenza A virus infections for many years; however, resistance to these drugs has been widely reported in the world. To investigate the frequency and distribution of M2 gene mutations in adamantane-resistant influenza variants circulated in the world between 1902 and 2013, 31251 available M2 protein sequences from different HA-subtype influenza A viruses (H1–H17) were analyzed and adamantane resistance-associated mutations were compared (L26F, V27A, A30T, A30V, S31N, G34E, and L38F). We find that 45.2% (n = 14132) of influenza A (H1–H17) viruses circulating globally were resistant to adamantanes, and the vast majority of resistant viruses (95%) bear S31N mutations. Whereas, only about 1% have V27A mutations and other mutations (L26F, A30T, G34E, and L38F) were extremely rare (their prevalence appeared to be < 0.2%). Our results confirm that H1, H3, H5, H7, H9, and H17 subtype influenza A viruses exhibit high-level resistance to adamantanes. In contrast, the appearance of adamantane-resistant mutants in H2, H4, H6, H10, and H11 subtypes was rare. However, no adamantane resistance viruses were identified among other HA subtypes (H8, H12–H16). Our findings indicate that the frequency and distribution of adamantane-resistant influenza variants varied among different HA subtypes, host species, years of isolation, and geographical areas. This comprehensive study raises concerns about the increasing prevalence of adamantane-resistant influenza A viruses and highlights the importance of monitoring the emergence and worldwide spread of adamantane-resistant variants."

These results demonstrate the importance of studying post-transcriptional regulation of disease-driving proteins to reveal factors underlying neurodegenerative disease. Misfolded proteins underlie the pathogenesis of a number of neurodegenerative conditions, collectively known as proteinopathies. Alzheimer disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and polyglutamine diseases such as Huntington disease all fall into this category (Ross and Poirier, 2004Ross C.A. Poirier M.A. Protein aggregation and neurodegenerative disease.Nat. Med. 2004; 10: S10-S17Crossref PubMed Scopus (2453) Google Scholar, Soto, 2003Soto C. Unfolding the role of protein misfolding in neurodegenerative diseases.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). Despite the heterogeneity of their pathogenic mechanisms, in each of these diseases, the misfolded protein accumulates in neurons and exerts toxicity. Somewhat surprisingly, the brain can also be sensitive to elevated levels of wild-type (WT) protein: duplication of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) locus causes autosomal dominant early-onset AD (Rovelet-Lecrux et al., 2006Rovelet-Lecrux A.

Along similar lines, it has been shown recently that leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) mutations, the most common cause of inherited PD, increase overall protein synthesis in Drosophila, and that reduction in dLRRK levels is protective (Martin et al., 2014Martin I. Kim J.W. Lee B.D. Kang H.C. Xu J.C. Jia H. Stankowski J. Kim M.S. Zhong J.

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is paradigmatic of the subgroup of polyglutamine (polyQ) proteinopathies caused by expansion of an unstable CAG repeat in the coding region of the relevant disease gene, in this case ATAXIN1 (ATXN1) (Orr et al., 1993Orr H.T. Chung M.Y. Banfi S. Kwiatkowski Jr., T.J. Servadio A. Beaudet A.L. McCall A.E. Duvick L.A. Ranum L.P. Zoghbi H.Y. Expansion of an unstable trinucleotide CAG repeat in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1.Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). The onset of SCA1 is usually in mid-life, when motor coordination begins to deteriorate because of cerebellar degeneration; patients eventually die of bulbar dysfunction that renders them unable to clear their airway (Zoghbi and Orr, 2009Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Pathogenic mechanisms of a polyglutamine-mediated neurodegenerative disease, spinocerebellar ataxia type 1.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7425-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). There is clear evidence that the expanded polyQ tract stabilizes ATXN1 and causes it to resist being cleared by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, in effect increasing its abundance in neurons (Cummings et al., 1999Cummings C.J. Reinstein E. Sun Y. Antalffy B. Jiang Y. Ciechanover A. Orr H.T. Beaudet A.L. Zoghbi H.Y.

Notably, the severity of neurodegeneration in fly and mouse models of SCA1 correlates directly with levels of mutant ATXN1 protein (Burright et al., 1995Burright E.N. Clark H.B. Servadio A.

Although the artificiality of transgenic models limits their relevance to the human disease, these results from SCA1 transgenic mice, along with the evidence from familial AD and PD patients, led us to ask whether there were post-transcriptional modifications that might increase the levels of WT ATXN1 in a more physiologically relevant way and shed further light on the role of protein levels in neurodegeneration. The extraordinarily long 3′ UTR, approximately 7 kb in ATXN1 mRNA, seemed to promise a rich source of key brain-enriched post-transcriptional regulatory elements. To our surprise, we found that ATXN1 is regulated directly by an RNA-binding protein (RBP), Pumilio1, and that a brain-wide increase in WT Atxn1 levels of only ∼50%, caused by Pum1 haploinsufficiency, is sufficient to cause marked neurodegeneration in mice. Two types of molecules are known to modulate protein levels by binding to the corresponding mRNA: RBPs and microRNAs (miRNAs). RBPs bind to specific sequence motifs or secondary structures in mRNAs and regulate multiple steps in RNA metabolism, such as splicing, nucleus-cytoplasm transport, and translation (Lukong et al., 2008Lukong K.E. Chang K.W. Khandjian E.W. Richard S. RNA-binding proteins in human genetic disease.Trends Genet. 2008; 24: 416-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). On the other hand, miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that control various developmental and physiological processes by suppressing the expression of their target genes via binding of a short (6–8 nucleotide) complementary seed region in the 3′ UTRs of mRNAs (Bartel, 2009Bartel D.P. MicroRNAs: target recognition and regulatory functions.Cell. 2009; 136: 215-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15858) Google Scholar). We first scanned the ∼7 kb-long ATXN1 3′ UTR for potential binding sites for miRNAs by using the TargetScan (Friedman et al., 2009Friedman R.C. Farh K.K. Burge C.B. Bartel D.P. Most mammalian mRNAs are conserved targets of microRNAs.Genome Res. 2009; 19: 92-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (6362) Google Scholar), CoMeTa (Gennarino et al., 2012Gennarino V.A. D’Angelo G. Dharmalingam G. Fernandez S. Russolillo G. Sanges R. Mutarelli M. Belcastro V. Ballabio A. Verde P. et al.Identification of microRNA-regulated gene networks by expression analysis of target genes.Genome Res. 2012; 22: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and HOCTARdb (Gennarino et al., 2011Gennarino V.A. Sardiello M. Mutarelli M. Dharmalingam G. Maselli V. Lago G. Banfi S. HOCTAR database: a unique resource for microRNA target prediction.Gene. 2011; 480: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) prediction tools. As expected, scanning identified dozens of potential miRNA-binding sites (data not shown). Because RNA folding mediates miRNA-RNA interactions by masking or exposing specific binding-site sequences, we analyzed the secondary structure of the ATXN1-3′ UTR (Wan et al., 2014Wan Y. Qu K. Zhang Q.C. Flynn R.A. Manor O. Ouyang Z. Zhang J. Spitale R.C. Snyder M.P. Segal E. Chang H.Y. Landscape and variation of RNA secondary structure across the human transcriptome.Nature. 2014; 505: 706-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) to prioritize the best candidate ATXN1-modulating miRNAs. This revealed a complicated secondary structure that masks the binding sites for almost all of the putative miRNAs that might target the ATXN1-3′ UTR (Figure S1). For miRNAs to act on ATXN1 mRNA, they would likely require the help of RBPs to unfold such a structure. Scan analysis of the human ATXN1-3′ UTR revealed three putative Pumilio1 (PUM1) binding motifs (Wang et al., 2002Wang X. McLachlan J. Zamore P.D. Hall T.M. Modular recognition of RNA by a human pumilio-homology domain.Cell. 2002; 110: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) at positions 682, 2812, and 5275 from the beginning of the UTR (Figure 1A). The RBP PUM1 regulates its target genes by inducing a conformational switch in the 3′ UTR that unmasks specific miRNA-binding sites (Kedde et al., 2010Kedde M. van Kouwenhove M. Zwart W. Oude Vrielink J.A. Elkon R. Agami R. A Pumilio-induced RNA structure switch in p27-3′ UTR controls miR-221 and miR-222 accessibility.Nat.

Pumilio facilitates miRNA regulation of the E2F3 oncogene.Genes Dev. 2012; 26: 356-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the motif in position 5275 (Figure 1A, red box) is highly conserved across several species and represents the canonical PUM1-binding motif (5′-UGUAXAUA-3′) (Galgano et al., 2008Galgano A. Forrer M. Jaskiewicz L. Kanitz A. Zavolan M. Gerber A.P. Comparative analysis of mRNA targets for human PUF-family proteins suggests extensive interaction with the miRNA regulatory system.PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e3164Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, Wang et al., 2002Wang X.

Overexpressing PUM1 in HEK293T cells reduced ATXN1 mRNA levels, whereas decreasing PUM1 by two different RNAi increased ATXN1 mRNA levels (Figure 1B). In vitro overexpression of PUM1 consistently decreased the luciferase activity of a reporter construct expressing the full-length ATXN1-3′ UTR (Figure 1C). Mutation of each PUM1-binding motif within the ATXN1-3′ UTR revealed that only the most conserved site, containing the canonical motif, is functional; when mutated, it abolished the effect of PUM1 overexpression on luciferase activity (Figure 1D). To examine the endogenous expression pattern of Pum1 in mice, we performed in situ hybridization assays (ISH) and western blot on 3-week-old mouse brain sections. Pum1 was expressed in all major brain regions in WT mice, almost completely absent in the brain of null mice, and reduced in heterozygous (Pum1+/−) brains (Figure S2A). We also confirmed that Pum1 protein is widely expressed in the brain at 5 weeks of age (Figure S2B). To determine whether Pum1 binds Atxn1 mRNA in vivo, we performed an RNA cross-linking and immunoprecipitation assay (RNA-Clip) on cerebra and cerebella from 5-week-old WT animals, using Pum1 knockout mice (Pum1−/−) as negative controls (Figure S2C). We found that Pum1 physically interacts with the conserved binding site of the Atxn1-3′ UTR in WT mice (Figure 2A). Consistent with the finding that Pum1 negatively regulates Atxn1, Pum1 heterozygous (Pum1+/−) mice showed increased levels of both Atxn1 protein (Figure 2B) and mRNA (Figure 2C)—approximately 30% in the cerebrum and 50% in the cerebellum—and Pum1−/− mice showed even more pronounced increases (Figures 2B and 2C). These data demonstrate that Pum1 directly regulates Atxn1 levels in the mouse brain. Several mRNA subsets contain target sites for both RBPs and miRNAs, and cooperation between these two types of post-transcriptional regulators has been described (Bhattacharyya et al., 2006Bhattacharyya S.N.

This may be particularly relevant for PUM1, as studies have indicated extensive interaction between PUM1 and the miRNA regulatory system (Kedde et al., 2010Kedde M. van Kouwenhove M. Zwart W. Oude Vrielink J.A. Elkon R. Agami R. A Pumilio-induced RNA structure switch in p27-3′ UTR controls miR-221 and miR-222 accessibility.Nat.

Comparative analysis of mRNA targets for human PUF-family proteins suggests extensive interaction with the miRNA regulatory system.PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e3164Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). To determine whether PUM1 regulates ATXN1 through miRNA by inducing a conformational switch in its 3′ UTR, we overexpressed PUM1 in HEK293T cells along with miR-101a, a miRNA known to modulate ATXN1 levels (Lee et al., 2008Lee Y. Samaco R.C. Gatchel J.R. Thaller C. Orr H.T. Zoghbi H.Y. miR-19, miR-101 and miR-130 co-regulate ATXN1 levels to potentially modulate SCA1 pathogenesis.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 1137-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). These conditions significantly reduced levels of ATXN1 protein (Figures 3A and S3A) and mRNA (Figure S3E), but no more than overexpressing miR-101a or PUM1 separately. In fact, overexpression of miR-101a along with PUM1 knockdown consistently decreased levels of ATXN1 protein (Figures 3B and S3B) and mRNA (Figure S3F) to a degree comparable to that of miR-101a overexpression alone. These results suggest that PUM1 regulates ATXN1 in a miR-101a-independent fashion but do not exclude the possibility that other miRNAs bind the ATXN1 3′ UTR. To obviate testing the effect of PUM1 on all possible miRNAs regulating ATXN1, we knocked down the catalytic engine of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), Argonaute-2 (AGO2), to globally inhibit miRNA binding and retested PUM1’s ability to regulate ATXN1. We found that PUM1 overexpression in the context of AGO2 knockdown still reduced levels of both ATXN1 protein (Figures 3C and S3C) and mRNA (Figure S3G). Conversely, simultaneous RNAi of PUM1 and AGO2 increased levels of both ATXN1 protein (Figures 3D and S3D) and mRNA (Figure S3H), but no more than silencing PUM1 alone. These data establish that PUM1 modulates ATXN1 levels directly by binding its 3′ UTR, without the assistance of the miRNA machinery.Figure S3PUM1 Modulates the Stability of WT ATXN1 Levels in an miRNA-Independent Manner, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A–D) Western blot quantification of protein lysate from HEK293T cells upon (A) overexpression of both PUM1 and miR-101a, (B) RNAi PUM1 (siPUM1) followed by overexpression of miR-101a, (C) overexpression of PUM1 followed by RNAi AGO2 (siAGO2), and (D) RNAi of both PUM1 and AGO2.

To further explore the mechanism by which PUM1 regulates ATXN1 levels, we tested whether PUM1 influences the stability or the translation of ATXN1 mRNA. We transfected HEK293T with a luciferase reporter encoding an ATXN1-3′ UTR harboring either the conserved WT or mutated (Mut) PUM1-binding site. Later, we used treatment with DRB (5,6-dichloro-1-β-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole), a drug that inhibits RNA translation by blocking RNA polymerase II in the early elongation stage, to assess the levels of the reporter transcript. Upon the addition of DRB (time-point zero), the relative expression of reporter transcripts containing the ATXN1-3′ UTR Mut binding site is considerably higher than that of transcripts containing the ATXN1-3′ UTR WT binding site (Figure 3E, top panel). This difference remains stable over time until 8 hr after DRB addition. Remarkably, the ATXN1-3′ UTR with Mut binding site reached its half-life after 19 hr, whereas the ATXN1-3′ UTR with WT binding site decreased linearly over time, reaching its half-life at nearly 8 hr (Figure 3E, top panel). Given that the promoter sequences of the ATXN1-3′ UTR constructs carrying either WT or Mut binding sites are exactly the same and that transfection of neither construct affected PUM1 protein levels, we conclude that PUM1 promotes degradation of ATXN1 by binding its 3′ UTR (Figures 3E, bottom panel and S3I). To investigate physiological changes in ATXN1 mRNA, we decided to knock down PUM1 in HEK293T cells and measure the half-life of endogenous ATXN1 mRNA at different time points after DRB treatment. Knockdown of PUM1 (siPUM1) was associated with a significant increase of ATXN1 mRNA from time zero and remained upregulated up to 8 hr after translation inhibition (Figure 3F, top panel). Our calculation consistently showed that the half-life of ATXN1 mRNA was much longer (nearly 12 hr) after siPUM1 than after siScramble transfection (∼4 hr) (Figure 3F, top panel). We confirmed PUM1 downregulation by quantifying mRNA at time zero (Figure S3J) and protein levels at different time points (Figures 3F, bottom panel and S3K). PUM1 thus increases ATXN1 levels by directly regulating the stability of ATXN1 mRNA. Recent studies have shown that Pum1 is an essential regulator of spermatogenesis in mice and promotes differentiation of embryonic stem cells (Chen et al., 2012Chen D. Zheng W. Lin A. Uyhazi K.

Compared to WT and Pum1+/− littermates, Pum1−/− mice were significantly smaller in body length, weight, and brain weight and size (Figures 4A and S4B). Surprisingly, the loss of one copy of Pum1 was sufficient to cause impaired performance on the accelerating rotarod assay in 5-week-old mice (Figure 4B): the motor deficit had progressed in severity by 12 weeks (Figure S4C). This motor incoordination was even more dramatic in Pum1−/− age-matched mice (Figures 4B and S4C), which performed equally poorly in the dowel-walking test (Figures S4D and S4E)—as poorly, in fact, as SCA1 mice at this age in both assays (Watase et al., 2002Watase K.

https://openalex.org/W2073199141,"Standard deviational ellipse (SDE) has long served as a versatile GIS tool for delineating the geographic distribution of concerned features. This paper firstly summarizes two existing models of calculating SDE, and then proposes a novel approach to constructing the same SDE based on spectral decomposition of the sample covariance, by which the SDE concept is naturally generalized into higher dimensional Euclidean space, named standard deviational hyper-ellipsoid (SDHE). Then, rigorous recursion formulas are derived for calculating the confidence levels of scaled SDHE with arbitrary magnification ratios in any dimensional space. Besides, an inexact-newton method based iterative algorithm is also proposed for solving the corresponding magnification ratio of a scaled SDHE when the confidence probability and space dimensionality are pre-specified. These results provide an efficient manner to supersede the traditional table lookup of tabulated chi-square distribution. Finally, synthetic data is employed to generate the 1-3 multiple SDEs and SDHEs. And exploratory analysis by means of SDEs and SDHEs are also conducted for measuring the spread concentrations of Hong Kong’s H1N1 in 2009."
https://openalex.org/W2021187035,"High-fat diet (HFD) has been applied to a variety of inbred mouse strains to induce obesity and obesity related metabolic complications. In this study, we determined HFD induced development of metabolic disorders on outbred female CD-1 mice in a time dependent manner. Compared to mice on regular chow, HFD-fed CD-1 mice gradually gained more fat mass and consequently exhibited accelerated body weight gain, which was associated with adipocyte hypertrophy and up-regulated expression of adipose inflammatory chemokines and cytokines such as Mcp-1 and Tnf-α. Increased fat accumulation in white adipose tissue subsequently led to ectopic fat deposition in brown adipose tissue, giving rise to whitening of brown adipose tissue without altering plasma level of triglyceride. Ectopic fat deposition was also observed in the liver, which was associated with elevated expression of key genes involved in hepatic lipid sequestration, including Ppar-γ2, Cd36 and Mgat1. Notably, adipose chronic inflammation and ectopic lipid deposition in the liver and brown fat were accompanied by glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, which was correlated with hyperinsulinemia and pancreatic islet hypertrophy. Collectively, these results demonstrate sequentially the events that HFD induces physiological changes leading to metabolic disorders in an outbred mouse model more closely resembling heterogeneity of the human population."
https://openalex.org/W2105077783,"Mineralized biomaterials are promising for use in bone tissue engineering. Culturing osteogenic cells in such materials will potentially generate biological bone grafts that may even further augment bone healing. Here, we studied osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in an alginate hydrogel system where the cells were co-immobilized with alkaline phosphatase (ALP) for gradual mineralization of the microenvironment. MSC were embedded in unmodified alginate beads and alginate beads mineralized with ALP to generate a polymer/hydroxyapatite scaffold mimicking the composition of bone. The initial scaffold mineralization induced further mineralization of the beads with nanosized particles, and scanning electron micrographs demonstrated presence of collagen in the mineralized and unmineralized alginate beads cultured in osteogenic medium. Cells in both types of beads sustained high viability and metabolic activity for the duration of the study (21 days) as evaluated by live/dead staining and alamar blue assay. MSC in beads induced to differentiate in osteogenic direction expressed higher mRNA levels of osteoblast-specific genes (RUNX2, COL1AI, SP7, BGLAP) than MSC in traditional cell cultures. Furthermore, cells differentiated in beads expressed both sclerostin (SOST) and dental matrix protein-1 (DMP1), markers for late osteoblasts/osteocytes. In conclusion, Both ALP-modified and unmodified alginate beads provide an environment that enhance osteogenic differentiation compared with traditional 2D culture. Also, the ALP-modified alginate beads showed profound mineralization and thus have the potential to serve as a bone substitute in tissue engineering."

To realize this objective, we collected water samplings from 67 sampling sites in the Honghe River watershed of China with Grid GIS method to analyze six parameters including dissolved oxygen (DO), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), nitrite nitrogen (NO2-N), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP). Single factor pollution index and comprehensive pollution index were adopted to explore main water pollutants and evaluate water quality pollution level. Based on two evaluate methods, Geo-statistical analysis and Geographical Information System (GIS) were used to visualize the spatial pollution characteristics and identifying potential polluted risky regions. The results indicated that the general water quality in the watershed has been exposed to various pollutants, in which TP, NO2-N and TN were the main pollutants and seriously exceeded the standard of Category III. The zones of TP, TN, DO, NO2-N and NH3-N pollution covered 99.07%, 62.22%, 59.72%, 37.34% and 13.82% of the watershed respectively, and they were from medium to serious polluted. 83.27% of the watershed in total was polluted by comprehensive pollutants.

https://openalex.org/W2074500132,"Objective The increase in adipocytes induced by chemotherapeutic drugs may play a negative role in hematopoietic recovery. However, the mechanism underlying adipocyte differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in hematopoietic stress is still unknown. Hence, the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in adipocyte differentiation under hematopoietic stress was investigated in vitro and in vivo. Methods The roles of cellular ROS in adipogenesis were investigated in vivo through an adipocyte hyperplasia marrow model under hematopoietic stress induced by arabinosylcytosine (Ara-C) and in vitro via adipocyte differentiation of human MSCs. ROS levels were detected using the CM-H2DCFDA probe and Mito-SOX dye. Adipogenesis was evaluated by histopathology and oil red O staining, whereas detection of mRNA levels of antioxidant enzymes and adipogenesis markers was performed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. Results ROS were found to play an important role in regulating adipocyte differentiation of MSCs by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ,) while the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine acts through ROS to inhibit adipocyte differentiation. The elevated ROS levels induced by Ara-C were caused by both over-generation of mitochondrial ROS and reduction of antioxidant enzymes (Cu/Zn Superoxide dismutase and catalase). Our findings suggest that a mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant could diminish adipocyte differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1999895836,"The effect of water temperature on biochemical composition, growth and reproduction of the ornamental shrimp, Neocaridina heteropoda heteropoda, was investigated to determine the optimum temperature for its culture. The effect of embryo incubation temperature on the subsequent performance of juveniles was also evaluated. Ovigerous females and recently hatched juveniles (JI) were maintained during egg incubation and for a 90-day period, respectively, at three temperatures (24, 28 and 32°C). Incubation period increased with decreasing water temperature, but the number and size of JI were similar among treatments. At day 30 of the 90-day period, body weight and growth increment (GI) at 24°C were lower than those at 28 and 32°C. On subsequent days, GI at 24°C exceeded that at 28 and 32°C, leading to a similar body weight among treatments. These results suggest growth was delayed at 24°C, but only for 30 days after hatching. The lipid concentration tended to be lowest, intermediate and highest at 28, 32 and 24°C, respectively, possibly as a consequence of the metabolic processes involved in growth and ovarian maturation. Protein and glycogen concentrations were similar among treatments. Both the growth trajectory and biochemical composition of shrimps were affected by the temperature experienced during the 90-day growth period independently of the embryo incubation temperature. During the growth period, shrimps reached sexual maturity and mated, with the highest proportion of ovigerous females occurring at 28°C. All the females that matured and mated at 32°C lost their eggs, indicating a potentially stressful effect of high temperature on ovarian maturation. Based on high survival and good growth performance of shrimps at the three temperatures tested over the 90-day period it is concluded that N. heteropoda heteropoda is tolerant to a wide range of water temperatures, with 28°C being the optimum temperature for its culture."
https://openalex.org/W2068175785,"Obesity is one of the leading risk factors for developing renal cell carcinoma, an immunogenic tumor that is treated clinically with immunostimulatory therapies. Currently, however, the mechanisms linking obesity with renal cancer incidence are unclear. Using a model of diet-induced obesity, we found that obese BALB/c mice with orthotopic renal tumors had increased total frequencies of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in renal tumors and spleens by d14 post-tumor challenge, relative to lean counterparts. Renal tumors from obese mice had elevated concentrations of the known myeloid cell chemoattractant CCL2, which was produced locally by increased percentages of dendritic cells, macrophages, B cells, and CD45- cells in tumors. MDSC expression of the CCL2 receptor, CCR2, was unaltered by obesity but greater percentages of CCR2+ MDSCs were present in renal tumors from obese mice. Of note, the intracellular arginase levels and per-cell suppressive capacities of tumor-infiltrating and splenic MDSCs were unchanged in obese mice relative to lean controls. Thus, our findings suggest that obesity promotes renal tumor progression via development of a robust immunosuppressive environment that is characterized by heightened local and systemic MDSC prevalence. Targeted intervention of the CCL2/CCR2 pathway may facilitate immune-mediated renal tumor clearance in the obese."
https://openalex.org/W2007483962,"Alkylating agents are widely used chemotherapeutics in the treatment of many cancers, including leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, sarcoma, lung, breast and ovarian cancer. Melphalan is the most commonly used chemotherapeutic agent against multiple myeloma. However, despite a 70–80% initial response rate, virtually all patients eventually relapse due to the emergence of drug-resistant tumour cells. By using global proteomic and transcriptomic profiling on melphalan sensitive and resistant RPMI8226 cell lines followed by functional assays, we discovered changes in cellular processes and pathways not previously associated with melphalan resistance in multiple myeloma cells, including a metabolic switch conforming to the Warburg effect (aerobic glycolysis), and an elevated oxidative stress response mediated by VEGF/IL8-signaling. In addition, up-regulated aldo-keto reductase levels of the AKR1C family involved in prostaglandin synthesis contribute to the resistant phenotype. Finally, selected metabolic and oxidative stress response enzymes were targeted by inhibitors, several of which displayed a selective cytotoxicity against the melphalan-resistant cells and should be further explored to elucidate their potential to overcome melphalan resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2085516242,"Pleiotropic genetic variants have independent effects on different phenotypes. C-reactive protein (CRP) is associated with several cardiometabolic phenotypes. Shared genetic backgrounds may partially underlie these associations. We conducted a genome-wide analysis to identify the shared genetic background of inflammation and cardiometabolic phenotypes using published genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We also evaluated whether the pleiotropic effects of such loci were biological or mediated in nature. First, we examined whether 283 common variants identified for 10 cardiometabolic phenotypes in GWAS are associated with CRP level. Second, we tested whether 18 variants identified for serum CRP are associated with 10 cardiometabolic phenotypes. We used a Bonferroni corrected p-value of 1.1×10-04 (0.05/463) as a threshold of significance. We evaluated the independent pleiotropic effect on both phenotypes using individual level data from the Women Genome Health Study. Evaluating the genetic overlap between inflammation and cardiometabolic phenotypes, we found 13 pleiotropic regions. Additional analyses showed that 6 regions (APOC1, HNF1A, IL6R, PPP1R3B, HNF4A and IL1F10) appeared to have a pleiotropic effect on CRP independent of the effects on the cardiometabolic phenotypes. These included loci where individuals carrying the risk allele for CRP encounter higher lipid levels and risk of type 2 diabetes. In addition, 5 regions (GCKR, PABPC4, BCL7B, FTO and TMEM18) had an effect on CRP largely mediated through the cardiometabolic phenotypes. In conclusion, our results show genetic pleiotropy among inflammation and cardiometabolic phenotypes. In addition to reverse causation, our data suggests that pleiotropic genetic variants partially underlie the association between CRP and cardiometabolic phenotypes."

https://openalex.org/W2015853575,"Cells make accurate decisions in the face of molecular noise and environmental fluctuations by relying not only on present pathway activity, but also on their memory of past signaling dynamics. Once a decision is made, cellular transitions are often rapid and switch-like due to positive feedback loops in the regulatory network. While positive feedback loops are good at promoting switch-like transitions, they are not expected to retain information to inform subsequent decisions. However, this expectation is based on our current understanding of network motifs that accounts for temporal, but not spatial, dynamics. Here, we show how spatial organization of the feedback-driven yeast G1/S switch enables the transmission of memory of past pheromone exposure across this transition. We expect this to be one of many examples where the exquisite spatial organization of the eukaryotic cell enables previously well-characterized network motifs to perform new and unexpected signal processing functions."
https://openalex.org/W2077051945,"In mosquitoes, the maternally inherited bacterial Wolbachia induce a form of embryonic lethality called cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). This property can be used to reduce the density of mosquito field populations through inundative releases of incompatible males in order to sterilize females (Incompatible Insect Technique, or IIT, strategy). We have previously constructed the LR[wPip(Is)] line representing a good candidate for controlling field populations of the Culex quinquefasciatus mosquito in the islands of the south-western Indian Ocean. The main purpose of the present study was to fill the gap between laboratory experiments and field implementation, i.e. assessing mating competitiveness of these incompatible males under semi-field conditions. In a first set of experiments, we analyzed crossing relationships between LR[wPip(Is)] males and La Réunion field females collected as larvae in 19 distinct localities throughout the island. This investigation revealed total embryonic mortality, confirming the strong sterilizing capacity of LR[wPip(Is)] males. Subsequently, mating competitiveness of LR[wPip(Is)] males was assessed under semi-field conditions in the presence of field males and females from La Réunion. Confrontations were carried out in April and December using different ratios of LR[wPip(Is)] to field males. The results indicated that the LR[wPip(Is)] males successfully compete with field males in mating with field females, displaying even higher competitiveness than field males in April. Our results support the implementation of small-scale field tests in order to assess the feasibility of IIT against Cx. quinquefasciatus in the islands of southwestern Indian Ocean where this mosquito species is a proven competent vector for human pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W1976049462,"Tendon is a dynamic tissue whose structure and function is influenced by mechanical loading, but little is known about the fundamental mechanisms that regulate tendon growth and remodeling in vivo. Data from cultured tendon fibroblasts indicated that the p38 MAPK pathway plays an important role in tendon fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis in vitro. To gain greater insight into the mechanisms of tendon growth, and explore the role of p38 MAPK signaling in this process, we tested the hypotheses that inducing plantaris tendon growth through the ablation of the synergist Achilles tendon would result in rapid expansion of a neotendon matrix surrounding the original tendon, and that treatment with the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 would prevent this growth. Rats were treated with vehicle or SB203580, and subjected to synergist ablation by bilateral tenectomy of the Achilles tendon. Changes in histological and biochemical properties of plantaris tendons were analyzed 3, 7, or 28 days after overload, and comparisons were made to non-overloaded animals. By 28 days after overload, tendon mass had increased by 30% compared to non-overloaded samples, and cross-sectional area (CSA) increased by around 50%, with most of the change occurring in the neotendon. The expansion in CSA initially occurred through the synthesis of a hyaluronic acid rich matrix that was progressively replaced with mature collagen. Pericytes were present in areas of active tendon growth, but never in the original tendon ECM. Inhibition of p38 MAPK resulted in a profound decrease in IL6 expression, and had a modest effect on the expression of other ECM and cell proliferation genes, but had a negligible impact on overall tendon growth. The combined results from this study provided novel insights into tendon mechanobiology, and suggest that p38 MAPK signaling does not appear to be necessary for tendon growth in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2036186890,"Background Few studies have investigated the association between objectively measured traffic noise and health-related quality of life. However, as traffic noise has been associated with both cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and health-issues including sleeping problems, annoyance, and stress, it seems plausible that traffic noise is associated with health-related quality of life. Methods Between 1999 and 2002, a cohort of 38,964 Danes filled in the short form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire. Residential exposure to road traffic and railway noise was calculated for all historical addresses for 10 years preceding the SF-36, using the Nordic prediction method. Associations between noise exposure and SF-36 summary scales and the eight sub-scales were calculated using general linear models, adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic status, and lifestyle. Results Models adjusted for age, sex and socioeconomic factors showed that a 10 dB higher road traffic noise 1 year preceding SF-36 assessment was associated with a 0.14 lower mental component summary (MCS) score (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.26, -0.01). However, further adjustment for lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol, and waist circumference) attenuated the association: (-0.08 (95% CI: -0.20, 0.04)). Exposure to more than 55 dB of railway noise in the same time period was borderline significantly associated with lower MCS. The physical component summary was not associated with traffic noise. Conclusion The present study suggests a weak association between traffic noise exposure and the mental health component score of SF-36, which may operate through lifestyle. The magnitude of effect was, however, not clinically relevant."

The degree of endolymphatic hydrops was rated semi-quantitatively and compared to the results of 3D-volumetry. Moreover, the grade of endolymphatic hydrops was correlated with pure tone audiometry. Semi-quantitative grading and volumetric evaluation of the endolymphatic hydrops are in accordance (r = 0.92) and the grade of endolymphatic hydrops correlates with pure tone audiometry. Patients with a sickness duration of ≥ 30 months showed a significant higher total labyrinth fluid volume (p = 0.03). Fast, semi-quantitative evaluation of endolymphatic hydrops is highly reliable compared to quantitative/volumetric assessment.

Extraversion and Agreeableness are personality traits designed to measure individual differences in social-cognitive functioning, however each trait-dimension includes elements that represent interpersonal social functioning and elements that do not represent interpersonal social functioning. We tested the prediction that interpersonal elements of Extraversion (Warmth) and Agreeableness (Altruism) are associated with empathy and non-interpersonal elements of Extraversion and Agreeableness are not associated with empathy. We quantified empathic processing behaviorally (empathic accuracy task using video vignettes) and within the brain (fMRI and an emotional perspective taking task) in 50 healthy subjects. Converging evidence shows that highly warm and altruistic people are well skilled in recognizing the emotional states of other people and exhibit greater activity in brain regions important for empathy (temporoparietal junction and medial prefrontal cortex) during emotional perspective taking. A mediation analysis further supported the association between warm-altruistic personality and empathic processing; indicating that one reason why highly warm-altruistic individuals may be skilled empathizers is that they engage the temporoparietal junction and medial prefrontal cortex more. Together, these findings advance the way the behavioral and neural basis of empathy is understood and demonstrates the efficacy of personality scales to measure individual differences in interpersonal social function."
https://openalex.org/W2024939951,"Members of the heterochromatin protein 1 family (HP1α, β and γ) are mostly associated with heterochromatin and play important roles in gene regulation and DNA damage response. Altered expression of individual HP1 subtype has profound impacts on cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. We analyzed the expression profile of HP1 family by data mining using a published microarray data set coupled with retrospective immunohistochemistry analyses of archived breast cancer biospecimens. We found that the patient group overexpressing HP1β mRNA is associated with poorly differentiated breast tumors and with a significantly lower survival rate. Immunohistochemical staining against HP1α, HP1β and HP1γ shows that respective HP1 expression level is frequently altered in breast cancers. 57.4 - 60.1% of samples examined showed high HP1β expression and 39.9 - 42.6 % of examined tumors showed no or low expression of each HP1 subtype. Interestingly, comparative analysis on HP1 expression profile and breast cancer markers revealed a positive correlation between the respective expression level of all three HP1 subtypes and Ki-67, a cell proliferation and well-known breast cancer marker. To explore the effect of individual HP1 on PARP inhibitor therapy for breast cancer, MCF7 breast cancer cells and individually HP1-depleted MCF7 cells were treated with PARP inhibitor ABT-888 with or without carboplatin. Notably, HP1β-knockdown cells are hypersensitive to the PARP inhibitor ABT-888 alone and its combination with carboplatin. In summary, while increased HP1β expression is associated with the poor prognosis in breast cancer, compromised HP1β abundance may serve as a useful predictive marker for chemotherapy, including PARP inhibitors against breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2025723496,"Objectives Aspiration of the lower airways due to foreign body is rare in adults. This study aimed to determine the outcome of patients who received flexible bronchoscopy with different modalities for foreign body removal in the lower airways. Patients and Methods Between January 2003 and January 2014, 94 patients diagnosed with foreign body in the lower airways underwent flexible bronchoscopy with different modalities, which included forceps, loop, basket, knife, electromagnet, and cryotherapy. The clinical presentation, foreign body location and characteristics, and applications of flexible bronchoscopy were analyzed. Results Forty (43%) patients had acute aspiration, which developed within one week of foreign body entry and 54 (57%) had chronic aspiration. The most common foreign bodies were teeth or bone. More patients with chronic aspiration than those with acute aspiration were referred from the out-patient clinic (48% vs. 28%), but more patients with acute aspiration were referred from the emergency room (35% vs. 6%) and intensive care unit (18% vs. 2%). Flexible bronchoscopy with different modalities was used to remove the foreign bodies (85/94, 90%). Electromagnet or cryotherapy was used in nine patients to eliminate the surrounding granulation tissue before foreign body removal. In the nine patients with failed flexible bronchoscopy, eight underwent rigid bronchoscopy instead and one had right lower lung lobectomy for lung abscess. Conclusions Flexible bronchoscopy with multiple modalities is effective for diagnosing and removing foreign bodies in the lower respiratory airways in adults, with a high success rate (90%) and no difference between acute and chronic aspirations."
https://openalex.org/W2075986099,"Development of hydrocarbon resources across northwest Canada has spurred economic prosperity and generated concerns over impacts to biodiversity. To balance these interests, numerous jurisdictions have adopted management thresholds that allow for limited energy development but minimize undesirable impacts to wildlife. Used for exploration, seismic lines are the most abundant linear feature in the boreal forest and exist at a variety of widths and recovery states. We used American marten (Martes americana) as a model species to measure how line attributes influence species’ response to seismic lines, and asked whether responses to individual lines trigger population impacts. Marten response to seismic lines was strongly influenced by line width and recovery state. Compared to forest interiors, marten used open seismic lines ≥ 3 m wide less often, but used open lines ≤ 2 m wide and partially recovered lines ≥ 6 m wide similarly. Marten response to individual line types appeared to trigger population impacts. The probability of occurrence at the home range scale declined with increasing seismic line density, and the inclusion of behavioral response to line density calculations improved model fit. In our top performing model, we excluded seismic lines ≤ 2 m from our calculation of line density, and the probability of occurrence declined > 80% between home ranges with the lowest and highest line densities. Models that excluded seismic lines did not strongly explain occurrence. We show how wildlife-derived metrics can inform regulatory guidelines to increase the likelihood those guidelines meet intended management objectives. With respect to marten, not all seismic lines constitute disturbances, but avoidance of certain line types scales to population impacts. This approach provides the ecological context required to understand cause and effect relationships among socio-economic and ecological conservation goals."
https://openalex.org/W2028706047,"In human IVF procedures objective and reliable biomarkers of oocyte and embryo quality are needed in order to increase the use of single embryo transfer (SET) and thus prevent multiple pregnancies. During folliculogenesis there is an intense bi-directional communication between oocyte and follicular cells. For this reason gene expression profile of follicular cells could be an important indicator and biomarker of oocyte and embryo quality. The objective of this study was to identify gene expression signature(s) in human granulosa (GC) and cumulus (CC) cells predictive of successful embryo implantation and oocyte fertilization. Forty-one patients were included in the study and individual GC and CC samples were collected; oocytes were cultivated separately, allowing a correlation with IVF outcome and elective SET was performed. Gene expression analysis was performed using microarrays, followed by a quantitative real-time PCR validation. After statistical analysis of microarray data, there were no significantly differentially expressed genes (FDR<0,05) between non-fertilized and fertilized oocytes and non-implanted and implanted embryos in either of the cell type. Furthermore, the results of quantitative real-time PCR were in consent with microarray data as there were no significant differences in gene expression of genes selected for validation. In conclusion, we did not find biomarkers for prediction of oocyte fertilization and embryo implantation in IVF procedures in the present study."
https://openalex.org/W2082138819,"If one nondescript object's volume is twice that of another, is it necessarily twice as heavy? As larger objects are typically heavier than smaller ones, one might assume humans use such heuristics in preparing to lift novel objects if other informative cues (e.g., material, previous lifts) are unavailable. However, it is also known that humans are sensitive to statistical properties of our environments, and that such sensitivity can bias perception. Here we asked whether statistical regularities in properties of liftable, everyday objects would bias human observers' predictions about objects' weight relationships. We developed state-of-the-art computer vision techniques to precisely measure the volume of everyday objects, and also measured their weight. We discovered that for liftable man-made objects, ""twice as large"" doesn't mean ""twice as heavy"": Smaller objects are typically denser, following a power function of volume. Interestingly, this ""smaller is denser"" relationship does not hold for natural or unliftable objects, suggesting some ideal density range for objects designed to be lifted. We then asked human observers to predict weight relationships between novel objects without lifting them; crucially, these weight predictions quantitatively match typical weight relationships shown by similarly-sized objects in everyday environments. These results indicate that the human brain represents the statistics of everyday objects and that this representation can be quantitatively abstracted and applied to novel objects. Finally, that the brain possesses and can use precise knowledge of the nonlinear association between size and weight carries important implications for implementation of forward models of motor control in artificial systems."
https://openalex.org/W2043829622,"Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) is now globally used for accurate analysis of transcripts levels in plants. For reliable quantification of transcripts, identification of the best reference genes is a prerequisite in qRT-PCR analysis. Recently, Withania somnifera has attracted lot of attention due to its immense therapeutic potential. At present, biotechnological intervention for the improvement of this plant is being seriously pursued. In this background, it is important to have comprehensive studies on finding suitable reference genes for this high valued medicinal plant. In the present study, 11 candidate genes were evaluated for their expression stability under biotic (fungal disease), abiotic (wounding, salt, drought, heat and cold) stresses, in different plant tissues and in response to various plant growth regulators (methyl jasmonate, salicylic acid, abscisic acid). The data as analyzed by various software packages (geNorm, NormFinder, Bestkeeper and ΔCt method) suggested that cyclophilin (CYP) is a most stable gene under wounding, heat, methyl jasmonate, different tissues and all stress conditions. T-SAND was found to be a best reference gene for salt and salicylic acid (SA) treated samples, while 26S ribosomal RNA (26S), ubiquitin (UBQ) and beta-tubulin (TUB) were the most stably expressed genes under drought, biotic and cold treatment respectively. For abscisic acid (ABA) treated samples 18S-rRNA was found to stably expressed gene. Finally, the relative expression level of the three genes involved in the withanolide biosynthetic pathway was detected to validate the selection of reliable reference genes. The present work will significantly contribute to gene analysis studies in W. somnifera and facilitate in improving the quality of gene expression data in this plant as well as and other related plant species."
https://openalex.org/W2016837439,"In the present study, five loci (mitochondrial and nuclear) were sequenced to determine the genetic diversity, population structure, and demographic history of populations of the yellowtail snapper, Ocyurus chrysurus, found along the coast of the western South Atlantic. O. chrysurus is a lutjanid species that is commonly associated with coral reefs and exhibits an ample geographic distribution, and it can therefore be considered a good model for the investigation of phylogeographic patterns and genetic connectivity in marine environments. The results reflected a marked congruence between the mitochondrial and nuclear markers as well as intense gene flow among the analyzed populations, which represent a single genetic stock along the entire coast of Brazil between the states of Pará and Espírito Santo. Our data also showed high levels of genetic diversity in the species (mainly mtDNA), as well a major historic population expansion, which most likely coincided with the sea level oscillations at the end of the Pleistocene. In addition, this species is intensively exploited by commercial fisheries, and data on the genetic structure of its populations will be essential for the development of effective conservation and management plans."
https://openalex.org/W2022599515,"Background Ananas comosus var. bracteatus (Red Pineapple) is an important ornamental plant for its colorful leaves and decorative red fruits. Because of its complex genome, it is difficult to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the growth and development. Thus high-throughput transcriptome sequencing of Ananas comosus var. bracteatus is necessary to generate large quantities of transcript sequences for the purpose of gene discovery and functional genomic studies. Results The Ananas comosus var. bracteatus transcriptome was sequenced by the Illumina paired-end sequencing technology. We obtained a total of 23.5 million high quality sequencing reads, 1,555,808 contigs and 41,052 unigenes. In total 41,052 unigenes of Ananas comosus var. bracteatus, 23,275 unigenes were annotated in the NCBI non-redundant protein database and 23,134 unigenes were annotated in the Swiss-Port database. Out of these, 17,748 and 8,505 unigenes were assigned to gene ontology categories and clusters of orthologous groups, respectively. Functional annotation against Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Pathway database identified 5,825 unigenes which were mapped to 117 pathways. The assembly predicted many unigenes that were previously unknown. The annotated unigenes were compared against pineapple, rice, maize, Arabidopsis, and sorghum. Unigenes that did not match any of those five sequence datasets are considered to be Ananas comosus var. bracteatus unique. We predicted unigenes encoding enzymes involved in terpenoid and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Conclusion The sequence data provide the most comprehensive transcriptomic resource currently available for Ananas comosus var. bracteatus. To our knowledge; this is the first report on the de novo transcriptome sequencing of the Ananas comosus var. bracteatus. Unigenes obtained in this study, may help improve future gene expression, genetic and genomics studies in Ananas comosus var. bracteatus."
https://openalex.org/W2023509750,"Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a bioactive lipid that enhances ovarian cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro and stimulates peritoneal metastasis in vivo. LPA is generated through the action of autotaxin or phospholipases, and degradation begins with lipid phosphate phosphohydrolase (LPP)-dependent removal of the phosphate. While the effects of LPA on ovarian cancer progression are clear, the effects of LPA metabolism within the tumor microenvironment on peritoneal metastasis have not been reported. We examined the contribution of lipid phosphatase activity to ovarian cancer peritoneal metastasis using mice deficient in LPP1 expression. Homozygous deletion of LPP1 (LPP1 KO) results in elevated levels and decreased turnover of LPA in vivo. Within 2 weeks of intraperitoneal injection of syngeneic mouse ovarian cancer cells, we observed enhanced tumor seeding in the LPP1 KO mice compared to wild type. However, tumor growth plateaued in the LPP1 KO mice by 3 weeks while tumors continued to grow in wild type mice. The decreased tumor burden was accompanied by increased apoptosis and no change in proliferation or angiogenesis. Tumor growth was restored and apoptosis reversed with exogenous administration of LPA. Together, these observations demonstrate that the elevated levels of LPA per se in LPP1 KO mice do not inhibit tumor growth. Rather, the data support the notion that either elevated LPA concentration or altered LPA metabolism affects other growth-promoting contributions of the tumor microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W1990233571,"Increased levels of a soluble form of endoglin (sEng) circulating in plasma have been detected in various pathological conditions related to cardiovascular system. High concentration of sEng was also proposed to contribute to the development of endothelial dysfunction, but there is no direct evidence to support this hypothesis. Therefore, in the present work we analyzed whether high sEng levels induce endothelial dysfunction in aorta by using transgenic mice with high expression of human sEng. Transgenic mice with high expression of human sEng on CBAxC57Bl/6J background (Sol-Eng+) and age-matched transgenic littermates that do not develop high levels of human soluble endoglin (control animals in this study) on chow diet were used. As expected, male and female Sol-Eng+ transgenic mice showed higher levels of plasma concentrations of human sEng as well as increased blood arterial pressure, as compared to control animals. Functional analysis either in vivo or ex vivo in isolated aorta demonstrated that the endothelium-dependent vascular function was similar in Sol-Eng+ and control mice. In addition, Western blot analysis showed no differences between Sol-Eng+ and control mice in the protein expression levels of endoglin, endothelial NO-synthase (eNOS) and pro-inflammatory ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 from aorta. Our results demonstrate that high levels of soluble endoglin alone do not induce endothelial dysfunction in Sol-Eng+ mice. However, these data do not rule out the possibility that soluble endoglin might contribute to alteration of endothelial function in combination with other risk factors related to cardiovascular disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2060003280,"Nature reserves are widely considered as one available strategy for protecting biodiversity, which is threatened by habitat fragmentation, and wildlife extinction. The Chinese government has established a goal of protecting 15% of its land area by 2015. We quantitated the characteristics and distribution of nature reserves in mainland China and evaluated the expansion process for national nature reserves. National nature reserves occupy 64.15% of the total area of nature reserves. Steppe and meadow ecosystem, ocean and seacoast ecosystem, and wild plant nature reserves represent lower percentages, particularly in national nature reserves, in which they comprised 0.76%, 0.54%, and 0.69%, respectively, of the area. Furthermore, medium and small nature reserves compose 92.32% of all nature reserves. The land area under any legal protection has reached 14.80%, although only 9.78% is strictly protected. However, if 9 super-large national nature reserves, located in Southwest and Northwest China were removed, the percentage of strictly protected area decreases to 2.66% of the land area of China. The areas contained in nature reserves in each province are not proportional to the areas of the provinces, particularly for national nature reserves, with higher protection rates in Southwest and Northwest China than in other regions. Of the 31 provinces, 22 provinces feature strict protection of less than 4% of their areas by national nature reserves; these provinces are mainly located in East, Central, South, and North China. Moreover, the unevenness indexes of the distribution of nature reserves and national nature reserves are 0.39 and 0.58, respectively. The construction of nature reserves has entered a steady development stage after a period of rapid expansion in mainland China. In recent years, the total area of national nature reserves has increased slowly, while the total area of nature reserves has not increased, although the number of nature reserves continues increase."
https://openalex.org/W2088896312,"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized clinically by impairments in social interaction and verbal and non-verbal communication skills as well as restricted interests and repetitive behavior. It has been hypothesized that altered brain environment including an imbalance in neurotrophic support during early development contributes to the pathophysiology of autism. Here we report that sera from children with autism which exhibited abnormal levels of various neurotrophic factors induced cell death and oxidative stress in mouse primary cultured cortical neurons. The effects of sera from autistic children were rescued by pre-treatment with a ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) small peptide mimetic, Peptide 6 (P6), which was previously shown to exert its neuroprotective effect by modulating CNTF/JAK/STAT pathway and LIF signaling and by enhancing brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression. Similar neurotoxic effects and neuroinflammation were observed in young Wistar rats injected intracerebroventricularly with autism sera within hours after birth. The autism sera injected rats demonstrated developmental delay and deficits in social communication, interaction, and novelty. Both the neurobiological changes and the behavioral autistic phenotype were ameliorated by P6 treatment. These findings implicate the involvement of neurotrophic imbalance during early brain development in the pathophysiology of autism and a proof of principle of P6 as a potential therapeutic strategy for autism."
https://openalex.org/W1984876200,"This study proposes a novel adaptive mesh expansion model (AMEM) for liver segmentation from computed tomography images. The virtual deformable simplex model (DSM) is introduced to represent the mesh, in which the motion of each vertex can be easily manipulated. The balloon, edge, and gradient forces are combined with the binary image to construct the external force of the deformable model, which can rapidly drive the DSM to approach the target liver boundaries. Moreover, tangential and normal forces are combined with the gradient image to control the internal force, such that the DSM degree of smoothness can be precisely controlled. The triangular facet of the DSM is adaptively decomposed into smaller triangular components, which can significantly improve the segmentation accuracy of the irregularly sharp corners of the liver. The proposed method is evaluated on the basis of different criteria applied to 10 clinical data sets. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed AMEM algorithm is effective and robust and thus outperforms six other up-to-date algorithms. Moreover, AMEM can achieve a mean overlap error of 6.8% and a mean volume difference of 2.7%, whereas the average symmetric surface distance and the root mean square symmetric surface distance can reach 1.3 mm and 2.7 mm, respectively."

Furthermore, drinking alcohol in a binge-like pattern is now recognized as a national problem, leading to a greater likelihood of being injured. Our objective was to determine the consequences of a binge paradigm of alcohol intoxication at the time of TBI on long-term functional outcome using a sensitive test of sensorimotor function. We trained adult, male, Sprague Dawley rats on the skilled forelimb reaching task and then administered a single binge dose of ethanol (2g/kg, i.p.) or saline for three consecutive days (for a total of 3 doses). One hour after the final ethanol dose, rats underwent a TBI to the sensorimotor cortex corresponding to the preferred reaching forelimb. Animals were then tested for seven weeks on the skilled forelimb reaching task to assess the profile of recovery. We found that the group given ethanol prior to TBI displayed a slower recovery curve with a lower recovery plateau as compared to the control group. Therefore, even a relatively short (3 day) episode of binge alcohol exposure can negatively impact long-term recovery from a TBI, underscoring this significant public health problem."
https://openalex.org/W2041201201,"The genome assembly of southern house mosquito Cx. quinquefasciatus is represented by a high number of supercontigs with no order or orientation on the chromosomes. Although cytogenetic maps for the polytene chromosomes of this mosquito have been developed, their utilization for the genome mapping remains difficult because of the low number of high-quality spreads in chromosome preparations. Therefore, a simple and robust mitotic-chromosome-based approach for the genome mapping of Cx. quinquefasciatus still needs to be developed. In this study, we performed physical mapping of 37 genomic supercontigs using fluorescent in situ hybridization on mitotic chromosomes from imaginal discs of 4th instar larvae. The genetic linkage map nomenclature was adopted for the chromosome numbering based on the direct positioning of 58 markers that were previously genetically mapped. The smallest, largest, and intermediate chromosomes were numbered as 1, 2, and 3, respectively. For idiogram development, we analyzed and described in detail the morphology and proportions of the mitotic chromosomes. Chromosomes were subdivided into 19 divisions and 72 bands of four different intensities. These idiograms were used for mapping the genomic supercontigs/genetic markers. We also determined the presence of length polymorphism in the q arm of sex-determining chromosome 1 in Cx. quinquefasciatus related to the size of ribosomal locus. Our physical mapping and previous genetic linkage mapping resulted in the chromosomal assignment of 13% of the total genome assembly to the chromosome bands. We provided the first detailed description, nomenclature, and idiograms for the mitotic chromosomes of Cx. quinquefasciatus. Further application of the approach developed in this study will help to improve the quality of the southern house mosquito genome."
https://openalex.org/W2065609229,"An eggshell is a porous microstructure that regulates the passage of gases to allow respiration. The chick embryo and its circulatory system enclosed by the eggshell has become an important model for biomedical research such as the control of angiogenesis, cancer therapy, and drug delivery test, because the use of embryo is ethically acceptable and it is inexpensive and small. However, chick embryo and extra-embryonic blood vessels cannot be accessed freely and has poor observability because the eggshell is tough and cannot be seen through, which limits its application. In this study, a novel artificial eggshell with functionalized surface is proposed, which allows the total amount of oxygen to pass into the egg for the chick embryo culturing and has high observability and accessibility for embryo manipulation. First, a 40-mm enclosed cubic-shaped eggshell consisting of a membrane structure and a rigid frame structure is designed, and then the threshold of the membrane thickness suitable for the embryo survival is figured out according to the oxygen-permeability of the membrane structure. The designed artificial eggshell was actually fabricated by using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and polycarbonate (PC) in the current study. Using the fabricated eggshell, chick embryo and extra-embryonic blood vessels can be observed from multiple directions. To test the effectiveness of the design, the cubic eggshells were used to culture chick embryos and survivability was confirmed when PDMS membranes with adequate oxygen permeability were used. Since the surface of the eggshell is transparent, chick embryo tissue development could be observed during the culture period. Additionally, the chick embryo tissues could be accessed and manipulated from outside the cubic eggshell, by using mechanical tools without breakage of the eggshell. The proposed “Egg-in-Cube” with functionalized surface has great potential to serve as a promising platform for biomedical research."
https://openalex.org/W2040251943,"While intercellular communication processes are frequently characterized by switch-like transitions, the endocrine system, including the adipose tissue response to insulin, has been characterized by graded responses. Yet here individual cells from adipose tissue biopsies are best described by a switch-like transition between the basal and insulin-stimulated states for the trafficking of the glucose transporter GLUT4. Two statistically-defined populations best describe the observed cellular heterogeneity, representing the fractions of refractive and responsive adipose cells. Furthermore, subjects exhibiting high systemic insulin sensitivity indices (SI) have high fractions of responsive adipose cells in vitro, while subjects exhibiting decreasing SI have increasing fractions of refractory cells in vitro. Thus, a two-component model best describes the relationship between cellular refractory fraction and subject SI. Since isolated cells exhibit these different response characteristics in the presence of constant culture conditions and milieu, we suggest that a physiological switching mechanism at the adipose cellular level ultimately drives systemic SI."
https://openalex.org/W2041588894,"Background It is important to have methods available to estimate the number of people who have undiagnosed HIV and are in need of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Methods The method uses the concept that a predictable level of occurrence of AIDS or other HIV-related clinical symptoms which lead to presentation for care, and hence diagnosis of HIV, arises in undiagnosed people with a given CD4 count. The method requires surveillance data on numbers of new HIV diagnoses with HIV-related symptoms, and the CD4 count at diagnosis. The CD4 count-specific rate at which HIV-related symptoms develop are estimated from cohort data. 95% confidence intervals can be constructed using a simple simulation method. Results For example, if there were 13 HIV diagnoses with HIV-related symptoms made in one year with CD4 count at diagnosis between 150–199 cells/mm3, then since the CD4 count-specific rate of HIV-related symptoms is estimated as 0.216 per person-year, the estimated number of person years lived in people with undiagnosed HIV with CD4 count 150–199 cells/mm3 is 13/0.216 = 60 (95% confidence interval: 29–100), which is considered an estimate of the number of people living with undiagnosed HIV in this CD4 count stratum. Conclusions The method is straightforward to implement within a short period once a surveillance system of all new HIV diagnoses, collecting data on HIV-related symptoms at diagnosis, is in place and is most suitable for estimating the number of undiagnosed people with CD4 count <200 cells/mm3 due to the low rate of developing HIV-related symptoms at higher CD4 counts. A potential source of bias is under-diagnosis and under-reporting of diagnoses with HIV-related symptoms. Although this method has limitations as with all approaches, it is important for prompting increased efforts to identify undiagnosed people, particularly those with low CD4 count, and for informing levels of unmet need for ART."

We hypothesised that these complications also increase healthcare utilisation long after the recovery period. Methods This was a prospective, nationwide Swedish population-based cohort study of patients who underwent curatively intended oesophagectomy for cancer in 2001-2005 and survived at least 1 year postoperatively (n = 390). Total days of in-hospitalisation, number of hospitalisations and number of visits to the outpatient clinic within 5 years of surgery were analysed using quasi-Poisson models with adjustment for patient, tumour and treatment characteristics and are expressed as incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results There was an increased in-hospitalisation period 1-5 years after surgery in patients with more than 1 complication (IRR 1.5, 95% CI 1.0-2.4). The IRR for the number of hospitalisations by number of complications was 1.1 (95% CI 0.7-1.6), and 1.2 (95% CI 0.9-1.6) for number of outpatient visits in patients with more than 1 complication. The IRR for in-hospitalisation period 1-5 years following oesophagectomy was 1.8 (95% CI 1.0-3.0) for patients with anastomotic insufficiency and 1.5 (95% CI 0.9-2.5) for patients with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular complications. We found no association with number of hospitalisations (IRR 1.2, 95% CI 0.7-2.0) or number of outpatient visits (IRR 1.3, 95% CI 0.9-1.7) after anastomotic insufficiency, or after cardiovascular or cerebrovascular complications (IRR 1.2, 95% CI 0.7-1.9) and (IRR 1.1, 95% CI 0.8-1.5) respectively. Conclusion This study showed an increased total in-hospitalisation period 1-5 years after oesophagectomy for cancer in patients with postoperative complications, particularly following anastomotic insufficiency."

In this study, the relative concentration of ethanol and other odorous compounds emitted from the working surface at a landfill in China was analyzed. Gas sampling was conducted at the landfill on a number of selected days from March 2012 to March 2014, which represented different periods throughout the two years. A total of 41, 59, 66, 54, 63, 54, 41, and 42 species of odorous compounds were identified and quantified in eight sampling activities, respectively; a number of 86 species of odorous compounds were identified and quantified all together in the study. The measured odorous compounds were classified into six different categories (Oxygenated compounds, Halogenated compounds, Terpenes, Sulfur compounds, Aromatics, and Hydrocarbons). The total average concentrations of the oxygenated compounds, sulfur compounds, aromatics, halogenated compounds, hydrocarbons, and terpenes were 2.450 mg/m3, 0.246 mg/m3, 0.203 mg/m3, 0.319 mg/m3, 0.530 mg/m3, and 0.217 mg/m3, respectively. The relative concentrations of 59 odorous compounds with respect to the concentration of ethyl alcohol (1000 ppm) were determined. The dominant contaminants that cause odor pollution around the landfill are ethyl sulfide, methyl mercaptan, acetaldehyde, and hydrogen sulfide; dimethyl disulfide and dimethyl sulfide also contribute to the pollution to a certain degree."

Previous studies have suggested that iron overload can suppress the generation of a cytotoxic immune response; however, the effect of iron on experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) is yet unknown. Here we determined that the incidence of ECM was markedly reduced in mice treated with iron dextran. Protection was concomitant with a significant decrease in the sequestration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells within the brain. CD4+ T cells demonstrated markedly decreased CXCR3 expression and had reduced IFNγ-responsiveness, as indicated by mitigated expression of IFNγR2 and T-bet. Additional analysis of the splenic cell populations indicated that parenteral iron supplementation was also associated with a decrease in NK cells and increase in regulatory T cells. Altogether, these results suggest that iron is able to inhibit ECM pathology by attenuating the capacity of T cells to migrate to the brain."
https://openalex.org/W1996626041,"Load-depth curves of an unpoled Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) film composite as a function of temperature were measured by nanoindentation technique. Its reduce modulus and hardness were calculated by the typical Oliver-Pharr method. Then the true modulus and hardness of the PZT film were assessed by decoupling the influence of substrate using methods proposed by Zhou et al. and Korsunsky et al., respectively. Results show that the indentation depth and modulus increase, but the hardness decreases at elevated temperature. The increasing of indentation depth and the decreasing of hardness are thought to be caused by the decreasing of the critical stress needed to excite dislocation initiation at high temperature. The increasing of true modulus is attributed to the reducing of recoverable indentation depth induced by back-switched domains. The influence of residual stress on the indentation behavior of PZT film composite was also investigated by measuring its load-depth curves with pre-load strains."

The present study attempts to address these gaps by introducing both plural and past tense production tasks in Hungarian, an agglutinative non-Indo-European language with complex morphology. Here we report results on these tasks from healthy Hungarian native-speaking adults, in whom we examine regular and irregular nominal and verbal inflection in a within-subjects design. Regular and irregular nouns and verbs were stem on frequency, word length, and phonological structure, and both accuracy and response times were acquired. The results revealed that the regular/irregular contrast yields similar patterns in Hungarian, for both nominal and verbal inflection, as in previous studies of non-agglutinative Indo-European languages: the production of irregular inflected forms was both less accurate and slower than of regular forms, both for plural and past-tense inflection. The results replicate and extend previous findings to an agglutinative language with complex morphology. Together with previous studies, the evidence suggests that the regular/irregular distinction yields a basic behavioral pattern that holds across language families and linguistic typologies. Finally, the study sets the stage for further research examining the neurocognitive substrates of regular and irregular morphology in an agglutinative non-Indo-European language."
https://openalex.org/W2075578792,"The goal of this study was to determine quantitative relationships between electrophysiologic parameters and the propensity of cardiac tissue to undergo atrial fibrillation. We used a computational model to simulate episodes of fibrillation, which we then characterized in terms of both their duration and the population dynamics of the electrical waves which drove them. Monte Carlo sampling revealed that episode durations followed an exponential decay distribution and wave population sizes followed a normal distribution. Half-lives of reentrant episodes increased exponentially with either increasing tissue area to boundary length ratio (A/BL) or decreasing action potential duration (APD), resistance (R) or capacitance (C). We found that the qualitative form of fibrillatory activity (e.g., multi-wavelet reentry (MWR) vs. rotors) was dependent on the ratio of resistance and capacitance to APD; MWR was reliably produced below a ratio of 0.18. We found that a composite of these electrophysiologic parameters, which we term the fibrillogenicity index (Fb = A/(BL*APD*R*C)), reliably predicted the duration of MWR episodes (r2 = 0.93). Given that some of the quantities comprising Fb are amenable to manipulation (via either pharmacologic treatment or catheter ablation), these findings provide a theoretical basis for the development of titrated therapies of atrial fibrillation."
https://openalex.org/W2035758262,"Manipulation of gene expression to invoke loss of function (LoF) or gain of function (GoF) phenotypes is important for interrogating complex biological questions both in vitro and in vivo. Doxycycline (Dox)-inducible gene expression systems are commonly used although success is often limited by high background and insufficient sensitivity to Dox. Here we develop broadly applicable platforms for reliable, tightly controlled and reversible Dox-inducible systems for lentiviral mediated generation of cell lines or FLP Recombination-Mediated Cassette Exchange (RMCE) into the Collagen 1a1 (Col1a1) locus (FLP-In Col1a1) in mouse embryonic stem cells. We significantly improve the flexibility, usefulness and robustness of the Dox-inducible system by using Tetracycline (Tet) activator (Tet-On) variants which are more sensitive to Dox, have no background activity and are expressed from single Gateway-compatible constructs. We demonstrate the usefulness of these platforms in ectopic gene expression or gene knockdown in multiple cell lines, primary neurons and in FLP-In Col1a1 mouse embryonic stem cells. We also improve the flexibility of RMCE Dox-inducible systems by generating constructs that allow for tissue or cell type-specific Dox-inducible expression and generate a shRNA selection algorithm that can effectively predict potent shRNA sequences able to knockdown gene expression from single integrant constructs. These platforms provide flexible, reliable and broadly applicable inducible expression systems for studying gene function."
