Trem2 deletion has revealed protective Trem2 functions in preclinical models of β-amyloidosis, a prominent feature of pre-diagnosis AD stages. How TREM2 influences later AD stages characterized by tau-mediated neurodegeneration is unclear. To understand Trem2 function in the context of both β-amyloid and tau pathologies, we examined Trem2 deficiency in the pR5-183 mouse model expressing mutant tau alone or in TauPS2APP mice, in which β-amyloid pathology exacerbates tau pathology and neurodegeneration. Single-cell RNA sequencing in these models revealed robust disease-associated microglia (DAM) activation in TauPS2APP mice that was amyloid-dependent and Trem2-dependent. In the presence of β-amyloid pathology, Trem2 deletion further exacerbated tau accumulation and spreading and promoted brain atrophy. Without β-amyloid pathology, Trem2 deletion did not affect these processes. Therefore, TREM2 may slow AD progression and reduce tau-driven neurodegeneration by restricting the degree to which β-amyloid facilitates the spreading of pathogenic tau.

TREM2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2) is an activating immune cell receptor expressed in the brain specifically by microglia (Hickman et al., 2013Hickman S.E. Kingery N.D.

Since the discovery of TREM2 mutations as risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Guerreiro et al., 2013Guerreiro R. Wojtas A. Bras J. Carrasquillo M. Rogaeva E. Majounie E. Cruchaga C. Sassi C.

Med. 2013; 368: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar), numerous studies have been performed in various mouse models to understand how Trem2 influences the development of hallmark AD pathologies, namely, β-amyloid plaques and phosphorylated aggregates of the tau protein. For both types of pathology, contrasting results have been reported regarding the effects of Trem2 deletion. Exactly how the appearance and accumulation of plaque are altered in Trem2-deficient mice may depend on age, sex, brain region, model, and detection method (Jay et al., 2015Jay T.R. Miller C.M.

However, an emerging consensus is that β-amyloid plaques have a less compacted morphology and are more damaging to surrounding neurites when Trem2 function is impaired (Meilandt et al., 2020Meilandt W.J.

In diverse tau models, Trem2 loss-of-function studies have yielded more disparate results. The hTau model harbors a human chromosomal fragment containing the entire MAPT gene, from which human tau protein is expressed in the background of murine Mapt deficiency (Andorfer et al., 2003Andorfer C. Kress Y. Espinoza M. de Silva R. Tucker K.L. Barde Y.A. Duff K. Davies P. Hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of tau in mice expressing normal human tau isoforms.J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 582-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Trem2 deletion in the hTau model was detrimental at an early disease stage, showing exacerbated tau phosphorylation and aggregation (Bemiller et al., 2017Bemiller S.M. McCray T.J. Allan K. Formica S.V. Xu G. Wilson G. Kokiko-Cochran O.N. Crish S.D. Lasagna-Reeves C.A. Ransohoff R.M. et al.TREM2 deficiency exacerbates tau pathology through dysregulated kinase signaling in a mouse model of tauopathy.Mol. Neurodegener. 2017; 12: 74Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Later stages involving neurodegeneration and brain atrophy were not reported. In the more aggressive PS19 model with transgenic expression of a human tau isoform harboring the P301S mutation (Yoshiyama et al., 2007Yoshiyama Y. Higuchi M. Zhang B. Huang S.M. Iwata N. Saido T.C. Maeda J. Suhara T. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Synapse loss and microglial activation precede tangles in a P301S tauopathy mouse model.Neuron. 2007; 53: 337-351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar), Trem2 deletion showed a protective effect at a late stage, curbing synapse loss in the hippocampus and neurodegenerative atrophy in the entorhinal and piriform cortices without altering tau phosphorylation or aggregation (Leyns et al., 2017Leyns C.E.G. Ulrich J.D. Finn M.B. Stewart F.R. Koscal L.J. Remolina Serrano J. Robinson G.O. Anderson E. Colonna M. Holtzman D.M. TREM2 deficiency attenuates neuroinflammation and protects against neurodegeneration in a mouse model of tauopathy.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A. 2017; 114: 11524-11529Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Whether Trem2 deletion affected tau pathology in pre-degenerative disease stages was not reported. Another study in the PS19 model reported that heterozygous but not homozygous Trem2 deletion exacerbated tau phosphorylation and aggregation (Sayed et al., 2018Sayed F.A. Telpoukhovskaia M. Kodama L. Li Y. Zhou Y. Le D. Hauduc A. Ludwig C. Gao F. Clelland C. et al.Differential effects of partial and complete loss of TREM2 on microglial injury response and tauopathy.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A. 2018; 115: 10172-10177Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Finally, in a recently developed model in which pathological tau proteins prepared from human AD brains are injected into mouse brains that harbor β-amyloid pathology (He et al., 2018He Z. Guo J.L. McBride J.D. Narasimhan S. Kim H. Changolkar L. Zhang B. Gathagan R.J. Yue C. Dengler C. et al.Amyloid-β plaques enhance Alzheimer’s brain tau-seeded pathologies by facilitating neuritic plaque tau aggregation.Nat. Med. 2018; 24: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), Trem2 deletion led to increased abundance of phospho-tau-positive dystrophic neurites surrounding plaques (Leyns et al., 2019Leyns C.E.G. Gratuze M. Narasimhan S. Jain N. Koscal L.J. Jiang H. Manis M. Colonna M. Lee V.M.Y. Ulrich J.D. Holtzman D.M. TREM2 function impedes tau seeding in neuritic plaques.Nat. Neurosci. 2019; 22: 1217-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Later events such as neurofibrillary tangle formation in neuronal cell bodies and eventual neurodegeneration were not reported. Collectively, these studies may suggest that microglial Trem2 activity helps restrain accumulation of tau pathology in early stages but contributes to tau-mediated neurodegeneration during later stages of tauopathy. To gain a comprehensive understanding of Trem2 function in a slowly developing tauopathy model at both early and degenerative stages of disease and in the presence or absence of β-amyloid pathology, we crossed Trem2-deficient mice with the pR5-183 line expressing P301L mutant tau protein (Götz et al., 2001Götz J. Chen F. Barmettler R. Nitsch R.M. Tau filament formation in transgenic mice expressing P301L tau.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 529-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), alone or in combination with the PS2APP transgene (Ozmen et al., 2009Ozmen L. Albientz A. Czech C. Jacobsen H. Expression of transgenic APP mRNA is the key determinant for beta-amyloid deposition in PS2APP transgenic mice.Neurodegener. Dis. 2009; 6: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), which drives β-amyloid production and has been described to enhance phospho-tau accumulation when the two transgenes are combined in the TauPS2APP model (Grueninger et al., 2010Grueninger F. Bohrmann B. Czech C. Ballard T.M. Frey J.R. Weidensteiner C. von Kienlin M. Ozmen L. Phosphorylation of tau at S422 is enhanced by Abeta in TauPS2APP triple transgenic mice.Neurobiol. Dis. 2010; 37: 294-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We analyzed the effects of Trem2 deletion in P301L mice at 6, 10, and 18 months of age and in TauPS2APP mice at 9 and 17 months of age, including both sexes of mice in both models at all ages. We observed that Trem2 deletion exacerbated the spreading of tau pathology at an early age and promoted brain atrophy at a later age in the TauPS2APP model but had no effect in P301L alone. Thus, our results indicate that in a pure tauopathy setting, TREM2 function may be neither protective nor detrimental. However, in the context of β-amyloid-enhanced accumulation and spreading of tau—an essential aspect of AD pathogenesis in the cerebral cortex—microglial TREM2 activity may protect against both the accumulation of tau pathology and subsequent tau-mediated neurodegeneration. To define interactions between β-amyloid and tau pathologies in our chosen transgenic models, we crossed the PS2APP and pR5-183 mouse lines to generate hemizygous carriers of the tau P301L transgene either alone (P301Lhemi) or combined with homozygous PS2APP transgene (P301Lhemi;PS2APPhomo mice, known as TauPS2APP). Similar to previous findings (Grueninger et al., 2010Grueninger F. Bohrmann B. Czech C. Ballard T.M. Frey J.R. Weidensteiner C. von Kienlin M. Ozmen L. Phosphorylation of tau at S422 is enhanced by Abeta in TauPS2APP triple transgenic mice.Neurobiol. Dis. 2010; 37: 294-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), we observed that the PS2APP background significantly accelerated the appearance of tau pathology, particularly in the hippocampus but also in the cortex. In the P301Lhemi hippocampus, phospho-tau immunostaining was detected in CA1/subiculum neurons by 4.5 months and progressed toward the CA1/CA3 border with age, also becoming prominent by the age of 9 months in mossy fiber axons extending from the dentate to CA3. These patterns, as well as the notable accumulation of phospho-tau-positive cell bodies in CA1, were intensified in TauPS2APP mice compared with P301Lhemi littermate animals that lacked the PS2APP transgene (Figures 1A and 1B ). From the same 9-month animals, we also prepared cortical and hippocampal lysates and fractionated them to quantify tau protein aggregates in the “P2” insoluble fraction using western blotting (see STAR methods; Figure S6D). In P2 fractions from TauPS2APP mice, we observed an abundance of hyperphosphorylated human tau species with slower gel mobility in both hippocampus and cortex, whereas these phospho-tau species were much less detectable in P2 fractions from littermate P301Lhemi brains of the same age (Figures 1C–1E). Moreover, in hippocampal P2 fractions from TauPS2APP mice, we also observed hyperphosphorylated murine tau, which was not apparent in P301Lhemi hippocampal P2 fractions at this age (Figures 1C, S6C, and S6D). We have previously attempted to detect phosphorylated murine tau in the PS2APP model using the AT8 and anti-pT212/pS214 antibodies, with no success using immunostaining or western blot even at advanced ages beyond 18 months (unpublished data). Therefore, the conversion of murine tau to the hyperphosphorylated, insoluble form seen in the TauPS2APP model required the presence of both β-amyloid pathology and “seeding” activity by pathological human tau protein. In contrast to the exacerbation of tau pathology in TauPS2APP mice, the presence of tau pathology had no impact on the extent of β-amyloid pathology when we compared TauPS2APP and PS2APP mice (Table S1), again similar to previous findings in these models (Grueninger et al., 2010Grueninger F. Bohrmann B. Czech C. Ballard T.M. Frey J.R. Weidensteiner C. von Kienlin M. Ozmen L. Phosphorylation of tau at S422 is enhanced by Abeta in TauPS2APP triple transgenic mice.Neurobiol. Dis. 2010; 37: 294-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We also measured hippocampal volume longitudinally using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a separate cohort of littermate animals. Whereas non-transgenic (Ntg), PS2APP, and P301Lhemi mice all displayed age-related increases in hippocampal volume over the age span of 4.5–9 months, this increase did not extend beyond 6 months in TauPS2APP mice (Figure 1F). Thus, hippocampal atrophy was measurable by 9 months of age in brains that harbored both amyloid and tau pathologies, but not in brains that harbored only one or the other. Altogether, these results agree with other disease models of combined amyloid and tau pathologies in which the presence of amyloid pathology exacerbates the development of tau pathology (Bennett et al., 2017Bennett R.E.

More importantly, they align with clinical and histopathological measurements which identify β-amyloid pathology in the neocortex as a key factor in enabling or accelerating the development of neocortical tau pathology (Jack and Holtzman, 2013Jack Jr., C.R.

Med. 2016; 8: 595-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar). We have previously observed with the pR5-183 line that homozygous carriers of the tau P301L transgene (P301Lhomo mice) accumulate tau pathology more rapidly than P301Lhemi mice and that hippocampal degeneration in P301Lhomo mice can be detected on MRI as volumetric reductions from the age of 12 months onward (data not shown). Because the extent of tau pathology and timing of neurodegeneration in the TauPS2APP (P301Lhemi;PS2APPhomo) and P301Lhomo models are somewhat similar, with both being accelerated relative to P301Lhemi mice, the remainder of this paper features TauPS2APP mice alongside P301Lhomo mice in order to compare and contrast microglial activation states and the effects of Trem2 knockout (Trem2ko) on tau pathology at various disease stages, in either the presence or the absence of β-amyloid pathology. In mouse β-amyloidosis models, microglia proliferate and undergo considerable transcriptional modulation, accounting for the majority of changes in transcript abundance measured in whole-tissue brain RNA (Holtman et al., 2015Holtman I.R.

Changes in microglial gene expression are driven predominantly by the appearance of a population of so-called disease-associated microglia (DAM) (Deczkowska et al., 2018Deczkowska A. Keren-Shaul H.

To determine whether and to what degree DAM occur in response to tau or combined tau and amyloid pathologies, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) using hippocampi from aged (19–22 months) P301Lhomo, TauPS2APP, TauPS2APP;Trem2ko, or control (Ntg and Trem2ko) mice. The transcription inhibitor actinomycin D was included during cell dissociation to inhibit transcription and minimize the occurrence of artifactual changes in gene expression (Haimon et al., 2018Haimon Z.

We extracted 13,641 microglia/myeloid cells from the full dataset on the basis of marker expression and performed sub-clustering analysis to characterize the microglial responses with maximal resolution (Figure S1A). Four of the separated sub-clusters consisted of cells expressing combined signatures of microglia and another cell type: oligodendrocyte, oligodendrocyte progenitor cell, astrocyte, or vascular markers (Figures S1B–S1F, clusters 8–11). These events likely resulted from a low rate of doublets (i.e., droplets containing two separate cell types), as their relative abundance was proportional to the abundance of each cell type in the full dataset. Perivascular macrophages were also detected as a discrete population (Figures S1B–S1F, cluster 7). Cells from clusters 7–11 showed relatively stable representation across genotypes and thus were excluded from further analysis (Figure S1E). Unambiguous microglia singlets were distributed across six clusters (Figure 2A, clusters 1–6), largely aligning with previously defined microglial activation states on the basis of differential expression of characteristic gene modules (Figure 2C) (Friedman et al., 2018Friedman B.A. Srinivasan K.

(See GEO: GSE153895 for a tabular listing of each cell’s genotype and sample of origin, assigned activation state, and genome-wide gene expression values.) The majority of cells fell within a gradient spanning clusters 1–4; on one end, cluster 1 was assigned as resting microglia on the basis of high expression of microglial signature genes (e.g., Tmem119 and P2ry12), and on the other end, cluster 4 was assigned as DAM on the basis of high expression of neurodegeneration-related markers (e.g., Gpnmb, Dkk2, and Itgax). Cluster 3 fell into an intermediate zone between these two poles and was characterized by a partial loss of microglia signature gene expression and partial induction of many DAM genes (e.g., Apoe and Lpl, but not the cluster 4 genes mentioned above) (Figures 2C, 2D, and S1B). As such, these cells resembled “stage 1 DAM” previously proposed to represent an intermediate activation state en route to full DAM activation (Keren-Shaul et al., 2017Keren-Shaul H. Spinrad A.

Here, we call the partially responsive intermediate cells from cluster 3 “DAM1,” and the maximally activated cells from cluster 4 we call “DAM2.” (See Data S3 for differential expression analysis among resting, DAM1, and DAM2 clusters.) Beyond resting and DAM, we also resolved three smaller clusters, each representing on average 1.2%–7.3% of the total microglial population (Figures 2A and 2E). The largest among these (cluster 5) was characterized by upregulation of interferon response genes (e.g., Isg15 and Zbp1) (Figures 2C, 2D, and S1B), which are highly upregulated by microglia in models of viral infection and lupus (Bialas et al., 2017Bialas A.R.

https://openalex.org/W3133536873,"Adult neurogenesis plays critical roles in maintaining brain homeostasis and responding to neurogenic insults. However, the adult mammalian spinal cord lacks an intrinsic capacity for neurogenesis. Here we show that spinal cord injury (SCI) unveils a latent neurogenic potential of NG2+ glial cells, which can be exploited to produce new neurons and promote functional recovery after SCI. Although endogenous SOX2 is required for SCI-induced transient reprogramming, ectopic SOX2 expression is necessary and sufficient to unleash the full neurogenic potential of NG2 glia. Ectopic SOX2-induced neurogenesis proceeds through an expandable ASCL1+ progenitor stage and generates excitatory and inhibitory propriospinal neurons, which make synaptic connections with ascending and descending spinal pathways. Importantly, SOX2-mediated reprogramming of NG2 glia reduces glial scarring and promotes functional recovery after SCI. These results reveal a latent neurogenic potential of somatic glial cells, which can be leveraged for regenerative medicine."

Sadly, only insignificant heed has been paid to the unveiling of determinants of cryptocurrency adoption globally, particularly in emerging markets like Malaysia. The purpose of the study is to examine whether the application of deep learning-based dual-stage Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) &amp; Artificial Neural Network (ANN) analysis enable better in-depth research results as compared to single-step PLS-SEM approach and to excavate factors which can predict behavioural intention to adopt cryptocurrency. The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) model were extended with the inclusion of trust and personnel innovativeness. The model was further validated by introducing a new path model compared to the original UTAUT2 model and the moderating role of personal innovativeness between performance expectancy and price value, with a sample of 314 respondents. Contrary to previous technology adoption studies that used PLS-SEM &amp; ANN as single-stage analysis, this study further enhanced the analysis by applying a deep learning-based dual-stage PLS-SEM and ANN method. The application of deep learning-based dual-stage PLS-SEM &amp; ANN analysis is a novel methodological approach, detecting both linear and non-linear associations among constructs. At the same time, it is regarded as a superior statistical approach as compared to traditional hybrid shallow SEM &amp; ANN single-stage analysis. Also, sensitivity analysis provides normalised importance using multi-layer perceptron with the feed-forward-back-propagation algorithm. Furthermore, the deep learning-based dual-stage PLS-SEM &amp; ANN revealed that trust proved to be the strongest predictor in driving user intention. The introduction of this new methodology and the theoretical contribution opens the vistas of the extant body of knowledge in technology-adoption related literature. This study also provides theoretical, practical and methodological contributions."
https://openalex.org/W3134235489,"Disturbed neuronal activity in neuropsychiatric pathologies emerges during development and might cause multifold neuronal dysfunction by interfering with apoptosis, dendritic growth, and synapse formation. However, how altered electrical activity early in life affects neuronal function and behavior in adults is unknown. Here, we address this question by transiently increasing the coordinated activity of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex of neonatal mice and monitoring long-term functional and behavioral consequences. We show that increased activity during early development causes premature maturation of pyramidal neurons and affects interneuronal density. Consequently, altered inhibitory feedback by fast-spiking interneurons and excitation/inhibition imbalance in prefrontal circuits of young adults result in weaker evoked synchronization of gamma frequency. These structural and functional changes ultimately lead to poorer mnemonic and social abilities. Thus, prefrontal activity during early development actively controls the cognitive performance of adults and might be critical for cognitive symptoms in neuropsychiatric diseases."

With different control policies from local and state government, the COVID-19 outbreak has dramatically changed mobility behavior in affected cities. This study has been investigating the impact of COVID-19 on the number of people involved in crashes accounting for the intensity of different control measures using Negative Binomial (NB) method. Based on a comprehensive dataset of people involved in crashes aggregated in New York City during January 1, 2020 to May 24, 2020, people involved in crashes with respect to travel behavior, traffic characteristics and socio-demographic characteristics are found. The results show that the average person miles traveled on the main traffic mode per person per day, percentage of work trip have positive effect on person involved in crashes. On the contrary, unemployment rate and inflation rate have negative effects on person involved in crashes. Interestingly, different level of control policies during COVID-19 outbreak are closely associated with safety awareness, driving and travel behavior, and thus has an indirect influence on the frequency of crashes. Comparing to other three control policies including emergence declare, limits on mass gatherings, and ban on all nonessential gathering, the negative relationship between stay-at-home policy implemented in New York City from March 20, 2020 and the number of people involved crashes is found in our study."
https://openalex.org/W3134765723,"Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are considered as the fundamental tool for economic growth, nevertheless, they face continuous financing challenges. SMEs are a major source for generating employment, creation of wealth and alleviating poverty from the rural regions in developing countries. Their access to finance is key to the expansion of this sector. The paper aims to discover the intervening role of “access of SMEs to finance” in the link between SME’s evolution and rural development, in the context of Pakistan. In total 338 entrepreneurs operating SMEs in rural areas completed a survey for the study. Through a multi-stage stratified random sampling technique, entrepreneurs were selected from three districts. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling were used to test hypotheses. This study shows that SME’s evolution has a positive and optimistic influence on rural development. Further, the study also reveals that on SME’s progress a positive influence happens by the “access of SMEs to finance”. Particularly, the study finds that “access of SMEs to finance” significantly mediated the effect of SME’s evolution on rural development. The findings of this paper hold significant implications for both the research society and loan-issuing institutions and departments."
https://openalex.org/W3134553592,"Objective Despite the availability of mental health care, only a minority of depressed adolescents and young adults receive treatment. This study aimed to investigate facilitating factors and barriers in help-seeking behaviour of adolescents and young adults with depressive symptoms, using qualitative research methods. Methods In-depth, semi-structured interviews with 32 participants with current or previous depressive symptoms aged 16 to 24 years using thematic content analysis. Findings Our sample consisted mainly of adolescents who eventually found their way to professional help. Five main themes in help-seeking by adolescents and young adults were identified: (I) Individual functioning and well-being, (II) Health literacy, (III) Attitudinal aspects, (IV) Surroundings, and (V) Accessibility. Prompts to seek treatment were disease burden and poor academic performance. Health illiteracy negatively influenced treatment-seeking behaviour. Attitudinal aspects either hampered (shame, wanting to handle the problem oneself, negative attitudes towards treatment) or facilitated (positive attitudes towards treatment) help-seeking. Furthermore, adolescents’ surroundings (school, family, and peers) appeared to play a critical role in the recognition of depressive symptoms and encouragement to seek help. Barriers regarding accessibility of mental health care were found, whereas direct and easy access to treatment greatly improved mental health care use. Conclusion Facilitating factors can play a critical role in the help-seeking process of depressed adolescents and young adults, and may guide efforts to increase access to mental health care of this vulnerable age group. In particular, recognition and encouragement from school personnel and peers and easy access to care providers positively influenced help-seeking in our sample. Health illiteracy and attitudinal aspects appeared to be important barriers to seeking treatment and public/school campaigns aimed at reducing health illiteracy and stigma might be necessary to improve treatment-seeking and health care utilization in this age group."
https://openalex.org/W3135072281,"The aggregation of amyloidogenic polypeptides is strongly linked to several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Conformational antibodies that selectively recognize protein aggregates are leading therapeutic agents for selectively neutralizing toxic aggregates, diagnostic and imaging agents for detecting disease, and biomedical reagents for elucidating disease mechanisms. Despite their importance, it is challenging to generate high-quality conformational antibodies in a systematic and site-specific manner due to the properties of protein aggregates (hydrophobic, multivalent, and heterogeneous) and limitations of immunization (uncontrolled antigen presentation and immunodominant epitopes). Toward addressing these challenges, we have developed a systematic directed evolution procedure for affinity maturing antibodies against Alzheimer's Aβ fibrils and selecting variants with strict conformational and sequence specificity. We first designed a library based on a lead conformational antibody by sampling combinations of amino acids in the antigen-binding site predicted to mediate high antibody specificity. Next, we displayed this library on the surface of yeast, sorted it against Aβ42 aggregates, and identified promising clones using deep sequencing. The resulting antibodies displayed similar or higher affinities than clinical-stage Aβ antibodies (aducanumab and crenezumab). Moreover, the affinity-matured antibodies retained high conformational specificity for Aβ aggregates, as observed for aducanumab and unlike crenezumab. Notably, the affinity-maturated antibodies displayed extremely low levels of nonspecific interactions, as observed for crenezumab and unlike aducanumab. We expect that our systematic methods for generating antibodies with unique combinations of desirable properties will improve the generation of high-quality conformational antibodies specific for diverse types of aggregated conformers."
https://openalex.org/W3134591679,"Background The prevalence of abdominal obesity has been dramatically increasing both in developed and developing countries, including Ethiopia. It is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, type-2 diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, and cancer. However, there is inadequate data regarding the prevalence and associated factors of abdominal obesity among adult population in Ethiopia. Objective This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of abdominal obesity among the adult population in Woldia town, Northeast Ethiopia in 2020. Method A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Woldia town from March 20 to April 20, 2020. Data on socio-demographic, dietary history, and anthropometric characteristics were collected from 802 adults using the World Health Organization stepwise technique. Multi-stage sampling was employed to select the study subjects. Data were cleaned, coded, and entered by EPI-info Version 7 and were exported to SPSS Version 20 for further analysis. To indicate the strength of association, odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were used. Result From a total of 823 respondents 802 were involved with a response rate of 97.4%. The overall prevalence of central obesity based on waist to hip ratio was 16.5% with 95% CI (14.2–19.2). Female sex [AOR = 13.3, 95% CI: 7.01–25.39), high wealth rank (AOR = 2.95, 95% CI: 1.21–7.17), single marital status (AOR = 0.16, 95%CI: 0.04–0.58), age from 35 to 55 years (AOR = 4.3, 95% CI: 2.22–7.99), age greater than 55 years (AOR = 3.8, 95%CI: 1.36–10.78), secondary educational level (AOR = 1.83, 95% CI: 1.05–3.18), eat more protein (AOR = 4.22, 95% CI: 1.26–14.22), and consumption of snacks (AOR = 2.78, 95% CI: 1.68–4.61) were significantly associated with abdominal obesity. Conclusion The prevalence of abdominal obesity among adults in Woldia town is high, and has become an emerging nutrition-related problem. Being female, older age, being in a high wealth rank, consuming more meat, having secondary education level, and consuming snacks were the risk factors of abdominal obesity. Nutrition interventions should target adults mainly focusing on the alarmingly increase in nutrition problems, such as abdominal obesity, in Ethiopia with specific attention to females."

Most efforts to insert genes have relied on homology-directed repair (HDR)-mediated integration, but this strategy remains inefficient for the production of gene-edited livestock, especially monotocous species such as cattle. Although efforts have been made to improve HDR efficiency, other strategies have also been proposed to circumvent these challenges. Here we demonstrate that a homology-mediated end-joining (HMEJ)-based method can be used to create gene-edited cattle that displays precise integration of a functional gene at the ROSA26 locus. We found that the HMEJ-based method increased the knock-in efficiency of reporter genes by eightfold relative to the traditional HDR-based method in bovine fetal fibroblasts. Moreover, we identified the bovine homology of the mouse Rosa26 locus that is an accepted genomic safe harbor and produced three live-born gene-edited cattle with higher rates of pregnancy and birth, compared with previous work. These gene-edited cattle exhibited predictable expression of the functional gene natural resistance-associated macrophage protein-1 (NRAMP1), a metal ion transporter that should and, in our experiments does, increase resistance to bovine tuberculosis, one of the most detrimental zoonotic diseases.

Furthermore, the bovine ROSA26 (bROSA26) locus has been already identified and its locus tagged with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) using TALENs (32Wang M. Sun Z.L. Zou Z.Y. Ding F.R.

However, major previous studies focused on insertion of reporter genes instead of functional genes. Bovine tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) is one of the most detrimental zoonotic diseases (33Grange J.M. Mycobacterium bovis infection in human beings.Tuberculosis. 2001; 81: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 34Thoen C. LoBue P. de Kantor I.

Pavlik I. Bovine tuberculosis: An old disease but a new threat to Africa.Int. J. Tuberc. Lung Dis. 2004; 8: 924-937PubMed Google Scholar). At present, the disease remains widespread and is not effectively controlled or eliminated in some less developed areas (36Waters W.R. Palmer M.V. Buddle B.M. Vordermeier H.M. Bovine tuberculosis vaccine research: Historical perspectives and recent advances.Vaccine. 2012; 30: 2611-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We have reported Cas9 nuclease-mediated NRAMP1 gene KI cattle. The overexpression of bovine NRAMP1 gene provides the gene-edited cattle with increased resistance to tuberculosis (2Gao Y. Wu H. Wang Y. Liu X. Chen L. Li Q. Cui C. Liu X. Zhang J. Zhang Y. Single Cas9 nickase induced generation of NRAMP1 knockin cattle with reduced off-target effects.Genome Biol. 2017; 18: 13Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, the low rates of pregnancy and birth limited the mass production of gene-edited cattle. In this study, we firstly identified bROSA26 locus and the optimal promoter that supported selected markers expression in bovine fetal fibroblasts (BFFs) for screening targeted colonies to perform somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). Then we detected that the HMEJ-based method facilitated DNA integration and showed higher efficiency than the HDR-, MMEJ-, NHEJ-based methods in BFFs. Using the HMEJ-based method, we targeted to the bROSA26 locus to stimulate functional NRAMP1 gene KI and ultimately more effectively produced gene-edited cattle. These gene-edited cattle showed predictable expression and the ability to respond to M. bovis infection without off-target modification at potential off-target sites and without disturbance to nearby endogenous genes. Therefore, bROSA26 locus was identified as a potential GSH, allowing efficient HMEJ-based insertion of functional genes to produce cattle with increased resistance to tuberculosis, which will greatly accelerate the efficient production of gene-edited livestock. Mouse, human, rat, porcine, sheep, and rabbit data indicate that Rosa26 promoter region and exon 1 contained highly conserved sequences (29Yang D.S. Song J. Zhang J.F. Xu J. Zhu T.Q. Wang Z. Lai L.X.

The sequence of exon 1 of mouse Rosa26 transcript variant 2 plus putative promoter region was blasted against Bos taurus reference genomic sequence (taxid: 9913) in NCBI database, a highly conserved region (the highest degree of sequence similarity >84%) on bovine chromosome 22 was identified (Fig. S1). The sequence alignments of porcine ROSA26 promoter (1 kb upstream of exon 1) and exon 1 showed high sequence conservation (the highest degree of sequence similarity >92%) (Fig. S1). Sequences flanking this region contain the same genes to those in the Rosa26 locus of mouse and porcine (Lhfpl4, Setd5, and Thumpd3, Fig. 1A). We predicted the sequence of bROSA26 exon 1 from mouse Rosa26 exon 1 and designed a primer to perform 3ʹ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) analysis. One noncoding RNA product of at least 853 bp transcribed from the bROSA26 locus was identified (Fig. S2). Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis reaction for exon 1 and exon 2 demonstrated that the noncoding RNA was expressed in various adult tissues (Fig. 1B). Similar expression patterns were observed using oligonucleotides that amplify a 363 bp product across the intron between exon 1 and exon 2 in a conventional RT-PCR reaction (Fig. 1C). Figure S1 shows high sequence conservation of Rosa26 promoter region among mouse, bovine, and pig. Mouse and pig share the same 5ʹ start of the Rosa26 transcript. Therefore, we assumed the corresponding site as the 5ʹ start of the bROSA26 transcript. Firstly, we amplified the proximal sequence from 2007 bp upstream to 505 bp downstream (relative to the putative start) using Holstein cattle genomic DNA as template. Then a series of eight reporter constructs with progressively larger deletions from the 5ʹ end of the promoter were generated. The effects of these modifications were evaluated upon transfection of the corresponding luciferase reporter plasmids into BFFs, and the results of these analyses were shown in Figure 1D. Luciferase assays revealed that pGL4.10-1007/+505 showed the highest transcriptional activity but lower than two common strong promoters (pGL4.10-CMV and pGL4.10-EF1α) (Fig. 1D). Subsequently, five reporter constructs with progressively larger deletions from the 3ʹ end of the promoter were generated. We observed that pGL4.10-1007/+105 showed the highest promoter activities (Fig. 1E). Taken together, these results indicated that the region from –1007 to +105 relative to the putative TSS acts as an optimal promoter with a moderate level for endogenous gene expression. According to the result of 3ʹ RACE analysis, we designed five sgRNAs specific to the bROSA26 locus intron 1 (1512-bp) region between exon 1 and exon 2 on chromosome 22 (Fig. 2A). We constructed five SSA reporter plasmids containing designed target sites and five Cas9 expression plasmids containing 20-nt guide sequence and then cotransfected the corresponding SSA reporter plasmids and Cas9 expression plasmids into 293T cells. The activity of sgRNAs was screened with the luciferase assay as previously described (37Bhakta M.S. Segal D.J. The generation of zinc finger proteins by modular assembly.Methods Mol. Biol. 2010; 649: 3-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). All the sgRNAs except the sgRNA 45 showed extremely significant activity and the sgRNA 11 showed the highest activity (Fig. 2B). Therefore, we chose target site 11 to achieve the insertion of the exogenous gene in subsequent experiments. Given this broad expression of Rosa26 in adult tissues and the moderate activity of endogenous promoter, we were next interested in determining whether this locus could be targeted for selection of individual colonies. To evaluate whether bovine endogenous ROSA26 promoter can drive reporter genes expression in BFFs, a reporter vector pROSA26-SA-EGFP-Puro-HDR, expressing selected markers, was constructed as shown in Figures 2A and S3A. The vector contains a 5ʹ arm and a 3ʹ arm of homology, which together span 1578 bp of the bROSA26 locus. The vector overlaps with sequences of the intron 1 and the exon 2 of the bROSA26 locus. A splice acceptor (SA) sequence and a promoterless selected markers cassette separate the HAs and two LoxP sites. The selected markers cassette consists of the EGFP and puromycin resistance gene, which were fused by the porcine teschovirus-1 2A peptide sequence. The transcription of the selected markers was expected to mimic that of endogenous ROSA26 by SA sequence. The LoxP sites are positioned such that after expression of Cre recombinase (Cre), the selected markers cassette is removed after subsequent exogenous gene target for the production of marker-free gene-edited cattle. Plasmids encoding Cas9 protein, Cas9/sgRNA11, were cotransfected with pROSA26-SA-EGFP-Puro-HDR (Fig. S3A) into BFFs to achieve stable genetic modification of cells that were targeted to bROSA26 locus through HDR. After screening with puromycin, drug-resistant colonies (Fig. 2C) were picked and analyzed by 5ʹ junction PCR for evidence of correct targeting (Fig. S3B). To rule out potential false-positives, we performed 3ʹ junction PCR on genomic DNA from 5ʹ junction PCR-positive colonies (Fig. S3B). Sequence analysis of the resulting 1824-bp (left homology arm) and 2833-bp (right homology arm) fragments of 5ʹ and 3ʹ junction PCR confirmed site-specific integration of the targeting vector into the bROSA26 locus (Fig. 3A). These results clearly demonstrated the ability of the endogenous bROSA26 promoter to drive the reporter genes expression for selecting individual colonies in BFFs. Efficient KI of exogenous DNA is the key to generating a sufficient number of targeted colonies for SCNT. To test the feasibility and efficiency of HMEJ-, NHEJ-, or MMEJ-based methods in cattle, we constructed another three types of donors: an HMEJ donor (sgRNA target sites plus long ∼800 bp HAs), an MMEJ donor (sgRNA target sites plus short ∼20 bp HAs), and an NHEJ donor (only sgRNA target sites) (Fig. 2A). These donors can be cleaved at the sgRNA11 target site by Cas9/sgRNA11, which would cleave both genome and donor plasmid, to provide linear templates carrying HAs. At 7 days after cotransfecting each of the four types of donors, respectively, with Cas9/sgRNA11 in BFFs, we detected that the KI efficiency of the HMEJ-based method was significantly higher than that of the other methods by FACS (Fig. 2D). To further clarify whether the HMEJ-based method facilitated DNA integration at a higher efficiency than other three strategies, we cotransfected each of the four types of donors, respectively, with Cas9/sgRNA11 into BFFs. Stably transfected colonies were identified following 10–12 days of puromycin selection. The HMEJ-based method had an approximate eightfold increase in the number of target colonies compared with the HDR-based method (Fig. 2E). Junction PCR and sequencing confirmed the correct joining between genome and donor plasmids in HMEJ and HDR groups (Figs. 2A and S4). These results suggested that the HMEJ-based method, which simultaneously introduced DSBs in genome and donors, was also able to induce precise integration of reporter genes at target sites in BFFs and showed the higher KI efficiency, compared with the HDR-based method. However, no target colonies were observed in NHEJ groups and MMEJ groups (Fig. 2E), which suggested that the NHEJ-based method and the MMEJ-based method may be inefficient for precise integration of reporter genes at bROSA26 locus in BFFs. Collectively, these data were consistent with the results observed by FACS analyses, and they clearly showed that HMEJ-based method was a highly desirable strategy for efficient KI of exogenous DNA. We constructed the gene-targeting vector, pROSA26-SA-EGFP-Puro-HMEJ-NRAMP1, by inserting the NRAMP1 gene and its original promoter sequence into pROSA26-SA-EGFP-Puro-HMEJ, directing NRAMP1 expression only in bovine macrophages and other dedicated phagocytes, as previously described (38Hedges J.F. Kimmel E. Snyder D.T. Jerome M. Jutila M.A. Solute carrier 11A1 is expressed by innate lymphocytes and augments their activation.J. Immunol. 2013; 190: 4263-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we introduced this targeting vector along with Cas9/sgRNA11 into BFFs and achieved the insertion of NRAMP1 gene (Fig. 3A). Stably transfected cells (Fig. S5A), after selection with puromycin, were screened by 5ʹ -junction (1.824-bp) PCR, 3ʹ -junction (2261-bp) PCR and sequence analysis to confirm that gene-edited cassette was inserted into the intended specific site (Fig. S5, B and C and Fig. 3A). Then these targeted colonies were used for Southern blot analyses to further evaluate the insertion of gene-edited cassette. As expected, the integration of a single copy of the exogenous gene was confirmed by using an external of the genome homology region probe1 by showing a 6.2-kb band from the endogenous ROSA26 allele and a 3.8-kb band characteristic of the insertion (Fig. 3B). None of these targeted colonies showed random integration of the exogenous gene by the appearance of an expected single 6.7-kb band by using a probe specific for the NRAMP1 gene (Fig. 3B). SCNT was carried out to reconstruct bovine embryos by using the randomly picked seven heterozygous targeted colonies (Table 1). Then embryos were successfully reconstructed, and some reconstructed embryos were developed to blastocyst stage. Gene-edited blastocysts were transferred into the oviducts of 34 recipient heifers. Eleven (32.3%) surrogates were confirmed pregnant by ultrasound examination 1 month after the embryo transfer. Finally, three live calves were produced (Fig. 4A). For Cas9 nuclease-mediated KI cattle, HMEJ-based safe-harbor genome editing led to a dramatic increase in the rates of pregnancy and birth (32.3% and 8.8%), as compared with previous studies (12.7% and 2.3%) (2Gao Y. Wu H. Wang Y. Liu X. Chen L. Li Q. Cui C. Liu X. Zhang J. Zhang Y.

As expected, the gene-edited cattle were heterozygous for site-specific NRAMP1 KI at the target site (Fig. 4, B and C). Subsequently, we cloned eight main sgRNA11 potential off-target sites that were predicted based on sequence similarity to the target sequence from all gene-edited cattle genome. We did not detect any typical indels in all of the analyzed off-target sites (Fig. S6). These results demonstrated precise integration of the exogenous gene at bROSA26 locus without detected off-target modification. We isolated mononuclear cells from the peripheral blood of gene-edited cattle and wild-type cattle and induced them into macrophages. The monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) were separated from each animal individually and mixed for subsequent studies. To test whether bROSA26 locus can support predictable exogenous gene expression while minimizing the impact on the expression of nearby endogenous genes in gene-edited cattle. We extracted mRNA from the MDMs of gene-edited cattle and wild-type cattle and performed qPCR analysis. No significant difference was detected in the relative levels of expression of the nearby endogenous genes (SETD5 and THUMPD3) between the gene-edited and wild-type cattle (Fig. 5A). Note that no expression of LHFPL4 was detected between"

C1q and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) related 4 (C1QTNF4) is a member of the C1q and TNF related (C1QTNF) family, a family of secreted proteins that were initially identified as paralogs of adiponectin (1Wong G.W.

While both studies provide some indication that C1QTNF4 may be involved in signaling pathways upstream of interleukin 6 (IL-6), the molecular mechanisms underlying many of C1QTNF4’s reported functions remain unknown. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune inflammatory disease of complex genetic etiology that involves both the innate and adaptive immune system. Genetic advances have implicated many pathogenic pathways, including immune complex and waste clearance, interferon and toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, as well as aberrant lymphocyte activation (9Tsokos G.C.

A rare novel de novo mutation in C1QTNF4, a histidine to glutamine missense variant (H198Q), was recently discovered through exome sequencing of SLE family trios. Mutant C1QTNF4 appeared to inhibit some TNF-mediated cellular responses in vitro, including NF-κB activation and TNF-induced cell death (10Pullabhatla V. Roberts A.L. Lewis M.J. Mauro D. Morris D.L.

Very recently this mutation was further reported in a small cohort of Iranian SLE patients, possibly a reflection of the local population structure (11Pakzad B. Shirpour R. Mousavi M. Karimzadeh H.

Here, we describe the identification of nucleolin as a cell surface receptor of C1QTNF4. We show that the second C1q-like domain in C1QTNF4 is responsible for oligomerization and receptor binding. Monocytes, and to a lesser extent B cells, were found to be target cells of C1QTNF4, and extensive binding of C1QTNF4 to dead cells was observed. C1QTNF4 appears to become internalized upon binding to its receptor. Our data suggest that C1QTNF4 acts within the innate immune system, likely in an anti-inflammatory capacity. To identify a cell surface receptor of C1QTNF4, we used a recombinant GFP-C1QTNF4 fusion protein produced in E. coli as bait. Unfortunately, we were unable to produce unaggregated full-length human C1QTNF4 in mammalian HEK293 cells. Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) studies were performed by GFP-Trap with the SK-N-AS neuroblastoma cell line and samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie. We identified a band at approximately 100 kDa that was unique to the GFP-C1QTNF4-treated samples (Fig. 1A), which was excised and analyzed by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) from three independent sample pools. Nucleolin was identified as one of the top hits (Fig. 1B) and found to be present in all three samples (Table 1). We confirmed the presence of nucleolin in the co-immunoprecipitate by immunoblotting with an anti-nucleolin antibody and found that nucleolin was considerably more abundant in the GFP-C1QTNF4-treated sample than in the negative control (Fig. 1C). The same unique band at around 100 kDa was detected in SDS-PAGE when co-IP was performed from HEK293 cell lysate (Fig. S1A) and the presence of nucleolin could again be confirmed by immunoblot (Fig. S1B). While nucleolin has a calculated molecular mass of 77 kDa, the protein is known to migrate between 100 and 110 kDa in SDS-PAGE and is prone to autoproteolytic degradation (20Warrener P. Petryshyn R.

Cell binding of GFP-C1QTNF4 occurred at low to medium affinity in the lower micromolar range (Fig. S1C). In order to validate nucleolin as a cell surface receptor of C1QTNF4, we performed siRNA knockdown of nucleolin in HEK293 cells and observed a moderate reduction in GFP-C1QTNF4 binding (Fig. 2, A and B), which did not entirely mirror the knockdown efficiency observed for nucleolin, both in total cell lysate and on the cell surface (Fig. 2C). In contrast to this, knockdown in SK-N-AS cells was not able to reduce GFP-C1QTNF4 binding (Fig. S2, A–C). We recombinantly produced three soluble multidomain constructs of nucleolin in E. coli (Fig. 2D) comprising RNA-binding domains 1 to 4 (R1–4) and the glycine/arginine rich (GAR) region, as appropriate, and used these for competition cell-binding assays and in vitro co-IP experiments. Both R1234G and R4G were able to compete out GFP-C1QTNF4 binding to HEK293 cells (Fig. 2E), while R123 did not significantly reduce binding of GFP-C1QTNF4. These results provided corroboration that nucleolin is a cell surface receptor of C1QTNF4 and suggested that an interface within RNA-binding domain 4 and the GAR region of nucleolin is involved in the interaction with C1QTNF4. Successful competition of GFP-C1QTNF4 binding with R1234G and R4G was also confirmed in SK-N-AS cells (Fig. S2D). To further confirm the specificity of GFP-C1QTNF4’s cell binding to nucleolin, we tested competition with the DNA aptamer AS1411 targeting nucleolin (22Bates P.J. Laber D.A. Miller D.M. Thomas S.D. Trent J.O. Discovery and development of the G-rich oligonucleotide AS1411 as a novel treatment for cancer.Exp. Mol. Pathol. 2009; 86: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar), and were able to show that GFP-C1QTNF4 binding was completely abrogated (Fig. S2E). We performed in vitro co-IP between soluble nucleolin construct R1234G and recombinant full-length C1QTNF4 and were able to show direct interaction between nucleolin and C1QTNF4 (Fig. 2F).Table 1Mass spectrometric results of receptor co-IPIdentified proteinsAccession no.MW (kDa)Unique peptide count/Total spectrum count (% coverage)123NucleolinNUCL_HUMAN77 kDa8/8 (9.4%)8/10 (9.2%)11/18 (13.1%)Complement C1q tumor necrosis factor-related protein 4C1QT4_HUMAN35 kDa3/3 (10.9%)6/8 (21.6%)7/22 (26.4%)Gem-associated protein 4GEMI4_HUMAN120 kDa6/7 (6.2%)11/16 (10.9%)Probable ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX20DDX20_HUMAN92 kDa8/10 (12.0%)7/10 (10.0%)Trifunctional enzyme subunit alpha, mitochondrialECHA_HUMAN83 kDa5/5 (6.8%)Oxysterol-binding protein-related protein 1OSBL1_HUMAN108 kDa5/5 (5.3%)Fatty acid synthaseFAS_HUMAN273 kDa4/4 (2.0%)Golgi apparatus protein 1GSLG1_HUMAN135 kDa4/4 (4.2%)Oxysterol-binding protein-related protein 8OSBL8_HUMAN101 kDa4/4 (6.4%)ATP-binding cassette subfamily F member 1ABCF1_HUMAN96 kDa3/3 (5.3%)5'-3' exoribonuclease 2XRN2_HUMAN109 kDa3/3 (4.0%)Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit CEIF3C_HUMAN105 kDa3/3 (4.7%)Transcription intermediary factor 1-betaTIF1B_HUMAN89 kDa3/3 (7.9%)General transcription factor 3C polypeptide 3TF3C3_HUMAN101 kDa3/3 (4.5%)Results shown for proteins identified by LC-MS/MS meeting the following criteria: protein threshold: 99.9%, minimum number of peptides detected: 3, peptide threshold: 95%.

C1QTNF4 is unique within the C1QTNF and wider C1q-like domain-containing family by being made up of two C1q-like domains in tandem. To investigate the contributions of the two domains, we produced single-domain constructs of C1QTNF4 in E. coli (Fig. S3A). Domain 2 on its own tended to precipitate, even more so than full-length C1QTNF4, and thus GFP A206K-tagged constructs (Fig. S3B) were compared. While GFP can form dimers at high concentrations (23Phillips G.N. Structure and dynamics of green fluorescent protein.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 821-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), GFP A206K has been engineered as a monomer, with a very high micromolar dissociation constant (24Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Partitioning of lipid-modified monomeric GFPs into membrane microdomains of live cells.Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1779) Google Scholar) and therefore does not contribute to oligomerization at the concentrations used here. To determine the oligomerization state of C1QTNF4 constructs, we performed size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) with multiangle laser light scattering (SEC-MALLS) experiments. We observed that domain 1 of C1QTNF4 was mainly present in monomeric form (Fig. 3A), while full-length C1QTNF4 predominantly formed monomers and trimers, but was also present as likely hexamers and higher-molecular-weight species. Both GFP-tagged domain 1 and GFP-C1QTNF4 showed similar behavior to their untagged counterparts, although GFP-C1QTNF4 predominantly formed trimers and higher-molecular-weight species (Fig. S4A). GFP-tagged domain 2 formed large oligomers, based on these and further results possibly nonamers with distorting higher-molecular-weight species present. Nevertheless, it is possible that domain 2 forms multiple main oligomeric states. To test whether domains 1 and 2 of C1QTNF4 interact, we performed SEC of a 1:1 molar ratio of the two GFP-domain fusion constructs at 10 μM. However, we did not detect any interaction at medium to high affinity, as would be discernible by SEC (Fig. 3B). This suggests that oligomerization of C1QTNF4 is driven by domain 2, as domain 1 was found in monomeric form and there was no high affinity interaction between the domains. To investigate which of the domains is involved in binding to C1QTNF4’s receptor, we performed cell-binding experiments with the different GFP fusion constructs (Fig. 3C). Neither the GFP A206K control nor the GFP-C1QTNF4 domain 1 bound to cells. However, GFP-C1QTNF4 domain 2 bound to cells but it was not able to reproduce full-length GFP-C1QTNF4 binding, which could be due to differences in oligomerization state. In vitro co-IP experiments between GFP fusion constructs of C1QTNF4 and soluble nucleolin constructs confirmed that domain 2 and R4G appeared to be responsible for the interaction between C1QTNF4 and nucleolin, respectively (Fig. 3D). C1QTNF family members are known to form trimers as a basic structural unit (25Wong G.W. Krawczyk S.A. Kitidis-Mitrokostas C. Revett T. Gimeno R. Lodish H.F. Molecular, biochemical and functional characterizations of C1q/TNF family members: Adipose-tissue-selective expression patterns, regulation by PPAR-γ agonist, cysteine-mediated oligomerizations, combinatorial associations and metabolic functions.Biochem.

Res. 2009; 154: 18-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). While C1QTNF4 was found in different oligomeric forms, we were unable to identify one single active oligomeric species involved in receptor binding. Different oligomeric states of GFP-C1QTNF4, with what are likely trimeric, hexameric, and higher-molecular-weight species, bound to the receptor similarly well (Fig. S4B). The binding of monomeric GFP-C1QTNF4 was lower than oligomeric forms, but this is likely due to a lack of avidity of the monomeric form as well as a reduced overall fluorescence of the monomer. We investigated the impact of the H198Q mutation discovered in SLE, which is located in the second C1q-like domain of C1QTNF4. We did not observe any differences between the binding of wild-type and mutant H198Q GFP-C1QTNF4 in the cell-binding assays we performed (Fig. S5A), within the limitations of the sensitivity of the binding assays conducted. Further, we detected no obvious impact of the H198Q mutation on the oligomerization capacity of GFP-C1QTNF4 (Fig. S5B), with only small differences in oligomeric proportions observed, possibly due to batch effects, which confirms what has previously been reported for C1QTNF4 expressed in mammalian cells (10Pullabhatla V. Roberts A.L. Lewis M.J. Mauro D. Morris D.L. Odhams C.A. Tombleson P. Liljedahl U. Vyse S. Simpson M.A. Sauer S. de Rinaldis E. Syvänen A.-C. Vyse T.J. De novo mutations implicate novel genes in systemic lupus erythematosus.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2018; 27: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To investigate the cellular target cells of C1QTNF4 and to assess the expression of cell surface nucleolin in immune cell subsets, we performed flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a healthy female. Monocytes bound high levels of GFP-tagged C1QTNF4, while a subset of B cells and a very small percentage of T cells (approximately 1%) were positive for C1QTNF4 binding (Fig. 4A). This mirrored the cell surface expression pattern observed for nucleolin, with monocytes uniformly expressing nucleolin on their cell surface, a subset of B cells (here approximately 29%) and a very small subset of T cells (1–2%) staining positive for cell surface nucleolin (Fig. 4B and Fig. S6A for gating strategy). Interestingly, we observed binding of C1QTNF4 to dead cells. Failure to clear apoptotic cells is one of the pathways that can underlie SLE pathogenesis (28Nagata S. Hanayama R. Kawane K. Autoimmunity and the clearance of dead cells.Cell. 2010; 140: 619-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar), and C1q itself is known to directly bind to apoptotic cells via its globular head domain and to be involved in their clearance (29Korb L.C.

Med. 2001; 194: 781-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). Furthermore, nucleolin on the surface of macrophages can bind to early apoptotic Jurkat T cells through carbohydrate chains on capped CD43 (14Hirano K. Miki Y. Hirai Y. Sato R. Itoh T. Hayashi A.

Chem. 2005; 280: 39284-39293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To investigate whether C1QTNF4 is involved in apoptotic cell clearance, we tested binding of GFP-C1QTNF4 to staurosporine-induced apoptotic Jurkat T cells. Little binding of GFP-C1QTNF4 was observed to live or early apoptotic Jurkat T cells (Fig 5A and Fig. S6B for gating strategy), and this was mirrored with little cell surface staining seen for nucleolin on these subsets (Fig. 5B). In contrast, dead (late apoptotic) cells strongly and uniformly bound C1QTNF4. While dead cells are known to be “sticky” and thus routinely excluded from flow cytometric analysis, we observed binding of GFP-C1QTNF4 considerably above what was observed for GFP alone, suggesting a functional role. Nucleolin staining on these cells was also extensive, suggesting that nucleolin is accessible on dead cells and possibly an immunologically relevant target of C1QTNF4. Ligands of nucleolin have been reported to become actively internalized upon receptor binding, including lactoferrin (16Legrand D. Vigié K. Said E.A. Elass E. Masson M. Slomianny M.C. Carpentier M. Briand J.P. Mazurier J. Hovanessian A.G. Surface nucleolin participates in both the binding and endocytosis of lactoferrin in target cells.Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 303-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We assessed internalization of GFP-C1QTNF4 in CD14+ monocytes by imaging flow cytometry, comparing incubation on ice with incubation at 37 °C. GFP-C1QTNF4 localized to the membrane of monocytes after incubation on ice (Fig. 6A), while pronounced intracellular GFP-C1QTNF4 localization was observed after incubation at 37 °C (Fig. 6B), with a higher internalization score calculated (Fig. 6C). We performed similar experiments in HEK293 cells by microscopy and again found that GFP-C1QTNF4 localized to the cell membrane after incubation on ice (Fig. S7A), while highly fluorescent punctae were observed after incubation at 37 °C (Fig. S7B). No binding or internalization was observed for control GFP A206K (Fig. S7, C and D). These results suggest that C1QTNF4 becomes actively internalized as a result of receptor binding. As we were able to show that C1QTNF4 interacts with the C-terminal region of nucleolin, which has been implicated in ligand binding of many other molecules, including lactoferrin (16Legrand D.

A fundamental but poorly addressed question in neurobiology is how targeted GPCR trafficking is achieved. Rab GTPases are the master regulators of vesicle-mediated membrane trafficking, but their functions in the synaptic presentation of newly synthesized GPCRs are virtually unknown. Here, we investigate the role of Rab43, via dominant-negative inhibition and CRISPR–Cas9–mediated KO, in the export trafficking of α2-adrenergic receptor (α2-AR) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) in primary neurons and cells. We demonstrate that Rab43 differentially regulates the overall surface expression of endogenous α2-AR and mAChR, as well as their signaling, in primary neurons. In parallel, Rab43 exerts distinct effects on the dendritic and postsynaptic transport of specific α2B-AR and M3 mAChR subtypes. More interestingly, the selective actions of Rab43 toward α2B-AR and M3 mAChR are neuronal cell specific and dictated by direct interaction. These data reveal novel, neuron-specific functions for Rab43 in the dendritic and postsynaptic targeting and sorting of GPCRs and imply multiple forward delivery routes for different GPCRs in neurons.

G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute the largest superfamily of cell surface signaling proteins and modulate a variety of physiological and pathological functions of the nervous system. Neurons are the most sophisticated cells with specialized morphology and compartmentalization in which most GPCRs are expressed in both presynaptic and postsynaptic membrane terminals where they are able to bind to respective neurotransmitters to activate cognate heterotrimeric G proteins or other signaling molecules which in turn activate downstream effectors, including ion channels, and thus control synaptic signaling and transmission (1Hilger D.

However, virtually nothing is known about the function and regulation of the Rab family in the transport of newly synthesized GPCRs to dendrites and synapses. To address these issues, in this study, we determine the role of Rab43 in the dendritic and synaptic transport of the prototypic family A α2-adrenergic receptor (α2-AR) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR). The α2-AR and mAChR have three (α2A-, α2B-, and α2C-AR) and five subtypes (M1R–M5R), respectively, and all play important roles in the central and peripheral nervous systems. As compared with many other secretory Rab GTPases, the function of Rab43 is relatively poorly defined. Previous studies have shown that Rab43 is important for Golgi structure (28Haas A.K.

Theisen D.J. Tussiwand R. Briseno C.G. Grajales-Reyes G.E. Wu X. Durai V. Albring J. Bagadia P. Murphy T.L. Murphy K.M. RAB43 facilitates cross-presentation of cell-associated antigens by CD8alpha+ dendritic cells.J. Exp. Med. 2016; 213: 2871-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that Rab43 mediates the dendritic and postsynaptic delivery of some but not all GPCRs, and the function of Rab43 in the sorting of different GPCRs is dictated by direct interaction and in a neuronal cell–specific manner. Our data also provide direct evidence implicating distinct biosynthetic pathways that deliver different GPCRs to the functional destinations in neurons. As an initial approach to study the possible function of Rab43 in regulating the anterograde transport of newly synthesized GPCRs in neurons, we measured the effect of lentiviral expression of dominant-negative guanine nucleotide-deficient mutant Rab43N131I on the surface expression of endogenous α2-AR and mAChR in primary cortical neurons in radioligand binding assays. Expression of Rab43N131I markedly reduced the surface number of α2-AR by approximately 55% as compared with neurons infected with control viruses (Fig. 1, A and B). Surprisingly, Rab43N131I expression had no significant effect on the surface expression of mAChR (Fig. 1B). In contrast, treatment with brefeldin A (BFA), which disrupts the Golgi structure and thus blocks the ER-to-Golgi transport, similarly inhibited the surface expression of both α2-AR and mAChR by 40 to 60% (Fig. 1C). To define if Rab43 could differentially affect the concomitant function of α2-AR and mAChR, we used the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, specifically extracellular signal–regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), as a readout. Although α2-AR and mAChR each have multiple subtypes which couple to distinct heterotrimeric G proteins, they are all able to activate ERK1/2. Consistent with its effects on the surface receptor expression measured in radioligand binding assays, lentiviral expression of Rab43N131I strongly inhibited ERK1/2 activation in response to stimulation with the α2-AR agonist UK14304, without altering ERK1/2 activation by the mAChR agonist oxotremorine-m (Oxo-M) (Fig. 1, D and E). These data demonstrate that the surface expression of α2-AR and mAChR, as well as their signaling, is differentially regulated by Rab43 in neurons. We next determined the role of Rab43 in the dendritic and postsynaptic transport of α2-AR and mAChR, specifically the α2B-AR and M3 mAChR (M3R) subtypes, in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons by confocal imaging. We first determined if expression of Rab43N131I could alter the general morphology of neurons. As accessed by the DsRed and GFP signals, expression of DsRed-tagged Rab43N131I had no obvious effect on the general morphology of hippocampal neurons compared with neurons transfected with DsRed vectors (Fig. 2, A and B). The spine length, width, and density were very much the same in neurons expressing DsRed and Rab43N131I (Fig. 2, B and C). Consistent with radioligand-binding data, Rab43N131I significantly reduced the dendritic expression of α2B-AR by approximately 40%, but had no effect on M3R expression at dendrites (Fig. 2, D–F). Rab43N131I also significantly attenuated the expression of α2B-AR at the dendritic spines by about 35%, whereas M3R expression at the dendritic spines was not affected (Fig. 2, G–I). We then studied the effect of Rab43KO by the CRISPR–Cas9 system on the dendritic and postsynaptic trafficking of α2B-AR and M3R in the hippocampal neurons. Owing to the lack to Rab43 antibodies detecting endogenous Rab43 in primary neurons, the efficiency of Rab43KO was tested by using transient expression of GFP-tagged rat Rab43 in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells. The expression of rat Rab43 was reduced by more than 90% in cells transfected with Rab43KO plasmids targeting mouse Rab43 as compared with cells transfected with control vectors (Fig. 3A), suggesting that CRISPR–Cas9 KO plasmids targeting mouse Rab43 can deplete rat Rab43. In hippocampal neurons, similar to the effects of Rab43N131I, CRISPR–Cas9–mediated Rab43KO markedly inhibited the dendritic presentation of α2B-AR, but not M3R (Fig. 3, B–D). Rab43KO by CRISPR–Cas9 also reduced the expression of α2B-AR, but not M3R, at the dendritic spines (Fig. 3, E–G). To further confirm the role of Rab43 in the postsynaptic transport, hippocampal neurons were transfected with red fluorescent protein–tagged PSD95, GFP-carrying Rab43KO plasmids, and yellow fluorescent protein–tagged α2B-AR or M3R, and receptor expression at postsynapses was measured by using PSD95 as a marker. Postsynaptic expression of α2B-AR was markedly reduced, whereas M3R expression remained unaffected in Rab43KO neurons as compared with neurons transfected with control vectors (Fig. 3, H–J). These data demonstrate distinct functions of Rab43 in the forward transport of α2B-AR and M3R to the neuronal dendrites and postsynapses. We next compared the effects of Rab43 on the surface transport of α2-AR and mAChR in human-derived neuroblastoma SHSY5Y cells and rat renal tubular epithelial NRK49F cells. Similar to the results observed from primary cultures of neurons, Rab43N131I expression inhibited the total surface expression of endogenous α2-AR in both SHSY5Y and NRK49F cells by greater than 50%, whereas Rab43N131I only attenuated the surface number of endogenous mAChR in NRK49F cells, but not in SHSY5Y cells, as measured by radioligand binding (Fig. 4A). In contrast, BFA treatment significantly suppressed the surface expression of α2-AR and mAChR in both cell types (Fig. 4B). In bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assays to measure receptor surface expression, Rluc-tagged α2B-AR or M3R was expressed together with venus-tagged kRas and Rab43 mutants. In addition to Rab43N131I, inactive GDP-bound Rab43T32N mutant was also used. The net BRET signal between α2B-AR and kRas was markedly inhibited by both Rab43 mutants, whereas the BRET signal between M3R and kRas was not affected by the Rab43 mutants in SHSY5Y cells (Fig. 4C). Confocal microscopy showed that, as expected, both α2B-AR and M3R were robustly expressed at the cell surface in SHSY5Y and NRK49F cells transfected with control vectors. In Rab43N131I-expressing cells, α2B-AR was unable to transport to the cell surface and arrested in the perinuclear regions in both cell types, whereas M3R retained its ability to sufficiently move to the cell surface in SHSY5Y cells, but not in NRK49F cells (Fig. 4D). We then determined the effect of CRISPR–Cas9–mediated Rab43KO on the subcellular localization of α2B-AR and M3R. Rab43KO plasmids targeting human Rab43 were tested using GFP-tagged human Rab43 in HEK293 cells (Fig. 5A). Similar to Rab43N131I, Rab43KO arrested α2B-AR in the perinuclear regions in both SHSY5Y and NRK49F cells, whereas M3R was arrested only in NRK49F cells, but not in SHSY5Y cells (Fig. 5B). We then sought to determine if single-guide RNA (sgRNA)-resistant Rab43 plasmids could rescue the effect of CRISPR–Cas9–mediated Rab43KO on the surface expression of M3R. For this purpose, human Rab43 plasmids were transfected together with mouse Rab43KO plasmids in NRK49F cells. Human Rab43 expression was not affected by mouse Rab43KO plasmids (Fig. 5C). Expression of human Rab43 effectively rescued the surface expression of cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)-tagged M3R in NRK49F cells expressing mouse Rab43KO plasmids (Fig. 5D). These data demonstrate that different actions of Rab43 on the surface transport of mAChR and specific M3R subtype are neuronal cell type specific. As our previous studies have shown that α2B-AR directly interacts with Rab43 via the third intracellular loop (ICL3), to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the selective regulation of α2B-AR and M3R trafficking by Rab43 in neurons and neuronal ells, we compared Rab43 interaction with the ICL3 of both receptors in glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion protein pull-down assays. α2B-AR and M3R possess relatively large ICL3, containing 165 and 229 residues, respectively, which were generated as GST fusion proteins. Consistent with our previous data, the α2B-AR ICL3 strongly bound Rab43. In contrast, the M3R ICL3 binding to Rab43 was negligible (Fig. 6A). We then generated the chimeric receptor M3-2B in which the M3R ICL3 was substituted with the α2B-AR ICL3 (Fig. 6B) and measured the possible interactions between Rab43 and individual receptors in live cells in BRET assays. The net BRET signals observed between Rab43 and α2B-AR and between Rab43 and M3-2B were similar, but the net BRET signal between Rab43 and M3R was almost undetectable (Fig. 6C). These data suggest that the α2B-AR ICL3 can confer its interaction with Rab43 to M3R. We next determined the effect of Rab43 on M3-2B transport in cell lines and primary neurons. In contrast to M3R which is irresponsive to Rab43, the surface expression of M3-2B was inhibited by Rab43N131I and Rab43KO in SHSY5Y cells as measured by intact cell radioligand binding (Fig. 6D). Confocal microscopy showed that M3-2B was strongly expressed at the surface which was clearly impeded by Rab43N131I or Rab43KO in both SHSY5Y and NRK49F cells (Fig. 6, E and F). The intracellularly accumulated M3-2B was extensively colocalized with calregulin, an ER marker (Fig. 6, G and H). These data suggest that Rab43 is able to control M3-2B transport to the cell surface, specifically its export from the ER. In primary hippocampal neurons, M3-2B was expressed at dendrites and spines. Similar to the results observed in cells, M3-2B expression at dendrites (Fig. 7, A–C) and spines (Fig. 7, D–F) was significantly inhibited by Rab43N131I and Rab43KO. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of Rab43N131I and Rab43KO on the transport of M3-2B were similar (Fig. 7, C and F). These data demonstrate that the α2B-AR ICL3 controls not only M3-2B interaction with Rab43 but also its Rab43-dependent trafficking. As the first study on the functions of the Rab family GTPases in the anterograde dendritic and synaptic delivery of GPCRs, we have focused on Rab43 which was recently demonstrated to regulate GPCR trafficking in the early secretory pathway in cell (31Li C. Wei Z. Fan Y. Huang W. Su Y. Li H. Dong Z. Fukuda M. Khater M. Wu G. The GTPase Rab43 controls the anterograde ER-Golgi trafficking and sorting of GPCRs.Cell Rep. 2017; 21: 1089-1101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The most important finding presented in this article is that, through inhibiting the function of endogenous Rab43 by expression of dominant-negative mutants and CRISPR–Cas9–mediated KO, we have identified Rab43 as an important regulator in the anterograde trafficking of some but not all GPCRs in neurons. By using radioligand binding of intact live neurons to quantify the exact surface receptor number, we have demonstrated that Rab43 selectively regulates the total surface expression of endogenous α2-AR, but not mAChR, in primary neurons. By confocal microscopy to directly visualize the localization of fluorescence-tagged individual receptor subtypes, we have shown that the dendritic and postsynaptic expression of α2B-AR, but not M3R, depends on the normal function of Rab43. Such selective actions of Rab43 toward different GPCRs are also reflected by receptor-mediated signaling measured by ERK1/2 activation. These data provide direct evidence indicating novel functions for Rab43 in mediating GPCR transport to dendrites and synapses, as well as their sorting from one another in neurons. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that Rab43 may regulate the trafficking of other signaling molecules involved in receptor-mediated signal transduction pathways, which may also contribute to the observed abnormal signaling, and the role of Rab43 in the trafficking of other α2-AR and mAChR subtypes remains unknown. Similar to the results observed in primary neurons, Rab43 affects the surface expression of endogenous α2-AR and specific α2B-AR subtype, but not endogenous mAChR and M3R subtype, in neuronal SHSY5Y cells. In contrast, the surface transport of both receptors requires Rab43 in non-neuronal NRK49F cells. These data suggest that the sorting function of Rab43 in the trafficking of distinct GPCRs along the biosynthetic pathways is neuronal cell specific. These data also imply that trafficking itineraries of a GPCR (e.g., M3R) may differ in neurons/neuronal cells and non-neuronal cells. Although GPCRs share a common structural topology, how they are sorted into distinct transport pathways is poorly understood. Our previous studies suggest that Rab43 interaction may separate GPCRs from non-GPCR plasma membrane proteins (31Li C. Wei Z. Fan Y. Huang W. Su Y. Li H. Dong Z. Fukuda M. Khater M. Wu G. The GTPase Rab43 controls the anterograde ER-Golgi trafficking and sorting of GPCRs.Cell Rep. 2017; 21: 1089-1101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Our results presented here have demonstrated that the M3R chimera containing the Rab43-binding domain identified in α2B-AR interacts with Rab43 and its dendritic and postsynaptic transport in primary neurons and the surface transport in neuronal cells depend on Rab43. These data indicate that the Rab43-binding domain is able to effectively convert GPCR transport from a Rab43-independent pathway into a Rab43-dependent pathway and that the sorting function of Rab43 is mediated through its direct interaction with the receptors. An important implication of this study is that different GPCRs may use distinct pathways (e.g., Rab43-dependent and Rab43-independent pathways) to transport from the cell body to dendrites and from the dendritic shaft to spines. It is possible that M3R transport to dendrites is mediated through lateral diffusion as suggested for most GPCRs (5Liebmann T. Kruusmagi M. Sourial-Bassillious N. Bondar A. Svenningsson P. Flajolet M. Greengard P. Scott L. Brismar H. Aperia A. A noncanonical postsynaptic transport route for a GPCR belonging to the serotonin receptor family.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 17998-18008Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), which is independent of Rab43, whereas α2B-AR uses secretory vesicles to move forward to dendrites as suggested for serotonin 1B receptor (5HT1B) (5Liebmann T.

Neurosci. 2012; 32: 17998-18008Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), which is dependent on Rab43. It is interesting to note that, in addition to exist in the soma, the ER is distributed throughout the cytoplasm in dendrites, the Golgi forms discrete structures called “Golgi outposts” in the longest dendrite, and coat protein complex II (COPII) vesicles that exclusively mediate the ER export of newly synthesized molecules, including GPCRs (34Dong C.

Methods Single center, consecutive case series with historical controls. Patients presenting with primary RRD during the first Austrian SARS-CoV-2 lockdown (March 16 th –May 3 rd 2020) and a corresponding control group consisting of the same time period of the preceding 3 years. Results The mean number of patients with RD in the reference group (RG) was 22 (± 1) and in the lockdown group (LG) 15. Median total delay, defined as onset of symptoms until surgery, in the RG was 5 (lower quartile: 3.0; upper quartile: 8.0) compared to 7 (3.0; 12.0) days in the LG, (p = 0.740). During the lockdown 67% of patients were referred from an external ophthalmologist compared to 52% in the RG, (p = 0.395). 34% of patients in the RG presented with an attached macula compared to 33% in the LG (p = 0.597). PVR was present in 49% of cases in the RG compared to 73% in the LG. Single surgery success (SSS) rates were lower in the LG (73.3%) compared to the RG (85.3%), (p = 0.275). Conclusion Patients with RRD during the SARS-CoV-2 lockdown presented and were treated within acceptable time limits, showed the same macula-on ratios but a higher PVR rate and a tendency towards worse SSS rates compared to the time period of the preceding 3 years."
https://openalex.org/W3134382340,"PDZ domains are one of the most abundant protein domains in eukaryotes and are frequently found on junction-localized scaffold proteins. Various signaling molecules bind to PDZ proteins via PDZ-binding motifs (PBM) and fine-tune cellular signaling. However, how such interaction affects protein function is difficult to predict and must be solved empirically. Here we describe a long isoform of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor GIV/Girdin (CCDC88A) that we named GIV-L, which is conserved throughout evolution, from invertebrates to vertebrates, and contains a PBM. Unlike GIV, which lacks PBM and is cytosolic, GIV-L localizes onto cell junctions and has a PDZ interactome (as shown through annotating Human Cell Map and BioID-proximity labeling studies), which impacts GIV-L's ability to bind and activate trimeric G-protein, Gαi, through its guanine-nucleotide exchange modulator (GEM) module. This GEM module is found exclusively in vertebrates. We propose that the two functional modules in GIV may have evolved sequentially: the ability to bind PDZ proteins via the PBM evolved earlier in invertebrates, whereas G-protein binding and activation may have evolved later only among vertebrates. Phenotypic studies in Caco-2 cells revealed that GIV and GIV-L may have antagonistic effects on cell growth, proliferation (cell cycle), and survival. Immunohistochemical analysis in human colon tissues showed that GIV expression increases with a concomitant decrease in GIV-L during cancer initiation. Taken together, these findings reveal how regulation in GIV/CCDC88A transcript helps to achieve protein modularity, which allows the protein to play opposing roles either as a tumor suppressor (GIV-L) or as an oncogene (GIV)."
https://openalex.org/W3135391565,"Rodents are reservoirs of numerous zoonotic diseases caused by bacteria, protozoans, or viruses. In Gabon, the circulation and maintenance of rodent-borne zoonotic infectious agents are poorly studied and are often limited to one type of pathogen. Among the three existing studies on this topic, two are focused on a zoonotic virus, and the third is focused on rodent Plasmodium. In this study, we searched for a wide range of bacteria, protozoa and viruses in different organs of rodents from the town of Franceville in Gabon. Samples from one hundred and ninety-eight (198) small mammals captured, including two invasive rodent species, five native rodent species and 19 shrews belonging to the Soricidae family, were screened. The investigated pathogens were bacteria from the Rickettsiaceae and Anaplasmataceae families, Mycoplasma spp., Bartonella spp., Borrelia spp., Orientia spp., Occidentia spp., Leptospira spp., Streptobacillus moniliformis, Coxiella burnetii, and Yersinia pestis; parasites from class Kinetoplastida spp. (Leishmania spp., Trypanosoma spp.), Piroplasmidae spp., and Toxoplasma gondii; and viruses from Paramyxoviridae, Hantaviridae, Flaviviridae and Mammarenavirus spp. We identified the following pathogenic bacteria: Anaplasma spp. (8.1%; 16/198), Bartonella spp. (6.6%; 13/198), Coxiella spp. (5.1%; 10/198) and Leptospira spp. (3.5%; 7/198); and protozoans: Piroplasma sp. (1%; 2/198), Toxoplasma gondii (0.5%; 1/198), and Trypanosoma sp. (7%; 14/198). None of the targeted viral genes were detected. These pathogens were found in Gabonese rodents, mainly Lophuromys sp., Lemniscomys striatus and Praomys sp. We also identified new genotypes: Candidatus Bartonella gabonensis and Uncultured Anaplasma spp. This study shows that rodents in Gabon harbor some human pathogenic bacteria and protozoans. It is necessary to determine whether the identified microorganisms are capable of undergoing zoonotic transmission from rodents to humans and if they may be responsible for human cases of febrile disease of unknown etiology in Gabon."
https://openalex.org/W3134124649,"Acute liver failure constitutes a devastating condition that needs novel cell and molecular therapies. To elicit synergisms in cell types of therapeutic interest, we studied hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial in mice with acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure. The context of regenerative signals was examined by transplants in peritoneal cavity because it possesses considerable capacity and allows soluble signals to enter the systemic circulation. Whereas transplanted hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells engrafted in peritoneal cavity, only the former could rescue mice in liver failure by improving injury outcomes, activating hepatic DNA damage repair, and inducing liver regeneration. The cytokines secreted by donor hepatocytes or liver sinusoidal endothelial cells differed and in hepatocytes from mice undergoing acetaminophen toxicity major cytokines were even rendered deficient (eg, G-CSF, VEGF, and others). Significantly, recapitulating hepatotoxicity-related DNA damage response in cultured cells identified impairments in ATM and JAK/STAT3 intersections since replacing cytokines produced less from injured hepatocytes restored these pathways to avoid acetaminophen hepatotoxicity. Similarly, hepatocyte transplantation in acute liver failure restored ATM and JAK/STAT3 pathways to advance DNA damage/repair and liver regeneration. The unexpected identification of novel hepatic G-CSF receptor expression following injury allowed paradigmatic studies of G-CSF supplementation to confirm the centrality of this paracrine ATM and STAT3 intersection. Remarkably, DNA damage/repair and hepatic regeneration directed by G-CSF concerned rebalancing of regulatory gene networks overseeing inflammation, metabolism, and cell viability. We conclude that healthy donor hepatocytes offer templates for generating specialized cell types to replace metabolic functions and regenerative factors in liver failure."
https://openalex.org/W3134177145,"While the administration of anti-CD154 mAbs in mice validated the CD40-CD154 pathway as a target against inflammatory disorders, this approach caused thromboembolism in humans (unrelated to CD40 inhibition) and is expected to predispose to opportunistic infections. There is a need for alternative approaches to inhibit CD40 that avoid these complications. CD40 signals through TRAF2,3 and TRAF6-binding sites. Given that CD40-TRAF6 is the pathway that stimulates responses key for cell-mediated immunity against opportunistic pathogens, we examined the effects of pharmacologic inhibition of CD40-TRAF2,3 signaling. We used a model of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced retinopathy, a CD40-driven inflammatory disorder. Intravitreal administration of a cell-penetrating CD40-TRAF2,3 blocking peptide impaired ICAM-1 upregulation in retinal endothelial cells and CXCL1 upregulation in endothelial and Muller cells. The peptide reduced leukocyte infiltration, upregulation of NOS2/COX-2/TNF-α/IL-1β, and ameliorated neuronal loss, effects that mimic those observed after I/R in Cd40-/- mice. While a cell-penetrating CD40-TRAF6 blocking peptide also diminished I/R-induced inflammation, this peptide (but not the CD40-TRAF2,3 blocking peptide) impaired control of the opportunistic pathogen Toxoplasma gondii in the retina. Thus, inhibition of the CD40-TRAF2,3 pathway is a novel and potent approach to reduce CD40-induced inflammation, while likely diminishing the risk of opportunistic infections that would otherwise accompany CD40 inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W3135524293,"Numerous observations indicate that red blood cells (RBCs) affect T-cell activation and proliferation. We have studied effects of packed RBCs (PRBCs) on T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling and the molecular mechanisms whereby (P)RBCs modulate T-cell activation. In line with previous reports, PRBCs attenuated the expression of T-cell activation markers CD25 and CD69 upon costimulation via CD3/CD28. In addition, T-cell proliferation and cytokine expression were markedly reduced when T-cells were stimulated in the presence of PRBCs. Inhibitory activity of PRBCs required direct cell–cell contact and intact PRBCs. The production of activation-induced cellular reactive oxygen species, which act as second messengers in T-cells, was completely abrogated to levels of unstimulated T-cells in the presence of PRBCs. Phosphorylation of the TCR-related zeta chain and thus proximal TCR signal transduction was unaffected by PRBCs, ruling out mechanisms based on secreted factors and steric interaction restrictions. In large part, downstream signaling events requiring reactive oxygen species for full functionality were affected, as confirmed by an untargeted MS-based phosphoproteomics approach. PRBCs inhibited T-cell activation more efficiently than treatment with 1 mM of the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine. Taken together, our data imply that inflammation-related radical reactions are modulated by PRBCs. These immunomodulating effects may be responsible for clinical observations associated with transfusion of PRBCs. Numerous observations indicate that red blood cells (RBCs) affect T-cell activation and proliferation. We have studied effects of packed RBCs (PRBCs) on T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling and the molecular mechanisms whereby (P)RBCs modulate T-cell activation.

In addition, T-cell proliferation and cytokine expression were markedly reduced when T-cells were stimulated in the presence of PRBCs. Inhibitory activity of PRBCs required direct cell–cell contact and intact PRBCs. The production of activation-induced cellular reactive oxygen species, which act as second messengers in T-cells, was completely abrogated to levels of unstimulated T-cells in the presence of PRBCs. Phosphorylation of the TCR-related zeta chain and thus proximal TCR signal transduction was unaffected by PRBCs, ruling out mechanisms based on secreted factors and steric interaction restrictions. In large part, downstream signaling events requiring reactive oxygen species for full functionality were affected, as confirmed by an untargeted MS-based phosphoproteomics approach. PRBCs inhibited T-cell activation more efficiently than treatment with 1 mM of the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine. Taken together, our data imply that inflammation-related radical reactions are modulated by PRBCs. These immunomodulating effects may be responsible for clinical observations associated with transfusion of PRBCs. Following specific T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation in lymphoid organs, T-cells can transmigrate into tissues, primarily exerting their immunological functions in the interstitium. Numerous checkpoints and control mechanisms that interrupt T-cell activation prevent unspecific stimulation and harmful consequences such as autoimmune disease (1Guram K. Kim S.S. Wu V. Sanders P.D.

Immunol. 2019; 10: 491Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Among numerous other factors, the quantity and quality of T-cell activation depends on the metabolic micromilieu (i.e., availability of carbohydrates, lipids, or amino acids) and on local concentrations of small molecules, electrolytes, oxygen, and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Thus, the alteration of metabolism offers multiple targets for intervention of T-cell responses (2Chapman N.M. Boothby M.R. Chi H. Metabolic coordination of T cell quiescence and activation.Nat. Rev.

In this context, T-cells may also serve as a model to improve our knowledge of cell activation, proliferation, apoptosis, and survival (5Franchina D.G. Dostert C. Brenner D.

Red blood cells carry out T cell growth and survival bioactivities that are sensitive to cyclosporine A.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2009; 66: 3387-3398Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These effects were in part mediated by RBC-derived factors (11Antunes R.F. Brandão C. Maia M. Arosa F.A. Red blood cells release factors with growth and survival bioactivities for normal and leukemic T cells.Immunol. Cell Biol. 2011; 89: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). RBCs can be processed and stored as packed red blood cells (PRBCs) for up to 42 days before being transfused. During prolonged storage, PRBCs undergo biochemical changes. Research has shown that PRBCs can modulate the immune system of the recipient, which is referred to as transfusion-related immunomodulation. In particular, PRBCs suppressed T-cell proliferation via cell–cell contact in a dose-dependent manner (12Bernard A. Meier C. Ward M. Browning T. Montgomery A. Kasten M. Snow C. Manning E. Woodward J. Packed red blood cells suppress T-cell proliferation through a process involving cell-cell contact.J.

In vitro transfusion of red blood cells results in decreased cytokine production by human T cells.J. Trauma Acute Care Surg. 2014; 77: 198-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Moreover, RBC-derived extracellular vesicles induced both inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects (14Almizraq R.J. Norris P.J. Inglis H. Menocha S. Wirtz M.R. Juffermans N. Pandey S. Spinella P.C.

Similarly, conflicting results were reported in clinical studies of PRBC transfusion. Patients receiving intraoperative PRBCs had a higher risk to develop systemic inflammation (15Ferraris V.A.

Surg. 2013; 205: 457-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In line, extracellular vesicles from fresh and stored PRBCs may mediate a strong proinflammatory host response associated with an enhanced production of proinflammatory cytokines (16Menocha S.

Contrarily, in two other studies, PRBCs and hemolytic products of RBCs suppressed immune function in vitro and in vivo (19Martins R. Maier J. Gorki A.-D. Huber K.V.M. Sharif O. Starkl P. Saluzzo S.

Some of these differences may relate to alterations of RBC metabolism during storage or to specific patient populations (21Baron D.M. Lei C. Berra L.

Attenuation of canonical NF-κB signaling maintains function and stability of human Treg.FEBS J. 2021; 288: 640-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), focusing on distinct signaling events and/or transcriptional signatures. In this respect, modulation of receptor-mediated signaling cascades of T-cells has been linked with radical stress management and cell metabolism (5Franchina D.G. Dostert C. Brenner D. Reactive oxygen species: Involvement in T cell signaling and metabolism.Trends Immunol. 2018; 39: 489-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In the present investigation, we focused on a detailed analysis of the effects of PRBCs on T-cell activation using primary human cells. To determine the inhibitory effect of PRBCs on CD4+ T-cells, CD4+ T-cells were activated during incubation with increasing numbers of PRBCs. Expression of the activation markers CD25 (interleukin-2 [IL-2] receptor alpha chain) and CD69 (transmembrane C-type lectin) was used as readouts for early T-cell activation, since these two molecules are upregulated within the first hours following TCR stimulation. These activation markers were markedly reduced on stimulated CD4+ T-cells in coculture with PRBCs starting at a PRBC:CD4+ T-cell ratio of 12:1 (Fig. 1, A and B). At PRBC:CD4+ T-cell ratios greater than 50:1, CD25 and CD69 expression did not differ from that observed at a ratio of 50:1. Thus, we used a PRBC:CD4+ T-cell ratio of 50:1 for subsequent experiments (Fig. 1C). The proliferation rate of stimulated CD4+ T-cells was reduced in coculture with PRBCs (Fig. 1D). Similarly, PRBCs reduced the mRNA expression of the T-cell growth factor IL-2 (Fig. S1A) and Th1-, Th2-, and Th17-related cytokines (Fig. S1, B–D) in stimulated CD4+ T-cells. Furthermore, coculture with PRBCs reduced activation-induced mRNA expression levels of the transcription factor MYC (Fig. S1E), which is involved in metabolic reprogramming of activated T-cells as well as in T-cell growth and proliferation (28Wang R. Dillon C.P. Shi L.Z. Milasta S. Carter R. Finkelstein D. McCormick L.L. Fitzgerald P. Chi H. Munger J. Green D.R. The transcription factor Myc controls metabolic reprogramming upon T lymphocyte activation.Immunity. 2011; 35: 871-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). Monocytes, B-cells, or natural killer cells did not interfere with the inhibitory effect of PRBCs, as PRBCs in the presence of peripheral blood–derived mononuclear cells (PBMCs) also inhibited anti-CD3/anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody–mediated T-cell activation (Fig. S1F). Next, we compared the inhibitory effect of PRBCs on naïve and memory T-cells, as these cell types differ in their metabolic and functional states. PRBCs inhibited the activation of both naïve and memory T-cells (Fig. S1F). Previous studies have shown that heme, a major compound of hemoglobin, is released during hemolysis (29Roumenina L.T. Rayes J. Lacroix-Desmazes S. Dimitrov J.D. Heme: Modulator of plasma systems in hemolytic diseases.Trends Mol. Med. 2016; 22: 200-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Heme has immunomodulatory properties and strongly inhibits phagocytosis and migration of phagocytes (19Martins R. Maier J. Gorki A.-D. Huber K.V.M. Sharif O. Starkl P. Saluzzo S. Quattrone F. Gawish R. Lakovits K. Aichinger M.C. Radic-Sarikas B. Lardeau C.-H. Hladik A. Korosec A. et al.Heme drives hemolysis-induced susceptibility to infection via disruption of phagocyte functions.Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17: 1361-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested whether PRBC lysates containing heme or purified PRBC membranes would inhibit T-cell activation. In these experiments, only intact PRBCs were able to modulate activation-induced CD25 upregulation on T-cells (Figs. 1E and S2A) In addition, direct cell–to–cell contact of PRBCs and CD4+ T-cells was required, as the inhibitory effect was abolished when PRBCs and CD4+ T-cells were cocultured using transwell plates (Figs. 1F and S2B). Suppression of T-cell responses by PRBCs did not apparently induce Treg polarization or anergy since the expression of FOXP3 did not differ between stimulated CD4+ T cells incubated in the presence or the absence of PRBCs (Fig. 1G). Similarly, the anergy-associated factor p27kip1 (30Boussiotis V.A. Freeman G.J. Taylor P.A. Berezovskaya A. Grass I. Blazar B.R. Nadler L.M. p27kip1 functions as an anergy factor inhibiting interleukin 2 transcription and clonal expansion of alloreactive human and mouse helper T lymphocytes.Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) was not altered by coincubation with PRBCs (Fig. S2C). As the next step, we tested the ability of PRBCs stored for different periods to inhibit CD4+ T-cell activation. Storage duration had a minor effect on the ability of PRBCs to inhibit CD25 expression on CD4+ T-cells (Fig. S3A). Activated CD4+ T-cells secreted more IL-2 as storage duration of cocultured PRBCs increased, but even PRBCs stored until the regulatory limit of 42 days significantly inhibited IL-2 secretion (Fig. S3B). ROS produced by mitochondria are known to act as a critical second messenger for T-cell receptor signaling and T-cell activation and directly coregulate IL-2 production (31Sena L.A. Li S. Jairaman A. Prakriya M. Ezponda T. Hildeman D.A. Wang C.-R. Schumacker P.T. Licht J.D. Perlman H. Bryce P.J. Chandel N.S. Mitochondria are required for antigen-specific T cell activation through reactive oxygen species signaling.Immunity. 2013; 38: 225-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). PRBCs modulate redox activity and provide antioxidative protection in their microenvironment but may also exert prooxidative activities in human disease (32Minetti M. Malorni W. Redox control of red blood cell biology: The red blood cell as a target and source of prooxidant species.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2006; 8: 1165-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We therefore evaluated the influence of PRBCs on the oxidative potential of activated CD4+ T-cells. Activation-induced mitochondrial superoxide production was significantly reduced in the presence of PRBCs (Fig. 2A), which was corroborated by corresponding changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 2B). Similarly, total cellular ROS generated during T-cell activation was inhibited to levels of unstimulated CD4+ T-cells by coincubation with PRBCs (Fig. 2C). Proteomic analyses of PRBC identified 732 protein groups and indicate that redox proteins are highly expressed in PRBCs compared with CD4+ T-cells (Fig. 2D and Table S2). Accordingly, PRBC rapidly degraded hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (Fig. 2E). The enzymatic inhibitor sodium azide (NaN3) significantly slowed but did not completely inhibit degradation of H2O2 (Fig. 2E). To independently demonstrate the impact of redox modulation leading to CD4+ T-cell inhibition, we also performed activation assays in the presence of the antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) instead of PRBCs (Fig. S4, A–C). Both PRBCs and NAC reduced the number of CD25- and CD69-expressing CD4+ T-cells as well as the mRNA expression of IL-2 (Fig. S4, A and B, respectively). Phosphorylation of the TCR zeta chain (CD247) was increased following anti-CD3/anti-CD28–mediated TCR stimulation, an effect that was not modulated by PRBCs or NAC (Fig. S4C). Phosphoproteomic analyses of activated CD4+ T-cells in presence of PRBCs or NAC identified 2310 phosphopeptides corresponding to 691 phosphoprotein groups (Table S3). Mapping the differentially expressed phosphopeptides to kinase activities revealed key signaling events significantly triggered upon T-cell activation such as eight distinct MAP-kinases, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), cyclin-dependent kinase 5, ribosomal protein S6 kinase, among others (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, cell activation not only caused the activation of signaling cascades but also resulted in the significant suppression of kinase activities including three distinct casein kinases (Fig. 3A). Coincubation with PRBCs significantly reduced the kinase activities of five MAP kinases as well as cyclin-dependent kinase 5 and mTOR but apparently restored casein kinase activity (Fig. 3B). Treatment with NAC caused largely similar but less pronounced effects when compared with the effects of PRBCs (Fig. 3C). In order to illustrate to what extent the total kinome was affected by the treatments, kinome trees highlighting affected pathways are provided in Figures S5–S7 and Tables S4 and S5. In parallel to the global phosphoproteomic profiling, selected major TCR downstream signaling nodes of T-cell activation were assessed using intracellular (IC) flow cytometry. During T-cell activation, one of the earliest events following anti-CD3/anti-CD28–mediated TCR stimulation is the phosphorylation of the TCR zeta chain (CD247). PRBCs did not interfere with CD247 phosphorylation (Fig. 4A) or phosphorylation of zeta chain–associated protein kinase 70 (Fig. S4D) at a PRBC:T-cell ratio of 50:1. Of note, phosphorylation of major downstream targets including S6 ribosomal protein (S6; a downstream target of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway), p38, and NFkB were significantly reduced when CD4+ T-cells were activated in the presence of PRBCs (Fig. 4, B–D). In this study, we have confirmed that PRBCs inhibit T-cell activation. The observed effect was concentration dependent, indicating a well-defined dose–response relationship and thus a mechanistic background. The following experiments focused on the characterization of a molecular mechanism. In line with previous reports, the inhibitory effects were dependent on direct cell–cell contact rather than soluble factors. Phosphorylation of the TCR-associated zeta chain (CD247 pY142) was essentially unaffected by coincubation with PRBCs. Thus, we could rule out that binding of the stimulatory anti-CD3/anti-CD28 antibodies to their respective ligands was blocked by PRBCs. However, TCR downstream signaling events, such as phosphorylation of mTOR-related S6RP (pS240), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (pY182), and NFkB p65 (pS529), were inhibited by coincubation with PRBCs. Accordingly, we conclude that IC signaling events successfully initiated by stimulation of CD3/CD28 are blocked after initial signal transduction, and the main downstream targets were all inhibited. T-cell signaling events propagate efficiently when phosphatase activities are inhibited by oxidative modifications of critical cysteine residues mediated by ROS. RBCs have previously been described to express a catalytic ring of proteins counteracting oxidative stress, required for their oxygen transport capability without causing exuberant oxidative damage (33D'Alessandro A. Righetti P.G. Zolla L. The red blood cell proteome and interactome: An update.J. Proteome Res. 2010; 9: 144-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). As a consequence, we suggest that the immune-modulatory effects of PRBCs on T-cells are based on their ability to prevent formation of critical ROS levels in neighboring T-cells required for successful amplification of signaling events. In line with this hypothesis, coincubation with PRBCs suppressed IC mitochondrial superoxide and total ROS formation in T-cells. Furthermore, treatment with the antioxidant NAC largely replicated the inhibitory effects of PRBCs. Support for these functional observations was also provided by an untargeted phosphoproteomics method, which independently verified the observations obtained with flow cytometric analysis. We again interpret this finding as a consequence of the H2O2 dissipation capacity of PRBCs. The proposed model is fully compatible with and potentially explains all the apparently conflicting data reported and presented in previous studies. It is quite plausible that stressed old RBCs eventually release danger-associated molecular patterns mediating proinflammatory effects. These mechanisms are capable to trigger proinflammatory events, potentially by mainly acting as danger-associated molecular patterns on innate immune cells (34Mendonça R. Silveira A.A.A. Conran N. Red cell DAMPs and inflammation.Inflamm. Res. 2016; 65: 665-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Contrarily, direct cell–cell contact may mediate the anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects repeatedly reported by attenuating formation of ROS. From a chemical perspective, H2O2 is known to act as a second messenger (35Bienert G.P. Schjoerring J.K. Jahn T.P. Membrane transport of hydrogen peroxide.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1758: 994-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar) capable of crossing cell membranes facilitated by aquaporins (36Almasalmeh A. Krenc D. Wu B. Beitz E. Structural determinants of the hydrogen peroxide permeability of aquaporins.FEBS J. 2014; 281: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), which are known to be strongly expressed by activated T-cells (37Moon C. Rousseau R. Soria J.-C. Hoque M.O. Lee J. Jang S.J. Trink B. Sidransky D. Mao L. Aquaporin expression in human lymphocytes and dendritic cells.Am. J. Hematol. 2004; 75: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). RBC catalase, which dissipates H2O2, belongs to enzymes with the highest known turnover rates (38Ogura Y. Yamazaki I. Steady-state kinetics of the catalase reaction in the presence of cyanide.J. Biochem. 1983; 94: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These considerations may have far-reaching consequences, which obviously require further investigation in the future. Inflammatory signaling involves radical reactions, which are crucial for oxidation of phosphatases and for the formation of inflammatory mediators (39Closa D. Folch-Puy E. Oxygen free radicals and the systemic inflammatory response.IUBMB Life. 2004; 56: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). It is well recognized that inflammatory processes largely occur in the interstitium rather than full blood. Thus, RBCs may act as physiological buffers preventing inappropriate activation of T-cells during their migration phase from secondary lymphoid organs to the sites of inflammation. Once transmigrated to the interstitium free of RBCs, T-cells regain their full activation capacity and are therefore able to perform their effector functions. Thus, RBCs may also serve an important role in immune homeostasis. In this respect, especially solid tumors often present with increased RBC infiltration because of disorganized and inappropriate angiogenesis, which may support several features of tumorigenesis including deregulation of cellular energetics and avoiding immune destruction. T-cells are pivotal players in antitumor immunity and have high potency to even remove ongoing malignant processes. Given that many solid tumors display a high degree of vascular permeability due to disorganized angiogenesis, assessing the interaction between RBCs and T-cells may also impact future oncologic immunotherapies. In conclusion, we present a mechanistic model explaining how (P)RBCs might modulate immune functions, especially T-cell activation. This model has potential implications on pathomechanisms such as vessel leakiness in solid tumors and the resulting inhibition of anticancer immune functions. We suggest that radical reaction products may be detectable in interstitial fluids rather than full blood, potentially serving as inflammatory in situ biomarkers. The described findings might promote future studies highlighting the physiological consequences of RBC/T-cell interactions. The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee of the Medical University of Vienna (protocol number: EK1043/2015) and registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02639780). All experimental procedures were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki. Peripheral blood buffy coat samples of healthy donors were provided by the Austrian Red Cross (Vienna, Austria) upon written informed consent. PBMCs were isolated by standard Ficoll–Paque centrifugation. CD4+ T-cells were isolated using a MagniSort Human CD4 T-cell Enrichment Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturing instructions. Purity assessed by flow cytometry was above 95% for CD4+ T-cells. All functional assays were performed in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Gibco/Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Gibco), 10 μg/ml gentamycin (Gibco), and 1.25 μg/ml amphotericin B (Lonza).

To evaluate the role of APRT in the repair processes of cutaneous wounds in healthy skin and in diabetic patients, a diabetic mouse model (db/db) and age-matched wild-type mice were used. Moreover, the topical application of adenine was assessed. In vitro studies, analytical, histological, and immunohistochemical methods were used. Diabetic mice treated with adenine exhibited elevated ATP levels in organismic skin and accelerated wound healing. In vitro studies showed that APRT utilized adenine to rescue cellular ATP levels and proliferation from hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative damage. HPLC-ESI-MS/MS-based analysis of total adenylate nucleotides in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts demonstrated that adenine addition enlarged the cellular adenylate pool, reduced the adenylate energy charge, and provided additional AMP for the further generation of ATP. These data indicate an upregulation of APRT in skin wounds, highlighting its role during the healing of diabetic wounds through regulation of the nucleotide pool after injury. Furthermore, topical adenine supplementation resulted in an enlargement of the adenylate pool needed for the generation of ATP, an important molecule for wound repair."

However, how the Tudor domain of ARID4B differs from that of ARID4A remains unknown. Here, we found that the ARID4B Tudor domain has significantly weaker DNA affinity than the ARID4A Tudor domain despite sharing more than 80% sequence identity. Structure determination and DNA titration analysis indicated that the ARID4B Tudor domain is also an interdigitated double Tudor domain with a DNA-binding surface similar to ARID4A. We identified a residue close to the DNA-binding site of the Tudor domain that differs between ARID4A and ARID4B. The Leu50 in ARID4A is Glu50 in ARID4B, and the latter forms salt bridges with two lysine residues at the DNA-binding surface. This causes a decrease in the strength of positive charge, thus reducing DNA-binding affinity while significantly increasing protein stability. We also found that a C-terminal extension region enhances the DNA-binding affinity of the ARID4B Tudor domain. This C-terminal extension is disordered and contains a positively charged RGR motif, providing an additional DNA-binding site. Finally, sequence and phylogenetic analyses indicated that the residue differences and the presence of the RGR extension region are conserved. These results provide new insight into the functional differences between ARID4A and ARID4B proteins, as well as elucidating the function of the disordered regions in these proteins."
https://openalex.org/W3133973596,"Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a disease of wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) that causes major yield losses in South America, as well as many other wheat growing regions around the world. FHB results in low quality, contaminated grain due to the production of mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol (DON). In Brazil, FHB outbreaks are increasing in frequency and are currently controlled by fungicides which are costly and potentially harmful to the wider environment. To identify the genetic basis of resistance to FHB in Brazilian wheat, two mapping populations (Anahuac 75 × BR 18-Terena and BR 18-Terena × BRS 179) segregating for FHB resistance were phenotyped and quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis was undertaken to identify genomic regions associated with FHB-related traits. A total of 14 QTL associated with FHB visual symptoms were identified, each of which explained 3.7–17.3% of the phenotypic variance. Two of these QTL were stable across environments. This suggests FHB resistance in Anahuac 75, BR 18-Terena and BRS 179 is controlled by multiple genetic loci that confer relatively minor differences in resistance. A major, novel QTL associated with DON accumulation was also identified on chromosome 4B (17.8% of the phenotypic variance), as well as a major QTL associated with thousand-grain weight on chromosome 6B (16.8% phenotypic variance). These QTL could be useful breeding targets, when pyramided with major sources of resistance such as Fhb1 , to improve grain quality and reduce the reliance on fungicides in Brazil and other countries affected by FHB."
https://openalex.org/W3134339944,"Obesity is a major risk factor for various chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer; hence, there is an urgent need for an effective strategy to prevent this disorder. Currently, the anti-obesity effects of food ingredients are drawing attention. Therefore, we focused on carob, which has high antioxidant capacity and various physiological effects, and examined its anti-obesity effect. Carob is cultivated in the Mediterranean region, and its roasted powder is used as a substitute for cocoa powder. We investigated the effect of carob pod polyphenols (CPPs) on suppressing increases in adipose tissue weight and adipocyte hypertrophy in high fat diet-induced obesity model mice, and the mechanism by which CPPs inhibit the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into adipocytes in vitro . In an in vivo experimental system, we revealed that CPPs significantly suppressed the increase in adipose tissue weight and adipocyte hypertrophy. Moreover, in an in vitro experimental system, CPPs acted at the early stage of differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and suppressed cell proliferation because of differentiation induction. They also suppressed the expression of transcription factors involved in adipocyte differentiation, thereby reducing triacylglycerol synthesis ability and triglycerol (TG) accumulation. Notably, CPPs regulated CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP)β, which is expressed at the early stage of differentiation, at the posttranscriptional level. These results demonstrate that CPPs suppress the differentiation of adipocytes through the posttranscriptional regulation of C/EBPβ and may serve as an effective anti-obesity compound."
https://openalex.org/W3135104824,"Cells can switch between Rac1 (lamellipodia-based) and RhoA (blebbing-based) migration modes, but the molecular mechanisms regulating this shift are not fully understood. Diacylglycerol kinase ζ (DGKζ), which phosphorylates diacylglycerol to yield phosphatidic acid, forms independent complexes with Rac1 and RhoA, selectively dissociating each from their common inhibitor RhoGDI. DGKζ catalytic activity is required for Rac1 dissociation but is dispensable for RhoA dissociation; instead, DGKζ stimulates RhoA release via a kinase-independent scaffolding mechanism. The molecular determinants that mediate the selective targeting of DGKζ to Rac1 or RhoA signaling complexes are unknown. Here, we show that protein kinase Cα (PKCα)-mediated phosphorylation of the DGKζ MARCKS domain increased DGKζ association with RhoA and decreased its interaction with Rac1. The same modification also enhanced DGKζ interaction with the scaffold protein syntrophin. Expression of a phosphomimetic DGKζ mutant stimulated membrane blebbing in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and C2C12 myoblasts, which was augmented by inhibition of endogenous Rac1. DGKζ expression in differentiated C2 myotubes, which have low endogenous Rac1 levels, also induced substantial membrane blebbing via the RhoA-ROCK pathway. These events were independent of DGKζ catalytic activity, but dependent upon a functional C-terminal PDZ-binding motif. Rescue of RhoA activity in DGKζ-null cells also required the PDZ-binding motif, suggesting that syntrophin interaction is necessary for optimal RhoA activation.

Rho GTPases are molecular switches that control a wide variety of signal transduction pathways in eukaryotic cells. They are best known for their pivotal role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton, but they also influence cell polarity, microtubule dynamics, membrane transport pathways, and cell cycle progression (1Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Rho GTPases in cell biology.Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3659) Google Scholar). These biological functions of the Rho proteins are critically important during tissue morphogenesis events required for the normal development of multicellular organisms and have decisive roles in the invasion and metastasis of cancer cells (2Vega F.M. Ridley A.J. Rho GTPases in cancer cell biology.FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 2093-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). In cultured mammalian cells, Rac1 promotes actin polymerization and focal complex assembly leading to lamellipodia protrusion and membrane ruffle formation, while RhoA promotes the assembly of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions (3Ridley A.J.

The active forms interact with specific downstream effectors to elicit distinct biological responses. Rho GTPase activity is tightly regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which activate Rho proteins by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP; by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which inactivate Rho proteins by enhancing their intrinsic GTPase activity; and by guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs), which sequester Rho proteins as soluble cytosolic complexes and prevent the association of their C-terminal lipid moieties with the plasma membrane (6Dermardirossian C.

In mammals, diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs) constitute a family of ten related isozymes with the same catalytic activity; they phosphorylate diacylglycerol (DAG) to yield phosphatidic acid (PA), but their structural diversity and different cellular localizations suggest that different isoforms modify distinct DAG signaling events and are regulated by distinct molecular mechanisms (8Cai J. Abramovici H. Gee S.H. Topham M.K. Diacylglycerol kinases as sources of phosphatidic acid.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1791: 942-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The type IV DGKs, which include the ι and ζ isoforms, contain two atypical C1 domains, a motif similar to the phosphorylation-site domain of the myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate, four ankyrin repeats, and a C-terminal PDZ-binding motif (8Cai J.

DGKζ is ubiquitously expressed and participates in a variety of signaling pathways, where it negatively regulates proteins activated by DAG or stimulates proteins activated by PA. Accumulating evidence suggests that DGKζ regulates its target proteins locally, within multiprotein signaling complexes. Our previous studies demonstrate that DGKζ forms independent signaling complexes with both Rac1 and RhoA and plays a central role in their activation by dissociating them from their common inhibitor, RhoGDI (9Abramovici H.

We first showed that DGKζ is a key component of a signaling complex that includes Rac1, RhoGDI, and the serine/threonine kinase PAK1, which together function as a Rac1-selective, RhoGDI dissociation factor. In response to growth factor stimulation, DGKζ stimulates the conversion of DAG into PA, which stimulates PAK1 activity (9Abramovici H. Mojtabaie P. Parks R.J. Zhong X.P. Koretzky G.A. Topham M.K.

A catalytically inactive DGKζ mutant was unable to rescue the decrease in Rac1 activity in DGKζ-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), consistent with the requirement of DGKζ enzymatic activity for Rac1 activation via this mechanism. DGKζ is also a component of a distinct signaling complex that includes RhoA, RhoGDI, and the serine/threonine kinase protein kinase Cα (PKCα) that functions as a RhoA-selective, RhoGDI dissociation factor (10Ard R. Mulatz K. Abramovici H. Maillet J.C. Fottinger A. Foley T. Byham M.R. Iqbal T.A. Yoneda A. Couchman J.R. Parks R.J. Gee S.H. Diacylglycerol kinase zeta regulates RhoA activation via a kinase-independent scaffolding mechanism.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2012; 23: 4008-4019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RhoA release is mediated by PKCα phosphorylation on RhoGDI Ser-34, which uses a noncanonical method of PKCα activation stimulated by uncleaved phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI[4,5])P2 (13Dovas A. Choi Y. Yoneda A. Multhaupt H.A. Kwon S.H. Kang D. Oh E.S. Couchman J.R.

However, in contrast to Rac1 regulation, DGKζ catalytic activity is dispensable for RhoA-RhoGDI dissociation, suggesting that it functions primarily as a scaffold to enhance RhoGDI phosphorylation by PKCα (10Ard R. Mulatz K. Abramovici H. Maillet J.C. Fottinger A. Foley T. Byham M.R. Iqbal T.A. Yoneda A. Couchman J.R. Parks R.J. Gee S.H. Diacylglycerol kinase zeta regulates RhoA activation via a kinase-independent scaffolding mechanism.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2012; 23: 4008-4019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular determinants that mediate selective binding of DGKζ to either Rac1 or RhoA are unknown. DGKζ and PKCα exist in a regulated signaling complex, wherein DGKζ inhibits PKCα activity by metabolizing DAG, a cognate PKCα activator (14Luo B. Prescott S.M. Topham M.K. Association of diacylglycerol kinase {zeta} with protein kinase C {alpha}: Spatial regulation of diacylglycerol signaling.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 929-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). DGKζ contains a motif similar to the phosphorylation-site domain of the myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS) protein (15Aderem A. The MARCKS brothers: A family of protein kinase C substrates.Cell. 1992; 71: 713-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), a Ser/Thr-rich region phosphorylated by PKCα (16Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M. Protein kinase C regulates the nuclear localization of diacylglycerol kinase-zeta.Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). PKCα-mediated phosphorylation of this motif in DGKζ abolishes their interaction and impairs PKCα regulation, allowing unfettered PKCα activity (14Luo B. Prescott S.M. Topham M.K. Association of diacylglycerol kinase {zeta} with protein kinase C {alpha}: Spatial regulation of diacylglycerol signaling.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 929-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The MARCKS domain in DGKζ is also a bipartite nuclear localization signal; its phosphorylation negatively regulates DGKζ nuclear localization (16Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M. Protein kinase C regulates the nuclear localization of diacylglycerol kinase-zeta.Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of this motif also enhances the translocation of cytoplasmic DGKζ to the plasma membrane where its substrate DAG is available (17Santos T. Carrasco S. Jones D.R. Merida I. Eguinoa A. Dynamics of diacylglycerol kinase zeta translocation in living T-cells. Study of the structural domain requirements for translocation and activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30300-30309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 18Abramovici H. Hogan A.B. Obagi C. Topham M.K. Gee S.H. Diacylglycerol kinase-zeta localization in skeletal muscle is regulated by phosphorylation and interaction with syntrophins.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4499-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Despite elevated plasma membrane localization, MARCKS domain phosphorylation reduces DGKζ enzymatic activity by ∼50% (19Luo B. Prescott S.M. Topham M.K. Protein kinase C alpha phosphorylates and negatively regulates diacylglycerol kinase zeta.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39542-39547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, PKCα-mediated phosphorylation of the MARCKS domain has pleiotropic effects on DGKζ function. Since DGKζ is common to both Rac1 and RhoA dissociation mechanisms, we surmised that signals regulating DGKζ activity help to control the balance of Rac1 and Rho activity. Here, we investigated the impact of DGKζ MARCKS domain phosphorylation on the selective regulation of Rac1 and RhoA signaling. We demonstrate that PKCα-mediated phosphorylation of the MARCKS domain increases the interaction of DGKζ with RhoA and with the PDZ domain of α1-syntrophin, while simultaneously decreasing its interaction with Rac1. A DGKζ mutant that mimics MARCKS domain phosphorylation, in conjunction with reduced Rac1 activity, preferentially activated RhoA-driven membrane blebbing, which was dependent upon the DGKζ C-terminal PDZ-binding motif that mediates association with syntrophin. Collectively, these findings reveal a mechanism for the selective binding of DGKζ to Rac1 or RhoA and suggest MARCKS domain phosphorylation functions as an intramolecular switch that triggers conformational changes that activate RhoA over Rac1. We first examined whether PKC activity affects the interaction of DGKζ with the Rho GTPases RhoA and Rac1. To specifically assess the impact of PKC activity on the DGKζ/RhoA interaction, we monitored the binding of exogenous, HA-tagged wild-type DGKζ from lysates of MEFs to recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of constitutively active (RhoAV14) and inactive (RhoAN19) versions of RhoA. Treatment with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), a potent PKC activator, for 30 min prior to harvesting increased HA-DGKζ binding to GST-RhoAV14 and GST-RhoAN19 by approximately twofold compared with vehicle control (Fig. 1, A–D). The increase in binding was blocked by the specific PKCα/β inhibitor Gö6976 indicating that PKC catalytic activity mediates this effect. Under the same conditions, PMA treatment caused GST-Rac1V12 to capture substantially less HA-DGKζ than controls (Fig. 1, E and F), consistent with our previous findings (20Yakubchyk Y. Abramovici H. Maillet J.C. Daher E. Obagi C. Parks R.J. Topham M.K. Gee S.H. Regulation of neurite outgrowth in N1E-115 cells through PDZ-mediated recruitment of diacylglycerol kinase zeta.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7289-7302Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Again, this effect was blocked by PKCα/β inhibition. These data suggest that PKCα/β-mediated phosphorylation simultaneously increases DGKζ binding to RhoA while decreasing binding to Rac1. We showed previously that a DGKζ mutant (DGKζM1) in which all four serine residues in the MARCKS domain were changed to aspartate to mimic phosphorylation (16Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M.

Cell. 2003; 14: 4499-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) bound less efficiently to Rac1V12 than wild-type DGKζ (20Yakubchyk Y. Abramovici H. Maillet J.C. Daher E. Obagi C. Parks R.J. Topham M.K. Gee S.H. Regulation of neurite outgrowth in N1E-115 cells through PDZ-mediated recruitment of diacylglycerol kinase zeta.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7289-7302Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Here, we compared the binding of HA-tagged wild-type DGKζ and DGKζM1 to RhoA. GST-RhoAV14 and, to a lesser extent, GST-RhoAN19, captured substantially more HA-DGKζM1 than wild-type HA-DGKζ, suggesting that MARCKS domain phosphorylation increases the interaction of DGKζ with RhoA (Fig. 1, G and H). In the same experiment, GST-Rac1V12 captured wild-type DGKζ but no detectable DGKζM1, while GST-Rac1N17 captured approximately equivalent amounts of both proteins. Neither protein was captured by GST alone, suggesting that the interactions between DGKζ and these Rho GTPases are specific. Collectively, these findings suggest that PKCα/β-mediated phosphorylation of the MARCKS domain switches the binding preference of DGKζ from Rac1 to RhoA. DGKζ contains a C-terminal PDZ-binding motif that mediates interaction with the syntrophin family of PDZ domain-containing scaffold proteins (21Hogan A. Shepherd L. Chabot J. Quenneville S. Prescott S.M. Topham M.K. Gee S.H. Interaction of gamma 1-syntrophin with diacylglycerol kinase-zeta. Regulation of nuclear localization by PDZ interactions.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26526-26533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To investigate whether PKC activity affects their interaction, cells infected with HA-DGKζWT were treated with vehicle or PMA. The detergent-solubilized cell lysates were incubated with a GST fusion protein of the α1-syntrophin PDZ domain (GST-α1-PDZ) and the amount of bound DGKζ was detected by immunoblotting with an anti-HA antibody. HA-DGKζ binding to GST-α1-PDZ was significantly increased following PMA stimulation (Fig. 2, A and B). Applying Gö6976 prior to PMA stimulation reduced the interaction, demonstrating that PKCα/β activity is required for this effect. These results suggest that PKCα/β-dependent activity positively regulates the interaction of DGKζ with the α1-syntrophin PDZ domain. To determine if MARCKS domain phosphorylation by PKC specifically accounts for the observed increase in DGKζ binding to α1-PDZ following PMA stimulation, we compared the binding of α1-PDZ with DGKζWT and DGKζM1. Lysates of transiently transfected -type MEFs were incubated with GST alone or GST-α1-PDZ and bound DGKζ was detected and quantified as above. Substantially more DGKζM1 (∼2.5-fold) bound to α1-PDZ than did DGKζWT, despite equivalent levels of expression (Fig. 2, C and D). These data suggest that MARCKS domain phosphorylation accounts for the PMA-induced increase in binding to the α1-PDZ domain. To confirm that MARCKS domain phosphorylation affects the interaction of DGKζ with full-length, endogenous syntrophins, lysates of cells infected with either HA-DGKζWT or HA-DGKζM1 were immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody and the immune complexes analyzed by immunoblotting with a pan-specific syntrophin monoclonal antibody (22Froehner S.C. Adams M.E. Peters M.F. Gee S.H. Syntrophins: Modular adapter proteins at the neuromuscular junction and the sarcolemma.Soc. Gen. Physiol. Ser. 1997; 52: 197-207PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, syntrophins coimmunoprecipitated with HA-DGKζM1 but not with HA-DGKζWT, despite the fact that roughly equivalent levels were immunoprecipitated by the anti-HA antibody (Fig. 2E). Syntrophins were not precipitated by control IgG suggesting that the interaction is specific. These results that suggest MARCKS domain phosphorylation promotes DGKζ interaction with syntrophin. Taken together, these findings reveal that MARCKS domain phosphorylation is an important regulatory switch that favors the interaction of DGKζ with RhoA and syntrophin. Since DGKζM1 preferentially interacts with RhoA, we tested if its exogenous expression in MEFs would activate the RhoA-ROCK signaling pathway involved in membrane blebbing, a well-characterized downstream effect of RhoA activity. The majority of cells expressing HA-DGKζM1 were well spread, consistent with Rac1, and not RhoA, activation; however, approximately 20% of the cells had blebs, roughly twice as many as in the uninfected MEF control (Fig. 3, A and B). Since Rac1 activity suppresses RhoA signaling (23Nguyen L.K. Kholodenko B.N. von Kriegsheim A. Rac1 and RhoA: Networks, loops and bistability.Small GTPases. 2018; 9: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that DGKζM1 expression and inhibition of Rac1 activity might lead to a further increase in blebbing. Indeed, Rac1 inhibition with 100 μM NSC 23766 in DGKζM1-expressing cells substantially increased the percentage of those with blebs (Fig. 3, A and B). When MEFs were infected with an adenovirus encoding a constitutively active RhoA mutant, RhoAV14, approximately 60% of cells had membrane blebs. The percentage of MEFs infected with the dominant-negative RhoA mutant, RhoAN17, which underwent blebbing, was not significantly different from uninfected control cells (Fig. 3B). Similar results were also obtained in C2C12 mouse myoblasts, in which treatment of cells expressing either DGKζWT or DGKζM1 with NSC 23766 led to an increase in the percentage of cells with blebs (Fig. 3C). To bolster the idea that Rac1 inactivation leads to increased blebbing, C2 myoblasts were cotransfected with HA-DGKζM1 and a myc-tagged inactive Rac1 mutant, Rac1N17, which functions as a dominant negative by sequestering available GEFs, preventing activation of endogenous Rac1 (24Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Proteins regulating Ras and its relatives.Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar). C2 cells coexpressing HA-DGKζM1 and myc-Rac1N17 had many, large membrane blebs. Rac1N17 and DGKζM1 were colocalized on bleb membranes, and DGKζM1 was additionally found in the bleb cytosol (Fig. 3D, top panels). In contrast, coexpression of DGKζM1 with a constitutively active Rac1 mutant, Rac1V12, induced the formation of large macropinosomes consistent with our previous studies (25Ard R. Mulatz K. Pomoransky J.L. Parks R.J. Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Bell J.C. Gee S.H. Regulation of macropinocytosis by diacylglycerol kinase ζ.PLoS One. 2015; 10e0144942Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Although DGKζM1 has reduced kinase activity and preferentially associates with RhoA, taken together, our finding suggests it continues to activate sufficient levels of Rac1 to promote macropinocytosis. However, when Rac1 is inactive or unavailable, DGKζM1 drives membrane blebbing. Rac1 activity is high in proliferating C2 myoblasts and decreases during differentiation and fusion of myoblasts into multinucleated muscle fibers (26Heller H. Gredinger E. Bengal E. Rac1 inhibits myogenic differentiation by preventing the complete withdrawal of myoblasts from the cell cycle.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37307-37316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We took advantage of this natural occurring change in Rac1 levels to study the effect of exogenous DGKζ expression, driven by adenoviral infection, on membrane blebbing. An adenovirus-bearing green fluorescent protein (GFP), used as a control, only induced minimal blebbing in infected C2 myotubes (Fig. 4, B and C). In contrast, HA-DGKζWT expression was sufficient to promote extensive blebbing in myotubes (Fig. 4, B and C). DGKζM1 and the catalytically inactive DGKζ mutant (DGKζΔATP) induced blebbing to approximately the same extent as DGKζWT (Fig. 4, A–C). These results are consistent with RhoA activation being independent of DGKζ kinase activity, as we previously reported (10Ard R. Mulatz K. Abramovici H. Maillet J.C. Fottinger A. Foley T. Byham M.R. Iqbal T.A. Yoneda A. Couchman J.R. Parks R.J. Gee S.H. Diacylglycerol kinase zeta regulates RhoA activation via a kinase-independent scaffolding mechanism.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2012; 23: 4008-4019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test the effect of the DGKζ C-terminal PDZ-binding motif, we used the DGKζFLAG mutant, which has an appended FLAG epitope tag that prevents interaction of the motif with syntrophin PDZ domains (Fig. 4A) (21Hogan A. Shepherd L. Chabot J. Quenneville S. Prescott S.M. Topham M.K. Gee S.H. Interaction of gamma 1-syntrophin with diacylglycerol kinase-zeta. Regulation of nuclear localization by PDZ interactions.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26526-26533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Despite being expressed at levels equivalent to the other DGKζ constructs, DGKζFLAG did not induce blebbing in myotubes above the level induced by GFP (Fig. 4C). These data show that DGKζ expression in myotubes, which have low endogenous Rac1 activity, induces substantial membrane blebbing that depends on the DGKζ–syntrophin interaction. Finally, to verify that blebbing resulting from DGKζ expression involves the activation of canonical RhoA signaling, we treated DGKζ-expressing myotubes with Y-27632, an inhibitor specific to the RhoA effector ROCK. DGKζM1-induced blebbing in myotubes was completely blocked by treatment with 10 μM Y-27632, demonstrating that DGKζ activates the RhoA-ROCK signaling pathway upstream of membrane blebbing (Fig. 5).Figure 5DGKζ-induced membrane blebbing is dependent on ROCK activity.

Mulatz K. Abramovici H. Maillet J.C. Fottinger A. Foley T. Byham M.R. Iqbal T.A. Yoneda A. Couchman J.R. Parks R.J. Gee S.H. Diacylglycerol kinase zeta regulates RhoA activation via a kinase-independent scaffolding mechanism.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2012; 23: 4008-4019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We assayed the level of GTP-bound (active) RhoA in lysates of uninfected null cells or null cells infected with adenovirus harboring HA-tagged DGKζWT, DGKζΔATP, or DGKζFLAG using an effector pull-down assay (27Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. Regulation of the small GTP-binding protein Rho by cell adhesion and the cytoskeleton.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). RhoA activity was increased approximately twofold in lysates of null cells infected with either DGKζWT or DGKζΔATP but RhoA activity in DGKζFLAG-expressing cells was not significantly different from uninfected DGKζ-null cells. In the same experiment, DGKζWT and DGKζFLAG increased Rac1 activity by approximately twofold, whereas DGKζΔATP failed to rescue Rac1 activity, consistent with our previously published findings (10Ard R. Mulatz K. Abramovici H. Maillet J.C. Fottinger A. Foley T. Byham M.R. Iqbal T.A. Yoneda A. Couchman J.R. Parks R.J. Gee S.H. Diacylglycerol kinase zeta regulates RhoA activation via a kinase-independent scaffolding mechanism.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2012; 23: 4008-4019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that a functional PDZ-binding motif is required for DGKζ-induced RhoA activation but is dispensable for Rac1 activation. The Rho GTPases Rac1 and RhoA are sequestered in separate signaling complexes bound to their common inhibitor RhoGDI, which maintains them in their inactive state. Their selective dissociation from RhoGDI allows the precise control of downstream responses such as changes in actin organ"

Following Hyland’s framework of stance, this study investigated the distribution of stance markers in two different genres: medical research articles (medical RA) and newspaper opinion columns (newspaper OC). The corpus constructed for the investigation includes 52 medical research articles and 175 newspaper opinion articles, which were both written in English and published from January to April in 2020 with the topic focusing on COVID-19. The findings of this study demonstrated that the occurrences of stance markers in newspaper OC were far more frequent than those in medical RA, indicating the different conventions of these two genres. Despite the significant difference in the occurrences of stance markers between the two sub-corpora, similarities of the most frequent stance markers in two genres were also highlighted. The study indicated that the topic content seems to play an important role in shaping the way of how writers construct their stance. The lack of information or evidence on the topic of COVID-19 could restrain writers from making high degree of commitment to their claims, which make them adopt a more tentative stance to qualify their statements."
https://openalex.org/W3134518450,"β-Sitosterol 3- O - d -glucoside (BSG) is known to act as an agonist by binding to estrogen receptors, and estrogen has been reported to enhance the activity of β-glucocerebrosidase, an epidermal ceramide metabolizing enzyme. In this study, we determined whether BSG up-regulates ceramide levels in the stratum corneum (SC) of a reconstructed human epidermal keratinization (RHEK) model. Treatment with BSG significantly increased the total ceramide content by 1.2-fold compared to that in the control in the SC of the RHEK model, accompanied by a significant increase of the ceramide species, Cer[EOS] by 2.1-fold compared to that in the control. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that BSG significantly up-regulated the mRNA expression levels of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT)2, ceramide synthase (CerS)3, glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) and acid sphingomyelinase by 1.41–1.89, 1.35–1.44, 1.19 and 2.06-fold, respectively, compared to that in the control in the RHEK model. Meanwhile, BSG significantly down-regulated the mRNA expression levels of sphingomyelin synthase (SMS)2 by 0.87–0.89-fold. RT-PCR analysis also demonstrated that BSG significantly up-regulated the mRNA expression levels of CerS3 and GCS by 1.19–1.55 and 1.20-fold, respectively, but not of SPT2 and significantly down-regulated that of SMS2 by 0.74-fold in HaCaT keratinocytes. Western blotting analysis revealed that BSG significantly increased the protein expression levels of CerS3 and GCS by 1.78 and 1.28–1.32-fold, respectively, compared to that in the control in HaCaT cells. These findings indicate that BSG stimulates ceramide synthesis via the up-regulated expression levels of CerS3 and GCS in the glucosylceramide pathway, which results in a significantly increased level of total ceramides in the SC accompanied by significantly increased levels of acylceramide species such as Cer[EOS]."
https://openalex.org/W3135695736,"The vaginal microbiota is known to impact women's health, but the biological factors that influence the composition of the microbiota are not fully understood. We previously observed that levels of glycogen in the lumen of the vagina were higher in women that had a high body mass index (BMI). Vaginal glycogen is thought to impact the composition of the vaginal microbiota. We therefore sought to determine if BMI was associated having or not having bacterial vaginosis (BV), as determined by the Amsel criteria. We also hypothesized that increased blood glucose levels could lead to the previously-observed higher vaginal glycogen levels and therefore investigated if hemoglobin A1c levels were associated with BV. We analyzed data from the Women's Interagency HIV Study using multiple multivariable (GEE) logistic regression models to assess the relationship between BMI, BV and blood glucose. Women with a BMI >30 kg/m2 (obese) had a lower rate (multivariable adjusted OR 0.87 (0.79-0.97), p = 0.009) of BV compared to the reference group (BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m2). There was a significantly lower rate of BV in post-menopausal obese women compared to the post-menopausal reference group, but not in pre-menopausal women. HIV- post-menopausal obese women had a significantly lower rate of BV, but this was not seen in HIV+ post-menopausal obese women. Pre-menopausal women with a higher hemoglobin A1c (≥6.5%) had a significantly lower rate (multivariable adjusted OR 0.66 (0.49-0.91), p = 0.010) of BV compared to pre-menopausal women with normal hemoglobin A1c levels (<5.7%), but there was no difference in post-menopausal women. This study shows an inverse association of BMI with BV in post-menopausal women and hemoglobin A1c with BV in pre-menopausal women. Further studies are needed to confirm these relationships in other cohorts across different reproductive stages and to identify underlying mechanisms for these observed associations."
https://openalex.org/W3134019481,"Smad2 and Smad3 (Smad2/3) are structurally similar proteins that primarily mediate the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling responsible for driving cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. The dynamics of the Smad2/3 phosphorylation provide the key mechanism for regulating the TGF-β signaling pathway, but the details surrounding this phosphorylation remain unclear. Here, using in vitro kinase assay coupled with mass spectrometry, we identified for the first time that nemo-like kinase (NLK) regulates TGF-β signaling via modulation of Smad2/3 phosphorylation in the linker region. TGF-β-mediated transcriptional and cellular responses are suppressed by NLK overexpression, whereas NLK depletion exerts opposite effects. Specifically, we discovered that NLK associates with Smad3 and phosphorylates the designated serine residues located in the linker region of Smad2 and Smad3, which inhibits phosphorylation at the C terminus, thereby decreasing the duration of TGF-β signaling. Overall, this work demonstrates that phosphorylation on the linker region of Smad2/3 by NLK counteracts the canonical phosphorylation in response to TGF-β signals, thus providing new insight into the mechanisms governing TGF-β signaling transduction."
https://openalex.org/W3134213249,"Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) is a B-cell-derived malignant neoplasia that has a unique histological distribution, in which the scarce malignant Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells are surrounded by nonmalignant inflammatory cells. The interactions between the malignant and inflammatory cells are mediated by aberrantly produced cytokines, which play an important role in tumor immunopathogenesis. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding cytokines and their regulatory proteins may influence the peripheral levels of these molecules and affect disease’s pathobiology. In this study, we evaluate SNPs in the promoter regions of the genes encoding for two key cytokines in Hodgkin lymphoma: IL-10 (SNP/p IL10 –592, rs1800872; and SNP/p IL10 –1082, rs1800896) and TNF-α (SNP/p TNF -238, rs361525; and SNP/p TNF -862, rs1800630), as well as an SNP in the intronic region of the NFκB1 gene (SNP/i NFKB1 , rs1585215 ), an important regulator of cytokine gene expression. We then look to their possible association with clinical and laboratory features in cHL patients. Seventy-three patients with cHL are genotyped by qPCR-high resolution melting. The SNPs’ genotypes are analyzed individually for each SNP, and when more than two allelic combinations are identified, the genotypes are also divided into two groups according to proposed biological relevance. By univariate analysis, patients harboring SNP/p TNF -238 AG genotype more frequently have EBV-associated cHL compared to homozygous GG, whereas the presence of mediastinal disease (bulky and nonbulky) is more common in the p IL10 –592 AC/CC group compared to the AA homozygous group. Patients with SNP/i NFKB1 AA genotype more frequently have stage IV and extranodal disease at diagnosis. These results indicate that some SNPs’ genotypes for IL-10 and TNF-α genes are associated with prognostic parameters in cHL. For the first time, the SNP/i NFKB1 is described in association with clinical features of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W3134250661,"Polyphosphates (polyPs), chains of phosphate residues found in species across nature from bacteria to mammals, were recently reported to accelerate the amyloid fibril formation of many proteins. How polyPs facilitate this process, however, remains unknown. To gain insight into their mechanisms, we used various physicochemical approaches to examine the effects of polyPs of varying chain lengths on ultrasonication-dependent α-synuclein (α-syn) amyloid formation. Although orthophosphate and diphosphate exhibited a single optimal concentration of amyloid formation, triphosphate and longer-chain phosphates exhibited two optima, with the second at a concentration lower than that of orthophosphate or diphosphate. The second optimum decreased markedly as the polyP length increased. This suggested that although the optima at lower polyP concentrations were caused by interactions between negatively charged phosphate groups and the positive charges of α-syn, the optima at higher polyP concentrations were caused by the Hofmeister salting-out effects of phosphate groups, where the effects do not depend on the net charge. NMR titration experiments of α-syn with tetraphosphate combined with principal component analysis revealed that, at low tetraphosphate concentrations, negatively charged tetraphosphates interacted with positively charged “KTK” segments in four KTKEGV repeats located at the N-terminal region. At high concentrations, hydrated tetraphosphates affected the surface-exposed hydrophilic groups of compact α-syn. Taken together, our results suggest that long-chain polyPs consisting of 60 to 70 phosphates induce amyloid formation at sub-μM concentrations, which are comparable with the concentrations of polyPs in the blood or tissues.

We examined the effects of polyPs of varying chain length on α-syn amyloid formation, revealing two concentration regions of amyloid acceleration. The lower and higher polyP concentrations promoted amyloid formation by attractive charge–charge interactions between positive groups of α-syn and negative polyPs and Hofmeister salting-out effects, respectively. As the former occurs at polyP concentrations comparable with those in vivo, polyPs are likely to play important roles in the pathogenesis of amyloid-related diseases. This study extends the view of amyloid formation on the basis of solubility and supersaturation. We examined the amyloid formation of α-syn in the presence of polyPs with varying chain lengths: orthophosphate (orthoP), diphosphate (diP), triphosphate (triP), tetraphosphate (tetraP), short polyphosphate consisting of 10 to 15 phosphates (polyP-S) and long polyphosphate consisting of 60 to 70 phosphates (polyP-L) (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1).

According to the solubility and supersaturation mechanism, the solubility of α-syn was higher than 0.1 mg/ml. At 200 to 325 mM orthoP, the ThT fluorescence increased markedly after a lag time of several hours, suggesting that the solubility decreased below 0.1 mg/ml. However, at concentrations higher than 450 mM orthoP, the ThT fluorescence did not increase, when amorphous aggregates were likely to be formed (see below). The profile of diP-dependent acceleration and inhibition was similar to that of orthoP, although the concentrations to induce amyloid formation (100–200 mM) were lower than those of orthoP (Fig. S1A). For other polyPs with higher phosphate numbers, we observed more complicated profiles with an additional region of acceleration at the lower concentrations (Fig. 1, C and D and Fig. S1, B and C). By fitting the ThT profiles observed for different polyPs to Gaussian curves, we determined the optimal concentrations for amyloid formation (Fig. 1, E–G and Fig. S1, F–H). As for orthoP, the optimal concentration for the major peak was approximately 270 mM and the minor peak, which was likely to be caused by amorphous aggregation (see below), had an optimum at 700 mM (Fig. 1E). The optimal concentration for orthoP was slightly lower than that of NaCl (∼830 mM) (Fig. S1, D and I). The optimal ThT concentrations of polyPs corresponding to the major orthoP peak were 110 mM triP, 92 mM tetraP, 3.6 mM polyP-S, and 4.5 × 10−1 mM polyP-L (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1), demonstrating that the optimal concentration deceased slightly with an increase in the phosphate number (Fig. 2). On the other hand, the second ThT optimal concentrations were 7.3 mM triP, 5.9 × 10−1 mM tetraP, 9.9 × 10−2 mM polyP-S, and 8.5 × 10−3 mM polyP-L (Fig. 1, F and G and Figs. S1, G and H), suggesting that the second optimum concentration decreased markedly with an increase in the phosphate number (Fig. 2). The lag time exhibited a pattern slightly opposite to that of ThT fluorescence (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1). Small peaks at higher additive concentrations were observed for orthoP, diP, and NaCl at 730, 540, and 2800 mM, respectively (Fig. 1E and Fig. S1, F and I; gray). These peaks were likely to be caused by the formation of amorphous aggregates based on transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 3 and Fig. S5).Figure 3TEM images of α-syn aggregates in the presence of varying concentrations of polyPs. Top, orthoP, (middle) tetraP, and (bottom) polyP-L. The scale bars are 100 nm. Insets show the enlarged images of square regions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To focus on the two regions of amyloid formation, we also plotted the maximum ThT fluorescence for different polyPs against the phosphate unit number (Fig. 2C). In addition, the differences between the two optimal concentrations were plotted against the phosphate unit number (Fig. 2C). The plot in terms of polyP molar concentrations, which emphasizes the electrostatic interactions, exhibited the maximal separation of two peaks for polyPs with ten phosphate units. On the other hand, the plot in terms of phosphate unit molar concentration suggested a moderate dependence of the high polyP-concentration peak on the phosphate number. The slope at midpoint was −4.3 mM log[PolyP]/log[Length of polyP] for the charge–charge interactions (orange solid line) and −2.2 mM log[PolyP]/log[Length of polyP] for the Hofmeister salting-out effects (green solid line). These distinct slopes were consistent with a view that the electrostatic attractions and general salting-out effects are involved in amyloid formation at low and high polyP concentrations, respectively (see below). The results also argue the usefulness of using both polyP molar concentration and phosphate unit molar concentration to address the mechanism of polyP effects. The far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra after amyloid formation monitored by ThT fluorescence confirmed β-sheet-rich amyloid fibrils in the range of 200 to 1000 mM orthoP (Fig. S2A). However, almost no CD signal was observed at 2000 mM orthoP, suggesting the formation of amorphous aggregates. For other polyPs (i.e., diP, triP, tetraP, polyP-S, and polyP-L) and NaCl, the CD spectra exhibited β-sheet-rich conformations upon amyloid formation monitored by ThT fluorescence (Fig. S2, B–G). We plotted the CD ellipticities at 203 nm and 218 nm against the concentrations of polyPs and NaCl (Fig. S3, A–G). In the presence of orthoP, the CD ellipticity at 218 nm negatively increased and that at 203 nm positively increased accompanied by an increase in ThT fluorescence (Fig. S3A). Similar dependencies were observed for diP, triP, tetraP, polyP-S, polyP-L, and NaCl (Fig. S3, B–G). However, the second transition at high polyP concentrations specifically increased the intensity at 203 nm, which was most clearly observed for polyP-S and polyP-L. This suggested that the secondary structures are slightly different between amyloid fibrils induced at low and high polyP concentrations. By scrutinizing all of the TEM images obtained under various conditions (Fig. 3 and Fig. S4), we assessed the distinct morphologies of amyloid fibrils. In the presence of 250 mM orthoP, thick amyloid fibrils with diameters of ∼20 nm were observed by TEM (Fig. 3 and Fig. S4). These thick amyloid fibrils were also observed at higher concentrations of polyPs (i.e., 100 mM tetraP or 0.58 mM polyP-L (Fig. 3 and Fig. S4), 200 to 525 mM diP, 125 mM triP, 3 mM polyP-S, or 750 mM NaCl (Fig. S5A)). In contrast, thin fibrils were observed at lower concentrations of polyPs (i.e., 1 mM tetraP or 1.9 × 10−3 mM polyP-L (Fig. 3 and Fig. S4), 10 mM TriP or 3 × 10−2 mM polyP-S (Fig. S5A)). Of note, two types of amyloid fibrils of α-syn were previously reported to form at high and low NaCl concentrations, respectively (35Bousset L. Pieri L. Ruiz-Arlandis G. Gath J. Jensen P.H. Habenstein B. Madiona K. Olieric V. Bockmann A. Meier B.H. Melki R. Structural and functional characterization of two alpha-synuclein strains.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 36Melki R. Role of different alpha-synuclein strains in synucleinopathies, similarities with other neurodegenerative diseases.J. Parkinsons Dis. 2015; 5: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), consistent with the current results. In this paper, we also found that α-syn formed two types of fibrils (thin and thick fibrils) depending on the concentrations of polyP (Fig. 3 and Fig. S4). However, both of these fibrils were end products without conversion to each other. To address the interactions between polyPs and α-syn at the residue level, we measured the 1H-15N HQSC spectra of α-syn at varying concentrations of tetraP (Fig. 4A and Fig. S6, A and B). Figure 4A was separated to Fig. S6, A and B to clarify the complicated movements of respective peaks depending on the tetraP concentration. We used tetraP because the low and high concentration regions of amyloid formation were most highly separated. We performed the NMR measurements at 15 °C following that so far the NMR experiments of α-syn were done at 15 °C under the neutral conditions (2Sipe J.D. Benson M.D. Buxbaum J.N. Ikeda S.I. Merlini G. Saraiva M.J. Westermark P.

In addition, for the NMR measurements, amyloid formation of α-syn should be suppressed during an incubation of several hours for the HSQC measurements and for longer periods including those for peak assignments. We confirmed the suppression of amyloid formation at the concentrations of 0 to 200 mM tetraP during an incubation of 24 h at 15 °C (Fig. S1, E and J). The experiments at 15 °C also showed that the amyloid formation occurred at 300 or 475 mM tetraP within several hours, suggesting that the peak tetraP concentrations caused by Hofmeister effects shifted to higher tetraP concentrations. Signal assignments for 85% of the amino acid residues of α-syn were achieved at varying concentrations of tetraP. Some cross-peaks gradually shifted and curved trajectories were observed upon an increase in tetraP concentrations, suggesting at least two steps for the interaction of α-syn with tetraP. In particular, Ser and Thr residues, i.e., S9, T22, T33, T44, and T81, shifted in the opposite direction between 0 and 5 mM and 5 and 100 mM tetraP (Figs. 4, B and C and 5D). To determine the number of conformational states of soluble α-syn at different tetraP concentrations, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using HSQC chemical shift data. PCA is a multivariate analysis used to simplify the complexity in high-dimensional data by geometrically projecting data onto lower dimensions called principal components (PCs) (37Jaumot J. Vives M. Gargallo R. Application of multivariate resolution methods to the study of biochemical and biophysical processes.Anal. Biochem. 2004; 327: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 38Sakurai K. Goto Y.J. Principal component analysis of the pH-dependent conformational transitions of bovine beta-lactoglobulin monitored by heteronuclear NMR.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 15346-15351Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 39Lever J. Krzywinski M. Atman N. POINTS OF SIGNIFICANCE principal component analysis.Nat. Methods. 2017; 14: 641-642Crossref Scopus (542) Google Scholar). As a result of PCA using the normalized chemical shift data, we obtained nine PCs, corresponding eigenvalues, and contribution ratios (Fig. 5B). The accumulative contribution ratio of PC1 was 0.58 and that of the first two PCs was 0.88. The plot of PC contribution ratios against the tetraP concentration revealed that PC1 and PC2 changed smoothly against the tetraP concentration, whereas PC3 was relatively low in intensity over the tetraP concentrations examined (Fig. S6C). Thus, two dominant PCs were sufficient to describe most of the observed signal movements. The chemical shift perturbation (CSP) observed upon addition of tetraP could be potentially indicative of either (i) specific interactions between tetraP and α-syn or (ii) a backbone conformational change induced in α-syn due to the interaction with tetraP or (iii) due to the tetraP-dependent formation of soluble α-syn oligomers/aggregates. Although the observed chemical shift data may include these effects, PCA could not distinguish them at this stage. We then focused on the three different tetraP concentrations and obtained the stepwise differences among them in terms of PC contribution ratios (Fig. 5C): (i) 0 to 0.2 mM at which the contribution of PC1 was predominant, (ii) 0.2 to 5 mM at which the contribution of PC1 decreased and PC2 contribution was predominant, and (iii) 5 to 100 mM at which the negative contribution of PC1 was larger than that of PC2. The concentrations of (ii) and (iii) were approximately consistent with those to induce amyloid fibrils at low and high polyP concentrations, respectively (Figs. 1 and 2). CSP demonstrated that the entire region of α-syn remained almost unchanged upon increasing tetraP concentration from 0 to 0.2 mM (Fig. 5, D and E). From 0.2 to 5 mM tetraP, CSP was observed, especially for T22, T33, T44, and T59 located in the N-terminal KTKEGV repeats and H50 residue (Fig. 5F). His residue may shift upon a slight change in solution pH around neutral pH (40Kjaergaard M. Brander S. Poulsen F.M.

https://openalex.org/W3135480446,"The voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.5 plays important roles in the repolarization of atrial action potentials and regulation of the vascular tone. While the modulation of Kv1.5 function has been well studied, less is known about how the protein levels of Kv1.5 on the cell membrane are regulated. Here, through electrophysiological and biochemical analyses of Kv1.5 channels heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells and neonatal rat ventricular myocytes, as well as native Kv1.5 in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived atrial cardiomyocytes, we found that activation of protein kinase C (PKC) with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 10 nM) diminished Kv1.5 current (I<sub>Kv1.5</sub>) and protein levels of Kv1.5 in the plasma membrane. Mechanistically, PKC activation led to monoubiquitination and degradation of the mature Kv1.5 proteins. Overexpression of Vps24, a protein that sorts transmembrane proteins into lysosomes <i>via</i> the multivesicular body (MVB) pathway, accelerated, whereas the lysosome inhibitor bafilomycin A1 completely prevented PKC-mediated Kv1.5 degradation. Kv1.5, but not Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.3, or Kv1.4, was uniquely sensitive to PMA treatment. Sequence alignments suggested that residues within the N terminus of Kv1.5 are essential for PKC-mediated Kv1.5 reduction. Using N-terminal truncation as well as site-directed mutagenesis, we identified that Thr15 is the target site for PKC that mediates endocytic degradation of Kv1.5 channels. These findings indicate that alteration of protein levels in the plasma membrane represents an important regulatory mechanism of Kv1.5 channel function under PKC activation conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3135809725,"Human adenoviruses (HAdV) are one of the most frequent causes of respiratory infections around the world, causing mild to severe disease. In Argentina, many studies focused on the association of HAdV respiratory infection with severe disease and fatal outcomes leading to the discovery in 1984 of a genomic variant 7h associated with high fatality. Although several molecular studies reported the presence of at least 4 HAdV species (B, C, D and E) in Argentina, few sequences were available in the databases. In this study, sequences from the hexon gene region were obtained from 141 patients as a first approach to assess the genetic diversity of HAdVs circulating in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences and others recovered from public databases confirmed the circulation of the four above-mentioned species represented by 11 genotypes, with predominance in species B and C and shifts in their proportion in the studied period (2000 to 2018). The variants detected in Argentina, for most of the genotypes, were similar to those already described in other countries. However, uncommon lineages belonging to genotypes C2, C5 and E4 were detected, which might indicate the circulation of local variants and will deserve further studies of whole-genome sequences."
https://openalex.org/W3134051411,"According to the variance hypothesis , variety-seeking or exploration is a critical condition for improving learning and performance over time. Extant computational learning models support this hypothesis by showing how individuals who are exposed to diverse knowledge sources are more likely to find superior solutions to a particular problem. Yet this research provides no precise guidelines about how broadly individuals should search. Our goal in this paper is to elucidate the conditions under which variety-seeking in organizations is beneficial. To this end, we developed a computational model in which individuals learn as they interact with other individuals, and update their knowledge as a result of this interaction. The model reveals how the type of learning environment (performance landscape) in which the learning dynamic unfolds determines when the benefits of variety-seeking outweigh the costs. Variety-seeking is performance-enhancing only when the knowledge of the chosen learning targets (i.e., individuals to learn from) provide useful information about the features of the performance landscape. The results further suggest that superior knowledge might be available locally, i.e., in the proximity of an individual’s current location. We also identify the point beyond which variety-seeking causes a sharp performance decline and show how this point depends on the type of landscape in which the learning dynamic unfolds and the degree of specialization of individual knowledge. The presence of this critical point explains why exploration becomes very costly. The implications of our findings for establishing the boundaries of exploration are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3134396957,"Low levels of oxygen (hypoxia) occurs in many (patho)physiological situations. Adaptation to hypoxia is in part mediated by proteins expressed in the extracellular space that mature in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) prior to traversing the secretory pathway. The majority of such ER cargo proteins require disulfide bonds for structural stability. Disulfide bonds are formed co- and posttranslationally in a redox relay that requires a terminal electron acceptor such as oxygen. We have previously demonstrated that some ER cargo proteins such as low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and influenza hemagglutinin (Flu-HA) are unable to complete disulfide bond formation in the absence of oxygen, limiting their ability to pass ER quality control and their ultimate expression. Here, using radioactive pulse-chase immunoprecipitation analysis, we demonstrate that hypoxia-induced ER cargo proteins such as carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) complete disulfide bond formation and mature with similar kinetics under hypoxia and normoxia. A global in silico analysis of ER cargo revealed that hypoxia-induced proteins on average contain fewer free cysteines and shorter-range disulfide bonds in comparison to other ER cargo proteins. These data demonstrate the existence of alternative electron acceptors to oxygen for disulfide bond formation in cellulo. However, the ability of different proteins to utilize an oxygen-independent pathway for disulfide bond formation varies widely, contributing to differential gene expression in hypoxia.

VEGF-A and CA9 are induced by HIF and UPR during hypoxia through both transcriptional and translational mechanisms, but little is known about the oxygen dependencies of protein maturation, which ultimately affects expression in the extracellular space. Proteins that are destined for the cell membrane or secretion enter the ER cotranslationally before proceeding through the secretory pathway (16Braakman I. Hebert D.N. Protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5: a013201Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The ER serves as a folding and maturation compartment for these “ER cargo” proteins. ER-localized co- and posttranslational modifications include N-linked glycosylation and glycan modifications, disulfide bond formation, and isomerization (16Braakman I. Hebert D.N. Protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5: a013201Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Activation of the UPR by hypoxia suggests that one or more cellular processes in the ER are oxygen-dependent. While glycan processing has been identified as an oxygen-independent process (8Koritzinsky M. Levitin F. Van Den Beucken T. Rumantir R.A. Harding N.J. Chu K.C. Boutros P.C. Braakman I. Wouters B.G.

PDIs can also rearrange (isomerize) disulfide bonds in their clients. To support multiple cycles of disulfide bond formation, PDIs must be reoxidized, typically by the ER oxidoreductase flavoproteins ERO1-Lα or ERO1-Lß (18Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A.

This role for molecular oxygen in disulfide bond formation is in line with the demonstration that hypoxia is a strong physiological activator of the UPR in mammalian cells (7Koumenis C. Naczki C.

However, this is paradoxical in light of numerous hypoxia-induced ER cargo proteins being secreted under such conditions. To determine the requirement for oxygen in the ER, we previously directly assayed ER-localized disulfide bond formation in living human cells in the presence and absence of oxygen for two model proteins (8Koritzinsky M. Levitin F. Van Den Beucken T. Rumantir R.A. Harding N.J. Chu K.C. Boutros P.C. Braakman I. Wouters B.G. Two phases of disulfide bond formation have differing requirements for oxygen.J.

Isoform 1 of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) has 30 disulfide bonds concentrated in the N-terminal ligand-binding region (25Gent J. Braakman I. Low-density lipoprotein receptor structure and folding.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 2461-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1—LDLR) that are formed through nonvectorial folding by distinct cotranslational oxidation and posttranslational isomerization steps (25Gent J.

Coordinated nonvectorial folding in a newly synthesized multidomain protein.Science. 2002; 298: 2401-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we showed that disulfide bonds were readily introduced cotranslationally into LDLR in the absence of oxygen, demonstrating the existence of an alternative terminal oxidant to molecular oxygen (8Koritzinsky M. Levitin F. Van Den Beucken T. Rumantir R.A. Harding N.J. Chu K.C. Boutros P.C. Braakman I. Wouters B.G. Two phases of disulfide bond formation have differing requirements for oxygen.J. Cell Biol. 2013; 203: 615-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Despite proficiency in cotranslational disulfide bond formation, posttranslational disulfide isomerization failed in the absence of oxygen, leading to substantial misfolding and ER retention. This pattern of oxygen dependency for disulfide bond formation and isomerization was recapitulated in another ER cargo protein, influenza hemagglutinin (Flu-HA) (8Koritzinsky M. Levitin F. Van Den Beucken T. Rumantir R.A. Harding N.J. Chu K.C. Boutros P.C. Braakman I. Wouters B.G. Two phases of disulfide bond formation have differing requirements for oxygen.J. Cell Biol. 2013; 203: 615-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This work hence suggested that an oxygen-independent pathway for disulfide bond formation exists, but it cannot fully support productive protein maturation and expression. Here we aimed to determine if the oxygen-independent pathway for disulfide bond formation can fully support the maturation and expression of proteins such as VEGF-A and CA9 that are known to be highly expressed in hypoxia (5Semenza G.L. Hypoxia-inducible factors in physiology and medicine.Cell. 2012; 148: 399-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2062) Google Scholar, 27Harris A.L. Hypoxia - a key regulatory factor in tumour growth.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4263) Google Scholar). This was determined through radioactive pulse-chase immunoprecipitation studies in which disulfide bond formation and secretion of a highly synchronized newly synthesized protein population could be monitored in the presence and absence of oxygen. Taking a global in silico approach, we also compared the number and architecture of disulfides in hypoxia-induced and non-hypoxia-induced proteins to better understand how some proteins may mature independently of oxygen availability. Overall, this study aimed to provide further knowledge on the oxygen dependency of protein expression. We sought to determine the requirement for oxygen in the disulfide bond formation of VEGF-A and CA9. VEGF-A165 (referred to as VEGF-A in the following) is a disulfide-linked homodimer that contains three intertwined intrachain disulfides comprising a cystine knot structural motif and a cysteine-rich C terminus (28Iyer S. Acharya K.R. Tying the knot: The cystine signature and molecular-recognition processes of the vascular endothelial growth factor family of angiogenic cytokines.FEBS J. 2011; 278: 4304-4322Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1—VEGF-A). Formation of the cystine knot is essential for the structural integrity of the monomer as well as the formation of the disulfide-linked dimer (29Pötgens A.J. Lubsen N.H. van Altena M.C. Vermeulen R.

It contains one intrachain disulfide as inferred by the proximity of the cysteine residues in the crystal structure (32Alterio V. Hilvo M. Di Fiore A. Supuran C.T. Pan P. Parkkila S. Scaloni A.

A. 2009; 106: 16233-16238Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) and two additional free cysteines (Fig. 1—CA9). Oxygen dependency of disulfide bond formation and protein maturation was investigated in cellulo using a pulse-chase assay (supporting information 1). Cells were exposed to a short pulse of 35S-methionine/cysteine in normoxia (21% O2) or anoxia (0% O2) to create a highly synchronized radioactive pool of newly synthesized protein (33Braakman I. Lamriben L. van Zadelhoff G. Hebert D.N. Analysis of disulfide bond formation.Curr. Protoc. Protein Sci. 2017; 90: 14-1.1-14.1.21Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). After removal of the radioactive amino acids, cells were incubated for different periods (“chased”) before they were flooded with an alkylating reagent, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), to prevent further oxidation of cysteines. Cells were then lysed and proteins of interest were immunoprecipitated and resolved by gel electrophoresis under reducing or nonreducing conditions to interrogate the kinetics of disulfide bond formation. We aimed to compare the oxygen dependency of disulfide bond formation in VEGF-A and CA9 in normoxia and anoxia directly to that of LDLR. As shown previously, LDLR is detected migrating at ∼130 kD under reducing conditions immediately after a 5-min pulse in normoxia (Fig. 2A, lane 1), consistent with the fully synthesized protein with its core N-linked glycan. One hour after synthesis, a slower migrating form of LDLR appears, reflecting complex glycosylation in the Golgi (Fig. 2A, lane 3) (8Koritzinsky M. Levitin F. Van Den Beucken T. Rumantir R.A. Harding N.J. Chu K.C. Boutros P.C. Braakman I. Wouters B.G. Two phases of disulfide bond formation have differing requirements for oxygen.J. Cell Biol. 2013; 203: 615-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 26Jansens A. Van Duijn E. Braakman I. Coordinated nonvectorial folding in a newly synthesized multidomain protein.Science. 2002; 298: 2401-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Under nonreducing conditions where disulfide bonds remain present within the protein structure, LDLR migrates more rapidly due to its more compact conformation in comparison to under reduced conditions (Fig. 2A, lanes 4–6). This shows that disulfide bonds are introduced during or immediately after translation in LDLR in normoxia. A decrease in overall signal intensity of LDLR is observed in anoxia in comparison to normoxia (Fig. 2A, lanes 7–12 versus lanes 1–6). This observation is consistent with the reduction in protein synthesis due to rapid PERK-dependent phosphorylation of eIF2α as part of the UPR (7Koumenis C. Naczki C. Koritzinsky M. Rastani S. Diehl A. Sonenberg N. Koromilas A. Wouters B.G. Regulation of protein synthesis by hypoxia via activation of the endoplasmic reticulum kinase PERK and phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2.Mol. Cell.

Voncken J.W. Lambin P. Koumenis C. Sonenberg N. Wouters B.G. Gene expression during acute and prolonged hypoxia is regulated by distinct mechanisms of translational control.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1114-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). There was a complete lack of Golgi-localized glycosylation in anoxia (Fig. 2A, lane 9 versus 3). Similar to normoxia, LDLR migrated faster when it was resolved under nonreducing conditions, reflecting that disulfides are introduced in LDLR during translation also in anoxia (Fig. 2A, lane 10 versus 7). However, the protein pool becomes more heterogeneous and migrates slower over time (Fig. 2A, lanes 10–12), representing a failure to properly isomerize disulfide bonds in anoxia. As such, the defect in Golgi-localized glycosylation in anoxia is likely secondary to impaired disulfide isomerization and an inability to pass ER quality control and traverse to the Golgi. Unlike LDLR, VEGF-A is a hypoxia-inducible protein that might have evolved to mature in the absence of oxygen. To monitor disulfide bond formation and secretion of VEGF-A, both lysates and media were collected at various time points after the radioactive pulse-chase. Under nonreducing conditions, VEGF-A was detected migrating at ∼54 kD at all time points in both normoxia and anoxia (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–20), consistent with the molecular weight of the homodimer. Under reducing conditions, the VEGF-A band was observed at ∼27 kD (Fig. 2B), validating that the observed 54kD band indeed represents the disulfide-linked dimer. This observation shows that VEGF-A is rapidly dimerized during or immediately following synthesis in both normoxia and anoxia. It implies that the intramolecular cystine knot forms efficiently in anoxia, since it is known to be required for subsequent dimer formation (29Pötgens A.J. Lubsen N.H. van Altena M.C. Vermeulen R. Bakker A. Schoenmakers J.G. Ruiter D.J. de Waal R.M. Covalent dimerization of vascular permeability factor/vascular endothelial growth factor is essential for its biological activity. Evidence from Cys to Ser mutations.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32879-32885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We consistently observed an increase in dimer intensity following a 15-min chase time in both oxygen conditions under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 2B top, lanes 2 and 12), presumably due to the resolution of undetectable folding intermediates over this time period. VEGF-A then disappeared from the lysate over time (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–5 and 11–15), while it appeared in the chase media (Fig. 2B, lanes 6–10 and 16–20) as it was secreted. The secretion of VEGF-A was substantial 30 min after synthesis and mostly complete within 120 min in normoxia, (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–10) (Fig. 2C). In anoxia, the kinetics of VEGF-A secretion over time was slightly slower than in normoxia, but also mostly complete by 120 min after synthesis (Fig. 2, B and C). Densitometry quantification from multiple experiments supported that VEGF-A is efficiently secreted under both normoxia and anoxia, with a marginal delay in anoxia (p = 0.0007) (Fig. 2C). On average, about 80% of the total protein fraction was secreted by 120 min after synthesis (Fig. 2C). There was no overall loss of signal during the 120-min experimental period, demonstrating that in both normoxia and anoxia, VEGF-A was either secreted or retained in the ER—but not degraded (supporting information 2A). Our results show that VEGF-A can successfully complete disulfide bond formation and traverse through the secretory pathway in both normoxic and anoxic conditions. To test the oxygen dependency of disulfide bond formation in a hypoxia-induced membrane-bound ER cargo, CA9 was probed. After synthesis in normoxia or anoxia, CA9 migrated mostly at ∼55 kD, consistent with the monomeric form (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 4, supporting information 3). Progressive dimer formation could be seen in normoxia between 30 and 60 min after CA9 synthesis. (Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 3). Sample reduction confirmed that the higher-molecular-weight band represents the disulfide-linked dimer (Fig. 3A, lane 7). In anoxia, dimer formation was delayed in comparison to normoxia (Fig. 3A, lane 2 versus 5), but a substantial amount of the CA9 protein pool reached a dimer state by 1 h after synthesis (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 6). Densitometry quantification from multiple experiments showed that by 60 min after synthesis, 80% of the total protein pool was detected as dimers in normoxia (Fig. 3B). Approximately 50% of the protein population formed dimers over the same time period in anoxia. Although this suggests a delay in CA9 dimerization in anoxia, this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.4). Densitometry quantification confirmed that there was no overall loss of signal during the 60-min experimental period suggesting that CA9 was neither degraded nor aggregated (supporting information 2B). To validate that dimerized CA9 could pass ER quality control and traverse the secretory pathway to reach its final plasma membrane destination under anoxia, we quantified CA9 localization by immunofluorescence (IF) (Fig. 3C). We induced endogenous CA9 expression by hypoxia and/or 2,2 dipyridyl (2,2-DIP), which activate the transcription factor HIF. Both treatments resulted in similar upregulation of CA9 mRNA and protein (supporting information 4). Under all conditions, 80% of CA9 was detected in the plasma membrane (Fig. 3D), demonstrating that although dimerization of CA9 may be somewhat delayed in anoxia, the protein proceeds through the secretory pathway to be"

Material and methods A random distribution of follow-up time from breast cancer diagnosis till blood sampling was obtained by a nested, matched case-control design in the Norwegian Women and Cancer Post-genome Cohort. From 2002–5, women were invited to donate blood samples, regardless of any cancer diagnosis. At end of the study period in 2015, any cancer diagnoses in the 50 000 participants were obtained via linkage to the Norwegian Cancer Registry. For each breast cancer patient (n = 415), an age- and storage time-matched control was drawn. The design gave a uniform, random length of follow-up time, independent of cancer stage. Differences in blood gene expression between breast cancer cases and controls were identified using the Bioconductor R-package limma, using a moving window in time, to handle the varying time elapsed from diagnosis to blood sample. Results The number of differentially expressed genes between cases and controls were close to 2,000 in the first year after diagnosis, but fell sharply the second year. During the next years, a transient second increase was observed, but only in women with metastatic disease who later died, both compared to invasive cases that survived (p&lt;0,001) and to metastatic cases that survived (p = 0.024). Among the differentially expressed genes there was an overrepresentation of heme metabolism and T cell-related processes. Conclusion This explorative analysis identified changing trajectories in the years after diagnosis, depending on clinical stage. Hypothetically, this could represent the escape of the metastatic cancer from the immune system."

Pectins are a family of galacturonic-acid-rich polysaccharides that include homogalacturonan, rhamnogalacturonan I and II, as well as xylogalacturonan. Pectins are complex polysaccharides abundant in the primary plant cell wall and are well known as dietary fibers. Previous studies have shown that various forms of pectin exhibit antitumor properties (1Leclere L. Cutsem P.V. Michiels C. Anti-cancer activities of pH- or heat-modified pectin.Front. Pharmacol. 2013; 4: 128Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Recently pH- and heat-modified pectins (MPs) demonstrated enhanced functions and bioactivities compared with native pectin. Notably, high-temperature-modified citrus pectin (HTCP) has been shown to induce apoptosis in androgen-responsive (LNCaP) and androgen-independent (LNCaP C4-2) human prostate cancer cells (2Jackson C.L.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (Apo 2 or TRAIL/Apo2L) is a member of the TNF family of ligands capable of initiating apoptosis through engagement of its death receptors. TRAIL selectively induces apoptosis in a variety of tumor cells and transformed cells, but not in most normal cells, and therefore it has garnered intense interest as a promising agent for cancer therapy (8Wang S.

However, the primary and acquired resistance of cancer cells to TRAIL has become a roadblock of TRAIL therapy. Hence, the combination of other therapies with TRAIL to overcome this resistance has become a promising strategy. TRAIL exerts remarkable antitumor activity in combination with cytotoxic drugs in phase I and phase II clinical trials (9Takeda K. Stagg J. Yagita H. Okumura K. Smyth M.J.O.

In current study, we isolated DHCP from HTCP and investigated its effect on colon cancer inhibition and its mechanism of action. The synergistic effect of DHCP and TRAIL, as well as possible mechanisms underlying their synergistic effect, was also investigated. These findings offer evidence for DHCP as a new TRAIL sensitizer and promise for the development of pectin-based pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, and dietary additive in the combat against human colon cancer. HTCP, along with its fractions HTCP-S, HTCP-P, HTCP-S-IS, HTCP-S-OS, HTCP-S-OS1, HTCP-S-OS2, and HTCP-S-OS3, was obtained according to the method described (Fig. 1A). Human colon cancer HCT-116 cells were treated with these fractions for 24 h, and cell viability was assessed using the WST-1 assay. Data showed that cell viability was slightly impaired by CP, HTCP-P, HTCP-S-IS, HTCP-S-OS1, and HTCP-S-OS2, but significantly inhibited by HTCP, HTCP-S, HTCP-S-OS, and HTCP-S-OS3 (Fig. 1, B–D and Fig. S1). HTCP-S-OS3 exhibited the most significant cell viability inhibitory activity among all fractions from HTCP. These results indicate that active compounds are present in the HTCP-S-OS3 fraction. Hence, HTCP-S-OS3 was further separated by HPLC (Kromasil C18 column) into fractions F1, F2, and F3 (Fig. 1A). Our results show that whereas F1 and F2 exhibited cell viability inhibitory effects with IC50 values of 16 and 26 μg/ml, respectively, fraction F3 had an IC50 value of 4 μg/ml, much lower than F1 or F2 (Fig. 1E). This suggested that F3 is the primary contributor to the activity of the HTCP-S-OS3 fraction. Structure elucidation of relatively pure fraction F3 (Fig. 1F) showed that its chemical structure analyzed by 1H NMR (Fig. 1G) has four dominant resonances at 7.56 ppm [1 H, dd, J = 1.8 Hz, 2-H], 6.28 ppm [1 H, dd, J= 1.2 Hz, 3-H], 4.68 ppm [1 H, m, 4-H], and 4.10 ppm [1 H, d, J = 3.0 Hz, 5-H]. The mass spectrum (MS) of F3 shows the primary fragment ion at 113 [M-H] (Fig. 1H). These results suggest that F3 is DHCP (Fig. 1I). The cytotoxicity of DHCP on human colon cancer cells has never been reported. Here, we found that DHCP demonstrates a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on four colon cancer cell lines (Fig. 2A) and induces cell death of HCT116 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 2, B and C). We found that DHCP initiates the processing of caspase-3, -8, -9, and PARP in HCT116 also in dose- and time-dependent manners (Fig. S2, A and B). However, cell death induced by DHCP could not be inhibited by Z-VAD-FMK. To investigate pathways involved in DHCP-mediated cell death in greater detail, we investigated various types of cell death inhibitors. Our results show that cell death was also not impacted by pretreatment with necrosis inhibitor necrostatin-1 or ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 (Fig. 2D). In contrast, the inflammasome inhibitor CRID3 could restore cell viability (Fig. 2D). Collectively, these data suggest that DHCP-induced cell death is mediated by a pathway dependent on pyroptosis. Moreover, DHCP suppressed the growth of HCT116 and HT-29 xenografts without impacting body weight, suggesting the lack of cytotoxicity (Fig. 2, E–H). Moderate increases of ROS contribute to tumor promotion and progression. However, ROS can also trigger programmed cell death. Cancer cells exhibit higher ROS levels than normal cells; consequently, cancer cells are more vulnerable to oxidative stress than are normal cells. This can be utilized as an anticancer strategy. In the present study, we found that DHCP induces robust generation of ROS in HCT116 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 3, A and B). ROS scavengers (NAC or GSH) significantly decrease ROS induced by DHCP (Fig. 3C), as well as cell death induced by DHCP (Fig. 3D). Mitochondria are regarded as the primary source for ROS (15Ricci J.E. Waterhouse N. Green D.R. Mitochondrial functions during cell death, a complex (I-V) dilemma.Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) that can be triggered by deficient antioxidants, inhibition of electron flow, or exposure to xenobiotics. Several xenobiotics have been reported to increase the rate of ROS production by interacting with the mitochondrial electron pathway (16Turrens J.F. Mitochondrial formation of reactive oxygen species.J. Physiol-london. 2003; 552: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (3413) Google Scholar). To investigate whether ROS production induced by DHCP is generated through the mitochondrial pathway, the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MMP) was assessed by flow cytometry followed by JC-1 staining. Our results show that DHCP lowers MMP in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 3, E and F). Mitochondria are the principal site of important cellular functions, including ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation (17Bezawork-Geleta A. Rohlena J. Dong L. Pacak K. Neuzil J. Mitochondrial complex II: At the crossroads.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2017; 42: 312-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). DHCP also exhibited a significantly inhibitory effect on mitochondrial ATP production (Fig. 3G). In addition, the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation function upon DHCP treatment was determined by detecting the oxygen consumption rate. The results showed that DHCP exerted a robust inhibitory effect on oxidative phosphorylation of HCT116 (Fig. 3H), HT-29, SW480, DLD-1, and colo205 colon cancer cell lines (Fig. S3). These results suggest that DHCP induces ROS generation by influencing the mitochondrial activity. To confirm this, we examined the effects of DHCP on ROS levels in normal A549 cells and A549 ρ0 cells in which mitochondrial function was negated by depletion of mtDNA (18Sun X. Ai M. Wang Y. Shen S. Gu Y. Jin Y. Zhou Z. Long Y. Yu Q. Selective induction of tumor cell apoptosis by a novel P450-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) inducer methyl 3-(4-nitrophenyl) propiolate.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 8826-8837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Upon DHCP treatment, cellular ROS levels increased from 49.1% to 73.5% in A549 cells, whereas it remained basically unchanged in A549 ρ0 cells (Fig. S4), supporting the hypothesis that DHCP induces ROS generation by modulating mitochondrial activity. The mitochondrial respiratory chain is the major cellular generator of superoxide and associated ROS as electrons leak from sites at or within respiratory chain complexes (19Murphy M.P. How mitochondria produce reactive oxygen species.Biochem. J. 2009; 417: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (4910) Google Scholar). Complexes Ⅰ and III have long been recognized as the main sources of ROS. In recent years, complex II has also been established as an efficient producer of ROS (20Quinlan C.L. Orr A.L. Perevoshchikova I.V. Treberg J.R. Ackrell B.A. Brand M.D. Mitochondrial complex II can generate reactive oxygen species at high rates in both the forward and reverse reactions.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 27255-27264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Here, HCT116 cells were permeabilized by digitonin (0.001%) and then were loaded with specific substrates to dissect the multiple steps of aerobic respiration and examined by using Seahorse XFp Extracellular Flux Analyzers as described in literature (21Zhang B. Chu W. Wei P. Liu Y. Wei T. Xanthohumol induces generation of reactive oxygen species and triggers apoptosis through inhibition of mitochondrial electron transfer chain complex I.Free Radic. Bio. Med. 2015; 89: 486-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Activity of mitochondrial complex I was measured by using glutamine as substrate, which ultimately produces NADH for complex I oxidation. The results showed that glutamine-driven aerobic respiration was unaffected on DHCP-treated cells (Fig. 4A), suggesting that DHCP could not inhibit complex I activity. Next, the impact of DHCP on the activity of complex II was evaluated. The complex I activity was inhibited by rotenone, and then succinate was used as substrate to measure the cellular response to complex II activity. As shown in Figure 4, A–C, DHCP significantly inhibited the aerobic respiration dependent on succinate, suggesting that DHCP is the inhibitor of complex II. The activity of complex III was measured with the substrate glycerol-3-phosphate (G-3-P) according to previous report (21Zhang B. Chu W. Wei P. Liu Y. Wei T. Xanthohumol induces generation of reactive oxygen species and triggers apoptosis through inhibition of mitochondrial electron transfer chain complex I.Free Radic. Bio. Med. 2015; 89: 486-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 4B, DHCP had no effect on the oxygen consumption driven by G-3-P, suggesting no effect on complex III activity. Tetramethyl-p-phenylene diamine (TMPD) was used as the substrate to determine the effect of DHCP on the activity of complex IV. TMPD can donate electrons directly to complex IV to reduce O2. In the presence of indicated inhibitors (rotenone, malonate, and antimycin A) to complex I, complex II, and complex III, DHCP did not change the oxygen consumption caused by the oxidation of TMPD, indicating that complex IV was not affected by DHCP (Fig. 4C). To further demonstrate that DHCP inhibited complex II activity, mitochondrial complex activities were also evaluated in vitro, in which the activity of complex II, but not of complexes I, III, IV, and V, was markedly reduced upon DHCP treatment (Fig. 4D). Mitochondrial complex II (succinate dehydrogenase; SDH) contains four subunits (SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD). The enzyme activities of SDH include SDH (succinate dehydrogenase) and SQR (succinate ubiquinone reductase) activities (22Miyadera H. Shiomi K. Ui H. Yamaguchi Y. Masuma R. Tomoda H. Miyoshi H. Osanai A. Kita K. Ōmura S. Atpenins, potent and specific inhibitors of mitochondrial complex II (succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase).P. Natl. Acad. Sci. Usa. 2003; 100: 473Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Electrons resulting from the oxidation of succinate within SDHA are transferred from SDHA-bound flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor to Fe-S clusters of SDHB and finally to the ubiquinone reduction site residing between SDHC and SDHD where ubiquinone is reduced to ubiquinol (23Guo L. Shestov A.A. Worth A.J. Nath K. Nelson D.S. Leeper D.B. Glickson J.D. Blair I.A. Inhibition of mitochondrial complex II by the anticancer agent Lonidamine.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 42-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To determine the specificity of complex II inhibition by DHCP, the activities of SDH and SQR were measured as previously reported (23Guo L. Shestov A.A. Worth A.J. Nath K. Nelson D.S. Leeper D.B. Glickson J.D. Blair I.A. Inhibition of mitochondrial complex II by the anticancer agent Lonidamine.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 42-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Complex II inhibitors TTFA and malonate were used to determine the specificity of the SQR and SDH activity assays. TTFA inhibits complex II activity by primarily binding to the ubiquinone-binding site, whereas malonate competes with succinate for the dehydrogenase-binding site on complex II. Here we found that DHCP suppressed both SQR and SDH activities in a dose-dependent manner. However, the inhibitory effect of DHCP on SQR activity was much more prominent than that of SDH (Fig. 4E). The effect of DHCP is identical to that of TTFA, but not of malonate (Fig. 4E), suggesting that DHCP inhibits complex II activity and may interfere with ubiquinone reduction, possibly at the ubiquinone-binding site in SDHC and SDHD. To confirm this, cellular ROS generation was examined after cotreatment with TTFA (or complex II inhibitor 3-NPA) and DHCP. It had been reported that 3-NPA abrogates ROS generation by binding to the active site of SDHA and inhibiting electron transfer from succinate to FAD. Consistent with previous reports, our results show that 3-NPA decreases ROS generation and reduces ROS production triggered by TTFA (Fig. 4F). In contrast, cotreatment of DHCP and TTFA exerts an additive effect on ROS production, whereas 3-NPA markedly decreases the level of ROS generation by DHCP (Fig. 4F). These results confirmed that DHCP inhibits complex II by interfering with ubiquinone reduction. Increased ROS levels are thought to impair drug resistance of cancer cells. Here, we found that DHCP sensitizes three clinical anticancer drugs (5-fluorouracil, irinotecan, oxaliplatin) and one preclinical drug TRAIL. DHCP slightly synergizes with 5-FU, irinotecan, or oxaliplatin, but shows a significant synergistic effect with TRAIL (Fig. S5). We further investigated the synergistic effect on TRAIL-sensitive HCT116 cells and TRAIL-resistant HT-29 cells. Our results show that HCT116 and HT-29 cells are modestly or minimally sensitive to either DHCP or TRAIL alone (Fig. 5, A and B). However, their combination significantly decreases the viability of HCT116 and HT-29 cells (Fig. 5, A and B). In contrast, DHCP enhances TRAIL-induced cell death in other colon cancer cells as well (Fig. S6). However, DHCP and TRAIL showed minimal synergistic effect on human colonic epithelial NCM460 cells (Fig. S7). These results suggest that combination of DHCP and TRAIL might preferentially target cancer cells. Our FACS results show that DHCP or TRAIL alone induces 21.1% and 18.7% cell death, respectively. The combination treatment promoted apoptosis to 90% (Fig. 5C). For HT-29 cells, DHCP and TRAIL treatment alone induced 13% and 18% cell death, respectively. The combination treatment enhanced cell death to 93.4% (Fig. 5D). Consistently, the combination of DHCP and TRAIL more efficiently initiated the processing of caspase-3, -8, -9, and PARP in HCT116 and HT-29 cells (Fig. 5, E and F). Moreover, cell death (Fig. 5, C and D) and cleavage of caspase-3, -8, -9, and PARP (Fig. 5, E and F) induced by DHCP and TRAIL were effectively blocked by pretreatment with Z-VAD-FMK, indicating that DHCP sensitizes human colon cancer cells to TRAIL-induced cell death in a caspase-dependent manner. The therapeutic combination of DHCP and TRAIL was also tested in vivo. Mice bearing xenografted HCT116 and HT-29 colon tumor cells were treated with DHCP and/or TRAIL every other day. These results indicate that combination therapy did not impact the weight of the mice (Fig. S8A), but did significantly suppress tumor growth (Fig. 6, A and B), tumor size (Fig. S8B), and tumor volume (Fig. S8C). The expression of ki-67 and cleaved-caspase-3 in tumor tissue samples also demonstrated that DHCP and TRAIL exerted a synergistic effect (Fig. 6, C and D). To identify the mechanism by which DHCP sensitizes colon cancer cells to TRAIL, we investigated multiple extrinsic and intrinsic cell death pathway components that could be affected by DHCP. The results showed that DHCP decreased the expression of cell survival proteins, including Bcl-2, cFLIP, Mcl-1, c-IAP1, c-IAP2, XIAP, survivin, and Livin, whereas it increased procell death proteins including Bax, tBid, and Cyt-c (Fig. 7, A and B). These changes may account, at least in part, for the synergistic effect. Decreased expression of TRAIL receptors DR4 and DR5 accounts for TRAIL resistance in certain cancer cell lines. DR5, but not DR4, was upregulated upon DHCP treatment in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7C). Consistent with protein changes, DHCP treatment increased DR5 cell surface expression (Fig. 7D). Moreover, upregulation of DR5 is indeed mediating the observed cooperative effect between DHCP and TRAIL. To substantiate this, two specific siRNAs of DR5 were applied to silence DR5 expression (Fig. 7, E and F). Upon DR5 siRNAs transfection, cell death induced by the combination of DHCP and TRAIL was decreased from 96.7% to 67.8% or 60.8%, respectively (Fig. 7G). Collectively, we conclude that DR5 upregulation by DHCP plays a crucial role in the synergistic effect of DHCP and TRAIL. In this study, we were particularly interested in the mechanism of action accounting for the upregulation of DR5 in response to DHCP. The reason is that agonistic TRAIL-R antibodies that selectively target DR5 induce apoptosis by the same mechanism as TRAIL. However, the stability of TRAIL-R antibodies in vivo makes them attractive agents for use in humans, and several clinical trials investigating TRAIL-R antibodies in solid and hematological tumors have been initiated. The upregulation of DR5 provides a possibility for the combination of DHCP and TRAIL-R antibodies. We next sought to identify pathways involved in DHCP-induced DR5 upregulation. Our results, along with those of other researchers, have shown that p53 and CHOP are involved in DR5 upregulation (24Prasad S. Kim J.H. Gupta S.C. Aggarwal B.B. Targeting death receptors for TRAIL by agents designed by Mother Nature.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2014; 35: 520-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that DHCP induces the upregulation of p53 and CHOP in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 8, A and B), as well as the induction of DR5 in parallel with the increase in p53 and CHOP (Fig. 8B). Furthermore, upregulation of DR5 and CHOP induced by DHCP is inhibited in HCT116 p53−/− cells (Fig. 8C). Moreover, cell death induced by the combination of DHCP and TRAIL was decreased from 88.3% to 44.2% in HCT116 p53−/− cells (Fig. 8D). To confirm these results, HCT116 cells were transfected with two p53 siRNAs. Consistently, the expression of DR5 was also reduced in p53 siRNAs transfected HCT116 cells (Fig. 8E). Furthermore, the expression of CHOP was robustly impacted by p53 siRNAs transfection (Fig. 8E). p53, CHOP, and the up-expression of DR5 were also eliminated in the presence of ROS scavengers, NAC or GSH (Fig. 9A). Correspondingly, the synergistic effect of DHCP and TRAIL on HCT116 cells was robustly inhibited (Fig. 9, B–D). These results indicate that DHCP-induced ROS generation is the root cause of the synergistic effect from the combination of DHCP and TRAIL. The role of dietary components in cancer prevention and progression is an area of increasing clinical and scientiﬁc interest. An inverse relation between consumption of fruits and vegetables and the incidence of various cancers has led researchers to investigate the benefits of diet in cancer prevention.

It has been deployed continuously, serving a wide range of biomedical users and needs, and over time has also served as a platform to support the creation of new tools that address additional needs. Here we describe the current, greatly expanded implementation of Anne O’Tate, which has added additional buttons to provide new functionalities: We now allow users to sort and rank search results by important phrases contained in titles and abstracts; the number of authors listed on the article; and pairs of topics that co-occur significantly more than chance. We also display articles according to NLM-indexed publication types, as well as according to 50 different publication types and study designs as predicted by a novel machine learning-based model. Furthermore, users can import search results into two new tools: e) Mine the Gap!, which identifies pairs of topics that are under-represented within set of the search results, and f) Citation Cloud, which for any given article, allows users to visualize the set of articles that cite it; that are cited by it; that are co-cited with it; and that are bibliographically coupled to it.

https://openalex.org/W3135421947,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the most common cause of adult morbidity and mortality in developed nations. As a result, predisposition for CVD is increasingly important to understand. Ankyrins are intracellular proteins required for the maintenance of membrane domains. Canonical ankyrin-G (AnkG) has been shown to be vital for normal cardiac function, specifically cardiac excitability, via targeting and regulation of the cardiac voltage-gated sodium channel. Noncanonical (giant) AnkG isoforms play a key role in neuronal membrane biogenesis and excitability, with evidence for human neurologic disease when aberrant. However, the role of giant AnkG in cardiovascular tissue has yet to be explored. Here, we identify giant AnkG in the myocardium and identify that it is enriched in 1-week-old mice. Using a new mouse model lacking giant AnkG expression in myocytes, we identify that young mice displayed a dilated cardiomyopathy phenotype with aberrant electrical conduction and enhanced arrhythmogenicity. Structural and electrical dysfunction occurred at 1 week of age, when giant AnkG was highly expressed and did not appreciably change in adulthood until advanced age. At a cellular level, loss of giant AnkG results in delayed and early afterdepolarizations. However, surprisingly, giant AnkG cKO myocytes display normal INa, but abnormal myocyte contractility, suggesting unique roles of the large isoform in the heart. Finally, transcript analysis provided evidence for unique pathways that may contribute to the structural and electrical findings shown in giant AnkG cKO animals.

It is therefore, increasingly important to understand the etiology and risk factors associated with the development of CVD. To that end, heritable predisposition to HF and arrhythmia remains a vital area for continued study. More specifically, a focus on unique cell types in the myocardium, such as excitable cells, becomes critically important. Excitable cell function in the human neurologic and cardiovascular systems relies on complex interactions between ion channels and structural proteins; ankyrins are one such membrane-associated protein. More specifically, ankyrin-G (AnkG) has been investigated first in neurologic tissue and later in the heart. The function of canonical AnkG (220 kDa) in neurologic tissue is well described, where it is important for regulating membrane and intracellular protein complexes necessary for normal neurologic function (3Kordeli E.

Both ANK2 and ANK3 encode in canonical and “giant” isoforms. In neurologic tissue, “giant” AnkG (∼400 kDa) in particular has been studied and found to function in conductance and electrical signaling. At the axonal initial segment (AIS), giant AnkG operates as a membrane-associated adaptor protein that has been implicated in organizing voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav), βIV spectrin, KCNQ2/3, and neurofascin (10Jenkins P.M.

Although our knowledge about giant AnkG function in neurologic tissue continues to evolve, it has remained unclear whether giant AnkG is present in the heart and how it behaves in relation to cardiac structure and electrical function. Therefore, this highlights a gap in our current understanding of roles for the giant AnkG isoform in cardiovascular function and in CVD. In the present manuscript, we have identified giant AnkG within the heart of both young (1 week old) and adult-aged animals (22 weeks old). To define the role of giant AnkG in the heart, we created a new model of giant AnkG deficiency in postnatal myocytes (αMHC-Cre). Mice deficient in giant AnkG display a dilated left ventricle, gross posterior wall thinning, and systolic dysfunction, characteristic of a dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) phenotype in the neonatal period. In addition, these mice exhibit electrical dysfunction including ventricular arrhythmia and high-degree (third-degree and complete) heart block. Notably, unlike canonical AnkG, these phenotypes appear to be independent of NaV1.5 channel function and instead appear linked with aberrant Ca2+ handling. Collectively, our data support that a single ankyrin gene produces at least two separate products, canonical AnkG and giant AnkG, each with unique roles in cardiac structure and electrical function, the latter of which acts via a novel sodium-channel-independent mechanism in the developing myocardium. Canonical AnkG (ANK3 in human, Ank2 in mice, 190 kD, Fig. 1A) is essential for normal ion channel targeting in neurologic tissue (12Jenkins S.M. Bennett V.

Similarly, giant AnkG isoforms (480 kD and 270 kDa, Fig. 1B) have been identified in neurologic tissue, where they function in the assembly of the AIS and nodes of Ranvier (10Jenkins P.M. Kim N.

Although abnormal expression of canonical AnkG has been demonstrated in both ischemic and traumatic neurologic models (14Doctor R.B. Bennett V. Mandel L.J.

Sci. 2018; 3: 675-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), the presence and role of giant AnkG in cardiovascular tissue are not described. In fact, prior work from Jenkins et al. (10Jenkins P.M. Kim N. Jones S.L. Tseng W.C. Svitkina T.M. Yin H.H. Bennett V. Giant ankyrin-G: A critical innovation in vertebrate evolution of fast and integrated neuronal signaling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2015; 112: 957-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) suggests that giant AnkG is not present in heart and/or expressed at very low levels. To both directly investigate the expression of giant AnkG in the heart (requires robust negative control) and test a potential in vivo role of giant AnkG in heart, we generated a mouse line with cardiac-restricted giant ankyrin-G knockout utilizing techniques described (10Jenkins P.M. Kim N. Jones S.L. Tseng W.C. Svitkina T.M. Yin H.H. Bennett V. Giant ankyrin-G: A critical innovation in vertebrate evolution of fast and integrated neuronal signaling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2015; 112: 957-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The MHC-Cre mice provide myocyte-specific elimination during the first week of life (10Jenkins P.M. Kim N. Jones S.L. Tseng W.C. Svitkina T.M. Yin H.H. Bennett V. Giant ankyrin-G: A critical innovation in vertebrate evolution of fast and integrated neuronal signaling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2015; 112: 957-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We studied male and female Ank3f/f control (flox) mice and cKO mice in the neonatal period (day of life 7) and adulthood (22 weeks of age). Giant AnkG cKO mice were viable and displayed no differences in size, weight, feeding, or grooming. Similar to mice with selective giant AnkG deletion in the brain, cardiac-restricted giant AnkG cKO mice survive neonatal life and demonstrate no gross motor abnormalities (10Jenkins P.M. Kim N. Jones S.L. Tseng W.C. Svitkina T.M. Yin H.H. Bennett V. Giant ankyrin-G: A critical innovation in vertebrate evolution of fast and integrated neuronal signaling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2015; 112: 957-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Giant AnkG cKO animals (neonate and adult) displayed mild left ventricular (LV) dilatation and LV thinning (Fig. 1, C–F) consistent with eccentric hypertrophy. Notably, immunoblots illustrate that giant AnkG is easily detected in heart lysate of mice at 1 week of age (brain utilized as positive control, Fig. 1, G and H). This expression in young hearts is significantly reduced in cKO; absolute cKO heart loss of giant AnkG is likely due to incomplete activity of the αMHC promoter during this time of development and/or giant AnkG expression in nonmyocytes. Further, the expression of giant AnkG was significantly abolished in the cKO mice compared with the floxed littermates at 4 weeks of age, while canonical AnkG protein expression did not vary between the different genotypes (Fig. 1, I and J). Relative expression of the large isoform (qPCR) confirmed near absence of giant AnkG in the 4-week cKO animals (Fig. S1). However, here we demonstrate for the first time that giant AnkG is expressed in cardiac tissue in early development independent of the robust expression of the canonical AnkG isoform. In summary, giant AnkG is expressed in the heart, albeit in significantly lower levels than canonical AnkG. Further, AnkG cKO mice display cardiac structural abnormalities. A primary role of canonical AnkG in the heart has been shown to have occurred through interaction with Nav1.5, the primary cardiac voltage-gated Nav channel (5Mohler P.J. Rivolta I. Napolitano C.

A beta(IV)-spectrin/CaMKII signaling complex is essential for membrane excitability in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2010; 120: 3508-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). However, more recent evidence suggests that canonical AnkG also likely functions in cardiac myofilament integration and is necessary for normal compensatory cardiac remodeling (9Makara M. Curran J. Lubbers E.R. Murphy N.P. Little S.C. Musa H. Smith S.A. Unudurthi S.D. Rajaram M.V.S. Janssen P.M.L. Boyden P.A. Bradley E. Hund T. Mohler P.J. Novel mechanistic roles for ankyrin-G in cardiac remodeling, heart failure, and survival.JACC Basic Transl. Sci. 2018; 3: 675-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), yet the role for giant AnkG in cardiac function has not been determined. We examined gross and histologic specimens to evaluate myocardial structure and function in giant AnkG cKO and control mice (age- (22 weeks) and sex-matched). We observed mild dilatation of the LV chamber (LVID,d 4.2 ± 0.4 versus 3.9 ± 0.3 mm, p < 0.05) and myocardial thinning (LVPW,d 0.55 ± 0.02 versus 0.63 ± 0.02 mm p < 0.05) in cKO animals (Fig. 2, A–D, H–K). Unlike control mice, cKO animals demonstrated increased heart weight when normalized to tibial length (10.6 ± 3.3 versus 6.5 ± 1.2 mg/mm, p < 0.05), indicative of the eccentric remodeling expected in DCM (Fig. 2D). Finally, we observed myocardial fibrosis in cKO animals, consistent with aberrant remodeling (Fig. 2, E–G). Taken together, these findings provide evidence for an eccentric hypertrophy phenotype such as DCM, a disease process that requires fibrosis and abnormal remodeling, as necessary substrate for the development of both structural and electrical dysfunction. To investigate the relationship between structural changes and heart function, we performed serial echocardiograms on animals 12 to 32 weeks in age, at 2-week intervals. We also assessed an aged animal cohort (n = 5 cKO, n = 4 control) to determine if there was further impact upon heart structure and late cardiovascular function (54 weeks). Similar to the pathologic data, we observed in vivo that cKO animals demonstrated hallmarks of a DCM phenotype, including LV enlargement and thinning (Fig. 3). In concert with the structural changes, we found evidence of LV systolic dysfunction in the cKO animals (ejection fraction/EF 54 ± 4% versus 62 ± 6%, p < 0.001). Both structure and functional changes were evident at early ages (12 weeks) and did not appreciably change through 32 weeks of age (cKO 12 versus 32 weeks: LVID,d 3.9 ± 0.2 versus 3.8 ± 0. 2 mm, p = 0.64, LVPW 0.51 ± 0.10 versus 0.50 ± 0.10 mm, p = 0.75, EF 56 ± 5 versus 54 ± 2%, p = 0.41). However, by 54 weeks of age, LV dilatation and dysfunction significantly worsened in the cKO animals (cKO 12 versus 52 weeks: LVID,d 3.9 ± 0.2 versus 4.7 ± 0.3 mm, p < 0.01, EF 56 ± 5 versus 36 ± 7%, p < 0.01) (Fig. 3). Thus, giant AnkG is important in early cardiac development and is necessary for normal neonatal heart function. In the absence of giant AnkG, animals displayed eccentric hypertrophy and systolic dysfunction in early life, with further dilatation and systolic dysfunction late in life, implying that although the structural and functional changes occur early, they may also contribute to more significant phenotypes in late adulthood. Alternatively, low levels of giant AnkG in adult mice may be critical for maintaining cardiac structure. Canonical AnkG is necessary for cardiac Nav1.5 function and recruitment of CaMKIIδ to the intercalated disc. Canonical AnkG loss leads to CaMKII-dependent regulation of INa,L resulting in both conduction defects and arrhythmia (5Mohler P.J. Rivolta I. Napolitano C. LeMaillet G. Lambert S. Priori S.G. Bennett V. Nav1.5 E1053K mutation causing Brugada syndrome blocks binding to ankyrin-G and expression of Nav1.5 on the surface of cardiomyocytes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17533-17538Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 6Makara M.A. Curran J. Little S.C. Musa H. Polina I. Smith S.A. Wright P.J. Unudurthi S.D. Snyder J. Bennett V. Hund T.J. Mohler P.J. Ankyrin-G coordinates intercalated disc signaling platform to regulate cardiac excitability in vivo.Circ. Res. 2014; 115: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Herein, we have shown here that giant AnkG cKO animals demonstrate structural myocardial remodeling and contractile dysfunction (Fig. 2). Given what is known about canonical AnkG in the heart, we hypothesized that the observed structural abnormalities would coexist with electrical dysfunction in the form of ventricular arrhythmias and/or abnormal atrioventricular conduction. Therefore, we tested cardiac-deficient giant AnkG animals to determine if conduction disturbances and arrhythmia were present at rest and/or with catecholamine stimulation. We performed conscious electrocardiographic monitoring at rest on both cKO and control animals. Electrocardiographic tracings revealed no significant differences in resting ECG parameters (cKO versus control; Heart rate (HR): 521 ± 41 versus 539 ± 54 bpm, p = 0.45, PR Interval: 33 ± 0.8 versus 33 ± 1.0 ms, p = 0.85, QTc: 59 ± 3 versus 63 ± 2 ms, p = 0.26) (Fig. S2, Fig. 4, A, F–H). However, with catecholamine exposure, high-degree atrioventricular block was observed more frequently in cKO, versus control mice (Iso: 10 versus 37 events, p < 0.0001; Epi: 3 versus 76 events, p < 0.0001) (Fig. 4, C and E). The same animals displayed significantly more ventricular arrhythmia. However, this only occurred in response to epinephrine (13 versus 64 events, p < 0.0001), as there were no ventricular arrhythmic events in either control or cKO animals in response to the beta-agonist isoproterenol (Fig. 4, B and D). To assess the time-dependent transmembrane potential for clues to the cause of electrical dysfunction in giant AnkG cKO animals, (22 weeks), we paced ventricular myocytes at 0.5 and 1.0 Hz and measured action potential duration and amplitude. There was no significant difference in action potential duration (Fig. 5A) or amplitude (Fig. 5B) at either pacing interval. Similarly, there was no difference in the maximum rate of voltage change (dV/dT) between control and cKO ventricular myocytes (Fig. 5C). We next measured myocyte electrical activity in response to specific protocols. During 0.5 Hz pacing, early afterdepolarizations (EADs) were observed in AnkG cKO myocytes and when present, EADs occasionally gave rise to a spontaneous action potential (Fig. 5D). Next, cardiac myocytes were subject to a S1-S5 protocol where they were paced at successively higher frequencies ranging from 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, and 10.0 Hz for a period of 1 s at each frequency. After cessation pacing, giant AnkG cKO myocytes displayed runs of delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs); these were not observed in control myocytes (Fig. 5E). The presence of resting EADs and post-HFP DADs suggests that giant AnkG-deficient myocytes exhibit susceptibility to increased automaticity, likely impacted by a functional role that giant AnkG plays in myocyte stabilization required for normal electrical conduction and cardiac function. Canonical AnkG functions in concert with the voltage-gated Nav channel (5Mohler P.J. Rivolta I. Napolitano C. LeMaillet G. Lambert S. Priori S.G. Bennett V. Nav1.5 E1053K mutation causing Brugada syndrome blocks binding to ankyrin-G and expression of Nav1.5 on the surface of cardiomyocytes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17533-17538Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Cardiac disease in AnkG cKO animals has been demonstrated to include increased automaticity, arrhythmogenicity, and moderate- and high-grade conduction abnormalities (6Makara M.A. Curran J. Little S.C. Musa H. Polina I. Smith S.A. Wright P.J. Unudurthi S.D. Snyder J. Bennett V. Hund T.J. Mohler P.J. Ankyrin-G coordinates intercalated disc signaling platform to regulate cardiac excitability in vivo.Circ. Res. 2014; 115: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To determine if giant AnkG functions similar to the canonical isoform, we evaluated sodium channel activity in giant AnkG-deficient animals. We performed cardiomyocyte whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings in ventricular myocytes to evaluate NaV1.5-mediated sodium current and found no difference in current density, voltage-dependent inactivation (h’ curve), and time-dependent recovery of INa (Fig. 6, A–D). The action potential and INa findings support that giant AnkG may at least in part function independent of the primary voltage-gated Nav channel in the heart. These data, in combination with the AP recordings, including display of abnormal depolarization (both DADs and EADs) in the setting of normal action potential duration and INa, suggest that giant AnkG may have additional unique functions in the heart. We hypothesized that this could be influenced by calcium dysfunction and therefore analyzed sarcomere length and performed real-time cardiomyocyte functional and calcium studies in neonatal (1 week old) control and cKO animals (n = 4 each group). In the cKO group, myocyte sarcomeres were shorter at baseline (1.64 ± 0.08 versus 1.66 ± 0.11 μm, p < 0.05) and demonstrated increased percent peak shortening (11.1 ± 2.7 versus 9.6 + 3.1%, p < 0.05) when stimulated, albeit with no change in relaxation time (Fig. 7, A–C), consistent with increases in cytosolic Ca2+. To further evaluate potential etiologies for abnormal depolarization and slower Ca2+ reuptake in the cKO group, we performed computer simulations to predict mechanisms for DADs in the absence of overt changes to baseline action potential. We used the Bondarenko model of the murine ventricular action potential (16Bondarenko V.E. Szigeti G.P. Bett G.C. Kim S.J. Rasmusson R.L. Computer model of action potential of mouse ventricular myocytes.Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2004; 287: H1378-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), in which DADs are triggered when concentration of Ca2+-bound calsequestrin (peak CSQN) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) reaches 11.5 (mM). The generated regression coefficient estimates predict that Ca2+ leak, release, and reuptake into SR have a marked effect on peak CSQN with a minimal effect on other action potential properties (Fig. 7D). To further test this hypothesis, these three scaling factors were then incrementally increased over a wide range (0.2 steps starting at 0.1–2.9) and evaluated for their effect on peak CSQN, action potential amplitude, APD75, and max derivative. Ca2+ leak and release from the SR had an inversely proportional relationship with peak CSQN, while increasing the maximal Ca2+ uptake into SR showed an increase in peak CSQN. (Fig. 7E) Action potential amplitude, APD75, and max derivative showed minimal responses to the dramatic changes in SR Ca2+ factors (Fig. 7, F–H). Together, these data indicate that in the heart, giant AnkG functions independent from the primary voltage-gated Nav channel, with evidence for novel roles in Ca2+ metabolism. Given that there is scarce data about giant AnkG function in cardiac tissue, we performed RNA sequencing and transcript analysis of the myocardium in control and cKO male (control n = 3, cKO n = 3) and female (control n = 3, cKO n = 3) animals. In part, we aimed to determine if unique pathways might explain the phenotype we observed, in the presence of normal action potential and INa. In the heart, there were 12,124 total transcripts analyzed. Of these, there were 113 coding transcripts that were either significantly either increased (≥1.5-fold, p < 0.05) or decreased (≤1.5-fold, p < 0.05) in cKO animals irrespective of sex and seven coding transcripts that were significantly increased in both male and female cKO animals (no coding transcripts were ≥1.5-fold decreased in both male and female cKO animals) (Fig. 8A). Of the seven genes upregulated, four were found to be potentially relevant in CVD and included: Epsin 3 (EPN3) (17Messa M. Fernandez-Busnadiego R. Sun E.W. Chen H. Czapla H. Wrasman K. Wu Y. K"
https://openalex.org/W3135768213,"Kola nut (from Cola nitida) is popular in Nigeria and West Africa and is commonly consumed by pregnant women during the first trimester to alleviate morning sickness and dizziness. There is, however, a dearth of information on its effects on the developing brain. This study, therefore, investigated the potential effects of kola nut on the structure of the developing neonatal and juvenile cerebellum in the rat. Pregnant Wistar rats were administered water (as control) or crude (aqueous) kola nut extract at 400, 600, and 800 mg/kg body weight orally, from pregnancy to day 21 after birth. On postnatal days 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28, the pups were weighed, anaesthetised, sacrificed and perfused with neutral buffered formalin. Their brains were dissected out, weighed and the cerebellum preserved in 10% buffered formalin. Paraffin sections of the cerebellum were stained with haematoxylin and eosin for cerebellar cytoarchitecture, cresyl violet stain for Purkinje cell count, Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) immunohistochemistry (IHC) for estimation of gliosis, and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) IHC for apoptosis induction. The kola nut-treated rats exhibited initial reduction in body and brain weights, persistent external granular layer, increased molecular layer thickness, and loss of Bergmann glia. Their Purkinje cells showed reduction in density, loss of dendrites and multiple layering, and their white matter showed neurodegeneration (spongiosis) and GFAP and Bcl-2 over-expression, with evidence of reactive astrogliosis. This study, therefore, demonstrates that kola nut, administered repeatedly at certain doses to pregnant dams, could disrupt normal postnatal cerebellar development in their pups. The findings suggest potential deleterious effects of excessive kola nut consumption on human brain and thus warrant further studies to understand the wider implications for human brain development."

This study seeks to identify whether colony housing of rats exerts a social impact on locomotion behaviors to influence alignment between symptomatic (gait) and structural (bone micro-CT measures, cartilage morphometry, and histology) OA outcome measures. Rats were randomly allocated to conventional (type IV; n = 48) or rat colony cage (RCC; n = 30) housing, further randomized to OA surgical models (ACLT + tMx, MMT or DMM) or no surgery (control), and maintained for 19 weeks during which multiple gait recordings were made. Standard histological grading and bone micro-CT data were collected at necropsy. Principal component analysis was used to summarize the variation in gait, micro-CT or histology. Linear mixed effects model or two-way ANOVA was employed to evaluate the impact of the housing system, surgery and time on gait, or micro-CT and histology components Analyses reveal that RCC exaggerates trends in gait change via a combined effect of the housing system and surgery. Intriguingly, RCC-housed nonoperated control rats showed similar gait changes to rats subjected to surgery; the latter exhibited significant structural joint changes in both systems. Stronger correlation between histological and micro-CT bone changes were found in medial and lateral tibia joint compartments of rats housed in RCC system. This study has established that rat social housing exaggerates outcomes in traditional histological measures of OA, generates stronger links between histology and micro-CT bone changes and removes gait differences as a variable in their etiology."
https://openalex.org/W3134105102,"Recent plant breeding studies of several species have demonstrated the utility of combining molecular assessments of genetic distance into trait-linked SNP genotyping during the development of parent lines to maximize yield gains due to heterosis. SSRs (Short Sequence Repeats) are the molecular marker of choice to determine genetic diversity, but the methods historically used to sequence them have been burdensome. The ability to analyze SSRs in a higher-throughput manner independent of laboratory conditions would increase their utility in molecular ecology, germplasm curation, and plant breeding programs worldwide. This project reports simple bioinformatics methods that can be used to generate genome-wide de novo SSRs in silico followed by targeted Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) validation of those that provide the most information about sub-population identity of a breeding line, which influences heterotic group selection. While these methods were optimized in sorghum [ Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench], they were developed to be applied to any species with a reference genome and high-coverage whole-genome sequencing data of individuals from the sub-populations to be characterized. An analysis of published sorghum genomes selected to represent its five main races (bicolor, caudatum, durra, kafir, and guinea; 75 accessions total) identified 130,120 SSR motifs. Average lengths were 23.8 bp and 95% were between 10 and 92 bp, making them suitable for NGS. Validation through targeted sequencing amplified 188 of 192 assayed SSR loci. Results highlighted the distinctness of accessions from the guinea sub-group margaritiferum from all other sorghum accessions, consistent with previous studies of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. SSRs that efficiently fingerprinted margaritiferum individuals ( Xgma1 –Xgma6 ) are presented. Developing similar fingerprints of other sub-populations ( Xunr1 –Xunr182 ) was not possible due to the extensive admixture between them in the data set analyzed. In summary, these methods were able to fingerprint specific sub-populations when rates of admixture between them are low."
https://openalex.org/W3134192135,"F-box proteins β-TrCP1 and β-TrCP2 are paralogs present in the human genome. They control several cellular processes including cell cycle and DNA damage signaling. Moreover, it is reported that they facilitate DNA damage-induced accumulation of p53 by directing proteasomal degradation of MDM2, a protein that promotes p53 degradation. However, the individual roles of β-TrCP1 and β-TrCP2 in the genotoxic stress-induced activation of cell cycle checkpoints and DNA damage repair remain largely unknown. Here, using biochemical, molecular biology, flow cytometric, and immunofluorescence techniques, we show that β-TrCP1 and β-TrCP2 communicate during genotoxic stress. We found that expression levels of β-TrCP1 are significantly increased while levels of β-TrCP2 are markedly decreased upon induction of genotoxic stress. Further, our results revealed that DNA damage-induced activation of ATM kinase plays an important role in maintaining the reciprocal expression levels of β-TrCP1 and β-TrCP2 via the phosphorylation of β-TrCP1 at Ser158. Phosphorylated β-TrCP1 potently promotes the proteasomal degradation of β-TrCP2 and MDM2, resulting in the activation of p53. Additionally, β-TrCP1 impedes MDM2 accumulation via abrogation of its lysine 63-linked polyubiquitination by β-TrCP2. Thus, β-TrCP1 helps to arrest cells at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and promotes DNA repair upon DNA damage through attenuation of β-TrCP2. Collectively, our findings elucidate an intriguing posttranslational regulatory mechanism of these two paralogs under genotoxic stress and revealed β-TrCP1 as a key player in maintaining the genome integrity through the attenuation of β-TrCP2 levels in response to genotoxic stress. F-box proteins β-TrCP1 and β-TrCP2 are paralogs present in the human genome. They control several cellular processes including cell cycle and DNA damage signaling. Moreover, it is reported that they facilitate DNA damage-induced accumulation of p53 by directing proteasomal degradation of MDM2, a protein that promotes p53 degradation. However, the individual roles of β-TrCP1 and β-TrCP2 in the genotoxic stress-induced activation of cell cycle checkpoints and DNA damage repair remain largely unknown. Here, using biochemical, molecular biology, flow cytometric, and immunofluorescence techniques, we show that β-TrCP1 and β-TrCP2 communicate during genotoxic stress. We found that expression levels of β-TrCP1 are significantly increased while levels of β-TrCP2 are markedly decreased upon induction of genotoxic stress.

The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is mainly responsible for ubiquitination of proteins. Ubiquitination is an important posttranslational modification and is a process of conjugation of ubiquitin to protein (1Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. The ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway: Destruction for the sake of construction.Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3350) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination of proteins is carried out through three major steps by a sequential activity of three classes of enzymes. In the first step, ubiquitin is activated by ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 in the presence of ATP. The activated ubiquitin is then transferred to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2, and finally the activated ubiquitin is transferred to the substrate proteins through E3 ubiquitin ligase enzyme (2Hershko A. Heller H. Elias S. Ciechanover A. Components of ubiquitin-protein ligase system. Resolution, affinity purification, and role in protein breakdown.J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8206-8214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SCF E3 ubiquitin ligases are the largest class of E3 ubiquitin ligases. They play a crucial role in cell cycle progression, cell proliferation, DNA damage, apoptosis, and many other cellular functions (3Zheng N. Wang Z. Wei W. Ubiquitination-mediated degradation of cell cycle-related proteins by F-box proteins.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2016; 73: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). SCF complex is a multisubunit complex comprising three invariable components SKP1, Cullin1 (Cul1), Rbx1, and a variable component F-box protein (4Zheng N. Schulman B.A. Song L. Miller J.J. Jeffrey P.D. Wang P. Chu C. Koepp D.M. Elledge S.J. Pagano M. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Harper J.W. Pavletich N.P. Structure of the Cul1-Rbx1-Skp1-F boxSkp2 SCF ubiquitin ligase complex.Nature. 2002; 416: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). F-box protein β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP) is a component of SCF (SKP1, Cul1, and F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. It is well established that β-TrCP recognizes substrates having consensus sequence DSGXXS degron to promote their proteasomal degradation (5Frescas D. Pagano M. Deregulated proteolysis by the F-box proteins SKP2 and β-TrCP: Tipping the scales of cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 438-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). In the human genome, β-TrCP has two paralogs (namely β-TrCP1 and β-TrCP2) (6Suzuki H. Chiba T. Kobayashi M. Takeuchi M. Suzuki T. Ichiyama A. Ikenoue T. Omata M. Furuichi K. Tanaka K.

Commun. 1999; 256: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Previous study showed that β-TrCP1 knockout mice are viable with reduced fertility (7Guardavaccaro D. Kudo Y. Boulaire J.

Cell. 2003; 4: 799-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). It is also reported that MEFs from β-TrCP1 knockout mice display mitotic abnormalities with centrosome overduplication and chromosome misalignment indicating that it plays important role in progression of mitosis (7Guardavaccaro D.

Cell. 2003; 4: 799-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In contrast, β-TrCP2 knockout mice died before embryonic day 10.5 indicating that these two paralogs have distinct cellular function (8Nakagawa T. Araki T. Nakagawa M. Hirao A. Unno M. Nakayama K.

Several studies have shown that cellular functions of β-TrCP1 and β-TrCP2 are indistinguishable and therefore maximum studies cited them as β-TrCP (5Frescas D. Pagano M.

Hence, it was difficult to understand whether the study is related to β-TrCP1 or β-TrCP2. β-TrCP1 and β-TrCP2 form homo and heterodimer by utilizing their dimerization domain; however, homodimer is more functional in promoting the degradation of its substrate (11Suzuki H.

It was reported that β-TrCP can function as either tumor suppressor or oncogene or both in a context-dependent manner (5Frescas D. Pagano M.

The cross talk of two family members of β-TrCP in the regulation of cell autophagy and growth.Cell Death Differ. 2020; 27: 1119-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Generally, perturbation of function of tumor suppressor and/or oncogene results in impairment of DNA damage response/repair that gives rise to chromosomal instability and cancer predisposition (19Dasika G.K.

Previous studies showed that β-TrCP plays important roles in DNA damage response and maintains the genome integrity by controlling multiple substrates (17Wang Z. Liu P. Inuzuka H. Wei W.

CRL ubiquitin ligases and DNA damage response.Front. Oncol. 2012; 2: 29Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For instance, β-TrCP promotes CReP degradation upon DNA damage to shut down the translational machinery through inactivation of eIF2α (24Loveless T.B. Topacio B.R. Vashisht A.A. Galaang S.

It is also reported that β-TrCP downregulates Cdc25A to maintain intra-S-phase checkpoint (16Busino L. Donzelli M. Chiesa M. Guardavaccaro D. Ganoth D. Dorrello N.V. Hershko A. Pagano M. Draetta G.F. Degradation of Cdc25A by β-TrCP during S phase and in response to DNA damage.Nature. 2003; 426: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) while SCFβTrCP-mediated Claspin degradation is important for checkpoint recovery during genotoxic stress (25Mailand N.

Cell. 2006; 23: 307-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Recent studies showed that β-TrCP directs the degradation of MDM2 in response to DNA damage to initiate DNA damage response pathway through activation of p53 (21Inuzuka H. Tseng A. Gao D. Zhai B.

DNA damage-induced activation of ATM promotes β-TRCPmediated Mdm2 ubiquitination and destruction.Oncotarget. 2012; 3: 1026-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar); however, it is not clear whether β-TrCP1 or β-TrCP2 is involved in DNA damage-induced activation of p53. β-TrCP also promotes the degradation of pro-caspase-3 to protect the cells from DNA damage-induced apoptotic cell death (26Tan M. Gallegos J.R. Gu Q. Huang Y. Li J. Jin Y. Lu H. Sun Y. SAG/ROC-SCFβ-TrCP E3 ubiquitin ligase promotes pro-caspase-3 degradation as a mechanism of apoptosis protection.Neoplasia. 2006; 8: 1042-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Though numerous studies have been done to understand the role of β-TrCP in DNA damage response; however, distinct role of individual β-TrCP1 and β-TrCP2 in DNA damage response and repair is poorly understood. Our study established that tumor suppressor β-TrCP1 promotes the degradation of β-TrCP2 following genotoxic stress to facilitate the activation of cell cycle checkpoint and DNA damage repair to maintain the genomic stability. β-TrCP functions as a tumor suppressor/oncogene in a context-dependent manner. Tumor suppressor as well as oncogene plays key role during genotoxic stress. Several studies showed that β-TrCP plays a crucial role in DNA damage response. However, during genotoxic stress, role of β-TrCP1 and β-TrCP2 at the individual level is largely unknown. Toward this, first we examined the levels of β-TrCP1 and β-TrCP2 following exposure to genotoxic stress by either radiation (UV and IR) or oxidative stress (H2O2) in MCF7 cells. Interestingly, we observed that β-TrCP1 levels were significantly increased while β-TrCP2 levels were markedly declined following DNA damage induction (Fig. 1A). Similar results were also observed in HCT116 cells, indicating that DNA damage-induced differential expression of β-TrCP1 and β-TrCP2 is a general phenomenon (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, the converse correlation of their expression was observed in single-strand break (UV radiation and H2O2) and double-strand break (ionizing radiation) DNA damage induction, indicating that the observed phenomenon is also not specific to a particular type of DNA damage (Fig. 1, A and B). To further support our observation, we examined the levels of β-TrCP1 and β-TrCP2 following exposure to different doses of IR. Results showed a dose-dependent ablation of β-TrCP2 levels with concomitant increased levels of β-TrCP1 (Fig. 1, C and D). To prevent the deleterious effects of DNA damage and to maintain the genome integrity, cells attempt to repair their genome. We therefore asked whether there is any correlation of differential expression of β-TrCP1 and β-TrCP2 during DNA damage response and repair. To address this, first we examined the expression levels of β-TrCP1 and β-TrCP2 for a period of 24 h post irradiation. Immunoblotting results showed that levels of β-TrCP1 were increased with decreased levels of β-TrCP2 till 6 h post IR and then β-TrCP1 was decreasing with concomitant increasing levels of β-TrCP2 to restore their cellular levels at 24 h post irradiation (Fig. 1E). To further support this observation, we performed immunofluorescence study. In agreement with the immunoblotting data, immunofluorescence results also showed a converse correlation in the expression levels of β-TrCP1 and β-TrCP2 following genotoxic stress (Fig. 1, F and G). Collectively, our results demonstrated that β-TrCP1 and β-TrCP2 levels are differentially regulated upon DNA damage. Next, we were interested to understand the mechanism of the genotoxic-stress-induced differential expression of β-TrCP. The observed differential expression of β-TrCP1 and β-TrCP2 following genotoxic stresses could be either at the transcriptional level or at the posttranslational level. We, therefore, first monitored the mRNA levels of β-TrCP1 and β-TrCP2 following DNA damage. The real-time RT-PCR results showed that mRNA levels of β-TrCP1 and β-TrCP2 remained unaltered following genotoxic stress (Fig. 2, A and B), indicating that DNA damage-induced differential expression of β-TrCP1 and β-TrCP2 could be at the posttranscriptional level. To explore this, we have irradiated cells in the absence and presence of proteasomal inhibitor MG132. Immunoblotting results showed that IR-induced ablation of β-TrCP2 was markedly blocked following inhibition of proteasome by MG132 at 4 h post irradiation (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, ablation of β-TrCP1 was also significantly inhibited following treatment of MG132 at 24 h post irradiation (Fig. 2C). In addition, we performed cycloheximide chase assay and results revealed that half-life of β-TrCP2 is shortened following genotoxic stress (Fig. 2, D and E). As expected, the half-life of β-TrCP1 was extended following irradiation (Fig. 2, D and E). To further authenticate the proteasomal regulation of β-TrCP2, we examined the polyubiquitinated levels of β-TrCP2 following genotoxic stress. Immunoblotting of immunoprecipitates showed that the levels of polyubiquitinated β-TrCP2 were significantly increased at 4 h post irradiation (Fig. 2F). Collectively, these results suggest that β-TrCP2 undergoes proteasomal degradation at the early time point of genotoxic stress induction. The preceding results demonstrate that β-TrCP1 is accumulated and β-TrCP2 is degraded upon induction of DNA damage (Figs. 1 and 2). A previous study showed that β-TrCP1 and β-TrCP2 regulate each other at the proteasomal level (18Cui D. Dai X. Shu J. Ma Y. Wei D. Xiong X. Zhao Y. The cross talk of two family members of β-TrCP in the regulation of cell autophagy and growth.Cell Death Differ. 2020; 27: 1119-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We therefore posit that β-TrCP1 might be involved in degradation of β-TrCP2 following induction of DNA damage. To test this, β-TrCP2 levels were monitored in MCF7 cells expressing either NS (non-silencing shRNA) or β-TrCP1 shRNA following exposure to IR. Immunoblotting results revealed that DNA damage-induced β-TrCP2 ablation was markedly blocked in β-TrCP1 knockdown cells, indicating that β-TrCP1 plays an important role in proteasomal attenuation of β-TrCP2 upon induction of DNA damage (Fig. 3A). To support our observation, we examined the levels of β-TrCP2 in HCT116 cells following depletion of β-TrCP1. Results revealed that DNA damage-induced degradation of β-TrCP2 was significantly blocked in β-TrCP1-depleted HCT116 cells (Fig. S1A). To support our immunoblotting results, we performed immunofluorescence study. In agreement with the immunoblotting results, we found that DNA damage-induced ablation of TrCP2 is markedly blocked in β-TrCP1 depleted cells (Fig. 3B and Fig. S1B). To further authenticate the involvement of β-TrCP1 in DNA damage-induced ablation of β-TrCP2, we examined the levels of β-TrCP2 following ectopic expression of the wild type and the F-box motif deleted β-TrCP1 mutant (ΔF-β-TrCP1) in β-TrCP1-depleted cells. Immunoblotting results showed that DNA damage-induced ablation of β-TrCP2 in β-TrCP1 depleted cells was resumed following ectopic expression of the wild-type β-TrCP1 but not with the mutant ΔF-β-TrCP1 (Fig. 3C). Next we examined how the regulation of β-TrCP2 by β-TrCP1 is happening through SCF complex under normal condition. We found that, unlike β-TrCP1, ΔF-β-TrCP1 could not promote the degradation of β-TrCP2 (Fig. S1C). Taken together, these results suggest that β-TrCP1 directs the DNA damage-induced degradation of β-TrCP2 through SCF complex. To authenticate the SCF complex-dependent event, expression levels of β-TrCP2 were examined following depletion of Cul1 upon genotoxic stress. Immunoblotting result showed that DNA damage-induced degradation of β-TrCP2 was impaired upon Cul1 depletion (Fig. S1D). Further, cycloheximide chase immunoblotting assay was performed to examine the stability of β-TrCP2. Result revealed that DNA damage-induced turnover of β-TrCP2 is declined in β-TrCP1 knockdown cells (Fig. 3D and Fig. S1E). Next, polyubiquitinated levels of β-TrCP2 were examined in β-TrCP1 knockdown cells under genotoxic stress. We found that DNA damage-induced polyubiquitinated levels of β-TrCP2 were sharply declined following depletion of β-TrCP1 (Fig. 3E). Finally, we investigated whether the degradation of β-TrCP2 following DNA damage is due to its enhanced interaction with β-TrCP1, which further leads to polyubiquitination-mediated degradation. To test this, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiment. Immunoblotting of immunoprecipitates revealed that the interaction of β-TrCP1 with β-TrCP2 was significantly increased at 4 h and then declined to basal level interaction at 24 h post irradiation (Fig. 3F). Collectively, these results showed that accumulated β-TrCP1 directs the proteasomal degradation of β-TrCP2 under genotoxic stress. The above described results prompted us to examine how β-TrCP1 is empowered to direct the degradation of β-TrCP2 under genotoxic stresses. We speculated that DNA damage signaling pathways might play crucial role in this process. Among the DNA damage signaling pathways, ATM kinase plays a pivotal role in double-strand DNA damage response and repair processes (27Khanna K.K. Lavin M.F. Jackson S.P. Mulhern T.D. ATM, a central controller of cellular responses to DNA damage.Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 1052-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 28Matsuoka S. Ballif B.A. Smogorzewska A. McDonald E.R. Hurov K.E. Luo J. Bakalarski C.E. Zhao Z. Solimini N. Lerenthal Y. Shiloh Y. Gygi S.P. Elledge S.J. ATM and ATR substrate analysis reveals extensive protein networks responsive to DNA damage.Science. 2007; 316: 1160-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (2361) Google Scholar). It is reported that ATM phosphorylates approximately 700 substrates having SQ/TQ site (28Matsuoka S. Ballif B.A. Smogorzewska A. McDonald E.R. Hurov K.E. Luo J. Bakalarski C.E. Zhao Z. Solimini N. Lerenthal Y. Shiloh Y. Gygi S.P. Elledge S.J. ATM and ATR substrate analysis reveals extensive protein networks responsive to DNA damage.Science. 2007; 316: 1160-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (2361) Google Scholar). Interestingly, analysis of the β-TrCP1 and β-TrCP2 amino acid sequences revealed the presence of one putative ATM phosphorylation site present in β-TrCP1 at Ser-158 position, which is conserved among the vertebrates (Fig. 4A). In contrast, β-TrCP2 does not have ATM phosphorylation site. We therefore reasoned that ATM might be involved in the accumulation as well as empowerment of β-TrCP1 to facilitate the degradation of β-TrCP2 upon DNA damage. To test this possibility, we performed a series of experiments. First, the cells were exposed to ionizing radiation in the absence and presence of an ATM inhibitor. The results showed that the DNA damage-induced accumulation of β-TrCP1 as well as downregulation of β-TrCP2 expression is significantly abrogated upon inactivation of ATM (Fig. 4B). Proteasomal degradation of protein warrants its polyubiquitination. We therefore examined the levels of polyubiquitinated β-TrCP2 following induction of genotoxic stress in the absence and presence of ATM inhibitor. Immunoblotting of immunoprecipitates demonstrated that DNA damage-induced polyubiquitinated β-TrCP2 levels were markedly declined following inactivation of ATM (Fig. 4C). To understand how ATM inactivation abrogates DNA damage-induced polyubiquitination of β-TrCP2, we asked whether ATM plays any role in the interaction of substrate (β-TrCP2) and receptor (β-TrCP1). Immunoblotting of immunoprecipitates revealed that the interaction of β-TrCP1 and β-TrCP2 was sharply increased following induction of DNA damage (Fig. S2A) and was sharply diminished following inactivation of ATM (Fig. S2A). These results suggest that ATM-mediated phosphorylation of β-TrCP1 at Ser158 position might be playing an important role for its accumulation as well as interaction between β-TrCP1 and β-TrCP2. To test this possibility, we generated the wild-type, phosphorylation mimetic (S158D) and phosphorylation defective (S158A) mutants of β-TrCP1. Immunoblotting results demonstrated that ectopically expressed β-TrCP1 is significantly accumulated following induction of genotoxic stress, which was abrogated following inactivation of ATM (Fig. 4D). In contrast, phosphorylation defective β-TrCP1 mutant failed to accumulate following induction of DNA damage (Fig. 4D), indicating that ATM plays role in accumulation of β-TrCP1 upon genotoxic stress. To further support our observation, we examined phosphorylated levels of the wild type and the mutant (S158A) β-TrCP1 following irradiation. Results revealed that phospho-serine levels of the wild-type β-TrCP1 were significantly increased upon induction of genotoxic stress, which was significantly declined following inhibition of ATM (Fig. S2B). In contrast, we did not observe any delectable change in phospho serine levels of the mutant (S158A) β-TrCP1 following induction of DNA damage, indicating that ATM phosphorylates β-TrCP1 at Ser158 position (Fig. S2B). Next, we investigated why the phosphorylated form of β-TrCP1 is accumulated upon DNA damage. Is it because of incompetency of β-TrCP2 to target the phosphorylated β-TrCP1? To explore this possibility, we examined the levels of β-TrCP1 phosphomimetic S158D mutant following ectopic expression β-TrCP2. Result showed that unlike the wild-type β-TrCP1, the β-TrCP1(S158D) mutant is resistant toward degradation by β-TrCP2, indicating that ATM-mediated phosphorylation at Ser158 protects β-TrCP1 from β-TrCP2-mediated degradation upon DNA damage (Fig. 4E). Further, co-immunoprecipitation results demonstrated that inability of β-TrCP2 to degrade β-TrCP1 was neither due to disruption of β-TrCP1 and β-TrCP2 interaction nor due to preferential homodimer formation of β-TrCP1 (Fig. S2, C and D). Finally, we examined the polyubiquitinated levels of β-TrCP1 wild type and S158D mutant following expression of β-TrCP2. Results revealed that β-TrCP2 facilitates the polyubiquitination of the wild-type β-TrCP1, as expected, but failed to do so for the β-TrCP1(S158D) mutant (Fig. 4F). Thus, ATM protects β-TrCP1 from the E3 SCFβ-TrCP2-mediated proteasomal degradation under genotoxic stress. F-box proteins are the substrate receptor in SCF complex. Our preceding results showed that β-TrCP1 directs proteasomal degradation of β-TrCP2 upon genotoxic stress. We then asked whether β-TrCP1 targets the single form of β-TrCP2 (non-SCF complex form). To address this we generated F-box motif deleted β-TrCP2 mutant (Fig. 5A). Immunoblotting results showed that the F-box motif deleted β-TrCP2 undergoes degradation upon genotoxic stress (Fig. 5B). We also found that DNA damage-induced degradation of the F-box motif deleted β-"
https://openalex.org/W3135845984,"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Long-term use of antiplatelet drugs is a well-studied therapy for the prevention of cardiovascular death. Ensuring compliance with lifelong administration of antiplatelet drugs, in particular acetylsalicylic acid, is one of the challenges of such therapy. The aim of this study is to explore the possibility of using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to identify acetylsalicylic acid metabolites in urine and to search for characteristic markers that could be used to detect patient compliance with long-term acetylsalicylic acid treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3135099303,"Deuterium (D), the second most abundant isotope of hydrogen is present in natural waters at an approximate concentration of 145–155 ppm (ca. 1.5E-4 atom/atom). D is known to influence various biological processes due to its physical and chemical properties, which significantly differ from those of hydrogen. For example, increasing D-concentration to &gt;1000-fold above its natural abundance has been shown to increase the frequency of genetic mutations in several species. An interesting deterministic hypothesis, formulated with the intent of explaining the mechanism of D-mutagenicity is based on the calculation that the theoretical probability of base pairs to comprise two adjacent D-bridges instead of H-bridges is 2.3E-8, which is equal to the mutation rate of certain species. To experimentally challenge this hypothesis, and to infer the mutagenicity of D present at natural concentrations, we investigated the effect of a nearly 100-fold reduction of D concentration on the bacterial mutation rate. Using fluctuation tests, we measured the mutation rate of three Escherichia coli genes ( cycA , ackA and galK ) in media containing D at either &lt;2 ppm or 150 ppm concentrations. Out of 15 pair-wise fluctuation analyses, nine indicated a significant decrease, while three marked the significant increase of the mutation/culture value upon D-depletion. Overall, growth in D-depleted minimal medium led to a geometric mean of 0.663-fold (95% confidence interval: 0.483–0.911) change in the mutation rate. This falls nowhere near the expected 10,000-fold reduction, indicating that in our bacterial systems, the effect of D abundance on the formation of point mutations is not deterministic. In addition, the combined results did not display a statistically significant change in the mutation/culture value, the mutation rate or the mutant frequency upon D-depletion. The potential mutagenic effect of D present at natural concentrations on E . coli is therefore below the limit of detection using the indicated methods."
https://openalex.org/W3135151585,"Transient ground displacement (TGD) that is caused by earthquakes can damage underground pipes. This damage is especially critical for the joints, elbows and tees of the pipes which play an important role in the operation of a pipe network. In this study, a scale pipe network with both elbows and tees, as well as some components of the pipe network with only tees or elbows, has been investigated. The response of the nodes of a pipe network, when installed in non-uniform geology, was analyzed using the shaking table test and ABAQUS finite element simulation. This paper has firstly introduced the preparation of the test and the developed finite element model. Then the system response in terms of strain, the friction, the bending deformation, the node deformation amplification coefficient and the pipe-soil relative displacement along the pipe axis of the pipe network and two pipe network components have been analyzed explaining the correlation between these responses. Finally, the influence of elbows and tees on the pipe network was analyzed, and the conclusions that have been reached about how tees and elbows can change the response of a pipe network during an earthquake can provide theoretical support for the seismic design and layout of an underground pipe network."
https://openalex.org/W3133678434,"The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services identified unplanned hospital readmissions as a critical healthcare quality and cost problem. Improvements in hospital discharge decision-making and post-discharge care are needed to address the problem. Utilization of clinical decision support (CDS) can improve discharge decision-making but little is known about the empirical significance of two opposing problems that can occur: (1) negligible uptake of CDS by providers or (2) over-reliance on CDS and underuse of other information. This paper reports an experiment where, in addition to electronic medical records (EMR), clinical decision-makers are provided subjective reports by standardized patients, or CDS information, or both. Subjective information, reports of being eager or reluctant for discharge, was obtained during examinations of standardized patients, who are regularly employed in medical education, and in our experiment had been given scripts for the experimental treatments. The CDS tool presents discharge recommendations obtained from econometric analysis of data from de-identified EMR of hospital patients. 38 clinical decision-makers in the experiment, who were third and fourth year medical students, discharged eight simulated patient encounters with an average length of stay 8.1 in the CDS supported group and 8.8 days in the control group. When the recommendation was “Discharge,” CDS uptake of “Discharge” recommendation was 20% higher for eager than reluctant patients. Compared to discharge decisions in the absence of patient reports: (i) odds of discharging reluctant standardized patients were 67% lower in the CDS-assisted group and 40% lower in the control (no-CDS) group; whereas (ii) odds of discharging eager standardized patients were 75% higher in the control group and similar in CDS-assisted group. These findings indicate that participants were neither ignoring nor over-relying on CDS."
https://openalex.org/W3135291339,"The increasing prevalence of obesity among the institutionalised elderly population and its severe consequences on health requires an early and accurate diagnosis that can be easily achieved in any clinical setting. This study aimed to determine new cut-off values for anthropometric and bioelectrical impedance measures that are superior to body mass index criteria for overweight and obesity status in a sample of Spanish institutionalised elderly population. A total of 211 institutionalised older adults (132 women, aged 84.3±7.3 years; 79 men, aged 81.5±7.3 years) were enrolled in the current cross-sectional study. Anthropometric and bioelectrical impedance measures included the body mass index, waist circumference, gluteal circumference, waist-hip ratio, sagittal-abdominal diameter, trunk fat, and visceral-fat ratio. In women, the waist circumference, gluteal circumference, sagittal-abdominal diameter, trunk fat, and visceral-fat index presented strongly significant specificity and sensitivity (area under the curve [AUC], p&lt;0.0001) and elevated discriminative values (receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curves: 0.827 to 0.867) for overweight and obesity status. In men, the waist-hip ratio, waist circumference, gluteal circumference, sagittal-abdominal diameter, trunk fat, and visceral-fat ratio were strongly significant AUC (p&lt;0.0001), with moderate-to-high values (ROC curves: 0.757–0.871). In conclusion, our findings suggest that gluteal circumference, waist circumference, and sagittal-abdominal diameter in women and trunk fat, visceral-fat ratio, and waist circumference in men may represent more suitable cut-off values superior to body mass index criteria for overweight and obesity in the Spanish institutionalised elderly population."
https://openalex.org/W3135342547,"Objectives To investigate the growth velocity-improving effects of vitamin D replacement therapy in pediatric patients diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency. Study design A retrospective cohort study was conducted in 34 pediatric patients diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency. Based on the clinical findings, the subjects were divided into two groups: a bowed leg (BL) group and a non-bowed leg (non-BL) group. After the initiation of alfacalcidol, the standard deviation score (SDS) of their heights, weights and growth velocities in each group were monitored. Results The median age at the first visit was significantly lesser in the BL group (1.58 years old [interquartile range (IQR): 1.33, 2.17]) than that in the non-BL group (3.00 years old [IQR: 2.33, 3.67]). On the contrary, the SDS for height was significantly lower in the non-BL group (-2.27 [IQR: -2.63, -1.94]) than that in the BL group (-1.37 [IQR: -1.91, -1.07]). One-year treatment with alfacalcidol showed significant improvements in both height SDSs and growth velocity SDSs not only in the BL group but also in the non-BL group. Conclusions The current study revealed that vitamin D replacement therapy improved the growth rate in children with vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency, regardless of the presence of BL. This study emphasizes the importance of assessing the vitamin D status in children with poor growth rates and suggests that alfacalcidol could be a valid option for the treatment of short stature."
https://openalex.org/W3135373228,"A novel assay technique that involves quantification of lysozyme (Lys) through machine learning is put forward here. This article reports the tendency of the well- documented Ellington group anti-Lys aptamer, to produce aggregates when exposed to Lys. This property of apta-aggregation has been exploited here to develop an assay that quantifies the Lys using texture and area parameters from a photograph of the elliptical aggregate mass through machine learning. Two assay sets were made for the experimental procedure: one with high Lys concentration between 25–100 mM and another with low concentration between 1–20 mM. The high concentration set had a sample volume of 10 μl while the low concentration set had a higher sample volume of 100 μl, in order to obtain the statistical texture values reliably from the aggregate mass. The platform exhibited an experimental limit of detection of 1 mM and a response time of less than 10 seconds. Further, two potential operating modes for the aptamer were hypothesized for this aggregation property and the more accurate mode among the two was ascertained through bioinformatics studies."

Adults with history of prehypertension, hypertension, or were taking hypertension drugs in 2006 were excluded. Participants with implausibly high or low daily total energy intakes (<600 kcal/d or >5000 kcal/d) were excluded. Pregnant women, breastfeeding women, and people with motor impairment were excluded.People with abnormal blood pressure ingested a lower percent of dietary fat taken from seafood (P < 0.001) and a higher percent of dietary fat taken from fast food (P < 0.001). Dietary fat obtained from seafood and dairy products can be protective against abnormal blood pressure with a RR = 0.01 (95% CI: 0.001 to 0.25; P = 0.004) for seafood, and RR = 0.14 (95% CI: 0.04 to 0.44; P = 0.001) for egg, milk, and dairy products.Seafood, egg, milk, and dairy products can be recommended as sources of dietary fat to reduce the incidence of hypertension and prehypertension while fast food should be avoided."
