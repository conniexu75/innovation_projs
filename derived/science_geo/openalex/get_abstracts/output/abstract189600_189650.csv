We demonstrate the presence of the ascorbate-glutathione cycle in purified Arabidopsis mitochondria using enzymatic activity, proteomic and in vitro and in vivo subcellular targeting data that identify the gene products responsible. In vitro experiments using a dual import assay assessing mitochondrial and chloroplast imports simultaneously show dual targeting of ascorbate peroxidase, monodehydroascorbate reductase, and glutathione reductase gene products to mitochondria and chloroplasts, while a putative dehydroascorbate reductase protein is only imported into mitochondria. In vivo subcellular localization using green fluorescent protein fusion proteins show clear targeting of all gene products to mitochondria. Transcript levels show these genes are induced by oxidative chemical stresses targeted to chloroplasts and/or mitochondria and are elevated during photosynthetic operation in the light. Together these data present a model of an integrated ascorbate-glutathione antioxidant defense common to plastids and mitochondria that is linked at the level of the genome in Arabidopsis.

Together these data present a model of an integrated ascorbate-glutathione antioxidant defense common to plastids and mitochondria that is linked at the level of the genome in Arabidopsis. The ascorbate-glutathione cycle is catalyzed by a set of four enzymes, ascorbate peroxidase (APX), 1The abbreviations used are: APXascorbate peroxidaseAscascorbateDHARglutathione-dependent dehydroascorbate reductaseGRglutathione reductaseGDXNglutaredoxinMDHARmonodehydroascorbate reductaseGFPgreen fluorescent protein.1The abbreviations used are: APXascorbate peroxidaseAscascorbateDHARglutathione-dependent dehydroascorbate reductaseGRglutathione reductaseGDXNglutaredoxinMDHARmonodehydroascorbate reductaseGFPgreen fluorescent protein. monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR), glutathione-dependent dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR), and glutathione reductase (GR). This cycle operates in chloroplasts of plants in order to remove the large amounts of H2O2 generated during photosynthetic operations in the light through thylakoid electron transport chain components with electrochemical potentials capable of direct reduction of O2 (1Asada K. Takahashi M. Kyle D. Osmond C. Arntzen C. Photoinhibition. Elsevier, Amsterdam1987: 227-287Google Scholar). The highest rates of O2 reduction occur on the reducing side of photosystem I (1Asada K. Takahashi M. Kyle D. Osmond C. Arntzen C. Photoinhibition. Elsevier, Amsterdam1987: 227-287Google Scholar). The high specific activity of these enzymes in plastids and extensive work on its operation clearly indicates that this is the major H2O2 metabolizing pathway in these photosynthetic organelles (2Noctor G. Foyer C.H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 249-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4398) Google Scholar). The primary peroxidation of ascorbate (Asc) by APX yields the monodehydroascorbate radical (MDHA) that is either directly reduced back to Asc by MDHAR (3Arrigoni O. Dipierro S. Borraccino G. FEBS Lett. 1981; 125: 242-244Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar) or undergoes non-enzymatic disproportionation to ascorbate and dehydroascorbate (DHA). Recovery of the DHA produced occurs via the glutathione-dependent reaction catalyzed by DHAR, and the oxidized glutathione dimers are re-reduced by the NADPH-dependent GR (4Foyer C.H. Halliwell B. Planta. 1976; 133: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar). ascorbate peroxidase ascorbate glutathione-dependent dehydroascorbate reductase glutathione reductase glutaredoxin monodehydroascorbate reductase green fluorescent protein. ascorbate peroxidase ascorbate glutathione-dependent dehydroascorbate reductase glutathione reductase glutaredoxin monodehydroascorbate reductase green fluorescent protein. The chloroplast Asc-glutathione cycle is housed primarily in the stroma (see review in Ref. 5Asada K. Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol. Mol. Biol. 1999; 150: 601-639Crossref Scopus (3126) Google Scholar). A stromal APX and a thylakoid-bound APX have been identified and purified from several plant species. An extended C-terminal sequence on the thylakoid APX facilitates binding to the membrane and makes this isoform ∼5 kDa larger than the stromal APX (5Asada K. Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol. Mol. Biol. 1999; 150: 601-639Crossref Scopus (3126) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis in a variety of plants clearly delineates the two chloroplast APX classes from the cytosolic APX isoforms (6Jespersen H.M. Kjaersgard I.V. Ostergaard L. Welinder K.G. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The MDHA formed in the lumen disproportionates to DHA and penetrates the thylakoid membrane into the stroma. MDHA produced by both APX isoforms is reduced by stromal MDHAR. This enzyme is not present in the lumen, and chloroplast isoforms are differentiated from cyotosolic isoforms by the presence of N-terminal targeting sequences (5Asada K. Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol. Mol. Biol. 1999; 150: 601-639Crossref Scopus (3126) Google Scholar, 7Obara K. Sumi K. Fukuda H. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). DHAR and GR activities convert the DHA translocated from the lumen and the DHA generated in the stroma. Detailed enzymatic investigation and establishment of the stromal location of these enzymes have been reported (5Asada K. Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol. Mol. Biol. 1999; 150: 601-639Crossref Scopus (3126) Google Scholar, 8Hossain M.A. Asada K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1984; 25: 85-92Google Scholar, 9Creissen G. Reynolds H. Xue Y. Mullineaux P. Plant J. 1995; 8: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). A series of reports have also measured the activity of some of the enzymes of the Asc-glutathione cycle in mitochondrial preparations from plants (9Creissen G. Reynolds H. Xue Y. Mullineaux P. Plant J. 1995; 8: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 10Prasad T.K. Anderson M.D. Stewart C.R.

Planta. 1990; 180: 278-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Evidence for a complete, chloroplast-like, Asc-glutathione cycle in plant mitochondria has also been presented. In green leaves, a mitochondrial cycle has been proposed to cope with photosynthetic and environmental stress-induced oxidative stress (15Jimenez A. Hernandez J.A. Del Rio L.A. Sevilla F. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). In the microaerobic environment of N2-fixing legume root nodules, a mitochondrial Asc-glutathione cycle is proposed to remove mitochondrial-derived radicals to protect sensitive sites including the heme of leghemeoglobin (16Dalton D.A.

Dalton D.A. Becana M. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 2001; 14: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The latency of mitochondrial APX activities is generally low suggesting a location outside of the inner mitochondrial membrane (16Dalton D.A. Baird L.M. Langeberg L. Taugher C.Y. Anyan W.R. Vance C.P. Sarath G. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 17Iturbe-Ormaetxe I. Matamoros M.A. Rubio M.C. Dalton D.A. Becana M. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 2001; 14: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). APX is predominantly membrane-localized in plant mitochondria (12De Leonardis S. Dipierro N. Dipierro S. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2000; 38: 773-779Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 15Jimenez A. Hernandez J.A. Del Rio L.A. Sevilla F.

Plant Microbe Interact. 2001; 14: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The best collective evidence for MDHAR, DHAR, and GR presence is from Pisum sativum leaves (9Creissen G. Reynolds H. Xue Y. Mullineaux P. Plant J. 1995; 8: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 14Edwards E.A. Rawsthorne S. Mullineaux P.M. Planta. 1990; 180: 278-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 15Jimenez A. Hernandez J.A. Del Rio L.A. Sevilla F. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar) and Phaseolus valgaris nodules (17Iturbe-Ormaetxe I. Matamoros M.A. Rubio M.C. Dalton D.A. Becana M. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 2001; 14: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These biochemical data indicate much of the MDHAR, DHAR, and GR to be in the mitochondrial matrix (9Creissen G. Reynolds H. Xue Y. Mullineaux P. Plant J. 1995; 8: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 14Edwards E.A. Rawsthorne S. Mullineaux P.M.

Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). However the actual proteins and the associated genes that are responsible for these activities in plants have not been systematically investigated. As a result, it has been unclear to what degree these biochemical data represent true mitochondrial enzymes and to what degree they may be compromised by the presence of plastidic, peroxisomal, or cytosolic contaminations. In mammalian mitochondria, glutathione peroxidases and glutaredoxins are found to function in the direct depletion of H2O2 (18Netto L.E. Kowaltowski A.J. Castilho R.F. Vercesi A.E. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 348: 260-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A mitochondria matrix-localized thioredoxin-dependent peroxidase is also proposed to be responsible for H2O2 depletion in mammals (19Miranda-Vizuete A. Damdimopoulos A.E. Spyrou G. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2000; 2: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In yeast both an intermembrane space localized cytochrome c peroxidase and a matrix thioredoxin-dependent peroxidase have been implicated in H2O2 removal (20Pedrajas J.R. Miranda-Vizuete A. Javanmardy N. Gustafsson J.A. Spyrou G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16296-16301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We have already identified a putative thioredoxin-dependent peroxidase in Arabidopsis mitochondria, but its role in H2O2 depletion is unknown (21Sweetlove L.J. Heazlewood J.L. Herald V. Holtzapffel R. Day D.A. Leaver C.J. Millar A.H. Plant J. 2002; 32: 891-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). If an Asc-glutathione cycle exists in plant mitochondria two possibilities can be entertained. First, a discrete set of genes encoding mitochondrial-specific components of this pathway could be responsible. Suggestions of mitochondrial-specific isoforms have been made in biochemical studies (12De Leonardis S. Dipierro N. Dipierro S. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2000; 38: 773-779Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 15Jimenez A. Hernandez J.A. Del Rio L.A. Sevilla F. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 16Dalton D.A. Baird L.M. Langeberg L. Taugher C.Y. Anyan W.R. Vance C.P. Sarath G. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 17Iturbe-Ormaetxe I. Matamoros M.A. Rubio M.C. Dalton D.A. Becana M. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 2001; 14: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Second, a series of organelle-targeted genes could exist that are authentically multitargeted to chloroplasts and mitochondria. Evidence has been presented for the dual targeting of pea GR to both mitochondria and chloroplasts (9Creissen G. Reynolds H. Xue Y. Mullineaux P. Plant J. 1995; 8: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and very recently the products of differential transcripts from a single Arabidopsis MDHAR gene have been proposed to be targeted to mitochondria and chloroplasts (7Obara K. Sumi K. Fukuda H. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In this report we have demonstrated the activity of the Asc-glutathione cycle enzymes in purified mitochondria from the model plant Arabidopsis. A combination of a survey of the Arabidopsis genes encoding Asc-glutathione cycle enzymes, analysis of proteomic data in purified mitochondrial preparations, and in vitro import experiments showed dual targeting of APX, MDHAR, and GR gene products to mitochondria and chloroplasts, but only mitochondrial targeting of specific DHAR products. In vivo experiments using GFP chimeric proteins also revealed their mitochondrial subcellular localization. Transcript levels for these genes were induced by oxidative stresses imposed on chloroplasts and/or mitochondria and were elevated during photosynthetic operation in the light. Together these data were used to present a model of an integrated Asc-glutathione antioxidant defense common to chloroplasts and mitochondria that is linked at the level of the genome in Arabidopsis. Plant Materials—Soybean (Glycine max [L] Merr. cv. Stevens) and pea (Pisum sativum [L] Greenfeast) plants were grown in an environmentally controlled incubator at 28°C. The incubator was fitted with artificial lights of 600 μmol–2 s–1 set to a 16-h light and 8-h dark period. Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia (Arabidopsis) were grown at 22 °C under a 16-h light and 8-h dark period on solid Gamborg media. Cloning and Expression Analysis of Genes—Total RNA was isolated from whole Arabidopsis plants and expression analyzed using quantatitive PCR as previously outlined (22Murcha M.W. Lister R. Ho A.Y. Whelan J. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 1737-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The following PCR primers were used to clone the genes: AtAPX-fwd, 5′-ATGGCAGAGCGTGTGTCTC-3′; AtAPX-rev, 5′-TTAGATAACGATACCCTCC-3′; AtMDHAR-fwd, 5′-ATGTCTGCAGTTCGTAGAGTC-3′; AtMDHAR-rev, 5′-CTAACTCTGTAGAGCGGCTTG-3′; AtGR-fwd, 5′-ATGGCTTCGACCCCGAAGC-3′; AtGR-rev, 5′-CTACACCCCAGCAGCTG-3′; AtDHAR(At5g16710)-fwd, 5′-ATGATAAGCCTTAGGTTTCAACC-3′; AtDHAR(At5g16710)-rev, 5′-TTAACCCATAACCTTTGGTCTCC-3′; AtDHAR(At1g19570)-fwd, 5′-ATGGCTCTGGAAATCTGTGTG-3′; AtDHAR(At1g19570)-rev, 5′-TCAAGGGTTAACCTTGGGAGC-3′; AtDHAR(At1g75270)-fwd, 5′-ATGGCTCTAGATATCTGCGTG-3′; AtDHAR(At1g75270)-rev, 5′-TCACGCATTCACCTTCGATTC-3′; AtGDXN-fwd, 5′-ATGGCGGCTTCTTTATCGAGC-3′; AtGDXN-rev, 5′-TCAATCTTGGTTTCCGGAGAC-3′. Primers used for real-time PCR analysis: LC-APX-fwd2, 5′-GCACCAGGAGGACAGTCATG-3′; LC-APX-rev2, 5′-GGGCTACAGCGTAATCCTTG-3′; LC-MDHAR-fwd, 5′-CCGGATTATCTCTTTGGTGTCC-3′; LC-MDHAR-rev, 5′-CATAGCCGACCATCAGCCATTC-3′; LC-GR-fwd, 5′-CTCCATTCTTTCAATTCCTCTG-3′; LC-GR-rev, 5′-GGTACTGGCACAAACAGAAAAC-3′; LC-DHAR-fwd, 5′-GGTTCGACTAAACCGGGAAG-3′; LC-DHAR-rev, 5′-CTGGGACTTTACCTTCTGGAC-3′; LC-GDXN-fwd, 5′-GATTGACGTCTGCATCAGTC-3′; LC-GDXN-rev, 5′-CACTGAGGAGATTCAGGGAC-3′. Purification of Plant Mitochondria and Chloroplasts—Mitochondria were isolated from 7-day-old soybean cotyledons and chloroplasts from 10-day-old pea leaf tissue (23Day D.A. Neuburger M. Douce R. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1985; 12: 219-228Crossref Google Scholar, 24Bruce B.D. Perry S. Froelich J. Keegstra K. Plant Molecular Biology Manual. 2nd edition Ed.

Arabidopsis mitochondria were purified from dark grown cell culture according to Millar et al. (26Millar A.H. Sweetlove L.J. Giege P. Leaver C.J. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1711-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Subfractionation of mitochondria to matrix, inner membrane, and intermembrane space/outer membrane fractions was performed according to Sweetlove et al. (27Sweetlove L.J. Mowday B. Hebestreit H.F. Leaver C.J. Millar A.H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial protein concentrations were determined using the Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce) and the chloroplast chlorophyll concentrations by spectrophotometic measurements. Assay of Asc-glutathione Cycle Enzymes—APX was measured as Asc oxidation by H2O2 at 290 nm (e = 2.8 mm–1 cm–1) in the presence of 0.2 mm Asc and 0.2 mm H2O2 (15Jimenez A. Hernandez J.A. Del Rio L.A. Sevilla F. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). GR was measured as NADPH oxidation at 340 nm in the presence of 0.2 mm NADPH and 0.5 mm oxidized glutathione (14Edwards E.A. Rawsthorne S. Mullineaux P.M. Planta. 1990; 180: 278-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). MDHAR was measured as NADH oxidation at 340 nm of MDHA generated using the Asc/Asc oxidase system using 0.2 mm NADH, 1 mm Asc, and 1 unit of Asc oxidase (Cucurbita enzyme, EC 1.10.3.3, Sigma A0157). DHAR was measured as Asc formation at 265 nm (e = 14 mm–1 cm–1) in argon-flushed solution containing 0.2 mm reduced glutathione and 1 mm DHA (28Dalton D.A. Russell S.A. Hanus F.J. Pascoe G.A. Evans H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3811-3815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For latency measurements, spectrophotometric assays were performed in a solution of 0.3 m mannitol and 25 mm TES (pH 7.5) with or without addition of 0.05% (w/v) Triton X-100. As both KCN and SHAM can inhibit some of these enzymes, alternative respiratory inhibitors (50 μm nPG and 5 μm myxothiazol) were incorporated to prevent electron transport chain NAD(P)H oxidation interfering with spectrophotometric assays of enzymes in the absence of Triton X-100. For assays in subfractions from mitochondria samples, assays were performed in a solution of 0.05% (w/v) Triton and 25 mm TES (pH 7.5). Synthesis and in Vitro Import of Precursor Proteins—Precursor proteins for soybean alternative oxidase (AOX) (29Whelan J. McIntosh L. Day D.A. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), pea small subunit of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (SSU) (30Anderson S. Smith S.M. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), Arabidopsis Tim23 (22Murcha M.W. Lister R. Ho A.Y. Whelan J. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 1737-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), APX, MDHAR, GR, DHAR, and GDXN were synthesized using the TnT® in vitro coupled transcription/translation reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI) in the presence of [35S]methionine. Mutants were created using the QuikChange™ Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and confirmed by sequencing. Import experiments using the dual import system were carried out as previously described (31Rudhe C. Chew O. Whelan J. Glaser E. Plant J. 2002; 30: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Following import into soybean mitochondria, IMS depletion was carried out by resuspending the mitochondria in a hypotonic osmoticum solution (32Lister R. Mowday B. Whelan J. Millar A.H. Plant J. 2002; 30: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Imported products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subsequently exposed to a BAS TR2040 phosphorimaging plate (Fuji, Tokyo). Proteomic Analysis of Mitochondrial Proteins by Mass Spectrometry—Q-TOF MS/MS was performed on an Applied Biosystems Q-STAR Pulsar (Q-TOF MS) using an IonSpray source. Proteins to be analyzed were cut from the two-dimensional PAGE gel, dried at 50 °C in a dry block heater and stored at –70 °C. For the sequencing analysis, the proteins were digested with trypsin, injected in 50% acetonitrile, and doubly charged peptides fragmented by N2 collision and analyzed by MS/MS were selected (27Sweetlove L.J. Mowday B. Hebestreit H.F. Leaver C.J. Millar A.H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Mass spectra and collision MS/MS data were analyzed with BioAnalyst software (Applied Biosystems, Sydney) and Mascot (Matrix Science, London) to identify matching Arabidopsis protein entries. Targeting Prediction Analysis of Arabidopsis Gene Families—Subcellular targeting of predicted protein sequences were performed with MitoProtII (www.mips.biochem.mpg.de/cgi-bin/proj/medgen/mitofilter), TargetP (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP/) as directed by and by Predotar (www.inra.fr/Internet/Produits/Predotar/) as directed on this website. Oxidative Stress Treatments of Arabidopsis—Prior to RNA isolation, 17-day-old Arabidopsis plants were each treated with one of four different chemicals: 0.1 mm Solicam® DF Herbicide (here referred to as norflurazon) (Novartis Crop Protection Australasia Ltd., NSW), 1 mm menadione (Sigma, Castle Hill), 662.5 mg/liter Tryquat 200 (a commercially available herbicide combination of 437.5 mg/L paraquat and 225 mg/liter diquat, here referred to as paraquat) (Crop Care Australasia Pty Ltd., Pinkenba, Australia) and 25 μm antimycin A. Chemicals (or water for control plants) were painted onto Arabidopsis using a paintbrush and leaf tissue was harvested 1 h and 6 h following treatment. Two independent RNA isolations were carried out on harvested leaves using the RNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen, Clifton Hill). Transient Expression of GFP Constructs in Vivo—The expression cassette containing the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter, Arabidopsis ER chitinase signal peptide, m-gfp5 and the nopaline synthase terminator was amplified by PCR using plasmid pBIN m-gfp5-ER as a template and primers CaMV35S 5′ F (5′-CGCAAGCTTCATGGAGTCAAAGATTC-3′) and Nos term 3′-R (5′-CCGATCTAGTAACATAG-3′). The PCR product was cloned into a pGEM®-T cloning vector (Promega, Melbourne), generating construct pGEMGFP. The sequence corresponding to the AOX presequence, full-length TOC64, APX, MDHAR, GR, and GDXN was amplified with appropriate restriction sites by PCR using plasmid DNA as templates and primers listed as follows: AOXp(BamHI)-fwd, 5′-CGTACGGATCCAACAATGATGATGATGATGAGCC-3′; AOXp(EcoRI)-rev, 5′-GTACGAATTCACTCCTCACACCACCGCC-3′; TOC64(BamHI)-fwd, 5′-CGTACGGATCCAACAATGGCGTCTCAAGCTGCG-3′; TOC64(EcoRI)-rev, 5′-GTACGAATTCCTGGAATTTTCTCAGTCTCTC-3′; APΔ M1(BamHI)-fwd, 5′-CGTACGGATCCAACAATGTCTTCTTCTCTCCGATC-3′; APΔ M1(EcoRI)-rev, 5′-GTACGAATTCGATAACGATACCCTCCGG-3′; MDHAR(BamHI)-fwd, 5′-CGTACGGATCCAACAATGTCTGCAGTTCGTAGAG-3′; MDHAR(EcoRI)-rev, 5′-GTACGAATTCACTCTGTAGAGCGGCTTG-3′; GR(BamHI)-fwd, 5′-CGTACGGATCCAACAATGGCTTCGACCCCGAAG-3′; GR(EcoRI)-rev, 5′-GTACGAATTCCACCCCAGCAGCTGTTTTAGC-3′; GDXN(BamHI)-fwd, 5′-CGTACGGATCCAACAATGGCGGCTTCTTTATCG-3′; GDXN-(EcoRI)-rev, 5′-GTACGAATTCATCTTGGTTTCCGGAGAC-3′. The ER signal peptide sequence was removed from the pGEMGFP construct by restriction digestion, PCR products were cloned upstream and in-frame of the m-gfp5 gene and verified by sequencing. Suspension cells developed from soybean (Glycine max cv. Stevens) leaf tissue were grown in 250 ml flasks containing Gamborg media agitated at 130 rpm under approx. 20 μEm–2 s–1 light at 28 °C. The cell stocks were maintained in an exponential growth phase by subculturing (1:6 dilution) at 7-day intervals. For transient expression analysis, 7-day-old soybean suspension cells were aseptically coated onto filter paper (Whatman No. 1 55 mm diameter, Maidstone, England), which was then placed onto solid media containing soybean culture media supplemented with 200 mm mannitol, and incubated for 2 h at 28 °C in the dark. Prior to transformation, 10 μg of the pGEMGFP construct was precipitated onto 5 mg of 1 μm (average diameter) gold particles (Chempur, Karlsruhe, Germany) using 2.5 mm CaCl2 (Sigma, Castle Hill) and 100 mm Spermidine (Sigma, Castle Hill). Bombardment of soybean suspension cells using 0.5 mg of particles was carried out under vacuum using helium pressure of 1400 kPa. The cells were then incubated at 28 °C in the dark overnight before detection of GFP using fluorescence microscopy (Axioskop2, Zeiss, Germany). Asc-glutathione Cycle Enzyme Activities in Arabidopsis Mitochondria: Latency and Subcompartmentalization—Measurement of APX, GR, DHAR, and MDHAR activities revealed that each could be detected in Arabidopsis mitochondria (Table I). The two-Percoll gradient method for the high purity separation of mitochondria from plastid and peroxisomes, yields mitochondria only contaminated 1.5% by plastids, and essentially free from peroxisomal and cytosolic compartments, based on marker enzymes (26Millar A.H. Sweetlove L.J. Giege P. Leaver C.J. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1711-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Maximal activities for each enzyme of the Asc-glutathione cycle measured in the presence of 0.05% Triton X-100 (Table 1A) were 2–5-fold lower than those reported in mitochondrial preparations from other plant species (15Jimenez A. Hernandez J.A. Del Rio L.A. Sevilla F. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 17Iturbe-Ormaetxe I. Matamoros M.A. Rubio M.C. Dalton D.A. Becana M. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 2001; 14: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), but were clearly measurable above background levels of auto-oxidation. The latency of these activities suggested that GR and MDHAR activities were largely inaccessible in intact mitochondria, indicating a matrix location. In contrast more than half the APX and DHAR activities could be assayed by provision of substrates to intact mitochondria, indicating a significant portion of activity is probably on the intermembrane space side of the mitochondrial inner membrane (Table 1A). Under the same conditions, cytochrome c oxidase latency was in excess of 95%, proving a high degree of membrane integrity in our mitochondrial preparations. To further assess compartmentation of these activities, fractions enriched in matrix proteins (MA), intermembrane space and outer membrane vesicle proteins (IMS + OM) and inner membrane proteins (IM) were prepared by osmotic stock and centrifugation. Contamination between compartments prepared by this protocol are <5% for the MA and IM samples, and about 25% MA and <5% IM in the IMS + OM fraction (27Sweetlove L.J. Mowday B. Hebestreit H.F. Leaver C.J. Millar A.H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 32Lister R. Mowday B. Whelan J. Millar A.H.

The IMS + OM fraction represented 10%, the matrix sample 40% and the membrane fraction 50% of total mitochondrial protein. Based on these proportions, the distribution of activity between the fractions is presented as a percentage of total activity in mitochondria (Table 1B). By comparing the combined activities rate (Table 1B) with the +Triton solubilization data (Table 1A), the percentage activity recovery (70–110%) during this subfractionation process was determined to be consistent. Nearly 90% of the APX and MDHAR activities were present in the inner membrane fraction, with about 10% in the matrix fraction. The low latency of APX (Table 1A) coupled to the subfractionation data for this enzyme (Table 1B) suggests that much of this activity is likely to be on the IMS side of the inner membrane. In contrast, the high latency of MDHAR (Table 1A) coupled to subfractionation data (Table 1B) suggests a predominantly matrix side localization. The GR and DHAR activities predominate in the matrix, but are also found in the other fractions, suggesting they are partitioned between compartments and can be partially membrane associated. These data are consistent with the view that the majority of the APX faces the outside of the inner membrane, while an Asc-glutathione generating system (MDHAR, DHAR, GR) operates in the matrix and to a lesser extent in the IMS to regenerate Asc.Table IAsc-glutathione enzyme activities in Arabidopsis mitochondriaAIntact+TritonLatencynmol min-1 mg-1 protein%APX81 ± 5110 ± 1326MDHAR28 ± 6117 ± 2276DHAR33 ± 463 ± 1148GR2 ± 110 ± 280COX17 ± 4520 ± 8897Fraction activitiesBIMS + OMMAIMCombinedRecovery% combinednmol-1 min-1 mg-1 protein%APX1108978 ± 971MDHAR31087125 ± 31107DHAR15553048 ±"

Biological features of another isozyme SPHK2, however, remain unclear. The present studies were undertaken to characterize SPHK2 by comparison with SPHK1. When SPHK2 was transiently expressed in various cell lines, it was localized in the nuclei as well as in the cytosol, whereas SPHK1 was distributed in the cytosol but not in the nucleus. We have mapped a functional nuclear localization signal (NLS) to the N-terminal region of SPHK2. We have observed that the expression of SPHK2 in various cell types causes inhibition of DNA synthesis, resulting in the cell cycle arrest at G1/S phase. We have also demonstrated that an NLS mutant of SPHK2, SPHK2R93E/R94E, failed to enter the nucleus and to inhibit DNA synthesis. Moreover, a fusion protein, NLS-SPHK1, where SPHK1 was fused to the NLS sequence of SPHK2 acquired the ability to enter nuclei and inhibited DNA synthesis. These results indicate that SPHK2 localizes in the nuclei and causes inhibition of DNA synthesis, and this may affect subsequent cellular events.

Sphingosine kinase (SPHK), the enzyme that catalyzes the phosphorylation of sphingosine, regulates the intracellular levels of SPP. Two isoforms of mammalian SPHK (SPHK1 and SPHK2) have been cloned and characterized (7Kohama T. Olivera A. Edsall L. Nagiec M.M. Dickson R. Spiegel S. J. Biol.

SPHK1 predominantly localizes in the cytosol, and its overexpression induces cell proliferation by promoting the G1 to S transition of the cell cycle as well as by inhibiting the apoptotic response to serum deprivation or ceramide treatment (9Olivera A. Kohama T. Edsall L. Nava V. Cuvillier O. Poulton S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 545-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Several cellular proteins have recently been identified as SPHK1-interacting molecules, namely TRAF2 (10Xia P. Wang L. Moretti P.A. Albanese N. Chai F. Pitson S.M. D'Andrea R.J. Gamble J.R.

In contrast to SPHK1, little is known about the cellular actions of the other isozyme, SPHK2. In the present studies, we investigated the biological features of SPHK2. We have discovered that SPHK2 localizes in the nuclei of cells through its novel nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence, depending on cell type and cell density. We have also demonstrated that nuclear localization of SPHK2 causes inhibition of DNA synthesis in various cell types. Plasmid Construction and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The mSPHK1 and mSPHK2 cDNAs (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank™ accession number AF068748 and AF245448, respectively) were amplified from a mouse brain and a mouse kidney cDNA library, respectively, by PCR using ExTaq polymerase (Takara, Otsu, Japan). The full-length mSPHK2 or mSPHK1 cDNA was subcloned into a mammalian expression vector pCMV5 with an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag to express N-terminally HA-tagged fusion proteins. In some experiments, mSPHK1, mSPHK2, or their HA-fused constructs were also cloned into the expression vector pTB-701, in which the green fluorescent protein (GFP) sequence had been subcloned into an EcoRI site for C-terminally GFP-fused protein expression. The human SPHK2 (GenBank™ accession number NM-020126) cDNA was amplified from a human liver cDNA library by PCR using KOD-PLUS polymerase (Toyobo, Tokyo) with 5′-GGA TCC GTA CCC TGG TCA GGG CTA AG-3′ and 5′-GGA TCC CTC AGG GCT CCC GCC C-3′ sense and antisense primers, respectively. The PCR product was subcloned into pCMV5. The oligonucleotide primers used to synthesize truncated SPHK2 constructs were designed using pTB-701-HA-mSPHK2-GFP as a template, and the amino acid numbering was based on the mSPHK2 sequence as reported by Liu et al. (8Liu H. Sugiura M. Nava V.E. Edsall L.C. Kono K. Poulton S. Milstien S. Kohama T. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19513-19520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). To obtain middle portion truncation mutant (Δ353–478, mSPHK2ΔM), N-terminal fragment (residues 1–352) and C-terminal fragment (residues 479–617) cDNAs were obtained first by PCR amplification. For the N-terminal fragment, the primers used were 5′-GAG GAA TTC GCC ACC ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCT ATG GCC CCA CCA CCA CTA C-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGA GGT ACC CAA GGC TGG TTC TGT GGT AG-3′ (antisense). For the C-terminal fragment, the primers used were 5′-AGA GGT ACC CCA GTG GAC CAC CTC CTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTC GAA TTC GGC TTG TGG CTT TTG ACC TGC-3′ (antisense). These products were then ligated at a KpnI site and subcloned into an EcoRI site in pTB-701. N-terminal truncation mutant (Δ1–136; mSPHK2ΔN) expression vector was generated by PCR amplification using 5′-ACC GAA TTC GCC ACC ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCT GAA ATC ACC CCT GAA TTG CTG-3′ and 5′-AGA GGT ACC CAA GGC TGG TTC TGT GGT AG-3′ sense and antisense primers, respectively. NLS-mSPHK1 expression vector was prepared by PCR amplification using pTB-701-HA-mSPHK1-GFP as a template with sense primer 5′-GCA AGA TCT CGT GGC CGT CGA GGG GGC CGG CGC AGA GCT ACG CGG ATG GAA CCA GAA TGC-3′, which contains the putative NLS region (residues 87–98) of SPHK2 and antisense primer 5′-GCA AGA TCT CGT CGA GGG GGC CG-3′. Site-directed mutagenesis for mSPHK2R93E/R94E was performed using mutagenic synthetic oligonucleotides (5′-GC CGT CGA GGG GGC GAG GAG AGA GCT ACG CGG ACC-3′ and its reverse complement) and pTB-701-HA-mSPHK2-GFP as a template with a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All of the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The HA-mSPHK2-GFP cDNA was also subcloned into pUHG10-3 plasmid for the secondary stable transfection. The HeLa Tet-On cells (Clontech) were co-transfected with the plasmids pUHG10-3-HA-mSPHK2-GFP and pSV2bsr (Kaken Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo). Drugresistant clones were isolated in the presence of 2.5 μg/ml blastocidin. From the blastocidin-resistant clones, the cells harboring the pUHG10–3-HA-mSPHK2-GFP were selected on the basis of the highest inducibility of HA-mSPHK2-GFP expression in the presence of 100 ng/ml doxycycline (Dox). Immunocytochemistry—Cells were grown on four-chambered slides (Nalge/Nunc) and transfected using Fugene-6 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Subcellular localization studies using confocal microscopy were performed as described previously (11Hayashi S. Okada T. Igarashi N. Fujita T. Jahangeer S. Nakamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33319-33324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A rabbit polyclonal anti-hSPHK2 antibody was raised against the synthetic peptide SQALHIQRLRPKPEARPR (amino acid residues 35–52) conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The antibody was further purified by the immunogen peptide-immobilized Sepharose 4B. Isolation of Nuclei—The separation of nuclei from cells was carried out essentially as described (13Bunce C.M. Thick J.A. Lord J.M. Mills D. Brown G. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 175: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), with some modifications (14Kleuser B. Maceyka M. Milstien S. Spiegel S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 503: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For the preparation of cytosolic fraction, the supernatant fractions above the sucrose cushion obtained after 15,000 × g step were further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The resultant nuclear and cytosolic fractions were assayed for enzymatic activity. For immunoprecipitation studies, nuclear fractions were obtained as described (15Chauveau J. Moulé Y. Rouiller C. Exp. Cell Res. 1956; 11: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Measurement of in Vitro SPHK Activity—SPHK activity was determined in the presence of sphingosine, prepared as a complex with 4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and [γ-32P]ATP in kinase buffer containing 200 mm KCl as described previously (8Liu H. Sugiura M. Nava V.E. Edsall L.C. Kono K. Poulton S. Milstien S. Kohama T. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19513-19520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) using either cell extracts or purified nuclear fractions as an enzyme source. In Fig. 2, the nuclear fractions were purified from HeLa cells grown in 10-cm dishes as described in Ref. 15Chauveau J. Moulé Y. Rouiller C. Exp. Cell Res. 1956; 11: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar and were lysed by sonication in cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 130 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)). The nuclear lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 15 min at 10,000 × g and incubated for 1 h with anti-hSPHK2 antibody (9 μg). The immunoprecipitates were collected by protein A/G Plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and then washed three times with the lysis buffer and used as an enzyme source. [32P]SPP was separated by thin layer chromatography and quantitated using a Fujix Bio-Imaging Analyzer BAS 2000 (Fuji Photo Film). Measurement of DNA Synthesis—Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation was measured using BrdUrd labeling and detection kit I (Roche Applied Science). Briefly, NIH 3T3 cells grown on chambered slides were transiently transfected with either the GFP control plasmid or various plasmid constructs as indicated in Fig. 5 legend. Two days after transfection, cells were incubated for 3 h with 10 μm BrdUrd and then fixed in 70% ethanol containing 50 mm glycine (pH 2.0) for 20 min at –20 °C. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with mouse monoclonal anti-BrdUrd and rat monoclonal anti-HA antibodies. After washing with the washing buffer, cells were incubated for 1 h with Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Five random fields from each sample were analyzed with a confocal microscope. The percentage of transfected cells (green HA fluorescence) incorporating BrdUrd (red nuclei) was calculated as an average of four sample slides with a minimum of 100 cells scored per field. For [3H]thymidine incorporation studies, HeLa cells stably expressing SPHK2 were seeded in six-well plates at a density of 104 cells/well in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS with various concentrations of Dox as specified in the figure legends. After 24 h, the serum in the medium was reduced from 10 to 0.5%, while Dox concentrations were maintained. Medium containing 0.5% FCS plus various concentrations of Dox was changed every day. After 8 days, cells were pulsed with 1 μCi/well of [methyl-1,2-3H]thymidine (Amersham Biosciences) for 16 h, and the radioactivity incorporated into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material was measured as previously described (16Olivera A. Spiegel S. Nature. 1993; 365: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Values are the means ± S.D. of triplicate determinations. Flow Cytometric Evaluations—NIH 3T3 cells were synchronized by a double thymidine block at the beginning of the S phase and released into thymidine-free medium (17Krek W. DeCaprio J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 114-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells in 60-mm dishes were first transfected with SPHK2-GFP or control GFP plasmid vectors (3 μg each) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FCS and 2.5 mm thymidine for 19 h. Cells were washed twice with PBS and maintained further in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FCS for 10 h. Cells were treated again with 2.5 mm thymidine for 17 h. Cells were washed twice with PBS and used for cell cycle analysis. At various time intervals after incubation of cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FCS, cells were collected by trypsinization, washed once with PBS, and resuspended in PBS containing 0.75% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were washed with PBS, resuspended in ice-cold 70% ethanol in PBS, and incubated for 10 min. The cells were washed once with PBS and resuspended in PBS containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) and 125 units/ml ribonuclease A and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Flow cytometric analysis for GFP and PI fluorescence was performed using a four-color FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Electronic compensation was used among the fluorescence channels to remove residual spectral overlap. GFP and PI fluorescence data were collected on a logarithmic and a linear scale, respectively. For each sample, 40,000 events were collected. Analyses of the multivariate data and DNA histograms were performed with CELLQuest and ModFitLT softwares, respectively (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME) that are part of the FACSCalibur operating system. Other Procedures—Lactate dehydrogenase activity was measured according to the supplier's protocol (Kyokuto Chemicals, Tokyo). Protein was determined by the method of Bradford (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar). SPHK2 Is Predominantly Localized in the Nucleus—During immunocytochemical analyses of SPHK2, we observed that SPHK2 was predominantly localized in the nuclei of various cell types. When mouse SPHK2 was fused with GFP and transiently expressed in COS7 cells, mSPHK2-GFP was mainly localized in the nuclei and to a lesser extent in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A). Nuclear localization of SPHK2 was also observed when it was transiently expressed in HeLa cells (Fig. 1B) and NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 1C). To exclude the possibility that GFP fusion itself had caused SPHK2 to mislocalize into the nuclei and to show that the nuclear localization of SPHK2 is a general characteristic independent of species differences, human SPHK2 (without any added tag sequence) was transiently expressed in HeLa cells, and its intracellular distribution was examined using a specific antibody raised against a peptide sequence common to both human and mouse SPHK2. Similar to mSPHK2, hSPHK2 was mainly localized in the nuclei with some cytoplasmic staining in these cells (Fig. 1D). The nuclear localization of hSPHK2 was confirmed by the nucleus-specific 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining of HeLa cells (Fig. 1E) and the colocalization of DAPI with hSPHK2 staining (Fig. 1F). Next, the other SPHK isozyme, SPHK1, was fused with GFP, and its intracellular distribution was compared with SPHK2. In COS7 cells, mSPHK1-GFP was localized mainly in the cytoplasm but not in the nucleus (Fig. 1H), an observation that is consistent with a previous report (9Olivera A. Kohama T. Edsall L. Nava V. Cuvillier O. Poulton S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 545-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). It is important to test whether the nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution of SPHK2 may change depending on cell type and cell confluence. When hSPHK2 was transiently expressed in HeLa cells, it was predominantly localized in the nuclei under all tested conditions (Table I). In the case of COS7 cells, the intracellular distribution of hSPHK2 was dramatically influenced by cell density; nuclear localization was prominent (61.4%) particularly in high cell density cultures, whereas it was only 10.3% in low cell density cultures. In contrast, hSPHK2 was predominantly localized in the cytosol irrespective of cell density in HEK293 (Table I).Table ICell density-dependent and -independent changes in nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution of SPHK2 in various cell typesCell types and densityCell populations expressing SPHK2N > CN = CN < C%%%HeLa cells (high confluence)88.7 ± 1.910.0 ± 1.31.3 ± 0.6HeLa cells (low confluence)82.9 ± 2.012.2 ± 0.64.9 ± 2.5COS7 cells (high confluence)61.4 ± 2.224.5 ± 2.814.1 ± 3.0COS7 cells (low confluence)10.3 ± 1.817.1 ± 1.372.7 ± 1.3HEK293 cells (high confluence)7.5 ± 1.19.6 ± 1.282.6 ± 2.0HEK293 cells (low confluence)4.6 ± 1.59.2 ± 2.586.2 ± 3.8 Open table in a new tab Next, we tried to determine whether endogenous SPHK2 was also localized in the nucleus similar to exogenously expressed recombinant SPHK2. To address this issue, endogenous SPHK2 from purified nuclear extracts of HeLa cells was immunoprecipitated using anti-hSPHK2 antibody and analyzed for its activity. The immunoprecipitates showed clear SPP production, whereas the immunoprecipitates prepared in the presence of the immunogen peptide contained no detectable radioactivity corresponding to SPP, suggesting that the purified nuclear fractions contained SPHK activity that bound specifically to the antibody (Fig. 2A). The aliquots of the immunoprecipitates prepared in the absence of the immunogen peptide were further analyzed by immunoblot using anti-hSPHK2 antibody (Fig. 2B). The immunoprecipitates from nuclear fractions revealed a clear band around 70 kDa, which corresponded to the position of affinity-purified recombinant HA-hSPHK2. The immunoreactive band around 70 kDa sometimes appeared as a doublet, suggesting the existence of post-translational modification of the protein. The anti-hSPHK2 antibody did not cross-react with HA-SPHK1. When the immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with anti-SPHK1 antibody, there was no immunoreactive band either around authentic HA-SPHK1 or HA-SPHK2. These results strongly suggest that the anti-hSPHK2 antibody specifically recognizes endogenous SPHK2 but not SPHK1 and that the purified nuclear fractions contain endogenous SPHK2. This conclusion was further confirmed by immunocytochemical analyses. After fixation and staining of HeLa cells with anti-hSPHK2 antibody, endogenous SPHK2 was found to be distributed mainly in the nucleus and to a lesser extent in the cytosol (Fig. 2C), which is consistent with the findings observed using a recombinant overexpressed system (Fig. 1 and Table I). NLS Is Localized in the N-terminal Portion of SPHK2— mSPHK2 encodes a protein, which is larger than mSPHK1 and contains an additional 236 amino acids (8Liu H. Sugiura M. Nava V.E. Edsall L.C. Kono K. Poulton S. Milstien S. Kohama T. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19513-19520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Compared with SPHK1, SPHK2 contains two largely unrelated sequences, one at the amino terminus and the other in the middle of the protein (Fig. 3A). It may not be unreasonable to assume that the differences in the intracellular distribution between mSPHK1 and mSPHK2 are attributable to these additional unrelated sequences, which exist only in mSPHK2. To test this possibility, we constructed two deletion mutants: mSPHK2ΔM, which lacks the middle portion of the unrelated sequence, and mSPHK2ΔN, which lacks the amino-terminal portion of the protein (Fig. 3A). When mSPHK2ΔM-GFP was transiently expressed in COS7 cells, the protein was localized mainly in the nuclei showing that the middle portion of SPHK2 had no influence on the nuclear localization of this protein (Fig. 1J). On the other hand, mSPHK2ΔN-GFP could not enter the nuclei when it was expressed in COS7 cells (Fig. 1K). These results strongly suggest that an NLS sequence resides within the amino terminus of mSPHK2. Identification of the NLS Sequence of SPHK2—Although the sequence of mSPHK2 has been analyzed for its domain structure, so far no one has reported the presence of an NLS identical to the previously known NLS sequences. However, our analyses showed that SPHK2 possesses a putative NLS (RGRRGGRRR) with an arginine cluster, which is highly similar to a type of monopartite NLS enriched in arginine residues identified in the Tat and Rev proteins of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (19Truant R. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 1210-1217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the Rex protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (20Palmeri D. Malim M.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 1218-1225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the atypical protein kinase C λ (21Perander M. Bjorkoy G. Johansen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13015-13024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B). To demonstrate that this putative NLS functions as a true NLS in the cells, another mutant mSPHK2R93E/R94E-GFP, where both Arg-93 and Arg-94 of mSPHK2-GFP were mutated to glutamic acid, was constructed and analyzed. A similar mutation in the NLS sequence of protein kinase Cλ has been reported to abolish the nuclear accumulation of protein kinase Cλ (21Perander M. Bjorkoy G. Johansen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13015-13024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). When mSPHK2R93E/R94E-GFP was transiently expressed in COS7 cells, the mutant protein could not enter the nuclei (Fig. 1L), indicating that these arginine residues were critical for the functioning of this NLS. To show that this tentative NLS sequence of SPHK2 functions as a true NLS, this sequence was fused with a cytoplasmic protein, SPHK1, and its nuclear targeting efficiency was analyzed. When NLS-mSPHK1-GFP was transiently expressed in COS7 cells, the protein accumulated mainly in the nuclei (Fig. 1M). These observations indicate that the NLS sequence of mSPHK2 was necessary and sufficient to direct a complete nuclear import of SPHK2. SPHK2 Causes Inhibition of DNA Synthesis—Nuclear localization of SPHK2 as observed in Figs. 1 and 2 raised the possibility that this enzyme may be involved in some nuclear function. We next analyzed DNA synthesis as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation into cells stably expressing SPHK2. For these experiments, HA-mSPHK2-GFP was stably expressed in HeLa Tet-On cells in a Dox-inducible manner. The cells expressing SPHK2 (induced by 0.1 μg/ml Dox) showed a 50% inhibition in [3H]thymidine incorporation compared with the cells expressing no exogenous SPHK2 under Dox-deficient conditions (Fig. 4A). Dox-inducible expression of SPHK2 was confirmed by immunoblot analyses using anti-HA antibody as shown in Fig. 4B. In the cells carrying empty vector, Dox at the concentrations used here had no significant effect on thymidine incorporation (data not shown). Nuclear Localization Is Necessary for SPHK2 to Inhibit DNA Synthesis—The mechanism of the inhibition of DNA synthesis by SPHK2 was further assessed by measuring BrdUrd incorporation into nascent DNA in NIH 3T3 cells transiently expressing various constructs of SPHK and its mutants. When HA-mSPHK2-GFP was expressed in NIH 3T3 cells, BrdUrd incorporation was strongly inhibited as compared with the cells transfected with a control vector (Fig. 5). In contrast, cells expressing HA-mSPHK1 showed a 40% increase in BrdUrd incorporation, in agreement with a previous report (9Olivera A. Kohama T. Edsall L. Nava V. Cuvillier O. Poulton S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 545-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). It is important to determine whether the nuclear localization of SPHK2 is required for the inhibition of DNA synthesis. The next experiments were designed to show the importance of nuclear localization of SPHK2 for inhibition of DNA synthesis by manipulating the ability of nuclear localization of SPHK2. Upon transient transfection in NIH 3T3 cells, the NLS mutant, HA-mSPHK2R93E/R94E, which failed to enter the nucleus (Fig. 1L), lost its ability to inhibit DNA synthesis (Fig. 5). More importantly, when mSPHK1 acquired nuclear localization ability upon fusion with the NLS sequence from mSPHK2, it showed inhibitory effects on DNA synthesis, suggesting that nuclear localization, and not the other features of SPHK2, is important for the inhibition of DNA synthesis. When hSPHK2 without any added tag sequences was transiently expressed in HeLa cells, essentially the same inhibitory effect on BrdUrd uptake was observed (data not shown). Next, we have checked the protein expression and enzymatic activity of various SPHK constructs. As shown in Fig. 6A, vector-transfected COS7 cells have low levels of SPHK activity. In cells transfected with HA-mSPHK1, NLS-HA-mSPHK1, or hSPHK2, in vitro SPHK activity was increased by 63-, 53-, and 52-fold, respectively. We have further demonstrated the in vitro accumulation of SPP in the nucleus using purified intact nuclear fractions. HeLa cells transiently expressing various SPHK proteins were disrupted, and the nuclei were isolated through high sucrose solution (13Bunce C.M. Thick J.A. Lord J.M. Mills D. Brown G. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 175: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In cells expressing hSPHK2, SPP accumulated mostly in the nuclear fractions (75%) (Fig. 6B), which supports the results obtained from the morphological determinations (Table I). On the other hand, SPP accumulated mainly in the cytosol of cells expressing HA-mSPHK1, consistent with a previous report (9Olivera A. Kohama T. Edsall L. Nava V. Cuvillier O. Poulton S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 545-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). NLS-HA-mSPHK1 showed a clear shift in nuclear accumulation of SPP, confirming the results from the confocal microscopic analyses (Fig. 1M). In all nuclear preparations, lactate dehydrogenase, a typical cytosolic marker protein, was almost undetectable, whereas the typical nuclear membrane marker nucleoporin was detected exclusively in the nuclear fractions, validating the reliability of the cell fractionation technique. SPHK2 Expression Causes Cell Cycle Arrest at G1/S Phase— Next, the effect of SPHK2 on cell cycle was studied. NIH 3T3 cells transiently transfected with mSPHK2-GFP were synchronized to the beginning of the S phase by a double thymidine block, and the DNA content of cells expressing the SPHK2 protein was analyzed by flow cytometry. About 100% of the nonexpressing and SPHK2-expressing cells had not entered G2/M phase at 0 h as a result of double thymidine block-induced synchronization of the cell cycle (Fig. 7B). Upon release from the thymidine block, the percentage of cells in various phases of the cell cycle remains very different in the two populations. In the SPHK2-nonexpressing cells, a majority of cells entered the S phase after 3 h, and the bulk of the cells left the S phase and entered the G2/M phase by 9 h (Fig. 7B). In contrast, the SPHK2-expressing cells lagged in their progression through the cell cycle and persisted in the G1 phase much longer, showing a typical G1/S arrest, such that at the 9-h time point when nearly 40% of the nonexpressing cells were in the G2/M, only a very modest 7% of the SPHK2-expressing cells were in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. NIH 3T3 cells expressing GFP alone showed a pattern essentially similar to the nonexpressing cells as in Fig. 7B (data not shown). This G1/S arrest eventually did not lead to apoptosis as judged by the occurrence of cells in the sub-G1 region (hypodiploidy) in cell cycle analysis. The results from flow cytometric analyses strongly suggest that SPHK2 causes inhibition of DNA synthesis through cell cycle arrest at G1/S phase. This is the first report to show that SPHK2 is predominantly localized in the nuclei (Figs. 1 and 2), depending on the cell type and cell confluence (Table I). The present results as summarized in Table I are also consistent with a previous report that SPHK2 transiently transfected in HEK293 cells mainly localizes in the cytosol (8Liu H. Sugiura M. Nava V.E. Edsall L.C. Kono K. Poulton S. Milstien S. Kohama T. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19513-19520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). However, in HeLa cells, hSPHK2 is almost exclusively in the nucleus, and in COS7 cells it is dominantly nuclear in high cell density cultures. Whether SPHK2 is involved in contact inhibition of proliferation in COS7 cells is an attractive possibility that needs to be explored carefully. Molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of SPHK2 are at present unknown and need to be studied using various model cell systems. Recently, Kleuser et al. (14Kleuser B. Maceyka M. Milstien S. Spiegel S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 503: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) have reported that platelet-derived growth factor stimulates nuclear SPHK activity in Swiss3T3 cells. They have suggested that SPHK1 translocates from the cytosol to the nuclear envelope upon stimulation of cells by platelet-derived growth factor. However, the present data demonstrate that it is SPHK2, which is localized mainly in the nucleoplasm and not in the nuclear envelope (Fig. 1). We have also demonstrated that nuclear localization of SPHK2 causes inhibition of the DNA synthesis (Figs. 4 and 5). That this observation is not an artifactual effect caused by overexpressing exogenously introduced genes but represents an intrinsic feature of SPHK2 is supported by several arguments. First, the inhibition of DNA synthesis is specific to SPHK2 expression but not to a control, empty vector or SPHK1 overexpression (Fig. 5). Second, the inhibitory effect of SPHK2 expression on DNA synthesis was cancelled by introducing the NLS mutant (Fig. 5), although the levels of expression of the wild type SPHK2 and the mutant SPHK2R93E/R94E were similar (Fig. 1, compare A and L). Third, SPHK1 acquired the ability to inhibit DNA synthesis when the NLS sequence of SPHK2 was fused to this isozyme (Fig. 5). Finally, expression of even a small amount of SPHK2, as manipulated by varying doxycycline concentrations in HeLa Tet-on cells stably transfected with SPHK2, showed similar nuclear localization and inhibitory effects on DNA synthesis (Fig. 4). The inhibitory effect of SPHK2 on DNA synthesis is not due to the inactivation of the enzyme in the nuclei, because SPHK2 and NLS-SPHK1 in purified nuclei were just as active as cytosolic enzymes as judged by their specific activity (Fig. 6 and data not shown). So far, SPHK1 has been implicated both in cell proliferation and antiapoptotic processes (1Le Stunff H. Peterson C. Liu H. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 8-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 2Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 9Olivera A. Kohama T. Edsall L. Nava V. Cuvillier O. Poulton S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 545-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). In the present studies, we have confirmed that SPHK1 mainly localizes in the cytosol and not in the nucleus (Fig. 1H) and that the enzyme stimulates DNA synthesis (Fig. 5). On the other hand, we have also demonstrated that SPHK2 mainly localizes in the nuclei of several cells tested (Fig. 1) and that its nuclear localization corresponds to the inhibition of DNA synthesis (Figs. 4 and 5). It is interesting to speculate that cell proliferation or cessation of the proliferation process may be controlled by the balance of SPP content between cytosol and nucleus as well as the cellular balance between ceramide plus sphingosine versus SPP level as explained by the so-called “rheostat” model (1Le Stunff H. Peterson C. Liu H. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 8-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 2Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Thus, the binding proteins for SPP in the cytosol and the nucleus may determine the fate of cells. Identification of the binding protein(s) for SPP is an urgent subject that needs to be studied for a proper understanding of the molecular mechanism of proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.

Interaction of S1P with these receptors regulates a multitude of effects in the vascular system, including endothelial cell proliferation, survival, adherens junction assembly, migration, and morphogenesis (6Hla T.

Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar). In particular, activation of S1P1 and S1P3 receptors plays an important role in survival and morphogenesis in endothelial cells in vitro (8Lee M.J. Thangada S. Claffey K.P. Ancellin N. Liu C.H.

S1P is generated by the metabolism of sphingomyelin, an abundant component of biological membranes. Specifically, sphingomyelinase degrades sphingomyelin to ceramide, which is degraded by a ceramidase to sphingosine, the substrate for sphingosine kinase (SK) (11Spiegel S. Merrill Jr., A.H.

Most cells exhibit a basal tone of SK activity that is further increased by different extracellular stimuli, such as growth factors, cytokines, and hormones.

Such cellular activation brings about an increase in the intracellular levels of S1P. Similarly, cell activation has also been shown to activate the upstream enzymes of S1P synthesis, namely, ceramidase (21Coroneos E. Martinez M. McKenna S. Kester M. J. Biol.

These studies suggest that agonist-induced formation of S1P may serve a regulatory role in cellular signaling. The central enzyme in the pathway, SK, is encoded by two SK genes encoding SK1 and SK2 isoenzymes (25Liu H. Chakravarty D. Maceyka M. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 71: 493-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the physiological role of each of these kinases remains to be elucidated. Platelets, which exhibit high SK activity and lack the S1P lyase, are a rich source of S1P in vivo (26Yatomi Y. Ruan F. Hakomori S. Igarashi Y. Blood. 1995; 86: 193-202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Platelets contain stored S1P (27Yatomi Y. Yamamura S. Ruan F. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5291-5297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and release it upon activation, thus contributing to serum S1P levels. Moreover, neutrophils, erythrocytes, endothelial cells, and mononuclear cells also release S1P (28Yang L. Yatomi Y. Miura Y. Satoh K. Ozaki Y. Br. J. Haematol. 1999; 107: 282-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 29Ancellin N. Colmont C. Su J. Li Q. Mittereder N. Chae S.S. Stefansson S. Liau G. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6667-6675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms whereby S1P is released are poorly understood. Studies from our laboratory recently showed that endothelial cells actively export the SK1 enzyme into the extracellular milieu, which could explain some of the biological actions of S1P (29Ancellin N.

Thus, intracellular and extracellular S1P-generating systems exist and contribute to circulating S1P levels. A novel pharmacologic modulator of S1P receptors has been described, namely, the immunomodulatory agent, FTY720 (30Mandala S. Hajdu R. Bergstrom J. Quackenbush E. Xie J. Milligan J. Thornton R.

FTY720 elicits lymphopenia in blood and thoracic duct by sequestration of lymphocytes from circulation to secondary lymphoid organs, away from inflamed peripheral tissues and graft sites. FTY720 is phosphorylated in vivo, and the phosphorylated form (FTY720-P) is a potent agonist of S1P1, S1P3, S1P4, and S1P5 receptors (30Mandala S. Hajdu R. Bergstrom J. Quackenbush E. Xie J.

These important findings provide a critical clue for the mechanism of action of this potent immunomodulatory agent. However, the cellular and molecular basis of FTY720 action remains to be elucidated. The vascular system contributes greatly to the innate as well as adaptive immunity and in fact plays a critical role in transplant-associated tissue rejection (32Biedermann B.C. Sahner S. Gregor M.

Phospho-Akt, Akt, phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), and ERK-1/2 antibodies were from Cell Signaling Tech., and VE-cadherin and β-catenin antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Cloning of SK1 and SK2—Mouse liver RNA (Ambion) was used to amplify the murine SK1 and SK2 cDNA by reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR with the forward primers 5′-AGC CCC ATG TGG TGG TGT TGT-3′ and 5′-ATT ATG GCC CCA CCA CCA CTA CT-3′, respectively and reverse primers 5′-GGC ACA GAG TTA TGG TTC TTC-3′ and 5′-AGG TCA GGC TTG TGG CTT TTG AC-3′, respectively. The resulting PCR product was cloned in pcDNA3.1 Topo vector (Invitrogen), and the DNA sequence was confirmed. SK1 and SK2 cDNAs were then cloned in pcDNA3.1 eukaryotic expression vector (Invitrogen). Full-length cDNA clones for human SK1 (IMAGE_ID 3831657; BC008040) and SK2(IMAGE_ID; BC006161) were procured from Protein Tech Group, Chicago, IL. The SK1 and SK2 inserts were released by EcoRI and XhoI digestion, and the resulting 1.8- and 3.0-kbp fragments, corresponding to SK1 and SK2, were subcloned into pcDNA 3.0 mammalian expression vector at EcoR1 and XhoI sites. Reverse Transcription and Real Time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cells using the RNA-Stat 60 reagent (Tel Test). 1 μg of total RNA was treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega, Madison, WI) and reverse-transcribed using random hexamer primers (Invitrogen) and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacture's instructions. Primers were designed using Primer Express™ 2.0 (Applied Biosystems) according to the software guidelines. All primer pairs were designed for a melting temperature of 60 °C. Primer sequences were as follows: human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase forward (5′-TGC ACC ACC AAC TGC TTA GC-3′) and reverse (5′-GGC ATG GAC TGT GGT CAT GAG-3′), human SK1 forward (5′-CATCCAGAAGCCCCTGTGTAG-3′) and reverse (5′-GTC TTC ATT GGT GAC CTG CTC AT-3′), human SK2 forward (5′-CAA CCT CAT CCA GAC AGA ACG A-3′) and reverse (5′-TTC ACA GCT TCC TCC CAG TCA-3′), mouse SK1 forward (5′-GGA GGA GGC AGA GAT AAC CTT TAA A-3′) and reverse (5′-GAC CCA ACT CCT CTG CAC ACA-3′), mouse SK2 forward (5′-GTG GTG CCA ATG ATC TCT GAA G-3′) and reverse (5′-GCTCACGGGCATGGTTCT-3′). Real time PCR was performed using QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen) on an ABI Prism 7900 HT Sequence Detection System (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Each reaction was run in duplicate and contained 5 μl of cDNA, 900 nm primers and 12.5 μl of SYBR Green PCR master mix in a 25-μl final volume. The parameters for PCR were 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min for 40 cycles and a final dissociation stage of 95 °C for 15 s. Melting curves were performed using the SDS2.1 software (Applied Biosystems) to ensure that only a single product of the correct melting temperature was amplified. Quantification of RNA levels was calculated as previously described (33Liu W. Saint D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) (Clonetics, p4–11) were cultured in M199 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and heparin-stabilized endothelial cell growth factor, as previously described (34Hla T. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9308-9313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney 293T cells in 60-mm dishes were transfected with 4 μg of vector alone or with vectors containing SK constructs by the calcium phosphate method. 24 h after transfection, cells were harvested by scraping at 4 °C with 400 μl of 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2,1× protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem), and disrupted by brief sonication. Cellular homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min, 4 °C at 20,000 × g. SK activity was determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” Cell Migration Assay—HUVEC migration was assayed using a 96-well chemotaxis microchamber (Neuro Probe, Inc.) as previously described (35Paik J.H. Chae S. Lee M.J. Thangada S. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11830-11837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Briefly, polycarbonate filters with a pore size of 8 μm were coated with 5 μg/ml fibronectin. S1P, FTY720, AAL, FTY720-P, or (R)-AFD was diluted in 0.1% fatty acid free BSA into the appropriate concentration. 85 μl of the solutions or conditioned medium from HUVEC were added into the lower chamber. Approximately 5 × 104 cells suspended in M199 with 0.1% bovine serum albumin were placed in the upper compartment. The cells were allowed to migrate for 4 h at 37 °C in a humidified chamber with 5% CO2. After the incubation period the filter was removed, and cells were stained in 0.1% crystal violet and eluted with 10% acetic acid in 96-well plates. Quantification was done based on absorbance at 575 nm by a Spectramax 340 (Molecular Devices) plate reader. Activation of FTY720 and (R)-AAL by Endothelial Cells—Cells were washed 3 times with plain medium M199 and incubated with 0.1% fatty acid free BSA containing different concentrations of FTY720 or (R)-AAL for 3 h. After incubation, conditioned medium was removed, centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min, and used in the migration assay. Analysis of Kinase Activity from Conditioned Media and Cells—Cells were washed 3 times with plain medium M199 and incubated with 0.1% fatty acid free BSA for the times indicated. After incubation, conditioned medium was removed, centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min, and used for the kinase activity assay. Cells were scraped at 4 °C with 400 μl of 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1× protease inhibitor mixture, and disrupted by brief sonication. Cellular homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min, 4 °C at 20,000 × g. SK activity was determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” In Vitro Kinase Assay—300 μl of conditioned medium (derived from 5 × 105cells for 3 h of incubation) or 10 μg of total cell extract from HUVEC were used as a source of kinase activity. Reactions contained 20 μm sphingosine, 100 μm FTY720, or AAL, [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi), 5 mm MgCl2, 15 mm NaF, 0.5 mm 4-deoxypyridoxine, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 300 μl of M199 and were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Lipids were extracted as previously described (29Ancellin N. Colmont C. Su J. Li Q. Mittereder N. Chae S.S. Stefansson S. Liau G. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6667-6675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), and samples were resuspended in 50 μl of chloroform. Lipids were resolved by TLC on silica gel G60 using 1-butanol/acetic acid/water (60/20/20 v/v) buffer and quantified with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Western Blot Analysis—Confluent cultures of HUVEC cells were serum-starved for 2 h in 0.1% fatty acid-free BSA M199 before treatments. Then they were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm sodium fluoride and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and homogenized in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovana-date, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture). Samples were centrifuged 10,000 × g for 10 min, and protein concentrations of supernatants were determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad protein dye reagent). Equal amounts of protein were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and blotted to a nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoblot analysis was performed using phospho-Akt, Akt, phospho-ERK1/2. or ERK-1/2 antibodies. Apoptosis—HUVEC cells were labeled with [methyl-3H]thymidine (1 μCi/ml) for 16 h. Then they were washed, and 0.1% BSA M199 containing the different treatments was added. After 8 h, fragmented DNA was solubilized and quantified as described (36Cuvillier O. Pirianov G. Kleuser B. Vanek P.G. Coso O.A. Gutkind S. Spiegel S. Nature. 1996; 381: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Analysis—2 × 105 cells were plated in 35-mm glass-bottom Petri dishes. Three days later, cells were washed and serum-starved for 3 h before the experiment. Then cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and fixed, and immunofluorescence analysis with VE-cadherin and β-catenin antibody (1 μg/ml; Santa Cruz) was conducted. Antibody staining was visualized with Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-goat (1:1000) IgG (Molecular Probes). Confocal microscopy was conducted on a Zeiss LSM 510 laser-scanning confocal microscope at the Center for Biomedical Imaging at the University of Connecticut Health Center. Fluorescence was excited using a 488-nm argon laser, and emitted fluorescence was detected with a 505-nm long-pass filter. VEGF-induced Trans-cellular Permeability in Vitro—Mouse embryonic endothelial cells (5 × 104) were cultured for 2 days in Transwell polycarbonate filters (6.5-mm diameter, 0.4-μm pores; Costar). Culture medium was replaced with serum/phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (0.1-ml upper chamber and 0.6-ml lower chamber). Cells were pretreated with FTY720, derivatives, or S1P for 1 h. FITC-dextran (average Mr = 2000 kDa) was added to the upper compartment either in the absence or presence of murine recombinant VEGF (50 ng/ml). Media from lower wells were taken after the indicated time periods (5–45 min). Samples were placed in black solid-bottom 96-well plates (Costar), and fluorescence intensities were measured using a CytoFluor(R) fluorescence multi-well plate reader (Applied Biosystems) at 488-nm excitation. VEGF-induced Microvascular Permeability—Normal FVB/N female or male mice were treated by gavage with FTY720 (50 μg), (S)-AAL enantiomer (50 μg), (R)-AAL enantiomer (50 μg) and water as the vehicle control. Five hours post-gavage animals were anesthetized with 2% Avertin™ (0.5 cc/20 g) and infused through the tail vein with 100 μl of FITC-dextran (5 mg/ml, 165 kDa). Animals were placed on a warming table under a fluorescent dissecting microscope (Zeiss STV11, Zeiss, Inc.), and the central vessels in the ear were imaged. Control saline or mouse vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF, 10 ng/ml) was injected subdermally into the middle ear using a 30-gauge needle (30 μl). Ear vasculature was then imaged with fixed exposure times in a stationary position from 5 to 120 min post-injection. Fluorescence images were then quantified using a pixel-based threshold in ImageProPlus (Media Cybernetics, Inc.) and quantified. Transmission Electron Microscopy of the Vasculature—Animals pretreated by gavage with water, FTY, or (S)-AAL for 5 h were used to inoculate the ear subcutaneously with mouse VEGF (10 ng/ml, 50 μl) while under anesthesia. Five minutes post-injection, the ears were removed and fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde/sodium cacodylate buffer, trimmed to isolate the injection site, and processed for osmium tetroxide post-fixation. After post-fixation, tissues were stained with uranyl acetate (0.5% in H2O), serially dehydrated with ethanol, and embedded in Polybed (Polysciences, Warning, PA). Analysis of the cross-section was performed by transmission electron microscopy on a Philips CM10. Sections (70–90-nm thick) were obtained, and vessels adjacent to the ear cartilage were photographed at various magnifications (8Lee M.J. Thangada S. Claffey K.P. Ancellin N. Liu C.H. Kluk M. Volpi M. Sha'afi R.I. Hla T. Cell. 1999; 99: 301-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—All experiments were performed two to five times, and a representative experiment is shown. In migration and apoptosis experiments results represent mean values of triplicates. p values were calculated by Student's t test using Microsoft Excel software. Phosphorylation of FTY720 by Sphingosine Kinases in Vascular Endothelial Cells—Because S1P is a potent inducer of endothelial cell chemotaxis, we tested the effect of FTY720 and its analogues on endothelial cell migration. Neither FTY720 nor its structural analog (R)-AAL (Fig. 1a) induced endothelial cell migration in a wide concentration range (Fig. 1b). However, when FTY720 or (R)-AAL was incubated with HUVEC for 3 h, they were activated into potent chemoattractants for endothelial cells. This conditioned medium-induced migration was dose-dependent and pertussis toxin-sensitive, indicating the involvement of a Gi-coupled receptor. In contrast, the enantiomer (S)-AAL, which cannot be phosphorylated by SK (31Brinkmann V. Davis M.D. Heise C.E. Albert R. Cottens S. Hof R. Bruns C. Prieschl E. Baumruker T. Hiestand P. Foster C.A. Zollinger M. Lynch K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21453-21457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar), did not induce migration after incubation with endothelial cells. These data are consistent with the notion that endothelial cells phosphorylate and activate FTY720 and (R)-AAL into FTY720-P and (R)-AFD, respectively, which are both potent chemoattractants for endothelial cells. Indeed we detected the presence of the SK1 and -2 transcripts in HUVEC cells by RT-PCR (Fig. 1c). We also tested the effect of DMS, which is a competitive inhibitor of the SK enzyme (25Liu H. Chakravarty D. Maceyka M. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 71: 493-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Liu H. Sugiura M. Nava V.E. Edsall L.C. Kono K. Poulton S.

Milstien S. Kohama T. Spiegel S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). DMS treatment (10 μm) potently inhibited the ability of endothelial cells to activate FTY720 and (R)-AAL (Fig. 1d). These results suggest that the endothelial cell-derived SK phosphorylates and activates both FTY720 and (R)-AAL in a stereospecific manner. To confirm that FTY720 and (R)-AAL are indeed phosphorylated by endothelial cells, we performed an in vitro kinase assay with both total cell extract and conditioned medium from HUVEC. FTY720 and (R)-AAL were phosphorylated by the kinase activity present in HUVEC cytosol (Fig. 2a, top panel, specific activity 3.85 ± 0.75 and 15 ± 0.93 pmol/mg/min, respectively). As expected, sphingosine was an efficient substrate for this kinase activity (specific activity 75.7 ± 6 pmol/mg/min). In sharp contrast, (S)-AAL phosphorylation was undetectable, in agreement with the results obtained with the migration assay. Phosphorylation of both FTY720 and (R)-AAL was inhibited by DMS (50 μm). Similarly, we also detected this kinase activity in the conditioned medium from HUVEC, although this activity was much lower than the cytosolic extracts (Fig. 2a, bottom panel), suggesting that both intracellular and extracellular SK enzyme systems are capable of phosphorylating FTY720 and its analog, (R)-AAL. Interestingly, this phosphorylation was inhibited by Triton X-100 and increased by KCl (200 mm) (data not shown), which are conditions that favor the enzymatic activity of the SK2 isoenzyme (25Liu H.

The recently identified GDP-Man 3′,5′-epimerase catalyzes a reversible epimerization of GDP-d-mannose that precedes the committed step in the biosynthesis of vitamin C, resulting in the hydrolysis of the highly energetic glycosyl-pyrophosphoryl linkage. Here, we characterize the native and recombinant GDP-Man 3′,5′-epimerase of Arabidopsis thaliana. GDP and GDP-d-glucose are potent competitive inhibitors of the enzyme, whereas GDP-l-fucose gives a complex type of inhibition. The epimerase contains a modified version of the NAD binding motif and is inhibited by NAD(P)H and stimulated by NAD(P)+. A feedback inhibition of vitamin C biosynthesis is observed apparently at the level of GDP-Man 3′,5′-epimerase. The epimerase catalyzes at least two distinct epimerization reactions and releases, besides the well known GDP-l-galactose, a novel intermediate: GDP-l-gulose. The yield of the epimerization varies and seems to depend on the molecular form of the enzyme. Both recombinant and native enzymes co-purified with a Hsp70 heat-shock protein (Escherichia coli DnaK and A. thaliana Hsc70.3, respectively). We speculate, therefore, that the Hsp70 molecular chaperones might be involved in folding and/or regulation of the epimerase. In summary, the plant epimerase undergoes a complex regulation and could control the carbon flux into the vitamin C pathway in response to the redox state of the cell, stress conditions, and GDP-sugar demand for the cell wall/glycoprotein biosynthesis. Exogenous l-gulose and l-gulono-1,4-lactone serve as direct precursors of l-ascorbic acid in plant cells. We propose an l-gulose pathway for the de novo biosynthesis of vitamin C in plants.

Vitamin C (l-ascorbic acid (l-AA) 1The abbreviations used are:l-AAl-ascorybic acidGSTglutathione S-transferasePMP1-phenyl-3-methyl-5-pyrazoloneGulguloseHPLChigh performance liquid chromatography.) acts as an enzyme cofactor and an antioxidant. In plants it may represent one of the major soluble carbohydrates and is involved in crucial physiological processes such as biosynthesis of the cell wall, phytohormones, and secondary metabolites, cell division and growth, and stress resistance and photoprotection (for review, see Ref. 1Smirnoff N. Wheeler G.L. Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 2000; 19: 267-290Crossref Google Scholar). Large variations in vitamin C content (from 0.003 to 1% of fresh weight; w/w), reported for different plant species, organs, and tissues (2Davies M.B. Austin J. Partridge D.A. Vitamin C: Its Chemistry and Biochemistry. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1991: 81Google Scholar), are intimately linked to the vitamin biosynthesis, stability, and function. Plants, algae, and the majority of animals are able to synthesize vitamin C. Humans, however, lack l-gulono-1,4-lactone oxidase, the last enzyme of the vitamin C pathway in animals, and require l-AA as an essential micronutrient. l-AA biosynthetic genes can be engineered to increase vitamin C content of plants (3Jain A.K.

The biosynthesis of vitamin C in plants is not completely elucidated, and its regulation is largely unknown. Two distinct pathways for vitamin C biosynthesis in plants were proposed (6Isherwood F.A.

Nature. 1998; 393: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). The salvage pathway involves pectin-derived d-galacturonic acid (6Isherwood F.A. Chen Y.T. Mapson L.W. Nature. 1953; 171: 348-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) that is reduced at C1 to l-galactonic acid by the recently identified d-galacturonic acid reductase (4Agius F. González-Lamothe R. Caballero J.L. Muñoz-Blanco J. Botella M.A. Valpuesta V. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), and the resulting l-galactono-1,4-lactone is oxidized to l-AA by the mitochondrial l-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase (8Østergaard J.

Conversion of d-galacturonic acid into l-galactonic acid results in the inversion of carbon numbering. However, labeling studies of Loewus and Kelly (10Loewus F.A. Kelly S. Nature. 1961; 191: 1059-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) indicate that a non-inversion pathway, in which a hexose is converted into l-AA without reversion of the carbon chain, predominates in plants. The second pathway (7Wheeler G.L. Jones M.A. Smirnoff N. Nature. 1998; 393: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar) is a non-inversion, energy-dependent biosynthesis that involves the conversion of GDP-d-mannose to GDP-l-galactose catalyzed by a GDP-d-Man 3′,5′-epimerase (11Wolucka B.A. Persiau G. Van Doorsselaere J. Davey M.W. Demol H. Vandekerckhove J. Van Montagu M. Zabeau M. Boerjan W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14843-14848Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). l-Galactose, released from the nucleotide through some poorly understood steps, is then oxidized at C1 to l-galactono-1,4-lactone by an l-galactose dehydrogenase (12Gatzek S. Wheeler G.L. Smirnoff N. Plant J. 2002; 30: 541-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar); the latter compound is converted to vitamin C by the l-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase. Recently, we obtained a highly purified GDP-Man 3′,5′-epimerase preparation from Arabidopsis thaliana cell suspensions and identified the corresponding gene (11Wolucka B.A. Persiau G. Van Doorsselaere J. Davey M.W. Demol H. Vandekerckhove J. Van Montagu M. Zabeau M. Boerjan W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14843-14848Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Only one copy of the epimerase gene is present in the Arabidopsis genome, and the gene is highly conserved among plant species (>88% identity at the protein level and >78% identity at the DNA level). A data base search revealed the presence of the epimerase sequence in cDNA libraries obtained from mature tomato fruits and potato tubers but also from salt- and pathogen-stressed ice plant and potato leaves, respectively. The unique double epimerization reaction of the activated form of d-Man catalyzed by GDP-Man 3′,5′-epimerase precedes the committed step in the biosynthesis of l-AA and glycoconjugates, which results in the irreversible hydrolysis of the highly energetic glycosyl-pyrophosphoryl linkage. Therefore, the epimerization step must be tightly controlled. Here, we show that the GDP-Man 3′,5′-epimerase of A. thaliana undergoes a complex regulation that is linked to the cell wall biosynthesis and the redox state of the cell. In particular, we demonstrate the formation of a novel intermediate, GDP-l-gulose, and propose that this compound could be dedicated for the de novo biosynthesis of vitamin C in plants.

Cell suspensions were pre-adapted to labeling conditions for 20 h in the presence or absence of exogenous l-AA or its precursors (2.5 mm) followed by a 2-h labeling with 1 μCi of d-[U-14C]Man. l-AA was extracted with 5% metaphosphoric acid containing 2 mm dithiothreitol and 1 mm EDTA. Bacterial Expression of the Recombinant Epimerase—Heterologous expression of the recombinant epimerase in Escherichia coli submitted to a “reversed” heat shock (a shift from 37 to 26 °C just before the induction) was performed as described (11Wolucka B.A. Persiau G.

Cells were re-suspended in 3 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.7, containing 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20% glycerol (buffer A). Crude extracts and 90% ammonium sulfate precipitates were prepared as described (11Wolucka B.A. Persiau G. Van Doorsselaere J. Davey M.W. Demol H. Vandekerckhove J. Van Montagu M. Zabeau M.

Nickel Nitrilotriacetic Acid Metal Affinity Chromatography of the Recombinant GDP-Man 3′,5′-Epimerase—A crude extract containing the His-tagged epimerase protein was loaded on a 2-ml nickel nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow column equilibrated with 5 mm imidazole in 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer pH 7.7 containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (buffer B). The column was washed with 10 volumes of the equilibration buffer followed by 5 volumes of 20 mm imidazole in buffer B. The elution was carried out with 3 volumes of 300 mm imidazole in buffer B. GST Affinity Chromatography of the Recombinant GDP-Man 3′,5′-Epimerase—A crude extract containing the GST-tagged epimerase was applied to a 2-ml GST-affinity column equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 15 volumes of buffer A, and the recombinant epimerase was eluted with 3 volumes of 10 mm glutathione (reduced form) in buffer A. Extraction and Assay of l-Gulono-1,4-lactone Dehydrogenase Activity—The l-gulono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase activity was extracted from white potato tubers essentially as described (14Ôba K. Fukui M. Imai Y. Iriyama S. Nogami K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1994; 35: 473-478Google Scholar), except that gel filtration was performed on NAP-25 columns (Amersham Biosciences) and the obtained high molecular weight fraction was separated by centrifugation (20,000 × g for 20 min) into the cytosolic (supernatant) and the mitochondrial (pellet) fractions. The dehydrogenase activity was measured spectrophotometrically at 550 nm by following the l-gulono-1,4-lactone dependent reduction of cytochrome c (14Ôba K. Fukui M. Imai Y. Iriyama S. Nogami K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1994; 35: 473-478Google Scholar). PAGE—Proteins were separated by SDS/PAGE using 12.5% minigels and the buffer system described by Laemmli (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Peptide Sequencing and Protein Identification—Tryptic peptides prepared from in-gel digested protein bands were analyzed by nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry, and the obtained sequence information was submitted to database searching as described (11Wolucka B.A. Persiau G. Van Doorsselaere J. Davey M.W. Demol H. Vandekerckhove J. Van Montagu M. Zabeau M. Boerjan W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14843-14848Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Protein Determination—Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Sugar Analysis—GDP-14C-labeled hexoses of the epimerase reaction mixtures were hydrolyzed in 50 mm HCl at 100 °C for 20 min. For HPLC analysis the acid-released 14C-labeled hexoses together with cold sugar standards were converted to the corresponding 1-phenyl-3-methyl-5-pyrazolone (PMP) derivatives (17Honda S. Akao E. Suzuki S. Okuda M. Kakehi K. Nakamura J. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). The HPLC system with on-line UV and radioactivity detection (13Wolucka B.A. Davey M. Boerjan W. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 294: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) was used. The solvent was 18% acetonitrile in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 or pH 5.0 (for separation of PMP-derivatives of Man and Gul) at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. To identify altrose, free sugars were separated by TLC on silica gel 60 aluminum sheets (pre-impregnated with 0.3 m NaH2PO4) in acetone/n-butanol/water (8:1:1, v/v/v) and detected as described (13Wolucka B.A. Davey M. Boerjan W. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 294: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Characterization of the GDP-Man 3′,5′-Epimerase—To gain an insight into the regulation of the de novo biosynthesis of vitamin C, we have characterized the native and recombinant epimerase of A. thaliana. The epimerase belongs to the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family (18Jörnvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzàlez-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Ghosh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6003-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). The native enzyme is a homodimer of 43 kDa subunits (11Wolucka B.A. Persiau G. Van Doorsselaere J. Davey M.W. Demol H.

The epimerase has a low Km for the GDP-Man substrate (4.4 μm) (Fig. 1A) compared to the Chlorella epimerase (96 μm) (20Hebda P.A. Behrman E.J. Barber G.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 194: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and to the related bacterial enzymes, GDP-Man 4′,6′-dehydratase (19Somoza J.R. Menon S. Schmidt H. Joseph-McCarthy D. Dessen A.

Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 1601-1612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) (280 and 38.6 μm, respectively). In contrast to the GDP-Man 4′,6′-dehydratase (23Sturla L. Bisso A. Zanardi D. Benatti U. De Flora A. Tonetti M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and GDP-l-Fuc synthetase (24Menon S. Stahl M. Kumar R. Xu G.-Y. Sullivan F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26743-26750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) of E. coli, the epimerase is strongly inhibited by GDP and GDP-Glc in a competitive manner, with respective Ki values of 0.7 μm (Fig. 1C) and 5 μm (data not shown). The enzyme recognizes the purine moiety of GDP-derivatives since an adenosine derivative, ADP-d-Glc, had no effect on the enzyme activity. Surprisingly, only a partial inhibition was observed with GDP-l-Fuc (I50 = 70 μm; Fig. 1D), even at 1 mm concentration (Table I). The sigmoidal inhibition curve with GDP-l-Fuc (Fig. 1D) is reminiscent of a feedback regulation observed in the biosynthesis of NDP-6-deoxyhexoses in bacteria (25Melo A. Glaser L. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 398-405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kornfeld R.H. Ginsburg V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 117: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 27Blankenfeldt W. Asuncion M. Lam J.S. Naismith J.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6652-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Like CDP-Glc 4′,6′-dehydratase of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (28He X. Thorson J.S. Liu H.-W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4721-4731Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the purified epimerase was stimulated by exogenously added oxidized forms of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotides, NAD+ and NADP+ (145 and 110% of control, respectively), and inhibited by their reduced forms, NADH and NADPH (78 and 88% of control, respectively) (Table I). Physiological concentrations (1 mm) of l-AA, a reducing agent and the end product of the pathway, inhibited the epimerase activity by 15% (Table I). In agreement with that, a feedback inhibition of the l-AA biosynthesis was clearly observed in vivo, since feeding A. thaliana cells with exogenous l-AA resulted in an increased level of the intracellular l-AA and a decreased incorporation of the [14C]Man label into l-AA (Table II). The partial inhibition of the epimerase by l-AA might be explained in terms of “reductive inhibition” (29Gabriel O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1978; 3: 193-195Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (7) Google Scholar), i.e. as an l-AA-dependent reduction of the enzyme-NAD+ complex in the absence of the nucleotide sugar. However, the same degree of inhibition (14%) was observed in the presence of 1 mm l-galactono-1,4-lactone (Table I), whereas d-isoascorbic acid and l-galactose had no effect. These facts suggest the existence of a stereospecific mechanism of the enzyme inhibition by sugar lactones.Table IGDP-Man 3′,5′ -epimerase activity in the presence of effectorsCompoundEpimerase activity1 mm% of controlNo addition100GDP0GDP-d-glucose0GDP-l-fucose37NADH78NADPH88NADP110NAD145l-ascorbic acid85l-galactono-1,4-lactone86 Open table in a new tab Table IIEffect of exogenous L-ascorbic acid l-AA and precursors on its de novo biosynthesis and cellular content in A. thaliana cell suspensionsCompoundCold l-AA (nmol/g fw)14C-labeled l-AA (10233 × cpm/mg fw)% of controlControl (no addition)212 (100)1342 (100)l-Gulose403 (190)872 (65)l-Galactose668 (315)423 (32)l-Galactono-1,4-lactone360 (170)790 (59)l-Gulono-1,4-lactone345 (165)722 (54)l-AA1764 (832)448 (33) Open table in a new tab We cloned the epimerase gene of A. thaliana (11Wolucka B.A. Persiau G.

Of the recombinant epimerase protein (3 mg/liter of culture), 90% were found in the soluble fraction, but only 30% of the total activity were retained on the affinity columns probably because of interactions with other proteins. Analysis of the affinity-purified enzyme by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B) followed by mass spectroscopy identification of the protein bands revealed the presence of the major GDP-Man 3′,5′-epimerase band and of a weak 70-kDa band corresponding to DnaK, a Hsp70 chaperone of E. coli (the tryptic peptides identified are TTPSIIAYTQDGETLVGQPAK, IINEPTAAALAYGLDK, and SLGQFNLDGINPAPR) Thus, the recombinant epimerase could interact with a Hsp70 molecular chaperone. During purification of the native GDP-Man 3′,5′-epimerase from A. thaliana cell suspensions (11Wolucka B.A. Persiau G. Van Doorsselaere J. Davey M.W. Demol H. Vandekerckhove J. Van Montagu M. Zabeau M. Boerjan W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14843-14848Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), a 70-kDa chaperone (DnaK ortholog) co-purified with the epimerase throughout the whole procedure and was identified in the NaCl eluate from Blue-Sepharose as a cytosolic Hsc70.3 heat-shock cognate protein of Arabidopsis (At3g-09440; the identified tryptic peptides are NQVAMNPINTVFDAK, NAVVTVPAYFNDSQR, DAGVIAGLNVMR, VQQLLVDFFNGK, and FELSGIPPAPR). The majority of the Hsc70 protein was separated from the epimerase by gel filtration. This step resulted in a 10-fold decrease of the epimerase activity, possibly because of not only the partial loss of the NAD cofactor (11Wolucka B.A. Persiau G. Van Doorsselaere J. Davey M.W. Demol H. Vandekerckhove J. Van Montagu M. Zabeau M. Boerjan W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14843-14848Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) but also the disruption of interactions with the Hsc70 chaperone. The steady-state parameters of the recombinant GST- and His-tagged epimerase were comparable with those of the native enzyme, although the recombinant enzymes were catalytically less efficient (Fig. 1A). The Vmax of the native enzyme was low, suggesting a rate-limiting enzyme. The overall catalytic efficiency of GDP-Man 3′,5′-epimerase, expressed as kcat/Km (9.1 s–1 mm–1), was fairly good and comparable with that reported for the GDP-l-Fuc synthetase of E. coli (21Rosano C. Bisso A. Izzo G. Tonetti M. Sturla L. De Flora A. Bolognesi M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 77-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Formation of GDP-l-Gulose by the GDP-Man 3′,5′-Epimerase of A. thaliana—The most intriguing observation was the variation of the apparent equilibrium constant Keq′ (from 0.1 to 1.5) measured for different preparations of the recombinant epimerase. Similar variations of Keq′ but in a narrower range (from 0.1 to 0.4) were observed with preparations of the native epimerase from A. thaliana. Also, an unexplained anomaly with the measured Keq′ values for the reverse reaction was reported for the epimerase of Chlorella sp. (20Hebda P.A. Behrman E.J. Barber G.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 194: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A, panel a, shows the HPLC profile of the reaction products at the equilibrium obtained with the affinity-purified epimerase. The measured ratio (Keq′) of the epimerization product(s) to the GDP-Man substrate was 0.6. If GDP-l-Gal were the only epimerization product, then a similar ratio (0.6) should be obtained for the mild acid-released 14C-labeled l-Gal versusd-Man. The measured l-Gal to d-Man ratio was only 0.35 (Fig. 2A, panel b), fact that indicated that the Man peak contained an unknown component. This component was separated from d-Man and co-migrated with l-gulose standard (Fig. 2A, panel c). Therefore, we conclude that the epimerase reaction mixture contained at equilibrium GDP-d-Man, GDP-l-Gal, and GDP-l-Gul in a respective ratio of 1:0.4:0.2. A similar analysis of the epimerization products obtained with an epimerase-containing 55–70% ammonium sulfate fraction from A. thaliana cell suspensions revealed the presence of GDP-d-Man, GDP-l-Gal, and GDP-l-Gul in a ratio of 1:0.18:0.09 (results not shown). Fig. 2B shows the HPLC profiles of the epimerase reaction products obtained with a crude recombinant enzyme (90% ammonium sulfate fraction) and the relative ratios of the GDP-hexoses formed. In this case the reaction was shifted toward the GDP-l-Gul formation and the relative ratios of GDP-d-Man, GDP-l-Gal, and GDP-l-Gul at the equilibrium were 1:0.4: 1.1 (Fig. 2B). Our results demonstrate that the GDP-Man 3′,5′-epimerase reaction can be dissected into at least two distinct epimerization reactions leading to the formation of two discrete products: GDP-l-Gal and GDP-l-Gul (Fig. 3). The fate of the epimerization seems to depend on the molecular form of the enzyme, probably as a result of its interactions with other proteins. Synthesis of l-AA from l-Gulose and l-Gulono-1,4-lactone by Plant Cells—In contrast to l-Gal, which is a minor constituent of plants, l-Gul, as far as we know, has never been reported in plants. Therefore, GDP-l-Gul might be dedicated to the biosynthesis of l-AA. To test this hypothesis, we supplied A. thaliana cells with cold l-Gul or l-gulono-1,4-lactone and measured the level of cold l-AA in the cells. As reported earlier for cress seedlings, preincubation with l-gulono-1,4-lactone (30Isherwood F.A. Chen Y.T. Mapson L.W. Biochem. J. 1954; 56: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) but also with l-Gul resulted in an increased level of vitamin C, and l-gulono-1,4-lactone was as efficient a precursor of l-AA as was l-galactono-1,4-lactone (Table II). Moreover, in the presence of cold precursors, a decreased incorporation of the [14C]Man label into vitamin C was observed (Table II), as expected for biosynthetic intermediates. l-AA inhibited its own biosynthesis (Table II) by a feedback mechanism apparently at the level of GDP-Man 3′,5′-epimerase (Table I). We demonstrated, therefore, that l-Gul and l-gulono-1,4-lactone are converted into l-AA by A. thaliana cell suspensions. The l-Gal dehydrogenase can use l-Gul as substrate (12Gatzek S. Wheeler G.L. Smirnoff N. Plant J. 2002; 30: 541-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). However, the mitochondrial l-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase is highly specific and does not oxidize l-gulono-1,4-lactone (8Østergaard J. Persiau G. Davey M.W. Bauw G. Van Montagu M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30009-30016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 9Imai T. Karita S. Shiratori G.-I. Hattori M. Nunome T. Ôba K. Hirai M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1998; 39: 1350-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Therefore, A. thaliana cells must possess another enzyme able to convert l-gulono-1,4-lactone to l-AA. l-Gulono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase activity was reported in the cytosolic fraction of Euglena sp. (31Shigeoka S. Nakano Y. Kitaoka S. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1979; 43: 2187-2188Google Scholar) and in the mitochondrial fraction obtained from potato tubers (14Ôba K. Fukui M. Imai Y. Iriyama S. Nogami K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1994; 35: 473-478Google Scholar). In agreement with Ôba et al. (14Ôba K. Fukui M. Imai Y. Iriyama S. Nogami K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1994; 35: 473-478Google Scholar), we could detect the l-gulono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase activity (0.66 milliunit/g of tissue) in the mitochondrial fraction from potato tubers (Table III). This activity represented about 30% that of l-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase measured with l-galactono-1,4-lactone as substrate (2.16 milliunits/g of tissue). Surprisingly, we found that the majority (75%) of l-gulono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase activity (4.51 milliunits/g of tissue) was present in the cytosolic fraction from potato tubers (Table III). The cytosolic enzyme(s) could use l-galactono-1,4-lactone as substrate, and this activity represented 90% that measured with l-gulono-1,4-lactone. These facts point to the existence of differently localized isozymes.Table IIIl-Gulono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase activity in cellular fractions from potato tubersSubstratel-gulono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase activityCytosolic fractionMitochondrial fractionmilliunits/g of tissuel-gulono-1,4-lactone4.510.66l-galactono-1,4-lactone4.062.16 Open table in a new tab The biochemical characterization of the GDP-Man 3′,5′-epimerase of A. thaliana has brought new insights into the de novo biosynthesis of l-AA and its regulation. The unexpected partial inhibition of the epimerase by GDP-l-Fuc (Fig. 1D) could be of paramount importance because, even at high concentration of GDP-l-Fuc in the cell, the epimerase would still supply GDP-l-Gal/GDP-l-Gul substrates necessary for the de novo synthesis of l-AA. The complex type of inhibition by GDP-l-Fuc could also play a role in the regulation of the cell wall biosynthesis in plants. In the presence of high concentrations of GDP-l-Fuc, the cellular level of the GDP-l-Gal precursor will be low, thus resulting in a lesser incorporation of l-Gal into glycoconjugates. Indeed, in the l-Fuc-deficient mur1 mutant of Arabidopsis, which lacks the GDP-Man 4′,6′-dehydratase activity (32Bonin C.P. Potter I. Vanzin G.F. Reiter W.-D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2085-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) catalyzing the first step in the GDP-l-Fuc pathway (Fig. 4), l-Gal replaces l-Fuc in xyloglucans (33Zablackis E. York W.S. Pauly M. Hantus S. Reiter W.-D. Chapple C.C.S. Albersheim P. Darvill A. Science. 1996; 272: 1808-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and N-glycans (34Rayon C. Cabanes-Macheteau M. Loutelier-Bourhis C. Salliot-Maire I. Lemoine J. Reiter W.-D. Lerouge P. Faye L. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 725-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We observed that the epimerase is stimulated by the oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides (NAD+/NADP+) but inhibited by their reduced forms (NADH/NADPH) and by l-AA (Table I). Because the NAD binding motif (GAGGFI) present within the epimerase sequence is a modified version of the common Rossmann consensus (GXGXXG) found in other members of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family (35Scrutton N.S. Berry A. Perham R.N. Nature. 1990; 343: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar), this feature could be responsible for a lower affinity of the enzyme for the dinucleotides and the corresponding stimulation/inhibition effects. Moreover, our in vivo experiments demonstrated a feedback inhibition in the vitamin C pathway (Table II). A feedback inhibition was suggested by others (36Pallanca J.E. Smirnoff N. J. Exp. Bot. 2000; 51: 669-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), but no potential target for it was indicated. The late steps of the vitamin C biosynthesis are not inhibited by the end product because exogenous l-galactose/l-gulose and l-galactono-/l-gulono-1,4-lactones are efficiently converted into l-AA (Table II). Therefore, the observed feedback inhibition must take place earlier in the pathway. GDP-Man 3′,5′-epimerase is partially inhibited by both l-AA and l-galactono-1,4-lactone in vitro (Table I). Inhibition of the reversible epimerase reaction by the end product could be of great importance because it would save the energy of the glycosyl-pyrophosphoryl linkage of the sugar nucleotide, otherwise irreversibly lost during the subsequent hydrolytic steps. We propose, therefore, that the GDP-Man 3′,5′-epimerase catalyzing the first specific step in the biosynthesis of vitamin C could undergo a feedback inhibition, sense the redox state of the cell, and play an important role in the regulation of vitamin C and cell wall/glycoproteins biosynthesis. We have shown that GDP-Man 3′,5′-epimerase produces a novel intermediate, GDP-l-Gul, in addition to the well known GDP-l-Gal (Fig. 2). Thus, the unique epimerization catalyzed by the epimerase is a complex reaction involving at least two distinct epimerization steps (Fig. 3). To our knowledge, this is the first report of a sugar epimerase releasing two different epimerization products (37Allard S.T.M. Giraud M.-F. Naismith J.H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1650-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Both recombinant and native GDP-Man 3′,5′-epimerase of A. thaliana co-purified with Hsp70 heat-shock proteins (E. coli DnaK and A. thaliana Hsc70.3, respectively). The Hsc70 heat-shock protein of Arabidopsis is constitutively expressed and stress-inducible (38Wu S.-H. Wang C. Chen. J. Lin B.-L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The highly conserved, ubiquitous Hsp70 chaperones play a key role in protection and adaptation to stress by participating in folding and unfolding of misfolded and native-state proteins (39Hartl F.U.

Hibino T. Tanaka Y. Nii N. Takabe T. Takabe T. Plant Sci. 1999; 137: 81-88Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 47Ono K. Hibino T. Kohinata T. Suzuki S. Tanaka Y. Nakamura T. Takabe T. Takabe T. Plant Sci. 2001; 160: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). On the basis of its chromatographic behavior and enzymatic properties (Keq′), we could detect different molecular forms of the epimerase, although the nature of these forms is not understood. Given the known functions of molecular chaperones and the fact that epimerase could interact with Hsp70 heat-shock proteins, we speculate that the Hsc70.3 protein of A. thaliana might be implicated in folding and/or regulation of the epimerase. l-Gulose is an extremely rare sugar. It is present in two bacterial products, a glycolipid of Thermoplasma acidophilum (archaeobacteria) (48Swain M. Brisson J.-R. Sprott G.D. Cooper F.P. Patel G.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1345: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and in the bleomycin of Streptomyces verticillus (Actinomycetales) (49Du L. Sánchez C. Chen M. Edwards D.J. Shen B. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 623-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), the synthesis of which involves the BlmG gene product, a close homolog of the plant epimerase (11Wolucka B.A. Persiau G. Van Doorsselaere J. Davey M.W. Demol H. Vandekerckhove J. Van Montagu M. Zabeau M. Boerjan W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14843-14848Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Significantly, gulose (of unknown absolute configuration) was found also in algae, for example in a glycoprotein of Volvox (50Mengele R. Sumper M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 298: 14-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and in the cell walls of Chlorophyta (51Burkhard B. Melkonian M. Kemerling J.P. J. Phycol. 1998; 34: 779-787Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Because l-Gul is apparently not a structural component of plants, we searched for a possible role of GDP-l-Gul in the biosynthesis of vitamin C. The hydrolytic step(s) leading from GDP-l-Gal to free l-Gal had not been identified (7Wheeler G.L. Jones M.A. Smirnoff N. Nature. 1998; 393: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar) and seems unspecific in vitro because totally different products compared with those reported (7Wheeler G.L. Jones M.A. Smirnoff N. Nature. 1998; 393: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar), namely l-Fuc 1-phosphate and l-Fuc, were obtained with crude extracts of A. thaliana incubated with GDP-d-[14C]Man (13Wolucka B.A. Davey M. Boerjan W. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 294: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculate that GDP-l-Gul might undergo an enzymatic hydrolysis and release free l-Gul. Indeed, l-Gul and l-gulono-1,4-lactone are intermediates in the l-AA biosynthesis (Table II), and l-gulono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase activity is present in plant extracts (Table III). Significantly, both gulonic and galactonic acids were present in metabolic profiles of plants (52Wagner C. Sefkow M. Kopka J. Phytochemistry. 2003; 62: 887-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Moreover, the Arabidopsis genome contains a family of closely related genes that show 22–24% identity with the rat l-gulono-1,4-lactone oxidase (At1g 32300, At2g 46740, At2g 46750, At2g 46760; At5g 11540, At5g 56470, and At5g 56490 (www.arabidopsis.org)). The predicted gene products contain at the N terminus a non-covalent FAD binding domain and are targeted to different cellular compartments (secretory pathway, cytosol, and mitochondria). Consequently, some of these proteins could be responsible for the observed conversion of l-gulono-1,4-lactone to l-AA. In summary, the first step of the de novo pathway for vitamin C in plants, catalyzed by GDP-Man 3′,5′-epimerase, undergoes a complex control and supplies two distinct products: GDP-l-Gal and GDP-l-Gul. We propose that, in contrast to GDP-l-Gal, which is used for the biosynthesis of glycoconjugates, GDP-l-Gul would be channeled directly into the vitamin C pathway (Fig. 4). After release, l-Gul could be oxidized to l-gulono-1,4-lactone by the l-galactose dehydrogenase (12Gatzek S. Wheeler G.L. Smirnoff N. Plant J. 2002; 30: 541-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) or a similar enzyme. The last step of the proposed l-Gul branch, oxidation of l-gulono-1,4-lactone by an organelle-specific dehydrogenase, may take place at different cellular locations and, thus, produce l-AA in situ with no need for its intracellular transport. Further studies will be necessary to unravel the nature and specificity of the hydrolytic step(s) responsible for l-Gal/l-Gul release and to determine whether both branches, involving either l-Gal or l-Gul, function in the de novo biosynthesis of vitamin C in planta.

Recent studies have identified the pim family of kinases as mediators of cytokine-dependent survival signals. Several studies have identified substrates for the pim-1 kinase, but little is known about the other family members, pim-2 and pim-3. We have investigated potential functions for the pim-2 kinase in factor-dependent murine hematopoietic cells. We find that pim-2 mRNA and protein expression are regulated by cytokines similarly to pim-1. Three PIM-2 protein isoforms are produced in cytokine-treated cells. All three forms are active kinases, and the short (PIM-2(34 kDa)) form is the most active at enhancing survival of FDCP1 cells after cytokine withdrawal. This pro-survival function involves inhibition of apoptosis and caspase activation. Enforced expression of PIM-2(34 kDa) kinase does not appear to regulate expression of BCL-2, BCL-xL, BIM, or BAX proteins. However, the kinase can phosphorylate the pro-apoptotic protein BAD on serine 112, which accounts in part for its ability to reverse Bad-induced cell death. Our results indicate that pim-2 functions similarly to pim-1 as a pro-survival kinase and suggest that BAD is a legitimate PIM-2 substrate.

Hematopoietic cells are dependent on peptide growth factors for survival and proliferation.

The signaling events that regulate these several phenotypic responses are of great interest, and many mediators of these responses are being characterized. Among the signaling intermediates implicated in hematopoietic cell survival is the pim-1 serine/threonine kinase (1Selten G. Cuypers H.T. Boelens W. Robanus-Maandag E. Verbeek J.

Furthermore, the kinase enhances factor-independent survival of hematopoietic cells, in part through a bcl-2-dependent pathway (4Lilly M. Kraft A.

These related enzymes show substantial homology, but differ in their tissue expression (16Eichmann A. Yuan L. Breant C. Alitalo K. Koskinen P.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1215-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). It is unknown to what extent the various family members differ in their biochemical effects. The pim-2 gene was identified as a frequent site for retroviral insertion in experimental lymphomas, both in normal and pim-1-deficient mice (14van der Lugt N.M. Domen J. Verhoeven E. Linders K. van der Gulden H. Allen J. Berns A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2536-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The pim-2 gene also encodes a cytoplasmic serine threonine kinase whose expression is regulated by hematopoietic cytokines (14van der Lugt N.M. Domen J. Verhoeven E. Linders K. van der Gulden H.

Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Like the PIM-1 kinase, there are multiple isoforms of PIM-2 protein (three in the mouse and potentially two in humans) due to the use of the alternative translation start codon, CTG (18Saris C.J. Domen J. Berns A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Functional similarity between pim-1 and pim-2 gene products has been inferred from studies of transgenic mice. Both pim-1 and pim-2 induce lymphomas alone or in synergy with c-myc (6van Lohuizen J. Verbeek S. Krimpenfort P. Domen J. Saris C. Radaszkiewicz T. Berns A. Cell. 1989; 56: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 14van der Lugt N.M. Domen J. Verhoeven E. Linders K. van der Gulden H. Allen J. Berns A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2536-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the relatively weak phenotype associated with disruption of the pim-1 gene (19Laird P.W. van der Lugt N.M. Clarke A. Domen J. Linders K. McWhir J. Berns A. Hooper M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4750-4755Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) suggests that its functions may be largely assumed by related molecules, such as the highly homologous pim-2 gene. Little is known, however, of the biochemical and molecular events through which the PIM-2 kinase may act. We have therefore sought to characterize the effect of PIM-2 protein in immortalized hematopoietic cells and identify potential molecular events modulated by this kinase. Our data indicate that PIM-2 kinase inhibits apoptosis induced by various stimuli. Furthermore, we implicate phosphorylation of BAD as a possible mechanism through which the enzyme may inhibit apoptosis. These data demonstrate that enforced expression of the pim-2 gene produces effects similar to those identified for pim-1 in immortalized hematopoietic cells. Cell Lines and Culture—The IL-3-dependent murine hematopoietic cell lines FDCP1 (obtained from Dr. Scott Boswell, Indiana University) and 32Dcl3 (obtained from Dr. Irv Bernstein, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center) were used for this study. Cells were cultured in RPMI1640 medium with 10% (v/v) iron-supplemented calf serum, and 10% (v/v) medium conditioned by the WEHI-3B cell line (a convenient source of IL-3). Jurkat cells (ATCC) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% iron-supplemented calf serum. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. HeLa, NIH3T3, and U2OS cells were maintained in McCoy's medium plus 10% iron-supplemented calf serum. Plasmids and cDNA Clones—The cDNA for the short form of murine PIM-2 protein (PIM-2(34 kDa)) was cloned from an FDCP1 cell cDNA library by PCR, using the published sequence for primer design. The cDNAs for long (PIM-2(40 kDa)) and medium (PIM-2(38 kDa)) forms were cloned by a similar approach from a murine spleen library (Stratagene). The cDNA for kinase-inactive PIM-2 was prepared by introducing a K61A mutation into the cDNA for both short and long forms of murine PIM-2 (long or short PIM-2(K61A)), by a PCR-based technique. In each case the start codon was changed to ATG, and was preceded by an idealized Kozak sequence. All cDNAs were ligated into the mammalian expression plasmid pCDNA3 (Invitrogen), then sequenced completely to ensure the absence of unintended mutations. A mammalian expression plasmid for a GST/murine BAD chimeric protein (pEBG/Bad) was obtained from New England Biolabs, and point mutations resulting in an S112A mutation were introduced into pEBG/Bad by standard molecular techniques. A puromycin resistance plasmid (pPGK/puro) was kindly provided by Dr. Glenn Begley. A mammalian expression plasmid for human pim-1 was prepared by subcloning the coding region from pLXSN/hpim33 (4Lilly M. Kraft A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5348-5355PubMed Google Scholar) into plasmid pCDNA3. For bacterial expression of the recombinant enzymes, the cDNA for the short form of PIM-2 was cloned into the plasmid pET15b, as was the cDNA for the short form of PIM-1. Transient Transfections—Transient transfection of human HeLa, U2OS, and murine NIH3T3 cells were performed in six-well plates. Near-confluent cells were transfected using 0.5–1.0 μg of each plasmid and FuGENE 6 transfection reagent, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Twelve hours later the medium was replaced with serum-free medium. After an additional 36 h of culture the cells were lysed and utilized for immunoblot analysis. Human Jurkat T cell leukemia cells were also utilized for transient transfection assays. Mammalian expression plasmids (10 μg of each test plasmid, plus 2.5 μg of a dsRed-encoding plasmid (Clontech)) were added to 5 × 106 Jurkat cells in 0.4-ml serum-free medium, followed by electroporation (Gene Pulser I; 960 microfarads and 270 V). The cells were then cultured in complete medium for 24 h and analyzed by FACS analysis for expression of the dsRed marker transgene. Construction of Stable Cell Lines—FDCP1 and 32Dcl3 cell lines stably expressing pim-2 constructs were prepared by electroporation. Ectopic expression of the PIM-2 isoforms was verified by immunoblotting (see below). FDCP1 cells stably expressing neo or pim-2(34 kDa) constructs were further transfected by electroporation with pEBG/Bad and pPGK/puro to produce additional cell lines. Puromycin-resistant clones were examined for GST/BAD expression by immunoblotting. Positive clones were then utilized for biochemical and cell growth experiments. Cell Survival and Apoptosis Assays—For enumeration of surviving cells, trypan blue-negative cells in 0.9 mm3 of suspension were counted in triplicate with a hemocytometer. Apoptosis was detected by an annexin V binding assay, using commercially available reagents (Oncogene Sciences). Cells were stained with both an annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate and propidium iodide. The proportion of cells that were fluorescein isothiocyanate high but PI low was taken to be the early apoptotic population. Populations were quantitated by two-color flow cytometry, using a BD Biosciences FACScan instrument. Anti-PIM-2 Monoclonal Antibody—A monoclonal antibody to murine PIM-2 protein was prepared as follows. BALB/c mice were immunized with recombinant murine PIM-2(40 kDa) protein. The antigen was produced in Escherichia coli as a 6-His-tagged fusion protein, utilizing the bacterial expression plasmid pET15b (Novagen). The recombinant protein was purified by affinity chromatography on a cobalt resin (Talon, Clontech) and was shown to consist of a single band on Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gel. Following fusion and selection, clones were screened by ELISA assay. Positive wells contained antibodies that reacted with recombinant murine PIM-2 protein but not recombinant human or murine PIM-1 protein. Positive clones were screened further by immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. One clone, 1D12 (IgG1), was selected for its ability to detect murine PIM-2 protein by both of these methods. Northern Blotting—mRNAs for pim-1 and pim-2 were detected by Northern blotting. 30 μg of total RNA were resolved on formaldehydeagarose gels, transferred to nylon membranes, and probed with 32P-labeled cDNA probes. For pim-2 detection the probe consisted of a full-length murine pim-2 cDNA. The pim-1 probe consisted of an EcoRI-BamHI fragment of the cDNA excised from pLXSN/hpim33 (4Lilly M. Kraft A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5348-5355PubMed Google Scholar). A 600-bp fragment of the chicken β-actin cDNA was utilized as the control probe. Probes were nick-labeled with [32P]dCTP using a commercially available kit (Bio-Rad). Western Blotting—Cells were collected, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in either 1% Triton lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VaO4, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) by vortexing, or in Chaps lysis buffer (50 mm Pipes/NaOH, pH 6.5, 2 mm EDTA, 1.0% Chaps, 5 mm DTT, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) by three freeze/thaw cycles. Lysate protein was then measured (BCA method; Pierce), and lysates were mixed with an equal volume of 2× Laemmli buffer. Equal amounts of total protein were added to each well for electrophoresis in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.). Membranes were blocked, then incubated with primary antibodies, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies. Antibody-antigen complexes were detected using chemiluminescence (Pierce). The following primary antibodies were used: anti-PIM-2 (described above), anti-BCL-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-BCL-xL (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-BAX (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-BIM (Chemicon), anti-procaspase 3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-active caspase 3 (Cell Signaling), goat anti-BAD (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; for transfected BAD proteins), mouse monoclonal anti-BAD (BD Transduction Laboratories; for endogenous BAD), and anti-phospho-Ser112 BAD, anti-phospho-Ser136 BAD, and anti-phospho-Ser155 BAD (Cell Signaling). In Vitro Kinase Assay—HeLa cells were transiently transfected with an expression plasmid for PIM-2(34 kDa) protein. Expressing cells were harvested then lysed in IP lysis buffer (1 mm DTT, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VaO4, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Alternatively, PIM-2 proteins were produced by in vitro translation, using pCDNA3-based plasmids and a commercial kit (TnT T7 Quick, Promega), followed by dilution of the reaction products in IP lysis buffer. In either case PIM-2 was immunoprecipitated with anti-PIM-2 antibodies. Immune complexes were washed with IP lysis buffer once, high salt IP buffer (IP buffer with 500 mm NaCl) twice, low salt IP buffer (IP buffer without NaCl) once, and then twice with PK wash buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 1 mm DTT). Reactions were done in 20-μl volumes, in kinase assay buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, NaCl 150 mm, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 μm protein kinase inhibitor peptide (PKI), 10 μm ATP) supplemented with 1 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 1 μg of GST-BAD recombinant protein as a substrate. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Kinase reactions were then diluted to 1 ml with stop buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol), and the supernatants were transferred to 25 μl of GST-agarose bead in a new tube. Samples were incubated with rocking at 4 °C for 1 h. Then beads were washed with stop buffer for three times. The GST-BAD retained on the beads was then dissolved in Laemmli buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The dried gels were visualized by autoradiography. Alternately kinase reactions were performed in buffer with 100 μm “cold” ATP but no radioactive ATP. In this case the phosphorylated substrate protein was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-BAD antibodies. The PIM-2 kinase assay was also performed in ELISA format. Wells of a polystyrene 96-well plate were coated with GST-BAD protein. Following blocking with bovine serum albumin, recombinant 6-His-PIM-1(33 kDa) or 6-His-PIM-2(34 kDa) protein was added in the above kinase buffer with cold ATP. The kinase reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h at 30 °C. Wells were then washed extensively. Phosphorylated substrate was then detected by addition of anti-phospho-BAD S112 antibody (1:1000) for 1 h at room temperature. The second antibody was a peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse IgG. Color development utilized Turbo-TMB reagents (Pierce). Reactions were read on an ELISA plate reader at 450 nm. For estimation of enzyme kinetics with the ELISA kinase assay, time-course experiments were performed in ELISA plates coated with different concentrations of substrate (0.5–2.0 μg/well). Enzyme concentrations were 100 ng of kinase per reaction. Enzyme protein concentration was measured with the BCA assay method (Pierce). Initial velocity (Vi) was estimated by the term, d(A 450)/dt, measured over the first 12 min of the reaction. Subsequent time points were also measured to ensure that the reaction rate was linear for at least 18 min. Two separate experiments, utilizing separate enzyme preparations, were performed, and the results were examined by Lineweaver-Burk analysis. In addition the Michaelis-Menten data were analyzed by non-linear regression, using the program PRISM (GraphPad Software), to obtain the estimates of V max and Tm . Expression of pim-2 mRNA and Protein Is Regulated by Cytokines in a Similar Pattern to That of pim-1—The ability of pim-2 to functionally compensate for the lack of pim-1 (14van der Lugt N.M. Domen J. Verhoeven E. Linders K. van der Gulden H. Allen J. Berns A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2536-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) suggests also that the expression of these two genes might be regulated in a similar fashion. To test this possibility, we cultured FDCP1 cells without IL-3 for 4 h and then stimulated them with a variety of cytokines for an additional 2 h. Northern blotting showed that both pim-1 and pim-2 mRNAs were induced by IL-3 and to a lesser extent by IL-4 (Fig. 1). By contrast, stem cell factor and IL-1α were unable to induce expression of either message. To determine if PIM-2 protein levels correlated with pim-2 mRNA expression, we developed a specific anti-PIM-2 monoclonal antibody. The 1D12 antibody identified PIM-2 protein with no detection of PIM-1 in immunoblots of transiently transfected HeLa cells (Fig. 2). FDCP1 cells expressed three PIM-2 forms, as expected (14van der Lugt N.M. Domen J. Verhoeven E. Linders K. van der Gulden H. Allen J. Berns A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2536-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), with the intermediate form being most abundant. PIM-2 protein levels closely paralleled the changes in mRNA (Fig. 1). FDCP1 cells deprived of cytokine had little PIM-2. IL-3 treatment induced a marked increase in the kinase protein. Prolonged exposure of the blot showed that IL-4 minimally induced expression of PIM-2, but stem cell factor and IL-1α failed to promote expression of the kinase (not shown). Transfection of Murine Hematopoietic Cells with pim-2 Expression Plasmids—To identify potential biological effects mediated by pim-2, we expressed the various isoforms, as well as an inactive kinase, in two factor-dependent murine hematopoietic cells, FDCP1 and 32Dcl3. In each case enforced expression resulted in a marked increase in the corresponding isoform protein (Fig. 3A; 32D cell data not shown). Levels of the PIM-2(38 kDa) protein in both cell lines were somewhat lower than for the other two forms. Expression of the kinase-dead long PIM-2(K61A) mutant was also detected. Expression of the transgene products did not decrease after IL-3 withdrawal in the FDCP1-derived cells or in 32Dcl3-based cell lines. The half-life of the expressed transgene proteins in stably transfected FDCP1 cells was measured after cycloheximide blockade of new protein synthesis (Fig. 3, B and C). The PIM2(38 kDa) protein exhibited an extremely short half-life (10–15 min), whereas the PIM-2(40 kDa) was somewhat longer (about 30 min). In contrast, PIM-2(34 kDa) had a half-life in excess of 60 min. Endogenous PIM-2 proteins were not seen due to the short exposure times for the films. PIM-2 Enhances Survival of Hematopoietic Cells after IL-3 Withdrawal or Doxorubicin Treatment—Both FD/neo and 32D/neo cells died in the absence of IL-3. Cells expressing pim-2 transgenes also died, but at a slower rate (Fig. 4; 32D cell data not shown) with some viable cells persisting for several days. The three isoforms of PIM-2 showed different survival effects. The shortest form (PIM-2(34 kDa)) was the most active isoform at inhibiting cell death, resulting in little change in cell number for up to 70 h of cytokine deprivation. However, the long and medium forms of PIM-2 were less active at delaying cell death. As expected, a kinase-dead K61A mutant did not promote factor-independent survival and actually appeared to enhance death during the initial observation period. In this respect the K61A mutant acts similarly to a dominant-negative PIM-1 protein, which also increases cell death during cytokine withdrawal (5Lilly M. Sandholm J. Cooper J.J. Koskinen P. Kraft A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4022-4031Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The pim-1 kinase has been implicated in resistance to genotoxic stresses such as ionizing radiation and cytotoxic drugs (20Pircher T.J. Zhao S.Q. Geiger J.N. Joneja B. Wojchowski D.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3684-3692Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We found that enforced expression of the active PIM-2(34 kDa) kinase also enhanced resistance to doxorubicin in FDCP1 cells, leading to a 2-fold increase in the ID50 for that agent (data not shown), compared with FD/neo cells. PIM-2 Inhibits Apoptosis and the Activation of Caspase 3 Associated with IL-3 Deprivation—Cell death in hematopoietic cells following cytokine withdrawal is thought to result from apoptosis, or programmed cell death. We have previously demonstrated that the pim-1 kinase inhibits the onset of apoptosis following IL-3 removal in FDCP1 cells (4Lilly M. Kraft A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5348-5355PubMed Google Scholar). Thus we questioned if the survival effects of PIM-2 protein resulted from decreased apoptosis. Because the greatest pro-survival effects were associated with enforced expression of the PIM-2(34 kDa) protein, subsequent studies focused on this kinase isoform. Apoptotic cells were measured by flow cytometry in FD/neo and FD/Pim-2(34 kDa) cells following IL-3 withdrawal. FD/neo cells had an increased proportion of cells within which were annexin V-positive and propidium iodide-negative, consistent with an increase in apoptosis (Fig. 5A). A mitochondria-mediated mechanism of caspase activation is involved in apoptosis induced by genotoxic drugs and growth factor withdrawal. We have examined whether overexpression of PIM-2 can regulate the activation of caspase 3 (Fig. 5B). IL-3 deprivation led to a decrease in the 34-kDa caspase 3 precursor in FD/neo cells, accompanied by a concomitant increase in the 17-kDa active fragment. In contrast, cleavage of caspase 3 precursor was remarkably inhibited by the overexpression of PIM-2 in FD/Pim-2(34 kDa) cells. These data demonstrate that pim-2 prevents cells from undergoing apoptosis by inhibiting caspase 3 activation. PIM-2 Phosphorylates BAD Both in Vitro and in Vivo and Inhibits Apoptotic Effect of BAD—To study the mechanism of how pim-2 inhibits caspase 3 activation, we examined its effects on the expression or activity of several members of the BCL-2 family of survival proteins. FD/neo and FD/Pim-2(34 kDa) cells were examined by immunoblotting after culturing them in the presence or absence of IL-3. Neither IL-3 withdrawal nor enforced expression of pim-2 led to changes in expression of BCL-2 or BAX. By contrast, IL-3 withdrawal was associated with decreased expression of BCL-xL and increased expression of BIM, but PIM-2 did not affect their expression any further (data not shown). We have previously seen that the PIM-1 protein can antagonize the effects of BAX protein expression, independently of bcl-2 expression (5Lilly M. Sandholm J. Cooper J.J. Koskinen P. Kraft A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4022-4031Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This suggested that PIM-1 could regulate the activity of other pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins, such as BAD (5Lilly M. Sandholm J. Cooper J.J. Koskinen P. Kraft A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4022-4031Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Indeed we have seen direct evidence that PIM-1 kinase can phosphorylate BAD. 2T.L. T. Aho, J. Sandholm, K. J. Peltola, H. P. Mankonen, M. Lilly, and P. J. Koskinen, manuscript submitted. We therefore asked if the PIM-2 kinase could phosphorylate, and thereby inactivate the BAD protein, as well. IL-3 removal leads to rapid dephosphorylation of BAD, and onset of apoptosis in some factor-dependent hematopoietic cells (21Salomoni P. Condorelli F. Sweeney S.M. Calabretta B. Blood. 2000; 96: 676-684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylation consensus sequences for pim kinases are similar to those of AKT and cAMP-dependent (protein kinase A) kinases (22Friedmann M. Nissen M S. Hoover D.S. Reeves R. Magnuson N.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Because these kinases can phosphorylate BAD, it seemed possible that PIM-2 could do so as well. PIM-2 proteins were purified by immunoprecipitation from U2OS cells transfected with expression plasmids for either wild-type or kinase inactive PIM-2(34 kDa) proteins. The enzymes were then assayed in an immunocomplex kinase assay for their ability to phosphorylate recombinant GST-BAD protein. Anti-PIM-2 immunoprecipitates from wild-type kinase transfectants were able to phosphorylate GST-BAD, whereas anti-prostate-specific antibody immunoprecipitates (isotype-matched negative control antibody) failed to do so (Fig. 6A). Recombinant GST protein alone was not phosphorylated by the immunoprecipitated kinase. To characterize the reaction further, we subjected PIM-2-phosphorylated GST-BAD protein to immunoblotting with anti-phospho-BAD antibodies (Fig. 6B). GST-BAD protein phosphorylated by wild-type PIM-2(34 kDa) protein reacted strongly with antibodies recognizing BAD phosphorylated on serine 112. Anti-PIM-2 immunoprecipitates from cells transfected with a plasmid encoding a kinase-dead short PIM-2(K61A) could only minimally phosphorylate the substrate, probably due to small amounts of other BAD kinases coprecipitating with PIM-2. Immunoprecipitates containing a kinase-inactive long form of PIM-2 were similarly ina"

In this study, we demonstrate that experimental stimulation of hyaluronan synthesis in normal epithelial cells is sufficient to induce mesenchymal and transformed characteristics. Using recombinant adenoviral expression of hyaluronan synthase-2, we show that increased hyaluronan production promotes anchorage-independent growth and invasiveness, induces gelatinase production, and stimulates phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway activity in phenotypically normal Madin-Darby canine kidney and MCF-10A human mammary epithelial cells. Cells infected with hyaluronan synthase-2 adenovirus also acquired mesenchymal characteristics, including up-regulation of vimentin, dispersion of cytokeratin, and loss of organized adhesion proteins at intercellular boundaries. Furthermore, we show that the transforming effects of two well described agents, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and β-catenin, are dependent on hyaluronan-cell interactions. Perturbation of endogenous hyaluronan polymer interactions by treatment with hyaluronan oligomers is shown here to reverse the transforming effects of HGF and β-catenin in Madin-Darby canine kidney and MCF-10A human mammary epithelial cells. Also, HGF and β-catenin induced assembly of hyaluronan-dependent pericellular matrices similar to those surrounding mesenchymal cells. Thus, increased expression of hyaluronan is sufficient to induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition and acquisition of transformed properties in phenotypically normal epithelial cells.

Thus, increased expression of hyaluronan is sufficient to induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition and acquisition of transformed properties in phenotypically normal epithelial cells. The transition from epithelial to mesenchymal cell phenotype involves morphological and biochemical changes in cell-cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization and the acquisition of migratory ability (1Hay E.D.

Many changes that occur during EMT are also seen in epithelial cells that have undergone malignant transformation. However, these changes in cancer cells do not follow an orderly program and are not identical to developmental EMT. In addition to changes in cell-cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization, common hallmarks of malignant cells are loss of adhesion requirements for survival and proliferation (anchorage independence) and the acquisition of invasive ability.Normal and malignant cell behavior is dependent on the composition and state of the pericellular matrix microenvironment. A prominent pericellular matrix component is hyaluronan, a high molecular mass glycosaminoglycan that is ubiquitous to the matrices of adult and embryonic tissues. In particular, however, hyaluronan is concentrated in the pericellular matrix of migrating and proliferating cells, e.g. during development (5Toole B.P. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). A definitive role for hyaluronan in development has recently been demonstrated in the hyaluronan synthase-2 (Has2) gene knockout mouse (6Camenisch T.D. Spicer A.P. Brehm-Gibson T. Biesterfeldt J. Augustine M.L. Calabro Jr., A. Kubalak S. Klewer S.E. McDonald J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Pericellular matrices in Has2-null mice are less hydrated than normal, with altered organization of matrix proteins. These mice show abnormal heart development due to defective cell migration and failure of cushion cell endothelium to undergo the EMT necessary for cardiac tissue development. The latter defect is due to loss of hyaluronan-induced ErbB2/3 and Ras signaling (6Camenisch T.D. Spicer A.P. Brehm-Gibson T. Biesterfeldt J. Augustine M.L. Calabro Jr., A. Kubalak S. Klewer S.E.

Med. 2002; 8: 850-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Thus, these experiments demonstrate an important and direct role for hyaluronan in EMT in this system.Many reports have provided evidence for a strong relationship between hyaluronan and tumor progression (8Toole B.P.

Experimentally increased production of hyaluronan in tumor cells via overexpression of hyaluronan synthases enhances tumor growth and metastasis in animal models (14Kosaki R. Watanabe K. Yamaguchi Y.

Although the underlying mechanism whereby hyaluronan influences cell behavior is not completely understood, several studies indicate that hyaluronan influences a number of signaling pathways that affect cell growth and survival (24Turley E.A.

In this study, we demonstrate that experimental stimulation of hyaluronan synthesis in normal epithelial cells is sufficient to induce mesenchymal and transformed characteristics. Furthermore, we show that the transforming effects of two well described agents, HGF and β-catenin, are dependent on hyaluronan-cell interactions and that hyaluronan appears to act via stimulation of the PI 3-kinase/Akt cell survival pathway.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Transfection—MDCK and MCF-10A human mammary cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). MDCK cells were grown in modified Eagle's minimal essential medium (American Type Culture Collection) and 10% fetal bovine serum, and MCF-10A cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 (Invitrogen), 5% horse serum (Invitrogen), 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Invitrogen), 10 μg/ml insulin (Sigma), 1 ng/ml cholera toxin (Sigma), 100 μg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma), 50 units/ml penicillin (Invitrogen), and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). The wild-type and degradation-resistant mutant (S37A) β-catenin plasmids were obtained from Drs. Stephen Byers and Rod Herrell (Lombardi Cancer Center) and have been described previously (25Orford K. Orford C.C. Byers S.W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 855-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Stable transfection was performed as described previously (25Orford K. Orford C.C. Byers S.W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 855-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Both β-catenin plasmids contain a neomycin resistance cassette for selection and a hemagglutinin tag for detection.Adenoviral Infection—β-Galactosidase and murine HAS2 adenoviral constructs were prepared in our laboratory using standard methods described previously (26Li R. Huang L. Guo H. Toole B.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 186: 371-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 27Ward J.A. Huang L. Guo H. Ghatak S. Toole B.P. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 162: 1403-1409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). MDCK cells were plated in 35-mm dishes on the day prior to infection to yield 70–80% confluency. The medium was removed and replaced with 1.0 ml of serum-free medium/dish, and then 200–300 adenoviral particles/cell were added to each dish. The dishes were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with gentle rocking. Complete growth medium (5% fetal bovine serum) was added, and the cells were incubated overnight and harvested for use.Pericellular Matrix (Coat) Assay—Hyaluronan-dependent pericellular matrices (coats) were visualized using a particle exclusion assay as described previously (28Knudson C.B. Toole B.P. Dev. Biol. 1985; 112: 308-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 29Heldin P. Pertoft H. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 208: 422-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well of a 6-well plate and cultured overnight. The following day, the cells were treated with or without 100 μg/ml hyaluronan oligomers (Anika Therapeutics) (23Ghatak S. Misra S. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38013-38020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) or 12.5 units of Streptomyces hyaluronidase (Sigma) for 1 h. An erythrocyte suspension (750 μl, ∼108 fixed human erythrocytes/ml) was added to each well and allowed to settle. Cells were viewed under an Olympus microscope, and pictures were taken with a Fuji Finepix 4700 digital camera. We used the Scion Image for Windows program to measure the coat size as defined by the area surrounded by red blood cells minus the cell area defined by the cell membrane.Quantitation of Hyaluronan—Hyaluronan content was determined using a previously described competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-like method (30Kongtawelert P.

Samples, standards, and blanks were incubated with biotinylated hyaluronan-binding protein (Seikagaku America, Inc.) and applied to hyaluronan-coated plates. Excess biotinylated hyaluronan-binding protein binds to the hyaluronan coating the plate and is detected with peroxidase-conjugated mouse anti-biotin monoclonal antibody (03-3720, Zymed Laboratories Inc.), followed by color development with o-phenylenediamine (P1526, Sigma) as described (31Gordon L.B. Harten I.A. Calabro A. Sugumaran G. Csoka A.B. Brown W.T. Hascall V. Toole B.P. Hum. Genet. 2003; 113: 178-187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Absorbance was measured at 492 nm using an EL800 universal microplate reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT). Concentrations of hyaluronan (5–160 ng/ml; Healon, Pharmacia Corp.) were calculated against a standard curve using a nonlinear two-site binding hyperbola equation in GraphPAD Prism Version 3.02. Statistics were calculated using Student's t test. Results represent means for three experiments, each repeated in triplicate.Colony Formation in Soft Agar—Cells in 2× growth medium with and without HGF (50 ng/ml; Calbiochem), hyaluronan oligomers (1–100 μg/ml) (23Ghatak S.

Misra S. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38013-38020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). After 13 days of incubation, 1 ml of 0.5 mg/ml 2-(p-iodophenyl)-3-p-nitrophenyl-5-phenyltetrazolium chloride vital dye was added per well to visualize viable colonies. On day 14, colonies were counted at a magnification of ×10 using a manufactured ocular scale (Olympus). Colonies measuring >100 μm in diameter were counted. For each experiment, duplicate wells were plated in three separate experiments. Statistics were calculated using Student's t test.Cell Invasion Assay—Matrigel invasion chambers (0.8-μm pore size; BD Biosciences) were used to measure cell invasion in vitro. Cells (2–3 × 103) were resuspended in 0.5 ml of medium without serum. Hyaluronan oligomers (1–100 μg/ml), chitin oligomers (1–100 μg/ml), or HGF (50 ng/ml) was added to the cell suspensions as specified. The cell suspension (0.5 ml) was added to each Matrigel insert. The bottom chamber contained growth medium with 5% fetal bovine serum and 10 μg of human fibronectin (BD Biosciences). After the specified time intervals, chambers were removed; the cells that had not invaded were washed away; and the invaded cells were fixed in glutaraldehyde (Sigma) and stained with cresyl violet (Sigma). The cells were scored under an inverted microscope. For each experiment, triplicate wells were plated in three separate experiments. Statistics were generated as described above.Apoptosis Assay—Apoptosis assays were performed as described previously (32Powell A.A. LaRue J.M. Batta A.K. Martinez J.D. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 104 cells/well were grown in suspension in low cluster 6-well plates (Costar Corp.) in complete growth medium. After 72 h, the cells were incubated for a further 1 h with and without 100 μg/ml hyaluronan oligomers. The cells were harvested, and 5 × 105 cells/ml were resuspended in the medium. 1 μl of a dye mixture containing 100 μg/ml each acridine orange (Sigma) and ethidium bromide was mixed with 25 μl of cell suspension. 10 μl of this mixture was placed on a clean microscope slide, coverslipped, and examined under a ×40 dry objective. Viable cell nuclei (stained green with acridine orange) and apoptotic cell nuclei (stained red with ethidium bromide) were counted. A minimum of 200 cells were counted.Immunoblotting and Zymography—Cells were incubated in suspension in low cluster 6-well plates in medium containing 0.5% serum for 48 h and then overnight in medium containing 5% serum in the presence or absence of hyaluronan oligomers (100 μg/ml). Cells were harvested and lysed, and aliquots containing equal protein concentration were separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose. After blocking and washing with Tris-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20, the nitrocellulose membranes were probed overnight with primary polyclonal antibody against Akt, phosphorylated Akt, or phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3β (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technologies). Membranes were washed as described above, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2000; Cell Signaling Technologies). ECL reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used for detection. Lysates of MCF-10A cells infected with recombinant adenoviruses were processed for Western blotting of MMP-9 (anti-MMP-9 antibody, 1:200; Oncogene Science Inc.) in a similar manner. Band densitometry was performed with an Eagle Eye camera. Results are indicative of three separate experiments. Gelatinase zymography was carried out as described previously (33Zucker S. Hymowitz M.

Pathol. 2001; 158: 1921-1928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation—Cell lysates were precleared with protein G Plus/protein A-agarose beads (Oncogene Science Inc.) for 10 min at 4 °C on an orbital shaker. Beads were removed by centrifugation, and lysates were normalized to 1 mg/ml total protein. The β-catenin immunoprecipitating antibody (1:200; BD Biosciences) was added to the cell lysate and incubated at 4 °C overnight on an orbital shaker. To capture the immunocomplex, agarose beads were added to the lysate and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The agarose beads were collected, washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 2× sample buffer. Beads were boiled for 5 min and centrifuged, and the supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transblotted. Membranes were incubated with antibody against E-cadherin (1:250; Sigma), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rat secondary antibody (1:1000; Amersham Biosciences).Immunostaining—Cells were seeded the day after adenoviral infection in 2-chamber slides (Falcon) in the presence or absence of 100 μg/ml hyaluronan oligomers. After 24 h, the cells were washed three times with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with cold (-20 °C) 100% methanol for 5 min. Cells were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (3 × 5 min), followed by blocking in 3% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline overnight. Cells were washed as described above and incubated at 4 °C overnight with antibody against β-catenin (1:500; BD Transduction Laboratories), E-cadherin (1:250; BD Biosciences), CD44 (1:250; Calbiochem), cytokeratin (1:250; Sigma), or vimentin (3–5 μg/ml; Oncogene) prepared in blocking solution. Cells were washed as described above and incubated with Texas red-conjugated goat anti-rat or anti-mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc.) prepared in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed as described above, coverslipped, and examined using the SPOT advanced program (Diagnostic Instruments). Duplicate chambers were plated in three separate experiments.RESULTSIncreased Expression of Hyaluronan Promotes Anchorage-independent Growth in Normal Epithelial Cells—Perturbation of cell-surface hyaluronan-tumor interactions by addition of hyaluronan oligomers or by experimentally induced expression of soluble hyaluronan-binding proteins leads to inhibition of cell survival pathway activity and malignant cell behavior in culture (20Yu Q.

Pathol. 2003; 162: 1403-1409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, we postulated that increased levels of hyaluronan synthesis in non-transformed epithelial cells may lead to enhanced hyaluronan-cell interactions and cell survival signaling pathway activity and thus to acquisition of transformed properties. To address this question, we experimentally elevated hyaluronan levels in phenotypically normal epithelial cells via increased expression of HAS2. This was achieved by infecting MDCK epithelial cells or MCF-10A human mammary epithelial cells with a recombinant HAS2 adenovirus. As expected, cells infected with the HAS2 adenovirus produced 2–4-fold higher levels of hyaluronan than cells infected with a control β-galactosidase adenovirus or uninfected cells, and these increases were observed in both the cell layer and the medium.We found that increased hyaluronan production in either MDCK or MCF-10A cells caused a clear-cut induction of anchorage-independent growth, as assessed by colony formation in soft agar (Fig. 1, A and B). To illustrate further that endogenous hyaluronan-cell interactions are important in this phenomenon, we tested whether hyaluronan oligomers reverse the effect of elevated hyaluronan production. The hyaluronan oligomers compete for binding of endogenous hyaluronan polymer to the cell surface, thus replacing high affinity, multivalent endogenous interactions with low affinity, low valence interactions (34Underhill C.B. Chi-Rosso G. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8086-8091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Lesley J. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. Hyman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26967-26975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of anchorage-independent growth was reversed by addition of hyaluronan oligomers, but not by chitin oligomers (Fig. 1, A and B). The chitin oligomers were used as a negative control because they are very similar in structure to the hyaluronan oligomers, to the extent that hyaluronan synthases are capable of synthesizing chitin oligomers (36Yoshida M. Itano N. Yamada Y. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 497-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Anchorage-independent growth was also reversed by addition of antibody against CD44, implicating enhanced hyaluronan-CD44 interaction in the onset of anchorage-independent growth.We have found, in previous studies performed with tumor cells, that inhibition of anchorage-independent growth by hyaluronan oligomers is due to suppression of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway (23Ghatak S. Misra S. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38013-38020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Thus, we asked whether promotion of anchorage-independent growth by increased hyaluronan production is associated with increased activity of this pathway. We first tested the effect of the PI 3-kinase inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin on HAS2 stimulation of anchorage-independent growth. Both these inhibitors reversed the effect of increased hyaluronan production (Fig. 1C). We then measured the effect of increased hyaluronan production on phosphorylation of Akt (protein kinase B), a major downstream effector in the PI 3-kinase pathway, and of glycogen synthase kinase-3β, one of its targets (37Scheid M.P. Woodgett J.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 760-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 38Brazil D.P. Park J. Hemmings B.A. Cell. 2002; 111: 293-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). We found that the MDCK cells infected with the HAS2 adenovirus had greatly increased levels of phosphorylated Akt and glycogen synthase kinase-3β compared with the control cells (Fig. 1D). We did not detect any significant change in the total levels of Akt in these experiments (data not shown).In our previous experiments with tumor cells, we have shown that hyaluronan oligomers have a negligible effect on cell growth under anchorage-dependent conditions, but induce apoptosis under anchorage-independent conditions (23Ghatak S. Misra S. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38013-38020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). As with the tumor cells, we observed no effect of the hyaluronan oligomers on growth of β-galactosidase or HAS2 adenovirus-infected cells in routine monolayer culture, i.e. anchorage-dependent conditions, using the same concentrations of hyaluronan oligomer as in the experiments above (data not shown). This result also indicates that these oligomers do not have a toxic effect on the cells. We then tested the effect of the oligomers on growth in suspension, i.e. under anchorage-independent conditions, and found that they induced high levels of apoptosis (∼80%) in the HAS2 adenovirus-infected cells (see below).Increased Expression of Hyaluronan Promotes Cell Invasion in Normal Epithelial Cells—Increased hyaluronan production also caused increased invasiveness in MDCK and MCF-10A cells, and hyaluronan oligomers reversed this effect (Fig. 2, A and B). The degree of stimulation by increased hyaluronan production depended on time of incubation and cell number. For example, in the experiment with MDCK cells in Fig. 2A, incubation was for 24 h, and apparent stimulation by HAS2 was only ∼2-fold. However, at shorter times of incubation, as shown for MCF-10A cells in Fig. 2B, a greater level of stimulation was detected. Reversal by the hyaluronan oligomers was ∼85% in both cases. Antibody against CD44 also had an inhibitory effect, but the degree of this effect was variable and not as great as that of the hyaluronan oligomers (Fig. 2, A and B). As with anchorage-independent growth (Fig. 1C), inhibitors of PI 3-kinase, e.g. LY294002, reversed the effect of increased hyaluronan production (Fig. 2, A and B).Fig. 2Increased hyaluronan levels promote invasiveness and gelatinase expression in epithelial cells. A and B, treatment with recombinant HAS2 adenovirus increased invasion through Matrigel by MDCK and MCF-10A cells, respectively. However, this effect varied with the time course of invasion. Invasion was inhibited by treatment with 100 μg/ml hyaluronan oligomers (HA-o) or the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002, but not by treatment with 100 μg/ml chitin oligomers (Ch-o). Antibody (Ab) against CD44 partially inhibited invasion. C and D, treatment with recombinant HAS2 adenovirus induced expression of gelatinases A and B in MDCK cells and gelatinase B in MCF-10A cells, respectively. Gelatinases were detected by zymography for both cells types. In the case of MCF-10A cells, Western blotting (D, right panel) was used to confirm the presence of MMP-9.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because increased invasiveness is usually associated with increased production of MMPs (39Egeblad M. Werb Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (5079) Google Scholar), we also determined whether increased hyaluronan production leads to increased MMP production. We found that HAS2-overexpressing MDCK and MCF-10A cells produced highly elevated levels of MMP-9 (Fig. 2, C and D). MMP-2 was also elevated in the HAS2-treated MDCK cells, but to a lesser extent than MMP-9 (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, however, these increases in MMP production were not reversed by treatment with hyaluronan o"

PTIOs are considered as monitors of ·NO, stoichiometric sources of ·NO2, biochemical and physiological effectors, specific tools for the elimination of ·NO, and potential therapeutic agents. However, a better understanding of the chemical properties of PTIOs, especially following their reaction with ·NO, is necessary to resolve many of the reported discrepancies surrounding the effects of PTIOs and to better characterize their potential therapeutic activity. We have generated electrochemically the oxidized and reduced forms of PTIO and carboxy-PTIO (C-PTIO), characterized their absorption spectra, and determined the reduction potentials for the oxoammonium/nitroxide and nitroxide/hydroxylamine couples. The rate constants for the reaction of ·NO2 with PTIO and C-PTIO to form the corresponding oxoammonium cations (PTIO+s) and nitrite were determined to be (1.5 - 2) × 107m-1 s-1. We have also shown that the reactions of PTIO+s with ·NO form PTIOs and NO2-. The rate constants for these reactions are approximately 30-fold higher than those for the reactions of PTIOs with ·NO or O2.¯. The present results show that (i) the reaction of PTIOs with ·NO forms solely PTIs and NO2- where [NO2-]/[PTI] varies between 1 and 2 depending on the steady-state concentrations of ·NO. Consequently, quantitation of ·NO is valid only at sufficiently low fluxes of ·NO; (ii) the reaction of PTIOs with ·NO can be used as a valid source of ·NO2 only when the latter is effectively scavenged by an appropriate reductant; and (iii) the formation of peroxynitrite cannot be efficiently inhibited by PTIOs even under relatively low fluxes of ·NO and O2 and millimolar levels of PTIOs.

Moreover, the reactions of ·NO with oxygen and superoxide convert ·NO into other reactive nitrogen species such as ONOO-, ·NO2, or N2O3, which can react with virtually all of the classes of biomolecules including amino acids, lipids, DNA, thiols, and metals (5Rubbo H.

One therapeutic approach to ameliorate ·NO-induced biological damage is to use ·NO scavengers, preferably selective scavengers that distinguish between free ·NO and species exhibiting ·NO-like biological activity. nitric oxide 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5,-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl 3-oxide 4,5-diaminofluorescein carboxy-PTIO 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate). The use of nitronyl nitroxides, such as 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5,-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl 3-oxide (PTIO), as selective traps for ·NO is rapidly increasing as reflected by the numerous publications in the recent biomedical literature.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar) demonstrated that excess of ·NO2 had no effect on the EPR spectrum of PTIOs and, subsequently, Reaction 1 has been adopted to generate ·NO2 (19Espey M.G.

Likewise, direct scavenging of ·NO by PTIOs has been shown to inhibit endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) in bioassay in vitro (12Akaike T. Yoshida M. Miyamoto Y. Sato K. Kohno M. Sasamoto K.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Therefore, PTIOs are not only useful as spin traps of ·NO and generators of ·NO2 but also provide insight into the physiology of ·NO and potential use as a target specific therapeutic to intervene in various diseases caused by excess production of ·NO. However, as is the case with other cyclic nitroxides, nitronyl nitroxide may undergo one-electron redox reactions to yield the respective hydroxylamine and oxoammonium cation (Scheme 1). We recently demonstrated that cyclic nitroxides are readily oxidized by ·NO2 to form the respective oxoammonium cations (23Goldstein S. Samuni A. Russo A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2003; 125: 836-8370Google Scholar), which are reduced by ·NO back to the parent nitroxides (24Goldstein S. Samuni A. Merenyi G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). If this is also the case with PTIOs, their use as selective scavengers for ·NO and generators of ·NO2 seems to meet a serious limitation. Peffiefer et al. (25Pfeiffer S. Leopold E. Hemmens B. Schmidt K. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) have already indicated that the effects of C-PTIO are diverse and questioned its claimed specificity as ·NO scavenger. Espey et al. (19Espey M.G. Miranda K.M. Thomas D.D. Wink D.A. J. Biol.

They found that the nitrosation yield formed via Reaction 1 is considerably higher than that formed during autoxidation of ·NO in aqueous solutions and concluded that ·NO2 is not formed as an intermediate during autoxidation of ·NO. This conclusion contradicts the results obtained by many other studies (26Pires M. Rossi M.J. Ross D.S. Int. J. Chem. Kinet. 1994; 26: 1207-1227Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 27Lewis R.S.

Haseloff et al. (32Haseloff R.F. Zollner S. Kirilyuk I.A. Grigorev I.A. Reszka R. Bernhardt R. Mertsch K. Roloff B. Blasig I.E. Free Radic. Res. 1997; 26: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) reported that the rate constant for the reduction of nitronyl nitroxides by O2.¯ is more than two orders of magnitude higher than that for Reaction 1 and suggested that PTIOs can protect against ·NO-induced damage by preventing the formation of peroxynitrite. Conversely, Rosen et al. (16Rosen G.M. Porasuphatana S. Tsai P. Ambulos N.P. Galtsev V.E. Ichikawa K. Halpern H.J. Macromolecules. 2003; 36: 1021-1027Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar) found that the half-life of 5 μm C-PTIO exposed to a flux of 10 μm/min of O2.¯ at pH 7.4 is ∼10 min, which indicates that the rate of the reduction of C-PTIO is considerably lower than that reported by Haseloff et al. (32Haseloff R.F. Zollner S. Kirilyuk I.A. Grigorev I.A. Reszka R. Bernhardt R. Mertsch K. Roloff B. Blasig I.E. Free Radic. Res. 1997; 26: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This demonstrates the need for a detailed investigation of the reactions of PTIOs and PTIO+s with ·NO, ·NO2, and superoxide radicals. In this study, the reactions of these radicals with PTIO, C-PTIO, and their corresponding oxoammonium cations were investigated using pulse radiolysis and rapid-mixing stopped-flow techniques. Materials—All of the chemicals were of analytical grade and were used as received. Water for preparation of the solutions was distilled and purified using a Milli-Q purification system. PTIO and C-PTIO were purchased from Sigma and Cayman Chemical Company, respectively. Xanthine oxidase, catalase, hypoxanthine, ferricytochrome c, and 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS2-) were purchased from Sigma. Nitric oxide was purchased from Matheson Gas Products and was purified by passing it through a series of scrubbing bottles containing deaereated 50% NaOH and purified water in this order. Nitric oxide solutions were prepared in gas-tight syringes, and the solubility of ·NO in water at 22 °C was taken to be 1.9 mm/atm. The oxoammonium cations and the respective hydroxylamines were prepared using an electrochemical reactor. The cell consisted of a working electrode of graphite grains packed inside a porous Vycor glass tube (5-mm inner diameter) through which 0.1 mm PTIO or C-PTIO in 4 mm phosphate buffer (PB) at pH 6.8 was pumped (4 ml min-1). An outer glass cylinder contained 0.1 m NaCl in which a Pt auxiliary electrode and Ag/AgCl wire as a reference electrode were immersed. A BAS100B electrochemical analyzer controlled the voltage. Immediately following electro-oxidation or reduction, the solution was pumped through a 1-cm optical flow cell positioned within a HP 8453 diode array spectrophotometer. Superoxide radicals were generated by the addition of xanthine oxidase (0.002 units/ml) to aerated solutions containing 2.5 mm hypoxanthine, 130 units/ml catalase, 50 μm DTPA, and 160 mm phosphate buffer at pH 5.5-8.5. The flux of O2.¯ under these experimental conditions was 2 μm/min as determined by monitoring the reduction of ferricytochrome c at 550 nm as described previously (33McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 1374-1379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Kuthan H. Ullrich V. Estabrook R.W. Biochem. J. 1982; 203: 551-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Methods—Cyclic voltammetry was performed with a BAS100B electrochemical analyzer. We used a three-electrode system consisting of a graphite (2-mm inner diameter) working electrode, a Pt wire auxillary electrode, and an Ag/AgCl wire as a reference electrode. In a typical experiment, the electrodes were immersed into solutions containing 0.1 m NaCl, 10 mm PB, and 1 mm PTIO or C-PTIO. The solutions were purged with purified argon, and an argon atmosphere was maintained over the solution throughout the measurements. The potentials quoted versus normal hydrogen electrode were corrected for Ag/AgCl in 0.1 m NaCl against normal hydrogen electrode (i.e. +288 mV). Stopped-flow kinetic measurements were carried out using the Bio SX-17MV sequential stopped-flow from Applied Photophysics with a 1-cm optical path. Anaerobic experiments were carried out while flushing the syringe cups with inert gas. The final pH in each experiment was measured at the outlet of the stopped-flow. All of the experiments were carried out at 25 °C. Pulse radiolysis experiments were carried out using a 5-MeV Varian 7715 linear accelerator (0.05-0.5-μs electron pulses, 200-mA current). The dose per pulse was determined with N2O-saturated solutions containing 5 mm KSCN. A 200-watt Xe lamp produced the analyzing light. Appropriate cut-off filters were used to minimize photochemistry. All of the measurements were made at room temperature using a 1-cm spectrosil cell and applying three light passes. EPR spectra were recorded using a JEOL X band JES-RE3X spectrometer operating at 9.5 GHz with the center field set at 3362 G (100 kHz modulation frequency; 1-G modulation amplitude; 4-milliwatt incident microwave power). The nitroxide concentration was calculated from the EPR signal intensity using standard solutions of the nitroxide. Cyclic Voltammetry—The redox properties of PTIO and C-PTIO were investigated by cyclic voltammetry at varying pH values. Cyclic voltammograms for PTIO at pH 3.5 are shown in Fig. 1 and demonstrate the difference between the first and the second cycle upon increasing the voltage from 250 mV in the positive direction. An anodic peak at 658 mV and a cathodic one at 588 mV reflect a midpoint potential of E1/2ox = 623 mV, which is attributed to the reversible oxidation of the nitroxide to the oxoammonium cation. The scan of the negative potential region shows a cathodic peak at 150 mV in the first and second cycle and an anodic peak at 230 mV only in the second cycle. The two cycles were identical upon varying the voltage from 250 mV into the negative region. Hence, the latter current peak is attributed to the reversible oxidation of the hydroxylamine into the nitroxide where E1/2red = 190 mV at pH 3.5. The voltammetric behavior of C-PTIO was similar to that of PTIO. Reversible oxidation of both PTIO and C-PTIO was found at pH 1.5-8.8, resulting in E1/2ox = 627 ± 7 and 648 ± 15 mV, respectively (i.e. 915 ± 10 and 936 ± 21 mV versus normal hydrogen electrode). Both the reduction and reoxidation peaks of PTIO and C-PTIO varied with the pH value. Fig. 2 illustrates the cyclic voltammograms of C-PTIO at various pH values. Reversible one-electron redox reaction was obtained only below pH 5 where the peak separation is <100 mV. The calculated half-wave potentials, E1/2red, as a function of pH are given in Fig. 3, resulting in two straight lines that intersect each other around pH 3.5. The slopes of the linear plots in the pH above and below the intersection are -58 and -121 mV/pH, respectively, and reflect the participation of one and two hydrogen ions, respectively, in the electrode reaction (Scheme 2). Following Reactions 2-4, the potential of the electrode, Ered, depends on K3, K4, and the pH value, and is expressed by Equation 1,<INLINE-FIG><LINKLOCATOR=""2785150949""></INLINE-FIG>Reactions 2-4 Ered=E0+(RT/F)ln([PTIO]/[PTIO-])=Eo-(RT/F)ln(K3K4)+(RT/F)ln(K3K4+K5[H+]+[H+]2)+(RT/F)ln([PTIO]/[PTIO-]T)(Eq. 1) where [PTIO-]T = [PTIO-] + [PTIO-H] + [PTIO-H2+]. Equation 2 is obtained by assuming that the diffusion coefficients of all of the species involved are equal.E1/2red=Eo-(RT/F)ln(K3K4)+(RT/F)ln(K3K4+K4[H+]+[H+]2)(Eq. 2) Thus, the plot of E1/2redversus pH should have a slope of -2RT/F = -118 mV at [H+] >> K4, a slope of -RT/F = -59 mV at K4 >> [H+] >> K3, and E1/2red should remain constant at [H+] << K3. Under our experimental conditions, the folding of the plots at K3 was not observed. The intersection of the two lines yields pK4 = 3.5 for PTIO-H and C-PTIO-H, indicating that these hydroxylamines are stronger acids than (CH3)2NOH (pKa = 5.2) (35Bissot T.C. Parry R.W. Campbell D.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1957; 79: 796-800Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Bulk Electrolysis—PTIO and C-PTIO were electro-oxidized to the corresponding oxoammonium cations in aerated solutions at pH 7.0 (10 mm PB) by applying a voltage of 0.8 V (versus Ag/AgCl,Cl- 0.1 m). The oxidation yield was determined using ferrocyanide, which is rapidly oxidized by oxoammonium cations (ϵ420(Fe(CN)63-) = 1,000 m-1 cm-1) (23Goldstein S. Samuni A. Russo A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2003; 125: 836-8370Google Scholar). Similarly, the nitroxides were reduced in anoxia by reversing the voltage and the reduction yield was determined using ferricyanide, which can efficiently oxidize hydroxylamines to their corresponding nitroxides. Both the oxidation and reduction yields approached 100%. The UV-visible spectra of the nitroxides and their oxidized and reduced forms are given in Figs. 4 and 5. The respective differential spectra are presented in the inset of these figures and demonstrate that the formation and decay of PTIO+ and C-PTIO+ can be readily followed spectrophotometrically around 300 and 450 nm.Fig. 5The UV-visible spectra of C-PTIO (solid line), C-PTIO+(dotted line), C-PTIO-H (dashed line), and C-PTI (thin solid line). Electrochemical oxidation and reduction of 0.1 mm C-PTIO in aerated solutions containing 4 mm PB at pH 7.0 were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures” by applying a voltage of 1 V. PTI was obtained by flushing the deaerated solution of C-PTIO with ·NO.

Schwarz H.A. Czapski G. J. Phys. Chem. A. 2002; 106: 7245-7250Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The reaction of ·NO2 with an excess of PTIO or C-PTIO was studied by following the absorption changes at 290-500. A rapid first-order formation of a transient species was observed, which was identified as PTIO+ or C-PTIO+, respectively. The formation of the oxoammonium cations was followed by a second order decay. The observed rate constants were determined by following the absorption changes at 290, 360, and 445 nm (see the insets in Figs. 4 and 5). The observed first-order rate constant for the formation of the oxoammonium cations increased with increasing [nitroxide]o at a constant [NO2-]o, and the second-order decay was linearly dependent on [nitroxide]o-2 at a constant [NO2-]o and dependent on [NO2-]o2 at a constant [nitroxide]o (Fig. 6). These results are similar to those found recently for piperidine- and pyrrolidine-based nitroxides, which suggest that the mechanism for the formation and decay of PTIO+ and C-PTIO+ is described by Reactions 8 and 9.PTIO(C-PTIO)+.NO2⇌PTIOO+(C-PTIO)++NO2-NO2.+NO2.+H2O→NO2-+NO3-+2H+2k9=1.3×108M-1s-1(36)Reactions8and9Reactions 8 and 9 Assuming that Reaction 8 rapidly approaches equilibrium, the rate-limiting step for the decay of the oxoammonium cation is Reaction 9 and rate Equation 3 is obtained.-d[PTIO+]dt=2k9[NO2-]O2[PTIO+]2K82[PTIO]O2(Eq. 3) Hence, plots of kobsversus [NO2-]2 at a constant [PTIO] or versus [PTIO]-2 at a constant [NO2-] should be linear (Fig. 6). The results demonstrate that K8 = 145 ± 15 for both PTIO and C-PTIO, independent of being determined from the slope of the lines in Fig. 6, A or B. Hence, the reduction potential of the PTIO/PTIO+ and C-PTIO/C-PTIO+ couples is the same and was calculated using K8 and Eo(·NO2/NO2-) = 1.04 V to be 912 mV. The latter value is in agreement with the mid-potentials, which were determined by cyclic voltammetry to be 915 ± 10 and 936 ± 21 mV, respectively. To determine accurately the rate constant of Reaction 8, we used ABTS2- as an efficient scavenger of oxoammonium cations (23Goldstein S. Samuni A. Russo A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2003; 125: 836-8370Google Scholar). The ·NO2-induced formation of ABTS·- in the presence of 250 μm ABTS2- was followed at 416 nm (ϵ416 = 36,000 m-1 cm-1) where [·NO2]o = ∼1 μm. The yield of ABTS·- was unaffected upon the addition of PTIO or C-PTIO, whereas kobs = (4.0 ± 0.1) × 103 s-1 in the absence of the nitroxides increased upon their addition (Fig. 7). From the slope of the lines in Fig. 7, we determined k8 = (2.0 ± 0.1) × 107m-1 s-1 for PTIO and (1.5 ± 0.1) × 107m-1 s-1 for C-PTIO. Reaction of·NO with PTIO+and C-PTIO+and Their Corresponding Nitroxides—The reaction of excess of ·NO with PTIO+ or C-PTIO+ was studied in deaerated solutions at pH 6.8 ± 0.1 (7-10 mm PB). The first-order decay of the oxoammonium cations monitored at 310 nm was followed by a slower first-order build-up. The observed rate constants of both processes were linearly dependent on [·NO] (Fig. 8). Therefore, we attribute the first process to the reduction of the oxoammonium cations back to the nitroxides by ·NO (Reaction 10), which is followed by the slower reaction of the nitroxides with ·NO (Reaction 1)..NO+PTIO+(C-PTIO+)+H2O→PTIO(C-PTIO)+NO2-+2H+Reaction10Reaction 10 The rate constants for Reaction 1 and Reaction 10 were obtained from the slopes of the lines in Fig. 8 and are summarized in Table I. These values agree with those determined previously by stopped-flow EPR and spectrophotometric methods (12Akaike T. Yoshida M. Miyamoto Y. Sato K. Kohno M. Sasamoto K. Miyazaki K. Ueda S. Maeda H.

The formation of PTI or C-PTI was followed at 300 nm in the absence of ABTS2- and was found to obey first-order kinetics where kobs increased linearly with [·NO], resulting in k1 = (4.1 ± 0.1) × 103 and (6.0 ± 0.2) × 103m-1 s-1, respectively (Fig. 9). In the presence of an excess of ABTS2- over the PTIOs, the build-up of the absorption at 416 nm was observed and the measured yield of ABTS·- was identical to that of [PTIOs]o. In addition, the rate of the formation of ABTS·- was first order with the same dependence on [·NO]o as in the absence of ABTS2- (Fig. 9 and Table I). Finally, the latter experiment demonstrates the formation of ·NO2 via Reaction 1. Reaction of Superoxide Radicals with PTIO and C-PTIO— The reaction of ∼1 μm HO2· with 50 μm PTIO or C-PTIO was studied upon pulse-irradiation of oxygenated solutions containing 0.1 m formate at pH 3.6 in the absence and presence of 100 μm ABTS2-. Under such conditions where all of the primary radicals formed by the radiation (Reaction 5) are converted into HO2· (pKa(HO2·) = 4.8), the corresponding oxoammonium cation or ABTS·- was not observed. The apparent rate constant for the dismutation of HO2· is ∼1 × 107m-1 s-1 at pH 3.6, and therefore, the rate constant for the reaction of HO2· with PTIO or C-PTIO cannot exceed 2 × 104m-1 s-1. The reaction with O2.¯ was studied upon pulse-irradiation of oxygenated solutions containing 20 mm formate and 8 mm PB at pH 8.5. In the case of PTIO, the bleaching of the absorption was observed both at 355 and 560 nm where ΔA355/ΔA560 = ∼6. The absorption of C-PTIO at 360 nm is relatively higher than that of PTIO (Figs. 4 and 5), and therefore, the bleaching of the absorption was followed at 370-375 and 560 nm where ΔA375/ΔA560 = ∼2. These observations indicate that O2.¯ reduced PTIO and C-PTIO to their respective hydroxylamines (see Figs. 4 and 5) via Reaction 11.PTIO(C-PTIO)+O2.¯+H+→PTIO-H(C-PTIO-H)+O2Reaction11Reaction 11 The bleaching of the absorption obeyed first-order kinetics, and kobs increased upon increasing [PTIO] or [C-PTIO], thus resulting in k11 = (2.0 ± 0.4) × 103 or (9.3 ± 0.5) × 103m-1 s-1, respectively (Fig. 10). These rate constants are ∼100-fold lower than that reported previously (32Haseloff R.F. Zollner S. Kirilyuk I.A. Grigorev I.A. Reszka R. Bernhardt R. Mertsch K. Roloff B. Blasig I.E. Free Radic. Res. 1997; 26: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) (i.e. 8.8 × 105m-1 s-1 for another derivative of PTIO where r = N(CH3)3+) (32Haseloff R.F. Zollner S. Kirilyuk I.A. Grigorev I.A. Reszka R. Bernhardt R. Mertsch K. Roloff B. Blasig I.E. Free Radic. Res. 1997; 26: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The reaction of superoxide radicals with PTIO and C-PTIO was also studied by exposure to a constant flux of [O2.¯]0=1μM. The EPR signal of PTIO or C-PTIO was monitored as a function of time upon exposure of 8-10 μm nitronyl nitroxide to a flux of [O2.¯]0=1μM (2 μm/min). The initial rate of the decay of the EPR signal was considerably lower than the flux of [O2.¯]0=1μM, indicating that the non-enzymatic dismutation of superoxide efficiently competes with its reaction with PTIOs. Complete reduction of PTIO or C-PTIO was not observed. Instead, a steady-state residual concentration of 1-1.4% was achieved after 30 min and persisted as long as the [O2.¯]0=1μM flux persisted. The failure of O2. to reduce completely PTIO and C-PTIO suggests that under such conditions both HO2· and O2. are capable of oxidizing the corresponding hydroxylamines. Our results agree with the observation reported for C-PTIO by Rosen et al. (16Rosen G.M. Porasuphatana S. Tsai P. Ambulos N.P. Galtsev V.E. Ichikawa K. Halpern H.J. Macromolecules. 2003; 36: 1021-1027Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar) A similar behavior has already been reported for other five-membered ring nitroxides (38Samuni A. Krishna C.M. Riesz P. Finkelstein E. Russo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17921-17924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Samuni A. Krishna C.M. Mitchell J.B. Collins C.R. Russo A. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1990; 9: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and is currently under investigation. The rate constants for the reaction of ·NO2 with PTIO and C-PTIO to form the corresponding oxoammonium cations and nitrite were determined to be (1.5 - 2) × 107m-1 s-1. These rate constants are more than an order of magnitude lower than those determined previously for piperidine and pyrrolidine derivatives of nitroxides (i.e. ∼7 × 108m-1 s-1) (23Goldstein S. Samuni A. Russo A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2003; 125: 836-8370Google Scholar) and similar to those for thiols at physiological pH (11Ford E. Hughes M.N. Wardman P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 1314-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). We have further shown that PTIO+s oxidize ·NO forming PTIOs and NO2· and that the rate constants for this reaction exceed by far those for the reaction of PTIOs with ·NO (i.e. k10 ∼30 k1 (Table I)). Therefore, the mechanism of the reaction of PTIOs with ·NO is described by Reactions 1, 8, 10, 12, and 13..NO+.NO2⇌N2O3k12=1.1×109M-1s-1,k-12=8.1×104s-1(40)N2O3+H2O→2NO2-+2H+k13=2×103s-1(41)Reactions12and13Reactions 12 and 13 Hence, the reaction of excess of PTIOs with ·NO forms solely PTIs and NO2- as previously observed (25Pfeiffer S. Leopold E. Hemmens B. Schmidt K. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, the stoichiometric ratio of [NO2-]/[PTI], which equals the ratio [·NO]/[PTI], varies between 1 and 2 depending on the steady-state concentrations of ·NO. Upon bolus addition of ·NO or high fluxes of ·NO, Reactions 12 and 13 can be ignored and the ratio approaches 2, whereas at relatively low fluxes Reaction 9 can be ignored and the ratio approaches 1. The variation of the stoichiometric ratio [NO2-]/[PTIs] between 1 and 2 with the experimental conditions may explain the differences among the results reported in the literature (12Akaike T. Yoshida M. Miyamoto Y. Sato K. Kohno M. Sasamoto K. Miyazaki K. Ueda S. Maeda H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 13Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. Hyde J.S.

Res. 1995; 22: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Consequently, quantitation of ·NO that is based on the yield of PTI is valid only at very low fluxes of ·NO. The present results explain why a large excess of ·NO2 had no effect on the EPR spectra and signal intensities of PTIOs (12Akaike T. Yoshida M. Miyamoto Y. Sato K. Kohno M. Sasamoto K. Miyazaki K. Ueda S. Maeda H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). These nitronyl nitroxides react rapidly with ·NO2 to form PTIO+s, which are reduced back to PTIOs by nitrite (Reaction 8) where the latter is being formed mainly via the self-decomposition of the large excess of ·NO2 in aqueous solutions (Reaction 9). Espey et al. (19Espey M.G. Miranda K.M. Thomas D.D. Wink D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30085-30091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) added 0.5 μm·NO to aerated solutions containing 1 μm DAF in the absence and presence of 5 μm PTIO. They measured the nitrosation yield of DAF and found that the nitrosation yield in the presence of PTIO is considerably higher than that in its absence. This led them to exclude the intermediacy of ·NO2 during autoxidation of ·NO in aqueous solution, which has been proposed by other studies (26Pires M. Rossi M.J. Ross D.S. Int. J. Chem. Kinet. 1994; 26: 1207-1227Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 27Lewis R.S. Deen W.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1994; 7: 568-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 28Goldstein S. Czapski G. J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 15720-15726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). However, under their experimental conditions, PTIO competes efficiently with DAF for ·NO2 and the resulting PTIO+ most probably rapidly oxidizes DAF to DAF·, which subsequently reacts readily with ·NO to form the nitrosation product (42Espey M.G. Thomas D.D. Miranda K.M. Wink D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11127-11132Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This process is more efficient than that occurring during autoxidation of ·NO, and therefore, the nitrosation yield in the presence of PTIO is considerably higher than that in its absence. Hence, Reaction 1 can be used as a stoichiometric source of ·NO2 only when the latter is not scavenged by the nitronyl nitroxide itself. Peroxynitrite ion is formed via the diffusion-limited reaction between ·NO and [O2.¯]0=1μM (43Huie R.E. Padmaja S. Free Radic. Res. Comm. 1993; 18: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (2028) Google Scholar, 44Goldstein S. Czapski G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 19: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), which is generally accepted as the main biological source of peroxynitrite. Because the rate constants for the reactions of ·NO and [O2.¯]0=1μM with PTIOs are ∼106-fold lower, even at millimolar levels, they cannot efficiently inhibit the formation of peroxynitrite under low fluxes of ·NO and O2.¯. The reaction of PTIOs with ·NO forms solely PTIs and NO2·, and the stoichiometric ratio of [NO2-]/[PTI] varies between 1 and 2 depending on the steady-state concentrations of ·NO. Consequently, quantitation of ·NO based on the yield of PTI is valid only at sufficiently low fluxes of ·NO. The reaction of PTIOs with ·NO forms initially ·NO2, which readily oxidizes PTIOs to PTIO+s. Hence, the reaction of PTIOs with ·NO can be used as a valid tool to form ·NO2 only when the latter is not scavenged by PTIOs themselves. The formation of peroxynitrite cannot be efficiently inhibited by PTIOs even under relatively low fluxes of ·NO and [O2.¯]0=1μM and millimolar levels of PTIOs."
https://openalex.org/W2086089999,"Integrin activation generates different signalings in a cell type-dependent manner and stimulates cell proliferation through the Ras/Raf-1/Mek/Erk pathway. In this study, we demonstrate that integrin stimulation by fibronectin (FN), besides activating the Ras/Erk pathway, generates an auxiliary calcium signal that activates calmodulin and the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). This signal regulates Raf-1 activation by Ras and modulates the FN-stimulated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk-1/2). The binding of soluble FN to integrins induced increase of intracellular calcium concentration associated with phosphorylation and activation of CaMKII. In two different cell lines, inhibition of CaMKII activity by specific inhibitors inhibited Erk-1/2 phosphorylation. Whereas CaMK inhibition affected neither integrin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation nor p21Ras or Mek-1 activity, it was necessary for Raf-1 activity. FN-induced Raf-1 activity was abrogated by the CaMKII specific inhibitory peptide ant-CaNtide. Integrin activation by FN induced the formation of a Raf-1/CaMKII complex, abrogated by inhibition of CaMKII. Active CaMKII phosphorylated Raf-1 in vitro. This is the first demonstration that CaMKII interplays with Raf-1 and regulates Erk activation induced by Ras-stimulated Raf-1. These findings also provide evidence supporting the possible existence of cross-talk between other intracellular pathways involving CaMKII and Raf-1. Integrin activation generates different signalings in a cell type-dependent manner and stimulates cell proliferation through the Ras/Raf-1/Mek/Erk pathway. In this study, we demonstrate that integrin stimulation by fibronectin (FN), besides activating the Ras/Erk pathway, generates an auxiliary calcium signal that activates calmodulin and the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). This signal regulates Raf-1 activation by Ras and modulates the FN-stimulated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk-1/2). The binding of soluble FN to integrins induced increase of intracellular calcium concentration associated with phosphorylation and activation of CaMKII. In two different cell lines, inhibition of CaMKII activity by specific inhibitors inhibited Erk-1/2 phosphorylation. Whereas CaMK inhibition affected neither integrin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation nor p21Ras or Mek-1 activity, it was necessary for Raf-1 activity. FN-induced Raf-1 activity was abrogated by the CaMKII specific inhibitory peptide ant-CaNtide. Integrin activation by FN induced the formation of a Raf-1/CaMKII complex, abrogated by inhibition of CaMKII. Active CaMKII phosphorylated Raf-1 in vitro. This is the first demonstration that CaMKII interplays with Raf-1 and regulates Erk activation induced by Ras-stimulated Raf-1. These findings also provide evidence supporting the possible existence of cross-talk between other intracellular pathways involving CaMKII and Raf-1.

We demonstrated previously that the ECM protein fibronectin (FN) controls both cell proliferation and survival in thyroid cells in primary cultures and in the immortalized human thyroid cell line TAD-2 (8Vitale M.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1642-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In TAD-2 cells, integrin activation by FN promotes the activation of p21Ras. Ras activates the serine-threonine kinase Raf-1, which in turn activates the extracellular signal-related kinase kinase (Mek) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/Erk). This pathway represents a prototypical model of the pathway initiated by cell adhesion that leads to cell proliferation (10Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P.

Integrin activation also induces phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) activation and accumulation of PI3-K products (phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate) (12King W.G.

Activation of PI3-K by integrins regulates phosphorylation of Raf-1 Ser 338 through the serine/threonine kinase Pak-1, providing a co-stimulatory signal that enhances Raf-1 activation by Ras and increases stimulation of cell growth by integrins (14Chaudhary A.

After integrin activation, increase of intracellular calcium concentration [Ca2+] i has been observed upon cell attachment to ECM or binding of anti-integrin antibodies to platelets, macrophages, neutrophils, osteoclasts, and embryonic stem cells (15Jaconi M.E.

Elevation of [Ca2+] i upon activation of α7β1 integrin in skeletal muscle cells results from both inositol triphosphate-evoked Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum and extracellular Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated, l-type plasma membrane Ca2+ channels (18Kwon M.S.

[Ca2+] i mediates important components of the integrin signaling pathway by controlling cell functions, such as migration in vascular smooth muscle cells, and phagocytosis and migration in macrophages (19Bilato C.

Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 889-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These Ca2+ signals are mediated by Ca2+/calmodulin protein kinase II (CaMKII), a ubiquitous serine/threonine protein kinase that is activated by Ca2+ and calmodulin (CaM) to phosphorylate diverse substrates involved in metabolism, neurotransmitter release and cell cycle control. Emerging data on potential connections between Ca2+ signaling and the MAPK pathway in multiple cell systems lead us to explore possible cross-talk between these two signal pathways upon integrin activation. Indeed, it has recently been reported that pharmacological inhibition of CaM decreased epidermal growth factor-induced MAPK activity by interfering with Raf-1 (21Tebar F. Llado A. Enrich C. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In PC-12 cells, calcium and CaM were both necessary for the activation of Erk after epidermal growth factor receptor stimulation and TrkA stimulation by nerve growth factor. The same report suggested that CaM might regulate the full activation of Raf-1 after Ras activation (22Egea J. Espinet C. Soler R.M. Peiro S. Rocamora N. Comella J.X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1931-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In hippocampal neurons, activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate-type glutamate receptors induces CaMKII phosphorylation that inhibits the Ras GTPase activating protein (p135 Syn-GAP) (23Chen H.J. Rojas-Soto M. Oguni A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1998; 20: 895-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Therefore, Syn-GAP represents another potential intersection point between the Ca2+ signaling and the MAPK pathway. Our data demonstrate that integrin stimulation by FN, besides activating the Ras/Raf/Mek/Erk pathway, also generates a Ca2+/CaMK signal that modulates the Ras/Erk pathway through the regulation of Raf-1 activity. Cell Culture—Thyroid TAD-2 cells and the hepatoma cell line Hep3B were cultured in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (4.5 g of glucose) and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). When needed, the cells were serum-starved in 0.5% BSA-Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 12–18 h before stimulation. To obtain FN or BSA coating, cell culture plates were filled with the appropriate FN (Collaborative Research, Bedford, MA) or BSA (Sigma) dilution in PBS, incubated overnight at 4 °C and washed with PBS. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis and Antibodies— For immunoprecipitation, the cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycolate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm NaF, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Rabbit polyclonal antibody reactive to all CaMKII isoforms (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), Raf-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and protein G plus/protein A agarose beads (Oncogene Science, Boston, MA) were used to immunoprecipitate CaMKII or Raf-1 from 1 mg of total lysate. Non-immune rabbit IgG were also used as a control. For Western blot analysis, the cells were lysed in Laemmli buffer (125 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 5% glycerol, 2% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.006% bromphenol blue), and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Immobilon P; Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked by 5% nonfat dry milk, 1% ovalbumin, 5% FCS, and 7.5% glycine; washed and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with primary antibodies; and washed and incubated for 1 h with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Then, protein bands were detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Computer-acquired images were quantified using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Mouse monoclonal antibodies to p42 MAPK, phospho-p44/p42 MAPK, Akt, and phospho-threonine-308-Akt were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Polyclonal anti-phospho-CaMKII antibody (pT286) was from (Promega, Madison, WI). p21Ras Activity Assay—Ras activity was assayed by affinity precipitation using a Ras activation assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology). Briefly, 4 × 106 cells were lysed with Mg2+ lysis buffer (125 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 750 mm NaCl, 5% Igepal CA630, 50 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol) and incubated with 5 μl of a 50% slurry of Raf-1 Ras binding domain peptide for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were then boiled in reducing sample buffer, and adsorbed proteins were resolved by electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with a monoclonal anti-Ras (1 μg/ml) (Mg2+ lysis buffer, Raf-1 Ras binding domain peptide, and anti-Ras were included in a Ras activation assay kit; Upstate Biotechnology). Proteins were visualized using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence. CaMKII Activity Assay and Inhibitors—The cells were lysed in 200 μl of RSB buffer (24Colomer J.M. Means A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1125-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) with 10 mm CHAPS and 20 μl of the extracts were assayed in 50 μl of reaction mixture consisting of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0,5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μm CaM, 100 nm microcystin, 50 μm ATP (1500 cpm/pmol [γ-32P]ATP), and 0.1 mm substrate peptide Autocamtide II. Total CaMK activity was determined by including 1 mm CaCl2 in the mixture, whereas autonomous activity was measured in the presence of 2.5 mm EGTA. Ionomycin (Sigma) at a concentration of 500 ng/ml was used as a positive control for CaMKII activation. The reaction was carried out for 2 min at 30 °C, and 20-μl aliquots of the reaction mixture were spotted onto p81 phosphocellulose filters (Up-state Biothechnology) as described previously (25Cruzalegui F.H. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26171-26178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified CaM and Autocamtide II were a kind gift from Dr. A. R. Means (Durham, NC). The CaMK inhibitor KN93 and the CaM inhibitors trifluoperazine (TFP) and N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-nafthalene-sulfonamide (W7) were purchased from Sigma. The CaMKII specific inhibitor ant-CaNtide is derived from the endogenous CaMKII inhibitor protein CaMKIIN (26Chang B.H. Mukherji S. Soderling T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10890-10895Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and was made cell-permeable by N-terminal addition of an Antennapedia-derived sequence (ant-CaNtide: RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKKRPPKLGQIGRSKRVVIEDDRIDDVLK). The reversed ant-CaNtide peptide was also used as a control. Calcium Measurements—A total of 3 × 105 cells harvested by trypsin were loaded with cell-permeant Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), by incubating the cells with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10 μm Fura-2, 0.5% BSA, and 10 mm HEPES for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were then washed twice for 10 min with 1 mm CaCl2 in Hanks' balanced salt solution (118 mm NaCl, 4.6 mm KCl, 10 mm glucose, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2). When indicated, cells were incubated with integrin-FNH-binding RGD-containing peptides (Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro) or control peptides (RGE-containing, Gly-Arg-Gly-Glu-Ser-Pro) (Calbiochem). Fluorescence was measured with a fluorimeter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Excitation was at 345 and 380 nm, emission was at 510 nm. Rmin and Rmax were obtained by adding 10 mm EDTA and 2% Triton X-100 or 10 mm EDTA, 2% Triton X-100, and 10 mm CaCl2, respectively. The nanomolar concentration of Ca2+ was obtained by the Grynkiewiez formula considering a 225 Kd for Fura-2 (27Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Raf-1, Pak, and Mek-1 Activity Assay—Raf-1 activity was evaluated by a Raf-1 immunoprecipitation-kinase cascade assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology). Briefly, Raf-1 was immunoprecipitated from 1 mg of cell extracts. The immunocomplexes were washed and incubated in the presence of magnesium/ATP, inactivated Mek-1, and Erk-2 for 30 min at 30 °C. An aliquot of the mixture was then incubated with 20 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was quenched with Laemmli buffer, and proteins were separated through a 10% polyacrylamide/tris glycine gel. Radioactive-phosphorylated MBP on dried gels was quantified with the use of a Phosphor-Imager (Amersham Biosciences). Pak activity was determined as follows. Pak was immunoprecipitated by specific antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunocomplexes were washed and incubated for 20 min at 30 °C in 20 mm HEPES, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 μg of MBP in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The proteins were separated through a 10% polyacrylamide/tris glycine gel, and radioactive-phosphorylated MBP was quantified by PhosphorImager. To measure Mek-1 activity, Mek-1 was immunoprecipitated by specific antibodies and incubated with purified Erk-2. Erk-2 phosphorylation was evaluated by Western blot with mouse monoclonal antibodies to phospho-p44/p42 MAPK. All antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Statistical Analysis—Student t test was performed as appropriate. analysis of variance with post hoc correction according to Bonferroni was performed on multiple comparison. Integrin Activation by Soluble FN Induced [Ca2 + ]i Increase and CaMKII Activation—Activation of CaMK requires binding of Ca2+/CaM and thus a rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+] i). To determine whether integrin activation by FN can produce such a Ca2+ signal, [Ca2+] i was measured by fluorimetric analysis in TAD-2 cells in suspension in response to soluble FN binding (Fig. 1A). Cells were incubated with soluble FN in the presence of peptides inhibiting the integrin-FN binding (RGD) or in the presence of control peptides (RGE). [Ca2+] i remained unchanged for 30 min and then slightly increased in untreated cells. After 30 min of suspension, FN + binding inhibitor or control peptides were added to the cells. In the cells treated with FN + control peptide, [Ca2+] i began to increase after a few minutes and continued to rise for the duration of the assay, reaching a 7.5-fold increase by 60 min. The FN receptor antagonist peptide added at 500 μg/ml completely inhibited the [Ca2+] i increase. Antagonist peptide alone did not produce any effect on [Ca2+] i (data not shown). To determine whether the FN-induced [Ca2+] i increase can activate CaMK enzymatic activity, we evaluated the T286/287phosphorylation level of CaMKII, a CaMK highly expressed in brain but present in every mammalian cell type examined (Fig. 1B). Phospho-T286/287-CaMKII is generated by auto-phosphorylation and thus can be used as a reporter for CaMKII's history of activation within cells. Serum-starved cells were plated onto FN or BSA, and CaMKII phosphorylation was evaluated by Western blot. Although at 15 min only a slight difference between BSA and FN was made visible with the use of an anti-phosphothreonine CaMKII antibody, by 30 min, increased phosphorylation was clearly evident in the FN-stimulated cell lysates. Activation of CaMKs by cell attachment to FN was confirmed by in vitro kinase assay using Autocamtide II as substrate (Fig. 1C). The cells were stimulated with immobilized FN or treated with ionomycin, a powerful ionophore that induces a rapid [Ca2+] i increase. FN induced a 2.8-fold increase of CaMK activity, a magnitude comparable with that induced by ionomycin. These results clearly demonstrate that FN can induce an intracellular Ca2+ signal sufficient for activation of CaMK. Inhibition of CaMKII Activity Inhibits FN-induced Erk Phosphorylation—Our initial data indicated that Ras/Erk and Ca2+/CaMK signalings are both generated by FN-activated integrins. To investigate where the two pathways converge, we first tested the effects of CaMK inhibitors on the phosphorylation of Erk, the immediate downstream target of Mek. In this analysis, we used one CaMK inhibitor (KN93) and two CaM inhibitors (W7 and TFP); CaM is needed as the Ca2+ sensor for CaMK activation. TAD-2 cells were plated onto immobilized FN with different concentrations of KN93, W7, or TFP, and the level of Erk-1/2 phosphorylation was evaluated by Western blot (Fig. 2). Both 10% FCS and FN induced a comparable increase of Erk-1/2 phosphorylation. KN93 was inhibitory at 0.5 μm and completely abolished FN-induced Erk-1/2 phosphorylation at 5 μm. In addition, W7 and TFP displayed dose-dependent inhibitory effects. To determine whether within CaMK the isoform II is required for FN-stimulated Erk phosphorylation, the experiments were reproduced with the specific inhibitor ant-CaNtide. This short peptide is derived from the endogenous CaMKII inhibitor-protein CaMKIIN and was made cell permeable by the Antennapedia N-terminal sequence. Ant-CaNtide inhibited FN-induced Erk-1/2 phosphorylation at a 5 μm concentration. The ant-CaNtide reversed peptide displayed no inhibitory effect. Together, these data demonstrate that Erk phosphorylation is dependent on CaMKII activation. Thus, CaMK- and MAPK-pathways are simultaneously required for FN-stimulated cell proliferation and seem to converge upstream of Mek. FN-independent CaMKII Activity Is Necessary for Erk phosphorylation Induced by FN in Hep3B Cells—To determine whether the role played by CaMK in the regulation of the MAPK-pathway and in the control of FN/integrin-dependent cell growth is restricted to the thyroid TAD-2 cells or is a more general phenomenon, we analyzed the effect of FN on Erk- and CaMKII-activity in an additional cell line. Erk-1/2 phosphorylation was evaluated by Western blot in Hep3B cells plated onto FN or BSA in absence of serum or in uncoated plates with 10% FCS (Fig. 3A). As in TAD-2 cells, FN and FCS alone stimulated Erk-1/2 phosphorylation, inducing a 3-fold increase. Then, the effect of integrin-stimulation on CaMKII activation was determined in cells stimulated by FN and FCS. CaMKII phosphorylation at T286/287 was determined by Western blot (Fig. 3B). Activated CaMKII was clearly detected in both FN- and FCS-stimulated cells. However, essentially the same level of activated kinase was seen without such stimulation under the basal conditions used in our experiments. To test whether CaMKII activity is necessary for Erk phosphorylation in Hep3B, the cells were plated onto FN with or without KN93, W7, TFP, ant-CaNtide, or R-ant-CaNtide, and the level of Erk-1/2 phosphorylation was evaluated by Western blot (Fig. 4). FN-stimulated Erk phosphorylation was inhibited by the CaMK inhibitor KN93, the CaMKII inhibitor ant-CaNtide, or the CaM inhibitors TFP and W7 in Hep3B, as it was in TAD-2 cells. These results demonstrate that in Hep3B cells, as in TAD-2 cells, CaMKII modulates the signaling pathway generated by integrins; here, however, integrin activation is not required for CaMKII activation. They also demonstrate that CaMKII activity is required but not sufficient for Erk activation in both Hep2B and in TAD-2 cells. CaMK Does Affect Akt Phosphorylation—Besides Ras/Erk pathway activation, Akt/protein kinase B is phosphorylated by PI3-K after integrin activation. To determine whether inhibition of CaMK modulates this pathway, TAD-2 cells were stimulated with FN in the presence of KN. Akt phosphorylation in threonine-308 was not affected by the presence of the CaMK inhibitor (Fig. 5A). Modulation of the FN-dependent Erk Activation by CaMK Occurs Downstream of p21Ras—Our results showed that CaMK activity is required for the FN-induced Erk-pathway in two different cell types. Thus, we next examined whether CaMK was required for p21Ras activation by integrins. The activity of p21Ras was determined in extracts from TAD-2 cells stimulated by FN with or without KN93 (5 μm), W7 (30 μm), and TFP (0.1 μm). Cell extracts were incubated with Raf-1 Ras binding domain peptide-conjugated agarose beads to allow the binding to activated Ras, and adsorbed active-p21Ras was recovered and visualized by Western blot (Fig. 6B). Both FCS and integrin engagement activated p21Ras. The CaMK inhibitor KN93 and the CaM inhibitors W7 and TFP were ineffective on the induction of Ras activation by FN, demonstrating that the CaMK involvement in the integrin-Ras-Erk pathway occurs downstream of Ras. CaMKII Regulates FN-dependent Raf-1 Activation—If the CaMK and MAPK pathways converge upstream of Erk and downstream of Ras, this leaves Raf-1 and Mek as possible targets for CaMK regulation. We next examined whether CaMKII was required for FN-induced activation of Raf-1 in both TAD-2 and Hep3B cells (Fig. 6). Raf-1 activity was measured by a Raf-1 inositol phosphate kinase cascade assay in lysates from cells plated on BSA or FN alone or in the presence of KN93 or ant-CaNtide. FN stimulation induced a 4-fold increase Raf-1 activity, an effect completely inhibited by the treatment with KN93 or ant-CaNtide, demonstrating that FN/integrin-dependent Raf-1 activation requires CaMKII activity. To exclude Mek phosphorylation or a direct MBP phosphorylation by co-immunoprecipitated CaMKII, Mek was omitted in the assay mix, together with MBP and [γ32P]ATP in parallel reaction tubes. In the absence of Mek, MBP was not phosphorylated, and the CaMKII inhibitor did not reduce MBP phosphorylation by FN-stimulated cell extracts (data not shown). CaMK Inhibitors Have No Direct Effect on Raf-1, Pak, and Mek—Control experiments were performed to exclude a direct effect of CaMK inhibitors on Raf-1, Pak, and Mek. Raf-1, Pak, and Mek-1 were immunoprecipitated by specific antibodies from FN-stimulated cells. Inhibitors [γ-32P]ATP and MBP were included in the assay mix, together with immunoprecipitated Pak (Fig. 7A) or with Raf-1 in the Raf-1 inositol phosphate kinase cascade assay (Fig. 7B). The ability of immunoprecipitated Mek-1 to phosphorylate Erk-2 in the presence of CaMK inhibitors was evaluated by Western blot (Fig. 7C). Results show that CaMK inhibitors have no direct effect on Raf-1, Pak, and Mek-1. FN Promotes Raf-1/CaMKII Association—Kinase-to-target interaction generates protein complexes that, when sufficiently stable, can be co-precipitated. To assess whether CaMKII might be associated with Raf-1 in a protein complex, CaMKII was immunoprecipitated in extracts from cells plated on BSA or FN. Immunoprecipitated CaMKII and co-precipitated Raf-1 were detected by Western blot by specific antibodies (Fig. 8). In the absence of FN stimulation, co-immunoprecipitation of CaMKII and Raf-1 was not visible in TAD-2 cells, whereas it was clearly evident in Hep3B cells. In both cell lines, Raf-1 and CaMKII were co-immunoprecipitated after adhesion to FN. The CaMKII inhibitor KN93 inhibited both the constitutive and the FN-induced Raf-1/CaMKII association. These results suggest that CaMKII, either activated constitutively or activated by integrins, participates in the formation of a protein complex with Raf-1, directly or indirectly. Raf-1 Is Phosphorylated by CaMKII in Vitro—To determine whether CaMKII can phosphorylate Raf-1, the latter was immunoprecipitated from non-integrin-activated TAD-2 cells and incubated in vitro with active purified CaMKII and [γ-32P]ATP. KN93 or ant-CaNtide were added in the mix, and phosphorylated Raf-1 was resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography (Fig. 9). Raf-1 was phosphorylated by active CaMKII and ant-CaNtide inhibited Raf-1 phosphorylation, whereas KN93 was ineffective. Ant-CaNtide binds the substrate-binding site of CaMKII blocking the active enzyme. KN93 binds the CaMKII auto-phosphorylation binding site required for CaMKII activation; hence, it is ineffective on already active CaMKII. These data demonstrate that CaMKII can phosphorylate Raf-1 in vitro. Our results demonstrate that activation of the integrin receptors by FN binding stimulates the Ras/Erk pathway and that this pathway is controlled by CaMKII-mediated Ca2+ signaling through the regulation of Raf-1 activity (Fig. 10). We demonstrated previously that FN binding to integrins induces FAK and Paxillin phosphorylation with the formation of the FAK/Grb-2/Sos complex in the thyroid cell line TAD-2. This pathway mediates the integrin-dependent cell growth as inhibition of Ras or Mek blocks FN-induced proliferation (13Illario M. Amideo V. Casamassima A. Andreucci M. Di Matola T. Miele C. Rossi G. Fenzi G. Vitale M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 88: 260-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Several studies suggested the existence of a connection between Ca2+ signaling and MAPK pathway at multiple steps and with possible divergent final effects. Both these signals can be generated simultaneously by integrin activation in some cell types. Therefore, we decided to investigate whether Ca2+ signaling and the Ras/Erk pathway interact and together regulate ECM-stimulated cell growth. To determine whether a Ca2+ signaling is generated by integrin activation in this cell line, we measured [Ca2+] i upon soluble FN binding. Although [Ca2+] i increase is fast and transient upon most hormone-receptor binding, in our experiments, [Ca2+] i increase was delayed, slow, and long-lasting. These results are in agreement with the data obtained in umbilical vein cells (16Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1003-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Integrins do not have intrinsic kinase activity, and ECM binding leads to their clustering into the focal adhesions. The progressive recruitment of integrins into the focal adhesions by FN leads to the progressive activation of kinases and generates unsynchronized signals that produce a delayed slow [Ca2+] i wave. The biological effects of the integrin-induced [Ca2+] i changes depends upon the cell type and include cell spreading in endothelial cells, modulation of response to inflammatory mediators in neutrophils, spreading and morphological changes in platelets, but no effects on cell growth have been reported so far (16Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1003-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 28Borgquist J.D. Quinn M.T. Swain S.D. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2002; 71: 764-774PubMed Google Scholar, 29Heemskerk J.W. Vuist W.M. Feijge M.A. Reutelingsperger C.P. Lindhout T. Blood. 1997; 90: 2615-2625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Changes in [Ca2+] i are sensed by CaM, a ubiquitous Ca2+ binding protein that binds to and regulates target enzymes such as CaMK. In our study, CaMKII was activated upon FN-integrin binding in TAD-2 cells, whereas in Hep3B cells, CaMKII seemed to be phosphorylated in basal conditions, and FN failed to increase its phosphorylation. The events that determined the basal CaMKII phosphorylation in Hep3B cells were not investigated in this study. However, we observed in primary cultures of normal and tumor thyroid cells that activation of CaMKII requires integrin engagement only in normal cells. 2M. Illario, A. L. Cavallo, and M. Vitale, unpublished observations. Activating mutations of CaMKII have not been described thus far, and the presence of constitutive up-stream activating signals is a possible explanation for the high basal CaMKII phosphorylation in tumor cells. However, active CaMKII alone is not sufficient to induce Erk-1/2 activation, as indicated by the observation that Erk-1/2 results in phosphorylation only upon integrin activation in Hep3B cells. In both TAD-2 and Hep3B cells, inhibition of CaMKII activity by the broad CaMK enzymatic inhibitor KN93, the CaM inhibitors W7 and TFP, and the cell-permeant, CaMKII-specific inhibitory peptide ant-CaNtide demonstrated that CaMKII enzymatic activity is required for Erk-1/2 phosphorylation induced by FN-integrin binding. A role for a Ca2+/CaM-dependent pathway in the activation of Erk-1/2 has been described in a number of studies. Calcium and CaM are both necessary for Erk-1/2 stimulation by thapsigargin in foreskin fibroblasts, for the short-term activation of Erk after nerve growth factor stimulation in PC-12 cells; recently, it has been reported that CaM regulates at multiple steps the activation of Erk by stimulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor, whereas studies that demonstrate CaMKII requirement for Erk activity are lacking (21Tebar F. Llado A. Enrich C. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 22Egea J. Espinet C. Soler R.M. Peiro S. Rocamora N. Comella J.X. Mol. Cell.

In a different cell system, inhibition of CaM synergizes with different stimuli to induce protein kinase C-dependent Erk activation (31Villalonga P. López-Alcalá C. Chiloeches A. Gil J. Marais R.

In Swiss 3T3 cells, CaM binds the GTP-bound K-RasB isoform and down-modulates Erk phosphorylation induced by epidermal growth factor, bombesin, platelet-derived growth factor, and serum. Together, these data demonstrate that modulation of Ras/Erk signaling by Ca2+/CaM signal depends on the balance between divergent effects in a defined cell context. In our study, the effect of the CaMKII-specific inhibitor ant-CaNtide demonstrated the pivotal role of CaMKII in the regulation of integrin-dependent Erk-1/2 activation. A link between integrins and CaMKII in the regulation of cell motility and spreading has been documented in some cell types (20Blystone S.D. Slater S.E. Williams M.P. Crow M.T. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 889-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 33Bouvard D. Block M.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, evidence that cell proliferation induced by ECM-activated integrins requires the activation of the Ca2+/CaMK pathway has not yet been produced. In our study, integrin activation induced CaMKII phosphorylation and its association with Raf-1 in thyroid cells. In Hep3B cells, where CaMKII phosphorylation did not require FN stimulation, CaMKII and Raf-1 were already associated in unstimulated conditions. In both cell types, CaMK inhibitors prevented CaMKII/Raf-1 association and inhibited Raf-1 activity. Although a direct Raf-1 phosphorylation by CaMKII has not yet been described, the existence of seven canonical R/KXXS/T consensus sequence for CaMKII makes Raf-1 phosphorylation by CaMKII a possibility worthy of consideration (34Yang S.D. Huang T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29855-29859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, our in vitro experiments demonstrate that Raf-1 can be phosphorylated by CaMKII. Although this does not demonstrate that Raf-1 is a CaMKII substrate in vivo, it supports this possibility. Raf-1 is a substrate of several kinases (Src, protein kinase C, protein kinase A, and Akt) that, together with Ras, provide co-stimulatory signals that lead to Erk activation in response to several receptor signals (35Morrison D.K. Cutler R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Activation of PKC contributes to Raf/Erk-1/2 activation in response to cyclic pressure-induced strain in endothelial cells (36Cheng J.J. Wung B.S. Chao Y.J. Wang D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31368-31375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Ras-mediated activation of Erk-1/2, either by insulin, insulin like-growth factor I, interleukin-8 and -2, platelet-derived growth factor, vasopressin, T cell receptor, and adrenergic receptors is increased by Raf-1 co-activation by PI3-K (37Cowen D.S.

Although a direct effect of CaM on Raf-1 activity has been proposed in response to epidermal growth factor receptor activation, a direct CaMKII/Raf-1 interaction has not yet been described (21Tebar F. Llado A. Enrich C. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 22Egea J. Espinet C. Soler R.M. Peiro S. Rocamora N. Comella J.X. Mol. Cell.

Our results demonstrate for the first time that Raf-1 is a target of CaMKII in the pathway that regulates activation of Erk-1/2 downstream of integrin receptors. Based on available evidence, we suggest that integrins activate the Ras/Erk pathway, but this is modulated by the interplay of a Ca2+/CaMKII signaling pathway. The evidence of co-stimulatory signals generated by integrins has already been provided. Severe attenuation of integrin-dependent Erk-1/2 activation by PI3-K inhibition was demonstrated in COS-7 cells (12King W.G. Mattaliano M.D. Chan T.O. Tsichlis P.N. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4406-4418Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). After integrin-FN binding, PI3-K is activated and regulates the phosphorylation of Raf-1 Ser338 through the serine/threonine kinase Pak, participating in the ensuing Erk activation (14Chaudhary A. King W.G. Mattaliano M.D. Frost J.A. Diaz B. Morrison D.K. Cobb M.H. Marshall M.S. Brugge J.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 551-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In conclusion, our data demonstrate that: 1) CaMKII is activated after integrin engagement; 2) CaMKII regulates Ras-stimulated Raf-1 activity leading to Erk-1/2 activation in the integrin pathway; and 3) CaMKII is necessary for ECM-stimulated Erk activation. The control of Raf-1 activity by CaMKII might not be restricted to integrin signaling but could play a more general and pivotal role in the cross-talk between intracellular signaling pathways. It will be of considerable interest to investigate the role of Ca2+ and CaMKII in other signaling pathways that comprise Raf-1 as a pivotal factor. We thank A. R.

We have examined the ability of ER stress to modulate leukocyte binding to colonic and aortic smooth muscle cells. In vitro, control smooth muscle cells bind few leukocytes, but treatment with compounds that induce ER stress, including tunicamycin, A23187, and thapsigargin, promotes leukocyte binding. Likewise, dextran sulfate, another agent capable of inducing ER stress and promoting inflammation in vivo, strongly induces leukocyte adhesion. The bound leukocytes are released by hyaluronidase treatment, indicating a critical role for hyaluronan-containing structures in mediating leukocyte binding. Affinity histochemistry demonstrated that hyaluronan accumulates and is present in cable-like structures in the treated, but not the untreated, cultures and that these structures serve as attachment sites for leukocytes. Hyaluronan-rich regions of both murine and human inflamed colon contain numerous cells that stain intensely for ER-resident chaperones containing the KDEL sequence, demonstrating a relationship between ER stress and hyaluronan deposition in vivo.

The pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, atherosclerosis, and asthma is not well understood. During the immune response, leukocytes infiltrate and remain resident within the affected tissue, many in close proximity to smooth muscle cells (SMCs). 1The abbreviations used are: SMCsmooth muscle cellERendoplasmic reticulumHAhyaluronanIαIinter-α-trypsin inhibitorFBSfetal bovine serumPBSphosphate-buffered saline. Once the leukocytes leave the vasculature and enter the inflamed tissue, they encounter a myriad of extracellular matrix and cell surface components. However, it is not clear with which components the leukocytes interact nor what regulates leukocyte migration and adhesion within the inflamed tissue (1de Fougerolles A.R. Chi-Rosso G. Bajardi A.

Hyaluronan (HA) is a linear glycosaminoglycan composed of alternating units of β1,3-d-glucuronic acid and β1,4-N-acetyld-glucosamine (4Fraser J.R. Laurent T.C. Laurent U.B. J. Intern. Med. 1997; 242: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar). A family of hyaluronan synthase enzymes (Has-1, Has-2, and Has-3) (5Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13997-14000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) catalyze the formation of HA at the cell surface, and during synthesis, the nascent chain is extruded into the extracellular space. HA can associate with other extracellular matrix components and become incorporated into the matrix via high affinity interactions (4Fraser J.R. Laurent T.C. Laurent U.B. J. Intern. Med. 1997; 242: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar), or it can remain associated with the cell surface via several receptors, including specific forms of CD44 (4Fraser J.R. Laurent T.C. Laurent U.B. J. Intern. Med. 1997; 242: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar). HA has several functions relative to inflammation, and the interactions of leukocytes with HA may be involved in their capture and retention within areas of inflammation. Hyaluronan accumulates in the extracellular matrix and in serum in many inflammatory states, and often the serum level correlates with the degree of inflammation (6Gerdin B. Hallgren R. J. Intern.

The interactions of leukocytes with HA produced by SMCs may be important for modulating and perpetuating the inflammatory response; however, little is known about what factors regulate SMC production of the leukocyte-binding structures of HA. Identification of mediators that contribute to the production of HA as well as factors that can inhibit its accumulation may lead to the development of novel therapeutic targets and improved therapies for patients with chronic inflammatory conditions. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a dynamic membranous organelle with diverse functions including 1) protein synthesis, modification, folding, and subunit assembly; 2) steroid synthesis; 3) lipid synthesis; 4) glycogen production; 5) sequestration of calcium; and 6) maintenance of calcium homeostasis. Many infectious agents, environmental toxins, and adverse metabolic conditions interfere with ER function and homeostasis, thereby inducing ER stress (15Aridor M. Balch W.E. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 745-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 16Kaufman R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1389-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar, 17Pahl H.L. Physiol.

Invest. 2001; 107: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that perturbations in ER function that result in ER stress influence the development of dextran sulfate-induced colitis. Knockout mice deficient in IRE1β, a protein that senses and responds to ER stress, are particularly sensitive to the induction of colitis. IRE1β-deficient mice treated with dextran sulfate developed more severe colitis that occurred several days earlier than in their wild type counterparts (20Bertolotti A. Wang X. Novoa I. Jungreis R. Schlessinger K. Cho J.H. West A.B. Ron D. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the IRE1β gene is located in a region of chromosome 16 known to contain gene(s) that modulate susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease, the IBD1 locus (20Bertolotti A. Wang X. Novoa I. Jungreis R. Schlessinger K. Cho J.H. West A.B. Ron D. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). How ER stress is linked to immune dysregulation is not known, but ER stress probably induces the expression of specific genes or activates particular enzymes that promote inflammation. In the current investigation, we demonstrate that agents that induce ER stress within SMCs promote HA deposition and leukocyte adhesion to HA-containing structures. This demonstrates a novel alteration of the composition and function of the extracellular matrix as a consequence of ER stress.

All tissue was collected in accordance with an institutional review board-approved protocol from the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. Cell Isolation and Culture—Human mucosal SMCs were obtained enzymatically from resected colon as described (13de la Motte C.A. Hascall V.C. Calabro A. Yen-Lieberman B. Strong S.A. J. Biol.

Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/Ham's F-12 medium with HEPES (Invitrogen), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Bio-Whitaker, Walkersville, MD), and an antibiotic/antimycotic mixture (Invitrogen). U937 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% FBS and the antibiotic/antimycotic mixture. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in 95% air and 5% CO2. Leukocyte Adhesion—The quantification of leukocyte adhesion to SMCs was done as described (13de la Motte C.A. Hascall V.C. Calabro A. Yen-Lieberman B. Strong S.A. J. Biol.

Briefly, SMCs were grown to confluence in 24-well plates and then treated with the appropriate test compounds for 23 h prior to the assay unless stated otherwise. U937 cells or freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (13de la Motte C.A. Hascall V.C. Calabro A. Yen-Lieberman B. Strong S.A. J. Biol.

The radiolabeled cells were then washed extensively with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/Ham's F-12 medium containing 3% FBS and resuspended at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/Ham's F-12 medium with HEPES and 10% FBS. The leukocytes were added to the SMCs (106/well) and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Nonadherent leukocytes were removed by washing the wells with cold medium containing 3% FBS. Adhesion was quantified by solubilizing the cells with 1.0 n NaOH and counting the radioactivity of an aliquot in a γ-counter. In a typical experiment, 10–40% of the added U937 cells adhere to treated cultures (100,000–400,000 cells/well). The proportion of cells bound to HA was quantitated by treating some wells with 200 μg/ml bovine testicular hyaluronidase type IV-S for 3–5 min prior to the final wash. In some experiments, the binding of leukocytes to HA was blocked by pretreating the SMC monolayer with 200 μg/ml hyaluronidase with or without a mixture of protease inhibitors (P1860; Sigma) prior to the assay. In other experiments, the binding of leukocytes to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 was prevented by pretreatment of the SMCs with a blocking antibody (10 μg/ml) (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 45 min at 4 °C prior to the addition of leukocytes. The CD44 expressed on the U937 cells employed in these studies was found to be in the low binding form as assessed by its inability to bind to high molecular weight HA. 2J. Lesley, personal communication. Affinity Histochemistry and Immunocytochemistry—SMCs were grown on glass coverslips, and, at the time of harvest, they were fixed with methanol at -20 °C and air-dried. Specimens were rehydrated in Hanks' buffer, and nonspecific binding was blocked with Hanks' buffer containing either 2% FBS or 4% bovine serum albumin. Samples were then incubated with the recommended dilution of primary antibody and with 5 μg/ml biotinylated HA-binding protein (Seikagaku America) in Hanks' buffer containing the blocking reagent. After extensive washing with Hanks' buffer containing the blocking reagent, 2 μg/ml fluoresceinated avidin (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) and diluted secondary antibody (Alexa 568-conjugated goat antimouse IgG or 633-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG) (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) were added. The samples were then extensively washed and mounted with mounting medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) to counterstain the nuclei. Samples were examined with a confocal microscope equipped for fluorescence. The primary antibodies and the HA-binding protein were omitted in assays serving as negative controls. For tissue sections, tissue was fixed in Histochoice (Amresco, Solon, OH), embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and deparaffinized. The sections were then stained and examined as described for the cultured cells. Analysis of Cell Death—Following the various experimental treatments, replicate cultures were examined for their capacity to exclude trypan blue. Briefly, the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), trypan blue was added momentarily, the cultures were then rinsed again with PBS, and the number of trypan blue positive cells per low power field was determined. None of the treatments employed significantly increased trypan blue staining. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling analysis was employed to quantify apoptosis. Confluent cells were treated with test compounds and then trypsinized. The cells were rinsed in PBS, fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 4 °C, rinsed again in PBS, resuspended in 70% ethanol, and then end-labeled. Apoptotic cells were detected by flow cytometry. Dextran Sulfate-treated Mice—10–11-month-old FVB mice were employed in these studies, and all protocols were approved by the Cleveland Clinic Foundation IACUC. Dextran sulfate (sodium salt, average molecular mass 10,000 daltons; Sigma) was administered orally by adding it to the drinking water at a final concentration of 5%. After 3 days, mice were sacrificed, and their colons were removed, fixed in Histochoice, and embedded in paraffin. Statistics—p values were calculated with Quattro Pro for Windows using a two-tailed Student's t test. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. ER Stress Induces HA-mediated Leukocyte Adhesion in Vitro—The effect of ER stress on colonic SMCs was examined by treatment for 23 h at 37 °C with or without tunicamycin, a well established inducer of ER stress (17Pahl H.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 683-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 19Lee A.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 504-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar, 23Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1934) Google Scholar). The SMC cultures were then incubated with radiolabeled U937 cells (a monocytic, leukemic cell line) for 1 h at 4 °C to allow attachment. Untreated, control SMCs bound few monocytes, but tunicamycin treatment dramatically induced leukocyte adhesion (Fig. 1A) with 5 μg/ml tunicamycin, resulting in optimal binding (2.8 × 105 leukocytes/well). The majority of bound leukocytes were removed with hyaluronidase treatment (Fig. 1A), demonstrating that HA has an active role in mediating the attachment. Likewise, pretreatment of the SMCs with hyaluronidase prior to the addition of leukocytes prevented their attachment (Fig. 1A). The hyaluronidase digestions were equally effective when the hyaluronidase was preincubated for 10 min with a mixture of protease inhibitors (aprotinin, bestatin, leupeptin, E-64, and pepstatin A), indicating that any contaminating proteases were not responsible for the observed effects. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells also bound to tunicamycin-treated SMCs in the same HA-dependent manner (not shown). Immunohistochemical staining of the control and tunicamycin-treated cells demonstrated that tunicamycin did indeed induce ER stress, as evident by the intense intracellular staining for ER proteins containing the KDEL retention sequence (Fig. 1B). Tunicamycin also stimulated the deposition of large amounts of HA, and numerous thick HA cables were observed (Fig. 1B). Many small strands originating from cellular coats of HA coalesced into these larger diameter cables. Some but not all of the cables also stained positive for the hyaladherins versican and inter-α-trypsin inhibitor (IαI) (Fig. 1C). Transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assays demonstrated that the tunicamycin treatment did not induce apoptosis under the conditions employed (1.4% of cells were apoptotic as compared with 1.5% of untreated, control cells). Together, these results demonstrate that tunicamycin treatment of SMCs promotes ER stress, the deposition of HA, and leukocyte adhesion by a mechanism involving HA. Disturbances in calcium homeostasis also induce ER stress. A23187, a calcium ionophore, and thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase type 2, are both potent inducers of ER stress. At optimal concentrations (2 and 0.5 μm, respectively), they also induced HA-mediated leukocyte adhesion to SMC cultures (Fig. 2A). In contrast, neither oxidant stress (250 μm H2O2 treatment for 23 h) nor heat shock (42 °C for 30 min and then 37 °C for 22.5 h) promoted HA-mediated leukocyte adhesion (Fig. 2B). Dextran sulfate, a compound used in vivo to induce intestinal inflammation in a well studied mouse model of colitis, also strongly promoted adhesion of leukocytes to SMCs (Fig. 3A). Optimal adhesion was achieved by exposing SMC cultures to only 5–10 μg/ml dextran sulfate for 23 h at 37 °C. Hyaluronidase treatment removed the bound monocytes, and predigestion of the cell layer with hyaluronidase prior to the addition of leukocytes prevented leukocyte attachment (Fig. 3A). These results demonstrate that attachment was once again mediated by HA. As expected, dextran sulfate treatment also strongly induced the accumulation of HA in the SMC layer (Fig. 3B). ER Stress Has a Prolonged Effect on Leukocyte Adhesion— The most dramatic effects on leukocyte adhesion were observed when aortic SMCs were treated with dextran sulfate. Dextran sulfate (10 μg/ml) increased leukocyte adhesion 23-fold after a single 24-h exposure (Fig. 4A). When the medium containing dextran sulfate was removed after 24 h and replaced with regular medium, the SMCs remained adhesive for leukocytes for an additional 3 days (Fig. 4A). 24 and 48 h after the dextran sulfate was removed, the treated SMC cultures bound 6- and 5-fold more leukocytes, respectively, than control, untreated SMCs (Fig. 4A). By 72 h, the adhesiveness of the treated SMCs was still 40% greater than that of untreated, control SMCs (p < 0.05), but by 96 h, the treated SMCs were no longer adhesive (Fig. 4A). Also, we investigated whether the effect of dextran sulfate on leukocyte adhesion was sustainable or rapidly down-regulated in the continued presence of dextran sulfate. Aortic SMCs were treated daily with dextran sulfate for 5 days. After a single treatment, leukocyte adhesion was increased 23-fold (Fig. 4B). After 2 days of treatment, the adhesiveness for leukocytes increased to 95-fold above control levels. In the continued presence of dextran sulfate, the SMCs remained adhesive for 5 days, increasing to a maximum adhesiveness of 97-fold above control levels. For the entire 5 days, the adhesion was mediated by HA, as demonstrated by the capacity of hyaluronidase to remove the bound leukocytes (Fig. 4B). HA Deposition Does Not Require de Novo Protein Synthesis—We next determined whether de novo protein synthesis is required for the induction of leukocyte adhesion to SMCs treated with dextran sulfate. Postconfluent aortic SMCs were pretreated with 25 μg/ml cycloheximide for 1.5 h and then treated with or without both dextran sulfate (10 μg/ml) and 25 μg/ml cycloheximide for 12 h. Dextran sulfate was equally effective at promoting leukocyte adhesion in either the presence or the absence of cycloheximide (Fig. 4C). Surprisingly, cycloheximide alone was also able to significantly induce leukocyte adhesion (Fig. 4C). Unlike colonic SMCs, untreated aortic SMCs contained large amounts of intracellular HA, as indicated by its resistance to hyaluronidase digestion (Fig. 5A). Short strands of extracellular HA were observed in cultures of aortic SMCs after only 1 h of treatment with dextran sulfate (Fig. 5A). After 4 h, numerous fine HA-containing strands were observed (Fig. 5A). Such a rapid response suggests that new protein synthesis is unlikely to be required for HA cable production, consistent with the observation that cycloheximide does not block the effects of dextran sulfate on HA-mediated leukocyte adhesion. In fact, cycloheximide alone directly induced the rapid deposition of HA cables. After 2 h of cycloheximide treatment, small HA strands were present, and after 4 h of treatment, large cables were formed (Fig. 5A). The HA deposited in strands after only 1 h of treatment with dextran sulfate is capable of binding leukocytes (Fig. 5B). After 2 h of treatment, numerous leukoyctes can be bound to the strands, and by 4 h even large cables bound with leukocytes are present (Fig. 5B). Following 24 h of treatment, many large cables are present that mediate leukocyte adhesion (Fig. 5B). Quantitative leukocyte adhesion assays support these findings and demonstrate that leukocyte adhesion increases with increasing treatment times. Maximal binding was observed after 23 h of dextran sulfate treatment, and after 1, 2, and4hof treatment, 40, 46, and 49% of maximal binding was observed, respectively. ER Stress Is Associated with HA Deposition in Vivo—Finally, we investigated the association between ER stress and HA deposition in vivo. For our first approach, we examined mice treated orally with dextran sulfate to induce inflammation in the colon. Colonic tissue from mice treated with dextran sulfate for only 3 days showed intense staining for both HA and KDEL-containing proteins, whereas tissue from untreated mice had only minimal staining for HA, and low levels of staining for KDEL-containing proteins (Fig. 6) that were only observed at higher magnifications. As a second approach, we examined sections of diseased human colon for evidence of ER stress and HA deposition in vivo. In inflamed colon, numerous mucosal cells stained very intensely for KDEL-containing proteins in areas rich in HA. Likewise, regions with substantially less HA stained less strongly for KDEL-containing proteins (Fig. 7). These findings in both mouse and human tissue confirm that ER stress is associated with HA deposition in vivo.Fig. 7Inflamed human colon stains positively for ER stress and HA.

A number of investigations have demonstrated that activated leukocytes can bind to endothelial HA via the cell surface receptor CD44 both in vitro and in vivo (11Estess P. Nandi A. Mohamadzadeh M. Siegelman M.H. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For instance, the adhesion of activated T cells to endothelium and their subsequent extravasation are mediated by endothelial HA and the HA-binding form of CD44 expressed by the lymphocytes (8DeGrendele H.C.

Deposition of HA on the surface of microvascular endothelial cells can be up-regulated by proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-15 (11Estess P.

However, it is less clear what regulates the migration and adhesion of leukocytes once they enter the mesenchymal, connective tissue portions of inflamed tissue. HA accumulates in numerous inflammatory conditions including inflammatory bowel disease, atherosclerosis, asthma, pancreatitis, and cirrhosis (6Gerdin B. Hallgren R. J. Intern.

The accumulation of HA in areas of inflammation suggests that the production of HA by mesenchymal cells, including SMCs, may play an active role in regulating leukocyte adhesion and retention. The fact that HA-receptor interactions are associated with the differentiation of monocytes, with the activation of macrophages, and with leukocyte migration suggests that HA can have a dynamic role in the inflammatory process (28Lesley J.

We have previously shown that in the human prostate cancer cell line LN-CaP, 1,25-(OH)2D3 mediates an increase in cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 levels, inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) activity, hypophosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein, and accumulation of cells in G1. In this study, we investigated the mechanism whereby 1,25-(OH)2D3 increases p27 levels. 1,25-(OH)2D3 had no effect on p27 mRNA levels or on the regulation of a 3.5-kb fragment of the p27 promoter. The rate of p27 protein synthesis was not affected by 1,25-(OH)2D3 as measured by luciferase activity driven by the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of p27 that regulate p27 protein synthesis. Pulse-chase analysis of 35S-labeled p27 revealed an increased p27 protein half-life with 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment. Because Cdk2-mediated phosphorylation of p27 at Thr187 targets p27 for Skp2-mediated degradation, we examined the phosphorylation status of p27 in 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated cells. 1,25-(OH)2D3 decreased levels of Thr187 phosphorylated p27, consistent with inhibition of Thr187 phosphorylation-dependent p27 degradation. In addition, 1,25-(OH)2D3 reduced Skp2 protein levels in LNCaP cells. Cdk2 is activated in the nucleus by Cdk-activating kinase through Thr160 phosphorylation and by cdc25A phosphatase via Thr14 and Tyr15 dephosphorylation. Interestingly, 1,25-(OH)2D3 decreased nuclear Cdk2 levels as assessed by subcellular fractionation and confocal microscopy. Inhibition of Cdk2 by 1,25-(OH)2D3 may thus involve two mechanisms: 1) reduced nuclear Cdk2 available for cyclin binding and activation and 2) impairment of cyclin E-Cdk2-dependent p27 degradation through cytoplasmic mislocalization of Cdk2. These data suggest that Cdk2 mislocalization is central to the antiproliferative effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3. 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) exerts antiproliferative effects via cell cycle regulation in a variety of tumor cells, including prostate.

Understanding the mechanisms whereby p27 levels are regulated may yield new targets for potential anticancer agents. Because of the emerging role of p27 in controlling prostate cancer growth, we further investigated the mechanism of 1,25-(OH)2D3 regulation of this CKI in LNCaP cells. p27 is an important regulator of the G1 to S phase transition. p27 binds and inhibits cyclin E/Cdk2 and thereby negatively regulates S phase entry. To traverse G1, cellular p27 levels must decrease. A major mechanism to achieve this regulation involves ubiquitin-dependent p27 proteolysis (30Pagano M. Tam S.W. Theodoras A.M. Beer-Romero P.

Recent studies have revealed a novel pathway for p27 degradation at the G0/early G1 phase of the cell cycle that is independent of Thr187 phosphorylation (37Hara T. Kamura T. Kakayama K. Oshikawa K.

Although not well understood, this pathway is thought to be activated by mitogenic signaling during early G1 prior to Cdk2 activation. This initial phase of p27 degradation then facilitates Cdk2 activation, which results in further p27 degradation in late G1 and ultimately entry into S phase. Although this pathway still involves the ubiquitin-proteasome system, it is independent of Thr187 phosphorylation and may be Skp2-independent (37Hara T. Kamura T. Kakayama K. Oshikawa K.

Synthesis of p27 mRNA is governed by the Forkhead transcription factor family (46Graff J.R. Konicek B.W. McNulty A.M. Wang Z. Houck K. Allen S. Paul J.D. Hbaiu A. Goode R.G. Sandusky G.E.

These transcription factors can be negatively regulated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt growth signaling pathway, which is dysregulated in many cancers, including prostate (27Davies M.A. Koul D. Dhesi H. Berman R. McDonnell T.J. McConkey D. Yung W.K.A. Steck P.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2551-2556PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, 1,25-(OH)2D3 can activate the p27 promoter by enhancing the binding of NF-Y and Sp1 transcription factors to the p27 promoter (41Inoue T. Kamiyama J. Sakai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32309-32317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The 5′-untranslated region (UTR) of the p27 mRNA regulates the translation of p27. In quiescent cells, p27 translation is enhanced despite an overall decrease in the synthesis of most other proteins (31Hengst L. Reed S.I. Science. 1996; 271: 1861-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 42Millard S.S. Yan J.S. Nguyen H. Pagano M. Kiyokawa H. Koff A. J. Biol.

The translation of most proteins involves recognition of the mRNA 5′ 7-methylguanosine cap by the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E. Eukaryotic initiation factor 4E activity is regulated by mitogenic stimulation (reviewed in Ref. 44Miskimins W.K. Wang G. Hawkinson M. Miskimins R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4960-4967Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In the absence of mitogenic signaling, this cap-dependent translation is decreased through down-regulation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E activity. The 5′-UTR of p27, however, contains an internal ribosomal entry site, which allows cap-independent translation of p27. This is enhanced by binding of HuR, a member of the embryonic lethal, abnormal vision (ELAV) family of RNA-binding proteins and binding of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins C1 and C2, factors implicated in mRNA stability and processing, to the 5′-UTR of p27 (42Millard S.S.

To elucidate the mechanism of 1,25-(OH)2D3-mediated increase in p27 protein levels, we investigated 1,25-(OH)2D3 regulation of p27 transcription, translation, and degradation in LNCaP cells. The 1,25-(OH)2D3-mediated increase in p27 was post-translational, via an increase in p27 protein half-life. 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment decreased Thr187 phosphorylation of p27, a critical phosphorylation event that targets p27 for Skp2-mediated proteolysis (36Slingerland J.M. Pagano M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). In addition, 1,25-(OH)2D3 decreased the nuclear localization of Cdk2, the kinase that phosphorylates p27 at Thr187. Thus, p27 up-regulation by 1,25-(OH)2D3 results from increased p27 protein half-life via decreased Thr187 phosphorylation. 1,25-(OH)2D3-mediated decreases in nuclear Cdk2 translocation may directly reduce cyclin E- and A-dependent Cdk2 activity because of reduced nuclear Cdk2 pools available for cyclin binding. Cytoplasmic Cdk2 mislocalization would also contribute to reduced Thr187 phosphorylation of p27. Thus, a determinant of growth regulation by 1,25-(OH)2D3 may be the capacity of 1,25-(OH)2D3 to decrease the nuclear localization of Cdk2, thereby preventing activation of this kinase. Materials—Cell culture media (RPMI 1640 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-high glucose) were obtained from Invitrogen, and fetal bovine serum was from Hyclone (Logan, UT). 1,25-(OH)2D3 was purchased from BIOMOL Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Mouse anti-actin antibody (1378 996) was obtained from Roche Applied Science. Anti-human phospho-Thr187-p27 antibodies were obtained from Zymed Laboratories (San Francisco, CA). Anti-human p27, Cdk2, Skp2, protein A-agarose beads, and anti-rabbit IgG, anti-goat IgG, and anti-mouse IgG antibodies with horseradish peroxidase conjugate were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies, mAb414 antibodies, and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole were generously provided by Dr. Beatriz Fontoura (University of Miami School of Medicine, Miami, FL). Cell Culture—LNCaP-FGC cells (ATCC) were passaged and maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 μg/ml l-glutamine. All of the cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. [3H]Thymidine Uptake Assays—LNCaP cells were treated with either ethanol vehicle or 10 nm 1,25(OH)2D3. Following the 48-h treatment period, the media were replaced with [3H]thymidine-containing medium, and the cells were incubated for 18 h. Acid soluble tritium was removed by a trichloroacetic acid wash; the cells were then lysed, and [3H]thymidine uptake was determined by scintillation counting. Reporter Plasmids and Luciferase Assay—The reporter plasmids p27PFLuc and control (41Inoue T. Kamiyama J. Sakai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32309-32317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) were the generous gifts of Dr. Toshiyuki Sakai (Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kawaramachi-Hirokoji). The reporter plasmids 5′-SvL-3′ and controls (43Millard S. Vidal A. Markus M. Koff A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5947-5959Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) were provided by Dr. Andrew Koff (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York). For luciferase assays, the cells were transfected with 5.0 μg of reporter plasmid and 1.0 μg of cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase vectors and treated with either ethanol vehicle or 10 nm 1,25-(OH)2D3 or serum-starved for the appropriate time periods. Following the treatment period, the cell lysates were collected, and luciferase activity was observed. β-Galactosidase activities were measured to normalize for transfection efficiency. Pulse-Chase Analysis—One day after plating, the cells were treated with either ethanol vehicle or 10 nm 1,25-(OH)2D3 for 24 h. Following the treatment period, the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (–met) and 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum for 1 h. Next, the cells were pulsed for 1 h with 500 μCi of [35S]Met (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Following the pulse, the cells were then chased for 0, 1, 3, and 6 h with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (–met) medium containing 40 mm cold methionine and 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. After the chase times, the cells were lysed in sample buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml aprotonin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 mm NaF, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Extracts (500 μg protein) were precleared with 1 μg of normal rabbit IgG preadsorbed with protein A-agarose beads. Precleared extracts were then incubated with 1 μg of polyclonal p27 antibody and agitated overnight at 4 °C. The samples were then equilibrated with lysis buffer and 25 μl of packed volume of protein A-agarose beads for 4 h at 4 °C with agitation. Following three washes with lysis buffer, immune complexes were eluted by boiling in 20 μl of Laemmli gel loading buffer. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane filters, and exposed to autoradiography. Western Blot Analysis—The cells were treated with ethanol vehicle, 10 nm 1,25-(OH)2D3, or serum-starved for appropriate times, washed, and lysed in sample buffer. The protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad Dc Protein Assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. 50 μg of cell extract proteins were subjected to standard SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane filters. The filters were processed for Western blotting using standard procedures. Briefly, the filters were incubated overnight at 4 °C in blocking solution (5% dry milk, 0.1% Tween in 1× wash buffer (20 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA)) followed by incubation with the primary antibody for 1 h. For phospho-specific antibodies, the filters were blocked overnight in 5% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween in PBS. Actin antibody (Roche Applied Science) was used at 0.5 μg/ml. p27 and Cdk2 antibodies were used at 1.0 μg/ml. After washing, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and the proteins were visualized using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) following the supplier's instructions. In Vitro Cdk2 Kinase Assay—LNCaP cells plated at 40–50% confluency were treated with either ethanol vehicle or 10 nm 1,25-(OH)2D3. Following the treatment period, the cells were washed in PBS and solubilized in TNE buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 1:100 dilution of the protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 50 mm NaF, and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate. The protein concentrations of the lysates were determined as described above. 200 μg of proteins were then incubated with 3 μg of rabbit anti-human Cdk2 or rabbit anti-human cyclin E antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C. Following this incubation, the samples were adsorbed with 40 μl of anti-rabbit IgG-agarose beads (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing once with TNE buffer and three times with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2), immune complexes were incubated in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 1 μg of histone H1, 25 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 4× Laemmli buffer. After 5 min of boiling, the samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Phosphorylated histone H1 was visualized by autoradiography. After the autoradiography, the membrane was subjected to Western blotting for Cdk2 and cyclin E. Subcellular Fractionation—The cells were treated with ethanol vehicle, 10 nm 1,25-(OH)2D3 or serum-starved for appropriate times. Following the treatment periods, the cells were washed in PBS and lysed in transport buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm MgCl2) containing 15 μg/ml digitonin (Calbiochem, Cambridge, MA) and 10 μg/ml aprotonin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 mm NaF, and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate. The lysates were then centrifuged for 5 min at 800 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected (cytosolic fraction). The nuclear fraction was obtained by sonication of the pellet in transport buffer. The protein concentrations of both fractions were determined as described above. 25 μg of cytosolic and 50 μg nuclear proteins were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane filters. The filters were processed for Western blotting of Cdk2, p27, nucleolin (for fractionation purity), and actin (loading control). Immunofluorescence—One day after plating on coverslips, the cells were treated with ethanol vehicle, 10 nm 1,25-(OH)2D3, or serum-starved for appropriate times. Following the treatment period, the cells were fixed in 2% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. Next, the cells were permeablized in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. The cells were then incubated for 1 h with rabbit anti-Cdk2 (1:50 dilution in PBS) and mouse anti-nucleoporin antibodies (mAB414), washed in PBS, and incubated for 1 h with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:1000) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibodies. Following three additional washes, the coverslips were incubated with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 5 min and mounted on glass slides in anti-fade medium. The images were then collected using confocal microscopy (Zeiss). Quantification and Statistical Analysis—Western blot data were quantified using densitometry. The data were analyzed via either a two-tailed unpaired t test or a one-way analysis of variance followed by a Bonferroni post test using GraphPad Prism version 3.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). For confocal image analysis, fluorescence intensities were determined using ImageJ (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). For the 24-h time point, 85 control cells and 81 treated cells were quantified. For the 48-h time point, 108 control cells and 89 treated cells were quantified. Statistical analysis was performed using an unpaired two-tailed t test (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.001). 1,25-(OH)2 Vitamin D3 Does Not Regulate the Transcription or Translation of p27—We previously reported that 1,25-(OH)2D3 inhibits the growth of the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line (11Zhuang S.-H.

Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1197-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). [3H[Thymidine incorporation in 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated LNCaP cells was decreased ∼85% of control (Fig. 1A). This decrease in proliferation by 1,25-(OH)2D3 is associated with an increased percentage of LNCaP cells in G1 and a concomitant decrease in S and G2/M (Fig. 1B). Consistent with inhibition of G1 to S progression, 1,25-(OH)2D3 increases the levels of the CKI p27Kip1, enhances the association of this CKI with Cdk2, and decreases Cdk2 activ"
https://openalex.org/W2083573042,"Previous studies have shown that mouse osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells undergo apoptosis when exposed to a mixture of proinflammatory cytokines. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)s are important regulators of osteoblast differentiation. Because regulation of osteoblastic differentiation is poorly understood, we sought to determine if BMP-4-induced differentiation of osteoblastic cells depends on the activity of the key apoptotic proteases, i.e. the caspases. BMP-4 induced the growth arrest and differentiation of osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1, as evidenced by the appearance of osteoblastic phenotypes such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activation and parathyroid hormone (PTH)-dependent production of cAMP. Surprisingly, BMP-4 induced transient and potent activation of caspase-8, caspase-2, and caspase-3, in this order. However, no apoptosis or necrosis in BMP-4-treated cells could be detected by FACS using annexin-V/propodium iodine double staining. Peptide inhibition of caspase activity led to a dramatic reduction in ALP activation and PTH-induced production of cAMP in BMP-4-treated cells. Although BMP-4 treatment resulted in cell-cycle G0/G1 arrest as detected by FACS cell-cycle analysis, caspase inhibitors (caspase-8, caspase-2, and caspase-3 inhibitors) could block the G0/G1 arrest in MC3T3-E1 cells. Taken together, these results confirm a unique and unanticipated role for the caspase-mediated signal cascade in the differentiation of osteoblasts.

Normal cell death is an important physiological process in which unnecessary cells are eliminated both during development and in adulthood (1Cohen J.J. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 126-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar). The processes involved in apoptosis are tightly regulated, and alterations in their function may result in disorders, including autoimmune disease and cancer (2Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6162) Google Scholar). It is likely that osteoblasts may undergo programmed cell death because of their increased sensitivity to apoptosis-inducing agents in a special environment, e.g. excess cytokine exposure in inflammation sites (3Jilka R.L. Weinstein R.S. Bellido T. Parfitt A.M. Manolagas S.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Therefore, apoptosis, especially in osteoblasts, may also play an important part in the duration and pathophysiology of bone-destructive diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and periodontal diseases (4Mogi M. Kinpara K. Kondo A. Togari A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 649-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 5Morimoto Y. Morimoto H. Murata T. Kobayashi S. Ohba T. Haneji T. J. Dent. Res. 1999; 78: 735-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Apoptosis occurs as a consequence of the triggering of several complex signal cascades, and several lines of evidence indicate that caspases play an important role in apoptosis (6Wolf B.B. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20049-20052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). First, caspase activation correlates with the onset of apoptosis, and caspase inhibition attenuates apoptosis (7Bump N.J. Hackett M. Hugunin M. Seshagiri S. Brady K. Chen P. Ferenz C. Franklin S. Ghayur T. Li P. Licari P. Mankovich J. Shi L. Greenberg A.H. Miller L.K. Wong W.W. Science. 1995; 269: 1885-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Second, Caenorhabditis elegans mutants lacking the worm caspase CED-3, have a complete absence of developmentally programmed cell death (8Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1986; 44: 817-829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). More recently, targeted deletion of caspase genes has shown a definitive role for caspases in apoptosis and inflammation (9Green D.R. Cell. 1998; 94: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). Based on their structure and their ordering in cell death pathways, caspases have been classified into initiator and effector enzymes (10Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar). Schematically, effector caspases, which include caspase-3, cleave a variety of cellular substrates; whereas initiator caspases such as caspase-2, -8, and -9 control the activation of the former enzymes (10Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar). However, little is known as to the details of the signal cascade leading to caspase activation in osteoblastic cells, and alternative roles of caspase activation remain to be explored. The cellular alterations associated with cell differentiation share a high degree of similarity with key phenotypic changes usually ascribed to apoptosis, suggesting that the induction of differentiation and apoptosis in cells may use overlapping cellular mechanisms (11Zamzami N. Kroemer G. Nature. 1999; 401: 127-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Recently, caspase activation, especially that of caspase-3, was shown to be required for erythroid and skeletal muscle differentiation (12Zelmati Y. Garrido C. Amsellem S. Fishelson S. Bouscary D. Velensi F. Varet B. Solony E. Hermine O. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 13Fernando P. Kelly J.F. Balazsi K. Slack R.S. Megeney L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Therefore, on the basis of the demonstrated signal efficacy of the death effector protease family, we investigated whether caspases may play a role during osteoblast differentiation. We report herein that the early part of the osteoblast differentiation program relies on the activity of 3 key apoptotic serine proteases, i.e. caspase-2, caspase-3, and caspase-8.

Materials—7-Amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin (AFC), 7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin (AMC), Ac-YVAD-MCA as a caspase-1-like proteinase substrate, Ac-VDVAD-MCA as a caspase-2-like proteinase substrate, and Ac-DEVD-MCA as a caspase-3-like proteinase substrate were purchased from Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). Caspase-8-like proteinase substrate (Ac-IETD-AFC) was from Sigma; and caspase-9-like proteinase substrate (Ac-LEHD-AMC), from Bachem. Caspase-2-like protease inhibitor (Ac-VDVAD-CHO) and caspase-3-like protease inhibitor (Ac-DEVD-CHO) were purchased from Enzyme System Prod. A caspase-8-like protease inhibitor (Ac-IETD-CHO) and caspase-9-like protease inhibitor (Ac-LEHD-CHO) were from Biomol Res. Laboratory. These peptide inhibitors have been used previously to analyze the possible role of these 4 caspases in the intracellular process of apoptosis in various mammalian cells in vitro. Recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-4 was purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The antibody against caspase-1 was obtained from Medical Biological Lab (Nagoya, Japan); and that against caspase-9, from Cell Signaling Tech. The antibodies against caspase-3 and caspase-8 were from BD Biosciences. Cell Culture—MC3T3-E1 cells, established from newborn mouse calvaria, are a clonal osteogenic cell line whose cells can differentiate into osteoblasts. These cells were cultured in plastic dishes containing α-minimal essential medium (α-MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in air with 5% CO2, and were then subcultured until they had become semiconfluent. Cell Proliferation—Cell proliferation assay was performed by the detection of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd)-labeled DNA by use of anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody (mAb) labeled with peroxidase (Cell Proliferation ELISA, Roche Applied Science). In short, MC3T3-E1 cells grown in a 96-well microtiter plate (3 × 103 cells/well) were incubated for different periods of time at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2) in the presence of BMP-4 (10 ng/ml), and were then labeled with BrdUrd for 1 h. The amount of BrdUrd-labeled DNA was quantified by the ELISA. Assessment of the Osteoblastic Phenotype—To assess the phenotype of the cultured cells, we examined them for ALP activity and responsiveness to PTH. ALP activity was determined by use of Blue-Phos substrate (microwell phosphatase substrate system: Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratory). The response to PTH was determined by measuring the amount of cAMP produced by cells with or without exposure to 200 ng/ml human PTH (hPTH (1–34) Peptide Institute Inc.) for 15 min. The concentration of cAMP in cells was measured by an ELISA (Cayman Co.). Determination of Apoptotic Cell Death and Cell Cycle Analysis with a Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter (FACS)—Apoptosis was evaluated with a FACS Calibur (BD Biosciences), using the annexin-V-FITC & propidium iodine (PI) double staining method (apoptosis detection kit, MBL). Cell cycle analysis was also evaluated with the FACS using PI and a cell cycle analysis kit (Cycle Test plus, BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Determination of Apoptotic Cell Death by ELISA—Cellular DNA fragmentation assay was performed by the detection of BrdUrd-labeled DNA fragments in the cytoplasm of cell lysates by use of solid phaseimmobilized anti-DNA mAb and anti-BrdUrd mAb labeled with peroxidase (cellular DNA fragmentation ELISA, Roche Applied Science). In short, MC3T3-E1 cells grown in culture dishes (1 × 105 cells/ml) were labeled with BrdUrd for 15 h; and the cell concentration was then adjusted to 5 × 104 cell/ml, and 100 μl of suspension was transferred to each well of a microtiter plate (Nunc, Denmark, 96-well, flat bottom). Cells were then incubated in the presence of BMP-4 for 24 or 48 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2). The treatment with TNF-α was used as a positive control. The amount of BrdUrd-labeled DNA released into the cytoplasm of apoptotic cells was quantified by ELISA. Assay for Caspase-1, Caspase-2, Caspase-3, Caspase-8, and Caspase-9 —MC3T3-E1 cells in 100-mm dishes were lysed with 400 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Aliquots (100 μl) of the extracts were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 50 μm enzyme substrate (Ac-YVAD-MCA for caspase-1-like proteinase, Ac-VDVAD-MCA for caspase-2-like protease, Ac-DEVD-MCA for caspase-3-like proteinase, Ac-IETD-AFC for caspase-8-like proteinase, and Ac-LEHD-MCA for caspase-9-like proteinase) in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 0.05 m NaCl, and 2.5 mm dithiothreitol in a 300-μl reaction mixture. The fluorescence of the released AMC was measured with a spectrofluorometer with an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. For the caspase-8 assay, the fluorimeter was calibrated by using known concentrations of free AFC (excitation = 400 nm, emission = 505 nm) to generate a standard curve of fluorescence versus μmol of AFC. For specific inhibition of caspase activity, cells were pretreated with a caspase inhibitor for 1 h at 37 °C, and then the caspase assay was performed. Protein concentration of the extract was estimated by conducting a DC-Bio-Rad Protein assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Western Blot Analysis of Caspase Processing—Western blotting of caspase processing was performed by the method of Chua et al. (14Chua C.C. Chua B.H. Chen Z. Landy C. Hamdy R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1593: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) with slight modification. MC3T3-E1 cells were lysed in caspase lysis buffer, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min to remove insoluble materials. Lysed protein content was determined with bovine serum albumin employed as a standard, by means of a DC-Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Lysates were dissolved in SDS electrophoresis buffer; and proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (12%) and subsequently electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After having been blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% bovine serum albumin, the membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with an antibody to either caspase-1, caspase-3, caspase-8, or caspase-9; and the bound antibodies were detected with the corresponding secondary antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. Blots were developed by fluorescence-releasing substrate from Amersham Biosciences. Visualization of the bands in the membranes was performed with a FluorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Statistical Analysis—Data were presented as the mean ± S.E. of 4–6 cultures/group. Each experiment was repeated three times. Differences between control and experimental treatment groups were determined by using the paired Student's t test. Differences were considered significant if p < 0.05. BMP-4 induces mouse bone marrow stromal cells, e.g. ST-2, MC3T3-G2/PA6, and MC3T3-E1 cells, to differentiate and express osteoblastic phenotypes such as ALP activation and PTH-dependent production of cAMP (15Yamaguchi A. Ishizuka T. Kintou N. Wada Y. Katagiri T. Wozney J.M. Rosen V. Yoshiki S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 366-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). To determine whether caspases could play a role in BMP-4-induced osteoblastic differentiation, we utilized mouse osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells treated with human recombinant active BMP-4. We found that BMP-4 (10 ng/ml) caused a profound and transient activation of caspase-2, caspase-3, and caspase-8, with a maximum effect at 90 min (Fig. 1A). However, BMP-4 did not activate caspase-1 and caspase-9 in cells. Western blot analysis of caspase processing also demonstrated that BMP-4 action resulted in a time-dependent decrease in pro-caspase-3 (32 kDa) and caspase-8 (55 kDa), with a maximum effect at 90 min (Fig. 1B). In addition, we detected the band for active caspase-3 (18 kDa) in BMP-4 treated cells. Procaspase-1 and procaspase-9 remained at a constant level through out the experiment. Unfortunately, since commercially available antibodies for caspase-2 could not detect any band of procaspase-2 or processed peptide, we have no Western blot data on caspase-2 processing. Dose-dependent examination showed that BMP-4 treatment resulted in caspase activation up to the maximum at 30 ng/ml. Using several specific caspase inhibitors, we examined the order of caspase activation in BMP-4 treated cells (Fig. 2). BMP-4-induced activation of caspase-8 was inhibited by the caspase-8 peptide inhibitor (Fig. 2A). Although BMP-4-induced activation of caspase-2 was inhibited by caspase-2 and caspase-8 inhibitor, respectively, the activation of caspase-3 was inhibited by all caspase inhibitors tested (Fig. 2A). Western blot analysis also confirmed that all caspase inhibitors tested attenuated the level of BMP-4-induced active caspase-3 (18 kDa, Fig. 2B). Western blot analysis of caspase-8 processing yielded results similar to those shown in Fig. 2A. Taken together, we demonstrated that BMP-4 caused transient caspase-8, caspase-2-like proteinase, and caspase-3 activation to occur, in this order. Activation of the caspase cascade usually leads to DNA degradation, externalization of phosphatidylserine on the plasma membrane, and apoptotic cell death (6Wolf B.B. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20049-20052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). Conceivably, the activation of caspases may be required to remove a population of osteoblasts (through apoptosis) that would normally inhibit the differentiation process. Alternatively, elevated caspase activities may lead to intracellular alterations, which, in turn, activate a differentiation program. To determine whether BMP-4 could trigger apoptotic cell death, we monitored cell proliferation and DNA fragmentation ELISA, and conducted FACS cell-cycle analysis and FACS annexin-V/PI double staining analysis. BMP-4 treatment resulted in the potent growth arrest, which occurred in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). However, BMP-4 could not induce DNA fragmentation up to 48 h; whereas TNF-α as a positive control could do so (Fig. 3B). Although hypodiploid DNA peaks are commonly found in the case of apoptosis, BMP-4 did not produce a significant increase in the proportion of hypodiploid cells up to 48 h (data not shown). Surprisingly, no measurable differences were found in the stage-marker of apoptosis and/or necrosis, as demonstrated by flow cytometry with annexin V and PI (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that BMP-4 induced growth arrest in MC3T3-E1 cells but that elevated caspase activities in cells were not associated with apoptotic cell death. Although we have little insight into the reason for the BMP-4-induced growth arrest in osteoblastic cells, we found that BMP-4 caused potent G0/G1 arrest in MC3T3-E1 cells as early as 24 h after the start of BMP-4 treatment (Fig. 4). The cell cycle arrest was pronounced, with almost 85% of cells in the G0/G1 stage as opposed to 67% in the control cultures; and very few cells could be found in either the S (control versus BMP-4: 28.3 versus 12.3%) or the G2/M (5.4 versus 2.7%) phases, with nearly all cells having been arrested in G0/G1 (p < 0.005 for control versus BMP-4: Table I). We next investigated whether the caspases (caspase-8, caspase-2, and caspase-3) played a mediating role in the BMP-4-induced G0/G1 arrest in cells. Surprisingly, pretreatment of cells with the caspase-2, caspase-3, or caspase-8 inhibitor could prevent the G0/G1 arrest in the BMP-4-treated cells (Table I). We confirmed that the caspases tested were not activated in the presence of their respective inhibitor (data not shown).Table IEffect of caspase inhibitors on the BMP-4-induced G0/G1 arrest in MC3T3-E1 cells as studied by FACS cell-cycle analysisCell cycleG0/G1SG2/M%Control66.95 ± 3.7128.30 ± 3.225.42 ± 1.81BMP-485.01 ± 5.89***12.26 ± 3.25***2.73 ± 0.58BMP-4 + caspase-2 inhibitor66.41 ± 0.6428.06 ± 1.385.56 ± 1.62BMP-4 + caspase-3 inhibitor67.37 ± 3.2927.35 ± 2.605.20 ± 3.29BMP-4 + caspase-8 inhibitor66.87 ± 8.5426.73 ± 5.226.40 ± 1.68BMP-4 + caspase-9 inhibitor85.31 ± 5.77***12.76 ± 2.88***1.86 ± 1.91 Open table in a new tab To assess osteoblast differentiation, we measured ALP activity and PTH-responsive cAMP production in the MC3T3-E1 cells. The control MC3T3-E1 cells had very low levels of ALP activity and a low response to PTH in terms of producing cAMP (Fig. 5, A and B). Exposure of cells to BMP-4 for 2 days significantly increased the ALP activity up to 4-fold of the control, and also induced responsiveness for PTH-elicited cAMP production with statistical significance (p < 0.005). However, pretreatment with the caspase inhibitors (caspase-2, -3, and -8) substantially reduced both responses in cells (Fig. 5), thus indicating that the elevated caspase activities were associated with differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells into phenotypic mouse osteoblastic cells. Our present results point to a novel role for caspases in cell differentiation. Treatment of MC3T3-E1 cells with BMP-4 resulted in potent growth arrest but not apoptosis, as well as in a profound and transient activation of caspase-8, caspase-2-like proteinase, and caspase-3 (Fig. 1). We also obtained similar results showing that BMP-4 treatment resulted in the potent activation of caspase-2-like proteinase, caspase-3, and caspase-8, and that the pretreatment with caspase inhibitors could attenuate BMP-4-induced ALP activation and PTH-response in ST-2 mouse stromal cells (data not shown), suggesting that this phenomenon is not limited to mouse osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. BMP-4 regulates the expression of mouse tissue transglutaminase (16Ritter S.J. Davies P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12798-12806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Although a previous study demonstrated that BMP-2 could induce the activation of caspases and apoptosis in osteoblasts (17Hay E. Lemonnier J. Fromigue O. Marie P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29028-29036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), we found that BMP-4 treatment of MC3T3-E1 cells did not lead to apoptosis but to differentiation. When a cell moves into a quiescent and/or terminally differentiated state from G1, it clearly enters a different metabolic state. This state (G0) has not yet been given a precise molecular, biochemical, or genetic definition. In general, G0/G1 arrest in the cell cycle is induced by apoptotic stimulators and/or occurs in cells in the terminally differentiated state. BMP is known to induce the differentiation of osteoblastic cells having specific phenotypes such as ALP activation, PTH-dependent production of cAMP, and expression of osteocalcin and CBFA1 (15Yamaguchi A. Ishizuka T. Kintou N. Wada Y. Katagiri T. Wozney J.M. Rosen V. Yoshiki S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 366-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 18Yamaguchi A. Katagiri T.

Riggs B.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 1522-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Since we confirmed that BMP-4 treatment resulted in potent growth arrest and G0/G1 arrest in MC3T3-E1 cells (Figs. 3A and 4) and increased ALP activity and PTH-dependent production of cAMP (Fig. 5), these cells likely had begun differentiation. Surprisingly, pretreatment of cells with caspase inhibitors could attenuate the G0/G1 arrest in the BMP-4 treated cells (Table I), and substantially reduced the responses for BMP-4-induced ALP activation and the response to PTH by producing cAMP in cells (Fig. 5). Although caspases, a specific group of cysteine proteases, have been found to play an essential role in apoptosis by cleaving important cellular proteins (6Wolf B.B. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20049-20052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar), the presently found activation of these proteases did not lead to apoptotic and/or necrotic cell death (Fig. 3). Taken together, our observations from this cell culture model support the hypothesis that activation of endogenous caspases is required for osteoblast differentiation but does not lead to apoptotic cell death. Although a recent study on BMP-induced signal cascades focused on SMAD family molecules (20Hoffmann A. Gross G. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 2001; 11: 23-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we demonstrated that activated caspases are involved in BMP-induced signal cascades. Especially, caspase-8, central, and a long predomain-containing caspase, is located at the apex of the cell death receptor-mediated apoptotic cascade. Overall, this signal cascade starts with the activation of caspase-8, the active form of which leads to the sequential activation of caspase-3 and related cysteine proteases, resulting in the proteolytic cleavage of various cellular substrates; and such cleavages, in turn, lead to the characteristic morphologic and biochemical changes that occur during apoptosis (21Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4526) Google Scholar). In accordance with previous findings, we confirmed that BMP-4 caused transient activation of caspase-8, caspase-2-like proteinase, and caspase-3 in this order (Figs. 1 and 2). Furthermore, previous reports suggested that caspase-3 is capable of regulating nonapoptotic functions in certain cell types, e.g. nuclear extrusion in differentiating lens epithelium and keratinocytes, T cell activation, erythroid, and myoblasts (22Ishizaki Y. Jacobson M.D. Raff M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 23Alam A. Cohen L.Y. Aouad S. Sekaly R.P. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1879-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Although the relation between caspase-3 and the cell cycle, especially with respect to G0/G1 arrest, has not been examined, caspase-3 activation was reported to be required for erythroid and skeletal muscle differentiation (12Zelmati Y. Garrido C. Amsellem S. Fishelson S. Bouscary D. Velensi F. Varet B. Solony E. Hermine O. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 13Fernando P. Kelly J.F. Balazsi K. Slack R.S. Megeney L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11025-11030Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Active caspase-3 is known to be involved in caspase activation loop (24Srinivasula S.M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Zangrilli J. Robertson N. Armstrong R.C. Wang L. Trapani J.A. Tomaselli K.J. Litwack G.

Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). By using a protein transfection system, Fernando et al. (13Fernando P. Kelly J.F. Balazsi K. Slack R.S. Megeney L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11025-11030Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the activation of caspase-3 was required for skeletal muscle differentiation. To further test a cell autonomous role of caspase-3 in inducing osteoblast differentiation, we transfected a subconfluent population of MC3T3-E1 cells with recombinant active caspase-3 protein; however, we do not yet have any solid data by this approach (data not shown). Since we demonstrated the position of caspase-3 is relatively downstream in BMP-4-induced cascade in Fig. 2, the activation of caspase-3 may plays an important role in the differentiation of osteoblasts. In addition to caspase-3 and caspase-8, caspase-2-like proteinase showed a novel involvement in osteoblastic cell differentiation. Our observations directly link caspase activities (caspase-8, caspase-2-like proteinase, and caspase-3) to such profound alterations of phenotypes in cell differentiation without ushering in a death-like response. Therefore, other activated caspases (e.g. downstream of caspase-3) might play an important role in the degradation of specific nuclear proteins and lead to osteoblastic differentiation. Taken together, our data demonstrate that normal osteoblast differentiation requires the transient activation of several caspases. Although these proteases are known to be involved in several physiological processes, including apoptotic cell death, inflammation, and T cell proliferation (23Alam A. Cohen L.Y. Aouad S. Sekaly R.P. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1879-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 24Srinivasula S.M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Zangrilli J. Robertson N. Armstrong R.C. Wang L. Trapani J.A. Tomaselli K.J.

Further exploration of the role of caspases in osteoblastic cells would be of major interest for understanding the fate (differentiation versus apoptosis) of osteoblastic cells under different physiological or pathological conditions. Addendum—After we obtained the results presented in this article, we became aware of concurrent research (Refs. 12Zelmati Y. Garrido C. Amsellem S. Fishelson S. Bouscary D. Velensi F. Varet B.

In preparing our manuscript, we referred to these articles and, in several instances, used sentences verbatim from them, basically because of our difficulty with expressions in English. However, we now realize the inappropriateness of such action and sincerely apologize to the authors of those published articles."

It has been reported that C1A and C1B domains of individual PKC isoforms play different roles in their membrane binding and activation; however, DAG affinity of individual C1 domains has not been quantitatively determined. In this study, we measured the affinity of isolated C1A and C1B domains of two conventional PKCs, PKCα and PKCγ, for soluble and membrane-incorporated DAG and phorbol ester by isothermal calorimetry and surface plasmon resonance. The C1A and C1B domains of PKCα have opposite affinities for DAG and phorbol ester; i.e. the C1A domain with high affinity for DAG and the C1B domain with high affinity for phorbol ester. In contrast, the C1A and C1b domains of PKCγ have comparably high affinities for both DAG and phorbol ester. Consistent with these results, mutational studies of full-length proteins showed that the C1A domain is critical for the DAG-induced activation of PKCα, whereas both C1A and C1B domains are involved in the DAG-induced activation of PKCγ. Further mutational studies in conjunction with in vitro activity assay and monolayer penetration analysis indicated that, unlike the C1A domain of PKCα, neither the C1A nor the C1B domain of PKCγ is conformationally restricted. Cell studies with enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged PKCs showed that PKCα did not translocate to the plasma membrane in response to DAG at a basal intracellular calcium concentration due to the inaccessibility of its C1A domain, whereas PKCγ rapidly translocated to the plasma membrane under the same conditions.

All PKCs contain an amino-terminal regulatory domain and a carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain. Based on structural differences in the regulatory domain, PKCs are generally classified into three groups: conventional PKC (α, βI, βII, and γ subtypes), novel PKC (δ, ϵ, η, and θ subtypes), and atypical PKC (ζ and λ/ι subtypes). Regulatory domains of both conventional and novel PKCs contain tandem C1 (C1A and C1B) domains and a C2 domain. The C1 domain (∼50 residues) is a cysteine-rich compact structure that contains five short β strands, a short helix, and two zinc ions (3Zhang G. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Hurley J.H.

The C1 domain was first identified as the interaction site for diacylglycerol (DAG) and phorbol ester in PKCs (11Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3537) Google Scholar), but it was subsequently found in other proteins with diverse functions, including protein kinase D (PKD/PKCμ), chimaerin, Ras-GRP, DAG kinases, and Raf-1 kinase (4Ron D. Kazanietz M.G. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1658-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 6Kazanietz M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 7Brose N. Rosenmund C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4399-4411Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In conventional PKCs, C1A and C1B domains are connected to a calcium-binding C2 domain at the carboxyl-terminal side, whereas in novel PKCs a non-calcium binding C2 domain is located at the amino-terminal side of the C1 domains. Roles of C1 and C2 domains in the membrane binding and activation of conventional and novel PKCs have been extensively studied (5Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32407-32410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 12Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 973-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Yet, it is still not fully understood why these PKCs contain two highly homologous C1 domains and what specific roles the two C1 domains play in the membrane binding and activation of the PKCs. protein kinase C 1,2-sn-diacylglycerol 1,2-sn-dioctanoylglycerol 1,2-sn-dioleoylglycerol phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate surface plasmon resonance isothermal titration calorimeter enhanced green fluorescent protein 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphoserine phosphoserine 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphoglycerol phosphatidylglycerol 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethyl ester. Several laboratories have reported that the two C1 domains of PKCs have disparate ligand affinities and distinct roles (13Slater S.J. Kelly M.B. Taddeo F.J. Rubin E. Stubbs C.D. J. Biol.

Onishi H.K. Kikkawa U. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 9159-9167Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar) reported that C1B domains of PKCs have much higher intrinsic affinities for phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) than C1A domains with an exception of PKC-γ whose C1A domain has only modestly lower PDBu affinity than the C1B domain (20Irie K. Oie K. Nakahara A. Yanai Y. Ohigashi H. Wender P.A. Fukuda H. Onishi H.K. Kikkawa U. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 9159-9167Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). For PKCγ (21Burns D.J. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18330-18338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and PKCδ (15Szallasi Z. Boggi K. Gohari S. Biro T. Acs P. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18299-18301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), good correlation was observed between the intrinsic phorbol ester affinities of C1A and C1B domains and their relative importance in phorbol ester-induced activation of the full-length proteins, supporting the notion that the disparate roles of C1 domains mainly derive from their different intrinsic affinities for phorbol esters. To date, however, correlation between the intrinsic DAG affinities of C1 domains and their relative importance in DAG-dependent PKC activation has not been documented, which makes it difficult to fully understand the relative contribution of C1A and C1B domains of PKC isoforms to their membrane binding and activation under physiological conditions. This study was undertaken to establish the correlation between intrinsic DAG affinity of C1 domains of two conventional PKCs, PKCα and PKCγ, and their relative contribution to the DAG-induced membrane targeting and activation of these PKCs. Determination of affinities of isolated C1A and C1B domains of PKCα and PKCγ for soluble and membrane-incorporated DAG and phorbol ester derivatives by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) revealed distinct ligand affinities of these domains. Further studies with full-length PKCα and PKCγ unravel the molecular basis for differential membrane targeting and activation mechanisms of these closely related PKC isoforms. Materials—1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine (POPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine (POPS), 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol (DiC8), and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol (DiC18) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL) and used without further purification. The Liposofast extruder and 100-nm polycarbonate filters were from Avestin (Ottawa, Ontario, Canada). Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, Triton X-100, (3-(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio)-1-propane sulfonate and octyl glucoside were from Sigma. Pioneer L1 Sensor Chip was from Biacore AB (Piscataway, NJ). Restriction endonucleases and enzymes for molecular biology were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Construction of Expression Vectors and Mutagenesis—Expression vectors were constructed by subcloning C1 domain sequences (see Fig. 1) of rat PKCα and PKCγ into pET21d vectors (Novagen, Madison, WI) between NcoI and XhoI sites by overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). These vectors are designed to introduce a carboxyl-terminal His6 tag between the XhoI site and stop codon for affinity purification of expressed proteins. Baculovirus transfer vectors encoding the cDNA of PKCα and PKCγ with appropriate C1 domain mutations were generated by the overlap extension PCR using pVL1392 PKCα and PKCγ plasmids, respectively. Briefly, appropriate complementary synthetic oligonucleotides introducing the desired mutation and two other primers at the 5′-end and 3′-end of the genes were used for PCR. Two DNA fragments were then annealed and extended to generate an entire PKC gene containing a desired mutation, which was further amplified by PCR. The product was subsequently purified on an agarose gel, digested with NotI and EcoRI for PKCα and with BglII and EcoRI for PKCγ, and the corresponding restriction fragments were subcloned into the pVL1392 plasmid. The mutagenesis was verified by DNA sequencing using a Sequenase 2.0 kit (Amersham Biosciences). Protein Expression and Purification—Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen) was used as host for C1 domain expression. One liter of Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin was inoculated with 1 ml of overnight culture grown at 37 °C. Cells were grown at 37 °C until their absorbance at 600 nm reached ∼0.8–1.4, and the protein expression was then induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Research Products, Mount Prospect, IL). After 4 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation (5,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). Cells were resuspended in 20 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.4% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and sonicated. The supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C. The C1B domains of PKCα and PKCγ were expressed as soluble proteins, whereas others form inclusion bodies. Soluble C1 domains were purified from the supernatant using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) column according to the manufacturer's instructions. On the other hand, insoluble proteins were recovered from the inclusion body pellet, refolded, and purified. First, the inclusion body pellet was resuspended in the same lysis buffer and re-centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C. The washed inclusion body was resuspended in 10 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 50 mm NaCl, 8 m urea, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. Insoluble matter was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 50 mm NaCl, 1.5 m urea, 50 μm ZnSO4, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and then against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The refolded C1 domain was purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting protein was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, to remove the imidazole. Purity of C1 domain samples was higher than 90% electrophoretically. Full-length PKCα and PKCγ proteins were expressed in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells (Invitrogen, La Jolla, CA) as described previously (22Medkova M. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4892-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Transfection of Sf9 cells with pVL1392-based PKC constructs was performed using BaculoGold™ Transfection kit from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Prior to transfection, endotoxins were removed from the plasmid DNA using a lipopolysaccharide extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Cells were incubated for 4 days at 27 °C, and the supernatant was collected and used to infect more cells for the amplification of virus. After three cycles of amplification, high titer virus stock solution was obtained. Sf9 cells were maintained as monolayer cultures in Grace's insect cell culture medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). For protein expression, cells were grown to 2 × 106 cells/ml in 500-ml suspension cultures and infected with the multiplicity of infection of 10. The cells were then incubated for 3 days at 27 °C. For harvesting, cells were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min, washed once with Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, and resuspended in 25 ml of extraction buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The suspension was homogenized in a hand-held homogenizer chilled on ice. The extract was centrifuged at 50,000 × g and at 4 °C for 40 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a 100-ml Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences). After washing with 100 ml of Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol), the column was eluted with 200 ml of a linear salt gradient to 0.5 m KCl in Buffer A. Active PKC fractions were pooled, adjusted to 2 m KCl, and loaded onto a 10-ml Poros PE column (Roche Applied Science) with a flow rate of 4 ml/min. A linear salt gradient from 2 to 0 m KCl in Buffer A (total volume, 60 ml) was applied. Active PKC fractions were concentrated and desalted in an Ultrafree-15 centrifugal filter device (Millipore) and stored in Buffer A containing 50% glycerol at –20 °C. Purity of the full-length proteins was higher than 80% electrophoretically. Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). PKC Activity Assay—Activity of PKC was assayed by measuring the initial rate of [32P]phosphate incorporation from [γ-32P]ATP (50 μm, 0.6 μCi/tube) into the histone III-SS (400 μg/ml) (Sigma). The reaction mixture contained large unilamellar vesicles (0.1 mm), 5 mm MgCl2, PKC, and 0.1 mm CaCl2 in 50 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Free calcium concentration was adjusted using a mixture of EGTA and CaCl2 according to the method of Bers (23Bers D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: C404-C408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were started by adding MgCl2 to the mixture and quenched by adding 50 μl of 1% aqueous phosphoric acid solution after a given period of incubation (5 min for PKCα and 10 min for PKCγ) at room temperature. 75-μl aliquots of quenched reaction mixtures were spotted on P-81 ion-exchange papers (Whatman), washed four times with 1% aqueous phosphoric acid solution, and washed once with 95% aqueous ethanol. Papers were transferred into scintillation vials containing 4 ml of scintillation fluid (Sigma), and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The linearity of the time dependence of the reaction was checked by monitoring the degree of phosphorylation at regular intervals. SPR Measurements—The preparation of vesicle-coated Pioneer L1 sensor chip (Biacore) was described in detail elsewhere (24Stahelin R.V. Cho W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4672-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Briefly, after washing the sensor chip surface, 90 μl of vesicles containing POPC/POPS/DiC18 (67.5:30:2.5 in mole ratio) or POPC/POPS/PMA (70: 30:0.05) were injected at 5 μl/min. Similarly, a control surface was coated with POPC vesicles to give the same resonance unit response as the active binding surface. This control surface was selected over the bare chip surface to circumvent any potential artifacts caused by the hydrophobic nature of the L1 chip. Each lipid layer was stabilized by injecting 10 μl of 50 mm NaOH until no decrease in lipid signal was observed. After the signal was stabilized, 90 μl of protein in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.16 m KCl and 50 μm ZnSO4 was injected. Due to extremely slow dissociation of C1 domains from the vesicle surface, it was impractical to determine Kd from kinetic measurements. Hence, equilibrium binding measurements were performed with the flow rate of 5 μl/min to allow sufficient time for the R values of the association phase to reach saturating response values (Req). Req values were then plotted versus protein concentrations (C), and the Kd value was determined by a non-linear least-squares analysis of the binding isotherm using an equation, Req = Rmax/(1 + Kd/C). ITC Measurements—Binding of C1 domains to water-soluble PDBu or DiC8 ligands was measured using a MicroCal VP isothermal titration calorimeter (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA). Protein samples used for the titration were prepared by dialyzing overnight against 4 liters of a working buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.16 m KCl, 50 μm ZnSO4). Experiments were performed at 30 °C using the working buffer as a reference and a diluent. Protein concentration and ligand concentration used for each measurement varied according to the range of Kd value to be measured. Binding measurements were performed with 5-μl stepwise injections of the ligand into the protein in the sample cell. Injections were continued until saturating signals were obtained. The collected data were analyzed with the Origin software (MicroCal) using a simple single-site binding model. Monolayer Measurements—The penetration of PKC into the phospholipid monolayer was measured by monitoring the change in surface pressure (π) at constant surface area using a 10-ml circular Teflon trough and Wilhelmy plate connected to a Cahn microbalance as previously described (25Bittova L. Sumandea M. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9665-9672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). All our monolayer measurements were performed at 23 °C. A lipid monolayer containing various combinations of phospholipids was spread onto the subphase composed of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.16 m KCl until the desired initial surface pressure (π0) was reached. After the signal stabilized (∼5 min), 30 μgof proteins was injected, and the increase in surface pressure (Δπ) was monitored for 45 min while stirring the subphase at 60 rpm. Typically, the Δπ value reached a maximum after 20 min. It has been shown empirically that Δπ caused by a protein is mainly due to the penetration of the protein into the lipid monolayer (25Bittova L. Sumandea M. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9665-9672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The maximal Δπ value depended on the protein concentration and reached a saturation value (e.g. [PKCα] ≥ 2.0 μg/ml); therefore, the protein concentration in the subphase was maintained above such values to ensure that the observed Δπ represented a maximum value. The resulting Δπ was plotted versus π0 from which the critical surface pressure (πc) was determined as the x-intercept (26Cho W. Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—A stable HEK293 cell line expressing the ecdysone receptor (Invitrogen) was used for all experiments. Briefly, cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °Cin5%CO2 and 98% humidity until 90% confluent. Cells were passaged into eight wells of a Lab-Tech™ chambered coverglass for later transfection and visualization. Cells between the 5th and 20th passages were used for all measurements. For transfection, 80–90% confluent cells in Lab-Tech™ chambered coverglass wells were exposed to 150 μl of unsupplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5 μg of endotoxin-free DNA and 1 μl of LipofectAMINE™ reagent (Invitrogen) for 7 h at 37 °C. After exposure, the transfection medium was removed, the cells were washed once with fetal bovine serum-supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and overlaid with fetal bovine serum-supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing Zeocin™ (Invitrogen) and 5 μg/ml ponasterone A (Invitrogen) to induce protein production. Confocal Microscopy—All imaging was done using a four-channel Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope. A 63×, 1.2-numerical aperture water immersion objective was used for all experiments, which were carried out at the same laser power and the same gain and offset settings on the photomultiplier tubes. These conditions induced minimal photobleaching over 45 scans. EGFP was excited using the 488-nm line of an argon/krypton laser, and a linepass 505-nm filter was used to monitor EGFP emission. To clamp intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) cells were loaded with 10 μm BAPTA-AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) 30 min prior to imaging. Immediately before imaging, cells were washed with 150 μl of 1 mm EGTA, followed by a washing with 150 μl of HEK buffer (1 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 6 mm sucrose, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2) and then overlaid with 150 μl of HEK buffer. After initially imaging cells, protein translocation was monitored by scanning at 8- to 15-s intervals following addition of 0.1 μg/μl DiC8 (final concentration). Treatment of cells with 1% Me2SO alone did not induce translocation of PKCα or -γ. Control experiments done with HEK293 cells loaded with Fura Red (Molecular Probes) indicated that addition of DiC8 to HEK293 cells do not increase [Ca2+]i, precluding the possibility that the translocation response in these experiments is due to an increase in [Ca2+]i. Images were analyzed as described previously (27Stahelin R.V. Rafter J.D. Das S. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12452-12460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) using the analysis tools provided in the Zeiss biophysical software package. Briefly, regions of interest in the cytosol were defined, and the average intensity in a square (1 × 1 μm) was obtained with respect to time. Membrane intensities were determined for each frame in individual cells by extending a line from the cytosol to the outside of the cell and recording the intensity with distance along the line. By crosschecking markers on the diagram with a table of intensity data, three intensity values corresponding to the place on the line indicating the edge of the cell were averaged. Lines were drawn in three places in each cell, and membrane intensity values were determined and averaged. The resulting intensity values were converted to a ratio of intensity at the membrane to the sum of intensities at the membrane and at the cytosol for each time frame. A plot of this intensity ratio versus time was prepared to visualize and compare the translocation response for wild type and mutant proteins. Functional Expression and Characterization of C1 Domains— We selected for this study the C1 domains of two conventional PKCs, PKCα and PKCγ, for two reasons. First, our previous studies indicated that only the C1A domain plays a critical role in the DAG-induced membrane binding and activation of PKCα (17Medkova M. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19852-19861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 18Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4218-4226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It is not known, however, whether or not this exclusive role of the C1A domain is due to its higher intrinsic affinity for DAG than the C1B domain. Second, unlike other PKC isoforms, PKCγ has been shown to have two C1 domains with comparable phorbol ester affinity (20Irie K. Oie K. Nakahara A. Yanai Y. Ohigashi H. Wender P.A. Fukuda H. Onishi H.K. Kikkawa U. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 9159-9167Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This raises an interesting possibility that the two C1 domains of PKCγ might also have similar DAG affinity and therefore contribute similarly to the membrane binding and activation of this PKC isoform. Therefore, these two homologous PKC isoforms should serve as an excellent model to test how DAG affinity of individual C1 domains affects the membrane binding and activation mechanism of PKCs. We first expressed and characterized the C1A and C1B domains of PKCα and PKCγ whose amino acid sequences are shown in Fig. 1. PKC C1 domains have aliphatic and aromatic side chains surrounding the ligand binding pocket that have been shown to be involved in membrane insertion and hydrophobic membrane interactions (3Zhang G. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 17Medkova M. Cho W. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10709-10717Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Due to the presence of these exposed hydrophobic residues, C1 domains have a high tendency to aggregate when they are ectopically expressed in bacterial cells (29Cho W. Digman M. Ananthanarayanan B. Stahelin R.V. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 233: 291-298PubMed Google Scholar), hampering their functional expression. In fact, C1B domains were expressed as soluble proteins in E. coli with relatively low yield (<1 mg/liter of culture medium), whereas C1A domains were expressed as inclusion bodies. The latter proteins were then solubilized in urea and refolded. To verify that all the C1 domains wer"
https://openalex.org/W2084746444,"In T lymphocytes, sustained calcium (Ca2+) influx through Ca2+ channels localized in the plasma membrane is critical for T cell activation and proliferation. Previous studies indicated that voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs) play a role in Ca2+ mobilization during T lymphocyte activation. However, the role of VDCCs in otherwise nonexcitable cells is still poorly understood. We used RT-PCR to identify a transcript encoding the pore-forming α1F-subunit of an L-type Ca2+ channel in T lymphocytes. Its identity was confirmed by DNA sequencing. To further investigate the contribution of Ca2+ influx through VDCCs, we assessed the effects of the 1,4-dihydropyridine L-type Ca2+ channel agonist, (+/-) Bay K 8644, and antagonist, nifedipine, on the human Jurkat T cell leukemia line, human peripheral blood T lymphocytes and mouse splenocytes. We found that treatment of T lymphocytes with (+/-) Bay K 8644 increased intracellular Ca2+ and induced the activation of phosphoextracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2), whereas nifedipine blocked Ca2+ influx, the activity of Erk1/2 and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), interleukin-2 (IL-2) production, and IL-2 receptor expression. Nifedipine also significantly suppressed splenocyte proliferation in an in vitro mixed lymphocyte reaction and the proliferation of male antigen (H-Y)-specific T cell receptor-transgenic CD8+ T cells in transplanted male mice in vivo. Taken together these novel findings indicate that an L-type Ca2+ channel plays a significant role in the Ca2+ influx pathways mediating T lymphocyte activation and proliferation in vitro and in vivo.

To further investigate the contribution of Ca2+ influx through VDCCs, we assessed the effects of the 1,4-dihydropyridine L-type Ca2+ channel agonist, (+/-) Bay K 8644, and antagonist, nifedipine, on the human Jurkat T cell leukemia line, human peripheral blood T lymphocytes and mouse splenocytes. We found that treatment of T lymphocytes with (+/-) Bay K 8644 increased intracellular Ca2+ and induced the activation of phosphoextracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2), whereas nifedipine blocked Ca2+ influx, the activity of Erk1/2 and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), interleukin-2 (IL-2) production, and IL-2 receptor expression. Nifedipine also significantly suppressed splenocyte proliferation in an in vitro mixed lymphocyte reaction and the proliferation of male antigen (H-Y)-specific T cell receptor-transgenic CD8+ T cells in transplanted male mice in vivo. Taken together these novel findings indicate that an L-type Ca2+ channel plays a significant role in the Ca2+ influx pathways mediating T lymphocyte activation and proliferation in vitro and in vivo. In T lymphocytes, calcium (Ca2+) plays a fundamental role as a second messenger in regulating numerous cellular functions, including activation, proliferation, and death (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4493) Google Scholar, 2Medema J.P. Borst J. Hum. Immunol. 1999; 60: 403-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The events surrounding Ca2+ mobilization in T lymphocytes are tightly regulated through membrane receptors, signaling molecules, and ion channels. Intracellular Ca2+ release is initiated through the recognition of antigen/major histocompatibility complex by the T cell receptor (TCR) 1The abbreviations used are: TCRT cell receptorIP3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphateERendoplasmic reticulumNFATnuclear factor of activated T cellsIL-2interleukin-2IP3RIP3 receptorTRPtransient receptor potentialVDCCsvoltage-dependent Ca2+ channelsCRAC channelCa2+ release-activated Ca2+ channelICRACCRAC currentDHP1,4-dihydropyridinePHAphytohemagglutininConAconcanavalin APBMCsperipheral blood mononuclear cellsTgtransgenicmAbmonoclonal antibodyrhIL-2recombinant human IL-2PBTsperipheral blood T lymphocytesMAPmitogen-activated proteinErk1/2extracellular-regulated kinase1/2TPA12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetateIL-2RIL-2 receptorPIpropidium iodideCFSE5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl esterMLRmixed lymphocyte reactionKv channelsvoltage-dependent potassium channelsK+potassiumNTno treatment./CD3 complex during T lymphocyte activation (3van Leeuwen J.E.

Following ligation of the TCR, non-receptor tyrosine kinases phosphorylate and activate phospholipase Cγ1, which cleaves phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate from plasma membrane phospholipids to generate diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) (4Scharenberg A.M. Kinet J.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Elevated levels of IP3 in the cytosol lead to the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and a sustained Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space (5Patel S. Joseph S.K. Thomas A.P. Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 247-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 6Guse A.H. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 18: 419-448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A sustained Ca2+ signal ranging from a concentration of ∼200 nm to >1 μm for up to 48 h is necessary to activate nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), a transcription factor that regulates the expression of various cytokine genes including interleukin-2 (IL-2) (7Lewis R.S.

Although the mechanisms of Ca2+ release from the intracellular stores within T lymphocytes are well characterized, the Ca2+ entry pathway from extracellular sources into T lymphocytes still remains elusive despite the fact that it contributes to the majority of elevated intracellular Ca2+ during T lymphocyte activation (8Haverstick D.M. Engelhard V.H. Gray L.S. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 3306-3313PubMed Google Scholar). Several models for Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane of T lymphocytes have been proposed, including IP3 receptor (IP3R) Ca2+ channels, mammalian homologues of transient receptor potential (TRP) Ca2+ channels, and L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs). Initially, investigators suggested that a plasma membrane IP3R Ca2+ channel, similar to the IP3R found in the ER, was responsible for Ca2+ influx in T lymphocytes (9Jayaraman T. Ondriasova E. Ondrias K. Harnick D.J. Marks A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6007-6011Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). A recent study confirmed that T lymphocytes express three isoforms of the IP3R Ca2+ channel as integral plasma membrane proteins (10Tanimura A. Tojyo Y. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27488-27493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the IP3R isoforms exhibit functional redundancy; defining the respective contributions of these channels to Ca2+ influx during T cell activation has therefore been difficult (11Hirota J. Baba M. Matsumoto M. Furuichi T. Takatsu K. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 615-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Studies based on electrophysiology of T lymphocytes lead to a second model for Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane through Ca2+-release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels (12Kerschbaum H.H. Cahalan M.D. Science. 1999; 283: 836-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 13Fomina A.F. Fanger C.M. Kozak J.A. Cahalan M.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1435-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Although the molecular identity of the CRAC channel is still unclear, potential gene candidates include the TRP gene superfamily of ion channels (14Gamberucci A. Giurisato E. Pizzo P. Tassi M. Giunti R. McIntosh D.P. Benedetti A. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 15Cui J. Bian J.S. Kagan A. McDonald T.V. J. Biol.

Science. 2001; 293: 1327-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Currently, CaT1 appears to be the primary TRP gene candidate for the CRAC channel, but the CaT1 gene product does not seem to exhibit all of the electrophysiological properties associated with CRAC current (ICRAC) (15Cui J. Bian J.S. Kagan A. McDonald T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47175-47183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 17Yue L. Peng J.B. Hediger M.A. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2001; 410: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). There is also evidence to support the existence of voltage-dependent-like Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane of T lymphocytes. VDCCs are heteromultimeric proteins whose conformations are sensitive to changes in the electrical potential across the plasma membrane (18Hofmann F. Lacinova L. Klugbauer N. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 139: 33-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The basis of the VDCC model is that nonexcitable cells, such as T lymphocytes, may express a Ca2+ channel that shares common structural features with a VDCC of electrically excitable cells but is not gated by changes in membrane potential. Initial support for the presence of voltage-dependent-like Ca2+ channels in T lymphocytes came when Densmore et al. (19Densmore J.J. Szabo G. Gray L.S. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 20Densmore J.J. Haverstick D.M. Szabo G. Gray L.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1494-C1503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) identified an electrically responsive current in the plasma membrane of Jurkat T lymphocytes. This “voltage-operable” current had different electrophysiological properties than ICRAC, but was activated through the TCR/CD3 complex and Ca2+ store depletion (19Densmore J.J. Szabo G. Gray L.S. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 20Densmore J.J. Haverstick D.M. Szabo G. Gray L.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1494-C1503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RTPCR analysis has also shown that transcripts of the pore-forming α1C- and α1S-subunits of L-type VDCCs are expressed in Jurkat T cells (21Brereton H.M. Harland M.L. Froscio M. Petronijevic T. Barritt G.J. Cell Calcium. 1997; 22: 39-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition, Savignac et al. (22Savignac M. Badou A. Moreau M. Leclerc C. Guery J.C. Paulet P. Druet P. Ragab-Thomas J. Pelletier L. Faseb J. 2001; 15: 1577-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) demonstrated that murine T cell hybridomas express L-type Ca2+ channel mRNA and protein. Several pharmacological studies have provided further evidence to support the expression of VDCCs in T lymphocytes. For instance, it has been reported that the synthetic 1,4-dihydropyridine (DHP) L-type Ca2+ channel antagonist, nifedipine, is a potent suppressor of T lymphocyte proliferation. Based upon an in vitro [3H]thymidine uptake assay, Birx et al. (23Birx D.L. Berger M. Fleisher T.A. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 2904-2909PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that 0.001–100 μm nifedipine prevented the proliferation of human T lymphocytes in response to the mitogens, phytohemagglutinin (PHA), and concanavalin A (ConA). In a similar study, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) stimulated with PHA were unable to proliferate in the presence of 10–200 μm nifedipine; the addition of IL-2 restored the proliferative response in the nifedipine-treated cells (24Gelfand E.W. Cheung R.K. Grinstein S. Mills G.B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1986; 16: 907-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated through in vitro proliferation assays that nifedipine has a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on T lymphocyte proliferation when added in combination with the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporin A (25Padberg W.M. Bodewig C. Schafer H. Muhrer K.H. Schwemmle K. Transplant Proc. 1990; 22: 2337PubMed Google Scholar, 26Marx M. Weber M. Merkel F. Meyer zum Buschenfelde K.H. Kohler H. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 1990; 5: 1038-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The aim of this work was to understand the contribution of Ca2+ influx through VDCCs during T lymphocyte activation and proliferation. We began this investigation by using a PCR assay to demonstrate for the first time that the pore-forming α1F-subunit L-type Ca2+ channel transcript is expressed in human T lymphocytes. After confirming the presence of a VDCC in T lymphocytes, we then determined that L-type Ca2+ channels play a critical role in TCR-induced activation. We show that both (+/-) Bay K 8644 (a DHP agonist that induces L-type Ca2+ channel opening) and nifedipine (a DHP antagonist that blocks L-type Ca2+ channels) can modulate early and late signaling events during T lymphocyte activation and proliferation. The results in this study collectively suggest the presence of a DHP-sensitive L-type VDCC in the plasma membrane of T lymphocytes. Mice—C57Bl/6 female mice bearing a transgenic (Tg) TCRαβ receptor specific for the male antigen H-Y were provided by Dr. Philippe Poussier at Sunnybrook and Women's College, Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, Canada. Balb/c and C57Bl/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were housed in the animal facilities at University of British Columbia and were used between 8 and 12 weeks of age. All mice studies were approved by the Committee on Animal Care at the University of British Columbia using the guidelines set out by the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Cell Line and Culture Conditions—The human T cell leukemia line Jurkat clone E6–1 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mm glutamine, 20 mm HEPES, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. Isolation and Culture of Human Peripheral Blood T Lymphocytes— Whole blood (10–50 ml) was collected from healthy human male and female donors (n = 15). PBMCs were separated by centrifugation at 900 × g for 30 min at 18–20 °C over a Ficoll-Paque PLUS (Amersham Biosciences) gradient. The resulting PBMC layer was washed and resuspended in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mm glutamine, 20 mm HEPES, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. PBMCs were then stimulated for 24 h with 10 μg/ml plate-bound anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb), OKT3 (ATCC), and resuspended in RPMI 1640 containing 5 ng/ml recombinant human IL-2 (rhIL-2) (Serologicals Corporation, Norcross, GA). After growing for 7 d in rhIL-2, the purity of the human peripheral blood T lymphocytes (PBTs) was analyzed on a FACSCalibur cytometer (BD Biosciences) with FITC-conjugated OKT3, FITC-conjugated mouse anti-IgG2a isotype control (Caltag, Burlingame, CA), Cyanine-5-conjugated anti-CD4 mAb (BD Pharmingen), PE-conjugated anti-CD8 mAb (BD Pharmingen), APC-conjugated anti-CD14 mAb (BD Pharmingen), FITC-conjugated anti-CD15 mAb (BD Pharmingen), and PE-conjugated anti-CD19 mAb (BD Pharmingen). Experiments with the activated human PBTs were conducted with cells from day 8–14 in culture. Nested RT-PCR and DNA Sequencing—First strand cDNAs were synthesized with an oligo(dT) primer using 1 μg of total RNA extracted from Weri-Rb1 retinoblastoma, Jurkat T cells, PBTs, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells with the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario). MACS CD4 and CD8 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) were used to positively select and separate human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from PBTs, respectively. Marathon-ready human retina and human spleen cDNA were purchased from Clontech and FirstChoice PCR-Ready human liver cDNA was from Ambion (Austin, TX). RT-PCR fragments (∼770 bp) spanning exons 28–35 of the L-type Ca2+ channel α1F-subunit gene, CACNA1F, were generated with sense primer (5′-GGACCATGGCCCCATCTATAATTACCG-3′) and antisense primer (5′-CCTGAAGAGCCACCTTGCCGAAC-3′). For nested amplification of the CACNA1F gene, PCR fragments (∼180 bp) spanning exons 29 to 30 were generated with sense primer (5′-GAACCCGCATCAGTATCGTG-3′) and antisense primer (5′-AATAGTGAAGAGGCCAGTGAAGACC-3′). The housekeeping gene, rig/S15, which encodes a small ribosomal subunit protein, was amplified with sense primer (5′-TTCCGCAAGTTCACCTACC-3′) and antisense primer (5′-CGGGCCGGCCATGCTTTACG-3′) (27Kitagawa M. Takasawa S. Kikuchi N. Itoh T. Teraoka H. Yamamoto H. Okamoto H. FEBS Lett. 1991; 283: 210-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). RT-PCR and nested PCR reactions were performed with Platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) and were conducted in a Whatman Biometra UnoII Thermocycler at 94 °C for 1 min, then 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 1 min, followed by a 10-min extension at 72 °C. PCR fragments were resolved on a 1% agarose gel and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. The resulting 178 bp fragments were subcloned into pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and the nucleotide sequence determined using standard m13R primer at the DNA Sequencing CORE Facility, University of Florida. Measurement of Intracellular Ca2+ Levels—Intracellular Ca2+ levels were measured using the ratiometric Ca2+ indicator indo-1 acetoxymethyl ester dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) according to manufacturer's recommendations. In brief, Jurkat T cells or human PBTs (donors, n = 3) at 1 × 107 cells/ml were loaded with 1 μm indo-1 for 1 h at 37 °C in MEM. For analysis, 100 μl of cell suspension (1 × 106 cells) was added to either 1.9 ml of MEM or Ca2+-free S-MEM. Indo-1 loaded T cells were then examined for 10 min time periods following induction at the 2 min mark with either 10–100 μm (+/-) Bay K 8644 (Calbiochem), 2 μm ionomycin (Calbiochem) or Me2SO solvent using a FACS-Vantage S.E. (BD Biosciences). Jurkat T cells and human PBTs loaded with indo-1 were also preincubated with 1–200 μm nifedipine (Calbiochem) or Me2SO with or without extracellular Ca2+ in the medium for 10 min. At the 2-min mark, Jurkat T cells were stimulated with 10 μg/ml soluble OKT3, whereas human PBTs required a combination of 2 μg/ml soluble anti-CD28 mAb (Sigma), 10 μg/ml soluble OKT3 and 40 μg/ml soluble rabbit anti-mouse IgG polyclonal Ab (Sigma), which served as a cross-linking Ab, to activate Ca2+ influx. Anti-CD3 stimulation using the OKT3 mAb alone did not activate Ca2+ influx in PBTs. The change in intracellular Ca2+ concentration was determined through the ratio of emission signals of indo-1 at 405 nm and 485 nm, representing the ratio of Ca2+-bound to Ca2+-free indo-1, respectively. In all experiments, the amount of Me2SO solvent was equal to or less than 0.5% of the total treatment volume. (+/-) Bay K 8644 and nifedipine were both prepared in the dark as a stock solution of 200 mm dissolved in Me2SO. Immunoblot Analysis of Phospho-p44/42 MAP Kinase—Jurkat T cells or human PBTs were washed, resuspended at 1 × 107 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 and incubated for4hat37 °C. Cells were then preincubated with or without 2 mm EGTA for 15 min to chelate Ca2+, followed by 10 min stimulation with either (+/-) Bay K 8644 or 2 μm ionomycin at 37 °C. Jurkat T cells were also preincubated with either Me2SO, 100 μm or 200 μm nifedipine for 1 h, followed by 10 min stimulation with 100 μm (+/-) Bay K 8644 at 37 °C. Additionally, as a positive control for phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase activation, Jurkat T cells were stimulated with 10 μg/ml soluble OKT3 for 10 min at 37 °C. Following stimulation, cells were lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium vandadate, 5 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium molybdate, 5 mm β glycerol phosphate, in the presence of 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, pepstatin, and 40 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysates were denatured by boiling in SDS sample buffer, run on 12% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Western blot analysis was performed with phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase rabbit polyclonal Ab (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). After development, the blots were stripped in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2% SDS, and 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 50 °C and then reprobed with extracellular regulated kinase1/2 (Erk1/2) (K-23) polyclonal Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) as a protein-loading control. NFAT Luciferase Assay—1 × 107 Jurkat T cells were washed and resuspended in Opti-MEM. Cells were incubated with either 20 μg of pNFAT-TA-Luc or pTA-Luc (Clontech) for 5 min at 4 °C and transfected by electroporation using a BioRad Gene Pulser Electroporator set at 280 V, 975 μF. 40–48 h after transfection, cells at 1 × 106 cells/ml were incubated with nifedipine (1–200 μm) or Me2SO for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by stimulation with 10 μg/ml soluble OKT3 for 6 h at 37 °C. NFAT-dependent luciferase activity was assayed on 1 × 105 cells/100 μl using the procedures outlined in the Bright-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI). Luciferase activity was measured in a microplate luminometer. IL-2 Assay and IL-2 Receptor Expression—Jurkat T cells or human PBTs at 1 × 106 cells/ml were incubated with Me2SO or nifedipine (1–200 μm) for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were then transferred to a 24-well plate immobilized with 10 μg/ml OKT3, 10 nm 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) (Sigma) was added, and cells were incubated at 37 °C. After 24 h, supernatants were quantified for IL-2 concentration by a standard sandwich ELISA technique (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). To determine whether the Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin, could reverse the inhibitory effect of nifedipine, Jurkat T cells or human PBTs at 1 × 106 cells/ml were incubated with either Me2SO or 1–50 μm nifedipine for 1 h. Cells were then stimulated for 24 h with 10 μg/ml plate-bound OKT3, 10 nm TPA and, where appropriate, 2 μm ionomycin. The concentration of IL-2 in the supernatants was quantified by sandwich ELISA. IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) expression was determined through flow cytometry by directly staining cells with human IL-2Rα mAb, clone 7G7/B6 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) and FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG Ab (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Cell viability was assessed by staining dead cells with 2 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) (Sigma). Mixed Lymphocyte Reaction—Splenocytes from C57Bl/6 (H-2b) mice at 2 × 106 cells were incubated with nifedipine for 1 h at 37 °C. C57Bl/6 splenocytes were then stimulated with 2000R-irradiated stimulator splenocytes at 4 × 106 cells from allogeneic Balb/c (H-2d) or syngeneic C57Bl/6 (H-2b) mice for 5 to 6 d at 37 °C with nifedipine remaining in the culture medium. Splenocytes were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mm glutamine, 50 nm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 100 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin. Proliferation was evaluated by using a flow cytometer-based bead assay as previously described (28Carlow D.A. Corbel S.Y. Ziltener H.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In Vivo Proliferation Assay—Thymocytes from C57Bl/6 female mice bearing a Tg TCRαβ receptor specific for the male antigen were loaded with 5 μm 5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester (CFSE) (Molecular Probes) for 7 min at room temperature. 20–30 × 106 CFSE loaded Tg thymocytes were i.v. injected into the tail vein of female or male C57Bl/6 recipients, followed by one intraperitoneal injection of either vehicle control or 15 mg/kg nifedipine into the C57Bl/6 males 20–24 h later. Nifedipine was prepared as a 1 mg/ml stock solution, dissolved in PBS containing 5% ethanol and 1% Tween-80. 40 h after the initial i.v. injection, spleens were harvested and single cell suspensions were prepared. For cell staining, splenocytes were suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and labeled with PE-conjugated anti-CD8α mAb (BD Pharmingen) and biotin-conjugated anti-TCRα mAb, clone T3.70 (provided by Dr. Hung-sia Teh, UBC, Vancouver, Canada), which is specific for Tg TCRα. Cells were then stained with Cychrome conjugated-streptavidin, washed, and analyzed on a FACSCalibur cytometer (BD Biosciences). Proliferation of female H-Y-specific TCRαβ receptor CD8+ T cells in vivo was quantified by determining the percent total of gated viable, CFSE+, CD8+, and Tg TCRhigh cells in successive cell divisions using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). As a result of CFSE labeling being distributed equally between daughter cells, a halving of cellular fluorescence intensity marked each successive cell division among proliferating cells. Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was determined by the ANOVA test, using two-factorial design without replication. For all tests, p < 0.01 was considered to indicate statistical significance. All standard errors shown represent the S.D. L-Type Ca2+ Channel Transcript Is Expressed in T Lymphocytes—Nifedipine has been shown to antagonize Ca2+ influx through l-type Ca2+ channels. Since previous studies reported that nifedipine interfered with T lymphocyte proliferation we sought to demonstrate the expression of an L-type Ca2+ channel in T lymphocytes. Using a nested RT-PCR based assay a PCR product specific to the pore-forming α1F-subunit of an L-type VDCC was amplified from T lymphocytes (Fig. 1A). Human retina and Weri-Rb1 retinoblastoma cDNAs were used as positive controls for the PCR assay since the α1F-subunit gene, CACNA1F, was first cloned from human retina and is highly expressed in this tissue (29Strom T.M. Nyakatura G. Apfelstedt-Sylla E. Hellebrand H. Lorenz B. Weber B.H. Wutz K. Gutwillinger N. Ruther K. Drescher B. Sauer C. Zrenner E. Meitinger T. Rosenthal A. Meindl A. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 30Bech-Hansen N.T. Naylor M.J. Maybaum T.A. Pearce W.G. Koop B. Fishman G.A. Mets M. Musarella M.A. Boycott K.M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 264-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). In the initial studies examining α1F-subunit gene expression, the α1F-subunit mRNA was not detected in lymphoblastoid tissue (29Strom T.M. Nyakatura G. Apfelstedt-Sylla E. Hellebrand H. Lorenz B. Weber B.H. Wutz K. Gutwillinger N. Ruther K. Drescher B. Sauer C. Zrenner E. Meitinger T. Rosenthal A. Meindl A. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The expression may have been overlooked by the lack of a nested RT-PCR-based assay. Using nucleotide sequencing, we were able to confirm that the ∼180 bp amplified PCR product from Jurkat T cells, human spleen, PBTs, CD4+, and CD8+ T lymphocytes shares 100% nucleotide identity to the L-type Ca2+ channel α1F-subunit gene expressed in human retina and Weri-Rb1 retinoblastoma (Fig. 1B). The α1F-subunit is not expressed ubiquitously in human cells since we were not able to detect α1F-subunit expression in normal human liver. Induction of Ca2+ Influx in Jurkat T Cell Leukemia Line and Human PBTs by L-Type Ca2+ Channel Agonist, (+/-) Bay K 8644 —To demonstrate that L-type Ca2+ channels contribute to Ca2+ entry, we tested the effect of the DHP derivative, (+/-) Bay K 8644, on Ca2+ influx in human T lymphocytes. It has previously been reported that the treatment of Jurkat T cells with Bay K 8644 in the range of 0.01–100 μm induces a small rise in intracellular Ca2+, indicating the presence of a DHP-sensitive Ca2+ influx pathway in these cells (31Young W. Chen J. Jung F. Gardner P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 34: 239-244PubMed Google Scholar). However, the report did not specify which enantiomer of Bay K 8644 was used. Since levo- and dextro-rotatory enantiomers of Bay K 8644 can induce opposing L-type VDCC activity, the experiment was repeated in this study with (+/-) Bay K 8644, a racemic mixture that has the net effect of enhancing Ca2+ influx through L-type Ca2+ channels (32Barger S.W. Neuroscience. 1999; 89: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Additionally, we wanted to directly compare the effects of (+/-) Bay K 8644 treatment on Ca2+ influx in Jurkat T cells to the untransformed PBTs since this has not been previously examined. When indo-1-loaded Jurkat T cells and human PBTs were treated with (+/-) Bay K 8644, a dose-dependent increase in the mean ratio of indo-1 bound to Ca2+ (405 nm)/free indo-1 (485 nm) was observed indicating an increase in intracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 2). In both Jurkat T cells and PBTs, 10 μm (+/-) Bay K 8644 induced a small, sustained rise in intracellular Ca2+. However, treatment of Jurkat T cells and PBTs with higher concentrations of (+/-) Bay K 8644 induced different responses in Ca2+ influx. In Jurkat T cells, 50 and 100 μm (+/-) Bay K 8644 induced a sustained increase in cytosolic Ca2+ (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, treatment of human PBTs with either 50 or 100 μm (+/-) Bay K 8644 caused a transient Ca2+ influx that rapidly declined to below"

For instance, the Shank PDZ domain binds to the C termini of guanylate kinase-associated proteins, which in turn interact with the guanylate kinase domain of postsynaptic density-95 scaffolding proteins. Here we describe the crystal structures of Shank1 PDZ in its peptide free form and in complex with the C-terminal hexapeptide (EAQTRL) of guanylate kinase-associated protein (GKAP1a) determined at 1.8- and 2.25-Å resolutions, respectively. The structure shows the typical class I PDZ interaction of PDZ-peptide complex with the consensus sequence -X-(Thr/Ser)-X-Leu. In addition, Asp-634 within the Shank1 PDZ domain recognizes the positively charged Arg at –1 position and hydrogen bonds, and salt bridges between Arg-607 and the side chains of the ligand at –3 and –5 positions contribute further to the recognition of the peptide ligand. Remarkably, whether free or complexed, Shank1 PDZ domains form dimers with a conserved βB/βC loop and N-terminal βA strands, suggesting a novel model of PDZ-PDZ homodimerization. This implies that antiparallel dimerization through the N-terminal βA strands could be a common configuration among PDZ dimers. Within the dimeric structure, the two-peptide binding sites are arranged so that the N termini of the bound peptide ligands are in close proximity and oriented toward the 2-fold axis of the dimer.

It has been suggested that Shank links N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-PSD-95 complexes to the actin cytoskeleton, thereby playing a critical role in the organization of cytoskeletal signaling complexes at excitatory synapses (1Sheng M.

The three known members of the Shank family (Shank1–3) all contain multiple sites for alternative splicing and show distinct tissue distributions (2Boeckers T.M. Bockmann J. Kreutz M.R. Gundelfinger E.D. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 903-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Although shank proteins vary in molecular mass, they share a common domain organization consisting of seven N-terminal ankyrin repeats followed by an SH3 domain, a PDZ domain, a long proline-rich region, and a SAM domain. All of these motifs are potentially involved in protein-protein interactions. For instance, the proline-rich region commonly acts as a binding site for SH3, EVH1, and WW domains and SAM domains can bind to each other in homomeric and heteromeric fashion, enabling oligomerization of Shank and its interacting proteins (3Naisbitt S.

The Shank PDZ domain is a class I PDZ recognizing the C-terminal sequence X-(Thr/Ser)-X-Leu (where X represents any amino acid), which enables it to bind a variety of integral membrane proteins; however, it most specifically binds to the C terminus of GKAP, which in turn interacts with the guanylate kinase domain of PSD-95 (5Yao I.

These interactions may be involved in the synaptic targeting and cytoskeletal attachment of receptors, linking them physically and functionally to the appropriate intracellular signaling pathways (5Yao I.

In addition, an interaction between the Shank PDZ and the C-terminal PDZ binding motif and leucine zipper domain of βPIX was reported recently (6Park E. Na M. Choi J. Kim S. Lee J.R. Yoon J. Park D.

The aim of the present study was to better understand the structural mechanism of the interaction between the Shank1 PDZ and its target protein. To that end, we determined the crystal structures of the Shank1 PDZ domain in its peptide-free form and in complex with the C-terminal hexapeptide of GKAP to resolutions of 1.8 and 2.25 Å, respectively. Protein Purification and Crystallization—Recombinant Shank1 PDZ (residues 584–690) from Rattus novergicus with a cleavable glutathione S-transferase tag was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) and then purified and crystallized as described previously (10Park S.H.

The C-terminal hexapeptide (EAQTRL) of GKAP used for PDZ-peptide cocrystallization was chemically synthesized (Anygen). Data Collection—A MAD data set was collected from a peptide-free frozen crystal to a resolution of 1.8 Å using an ADSC Quantum 4R CCD detector at beamline 18B at the Photon Factory. Because bromine is a convenient anomalous scatterer for MAD phasing, a bromine MAD data set was collected from a single crystal crystallized in a solution containing 200 mm NaBr (11Dauter Z. Dauter M. Rajashankar K.R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 232-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The diffraction data from a PDZ-peptide complex to a resolution of 2.25 Å were collected at 100 K at beamline 6B of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory. Structure Determination and Refinement—The structure of the peptide-free PDZ domain was determined by MAD phasing using bromine as an anomalous scatterer. The positions of three bromines within the asymmetric unit were located and refined using the program SOLVE (12Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). The initial phases were improved by solvent flattening using the program RESOLVE (overall figure of merit, 0.52) (13Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The resultant map, showing a dimer in an asymmetric unit, was readily interpretable. Model building then proceeded using the program O (14Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar), after which the structure was refined using the program CNS (15Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). The final crystallographic R value for the peptide-free PDZ model, calculated using data from 27.7–1.8 Å, was 23.4% (Rfree = 25.1%). Using the structure of the peptide-free PDZ dimer served as a starting model, the structure of the PDZ-hexapeptide complex was determined by molecular replacement methods with the program MOLREP (16Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4153) Google Scholar). There were two PDZ domains related by non-crystallographic 2-fold symmetry within the asymmetric unit. After applying a simulated annealing procedure using data to 2.25 Å, the locations of the two bound peptides were determined from a Fo – Fc difference electron density map. The electron densities for all of the six residues of the peptide ligands were obvious, indicating that they were well ordered within the structure. The hexapeptide was modeled using program O, after which the ligand-bound PDZ domain was refined to a final crystallographic R value of 25.1% and a free R value of 28.0%. The refined model of the peptide-bound PDZ domain consisted of a PDZ dimer related by a non-crystallographic 2-fold axis, two hexapeptides, and 44 water molecules. The stereochemistry of the model was analyzed with PROCHECK (17Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Overall Structure of the Shank1 PDZ Domain—The Shank1 PDZ monomer is a compact, globular domain containing eight segments of secondary structure: six β strands that form an antiparallel β barrel and two α helices (Fig. 1A). The amino acid sequences of all of the Shank protein PDZ domains are nearly identical but differ significantly from other PDZ domains (Fig. 1B) (18Boeckers T.M. Kreutz M.R. Winter C. Zuschratter W. Smalla K.H. Sanmarti-Vila L. Wex H. Langnaese K. Bockmann J. Garner C.C. Gundelfinger E.D. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6506-6518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lim S. Naisbitt S. Yoon J. Hwang J.I. Suh P.G. Sheng M. Kim E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29510-29518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of the rat Shank1 PDZ domain (residues 582–690) used in this study is identical to the human domain and shares 88 and 77% sequence identity with the PDZ domains of rat Shank2 and Shank3, respectively. The overall fold of the Shank1 PDZ shows the highest degree of structural variation of any known PDZ (Fig. 1C). In addition, the Shank1 PDZ contains exceptionally long N-terminal βA and C-terminal βF strands, which span more >11 residues each and participate in antiparallel β sheet interactions. The βA strand is twisted and participates in dimeric interaction by forming an antiparallel β sheet with the βA strand of the other monomer (Fig. 1C). The PDZ domain segment that displays the most conformational variation is the loop connecting the βB and βC strands. The Shank1 PDZ contains the longest known βB/βC loop, spanning 19 residues. Despite the variability in the sequence and length of βB/βC loops, the sequence is strictly conserved among Shank PDZ domains. As is typical of most PDZ complexes, the peptide ligand is positioned within a groove between the βB strand and the αB helix, oriented as an additional strand antiparallel to βB. Within the crystal structure of the complex, all six amino acid residues of the peptide ligand were well defined as shown by the difference electron density map calculated without inclusion of the peptide. Superposition of the structures of the peptide-free and peptide-bound PDZ domain shows that there is little conformational change upon ligand binding. The Cα root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation between two models is only 0.69 Å. Structural Basis for the Specificity of the Shank1 PDZ-GKAP Interaction—PDZ domains typically bind to the last several residues at the C terminus of interacting proteins. Shank PDZ domains are known to bind to the C-terminal six residues of GKAP1a, which in turn associates with the guanylate kinase domain of PSD-95 (20Kim E. Naisbitt S. Hsueh Y.P. Rao A. Rothschild A. Craig A.M. Sheng M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 669-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Although they recognize the typical consensus sequence X-(Thr/Ser)-X-Leu and are classified as type I PDZ domains, Shank PDZ domains show higher specificity for the GKAP C-terminal EAQTRL sequence. The interaction with GKAP is reportedly specific for the Shank PDZ, because GKAP1a (residues 591–666) does not associate with the other class I PDZ domains (e.g. those of PSD-95, Chapsyn-110/PSD-93, or calmodulin-dependent serine kinase) (3Naisbitt S. Kim E. Tu J.C. Xiao B. Sala C. Valtschanoff J. Weinberg R.J. Worley P.F. Sheng M. Neuron. 1999; 23: 569-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Moreover, the C-terminal tail of Kv1.4 (ETDV) does not bind the Shank PDZ, even though it interacts with the PDZ domains of PSD-95 (3Naisbitt S. Kim E. Tu J.C. Xiao B. Sala C. Valtschanoff J. Weinberg R.J. Worley P.F. Sheng M. Neuron. 1999; 23: 569-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). The Shank PDZ domain is thus optimized for recognition of GKAP, even though it marginally binds other ligands via the consensus sequence. Within the crystal structure, the peptide ligand EAQTRL inserts into the binding pocket antiparallel to the βB strand, forming an extensive network of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 2, A and B). The GFGF sequence in the carboxylate binding loop of the Shank1 PDZ forms hydrogen bonds with the carboxyl group of the GKAP peptide C terminus in a manner similar to that seen previously in PDZ-ligand complexes. The backbone amides of Phe-602, Gly-603, and Phe-604 of the carboxylate binding loop are involved in hydrogen bonding with the C terminus of the ligand, whereas the side chain of Leu-0 enters the deep hydrophobic cavity formed by Phe-602, Phe-604, Leu-606, and Ile-670. Instead of the side chain of the penultimate residue of the ligand being oriented toward the solvent, the Shank1 PDZ interacts directly with the –1 position of the ligand (Fig. 2B). The carboxyl group of Asp634 located at the end of the βC strand forms a salt bridge with the guanido group of Arg–1. To do so, the long side chain of Arg–1 twists at the Cβ atom toward Asp634. Sequence alignment shows that Asp634 is strictly conserved among all of the Shank proteins characterized so far (rat Shank1–3 and human Shank1 and Shank2). Moreover, all of the known GKAP family proteins (GKAP/SAP90/PSD-95-associated protein 1–4) terminate with the same four amino acids (–QTRL) (21Takeuchi M. Hata Y. Hirao K. Toyoda A. Irie M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11943-11951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that a positively charged residue is greatly preferred at ligand position –1 because it directly contributes to the specificity of the PDZ-ligand interaction. Consistent with that idea, substituting Arg–1 with Glu significantly reduced the affinity of the interaction (3Naisbitt S. Kim E. Tu J.C. Xiao B. Sala C. Valtschanoff J. Weinberg R.J. Worley P.F. Sheng M. Neuron. 1999; 23: 569-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). The preference for a positively charged residue at the –1 position was previously reported in the NHERF PDZ1-cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance interaction where Glu43 serves a function equivalent to that of Asp634 in the Shank PDZ (22Karthikeyan S. Leung T. Ladias J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19683-19686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In addition, Erbin PDZ domain selectively accommodates ligands with a bulky hydrophobic side chain of tryptophan residue at the –1 position, revealing the contribution of penultimate residues to the optimal binding of the ligands (23Laura R.P. Witt A.S. Held H.A. Gerstner R. Deshayes K. Koehler M.F. Kosik K.S. Sidhu S.S. Lasky L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12906-12914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In class I PDZ domains, serine or threonine at the –2 position of the ligand forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of residues at the start of helix αB. Likewise, within the Shank PDZ-ligand complex, the threonine residue at ligand position –2 contributes to the specificity by hydrogen bonding with His663 at αB1 (Fig. 2B). The ligand residues at the –3 and –5 positions also appear to contribute to the specificity and affinity of the interaction. Involvement of the residues at the –3 position in the PDZ-ligand interaction was reported in diverse types of PDZ domains (22Karthikeyan S. Leung T. Ladias J.A. J. Biol.

In Shank PDZ domain, the guanido group of Arg607 in the βB strand is positioned within the groove formed by the protrusions of the side chains of Gln–3 and Glu–5. The Oϵ atom of Gln–3 forms hydrogen bonds with the Arg607guanido group, and Glu–5 interacts both with the side chain of Arg607 and the hydroxyl group of Tyr629. This means that the presence of Arg607 may further stabilize the interaction by hydrogen bonding with the hydrophilic residues at positions –3 and –5, even though interactions at those positions are not essential for ligand binding.

And in some cases, such multimerization is mediated by the PDZ domains (31Xu X.Z. Choudhury A. Li X. Montell C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 32Lau A.G.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6930-6941Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, this was recently seen in the crystal structure of GRIP PDZ6, which shows a tightly associated dimer (34Im Y.J. Park S.H. Rho S.H. Lee J.H. Kang G.B. Sheng M. Kim E. Eom S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8501-8507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In Shank proteins, the SAM domain reportedly multimerizes, which is sufficient for self-association of full-length Shank proteins; however, the present study shows that the PDZ domain also contributes to the multimerization of Shank proteins, suggesting structural conservation of a dimerization mode mediated by PDZ domains. The crystal structures revealed tightly associated dimers in the asymmetric units of both the peptide free and peptide bound crystals, which belong to the P21 and P41212 space groups, respectively (Fig. 2C). Each asymmetric unit contained two molecules forming a dimer with non-crystallographic 2-fold symmetry. Cross-linking experiments and size-exclusion chromatography confirmed the Shank1 PDZ to be a dimer in solution (Fig. 2, D and E). That the Shank1 PDZ domain has the ability to form a dimer whether it is free or complexed with a ligand suggests the dimer may represent the functional state of the Shank PDZ domain. The interface between dimeric PDZ domains involves a βA strand and a βB/βC loop from each monomer (Fig. 3, A and C). The βA strands form antiparallel β-sheets around the center of a 2-fold axis so that the N and C termini of each PDZ domain point in opposite directions. The amount of surface area buried upon dimer formation is 611.6 Å2 or 9.5% of the total surface area of each monomer, which implies the existence of specific contacts between the two monomers that may have biological significance. The dimeric interface is composed of 64.9% of non-polar atoms and 35.0% of polar atoms. Within the dimer, the monomers are held tightly by six hydrogen bonds, four water-bridged hydrogen bonds, and numerous van der Waals interactions. All of the six hydrogen bonds originate from backbone atoms in the βA strands forming the antiparallel β-sheet. In contrast, mostly side chain atoms in the βB/βC loops, which comprises 41% of the interface area, participate in the hydrophobic interactions at the interface. That residues 613–625 in the otherwise variable βB-βC loop are strictly conserved in all of the Shank proteins identified so far implies a potential role for the βB/βC loop in both dimerization and protein-protein interactions. Recently, the crystal structure of Erbin PDZ·ErbB2 complex revealed the important function of the loop βB-βC in ligand interactions, implying the possibility that the variable loop βB-βC could be exploited for the specific function of the PDZ domain (24Birrane G. Chung J. Ladias J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1399-1402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Similar to Shank PDZ, GRIP PDZ6 dimerizes by forming antiparallel β-sheets with N-terminal βA strands (Fig. 3, A and B), although the configurations of the βA strands differ in the two dimers (34Im Y.J. Park S.H. Rho S.H. Lee J.H. Kang G.B. Sheng M. Kim E. Eom S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8501-8507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Shank PDZ has a longer more twisted βA strand, and half of the strand is involved in the β-sheet interaction causing the peptide binding pockets to be oriented differently. In both dimers, the peptide binding pockets are located at the distal sides of the complex and oriented in antiparallel fashion. In the Shank PDZ dimer, however, the N termini of the ligands are oriented toward the center so that they are in close proximity around the 2-fold axis of the dimer (Fig. 3A). Biological Implications of Shank PDZ Dimer—Shank proteins have a SAM domain at their C terminus, which can mediate oligomerization of the proteins. Sharpin, which interacts with Shank anykrin repeats, has a coiled-coil domain that contributes to the multimeric association of the Shank-Sharpin complex (35Lim S. Sala C. Yoon J. Park S. Kuroda S. Sheng M. Kim E. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2001; 17: 385-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Notably, the crystal structure of the Shank1 PDZ domain suggests that the dimeric configuration of the PDZ domain may facilitate multimeric organization of Shank proteins. Although multimeric association of GKAP and Shank PDZ has yet to be reported, the interaction of βPIX and Shank PDZ provides some insight to the biological significance of the Shank PDZ dimer. The Shank1 PDZ domain reportedly interacts with the C-terminal domain of βPIX, and the leucine zipper domain mediates the homodimerization of βPIX (6Park E. Na M. Choi J. Kim S. Lee J.R. Yoon J. Park D. Sheng M. Kim E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19220-19229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 36Kim S. Lee S.H. Park D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10581-10584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This means that both the C-terminal PDZ binding motif and the preceding leucine zipper domain of βPIX are involved in the interaction and that an additional interaction besides that taking place at the peptide binding pocket of the PDZ domain is involved in the binding of βPIX (6Park E. Na M. Choi J. Kim S. Lee J.R. Yoon J. Park D. Sheng M. Kim E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19220-19229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The leucine zipper motif commonly forms a coiled-coil homodimer of two α-helices terminating at their C termini with a 2-fold symmetry. Prediction of βPIX secondary structure indicates that six amino acid residues connect the C-terminal PDZ binding motif and the preceding leucine zipper helix (Fig. 3D). As mentioned above, the ligands binding to the PDZ are in close proximity around the 2-fold axis of the dimer. And given the strict conservation of the βB/βC loop among Shank proteins, there are few tertiary configurations available to the PDZ-βPIX complex. With that in mind, we propose a model of the Shank PDZ-βPIX C-terminal complex in which the C-terminal root of the leucine zipper domain interacts with the βB-βC loops at the center of PDZ dimer and the C-terminal tails are inserted into the peptide binding pockets (Fig. 3E). This model suggests that the novel surface interacting with the leucine zipper domain is the conserved βB/βC loop. Such a configuration is advantageous, because it would enable dimeric PDZ domains to efficiently colocalize with dimeric target proteins. We thank Professor N. Sakabe and Drs. M. Suzuki and N.

In this study, we have taken advantage of the potent mitogenic effect of thrombin and the focus-forming activity of one of its receptors, protease-activated receptor-1, to dissect how this receptor coupled to Gαi, Gαq/11, and Gα12/13 transduces signals from the membrane to the nucleus to initiate transcriptional events involved in cell transformation. Using endogenous and transfected thrombin receptors in NIH 3T3 cells, ectopic expression of muscarinic receptors coupled to Gαq and Gαi, and chimeric G protein α subunits and murine fibroblasts deficient in Gαq/11, and Gα12/13, we show here that, although coupling to Gαi is sufficient to induce ERK activation, the ability to couple to Gαq and/or Gα13 is necessary to induce c-jun expression and cell transformation. Furthermore, we show that Gαq and Gα13 can initiate the activation of MAPK cascades, including JNK, p38, and ERK5, which in turn regulate the activity of transcription factors controlling expression from the c-jun promoter. We also present evidence that c-Jun and the kinases regulating its expression are integral components of the transforming pathway initiated by protease-activated receptor-1.

We also present evidence that c-Jun and the kinases regulating its expression are integral components of the transforming pathway initiated by protease-activated receptor-1. Growth factors acting on cell-surface receptors possessing an intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity can initiate the activation of multiple intracellular signaling pathways, which in turn control key biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, and migration and cell fate decisions (reviewed in Ref. 1van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar). Subtle alterations in the normal activity of these tyrosine kinase receptors or their intracellular down-stream targets can have dramatic biological consequences, as they may promote the aberrant growth and survival of tumor cells (for review, see Ref. 2Aaronson S.A.

Cell. 1986; 45: 711-719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), provided the first evidence that heptahelical receptors can also harbor transforming potential. GPCRs represent the largest family of cell-surface receptors, and they regulate intracellular signaling pathways primarily by interacting with heterotrimeric G proteins composed of α, β, and γ subunits. Upon receptor activation, there is a conformational change that promotes the exchange of GDP bound to the α subunit for GTP and the release of βγ dimers, thereby initiating a series of signaling events that culminate in a wide variety of cellular responses (4Hamm H.E.

Furthermore, paracrine and autocrine stimulation of GPCRs by tumor-released agonists has been implicated in different types of neoplasias such as small cell lung carcinoma and prostate and gastric cancer (for review, see Refs. 9Marinissen M.J.

Using a retroviral expression library approach to identify novel oncogenes from a mouse myeloid progenitor cell line, Whitehead et al. (11Whitehead I. Kirk H. Kay R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 704-710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) identified several independent cDNAs encoding murine PAR-1, a thrombin-stimulated GPCR. Thrombin is a serine protease that exerts multiple physiological effects (12Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar). Among them, the best known function of thrombin is its key role in blood coagulation. In addition, thrombin can act on many cell types, eliciting a large variety of cellular responses, including the regulation of cell proliferation and invasion and tumor growth (13O'Brien P.J. Molino M. Kahn M. Brass L.F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1570-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 14Van Obberghen-Schilling E. Vouret-Craviari V. Chen Y.H. Grall D. Chambard J.C. Pouyssegur J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 766: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). At least three receptors for thrombin, PAR-1, PAR-3, and PAR-4, have been cloned thus far and found to belong to the GPCR superfamily (12Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar). Rather than being a direct agonist for these receptors, thrombin acts by cleaving an Arg–Ser bond in their N-terminal extracellular domain, thereby generating a new N terminus that functions as a tethered agonist. The potent transforming potential of PAR-1 suggests that its deregulated expression can promote the aberrant activation of growth-promoting pathways. This receptor is known to couple effectively to the Gαi, Gαq, and Gα13 families of G protein α subunits (reviewed in Ref. 12Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar). Indeed, activated forms of the Gαq and Gα13 families can themselves transform NIH 3T3 cells (15Kalinec G. Nazarali A.J. Hermouet S. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4687-4693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Xu N. Bradley L. Ambdukar I. Gutkind J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6741-6745Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), supporting that at least these G proteins and their coupled receptors can promote cell-transforming pathways. Of interest, thrombin can potently induce the nuclear expression of members of the AP1 transcription factor family (17Trejo J. Chambard J.C. Karin M. Brown J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4742-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), which is composed of members of the Jun and Fos families of nuclear proteins that bind as Jun dimers or Jun-Fos heterodimers to DNA sequences known as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response elements on the regulatory region of target genes, thereby enhancing or inhibiting their expression (18Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3262) Google Scholar, 19Shaulian E. Karin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E131-E136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2205) Google Scholar). In particular, thrombin can induce the rapid expression of the c-jun proto-oncogene (17Trejo J. Chambard J.C. Karin M. Brown J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4742-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), which is a critical molecule in the regulation of cell proliferation and neoplastic transformation (18Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3262) Google Scholar, 19Shaulian E. Karin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E131-E136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2205) Google Scholar, 20Kovary K. Bravo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4466-4472Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). However, the nature of the intracellular signaling route by which thrombin stimulates c-jun expression and whether its protein product, c-Jun, contributes to the transforming ability of PAR-1 are still unknown. In this study, we have explored the molecular mechanisms by which endogenously expressed or overexpressed thrombin receptors can transduce signals from the membrane into nuclear events participating in cell transformation. For this work, we have used endogenous and transfected thrombin receptors, ectopic expression of muscarinic receptors coupled to Gαq and Gαi (m1 and m2, respectively), and chimeric G protein α subunits and murine fibroblasts deficient in Gαq/11 and Gα12/13. We show here that, although coupling to Gαi is sufficient to induce ERK activation, the ability to couple to Gαq and/or Gα13 is necessary to induce c-jun expression and cell transformation. Furthermore, we show that Gαq and Gα13 can initiate the activation of MAPK cascades regulating the activity of transcription factors controlling the activity of the c-jun promoter. We also present evidence that c-Jun and kinases regulating its expression are integral components of the transforming pathways initiated by PAR-1. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% calf serum. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts from wild-type and Gαq/11 and Gα12/13 knockout animals were kept in the same media supplemented with 1 mm sodium pyruvate and nonessential amino acids. A plasmid encoding a luciferase gene driven by a murine wild-type c-jun promoter, pJLuc, was kindly provided by R. Prywes (21Han T.H. Prywes R. Mol. Cell.

Plasmids pJC6, pJC9, pJTX, pJSX, and pJSTX are pBLCAT3-based reporter constructs carrying a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene controlled by the murine full-length c-jun promoter and its mutants, as previously described (22Han T.H.

A pGL3 reporter plasmid (Promega) containing the jAP1 (TGACATCA) and MEF2 (CTATTTTTAG) sites from the murine c-jun promoter, designated pjAP1-MEF2, was engineered by inserting the oligonucleotide sequence 5′-GTACCGTCGACTCGGGGTGACATCATGGGCTATTTTTAGGGAGATC-3′ as an Asp718/BglII fragment upstream of an SV40 minimal promoter and a luciferase gene. Reporter plasmids with mutations in the jAP1 (pjAP1m-MEF2) or MEF2 (pjAP1-MEF2m) site and a double mutant (pjAP1m-MEF2m) and a plasmid carrying two jAP1 sites were prepared following the same strategy.

Cells were grown to 70% confluence in 10-cm plates and serum-starved for 20 h. They were left untreated (controls) or were treated with 1 mm carbachol or 5 units/ml thrombin for different times. After treatment, they were washed with cold PBS, and total RNA was extracted by homogenization in TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's specifications. For Northern blotting, 10–20 μg of total RNA was fractionated on 2% formaldehyde-agarose gels, transferred to nylon membranes, and hybridized with murine full-length 32P-labeled c-jun cDNA probe prepared using a Prime-a-Gene labeling system (Promega). Accuracy in gel loading and transfer was confirmed by fluorescence under UV light upon ethidium bromide staining. Luciferase Assays—Cells were transfected with different expression plasmids together with 0.1 μg of each reporter plasmid and 0.01 μg of pRL-null (a plasmid expressing luciferase from Renilla reniformis) as an internal control. In all cases, the total amount of plasmid DNA was adjusted with pcDNAIII-β-gal (a plasmid expressing β-galactosidase). Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities present in cell lysates were assayed using a dual-luciferase reporter system (Promega), and light emission was quantitated using a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory) as specified by the manufacturer. CAT Assays—NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with different expression plasmids together with 0.1 μg of each reporter plasmid and 0.5 μg of pcDNAIII-β-gal. After a 24-h incubation, cells were washed and lysed using reporter lysis buffer (Promega). CAT activity was assayed in cell extracts by incubation for 1 h in the presence of 0.25 μCi of [14C]chloramphenicol (100 mCi/mmol) and 200 μg/ml butyryl-CoA in 0.25 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). Labeled butyrylated products were extracted using a 1:2 mixture of xylenes and 2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane (Sigma), and incorporated radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation. Cells were seeded at 70–80% confluence and transfected with expression vectors for HA-tagged kinases alone or in combination with different upstream molecules. After transfection, cells were cultured for 24 h and incubated in serum-free medium overnight for ERK2 and ERK5 and for 2 h for JNK, p38α, and p38γ.

Cleared lysates containing HA-tagged kinases were immunoprecipitated at 4 °C for 2 h with anti-HA monoclonal antibody HA.11 (Berkeley Antibody Co.). Immunocomplexes were recovered with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Beads were washed three times with PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 2 mm vanadate, once with 100 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and 0.5 m LiCl, and once with kinase reaction buffer (12.5 mm MOPS (pH 7.5), 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm sodium fluoride, and 0.5 mm vanadate). Samples were resuspended in 30 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP/reaction and 20 μm unlabeled ATP. After 20 min at 30 °C, the reactions were terminated by addition of 10 μlof5× Laemmli buffer. In vitro kinase assays were performed using 1.5 μg/μl myelin basic protein (Sigma) for ERK2 and 1 μg of purified, bacterially expressed GST-ATF2 for JNK, p38α, and p38γ and GST-MEF2C for ERK5 as substrates, as indicated. Samples were analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis on 12% (or 15% for myelin basic protein) acrylamide gels, and autoradiography was performed with the aid of an intensifying screen. HA-tagged immunoprecipitates from transiently transfected NIH 3T3 cells carrying HA-MAPK, HA-JNK, HA-ERK5, HA-p38α, and HA-p38γ cDNAs were analyzed by Western blotting after SDS-PAGE using anti-HA monoclonal antibody HA.11. Gαq and Gα11 were detected by rabbit anti-Gαq/11 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Gα12 and Gα13 were detected by a mixture of anti-Gα12 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and anti-Gα13 antibody (33Xu N. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T. Gutkind J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Biosciences) using horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgGs as the secondary antibodies (Cappel). NIH 3T3 cells and these cells stably transfected with the m1 or m2 receptor were seeded on glass coverslips and transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent as described above. 24-h serum-starved cells were treated with 1 mm carbachol and 5 units/ml thrombin, washed twice with 1× PBS, and then fixed and permeabilized with 4% formaldehyde and 0.5% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS for 10 min. After washing with PBS, cells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin and incubated with the indicated primary antibodies for 1 h. c-Jun was detected using rabbit anti-c-Jun antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Following incubation, cells were washed three times with 1× PBS and incubated with the corresponding fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:200 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). Coverslips were washed three times and mounted in Vectashield mounting medium with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) and viewed using a Zeiss Axiophot photomicroscope equipped with epifluorescence. Immunofluorescence was photographed using Eastman Kodak TMAX 3200 film. NIH 3T3 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique with different expression plasmids together with 1 μg of pcDNAIII-β-gal, adjusting the total amount of plasmid DNA with empty vector. The day after transfection, cells were washed with medium supplemented with 5% calf serum and then maintained in the same medium until foci were scored, 2–3 weeks later. Duplicate plates were fixed with 1× PBS containing 2% (v/v) formaldehyde and 0.2% (v/v) glutaraldehyde and stained at 37 °C for β-galactosidase activity with 1× PBS containing 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm K3Fe(CN)6, 5 mm K4Fe(CN)6 and 0.1% 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) to evaluate the transfection efficiency. Human PAR-1 and m1, but Not m2, Harbor Oncogenic Potential—PAR-1, a GPCR activated by thrombin and other proteases (34Martin C.B. Mahon G.M. Klinger M.B. Kay R.J. Symons M. Der C.J. Whitehead I.P.

Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar), was cloned as an oncogene using an expression library approach (11Whitehead I. Kirk H. Kay R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 704-710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, as previously reported for the murine PAR-1 gene, human PAR-1 readily induced the appearance of foci of transformation after 2–3 weeks of culture, as shown in Fig. 1. Interestingly, PAR-1 was even more potent than a Gq-coupled receptor, the m1 muscarinic receptor, which transforms NIH 3T3 effectively when cells are cultured in the presence of the cholinergic agonist carbachol (8Gutkind J.S. Novotny E.A. Brann M.R. Robbins K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4703-4707Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In contrast, m2 receptors that are coupled to Gi proteins do not transform cells in culture, thus suggesting that Gαq and Gα13, but not Gαi, can stimulate transforming pathways in these murine fibroblasts. c-jun Expression Is Stimulated by Transforming GPCRs, and a Dominant Inhibitory Mutant of c-Jun Prevents Their Focus-forming Activity—To begin addressing the molecular mechanism underlying the transforming ability of these GPCRs, we first examined whether they could stimulate the ERK signaling route, a key component of cell growth-promoting pathways (36Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B.E. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3528) Google Scholar), using wild-type NIH 3T3 cells, which express PAR-1 endogenously, and the same cells stably transfected with the m1 or m2 receptor (NIH-m1 and NIH-m2 cells, respectively). As shown in Fig. 2, agonist addition to NIH 3T3 cells resulted in the potent activation of ERK. However, in repeated experiments, there were no remarkable differences in the strength and duration of the ERK signal elicited by transforming and non-transforming GPCRs, suggesting that the ability to stimulate ERK does not correlate with their transforming activity. In the search for the molecular mechanisms underlying the distinct biological activities of these GPCRs, we focused our attention on nuclear responses, in particular on the expression of the transcription factor c-Jun, the function of which has often been associated with malignant conversion (reviewed in Ref. 19Shaulian E. Karin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E131-E136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2205) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 (lower panels), activation of PAR-1 and m1 receptors induced the rapid accumulation of c-jun mRNA. Consistently, the expression of the c-Jun protein was also increased as revealed by the nuclear c-Jun immunostaining of thrombin- and carbachol-stimulated cells (Fig. 2B). Of interest, carbachol did not induce c-jun message or c-Jun protein expression in NIH-m2 cells, suggesting that only transforming GPCRs can stimulate this particular nuclear response. We next investigated whether the ability to trigger c-Jun expression and transformation by PAR-1 and the m1 receptor is two functionally related events. As shown in Fig. 3, transformation induced by these receptors was potently inhibited by the coexpression of a dominant-negative mutant form of c-Jun, c-Jun TAM67 (37Brown P.H. Alani R. Preis L.H.

We devised a novel assay that, combining the advantages of multiplex and real-time PCR, streamlines the quantitation of the actual mRNA copy numbers in whole-animal experiments. Quantitations reported establish differences among adult organs and embryonic stages, compare mRNA decay rates, explore the significance of alternative mRNA isoforms derived from TrxR1 and Grx2 genes, and examine the time-course expression upon superoxide stress promoted by paraquat. Collectively, these quantitations show: i) unique expression profiles for each transcript and mouse organ examined, yet with some general trends like the higher amounts of mRNA species coding for thioredoxins than those coding for the reductases that control their redox states and activities; ii) continuous expression during embryogenesis with outstanding up-regulations of Trx1 and TrxR1 mRNAs in specific temporal sequences; iii) drastic differences in mRNA stability, liver decay rates range from 2.8 h (thioredoxin/glutathione reductase) to ≥ 35 h (Trx1 and Trx2), and directly correlate with mRNA steady-state values; iv) testis-specific differences in the amounts (relative to total isoforms) of transcripts yielding the mitochondrial Grx2a and 67-kDa TrxR1 variants; and v) coordinated up-regulation of TrxR1 and glutathione reductase mRNAs in response to superoxide stress in an organ-specific manner. Further insights into in vivo roles of these redox systems should be gained from more focused studies of the mechanisms underlying the vast differences reported here at the transcript level.

Thioredoxin (Trx) 1The abbreviations used are: Trx, thioredoxin; Grx, glutaredoxin; TrxR, thioredoxin reductase; GR, glutathione reductase; GSH, glutathione; TGR, thioredoxin/glutathione reductase; PQ, paraquat; AmD, actinomycin D; MPCR, multiplex polymerase chain reaction; E, embryonic day; ROS, reactive oxygen species; UTR, untranslated region; HEX, 4,7,2′,4′,5′,7′-hexachloro-6-carboxyfluorescein. and glutaredoxin (Grx) are ubiquitous proteins with redox-active cysteines. They were discovered as independent hydrogen donors for the essential enzyme ribonucleotide reductase. Subsequently, they were shown to be general thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases. Trx and Grx differ in their specific reductive pathways, although ultimately reducing equivalents come from NADPH. Thus, the Trx system is composed of NADPH, thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), and Trx; the Grx system of NADPH, glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione (GSH), and Grx (1Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The properties and multiple physiological functions assigned to these systems have been reviewed, particularly in relation to redox control of cell functions and protection against oxidative damage (2Arnér E.S. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6102-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (2001) Google Scholar, 3Holmgren A. Antioxid Redox Signal. 2000; 2: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Two Trxs have been described in mammals, one predominantly cytosolic (Trx1) (4Tagaya Y. Maeda Y. Mitsui A. Kondo N. Matsui H. Hamuro J. Brown N. Arai K. Yokota T. Wakasugi H. Yodoi J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 757-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) and one mitochondrial (Trx2) (5Spyrou G. Enmark E. Miranda-Vizuete A. Gustafsson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2936-2941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The cytosolic Trx1 performs many biological actions in defense against oxidative stress, regulation of gene expression, and control of growth and apoptosis, and it has also been implicated in many pathological situations including cancer (6Powis G. Montfort W.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 261-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Trx1 and Trx2 are composed of only a thioredoxin domain (6Powis G. Montfort W.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 261-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). A second group of proteins with additional domains, like the spermatid-specific thioredoxins Sptrx1 and Sptrx2, have been also identified within the thioredoxin family (7Sadek C.M. Damdimopoulos A.E. Pelto-Huikko M. Gustafsson J.A. Spyrou G. Miranda-Vizuete A. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 1077-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Grxs are regarded as reductants of disulfides via GSH controlling also the levels of GSH-mixed disulfides, particularly under conditions of oxidative stress (3Holmgren A. Antioxid Redox Signal. 2000; 2: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Like Trxs, Grxs are being implicated in a growing list of pivotal functions such as cellular differentiation (8Takashima Y. Hirota K. Nakamura H. Nakamura T. Akiyama K. Cheng F.S. Maeda M. Yodoi J. Immunol. Lett. 1999; 68: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), apoptosis (9Chrestensen C.A. Starke D.W. Mieyal J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26556-26565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), and regulation of transcription factor binding activity (10Bandyopadhyay S. Starke D.W. Mieyal J.J. Gronostajski R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 392-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Nowadays two different isoenzymes of mammalian Grxs have been described, the classical cytosolic enzyme (Grx1) and a novel mitochondrial protein (Grx2) with alternative splice variants (11Lundberg M. Johansson C. Chandra J. Enoksson M. Jacobsson G. Ljung J. Johansson M. Holmgren A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 30374-30380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). A single gene for GR has been described in mammals. However, mammalian GR was shown to possess a mitochondrial signal peptide, allowing it to be directed to mitochondria (13Tamura T. McMicken H.W. Smith C.V. Hansen T.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 419-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 14Kelner M.J. Montoya M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 269: 366-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Likewise, GSH is present in the mitochondria, accounting for ∼10% of the cellular GSH pool (15Sies H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 916-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial GR and GSH together with Grx2 may therefore play a critical role in protecting this organelle from ROS generated in the respiratory chain (11Lundberg M. Johansson C. Chandra J. Enoksson M. Jacobsson G. Ljung J. Johansson M. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26269-26275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Mammalian TrxRs are homologous to GR and have a C-terminal elongation containing a conserved catalytically active selenocysteine residue in the penultimate position (16Zhong L. Arnér E.S. Ljung J. Åslund F. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8581-8591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Mammalian TrxRs reduce not only protein disulphides such as that in oxidized Trx but also a wide variety of other disulphide and non-disulfide substrates, even H2O2 and lipid hydroperoxides (3Holmgren A. Antioxid Redox Signal. 2000; 2: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Three isoenzymes of mammalian TrxRs have been described (17Sun Q.A. Wu Y. Zappacosta F. Jeang K.T. Lee B.J. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24522-24530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). TrxR1 (also called TRα and TR1) is designed as the dominant cytosolic enzyme (18Gasdaska P.Y. Gasdaska J.R. Cochran S. Powis G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 19Kawai H. Ota T. Suzuki F. Tatsuka M. Gene. 2000; 242: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). TrxR1 exhibits extensive heterogeneity. In particular, a 67-kDa isoform with an additional N-terminal sequence has been identified (20Sun Q.A. Zappacosta F. Factor V.M. Wirth P.J. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3106-3114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). TrxR2 (TRβ and TR3) is referred to as the mitochondrial type (19Kawai H. Ota T. Suzuki F. Tatsuka M. Gene. 2000; 242: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 21Miranda-Vizuete A. Damdimopoulos A.E. Spyrou G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1447: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 22Gasdaska P.Y. Berggren M.M. Berry M.J. Powis G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). TrxR2 together with Trx2 compose a mitochondrial Trx system, different from the one present in the cytosol. The third isoenzyme was initially described as a novel form of TrxR (or TR2) (17Sun Q.A. Wu Y. Zappacosta F. Jeang K.T. Lee B.J. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24522-24530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Later, this new selenoprotein oxidoreductase was designated thioredoxin/glutathione reductase (TGR) for thioredoxin and glutathione reductase. TGR can reduce several components of both Trx and Grx systems. This unusual substrate specificity is achieved by a natural fusion of TrxR and Grx domains (23Sun Q.A. Kirnarsky L. Sherman S. Gladyshev V.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3673-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). This work aimed the simultaneous analysis of the expression of genes coding for proteins of mouse Trx and Grx pathways. Control of mRNA levels is crucial in regulating protein production in mammalian cells. Hence, the exhaustive investigation of the in vivo status of mRNA levels should provide valuable information for understanding the functional roles of the four redoxins (2 Trxs and 2 Grxs) and four reductases (2 TrxRs, TGR, and GR) presently known in mouse. Nowadays, reverse transcription followed by PCR is the most powerful tool for detection and quantitation of mRNAs. Herein, we report the combined use of multiplex and real-time PCR procedures for rigorous quantitation of the real number of mRNA molecules. We wanted to know how the organ context, gestational age, alternative splicing, turnover rate, and oxidizing stress conditions modulate the absolute expression patterns of investigated transcripts. Whole-animal experiments were performed for these purposes. Animals and Treatments—Male BALB/c mice of 7 weeks of age were from Charles River Laboratories. After a 3-day acclimation period, animals were divided into groups of 3 subjects. Mice were stressed by intraperitoneal injection with paraquat (PQ) at a dose of 30 mg kg-1 body weight dissolved in normal saline. For mRNA decay quantitations, mice were intraperitoneally injected with 2 mg kg-1 body weight of actinomycin D (AmD) dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline. Animals injected with saline solution or phosphate-buffered saline served as vehicle controls. Total RNA was extracted at the times indicated in figures. Basal expression levels were determined in non-injected mice. Animals were killed by cervical dislocation. The organs were then removed and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Mice were handled according to the norms stipulated by the European Community. The investigation was approved by the Ethical Committee of Córdoba University. Mean ± S.E. values were calculated by averaging data from each experimental group. RNA Preparations and Reverse Transcription—RNA extraction and synthesis of standard RNA and of cDNA were as detailed (24Prieto-Álamo M.J. Cabrera-Luque J.M. Pueyo C. Gene Expr. 2003; 11: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Commercial RNAs were from Clontech, except those of ovary total RNA from Ambion. RNA sample quality was checked electrophoretically, and quantification was done spectrophotometrically. Lack of DNA contamination was checked by PCR amplification of RNA samples without prior cDNA synthesis. Primer Design—Sequences of genes were taken from GenBank™ for primer design. Primers were made with Oligo 6.1.1/98 (Molecular Biology Insights) program. To obtain the highest specificity and performance, primers were required to have high Tm (≥82 °C) and optimal 3′ΔG (≥-8.4 kcal/mol) values. Two pairs of primers were designed for Grx2 and TrxR1 genes. Primers within exon 3 of Grx2 gene amplify all known types of alternative transcripts, whereas primers on exons 1 and 2 amplify only those transcripts (hereafter named Grx2a) with the mitochondrial signal sequence (12Gladyshev V.N. Liu A. Novoselov S.V. Krysan K. Sun Q.A. Kryukov V.M. Kryukov G.V. Lou M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30374-30380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Likewise, whereas primers within exons 9 and 10-11 of TrxR1 gene amplify all types of alternative splicing, amplification by primers on exon 3b and 4 was restricted to transcripts (TrxR1-III) encoding the 67-kDa isoform of mouse TrxR1 (20Sun Q.A.

Primers in Table I generate specific PCR products of the desired length and nucleotide sequence.Table IProperties of reverse transcriptase PCR amplicons used for absolute quantitation of mRNA Transcripts were quantitated by means of both multiplex and real-time PCRs, except for Grx2a and TrxR1-III mRNA isoforms. The standard was an engineered GAPDH cDNA with a 7 bp deletion, resulting in a PCR product of 130 bp. Exon numbers were according to NCBI Evidence Viewer, except those for Grx2 and Grx2a, and TrxR1 and TrxR1-III that were according to Refs. 12Gladyshev V.N. Liu A. Novoselov S.V. Krysan K. Sun Q.A.

Cabrera-Luque J.M. Pueyo C. Gene Expr. 2003; 11: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). PCR reactions were performed in quadruplicate. No primer-dimers were detected. Investigated transcripts showed optimal PCR efficiencies, in the range of 20 to 2 × 105 pg of total RNA input with high linearity (Table I). An absolute standard curve was constructed with an external standard in the range of 102 to 109 RNA molecules. The number of molecules was calculated from the linear regression of the standard curve (Table I). Real-time PCR technique was used to calculate the copy number of each examined transcript in the reference sample, the copy number of the reference transcript in each examined sample, and (in the indicated experiments) the copy number of Grx2a and TrxR1-III mRNA isoforms. Multiplex PCRs—Components of the reaction mixture were as described previously (26Pueyo C. Jurado J. Prieto-Álamo M.J. Monje-Casas F. López-Barea J. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 347: 441-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Primers were at 0.128 μm. MPCR conditions were optimized as detailed previously (26Pueyo C. Jurado J. Prieto-Álamo M.J. Monje-Casas F. López-Barea J. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 347: 441-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) to ensure that the amplifications were in the exponential phase and the efficiencies remained constant in the course of the PCR. Twenty-three cycles of PCR were performed. MPCR reactions were carried out in duplicate. Reaction products were quantitated as detailed previously (26Pueyo C. Jurado J. Prieto-Álamo M.J. Monje-Casas F. López-Barea J. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 347: 441-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), with the particularity that this time the reference was any of the investigated transcripts (typically TrxR2 mRNA). All transcripts (except Grx2a and TrxR1-III mRNAs) were amplified by MPCR in all samples. MPCR technique was used to calculate the ratio between the fluorescent signal strength (given by GeneScan electropherogram) of each PCR product and the signal strength of the reference in the same reaction. Then, by dividing the fluorescence ratios calculated in each examined sample by those given by the reference sample (typically liver from untreated mice), we obtained the fluorescence ratio variation (FV) values. Absolute measurements (mRNA molecules) were inferred from FV data, according to Equation 1, Ee=(FV×Re×Er)/Rr(Eq. 1) where Ee, Er, Re, and Rr designed the copy number of the examined (E) or reference (R) transcript, in the examined (e) or reference (r) sample, respectively. As outlined above, these values were obtained by real-time PCR. Samples for comparison of different experimental conditions were handled in parallel. Absolute Quantitation of mRNA Levels—We previously designed and optimized a reverse transcription-MPCR procedure in which all target transcripts and one reference are co-amplified in a single reaction. Specific fluorescent primers are used and amplification products are analyzed with a DNA sequencer. Relative expression of the targets to the reference is measured and relative comparisons of mRNA levels among different samples are made (26Pueyo C. Jurado J. Prieto-Álamo M.J. Monje-Casas F. López-Barea J. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 347: 441-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 27Gallardo-Madueño R. Leal J.F. Dorado G. Holmgren A. López-Barea J. Pueyo C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18382-18388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Trends in gene expression can be explained by relative quantitation, but the results are strongly dependent on the normalization procedure used. Actually, we have recently raised the question about the inaccuracy of relative quantitation in complex animal studies, and we have alternatively proposed the quantitation of the real copy number of transcripts by means of real-time PCR technique (24Prieto-Álamo M.J. Cabrera-Luque J.M. Pueyo C. Gene Expr. 2003; 11: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Absolute real-time PCR analysis of a large number of transcripts in a large number of samples is expensive and time consuming. To solve this problem, we first devised a novel experimental approach that combines the advantages of both multiplex and real-time PCR. For the mouse genes of the Trx and Grx pathways a set of 8 primer pairs were designed (Table I). Relative data were obtained for all transcripts in all samples by MPCR, and then absolute measurements were inferred by determining by real-time PCR the actual mRNA level of one gene in all samples and those of all genes in one reference sample (see “Materials and Methods”). Table II demonstrates that the number of mRNA molecules estimated from MPCR is equivalent to that calculated by real-time PCR.Table IIEstimation of mRNA copy number from MPCR relative data Transcripts were quantitated in commercial samples of total RNA from mouse brain and ovary by means of both multiplex and real-time PCRs. The numbers of mRNA molecules/pg of total RNA were calculated by real-time PCR and estimated from MPCR relative variations (see ‘Materials and Methods‘), using either brain or ovary as the reference sample and alternating the transcript used as reference. As an example, the mRNA molecules/pg calculated in ovary (mean ± S.E. of 4 real-time PCR repetitions) are compared with some of the estimations derived from MPCR relative data, i.e. those obtained when using Trx1, Grx1, TrxR2, or GR as reference.mRNA molecules/pg total RNATranscriptReal-timeMPCRTrx1Grx1TrxR2GRTrx1220 ± 2.6213207221Trx261 ± 1.664626165Grx147 ± 1.6484649Grx231 ± 1.737363537TrxR147 ± 0.847454447TrxR26.4 ± 0.46.86.66.9TGR6.8 ± 0.17.06.86.67.0GR47 ± 1.8484745 Open table in a new tab Organ Expression Profiles of Trx and Grx Transcripts—Our first goal was to quantitate the steady-state amounts of transcripts at the whole organ level (Fig. 1). Among the organs examined, the lowest Trx1 mRNA amounts were quantitated in brain, heart, and testis (average of 62 molecules/pg) and the highest in kidney (274 molecules/pg) followed by lung (159 molecules/pg). The Trx2 mRNA expression pattern did not correlate with that of Trx1. Therefore, though Trx2 mRNA appeared with maximal expression level in kidney (157 molecules/pg), high levels were quantitated also in heart and testis (average of 135 molecules/pg) and low in lung (36 molecules/pg). In the line of Trx transcripts, Grx1 and Grx2 mRNAs were ubiquitously synthesized and presented vast differences in abundance depending on the tissue type. Thus, Grx1 mRNA was largely overexpressed in kidney (121 molecules/pg) compared with the lowest level in testis (14 molecules/pg) and with the levels in other mouse organs (average of 29 molecules/pg). In contrast, Grx2 mRNA was highly represented in testis (148 molecules/pg), compared with kidney and brain (average of 22 molecules/pg), and the rest of organs (average of 9 molecules/pg). To our knowledge, this is the first time that the organ distribution of mouse Trx and Grx mRNAs has been investigated, though it was suggested a possible increased Grx2 mRNA level in mouse testis based on the relatively high frequency of expressed sequence tags (7/36) from this organ (12Gladyshev V.N. Liu A. Novoselov S.V. Krysan K. Sun Q.A. Kryukov V.M. Kryukov G.V. Lou M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30374-30380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Organ Expression Profiles of Reductase Transcripts—The expression patterns of TrxR1, TrxR2, TGR, and GR mRNAs are compared in Fig. 1B. TrxR1 transcript was more abundant in liver and kidney (around 31 molecules/pg) than in the rest of organs examined (average of 13 molecules/pg). On the contrary, the TrxR2 mRNA displayed highest levels in spleen (27 molecules/pg) followed by kidney (13 molecules/pg), intermediate levels in liver, heart, and testis (about 7.9 molecules/pg), and lowest levels in lung and brain (around 4.3 molecules/pg). Therefore, TrxR1 and TrxR2 exhibited different organ expression patterns that were distinct also from those displayed by both Trx genes. Overall, the quantitative data given here are not in good agreement with previous Northern analyses of mouse TrxR1 and TrxR2 genes (17Sun Q.A. Wu Y. Zappacosta F. Jeang K.T. Lee B.J. Hatfield D.L.

Gene. 2000; 242: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 21Miranda-Vizuete A. Damdimopoulos A.E. Spyrou G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1447: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For instance, Northern blots of mouse TrxR2 mRNA showed much higher expression levels in liver than in spleen (19Kawai H. Ota T. Suzuki F. Tatsuka M. Gene. 2000; 242: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). On the contrary, we clearly quantitated a higher amount (by a factor of 3.9) of TrxR2 mRNA in spleen than in liver. This and other discrepancies may be explained, at least in part, by the inaccuracy of the β-actin gene as quantitative reference in organ mRNA profiling (24Prieto-Álamo M.J. Cabrera-Luque J.M. Pueyo C. Gene Expr. 2003; 11: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). GR mRNA was generally more abundant than TrxR1 and TrxR2 mRNA species. The organ expression profile was also different: kidney showed the highest amount (198 molecules/pg), followed by lung, liver, testis, and brain (about 43 molecules/pg), and then by spleen and heart (around 21 molecules/pg). Previous studies have suggested that TGR might be testis-specific (17Sun Q.A. Wu Y. Zappacosta F. Jeang K.T. Lee B.J. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24522-24530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we quantitated much higher number of TGR transcripts (760 molecules/pg) in testis than in the rest of organs (≤11 molecules/pg) (Fig. 1B). Besides this outstanding testis specificity, the refined reverse transcription-PCR procedure used in this work revealed substantial differences among other organs. Thus, TGR mRNA was overexpressed an average of 6.1 in lung and kidney (around 11 molecules/pg) compared with the lowest level in spleen and liver (about 1.8 molecules/pg). Interestingly, TGR mRNA in testis was as abundant as β-actin mRNA (24Prieto-Álamo M.J. Cabrera-Luque J.M. Pueyo C. Gene Expr. 2003; 11: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), which is regarded as a rather abundant transcript. However, in the rest of the mouse tissues, though much less abundant, TGR mRNA cannot be considered a rare transcript because its amount was roughly in the range of mRNAs coding for other reductases (particularly TrxR2). Alternative Splicing Forms—Differential pre-mRNA splicing is an important mode of regulating the steady-state abundance of a specific mRNA (28Carey M. Smale S.T. Transcriptional Regulation in Eukaryotes: Concepts, Strategies, and Techniques. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 65-96Google Scholar). Examination of expressed sequence tags for mouse Grx2 has revealed alternative mRNAs that differ in sequences upstream of exon 2 (12Gladyshev V.N. Liu A. Novoselov S.V. Krysan K. Sun Q.A.

However, the activation mechanisms of ADAM12 are obscure. To determine how ADAM12 is activated, we screened proteins that bind to the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM12 using a yeast two-hybrid system and identified a protein called PACSIN3 that contains a Src homology 3 domain.

A novel mechanistic concept of the EGFR transactivation-signaling pathway involves the proteolytic release of heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) at the surface of cells stimulated with GPCR agonists (3Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). HB-EGF is a member of the EGF family that directly binds EGFR and thereby enhances its phosphorylation, resulting in cell growth and differentiation (4Higashiyama S. Lau K. Besner G.E. Abraham J.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6205-6212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like other members of the EGF family, HB-EGF is synthesized as a membrane-anchored form (proHB-EGF) and then proteolytically processed to become a bioactive soluble form, a process that is called ectodomain shedding. The ectodomain shedding of proHB-EGF is an important post-translational modification that converts a tethered insoluble juxtacrine growth factor into a soluble ligand leading to the autocrine or paracrine activation of EGFR. Studies of GPCR mitogenic signaling have proven that EGFR transactivation is dependent on HB-EGF in smooth muscle cells (2Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H.

Growing evidence points to a disintegrin and metalloproteases (ADAMs) as key enzymes of proHB-EGF shedding in EGFR transactivation signaling. All ADAMs have an extracellular portion with a metalloprotease domain, a transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic tail, and several ADAMs have metalloprotease activity. Lemjabbar and Basbaum (8Lemjabbar H. Basbaum C. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) described that stimulation of platelet-activating factor receptor transactivated EGFR through the shedding of proHB-EGF by ADAM10 in the human epithelial cell line HM3. Yan et al. (9Yan Y. Shirakabe K. Werb Z. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) demonstrated that stimulation with the bombesin receptor transactivated EGFRs via the ADAM10-dependent cleavage of proHB-EGF in COS-7 cells. We also identified ADAM12 as a specific enzyme that catalyzes proHB-EGF shedding in EGFR transactivation by GPCR agonists, such as phenylephrine, endothelin-1, and angiotensin II causing cardiac hypertrophy (6Asakura M. Kitakaze M. Takashima S. Liao Y. Ishikura F. Yoshinaka T. Ohmoto H. Node K. Yoshino K. Ishiguro H. Asanuma H. Sanada S. Matsumura Y. Takeda H. Beppu S. Tada M. Hori M. Higashiyama S. Nat.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7260-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) showed that ADAM9 is involved in TPA-induced shedding of HB-EGF in Vero-H cells when protein kinase Cδ is activated. However, Weskamp et al. (11Weskamp G. Cai H. Brodie T.A. Higashyama S. Manova K. Ludwig T. Blobel C.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 1537-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) found that TPA-stimulated shedding of HB-EGF is unaffected in embryonic fibroblasts derived from mice lacking ADAM9. Moreover, Kurisaki et al. (12Kurisaki T. Masuda A. Sudo K. Sakagami J. Higashiyama S. Matsuda Y. Nagabukuro A. Tsuji A. Nabeshima Y. Asano M. Iwakura Y. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) discovered that TPA-induced proHB-EGF shedding is completely abrogated in embryonic fibroblasts derived from mice lacking ADAM12, arguing against an essential role for ADAM9 in proHB-EGF shedding. These reports indicate that the ectodomain shedding of EGFR ligands, especially of proHB-EGF, is central to GPCR and EGFR communication. However, the underlying mechanisms of the ligand shedding-dependent EGFR transactivation pathway are largely unknown. Thus, elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms of ADAMs is essential to understand the ligand shedding-dependent EGFR transactivation pathway. The present study focuses on ADAM12, which is involved in TPA or angiotensin II induced HB-EGF shedding and EGFR transactivation. ADAM12 has several Src homology 3 (SH3) domain-binding motifs, (R/K)XXPXXP or PXXPX(R/K) (13Kay B.K. Williamson M.P. Sudol M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar) in its cytoplasmic tails, indicating that ADAM12 probably interacts with signaling molecules containing SH3 domains. Therefore, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening to identify proteins that bind ADAM12 cytoplasmic tails. We found that a protein containing an SH3 domain called PACSIN3 is required for the proHB-EGF shedding induced by TPA and angiotensin II. Expression Vectors and Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—The yeast expression plasmid encoding the GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to the human ADAM12 cytoplasmic domain was constructed by inserting ADAM12 cytoplasmic domain complementary DNA (cDNA) into EcoRI and SalI sites in the multiple cloning sites of the pBTM116 vector (Clontech). We similarly constructed yeast expression plasmids encoding GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to human ADAM9, ADAM10, ADAM15, ADAM17, and ADAM19 cytoplasmic domains. We prepared an adenovirus carrying a gene encoding FLAG epitope-tagged ADAM12 as described (6Asakura M. Kitakaze M. Takashima S. Liao Y. Ishikura F. Yoshinaka T. Ohmoto H. Node K. Yoshino K. Ishiguro H. Asanuma H. Sanada S. Matsumura Y. Takeda H. Beppu S. Tada M. Hori M. Higashiyama S. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). ADAM12 full-length was cloned into the pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech). The cytoplasmic domain of ADAM12 and its truncated regions were cloned into the pGEX4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). PACSIN3 full-length and truncated (ΔSH3, 1-362 amino acids) cDNAs isolated from a human heart cDNA library by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were introduced below the hemagglutinin (HA) sequence into BamHI and NotI sites among the multiple cloning sites of the pcDNA3.1 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). PACSIN3 full-length cDNA was also cloned into the pGEX4T-1 vector. The siRNA duplexes were chemically synthesized and purified by Dharmacon Research Inc. The PACSIN3 target sequence 5′-AAGAGGCTGAAGGAGGTTGAG-3′ was selected for PACSIN3 knockdown. This sequence was not substantially similar to any other sequence in the NCBI data base. Scramble siRNA directed against 5′-GCGCGCUUUGUAGGAUUCG-3′ was the negative control. No mammalian mRNAs contained this sequence in the NCBI data base. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Yeast strain L40 containing pBTM116-ADAM12-ΔCyto was selected on synthetic complete medium lacking tryptophan. A human heart cDNA library in pACT2 was introduced into the transformant, and then yeast cells were plated onto synthetic complete medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine in the presence of 3.5 mm 3-aminotriazole. We assayed the β-galactosidase activity of transformants grown on the dropout plates at 30 °C for 3-7 days. Library plasmid DNA was recovered by transformation into Escherichia coli HB101 cells and sequenced. Cell Culture and Transfection—HT1080 cells were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. HT1080 cells stably expressing one of HA-tagged PACSIN3 (HA-PACSIN3), HA-tagged PACSIN3-ΔSH3 (HA-PACSIN3-ΔSH3), alkaline phosphatase (AP)-tagged proHB-EGF (proHB-EGF-AP) (14Tokumaru S. Higashiyama S. Endo T. Nakagawa T. Miyagawa J.I. Yamamori K. Hanakawa Y. Ohmoto H. Yoshino K. Shirakata Y. Matsuzawa Y. Hashimoto K. Taniguchi N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), or both proHB-EGF-AP and angiotensin type I (AT1) receptor were also maintained under the same conditions except for the presence of 200 μg/ml hygromycin B. Cells at 80-90% confluence were transfected with mammalian expression vectors using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions or infected with adenovirus at 50 multiplicity of infection and then incubated for 40 h. Preparation of Cell Extracts—Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm leupeptin, 1.5 mm pepstatin, 1 mm aprotinin, and 50 mm sodium fluoride (lysis buffer). After centrifugation for 15 min at 12,000 rpm, the supernatant was collected as cell extract. Pull-down Assay with Immobilized Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Fusion Proteins—We separated GST and GST-fusion proteins using SDS-PAGE and stained them with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The proteins were immobilized onto glutathione-Sepharose and exposed to pull-down FLAG-tagged ADAM12 (FLAG-ADAM12) from cell lysates. Cell lysates were incubated with either GST or GST fusion proteins on the resin in 500 μl of the lysis buffer described above with gentle agitation at 4 °C for 4 h. After extensive washing with lysis buffer, bound proteins were released by boiling in SDS-sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and then immunoblotted. Immunoprecipitation—The HT1080/HA-PACSIN3 cell lysates were incubated for 2 h with an anti-HA polyclonal antibody (Y11) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 4 h. The immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation, washed five times with lysis buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted. Immunoblot Analysis—Resolved proteins were transferred onto an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) and immunoblotted against the following primary antibodies: anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5) (Roche Applied Science), anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2) (Sigma), or anti-PACSIN3 polyclonal antibody raised against GST fusion protein. The secondary antibody was either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody (Promega). The immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Confocal Microscopy—HT1080/HA-PACSIN3 and HT1080/HA-PACSIN3-ΔSH3 cells were transiently transfected with pEGFP-ADAM12. Thereafter, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized using 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and stained with anti-HA monoclonal antibody followed by goat Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). Fluorescent images were acquired at the resolution of 512 × 512 using a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 confocal device fitted on a Nikon Eclipse E-600 microscope with a 100 x/1.4 PlanAPO oil-immersion objective. Red and green signals were collected sequentially to avoid bleed through. Assay of ProHB-EGF-AP Shedding—Cells at 80-90% confluence were transfected with 0.8 μg of siRNA (per well of 24-well plates) and incubated for 40 h. The cells were then incubated for 60 min at 37 °C with 50 nm TPA or 100 nm angiotensin II. Aliquots (100 μl) of conditioned media were transferred to 96-well plates, and AP activity was measured as described previously (14Tokumaru S. Higashiyama S. Endo T. Nakagawa T. Miyagawa J.I. Yamamori K. Hanakawa Y. Ohmoto H. Yoshino K. Shirakata Y. Matsuzawa Y. Hashimoto K. Taniguchi N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Identification of Binding Proteins That Interact with ADAM12 by Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—To identify proteins that interact with the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM12, 3.0 × 106 clones of a human heart cDNA library were screened using the yeast two-hybrid system and the ADAM12 cytoplasmic domain as bait. Thirteen positive clones were obtained and sequenced. A homology search in GenBank™ cDNA data bases using the BLAST program revealed that two of the isolated clones overlap with the carboxyl-terminal region of PACSIN3 cDNA. PACSIN3 full-length cDNA was cloned by PCR from a human heart cDNA library, and interaction between PACSIN3 and the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM12 in yeast cells was confirmed by growth under nutritional selection and by β-galactosidase production (Fig. 1A). The domain structure of PACSIN3 has a Fes/CIP4 homology domain in the amino-terminal region, followed by a coiled coil domain and a SH3 domain at the carboxy-terminal region (Fig. 1B) (15Sumoy L. Pluvinet R. Andreu N. Estivill X. Escarceller M. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 262: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). PACSIN3 Associates with ADAM12 in Vitro and in Vivo—We performed in vitro binding assays to confirm that PACSIN3 and ADAM12 interact. FLAG-ADAM12 bound to GST-PACSIN3 fusion protein but not to GST alone in extracts from HT1080 cells expressing FLAG-ADAM12 (Fig. 2A). To further confirm that these two proteins can associate in mammalian cells, FLAG-ADAM12 was transiently expressed in HT1080/HA-PACSIN3 cells. Fig. 2B shows that anti-HA antibody immunoprecipitated HA-PACSIN3 from cell lysates of HT1080 cells transfected with HA-PACSIN3, but not from mock-transfected cell lysates (middle panel), and co-immunoprecipitated FLAG-ADAM12, which was detected by the anti-FLAG antibody (upper panel). FLAG-ADAM12 expression was detected by anti-FLAG antibody in the lysates of HT1080 cells transfected with FLAG-ADAM12 but not in lysates from mock-transfected HT1080 cells (lower panel). Determination of Cytoplasmic Domain of ADAM12 Required for PACSIN3 Binding—To define the binding site of ADAM12 for PACSIN3, we assayed binding in vitro using a series of truncated mutants of the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM12 (Fig. 3, A and C). HA-PACSIN bound to GST-ADAM12-Cyto-1, -2 and -3 equally and to GST-ADAM12-Cyto-4 and -5 to a lesser extent in extracts from HT1080 cells expressing HA-PACSIN3 (Fig. 3B). In contrast, HA-PACSIN3 did not bind to GST-ADAM12-Cyto-6 and -7 (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that P1 (amino acid residues 754-759) and P2 (amino acid residues 829-840) are required for binding to PACSIN3. Co-localization of ADAM12 and PACSIN3—To determine the intracellular localization of ADAM12 and PACSIN3, EGFP-fused ADAM12 (ADAM12-EGFP) was transiently expressed in HT1080/HA-PACSIN3 or HT1080/HA-PACSIN3-ΔSH3 cells. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that ADAM12-EGFP and HA-PACSIN3 co-localized at intracellular vesicles and at the leading edge of the cell (Fig. 4, A-C). On the other hand, the combination of ADAM12-EGFP and HA-PACSIN3-ΔSH3 (Fig. 4, D-F) did not co-localize. Effects of PACSIN3 on Ectodomain Shedding of ProHB-EGF Induced by TPA and Angiotensin II—To investigate the effect of PACSIN3 on the ectodomain shedding of proHB-EGF induced by TPA, PACSIN3 or PACSIN3-ΔSH3 was overexpressed in HT1080/HB-EGF-AP cells. The AP activity in the conditioned medium of each transfectant was then measured after a 60-min incubation with 50 nm TPA. The overexpression of PACSIN3 enhanced TPA-induced proHB-EGF-AP shedding ∼5-fold compared with the control, whereas the effect of PACSIN3-ΔSH3 overexpression was quite minimal (Fig. 5A). However, PACSIN3 overexpression did not enhance proHB-EGF-AP shedding induced by angiotensin II to a statistically significant extent (Fig. 5B). To confirm that PACSIN3 functions as an up-regulator of proHB-EGF ectodomain shedding, we destroyed the mRNA using siRNA mediation. To test the effect of PACSIN3-siRNA on knockdown, we estimated the level of endogenous PACSIN3 protein by immunoblotting. We detected less endogenous PACSIN3 protein in the lysate from HT1080 cells transfected with PACSIN3-siRNA than in those transfected with negative control scramble siRNA (Fig. 6A). This result confirmed that PACSIN3-siRNA reduced endogenous PACSIN3 protein levels. We then assessed the effect of PACSIN3-siRNA on the ectodomain shedding of proHB-EGF induced by TPA. HT1080/HB-EGF-AP cells were transfected with Scramble-siRNA or with PACSIN3-siRNA, and AP activity was measured in the same manner as described above.Fig. 6Knockdown of PACSIN3 by siRNA. A, immunoblot analysis. HT1080 cell lysates were immunoblotted using anti-PACSIN3 antibody. B and C, effect of PACSIN3 knockdown on shedding of proHB-EGF induced by 50 nm TPA (B) and 100 nm angiotensin II (C). AP activity in conditioned medium of HT1080/HB-AP or HT1080/HB-AP/AT1 cells transfected with siRNA was measured after incubation with 50 nm TPA or 100 nm angiotensin II for 60 min at 37 °C, respectively. Values represent means ± S.E. (n = 4). **, p < 0.01 for scramble versus siRNA with TPA or angiotensin II.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In addition, proHB-EGF-AP shedding induced by angiotensin II was assayed using HT1080/HB-EGF-AP/AT1 cells. PACSIN3 knockdown mediated by PACSIN3-siRNA attenuated 50 and 45% of the control levels of TPA- and angiotensin II-induced proHB-EGF-AP shedding, respectively (Fig. 6, B and C). Specificity of PACSIN3 Binding to ADAMs—We studied the specificity of ADAMs for PACSIN3 association. Fig. 7 shows the binding affinity of the cytoplasmic domains of various ADAM proteins for PACSIN3 determined by the yeast two-hybrid system. The cytoplasmic domains of ADAMs 9, 10, 12, 15, and 19 interacted with PACSIN3 but not those of ADAM17 both in yeast growth (Fig. 7A) and β-galactosidase assays (Fig. 7B). The current study investigated the regulatory mechanisms of ADAM-dependent proHB-EGF shedding induced by TPA or GPCR agonists. We then focused on ADAM12 that has recently been identified as a shedding enzyme involved in proHB-EGF. Since the cytoplasmic tail of human ADAM12 has four class I (R/K)XXPXXP and three class II PXXPX(R/K) SH3 domain-binding motifs grouped into four proline-rich regions (Fig. 3A), ADAM12 probably interacts with several signaling molecules containing SH3 domains. Yeast two-hybrid screening using the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM12 as bait resulted in the isolation of PACSIN3 characterized by Fes/CIP4 homology and SH3 domains in the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions, respectively. PACSIN3 is supposed to be a cytoplasmic molecule involved in endocytosis. For example, PACSIN3 binds endocytic proteins such as dynamin, synaptojanin 1, and N-WASP in vitro, and PACSIN3 overexpression blocks endocytosis (16Modregger J. Ritter B. Witter B. Paulsson M. Plomann M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4511-4521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ADAM12 interacts with signaling molecules containing an SH3 domain such as Src and the p85α regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and the binding sites for these proteins are located in P2, and in P2 or P4 of the ADAM12 cytoplasmic tail, respectively (17Suzuki A. Kadota N. Hara T. Nakagami Y. Izumi T. Takenawa T. Sabe H. Endo T. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5842-5850Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 18Kang Q. Cao Y. Zolkiewska A. Biochem.

Binding assays using a series of truncated mutants mapped the PACSIN3-binding sites to P1 and P2 in ADAM12 cytoplasmic tail. These findings suggest that the PACSIN3-binding sites are shared by several proteins containing SH3 domains, although whether the binding of these proteins to ADAM12 cytoplasmic tail is exclusive remains unknown. Microscopy revealed that HA-PACSIN3 was diffused throughout the cytoplasm and partially localized in the plasma membrane where some endogenous ADAM12 also resides. On the other hand, ADAM12-EGFP was intracellularly distributed in a vesicle-like manner, consistent with other reports indicating that exogenous ADAM12 is localized mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum, trans-Golgi networks, and partially in the plasma membrane (20Kadota N. Suzuki A. Nakagami Y. Izumi T. Endo T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 941-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 21Hougaard S. Loechel F. Xu X. Tajima R. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). HA-PACSIN3 co-localized with ADAM12-EGFP in the plasma membrane, suggesting that PACSIN3 associates with correctly transported ADAM12 in the plasma membrane. Our findings are also supported by the notion that mutant PACSIN3-ΔSH3 do not co-localize with wild type ADAM12, and previously reported ADAM13 binds to and co-localize with PACSIN2 (22Cousin H. Gaultier A. Bleux C. Darribère T. Alfandari D. Dev. Biol. 2000; 227: 197-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that PACSIN3 knockdown by siRNA in HT1080 cells partially attenuated the shedding of proHB-EGF induced by TPA and angiotensin II. Thus, PACSIN3 seems necessary, but alone is insufficient, to regulate the signaling pathway of the ectodomain shedding of HB-EGF induced by both TPA and by angiotensin II. In addition, PACSIN-like molecules might be involved in regulating the ectodomain shedding of proHB-EGF induced by TPA and angiotensin II. We also question whether PACSIN3 regulates the ectodomain shedding of proHB-EGF induced by other GPCR. PACSIN3 can interact with the cytoplasmic tails of ADAM9, ADAM10, ADAM15, and ADAM19 as well as with those of ADAM12 (Fig. 7), suggesting that PACSIN3 widely regulates ADAM-dependent post-translational modification. The physiological significance of interactions between PACSIN3 and these ADAMs, however, remains obscure. We postulated that PACSIN3 plays a physiological role as a binding partner of ADAM12 in the signaling pathway of proHB-EGF shedding induced by GPCR agonists. Further analyses will clarify the signaling pathway from GPCRs to the processing of proHB-EGF leading to EGFR transactivation. We acknowledge R. Ikeda and M. Uragami for technical assistance."

YBR161w, termed CSH1 here, encodes a protein that exhibits a strong similarity to Csg1p. To examine whether Csh1p also functions in MIPC synthesis, we performed a [3H]dihydrosphingosine labeling experiment. Δcsg1 cells exhibited only a reduction in the synthesis of mannosylated sphingolipids compared with wild-type cells, whereas the Δcsg1 Δcsh1 double deletion mutant exhibited a total loss. These results indicated that Csg1p and Csh1p have redundant functions in MIPC synthesis. Analyses using Δcsg1 and Δcsh1 cells in the Δipt1, Δsur2, or Δscs7 genetic background demonstrated that Csh1p has a different substrate specificity from Csg1p. We also revealed that Csg2p interacts with both Csg1p and Csh1p. Deletion of the CSG2 gene reduced the Csg1p activity and abolished the Csh1p activity. These results suggested that two distinct inositol phosphorylceramide mannosyltransferase complexes, Csg1p-Csg2p and Csh1p-Csg2p, exist.

Sphingolipids are ubiquitous and abundant components of eukaryotic plasma membranes. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, there are three classes of sphingolipids that contain myo-inositol, namely inositol phosphorylceramide (IPC), 1The abbreviations used are: IPC, inositol phosphorylceramide; MIPC, mannosylinositol phosphorylceramide; M(IP)2C, mannosyldiinositol phosphorylceramide; DHS, dihydrosphingosine; HA, hemagglutinin; 3×HA, triple HA; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. mannosylinositol phosphorylceramide (MIPC), and mannosyldiinositol phosphorylceramide (M(IP)2C). These sphingolipids contain one of five ceramide backbones that differ in hydroxylation state (Fig. 1). Dihydroceramide (ceramide A in Fig. 1) contains a dihydrosphingosine (DHS)-type long chain base and a C26 fatty acid. Sur2p can convert DHS to phytosphingosine or dihydroceramide to phytoceramide (ceramide B in Fig. 1) (1Haak D. Gable K. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29704-29710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Hydroxylation of the C26 fatty acid of ceramide A and ceramide B at the C-2 position by Scs7p yields ceramide B′ and ceramide C, respectively (Fig. 1) (1Haak D. Gable K. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol.

Yeast. 1998; 14: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Ceramide D is generated by further hydroxylation, at an unknown position, of the fatty acid moiety of ceramide C, a reaction requiring Ccc2p, a possible Cu2+ transporter (3Beeler T.J. Fu D. Rivera J. Monaghan E. Gable K. Dunn T.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). IPCs are synthesized from ceramides by Aur1p in the lumen of the Golgi apparatus (4Nagiec M.M. Nagiec E.E. Baltisberger J.A. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol.

Although neither Csg1p nor Csg2p is required for vegetative growth, both seem to be important for Ca2+ signaling, because csg1 and csg2 mutants were originally isolated as Ca2+-sensitive mutants (8Beeler T. Gable K. Zhao C. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7279-7284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Certain suppressor genes for a Ca2+-sensitive csg2 mutant were found to be genes involved in sphingolipid synthesis (1Haak D. Gable K. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol.

This finding led to a later study that revealed the involvement of Csg1p and Csg2p in MIPC synthesis (3Beeler T.J. Fu D. Rivera J. Monaghan E. Gable K. Dunn T.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 6Zhao C. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21480-21488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Their precise functions and their relationship in MIPC synthesis remains unclear, although Csg1p is predicted to have a catalytic function based on the presence of a stretch of 93 amino acids with homology to those found in two yeast α-1,6-mannosyltranferases, Och1p and Hoc1p (3Beeler T.J. Fu D. Rivera J. Monaghan E. Gable K. Dunn T.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Structurally, Csg2p is an integral membrane protein with up to 10 transmembrane segments that, when overexpressed, localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (8Beeler T. Gable K. Zhao C. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7279-7284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Takita Y. Ohya Y. Anraku Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 269-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Csg2p is also known to have an EF-Ca2+-binding domain and has been implicated in the regulation of a nonexchangeable, intracellular Ca2+ pool (11Tanida I. Takita Y. Hasegawa A. Ohya Y. Anraku Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 38-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The predicted product of the open reading frame YBR161w (termed here CSH1 for CSG1/SUR1 homolog) is highly homologous to Csg1p. In this study we examined the possibility that this open reading frame is actually involved in the MIPC synthesis. The MIPC synthesis activity exhibited by a Δcsg1 mutant was found to be completely lacking in a Δcsg1 Δcsh1 double mutant, indicating that both Csg1p and Csh1p are involved in the MIPC synthesis, redundantly. Moreover, we found that Csg2p associates with both Csg1p and Csh1p. Thus, Csg1p-Csg2p and Csh1p-Csg2p complexes may function as two distinct IPC mannosyltransferases. Yeast Strains and Media—S. cerevisiae strains used are listed in Table I. The Δcsg1::HIS3 and Δcsg2::URA3 cells were constructed by replacing the 0.44-kb ClaI-EcoRI region in the CSG1 gene and the 0.41-kb EcoRI-HincII region in the CSG2 gene with HIS3 and URA3 markers, respectively. The Δcsh1::LEU2 and Δcsh1::KanMX4 cells were constructed by replacing the 0.59-kb EcoRV-XbaI region in the CSH1 gene and the entire open reading frame of the CSH1 gene with the LEU2 marker and the KanMX4 marker, respectively. The Δipt1::KanMX4, Δsur2::KanMX4, Δscs7::KanMX4, and Δpep4::KanMX4 cells were constructed by replacing their entire open reading frames with the KanMX4 marker. The cells were grown either in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose) or in synthetic complete medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base and 2% glucose) containing nutritional supplements.Table IStrains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceSEY6210Matα leu2-3, 112 ura3-52 his3 -Δ200 trp1 -Δ901 lys2-801 suc2 -Δ9Ref. 37Robinson J.S.

The vector plasmid pKHR45 (HIS3 marker, CEN) was designed to express a C-terminally, triple hemagglutinin (HA) (3×HA)-tagged protein as described previously (12Kihara A. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30048-30054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For construction of pSU30 (CSG1-HIS6-MYC, HIS3 marker, 2 μ), the CSG1 region was amplified using genomic DNA prepared from SEY6210 and the primers 5′-GCTGCGTCTCTTCTCTTGCTCC-3′ and 5′-CTCACTGGGAAATAACAGCTCGGACC-3′. The resulting fragments were cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega) to generate the pSU17 plasmid. The 1.6-kb SmaI-BamHI fragment of pSU17 was then cloned into the EcoRV-BamHI site of pSU29 to generate pSU30. To construct the CSG2–3×HA fusion gene, the CSG2 region was first amplified from genomic DNA prepared from SEY6210 using the primers 5′-AACTCGAGTATACTTTTCTACGCCTCC-3′ and 5′-CGGGGAAGGTAAATACCACCATACTAGT-3′. The resulting fragments were cloned into pGEM-T Easy to generate the pSU2, and the 1.7-kb XhoI-SpeI fragment of pSU2 was then cloned into the XhoI-SpeI site of pKHR45, generating pSU6 (CSG2–3×HA, HIS3 marker, CEN). The pSU8 (CSG2–3×HA, LEU2 marker, 2 μ) was constructed by cloning the 1.8-kb XhoI-SacI fragment of pSU6 into the XhoI-SacI site of pRS425 (13Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). The pSU41 (CSH1-HIS6-MYC, HIS3, 2 μ) was constructed using the CSH1 region amplified from genomic DNA prepared from SEY6210 and the primers 5′-CATTATGATGGTAACTCCATCAG-3′ and 5′-CGCAAAATTTACCGACTTAACGGATCCA-3′. The resulting fragments were cloned into pGEM-T Easy to generate the pSU34, and the 1.7-kb NotI-BamHI fragment of pSU34 was then cloned into the EcoRV-BamHI site of pSU29, producing pSU41(CSH1-HIS6-MYC, HIS3, 2 μ). [3H]DHS Labeling Assay—Yeast strains were grown in YPD medium at 30 °C to 1.0 A 600 unit. The cells were treated with [4,5-3H]DHS (50 Ci/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemical, Inc.), which had been complexed with 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma; A-6003) and incubated for 1 h or 3 h at 30 °C. 1 μCi of [3H]DHS was used for labeling 1.0 A 600 cells. The cells were then washed with cold YPD medium containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and lipids were extracted as described previously (14Hanson B.A. Lester R.L. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 309-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were suspended in 100 μl of ethanol, water, diethylether, pyridine, 15 n ammonia (15/15/5/1/0.018, v/v/v/v/v) and incubated at 60 °C for 15 min. After centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the resulting supernatant was transferred to fresh tubes, dried, and suspended in 20 μl of chloroform, methanol, water (5/4/1, v/v/v). Lipids of equal radioactivity were resolved by TLC on Silica Gel 60 high performance TLC plates (Merck) with chloroform, methanol, 4.2 n ammonia (9/7/2, v/v/v) or chloroform, methanol, acetic acid, water (16/6/4/1.6, v/v/v/v) (1Haak D. Gable K. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29704-29710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) as the solvent system. Immunoblotting—Cell lysates for immunoblotting were prepared as described previously (13Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). Lysates equivalent to 0.2 A 600 cells were subject to SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon™ polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The resulting membrane was incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of the anti-HA antibody HA7 (Sigma) or the anti-Myc antibody PL14 (Medical & Biological Laboratories) for 1 h and then with a 1:5000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 fragment (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h. Labeling was detected by the ECL detection method (Amersham Biosciences). Pull-down Assay Using a Ni-NTA Column—Yeast spheroplasts were lysed by sonication in buffer A (50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete™, EDTA-free; Roche Applied Science)). After removal of cell debris by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 3 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was treated with four volumes of buffer B (50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) for 1 h at 4 °C to solubilize membranes. The samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was applied to a Ni-NTA-agarose column (1 ml) equilibrated with buffer B. The column was washed with 10 ml of buffer B, and bound proteins were eluted with 2 ml of buffer C (50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). Csh1p Is Involved in the Synthesis of MIPC—Csg1p and Csg2p are known to be involved in MIPC synthesis (3Beeler T.J. Fu D. Rivera J. Monaghan E. Gable K. Dunn T.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 6Zhao C. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21480-21488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), yet several issues remain unresolved. For instance, it is unclear whether one of them, or both, is a mannosyltransferase, or if any other factors are involved in this reaction. To gain insight into these problems, we investigated the involvement of Csh1p, which is highly homologous to Csg1p (71% similarity and 65% identity; Fig. 2) (3Beeler T.J. Fu D. Rivera J. Monaghan E. Gable K. Dunn T.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Sequences in both Csg1p and Csh1p display similarity to sequences in the mannosyltransferases for N-linked glycans, Och1p and Hoc1p (Fig. 2, dashed line) (3Beeler T.J. Fu D. Rivera J. Monaghan E. Gable K. Dunn T.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Csg1p and Csh1p share especially high similarity at the conserved regions spanning amino acid residues 54–148 and 63–155, respectively. On the other hand, there is little homology between their C termini. Csh1p, as well as Csg1p, is predicted to have three transmembrane segments (Fig. 2, underlining). Both contain potential N-glycosylation sites, five in Csg1p and three in Csh1p (Fig. 2, dots). To examine whether Csh1p also functions in MIPC synthesis, we constructed Δcsg1 and Δcsh1 mutants, as well as a Δcsg1 Δcsh1 double mutant, and compared these with wild-type cells for their ability to synthesize sphingolipids. The cells were cultured in YPD medium containing [3H]DHS for 1 h (Fig. 3, top panel) or 3 h (Fig. 3, bottom panel), and then lipids were extracted and separated by TLC. In wild-type cells labeled for 1 h, IPC, MIPC, and M(IP)2C, each with several hydroxylation states, were detected. Among these IPC-C was the most prominent, followed by IPC-A, M(IP)2C-A, M(IP)2C-B/B′, and M(IP)2C-C. In the 3-h labeling experiment, the amounts of M(IP)2C-C and MIPC-C had increased, whereas the amounts of IPC-A and MIPC-B/B′ had decreased. In both labeling experiments, MIPC was found in much lower quantities than IPC or M(IP)2C. Thus, the MIPC-to-M(IP)2C conversion appears to be rapid. In the Δcsg1 mutant, MIPC-C was not detected at either time period. Moreover, the amount of M(IP)2C-C was greatly reduced compared with that in wild-type cells (10 and 30% for 1- and 3-h labeling, respectively). Concomitantly, however, slightly higher amounts of the IPC species were observed, especially in the 3-h labeling. On the other hand, the lipid composition of the Δcsh1 mutant was quite similar to that of the wild-type cells (Fig. 3, lane 3). In the Δcsg1 Δcsh1 double mutant, however, both MIPC and M(IP)2C were completely absent, and the levels of all IPC species were increased compared with those in the wild-type cells (Fig. 3, lane 4). MIPC and M(IP)2C were not detected in the Δcsg1Δcsh1 double mutant, even after labeling for 24 h (data not shown). The effects of deleting the CSG1 and CSH1 genes on the sphingolipid synthesis pattern were not restricted to the yeast background used (KA31-1A). Similar data were obtained using another yeast background (BY4741) (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that both Csg1p and Csh1p have functions, albeit redundant, in MIPC synthesis. Csg1p and Csh1p Exhibit Different Substrate Specificities—As shown in Fig. 3, the [3H]DHS-labeled pattern of Δcsg1 cells differed from that of Δcsh1 cells. The most prominent differences were a reduction in M(IP)2C-C and a loss of MIPC-C in the Δcsg1 cells. These results implied that Csg1p and Csh1p might exhibit different substrate specificities. To examine this possibility, we constructed Δcsg1 and Δcsh1 mutants in a Δipt1, Δsur2, or Δscs7 background and then performed the [3H]DHS labeling experiments. We first investigated sphingolipid synthesis in the mutant of IPT1. Because Ipt1p is involved in converting MIPC to M(IP)2C, M(IP)2C is not synthesized in the Δipt1 cells. Sphingolipid synthesis in the Δcsh1 cells in the Δipt1 background was quite similar to that in the control CSH1 + cells (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 3). On the other hand, the Δcsg1 mutation caused a reduction in MIPC-C to 20% of that in the CSG1 + cells, with a concomitant increase in IPC-C (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 2). MIPC-A and MIPC-B/B′ levels observed in the Δcsg1 mutant resembled those of the wild-type cells. The amounts IPC-D and MIPC-A also did not differ, although they were not separated by the original solvent system used (Fig. 4A, lanes 1–3). Another solvent system, in which the two separate, confirmed that the amounts of both lipids were unchanged by the Δcsg1 mutation (Fig. 4A, lanes 4 and 5). Because B and B′ species exhibit very similar mobilities, we discriminated between these two using Δsur2 and Δscs7 mutations. We first investigated sphingolipid synthesis in the Δsur2 background, in which only the A and B′ species are synthesized. The amounts of IPC, MIPC, and M(IP)2C in the Δcsg1 Δsur2 double mutant were quite similar to those in the control Δsur2 mutant (Fig. 4B, lanes 1 and 2). The labeling pattern in the Δcsh1Δsur2 cells was nearly the same as that in the control CSH1 + cells, although a slight decrease in the amount of MIPC-B′ was observed in the Δcsh1Δsur2 cells. We next investigated the substrate preferences of Csg1p and Csh1p using the Δscs7 background, in which only the A and B species are synthesized. Sphingolipid synthesis in the Δcsh1 Δscs7 double mutant was quite similar to that in the CSH1 + Δscs7 mutant (Fig. 4C, lanes 1 and 3). On the other hand, the Δcsg1 mutation caused a reduction in M(IP)2C-B to 10% of that in the CSG1 + cells (Fig. 4C, lanes 1 and 2). Taken together, these results lead to the conclusion that Csh1p exhibits a similar activity to Csg1p against IPC-A and IPC-B′ but a weaker activity against IPC-B and IPC-C than Csg1p. Csg2p Interacts with Both Csg1p and Csh1p—It has been reported that Csg2p is involved in MIPC synthesis (3Beeler T.J. Fu D. Rivera J. Monaghan E. Gable K. Dunn T.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 6Zhao C. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21480-21488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that Csg2p may function together with Csg1p and Csh1p by forming complexes with them. To examine this hypothesis, we performed a pull-down assay using a Ni-NTA column. We constructed a pSU30 plasmid encoding Csg1p-His6-Myc, a pSU41 plasmid encoding Csh1p-His6-Myc, and a pSU8 plasmid encoding Csg2p-3×HA. Expression of these tagged proteins in transfected KHY195 cells was confirmed by immunoblotting using anti-Myc or anti-HA antibodies. Csg1p-His6-Myc was detected as a band of 46 kDa (the predicted molecular mass is 48 kDa) (Fig. 5A, lane 2). Csh1p-His6-Myc was detected as several bands of 75, 60, and 47 kDa, and bands with lower molecular masses (Fig. 5A, lane 4). Of these bands, the 47-kDa band was most likely to be the intact Csh1p-His6-Myc (predicted molecular mass is 48 kDa). It is possible that the 75- and 60-kDa forms are modified by glycosylation because Csh1p contains potential N-glycosylation sites (Fig. 2, dots). The bands with lower molecular masses may be degradation products. Csg2p-3×HA was detected as a weak band of 47 kDa (the predicted molecular mass is 49 kDa) (Fig. 5A, lane 6); several bands with faster gel mobilities, including a prominent band of 24 kDa, were also detected. These bands may be generated by degradation caused by nonphysiological overproduction. Using these constructs, we next examined the possibility that Csg2p interacts with Csg1p and/or with Csh1p. Cell lysates prepared from KHY195 cells bearing pSU8 (CSG2–3×HA) together with either pRS423 (vector) or pSU30 (CSG1-HIS6-MYC) were solubilized with Triton X-100 and applied to a Ni-NTA column, which binds His6-tagged proteins. The bound proteins were then eluted with 250 mm imidazole. As expected, Csg1p-His6-Myc was collected in the eluted fraction (Fig. 5B, lane 2). Although Csg2p-3×HA itself had no affinity to the Ni-NTA column, it was recovered in the eluted fraction when co-expressed with Csg1p-His6-Myc (Fig. 5B). These results indicate an association between Csg2p-3×HA and Csg1p-His6-Myc. Moreover, the putative degradated Csg2p-3×HA was also co-eluted with Csg1p-His6-Myc (Fig. 5B, asterisk), suggesting that the N-terminally truncated Csg2p retains the Csg1p-interacting site. Next, to determine the interaction between Csh1p and Csg2p, cell lysates prepared from KHY195 cells bearing pSU8 (CSG2–3×HA) and either pRS423 (vector) or pSU41(CSH1-HIS6-MYC) were subjected to the pull-down assay using the Ni-NTA column. Similar to the results obtained with Csg1p-His6-Myc, Csg2p-3×HA was also co-eluted with Csh1p-His6-Myc (Fig. 5C). Once again, the putative degraded Csg2p-3×HA was also co-eluted with Csh1p-His6-Myc (Fig. 5C, asterisk). These results indicate that two complexes, Csg1p-Csg2p and Csh1p-Csg2p, exist. Determination of the Role of Csg2p in MIPC Synthesis— Next, we examined the effect of the Δcsg2 mutation on the synthesis of MIPC. We constructed Δcsg2, Δcsg1 Δcsg2, Δcsh1 Δcsg2, and Δcsg1 Δcsg2 Δcsh1 cells. A [3H]DHS labeling experiment using the Δcsg2 cells demonstrated that deletion of the CSG2 gene results in a drastic decrease in the amounts of MIPC and M(IP)2C and an increase in the amount of IPC (Fig. 6A, lane 2). Only M(IP)2C-B′/B, and M(IP)2C-C were detected, barely (Fig. 6A, lane 2). This effect of the Δcsg2 mutation was much greater than that observed in the Δcsg1 or the Δcsh1 cells (Fig. 3). Thus, Csg2p has important functions for both complexes (Csg1p-Csg2p and Csh1p-Csg2p) in eliciting their enzyme activities. Next, to examine whether Csg1p or Csh1p is responsible for the residual activity observed in the Δcsg2 cells, we examined the labeling patterns of the Δcsh1Δcsg2 and Δcsg1Δcsg2 cells. The labeling pattern of the Δcsh1 Δcsg2 double mutant was identical to that of the Δcsg2 mutant (Fig. 6A, lane 3). In contrast, the small amounts of M(IP)2C-B′/B and MIPC-C observed in the Δcsg2 cells were completely lacking after the introduction of the Δcsg1 mutation (Fig. 6A, lane 4). These results indicate that, compared with Csg2p-associated Csg1p, the MIPC synthesis activity of free Csg1p is significantly lower, but free Csg1p does retain detectable MIPC-B′/B and MIPC-C synthesis activity. On the other hand, free Csh1p could not produce MIPC at all. Thus, Csg2p is essential for the MIPC synthesis activity of the Csh1p-Csg2p complex and is also quite important for that of the Csg1p-Csg2p complex. Ca2 + Sensitivity Correlates with MIPC Synthesis Activity—We next examined the effect of the Δcsh1 mutation on Ca2+ sensitivity. The cells were grown on a YPD plate containing 100 mm Ca2+ at 30 °C. As shown in Fig. 6B, the Δcsg1 and Δcsh1 mutants were resistant to exogenous Ca2+ and exhibited normal growth. On the other hand, the Δcsg2 mutant, as well as the Δcsg1 Δcsh1 double mutant, was highly sensitive to Ca2+ and would not grow on the medium. Identical results were obtained when the cells were grown at 37 °C (data not shown). Thus, the Ca2+ sensitivities of these mutants correlate well with their MIPC synthesis activities. Although previous studies have suggested the involvement of Csg1p and Csg2p in MIPC synthesis (3Beeler T.J. Fu D. Rivera J. Monaghan E. Gable K. Dunn T.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 6Zhao C. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21480-21488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), their precise roles in that reaction have not been defined. We reveal here that Csg1p and Csg2p form a heterodimer that functions as a MIPC synthase. Additionally, we identify that Csh1p is also involved in the MIPC synthesis and can also function in a complex with Csg2p. Using yeast mutants carrying deletions for the CSG1 or CSH1 gene, in various gene-ablated backgrounds, we examined their substrate specificities. Csh1p exhibited similar activity against IPC-A and IPC-B′ but lower activity against IPC-B and, especially, IPC-C as compared with Csg1p (Fig. 4). These results indicate that Csg1p and Csh1p are involved in the MIPC synthesis redundantly with different substrate specificities. The exact catalytic subunit of MIPC synthesis (Csg1p and Csh1p, Csg2p, or other) has not been verified. Nevertheless, we propose a model that Csg1p and Csh1p are catalytic subunits with Csg2p as a regulatory subunit, based on several supportive results. First, Csg1p and Csh1p contain stretches of 93 amino acids with homology to those found in two yeast α-1,6-mannosyltranferases, Och1p and Hoc1p (3Beeler T.J. Fu D. Rivera J. Monaghan E. Gable K. Dunn T.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), but Csg2p does not share this sequence. Second, previous studies have shown that although overexpression of Csg1p suppresses the Ca2+-sensitive phenotype of a csg2 mutant, in the inverse experiment, overexpression of Csg2p did not suppress the Ca2+ sensitivity of a csg1 mutant (3Beeler T.J. Fu D. Rivera J. Monaghan E. Gable K. Dunn T.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus, the role of Csg2p appears more regulatory rather than directly enzymatic. Finally, M(IP)2C was detected, albeit weakly, in the Δcsh1Δcsg2 cells, suggesting that, in the absence of Csg2p, Csg1p could produce MIPC. The growth of the Δcsg1 mutant on a YPD plate containing Ca2+ was as normal as that of the wild-type cells at both 30 and 37 °C (Fig. 6B and data not shown). In contrast, the Δcsg2 cells and the Δcsg1 Δcsh1 double mutant cells, both of which exhibited more severe defects in MIPC synthesis, were highly sensitive to exogenous Ca2+. The Ca2+ resistance of the Δcsg1 cells in this study is not consistent with a previous report (3Beeler T.J. Fu D. Rivera J. Monaghan E. Gable K. Dunn T.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) that the Δcsg1 mutant exhibits a Ca2+-sensitive phenotype at 37 °C but not at 26 °C (3Beeler T.J. Fu D. Rivera J. Monaghan E. Gable K. Dunn T.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). It is possible that the contribution of Csg1p to the total MIPC synthesis activity differs among different yeast backgrounds. Indeed, the Δcsg1 cells used in the previous report, on a DBY685 background, exhibited a severe defect in MIPC synthesis (3Beeler T.J. Fu D. Rivera J. Monaghan E. Gable K. Dunn T.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that the Ca2+ sensitivity is caused by an accumulation of IPC-C, which contains a phytosphingosine-type long chain base and a hydroxylated very long chain fatty acid at the C2 position. The Ca2+-sensitive phenotype of the csg2 mutant was suppressed by several mutations that caused a reduction in the IPC-C concentrations (6Zhao C. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21480-21488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These mutations included genes involved in long chain base synthesis (lcb1, lcb2, tsc3, and tsc10) (6Zhao C. Beeler T.

Chem. 1997; 272: 29704-29710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Moreover, overproduction of Ccc2p, which may stimulate the conversion of IPC-C to IPC-D, also rescued the Ca2+-sensitive phenotype of the csg2 mutant (3Beeler T.J. Fu D. Rivera J. Monaghan E. Gable K. Dunn T.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, the reason the accumulation of IPC-C causes Ca2+ sensitivity remains unclear. One possibility is that IPC-C itself acts as a signaling molecule. Recent studies have indicated that several sphingolipid metabolites and intermediates function as signaling molecules. In yeast, sphingoid long chain base is involved in endocytosis (17Zanolari B. Friant S. Funato K. Sutterlin C. Stevenson B.J. Riezman H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2824-2833Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and in cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 (18Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 382-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that IPC-C is another potent signaling molecule involved in the Ca2+ signaling pathway. Other suppressors of Ca2+ sensitivity in the csg2 mutant were found to be genes involved in signal transduction. These included genes encoding the protein kinase TOR2 and the phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase MSS4 (9Beeler T. Bacikova D. Gable K. Hopkins L. Johnson C. Slife H. Dunn T. J. Biol.

Thus, IPC-C might connect the increase of Ca2+ in the cells and the signaling pathways of Tor2p and Mss4p. Another possibility is that IPC-C regulates Ca2+ signaling by modulating the formation of microdomains. Recent theory suggests the existence of microscopic regions called microdomains (or lipid rafts) in the plasma membrane, which function as platforms for effective signal transduction (33Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5187) Google Scholar). In yeast, the microdomain is composed of ergosterol and sphingolipids (34Bagnat M. Keranen S. Shevchenko A. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3254-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). It has been reported that several proteins such as Pma1p, Gas1p, and Nce2p associate with the microdomain (34Bagnat M. Keranen S. Shevchenko A. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W2095677518,"Haloalkane dehalogenases are bacterial enzymes capable of carbon-halogen bond cleavage in halogenated compounds. To obtain insights into the mechanism of the haloalkane dehalogenase from Sphingomonas paucimobilis UT26 (LinB), we studied the steady-state and presteady-state kinetics of the conversion of the substrates 1-chlorohexane, chlorocyclohexane, and bromocyclohexane. The results lead to a proposal of a minimal kinetic mechanism consisting of three main steps: (i) substrate binding, (ii) cleavage of the carbon-halogen bond with simultaneous formation of an alkyl-enzyme intermediate, and (iii) hydrolysis of the alkyl-enzyme intermediate. Release of both products, halide and alcohol, is a fast process that was not included in the reaction mechanism as a distinct step. Comparison of the kinetic mechanism of LinB with that of haloalkane dehalogenase DhlA from Xantobacter autotrophicus GJ10 and the haloalkane dehalogenase DhaA from Rhodococcus rhodochrous NCIMB 13064 shows that the overall mechanisms are similar. The main difference is in the rate-limiting step, which is hydrolysis of the alkylenzyme intermediate in LinB, halide release in DhlA, and liberation of an alcohol in DhaA. The occurrence of different rate-limiting steps for three enzymes that belong to the same protein family indicates that extrapolation of this important catalytic property from one enzyme to another can be misleading even for evolutionary closely related proteins. The differences in the rate-limiting step were related to: (i) number and size of the entrance tunnels, (ii) protein flexibility, and (iii) composition of the halide-stabilizing active site residues based on comparison of protein structures.

Haloalkane dehalogenases (EC 3.8.1.5) make up an important class of enzymes that are able to cleave carbon-halogen bonds in halogenated aliphatic compounds. There is a growing interest in these enzymes because of their potential use in bioremediation, as industrial biocatalysts, or as biosensors. Structurally, haloalkane dehalogenases belong to the α/β-hydrolase fold superfamily (1Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Remington S.J. Silman I. Schrag J. Sussman J.L. Verschueren K.H.G. Goldman A. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1843) Google Scholar). Without exception, haloalkane dehalogenases contain a nucleophile elbow (2Damborsky J. Pure Appl. Chem. 1998; 70: 1375-1383Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar), which is the most conserved structural feature within the α/β-hydrolase fold. The other highly conserved region in haloalkane dehalogenases is the central β-sheet. Its strands, flanked on both sides by α-helices, form the hydrophobic core of the main domain that carries the catalytic triad Asp-His-(Asp/Glu). The second domain, consisting solely of α-helices, lies like a cap on top of the main domain. Residues at the interface of the two domains form the active site. Whereas there is significant similarity in the catalytic core, the sequence and structure of the cap domain diverge considerably among different dehalogenase. The cap domain is proposed to play a prominent role in determining substrate specificity (3Pries F. Van den Wijngaard A.J. Bos R. Pentenga M. Janssen D.B. J. Biol.

A reaction mechanism for haloalkane dehalogenase has been proposed on the basis of x-ray crystallographic (5Verschueren K.H.G. Seljee F. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Dijkstra B.W.

Catalysis proceeds by the nucleophilic attack of the carboxylate oxygen of an aspartate group on the carbon atom of the substrate, yielding displacement of the halogen as halide and formation of a covalent alkyl-enzyme intermediate. The alkyl-enzyme intermediate is subsequently hydrolyzed by a water molecule that is activated by a histidine. A catalytic acid (Asp or Glu) stabilizes the charge developed on the imidazole ring of the histidine during the hydrolytic half-reaction. A number of haloalkane dehalogenases from different bacteria have been purified and biochemically characterized. A principal component analysis of activity data indicated the presence of three specificity classes within this family of enzymes (10Damborsky J. Koca J. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 11Nagata Y. Miyauchi K. Damborsky J. Manova K. Ansorgova A. Takagi M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 3707-3710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three haloalkane dehalogenases representing these different classes have been isolated and characterized in detail so far: the haloalkane dehalogenase DhlA (12Janssen D.B. Gerritse J. Brackman J. Kalk C. Jager D. Witholt B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 67-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the haloalkane dehalogenase LinB from Sphingomonas paucimobilis UT26 (11Nagata Y. Miyauchi K. Damborsky J. Manova K. Ansorgova A. Takagi M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 3707-3710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the haloalkane dehalogenase DhaA from Rhodococcus rhodochrous NCIMB 13064 (13Kulakova A.N. Larkin M.J. Kulakov L.A. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The kinetic mechanism has been solved for DhlA (9Schanstra J.P. Kingma J. Janssen D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14747-14753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and DhaA (14Bosma T. Pikkemaat M.G. Kingma J. Dijk J. Janssen D.B. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8047-8053Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Comparison of the kinetic mechanism of DhlA and DhaA shows that the overall scheme is similar. The main difference was found at rate-limiting steps. For their best substrates, it was found that the rate of halide release represents the slowest step in the catalytic cycle of DhlA, whereas liberation of the alcohol is rate-limiting in the catalytic action of DhaA. This study presents detailed insight into the kinetic mechanism of the haloalkane-dehalogenase LinB that is obtained using steady-state as well as presteady-state kinetic techniques. The similarities and differences between the kinetics of the three well studied haloalkane dehalogenases are also discussed in this report. Protein Expression and Purification—To overproduce His-tagged LinB enzyme, the plasmid pMLBH6 (15Terada I. Kwon S.-T. Miyata Y. Matsuzawa H. Ohta T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6576-6581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used. Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) harboring pMLBH6 was cultured in 0.25 liters of Luria broth at 37 °C. Induction of dehalogenase synthesis was initiated by addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm when the culture reached an optical density of 0.6 at 600 nm. After induction, the culture was incubated at 30 °C for 4 h and then harvested. The cells were disrupted by sonication using a Soniprep 150 (Sanyo). A cell-free extract was obtained by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The dehalogenase was purified on a Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid Sepharose column HR 16/10 (Qiagen). The His-tagged LinB (16Nagata Y. Hynkova K. Damborsky J. Takagi M. Protein Exp. Purif. 1999; 17: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) was bound to the resin in the equilibrating buffer, which contained 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.5, 0.5 m sodium chloride and 10 mm imidazole. Unbound and weakly bound proteins were washed with buffer containing 60 mm imidazole. The His-tagged enzyme was then eluted with buffer with 160 mm imidazole. The active fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight against 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. The enzyme was stored at 4 °C in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 10% glycerol and 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The enzyme was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 0.13 mm glycine buffer, pH 8.6, for stopped flow and rapid quench flow experiments. Steady-State Kinetics—Dehalogenation reactions were performed at 37 °C in 25-ml Reacti-Flasks closed by Mininert Valves. Nine different concentrations of substrate in glycine buffer, pH 8.6, were used. Reactions were initiated by addition of 200 μl of the enzyme preparation. The reaction progress was monitored by withdrawing 0.5-ml samples at 0, 5, and 10 min, using a syringe needle to reduce evaporation of the substrate from the reaction mixture. The samples were mixed with 0.5 ml of methanol to terminate the reaction. The substrate and product concentrations were analyzed on a gas chromatograph equipped with a capillary column (DB-FFAP 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm, J&W Scientific) using a flame ionization detector (GC Trace 2000, Finnigan). The temperature program was isothermal at 40 °C for 1 min followed by increase to 250 °C at 20 °C/min. The programmed flow of carrier gas (He) started at 0.6 ml/min for 1 min and then increased to 2.0 ml/min at 0.2 ml/min/min. Michaelis-Menten kinetic constants were calculated from the initial steady-state rates of product formation by nonlinear regression analysis using ORIGIN 6.1 (OriginLab Corporation). Inhibition Kinetics—Substrate to product conversion by the action of LinB was monitored using an isothermal titration calorimeter type CSC 4200 (Calorimetry Sciences Corporation). Product inhibition was tested by monitoring of the enzymatic reaction in the presence and absence of a fixed amount of corresponding products. For this, substrate was dissolved in glycine buffer and allowed to achieve thermal equilibrium in the reaction cell (1.3 ml). The reaction was initiated by injecting 20 μl of 30 μm LinB solution. The measured rate of heat change is directly proportional to the velocity of enzymatic reaction according to the equation δQ/δt = –ΔHVδ[S]/δt, where ΔH is the enthalpy of the reaction, [S] is substrate concentration, and V is the volume of the cell. ΔH was determined by titrating the substrate into the reaction cell containing the enzyme. Each reaction was allowed to proceed to completion. The integrated total heat of reactions was divided by the amount of injected substrate. The evaluated rate of substrate depletion (–δ[S]/δt), and corresponding substrate concentrations were then fitted by nonlinear regression to kinetic models using the ORIGIN 6.1 (OriginLab Corporation). PreSteady-State Kinetics—Stopped flow fluorescence measurements of intrinsic protein fluorescence was used to study the kinetics of substrate conversion. The experiments were performed both on stopped flow instrument model SX17MV (Applied Photophysics) and on SFM-20 stopped flow spectrofluorometer (BioLogic) equipped with a Xe arc lamp with excitation at 295 nm. Fluorescence emission from Trp residues was observed through a 320-nm cutoff filter supplied with the instrument. All reactions were performed at 37 °C in a glycine buffer, pH 8.6. The concentrations reported below are those present in the reaction chamber. Rapid quench flow experiments were performed at 37 °C in a glycine buffer, pH 8.6, using both a rapid quench flow instrument model RQF-63 (KinTek Instruments) and model QFM 400 (BioLogic). Reactions were started by rapid mixing of 50 μl of enzyme with 50 μl of substrate solution. Quenching was done with 120 μl of 0.4 m H2SO4 (final concentration) after time intervals ranging from 2 ms to 2 s. The quenched mixture was directly injected into 0.5 ml of ice-cold diethyl ether containing 0.05 mm 1,2-dichloropropane as the internal standard. After extraction, the diethyl ether layer containing non-covalently bound substrate and product was separated from the water phase and neutralized by addition of NaHCO3. The water was eliminated by addition of Na2SO4, and the diethylether extract was transferred to an autosampler vial for automated analysis. The samples were analyzed on a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (Hewlett Packard 6890) and a capillary column (HP-5 25 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm, Chrompack). The temperature program was 1 min isothermal at 45 °C followed by an increase to 250 °C at 20 °C/min. The flow of carrier gas (N2) was constant at 1.3 ml/min. All reported concentrations are in the reaction loop of rapid quench flow instrument. Derivation of Rates—The fluorescence traces (F) of multiple turnover experiments were fitted to a single exponential of the form F = A × exp(–k obs t) + E using the program MICROMATH SCIENTIST 2.0 (ChemSW). The parameter A is the amplitude, k obs is the observed rate constant, and E is the floating end point. Equation 1 or 2 was fitted to the k obs data to obtain the respective kinetic constants. Single turnover stopped flow fluorescence and rapid quench flow data were fit to an appropriate kinetic scheme using GEPASI 3.2 (17Mendes P. Computer Appl. Biosci. 1993; 9: 563-571PubMed Google Scholar). The single turnover data were fitted by numerical simulation using the kinetic constants from multiple turnover and steady-state experiments as starting values. The kinetic constants were refined by comparing fits of the single turnover data and the k obs data. To simulate the experimental fluorescence traces with the obtained kinetic constants and reaction schemes, the traces were described as a sum of the contributions of each enzyme species to the total fluorescence. Modeling of Protein-Ligand Complexes—Crystal structure coordinates of the LinB enzyme were obtained from Protein Data Bank (PDB ID 1CV2). The polar hydrogens were added to the structure by WHATIF 5.0 (18Vriend G. J. Mol. Graphics. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3363) Google Scholar). The catalytic His-272 was singly protonated in the Nδ on accordance with its catalytic function. The script q.kollua was used for addition of charges on all enzyme atoms and script addsol for addition of solvation parameters to the carbon atoms in the protein structure (19Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comp. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (9157) Google Scholar). The complex of LinB with halide bound in the active site cavity was obtained using the superimpose function of the visualizing program INSIGHTII 95 (Accelrys). All rotatable bonds were specified in each of the substrates using the program AUTOTORS of AUTODOCK 3.0 (19Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comp. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (9157) Google Scholar). Enzyme(-halide)-substrate complexes were modeled by AUTODOCK 3.0 using the Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm (19Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comp. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (9157) Google Scholar). Fifty docking runs were performed for each enzyme(-halide)-substrate complex. Calculated substrate orientations were clustered with a clustering tolerance for the root mean square positional deviation of 0.5 Å, but orientations of 1-chlorohexane and 1-bromohexane in LinB-halide complexes were clustered with a clustering tolerance of 1 Å in order to reduce number of obtained orientations. Site-directed mutagenesis and structural analysis of LinB suggest that Asp-108, His-272, and Glu-132 comprise the catalytic triad in this enzyme (20Hynkova K. Nagata Y. Takagi M. Damborsky J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 21Marek J. Vevodova J. Kuta-Smatanova I. Nagata Y. Svensson L.A. Newman J. Takagi M. Damborsky J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14082-14086Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The proposed reaction cycle (see Reaction Scheme I) is initiated by binding of the substrate in the Michaelis complex (E·RX). The binding site for the halogen that is cleaved off is formed by Asn-38, Trp-109, and Pro-208. The binding step is followed by a nucleophilic attack of Asp-108 on the carbon atom to which the halogen is bound, leading to cleavage of the carbon-halogen bond and formation of alkyl-enzyme intermediate (E-R·X–). The intermediate is subsequently hydrolyzed by activated water, with His-272 acting as a base catalyst, which gives formation of the enzyme-product complex (E·ROH·X–). The function of Glu-132 is to keep His-272 in the proper orientation and to stabilize the positive charge that develops on histidine imidazole ring during the reaction. The final step is release of the products as shown in Reaction Scheme I. E+RX⇌k-1k1E·RX⇌k-2k2E-R·X-⇌k-3k3E·ROH·X-⇌k-4k4E+X-+ROHReactionSchemeIReaction Scheme I Four substrates were selected as model compounds for a detailed kinetic study of LinB reaction. Chlorocyclohexane is structurally similar to the natural substrate for LinB 1,3,4,6-tetrachloro-1,4-cyclohexadiene. Bromocyclohexane was selected as a brominated analogue of chlorocyclohexane. Furthermore, 1-chlorohexane was selected as one of the best known substrates for LinB with a k cat/Km = 1.6 × 105m–1·s–1, and 1-bromohexane as its brominated analogue. However, 1-bromohexane was later excluded from the set of substrates because its high volatility and low water solubility, which prevented usage of the rapid-mixing instruments for transient kinetic measurement. Burst of the Reaction—Upon rapid mixing of LinB with excess of substrate, a clear presteady-state burst of substrate depletion was observed while alcohol formation showed no sign of burst for all selected substrates (Fig. 1). The occurrence of the burst of substrate depletion indicates that all the steps before and including cleavage of the carbon-halogen bond (formation of alkyl-enzyme intermediate) are not rate-limiting. The absence of a burst of alcohol formation (hydrolysis of alkylenzyme intermediate) suggests that this particular step is the slowest in the catalytic cycle and that all following steps are faster. Single Turnover Reaction—Single turnover reactions of LinB with bromocyclohexane and 1-chlorohexane were examined to obtain more information about the rates of the separate steps hidden within the observed presteady-state burst of substrate consumption. The single turnover fluorescence traces showed two phases (Fig. 2, A and B); i.e. a fast quenching phase and a subsequent slower recovery of the enzyme fluorescence. A single turnover rapid quench flow experiment was performed to find out which enzyme form caused the fluorescence quenching (Fig. 2, C and D). The rapid quench flow experiments showed fast disappearance of a substrate and relatively slow formation of a product. Within 200 ms after mixing, almost no substrate was left and less than half of the alcohol was formed, meaning that a covalent intermediate had accumulated. This accumulation of intermediate coincided with the quenching of the fluorescence signal. Thus, the two steps observed in the single turnover experiments represent formation of the alkyl-enzyme intermediate and recovery of free enzyme by hydrolysis of the intermediate. Both for bromocyclohexane and for 1-chlorohexane, the formation of the Michaelis complex appears to be a very fast process, which is not observed as a kinetically distinct phase preceding the formation of alkyl-enzyme intermediate. Single turnover experiments with chlorocyclohexane could not be conducted because of the high Km of this substrate. Product Binding and Release—The product inhibition patterns were examined to obtain information about the mechanism of product release. The LinB reaction was assayed in the presence and absence of a fixed amount of the corresponding products using isothermal titration calorimetry. Inhibition of LinB bromocyclohexane hydrolysis by bromide and cyclohexanol (Fig. 3, A and B) and inhibition of LinB 1-chlorohexane hydrolysis by chloride and 1-hexanol (Fig. 3, C and D) was examined using Lineweaver-Burk plots. For all products the same intercept was observed, whereas the slopes differed suggesting that the inhibitors had no effect on the initial velocity but only increased the apparent Km. From these results, the competitive inhibition pattern was deduced for both halide and alcohol inhibition. The kinetics of 1-chlorohexane conversion in the presence of chloride also showed substrate inhibition. The data were further analyzed by fitting the equations for competitive, noncompetitive, and mixed inhibition models. The best fit was evaluated by comparison of S.E. and variance. The halide inhibition data were fitted best with the competitive model, which yielded inhibition constants for chloride (Ki = 888 ± 45 mm) and for bromide (Ki = 282 ± 21 mm.) Also 1-hexanol (Ki = 3.3 ± 0.1 mm) and cyclohexanol (Ki = 43 ± 1.3 mm) were competitive inhibitors of LinB reaction. Stopped flow fluorescence experiments were used to study kinetics of product binding to LinB. Halide binding showed rapid equilibrium behavior, since the quenching of fluorescence occurred in the dead time of the instrument (1.5 ms). Only steady-state fluorescence levels were observed, suggesting that halide binds to the enzyme active site very quickly (Fig. 4A). The dissociation constants calculated from the steady-state fluorescence experiments were Kd = 806 ± 88 mm for chloride and Kd = 471 ± 31 mm for bromide. These values are close to those calculated from halide inhibition data. The rate of halide release was evaluated in the absence and in the presence of alcohol. For this, LinB was premixed with 600 mm bromide and diluted 1:1 with glycine buffer. An increase of steady-state fluorescence was observed after dilution (Fig. 4B). The amplitude of bromide release was not significantly influenced by the presence of the alcohol. This indicates that alcohol and halide do not compete for the same binding site and the release of one product is not dependent on the presence of the other. Together with the finding that both alcohol and halide are competitive inhibitors, this implies a random sequential mechanism for product release. The amplitude of the fluorescence change that is observed upon mixing of LinB with cyclohexanol and 1-hexanol was not sufficient for a detailed fluorescence evaluation of alcohol binding. Similar to what was found with halide, only steady-state changes of fluorescence could be observed, suggesting that also alcohol binding reaches rapid equilibrium in the dead time of the stopped flow instrument. Considering that the release of both alcohol and halide reach rapid equilibrium and that the enzyme-bound complexes of both products have high dissociation constants, the reaction mechanism from Reaction Scheme I can be simplified to Reaction Scheme II. Since no products of the reverse reaction have been detected with DhlA (9Schanstra J.P. Kingma J. Janssen D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14747-14753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) or DhaA (14Bosma T. Pikkemaat M.G. Kingma J. Dijk J. Janssen D.B. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8047-8053Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) the dehalogenation reaction can be regarded as irreversible. In incubations of LinB (1 μm) with: (i) 65 mm cyclohexanol and 300 mm bromide, (ii) 65 mm cyclohexanol and 800 mm chloride, (iii) 1 m 1-butanol and 1 m chloride, and (iv) 5 mm 3-bromopropan-1-ol and 1 m chloride, respectively, no enzymatic reaction was observed using isothermal titration calorimetry and gas chromatography. These results confirmed that dehalogenation reaction of LinB is also irreversible. Lewandowicz and co-workers (35Lewandowicz A. Rudzinsky J. Tronstad L. Widersten M. Ryberg P. Matsson O. Paneth P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 4550-4555Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and Paneth (36Paneth P. Acc. Chem.

Therefore the cleavage of the carbon-halogen bond was included as a reversible step in Reaction Scheme II. E+RX⇌KsE·RX⇌k-2k2E-R·X→k3E+ROH+X-ReactionSchemeIIReaction Scheme 2 Multiple Turnover Reaction—Since formation of the Michaelis complex appears to be a very fast process, it is best described as a rapid equilibrium with dissociation constant K s. The analysis of single turnover reactions, using stopped flow and rapid quench flow techniques, did not provide sufficient information to yield a unique solution for the equilibrium constant, and therefore multiple turnover experiments were performed. Multiple turnover reactions with chlorocyclohexane, bromocyclohexane, and 1-chlorohexane were examined using the stopped flow fluorescence technique. The obtained traces were fitted with single exponentials (Fig. 5A), yielding an observed rate constant for each substrate concentration (k obs). A relationship between k obs and the microscopic rate constants (Equation 1) was derived using Reaction Scheme II. The dependence of k obs on the 1-chlorohexane concentration showed saturation (Fig. 5B). Thus, k 2 and K s could be determined separately. The dependence of k obs on the bromocyclohexane and chlorocyclohexane concentrations (Fig. 5, C and D) showed no saturation behavior even after reaching the limit of substrate solubility. This indicates that the K s is high, leading to a simplification of the function for k obs (Equation 2). In this case, only the ratio k 2/K s could be determined and only the lower limits of k 2 and K s could be obtained for these substrates. kobs=k2·[S][S]+Ks+k-2+k3(Eq. 1) kobs=k2·[S]Ks+k-2+k3(Eq. 1) Substrate Inhibition—The kinetics of 1-chlorohexane conversion showed a decrease in velocity at high substrate concentration after the maximum velocity was reached. This is manifested by the upward curvature of the Lineweaver-Burk plot at low values of 1/[S] (Fig. 3C) and indicate substrate inhibition. Most often, substrate inhibition is caused by binding of more than one substrate molecule to the active site of an enzyme, resulting in an inactive complex. Substrate inhibition was observed for 1-bromohexane (K si = 0.19 ± 0.09 mm) and 1-chlorohexane (K si = 6450 ± 360 mm). The substrate inhibition constant (K si) for 1-chlorohexane is not significant at standard conditions but becomes relevant in the presence of a high concentration of chloride. This suggests that the E·(RX)2 complex of LinB with 1-chlorohexane has a significant affinity for chloride (Kd = 41 ± 6mm). The chloride is probably bound in its energetically favorable region in between halide-stabilizing residues, which cannot be reached by any of the competing substrate molecules. Thus the formation of ES·(RX)2·X– complex shifts the equilibrium toward inactive enzyme forms and results in enhancement of substrate inhibition effect in the presence of high concentration of halide product. The docking analyses indicated energetically favorable formation of ES2-halide complex for 1-chlorohexane and 1-bromohexane, while an analogous complex was not observed for chlorocyclohexane and bromocyclohexane. The structures of LinB complexed with 1-chlorohexane, 1-bromohexane, chlorocyclohexane, and bromocyclohexane were modeled using molecular docking methods. The automated docking procedure provided a suitable orientation of enzyme-substrate complexes (E·RX) for all four selected substrates. The docking of a second substrate molecule into E·R"

In bone metastasis, there is a vicious circle wherein bone-residing metastatic cells stimulate osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, and bone-derived growth factors released from resorbed bone promote tumor growth. The contribution of tumor angiogenesis in the growth of bone metastases is, however, unknown. By using an experimental model of bone metastasis caused by MDA-MB-231/B02 breast cancer cells that quite closely mimics the conditions likely to occur in naturally arising metastatic human breast cancers, we demonstrate here that when MDA-MB-231/B02 cells were engineered to produce at the bone metastatic site an angiogenesis inhibitor, angiostatin, there was a marked inhibition in the extent of skeletal lesions. Inhibition of skeletal lesions came with a pronounced reduction in tumor burden in bone. However, although angiostatin produced by MDA-MB-231/B02 cells was effective at inhibiting in vitro endothelial cell proliferation and in vivo angiogenesis in a Matrigel implant model, we have shown that it inhibited cancer-induced bone destruction through a direct inhibition of osteoclast activity and generation. Overall, these results indicate that, besides its well known anti-angiogenic activity, angiostatin must also be considered as a very effective inhibitor of bone resorption, broadening its potential clinical use in cancer therapy.

Bone is a very common metastatic site for human breast, prostate, lung, kidney, and thyroid cancer (1Body J.J. Bone. 1992; 13: S57-S62Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 2Guise T.A. Mundy G.R. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 18-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Bone metastasis is associated with a high morbidity rate because of intrac-table bone pain, pathological fractures, hypercalcemia, and nerve compression (1Body J.J. Bone. 1992; 13: S57-S62Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 2Guise T.A. Mundy G.R. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 18-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Current experimental studies support the notion that there is a vicious circle at the bone metastatic site at which bone-residing metastatic cells stimulate osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and bone-derived growth factors released from resorbed bone promote tumor growth (2Guise T.A. Mundy G.R. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 18-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). These findings (2Guise T.A. Mundy G.R. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 18-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) have provided the rationale for using bone resorption inhibitors (e.g. bisphosphonates) in the treatment of patients with bone metastases (1Body J.J. Bone. 1992; 13: S57-S62Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 3Hillner B.E. Ingle J.N. Berenson J.R. Janjan N.A. Albain K.S. Lipton A. Yee G. Biermann J.S. Chlebowski R.T. Pfister D.G. J. Clin. Oncol. 2000; 18: 1378-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). However, these treatments are only palliative and do not provide a life-prolonging benefit to metastatic patients (3Hillner B.E. Ingle J.N. Berenson J.R. Janjan N.A. Albain K.S. Lipton A. Yee G. Biermann J.S. Chlebowski R.T. Pfister D.G. J. Clin. Oncol. 2000; 18: 1378-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). There is, therefore, a need to define new therapeutic targets that could become useful adjunct therapies for the treatment of cancers that metastasize to bone. Tumor-associated neovascularization is necessary for the growth and metastatic spread of solid tumors (4Woodhouse E.C. Chuaqui R.F. Liotta L.A. Cancer. 1997; 80: 1529-1537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Hanahan D. Folkman J. Cell. 1996; 86: 353-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6091) Google Scholar). Angiogenesis inhibitors have been shown to be very effective in the treatment of a wide variety of solid tumors in animals (6Kerbel R. Folkman J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 727-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar). Based on these successful preclinical studies, over 20 anti-angiogenic drugs are currently undergoing evaluation in phase I, II, or III clinical trials (6Kerbel R. Folkman J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 727-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar). The contribution of angiogenesis inhibitors in inhibiting the formation of bone metastases caused by solid tumors is, however, unknown. There is some experimental evidence to indicate that human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells cause the development of highly vascularized skeletal lesions in animals (7Pluijm G. Lowik C. Papapoulos S. Cancer Treat. Rev. 2000; 26: 11-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and, interestingly, the systemic treatment of animals with the anticancer drug TNP-470 (a synthetic analogue of fumagillin with antiangiogenic properties) reduces the formation of bone metastases caused by MDA-MB-231 cells (8Sasaki A. Alcalde R.E. Nishiyama A. Lim D.D. Mese H. Akedo H. Matsumura T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 462-467PubMed Google Scholar). However, the antiangiogenic activity of TNP-470 was not clearly addressed in this study, and the doses used to inhibit bone metastasis formation exhibit some toxicity (8Sasaki A. Alcalde R.E. Nishiyama A. Lim D.D. Mese H. Akedo H. Matsumura T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 462-467PubMed Google Scholar), thereby limiting its clinical utility in the treatment of patients with bone metastases. However, these results (8Sasaki A. Alcalde R.E. Nishiyama A. Lim D.D. Mese H. Akedo H. Matsumura T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 462-467PubMed Google Scholar) do not preclude the use of more specific angiogenesis inhibitors in treating bone metastases. By using an experimental model of bone metastasis caused by MDA-MB-231/B02 breast cancer cells that quite closely mimics the conditions likely to occur in naturally arising metastatic human breast cancers (9Peyruchaud O. Winding B. Pecheur I. Serre C.M. Delmas P. Clezardin P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 2027-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), we demonstrate here that when MDA-MB-231/B02 cells were engineered to produce at the bone metastatic site a specific angiogenesis inhibitor, angiostatin, there was a marked inhibition in the extent of skeletal lesions and a concomitant reduction in the tumor burden in bone. Unexpectedly, beside its ability to inhibit angiogenesis in in vitro and in vivo models, we have shown for the first time that angiostatin inhibits cancer-induced bone destruction through a direct inhibition of the osteoclast activity. Construction of Mock- and Angiostatin-inducible Cell Lines Using the Tet-Off-Regulated Expression System—Characteristics of MDA-MB-231/B02 and MDA-MB-231/B02-GFP breast cancer cell lines have been described elsewhere (9Peyruchaud O. Winding B. Pecheur I. Serre C.M. Delmas P. Clezardin P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 2027-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 10Pecheur I. Peyruchaud O. Serre C.M. Guglielmi J.

The bi-directional vector pBI-L/mAST was constructed by inserting into the pBI-L plasmid (Clontech, Hampshire, United Kingdom) the HindIII/EcoRV fragment encoding for the entire mouse angiostatin sequence (kringles 1–4) and an antigenic epitope tag (hemagglutinin, HA) 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; tTA, tetR-VP16 protein chimera; TRAP, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor. fused to the COOH terminus of kringle 4 (11Cao Y. O'Reilly M.S. Marshall B. Flynn E. Ji R.W. Folkman J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1055-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The pTet-Off vector (Clontech) encoding for the tetR-VP16 protein chimera (tTA) was co-transfected in the MDA-MB-231/B02-GFP cell line together with a plasmid conferring hygromycin resistance (B02-GFP/tTA cells). Stable B02-GFP/tTA cells were then co-transfected with the pBiL/mAST construct and a vector conferring puromycin resistance. A negative control cell line was obtained by introducing into B02-GFP/tTA cells a pBI-L bidirectional Tet-inducible vector encoding for luciferase and β-galactosidase (Clontech). Luciferase induction upon doxycycline withdrawal was used to select inducible clones among stable transfectants. During clonal selection, angiostatin expression was suppressed by the constant addition of doxycycline (100 ng/ml), and the selection of the clones was obtained after growing the cells for 2 weeks in the presence of puromycin (2 μg/ml). Two angiostatin-inducible transfectants (B02-GFP/mAST#1 and B02-GFP/mAST#2) and one negative control-inducible transfectant (B02-GFP/βGal) were used in the present study. Inducible transfectants were routinely cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Bio-Media, Boussens, France) and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. When required, serum-free conditioned media were prepared from transfectants treated or not treated with doxycycline, in the absence of any other antibiotics. Luciferase Activity Measurement, Western Blotting, and Angiostatin Purification—Luciferase activity was measured on cell lysates following manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Charbonnière, France) using a luminometer (Berthold, La Garenne Colombes, France). Western blot analysis for the immunodetection of angiostatin in conditioned media was performed as previously described (11Cao Y. O'Reilly M.S. Marshall B. Flynn E. Ji R.W. Folkman J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1055-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, conditioned media (2 ml) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 100 μl of 50% lysine-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Saclay, France). After incubation, Sepharose beads were washed to remove unbound proteins and Sepharose-bound proteins were released by the addition of 30 μl of SDS sample buffer followed by heating at 95 °C for 3 min. Proteins were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Angiostatin was detected by incubating the membranes with mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody 12CA5 (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France). After washing, membranes were incubated with a biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) and with the streptavidin-peroxidase complex (Amersham Biosciences). Detection of immunoreactive bands was carried out using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). For angiostatin purification, conditioned media from B02-GFP/mAST#2 or B02-GFP/βGal cells grown in the absence of doxycycline were pre-cleared with Sepharose-4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) and applied onto a lysine-Sepharose column equilibrated in 30 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). After washing the columns with phosphate buffer, bound proteins were eluted in 30 mm phosphate buffer containing 200 mm ϵ-amino-caproic acid, as described previously (12Yokoyama Y. Dhanabal M. Griffioen A.W. Sukhatme V.P. Ramakrishnan S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2190-2196PubMed Google Scholar). Eluted proteins were dialyzed against 2.5 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), lyophilized, and resuspended in water. The purity of angiostatin was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Bone Metastasis and Subcutaneous Tumor Xenograft Animal Models—All procedures were performed on 4-week-old female Balb/c nu/nu mice (Charles River Laboratories, St. Germain sur l'Arbresle, France). Studies involving animals, including housing and care, method of euthanasia, and experimental protocols were conducted in accordance with a code of practice established by the Experimentation Review Board from the Laennec School of Medicine. These studies were routinely inspected by the Attending Veterinarian to ensure continued compliance with the proposed protocols. For bone metastasis and tumorigenesis experiments, animals received 5% (w/v) sucrose with or without doxycycline (1 mg/ml) in the water supply 2 days before tumor cell inoculation. Untreated animals received only sucrose in the water supply. Bone metastasis experiments were carried out essentially as described previously (9Peyruchaud O. Winding B. Pecheur I. Serre C.M. Delmas P. Clezardin P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 2027-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Doxycycline-treated or untreated tumor cells (105 cells in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline) were inoculated into the tail vein of anesthetized nude mice. Animals then received or did not receive doxycycline in the water supply for the duration of the experiments. Radiographs (MIN-R2000 film, Kodak, Rochester, NY) were taken at scheduled intervals with a cabinet x-ray system (MX-20, Faxitron X-Ray Corporation, Wheeling, IL), and bone metastases were enumerated on each radiograph. The area of osteolytic lesions was measured by using a computerized image analysis system (Visiolab 2000, Biocom, Paris, France), and the results were expressed in square millimeters. Animals analyzed by radiography were also examined by noninvasive, whole-body fluorescence imaging using a fluorescence scanning system (FluorImager, Amersham Biosciences). Scanned images were then analyzed using the computerized image analysis system ImageQuant (Amersham Biosciences). At sacrifice, bones were collected for further histological analysis. For subcutaneous tumor xenograft experiments, tumor cells were first cultured in the presence of doxycycline to block the expression of angiostatin. Tumor cells (106) in 50% Matrigel (v/v) (BD Biosciences, Le Pont de Claix, France) were then inoculated subcutaneously (100 μl) into the right flank of nude mice that have been treated previously for 2 days with doxycycline. Seven days after tumor cell inoculation, mice were randomized into two groups: one group received doxycycline for the duration of the experiment, whereas the other group had no doxycycline. Tumor size was assessed by external measurement of the length (L) and width (W) of the tumors using a Vernier caliper. Tumor volume (TV, expressed in mm3) was calculated by using the following equation: TV = (L × W2)/2. Bone Histology—Hind limbs from animals were fixed and embedded in methylmethacrylate, as described previously (10Pecheur I. Peyruchaud O. Serre C.M. Guglielmi J. Voland C. Bourre F. Margue C. Cohen-Solal M. Buffet A. Kieffer N. Clezardin P. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1266-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). 7-μm sections of undecalcified long bones were then cut with a microtome (Polycut E, Reichert-Jung) and stained with May-Grünwald-Giemsa or Goldner's trichrome. Histological analyses were performed on longitudinal medial sections of tibial metaphysis by using a computerized image analysis system (Visiolab 2000, Biocom). Immunohistochemistry and Assessment of the Microvessel Density—Subcutaneous tumor xenografts were zinc-fixed and paraffin-embedded according to the manufacturer's instructions (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Orsay, France). 5-μm tumor sections were then subjected to immunohistochemistry using a rat anti-mouse CD31 (PECAM-1) monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes murine endothelial cells (BD Biosciences). The immunostained blood vessel area/tumor area ratio (expressed as a percentage) was quantified by using a computerized image analysis system (Visiolab 2000, Biocom) and used to assess the microvessel density. Blood vessels at the bone metastatic sites were quantified by using a method described by Barou et al. (13Barou O. Mekraldi S. Vico L. Boivin G. Alexandre C. Lafage-Proust M.H. Bone. 2002; 30: 604-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were anesthetized and the left ventricle was catheterized, whereas the right auricle was sectioned to allow infusion products out of the circulation. The vascular network was first rinsed with a 2% saline-heparinized solution, fixed with a 4% paraformaldehyde solution, and finally stained with an India ink solution. Metastatic long bones were then prepared for histological examination, and the area of tumor blood vessels stained with India ink was quantified as described above. Angiogenesis Assays—In vitro endothelial cell proliferation and capillary-like tube formation assays were performed as described previously (14Fournier P. Boissier S. Filleur S. Guglielmi J. Cabon F. Colombel M. Clezardin P. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6538-6544PubMed Google Scholar). For the in vivo Matrigel plug assay, experiments were carried out essentially as described by Maeshima et al. (15Maeshima Y. Yerramalla U.L. Dhanabal M. Holthaus K.A. Barbashov S. Kharbanda S. Reimer C. Manfredi M. Dickerson W.M. Kalluri R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31959-31968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Growth factor-depleted Matrigel (BD Biosciences) was mixed with 20 units/ml heparin (Dakota Pharm, Créteil, France), 50 ng/ml vascular endothelial growth factor (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) or an equivalent volume of PBS, and 20 μg/ml of purified angiostatin. The Matrigel mixture was injected subcutaneously into 8-week-old female BALB/C nude mice (Charles River Laboratories). After 6 days, mice were killed and the Matrigel plugs were removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. The plugs were paraffin-embedded, cut, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Sections were examined by light microscopy, and microvessel density of 6–15 high power fields (×400) was counted and averaged using true-color imaging-processing work station Visiolab 2000 (Biocom). All sections were coded and examined in a blind fashion. Each experimental group consisted of 5–6 Matrigel plugs. The microvessel density, i.e. the microvessel area/Matrigel section area ratio, was expressed as a percentage. VEGF Immunoassay and Mouse Angiostatin Quantification—The VEGF content in tumor-conditioned media was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit for the human protein (Cytimmune, College Park, MD), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Angiostatin content in tumor-conditioned media was quantified by immuno-blotting as described above; increased concentrations of purified mouse angiostatin were used as a standard. The intensity of each immunoreactive band was then quantified by using the computerized image analysis system ImageQuant (Amersham Biosciences), and data were expressed in ng/ml of cell culture-conditioned medium. In Vitro Osteoclastogenesis Assay and in Situ Localization of Osteoclasts in Metastatic Bones—For in vitro studies, experiments were carried out using 8-week-old female OF1 mice (Charles River Laboratories). Spleens were collected and homogenized through a 70-μm mesh (BD Biosciences). The mononuclear cells were isolated using lymphocyte separation media (ICN Pharmaceuticals) and seeded in cell culture plates at a density of 1.5 × 105 cell/cm2 in α-MEM medium (Invitrogen) containing 30 ng/ml M-CSF (PreproTech, TEBU, Le Perray-En-Yve-lines, France), RANK-L (2%, a generous gift of Dr. P. Jurdic, Lyon, France), with or without purified mouse angiostatin (10 μg/ml). After 6 days in culture, differentiated osteoclasts were enumerated under a light microscope as a function of multinucleation (more than three nuclei) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity by using a commercial kit (Sigma). The in situ detection of osteoclasts was carried out on TRAP-stained metastatic bone tissue sections. The number of osteoclasts per bone surface was enumerated by using a semiautomatic analyzer (Ibas 1, Leica, Heerbrugg, Switzerland). Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed using the unpaired Student's t test, and results were expressed as the mean ± S.E. These analyses were performed by using the StatView version 5.0 software. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Structural and Functional Characterization of Angiostatin-inducible MDA-MB-231/B02-GFP Cell Transfectants—Two clones, B02-GFP/mAST#1 and -#2, were selected on the basis of their specific and high expression levels of luciferase and angiostatin upon doxycycline withdrawal (Fig. 1a). As a negative control cell line, mock-transfected cells were established by replacing the cDNA for angiostatin to β-galactosidase (B02-GFP/βGal) (Fig. 1a). Therefore, the ability of angiostatin to inhibit angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo was examined. Conditioned media from B02-GFP/mAST clones cultured in the absence of doxycycline induced a 50–60% inhibition of VEGF-mediated endothelial cell proliferation (Fig. 1b) and capillary-like tube formation in vitro (data not shown). To test the ability of angiostatin to inhibit angiogenesis in vivo, angiostatin was first purified by lysine-Sepharose chromatography (Fig. 1c) and then used to study its effect on VEGF-induced angiogenesis with a Matrigel plug assay. As shown in Fig. 1d, plugs containing VEGF were well vascularized, whereas VEGF-induced angiogenesis was almost completely inhibited in the presence of angiostatin. Image analysis quantification showed that angiostatin induced an 80% reduction of the neovascularization (Fig. 1e). Overall, our data indicate that angiostatin produced by the transfectants was biologically active. These results were in complete agreement with previous reports showing that angiostatin inhibits endothelial cell proliferation (16O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A. Moses M. Lane W.S. Cao Y. Sage E.H. Folkman J. Cell. 1994; 79: 315-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3172) Google Scholar) and in vivo angiogenesis in the Matrigel implant model (17Gyorffy S. Palmer K. Gauldie J. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 1137-1147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Angiostatin Inhibits the Formation of Osteolytic Bone Metastases Caused by Breast Cancer Cells in Vivo—We have shown previously that fluorescent MDA-MB-231/B02-GFP#2 cells have the unique property of metastasizing to bone after intravenous tumor cell inoculation into the tail vein of female BALB/C nude mice (9Peyruchaud O. Winding B. Pecheur I. Serre C.M. Delmas P. Clezardin P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 2027-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 10Pecheur I. Peyruchaud O. Serre C.M. Guglielmi J. Voland C. Bourre F. Margue C. Cohen-Solal M. Buffet A. Kieffer N. Clezardin P. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1266-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In addition, radiography and external fluorescence imaging of live metastatic animals allow the measurement of the extent of bone destruction and tumor burden, respectively (9Peyruchaud O. Winding B. Pecheur I. Serre C.M. Delmas P. Clezardin P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 2027-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Using this bone metastasis model, the follow-up of B02-GFP/mAST#2-bearing animals by radiography showed a marked decrease in the extent of osteolytic lesions in untreated animals compared with that observed in doxycycline-fed animals (Fig. 2, a and b and Table I). The extent of tumor burden in B02-GFP/mAST#2-bearing animals was also significantly decreased upon doxycycline withdrawal (Fig. 2, c and d and Table I). Importantly, as shown in Fig. 2, b and d, the derepression of angiostatin did not delay the occurrence of bone metastases but rather inhibited their progression, indicating that angiostatin did not prevent the homing of breast cancer cells to bone. Similar results were obtained when comparing untreated and doxycycline-treated animals bearing B02-GFP/mAST#1 cells (Table I).Table IQuantification of osteolytic lesions (radiography) and skeletal tumor burden (fluorescence imaging) in untreated and doxycycline (dox)-treated animals bearing parental B02-GFP#2 breast cancer cells, mock-transfected B02-GFP/βGal cells, or angiostatin-expressing B02-GFP/mAST#1 and #2 cells Human breast cancer cells were inoculated intravenously into nude mice, and 29 days after tumor cell inoculation, animals were analyzed by radiography and noninvasive fluorescence imaging for the presence of bone metastases.Cell linesRadiographyaData are the mean ± SE (in mm2) of n animalsFluorescence imagingaData are the mean ± SE (in mm2) of n animals+ Dox (n)- Dox (n)Inhibition+ Dox (n)- Dox (n)Inhibition%%B02-GFP#28.5 ± 0.9 (4)11.6 ± 1.3 (9)018.3 ± 1.8 (4)19.2 ± 3.1 (9)0B02-GFP/βGal7.0 ± 0.7 (7)6.5 ± 0.7 (6)011.7 ± 2.3 (7)14.3 ± 3.0 (6)0B02-GFP/mAST#18.9 ± 0.3 (9)1.7 ± 0.5 (9)81bp < 0.01 using unpaired Student's t test23.0 ± 1.6 (9)0.4 ± 0.2 (9)98bp < 0.01 using unpaired Student's t testB02-GFP/mAST#28.1 ± 1.3 (9)2.7 ± 0.8 (12)66bp < 0.01 using unpaired Student's t test26.7 ± 6.4 (9)7.5 ± 2.2 (12)72bp < 0.01 using unpaired Student's t testa Data are the mean ± SE (in mm2) of n animalsb p < 0.01 using unpaired Student's t test Open table in a new tab Histological examination of metastatic long bones from doxycycline-fed animals revealed that most of the cancellous and cortical bone in proximal tibiae was destroyed and replaced by tumor cells that completely filled the bone marrow cavity (Fig. 2e). In contrast, upon derepression of angiostatin, the cortical bone remained intact and the cancellous bone was only partially destroyed, whereas small to moderate tumor foci were confined to the bone marrow cavity (Fig. 2e). Histomorphometric analyses of metastatic hind limbs confirmed radiographic and fluorescence analyses and showed that angiostatin not only inhibited the bone loss caused by breast cancer cells (Fig. 2f) but also drastically reduced the skeletal tumor burden (Fig. 2g). Angiostatin Does Not Inhibit the Growth of Subcutaneous MDA-MB-231/B02 Breast Tumor Xenografts—To determine whether angiostatin has a direct growth-inhibitory effect on MDA-MB-231/B02 breast cancer cells in vivo, B02-GFP/mAST cell lines were implanted subcutaneously into nude mice. Tumor growth of B02-GFP/mAST#1 and -#2 cells in animals was the same, regardless of the presence or absence of the doxycycline repressor (Fig. 3a and results not shown). This lack of effect of angiostatin on tumor growth could not be attributed to a defect of the Tet-Off repressing system, because the luciferase activity in tumor cell extracts from doxycycline-fed animals was drastically repressed when compared with that observed in untreated animals (Fig. 3b). Moreover, upon doxycycline withdrawal, circulating HA-tagged angiostatin was immunodetected at the expected size in the plasma of B02-GFP/mAST#1 tumor-bearing animals (Fig. 3a , inset), indicating that angiostatin degradation did not account for the absence of tumor growth inhibition. To further document this apparent lack of effect of angiostatin on tumor growth in vivo, the immunohistochemical analysis of tumor xenografts was carried out using an anti-CD31 antibody that specifically recognizes murine endothelial cells. There was no difference in the microvascular density of tumors from untreated and doxycycline-fed animals (Fig. 3c). Moreover, despite a substantial inhibition of osteolytic lesions and skeletal tumor burden in untreated animals, the extent of tumor vascularization in bone lesions from untreated and doxycycline-fed animals was the same, as judged by ink staining of tumor blood vessels (Fig. 3d). These results were rather unexpected, because angiostatin purified from B02-GFP/mAST cells was a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis in vivo (Fig. 1, d and e). Therefore, we hypothesized that B02-GFP/mAST#1 and -#2 cells could produce angiogenic factors that counterbalance the anti-angiogenic effect of angiostatin. Indeed, B02-GFP/βGal, B02-GFP/mAST#1 and -#2 cells produced substantial amounts of VEGF (between 6–18 ng/ml), irrespective of the presence or absence of doxycycline. Upon doxycycline withdrawal, the amount of angiostatin produced by B02-GFP/mAST#1 and -#2 cells varied between 178–339 ng/ml. Assuming a molecular mass of 38 kDa for angiostatin and 45 kDa for VEGF, the stoichiometric relationship of angiostatin to VEGF was about 30:1. Using this ratio, angiostatin (1500 ng/ml) did not inhibit angiogenesis induced by VEGF (50 ng/ml) in the Matrigel plug assay (results not shown), whereas it did so at a 10-fold higher concentration (Fig. 1, d and e). Therefore, it is most conceivable that VEGF produced by B02-GFP/mAST#1 and -#2 cells overrides the antiangiogenic effect of angiostatin, thus explaining why breast cancer tumor growth rates were similar in untreated and doxycycline-treated animals. However, it must be kept in mind that angiostatin inhibited bone metastasis formation (Fig. 2 and Table I), therefore suggesting that beyond its antiangiogenic activity, angiostatin had additional inhibitory effects on cells present at the bone metastatic site. Angiostatin production by B02-GFP/mAST#1 and -#2 cells did not modify the proliferation and invasion capabilities of transfectants in vitro as well as their adhesion to bone cortical slices, indicating that angiostatin in vivo was acting on cells other than metastatic cells (results not shown). Because bone-residing metastatic cells stimulate osteoclast-mediated bone resorption (2Guise T.A. Mundy G.R. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 18-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that angiostatin could directly inhibit osteoclast functions. Angiostatin Inhibits Osteoclast Activity in Situ and Osteoclast Generation in Vitro—Histological examination showed that there was a high number of TRAP-positive osteoclasts at the bone/tumor interface in metastatic hind limbs from doxycycline-fed animals, whereas TRAP staining was dramatically reduced in metastatic long bones from untreated animals (Fig. 4a). Histomorphometric quantification revealed that angiostatin expression induced a 77% decrease of the osteoclast number per millimeter of bone surface (Fig. 4b , N.Oc/BS). Moreover, purified angiostatin (10 μg/ml) inhibited the differentiation of mononuclear cells into multinuclear and TRAP-positive cells (i.e. mature osteoclasts) when cultured in the presence of M-CSF and RANK-L (Fig. 4c). Tumor-associated neovascularization is necessary for the growth and metastatic spread of solid tumors (4Woodhouse E.C. Chuaqui R.F. Liotta L.A. Cancer. 1997; 80: 1529-1537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Hanahan D. Folkman J. Cell. 1996; 86: 353-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6091) Google Scholar). The contribution of angiogenesis in the development of bone metastases caused by solid tumors is, however, largely unknown. To address this question, we used an experimental model of bone metastasis in which MDA-MB-231/B02 breast cancer cells were engineered to produce at the bone metastatic site a specific angiogenesis inhibitor, angiostatin. To study the function of angiostatin during bone metastasis formation, we used a Tet-Off system in which the derepression of angiostatin was achieved in the absence of doxycycline, thus avoiding any influence of the drug on the angiostatin-induced phenotype. Surprisingly, as opposed to the data presented here, Duivenvoorden et al. (18Duivenvoorden W.C. Popovic S.V. Lhotak S. Seidlitz E. Hirte H.W. Tozer R.G. Singh G. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1588-1591PubMed Google Scholar) have recently reported that the treatment of animals with subcutaneously implanted doxycycline-containing pellets (10 mg/pellet) decreases the formation of skeletal lesions caused by MDA-MB-231 cells. Different circulating doxycycline concentrations cannot account for the difference in results observed in the study by Duivenvoorden (18Duivenvoorden W.C. Popovic S.V. Lhotak S. Seidlitz E. Hirte H.W. Tozer R.G. Singh G. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1588-1591PubMed Google Scholar) and our own study, because the estimated doxycycline plasma concentration in our model was much higher (5 mg/liter) than that reported in their bone metastasis model (0.21 mg/liter). The reasons for this discrepancy are, therefore, currently unclear. However, despite a much higher doxycycline plasma concentration, we clearly observed no inhibitory effect of doxycycline on bone metastasis formation (Table I). Using two different angiostatin-inducible B02-GFP/mAST transfectants, we provided clear evidence that angiostatin markedly inhibited the progression of osteolytic lesions. Unexpectedly, although a large number of studies (including our own) already demonstrate that angiostatin exerts anti-angiogenic properties, we demonstrated here that angiostatin inhibited cancer-induced bone destruction through a direct inhibition of osteoclast functions. This contention is supported by the fact that (i) angiostatin substantially decreases the number of osteoclasts at the bone/tumor interface in metastatic hind limbs, and (ii) it inhibits osteoclast generation in vitro. In osteolytic lesions, there is a vicious circle in the bone microen-vironment wherein bone-residing metastatic cells stimulate osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, and bone-derived growth factors released from resorbed bone promote tumor growth (2Guise T.A. Mundy G.R. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 18-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Angiostatin interrupts this vicious circle. By inhibiting bone resorption, angiostatin indirectly limits the release of bone-derived growth factors which, in turn, reduces skeletal tumor growth. This assumption is supported by the fact that angiostatin reduces skeletal tumor burden (Fig. 2), whereas it does not inhibit the proliferation of B02-GFP/mAST#1 and -#2 cells in vitro (results not shown). The molecular mechanisms through which angiostatin inhibits osteoclast functions are currently unknown. In endothelial cells, angiostatin binds to integrin αvβ3 (19Tarui T. Majumdar M. Miles L.A. Ruf W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33564-33570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), angiomotin (20Troyanovsky B. Levchenko T. Mansson G. Matvijenko O. Holmgren L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1247-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), and cell-surface ATP synthase (21Moser T.L. Kenan D.J. Ashley T.A. Roy J.A. Goodman M.D. Misra U.K. Cheek D.J. Pizzo S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6656-6661Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Osteoclasts also express integrin αvβ3 (22Duong L.T. Lakkakorpi P. Nakamura I. Rodan G.A. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and integrin αvβ3 antagonists inhibit bone resorption in vivo (23Carron C.P. Meyer D.M. Engleman V.W. Rico J.G. Ruminski P.G. Ornberg R.L. Westlin W.F. Nickols G.A. J. Endocrinol. 2000; 165: 587-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that angiostatin inhibits bone resorption by binding to integrin αvβ3 expressed by osteoclasts. This very important question deserves further attention. In conclusion, this study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first one to demonstrate that angiostatin is a strong inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Besides its well known anti-angiogenic activity, therefore, angiostatin must be considered to be a very effective inhibitor of osteolytic bone metastases, thus broadening its potential clinical use in cancer therapy."

These techniques unambiguously indicate that SAMp73 binds to lipids. The binding involves protein surface attachment and partial membrane penetration, accompanied by changes in SAMp73 structure. p73 and p63 are members of the p53 gene family (1Kaghad M. Bonnet H.

Nature. 1997; 389: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). As the tumor suppressor p53, p73 and p63 are also transcription factors that contain an N-terminal transactivation domain, a sequence-specific DNA-binding domain, and an oligomerization domain with a high sequence homology to the corresponding domains of p53. For instance, p73 shares 63% identity with the DNA-binding region of p53 (including the conservation of all DNA-binding residues), 38% identity with the tetramerization domain, and 29% with the transactivation domain. Furthermore, p73 and p63 share a relative functional homology with p53, because they can both activate transcription from p53-responsive genes, stop the cell cycle, and induce apoptosis when overexpressed. Moreover, p73 is positively regulated in p53-deficient tumors in response to oncogene overexpression, and its expression is increased in several tumor types (1Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L.

It seems that in the absence of p53, p73 can take its place and induce apoptosis in tumoral cells, although the ultimate role of p73 in tumor suppression is still unclear (5Zaika A. Irwin M. Sansome C. Moll U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11310-11316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Unlike p53, p73 and p63 are only rarely mutated in the large number of tumors examined to date and thus they are unlikely to be classical tumor suppressor genes. Also in contrast to p53, in mice lacking p73 there have been described severe developmental abnormalities, such as hippocampal dysgenesis, hydrocephalus, chronic infections, and inflammation, as well as abnormalities in pheromone sensory pathways; however, no increase in the tumor formation rate is detected (as it happened in p53 knockout mice (8Yang A.

Nature. 2000; 404: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar)).Conversely to p53, p73 and p63 contain additional C-terminal extensions. In both proteins, these extensions show alternative splicing, which results in at least six C-terminal variants for p73 (α–ϕ) and three for p63 (α–γ) (1Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L.

These isoforms have different transcription and biological properties, and their expression patterns change among normal tissues (9De Laurenzi V. Costanzo A. Barcaroli D. Terrinoni A. Falco M. Annicchiarico-Petruzzelli M. Levero M. Mellino G. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1763-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). For example, p73β transactivates many p53-responsive promoters, and p73α does so to a lesser extent (2Jost C.A. Marin M.C. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nature. 1997; 389: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar, 3Zhu J. Jiang J. Zhou W. Chen X. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5061-5065PubMed Google Scholar, 4Di Como C.J. Gaiddon C. Prives C. Mol.

Nonetheless, the role of the several isoforms in cellular function is far from being fully understood, and it has been shown that their differential regulatory roles are highly cell context-dependent (11Freebern W.J.

Koonin E.V. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). SAM domains are protein modules of ∼65–70 amino acids found in diverse proteins whose functions range from signal transduction to transcriptional repression (12Bork P. Koonin E.V. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Interestingly enough, it has been reported that the α isoform of p73 (and also that of p63) has its p53-like function dramatically reduced in comparison with other non-SAM-containing isoforms, suggesting that SAM domain could be responsible for those functional differences (12Bork P. Koonin E.V. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 13Thanos C.D. Bowie J.U. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1708-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The structure of the SAM domain of p73, SAMp73 (the C-terminal region of the p73α protein comprising residues 487–554 of the intact protein), has been resolved by NMR (14Chi S.-W. Ayed A. Arrowsmith C.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4438-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and x-ray crystallography (15Wang W.K. Proctor M.R. Buckle A.M. Bycroft M. Chen Y.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The domain (residues 487–554 of the full p73α protein) contains a single tryptophan residue, which could be used as a spectroscopic probe to monitor the protein conformational changes. The structure of the domain reveals a small five-helix bundle composed of four α-helices (residues 491–499 (helix 1), 506–511 (helix 2), 525–531 (helix 4), and 538–550 (helix 5)) and a small 310-helix (residues 517–520 (helix 3)). The SAMp73 has structural similarity with two ephrin receptors tyrosine kinases (14Chi S.-W. Ayed A. Arrowsmith C.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4438-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and the spatial arrangement of the bundle is similar to that of SAM domains found in other proteins (13Thanos C.D. Bowie J.U. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1708-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). SAM domains are putatively considered to be responsible for regulating protein functions via self-association or by association with other domains (17Schultz J. Pointing C.P. Hoffmann K. Bork P. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), but the exact function of SAMp73 is not known. The crystal structure of SAMp73 reveals a dimeric organization (15Wang W.K. Proctor M.R. Buckle A.M. Bycroft M. Chen Y.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 769-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), but the NMR structure is monomeric (14Chi S.-W. Ayed A. Arrowsmith C.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4438-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), suggesting that dimer formation in the crystal is an effect of crystal packing rather than a real physiological state; furthermore, equilibrium sedimentation experiments have shown that SAMp73 is monomeric under a wide range of experimental conditions (14Chi S.-W. Ayed A. Arrowsmith C.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4438-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 18Barrera F.N. Garzon M.T. Gomez F.J. Neira J.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 743-753Google Scholar).Because of its small size (67 residues long), we are using SAMp73 as a model for folding, stability, and macromolecular binding studies. We have embarked in the study of the interactions of SAMp73 with other macromolecules, namely proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids. Here, we explore its lipid binding properties toward PA (an anionic lipid) and PC (a zwitterionic lipid). The results indicate that SAMp73 interacts with both lipids. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first report of the lipid binding properties of a SAM domain, and it raises new questions about the role of this domain in p73 function.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsImidazole, Trizma base, and NaCl were from Sigma. The Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin was from Invitrogen. Egg yolk PC and PA, DMPA, and DMPC were obtained from Avanti Polar lipids (Birminghman, AL). TMA-DPH was from Molecular Probes. Spectroscopy grade N,N-dimethylformamide was from Merck. Dialysis tubing was from Spectrapore, with a molecular mass cut-off of 3500 Da. Standard suppliers were used for all other chemicals. Water was deionized and purified on a Millipore system.Protein Expression and PurificationThe SAMp73 clone, comprising residues 487–554 of the intact p73α and a His6 tag at the N terminus, was kindly donated by C.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4438-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and no differences were observed with that obtained by x-ray, where the His6 tag had been removed (14Chi S.-W. Ayed A.

Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar) and purified using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography. To eliminate any protein or DNA bound to the resin, co-eluting with the protein, an additional gel filtration chromatography step, was carried out by using a Superdex 75 16/60 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) running on an AKTA FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). Protein purity was larger than 95% as concluded from visual inspection in the SDS protein-denaturing gels and from matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight experiments (data not shown). The yield was 30–35 mg of protein/liter of culture. The samples were dialyzed extensively against 0.2 m NaCl, lyophilized, and stored at –80 °C. The protein concentration was calculated from the absorbance of a stock solution measured at 280 nm, using the extinction coefficients of model compounds (20Pace C.N. Scholtz J.M. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 253-259Google Scholar).Lipid Vesicles and Sample PreparationLipid vesicles were prepared by dissolving the required amount of lipid (PA, PC, DMPA, and DMPC) in chloroform/methanol (1:1 v/v) and drying, first under a gaseous nitrogen stream and then under vacuum for 3 h to remove all traces of organic solvents. The thin layer formed was resuspended in water (resulting in a 27 mm lipid concentration) while being vortexed and warmed gently (usually 10 °C over the Tc for DMPA and DMPC and at 55 °C for PA and PC). After lipid hydration, the PA and PC resulting multilamellar liposome suspensions were sonicated, using a Branson Sonifier model 250 fitted with a microtip (Branson, Shelton, CT) until a clear suspension of small unilamellar vesicles was obtained (typically 1 min for PA and 5 min, in bursts of 1 min, for PC while being cooled in ice). These preparations have been shown to yield vesicles with diameters ranging from 300 to 600 Å (21Sanghera N. Pinheiro T.J.T. J. Mol.

The sonicated samples were then centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 10,000 rpm for 2 min to remove any titanium particle shed from the microtip during sonication. No significant lipid pellet was observed after the centrifugation.The lipid-protein samples were prepared by mixing the corresponding volumes of protein and lipid solutions, NaCl and Tris, pH 7; salt and buffer concentrations were carefully set to 200 and 10 mm, respectively, from 10-fold concentrated stocks, and the final volume was adjusted with water. All of the samples were mixed thoroughly and equilibrated usually for 20 min before the corresponding experiment was carried out. The pH of the samples was measured with an ultrathin Aldrich electrode in a Radiometer (Copenhagen) pH meter to discard differences between calculated and measured pH values.Far-UV CD MeasurementsCircular dichroism spectra were collected on a Jasco J810 spectropolarimeter fitted with a thermostated cell holder and interfaced with a Neslab RTE-111 water bath. The instrument was periodically calibrated with (+)10-camphorsulphonic acid. Isothermal wavelength spectra were acquired at a scan speed of 50 nm/min with a response time of 2 s and averaged over seven scans at 25 °C. Far-UV measurements were performed using 30 μm of protein in 10 mm of the above described buffer, using 0.1-cm-pathlength cells (Hellma). The corresponding backgrounds were subtracted from the final spectra, and they usually accounted less than the 5% of the sample ellipticities. Only at lipid concentrations over 5 mm were more intense backgrounds observed, but they never accounted for more than the 15% of the total protein ellipticity signal (data not shown). Subtracted spectra were smoothed avoiding alteration of spectral intensities. To further check that the measurements were not influenced by the scattering derived from the presence of the lipid, data were also analyzed without making subtractions, and similar results were obtained (data not shown). Ellipticities are expressed as mean residue ellipticities, [Θ], in units of deg cm2 dmol–1, according to Equation 1,[Θ]=Θ10lcN(Eq. 1) where Θ is the observed ellipticity, c is the molar concentration of the protein, l is the cell pathlength (in cm), and N is the number of amino acid residues in the sequence.Fluorescence MeasurementsFluorescence spectra for SAMp73 were collected either on a SLM 8000 spectrofluorometer (Spectronics Instruments, Urbana, IL) interfaced with a Haake water bath or in a Cary Eclipse spectrofluorometer (Varian) interfaced with a Peltier cell. A 0.5-cm-pathlength quartz cell (Hellma) was used for measurements in the SLM spectrofluorometer, and a 1-cm-pathlength quartz cell (Hellma) was used in the Varian spectrofluorometer. All of the experiments were carried out at 25 °C.Steady State Fluorescence Measurements—The protein samples were excited at 280 and 295 nm to characterize possible different behaviors of tryptophan and/or tyrosine residues (20Pace C.N. Scholtz J.M. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 253-259Google Scholar). It was observed that both spectra were similar. The rest of the experiments were acquired by excitation at 280 nm. The slit width was 4 nm for the excitation light and 8 nm for the emission light; the integration time was 1 s, and the increment of wavelength was set to 1 nm between 310 and 400 nm. Blank corrections were made in all spectra. The protein concentration was 3 μm.Resonance Energy Transfer (RET) Measurements—The efficiency of energy transfer (E) can be defined according to Equation 2 (22Ferrer-Montiel A. González-Ros J.M. Ferragut J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 937: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar),E=1-(IF/IFo)(Eq. 2) where IF and IFo are the fluorescence emission intensity of the donor in the presence and in the absence of the energy acceptor, respectively. Aliquots of a concentrated TMA-DPH stock (in N,N-dimethylformamide) were added to a cuvette containing the lipid-protein mixtures, and after 90 min of incubation, the changes of tryptophan emission fluorescence were monitored upon excitation at 280 nm. The effect of the acceptor (TMA-DPH) absorption at donor (tryptophan) emission maximum (340 nm) was corrected as described by Coutinho and Prieto (23Coutinho A. Prieto M. J. Chem. Ed. 1993; 70: 425Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Monitoring of the emission wavelength at 330 nm (where TMA-DPH absorption is clearly reduced) yielded similar results (data not shown). No correction for the acceptor absorption at donor excitation wavelength was made because TMA-DPH absorbance at 280 nm was negligible. The extinction molar coefficient, ϵ, for TMA-DPH was that provided by Molecular Probes (ϵ = 75000 m–1 cm–1). The slit width was 2 nm for the excitation light and 4 nm for the emission light.The approach developed by Wolber and Hudson (24Wolber P.K. Hudson B.S. Biophys. J. 1979; 28: 197-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) was used to obtain the theoretical expected value for the efficiency of energy transfer in a bilayer two-dimensional system. This theoretical model represents an analytical solution of the Förster energy transfer problem when: (i) both the donors and acceptors are randomly distributed in a plane and (ii) donors are excluded from a region surrounding each acceptor. According to this model, the relative quantum yield, qr, is defined as follows.qr=1-E(Eq. 3) The relative quantum yield was theoretically calculated for different Re/Ro ratios at increasing C values, where Re is the distance between donor and acceptor at their closest approach, Ro is the critical radius of transfer (also defined as the distance at which the transfer efficiency is 50%), and C is the concentration of acceptors per Ro2 (where the area of one PA molecule is 70 Å2 and that of PC molecule is 80 Å2). Ro was calculated according to the equations developed by Förster and others (25Förster T. A. Naurforsch. A. Astrophys. Phys. Chem. 1959; 4: 321-327Google Scholar, 26Rapaport D. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6502-6509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar),Ro=9876(Jκ2n-4ΦD)1/6(in̊)(Eq. 4) where J is the overlap integral, which measures the degree of overlap between the donor emission spectrum and the acceptor absorption spectrum; κ2 is the orientation factor, which was taken to be 2/3 (27Stryer L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 819-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar); n is the refractive index of the medium, which was taken as 1.44 (that is, the value of the bilayer interior) (28Davenport J. Dale R.E. Bisby R.H. Cundal R.B. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4097-4108Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar); and ΦD is the quantum yield of the donor in the absence of acceptor. The quantum yield of the sole tryptophan was determined using 5-metoxiindole as a quantum yield standard, as described by Lakowicz (29Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Press, New York1999Crossref Google Scholar). In the presence of PA, the calculated ΦD was 0.228, and in the presence of PC, ΦD was 0.179. The overlap integral, J, was calculated by Equation 5,J=∫fD(λ)εA(λ)λ4dλ∫fD(λ)dλ(inM-1cm3)(Eq. 5) where fD(λ) is the donor fluorescence intensity at each wavelength, λ, and ϵA (λ) is the acceptor molar extinction coefficient at each wavelength. The absorption spectra were taken in a Beckman DU 640 spectrophotometer.Partition Coefficient DeterminationA parameter that can be used to quantify the extent of lipid-protein interactions is the partition coefficient, Kp, which is described by the following equation,Kp=n1/V1nw/Vw(Eq. 6) where nl is the number of moles of the protein in lipid, nw is the number of moles of the protein in aqueous solution, Vl is the volume of the lipid phase, and Vw is the volume of aqueous phase. The variation in a spectroscopic parameter, if it is proportional to the concentration of protein bound to the membrane, can be used to determine the lipid partition coefficient according to Refs. 30Eftink M.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 278: 221-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar and 31Mateo C.R. Prieto M. Micol V. Shapiro S. Villalaín J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1509: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar,X=XmaxKpγ[lipid]1+Kpγ[lipid](Eq. 7) where X is the spectroscopic parameter that changes upon addition of increasing amounts of lipid (in our studies, the [Θ], or the fluorescence emission maximum and the fluorescence intensity); Xmax is the maximum value of X, and γ is the molar volume of the lipid (which has values of 0.7 m–1 for PA and 0.8 m–1 for PC (32Marsh D. CRC Handbook of Lipid Bilayers. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1990Google Scholar)). Fitting by nonlinear least squares analysis was carried out by using the general curve fit option of Kaleidagraph (Abelbeck software) on a personal computer.Differential Scanning CalorimetryDSC experiments were performed with a MicroCal MC-2 (Microcal Inc., Northampton, MA) differential scanning calorimeter interfaced to a computer equipped with a Data Translation DT-2801 A/D converter board for instrument control and automatic data collection. The samples were prepared as described (see before), but DMPA-containing samples were prepared with 0.1 mm EDTA to avoid perturbations in the phase transition created by the presence of Ca2+. NaCl concentration was carefully kept constant to avoid artifacts caused by the positive ions during the DMPA phase transition. The samples were degassed under vacuum for 10 min with gentle stirring prior to being loaded into the calorimetric cell. Differences in the heat capacity between the sample and the reference cell, filled with buffer solution, were obtained by raising the temperature at a constant rate of 60 °C/h over a temperature range of 10–60 °C. At these temperatures thermal unfolding of the protein is not expected (18Barrera F.N. Garzon M.T. Gomez F.J. Neira J.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 743-753Google Scholar). The excess heat capacity functions were obtained after base-line subtraction and correction for the instrument time response. A series of three consecutive scans were at least acquired to ensure scan-to-scan reproducibility. Although the second and third scans were identical, only the third scan was used for calculation of the transition temperature and the enthalpy. The Microcal Origin software was used for data acquisition and analysis.RESULTSFar-UV CD ExperimentsWe used far-UV CD in the analysis of the protein-lipid binding as a spectroscopic probe that is sensitive to protein secondary structure (33Woody R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 34-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 34Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Curr. Protein Peptide Sci. 2000; 1: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). SAMp73 in solution shows an intense far-UV CD spectrum with the features of an α-helical protein, with minima at 222 and 208 nm (Fig. 1), although interference from the aromatic residues cannot be ruled out (33Woody R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 34-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 34Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Curr. Protein Peptide Sci. 2000; 1: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). To study the lipid binding properties of SAMp73, we first tested whether its CD spectrum changed upon incubation with either anionic (PA) or zwitterionic (PC) lipid membranes. It was observed that the negatively charged lipid vesicles of PA induced a significant change in the SAMp73 CD spectrum, with a marked increase in the ellipticity (in absolute value) at 222 nm and a larger change in that at 208 nm (Fig. 1). The latter could indicate either an increase in the random coil population or changes in the environment of the aromatic residues (33Woody R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 34-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 34Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Curr. Protein Peptide Sci. 2000; 1: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Binding of the protein to zwitterionic PC vesicles induced also an enhancement in the ellipticity of the SAMp73 spectrum, but its extent was smaller than that observed in PA. In this case, the ellipticity at 208 and 222 nm increased to nearly the same extent.The partition coefficients, Kp, obtained from the ellipticity changes at 208 nm upon increase in lipid concentration were 1360 ± 190 for PA and 3967 ± 970 for PC (Fig. 2) (Equation 6). Similar partition coefficients were also determined from the ellipticity changes at 222 nm. These partition coefficients allowed us to determine the population of SAMp73 distributed between the aqueous and lipid phases at a given lipid concentration. The molar fraction of a protein in the aqueous solution, Xw, can be calculated as follows (35Contreras L.M. de Almeida R.F. Villalaín J. Fedorov A. Prieto M. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2273-2283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).Xw=11+Kpγ[lipid](Eq. 8) Fig. 2Binding constant determination by CD. Mean residue ellipticity changes at 208 nm (Δ[Θ]208) were followed at increasing lipid concentration in PC (A) and PA (B). Kp values were obtained by fitting to Equation 6 (solid lines). The protein concentration was 30 μm. The conditions were 10 mm Tris, pH 7, 0.2 m NaCl, 25 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)For instance, in PC at 3 mm, the percentage of SAMp73 in the aqueous phase was 9.5%, whereas for PA at 3 mm, it was 26%.Fluorescence ExperimentsSteady State Measurements—The intrinsic protein fluorescence is a highly sensitive probe to monitor protein-lipid binding (36Surewicz W.K.

Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 7333-7400Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). SAMp73 has one tryptophan and five tyrosine residues. Trp542, in the numbering of intact p73α, is in the middle of helix 5 forming the hydrophobic core of the protein; Tyr487 is the N-terminal residue; Tyr508 is in the middle of helix 2; Tyr518 and Tyr537 are at the beginnings of helices 3 and 5, respectively; and Tyr554 is the C-terminal residue. The emission fluorescence spectrum of native SAMp73 is dominated by the emission of the sole tryptophan residue (18Barrera F.N. Garzon M.T. Gomez F.J. Neira J.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 743-753Google Scholar), with a maximum at 336 nm at neutral pH, which indicates that the tryptophan is partially buried within the protein structure, as concluded from the x-ray (15Wang W.K.

https://openalex.org/W2063460207,"Fre1p is a metalloreductase in the yeast plasma membrane that is essential to uptake of environmental Cu2+ and Fe3+. Fet3p is a multicopper oxidase in this membrane essential for high affinity iron uptake. In the uptake of Fe3+, Fre1p produces Fe2+ that is a substrate for Fet3p; the Fe3+ produced by Fet3p is a ligand for the iron permease, Ftr1p. Deletion of FET3 leads to iron deficiency; this deletion also causes a copper sensitivity not seen in wild type. Deletion of FTR1 leads to copper sensitivity also. Production in the ftr1Δ strain of an iron-uptake negative Ftr1p mutant, Ftr1p(RAGLA), suppressed this copper sensitivity. This Ftr1p mutant supported the plasma membrane targeting of active Fet3p that is blocked in the parental ftr1Δ strain. A ferroxidase-negative Fet3p did not suppress the copper sensitivity in a fet3Δ strain, although it supported the plasma membrane localization of the Fet3p·Ftr1p complex. Thus, loss of membrane-associated Fet3p oxidase activity correlated with copper sensitivity. Furthermore, in vitro Cu1+ was shown to be an excellent substrate for Fet3p. Last, the copper sensitivity of the fet3Δ strain was suppressed by co-deletion of FRE1, suggesting that the cytotoxic species was Cu1+. In contrast, deletion of CTR1 or of FET4 did not suppress the copper sensitivity in the fet3Δ strain; these genes encode the two major copper transporters in laboratory yeast strains. This result indicated that the apparent cuprous ion toxicity was not due to excess intracellular copper. These biochemical and physiologic results indicate that at least with respect to cuprous and ferrous ions, Fet3p can be considered a metallo-oxidase and appears to play an essential role in both iron and copper homeostasis in yeast. Its functional homologs, e.g. ceruloplasmin and hephaestin, could play a similar role in mammals."

Bone metabolism in health and disease is based on a self-regulating cellular event. The two major processes of bone remodeling, bone formation and resorption, are closely regulated by intercellular signaling involving soluble factors, systemic hormones, and cellular adhesion (1Manolagas S.C.

Osteoblasts play a central role in bone formation by synthesizing multiple bone matrix proteins and by differentiation into osteocytes. However, osteoblasts also regulate osteoclast maturation by producing bone-resorbing cytokines and by direct cell attachment, resulting in bone resorption (6Rodan G.A. J. Cell.

We have previously reported that human osteoblasts express intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and that interaction between ICAM-1, expressed on osteoblasts, and leukocyte function-associated antigen (LFA)-1, expressed on monocytes, is required for osteoclast maturation by RANKL on osteoblasts (12Tanaka Y.

Adhesion molecules play a fundamental role in cell-to-cell and cell-to-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions. However, recent findings have indicated that certain adhesion molecules not only function as glue but also regulate several cellular functions by transducing signaling. We have reported that ICAM-1 on rheumatoid synovial cells induced transcription of interleukin-1β by activation of a nuclear factor, AP-1, and that stimulation of β1 integrin up-regulated ICAM-1 and Fas, and Fas mediated apoptosis of rheumatoid synovial cells through focal adhesion kinase (FAK) (13Koyama Y.

These results prompted us to investigate the adhesion molecules involved in regulating the expression of other adhesion molecules, such as ICAM-1 and RANKL, on human osteoblasts. Cell adhesion to matrices is primarily mediated by integrins, cell surface receptors that comprise an expanding family of transmembrane heterodimers of α and β subunits (15Brakebusch C. Bouvard D.

Interaction of integrins with their protein ligands increases tyrosine phosphorylation and triggers the assembly of cytoskeletal proteins, signaling complexes including FAKs, and their substrates into membrane-substratum junctions referred to as focal adhesions (19Sieg D.J.

Although osteoblasts are always surrounded by and encounter ECMs including type I collagen and fibronectin mainly through β1 integrin, the relevance of β1 integrin to the intracellular signaling and functions in osteoblasts remains unclear. It is well established that osteoblast differentiation and maturation are regulated by their interaction with ECMs such as type I collagen (24Xiao G. Wang D. Benson M.D. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T.

However, such an adhesive interaction may act on osteoblasts to modulate bone metabolism, not only bone formation by activating osteoblasts to proliferate and synthesize bone matrix protein but also bone resorption by indirectly activating osteoclast function and differentiation mediated through osteoblasts. The aim of the present study was to determine the role of β1 integrin-mediated signaling in the regulation of cell surface adhesion molecules on osteoblasts. Our results demonstrate that engagement of β1 integrin by a specific antibody or ligand matrices up-regulated ICAM-1 and RANKL expression on osteoblasts and induced osteoclast formation via tyrosine kinase, especially FAK.

When cell monolayers were confluent after the 6–8-week culture, the explants were removed, and the cells were replated and incubated, resulting in new cellular outgrowth and eventually a confluent monolayer of cells. At confluence, the cells were trypsinized, passaged at a 1:3 split ratio, and recultured. The medium was changed twice each week, and the cells were used after three to seven passages. The obtained cells showed a flattened polygonal shape with multiple spindle legs and possessed characteristics of osteoblast-like phenotype including osteocalcin, bone sialoprotein, type I collagen, and bone alkaline phosphatase as described previously (27Tanaka Y. Morimoto I. Nakano Y. Okada Y. Hirota S. Nomura S. Nakamura T. Eto S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10: 1462-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Antibodies and Other Reagents—The following monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were used as purified Igs in preparation of staining and analysis of cell surface or cytoplasmic molecules: control mAb thy1.2 (BD Biosciences), human CD29 (β1 integrin) mAb MAB13, human CD18 (β2) mAb TS1/18 (kindly provided by Dr. K. M. Yamada, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), human CD61 (β3) mAb, human CD49a (α1) mAb TS2/7, human CD49b (α2) mAb, human CD49c (α3) mAb, human CD49d (α4) mAb NIH49d-1, human CD49e (α5) mAb MAB16, human CD49f (α6) mAb NIH49f-1, human CD51 (αv) mAb 23C6, human CD54 (ICAM-1) mAb 84H10 (kindly provided by Dr. S. Shaw, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), anti-human RANKL mAb (Sigma), human CD106 (VCAM-1) mAb 2G7 (kindly provided by Dr. W. Newman, Otsuka America, Rockville, MD), major histocompatibility complex class I mAb W6/32, and anti-glycophorin mAb 10F7 (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA). A human wild-type FAK expression plasmid (VSV-FAK), a human focal adhesion targeting domain (FAT) expression plasmid (VSV-FAT), and a human FAK-related non-kinase (FRNK) expression plasmid (VSV-FRNK) were constructed as described previously (28Tamura M. Gu J. Matsumoto K. Aota S. Parsons R. Yamada K.M. Science. 1998; 280: 1614-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar, 29Gu J. Tamura M. Pankov R. Danen E.H. Takino T. Matsumoto K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 389-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Multiple inhibitors of intracytoplasmic signaling including wortmannin (Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan; a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-K) inhibitor), H7 and staurosporine (Seikagaku, Tokyo, Japan; protein kinase C inhibitors), and herbimycin A (Sigma) and genistein (Calbiochem) (tyrosine kinase inhibitors) were applied to each assay system, and all reagents were used at the indicated concentrations. At these concentrations, none of these inhibitors produced cytotoxic effects on synovial cells as confirmed by trypan blue staining. Stimulation of Osteoblasts by β 1 Integrin Using mAbs and Substrates—After cells were cultured to subconfluence, the medium was changed to DMEM containing 1% FCS on the day before assay. The obtained cells were then incubated with anti-CD29 (β1 integrin) mAbs such as MAB13 and control mAbs (10 μg/ml) in DMEM without FCS for 30 min at 37 °C. Signal inhibitors were added at the indicated concentration for a 30-min incubation prior to cell stimulation. After washing the cells three times, 1 μg/ml goat anti-rat IgG-Fc was added as the second Ab for β1 cross-linking. The cells were then incubated in DMEM without FCS at 37 °C for the indicated duration. Purified fibronectin (10 μg/ml), collagen type I (10 μg/ml), and control bovine serum albumin (10 μg/ml, Wako) were applied to 6-well plastic plates in Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS at 4 °C overnight. Binding sites on plastic were subsequently blocked with Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS, 2.5% bovine serum albumin for 2–3 h at 37 °C to reduce nonspecific attachment of the cells. Subsequently plates were washed three times with PBS, and the cells were added to each well as described above and were incubated in DMEM without FCS at 37 °C for the indicated duration. After the incubation, the plates were washed twice with PBS and treated with trypsin for 1 min at 37 °C. DMEM containing 10% FCS was added to stop trypsinization. After harvesting from the wells, the obtained cells were washed with PBS and were settled in medium suitable for the following experiments. Transfection of Plasmids—A human wild-type FAK expression plasmid (VSV-FAK), a FAT expression plasmid (VSV-FAT), and a FRNK expression plasmid (VSV-FRNK) were introduced into osteoblasts using a cationic liposome-mediated transfection method. Plasmids (2.5 μg) dissolved in 100 μl of serum-free medium (OPTI-MEM, Invitrogen) were mixed with 5 μl of Lipofectin reagent (LipofectAMINE 2000™, Invitrogen) in the same volume of OPTI-MEM and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The plasmids and liposome complex were added to osteoblasts plated in a 6-well culture dish, incubated for 3 h in OPTI-MEM, and then replaced with DMEM containing 10% FCS for 24 h. The expression of VSV-FAK, VSV-FAT, and VSV-FRNK in osteoblasts was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis using anti-VSV Ab after their transfection. High expression of the VSV was observed, and 50–80% of the cells were transfected by intracellular flow cytometric analysis. A marked difference in the transfection efficiency among all three vectors was not observed in osteoblasts, and none of these vectors produced cytotoxic effects on osteoblasts as confirmed by trypan blue staining (data not shown). Flow Microfluorometry—Staining and flow cytometric analysis of osteoblasts were conducted by standard procedures as described previously (18Tanaka Y. Albelda S.M. Horgan K.J. van Seventer G.A. Shimizu Y. Newman W. Hallam J. Newman P.J. Buck C.A. Shaw S. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) using a FACScan (BD Biosciences). In brief, 2 × 105 cells were incubated with negative control mAb thy1.2, integrin β1 mAb, β2 mAb, β3 mAb, α1 mAb, α2 mAb, α3 mAb, α4 mAb, α5 mAb, α6 mAb, αv mAb, CD54 (ICAM-1) mAb, RANKL mAb, or CD106 (VCAM-1) mAb in FACS medium consisting of Hanks' balanced salt solution (Nissui, Tokyo, Japan), 0.5% human serum albumin (Yoshitomi, Osaka, Japan), and 0.2% NaN3 (Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing the cells three times with FACS medium, they were further incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG Ab, goat anti-rabbit IgG Ab, or rabbit anti-goat IgG Ab for 30 min at 4 °C. The staining of cells with mAbs was detected using FACScan. Quantification of cell surface antigens on single cells was calculated using standard beads (QIFKIT, Dako Japan, Kyoto, Japan) as already described (30Tanaka Y. Minami Y. Mine S. Hirano H. Fujimoto H. Fujii K. Saito K. Tsukada J. van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Kataoka T. Eto S. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6209-6216PubMed Google Scholar, 31Tanaka Y. Mine S. Figdor C.G. Wake A. Hirano H. Tsukada J. Aso M. Fujii K. Saito K. van Kooyk Y. Eto S. Blood. 1998; 91: 3909-3919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The data were used for the construction of the calibration curve (mean fluorescence intensity (MFI)) against antibody binding capacity (ABC). The cell specimen was analyzed on the FACScan, and ABC was calculated by interpolation on the calibration curve. When the green fluorescence laser detector was set at the 450 level in the FACScan, ABC = 414.45 × exp(0.0092 × MFI) (R 2 = 0.9999). Subsequently specific ABC was obtained after corrections for background, apparent ABC of the negative control mAb thy1.2. Specific ABC corresponds to the mean number of accessible antigenic sites per cell, referred to as antigen density and expressed in sites/cell. Coculture of Osteoblasts and Monocytes and Subsequent Staining of Tartrate-resistant Acid Phosphatase—Osteoblasts were seeded onto 24-well multiwell dishes (1 × 105 cells/well) and cultured to subconfluence. Then osteoblasts, with or without transfection of several plasmids as mentioned above, were stimulated by cross-linking with specific mAb for 6 h. Purified peripheral blood CD14+ monocytes from healthy donors (1 × 106 cells/well) were added to osteoblasts, and they were cocultured for 9 days in DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated FCS in the presence of 10–7m 1α,25(OH)2D3. Osteoclasts were cytochemically stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP, Sigma) as described previously (32Kotake S. Sato K. Kim K.J. Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Nakamura I. Yamaguchi A. Kishimoto T. Suda T. Kashiwazaki S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The number of TRAP-positive multinuclear cells (MNCs) that contained more than three nuclei was counted by light microscopy. Statistical Analysis—Data were expressed as mean ± S.D. of the number of indicated patients. Differences from the control were examined for statistical significance by analysis of variance followed by posthoc Scheffe's F-test. A p value less than 0.05 denoted the presence of a statistically significant difference. β 1 Integrin Was Highly Expressed on Primary Human Osteoblastic Cells—Initially we assessed the expression of various cell surface functional molecules on primary human osteoblastic cells using FACScan. Fig. 1 shows the number of 12 representative molecules, including integrins, ICAM-1, and RANKL, on osteoblasts. Among the screened molecules, β1 integrin was highly expressed on osteoblasts. Among α subunits of integrins, α2, α3, α4, α5, α6, and αv were expressed on osteoblasts. A histogram implied that the vast majority of osteoblasts expressed β1. We therefore assumed that β1 integrin, which is consistently highly expressed on osteoblasts, might play a functional role in primary osteoblasts. ICAM-1 and RANKL were moderately expressed on osteoblasts. Estimation from histograms of multiple donors showed that one-third to two-thirds of osteoblasts expressed ICAM-1 and RANKL without stimulation. Cross-linking of β 1 Integrin Up-regulated ICAM-1 and RANKL Expression on Osteoblasts—To characterize the function of β1 integrin on osteoblasts, we assayed the cell surface molecule expression by β1 cross-linking using a specific mAb and a second cross-linker Ab. Flow cytometry showed that expression of ICAM-1 and RANKL on the surface was markedly augmented by the β1 cross-linking on osteoblasts. As shown in Fig. 2, ICAM-1 and RANKL were moderately expressed on unstimulated osteoblasts. However, β1 cross-linking significantly up-regulated ICAM-1 and RANKL expression, whereas cross-linking of major histocompatibility complex class I using their specific mAbs and second cross-linker Ab had no effect. In contrast, cross-linking of β1 integrin on osteoblasts did not induce VCAM-1 expression (Fig. 2). The results were consistent in osteoblasts derived from four donors. Time course experiments showed that ICAM-1 and RANKL expression reached maximum levels within 3 h after β1 cross-linking (Fig. 2). These results suggest that β1 integrin appears to play a pivotal role in ICAM-1 and RANKL up-regulation on osteoblasts. Engagement of β 1 Integrin by Ligand Matrix Glycoproteins Augmented ICAM-1 and RANKL Expression on Osteoblasts— Fibronectin and type I collagen are major ligands for cell surface β1 integrin. We next assessed the biological activities of fibronectin and type I collagen on osteoblasts. Expression of both ICAM-1 and RANKL were markedly induced by incubation of these cells on fibronectinor collagen-coated plastic plates (Fig. 3). In contrast, no change was noted when these cells were incubated on bovine serum albumin-coated plates (Fig. 3). Furthermore ICAM-1 and RANKL expression induced by fibronectin and type I collagen was completely inhibited by pretreatment of cells with anti-β1 mAb (Fig. 3). These data suggest that fibronectin and type I collagen are possible ligands involved in β1 integrin-induced ICAM-1 and RANKL expression on osteoblasts. Involvement of Tyrosine Kinases in β 1 Integrin-mediated Up-regulation of ICAM-1 and RANKL on Osteoblasts—Next, to determine signaling pathways involved in β1 integrin-induced induction of ICAM-1 and RANKL expression on osteoblasts, we pretreated the cells with or without different concentrations of various inhibitors of intracytoplasmic signaling, and then ICAM-1 and RANKL expression by β1 cross-linking was determined by FACScan (Fig. 4). Pretreatment of cells with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors herbimycin A or genistein completely inhibited β1-induced up-regulation of ICAM-1 and RANKL expression on osteoblasts. In contrast, H7 or staurosporine (protein kinase C inhibitors) and wortmannin (a PI 3-K inhibitor) did not influence β1 integrin-induced ICAM-1 and RANKL expression. These results suggest that β1 integrin-induced ICAM-1 and RANKL expression on osteoblasts is mediated mainly through tyrosine kinases, consistent with previous reports from our laboratories and those of others (14Nakayamada S. Saito K. Fujii K. Yasuda M. Tamura M. Tanaka Y. Arthritis Rheum. 2003; 48: 1239-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 33Martin K.H. Slack J.K. Boerner S.A. Martin C.C. Parsons J.T.

Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar). Involvement of FAK in β 1-mediated Signaling Inducing ICAM-1 and RANKL on Osteoblasts—FAK is known to be an important mediator of the integrin-mediated signaling by adhering to ECM proteins (28Tamura M. Gu J. Matsumoto K. Aota S. Parsons R. Yamada K.M. Science. 1998; 280: 1614-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). ICAM-1 and RANKL expression was up-regulated by cross-linking of β1 integrins with a specific mAb on osteoblasts that did or did not express VSV-FAK, a wild-type FAK. However, on the cells expressing VSV-FAT or VSV-FRNK (a dominant negative truncation of FAK), such induction of ICAM-1 and RANKL by stimulation of β1 was completely reduced to the expression seen on the unstimulated cells (Fig. 5). These results indicate that FAK is involved in signaling via β1 stimulation, which leads to up-regulation of ICAM-1 and RANKL expression on osteoblasts. β 1-mediated Signaling Increased TRAP + MNC Formation in Osteoblasts from Peripheral Monocytes—In a coculture system using osteoblasts with peripheral monocytes, β1-stimulated osteoblasts that did or did not express VSV-FAK significantly induced the formation of TRAP+ MNCs from the monocytes compared with untreated osteoblasts. However, on the cells expressing VSV-FAT or VSV-FRNK, such induction of TRAP+ MNCs by stimulation of β1 was markedly inhibited (Fig. 6). These results also indicate that FAK is involved in β1 stimulation, and this helps commit hematopoietic precursors toward osteoclast development. Integrins are a superfamily of cell surface receptors involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion. Signals from matrices transduced by integrins play critical roles in regulating gene expression, tissue-specific differentiation, and survival of primary osteoblasts and fibroblasts (6Rodan G.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 31: 55-61Crossref Google Scholar, 35Raisz L.G. Clin. Chem. 1999; 45: 1353-1358PubMed Google Scholar, 36Damsky C.H. Bone (N. Y.). 1999; 25: 95-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). It has been reported that human osteoblasts express a diverse range of integrins, particularly of the β1 integrin, including α1 through α5 subunits. While our and others' studies show different patterns of integrin expression, this may reflect the heterogeneity of osteoblast-like populations and the different stages of osteoblasts from fetal or adult bone (37Clover J. Dodds R.A. Gowen M. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 267-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Hughes D.E. Salter D.M. Dedhar S. Simpson R. J. Bone Miner.

Alavi A.L. Beresford J.N. Walsh S. Arch. Oral Biol. 2001; 46: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although osteoblasts express αv integrins, they differ from osteoclasts in that β1 integrins appear to have the major functional role, which has been underscored by in vivo data (41Zimmerman D. Jin F. Leboy P. Hardy S. Damsky C. Dev. Biol. 2000; 220: 2-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). β1 integrins are major adhesion receptors mediating interactions between osteoblasts and ECMs found in bone, such as collagen, fibronectin, osteopontin, thrombospondin, and vitronectin. The α2β1 integrins bind to type I collagen, which is the dominant bone matrix protein, and several studies have reported that α2β1 integrin-mediated binding to ECM regulates osteoblastic differentiation (24Xiao G. Wang D. Benson M.D. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32988-32994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 25Takeuchi Y. Suzawa M. Kikuchi T. Nishida E. Fujita T. Matsumoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29309-29316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The α5β1 integrin, the selective fibronectin receptor, is important in both the development and maintenance of bone. Globus et al. (42Globus R.K. Doty S.B. Lull J.C. Holmuhamedov E. Humphries M.J. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1385-1393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that α5β1 ligand binding is necessary for cell survival and that receptor blockade leads to cell apoptosis in mature osteoblasts. Thus, the accumulating evidence indicates that β1 integrin-mediated adhesion to bone matrix induces proliferation, differentiation, and bone matrix synthesis of osteoblasts and that β1 integrin-mediated signaling on osteoblasts could be involved in bone formation. However, based on the results of the present study, we propose a new concept that stimulation of the adhesion molecule β1 integrin plays a pivotal role in the regulation of ICAM-1 and RANKL expression and osteoclastogenesis. We deduced this from the following novel findings. 1) Engagement of β1 integrins on purified human osteoblasts by cross-linking using a specific antibody as well as ligand matrices markedly augmented surface ICAM-1 and RANKL expression. 2) Up-regulation of both ICAM-1 and RANKL by β1 integrin stimulation was mediated by the tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, especially involving FAK. 3) Engagement of β1 integrins on osteoblasts induced TRAP-positive MNC formation in the coculture system of osteoblasts and peripheral monocytes. 4) Up-regulation of TRAP+ MNC formation by β1 stimulation was completely abrogated by transfection of dominant negative truncations of FAK. Therefore, we further propose that β1 integrin-dependent adhesion to bone matrix proteins in osteoblasts can transduce signaling to induce ICAM-1 and RANKL expression through tyrosine kinase involving FAK- and RANKL-induced osteoclast formation. As RANKL, a member of the tumor necrosis factor family expressed on the cell surface membrane of COS cells and osteoblasts/stromal cells, induces osteoclast formation from its precursor through cognate interaction between osteoblasts and osteoclast precursors, it is thereby required for RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis (9Anderson D.M. Maraskovsky E. Billingsley W.L. Dougall W.C. Tometsko M.E. Roux E.R. Teepe M.C. DuBose R.F. Cosman D. Galibert L. Nature. 1997; 390: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1960) Google Scholar, 10Wong B.R. Rho J. Arron J. Robinson E. Orlinick J. Chao M. Kalachikov S. Cayani E. Bartlett III, F.S. Frankel W.N. Lee S.Y. Choi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25190-25194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 11Yasuda H. Shima N. Nakagawa N. Yamaguchi K. Kinosaki M. Mochizuki S. Tomoyasu A. Yano K. Goto M.

Thus, higher affinity adhesion between osteoblasts and osteoclast precursors is emerging as a prerequisite for interaction of membrane-bound RANKL to be efficiently presented to its receptor, RANK. However, the binding affinity between tumor necrosis factor family molecules and tumor necrosis factor receptor family molecules, including CD40/CD40L, CD30/CD30L, Fas/FasL, and RANKL/RANK binding, is not sufficient to support static or firm cell adhesion (43Vassiliou G. Jakobsen K. Parish C.R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1998; 215: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Furthermore we reported that anti-RANKL antibody did not inhibit the adhesion of osteoblasts to osteoclast precursors, whereas anti-LFA-1 antibody completely blocked the adhesion in a human cell culture system (12Tanaka Y. Maruo A. Fujii K. Nomi M. Nakamura T. Eto S. Minami Y. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 1912-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, based on our in vitro study, it can be assumed that up-regulation of ICAM-1 and RANKL expression on osteoblasts by β1 integrin-mediated signaling could affect cellular adhesion between osteoblasts and osteoclast precursors through the ICAM-1/LFA-1 and RANKL/RANK pathways and lead to differentiation of osteoclast progenitors to osteoclasts in vivo. During bone remodeling processes, adhesion-dependent interaction among osteoblasts and osteoclasts causes an imbalance in bone metabolism by favoring bone resorption through the expression of RANKL, ICAM-1, and other factors involved in cellular interaction. Although several studies have reported that β1 integrin-mediated adhesion to bone matrix induces proliferation, differentiation, and bone matrix synthesis of osteoblasts, our novel findings suggest that β1 integrin/FAK-mediated signaling on osteoblasts could be involved in ICAM-1- and RANKL-dependent osteoclast maturation. Thus, it can be assumed that β1 integrin-mediated signaling on osteoblasts could be involved in high turnover on bone metabolism through two paradoxical features of bone formation and bone resorption. However, it is as yet unclear how the same signaling pathway controls such diverse cellular events. After ligation of β1 integrins with surrounding ECMs, the integrins are found in focal adhesion plaques where various cytoskeletal proteins accumulate. Engagement of β1 integrins leads to initiation of intracellular signal transduction through accumulated cytoskeletal signaling kinases, resulting in the activation, differentiation, development, and mobility of various cell types (15Brakebusch C. Bouvard D. Stanchi F. Sakai T. Fassler R. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 999-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 16Schwartz M.A. Trends. Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 466-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Several studies have established that among various cytoskeletal proteins, FAK, a cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinase that localizes focal adhesions, is an important mediator of integrin-mediated signaling and that the initial events triggered by the stimulation of β1 integrin are tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of FAK. In the present study, we observed that β1 integrin-mediated induction of ICAM-1 and RANKL expression was completely inhibited when the cells were pretreated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Furthermore β1 integrin-induced up-regulation of ICAM-1 and RANKL on osteoblasts expressing FRNK or FAT (dominant negative truncations of FAK) was completely inhibited. These findings suggest that β1 integrin-induced up-regulation of both ICAM-1 and RANKL expression was brought about by the signaling pathway of tyrosine kinases, specifically involving FAK. Phosphorylated FAK activates several transduction molecules including Src and Grb2, which may cause the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase or PI 3-K via Ras (22Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that small guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G-proteins) control signaling pathways critical for diverse cellular functions. Among several small G-proteins, Ras proteins are molecular switches that act as a “hub,” which radiates multiple signaling pathways critical for diverse cellular functions, including Raf-1/mitogen-activated protein kinase and PI 3-K (30Tanaka Y. Minami Y. Mine S. Hirano H. Fujimoto H. Fujii K. Saito K. Tsukada J. van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Kataoka T. Eto S. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6209-6216PubMed Google Scholar, 44Liu Z.J. Tanaka Y. Fujimoto H.

Kosugi A. Morinobu A. Umehara H. Yamamura H. Minami Y. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We have reported the relevance of H-Ras and its downstream effectors to functions of osteoblasts and proposed that H-Ras signals, especially those followed by the Raf-1/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, but not PI 3-K, induce cell cycle arrest and subsequent apoptosis via Fas up-regulation and Bcl-2 down-regulation (46Tanaka Y.

Although further evidence is required, there is a possibility that such diverse cellular regulation by the β1 integrin-bone matrix interaction may be mediated by these G-protein signaling cascades and that FAK is the immediate transducer of β1 integrin-mediated signaling. In conclusion, our results suggest a novel mechanism of β1 integrin-bone matrix cross-talk and a pivotal role in osteoclastogenesis. Further studies will be required to understand β1 integrin function in bone metabolism. We thank T. Adachi for the excellent technical assistance. We also thank Drs. K. M. Yamada, W. Newman, and S.

Metabolite concentrations, as quantified in vivo using water as an internal reference and in vitro in extracts, were correlated with cell density. The results showed that both in vivo and in vitro glycine and creatine concentrations followed volume-averaged cell density, whereas that of total choline-containing compounds was unaffected by a cell loss approaching 60%. Meanwhile, both saturated and unsaturated 1H NMR visible lipids increased. HRMAS 1H NMR spectroscopy of the tumor samples at 14.1 tesla demonstrated the presence of nucleotide peaks from adenosine and uridine nucleotides in glioma samples ex vivo. The assignment of a doublet at 7.95 ppm to UDP was confirmed by spiking experiments of tumor extracts in conjunction with 1H and 31P NMR spectroscopy. HRMAS also resolved the choline-containing peak at 3.2 ppm in vivo into resonances from choline (3.20 ppm), phosphocholine (3.22 ppm), glycerophosphocholine (3.24 ppm), and taurine (3.26 ppm). These resonances were uncorrelated with temporal progression through programmed cell death. Our results show that 1H NMR-detected lipids and some of the small molecular weight metabolites respond to gene therapy. However, the choline-containing compounds are unaffected by severe decline in cell density. The latter observation supports the idea that triacylglycerols, rather than membrane phospholipids, are the key components of 1H NMR visible lipids, and it also casts doubt on the validity of resonance of choline-containing compounds as a diagnostic marker of programmed cell death in vivo.

The assignment of a doublet at 7.95 ppm to UDP was confirmed by spiking experiments of tumor extracts in conjunction with 1H and 31P NMR spectroscopy. HRMAS also resolved the choline-containing peak at 3.2 ppm in vivo into resonances from choline (3.20 ppm), phosphocholine (3.22 ppm), glycerophosphocholine (3.24 ppm), and taurine (3.26 ppm). These resonances were uncorrelated with temporal progression through programmed cell death. Our results show that 1H NMR-detected lipids and some of the small molecular weight metabolites respond to gene therapy. However, the choline-containing compounds are unaffected by severe decline in cell density. The latter observation supports the idea that triacylglycerols, rather than membrane phospholipids, are the key components of 1H NMR visible lipids, and it also casts doubt on the validity of resonance of choline-containing compounds as a diagnostic marker of programmed cell death in vivo.

Recent evidence from cell culture studies points to a number of characteristic metabolic perturbations appearing in the early phase of PCD. These include affections of intermediary metabolism, such as accumulation of glycolytic intermediates fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, dihydroxy acetone phosphate, and glycerol-3-phosphate because of inhibition of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (4Ronen S.M. DiStefano F. McCoy C.L. Robertson D. Smith T.A. AlSaffar N.M. Titley J. Cunningham D.C. Griffiths J.R. Leach M.O. Clarke P.A. Br. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 19686-19692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and collapse of NAD(H) levels (5Williams S.N. Anthony M.L. Brindle K.M. Magn. Reson. Med. 1998; 40: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The severe decline in NAD(H), leading to inhibition of glycolysis, may result from activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in apoptotic cells (5Williams S.N. Anthony M.L. Brindle K.M. Magn. Reson. Med. 1998; 40: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Inhibition of CDP-choline:1,2-diacylglycerol choline phospotransferase leads to cessation of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis (6Anthony M.L. Zhao M. Brindle K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19686-19692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and it has been proposed that this might be one of the mechanisms explaining accumulation of 1H NMR lipids into cells undergoing apoptosis (7Blankenberg F.G. Storrs R.W. Naumovski L. Goralski T. Spielman D. Blood. 1996; 87: 1951-1956Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Al-Saffar M.M.S. Titley J.C. Robertson D. Clarke P.A. Jackson L.E. Leach M.O. Ronen S.M. Br. J. Cancer. 2001; 86: 963-970Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Interestingly, evidence has been put forward to suggest that inhibition of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis per se might induce PCD (9Miquel K. Pradines A. Terce F. Selmi S. Favre G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26179-26186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cell studies have indicated altered phospholipid metabolism (10Bhakoo K.K. Bell J.D. Cell Mol. Biol. (Noisy-Le-Grand). 1997; 43: 621-629PubMed Google Scholar) and intracellular acidification in the early phase of PCD (5Williams S.N. Anthony M.L. Brindle K.M. Magn. Reson. Med. 1998; 40: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Both in cell cultures in vitro (7Blankenberg F.G. Storrs R.W. Naumovski L. Goralski T. Spielman D.

Cancer. 2001; 86: 963-970Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and tumors in vivo (11Hakumäki J.M. Poptani H. Sandmair A.-M. Ylä-Herttuala S. Kauppinen R.A. Nat.

Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3195-3201PubMed Google Scholar), PCD has been shown to lead to accumulation of 1H NMR visible lipids. However, very little is known about the behavior of low molecular weight metabolites in vivo during ongoing PCD. Because a number of chemotherapeutic drugs are known to kill cancer cells by inducing apoptosis (2Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6179) Google Scholar), information on low molecular weight markers of PCD would be crucial for the assessment of treatment responses in a clinical setting by 1H NMR spectroscopy (13Nelson S.J. Vigneron D.B. Dillon W.P. NMR Biomed. 1999; 12: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have monitored the non-lipid metabolite levels in rat BT4C gliomas during gene therapy-induced PCD in vivo in a quantitative manner as well as determined the metabolite concentrations in acid extracts of the tumor samples. Ex vivo high resolution magic angle spinning (HRMAS) 1H NMR spectroscopy was also used to further examine the metabolite patterns in the glioma tissue. This combined NMR spectroscopic approach indicates dissimilarities in behaviors of metabolites during PCD. Animals—BT4C gliomas transfected with viral HSV-tk gene were induced by implanting 104 HSV-tk+ cells in 5 μl of Opti-MEM to a depth of 2.5 mm into the corpus callosum of female BDIX rats weighing 180-250 g, as described previously (14Poptani H. Puumalainen A.-M. Gröhn O.H.J. Loimas S. Kainulainen R. Ylä-Herttuala S. Kauppinen R.A. Cancer Gene Ther. 1998; 5: 101-109PubMed Google Scholar). Rats in the treatment group were injected with GCV (25 mg/kg, intraperitoneal, twice daily) for the duration of the study. Brains were funnel-frozen in situ as described by Ponten et al. (15Pontén U. Ratcheson R.A. Salford L.G. Siesjö B.K. J. Neurochem. 1973; 21: 1127-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The brains were sectioned frozen, and tumor tissue was dissected on dry ice for ex vivo 1H NMR spectroscopy or for extraction of acid-soluble metabolites with standard perchloric acid procedure. All animal experiments were performed according to the guidelines approved by the Ethical Committee of the National Laboratory Animal Center (Kuopio, Finland). NMR—For MRI, rats (n = 15; 3 control rats and 12 treated animals) were anesthetized with 0.8-1.0% halothane in N2O/O2 (7:3), and the core temperature of animals was monitored and maintained close to 37 °C using a heated water blanket. MRI was performed in a horizontal 4.7-T magnet (Magnex Scientific Ltd, Abington, UK), equipped with actively shielded field gradients (Magnex Scientific) interfaced to a Varian UNITY INOVA console (Varian, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). A quadrature surface coil (Highfield Imaging, Minneapolis, MN) was used in transmit/receive mode. Rats were fixed into a custom-built head holder using a mouth bar and ear pins, and tilted to an angle corresponding to a stereotactic rat brain atlas (16Paxinos G.T. Watson C. The Rat Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates. Academic Press, London1996Google Scholar). Total imaging time for each animal was typically 80-90 min. Tumor volumes were determined from T2-weighted multi-slice spinecho images (pulse repetition time (TR), 2.5 s; echo time (TE), 90 ms; field of view, 35 mm; matrix size, 256 × 128, 2 scans/line and contiguous slices of 1-mm thickness) (14Poptani H. Puumalainen A.-M. Gröhn O.H.J. Loimas S. Kainulainen R. Ylä-Herttuala S. Kauppinen R.A. Cancer Gene Ther. 1998; 5: 101-109PubMed Google Scholar). Absolute diffusion coefficient images were obtained using a spin-echo sequence (TR, 1.5 s; TE, 55 ms; matrix size, 128 × 64; slice thickness, 1.5 mm; and an adiabatic BIR-4 refocusing pulse (17Garwood M. Ke Y. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 94: 511-525Google Scholar)) with four bipolar gradient pairs in each direction. This achieves weighting by the trace of the diffusion tensor (D av = [1-3]TraceD̄) in a single acquisition (18Mori S. van Zijl P.C.M. Magn. Reson. Med. 1995; 33: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Data from three acquisitions with different diffusion weighting, possessing b-values between 70 and 1420 s/mm2, were used to calculate the absolute D av images. A stimulated echo acquisition mode (STEAM) pulse sequence (TR, 3 s; middle period delay, 30 ms; TE, 2 ms; sweep width (SW), 2.5 kHz; 2000 data points) incorporating an outer volume saturation, a variable pulse power and optimized relaxation delay (VAPOR) water suppression scheme, and asymmetric excitation pulses (19Tkac I. Starcuk Z. Choi I.Y. Gruetter R. Magn. Reson. Med. 1999; 41: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar) was used for quantification of tumor metabolites in vivo. A voxel was placed within the solid tumor according to the multi-slice T2-weighted localizer image, and the magnetic field within the voxel was optimized by shimming using the FASTMAP routine (20Gruetter R. Magn. Reson. Med. 1993; 29: 804-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). In some animals, 1H NMR spectra were also acquired from the same voxel using the localization by adiabatic selective refocusing (LASER) method as described previously (21Garwood M. DelaBarre L. J. Magn. Reson. 2001; 153: 155-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar) (TR, 8.8 s; TE, 32 ms; SW, 2.5 kHz; 13,000 data points). Metabolite concentrations were quantified from STEAM spectra using non-suppressed water peak as a reference (0.787 kg/kg of fresh untreated BT4C tumor tissue) (22Hakumaki J.M. Grohn O.H. Tyynela K. Valonen P. Yla-Herttuala S. Kauppinen R.A. Cancer Gene Ther. 2002; 9: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), corrected for T1 saturation effects because of water accumulation during PCD, using the T1 values recently reported (22Hakumaki J.M. Grohn O.H. Tyynela K. Valonen P. Yla-Herttuala S. Kauppinen R.A. Cancer Gene Ther. 2002; 9: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For ex vivo 1H NMR spectroscopy, samples of tumor tissue (5-10 mg in wet weight) were placed into the zirconium oxide MAS rotor alongside 10 μl of D2O (deuterium lock reference) containing 10 mm trimethylsilyl propionic acid (chemical shift reference). HRMAS 1H NMR spectra were acquired using a Bruker 600 MHz Avance spectrometer interfaced with a high resolution MAS probe (Bruker GmBH, Rheinestennen, Germany) at +4 °C using a conventional solvent suppressed pulse/acquire sequence based on the nuclear Overhauser spectroscopy pulse sequence to suppress baseline artifacts resulting from B0 and B1 field inhomogeneities (relaxation delay - π/2 - t 1 - π/2 - t m - π/2 TR, 2 s; SW, 10 kHz; 32,000 data points, solvent suppression applied during the preparation time (t 1) of 4 μs and mixing time (t m) of 150 ms; 5 kHz spinning rate). Spectra were also acquired with a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) pulse sequence using a TE of 40 ms (spin echo delay, 500 μs; total number of spin echoes, 40; other parameters identical to those described for the nuclear Overhauser spectroscopy presaturation pulse sequence). Neutralized perchloric acid extracts were freeze-dried and samples dissolved in D2O containing 20 μm trimethylsilyl propionic acid for chemical shift and concentration reference. High resolution pulse-acquired 1H NMR spectra using presaturation solvent suppression during relaxation delay (TR, 12.7 s; SW, 6 kHz, 16,000 data points) were collected at 500 MHz using a Bruker Avance spectrometer at 20 °C. The same instrument was used to acquire proton-decoupled 31P NMR spectra (TR, 2.4 s; SW, 40 kHz; 16,000 data points). To assign peaks tentatively identified as “nucleotides” in the 1H and 31P NMR spectra, some extracts were spiked with UDP, CDP, and their derivatives. In vivo spectra were analyzed in the time domain using jMRUI software (web site: carbon.uab.es/mrui), in vitro extract spectra with PERCH software (www.perchsolutions.com), and the ex vivo spectra in the frequency domain using XWINNMR (Bruker GmBH). For metabolite quantification in vitro, the following chemical groups were used: a CH at 3.74 ppm for glutamate; a CH at 3.75 ppm for glutamine; a CH at 3.61 for myo-inositol; a CH2 at 3.55 for glycine; a CH3 at 3.42 for taurine; a N(CH3)3 at 3.23, 3.21, and 3.20 ppm for glycerophosphocholine, phosphocholine, and free choline, respectively; a CH3 at 3.03 ppm for creatine + phosphocreatine; and a CH3 at 1.47 ppm for alanine. Student's unpaired t test was used for statistical analysis of results. Linear regression analysis was used to estimate the significance of correlation between cell density and metabolite concentrations both in vivo and in vitro. Principal Component Analysis of ex Vivo Data—To investigate the non-lipid metabolite changes that accompanied PCD in the tumors, high resolution MAS 1H NMR CPMG spectra (TE, 40 ms) were investigated using PCA. Spectra were converted into a data-reduced numeric format using automated integration across 0.04-ppm regions between 0.2 and 4.2 ppm as described previously (23Beckwith-Hall B.M. Nicholson J.K. Nicholls A.W. Foxall P.J. Lindon J.C. Connor S.C. Abdi M. Connelley J. Holems E. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1998; 11: 260-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). After global normalization, in which each integral region was represented as a ratio to the total integral across the 0.2-4.2-ppm region and mean centering of the each variable, the resultant data set was investigated using the PCA approach (SIMCA software; Umetrics, Umea, Sweden). The principal component representations of variation across the data set were then investigated in terms of clusterings relating to tissue type and progression through PCD. This process was also repeated for in vivo and in vitro 1H NMR spectra. Histology—A satellite group of rats (n = 14; 2 control rats and 12 treated animals) were sacrificed by CO2 and transcardially perfused with phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min (30 ml/min) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 12 min (30 ml/min). The fixed brains were removed from the skull, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, and embedded in OCT medium (Bayer Corp., Emeryville, CA) for cryosectioning. Nissl staining was used to reveal the extent of cell damage in the sections (20-μm slices; 1:15 sections counted) as well as for quantitative cell counting as described previously (24Gröhn O.H. Lukkarinen J.A. Silvennoinen M.J. Pitkänen A. van Zijl P.C. Kauppinen R.A. Magn. Reson. Med. 1999; 42: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The adjoining sections were stained for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (ApopTag Plus; Oncor, Gaithersburg, MD) to reveal apoptotic nuclei, using a methyl green counterstain. Apoptotic nuclei were counted in tumor tissue from arbitrarily chosen high power fields (×20; AX-70 microscope; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Typical absolute diffusion images through the center of tumor are shown from untreated and treated rats (Fig. 1, A and B). It was evident that D av had increased by day 4 of GCV treatment in the center of tumor mass, and this was followed by a decline in the tumor volume commencing between days 4 and 6 (not shown). Histological sections showed substantial cell loss and scar formation (Fig. 1, compare C and D) starting from the center of the tumor volume, consistent with the patterns of D av changes. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nickend labeling staining revealed substantial increase (>4-fold) in apoptotic nuclei by day 4. The average cell density was 178 ± 10 × 103 cells/mm3 in non-treated tumors. The cell density was 183 ± 13, 154 ± 14, 109 ± 4, and 71 ± 2 × 103 cell/mm3 in days 2, 4, 6, and 8 of treated tumors, respectively; day 6 and 8 values were significantly less than that at day 0 (p < 0.01). These observations confirmed that gene therapy had induced PCD (14Poptani H. Puumalainen A.-M. Gröhn O.H.J. Loimas S. Kainulainen R. Ylä-Herttuala S. Kauppinen R.A. Cancer Gene Ther. 1998; 5: 101-109PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hakumaki J.M. Grohn O.H. Tyynela K. Valonen P. Yla-Herttuala S. Kauppinen R.A. Cancer Gene Ther. 2002; 9: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), resulting in severe cell loss in the gliomas. Water-suppressed 1H NMR spectra from BT4C in vivo are dominated by strong lipid signals arising from a -CH2 CH2 CH2- of saturated lipids at 1.3 ppm and a -CH2 CH3 of saturated lipids at 0.9 ppm, but peaks from -CH=CH- of polyunsaturated fatty acids at 5.4 ppm, CH=CHCH 2CH=CH of PUFAs at 2.8 ppm, and CH 2CH=CH of lipids at 2.0 ppm are also discernible (Fig. 2). STEAM 1H NMR spectrum from a tumor in vivo before GCV-treatment revealed well resolved peaks from phosphocreatine + creatine at 3.92 ppm, glutamate + glutamine (Glx) at 3.76 ppm, myo-inositol + glycine at 3.6 ppm, taurine at 3.43 ppm, choline-containing compounds (CHO) with a contribution from taurine at 3.23 ppm, and phosphocreatine + creatine at 3.03 (Fig. 2, A and B). All these peaks were also visible in LASER spectra (Fig. 2, C and D). Short TE STEAM 1H NMR spectroscopy was used to quantify metabolites in absolute terms, and the LASER method was used to qualitatively confirm the peak assignments from spectra with slight T2 filter, yet with a higher signal-to-noise ratio compared with the STEAM sequence at similar TE. It should be noted that in the downfield part of the spectra beyond 6 ppm, no resolvable resonances were seen in vivo even after summing several proton spectra from different tumors to improve signal-to-noise ratio (not shown). The inserts of both STEAM and LASER spectra show the qualitative time-dependent changes in the metabolite peaks upon GCV treatment (Fig. 2, B and D). The absolute metabolite concentrations from STEAM spectra are plotted against cell density (Fig. 3). Although the concentrations of myo-inositol + glycine, taurine, and creatine showed a significant negative slope (Fig. 3, A and B) along with cell count in tumors undergoing PCD, that of CHO remained zero (Fig. 3C). A decreasing trend in the slope of Glx was also evident but was not significant (Fig. 3B). At the same time, both unsaturated (indicated by CH=CH at 5.4 ppm) and saturated (from CH2CH2 CH2 at 1.3 ppm) lipids by 1H NMR indicated positive slope in the tissue with reducing cell density (Fig. 3D), as previously reported after GCV treatment of BT4C glioma (11Hakumäki J.M.

Kettunen M.I. Yla-Herttuala S. Pitkanen A. Nicholson J.K. Kauppinen R.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3195-3201PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted that the peak at 1.3 ppm may have contributions from lactate, but even during high-resolution MAS spectroscopy, the contribution from lactate was found to be small (data not shown).Fig. 3Absolute metabolite concentrations plotted against cell density in BT4C gliomas. Absolute metabolite concentrations (in micromoles per gram of tissue water) in vivo (A-D) were determined from STEAM spectra using endogenous water as an internal reference. Metabolite concentrations were also determined from acid-extracted tumor specimens in vitro by 1H NMR spectroscopy (E-G) as described under “Materials and Methods.” Cell densities were determined at corresponding treatment day from Nissl-stained sections as described under “Materials and Methods.” Linear regression analysis gave correlation coefficients and p values for in vivo peaks as follows: taurine, R2 = 0.78, p < 0.05; myo-inositol (mI) + Gly, R2 = 0.86, p < 0.03; creatine (Cr), R2 = 0.76, p < 0.05; Glx, R2 = 0.62, p < 0.12; CHO, R2 = 0.009, p < 0.9; 1.3 ppm, R2 = 0.94, p < 0.01; 5.4 ppm R2 = 0.91, p < 0.02. The respective correlation coefficients and p values for in vitro metabolites were as follows: taurine, R2 = 0.58, p < 0.24; myo-inositol, R2 = 0.83, p < 0.09; Gly, R2 = 0.89, p < 0.06; creatine, R2 = 0.83, p < 0.09; Glx, R2 = 0.13, p < 0.63; free choline (fCHO), R2 = 0.43, p < 0.34; phosphocholine (PC), R2 = 0.052, p < 0.77; glycerophosphocholine (GPC), R2 = 0.55, p < 0.25; Ala, R2 = 0.84, p < 0.09.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Metabolite concentrations in acid extracts of tumor specimens are plotted against cell count (Fig. 3, E-G). Typical 1H NMR spectra from untreated and treated tumor extracts are shown (Fig. 4, A-C). The in vitro results indicate a decreasing trend (p < 0.10) in concentrations of glycine, creatine, and alanine (Ala) accompanying reducing cell density (Fig. 3, E and F). However, taurine (Fig. 3E), Glx (Fig. 3E), and all choline-containing compounds (Fig. 3G) showed virtually zero slopes. Data in Fig. 3G indicate that the phosphocholine/glycerophosphocholine ratio increased during treatment from 0.31 ± 0.06 in untreated tumors to 0.64 ± 0.04 (p < 0.02) by day 6 of treatment. However, the respective values at days 4 and 8 of 0.60 ± 0.15 and 0.48 ± 0.07 were not different from those determined in the control tumors. The slope of myo-inositol showed a positive trend during PCD (Fig. 3E), which was unexpected against the in vivo observation (Fig. 3A). Ex vivo HRMAS 1H NMR spectra from normal parietal cortex and BT4C gliomas at different treatment days are shown in Fig. 5. Because of the excellent chemical shift resolution obtained with MAS at 14.1 T, one can assign individual signals from CHO, including choline, phosphocholine, and glycerophosphocholine, as well as taurine (Fig 5, A-C). No correlation was found between metabolite resonance intensities and day of treatment using multivariate regression techniques, indicating that changes in non-lipid metabolites did not reflect the progression of PCD (not shown). PCA of CPMG spectra separated tumor and control tissue across PCs 1 and 2 readily but did not identify a trend associated with PCD (Fig. 6A). Using the loading plots of the PCA model formed, the spectral regions most responsible for distinguishing tumor and normal tissue were identified. The spectra of tumors had increased relative resonance intensities from CH 3 lipid, CH 2CH=CH lipids, and myo-inositol. Further examination of loading plots demonstrated that normal brain cortex was characterized by resonances from lactate, N-acetyl aspartate, glutamate, and creatine (Fig. 6B). Repeating this analysis for spectra from extracts of tumors and in vivo spectra using the STEAM sequence, again the biggest discriminatory factor was the presence of NAA, creatine, and glutamate in control tissue. No metabolic trend associated with PCD was detected for non-lipid metabolites (not shown).Fig. 6Principal component analysis of HRMAS 1H NMR CPMG spectra of tumors and control tissue. The two multivariate correlations representing the most amount of correlated variation in the data set formed two principal components (PC) in the model, with the score of each spectrum indicating the magnitude of the variation explained by principal components 1 and 2. A plot of these PCA scores (A) readily separated tumor and control tissue. The metabolite regions that most influenced these principal components were identified from the loading plot (B) of the PCA model. Metabolites with relatively large positive or negative numbers in the loading plot influence the model more greatly than those found at the origin. The ellipse represents the chemical shift regions that made a small contribution to the separation detected in the PCA model. ▪, control tissue; ○, tumor tissue. 32 Δ 0.9, 0.98 CH3-lipid; Δ 1.34, lactate; Δ 2.02, N-acetyl aspartate; Δ 2.34, 2.38 glutamate; Δ 2.86, 2.90 CH2CH=CH; Δ 3.7, 3.98 myo-inositol; Δ 3.94, creatine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The downfield part of the HRMAS spectra revealed numerous peaks in tumors regardless of the treatment time that were not seen in the samples from normal brain. These peaks were more evident in CPMG spectra and were assigned to the nucleotides ATP and either UDP or CDP (Fig. 5, D-F). Peaks with same chemical shifts were also seen in the downfield part of acid-extracted tumors (Fig. 4, A and B). To determine whether the tumors contained uridine or cytosine metabolites, 31P NMR spectroscopy was performed on the aqueous tissue extracts of the tumors (Fig. 4, D and E), demonstrating the presence of ATP and UDP in the tumors. The assignment of the latter metabolite was confirmed by spiking experiments using both 1H and 31P NMR. The relative ratio of UDP to ATP remained approximately constant during PCD at 0.58 ± 0.20 according to the 1H NMR resonances observed and 0.53 ± 0.10 from the 31P NMR spectra of the extracts. In the present study, we have used BT4C tumors undergoing ganciclovir-HSV-tk gene therapy as a model of PCD. This well documented model has characteristic metabolic changes associated with PCD, most notably a large increase in polyunsaturated fatty acids.

Crystal structures of iNOSoxy and nNOSoxy complexed with the inhibitors W1400 and N ω-propyl-l-arginine provide a rationale for their isoform specificity. It involves differences outside the immediate active site as well as a conformational flexibility in the active site that allows the adoption of distinct conformations in response to interactions with the inhibitors. This flexibility is determined by isoform-specific residues outside the active site.

Cooper C.E. Knowles R.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 593-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (3190) Google Scholar). In mammals, three NOS isoforms have been identified sharing 50–60% sequence identity, that differ in cellular distribution, regulation, and activity (1Alderton W.K. Cooper C.E. Knowles R.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 593-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (3190) Google Scholar). Endothelial NOS (eNOS) regulates vascular tone and smooth muscle tension. Neuronal NOS (nNOS) produced NO functions as a diffusible neurotransmitter, whereas NO generated by inducible NOS (iNOS) generates cytotoxins with both protective and pathologic effects. iNOS binds calmodulin irreversibly and is transcriptionally regulated in response to cytokines (2Knowles R.G. Merrett M. Salter M. Moncada S. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 833-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). In contrast, both constitutive isoforms (nNOS and eNOS) are regulated by intracellular Ca2+/CaM and generate trace amounts of NO as an intercellular messenger (3Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10769-10772Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). It activates soluble guanylate cyclase in target cells such as smooth muscle. Although this NO signal channel has received the most attention (4Schmidt H.H. Walter U. Cell. 1994; 78: 919-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar), NO affects many other sites in the cell. In line with the central biological role of NO, there are a number of pathological processes associated with its overproduction or underproduction. For example, nNOS is implicated in stroke and migraine and iNOS is implicated in septic shock, arthritis, and multiple sclerosis. The possibility of treating these and other conditions by inhibiting NOS has elicited intense efforts to identify or design NOS inhibitors (5Reif D.W. McCarthy D.J. Cregan E. Macdonald J.E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1470-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 6Babu B.R. Griffith O.W. Curr. Opin. Chem Biol. 1998; 2: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Because the three isoforms of NOS have unique roles in separate tissues, selective inhibition of one isozyme over the others is essential. In particular, it is important not to inhibit eNOS because of its critical role in maintaining vascular tone. Thus, there was great anticipation that the crystal structures of the oxygenase domains of iNOS and eNOS might guide the rational design of isoform specific inhibitors. Indeed, the high level of amino acid conservation and high structural similarity in the immediate vicinity of the substrate binding sites (7Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Gachhui R. Wu C. Ghosh D.K.

Our study implies that the immediate vicinity and periphery of the NOS active site contain isoform-specific regions or residues that may confer differential modes of inhibitor binding, which may be used for isoform specific inhibitor design.Table IData and refinement statisticsnNOS in complex withiNOS in complex withN ω-Propyl-L-argW1400N ω-Propyl-L-argW14001QW6dThese are Protein Data Bank codes1QWCdThese are Protein Data Bank codes1QW4dThese are Protein Data Bank codes1QW5dThese are Protein Data Bank codesCrystal parametersGroupC2221C2221P6122P6122Cell parameters:45.0, 108.9, 164.844.8, 108.8, 164.3214.6, 214.6, 117.4214.6, 214.6, 117.4a, b, c(Å); α, β, γ (°)90, 90, 9090, 90, 9090, 90, 12090, 90, 120Data collectionBeamlineID14—1, ESRFID14—2, ESRFID14—1, ESRFX13, EMBL/DESYDetectorADSC Q4ADSC Q4ADSC Q4MARCCDWavelength (Å)?0.9340.9330.9340.802Resolution of data (Å)2.12.32.32.7All/unique reflections160168/23389125740/17658350863/128211223915/42993Completeness (%)aCompleteness, R sym, and 〈I/σ(I)〉 are given for all of the data and for the highest resolution shell96.8/91.096.2/93.195.4/89.497.5/95.8〈I/σ(I)〉 (total/high)aCompleteness, R sym, and 〈I/σ(I)〉 are given for all of the data and for the highest resolution shell17.1/6.515.8/5.19.8/2.615.4/4.2R sym (total/high)(%)aCompleteness, R sym, and 〈I/σ(I)〉 are given for all of the data and for the highest resolution shell,bR sym = Σ|I— 〈I〉|/ΣI6.6/29.09.3/37.35.9/38.47.4/37.7Refinement statisticsResolution range (Å)8.0-2.18.0-2.38.0-2.48.0-2.7Included amino acids297-716297-7162 × (77—495)2 × (77—495)No. of waters280206353263R work/R free (%)cR work = Σ|F obs| — k| F calc|/Σ|F obs|. 5% of randomly chosen reflections were used for the calculation of R free19.5/24.319.3/23.521.3/25.121.1/26.4R.m.s.d. bonds (Å)/Angles (°)0.007/1.30.009/1.40.008/1.30.009/1.3a Completeness, R sym, and 〈I/σ(I)〉 are given for all of the data and for the highest resolution shellb R sym = Σ|I— 〈I〉|/ΣIc R work = Σ|F obs| — k| F calc|/Σ|F obs|. 5% of randomly chosen reflections were used for the calculation of R freed These are Protein Data Bank codes Open table in a new tab Protein Cloning, Purification, and Crystallization—The heme oxygenase domains of murine iNOS (residues 65–498) and rat nNOS (residues 291–722) 2D.

All of the materials were of the highest purity available and were obtained from Sigma, Fluka, and Alexis. iNOSoxy and nNOSoxy crystals were grown in the dark at 4 and 20 °C, respectively, by vapor diffusion using the hanging drop geometry. For iNOSoxy, 1 μl of protein (15 mg/ml in 40 mm Na+-EPPS, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 4 μm H4B, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm β-octyl-glycoside, and 1–10 mm of inhibitor) and reservoir solutions were mixed, the latter contained 100 mm Na+-MES buffer, pH 6.5, and 0.7 m Na2+-malonate (22Fedorov R.

Diffraction Data Collection and Refinement—Diffraction data were collected at DESY and the ESRF using MAR and ADSC-Q4 CCD detectors (see Table II for details) and reduced with the XDS program package (23Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3200) Google Scholar). Structure determination was initiated by a round of rigid body refinement using the protein part of the iNOSoxy. l-Arg coordinates (Protein Data Bank code 1NOD) as an initial model. Refinement was continued with CNS (24Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T.

During cyclic rounds of refinement and manual rebuilding zinc ions, solvent molecules, and ligands were included in the models. The final models display good stereochemistry (Table I). Structures were overlaid with the program SAP (25Taylor W.R. Orengo C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) and adjusted manually by superpositioning the hemes.

Fast W. Marletta M.A. Martasek P. Silverman R.B. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 3869-3870Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and is highly selective for nNOS (Table II). The complexes with the oxygenase domains of murine iNOS and rat nNOS were obtained by co-crystallization. There is good electron density for all of the parts of NPA bound to nNOSoxy (Fig. 1A) and iNOSoxy (Fig. 1B), respectively. As predicted previously (27Babu B.R. Frey C. Griffith O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25218-25226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), NPA binds similarly to the substrate l-Arg (11Li H. Shimizu H. Flinspach M. Jamal J. Yang W. Xian M. Cai T. Wen E.Z. Jia Q. Wang P.G. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13868-13875Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and forms a number of slightly different interactions with the oxygenase domains that are listed in Table II and shown in Fig. 2, A and B. There is one qualitatively different interaction in the nNOSoxy complex (N ϵ2-Gln-478–NPA-O1, 3.0 Å) that originates ultimately from Asn-498 located in the substrate access channel (Fig. 2A). iNOS has a threonine (Thr-277) at this position that is too short to interact with the guanidinium group of the adjacent Arg-260. Thus, its side chain orients itself to interact with Gln-257 (N ϵ-Arg-260–Oϵ1-Gln-257, 2.7 Å), which therefore cannot interact with O1 of the NPA carboxylate. In nNOSoxy, Asn-498 forms a hydrogen bond with Arg-481 (Oδ1-Asn-498–N η1-Arg-481, 3.2 Å), resulting in an orientation of the guanidinium group that is perpendicular to the one of Arg-260 in iNOSoxy (Fig. 2A). Therefore, the interaction with Gln-478 is not possible and Gln-478 is free to interact with the carboxylate of NPA or the substrate l-Arg (11Li H. Shimizu H. Flinspach M. Jamal J. Yang W. Xian M. Cai T. Wen E.Z. Jia Q. Wang P.G. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13868-13875Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). 4R. Fedorov, E. Hartmann, D. K. Ghosh, and I. Schlichting, unpublished data. The additional H-bond between rat nNOS and NPA compared with murine iNOS may contribute to the selectivity of NPA against murine iNOS, consistent with the structure-activity-relationships (SAR) described for bovine nNOS (assuming that bovine nNOS has an asparagine at the position corresponding to rat nNOS Asn-498 as all of the known nNOS sequences from mammalians do) and murine iNOS (Table II). However, the co-structures with NPA reported here suggest that the compound may not be as selective against human iNOS. The human isozymes have an asparagine at the position corresponding to rat nNOS Asn-498 and murine Thr-277 (human eNOS Asn-266, iNOS Asn-283, and nNOS Asn-502). Therefore, all of the human isozymes may potentially form a hydrogen bond between the residue homologous to nNOS Gln-478 and the O1 atom of NPA. Indeed, the K d values for NPA determined by competition analysis with imidazole are 0.6, 23.5, and 49.0 μm for rat nNOS and human and murine iNOS, respectively. 3D. K. Ghosh, personal communication. Thus, additional factors contribute to isoform specificity such as the size of the ligand binding cavity. More structural and biochemical analysis including ligand binding affinity coupled with enzyme inhibition studies using the human isozymes is needed to assess the selectivity of NPA for nNOS against human iNOS. The propyl chain of NPA points into the heme cavity and lines up at its “back wall” made up of β-strand S15 (Fig. 2B). The active sites differ significantly in the iNOSoxy, nNOSoxy, and eNOSoxy complexes with the active site of the iNOSoxy complex being smaller by 13 Å3 compared with nNOSoxy and 8.4 Å3 compared with eNOS, which is reflected by the distance of 1.1 Å between the Cα atoms of the homologous residues Gly-365 (murine iNOS) and Gly-586 (rat nNOS) (Fig. 2, C–E). This is caused by the presence of an asparagine residue (Asn-364) interacting with the backbone carbonyl oxygen atom of Ala-237 (3.1 Å) located in the adjacent β-strand S4 (10Fischmann T.O. Hruza A. Niu X.D. Fossetta J.D. Lunn C.A. Dolphin E. Prongay A.J. Reichert P. Lundell D.J. Narula S.K. Weber P.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) and thereby acting as a “spacer” (Fig. 2B). nNOSoxy and eNOSoxy have a serine at this position (Ser-585/356, respectively) that forms in eNOSoxy a hydrogen bond with the N ϵ2 imidazole nitrogen atom of His-216 located in helix H7 (10Fischmann T.O. Hruza A. Niu X.D. Fossetta J.D. Lunn C.A. Dolphin E. Prongay A.J. Reichert P. Lundell D.J. Narula S.K. Weber P.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Thus, the structures suggest that discrimination of iNOSoxy against inhibitors with large or inflexible groups at the position corresponding to N ω is because of the asparagine residue. In addition, in nNOSoxy, there is a hydrogen bond between the unsubstituted terminal nitrogen (N3) of NPA and the Trp-587 carbonyl oxygen atom (Table II). Because there is no structure of a NPA complex of eNOSoxy, we compared the structures of the l-Arg complexes of the three isoforms to obtain insight into the active site geometries. In complex with l-Arg, the eNOSoxy active site is larger than the one of iNOSoxy (by 8.4 Å3) but smaller than the one of nNOSoxy (by 4.6 Å3) (Fig. 2, C–E). This is a likely reason for relatively similar binding affinity of eNOSoxy and nNOSoxy for inhibitors with a group extending from the N ω position. The sequence differences leading to the differences in the cavity volume (Asn-364/Ser-585/Ser-355 in murine iNOSoxy/rat nNOSoxy/bovine eNOSoxy) are also found in human isozymes (Asn-370/Ser-590/Ser-353 in iNOSoxy/nNOSoxy/eNOSoxy). Furthermore, the three-dimensional structures around this part of β-strand S15 of human iNOSoxy (Protein Data Bank code 4NOS) and eNOS (Protein Data Bank code 3NOS) align nicely over murine iNOSoxy and rat nNOSoxy, respectively, after superposition of the dimers (Fig. 2F and Table III). Hence, these structural differences may be relevant to drug design.Table IIIAverage root mean square coordinate differences between the main-chain atoms of the β-strand S15 in NOS isoforms from different organismsiNOSoxy murineiNOSoxy humaneNOSoxy bovineeNOSoxy humaniNOSoxy murine0.00.20.80.8iNOSoxy human0.00.90.9eNOSoxy bovine0.00.3eNOSoxy human0.0 Open table in a new tab To summarize, the co-structures with NPA presented here provide an important guideline for rational design of nNOS inhibitors specific against iNOS. However, the critically important issue of avoiding eNOS inhibition requires further investigation to fully understand the SAR. Structures of the W1400 Complexes—W1400 belongs to the class of carbamidine-containing NOS inhibitors and is highly selective for iNOS (Table II). The complexes with the oxygenase domains of murine iNOS and rat nNOS were obtained by co-crystallization. There are two crystallographically independent molecules in the asymmetric unit of the iNOSoxy crystals that have slightly different conformations in the W1400 complexes (Figs. 1 and 3). There is strong electron density for all parts of the inhibitor in the iNOSxoy and nNOSoxy structures (Fig. 1B). The benzyl ring of W1400 is positioned atop the heme pyrrole A, and the 3-aminomethyl group of W1400 interacts with both propionic acid groups of the heme. The latter group is held in place by interactions with the hydroxyl groups of Tyr-485/706 (iNOSoxy/nNOSoxy) and the cofactor H4B, respectively. The absence of H4B in the structure of the eNOS W1400 complex (17Li H. Raman C.S. Martasek P. Masters B.S. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5399-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) might be the reason why there is only some residual electron density for the 3-aminomethyl group (17Li H. Raman C.S.

Based on the available data, it is not possible to decide whether the missing interaction between the 3-aminomethyl group and the heme propionate groups in eNOS is caused by the absence of H4B or whether it is characteristic for this complex, explaining the low inhibition constant of W1400 for eNOS (Table II). The W1400 amidine group mimics the guanidinium group of the substrate l-arginine and forms hydrogen bonds with the carboxylate oxygen atoms of the catalytic Glu-371/592 in iNOSoxy/nNOSoxy, respectively, as listed in Table II. What is not apparent from this table is the conformational flexibility of the active site of iNOSoxy revealed by the slightly different binding modes of W1400 to the two iNOSoxy molecules present in the asymmetric unit of the unit cell and, more importantly, when comparing iNOSoxy with nNOSoxy. In order for all three nitrogens of W1400 to interact strongly with the carboxylate oxygens of the heme and Glu-371, W1400 moves toward the propionates and Glu-371 follows (Cα-distance 0.8/0.6 Å compared with the l-Arg complex in molecule 1/2, respectively), causing a shift of helix H11 (Fig. 3). In nNOSoxy this shift is not possible due to Tyr598 (instead of Phe377/Leu369 in iNOSoxy/eNOSoxy) in H11 that forms a hydrogen bond (3.2 Å) with the carbonyl of Lys5–60, thereby fixing the helix position. The movement of W1400 in iNOSoxy results in different positions of the C1 methyl group relative to the heme (Table II), which are likely to be of mechanistic relevance. W1400 is a mechanism-based inhibitor of NOS (12Garvey E.P. Oplinger J.A. Furfine E.S. Kiff R.J. Laszlo F. Whittle B.J. Knowles R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4959-4963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that it acts similarly as N 5-(1-iminoethyl)-l-ornithine (NIO) (28Fast W. Levsky M.E. Marletta M.A. Silverman R.B. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1997; 5: 1601-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This is supported by the close proximity of the proximal C1 and Cη1 atoms in the W1400.iNOSoxy and NIO.eNOSoxy (17Li H. Raman C.S. Martasek P. Masters B.S. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5399-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) complexes, respectively (Fig. 3C). In the case of NIO, inactivation occurs after an oxidation step prior to hydroxylation, ultimately resulting in heme degradation with biliverdin IX formation. Two inactivation mechanisms were proposed (28Fast W. Levsky M.E. Marletta M.A. Silverman R.B. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1997; 5: 1601-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In the first one, a lack of proton transfer from the inhibitor to the ferric-hydroperoxy-intermediate leads to uncontrolled peroxide formation and subsequent heme destruction. According to the second mechanism, the hydroperoxyintermediate abstracts a hydrogen from the terminal methyl carbon of NIO, thereby forming a carbon radical that attacks the heme meso-carbon to yield a heme-NIO-adduct, that reacts further, ultimately yielding biliverdin IX. Based on the structure of eNOSoxy complexed with NIO, Poulos and co-workers (17Li H. Raman C.S. Martasek P. Masters B.S. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5399-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) favored the first heme oxygenase-like mechanism since the methyl carbon of NIO is closest to the B nitrogen of the porphyrin but ∼4 Å away from the α-meso carbon. They suggested that this inactivation mechanism also applies to W1400 and explained the observation that W1400 is an irreversible activator only for iNOS by its higher turnover number compared with eNOS and nNOS (17Li H. Raman C.S. Martasek P. Masters B.S. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5399-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although this may be an important kinetic factor, our structures suggest additional reasons. For the first proposed oxygenase-like mechanism to work, the bound peroxide must be hindered to simply dissociate in a P450-shunt-like-fashion. Steric constraints by W1400 as positioned in iNOSoxy may do just that. In the first molecule in iNOS, W1400 is positioned such that the C1 methyl group would be very close to a bound hydroperoxy group. This distance is crucial in determining whether hydrogen abstraction as requested by the second mechanism is possible at all. The proposed inhibitor radical would be very close to the porphyrin NB nitrogen (Table II) and could react with it initially (29Mansuy D. Pure Appl. Chem. 1987; 59: 759-770Crossref Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 30Groves J.T. Watanabe Y. J. Am. Chem Soc. 1988; 110: 8443-8452Crossref Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 31Gerber N.C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17791-17796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) to yield a porphyrin N-oxide. This complex is believed to be an intermediate in suicide reactions of cytochrome P450 (32Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Kunze K.L. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 7266-7271Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 33Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P-450. Plenum Press, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). The structures suggest that this reaction pathway may represent a variation of the second inactivation mechanism. The considerable movement of W1400 in iNOS compared with nNOS leads to the positioning of the C1 methyl group within favorable distance for the second mechanism to operate, while the first one may be relevant for nNOS. Additional data are required to clarify the situation. The crystal structures presented suggest a rationale for isoform specificity that is rooted in isoform-specific residues outside the immediate active site but that nevertheless contribute to its shape. In particular, the active site is not rigid but displays some ligand induced conformational flexibility. Moreover, the exact positioning of the cofactor H4B, located at the isoform-specific interface between oxygenase monomers, seems to play an important role since it is involved in positioning the heme propionates, which may interact with functional groups of inhibitors. These findings on top of the high level of amino acid conservation and overall structural similarity (7Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Gachhui R. Wu C. Ghosh D.K. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A.

Biol. 1999; 6: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) identify a further difficulty in the rational design and analysis of the structure-activity relationships of isoform-specific NOS inhibitors. It seems that prediction and thus rational design of inhibitors targeted against the active site may be achieved only with compounds that are large enough to interact with isoform-specific residues in the substrate access channel or dimer interface and that fill out the active site, thereby locking its conformation."
https://openalex.org/W2036286713,"Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) is a transcription factor that activates prolactin (PRL)-dependent gene expression in the mammary gland. For the activation of its target genes, STAT5 recruits coactivators like p300 and the CREB-binding protein (CBP). In this study we analyzed the function of p300/CBP-associated members of the p160/SRC/NCoA-family in STAT5-mediated transactivation of β-casein expression. We found that only one of them, NCoA-1, acts as a coactivator for both STAT5a and STAT5b. The two coactivators p300/CBP and NCoA-1 cooperatively enhance STAT5a-mediated transactivation. For NCoA-1-dependent coactivation of STAT5, both the activation domain 1 and the amino-terminal bHLH/PAS domain are required. The amino-terminal region mediates the interaction with STAT5a in cells. A motif of three amino acids in an α-helical region of the STAT5a-transactivation domain is essential for the binding of NCoA-1 and for the transcriptional activity of STAT5a. Moreover we observed that NCoA-1 is involved in the synergistic action of the glucocorticoid receptor and STAT5a on the β-casein promoter.

It mediates the prolactin-induced differentiation of lobular alveolar end buds and the production of milk proteins during pregnancy (2Liu X. Robinson G.W. Hennighausen L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1496-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Several STAT5-target genes have been identified, which are up-regulated in response to prolactin, including β-casein, β-lactoglobulin, whey acidic protein, and cytokine-induced sequence (CIS) (3Li S.

Cell. 1998; 93: 841-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). There are two STAT5 genes in mammals, STAT5a and STAT5b (1Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 854-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 6Liu X. Robinson G.W. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Hennighausen L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8831-8835Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Both proteins are more than 95% homologous and they form homo- and heterodimers after phosphorylation and activation. Although both isoforms have overlapping roles in cytokine responses, specific functions for STAT5a and STAT5b have also been observed (5Teglund S. McKay C. Schuetz E. van Deursen J.M. Stravopodis D. Wang D. Brown M. Bodner S. Grosveld G. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 841-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). One reason for the different biological effects is a cell type-specific expression pattern of both isoforms. Moreover, it has been postulated that structural differences in the STAT5 transactivation domain or subtle differences in the DNA binding affinity of the different STAT5 dimers might affect gene regulation (7Grimley P.M. Dong F. Rui H. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1999; 10: 131-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Due to the higher expression level of the STAT5a gene in mammary epithelial cells, STAT5a protein seems to be the main regulator in mammary gland functions (5Teglund S. McKay C. Schuetz E. van Deursen J.M. Stravopodis D. Wang D. Brown M. Bodner S. Grosveld G. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 841-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). In contrast to that STAT5b mediates growth hormone-dependent sexual dimorphism of body growth and liver metabolism (8Udy G.B. Towers R.P. Snell R.G. Wilkins R.J. Park S.H. Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. Davey H.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7239-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). During transcriptional activation of target genes, dimerized STAT5 proteins bind to GAS elements in the promoter region and recruit coactivators to the promoter. These coactivators are able to promote the transcriptional initiation process through enhancement of DNA accessibility for general transcription factors by chromatin remodeling. Moreover, they promote the formation of the preinitiation complex by recruitment of components from the RNA polymerase holoenzyme. STAT5a and STAT5b contain an α-helical region in their transactivation domain, which is essential for the transcriptional activity and for the proteasome-dependent turnover of the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (9Wang D. Moriggl R. Stravopodis D. Carpino N. Marine J.C. Teglund S. Feng J. Ihle J.N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 392-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The hydrophobic residues 751 and 753 have been identified to be crucial for the transcriptional activity of STAT5a (10Callus B.A. Mathey-Prevot B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16954-16962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), but it is not known so far which proteins are targeted to this region. The transactivation domain of STAT5 proteins exhibits a weak transactivation potential, when tested as GAL4-STAT5 carboxyl-terminal fusion proteins (11Moriggl R. Gouilleux-Gruart V. Jahne R. Berchtold S. Gartmann C. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Sotiropoulos A. Groner B. Gouilleux F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5691-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). However, STAT5 acts as a strong activator of its target genes, for instance the β-casein gene. It is conceivable that the action of STAT5 is supported by other transcription factors, since the GAS sites in the promoter of target genes are in close vicinity to the DNA binding sites of other transcription factors. p300 and CBP (collectively termed as p300/CBP) represent common factors required for different transcription factors (12Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar).

Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2356) Google Scholar). In previous studies we have shown, that p300/CBP bind to STAT5 and coactivate STAT5-mediated transactivation of β-casein expression (15Pfitzner E. Jahne R. Wissler M. Stoecklin E. Groner B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1582-1593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). p300/CBP have been shown to serve as a platform for the assembly of multiprotein complexes, containing various transcription factors and coactivators (12Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

According to the current model of transcriptional regulation, different preformed coactivator complexes exist, which differ in their composition of various coactivator family members (17Lemon B. Inouye C. King D.S. Tjian R. Nature. 2001; 414: 924-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). These subcomplexes are primed for recruitment by a specific transcription factor (16Korzus E.

These are multifunctional proteins characterized by different domains mediating protein-protein interactions (24Leo C. Chen J.D. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 245: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Both NCoA-1 and NCoA-3 possess HAT activity (25Chen H. Lin R.J. Schiltz R.L. Chakravarti D. Nash A. Nagy L. Privalsky M.L.

Functional studies with knockout mice have revealed the involvement of p160/SRC/NCoA-coactivators for the action of steroid hormone receptors (34Xu J. Qiu Y. DeMayo F.J. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1922-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 35Weiss R.E. Xu J. Ning G. Pohlenz J. O'Malley B.W. Refetoff S.

A. 2000; 97: 6379-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). For example, the knockout mice lacking NCoA-1 and NCoA-3 exhibit defects in the development of the mammary gland. This phenotype was explained by the requirement for steroid receptor transactivation (34Xu J. Qiu Y. DeMayo F.J. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1922-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 36Xu J. Liao L. Ning G. Yoshida-Komiya H. Deng C. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6379-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). However, it should be kept in mind that the activity of other transcription factors important for mammary gland development, including STAT5, might also be diminished. The expression of the β-casein gene in mammary epithelial cells in vitro requires, in addition to prolactin stimulation, treatment with glucocorticoids (37Doppler W. Groner B. Ball R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Glucocorticoids act through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). GR has been shown to synergize with STAT5 in β-casein gene activation and physically associates with STAT5 (38Stocklin E. Wissler M. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Nature. 1996; 383: 726-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of the cooperative effect exerted by GR was reported to be due to a stabilization of DNA-binding and a prolonged phosphorylation of STAT5 (39Wyszomierski S.L. Yeh J. Rosen J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 330-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It is not yet clear if coactivators are required for the synergistic actions. Interestingly, GR recruits coactivators such as p300/CBP and members of the p160/SRC/NCoA family for activation of its target genes. Therefore it might be possible that GR supports coactivator recruitment of STAT5. In this study we analyzed the function of p160/SRC/NCoA-factors for STAT5-mediated transactivation of β-casein expression. Our results clearly demonstrate that NCoA-1, and not the other members of the p160/SRC/NCoA-family, acts as a coactivator for both STAT5a and STAT5b. We observed an interaction of STAT5 and NCoA-1 in cells. The analysis of NCoA-1 mutants in which functional domains were deleted, revealed that coactivation by NCoA-1 requires its activation domain 1 and the amino-terminal bHLH/PAS domain. This amino-terminal region mediates the interaction with STAT5 in cells. Two hydrophobic residues in the α-helical region of the STAT5a-transactivation domain are essential for the binding of NCoA-1 in cells and for the transcriptional activity of STAT5a. Our results demonstrate that STAT5 transactivates the β-casein gene by recruitment of a coactivator complex consisting of p300/CBP and NCoA-1. This complex is also involved in the synergistic action of GR and STAT5 on the β-casein promoter. Plasmids—The luciferase reporter construct pGL3-β-cas-LUC, which contains the β-casein gene promoter (–344 to –1) was obtained by insertion of the corresponding promoter fragment into the BglII sites of pGL3-basic (Promega). The estrogen responsive element (ERE) luciferase reporter construct pGL2-ERE TK-luc was obtained from Ludger Klein-Hitpass (Universitätsklinikum, Essen, Germany).

The expression vector pCS2+, which encodes for fusion proteins with 6xmyc-tag was provided by Ludger Klein-Hitpass (Universitätsklinikum, Essen, Germany). The vector encoding for the NCoA-1 sequence residues 1–361 fused to 6xmyc-tag was generated by insertion of the corresponding fragment, obtained by PCR, into the XhoI/XbaI sites of pCS2+. The expression vector encoding residues 361–1442 of rat SRC-1/NCoA-1 was generated by insertion of the corresponding fragment into the EcoRI sites of pCMV-HA (Clontech). The plasmid pCMV-GAL4-DBD encoding the DNA binding and dimerization domain (GAL4-DBD) of yeast GAL4 (residues 1–147) and the reporter gene construct (GAL4-RE)3TK-luciferase were described previously (41Moriggl R.

The GAL4 fusion constructs comprising STAT5a-TAD (residues 722–794) was generated by insertion of the corresponding inserts obtained by PCR into the EcoRI and NheI sites of pCMV-GAL4. The expression vector encoding Glucocorticoid receptor has been described previously (45Giguere V. Hollenberg S.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Evans R.M.

The expression vector for GFP-STAT5a has been generated by insertion of the cDNA of murine STAT5a, obtained by PCR into the EcoRI and XmaI sites of pECFP-C1 (Clontech). GFP-STAT5a derivatives, which encode for a deletion mutant of STAT5a lacking amino acids 750–768, and a mutated variant, possessing alanines at residues 751–753, were generated by replacing of the BssHII-XbaI fragment from GFP-STAT5a by the the BssHII-XbaI fragment of the corresponding pXM-STAT5a mutant vectors. Insertion of all constructs was verified by digestion. Sequences of insertions generated by PCR were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture, Transfections, and Luciferase Assays—HeLa cells, 293 cells, and 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Bio Whittaker) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin (Bio Whittaker). HC11 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, 10 ng/ml EGF, and 5 μg/ml insulin (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH). EGF was omitted during the transfections. HeLa cells were transfected with the Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 293 cells were transfected by the calcium-phosphate precipitation method. HC11 were transfected with the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The total amount of DNA was adjusted with the corresponding empty vector. 16 h before collecting the cells, 5 μg/ml PRL (from sheep pituitary gland, Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH) and 10–7m dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH) were applied to the cells or not. 48 h after transfection, the cells were harvested. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were assayed as recommended by the manufacturer (Promega). For HeLa and 293 cells luciferase activities were normalized to the LacZ expression. In the case of the HC11 cells, luciferase activities were normalized according to protein concentrations because of the high endogenous β–galactosidase activities. The average of three (HeLa, 293) and six (HC11) independent experiments with standard deviations is shown. Immunoprecipitations and Western Blots—293T cells were transiently transfected with the indicated expression vectors and treated for 30 min with 5 μg/ml PRL and/or 10–7m dexamethasone or left untreated. Cells were lysed in NETN buffer (0.2% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol), supplemented with complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitor mixture I and II (Sigma). Immunoprecipitations were performed with 2.5 μl of anti-GFP antiserum (Clontech) as indicated for 2–3 h. The immunoprecipitates were then incubated for further 1.5 h at 4 °C with protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Pierce). Immobilized immunoprecipitates were then washed three times with NETN buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Western blots were performed with anti-STAT5a (Transduction Laboratories, BD Biosciences), anti-NCoA-1 (Upstate Biotechnologies) and anti-Myc antibody (BD Pharmingen) and developed with ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Chromatin Immunoprecipitations (ChIP) Assay—CHIP experiments were performed according to the method of Barre et al. (46Barre B. Avril S. Coqueret O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2990-2996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). HC11 cells were grown to high confluency and kept for 2 days in EGF-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 2% fetal calf serum and 5 μg/ml insulin. Cells were stimulated with prolactin (5 μg/ml) and dexamethasone (0.1 μm) for 30 min, washed twice with PBS and cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. To harvest HC11 cells the plates were rinsed with ice-cold PBS and then scraped. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed in PBS and then resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, supplemented with complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitor mixture I and II (Sigma)) and sonicated three times for 15 s each at 50% amplitude Branson Sonifier W-250D. Supernatants were then recovered by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, diluted 3–5 times in dilution buffer (1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) and subjected to one round of immunoclearing for 2 h at 4 °C with 2 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA, 2.5 μg of control IgG (sc-2027, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 20 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Pierce). Immunoprecipitation was performed with the following antibodies: STAT5a and STAT5b (PA-ST5a and PA-ST5b, R&D Systems; 2 μg each), NCoA/SRC-1 (M-341, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 4 μg). After overnight incubation 2 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA and 25 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose beads (50% slurry) were further added for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed sequentially for 5 min each in TSE I (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl), TSE II (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl) and buffer III (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1). Bead precipitates were then washed three times with TE buffer and eluted two times with 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3. Eluates were pooled and heated at 65 °C overnight to reverse the formaldehyde cross-linking. Supernatants were then incubated for 1 h at 45 °C with proteinase K (80 μg each), and DNA was precipitated using classical procedures. For PCR, 5 μl from a 50-μl DNA preparation were used for 30 cycles of amplifications. The following primers were used for STAT5 binding: region –243/–1 of the CIS promoter (according to GenBank™ accession no. NT 039477) 5′-CGCCCGAGTTTTCCTGGAAAGT-3′(forward primer), 5′-AAAGGCTGTGGTGCGAACAGCT-3′ (backward primer), control region of the cis promoter –3849/–3660 5′-GTGACAGCAGCAAACTTCCA-3′ (forward primer), 5′-GACTTTCACATGGAGCAGCA-3′ (backward primer). Primers used for real-time PCR of CIS amplification were already described by (47Rascle A. Johnston J.A. Amati B. Mol. Cell.

NCoA-1 Acts as a Coactivator for Transcriptional Activation by STAT5a and STAT5b—Both STAT5 isoforms, STAT5a and STAT5b, mediate prolactin action in mammary epithelial cells, e.g. the expression of the β-casein gene (6Liu X.

Chem. 1992; 267: 16365-16370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In previous studies we demonstrate, that the coactivators p300 and CBP enhance transcriptional activation of the β-casein promoter by STAT5 (15Pfitzner E. Jahne R. Wissler M. Stoecklin E. Groner B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1582-1593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, we observed an interaction of p300 with the STAT5 transactivation domain in vivo. Both p300 and CBP are associated with members of the p160/SRC/NCoA-family (22Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

Two of these coactivators, NCoA-1 also called SRC-1 and NCoA-3 also called AIB-1, have been described to be involved in the regulation of mammary gland development and breast carcinogenesis (34Xu J.

Meltzer P.S. Science. 1997; 277: 965-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether members of the p160/SRC/NCoA-family are also involved in the transactivation of the β-casein gene, mediated by STAT5a and STAT5b. To address this question HeLa cells were transiently transfected with the prolactin receptor, STAT5a, and the β-casein luciferase reporter plasmids. This heterologous cell system allows study of prolactin-induced signaling and transcription normally restricted to mammary epithelial cells (15Pfitzner E. Jahne R. Wissler M. Stoecklin E. Groner B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1582-1593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 10-fold enhancement of reporter gene activity was obtained upon prolactin treatment under these conditions (Fig. 1A , lane 1). When various amounts of NCoA-1, -2, or -3 were cotransfected, only NCoA-1 was able to enhance STAT5a-mediated transactivation. Increasing amounts of NCoA-1-enhanced transcriptional activation by STAT5a in a linear dose-dependent manner. Cotransfection of 200 ng of NCoA-1 enhanced the activation 5-fold, relative to the level without exogenous coactivator (lanes 1 and 4). Thus, NCoA-1 is a limiting coactivator for STAT5a-mediated transactivation, whereas the other family members NCoA-2 and NCoA-3 may not be. STAT5a and STAT5b differ mainly in the amino acid sequence of the transactivation domain, the region, which contacts transcriptional coactivators. We wondered whether STAT5b would also show a preferential recruitment of NCoA-1 with respect to p160/SRC/NCoA-coactivators. When HeLa cells were transfected with STAT5b under the same conditions, a 12-fold activation of reporter gene expression in reponse to prolactin was observed (Fig. 1B ,"
https://openalex.org/W2087497548,"Overexpression of keratin 16 has been observed in keratinocytes in those skin diseases characterized by hyperproliferation such as psoriasis. Therefore, keratin 16 is usually referred to as a disease-associated keratin. In the present study, we found that epidermal growth factor (EGF) increased the expression of keratin 16 mRNA and protein synthesis in a time-dependent manner in HaCaT cells. Reporter assays revealed that the EGF response region was in the range of -162 to -114 bp. Disruption of the Sp1 site (-127 to -122 bp) and the AP1 site (-148 to -142 bp) of the keratin 16 promoter by site-directed mutagenesis significantly inhibited keratin 16 promoter activity induced by EGF. Furthermore, keratin 16 gene expression induced by Ras activation was also regulated in the same manner as the EGF response. By using the DNA affinity precipitation assay in HaCaT and SL2 cells, Sp1 directly interacted with the Sp1 site of the promoter, and c-Jun and c-Fos precipitated with the Sp1 oligonucleotide was attributable to the interaction between the Sp1 and AP1 proteins. Moreover, cotransfection assays revealed that Sp1 acted synergistically with c-Jun to activate keratin 16. The coactivators p300/CBP could collaborate with Sp1 and c-Jun in the activation of keratin 16 promoter, and EGF-induced promoter activation was blocked by the viral oncoprotein E1A. Taken together, these results suggest that Sp1 and AP1 sites in the essential promoter region are critical for EGF response, and Sp1 showed a functional cooperation with c-Jun and coactivators p300/CBP in driving the transcriptional regulation of EGF-induced keratin 16 gene expression.

The epidermis forms the external surface of the skin and consists of many layers including the stratum basale, stratum spinosum, stratum granulosum, stratum lucidum, and stratum corneum (1Fuchs E. Byrne C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 725-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Keratinocytes are the most abundant of the cell types in the epidermis. The maintenance of homeostatic balance in epidermal keratinocytes is dependent on the coordinate regulation of differentiation and activation (2Paramio J.M. Casanova M.L. Segrelles C. Mittnacht S. Lane E.B. Jorcano J.L. Mol. Cell.Biol. 1999; 19: 3086-3094Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In healthy epidermis, the basal keratinocytes are mitotically active cells that differentiate sequentially from the basal to the cornified layer in skin (3Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2807-2814Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). However, in response to epidermal injury or in certain skin diseases characterized by hyperproliferation, such as psoriasis and epidermal malignancies, the basal keratinocytes become activated. They are triggered to terminal differentiation and initiate their migration and hyperproliferation through the suprabasal layers (4Komine M. Rao L.S. Freedberg I.M. Simon M. Milisavljevic V. Blumenberg M. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2001; 116: 330-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The activated epidermal keratinocytes become able to produce and response to growth factors and cytokines, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; TGF-α, transforming growth factor-α; EGF-RE, EGF-responsive element; Sp1, simian virus 40 promoter factor 1; AP1, activator protein 1; CBP, CREB binding protein.1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; TGF-α, transforming growth factor-α; EGF-RE, EGF-responsive element; Sp1, simian virus 40 promoter factor 1; AP1, activator protein 1; CBP, CREB binding protein. and transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α) (5Freedberg I.M.

In psoriatic lesions, overexpression of EGF receptor (6Nanney L.B. Stoscheck C.M. Magid M. King L.E. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1986; 86: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) and TGF-α (7Elder J.T. Fisher G.J. Lindguist P.B. Bennett G.L. Pittelkow M.R. Coffey R.J. Ellingsworth L. Derynck R. Voorhees J.J. Science. 1989; 243: 811-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar) has been reported. The most prominent cytoskeletal proteins in keratinocytes are keratins, a large family of proteins that form the intermediate filament network in all epithelial cells. There are about 30 keratins that can be subdivided into type I (acidic) and type II (basic) according to biochemical criteria. They are usually expressed in pairs with one partner from each group (8Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar). The programmed expression of keratins, which is determined by the location and function of the keratinocytes within the epidermis, is a commonly used phenotypic marker of epithelial development and differentiation. The basal layer of the epidermis produces keratins K5, K14, and low amounts of K15 (9Lloyd C. Yu Q.C. Chang J. Turksen K. Degenstein L. Hutton E. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1329-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), and the differentiating, suprabasal layers produce keratins K1, K2, and K10 (3Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2807-2814Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), whereas in activated keratinocytes, keratins K6, K16, and K17, which are distinct from the keratins in the healthy epidermis, are expressed (10Machesney M. Tidman N. Waseem A. Kirby L. Leigh I. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 1133-1141PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, keratins K6, K16, and K17 are usually referred to as activation- and hyperproliferation-associated keratins. In the skin diseases characterized by hyperproliferation such as psoriasis, keratin 16 expression has been detected (11Komine M. Rao L.S. Kaneko T. Tomic-Canic M. Tamaki K. Freedberg I.M. Blumenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32077-32088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Furthermore, keratin 16 has been reported to be the marker of keratinocyte hyperproliferation in psoriasis in vivo and in vitro (12Leigh I.M. Navsaria H. Purkis P.E. Mckay I.A. Bowden P.E. Riddle P.N. Br. J. Dermatol. 1995; 133: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Keratin 16 is absent in normal breast tissue and in non-invasive breast carcinomas, but 10% of the invasive breast carcinomas show diffuse or focal positive with the K16 antibody (13Wetzels R.H.W. Kuijpers H.J.H. Lane E.B. Leigh I.M. Troyanovsky S.M. Holland R. van Haelst U.J.G.M. Ramaekers F.C.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 751-763PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported as having expression limited to skin and breast tissue. However, the specific function of keratin 16 is not fully understood. Mutations in the keratin 16 gene in the human population have been associated with pachyonychia congenita type I, which features hyperkeratosis and occasional blistering in the absence of keratinocyte lysis (14McLean W.H.I. Rugg E.L. Lunny D.P. Morley S.M. Lane E.B. Swensson O. Dopping-Hepenstal P.J.C. Griffiths W.A.D. Eady R.A.J. Higgins C. Navsaria H.A. Leigh I.M. Stachan T. Kunkeler L. Munro C.S. Nat.Genet. 1995; 9: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Keratin 16 mutations can also be presented as focal non-epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma, which produce phenotypes with little or no nail changes (15Corden L.D. McLean W.H. Exp. Dermatol. 1996; 5: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In the studies of gene regulation of keratin 16, Jiang et al. (16Jiang C.K. Magnaldo T. Ohtsuki M. Freeberg I.M. Bernerd F. Blumenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6786-6790Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) reported previously that the hyperproliferation-inducing agents, EGF and TGF-α, induce keratin 16 expression in normal human epidermal keratinocytes and found that an EGF-responsive element (EGF-RE), located at the promoter ranged from -212 to -192 bp, is required for EGF and TGF-α responses. However, the transcription factors acting on the EGF-RE were not identified. In the study of basal expression of keratin 16 in human epidermal keratinocyte cells, in addition to EGF-RE, an Sp1 binding site located in the promoter range from -127 to -121 bp is also essential (17Magnaldo T. Bernerd F. Freeberg I.M. Ohtsuki M. Blumenberg M. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 911-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The aim of the present work is to further characterize the EGF-responsive region in the human keratin 16 gene promoter in a spontaneously immortalized keratinocyte (HaCaT) cell line. We found that the transcription factor AP1 acting on an EGF-responsive region, which was distinct from EGF-RE reported by Jiang et al. (16Jiang C.K. Magnaldo T. Ohtsuki M. Freeberg I.M. Bernerd F. Blumenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6786-6790Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), cooperated with Sp1 to activate the gene promoter.

All other reagents used were of the highest purity obtainable. Cell Culture and EGF Treatment—HaCaT cells, a spontaneously immortalized human epidermal keratinocyte cell line, were grown at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in 10-cm plastic dishes containing 8 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle′s medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml of streptomycin and 100 IU/ml of penicillin. In this series of experiments, cells were treated with 30 ng/ml of EGF in optimal serum-free conditions, unless stated otherwise. Drosophila Schneider line 2 (SL2) cells were maintained at 25 °C in Schneider′s Drosophila medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Cells maintained for 2 days in serum-free medium were incubated with EGF for the indicated time period as described and harvested. Total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol RNA extraction kit, and 5 μg of RNA were subjected to reverse transcription-PCR with SuperScript™II. The keratin 16-specific primers and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers were used as controls. The PCR products were separated by 1% agarose-gel electrophoresis and visualized with ethidium bromide staining. Preparation of Cell Lysates—Cells from 10-cm plastic dishes were washed twice with PBS and lysed with RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HC1, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% IGEPAL CA-630, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml of leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml of aprotinin.

The suspension was centrifuged at 7,500 × g for 2 min. The supernatants were collected and stored at -70 °C until used. Buffer A and buffer C contained 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml of leupeptin, 1 mm orthovanadate, 2 μg/ml of pepstatin A, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Western Blots—Analytical 10% SDS-polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis was performed. The cell nuclear extracts or lysates (30–200 μg of protein of each) prepared from control and EGF-treated cells were analyzed. The supernatants were mixed with 5× SDS loading buffer followed by boiling for 5 min. For immunoblotting, proteins in the SDS gels were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by an Electroblot apparatus (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). After blocking with 5% non-fat dried milk in 1× PBS buffer, the blots were incubated with antibodies against specific proteins as the primary antibodies, individually. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were added, and the bands were detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence kit from Pierce Biotechnology (SuperSignal, Rockford, IL). DNA Affinity Precipitation Assay—This assay was performed according to the method of Zhu et al. (18Zhu Y. Saunders M.A. Yeh H. Deng W.G. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6923-6928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. The binding assay was performed by mixing 200 μg of nuclear extract proteins, 2 μg of biotinylated keratin 16-specific Sp1 or AP1 oligonucleotides, and 20 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads (4%) with 50% slurry. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h with rotating. Beads were pelleted and washed with cold PBS three times. The binding proteins were eluted by loading buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blot analysis probed with specific antibodies. 5′-Biotinylated wild-type and mutated Sp1 sequences were Sp1-WT, 5′-biotin-GTTAGGAGGGCCCCGCCTTCCCCAGG-3′ and Sp1-Mut, 5′-biotin-GTTAGGAGGGCCCAAACTTCCCCAGG-3′. 5′-Biotinylated wild-type AP1 sequence was AP1-WT, 5′-biotin-GGGGAACCTGGAGTCAGCAGTTAGGA-3′. DNA Gel Mobility Shift Assay—Double-stranded oligonucleotides prepared by the PCR method were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase as described previously (19Chen B.K. Kung H.C. Tsai T.Y. Chang W.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Labeled oligonucleotides were purified by ProbeQuant™ G-50 Micro Columns and used as probes. The binding reaction was performed in 15 μl of reaction mixture containing 0.2 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 0.25 mm EDTA, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 5% (w/v) polyvinyl alcohol, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.6 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 μg of the cell nuclear extracts, and the radiolabeled probe (2 × 104 cpm). The mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and loaded on a 5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoresis was performed at a constant 300 V for 1.5 h. The gel was dried and autoradiographed. Plasmid Construction—Human keratin 16 promoter regions of various lengths were prepared by the PCR-amplification method for the preparation of pXK-1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5-1, 5-2, and 6 as described previously (20Arakawa T. Nakamura M. Yoshimoto T. Yamamoto S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and the mutants at the sites of Sp1 and AP1 were constructed by the site-directed mutagenesis method as described by Higuchi et al. (21Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar). The sequences were all confirmed by DNA sequencing with the chromosome 17q12–q21 reported by The Human Genome Project. These DNA fragments were ligated into the respective polycloning sites of pXP-1. Transfection with LipofectAMINE and Reporter Gene Assay—Cells were transfected with plasmids by lipofection using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer′s instruction with a slight modification. Cells were replated 24 h before transfection at an optimal cell density in 2 ml of fresh culture medium in a 3.5-cm plastic dish. For use in transfection, 12.5 μl of LipofectAMINE were incubated with 0.5 μg of pXK luciferase plasmid or the indicated plasmids as described in each experiment, in 1 ml of Opti-MEM medium for 30 min at room temperature. Total DNA concentration for each transfection was matched with pcDNA3.1. Cells were transfected by changing the medium with 1 ml of Opti-MEM medium containing the plasmids and LipofectAMINE, followed by incubation at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 24 h. After a change of Opti-MEM medium to 2 ml of fresh culture medium, cells were stimulated with EGF if necessary and then incubated for an additional 24 h. The luciferase activities in cell lysates were measured by the luciferase assay system and determined as described previously (22Liu Y.W. Arakawa T. Yamamoto S. Chang W.C. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was normalized per μg of extract protein. Transfection by the Calcium Phosphate Method—Drosophila SL2 cells were replated 24 h before transfection at a density of 3.6 × 106 cells in 8 ml of fresh culture medium in a 10-cm plastic dish. Cells were transfected with 4 μg of either Drosophila expression vector pPac-Sp1 or the empty vector pPac by the calcium phosphate/DNA co-precipitation method as described (23DiNocera P.P. Dawid I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7095-7098Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The DNA precipitates were left on the cells, followed by incubation at 25 °C for 24 h. The medium was changed to 8 ml of fresh culture medium. After an additional 48 h, cells were washed twice with PBS, and the nuclear extracts were collected. Stimulation of Keratin 16 Expression by EGF—EGF stimulated the expression of keratin 16 mRNA and protein in a time-dependent fashion. As shown in Fig. 1A, the maximum induction of keratin 16 mRNA was observed in cells treated with EGF for 24 h and sustained at least up to 48 h. The maximum induction of keratin 16 protein was observed at 48 h after EGF stimulation and then declined almost to the basal level in cells treated with EGF for 72 h (Fig. 1B). Identification of the Promoter Sequence of Human Keratin 16 Gene—To study the promoter activation, the nucleotide in the 5′-flanking region of the human keratin 16 gene was cloned from HaCaT cells by polymerase chain reaction. The sequence shown in Fig. 2 was confirmed by DNA sequencing and completely matched the sequence of chromosome 17q12–q21 reported by The Human Genome Project. Comparison of the sequence with transcription factor databases revealed that five AP1 sites and one Sp1 site are present in the 515-bp promoter region of the human keratin 16 gene. Essential Role of Ras on EGF-induced Promoter Activation of the Keratin 16 Gene—Although Ras has been shown to be activated upon EGF treatment in several cell lines, whether the Ras signal leads to the expression of the keratin 16 gene has not been elucidated. To determine whether EGF-induced keratin 16 promoter activation in HaCaT cells was mediated by Ras signaling, the luciferase reporter vector bearing 5′-flanking region of the keratin 16 gene (pXK-1), and expression vectors of Ras dominant-positive plasmid pSV2ras (Ha-ras) and Ras dominant-negative mutant pMMrasDN (24Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell.Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar) were used. The results are summarized in Fig. 3. Overexpression of pSV2ras significantly stimulated the keratin 16 reporter activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, transfection of pMMrasDN in cells dose-dependently inhibited EGF-induced promoter activation of keratin 16 (Fig. 3B). The results indicated that the Ras signaling pathway plays a very significant role in EGF-induced expression of keratin 16. Keratin 16 Promoter Analysis of EGF and Ha-ras Responses—To study the transcriptional regulation of the keratin 16 gene in HaCaT cells, the luciferase reporter vectors bearing various lengths of 5′-flanking regions of keratin 16 gene were constructed as shown in Fig. 4. The transcriptional activities of luciferase-bearing vectors pXK-1, pXK-2, pXK-3, pXK-4, pXK-5, pXK-5-1, pXK-5-2 and pXK-6 were stimulated by EGF treatment and by Ha-ras overexpression. The results are summarized in Fig. 4. There was ∼30% decrease in the stimulatory response of EGF and Ha-ras transfection observed in vectors bearing a promoter with an identical deletion from -162 to -141 bp (pXK-5-1 to pXK-5-2). A more significant decrease (∼70%) in EGF and Ha-ras-stimulated response was observed in a promoter region covering from -141 to -114 bp (pXK-5-2 to pXK-6). These results indicated that the 5′-flanking region of the keratin 16 gene ranging from -162 to -114 bp was required for EGF response as for Ha-ras response. Sequence analysis of the keratin 16 promoter region from -162 to -114 bp indicated the presence of two putative binding sites for AP1 (-148 to -142 bp) and Sp1 (-127 to -122 bp). To further study the EGF- and Ha-ras-responsive regions in the promoter ranging from -162 to -114 bp, plasmids with site-directed mutagenesis of the AP1 site, the Sp1 site, and both sites in the promoter region were constructed (Fig. 5A). The results are summarized in Fig. 5B. A slight decrease (∼30%) in the stimulatory response of EGF or Ha-ras overexpression was observed in pXK-mAP1 (5-1) with the mutated AP1 site, and the effect was equivalent to that in pXK-5-2 with a deletion of AP1 site. A more apparent decrease (∼70%) in EGF- or Ha-ras-stimulated response was observed in pXK-mSp1 (5-1) with the mutated Sp1 site, and a complete elimination of EGF or Ha-ras response was detected in pXK-dm (5-1) with double mutations at the AP1 and Sp1 sites and pXK-mSp1 (5-2) with a deletion of the AP1 site and a mutation at the Sp1 site. These results suggested that both the AP1 site residing at -148 to -142 bp and the Sp1 site residing at -127 to -122 bp were two critical elements for EGF response and for Ha-ras response. Effects of EGF and Ha-ras on the Expression of Sp1, c-Jun, and c-Fos—Several recent studies have implicated Sp1 proteins (25Brembeck F.H. Rustgi A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28230-28239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and AP1 proteins (26Rossi A. Jang S.-I. Ceci R. Stetnert P.M. Markova N.G. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1998; 110: 34-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), respectively, as key regulators in the transcriptional control of epidermal gene expression. To study the possible transcription factors involved in this EGF response, expression of Sp1, c-Jun, and c-Fos in cell nuclear extracts from HaCaT cells was analyzed by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 6A, EGF induced the expression of c-Jun and c-Fos proteins in a time-dependent manner. The maximum induction of c-Jun protein was observed in cells treated with EGF for 1 h and then sustained at least up to 24 h after EGF treatment. In contrast to the long-term expression of c-Jun protein, the maximum induction of c-Fos protein was also observed at 1 h after EGF treatment, but the induction then declined and almost disappeared in cells treated with EGF for 6 h. However, no change in Sp1 protein expression was found by EGF treatment. Besides the EGF response, we also examined levels of c-Jun expression in HaCaT cells transfected with Ha-Ras and found that overexpression with 0.5 to 2 μg of pSV2ras induced the expression of c-Jun protein in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6B). Identification of the Nuclear Factors Involved in the Expression of the Keratin 16 Gene—DNA affinity precipitation assay, which provides quantitative information of transactivator binding, was performed to examine whether any of the above-mentioned nuclear factors bound to the promoter sequence from -162 to -114 bp and to evaluate the effect of EGF on the binding of these transactivators. Oligonucleotides covering the Sp1 site (-127 to -122 bp) and the AP1 site (-148 to -142 bp), respectively, were synthesized, labeled with biotin, and used as probes. Nuclear extracts from HaCaT cells treated with and without EGF as indicated were incubated with the biotinylated probe and streptavidin-agarose beads. Transcription factors present in the complex were analyzed by Western blot. No change in Sp1 binding to the 5′-biotinylated wild-type Sp1 sequence (Sp1-WT) was found by EGF treatment. However, a significant binding of c-Jun and c-Fos to Sp1-WT was detected in cells treated with EGF, particularly at 1 h after treatment (Fig. 7A). Additionally, EGF induced the bindings of c-Jun and c-Fos to the 5′-biotinylated wild-type AP1 sequence (AP1-WT) in a time-dependent manner. The maximum bindings of c-Jun and c-Fos were both observed in cells treated with EGF for 1 h, but unlike c-Fos, binding declined quickly; c-Jun binding to AP1-WT was sustained and slightly decreased at 24 h after EGF stimulation (Fig. 7B). These results supported the notion that transcription factors Sp1 as well as c-Jun and c-Fos were all detected on the Sp1 site by EGF treatment, and those bound to the AP1 site were c-Jun and c-Fos. To confirm the specificity of the AP1 proteins bound to the Sp1 sequence of promoter, the 5′-biotinylated mutated Sp1 sequence (Sp1-Mut) was used. As shown in Fig. 7C, no binding of c-Jun and c-Fos to the Sp1-Mut probe was observed in cells treated with EGF for 1 h, compared with its respective binding to the Sp1-WT probe, whereas lack of Sp1 binding to the Sp1-Mut probe was also observed in cells as expected, with and without EGF treatment. These results indicated that the AP1 proteins were specifically precipitated with the Sp1 site in this probe. To further determine whether c-Jun and c-Fos bindings to the Sp1 site were through protein-protein interaction with Sp1 or independent on Sp1, DNA gel mobility shift assay and supershift assay were performed to examine the identities and specificities of those proteins binding to the Sp1 probe. Oligonucleotide covering the Sp1 site (-127 to -122 bp) from -141 to -111 bp (SpWT) was synthesized by the PCR method and labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and used as a probe. When nuclear extracts from HaCaT cells were allowed to react with SpWT, three retarded bands (a, b, and c) were observed (Fig. 8A , lane 1). Binding of the HaCaT cell nuclear proteins prepared from control and EGF-treated cells to the promoter probe was analyzed. No change in these nuclear protein-DNA complexes was found in cells treated with EGF for 1 and 3 h, compared with its respective control cells (Fig. 8A , lanes 1–3). For identifying whether Sp1 and Sp3 bound the DNA probe, polyclonal antibodies that specifically recognize human Sp1 and Sp3 proteins were used for the supershift assay. The retarded band b was shifted by the antibody against Sp1 (Fig. 8A , lane 4), and the retarded band c was abolished by the Sp3 antibody (Fig. 8A , lane 5), but all of these three retarded bands were not altered by the antibodies against c-Jun and c-Fos (Fig. 8A , lanes 6 and 7). Furthermore, these t"

Inhibition of VEGF-dependent events in tumor tissues is known to enhance apoptosis and to suppress tumor growth. A novel peptide, SP5.2, which selectively binds Flt-1 and inhibits a broad range of VEGF-mediated events, was identified using a phage-display library screening. The fluorescein-labeled SP5.2 specifically bound to VEGF-stimulated primary human cerebral endothelial cells (HCECs), whereas non-stimulated HCECs, as well as human neuroblastoma cells (ShyY) did not show any interaction with the peptide. SP5.2 prevented proliferation of cultured primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells induced by recombinant human VEGF165 with an IC50 of 5 μm. SP5.2 was also shown to antagonize VEGF- and PLGF-induced, but not basic fibroblast growth factor-induced proliferation of HCECs. In contrast to “scrambled” peptide, SP5.2 was also found to selectively inhibit VEGF-stimulated migration of HCECs. The in vitro analysis of antiangiogenic activity of SP5.2 using a capillary-like tube formation assay showed that VEGF-induced angiogenesis of HCECs grown on Matrigel™ was completely inhibited in the presence of 10 μm SP5.2. Further studies demonstrated that SP5.2 prevented VEGF-induced permeability increase in HCECs monolayers. To explore whether SP5.2 can be used as a targeting agent, chemical and recombinant conjugates of SP5.2 with reporter proteins (peroxidase and β-galactosidase) were produced. The resulting products showed significant increases (200-fold for SP5.2-β-gal and 400-fold for SP5.2-peroxidase) in binding affinity to recombinant Flt-1 compared with the original synthetic SP5.2, suggesting that conjugate with therapeutic activity in nanomolar range could potentially be developed based on SP5.2 structure.

VEGF is unique among the growth factors in being an endothelial cell-specific mitogen that promotes the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells, remodeling of the extracellular matrix, formation of capillary tubules and vascular leakage (4Wang D.

VEGF activities are mediated through binding to two high affinity receptors, human kinase domain receptor (KDR) and Fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor (Flt-1) (5Shibuya M. Yamaguchi S. Yamane A. Ikeda T. Tojo A. Matsushime H. Sato M. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 519-524PubMed Google Scholar), both of which are selectively expressed on endothelial cells during embryogenesis and VEGF-related pathologies (6Millauer B. Wizigmann-Voos S. Schnurch H. Martinez R. Moller N.P. Risau W. Ullrich A. Cell. 1993; 72: 835-846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). Both of these receptors are class III tyrosine kinases (7Vaisman N. Gospodarowicz D. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19461-19466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kaipainen A.

Studies in mice have shown that the expression of KDR reaches the highest levels during embryonic vasculogenesis and angiogenesis (6Millauer B. Wizigmann-Voos S. Schnurch H. Martinez R. Moller N.P. Risau W. Ullrich A. Cell. 1993; 72: 835-846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). In contrast, low Flt-1 mRNA levels were found during fetal growth, moderate during organogenesis, and high in newborn mice (9Peters K.G. De Vries C. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8915-8919Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The third VEGF receptor from the tyrosine kinase family, Flt-4, is largely confined to the lymphatic vasculature and has a role in lymph angiogenesis (10Dumont D.J. Jussila L. Taipale J. Lymboussaki A. Mustonen T. Pajusola K. Breitman M. Alitalo K. Science. 1998; 282: 946-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Flt-4 binds VEGF-C and -D, but not VEGF (11Achen M.G. Stacker S.A. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 1998; 79: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Neuropillin-1 (NRP-1) was recently identified as a new receptor for VEGF (12Partanen T.A. Makinen T. Arola J. Suda T. Weich H.A. Alitalo K. Circulation. 1999; 100: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It is expressed in the enocardium, coronary vessels, myocardial capillaries, and epicardial blood vessels of human fetal heart (12Partanen T.A. Makinen T. Arola J. Suda T. Weich H.A. Alitalo K. Circulation. 1999; 100: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Experiments with knockout mice deficient in Flt-1 or KDR receptor revealed that KDR is essential for the development of endothelial cells, whereas Flt-1 is necessary for the organization of embryonic vasculature (13Fong G.H. Rossant J. Gertsenstein M. Breitman M.L. Nature. 1995; 376: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (2216) Google Scholar, 14Shalaby F. Rossant J. Yamaguchi T.P. Gertsenstein M. Wu X.F. Breitman M.L. Schuh A.C. Nature. 1995; 376: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar). The VEGF-Flt-1 receptor system also plays an important role in the simulation of tumor angiogenesis, which makes Flt-1 an interesting target for antiangiogenic drugs (15Shibuya M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1995; 67: 281-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human Flt-1 receptor is composed of seven extracellular Ig-like domains containing the ligand binding region, a single short membrane-spanning sequence, and an intracellular region containing the tyrosine kinase domain. The amino acid sequences of Flt-1 and KDR show ∼45% identity; however, Flt-1 has a higher affinity for VEGF (KD = 10–20 pm) compared with KDR (KD = 75–125 pm). The activation of Flt-1 receptor by VEGF regulates interactions of endothelial cells with each other or the basement membrane on which they reside (16Quinn T.P. Peters K.G. De Vries C. Ferrara N.

Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternative splicing of the Flt-1 receptor results in two forms, the full-length membrane-spanning receptor and a soluble form, denoted sFlt-1. Isolated sFlt-1 retains specific high affinity binding for VEGF and fully inhibits VEGF-stimulated endothelial cell mitogenesis by dominant negative mechanism (18He Y. Smith S.K. Day K.A. Clark D.E. Licence D.R. Charnock-Jones D.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 537-545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was suggested that sFlt-1 might form heterodimeric complexes with KDR with potentially negative effect on KDR signal transduction (19Kendall R.L. Wang G. Thomas K.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 324-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Because VEGF receptors are implicated in several pathologies, pharmacological interference with the VEGF/VEGF receptor system antagonists is clinically attractive. Humanized neutralizing antibodies that interact with VEGF near the KDR and Flt-1 binding sites (20Kim K.J. Li B. Winer J. Armanini M. Gillett N. Phillips H.S. Ferrara N.

Anti-VEGF antisense oligonucleotide has been shown to inhibit VEGF expression, VEGF-induced neovascularization, and tumor implantation and growth (29Melnyk O. Shuman M.A. Kim K.J.

However, no truly antagonistic compounds that would selectively discriminate between Flt-1 and KDR receptors are available yet. In the present study, a new peptide motif that inhibits VEGF binding to Flt-1 has been identified using a phage-displayed peptide library. A random 16-mer peptide library displayed on the surface of the filamentous phage M13 was screened against the extracellular domain of Flt-1. This screening resulted in a peptide (SP5.2) that competed with VEGF for the Flt-1 binding and inhibited a broad range of VEGF-induced events in cultured endothelial cells. Potential use of SP5.2 as a targeting agent was evaluated using both synthetic and genetically constructed conjugates of the peptide and reporter proteins. Materials—A recombinant Flt-1 receptor chimera consisting of the six N-terminal extracellular domains of human Flt receptor and Fc fragment of human IgG was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The goat polyclonal anti-hFlt-1 antibody, rhVEGF165, hKDR/Fc chimera, mNRP-1/Fc chimera, hsICAM-1, mFlt-1/Fc chimera, and mFlk-1/Fc chimera were obtained from R&D Systems. Biotin-labeled anti-human IgG (Fc-specific) rabbit polyclonal antibody was purchased from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). The mouse monoclonal anti-β-galactosidase clone Gal-13 and anti-mouse IgG peroxidase conjugate developed in goat and absorbed with rat serum proteins were obtained from Sigma (Oakville, Ontario, Canada). The anti-histidine HRP conjugate antibody was purchased from Invitrogen (Burlington, Ontario, Canada). Scrambled peptide was synthesized at Supratek (Laval, Quebec, Canada). Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were purchased from BioWhittaker Inc. (Walkersville, MD). The cells were cultured in the endothelial growth medium, Clonetics media EGM & EGM BulletKit™ (BioWhittaker Inc.). The cells were used for the experiments at their 3rd or 4th growth passage. HCECs were isolated using previously described protocols (32Stanimirovic D. Morley P. Ball R. Hamel E. Mealing G. Durkin J.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 169: 455-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Purity of HCEC cultures generated by these procedures was routinely assessed by the immunocytochemical staining for Factor VIII-related antigen and the lack of staining for smooth muscle β-actin and was estimated to be >95%. The morphological, phenotypic, biochemical, and functional characteristics of these HCEC cultures have been described in detail previously (32Stanimirovic D. Morley P. Ball R. Hamel E. Mealing G. Durkin J.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 169: 455-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 33Muruganandam A. Herx L.M. Monette R. Durkin J.P. Stanimirovic D.B. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1187-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). For endothelial permeability studies, HCECs were used as an in vitro blood-brain barrier model described previously (33Muruganandam A. Herx L.M. Monette R. Durkin J.P. Stanimirovic D.B. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1187-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Bacterial Strains and Bacteriophages—K91Kan cells obtained from G. Smith were grown on LB agar supplemented with kanamycin (100 μg/ml). Cells were made competent using the protocol described previously by Smith (34Smith G.P. Scott J.K. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 228-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). M15 was purchased from Qiagen (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) cells made competent following the protocol from Qiagen. pQE16 vector purchased from Qiagen and pCMVb vector from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). The phage library containing the 16-amino acid peptide was constructed essentially as previously described, using fUSE5 as the phage vector (35Popkov M. Lussier I. Medvedkine V. Esteve P.O. Alakhov V. Mandeville R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This linear library consisted of 109 independent recombinant phages recovered as tetracycline-resistant colonies. Sequencing of randomly selected clones indicated that the majority of these phages (>90%) contain inserts. Screening the Phage Display Library with Flt-1-coated Magnetic Particles—The receptor, rhFlt-1 chimera (10 μg in 50 μl of 0.1% BSA/PBS), was immobilized on streptavidin-coated magnetic particles (Roche Applied Science, Laval, Canada) using biotinylated anti-hIgG(Fc) antibody. The Flt-1-coated magnetic particles (Flt-MPs) were blocked with 3% BSA/PBS for 2 h at room temperature. For selection, phage (1 × 1011 cfu) from the linear 16-amino acid random peptide phage display library diluted in 0.1% BSA/PBS were added to Flt-MP and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After extensive washing with 0.1% BSA/PBS, the bound phage were either eluted with a low pH buffer (0.2 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.2) or displaced from Flt-MP with 10 μg/ml rhVEGF165 for 1 h at 22 °C. Recovered phages were amplified using competent K91Kan Escherichia coli cells and then subjected to four subsequent rounds of selection on Flt-MP. Phage binding was quantified by counting the phage titer in eluted aliquots from Flt-MP as described earlier (34Smith G.P. Scott J.K. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 228-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Phages from selected clones were sequenced at Sheldon Biotechnology center (McGill, Montreal). ELISA for the Displacement of Phage Binding—The rhFlt-1 receptor chimera were immobilized on Streptavidin-coated microtiter plates (total binding capacity for biotin-labeled AB = 1.5 μg/well, Roche Applied Science). Biotin-labeled anti-human FC antibody (ICN), at a concentration of 10 μg/ml in 0.1% BSA/PBS, were added into each well of the plates. The plates with assay mixtures were incubated at 4 °C for 8 h in a humidified container and then washed four times with 0.1% BSA/PBS. Recombinant human Flt-1/Fc chimera (1 μg/well in 0.1% BSA/PBS, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) were added into each well, and the plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C in a sealed container to allow the receptor to attach to the ligand. Unbound receptor was washed away with 2 ml of 0.1% BSA/PBS. Each well was then filled with 250 μl of blocking buffer (2% nonfat dry milk in PBS) and incubated at room temperature for 2–3 h. As a negative control, three of the wells were blocked with the blocking buffer (2% nonfat milk in PBS). Phage particles (5 × 109 to 1 × 1010 cfu/well) were added to each well and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. In competition experiments, phage suspension was premixed with various concentrations of competing agent (SP5.2 peptide, rhVEGF165) and then added to immobilized receptor. Wells were washed with 0.1% BSA/PBS, and the amount of bound phages was detected with peroxidase-conjugated anti-M13 antibody (Amersham Biosciences). After the addition of the substrate, ABTS, and H2O2, antibody reaction was analyzed in a microtiter plate reader at 405 nm. Production of Mutant Variants of SP5.2 Phage—Several mutations in SP5.2 coding oligonucleotide inserts were carried out to identify the amino acids involved in the receptor binding site domain. The single point mutations in V5.2 phage insert coding sequence were produced as described previously (36Hoess R. Brinkmann U. Hanel T. Pastan I. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 128: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Briefly, a series of SP5.2-coding oligonucleotides, with a particular amino acid coding triplet replaced with GCT (alanine-coding triplet), was synthesized by Invitrogen (Ontario, Canada). The mutant oligonucleotides were cloned into fUSE5 phage vector as described (35Popkov M. Lussier I. Medvedkine V. Esteve P.O. Alakhov V. Mandeville R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). All mutants were purified and verified by DNA sequencing. Peptide Synthesis—Peptide amides were synthesized manually on solid Rink amide resin (Nova Biochem) using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) protocol and (benzotriazol-1-yloxy)tripyrro-lidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP) activation. The fluorescein residue was introduced into the peptide by standard coupling of N-terminal-deprotected peptide with fluorescein-5-carboxylic acid. Peptide amides were cleaved from the resin with trifluoroacetic acid:water: ethanedithiol:triisopropylsilane (95:5:2.5:2.5, v/v) and were recovered by precipitation with ice-cold diethyl ether. Crude products were purified by high performance liquid chromatography on a Vydac C18 column using a linear gradient of 30% to 70% acetonitrile/water (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid), for 60 min at a 5-ml/minute flow rate. The identity of peptides was verified by electrospray mass spectrometry (PE Sciex API III Biomolecular Mass Analyzer, Applied Biosystems, CA). Binding Competition for Flt-1 Receptor—Fluorescein-labeled peptide in 0.1% BSA/PBS buffer, pH 8.5, was added at various concentrations (0, 0.1, 1, 10, 50, and 100 μm) into wells of an ELISA plate coated with immobilized Flt-1 receptor. In competition experiments, the various concentrations of phage or VEGF165 were mixed and added into wells. After 2-h incubation, microtiter plates were washed 10 times with 0.1% BSA/PBS buffer, pH 8.5, and the bound peptide was measured using a microplate fluorescence reader (FL600, BioTek) (λex = 485 nm; λem = 530 nm). Flt-1 Receptor Immunochemistry—HCECs were grown on glass coverslips in a 24-well dish for 3 days until sub-confluent. Media was aspirated out; cells were washed two times in PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were subsequently washed three times in PBS, incubated in blocking solution containing 5% goat serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, and exposed to the primary antibody (5 μg/ml goat anti-human Flt-1 in blocking solution; R&D Systems Inc) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times in blocking solution, cells were exposed to the secondary antibody (1:20 dilution of donkey anti-goat IgG-immunogold in blocking solution; Accurate Chemical and Scientific Corp.) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then extensively washed (three times with blocking solution and three times with distilled water) and incubated in silver enhancing solution for 30 min (1:1 dilution of reagents A and B). After washing with distilled water (two times for 5 min), slides were viewed under a microscope. SP5.2 Binding to Cells—Fluorescein-labeled SP5.2 peptide was added to HCECs cells at different concentrations, (1, 10, and 50 μm) and incubated for 30 min. The neuroblastoma ShyY cell line was used as a negative control. Media were aspirated, and cells were washed in phenol red-free M199 and observed under a fluorescence microscope. Endothelial Cell Proliferation Assay—HUVECs were placed in 96-well plates (Costar) at 104 cells per well in 200 μl of EGM-2 medium (Clonetics) supplemented with 0.5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. HCECs were placed in 12-well plates and allowed to grow for 3 days until sub-confluent. Cells were then washed once by PBS and incubated in a serum- and glucose-free DMEM for 24 h to suppress cell growth. Both HCECs and HUVECs were then exposed to various treatments (i.e. 10% fetal bovine serum, VEGF165 (20 ng/ml), PLGF (100 ng/ml), bFGF (10 ng/ml) in the absence or presence of SP5.2 peptide). Scrambled peptide NGSAIAASSAVTHGMS at the same concentration was used as control. After 48 h of incubation, 1 μCi of [methyl-3H]thymidine (20 Ci/mmol; ICN) was added in each well, and plates were incubated for an additional 24 h. The cells were then placed on ice, washed twice with EGM-2 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and fixed for 10 min in ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. After washing with ice-cold water, cells were lysed and DNA was solubilized in 50 μl of 2% SDS. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was determined by scintillation counting. Endothelial Cell Migration—Migration of calcein-AM labeled (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, 10 μm for 20 min at 37 °C) HCECs stimulated by VEGF165 were tested in the absence or presence of SP5.2 peptide or scrambled peptide using a ChemoTx #101-5 assembly (Neuro Probe, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) consisting of a 96-well plate and a polycarbonate filter membrane, as described in a previous study (37Junger W.G. Cardoza T.A. Liu F.C. Hoyt D.B. Goodwin R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1993; 160: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, the wells of the plates were loaded with buffer containing various chemoattractants or phenol red- and serum-free media conditioned by cancer cells. The framed filter membrane was positioned on top, and 50,000 calcein-AM-labeled HCECs were suspended in 20 μl of matching buffer, or media was applied on the top of each membrane/well. The assembly was incubated for 120 min at 37 °C, and the number of endothelial cells transmigrated into the wells was quantified by measuring the intensity of fluorescence (excitation/emission: 485/530 nm) in a CytoFluor 2350 reader (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Capillary Tube Formation in Matrigel™—HCECs were seeded (8 × 104 cells) on a semi-solid basement membrane matrix, Matrigel™ (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA)-coated 24-well plates and exposed to serum-free media containing various treatments. Cells were treated with 10 nm VEGF165 or glioblastoma cell (U-87MG, ATCC, Rockville, MD)-conditioned media (serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium conditioned for 48–72 h) in the absence or presence of SP5.2 or control peptide for 24 h. HCECs were then labeled with a vital dye, calcein-AM (2 μm) for 30 min. Cells were then washed in PBS and capillary-like tube formation, a measure of in vitro angiogenesis, was observed using a Zeiss LSM 410 inverted laser scanning microscope (Thornwood, NY) with an argon/krypton ion laser and a Zeiss LD achroplan 5×, 0.6-numerical aperture objective. Confocal apertures for each recorded wavelength were adjusted to a full-width half maximum of 20 μm. The emitted light was collected through a 515- to 540-nm band-pass filter using an excitation of 488 nm. 8–32 individual optical sections were collected, and the average was calculated. Standard image processing was performed to enhance brightness and contrast using ImageSpace software (Molecular Dynamics Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). SP5.2-β-gal Fusion Construction—The prokaryotic expression vector, pQE-16, purchased from Qiagen, was used to construct the fusion protein SP5.2-β-gal, containing SP5.2 peptide on the N terminus and His6 on the C terminus of β-galactosidase. For this the vector pCMV-β from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA) was digested with BamH1 (New England Biolabs), the resulting β-galactosidase gene was purified from agarose gel and modified by PCR as so to introduce BglII at the 3′-end for cloning into pQE16 instead of dihydrofolate reductase, which has been removed by digestion of plasmid with BamHI and BglII. The SP5.2 insert, containing the EcoRI site at the 5′-end and the BamHI site at the 3′-end, was prepared by annealing the two single-stranded oligonucleotides synthesized by INRS-IAF (Laval, Quebec, Canada) and inserting them into the pQE16-β-gal vector. pQE16-SP5.2-β-gal was used to transform competent E. coli M15 cells. The resulting clones were sequenced to verify the fusion gene. Fusion Protein Expression and Purification—An overnight culture of a single colony was grown in 400 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin to an optical density of ∼0.6 at 600 nm. The culture was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galacto-pyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C, centrifuged, and the resulting pellet was stored at –80 °C. The expression of β-galactosidase and the presence of His tag were verified by Western blot using anti-β-galactosidase (Sigma, Ontario, Canada) and anti-His-HRP antibody (Invitrogen, Ontario, Canada). The pellet was thawed and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0), and lysozyme was added to a concentration of 1 mg/ml. After incubation for 30 min at 4 °C, 400 μl of 50% nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen, Ontario, Canada) was added to the supernatant and incubated 1 h shaking at 4 °C. The lysate/nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid mixture was loaded into a column (Qiagen),"
https://openalex.org/W2088722066,"SGLT1 as a sodium/glucose cotransporter is strongly inhibited by phlorizin, a phloretin 2′-glucoside that has strong interactions with the C-terminal loop 13. We have examined phlorizin recognition by the protein by site-directed single Trp scanning mutagenesis experiments. Six mutants (Q581W, E591W, R601W, D611W, E621W, and L630W) of truncated loop 13 (amino acids 564–638) were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. Changes in Trp quenching and positions of the emission maxima were determined after addition of phlorizin. D611W displayed the largest quenching of 80%, followed by R601W (67%). It also exhibited the maximum red shift in Trp fluorescence (∼14 nm), indicating an exposure of this region to a more hydrophilic environment. Titration experiments performed for each mutant showed a similar affinity for all mutants, except for D611W, which exhibited a significantly lower affinity (Kd ≈ 54 μm). Also the maximum change in the collisional quenching constant by acrylamide was noted for D611W (KSV = 11 m–1 in the absence of phlorizin and 55 m–1 in its presence). Similar results were obtained with phloretin. CD measurements and computer modeling revealed that D611W is positioned in a random coil situated between two α-helical segments. By combining gel electrophoresis, enzymatic fragmentation, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry, we also analyzed truncated loop 13 photolabeled with 3-azidophlorizin. The attachment site of the ortho-position of aromatic ring B of phlorizin was localized to Arg-602. Taken together, these data indicate that phlorizin binding elicits changes in conformation leading to a less ordered state of loop 13. Modeling suggests an interaction of the 4- and 6-OH groups of aromatic ring A of phlorizin with the region between amino acids 606 and 611 and an interaction of ring B at or around amino acid 602. Phloretin seems to interact with the same region of the protein.

In mammals, transepithelial transport of d-glucose is mediated by SGLT1 (sodium/glucose cotransporter-1), which can be found in the brush-border membranes of the small intestine and kidney. The transporter facilitates the effective uptake of glucose into cells driven by the electrochemical potential difference of sodium. Coupling and translocation are supposed to be accompanied by conformational changes in the protein. Such changes could be induced, for example, by Na+, which increases the affinity of the cotransporter for sugar (1.Hirayama B.A. Loo D.D. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2110-2115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 2.Loo D.D. Hirayama B.A. Gallardo E.M. Lam J.T. Turk E. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7789-7794Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Extensive mutagenesis studies revealed that the N-terminal half of the protein contains the Na+-binding sites, whereas glucose binds and permeates through the C-terminal half of the cotransporter (3.Vayro S. Lo B. Silverman M. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 4.Panayotova H.M. Eskandari S. Turk E. Zampighi G.A. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20324-20327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Amino acids 162–173 apparently constitute part of an external Na+ pore in the SGLT1 protein, whereas sugar binding is controlled by Gln-457 and Thr-460 (5.Lo B. Silverman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29341-29351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 6.Diez-Sampedro A. Wright E.M. Hirayama B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49188-49194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The cotransport system is inhibited by glucosides with either aromatic or aliphatic aglucon residues. Phlorizin, a β-glucoside of the aromatic compound phloretin, is the most potent competitive inhibitor, with an apparent Ki of 1 μm (7.Diedrich D.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1966; 117: 248-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It is proposed that the phlorizin binding to SGLT1 is a two-step process: rapid formation of an initial collision complex, followed by a slow isomerization process that occludes phlorizin within its receptor site (8.Oulianova N. Falk S. Berteloot A. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 179: 223-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Phlorizin is thereby supposed to bind to both the sugar-binding site and the aglucon-binding site, the latter with a hydrophobic/aromatic surface (9.Oulianova N. Berteloot A. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 153: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 10.Hirayama B.A. Diez-Sampedro A. Wright E.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 134: 484-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis studies suggest that a hydrophobic region located in the C-terminal loop 13 (amino acids 604–610) is critically involved in the binding of phlorizin (11.Novakova R. Homerova D. Kinne R.K. Kinne-Saffran E. Lin J.T. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 184: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The binding of phlorizin to loop 13 could be confirmed in solution by monitoring phlorizin-dependent fluorescence quenching of the endogenous Trp-561. It has been demonstrated further that the phloretin (but not the glucose) moiety of phlorizin interacts with loop 13 (12.Xia X. Lin J.T. Kinne R.K.H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6115-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The strong sensitivity of Trp fluorescence intensity to protein microenvironment is routinely exploited to follow a variety of protein conformational changes, e.g. ligand/substrate binding, folding/unfolding, etc. (13.Callis P.V. Vivian J.T. Chem. Phys. Lett. 2003; 369: 409-414Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We used this signal to characterize the structure-function relationship of loop 13, with the refinement to place Trp residues at different positions of the molecule as reporter groups. Wild-type truncated loop 13 and six mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified, and the activity and signal produced by each single Trp peptide were monitored. Changes in Trp fluorescence and the different accessibilities of each Trp mutant to acrylamide in the presence and absence of phlorizin were thereby used to probe the sequence-specific interactions. The results show that phlorizin binding affects the various mutants differently. The largest changes were found for D611W. A qualitatively similar effect on D611W was observed with phloretin. To identify unequivocally the interaction sites of phlorizin during its binding to SGLT1, we also performed photoaffinity labeling of truncated loop 13 with a photoreactive 3-azido analog of phlorizin. Taken together, the data suggest that an insertion of phlorizin between two α-helical segments of loop 13 occurs together with strong interactions between the OH groups of aromatic ring A of phlorizin and the area between amino acids 601 and 611.

The ApaI site (underlined) was silently introduced in a selection primer as an aid in screening with the oligonucleotide primer 5′-GCA AAT CGC GCT GTT AGC GGG ACC ATT AAG TTC TGT CTC GGC-3′. The PCR product was purified using the normal primers flanking the mutation site to produce an insert with BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites. The resulting 222-bp fragment was ligated into the pCR2.1-TOPO cloning vector and sequenced prior to mutagenesis. The confirmed cDNA was ligated into the pGEX-4T-1 expression vector. The mutant cDNAs were sequenced to verify the desired mutations at various points. The recombinant plasmids were then transformed into BL21(DE3) cells for expression of the mutant truncated C terminus of SGLT1. Protein Expression and Purification—Wild-type and mutant proteins tagged at the N terminus with glutathione S-transferase were expressed using 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction for 3.5 h at 37 °C in a 2-liter culture. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 20 ml of PBS 1The abbreviations used are: PBSphosphate-buffered salineBis-Tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol3-AP3-azidophlorizinMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. lysis buffer (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.8 mm KH2PO4 adjusted to pH 7.3) supplemented with 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, and protease inhibitor mixture (one tablet). Cells were effectively lysed using the SONOPULS ultrasonic homogenization system under mild conditions. The lysate was centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing glutathione S-transferase-tagged proteins was applied to a glutathione-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) after passage through a 0.2-μm filter. Soluble fractions of wild-type truncated loop 13 and all mutants (amino acids 564–638) after removing the protease inhibitor were generated by treating the glutathione-Sepharose-immobilized fusion protein, derived from pGEX-4T-1, with 2 units/ml thrombin in PBS for 16 h at 4 °C. The purity of the wild-type truncated and mutant proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE using a precast 4–12% Bis-Tris gel in Tris/glycine running buffer and staining with Coomassie Blue. All protein concentrations were determined by the Lowry method using bovine serum albumin as a standard. phosphate-buffered saline 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol 3-azidophlorizin matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. Steady-state Trp Fluorescence—The fluorescence experiments were performed on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS 50B luminescence spectrometer fitted with a 450-watt xenon arc lamp at room temperature. A 0.3-cm excitation and emission path length quartz cell was used for all fluorescence measurements. The excitation wavelength was set at 295 nm for selective excitation of Trp fluorescence. A 290-nm cutoff filter was used to minimize the contribution of scattering signals. Emission spectra were collected from 300 to 400 nm, averaging six scans. The bandwidths for both excitation and emission monochromators were 5 nm. The emission spectra were corrected for background and dilution effects. Quenching of Intrinsic Protein Fluorescence—Acrylamide-dependent Trp fluorescence quenching experiments were performed in PBS (pH 7.3) for the wild-type and mutant proteins (5 μm) in the absence and presence of 50 μm phlorizin or phloretin. Acrylamide was added from aliquots of an 8 m stock solution to each protein solution (25 °C) at up to 500 mm. The proteins were incubated with the substrate at room temperature for 2 min prior to collecting the fluorescence spectra. The accessibility of Trp were monitored by analyzing the quenching data using a Stern-Volmer equation: F0/F = 1 + KSV[Q], where F0 is the fluorescence of the protein in the absence of quencher, and F is the observed fluorescence at the concentration of the quencher ([Q]). KSV is the collisional quenching constant, which was determined from the slope of best fit values of the Stern-Volmer plot at a given concentration of the quencher. The difference between inner filter effects of substrate (50 μm) from the titration of l-Trp (5 μm) performed at an excitation of 295 nm and an emission at 355 nm was found to be much less and hence was not considered in our measurements. Ligand Binding Assay—The ligand-induced fluorescence quenching as a function of phlorizin or phloretin concentration was monitored as described (12.Xia X. Lin J.T. Kinne R.K.H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6115-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Increasing amounts of phlorizin or phloretin (1–650 μm) were added to all Trp mutants (5 μm) in PBS. Briefly, as increasing amounts of phlorizin or phloretin were added, the fluorescence intensity decreased. Apparent binding constants were calculated from titration data by determining the percentage of quenching at saturating phlorizin or phloretin concentrations using a single-site binding equation in the nonlinear regression analysis program Prism (GraphPAD, San Diego, CA). Photoaffinity Labeling of Truncated Loop 13 with 3-Azidophlorizin— Photoaffinity labeling was performed with the photolabile phlorizin analog 3-azidophlorizin (3-AP) synthesized as reported previously (20.Gibbs E.M. Hosang M. Reber B.F.X. Semenza G. Diedrich D.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 688: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 21.Lin J.T. Hahn K.D. Kinne R.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 693: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The photolabeling experiments were carried out in 200 μl of PBS (pH 7.3) containing 200 μg of truncated loop 13 protein and 1 mm 3-AP. The mixture was preincubated at room temperature in the dark for 5 min. After incubation, photolysis was carried out in a Rayonet RPR-100 photochemical reactor (Southern New England Ultraviolet Co., Branford, CT) fitted with 16, 2800 Å lamps at 22 °C for 10 min. As a control, the photoprobe was first exposed to UV light and then added to the protein. No labeling was observed in the absence of UV light. After photoaffinity labeling, the protein was precipitated with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). A small part of the protein pellet was solubilized with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 50% acetonitrile for MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis, and the rest of the protein pellet was dissolved in sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using NuPAGE 4–12% BisTris gels (Invitrogen). Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (22.Neuhoff V. Stamm R. Eibl H. Electrophoresis. 1985; 6: 427-448Crossref Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Bands of interest were excised from the gel with a clean razorblade, sliced into 1-mm3 cubes, incubated overnight at room temperature with 200 μl of 50 mm NH4HCO3 (pH 8.5) and 50% acetonitrile, dehydrated with 200 μl of acetonitrile, and dried in a centrifugal evaporator. Gel pieces were rehydrated with a small volume of digestion solution (50 mm NH4HCO3, 5 mm CaCl2, and 12.5 ng/μl trypsin) at 4 °C for 30 min. Trypsin was used at an enzyme/substrate ratio of ∼1:100 by weight. Digestion was allowed to proceed overnight at 37 °C. Peptides were extracted from the gel pieces with 100 μl of 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate, followed by two extractions of 1:1 water/acetonitrile plus 1% trifluoroacetic acid and one extraction with 100 μl of acetonitrile. All extracts were combined in a fresh tube, flash-frozen, and dried in a centrifugal evaporator. Dried extracts were stored at –20 °C until analyzed. Mass spectra were acquired in the positive ion linear mode on a Voyager DE-PRO MALDI apparatus (PE-Biosystems, Shelton, CA). After mixing the solubilized protein with 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid matrix (saturated 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid solution in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 50% acetonitrile) for intact truncated loop 13 protein and for acquisition of a mass spectrometric peptide map of the trypsin-digested protein, 0.5-μl aliquots of the generated cleavage products were dispensed onto the sample support, followed by 0.5 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix solution (solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 50% acetonitrile). Samples were deposited on a MALDI plate and dried at room temperature prior to collecting the spectra. Circular Dichroism Analysis—The far-UV CD spectrum was recorded between 190 and 250 nm (350-μl sample volume) on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter equipped with a temperature-controlled incubator at 20 °C using 1-mm optical path length quartz cells and 10 μm wild-type loop 13. The step size was 0.5 nm with a 1.0-nm bandwidth at a scan speed of 50 nm/min. An average of 10 scans was obtained for blank and protein spectra, and the data were corrected for buffer contributions. Measurement was performed under nitrogen flow. The secondary structure percentages were calculated using the K2d computer modeling program. The results are expressed as mean residue ellipticity in units of degrees/cm2/dmol. The spectrum was recorded in 10 mm phosphate buffer at pH 6.8. Protein Expression and Purification—Proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity with a yield of ∼2.5 mg/liter culture. Plasmid pGEX-4T-1 containing wild-type truncated loop 13 generates a Trp-free protein; thus, the introduced Trp is the only reporter group for each of the mutant proteins. Mutants Q581W and E591W: Fluorescence and Effect of Phlorizin—The corrected spectra of Trp fluorescence (λex = 295 nm) of Q581W and E591W are shown in Fig. 1 (A and B, respectively). The emission maxima of both Trp mutants are in the range of 347–350 nm, which is typical for a hydrophilic environment. 100 μm phlorizin was used to monitor the percentage of quenching regarding the various positions of each Trp mutant. Quenching of fluorescence reaching ∼54% with a slight red shift (∼3 nm) was observed in the spectrum of Q581W, whereas the fluorescence of E591W was quenched by 58%, accompanied by a more noticeable red shift (∼5–6 nm). Mutants R601W, D611W, E621W, and L630W: Fluorescence and Effect of Phlorizin—The corrected Trp fluorescence spectra of R601W, D611W, E621W, and L630W are shown in Fig. 1 (C–F, respectively). The fluorescence maxima for these proteins are in the range of 340–343 nm, indicating a slightly less polar environment compared with Q581W and E591W. The fluorescence of R601W was quenched upon addition of phlorizin by 67% with a 8-nm red-shifted spectrum, D611W by 80% with a maximum red shift of 14 nm, and E621W by 65% with a red shift of 10–11 nm. Fluorescence quenching of L630W was only ∼18%; however, the same red shift as in E621W was observed. The differences between the fluorescence quenching spectra of the various mutants suggest that different segments of loop 13 react differently to the binding of phlorizin to the loop. Such differences could, however, also be due to differences in the phlorizin affinity of the mutants. We therefore determined the apparent binding affinities. Effect of the Mutations on Phlorizin Binding—Titration of all single Trp mutants with different concentrations of phlorizin is shown in Fig. 2. About 90% of the fluorescence of each mutant was quenched at the highest concentration of phlorizin. The estimated equilibrium dissociation constants for all mutants are presented in Table I. For calculation of binding constants, the peak points with shifting toward longer wavelength were collected upon each addition of phlorizin. The mutant proteins (e.g. Q581W, E591W, R601W, E621W, and L630W) showed values very similar to those of wild-type loop 13 (12.Xia X. Lin J.T. Kinne R.K.H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6115-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), indicating that the replacement of amino acids at these positions with Trp residues does change the ability of the protein to bind phlorizin. However, the D611W mutant has a lower affinity, which has to be taken into account when conformational changes are considered (see below).Table IApparent affinity of phlorizin for the single Trp mutants of truncated loop 13ProteinKdaThe apparent equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) were determined from the nonlinear regression analysis of the percentage of fluorescence quenching as a function of phlorizin concentration using a computer-based analysis program (Prism).

Open table in a new tab Effect of Phlorizin on Trp Accessibility Monitored by Collisional Quenching—The collisional quencher acrylamide was used to detect changes in the “availability” of Trp to the surrounding solvent. The Stern-Volmer quenching plots of each mutant in which F0/F is plotted against the acrylamide concentration in the presence and absence of phlorizin were linear and are shown in Fig. 3. The Stern-Volmer constants for all mutants are compiled in Table II. Upon phlorizin binding, the Stern-Volmer constant for Q581W did not change significantly. At 50 μm phlorizin, a non-significant protection effect was noted for mutant Q581W. For the E591W and R601W mutant proteins, the quenching constants started to increase, and an ∼4–5-fold increase by phlorizin was found for D611W. E621W showed less quenching, and almost no quenching was observed for L630W. These data suggest that the major conformational changes are initiated by phlorizin at and/or in the vicinity of amino acid 611.Table IIStern-Volmer quenching of all single Trp mutants of truncated loop 13ProteinPhlorizinaQuenching experiments were conducted in the presence (+) or absence (-) of 50 μm phlorizin.KSVbThe Stern-Volmer quenching constants were determined from the slopes of the lines of Fo/F = 1 + KSV[Q].

Open table in a new tab Phloretin-induced Changes in Trp Fluorescence and Accessibility to Acrylamide—To check the effect of phloretin, the aglucon of phlorizin, on Trp quenching and accessibility, the same experiments were also performed for D611W in the presence of phloretin. The corrected spectra of Trp fluorescence (λex = 295 nm) of D611W in the presence and absence of 100 μm phloretin are shown in Fig. 4A. The fluorescence of D611W was quenched upon addition of phloretin by 69% with a 9–10-nm red-shifted spectrum. The linear Stern-Volmer quenching plot of D611W in the presence and absence of phloretin is shown in Fig. 4B. An increase in the Stern-Volmer quenching constant for D611W from 11 to 31 m–1 was observed in the presence of 50 μm phloretin. Detection of Truncated Loop 13 Photocross-linked to 3-AP by MALDI Mass Spectrometry—The reaction product of photolabeling of truncated loop 13 with 3-AP was analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometry. Fig. 5 (upper panel) shows the expected mass peak for loop 13 at m/z 8825.60, and Fig. 5 (lower panel) demonstrates photoaffinity labeling of the loop with 3-AP. Peak I corresponds to truncated loop 13 (m/z 8825.60), and peak II corresponds to the photolabeled truncated loop 13 protein (m/z 9275.10). The mass difference between peaks I and peak II (Fig. 5, lower panel) corresponds to the mass of photolyzed 3-azidophlorizin (m/z 449.5). MALDI Mass Spectrometry of Loop 13 Photolabeled with 3-AP—As a next step in the identification of the ligand contact points, photolabeled truncated loop 13 was digested in gel with trypsin. After extraction of the peptides from the gel, the resulting mixture was analyzed in MALDI-TOF mode with unlabeled truncated loop 13 as a reference (Table III). The only additional peak observed in the labeled probe was at m/z 624.52 (Fig. 6, lower panel). This can be explained as an adduct peak to m/z 175.11 (corresponding to Arg-602), with a difference of 449.41. The latter is equal to the mass of photolyzed azidophlorizin. All other peaks appeared also in the control as shown in Fig. 6 (upper panel).Table IIITheoretical and measured masses of photolabeled truncated loop 13 digested with trypsin as shown inFig. 5FragmentAmino acidsSequenceTheoretical mass (M + H)+ monoisotopicMeasured mass (M + H)+Additional peaks11-3PER401.21NDaNot determined.24-6NSK348.18ND37-9EER433.20ND410-33IDLDAGEEDIQEAP EEATDTEVPK2614.182614.37534K147.11147.27635K147.11147.27736K147.11147.27837-40GFFR526.27526.41941R (602)175.11175.35624.52bDenominates a peptide plus label.1042-53AYDLFCGLDQDK1387.611387.631154-56GPK301.18ND1257-59MTK379.20380.851360-66EEEAAMK807.35807.261467-68LK260.19ND1569-77LTDTSEHPL1012.49NDa Not determined.b Denominates a peptide plus label. Open table in a new tab Structural Determination—The CD spectrum of wild-type truncated loop 13 at pH 6.8 is shown in Fig. 7. The CD spectrum shows characteristic minima at 222 and 208 nm, from which the secondary structure was estimated to consist of 37% α-helical residues and 63% random coil. The secondary structure agrees well with calculated values based on the amino acid sequence (14.McGuffin L.J. Bryson K. Jones D.T. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 404-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2689) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the structure-function relation of membrane proteins has been hindered by difficulties in expressing the complete protein. We therefore chose to express a fragment supposed to function in the receptor region for the inhibitor phlorizin. Six different single Trp mutants of truncated loop 13 were overexpressed using site-directed mutagenesis to investigate the binding of phlorizin in detail. The use of a truncated loop 13 (amino acids 564–638) compared with the previously used complete loop 13 was favored to introduce reporter molecules at different positions of the loop, to increase the solubility, and to avoid complications by intraprotein disulfide bridge formation between cysteines 560 and 608 (12.Xia X. Lin J.T. Kinne R.K.H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6115-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Truncation of the molecule did not, however, interfere with the ability of the protein to interact with phlorizin. The phlorizin dissociation constants in our studies are very similar to those determined for the formation of the initial collision complex by Oulianova and Berteloot (9.Oulianova N. Berteloot A. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 153: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) in intact membrane vesicles and also agree with the observed binding constant for complete loop 13 (12.Xia X. Lin J.T. Kinne R.K.H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6115-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W1986004996,"Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is a post-transcriptional process that amplifies the repertoire of protein production. Recently, the induction of this process through up-regulation of the editing enzyme RNA-specific adenosine deaminase 1 (ADAR1) was documented during acute inflammation. Here we report that the inflammation-induced up-regulation of ADAR1 involves differential production and intracellular localization of several isoforms with distinct RNA-binding domains and localization signals. These include the full-length ADAR1 (p150) and two functionally active short isoforms (p80 and p110). ADAR1 p80 starts at a methionine 519 (M519) due to alternative splicing in exon 2, which deletes the putative nuclear localization signal, the Z-DNA binding domain, and the entire RNA binding domain I. ADAR1 p110 is the mouse homologue of the human ADAR1 110-kDa variant (M246), which retains the second half of the Z-DNA binding domain, all RNA binding domains, and the deaminase domain. Additional variations are found in the third RNA binding domain of ADAR1; they are differentially regulated during inflammation, generating isoforms with different levels of activities. Studies in several cell types transfected with ADAR1-EGFP chimeras demonstrated that the p150 and p80 variants are localized in the cytoplasm and nucleolus, respectively. In agreement with this observation, endogenous ADAR1 was identified in the cytoplasm and nucleolus of mouse splenocytes and HeLa cells. Since the ADAR1 variants are differentially regulated during acute inflammation, it suggests that the localization of these variants and of A-to-I RNA editing in the cytoplasm, nucleus, and nucleolus is intracellularly reorganized in response to inflammatory stimulation.

These editases are capable of both nonspecific editing of dsRNA and site-specific editing of glutamate receptor subunit B (gluR-B) mRNA and serotonin receptor mRNA (11Yang J.H. Sklar P. Axel R. Maniatis T. Nature. 1995; 374: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 12Burns C.M. Chu H. Rueter S.M. Hutchinson L.K. Canton H. Sanders-Bush E. Emeson R.B. Nature. 1997; 387: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). ADAR2 selectively edits gluR-B at the Q/R site and serotonin at the D site; ADAR1 preferentially targets gluR-B at the hot spot and serotonin at the A and C sites (12Burns C.M. Chu H. Rueter S.M. Hutchinson L.K. Canton H. Sanders-Bush E. Emeson R.B. Nature. 1997; 387: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). Q/R site editing requires the formation of a base-pairing structure around the editing site for specific substrate recognition by ADAR2. The importance of the secondary structure in substrate recognition was confirmed in a study in which deletion of the stem-loop structures around the Q/R editing site abolished site-specific editing (11Yang J.H. Sklar P. Axel R. Maniatis T. Nature. 1995; 374: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). ADAR3 and ADAT1 do not seem to edit these substrates. A nuclear localization signal (NLS) and a Z-DNA binding domain are present near the N-terminal region of ADAR1 and are conserved in all species. This NLS is also called a nuclear export signal, since the human ADAR1 was initially localized to the cytoplasm and was found in the nucleus after nuclear export was blocked (13Poulsen H. Nilsson J. Damgaard C.K. Egebjerg J. Kjems J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 7862-7871Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The human ADAR1 also has an atypical NLS within its dsRBDIII and thus displays the characteristics of a shuttling protein (14Eckmann C.R. Neunteufl A. Pfaffstetter L. Jantsch M.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1911-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In contrast, the Xenopus ADAR1 contains a distinct NLS, which leads this enzyme to the nascent ribonucleoprotein matrix on Xenopus lampbrush chromosomes, where it is specifically associated with active transcriptional sites. Thus, it is conceivable that the editing activity of Xenopus ADAR1 is coupled with transcriptional events or that it targets newly synthesized RNAs (15Eckmann C.R. Jantsch M.F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 603-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Functional consequences of A-to-I RNA editing have been observed in the central nervous system. In the mammalian brain, editing of gluR-B pre-mRNA by ADAR2 has been shown to alter the calcium permeability of excitatory neurons (16Lomeli H. Mosbacher J. Melcher T. Hoger T. Geiger J.R. Kuner T. Monyer H. Higuchi M. Bach A. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1994; 266: 1709-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 17Feldmeyer D. Kask K. Brusa R. Kornau H.C. Kolhekar R. Rozov A. Burnashev N. Jensen V. Hvalby O. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The role of ADAR2 in the nervous system was further studied in mice homozygous for a targeted functional null allele. In ADAR2 -/- mice, A-to-I RNA editing of diverse mRNAs is substantially reduced; seizure activity and early death occur (18Higuchi M. Maas S. Single F.N. Hartner J. Rozov A. Burnashev N. Feldmeyer D. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Nature. 2000; 406: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). In the Drosophila brain, disruption of the dADAR gene (a homologue of ADAR2) abolishes sodium, calcium, and chloride channels (19Hanrahan C.J. Palladino M.J. Ganetzky B. Reenan R.A. Genetics. 2000; 155: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ma E. Gu X.Q. Wu X. Xu T. Haddad G.G. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 685-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 21Palladino M.J. Keegan L.P. O'Connell M.A. Reenan R.A. Cell. 2000; 102: 437-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Mutants lacking dADAR exhibit extreme behavioral deficits and neurodegeneration (21Palladino M.J. Keegan L.P. O'Connell M.A. Reenan R.A. Cell. 2000; 102: 437-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an oxygen-sensitive dADAR mutant suffers prolonged recovery from anoxic stupor, vulnerability to heat shock, and increased O2 demands (20Ma E. Gu X.Q. Wu X. Xu T. Haddad G.G. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 685-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, editing of ion channel pre-mRNAs by dADAR appears to be critical for the integrity and function of the central nervous system. Studies in ADAR1 chimeric mouse embryos demonstrated that this editing enzyme affects embryonic erythropoiesis (22Wang Q. Khillan J. Gadue P. Nishikura K. Science. 2000; 290: 1765-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). In these studies, most embryos died before the 14th embryonic day due to hematopoietic defects, suggesting that editing in this developmental stage is critical for normal erythrocyte proliferation and/or differentiation. Several observations suggest that A-to-I RNA editing plays a role in the immune system. First, ADAR1 can be induced by interferon (IFN) in human amnion U cells (23Patterson J.B. Thomis D.C. Hans S.L. Samuel C.E. Virology. 1995; 210: 508-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 24Weier H.U. George C.X. Greulich K.M. Samuel C.E. Genomics. 1995; 30: 372-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and pulmonary macrophages (25Rabinovici R. Kabir K. Chen M. Su Y. Zhang D. Luo X. Yang J.H. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Second, IFN-induced enzymes such as dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), 2′,5′-oligo(A) nuclease, and ADAR1 all interact with dsRNA (23Patterson J.B. Thomis D.C. Hans S.L. Samuel C.E. Virology. 1995; 210: 508-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 26Samuel C.E. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 233: 125-145PubMed Google Scholar) either as a substrate or an activator. Third, ADAR1 and ADAR2 can destroy dsRNA or mRNA with dsRNA stretches, indicating that they may indirectly regulate the activity of dsRNA-binding proteins such as PKR. Fourth, a C-to-U editing enzyme has been reported to play a role in the specific immune response by modulating class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation in B-lymphocytes (27Longacre A. Storb U. Cell. 2000; 102: 541-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 28Neuberger M.S. Scott J.

Introduction of the C-to-U editing enzyme triggers hybridoma cells to generate somatic hypermutations in immunoglobulins (32Martin A. Bardwell P.D. Woo C.J. Fan M. Shulman M.J. Scharff M.D. Nature. 2002; 415: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that A-to-I RNA editing by ADAR1 is also involved in both local (25Rabinovici R. Kabir K. Chen M. Su Y. Zhang D. Luo X. Yang J.H. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and systemic (33Yang J.H. Luo X.X. Nie Y.Z. Su Y.J. Zhao Q.C. Kabir K. Zhang D.X. Rabinovici R. Immunology. 2003; 109: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) acute inflammation. In the lung, A-to-I RNA editing is up-regulated following endotoxin stimulation due to up-regulation of ADAR1, which precedes the development of pulmonary edema and leukocyte accumulation. Similarly, editing activity and ADAR1 expression are induced in cultured alveolar macrophages (MH-S cells) stimulated with endotoxin or IFN. In systemic inflammation produced by endotoxin in mice, inosine-containing mRNA is markedly induced to ∼5% of adenosine in total mRNA (33Yang J.H. Luo X.X. Nie Y.Z. Su Y.J. Zhao Q.C. Kabir K. Zhang D.X. Rabinovici R. Immunology. 2003; 109: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This induction results from up-regulation of A-to-I RNA editing, since both dsRNA editing activity and ADAR1 expression are increased in the spleen, thymus, and peripheral lymphocytes of endotoxin-treated mice. Up-regulation of ADAR1 has been confirmed in vitro in T lymphocytes and macrophages stimulated with a variety of inflammatory mediators including tumor necrosis factor-α and IFN-γ. Late induction of RNA editing occurs in ConA-activated splenocytes stimulated with IL-2 in vitro. Taken together, these data suggest that during local and systemic inflammation, ADAR1-mediated RNA editing is increased, which may affect the inflammatory response through modulation of protein production. Acute inflammation is the underlying process of many critical illnesses, including the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, multiple organ failure, sepsis, adult respiratory distress syndrome, and ischemia/reperfusion injury (34Hudson L.D. Steinberg K.P. Chest. 1999; 116: 74-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One fundamental event that occurs in all of these stress situations is the intense production of multiple pro- and anti-inflammatory proteins. Thus, additional insight into the regulation of protein production during inflammation could shed light on the pathogenesis of this condition. It is within this context that we aimed to further examine the role of A-to-I RNA editing in acute inflammation. Specifically, following the identification of ADAR1 as a key player in local and systemic inflammation (25Rabinovici R. Kabir K. Chen M. Su Y. Zhang D. Luo X. Yang J.H. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 33Yang J.H. Luo X.X. Nie Y.Z. Su Y.J. Zhao Q.C. Kabir K. Zhang D.X. Rabinovici R. Immunology. 2003; 109: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), we examined and characterized ADAR1 production, localization, and regulation during acute systemic inflammation in vitro and in vivo. The present study aims to further delineate the A-to-I RNA editing response to acute inflammation, with special emphasis on the generation through alternative splicing of ADAR1 variants with distinct functional domains. In addition, this study investigates the regulation and translocation of the inflammation-induced ADAR1 variants in the cytoplasm, nucleus, and nucleolus. Animal Model of Acute Inflammation—The model used in the present study was described previously in detail (35Kabir K. Gelinas J.P. Chen M. Chen D. Zhang D. Luo X. Yang J.H. Carter D. Rabinovici R. Shock. 2002; 17: 300-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In brief, endotoxin at a dose of 15 mg/kg (LD60) was injected into the peritoneal cavity of conscious adult (6-week-old, 25-g) male C57Bl/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories). The mice were anesthetized (pentobarbital; 30 mg/kg) at various time points, and tissues were harvested and processed for analysis, as described below. The Yale Animal Care and Use Committee approved all animal protocols. Five mice were used per group, and a mixture of five similar organs from these animals was used for each analysis. RNA and Protein Isolation—Total RNA and mRNA at each time point (n = 5) were isolated using Trizol (Trizol, Inc.) and OligoTex (Qiagen) separately for Northern blotting, RT-PCR, and ADAR1 cloning. Total protein was isolated by homogenizing mouse splenic cells in four volumes of an editing buffer (containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol). The lysate was sonicated for 30 s and centrifuged for 30 s at 4,000 × g. Protein concentration in the supernatant was determined using a Bio-Rad protein kit and adjusted to 10 mg/ml for Western blotting or editing analyses. Northern Blotting, RT-PCR, and Western Blot Analysis—Equal amounts (∼2 μg) of mRNA from mouse tissues (n = 5) were used for Northern blotting. ADAR1 was detected by hybridization of the blots with 32P-labeled antisense probes (positions 1305-1265 and 3004-2966; GenBank accession number AF291050). Membranes were hybridized at 65 °C overnight and then subjected to a final wash was with 0.1× SSC at 55 °C for 10 min. For RT-PCR, 2 μg of total RNA were used for reverse transcription primed with poly(dT)12-18. ADAR1 mRNA was determined by RT-PCR using primers that flank exons 6-8 (positions 1975-2003 and 2436-2408; GenBank number AF291050) or the entire coding region (positions 1-24 and 3459-3435; GenBank number AF291050). The relative expression of ADAR1 mRNA was estimated in comparison with GAPDH. For Western blotting, 60 μg of total protein from splenic cells was resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blots were detected using rabbit antiserum against the C-terminal of recombinant mouse ADAR1 expressed in E. coli (positions 2765-3459; GenBank number AF291050) or the N terminus of a synthetic mouse ADAR1 peptide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cloning and Sequencing of ADAR1 Variants—Full-length ADAR1 from mouse splenic cells harvested 24 h after endotoxin stimulation (n = 5) was amplified by RT-PCR. The PCR products were cloned into pCRII (Invitrogen), and the diversity of ADAR1 cDNAs was analyzed by EcoRI digestion. Alternative splice junction sites were mapped by sequencing and analyzed by sequence alignment. Four typical ADAR1 cDNAs with open reading frames, ADAR1Sa (GenBank number AF291875), ADAR1Sb (AF291877), ADAR1La (AF291050), and ADAR1Lb (AF291876), were subcloned for further analysis. In Vitro Translation and Expression of ADAR1 Isoforms in a Baculovirus System—The cDNAs of ADAR1Sa, ADAR1Sb, ADAR1La, or ADAR1Lb in the pCRII vector were translated in vitro using a TNT T7 quick translation system following the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). For recombinant proteins, these variants were subcloned into pFastBac (Invitrogen) in frame with a His tag at the N termini to generate recombinant ADAR1-Bacmids. After transfection of Bacmids into Sf9 insect cells, recombinant ADAR1 isoforms were expressed, and proteins were isolated using nickel columns following the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). RNA Editing Assay Using dsRNA—RNA editing activity was evaluated by measuring A-to-I conversion of synthetic dsRNA (36Yang J.H. Sklar P. Axel R. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4354-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In a typical dsRNA editing assay, 10 μl of cell extracts (100 μg of total protein) or 0.098 μg of recombinant ADAR1 isoforms were mixed with 32P-labeled dsRNA (∼5 × 103 cpm) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The mixture was treated with an equal volume of a proteinase K buffer (containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 0.2% SDS, and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K). The edited dsRNA was extracted with phenol, precipitated in ethanol, resuspended in 10 μl of RNase P1 mixture (containing 5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, and 1 unit of RNase P1), and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. After being developed in saturated (NH4)2SO4-isopropyl alcohol (95:5) solution, the converted inosine was analyzed by TLC and visualized by autoradiography. The radioactivity of each spot was measured by scintillation, and the intensity of each nucleotide on x-ray film was quantitated with ScionImage (available on the World Wide Web at www.scioncorp.com). The specific activity was calculated by dividing the percentage of A-to-I conversion by the amount of protein (μg) used in the reaction, which was normalized to the specific activity of ADARLb. Construction of ADAR1-EGFP Chimera and Localization Analysis—A restriction enzyme site (BamHI) was added at each end of ADAR1 cDNAs (ADAR1Sa, ADAR1Sb, ADAR1La, and ADAR1Lb) by PCR using the pCRII-ADAR1 plasmids as templates. The PCR product was cleaved with BamHI and directly subcloned into the pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech) in frame with the N-terminal of EGFP. Different cells, including mouse fibroblasts (3T3), neuroblastoma cells (N18), monocytes (RAW2.17), or human HeLa and 293 cells, were transfected (n = 3) with pEGFP-ADAR1 DNAs; fluorescence was observed under a microscope 6 h after transfection. Editing activity of the transiently expressed ADAR1-EGFP chimeras was tested in 293 cells and proved able to convert adenosine to inosine on synthetic dsRNA. Electron Microscopy—HeLa cells were fixed in 4 and 8% paraformaldehyde solutions in 0.25 m Hepes (pH 7.4) at 4 °C for 1 h and overnight, respectively. Cells were washed in PBS, scraped, and pelleted in a 10% solution of gelatin in PBS. Pieces of the pellet were infiltrated overnight at 4 °Cina2.3 m sucrose solution in PBS and then mounted on aluminum studs and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen sections were cut on a Leica ultramicrotome at -108 °C. They were collected with a 1:1 mixture of 2.3 m sucrose and 2% methylcellulose solutions, thawed, and transferred onto Formvar- and carbon-coated nickel grids. For immunolabeling, grids were incubated with a solution of 0.1 m NH4Cl in PBS for 10 min, followed by 0.5% fish skin gelatin solution in PBS for 20 min at 22 °C. They were then incubated with anti-C-terminal ADAR1 antibody (1:50) for 30 min, followed by 10-nm protein A-gold complex (Department of Cell Biology, Utrecht University, The Netherlands) also for 30 min at 22 °C. After several washes in PBS, the sections were fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde in PBS, washed in water, and incubated with 1.8% methylcellulose and 0.5% uranyl acetate solution before being air-dried. Sections were examined in a Tecnai 12 Biotwin electron microscope (FEI) at 80 kV. For quantification, 20 random micrographs of nuclei were taken and printed at a final magnification of ×34,000. Labeling densities over the nucleus or nucleolus were calculated by dividing the number of gold particles over these structures by the surface of profiles estimated by point counting using a lattice grid with 20 mm between lines. Two ADAR1 mRNA Transcripts Are Expressed in a Tissue-specific Manner—To determine whether ADAR1 has splice variants and whether its expression is tissue-specific, ADAR1 transcripts in a variety of mouse tissues were analyzed by Northern blotting. An antisense sequence complementary to the dsRNA-binding domain of ADAR1 cDNA from positions 1305-1265 (GenBank number AF291050) was selected as the hybridization probe to reduce the nonspecific signal from mouse ribosomal RNA. Two ADAR1 transcripts measuring ∼7 and 5 kb were detected in all tested tissues (Fig. 1A). The total ADAR1 mRNA level showed tissue-specific differences, with the highest signal in the brain and spleen and the lowest in the liver. The ratio between the 7- and 5-kb transcripts also varied in a tissue-specific manner, with the highest value observed in the spleen and the lowest in the brain. Similar results were noted when antisense probes complementary to the deaminase domain or to full-length ADAR1 were used (data not shown). Multiple ADAR1 Variants Are Induced in Response to Inflammatory Stimulation—Northern blot analysis of splenic tissue from endotoxin-challenged mice demonstrated up-regulation of both the 7- and 5-kb ADAR1 transcripts (Fig. 1B). To characterize the sequence variations, the coding region of ADAR1 cDNA in spleens from sham-injected or endotoxin-stimulated mice was amplified using RT-PCR (Fig. 1C). In sham-injected animals, a dominant (∼20-fold excess) long form (ADAR1L) measuring 3.4 kb and a short form (ADAR1S) of 2.0 kb were identified. In contrast, spleens from endotoxin-challenged mice demonstrated equal levels of ADAR1L and ADAR1S due to a selective induction of ADAR1S. It should be noted that the 1.4-kb difference between ADAR1L and ADAR1S may not reflect the difference between the 7- and 5-kb ADAR1 transcripts observed in Northern blotting (Fig. 1, B and C). In addition, the PCR products of ADAR1L and ADAR1S displayed diverse variants, which slightly differed in size. To identify these variants, RT-PCR products of the ADAR1L fragments from a mixture of spleen and thymus tissues of normal or endotoxin-stimulated mice were recovered and cloned. Diversity of the selected individual clones was analyzed by restriction enzyme mapping (Fig. 1D). In agreement with the sequencing analysis, three fragments (I, II, and III) and a vector were identified. In sham-injected mice, fragment III had three major variations in 14 clones, whereas only a single size was identified for fragments I and II. In stimulated mice, fragments II and III were found to have three and four variants in 16 clones, respectively, whereas fragment I remained unchanged, with a similar size in all clones. As described in the legends to Figs. 1C and 2, variations in fragment I could be detected only when the mapping of ADAR1L and ADAR1S was compared. In conclusion, diverse ADAR1L and ADAR1S variants were generated in response to inflammatory stimulation. ADAR1 cDNA Variants Are Generated through Inflammation-induced Alternative Splicing—ADAR1 cDNA variants were sequenced. Alignment analysis confirmed that all variants were identical at their 5′- or 3′-ends. The difference between ADAR1L and ADAR1S resulted from alternative selection of the 3′ splice site of intron 1, which deleted the entire exon 2, comprising ∼1.4 kb of ADAR1 mRNA (Fig. 2A). Variations in fragment III resulted from alternative splicing of exon 7 and selective usage of a few cryptic 5′ splice sites (Fig. 2B). Three ADAR1 variants with slightly different sizes, termed a-, b-, and c-forms, were generated. The b-form matched the previously identified mouse cDNA sequence (25Rabinovici R. Kabir K. Chen M. Su Y. Zhang D. Luo X. Yang J.H. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and was dominant in sham-injected mice (9 of 14 clones). The a-form, which had an additional 78 bp in exon 7 due to a cryptic 5′ splice site within intron 7, occurred less frequently (3 of 14 clones). A similar insertio"

Young calves and infants are particularly affected and suffer from obstructive bronchitis, wheezing, and hypoxemia. Damage of respiratory epithelial cells due to the infection itself probably plays a minor role in RSV pathogenesis (2Zhang L. Peeples M.E. Boucher R.C. Collins P.L. Pickles R.J. J.

Rather, the inflammatory response triggered by cellular chemokines and cytokines that are released from RSV-infected epithelial cells and lymphocytes is believed to contribute to the severity of the disease (3Olszewska-Pazdrak B.

Several observations indicate that the adaptive immune response to RSV is incomplete and of short duration. Maternally derived virus-neutralizing antibodies do not provide sufficient protection from infection (10Lamprecht C.L. Krause H.E. Mufson M.A. J. Infect. Dis. 1976; 134: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 11Domachowske J.B. Rosenberg H.F. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 12: 298-309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reinfections, even by RSV of the same serogroup, occur repeatedly during childhood and throughout life (12Henderson F.W. Collier A.M. Clyde Jr., W.A. Denny F.W. N. Engl. J.

There is also evidence that infection with HRSV contributes to increased airway hyperresponsiveness and asthma (14Bramley A.M. Vitalis T.Z. Wiggs B.R. Hegele R.G. Eur. Respir.

Recent data suggest that RSV has immunosuppressive properties. In the mouse model, HRSV infection causes suppression of lung CD8+ T-cell effector activity and inhibition of pulmonary CD8+ T-cell memory development (18Chang J. Braciale T.J. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In BRSV-infected lambs, mitogen-induced proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes was found to be reduced (19Keles I.

The envelope glycoprotein F plays an important role in the RSV life cycle. It mediates fusion between the viral and cellular membrane and also has receptor binding activity (23Kahn J.S. Schnell M.J. Buonocore L. Rose J.K. Virology. 1999; 254: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 24Feldman S.A. Audet S. Beeler J.A. J.

Recent work has shown that the F proteins of HRSV and BRSV cause contact inhibition of mitogen-induced T-cell proliferation (26Schlender J. Walliser G. Fricke J. Conzelmann K.K. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1163-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Moreover, the F protein is a major virus antigen that induces neutralizing antibodies in the host (1Collins P.L. McIntosh K. Chanock R.M. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Virology. Lipincott-Raven, New York1996: 1313-1351Google Scholar). The primary sequence of the F protein between different serotypes of HRSV and BRSV is highly conserved but shows only little homology with other paramyxovirus fusion proteins. A property that is also found with other enveloped viruses is the synthesis of the fusion protein as an inactive precursor F0 that has to be proteolytically cleaved to become fusion-active (27Klenk H.D. Garten W. Trends Microbiol. 1994; 2: 39-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). This cleavage occurs at a multibasic amino acid motif (RKRR136↓) proximal to the so-called fusion peptide and is mediated by the ubiquitous endoprotease furin of the trans-Golgi network (28Bolt G. Pedersen L.O. Birkeslund H.H. Virus Res. 2000; 68: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A unique feature of the RSV F proteins is the cleavage of F0 at a second highly conserved furin recognition site (RA(R/K)R109↓) 27 amino acids upstream of the fusion peptide. Cleavage at both sites results in the release of an N-glycosylated peptide, pep27 (Fig. 1A) (29Gonzalez-Reyes L. Ruiz-Arguello M.B. Garcia-Barreno B. Calder L. Lopez J.A. Albar J.P. Skehel J.J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 31642-31650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Recent studies using recombinant BRSV revealed that both the distal furin recognition motif and pep27 are dispensable for virus replication in cell culture (31Zimmer G. Conzelmann K.K. Herrler G. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9218-9224Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We here demonstrate that pep27 is subject to further post-translational modifications and is converted into virokinin, a bioactive peptide of the tachykinin family. Virokinin acts on specific G protein-coupled receptors and shows characteristic tachykinin-like activity such as induction of smooth muscle contraction. The proinflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of tachykinins in general suggest a potential role of virokinin in the pathogenesis of BRSV. Cells and Viruses—Calf kidney cells (PT-11), bovine fetal thymus cells (TEK), bovine fetal lung cells (KLU-R1), bovine fetal trachea cells (KTR-R), and calf esophagus cells (KOP-R) were kindly provided by Roland Riebe (Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute, BFA, Riems, Germany) and propagated in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), nonessential amino acids, and pyruvate. The same medium was used for HEp-2 cells that were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA). Human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE14o) were a gift of Dieter Grünert (University of Vermont, Burlington, VT) and cultured with Ham's F-12/minimal essential medium containing 10% FCS. Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells, baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells, Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1), and African green monkey (Vero) cells were obtained from the DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany), and HeLa cells were from the ATCC. Madin-Darby bovine kidney and Vero cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium with 5% FCS. BHK-21 cells and HeLa cells were cultured with minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% FCS and nonessential amino acids. CHO-K1 cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium containing 5% FCS. Generation, propagation, and titration of recombinant BRSV (strain ATue51908) and its mutant derivatives rBRSV-F(K108N/R109N) and rBRSV-F(Δ106–130) have been previously reported (31Zimmer G. Conzelmann K.K. Herrler G. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9218-9224Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). HRSV (strain Long) was a kind gift of H.-Jürgen Streckert (Ruhr-Universität Bochum, Germany). Peptides and Antibodies—Peptides were prepared by Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid phase synthesis and purified by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography to 95% purity (Biosynthan GmbH, Berlin, Germany). The biotin-labeled tracer used in the competitive ELISA was synthesized by coupling a biotin group via a 6-amino-n-hexanoic acid to the peptide TRNSTKKFYGLM-amide. Substance P, neurokinin A, and neurokinin B (purity ≥96%) were purchased from Calbiochem-Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). For generation of a monospecific anti-virokinin (anti-VK) serum, the peptide CTRNSTKKFYGLM-amide was covalently linked by an N-(α-maleimide)-succimide ester to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Sigma) as carrier protein and used for immunization of rabbits with ABM-ZK (Linaris GmbH, Bettingen, Germany) as adjuvant. The obtained sera were tested by ELISA, immunofluorescence, and Western blot. The rabbit monospecific antibody SP3 directed to substance P has been described previously (32McGregor G.P. Bloom S.R. Life Sci. 1983; 32: 655-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Generation of TACR1, TACR1-GFP, and β-Arrestin 1-GFP Constructs—cDNA was generated from human lung mRNA (Clontech) by reverse transcription using the enzyme from Moloney murine leukemia virus (Expand reverse transcriptase; Roche Applied Science) and random hexanucleotides for priming. The open reading frame of the human TACR1 was amplified by PCR (Expand Long Template PCR System; Roche Applied Science) using the forward primer 5′-TTTTGGTACCGAAATGGATAACGTCCTCCCGGTGGAC-3′ (KpnI restriction site underlined, nucleotides encoding the TACR1 N terminus in boldface type) and the reverse primer 5′-TTTTGGATCCCTAGGAGAGCACATTGGAGGAGAAGC-3′ (BamHI restriction site underlined and nucleotides encoding the TACR1 C terminus in boldface type). The PCR product was treated overnight with BamHI and KpnI, purified, and ligated with pCEP4 plasmid (Invitrogen) to obtain pCEP4-TACR1. For generation of a TACR1-GFP fusion protein, the TACR1 open reading frame without the stop codon was amplified from the recombinant pCEP4 plasmid using the same forward primer as before and the reverse primer (5′-GGCCGGGGATCCCGGGAGAGCACATTGGAGGAGAAGCTGAAGC-3′) (BamHI restriction site underlined, nucleotides encoding the TACR1 C terminus in boldface type). The PCR product was treated with the restriction endonucleases as before, purified, and ligated into the pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech) to obtain pEGFP-N1-TACR1. The β-arrestin 1 open reading frame without the stop codon was amplified from human lung cDNA using the forward primer 5′-GGCCGGAAGCTTGCCACCATGGGCGACAAAGGGACGCGAGTGTT-3′ (HindIII restriction site underlined, nucleotides encoding the β-arrestin 1 N terminus in boldface type) and the reverse primer 5′-GGCCGGCCGCGGTCTGTTGTTGAGCTGTGGAGAGCCGG-3′ (SacII restriction site underlined, nucleotides encoding the β-arrestin 1 C terminus in boldface type). The PCR product was treated with HindIII and SacII overnight and ligated with pEGFP-N1 vector to obtain pEGFP-N1-ARR1. DNA sequencing was performed for all of the three constructs to rule out any amplification errors. Stable Cell Lines and Translocation Assays—CHO-K1 cells were transfected with the pEGFP-N1-TACR1 plasmid and grown in selection medium containing 10% of dialyzed FCS and 1 mg of G418 sulfate/ml for 14 days. Cell clones were isolated by limiting dilution and screened for GFP expression by fluorescence microscopy. Positive clones were recloned once. A HeLa cell line that stably expresses the human TACR1 plasmid was established by transfecting the cells with the pCEP4-TACR1 plasmid. This vector contains elements from the Epstein-Barr virus providing episomal replication of the plasmid in human cells. The cells were selected with medium containing 10% dialyzed FCS and 250 μg of hygromycin B/ml (Roche Applied Science) for 14 days and maintained in medium with half-concentrated hygromycin B. Expression of TACR1 was shown by immunofluorescence using a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed to human TACR1 (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO). Because of the episomal replication of the plasmid, selection of cell clones was not required. Stable expression of human β-arrestin 1 was achieved by transfection of the HeLa-TACR1 cells with the pEGFP-N1-ARR1 plasmid and selection of the cells with G418 sulfate as described above. To induce translocation of GFP-tagged proteins, cells were washed twice with serum-free medium and incubated for 30–60 min at 37 °C with conditioned cell culture supernatant from BRSV- or HRSV-infected Vero cells or with medium containing synthetic peptides. Thereafter, the cells were washed once with PBS and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. Fluorescence microscopy was performed with a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope equipped with a digital video camera (INTAS Focus Imager, Göttingen, Germany). Immunofluorescence—Cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde 40 h after infection with recombinant BRSV and double-stained with the rabbit SP3 antiserum (1:500) and a mouse monoclonal antibody directed to the RSV fusion protein (1:200; Serotec, UK). The primary antibodies were detected with Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit Ig serum (Sigma) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse Ig serum (Amersham Biosciences). For competition analysis, the SP3 antiserum was preincubated with synthetic peptides (10 μg/ml) for 15 min prior to cell staining. Fluorescence was visualized with a Leica confocal laser-scanning microscope. Western Blot Analysis—Vero cells were infected with BRSV at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 and maintained in serum-deficient medium for 3 days at 37 °C. The cell culture supernatant was harvested and subjected to low speed centrifugation (2000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C) to remove detached cells. The clarified supernatant was desalted using Sephadex G25 columns (Amersham Biosciences) and concentrated by lyophilization. The samples were run on a Tricine-SDS 15% polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose by the semidry blotting technique. The membrane was blocked overnight and subsequently incubated with the rabbit monospecific antibody directed to virokinin (1:1000 in PBS), a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin serum (Amersham Biosciences; 1:1000 in PBS), and a streptavidin-peroxidase complex (Amersham Biosciences; 1:2000 in PBS). Finally, the nitrocellulose was incubated for 1 min with a chemiluminescent peroxidase substrate (BM chemiluminescence blotting substrate; Roche Applied Science), and the resulting light emission was detected and documented with a supercooled CCD camera (Chemi-Doc System; Bio-Rad). Competitive ELISA—The rabbit monospecific anti-virokinin serum or preimmune serum that served as a negative control was diluted 1:10,000, bound to protein A-coated microtiter plates (Pierce) overnight, and incubated for 3 h with 25 μl of cell culture supernatant and 25 μl of biotinylated virokinin (10 ng/ml) as tracer. The wells were washed, incubated for 1 h with 50 μl of streptavidin-peroxidase complex (1:1000; Amersham Biosciences), washed, and then incubated for 1 h with 50 μl of 2,2′-azino-di-[3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate (6Casola A. Garofalo R.P. Jamaluddin M. Vlahopoulos S. Brasier A.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5944-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar)] diammonium salt peroxidase substrate (Roche Applied Science). Substrate conversion was photometrically quantified at 405 nm. A calibration curve was assessed using synthetic virokinin in the range of 0.01–100 ng/ml. Four parallel measurements were performed for each sample. Tachykinin Bioassay—Guinea pigs were sacrificed, and strips of the circular muscle were prepared from the stomach (2 × 0.8 cm). The muscle strips were incubated with 50 ml of Krebs solution (117 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 11.5 mm glucose), which was heated to 37 °C and saturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Isometric contractions of the muscles were recorded with strain gauge transducers (FSG-01; Experimetria, Budapest, Hungary), and the signals were analyzed with Chart 3.5.1 (AD Instruments, Australia). Muscle tension was preset to 20 millinewtons. Peptides (final concentration 0.1–1.0 μm) were added after an equilibration period of 1 h. The tachykinin receptor antagonists SR142801 (Sanofi-Synthelabo, Montpellier, France) and CP99,994 (Pfizer, Groton, CT) were incubated with the tissue for 30 min (final concentration 1 μm) before tachykinins were applied. A sequence homology search using the BLAST algorithm revealed that within the C-terminal part of BRSV pep27, there exists a significant homology with preprotachykinins (Fig. 1B). Most significantly, BRSV pep27 contains the motif FYGLM129, which matches the tachykinin signature sequence FXGLM, where X represents an aromatic or branched aliphatic amino acid (33Vanden Broeck J. Torfs H. Poels J. Van Poyer W. Swinnen E. Ferket K. De Loof A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 897: 374-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In addition, the sequences downstream of this motif contain all of the information necessary for the maturation of a tachykinin peptide. The basic motif KKRKRR136 provides a target for endoproteolytic cleavage by prohormone convertases (34Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Brain Res. 1999; 848: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) and subsequent trimming by carboxypeptidases (35Garten W. Klenk H.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1983; 64: 2127-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The glycine residue, Gly130, carboxyl-terminal to the tachykinin motif provides the NH2 group for C-terminal amidation by peptidylglycine α-amidating mono-oxygenase (36Prigge S.T. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Amzel L.M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1236-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In contrast, the N-terminal sequence of the viral peptide bears no significant similarity to mammalian tachykinins (Fig. 1C). On the basis of these observations, we speculated that a novel 20-amino acid peptide with tachykinin-like biological activity is generated and released by BRSV-infected cells. Because of its viral origin, we refer to this putative tachykinin as virokinin. Despite the overall high homology of HRSV and BRSV F proteins, a tachykinin signature sequence is absent from pep27 of HRSV. In order to analyze the C-terminal maturation of BRSV pep27, we took advantage of a recombinant BRSV mutant, in which the distal furin motif has been changed from RAKR109 to RANN109, rendering this site resistant to furin (31Zimmer G. Conzelmann K.K. Herrler G. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9218-9224Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). pep27 of this mutant remains attached to the small subunit F2 and is transported to the cell surface as part of the disulfide-linked F1-F2 complex. Cleavage at the proximal furin motif is not affected and allows any normal processing of the C terminus of pep27. Calf kidney PT-11 cells were infected with either the BRSV cleavage mutant or the parental virus, and the cells were analyzed 2 days after infection by cell surface immunofluorescence using a monospecific antiserum directed to substance P (SP) and a monoclonal antibody directed to the F protein. Cells infected with the parental virus showed expression of the F antigen but were not recognized by the SP antibody (Fig. 2A). In contrast, cells infected with the cleavage mutant strongly reacted with both antibodies. Binding of the SP antibody was abolished when the cells were pretreated with low amounts of trypsin, which results in cleavage at the modified motif RANN109 and in elution of pep27 from the cell surface (30Zimmer G. Budz L. Herrler G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31642-31650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). When the substance P antibody was incubated with the cells in the presence of the peptide KFYGLM-amide, which corresponds to the postulated C terminus of VK, binding of the antibody was inhibited (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the C-terminally elongated peptide KFYGLMG-amide did not interfere with antibody binding. Even the peptide KFYGLM, terminating with the correct amino acid but lacking amidation of the C terminus, had no inhibitory activity. These results indicate that cellular enzymes convert pep27 into a shorter peptide that terminates with the classical tachykinin motif. The presence of this highly conserved sequence in the viral peptide explains cross-reaction with the SP antibody. To determine whether the enzymes responsible for C-terminal maturation of pep27 are expressed in a cell type-specific manner, a variety of cell lines originating from different species and different tissues were infected with the BRSV cleavage mutant and analyzed for reactivity with the SP antibody (Table I). All cell lines were susceptible to infection by BRSV as indicated by cell surface expression of the viral fusion protein. In most cell lines, infection also led to presentation of the tachykinin epitope on the cell surface, indicating that the enzymes required for the maturation of VK have a broad tissue expression profile. However, calf thymus epithelial cells (TEK) and human bronchial epithelial cells were infected but did not react with the SP antibody. Immunoprecipitation analysis of the fusion protein from infected TEK cells showed that the proximal furin consensus sequence of the protein was efficiently processed, whereas the modified distal furin consensus motif was not cleaved (data not shown), suggesting that subsequent steps in the C-terminal maturation of pep27 are impaired in this cell line.Table IGeneration of virokinin in different cell linesCell lineAnti-FAnti-SPHuman bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE14o)+-Human larynx carcinoma cells (HEp-2)++Baby hamster kidney cells (BHK-21)++African green monkey kidney cells (Vero)++Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells (MDBK)++Calf kidney cells (PT-11)++Calf thymus epithelial cells (TEK)+-Calf lung epithelial cells (Klu-R1)++Calf trachea epithelial cells (KTR-R)++Calf oesophagus epithelial cells (KOP-R)++ Open table in a new tab To allow detection of secreted virokinin, a high affinity antibody directed to the mature molecule was generated by immunizing rabbits with the synthetic peptide CTRNSTKKFYGLM-amide coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The antiserum was found to strongly react with cells that had been infected with the BRSV cleavage mutant but not with cells infected with the parental virus (data not shown). The antibody was then used to detect virokinin in the supernatant of BRSV-infected cells by Western blot analysis. Fig. 3A shows that the antibody reacted with synthetic virokinin that migrated as a band of 2.3 kDa (lane a). In the supernatant of BRSV-infected cells, a single band of about 10 kDa was detected (lane b). The higher molecular mass is due to the N-linked oligosaccharide side chain attached to the central asparagine of the peptide (29Gonzalez-Reyes L. Ruiz-Arguello M.B. Garcia-Barreno B. Calder L.

We have recently shown that most of pep27 can be deleted from the BRSV F protein without affecting virus replication in cell culture (31Zimmer G. Conzelmann K.K. Herrler G. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9218-9224Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Supernatant from cells that had been infected with this deletion mutant did not show any reactivity with the VK-specific antibody (lane c). Likewise, the antibody did not react with supernatant from HRSV-infected (lane d) and from noninfected Vero cells (lane e). In addition, virokinin was not secreted by cells that had been infected with the recombinant BRSV cleavage mutant (see above). Rather, the virus particles released into the medium were found to react with the antibody. Under nonreducing conditions, a band of 72 kDa was detected that corresponded to the disulfide-linked F1-F2 complex (data not shown). Under reducing conditions, we observed a 38-kDa band that represent"
https://openalex.org/W1992068020,"Rho-kinase is a serine/threonine protein kinase that regulates cytoskeletal events in cells. The enzyme activity of Rho-kinase is auto-inhibited in the free state but is activated through direct binding to the small GTPase Rho in the GTP-bound form. The crystal structure of the Rho-binding domain (RhoBD) of Rho-kinase has been determined at 1.8-Å resolution by the multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion technique. The structure shows that RhoBD dimerizes to form a parallel coiled-coil with long consecutive α-helices extended to ∼97 Å and suggests that free Rho-kinase can also form a dimer through parallel self-association. At the middle region of the coiled-coil, the polypeptide chains are flexible and display loose “knobs-into-holes” packing of the side chains from both chains. RhoBD residues that have been shown to be critical for Rho-binding are spread in the positively charged C-terminal region. The parallel coiled-coil structure of our Rho-kinase RhoBD in the free form is different from the anti-parallel coiled-coil structure of RhoBD of protein kinase N when complexed with RhoA. Implications derived from these structural studies in relation to the mechanism of Rho-kinase activation will be addressed with previously reported experimental data.

Recently, adducin, which contributes to actin assembly, was found to be phosphorylated by Rho-kinase both in vitro and in vivo (25Fukata Y. Oshiro N. Kinoshita N. Kawano Y. Matsuoka Y. Bennett V.

Moreover, Rho-kinase phosphorylates LIM kinase, which is able to inhibit cofilin, leading to the stabilization of filamentous actin structures (27Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Boku S. Watanabe N. Fujita A.

Rho-kinase is composed of four domains: the N-terminal kinase domain, the long coiled-coil domain encompassing ∼600 amino acid residues, the Rho-binding domain (RhoBD), and the C-terminal PH-like domain (Fig. 1A) (6Matsui T. Amano M. Yamamoto T. Chihara K. Nakafuku M. Ito M. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2208-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). The kinase domain sequence is 72% identical to that of myotonic dystrophy kinase (DMPK) (29Bush E.W. Helmke S.M. Birnbaum R.A. Perryman M.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8480-8490Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Similar domain arrangements have been found in DMPK and in members of the DMPK family such as myotonic dystrophy kinase-related Cdc42-binding kinase (MRCK) (30Tan I. Seow K.T. Lim L. Leung T. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 2767-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and citron kinase (12Madaule P. Eda M. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Matsuoka T. Bito H. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nature. 1998; 394: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). RhoBD of Rho-kinase has been mapped within the C-terminal region of the coiled-coil domain (5Leung T. Manser E. Tan L. Lim L.

Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), mDia (13Watanabe N. Madaule P. Reid T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Kakizuka A. Saito Y. Nakao K. Jockusch B.M. Narumiya S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3044-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar), and citron kinase (12Madaule P. Eda M. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Matsuoka T. Bito H. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nature. 1998; 394: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) are also found in their coiled-coil domains. Several Rho effectors have been reported so far. These may be classified into two or three groups based on homology in their amino acid sequences. Class I includes PKN, rhotekin, and rhophilin, and class II includes Rho-kinase and other coiled-coil-containing proteins (4Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar, 31Fujisawa K. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Saito Y. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23022-23028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Among several Rho effectors, RhoBD from PKN is the only example where the three-dimensional structure has been determined (32Maesaki R. Ihara K. Shimizu T. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Hakoshima T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of PKN RhoBD bound to RhoA (hereafter referred to as the RhoA/PKN complex) revealed the presence of an anti-parallel coiled-coil (ACC finger) structure within PKN RhoBD complexed with RhoA. RhoA-binding modes similar to PKN could be taking place in rhotekin and rhophilin, which possess conserved residues essential for RhoA binding. Amino acid sequence analysis implied that RhoBD of Rho-kinase may be folded into a coiled-coil structure similar to PKN (32Maesaki R. Ihara K. Shimizu T. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Hakoshima T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Generally, coiled-coil sequences in proteins have been thought to facilitate oligomerization of the proteins. Oligomerization of Rho effectors might contribute another level of complexity to effector activation by Rho GTPases. In an effort to further elucidate Rho-binding motifs and complexed oligomerization features of Rho-kinase, we have crystallized and solved the structure of the Rho-binding domain that consists of 69 amino acid residues (hereafter referred to as RhoBD-(69)). We show that RhoBD-(69) in the free state forms long consecutive α-helices dimerized in a parallel coiled-coil. Because RhoBD-(69) is part of the coiled-coil domain of Rho-kinase, our structure suggests a dimer form of Rho-kinase in the free state through parallel self-association in solution. We found that the coiled-coil contains several irregular structural features. In particular, the polypeptide chains of the middle region of the coiled-coil are flexible with poor inter-helical contacts between two chains. The parallel coiled-coil structure of our Rho-kinase RhoBD is different from the anti-parallel coiled-coil structure of PKN RhoBD complexed with RhoA. Implications derived from these structural studies in relation to the mechanism of Rho-kinase activation will be addressed with previously reported biochemical and structural data. Expression, Purification and Crystallization of RhoBD-(69)—The expression, purification, and crystallization of RhoBD-(69) from Rho-kinase were performed as reported previously (33Ihara K. Shimizu T. Maesaki R. Okada K. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Hakoshima T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1042-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). RhoBD-(69) encoding residues 979-1047 of bovine Rho-kinase was expressed as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST) and subsequently purified using a series of three column chromatographic steps that included glutathione-Sepharose, HiTrap S, and HiTrap Q (Amersham Biosciences). For the expression of selenium-Met-substituted protein, this construct was transformed into the methionine auxotrophic Escherichia coli strain B834(DE3)pLysS (Novagen). N-terminal analysis (M492, Applied Biosystems) of the resulting sample revealed the presence of an additional glycine and serine at the N terminus that had originated from the thrombin cleavage site. The protein was verified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (PerSeptive). Overlay Assay—Rho binding activity was confirmed by an overlay assay using 35S-labeled RhoA complexed with guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)-triphosphate (GTPγS) in the same manner as described previously (19Amano M. Chihara K. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Nakamura N. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1997; 275: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). Purified GST-RhoBD-(69) were separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and subsequently probed with labeled RhoA. Labeled bands were visualized by an image analyzer (Fuji). Data Collection, Processing, and Structure Determination—Crystals were directly mounted in a cryoloop from drops and flash frozen in a stream of nitrogen gas at 100 K. All of the data sets were processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK (34Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38565) Google Scholar). The crystals belong to the C2 space group (a = 148.0; b = 26.1; c = 39.6 Å; β = 90.4°) with a V m value (35Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7922) Google Scholar) of 2.36 Å3 Da-1, assuming two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Attempts to find heavy atom derivatives failed due to their high order non-isomorphism. Multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion data using selenium-Met RhoBD-(69) were collected using a macromolecular oriented Weissenberg camera (36Sakabe N. Nucl. Instrum. Methods Phys. Res. A. 1991; 303: 448-463Crossref Scopus (320) Google Scholar) with a cassette radius of 430 mm on large x-ray image plates (Fuji film, 400 × 800 mm) at BL-18B of the Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan). Its diffraction path was filled with helium gas to avoid air scattering. Data were collected at the absorption edge (λ1), peak (λ2), and high (λ3) and low (λ4) energy remote points. Oscillations of ω of 8.0° were used with a speed of 2°/s. The total oscillation ranges were 360° for peak, low remote, and native datasets, and 180° for edge and high remote datasets, respectively. Relatively low completeness in the outer shell might be derived from the experimental setting, irrespective of high mean I/σ values. Selenium positions were identified using the SnB program (37Weeks C.M. Miller R. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1999; 32: 120-124Crossref Scopus (384) Google Scholar), which showed three prominent peaks even though each chain of RhoBD-(69) contains only one Met residue. This has been found to be due to two conformers of one Met residue in the determined structure. Phase calculation and heavy atom refinement using SHARP (38De La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar) resulted in a final overall figure of merit of 0.35 from 30 to 1.8 Å. Solvent flattening using Solomon (39Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar) resulted in an electron density map of good quality in which a nearly complete model could be built. The built model was refined through alternating cycles using the program O (40Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeidgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13010) Google Scholar) and CNS (41Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M.

After several cycles of refinement with REFMAC (42Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13865) Google Scholar) considering TLS treatment, the model finally converged, resulting in a crystallographic R value of 19.3% and a free R value of 23.6% for all of the diffraction data up to 1.8-Å resolution. The choice of the resolution is judged from the completeness in the outer shell (∼70%), although mean I/σ around 1.8 Å is relatively high. The current model contains residues 979-1045 and 979-1044 for each chain including 174 water molecules. A summary of structure determination statistics is given in Table I. There is no residue in the disallowed region in PROCHECK (43Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar).

The RhoA-binding Domain 69 Fragment Binds RhoA-GTPγS—The RhoA-binding regions have previously been shown to correspond to residues 970-1059 in ROKα and 934-1015 in p160ROCK, which corresponds to residues 979-1068 and 964-1045 of Rho-kinase, respectively (5Leung T. Manser E. Tan L. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29051-29054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 31Fujisawa K. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Saito Y. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23022-23028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We found that RhoBD-(69), encompassing residues 979-1047 of Rho-kinase, represents a minimum construct sufficient for Rho-binding. Overlay assays clearly showed that RhoBD-(69) retains the binding ability for RhoA-GTPγS (Fig. 1B). RhoBD-(69) Dimerizes into a Coiled-coil Structure—The current model determined at high resolution (1.8 Å) displays well defined structures for two of the RhoBD-(69) chains, whereas the three C-terminal residues of each chain are unstructured. The RhoBD-(69) chains form two long consecutive α-helices that are wound around each other in a ∼97 Å-long parallel coiled-coil structure (Fig. 2A). The total buried accessible surface area is ∼2900 Å2. This parallel coiled-coil structure is different from the ACC finger structure of the PKN RhoBD domain in the RhoA/PKN complex (Fig. 2B) (32Maesaki R. Ihara K. Shimizu T. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Hakoshima T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In the typical parallel coiled-coils, hydrogen-bonded salt bridges would occur between oppositely charged residues at g and succeeding e′ positions (where prime denotes the other chain). However, in the RhoBD-(69) coiled-coil, only one possible g-to-e′ pair is apparent. Interfaces between the RhoBD-(69) Helices Forming the Parallel Coiled-coil—At the N-terminal region (residues 979-1002) of RhoBD-(69), the inter-helical interactions are similar to those previously observed in leucine zipper and coiled-coil structures encoded by a characteristic seven-residue repeat (abcdefg)n (Figs. 3A and B). In fact, leucines or hydrophobic residues are located at most of the d and a positions in this region. The helices display canonical knobs-into-holes packing in which the side chains of the residues at the a and d positions form successive layers and make contact with four side chains from the opposing helix. The inter-helix distances between two α-helices in this region are comparable to the averaged value (9.6 Å) of typical helix bundles (Fig. 3C). In contrast to closed packing of side chains at the N-terminal region, the middle region (residues 1003-1023) exhibits loose coiled-coil packing. At both ends of this region, Leu-1003 at the a position and Phe-1020 at the d position zip two α-helices by knobs-into-holes packing, whereas this side-chain packing is lost at Leu-1006 (at the d position), Glu-1010(a), Ala-1013(d), and Lys-1017(a) (Figs. 3E and 4). The inter-helix distances reveals an abnormally large value (>12 Å) for the coiled-coil in the middle of this region (Fig. 3C). Ordered solvent molecules are not observed among the helices where Ala-1013 fails to fill the space. Correspondingly, the average B factor (40.5 Å2) in this region is ∼2-fold higher than the overall B-factor (21.9 Å2) (Fig. 3D). Moreover, the buried accessible surface area of the middle region is 2-fold lower than that of the N-terminal region. Generally, hydrophobic residues tend to appear at a and d positions with low accessibility (<30%). In the middle region, however, the accessibility of the residues at these positions is high (>40%) because of the loose packing. Interestingly, sequence alignment of Rho-kinase with its homologs shows an insertion/deletion in the middle region (Fig. 4). At the C-terminal region (residues 1024-1044), tight side-chain packing is again retained, although the inter-helix distances in this region are varied and shorter than the averaged value of typical helix bundles. Two charged residues in this region, Glu-1027 and Lys-1031, occupy rather exceptional d and a positions, respectively. These residues may affect the irregularity of the helix. Notably, the side chains of these residues form a salt bridge within the same chain. The presence of the charged residues at the d and a positions might account for the finding that the MULTICOIL program (49Wolf E. Kim P.S. Berger B. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar) predicted that the C-terminal region (residues 1024-1047) has a low probability to form a coiled-coil structure. Mapping of Mutations—Mutation analysis has identified several residues as being critical for Rho binding (18Leung T. Chen X.Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol.

The Glu-1008 mutation of p160ROCK significantly weakens Rho binding, whereas the Ile-1041 mutation completely abolishes Rho binding (numbering scheme corresponds to Rho-kinase in Fig. 4). Double mutations consisting of Glu-1027+Arg-1028, Lys-1031+Gln-1033, and Asn-1036+Lys-1037 (ROKα) showed a reduction in RhoA binding. These residues are localized at the C-terminal region (Fig. 5A). The electrostatic potential surface of RhoBD-(69) shows that the C-terminal half is positively charged, whereas the N-terminal half is negatively charged (Fig. 5B). In the RhoA/PKN complex, complementary electrostatic potential exists at the PKN-RhoA interface where the positively charged ACC finger domain of PKN makes contact with the negatively charged region of RhoA (32Maesaki R. Ihara K. Shimizu T. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Hakoshima T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Our RhoBD-(69) structure supports the notion that intact Rho-kinase would exist in a dimer form resulting from parallel association through the coiled-coil domain in solution. The structure is consistent with results of gel filtration chromatography that showed a peak, which corresponds to a dimer. 2R. Maesaki, K. Ihara, T. Shimizu, and T. Hakoshima, unpublished result. Evidence for parallel association has been obtained for MRCK from a biochemical experiment that revealed homotropic interactions of each subdomains from the coiled-coil domain (30Tan I. Seow K.T. Lim L. Leung T. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 2767-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Moreover, hydrodynamic studies utilizing the Stokes radius and sedimentation coefficient showed that kinectin exists as a dimer through parallel self-association (50Kumar J. Erickson H.P. Sheetz M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31738-31743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence have suggested oligomerization of each member of the DMPK family including Rho-kinase. Gel filtration and chemical cross-linking experiments have revealed the multimeric nature of ROKα (51Chen X.Q. Tan I. Ng C.H. Hall C. Lim L. Leung T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12680-12688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), DMPK (29Bush E.W. Helmke S.M. Birnbaum R.A. Perryman M.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8480-8490Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and MRCK (30Tan I. Seow K.T. Lim L. Leung T. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 2767-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It is likely that further self-association of the dimer forms of Rho-kinase and its closely related kinases takes place to yield a higher order oligomer such as a tetramer. The RhoA-binding regions of RhoA GTPase effectors such as ROCKs, citron, and kinectin are all found in postulated extended α-helical or coiled-coil domains. It is probable that these RhoBDs form parallel coiled-coils resembling that of RhoBD-(69) from Rho-kinase. It would be interesting to determine whether the binding mode of RhoA to Rho-kinase is similar to that observed in the RhoA/PKN complex (32Maesaki R. Ihara K. Shimizu T. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Hakoshima T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the parallel coiled-coil structure of RhoBD-(69), which is distinct from the PKN ACC finger structure in the RhoA/PKN complex, is formed in an uncomplexed state with RhoA. The helical wheel diagram of RhoBD-(69) reveals that residues occupying each position (a-g) do not coincide with the residues critical for PKN binding in the RhoA/PKN complex (32Maesaki R. Ihara K. Shimizu T. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Hakoshima T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Recently, the structure of p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) that is regulated by Cdc42 or Rac has been solved in the auto-inhibited form (52Lei M. Lu W. Meng W. Parrini M.C. Eck M.J. Mayer B.J. Harrison S.C. Cell. 2000; 102: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). These studies suggest critical roles of the GTPase-binding site in dimerization and the subsequent induction of the auto-inhibitory form. GTPase binding could trigger a series of conformational changes, thus inducing disruption of the PAK1 dimer and resulting in kinase activation. As in the case of PAK1, RhoA of Rho-kinase might induce a structural change of the RhoBD coiled-coil, which may be similar to that of the PKN ACC finger for RhoA binding. We should point out that the flexible middle region in the coiled-coil of RhoBD-(69) corresponds to the turn region between two long α-helices of the PKN ACC finger, implying possible structural changes within this region upon RhoA binding. This induced fit mechanism for Rho-kinase is attractive in accounting for the kinase activation and auto-inhibition. However, further crystallographic investigations of RhoBD complexed with RhoA are required to understand the detailed molecular recognition mechanism of Rho-kinase for Rho. We thank J. Tsukamoto for assistance with the mass spectroscopy and the N-terminal sequencing. We also thank Dr. N. Igarashi, Dr. M. Suzuki, Dr. N. Watanabe, and Dr. N.

Two classes of methionine sulfoxide reductases, called MsrA and MsrB, have been described to reduce the S and the R isomers of the sulfoxide of methionine sulfoxide back to methionine, respectively. Although MsrAs and MsrBs display quite different x-ray structures, they share a similar, new catalytic mechanism that proceeds via the sulfenic acid chemistry and that includes at least three chemical steps with 1) the formation of a sulfenic acid intermediate and the concomitant release of methionine; 2) the formation of an intra-disulfide bond; and 3) the reduction of the disulfide bond by thioredoxin. In the present study, it is shown that for the Neisseria meningitidis MsrA, 1) the rate-limiting step is associated with the reduction of the Cys-51/Cys-198 disulfide MsrA bond by thioredoxin; 2) the formation of the sulfenic acid intermediate is very efficient, thus suggesting catalytic assistance via amino acids of the active site; 3) the rate-determining step in the formation of the Cys-51/Cys-198 disulfide bond is that leading to the formation of the sulfenic intermediate on Cys-51; and 4) the apparent affinity constant for methionine sulfoxide in the methionine sulfoxide reductase step is 80-fold higher than the Km value determined under steady-state conditions.

This post-translation modification can provoke loss of protein function (1Vogt W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 93-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar) and has been implicated in the aging process (for a review, see Ref. 2Schoneich C. Exp. Gerontol. 1999; 34: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Therefore, organisms have developed various defense strategies. One consists of restoring the biological function of the modified MetSO proteins. This is the role of methionine sulfoxide reductases (Msr), which reduce MetSO back to methionine (Met). There exist two classes of Msrs, called MsrA and MsrB. The physiological role of MsrAs has been particularly well illustrated. For instance, mice lacking MsrA show an atypical walking pattern and have a reduced life span (3Moskovitz J. Bar-Noy S. Williams W.M. Requena J. Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although MsrAs from Escherichia coli, Bos taurus, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis and MsrB from Neisseria gonohorreae show quite different three-dimensional x-ray structures and are specific for the S and the R isomers of the sulfoxide of MetSO, respectively, both structural classes of Msrs present a similar, new catalytic mechanism that includes a minimum of three chemical steps (Scheme 1). This is the case for MsrA and MsrB from Neisseria meningitidis (13Olry A. Boschi-Muller S. Marraud M. Sanglier-Cianferani S. Van Dorsselear A. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12016-12022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In the first step, a Michaelis complex is formed between Msr and MetSO that precedes the nucleophilic attack of the catalytic cysteine on the sulfoxide of MetSO. Then, a 1,3-sigmatropic rearrangement of the tetrahedral transition state probably occurs, which leads to formation of a sulfenic acid intermediate with a concomitant release of 1 mol of Met/mol of Msr. In the second step, an intradisulfide bond is formed between the cysteine oxidized under sulfenic acid state and another cysteine. Finally, in the third step, a Michaelis complex is formed between the oxidized Msr and the reduced form of thioredoxin (Trx) that precedes the reduction of the disulfide bond of the Msr by Trx. Such a mechanism is in agreement with the ping-pong mechanism that was recently determined for the MsrA from E. coli (11Boschi-Muller S. Azza S. Branlant G. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2272-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and for the MsrB from N. meningitidis. 2A. Olry, unpublished results. No information is presently available for any of the two classes of Msrs on the nature of the amino acids essential for the catalysis or on the substrate stereo specificities. Such studies require first determining the rates of all the steps implicated in the mechanism to interpret the effects of the amino acid substitutions introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. As mentioned above, a sulfenic acid intermediate is formed in the first step. However, no information is available on the nature of the transition state(s) that leads to the sulfenic acid intermediate and on the efficiency of the reduction of MetSO. Furthermore, we do not know how efficient the formation of the intradisulfide bond is. In addition, finally, no kinetic data are available for the Trx reduction process. In the present study, the rates of the three steps have been investigated for the MsrA from N. meningitidis. To attain these rates, adapted experimental kinetics approaches were used. The data show that the step associated with the Trx reduction process is rate-limiting, whereas the rate of the sulfoxide reduction is very rapid and is rate-determining in the process leading to the formation of the intradisulfide bond. These results are discussed in relation with the three-dimensional structures of MsrAs described so far. Site-directed Mutagenesis, Production, and Purification of Wild-type and Mutant N. meningitidis MsrAs—The E. coli strain used for all N. meningitidis MsrA productions was BE002 (MG1655 msrA::specΩ, msrB::α 3kana), transformed with the plasmidic construction pSKPILBMsrA containing the coding sequence of msrA under the lac promoter (13Olry A.

The BE002 strain was kindly provided by Dr F. Barras. Its use prevented expression of endogenous wild-type MsrA and MsrB from E. coli and thus avoided any contamination of the activity of the N. meningitidis MsrA by the Msrs from E. coli. Site-directed mutageneses were performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Purifications were realized as described previously (13Olry A. Boschi-Muller S. Marraud M.

A Q-Sepharose column was done at 4 °C, and wild-type and mutant proteins were eluted at 80 mm KCl. At this stage, wild-type and mutant MsrAs were pure, as checked by electrophoresis on 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining and by electrospray mass spectrometry analyses. Storage of the enzymes was done as described previously (13Olry A. Boschi-Muller S. Marraud M. Sanglier-Cianferani S. Van Dorsselear A. Branlant G. J. Biol.

Preparation of MsrA and Trx, under Oxidized Disulfide State—MsrA oxidation was achieved by mixing 100 μm MsrA with 100 mm MetSO in buffer A. The MetSO used was dl-Met-R,S-SO, of which only the S isomer is a substrate for MsrA. For Trx, oxidation was achieved by mixing 500 μm Trx with 1 mm DTNB in buffer A. After 10 min of incubation at room temperature, oxidized proteins were passed through an Econo-Pac 10 DG desalting column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with buffer A. Oxidation of both proteins in the disulfide state was checked by titration with DTNB.

The apparatus worked in a pulsed mode. Under the conditions used, a minimum aging time of about 25–40 ms was determined. Equal volumes (57.5 μl) of a solution containing 550 μm MsrA in 50 mm MES, pH 5.5, or buffer A and a solution containing 200 mm MetSO in 50 mm MES, pH 5.5, or buffer A were mixed in the aging loop. The mixture was then allowed to react for 40–500 ms before being mixed with 115 μl of a quenching aqueous solution containing 2% of trifluoroacetic acid. Quenched samples were then collected in a 200-μl loop. For each aging time, four shots were done, and the four corresponding quenched samples were pooled in a volume of 700 μl and then analyzed. To precipitate the protein, 50 μl of 100% trifluoroacetic acid were added to aliquots of 300 μl of the quenched samples. Samples were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min at room temperature. Met quantification in the resulting supernatant was carried out by reverse-phase chromatography as described previously in Ref. 10Boschi-Muller S. Azza S. Sanglier-Cianferani S. Talfournier F.

Met was eluted isocratically after MetSO. The other part of the quenched samples that were not treated with 100% of trifluoroacetic acid was used to 1) determine the protein concentration from the absorbance at 280 nm and 2) quantify the free cysteine content, using 2,2′-dipyridyldisulfide as a thiol probe, in the presence of urea to avoid precipitation of the protein in the cuvette. Progress curves of pyridine-2-thione production were recorded at 343 nm in 1.1 m urea, buffer A. Enzyme concentration was 6.19 μm, and 2,2′-dipyridyldisulfide concentration was 665 μm. The amount of pyridine-2-thione formed was calculated using an extinction coefficient at 343 nm of 8,080 m–1 cm–1. Data were plotted as mol of Met formed per mol of MsrA and as free remaining thiols per mol of MsrA, both as a function of time. The rate of Met formation was determined by fitting the curve to the monoexponential equation (Equation 1) in which a represents the fraction of Met formed per mol of MsrA and k obs represents the rate constant. y=a(1-e-kobst)(Eq. 1) The rate of loss in free thiols was determined by fitting the curve to the monoexponential equation (Equation 2) in which y 0 represents the number of free remaining thiols, a represents the number of oxidized thiols, and k obs represents the rate constant. y=y0+ae-kobst(Eq. 2) Kinetics of the Formation of the Cys-51/Cys-198 MsrA Disulfide Bond in the Absence of Trx by Single Turnover Stopped-flow Experiment— Kinetics of the MsrA fluorescence increase associated with the formation of the Cys-51/Cys-198 disulfide bond were measured at 25 °C on a SX18MV-R stopped-flow apparatus (Applied PhotoPhysics) fitted for fluorescence measurements.

One syringe contained MsrA in buffer A (10 μm, final concentration after mixing), and the other one contained MetSO at various concentrations in buffer A (25 mm to 1 m, final concentration). An average of six runs was recorded for each MetSO concentration. Rate constants, k obs, were obtained by fitting fluorescence traces with the monoexponential equation (Equation 3) in which c represents the end point, a represents the amplitude of the fluorescence increase (<0), and k obs represents the rate constant. y=ae-kobst+c(Eq. 3) Data were fit to Equation 4 using least squares analysis to determine k obs max and K for MetSO.

The excitation wavelength was set at 310 nm, and the emitted light was collected using a 320-nm cutoff filter. One syringe contained the oxidized MsrA in buffer A (25 μm, final concentration), and the other one contained the reduced Trx at various concentrations in buffer A (from 20 to 800 μm, final concentration). An average of six runs was recorded for each concentration of Trx. Rate constants, k obs, were obtained by fitting fluorescence traces with the monoexponential Equation 3 with a > 0. Determination of kcat and Km for Trx under Steady-state Conditions— Kinetic parameters were determined in steady-state conditions with the Trx reductase recycling system (E. coli Trx reductase (4.8 μm), NADPH (1.2 mm), saturating concentration of MetSO (100 mm)) and by varying the concentrations of Trx. Initial rate measurements were carried out at 25 °C in buffer A on a Kontron Uvikon 933 spectrophotometer by following the decrease of the absorbance at 340 nm due to the oxidation of NADPH. Initial rate data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten relationship using least squares analysis to determine k cat and Km for Trx. E. coli Trx1 and Trx reductase were prepared following experimental procedures already published (15Mossner E. Huber-Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 16Mulrooney S.B. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 9: 372-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). MsrA from N. meningitidis possesses two cysteines at position 51 and 198 (13Olry A. Boschi-Muller S. Marraud M. Sanglier-Cianferani S. Van Dorsselear A. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12016-12022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). As mentioned in the Introduction, the catalytic mechanism of the MsrA from N. meningitidis involves three chemical steps: a) the reduction of MetSO, which leads to the formation of a sulfenic acid intermediate on Cys-51 and a concomitant release of 1 mol of Met/mol of enzyme; b) the formation of an intradisulfide bond between Cys-51 and Cys-198; and c) the reduction of the disulfide bond by Trx, which finally liberates MsrA and Trx under reduced and oxidized forms, respectively. To investigate the rates of all these steps thus implied setting up experimental approaches that selectively apprehended each rate. For the formation of the sulfenic acid intermediate, the rate was determined by following that of the Met formation under single turnover conditions, i.e. in the absence of Trx. For the formation of the Cys-51/Cys-198 disulfide bond, two methods were used, also under single turnover conditions. The first one took advantage of the observation that the fluorescence emission intensity of MsrA increased upon going from the reduced to the oxidized disulfide forms. The second one used a specific thiol reagent to follow the rate of the oxidation of Cys-51 and Cys-198, which was shown to occur concomitantly. The third step was apprehended by following the rate of the reduction of the Cys-51/Cys-198 disulfide bond by Trx under single turnover conditions, using as a probe the quenching of the Trx fluorescence intensity upon going from reduced to oxidized forms. Finally, the catalytic constants of MsrA were determined for the MetSO reductase step and the Trx-reducing step as well, under conditions in which the concentrations of the substrates were nearly saturating. Characterization of the Fluorescence Properties of the MsrA and Trx under Reduced and Disulfide Oxidized Forms—MsrA, under reduced form, presented a maximum excitation wavelength at 284 nm and a fluorescence emission maximum at 302 nm with a shoulder around 340 nm (Fig. 1). This suggested a contribution of both tyrosine and tryptophan residues to the fluorescence signal when excitation was set at 284 nm. In MsrA from N. meningitidis, there are 16 tyrosines and 1 tryptophan at position 53. When excitation was done at 295 nm, a fluorescence emission maximum was observed at 340 nm (Fig. 1). This suggested the contribution of only Trp-53 at this excitation wavelength. This was confirmed by the fact that W53F MsrA did not exhibit any fluorescence emission at 340 nm when the excitation was done at 295 nm (spectrum not shown). When excited at 295 nm, oxidized MsrA in the Cys-51/Cys-198 disulfide state also showed a fluorescence emission maximum at 340 nm but with a fluorescence increase of 85% (integrated from 320 to 450 nm) when compared with that of the reduced form (Fig. 1). Inspection of the x-ray structure shows that Trp-53 is situated in an α helix near the catalytic Cys-51 (5Tete-Favier F. Cobessi D. Boschi-Muller S. Azza S. Branlant G. Aubry A. Structure. 2000; 8: 1167-1178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Therefore, the formation of the Cys-51/Cys-198 disulfide bond, which is located near Trp-53, is likely responsible for the increase of the fluorescence emission intensity at 340 nm. As already shown by others, Trx1 from E. coli exhibited a fluorescence emission maximum at 342 nm when excited at 280 nm (17Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1992-1998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two tryptophans are present in the E. coli enzyme at positions 28 and 31, and it was shown that Trp-28 is mainly responsible for the strong quenching of the fluorescence emission intensity observed when Trx is oxidized in the Cys-32/Cys-35 disulfide state (17Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1992-1998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3204-3207Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 19Slaby I. Cerna V. Jeng M.J. Dyson H.J. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3091-3096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, following the rate associated with the formation of the Cys-32/Cys-35 Trx disulfide bond on a stopped-flow apparatus equipped for fluorescence measurements can give information on the nature of the rate-limiting step in the Trx-reducing process provided that the fluorescence signal of the Msr does not interfere. As mentioned above, the reduction of the Cys-51/Cys-198 MsrA bond also leads to a quenching of the fluorescence emission intensity at 340 nm. However, as shown in Fig. 2, when the excitation was done at 295 nm, the contribution of MsrA to the quenching of the fluorescence signal is small when compared with that of Trx. It is even insignificant when the excitation was done at 310 nm and when considering the ratio of the fluorescence emission intensity of both partners, integrated from 320 to 450 nm (Fig. 2). Rate of the Met Formation—A means to determine the rate of the formation of the sulfenic acid intermediate was to attain that of the Met, which is formed concomitantly. To do so, the stopped-flow apparatus was adapted to be used in a quenched-flow mode. At various times of incubation of MsrA with MetSO, in the absence of Trx, the reaction mixture was quenched by mixing it with trifluoroacetic acid. Met was then quantified by reverse-phase chromatography analysis (see “Experimental Procedures” for more details). The study was done at 100 mm MetSO, a concentration that is known to be saturating under steady-state conditions (13Olry A. Boschi-Muller S. Marraud M. Sanglier-Cianferani S. Van Dorsselear A. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12016-12022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). At pH 8, which is the optimum pH determined under steady-state conditions (data not shown), a Met burst was observed with a stoichiometry of 0.9 mol of Met/mol of MsrA. However, the rate of the Met formation was too fast, at least 100 s–1, to be determined with the apparatus adapted for quenched-flow experiments, which gave a minimum aging time around 30 ms. In contrast, at pH 5.5, the curve profile fitted to the monoexponential Equation 1 with a k obs value of 12 ± 1 s–1 and a stoichiometry of 0.9 ± 0.1 mol of Met/mol of MsrA (Fig. 3). Under steady-state conditions, at 200 μm Trx and 100 mm MetSO, k cat values were 7 and 0.6 s–1 at pH 8 and 5.5, respectively. Therefore, the data demonstrated that the rate-limiting step in MsrA occurs after the formation of the sulfenic acid intermediate and is associated with either the Cys-51/Cys-198 disulfide bond formation or the Trx reduction process. Rate of the Formation of Cys-51/Cys-198 MsrA Disulfide Bond—First, the rate of formation of the Cys-51/Cys-198 disulfide bond was determined at 100 mm MetSO in the absence of Trx by following the increase of the MsrA fluorescence emission intensity due to the formation of the Cys-51/Cys-198 disulfide bond. Two pH conditions were investigated. At pH 8 and 5.5, a fast increase of the fluorescence signal was observed. The curves fitted to the monoexponential Equation 3 with k obs values of 144 ± 1 s–1 and 11 ± 1 s–1, respectively (Fig. 4). The k obs value at pH 5.5 is similar to that of the Met formation at the same pH. Therefore, this strongly suggested that the step leading to the formation of Met, and thus of the sulfenic acid intermediate, is rate-determining in the formation of the Cys-51/Cys-198 disulfide bond. In other words, the rate of the nucleophilic attack of Cys-198 on the Cys-51 sulfenic intermediate is limited by that determining the formation of the sulfenic acid intermediate, which as a consequence does not accumulate. Therefore, even if a change in the fluorescence emission intensity of the MsrA occurs upon the formation of the sulfenic acid, this should not interfere with the increase of the fluorescence signal observed upon the formation of the Cys-51/Cys-198 disulfide bond. To confirm this interpretation, C198S MsrA was produced. In this mutated protein, the Cys-51 sulfenic acid intermediate accumulates (13Olry A. Boschi-Muller S. Marraud M. Sanglier-Cianferani S. Van Dorsselear A. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12016-12022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Its formation led to a quenching of the fluorescence signal of Trp-53 (data not shown) in contrast to the increase observed when following the formation of the Cys-51/Cys-198 disulfide bond in wild-type MsrA. Thus, the fact that only an increase of the fluorescence signal was observed in the wild-type enzyme again supports the nonaccumulation of the sulfenic acid intermediate in the wild-type enzyme. The fact that the k obs value at pH 8 is 144 s–1 confirms that the k obs value of the Met formation could not be attainable in the previous quenched-flow experiment with the stopped-flow apparatus. A second approach for determining the rate of the formation of the Cys-51/Cys-198 disulfide bond was to follow the loss of the two free thiol groups. This analysis was done with the samples obtained from the quenched-flow experiments described above. As suggested above, as soon as Cys-51 is oxidized into sulfenic acid form, Cys-198 forms a disulfide bond with Cys-51. Consequently, the enzyme should pass directly from the reduced state form with two free thiols to the oxidized Cys-51/Cys-198 disulfide form with no more free thiols. At pH 5.5 and using 100 mm MetSO, the curve profile fitted to the monoexponential Equation 2, with the loss of two cysteines and a k obs value of 20 ± 2 s–1 (Fig. 3). The fact that the k obs value is in the range of that found for the Met formation again supports a rate-determining step associated with the formation of the sulfenic acid intermediate and the nonaccumulation of the sulfenic acid intermediate. Rate of the Reduction of Cys-51/Cys-198 MsrA Bond by Trx—As already mentioned, the rate of reduction of the Cys-51/Cys-198 MsrA disulfide bond was determined on a stopped-flow apparatus by following selectively the quenching of the fluorescence emission intensity of Trx upon going from the reduced to an oxidized form, i.e. Cys-32/Cys-35 intradisulfide state or MsrA Cys-198/Trx Cys-32 interdisulfide form. Under the experimental conditions used, at pH 8, the concentration of the Cys-51/Cys-198 disulfide MsrA was 25 μm, and the concentration of the reduced Trx was varied from 75 μm to up 800 μm. For each concentration of Trx, a k obs value was determined. At a concentration of 200 μm Trx, a k obs value of 9.5 s–1 was obtained (Fig. 5). This value is in the range of the rate value of 7 s–1 found under steady-state conditions, i.e. 200 μm Trx and 100 mm MetSO, and under conditions in which the process of Trx reduction by thioredoxin reductase and NADPH was shown not to be rate-limiting. These results demonstrated that the rate-limiting step of MsrA is associated with the Trx reduction process. Furthermore, we could conclude that the rate-limiting step is prior to the dissociation of oxidized Trx from reduced MsrA, a step that occurs after the chemical process. In this context, the rate-limiting step can be associated either with the formation of the Michaelis complex between the oxidized MsrA and the reduced Trx or with the chemical processes associated with either the formation of the interdisulfide bond between Cys-198 of the MsrA and Cys-32 of Trx or the nucleophilic attack of Cys-35 of Trx on Cys-32 engaged in an interdisulfide bond with the Cys-198 of MsrA. Although additional experiments are needed, it is probable that the formation of the Cys-32/Cys-35 Trx intradisulfide bond is efficient, similar to what is observed for the formation of the Cys-51/Cys-198 MsrA intradisulfide bond, and therefore is not rate-limiting. The K m Trx and k obs max values cannot be determined with accuracy (Fig. 5). This is because when Trx is in a large excess when compared with MsrA, the fluorescence quenching message measured upon the formation of the oxidized Trx becomes small as compared with the fluorescence message of the remaining reduced Trx and, as a consequence, the quenching signal cannot be measured with great precision. Therefore, only an estimation of the K m Trx and of the k obs max values was made, i.e. 500–900 μm and at least 30 s–1, respectively. The values of Km for Trx and k obs max are much higher than those described so far by our group and other groups, which were determined under steady-state conditions with the Trx reductase recycling system. This apparent discrepancy is probably due to the fact that under the steady-state conditions used, the rate of the Trx reductase process becomes rate-limiting at high concentrations of Trx. Rate of the Met Formation under Saturating MetSO Concentration—The fact that the Trx reduction step is rate-limiting suggested that the Km value for MetSO determined under steady-state conditions was much lower than the apparent affinity constant in the MetSO reductase step. Indeed, having a slow step following a fast catalytic one always lowers the Km value for the substrate. Thus, the concentration of MetSO, i.e. 100 mm, which was used for determining the k obs of the reductase activity, was probably not saturating. This is indeed the case. At pH 8, using the fluorescence signal increase observed upon the formation of the Cys-51/Cys-198 bond, in the absence of Trx, a k obs value of 795 s–1 was observed at 800 mm MetSO. From the curve, an apparent affinity constant value of 740 mm for MetSO with a k obs max value of 1510 s–1 can be estimated (Fig. 6). These values are 80- and 40-fold higher than those determined under steady-state conditions at 200 μm Trx, respectively. As shown above, the rate of the formation of the sulfenic acid intermediate is rate-determining in the process leading to the formation of the Cys-51/Cys-198 disulfide bond. Therefore, the k obs and affinity constant values correspond to those of the MetSO reductase step. In this context, it should be noted that the affinity constant values for the D and the L isomers of MetSO are similar (data not shown) and have to be divided by 2, taking into account the fact that the R isomer of the sulfoxide function of MetSO is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of MsrA (13Olry A. Boschi-Muller S. Marraud M. Sanglier-Cianferani S. Van Dorsselear A. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12016-12022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Conclusion—We have shown that 1) the rate-limiting step of the N. meningitidis MsrA reaction is associated with the thioredoxin reduction process and 2) the formation of the sulfenic acid intermediate is rate-determining within the two-step processes leading to the formation of the intradisulfide Cys-51/Cys-198 intermediate. As already mentioned (11Boschi-Muller S. Azza S. Branlant G. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2272-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), three subclasses of MsrAs exist. The N. meningitidis enzyme, which is the prototype of the first subclass, contains two essential cysteines at positions 51 and 198. The second one, which is represented by E. coli and B. taurus MsrAs, possesses three essential cysteines at positions 51, 198, and 206. In this case, only the Cys-198/Cys-206 disulfide bond was shown to be reduced by Trx (10Boschi-Muller S. Azza S. Sanglier-Cianferani S. Talfournier F. Van Dorsselear A. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35908-35913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In fact, the reduction of the Cys-51/Cys-198 bond probably does not occur because of its nonaccumulation. As soon as the Cys-51/Cys-198 disulfide intermediate is formed, Cys-206, which is located in a flexible region, attacks it and forms the Cys-198/Cys-206 disulfide bond, which is then reduced by Trx. The fact that in C206S E. coli MsrA, the Cys-51/Cys-198 disulfide bond can be reduced by Trx (data not shown) supports our interpretation. The third subclass, which is represented by the Bacillus subtilis MsrA, contains two essential cysteines at positions 51 and 54. Also, in this case, the rate-limiting step is associated with reduction by Trx (data not shown). Under saturating concentrations of MetSO, at pH 8, the rates of formation of the sulfenic acid intermediate and of the Cys-51/Cys-198 disulfide bond are 1510 s–1 and at least 1510 s–1, respectively. Thus, the chemical process that leads to the formation of the sulfenic acid is efficient. Cys-51 is probably activated by the active site, and the electrophilic character of the sulfur atom of the substrate sulfoxide and the rate of the 1,3-sigmatropic rearrangement of the tetrahedral transition state are likely increased via an acid catalyst belonging to the active site, which has been recently shown to be Glu-94 (data not shown). Both activations should favor the efficiency of the reductase process. Also, the rate of formation of the Cys-51/Cys-198 disulfide bond is fast. Therefore, the nucleophilic attack of Cys-198 on sulfenic acid Cys-51 is also efficient. Inspection of the three-dimensional structures of MsrAs solved so far and comparison of the primary structures of MsrAs show that Cys-198 is located in a flexible region with no secondary structural elements (5Tete-Favier F. Cobessi D. Boschi-Muller S. Azza S. Branlant G. Aubry A. Structure. 2000; 8: 1167-1178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The fact that 1) a sulfenic acid is chemically unstable; 2) the Cys-198, as part of a flexible region, can easily approach position 51; and 3) an acidic amino acid likely intervenes to favor the release of the water molecule from the Cys-51 oxidized in the sulfenic acid state can explain why the formation of the Cys-51/Cys-198 disulfide bond is so efficient. Studies are presently underway to characterize all the amino acids of the MsrA from N. meningitidis, which are involved not only in the chemical activation of the three steps but also in the substrate specificities.

Gene amplification of 11q13 and consequent overexpression of cortactin in several human cancers is associated with lymph node metastasis. Overexpression as well as tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin has been reported to enhance cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. Here we report the identification of two alternative splice variants (SV1 and SV2) that affect the cortactin repeats: SV1-cortactin lacks the 6th repeat (exon 11), whereas SV2-cortactin lacks the 5th and 6th repeats (exons 10 and 11). SV-1 cortactin is found co-expressed with wild type (wt)-cortactin in all tissues and cell lines examined, whereas the SV2 isoform is much less abundant. SV1-cortactin binds F-actin and promotes Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization equally well as wt-cortactin, whereas SV2-cortactin shows reduced F-actin binding and polymerization. Alternative splicing of cortactin does not affect its subcellular localization or growth factor-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. However, cells that overexpress SV1- or SV2-cortactin show significantly reduced cell migration when compared with wt-cortactin-overexpressing cells. Thus, in addition to overexpression and tyrosine phosphorylation, alternative splicing of the F-actin binding domain of cortactin is a new mechanism by which cortactin influences cell migration.

Cortactin is one of the major F-actin-binding and cross-linking proteins that regulates cytoskeletal dynamics by activating the Arp2/3 complex (3Weaver A.M. Karginov A.V. Kinley A.W. Weed S.A. Li Y.

Cortactin contains six (and one-half) 37-amino acid repeat domains that mediate F-actin binding; this is mainly mediated by the fourth repeat (5Weed S.A. Karginov A.V. Schafer D.A. Weaver A.M.

Cortactin contains a DDW-Arp2/3 binding site in its N-terminal region that, together with the actin binding domain (ABD), is required for Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization (3Weaver A.M.

Although cortactin promotes Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization, it acts differently from other Arp2/3 activators such as members of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein, which bind monomeric G-actin as opposed to F-actin (7Uruno T.

As a consequence, cortactin inhibits the disassembly of cortical actin by stabilizing Arp2/3-induced F-actin branches (3Weaver A.M. Karginov A.V. Kinley A.W. Weed S.A. Li Y. Parsons J.T. Cooper J.A.

Thus, cortactin functions as a scaffold protein that recruits other proteins to sites of actin polymerization. Human cortactin is encoded by the EMS1 gene on chromosome 11q13 (14Schuuring E.

Overexpression of mouse wt-cortactin in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells leads to increased formation of metastases in bone (22Li Y. Tondravi M. Liu J. Smith E. Haudenschild C.C. Kaczmarek M. Zhan X.

The available evidence, therefore, suggests that increased expression of cortactin, because of 11q13 amplification, promotes tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Cortactin is a major substrate for the Src tyrosine kinase (24Wu H. Reynolds A.B. Kanner S.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol.

In human carcinoma cells, epidermal growth factor (EGF) induces translocation of cortactin from the cytosol to the cortical cytoskeleton, with concomitant tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphorylation of cortactin (26van Damme H.

Tyrosine phosphorylation by Src inhibits the ability of cortactin to cross-link F-actin (10Huang C. Ni Y. Wang T. Gao Y. Haudenschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13911-13915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), and mutation of the tyrosine phosphorylation sites in cortactin inhibits migration (21Huang C. Liu J.

Haudenschild C.C. Kaczmarek M. Zhan X. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6906-6911PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation is a second mechanism by which cortactin may regulate cell motility. In this paper, we report the identification of two alternative splice variants of human cortactin, termed SV1- and SV2-cortactin, which lack the 6th or 5th and 6th repeats in the F-actin binding domain, respectively. We find that both splice variants behave like wt-cortactin with respect to subcellular localization and tyrosine phosphorylation. However, they differ significantly in their ability to induce cell migration, bind and cross-link F-actin, and promote Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization in vitro. We propose that alternative splicing of cortactin represents a new mechanism to modulate actin dynamics and cell migration. Antibodies—The following primary antibodies were used: monoclonal antibody against human cortactin (4F11) obtained from Dr. J. T. Parsons (University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA); polyclonal antibody against cortactin (C001) (28Zhan X. Hu X. Hampton B. Burgess W.H. Friesel F. Maciag T. J. Biol.

Cell Culture and Transfection—The mouse NIH3T3 fibroblast cell line and its derivatives were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin plus 8% newborn bovine serum (NCS) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. All other cell lines were grown in DMEM containing 8% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. COS7 cells were transfected using the DEAE-dextran method (31Zondag G.C. Moolenaar W.H. Gebbink M.F. J.

Medium for cell lines containing the neomycin resistance gene was supplemented with 1.25 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). COS7, NIH3T3, and N1E-115 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection. UMSCC and VU squamous cell carcinoma cell lines were kindly provided by Dr. T. Carey and Dr. M. Hermsen, respectively, and cultured as described previously (33Schuuring E. van Damme H.

RNA Extraction, RT-PCR, and GeneScan Analysis on ABI377—Total RNA was isolated from cell lines or human tissues (obtained from patients with no evidence of malignancies) using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) or by the ureum/lithium chloride method described previously (16Schuuring E. Verhoeven E. Mooi W.J. Michalides R.J. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 355-361PubMed Google Scholar). For cDNA synthesis, 2 μg of total RNA was incubated in buffer G (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 8 mm MgCl2, 30 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol), 2 mm deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 7 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI), 10 units of human placental RNase inhibitor (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden), and 2 μm oligo dT15 primer (Sigma) at 37 °C for 1 h. RT-PCR was performed using cDNA in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mm KCl, 0.06% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 2 mm MgCl2, 1.5 units of TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen), and 6 pmol each of primers p149 FAM (5′-CAGACCCTTAAGGAGAAGG-3′) and p150 FAM (5′-GGACAGCTTCGACACTGGT-3′) (Sigma). PCR was carried out for 33 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 1.30 min, and 72 °C for 2.30 min. Because cortactin-overexpressing cell lines were compared with cell lines with normal cortactin expression levels, PCRs of cDNA of each cell line were performed in three dilutions: 2 μg, 0.4 μg, and 0.08 μg, and the concentration with a product in the linear range of the PCR was used. From that concentration, PCRs were performed in triplicate and subjected to GeneScan analysis on an ABI377. In this way, the relative expression levels were semi-quantitatively measured and calculated using the 377 XL GeneScan Version 2.1 analysis software package (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). To discriminate between splice variants involving the five 111-bp exons in the F-actin binding domain, in parallel, RT-PCR was performed on all samples with p149 FAM and p315 (5′-GGTGTGCAGACAGACAGAC-3′) and with p150 FAM and p573 (5′-CCAGCCAAGGGCACATTTG-3′) (see Fig. 1A). Expression Constructs—The GST-wt-cortactin construct was generated by cloning the NcoI-EcoRI C-terminal fragment of the 1.8-kb EMS1/cortactin cDNA (clone nr:4203; Ref. 33Schuuring E. van Damme H. Schuuring-Scholtes E. Verhoeven E. Michalides R. Geelen E. de Boer C. Brok H. van Buuren V. Kluin P. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1998; 6: 185-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and an in-frame 5′-PCR fragment of cortactin (BamH1 site linked to ATG-NcoI site) into the pRP270 vector (derivative of pGEX-2T). GST-tagged splice variants SV1 and SV2 were generated by replacing the NcoI-HincII fragment of GST-wt-cortactin construct flanking the actin binding repeat domain with the NcoI-HincII fragments of the p149/p150-PCR products representing the SV1 and SV2 transcripts. The GFP- and myc-tagged cortactin constructs were generated by PCR on the different GST constructs using primer A1 containing a KpnI site, myc-epitope, and EcoRI site (5′-CGGGGTACCCATGGAGCAGAAGCTGATCTCCGAGGAGGACCTGGGAATTCCGATGTGGAAAGCTTCAGCAGGCCACGCTGTGTCC-3′) and primer A2 with XbaI-site (5′-GCTCTAGACTACTGCCGCAGCTCCACATA-3′). The fragments were cloned in pEGFP-C3 neo resistant vector (BD Biosciences) by EcoRI-XbaI digestion or into pcDNA-3 neo resistant vector (Invitrogen) by KpnI-XbaI digestion, which includes the myc tag introduced by primer A1. To generate the cortactin-delABD variant, wt constructs were digested with NcoI and BbvII to remove the actin binding domain, filled with nucleotides, and re-ligated. All cloning steps were verified by nucleotide sequence analysis. F-actin Co-sedimentation Assay—COS7 cells were lysed 48 h after transfection in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3OV4, 5 mm NaF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation (13,000 rpm for 10 min), and supernatant aliquots were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to confirm expression. 10 μl of the aliquots were used in the in vitro actin binding assay. F-actin co-sedimentation assays were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO). Briefly, pre-spun aliquots of COS7 cell lysates (100,000 × g for 30 min) or purified proteins (α-actinin or bovine serum albumin) were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 1.5 μm of pure actin filaments. The reaction mixtures were centrifuged at 100,000 × g (high speed) to determine the F-actin binding affinity or at 10,000 × g (low speed) for 90 min (Beckman Airfuge) to evaluate the F-actin cross-linking activity of myc-tagged cortactin proteins. As a control for actin-independent sedimentation, various proteins were also centrifuged under conditions in which F-actin was omitted from the mixture. Sedimented proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by either Coomassie Blue staining or by Western blot analysis using the anti-myc antibody 9E10. F-actin Binding Assay—Binding of the human cortactin variants to F-actin was quantified in a co-sedimentation assay, as described previously (10Huang C. Ni Y. Wang T. Gao Y. Haudenschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13911-13915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The human GST-cortactin variants were expressed in Escherichia coli as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in pGEX-2T plasmid and purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cortactin proteins were purified as GST-fusion proteins as described previously (35Zhan X. Plourde C. Hu X. Friesel R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20221-20224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). F-actin was prepared by incubation of rabbit skeletal-muscle monomeric actin (G-actin, Cytoskeleton) in polymerization buffer containing 5 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.5, 134 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm ATP for at least 4 h at room temperature. For the F-actin binding assay, GST-cortactin proteins (80 nm) were mixed with F-actin at concentrations of 0–8.0 μm in the polymerization buffer and incubated at room temperature for 30 min as described previously for mouse GST-cortactin proteins (4Uruno T. Liu J. Zhang P. Fan Y. Egile C. Li R. Mueller S.C. Zhan X. Nat. Cell. Bio. 2001; 3: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures were centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 30 min, and the amount of cortactin in both supernatant and precipitant were detected by immunoblotting using antibody against cortactin (C001) and quantitated by digital scanning. The amounts were normalized to percentages. To calculate the dissociation constant, K d, the amounts of cortactin splice variants bound to F-actin were fit to a single rectangular hyperbola equation: B = B max C/(K d + C), where B is the bound percentage of cortactin, and C is the F-actin concentration of samples to be tested. F-actin Polymerization Assay—Actin polymerization was monitored by measuring the increase in pyrene fluorescence using an LS50B fluorometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with excitation at 365 nm and emission at 407 nm, as reported previously for mouse GST-cortactin (4Uruno T. Liu J. Zhang P. Fan Y. Egile C. Li R. Mueller S.C. Zhan X. Nat. Cell. Bio. 2001; 3: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Arp2/3 complex was purified from bovine brain using a modified procedure described previously by us (4Uruno T. Liu J. Zhang P. Fan Y. Egile C. Li R. Mueller S.C. Zhan X. Nat. Cell. Bio. 2001; 3: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Actin and pyrene-labeled actin (purchased from Cytoskeleton) were mixed at a ratio of 1:10 in G-actin buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm ATP) and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 2 h to remove preexisting F-actin or oligomeric actin. To analyze actin polymerization, GST-cortactin proteins and/or Arp2/3 complex were added to 200 μl of 1.5 × polymerization buffer (7.5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm EGTA, 0.15 mm CaCl2, 0.75 mm dithiothreitol, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 0.3 mm ATP). Polymerization was initiated by adding 100 μl of 8.0 μm G-actin. The final concentration of G-actin in the polymerization reactions was 2.7 μm. Boyden Chamber Assay—NIH3T3 cells were transfected with cortactin variants in pEGFP-C3 neomycin resistant vector. After selection on 1.25 mg/ml G418, cells with high expression levels of the GFP signal were selected three times by using fluorescence activated cell sorting. Stable transfected cell lines were grown to 70% confluence and subsequently serum-starved overnight in DMEM without NCS. Cell migration was measured in Transwell chambers (Costar Corp., pore size = 8 μm). Filters were coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin (in PBS overnight at 4 °C) and rinsed once with PBS; the lower wells of the chamber were filled with 1% NCS in DMEM. Serum-starved NIH3T3 cells were trypsinized and re-suspended in DMEM/0.05% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin and plated on the upper sides of Transwell filters (3 × 104 cells/well). Cells were allowed to migrate for 6 h in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Non-migratory cells were removed from the top filter surface with a cotton swab. Migrated cells, attached to the bottom surface, were fixed in 3% formaldehyde/PBS for 5 min, permeabilized in methanol for 10 min, stained with crystal violet (0.2%, w/v), and washed once with water. The filters were viewed under bright field optics. To quantitate migration, stained cells were counted in four fields (under 100× magnification) from each of three Transwell filters under each condition. The percentage of cell migration for each cell line was calculated relative to the number of migrated GFP control cells (set at 100%) as the means ± S.D. of three independent experiments. Statistical significance was evaluated with analyses of variance and a least significant difference test using an SPSS program. p < 0.05% was considered statistically significant. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells, transiently transfected with the GFP-cortactin variants, were grown on uncoated glass coverslips. After 24 h of serum starvation, cells were stimulated with 5 μg/ml insulin (Sigma). Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde/PBS for 20 min, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS, and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Cells were stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Images were collected by confocal microscopy (Leica). Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc., Mountain View, CA) was used to process the images. Immunoblot Analysis—COS7 cells were serum-starved overnight and treated 10 min with 40 ng/ml EGF (BD Biosciences). Cells were washed in ice-cold PBS and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3OV4, 5 mm NaF, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin) and were tumbled at 4 °C for 45 min. Cell extracts were pre-cleared by 15-min centrifugation, and protein concentration was determined by using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. For immunoprecipitation, lysates were incubated with antibodies that were cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose beads in a rotator at 4 °C overnight. Immune complexes were washed in lysis buffer and treated as described (36Margolis B. Li N. Koch A. Mohammadi M. Hurwitz D.R. Zilberstein A. Ullrich A. Pawson T. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4375-4380Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Lysates and fractions were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer containing 0.1 m dithiothreitol and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose and stained with Ponceau S, and filters were blocked in TBST buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dried milk for at least 1 h. The filters were probed with primary antibody in blocking buffer for at least 1 h, washed three times in TBST, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in blocking buffer for 30 min. Proteins were visualized by using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cloning and Characterization of Alternative Splice Variants of Human Cortactin—RT-PCR analysis on mRNA from human squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell lines using primers that flank the region encoding the entire actin binding domain (Fig. 1A) revealed at least two products (Fig. 1B): the expected 835-bp wt product and an ∼100-bp smaller product. Sequencing of the PCR products revealed the wt transcript and two alternative splice variants: SV1-cortactin, lacking 111 bp, and SV2-cortactin, lacking 222 bp, which correspond to one and two actin binding repeats (37 amino acids each), respectively. To confirm that both transcripts resulted from alternative splicing, we determined the genomic structure of the human EMS1/cortactin gene. 2A. G. S. H. van Rossum, E. Schuuring-Scholtes, V. van Buuren, P. M. Kluin, and E. Schuuring, unpublished data. The genomic sequence encoding the actin binding domain extends from exon 5 to exon 12 (Fig. 1A), with five exons of 111 bp (exons 6 and 8–11). Sequence analysis showed that SV1-cortactin lacks exon 11, corresponding to the 6th repeat, and that SV2-cortactin lacks exons 10 and 11, corresponding to the 5th and 6th repeats (Fig. 2). In conclusion, we identified two alternative splice variants of human cortactin: SV1-cortactin lacking the 6th repeat and SV2-cortactin lacking the 5th and 6th repeats of the actin binding domain.

https://openalex.org/W2108749216,"Glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL) has a key influence on glutathione homeostasis. It has been proposed that mammalian GCL is regulated by the redox environment, and we show here that cysteine residues in the Drosophila melanogaster GCL modifier subunit (DmGCLM) can form covalent interactions with the catalytic subunit (DmGCLC) and modify its activity. Candidate components of intersubunit disulfides (Cys213, Cys214, and Cys267) were identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight spectroscopy of iodoacetamide-modified DmGCLM as well as examination of the evolutionary conservation of cysteines. Mutation of the 3 cysteine residues allowed DmGCLM to associate with DmGCLC, but inhibited the formation of intersubunit disulfides. This caused a 2-fold reduction in the catalytic efficiency of Drosophila GCL, although activity remained significantly higher than the catalytic subunit alone. The cysteine mutant was also more sensitive to inhibition by glutathione than the unmodified holoenzyme. Notably, human GCLM could substitute for DmGCLM in modification of DmGCLC activity. The role of DmGCLM in vivo was examined by analysis of a Drosophila mutant (l(3)L0580) containing a P-element insertion in Gclm. We found that the P-element is not responsible for the lethal phenotype and separated the recessive lethal mutation from the P-element by recombination. This yielded two fully viable and fertile recombinants bearing the P-element insertion, which Western and Northern blotting indicated is a severely hypomorphic allele of Gclm. Glutathione levels were ∼2-fold lower in the GclmL0580 mutants than in control strains, demonstrating the importance of DmGCLM in the regulation of glutathione homeostasis in vivo.

The intracellular redox environment is of critical importance in cell physiology. It has a major influence on signaling pathways and cell fate in response to stress (1Finkel T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). Glutathione is one of the key influences on the redox state of the cell; and accordingly, intracellular glutathione levels are subject to multilateral regulatory mechanisms (2Dickinson D.A. Forman H.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 3Lu S.C. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1169-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). A major player in the regulation of glutathione homeostasis is glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL), 1The abbreviations used are: GCLglutamate-cysteine ligaseGCLCglutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunitGCLMglutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunitDmDrosophila melanogasterHsHomo sapiensDTTdithiothreitolMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. which catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in de novo synthesis of glutathione from precursor amino acids (4Griffith O.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 922-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). GCL is located in the cytoplasm, and its activity appears to be regulated at several levels by the antioxidant status of the cell. In addition to being subject to transcriptional activation by pro-oxidants (5Griffith O.W. Mulcahy R.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1999; 73: 209-267PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hayes J.D.

Physiol. 2000; 182: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), evidence suggests that the catalytic activity is subject to redox regulation by the reversible formation of disulfide bridges between its two subunits (8Huang C.S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20578-20583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Huang C.S. Chang L.S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19675-19680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, GCL is subject to feedback inhibition by glutathione at concentrations that are physiologically relevant (10Richman P.G. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1422-1426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The complex regulation of GCL activity highlights its pivotal role in controlling cellular glutathione synthesis. glutamate-cysteine ligase glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit Drosophila melanogaster Homo sapiens dithiothreitol matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. GCL is a heterodimer composed of a catalytic subunit (GCLC) and a modifier subunit (GCLM). The presence of GCLM modulates the catalytic properties of GCLC by lowering its sensitivity to inhibition by glutathione and by increasing its affinity for glutamate (8Huang C.S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20578-20583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Huang C.S. Chang L.S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19675-19680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sensitivity of GCLC to inhibition by glutathione is such that it has been proposed that GCLC would function poorly in vivo without the presence of GCLM. The pioneering biochemical studies of Meister and coworkers (9Huang C.S. Chang L.S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19675-19680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the 1990s provided evidence to suggest that GCLM could further enhance the function of GCLC by the formation of intersubunit disulfide bonds. This proposition was based on the observations that treatment of the GCL holoenzyme with dithiothreitol (DTT) lowered its affinity for glutamate and increased its sensitivity to inhibition by the glutathione analog ophthalmic acid. The effects of DTT were dependent on the presence of GCLM. The results prompted the hypothesis that intracellular GCL activity could be increased under conditions that deplete glutathione, where the oxidizing environment within the cell would promote disulfide bond formation within GCL. More recently, the role of intermolecular disulfide linkages in modifying GCL activity was investigated by mutagenesis of cysteine residues in the catalytic subunit (11Tu Z. Anders M.W. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). 8 of the 14 cysteine residues in human GCLC were singly altered to glycine, and the effects on activity and ability to form disulfide linkages were examined. One of the 8 cysteines (Cys553) was shown to be involved in influencing the ability of GCLM to increase the activity of GCLC. The mutant holoenzyme was, however, still able to form a 114-kDa complex when analyzed by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions. This suggests that covalent interactions could still occur between the mutated catalytic subunit and GCLM, indicating that Cys553 may not be the only cysteine involved in GCLC association with GCLM. It is possible that more than one disulfide linkage may form between the subunits. We reasoned that the most straightforward method of investigating the importance of intermolecular disulfide linkages in GCL catalysis would be to target the cysteine residues in the modifier subunit; GCLM has fewer cysteines, and interpretation of data would not be confounded by mutation of cysteine residues with a role in catalysis (12Seelig G.

We have shown previously that GCL from Drosophila melanogaster contains an ∼31-kDa modifier subunit (DmGCLM) that is capable of forming disulfide linkages with the ∼80-kDa catalytic subunit (DmGCLC) in vitro (13Fraser J.A. Saunders R.D.C. McLellan L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1158-1165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The disulfide status of specific cysteines in either DmGCLC or DmGCLM is unknown. In this study, we have investigated the importance of intermolecular disulfide linkages in DmGCL activity and show that the ability to form disulfide bonds impinges on both activity and sensitivity to feedback inhibition by glutathione. We also show that Drosophila Gclm mutants, although viable, have approximately half the levels of glutathione compared with the control strains, demonstrating the importance of DmGCLM in glutathione homeostasis in vivo. Construction of pET20bDmGCLC—To make recombinant DmGCLC with a histidine tag at the C terminus, the open reading frame of the Gclc gene was excised from pETDmGCLC (13Fraser J.A. Saunders R.D.C. McLellan L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1158-1165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and subcloned into the NdeI and XhoI sites of pET20b (Novagen), generating pET20bDmGCLC. A 254-bp fragment from the 3′-end of the open reading frame was amplified from pDmGCS4.3.3 (14Saunders R.D.C. McLellan L.I. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 337-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) by PCR using upstream (5′-GGGAATTCGCCGGCGAGCTAATCACCACG-3′) and down-stream (5′-CCGCTCGAGTTTCTCCTCGCAGCAGCC-3′) oligonucleotides designed to insert an EcoRI site into the 5′-end and an XhoI site into the 3′-end of the fragment and to remove the terminal stop codon. The 254-bp cDNA fragment was subcloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pBluescript SK– and sequenced before it was digested with SgrAI (underlined sequence) and XhoI and used to replace the corresponding SgrAI/XhoI fragment in pET20bDmGCLC. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was used to alter the cysteine residues within DmGCLM and was carried out using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutations were introduced via PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using the DmGCLM open reading frame cloned into pBluescript SK– (13Fraser J.A. Saunders R.D.C. McLellan L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1158-1165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) as a template and pairs of complementary oligonucleotides (Table I). Oligonucleotides were designed to introduce a single nucleotide change resulting in an amino acid substitution from cysteine to serine. Mutations were introduced sequentially. Amplified plasmid DNA was isolated, and the presence of point mutation(s) was determined by sequencing before the mutated open reading frame was subcloned into the NdeI and XhoI sites of pET15b (Novagen) to generate pETDmGCLM plasmids, which were used to express mutant recombinant DmGCLM polypeptides.Table ISequences of oligonucleotides used for mutation of DmGCLM cysteine residuesMutantOligonucleotide sequenceaThe mutated nucleotides are in lowercase letters.Cysteine locationDmGCLM-A5′-CAACCTGTCTACGTcCTGCGTGGTGCCAC-3′Cys213DmGCLM-B5′-CAACCTGTCTACGTGCTcCGTGGTGCCAC-3′Cys214DmGCLM-C5′-GCAGGAGTTcTCCACCGCTCACC-3′Cys224DmGCLM-D5′-GTGCATGTcCGCTCCGGGGCG-3′Cys267DmGCLM-E5′-CCAAACGCCCTCTTcCGAGGATTCC-3′Cys139a The mutated nucleotides are in lowercase letters.

Preparations of the GCL holoenzyme were generated by mixing purified recombinant DmGCLC (with a C-terminal histidine tag) and GCLM polypeptides (each tagged with histidine at the N terminus) and purifying the protein complexes by gel filtration chromatography under the conditions described previously (13Fraser J.A.

Carboxymethylation of Cysteine Residues within DmGCLM—Samples of DmGCLM were diluted to a final concentration of 200 μg/ml with 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 mm EDTA, containing no additives, 5 mm DTT, or 5 mm DTT plus 6 m guanidine HCl. Samples were incubated with 10 mm iodoacetamide for 5 h in the dark at room temperature and were subsequently dialyzed overnight in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 mm EDTA in the dark (16Kim S.O.

The dialyzed samples were digested with trypsin and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectroscopy as described (17Walsh E.P. Lamont D.J.

Lamont at the “FingerPrints” Proteomics Facility, Post-Genomics and Molecular Interactions Centre, School of Life Sciences, University of Dundee. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Samples of mutant and unmodified DmGCLM polypeptides (1 mg/ml) for CD analyses were dialyzed overnight in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and degassed by bubbling N2 through the samples. The CD analyses were carried out using the CONTIN procedure (18Provencher S.W. Glockner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar) by Dr. Sharon Kelly at the Circular Dichroism Facility of the University of Glasgow (Glasgow, United Kingdom). Analysis of GCL Activity—GCL activity was determined at 25 °C spectrophotometrically (13Fraser J.A. Saunders R.D.C. McLellan L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1158-1165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) using l-α-aminobutyric acid as a substrate instead of l-cysteine and adapted for use on 96-well plates. Reaction mixtures (0.21 ml) contained 5 mm l-glutamate, 50 mm l-α-aminobutyric acid, 2.4 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.24 mm NADH, 1 unit of lactic dehydrogenase, and 1 unit of pyruvate kinase. The reaction was initiated by the addition of ATP to a final concentration of 5 mm. l-Glutamate concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 16 mm were used to determine the Km and Vmax values from initial reaction rates. Michaelis-Menten parameters were fitted via a Hanes plot using hyperbolic regression analysis software (19Easterby J.S. Hyper, Version 1.1s. University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom1996Google Scholar). For inhibition studies with glutathione, reduced glutathione was included in the standard reaction mixture at concentrations between 0.25 and 16 mm. Western Blot Analysis—Western blotting was performed using antiserum raised against recombinant DmGCLM, DmGCLC, or HsGCLM as described previously (13Fraser J.A. Saunders R.D.C. McLellan L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1158-1165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 15Tipnis S.R. Blake D.G. Shepherd A.G. McLellan L.I. Biochem.

For analysis of DmGCL content in flies, 10 male flies were homogenized in 150 μl of sample loading buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% (w/v) SDS, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 3.6 m 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue) and incubated at 100 °C for 5 min before being subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Glutathione Determination—The total glutathione content of whole flies was determined by a modification of the glutathione reductase/5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) recycling assay described by Tietze (20Tietze F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 502-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (5556) Google Scholar) and adapted for use on a 96-well plate. Routinely, 10 male flies were manually homogenized in 100 μl of ice-cold 10% (w/v) sulfosalicylic acid. Reaction mixtures (0.15 ml) contained 1 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and 0.34 mm NADPH in 150 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 7.5 mm EDTA. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.1 unit of glutathione reductase (Sigma). Glutathione concentrations were determined from a standard curve generated from known concentrations of glutathione prepared in 10% (w/v) sulfosalicylic acid and are expressed as picomoles of glutathione/fly. To determine whether glutathione levels differed significantly by genotype, we used a one-way analysis of variance with post hoc analyses carried out using Scheffe's test and the SPSS statistical software package. Values were considered to be significantly different from each other when p < 0.05. Drosophila Procedures—Flies were maintained on a standard oatmeal medium. We obtained the P-element insertion stock l(3)L0580 from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center. This stock is reported to bear a recessive lethal mutation insertion of a P{lacW}-element (21Spradling A.C. Stern D. Beaton A. Rhem E.J. Laverty T. Mozden N. Misra S. Rubin G.M. Genetics. 1999; 153: 135-177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) within the 5′-untranslated region of Gclm. The location of the P-element was confirmed by PCR and sequencing. The recessive lethal present on the l(3)L0580 chromosome was removed by recombination with an e4 wo1 ro1 stock obtained from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center. Recombinant progeny bearing the L0580 P-element insertion (marked with w+) and either e4 or ro1 were selected and tested for recessive lethality. Approximately 50% of the recombinants of each class were homozygous viable. We did not map the location of the lethal mutation. Viable stocks bearing the L0580 P-element and marked with either e4 or ro1 were established. We have named the L0580 P-element insertion GclmL0580 to indicate its identity as a mutant allele of Gclm. Revertants were obtained from the e4 GclmL0580 stock by crossing to a stock bearing a third chromosome insertion of the P{ry+Δ2-3}-element, which produces constitutively active P-transposase. Revertants were selected on the basis of loss of eye pigmentation, associated with loss of the w+-bearing P-element. We confirmed the loss of the element by PCR. No apparent aberrations were seen. The level of DmGCLM in the revertant stock was estimated by Western blotting. Multiple Sequence Alignment—Multiple sequence alignments were performed using the Genetics Computer Group Pileup software. Mutation of All 5 Cysteines within DmGCLM Inhibits Interaction with DmGCLC—DmGCLM contains 5 cysteine residues at positions 139, 213, 214, 224, and 269, which were named E, A, B, C, and D, respectively (Table II). To investigate the role of intersubunit disulfide linkages in the regulation of DmGCL activity, we performed site-directed mutagenesis on the modifier subunit to generate a polypeptide that entirely lacks cysteine (DmGCLM-FM). Purified recombinant DmGCLM-FM appeared as a single polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of ∼35 kDa when analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). Its mobility is slower than that of wild-type DmGCLM (Fig. 1), which has an apparent molecular mass of 31 kDa (13Fraser J.A. Saunders R.D.C. McLellan L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1158-1165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The reason for the difference in electrophoretic motility is unknown, but it suggests that DmGCLM-FM may have a less compact structure than the wild-type protein. The secondary structures of the polypeptides were examined by CD spectroscopy over the absorbance range 260 to 320 nm. The CD analyses did not, however, reveal any significant differences between DmGCLM-FM and the unmodified DmGCLM polypeptide (data not shown). The predicted composition of α-helices and β-sheets in DmGCLM is 6 ± 1.3 and 61 ± 1.45%, respectively, similar to that of DmGCLM-FM (7 ± 1.5 and 62 ± 1.6%, respectively).Table IICysteine-containing tryptic fragments of DmGCLM Open table in a new tab Regulation of mammalian GCLC activity by GCLM is thought to involve, at least in part, the transient formation of reversible covalent interactions promoting conformational change(s) around the active site of GCLC (9Huang C.S. Chang L.S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19675-19680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the role of these interactions in DmGCL regulation, we attempted to generate a DmGCL holoenzyme using DmGCLC and DmGCLM-FM. DmGCLM-FM was mixed with DmGCLC, and the mixture was subjected to gel filtration chromatography. When the wild-type DmGCLC/DmGCLM mixture was resolved, two peaks were identified corresponding to the holoenzyme complex (∼140 kDa) and uncomplexed DmGCLM (∼30 kDa) (Fig. 2) (13Fraser J.A. Saunders R.D.C. McLellan L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1158-1165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, when the DmGCLC/DmGCLM-FM mixture was resolved, a major peak corresponding to the ∼140-kDa complex was not observed, and the profile obtained was more akin to that of uncomplexed DmGCLC (∼80 kDa) and DmGCLM (∼30 kDa) (Fig. 2). This was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis of the peak fractions obtained from the DmGCLC/DmGCLM-FM profile, which showed that DmGCLM did not co-elute with DmGCLC in the ∼80-kDa peak (data not shown). A small shoulder on the leading edge of the 80-kDa peak was observed and found to contain a trace of DmGCLM. Analyses of these fractions for GCL activity did not demonstrate an enhancement of activity compared with the catalytic subunit alone (data not shown). These findings suggest that mutation of all of the cysteine residues in DmGCLM substantially impairs its ability to interact with DmGCLC. Redox Status of Cysteine Residues in DmGCLM—The disulfide status of cysteine residues in DmGCLM was analyzed by peptide mass fingerprinting. Recombinant DmGCLM was treated with iodoacetamide under native, reducing, or reducing and denaturing conditions. Tryptic digests of iodoacetamide-treated DmGCLM were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The iodoacetamide-modified cysteine-containing polypeptide fragments are shown in Table II. In native DmG-CLM, the fragment containing Cys139 (residues 137–147) and the fragment containing Cys213, Cys214, and Cys224 (residues 177–260) were both singly modified by iodoacetamide (data not shown). In the reduced sample, a further iodoacetamide modification was identified in the fragment containing Cys213, Cys214, and Cys224, whereas under denaturing and reducing conditions, all 3 cysteine residues within this fragment were modified. We were unable to identify the fragment containing Cys267 (residues 267–268) due to its being small and poorly retained on the high pressure liquid chromatography column. Nevertheless, MALDI-TOF analysis implicated Cys267 as being involved in disulfide formation, as peaks corresponding to mixed disulfides between Cys267 and Cys139 and between Cys267 and Cys213, Cys214, or Cys224 were identified when the non-reduced iodoacetamide-treated samples were analyzed. These peaks were absent in samples treated with DTT. It is important to note that, in the absence of DmGCLC and glutathione or DTT, purified recombinant DmGCLM was predominantly multimeric (data not shown). This suggests that some of the disulfide bonds that become reduced upon DTT treatment and subsequently modified by iodoacetamide are likely to be intermolecular disulfides rather than intramolecular disulfides. It is unclear whether this has biological significance, but it is possible that multimerization may occur as a result of the artificial environment of the E. coli expression system, in which reactive cysteines could readily form intermolecular disulfide bonds giving rise to homodimers or trimers. We reasoned that cysteine residues involved in forming intermolecular disulfide bonds in the absence of DmGCLC are potential candidates for forming disulfide bridges with DmGCLC in the holoenzyme. Our findings from the proteomic analyses indicate that two cysteines on the surface of DmGCLM are predominantly in a reduced state and can be modified by iodoacetamide, two surface cysteines are involved in formation of disulfide bonds, and one cysteine is inaccessible to iodoacetamide without denaturation of the protein. The MALDI-TOF analyses suggest that Cys139 is principally (but not entirely) present as a free thiol on the surface of DmGCLM and that Cys267 can participate in disulfide bridge formation with other cysteines. Tryptic fragment 177–260 appears to contain one free thiol, one cysteine as part of a disulfide, and one cysteine that is buried within the native protein. A caveat to our interpretation is that the vicinal cysteines may not be amenable to simultaneous modification by iodoacetamide in the nondenatured protein. Disulfide shuffling may also occur. Due to the positions of the tryptic cleavage sites, we were unable to dissect this further, and we used a bioinformatics approach to gain additional insight into which of the cysteine residues in tryptic fragment 177–260 could be involved in disulfide formation with DmGCLC. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of DmGCLM, Hs-GCLM, and hypothetical GCLM polypeptides from Caenorhabditis elegans (GenBank™/EBI accession number NP_491305), Xenopus laevis (accession number AAH44107), and Danio rerio (accession number AAH44532) showed that both Cys213 and Cys214 are conserved in representatives from mammals, amphibians, fish, arthropods, and nematodes (Fig. 3). A partial sequence of an expressed sequence tag encoding a hypothetical GCLM cDNA from Gallus gallus (accession number AJ447023) also contained the conserved Cys213 and Cys214 residues (data not shown). The only putative GCLM sequence that we found that does not contain both of the conserved cysteines was from Schizosaccharomyces pombe (accession number NP_588368), in which only Cys214 is conserved (Fig. 3). Assuming that the sole function of GCLM is to regulate GCLC activity and that intermolecular disulfide bridges are involved in the regulation of activity in vivo, the evolutionary conservation of cysteine residues infers a possible role for Cys213 and/or Cys214 (rather than Cys224) in the regulation of DmGCLC activity. We went on to generate a mutant form of DmGCLM lacking Cys213, Cys214, and Cys267 (named DmGCLM-ABD). We also generated the converse mutant lacking Cys139 and Cys224 (named DmGCLM-CE) and investigated the ability of both mutants to form the 140-kDa holoenzyme complex. Mutation of Cys213, Cys214, and Cys267 Impairs Intermolecular Disulfide Bridge Formation within DmGCL—Purified recombinant DmGCLM-ABD appeared as single polypeptide with an approximate molecular mass of 31 kDa when analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4). This is in agreement with the molecular mass obtained for wild-type DmGCLM. Purified recombinant DmGCLM-CE also appeared as a single polypeptide, although the estimated molecular mass of ∼34 kDa (Fig. 4, lane 3) is similar to that found for DmGCLM-FM. Interestingly, DmGCLM containing a single mutation at Cys224 also exhibited retarded motility (data not shown). This was not observed in DmGCLM with a single mutation at Cys139, implicating Cys224 in this effect. DmGCLM-ABD and DmGCLM-CE were each mixed separately with DmGCLC, and the mixtures were resolved by gel filtration chromatography. The profiles obtained following separation of DmGCLC/DmGCLM-ABD and DmGCLC/DmGCLM-CE were identical to that of the wild-type DmGCLC/DmGCLM mixture (data not shown), suggesting that mutation of Cys139 and Cys224 together or Cys267, Cys213, and Cys214 together has little or no impact on the ability of DmGCLM to associate with DmGCLC to form an ∼140-kDa complex. This was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis, which showed that the ∼140-kDa complexes obtained following gel filtration contained both DmGCLC and the mutant forms of DmGCLM (data not shown). To explore the role of cysteine residues within DmGCLM in disulfide interactions, we investigated the ability of mutant DmGCLM to form the 140-kDa complex with DmGCLC under non-reducing conditions.

A defining feature of stimuli that induce NFAT nuclear accumulation/activation is a sustained increase in global intracellular Ca2+.

In the absence of a Ca2+-elevating stimulus, NFAT is a transcriptionally inactive cytosolic phosphoprotein. Elevation of intracellular Ca2+, produced by a variety of mechanisms, activates the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase, calcineurin, which dephosphorylates NFAT on multiple N-terminal serine residues. Dephosphorylation results in a conformational change in the NFAT molecule that exposes nuclear localization signals (9Okamura H. Aramburu J. Garcia-Rodriguez C. Viola J.P. Raghavan A. Tahiliani M.

Calcineurin also plays a role in promoting nuclear retention of NFAT by masking nuclear export signals (NES) recognized by the exportin protein, Crm-1, which has been shown to mediate NES-dependent NFAT nuclear export (10Gomez del Arco P.

JNK1 has been shown to target the NFATc1 isoform, phosphorylating the PxIxIT docking site required for NFAT interaction with calcineurin, resulting in a disruption of calcineurin binding and inhibition of NFAT nuclear import (15Chow C.W. Dong C. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5227-5234Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This site is conserved in the NFATc2 isoform but not in the NFATc3 or NFATc4 isoforms. A second more distal target of JNK1, which may also contribute to the inhibitory effect of JNK1 on NFAT nuclear import, is conserved in all NFAT isoforms. JNK2 also targets NFAT but acts in the nucleus to promote NFAT export. Using exogenously expressed proteins in the Jurkat T-cell line, JNK2 was shown to selectively promote the nuclear export of NFATc3 through phosphorylation of serines 163 and 165 in the conserved regulatory domain (16Chow C.W. Rincon M. Cavanagh J. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 278: 1638-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Early studies using cells of the immune system suggested that a sustained, graded increase in global intracellular Ca2+ is both necessary and sufficient to induce NFAT nuclear accumulation, whereas transient Ca2+ pulses are not (17Timmerman L.A. Clipstone N.A. Ho S.N. Northrop J.P. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 837-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 18Dolmetsch R.E. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Healy J.I.

However, recent work in hippocampal neurons demonstrates that a transient depolarization-induced increase in intracellular Ca2+ induced by depolarization with potassium (K+) is capable of inducing sustained NFAT activation (20Graef I.A. Mermelstein P.G. Stankunas K. Neilson J.R. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1999; 401: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that a chronic increase in intracellular Ca2+ induced by sustained depolarization with elevated potassium (HK) is insufficient to induce NFAT nuclear accumulation in smooth muscle (1Stevenson A.S.

Hill-Eubanks D.C. Nelson M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37756-37764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These data highlight possible tissue-dependent Ca2+ signal requirements for NFAT activation and suggest that additional mechanisms that regulate NFAT nuclear accumulation may be more prominent in some tissues than in others. We have previously shown that vasoconstrictors such as uridine triphosphate (UTP), which elevate intracellular Ca2+ and engage multiple intracellular signaling pathways, induce a robust increase in NFATc3 nuclear accumulation in cerebral arterial smooth muscle (2Gomez M.F. Stevenson A.S. Bonev A.D. Hill-Eubanks D.C. Nelson M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37756-37764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The resulting nuclear NFATc3 accumulation was shown to depend on inositol trisphosphate receptor-mediated release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, extracellular Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, and calcineurin activity (2Gomez M.F. Stevenson A.S. Bonev A.D. Hill-Eubanks D.C. Nelson M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37756-37764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Here we show that the nuclear export of NFATc3 following UTP-induced nuclear accumulation is dramatically slowed in arterial smooth muscle from animals deficient for JNK2 (JNK2–/–). Using cerebral arteries from wild-type animals, we further show that UTP suppresses JNK activity and demonstrate that depolarizing stimuli that normally fail to induce NFATc3 nuclear accumulation induce robust nuclear accumulation in the absence of Crm-1-dependent or JNK2-mediated nuclear export processes. Taken together, these results indicate that both intracellular Ca2+ elevation and suppression of NFAT nuclear export activity are required to induce NFATc3 nuclear accumulation in smooth muscle; neither stimulus alone is sufficient. Tissue Samples—Adult JNK1–/–, JNK2–/–, C57BL/6, and CD1 mice (20–25 g) were used. JNK1–/– and JNK2–/– mice were kindly provided by Dr. Mercedes Rincon and have been described previously (21Dong C.

Flavell R.A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). C57BL/6 and CD1 mice were from Charles River Laboratories. Animals were euthanized by peritoneal injection of pentobarbital solution (200 mg/kg). The brain was removed and placed into ice-cold physiological saline solution (containing, in mmol/liter: NaCl, 135; KCl, 5.9; MgCl2, 1.2; Hepes, 11.6; glucose, 11.5; pH 7.4). Cerebral arteries were removed and cleaned of connective tissue. Immunofluorescence—All experiments were performed at room temperature. Arteries were treated with various agents and times, as specified in the text, and then mounted onto glass slides. The arteries were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton-X-100 in PBS for 10 min, and blocked for 2 h with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. Primary antibodies, rabbit anti-NFATc3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; diluted 1:250 in 2% BSA/PBS) and phosphospecific rabbit anti-JNK1 and JNK2 (pTpY183/185) (BIOSOURCE International, diluted 1:500 in 2% BSA/PBS), were applied overnight at 4 °C. Secondary antibody, Cy5-anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories; 1:500 dilution), was applied for 1 h at room temperature. For identification of nuclei, the fluorescent nucleic acid dyes YOYO-1 or SYTOX Green (Molecular Probes, 1:30,000 and 1:3000 dilution, and for NFATc3 and JNK experiments, respectively) were used. After washing, the vessels were mounted (Aqua Polymount mounting medium, Polysciences) and examined at ×40 magnification using a Bio-Rad 1000 laser scanning confocal microscope. NFATc3 and P-JNK were detected by monitoring Cy5 fluorescence using an excitation wavelength of 650 nm and an emission wavelength of 670 nm. Specificity of immune staining was confirmed by the absence of fluorescence in arteries incubated with primary or secondary antibodies alone. For scoring of NFATc3-positive nuclei, multiple fields for each vessel were imaged and counted by two independent observers under double-blind conditions. For quantification, a cell was considered positive if co-localization (yellow) was observed in the nucleus, whereas a cell was considered negative if no co-localization (green only) was visualized. For P-JNK quantification, grayscale images acquired in proprietary Bio-Rad format were imported into MetaMorph image analysis software (Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA). Segmented region areas, 40 × 40 pixel dimension, were applied to five randomly selected areas within the smooth muscle layer of each artery. A threshold encompassing an intensity range of 50–255 grayscale values was applied to the segmented regions of interest, and the integrated pixel values within the areas were measured using the software's Integrated Morphometry Analysis module. Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as means ± S.E., where applicable. All statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad software (Prism 3.0). Statistical significance was determined using one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni or Tukey-Kramer tests (for comparisons between ≤5 groups and ≥6 groups, respectively). Chemicals—All drugs and chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Depolarization-induced NFATc3 Nuclear Accumulation in Cerebral Arteries from JNK2-deficient Animals—We have previously shown that UTP and other Gq-coupled vasoconstrictors are effective stimuli for NFATc3 nuclear accumulation in cerebral artery smooth muscle (2Gomez M.F.

Chem. 2002; 277: 37756-37764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and platelet-derived growth factor is a potent stimulus for NFATc3 nuclear accumulation in ileal smooth muscle (1Stevenson A.S. Gomez M.F. Hill-Eubanks D.C. Nelson M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15018-15024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, depolarization with 60 mm K+ (HK), which increases intracellular Ca2+ levels in smooth muscle, fails to induce a corresponding increase in NFATc3 nuclear localization in either of these smooth muscle tissues (1Stevenson A.S. Gomez M.F. Hill-Eubanks D.C. Nelson M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15018-15024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 2Gomez M.F. Stevenson A.S. Bonev A.D. Hill-Eubanks D.C. Nelson M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37756-37764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These results were somewhat unexpected given that sustained increases in intracellular Ca2+ are sufficient to induce NFAT nuclear accumulation in non-excitable cells, and elevations in intracellular Ca2+ induced by depolarizing pulses of HK have been shown to effectively induce NFAT nuclear accumulation in hippocampal neurons (20Graef I.A. Mermelstein P.G. Stankunas K. Neilson J.R. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1999; 401: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Given that NFAT nuclear accumulation is the outcome of a dynamic balance between phosphatase and kinase activity, we hypothesized that both HK and UTP generate Ca2+ signals that are sufficient to activate calcineurin but differentially affect pathways that act to oppose calcineurin-induced NFATc3 nuclear accumulation. We focused on the JNK2 pathway since experiments in cultured T-cells have shown that JNK2 selectively promotes the nuclear export of the NFATc3 isoform (16Chow C.W. Rincon M. Cavanagh J. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 278: 1638-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). In these experiments, intact cerebral arteries from JNK2–/– mice were treated with 60 mm K+ for 30 min, followed by immunostaining for NFATc3. In sharp contrast to the results obtained in wild-type animals, depolarization with K+ induces a robust nuclear accumulation of NFATc3 in arterial smooth muscle cells of JNK2–/– mice (Fig. 1, A and B), resulting in levels of nuclear NFATc3 comparable with those observed in UTP-treated wild-type arteries. Neither basal nor UTP-induced NFATc3 nuclear localization are significantly affected by JNK2 deficiency (Fig. 1, C and D; see “Discussion”). Regulation of NFATc3 Export by JNK2—Fig. 1 indicates that the absence of JNK2 is permissive for HK-induced NFATc3 nuclear accumulation in smooth muscle. To establish whether JNK2 is acting to enhance NFATc3 nuclear export or inhibit its import, the rate of NFATc3 appearance in, and disappearance from, the nucleus were determined in cerebral artery smooth muscle cells from wild-type and JNK2–/– mice. Since HK does not increase NFATc3 nuclear accumulation in wild-type animals (see Fig. 1), it is effectively impossible to obtain a baseline import or export rate using this stimulus. Accordingly, UTP rather than HK was used to promote NFATc3 nuclear accumulation in these experiments, to compare the results obtained from JNK2–/– with those from wild-type animals. The time course of NFATc3 nuclear accumulation induced by UTP (10 μm) was not different in arteries from wild-type and JNK2–/– mice (Fig. 2A). After allowing NFATc3 to accumulate in the nucleus (30 min), the UTP-containing solution was replaced with buffer alone, and artery segments were removed and fixed at time points from 5 to 60 min following UTP washout. In cerebral arteries from JNK2–/– animals, NFATc3 disappearance from the nucleus is significantly slowed compared with arteries from wild-type animals. As shown in Fig. 2B, the levels of nuclear NFATc3 in arterial smooth muscle from JNK2–/– mice are unchanged after 30 min of washout, a time at which nuclear NFATc3 has reached baseline levels in wild-type animals. Even after 60 min, nuclear NFATc3 levels remain significantly elevated in arteries from JNK2–/– mice compared with prestimulus controls. This increased nuclear retention of NFATc3 in the absence of JNK2 indicates that JNK2 normally acts to promote NFATc3 nuclear export and suggests that JNK2 activity makes an important contribution to NFATc3 nuclear export regulation in this tissue. Constitutively Elevated NFATc3 Nuclear Export Activity in Native Smooth Muscle—The fact that depolarization with HK effectively induces NFATc3 nuclear accumulation when a kinase that promotes its export is genetically removed underscores the importance of nuclear export activity in regulating nuclear accumulation of NFATc3. It further suggests that in smooth muscle, the “gain” on the nuclear export pathway is turned up relative to other excitable (20Graef I.A. Mermelstein P.G. Stankunas K. Neilson J.R. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1999; 401: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) and non-excitable (23Aramburu J. Azzoni L. Rao A. Perussia B. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) cells, where elevation of intracellular Ca2+ by depolarization or with ionophores, respectively, is sufficient to promote nuclear accumulation of NFAT. To test the possibility that HK induces nuclear translocation of NFATc3 that is not detectable against the background of constitutive nuclear export activity, we used leptomycin B, which inhibits Crm-1-dependent nuclear export (24Wolff B. Sanglier J.J. Wang Y. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 139-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) and would be predicted to trap transiently translocated NFATc3 in the nucleus. Cerebral arteries from CD1 control mice were stimulated with HK for 30 min with or without 500 nm leptomycin B, followed by immunohistochemical detection of NFATc3. As expected, HK alone induced no net increase in NFATc3 nuclear staining in cerebral arteries from CD1 mice. However, HK treatment in the presence of leptomycin B led to a significant increase in NFATc3 nuclear accumulation (Fig. 3). Under these conditions, leptomycin B alone has no significant effect (data not shown). These results indicate that the Ca2+ signal generated by HK does indeed induce NFATc3 nuclear translocation but is insufficient to induce a sustained nuclear accumulation of NFATc3 due to robust basal levels of nuclear export activity. These results also support a role for the exportin, Crm-1, in the NFATc3 nuclear export process in native vascular smooth muscle, consistent with the previously demonstrated role of Crm-1 in regulating the nuclear export of other NFAT isoforms exogenously expressed in cultured cells (11Kehlenbach R.H. Dickmanns A. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 863-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 13Zhu J. McKeon F. Nature. 1999; 398: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Differential Effects of UTP and HK on JNK Activity—In contrast to the results obtained with HK, leptomycin B has no effect on UTP-induced NFATc3 nuclear accumulation in cerebral artery smooth muscle (Fig. 3). Furthermore, UTP-induced NFATc3 nuclear accumulation is not enhanced in arteries from JNK2–/– animals (see Fig. 1C). These results suggests that JNK2/Crm-1-dependent NFATc3 nuclear export processes are inhibited by UTP and are thus insensitive to further inhibition by leptomycin B or JNK2 deficiency. To determine whether the effects of HK and UTP on JNK activity are consistent with this interpretation, we used an immunohistochemical approach and an antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated (P-JNK), active form of both JNK1 and JNK2 to evaluate HK- and UTP-induced changes in JNK activation. Neither stimulus induced an increase in JNK activity under the conditions employed. Instead, stimulation of cerebral arteries from wild-type animals with UTP (10 μm) significantly suppressed constitutive nuclear JNK activity at both 5 and 30 min, whereas HK did not (Fig. 4A). Most of this effect is likely attributable to changes in JNK2 activity, since results obtained using JNK1–/– and JNK2–/– animals indicate that P-JNK2 accounts for a preponderance of both total and nuclear P-JNK (Fig. 4B). These results are consistent with an inhibitory effect of UTP on nuclear JNK2 activity that results in a suppression of JNK2-mediated NFATc3 nuclear export. We have found that the absence of JNK2 activity creates a smooth muscle environment that is permissive for depolarization-induced stimulation of NFATc3 nuclear accumulation. Similar results are obtained by blocking NES-dependent, Crm-1-mediated nuclear export with leptomycin B. Several conclusions can be drawn from these observations. First, these data indicate that the Ca2+ signal generated by HK is sufficient to promote NFATc3 nuclear translocation in smooth muscle. The fact that this translocation is only revealed under conditions in which nuclear export is suppressed underscores the dynamic, multilevel regulation of NFAT nuclear accumulation. More importantly, these data further suggests that Ca2+ elevation, although strictly required, is not the rate-limiting step for NFATc3 nuclear accumulation in smooth muscle. In this tissue, where variations in intracellular Ca2+ are a prominent feature and a defining functional property, down-regulation of nuclear export activity appears to be a key requirement for sustained NFATc3 nuclear accumulation. This result contrasts with those obtained in neurons, where depolarization-induced increases in intracellular Ca2+ are sufficient to induce NFAT nuclear accumulation (20Graef I.A. Mermelstein P.G. Stankunas K. Neilson J.R. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1999; 401: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), and immune cells, where Ca2+ ionophore-induced elevation of intracellular Ca2+ is an equally effective stimulus (23Aramburu J. Azzoni L. Rao A. Perussia B. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Since the predominant NFAT isoforms are different among these cell types (NFATc4 in neurons and NFATc1/NFATc2 in immune cells), it may be that this apparent tissue-specific difference is a reflection of isoform-specific import/export regulation. These data indicate that suppression of JNK activity may be required for NFATc3 nuclear accumulation in vascular smooth muscle. The fact that nuclear levels of NFATc3 are not basally elevated in cerebral arteries from JNK2-deficient animals is not unexpected, since the low resting level of intracellular Ca2+ in these unpressurized arteries (∼80 nm (25Knot H.J. Nelson M.T. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 508: 199-209Crossref Scopus (530) Google Scholar)) is unlikely to cause significant calcineurin activation. However, the activation status of calcineurin in vascular smooth muscle may be higher under physiological conditions, where normal intravascular pressure (e.g. 60 mm Hg) increases intracellular Ca2+ in cerebral arteries to ∼200 nm (25Knot H.J. Nelson M.T. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 508: 199-209Crossref Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 26Gokina N.I. Knot H.J. Nelson M.T. Osol G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H1178-H1188PubMed Google Scholar), and intracellular Ca2+ changes dynamically in response to circulating and/or endothelial-derived vasoactive factors. Thus, in vivo, JNK-mediated NFAT nuclear export in vascular smooth muscle may provide an additional level of regulation to prevent “inadvertent” NFAT activation. An alternative possibility is that NFAT is active under physiological conditions and plays a role in maintaining the contractile phenotype of smooth muscle, as suggested by results from our laboratory 2M. F. Gomez, L. V. Gonzalez Bosc, A. S. Stevenson, M. K. Wilkerson, D. C. Hill-Eubanks, and M. T. Nelson, unpublished observations. and those of others (27Wada H. Hasegawa K. Morimoto T. Kakita T. Yanazume T. Abe M. Sasayama S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 983-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In this scenario, up-regulation of JNK activity under pathological conditions could suppress NFAT activity and provide a mechanism for switching from the contractile to the synthetic, proliferative phenotype. Results from cell lines of different tissue origin suggest that UTP may stimulate or inhibit JNK activity, depending on cell type (28Paul A. Torrie L.J. McLaren G.J. Kennedy C. Gould G.W. Plevin R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13243-13249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Our initial experiments in unpressurized arteries are consistent with a model in which relatively elevated basal JNK activity is suppressed by UTP, which also acts through multiple mechanisms to increase intracellular Ca2+. HK, which also induces a substantial increase in intracellular Ca2+, does not effectively suppress JNK activity and consequently fails to induce nuclear accumulation of NFATc3. HK and UTP may also have effects on other kinases that regulate NFATc3 nuclear export (or import), which could potentially add additional layers of complexity. The results obtained here provide the first evidence for JNK2-mediated NFATc3 nuclear export in native tissue, indicating that this mechanism, first characterized in transfection systems (16Chow C.W. Rincon M. Cavanagh J. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 278: 1638-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), is physiologically important. These results also confirm the physiological relevance of Crm-1-mediated NFAT export and extend these results specifically to the NFATc3 isoform. The fact that disruption of either mechanism alone is sufficient to allow HK to induce NFATc3 nuclear accumulation suggests that phosphorylation by JNK2 and Crm-1 binding may act in series rather than in parallel to promote NFATc3 nuclear export. It has been shown that NFAT accumulation in the nucleus depends, in part, on continued association with calcineurin, which blocks access of the nuclear export protein Crm-1 to NES (13Zhu J. McKeon F. Nature. 1999; 398: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and prevents Crm-1-mediated export. If JNK2 acts through direct phosphorylation of NFATc3, as described by Davis and colleagues (16Chow C.W. Rincon M. Cavanagh J. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 278: 1638-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), it is possible that JNK2-mediated phosphorylation results in disruption of NFATc3-calcineurin interactions and enhanced Crm1-mediated nuclear export. The JNK1 isoform has been shown to act by a similar direct phosphorylation mechanism to disrupt interactions between cytosolic NFAT and calcineurin and inhibit NFAT nuclear import (15Chow C.W. Dong C. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5227-5234Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These data provide strong evidence that JNK2 exerts an opposing influence on Ca2+-dependent, calcineurin-mediated NFAT nuclear translocation in native smooth muscle. Results of experiments with leptomycin B indicate that unless constitutively elevated nuclear export activity is inhibited, NFAT transiently cycles through the nucleus but does not accumulate, even in the presence of elevated global Ca2+. Our results support the concept of a dual signal mechanism for induction of NFATc3 nuclear accumulation in smooth muscle that requires both a calcineurin-activating Ca2+ signal and engagement of pathway(s) that down-regulate Crm-1/JNK-dependent nuclear export. We thank Dr. Mercedes Rincon for helpful discussions and Drs. R. A. Flavell and R. J. Davis for making the JNK knock-out animals available to us."

Selection is based on conformational criteria, and it is likely to involve a variety of molecular chaperones and folding factors (13Brodsky J.L. Werner E.D. Dubas M.E. Goeckeler J.L. Kruse K.B.

Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). There is reason to believe that distinct systems are employed for glycoproteins and non-glycoproteins. In addition to promoting proper folding and serving as retention markers, the N-linked oligosaccharide moieties of glycoproteins are used as specific signal tags for ERAD (16Helenius A. Aebi M. Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1955) Google Scholar). Genetic evidence indicates that the ER mannosidase I, the carbohydrate trimming enzyme that generates the Man8 isomer B structure, is necessary for efficient degradation of soluble and membrane-bound glycoproteins in yeast (17Jakob C.A. Burda P. Roth J. Aebi M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Inhibition of this mannosidase also blocks degradation of several ERAD substrates in mammalian cells (18Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5861-5867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 19Fagioli C. Sitia R. J. Biol.

A possible role for mannose trimming is also suggested by the effect on ERAD observed when a putative mannose lectin, named EDEM in mammalian cells and HtmI/MnlI in yeast, is eliminated or overexpressed (21Nakatsukasa K.

For some glycoproteins, there is also evidence that trimming of glucose residues plays a role in regulating ERAD (11de Virgilio M. Weninger H. Ivessa N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9734-9743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 26Wilson C.M. Farmery M.R. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21224-21232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).To further characterize the molecular basis of substrate recognition and targeting to ERAD in mammalian cells, we expressed a folding-defective yeast carboxypeptidase Y (CPY*) in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. CPY* is commonly used as an ERAD substrate in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The wild-type enzyme is a monomeric soluble glycoprotein (61 kDa) targeted via the Golgi complex to the yeast vacuole. The protein has five intrachain disulfide bonds, four N-linked glycans, and the crystal structure shows a globular overall structure (27Endrizzi J.A. Breddam K. Remington S.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11106-11120Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). CPY is synthesized as a prepro-protein. In the ER, the signal sequence is cleaved, the glycans are added, and disulfide bonds are formed; in the Golgi apparatus, oligosaccharides are modified and the pro-CPY is sorted to the vacuole, where the enzyme is activated by proteolytic cleavage of the pro-sequence (28Jung G. Ueno H. Hayashi R. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Glycosylation is required for efficient intracellular transport but is not for folding, sorting to the vacuole, or for activation (29Winther J.R. Stevens T.H. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 30Holst B. Bruun A.W. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Winther J.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3538-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). CPY*, the mutant protein used in our studies, has a point mutation in position 255 (Gly to Arg) that causes ER retention, retrotranslocation, and degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in yeast (9Hiller M.M. Finger A. Schweiger M. Wolf D.H. Science. 1996; 273: 1725-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 31Knop M. Finger A. Braun T. Hellmuth K. Wolf D.H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 753-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Glycosylation and ER mannosidase I-catalyzed mannose trimming are necessary for efficient CPY* degradation in yeast (17Jakob C.A. Burda P. Roth J. Aebi M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 31Knop M. Finger A. Braun T. Hellmuth K. Wolf D.H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 753-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar).We found that, when expressed in CHO cells, CPY* was rapidly and efficiently degraded by ERAD. However, although some of the protein was degraded by proteasomes, a large fraction was degraded in a proteasome-independent fashion. Although the proteasome-dependent degradation was unaffected by inhibitors of mannose trimming by ER mannosidase I, the proteasome-independent degradation pathway(s) was inhibited.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Transfection—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were maintained in minimal essential medium α supplemented with 8% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin, and 1% streptomycin. Cells were transiently transfected with SuperFect™ transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the instructions from the manufacturer.Materials—Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads, aprotinin, pepstatin, leupeptin, chymostatin, tunicamycin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), dithiothreitol (DTT), cycloheximide, castanospermine, 1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-d-mannitol, and deoxymannojirimycin were purchased from Sigma; ALLN, MG132, lactacystin, okadaic acid, and swainsonine were supplied by Calbiochem; 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (AMS) was from Molecular Probes; orthovanadate was from Axon Laboratory; kifunensine was obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals Inc.; SuperFect™ transfection reagent and cell culture reagents were from Qiagen and Invitrogen, respectively. CHAPS was obtained from Pierce. Promix [35S]methionine/cysteine was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Glucosidase II was purified from bovine liver (provided by M.

CPY* was amplified by PCR using a forward primer (TTAATGAATTCATGGCCATCATTTATCTCATTCTCCTGTTCACAGCAGTGAGAGGG ATCTCATTGCAAAGACCGTTGG), which contains the influenza hemagglutinin (Japan strain) signal sequence (italic) substituting for the CPY* signal sequence (35Bird P. Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2905-2914Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The PCR fragment was cloned into pSVSPORT1 to generate pSVHACPY*. To obtain pSVHACPY, the gene for the wild-type enzyme, the BglII-BsuI fragment containing the point mutation (G255R) was cut out and replaced by the BglII-BsuI fragment obtained from PCR on wild-type yeast genomic DNA. Plasmids for expression of BACE457Δ and HA-tagged EDEM are described elsewhere (23Hosokawa N. Wada I. Hasegawa K. Yorihuzi T. Tremblay L.O. Herscovics A. Nagata K.

Cell were washed twice with PBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ (PBS+), and starved for 30 min in serum-free medium lacking cysteine and methionine; labeling was performed in the same medium supplemented with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 10 min. Subsequent chase was performed in minimal essential medium α supplemented with methionine (5 mm) and cysteine (2.5 mm). At various chase times, labeling was stopped by washing cells in ice-cold PBS+ supplemented with 20 mmN-ethylmaleimide (NEM) on ice. Cells were lysed in 2% CHAPS, HBS (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl), 20 mm NEM, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin. When used, 10 mm AMS was added to washing and lysis solutions instead of NEM. Various inhibitors were added during the starvation time through all chase incubations unless indicated in the following concentrations: MG132 (50 μm), lactacystin (50 μm), ALLN (260 μm), leupeptin (10 μm), NH4Cl (50 mm), kifunensine (100 μm), swainsonine (100 μm), deoxymannojirimicyn (1 mm), castanospermine (1 mm), tunicamycin (5 μg/ml), okadaic acid (1 μm), and pervanadate (500 μm). Pervanadate was produced freshly before use as described elsewhere (36Miller S.C. Furniss M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32618-32626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation—Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C after solubilization with CHAPS. The postnuclear supernatant was pre-incubated for 1 h on protein A coupled to Sepharose CL-4B-beads at 4 °C. The nuclear pellets were washed once in HBS, resuspended in 1% SDS, and heated to 95 °C for 5 min. When anti-CPY immunoprecipitation was performed, the supernatant was denatured in 1% SDS for 5 min at 95 °C, and then the supernatant or resuspended nuclear pellets were diluted 10-fold in 1% Triton X-100 in HBS buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl). Anti-CPY was added together with protein A beads for overnight incubation at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times in 0.1% SDS, 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.3 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, and once in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.6. The immunocomplexes were eluted in sample buffer containing 100 mm DTT unless indicated otherwise. Anti-calnexin immunoprecipitation was performed as described (37Hammond C. Helenius A. Science. 1994; 266: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The immunocomplexes were then eluted in 1% SDS at 95 °C for 5 min and processed for anti-CPY immunoprecipitation as described above. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE and phosphorimager analysis. Quantification was performed with ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Anti-BACE457Δ immunoprecipitations were carried out by adding anti-BACE457Δ-specific antibody and protein A beads to the postnuclear supernatants. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times in HBS and 0.5% CHAPS and then resuspended in sample buffer before 10% SDS-PAGE.Sucrose Gradient Centrifugation—Lysates were prepared as described above. The postnuclear supernatant was loaded on top of 10–40% w/w linear sucrose gradient containing 2% CHAPS in HBS. The gradients were centrifuged for 7 h in SW50.1 rotor (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA) at 40,000 rpm at 4 °C. Fractions were collected manually from the top of the gradient, and subjected to a 1-h pre-incubation on protein A-Sepharose, before CPY was immunoprecipitated under non-denaturing conditions. Pellets were washed twice in HBS, then dissolved in 1% SDS, diluted 10-fold in 1% Triton X-100 in HBS, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-CPY.Endoglycosyidase H (Endo H) Digestion—Anti-CPY immunoprecipitates were washed as described. After the last wash, 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5, was added plus 1 unit of endoglycosidase Hf (New England Biolabs). The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by one wash in 0.5% CHAPS in HBS and one in HBS only. Samples were boiled in reducing sample buffer before SDS-PAGE analysis.Glucosidase II and Jack Bean α-Mannosidase Assay—Anti-CPY immunoprecipitates were washed as described, followed by incubation with glucosidase II in HBS buffer for 1 h at 37 °C or jack bean α-mannosidase (Sigma) in 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 4.5, overnight at 37 °C. After glucosidase II treatment, immunocomplexes were washed once in 0.5% CHAPS in HBS and once in HBS alone before boiling in reducing sample buffer and SDS-PAGE.Immunofluorescence—CHO cells grown on 12-mm coverslips were transfected with pSVHACPY* plasmid DNA as described above. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were fixed with 2.5% formaldehyde in serum-free medium supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were washed twice with serum-free medium, incubated 10 min at room temperature in PBS+, and permeabilized in PBS+ containing 10% goat serum, 15 mm glycine, and 0.05% saponin for 15 min at room temperature. Washing steps and antibody decoration were carried out with the same buffer. The cells were incubated with a monoclonal anti-CPY (Molecular Probes) at 40 μg/μl and an antibody against marker proteins of various cellular organelles at dilution of 1:100 at room temperature for 1 h. After extensive washing, the cells were incubated with Alexa label-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:200 at room temperature in the dark for 1 h. Further washings were performed in permeabilization solution and once in double-distilled H2O, after which coverslips were mounted on glass slides with Mowiol. Fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Zeiss Axiovert microscope, and image processing with a Hamamatsu CCD camera and the OpenLab software (InVision).RESULTSCPY* Is Retained in the ER and Degraded—Yeast CPY and CPY* were expressed in CHO cells using a transient transfection system. To ensure proper translocation of these heterologous proteins into the ER of the mammalian cells, we replaced the signal peptide sequence in the yeast enzyme with the signal sequence peptide from influenza virus hemagglutinin, which has been shown to support efficient translocation of CPY into the mammalian ER (35Bird P. Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2905-2914Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Twenty-one hours after transfection with the wild-type or mutant constructs (pSVHACPY or pSVHACPY*, respectively), the cells were subjected to pulse labeling with [35S]methionine/cysteine for either 2 or 10 min, and chased for time periods up to 4 h. The cells were then solubilized with CHAPS, and postnuclear lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-CPY antibodies. The medium was also collected and immunoprecipitated.SDS-PAGE of the immunoprecipitates followed by phosphorimager analysis showed that most of the wild-type CPY was rapidly secreted into the medium. The protein disappeared from the cell lysate (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–5) and appeared in the medium fraction (lanes 7–10) with a half-time of less than 30 min. Judging by the difference in gel mobility of the secreted and intracellular CPY (compare lanes 1 and 7–10), and by the acquisition of Endo H resistance (data not shown), the N-linked glycans were processed in the Golgi complex. Thus, although expressed as a heterologous protein, CPY was properly targeted to the ER, it passed the quality control, but instead of being transported to the lysosomes (vacuole) as in yeast it was rapidly secreted (35Bird P. Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2905-2914Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).In contrast, no secretion could be observed when CPY* was expressed (Fig. 1B, lane 1); labeled CPY* was only found in the cell lysate fraction after pulse and chase (lanes 2–7). The mobility difference in the CPY* band, observed before and after treatment with Peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) or Endo H (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 1, 3–5, and 2), indicated that the CPY* was glycosylated and therefore correctly targeted to the ER. Judging by the size of the shift after glycan removal, all four consensus glycosylation sites were probably used. That CPY* was undergoing some glycan trimming was suggested by a small, gradual drift in the position of the band with time (Fig. 1B, lanes 3–7). The small band appearing at lower molecular weight probably corresponded to a minor fraction of unglycosylated, untranslocated CPY*.Endo H digestion showed that the CPY* remained sensitive throughout the 4-h chase period (Fig. 1C). This indicated that the protein was retained in a pre-Golgi compartment. Indirect immunofluorescence using anti-CPY showed that the CPY* staining pattern overlapped with that of the ER visualized by co-staining with an anti-calnexin antibody (Fig. 2, A–C). CPY* localization was distinct from that of Golgi marker, Golgi mannosidase II, in agreement with the fact that CPY* remains Endo H-sensitive, and thus never reaches the medial Golgi (Fig. 2, G–I). Co-staining with the ERGIC marker p58, showed that the majority of CPY* did not overlap with p58, although we could not exclude some co-localization (D-F).Fig. 2Intracellular localization of CPY*. CPY*-expressing cells were double-stained with anti-CPY antibody (A, D, and G) (red) together with anti-calnexin (B) (green) or anti-p58 (E) (green) or anti-Golgi mannosidase II (H) (green) antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The cause for CPY* retention in the ER was most likely its inability to fold properly. To analyze the folding status of CPY*, we performed SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions comparing wild-type CPY and CPY*. Both showed slightly heterogeneous migration patterns. That they had mobilities somewhat faster than the fully reduced protein suggested that they had acquired intrachain disulfide bonds (Fig. 1F) (38Braakman I. Helenius J. Helenius A. Nature. 1992; 356: 260-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar).To test whether all intramolecular disulfides had formed in CPY*, we treated it with the thiol-conjugating reagent 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (AMS), which reacts with free sulfhydryl groups increasing the molecular mass of the target protein by ∼0.5 kDa for each AMS molecule added (39Joly J.C. Swartz J.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10067-10072Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). After radiolabeling, CPY*-expressing cells were lysed in presence of AMS and immunocomplexes were visualized in SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions. The protein displayed an even more heterogeneous migration with several discrete bands. The mobility of these bands (Fig. 1G, lane 1) compared with the band obtained when the fully reduced CPY* was conjugated (lane 3) confirmed that CPY* occurred in the ER as a mixture of differently oxidized forms lacking the full complement of disulfide bonds.In the non-reduced SDS-PAGE, there was no indication of covalent disulfide cross-linked aggregates like those often seen for misfolded proteins in the ER (Fig. 1F). To test whether CPY* was present in non-covalently associated aggregates, aliquots of CHAPS lysates from pulse-labeled cells were subjected to sucrose gradient velocity centrifugation (Fig. 1H). CPY* and CPY were found in a slowly sedimenting peak (S = 3.6) corresponding to the monomeric enzyme. Taken together, the results indicated that CPY* was retained in the ER as a mixture of incompletely folded, heterogeneously oxidized monomers.Degradation Occurs by Multiple Pathways—Although CPY* was not secreted, the amount of labeled enzyme in the cell lysates decreased rapidly with time (Fig. 1, B, lanes 3–7, and D). Because only insignificant amounts of CPY* were found in the nuclear pellet (Fig. 1E), the loss must have been caused by degradation. A detailed time course indicated that degradation started after a 45-min lag, and proceeded rapidly to virtual completion within the next 3 h (Fig. 1D). Half of the protein was degraded after 88 min.In yeast, CPY* is degraded after retrotranslocation from the ER lumen by proteasomes in the cytosol (9Hiller M.M. Finger A. Schweiger M. Wolf D.H. Science. 1996; 273: 1725-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). To investigate whether this was also the case in CHO cells, we performed the pulse-chase experiments described above in cells treated with the reversible proteasome inhibitor MG132. We consistently found, as shown in Fig. 3A (lane 6), some inhibition; 20–30% of the protein was protected by the inhibitor over a 4-h period. Additionally, in the presence of the more specific irreversible proteasome inhibitor lactacystin (40Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar), degradation was only partially blocked (compare lanes 4 and 8). ALLN, another non-specific inhibitor of the proteasome, had no effect at all (data not shown). To test whether the inhibitors needed longer time to be functional, we included a 90-min pre-incubation step in the presence of the proteasome inhibitors. Even in this case the inhibition was weak.Fig. 3Effect of various protease inhibitors on CPY* degradation.A, CPY*-expressing cells were pre-incubated for 30 min, pulsed for 10 min, and chased up to 4 h in the absence or presence of different protease inhibitors (MG, MG132; LC, lactacystin; L, leupeptin; N, NH4Cl). Cell lysates were processed as described in Fig. 1A. B, quantification of CPY* bands was performed on three different experiments. Percentage of the amount recovered under different treatments was expressed as referred to the amount at time 0 for each experimental condition. C, CHO cells co-transfected with CPY* and BACE457Δ were labeled for 10 min and chased for 4 h in the absence or in the presence of MG132. Equal amounts of post-nuclear supernatant were immunoprecipitated with anti-BACE457Δ and anti-CPY, respectively. Quantification of the bands of BACE457Δ and CPY* (data not shown) was expressed as percentage of time 0 (100%).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The effect of proteasome inhibitors was thus limited to a partial block in CPY* degradation only. That the MG132 preparations used were functional was confirmed by following the degradation of BACE457"

FADD is a death domain (DD) 1The abbreviations used are: DD, death domain; DED, death effector domain; FCS, fetal calf serum; GFP, green fluorescent protein; wt, wild type; PI, propidium iodide.1The abbreviations used are: DD, death domain; DED, death effector domain; FCS, fetal calf serum; GFP, green fluorescent protein; wt, wild type; PI, propidium iodide. and death effector domain (DED) containing adaptor protein essential for recruitment of the initiator caspases 8 and 10 to activated death receptors during apoptosis (1Peter M.E. Scaffidi C. Medema J.P. Kischkel F. Krammer P.H. Results Probl. Cell Differ. 1999; 23: 25-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the C-terminal half of FADD (C-FADD/FADD-DN), which contains the DD but lacks the DED, has been shown to have a dominant interfering effect, protecting against death receptor-mediated apoptosis by competing with endogenous FADD for binding to death receptors (2Chinnaiyan A.M. Tepper C.G. Seldin M.F. O'Rourke K. Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

Furthermore, FADD may also be a necessary component in T cell development and activation. Thymocytes and peripheral T cells from transgenic mice expressing C-FADD under the control of the proximal lck promoter exhibit a defect in activation-induced proliferation (5Strasser A. Newton K. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Similarly, FADD–/– T cells in chimeric mice of the RAG-1–/– background, which themselves lack T cells, also show impaired proliferation following activation (3Zhang J. Cado D. Chen A. Kabra N.H. Winoto A. Nature. 1998; 392: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar) resulting in a block in early T cell development (6Kabra N.H. Kang C. Hsing L.C. Zhang J. Winoto A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6307-6312Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 7Newton K. Harris A.W. Strasser A. EMBO J. 2001; 19: 931-941Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar) suggesting that in resting T cells FADD is important for reentry into the cell cycle.We recently showed that FADD and C-FADD are selectively phosphorylated at Ser194 (8Scaffidi C. Volkland J. Blomberg I. Hoffmann I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1236-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Highly phosphorylated FADD was found in cells in G2/M, whereas FADD phosphorylation was low in G1/S. Recently, the ability of FADD to promote cell cycle progression of T cells was found to depend on the phosphorylation of this site (9Hua Z.C. Sohn S.J. Kang C. Cado D. Winoto A. Immunity. 2003; 18: 513-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We now provide evidence that the Ser194 phosphorylation site is responsible for the ability of C-FADD to interfere with the cell cycle. Our data suggest that C-FADD may affect cell growth through the activity of a third domain located in the 35 C-terminal amino acids distinct from the DED and the DD.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines and Reagents—Culturing of BJAB cells was described previously (8Scaffidi C. Volkland J. Blomberg I. Hoffmann I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1236-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). BJAB stable transfectants were generated by transfection of C-FADD pcDNA3 plasmids as described before (8Scaffidi C. Volkland J. Blomberg I. Hoffmann I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1236-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). BJAB and MCF7-Fas stable transfectants were further supplemented with 1 or 0.25 mg/ml G418, respectively. MCF7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% FCS, 100 mm HEPES, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin. MCF10A and derivative cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F-12 supplemented with 5% FCS, 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 20 ng/ml human recombinant epidermal growth factor, 10 μg/ml insulin, and 10 μg/ml gentamycin. MCF10A-Myc cells were kept in selection with 0.2 mg/ml. G418 MCF10A-Myc cells were a gift from Dr. Conzen (University of Chicago) and described before (11Moran T.J. Gray S. Mikosz C.A. Conzen S.D. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 867-872PubMed Google Scholar). Taxol (Paclitaxel) was obtained from Sigma (catalog number T-7402). Cells were arrested with low doses of Taxol that do not induce apoptosis: 50 nm Taxol for BJAB and 500 nm for MCF10A-Myc cells.Adenoviral Constructs and Transduction—GFP and C-FADD expressing adenovirus-5 constructs were described before (19Streetz K. Leifeld L. Grundmann D. Ramakers J. Eckert K. Spengler U. Brenner D. Manns M. Trautwein C. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 446-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Generation of the S194A point mutant has also been described previously (8Scaffidi C. Volkland J. Blomberg I. Hoffmann I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1236-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). AdV-SA vector as well as the AdV-GFP control vector were generated using the two-cosmid system as illustrated before (20Wang X. Weike Z. Murakawa M. Freeman M.W. Seed B. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11296-11303Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In brief, the C-FADD gene expression unit with a cytomegalovirus promoter was cloned into the pLEP plasmid, using two cloning primers (AdV-C-FADD HindIII CCCAAGCTTGGGATGGACACATACCGCTAC and AdV-C-FADD NotI ATAGTTTAGCGGCCGCATTCTTATTTCAGGACGCTTCGGAGGT) and ligated into the pREP plasmid, containing the E1-deleted adenovirus type 2 genome. Recombinant Ad2 adenoviruses were generated in the E1-complemented helper cell line 293A. High titer stock solutions of adenovirus were obtained by repeated amplifications in 293A, cesium chloride purification, and quantification by measuring absorbance at A 260. For infection of cells with adenovirus, MCF7 or MCF10A cells were cultured to ∼70% confluence before transduction. The cells were incubated in 2% FCS low serum, cell type-specific medium containing recombinant adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 100 viral particles/cell at 37 °C for 90 min, and then supplemented to 10% FCS containing medium. Transduction efficiency was determined by intracellular staining for AU1-tagged C-FADD.Retroviral Constructs and Transduction—The C-FADD S194E point mutant was generated with the QuikChange XL mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using complementary primers to the sequence GTGGGGCCATGGAGCCGATGTCATGG (sense). To generate retroviral constructs, C-FADD wt (amino acids 80–208 of human FADD) and point mutants S194A and S194E were subcloned into the bicistronic retroviral vector MiGR1 (MSCV-IRES-GFP, as described previously (21DeKoter R.P. Walsh J.C. Singh H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4456-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar)) by ligation into the BglII and EcoRI sites. High titer retroviral supernatants were generated using the ΦNX-Ampho helper cell line (21DeKoter R.P. Walsh J.C. Singh H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4456-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Packaging cells were cotransfected with MIGR1-C-FADD vectors and a vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein coding plasmid (22Burns J.C. Friedmann T. Driever W. Burrasscano M. Yee Y.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8033-8037Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar) using Polyfect transfection reagent (Qiagen). Following transfection, supernatants were isolated at 48 h and added to cells along with 10 μg/ml polybrene, followed by a 1-h centrifugation step at 2700 rpm to enhance infection. Following transduction, cells were allowed to grow and sorted 2 weeks later based on GFP positivity to obtain a homogenous population.Intracellular Staining—For the quantification of intracellularly expressed proteins, cells were stained by a saponin permeabilization method (23Alegre M. Shiels H. Thompson C. Gajewski T.F. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3347-3356PubMed Google Scholar). The primary antibody used is the anti-AU1 (IgG3) from Covance (Richmond, CA) and secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).DNA Fragmentation and Cell Cycle Analysis—For apoptosis assays cells were stimulated with 1 μg/ml anti-APO-1 plus 1 ng/ml protein A or control treated with protein A alone and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. Anti-APO-1 antibody is an agonistic anti-CD95 antibody. For the quantification of DNA degradation or cell cycle analysis 5 × 105 cells were incubated with propidium iodide (8Scaffidi C. Volkland J. Blomberg I. Hoffmann I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1236-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and DNA content was measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (BD Biosciences).Western Blotting—Immunoblots for FADD were done as described before (8Scaffidi C. Volkland J. Blomberg I. Hoffmann I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1236-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) using the anti-FADD (IgG1) antibody from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe Ser194 Phosphorylation Site in C-FADD Is Not Important for Its Inhibition of CD95-mediated Apoptosis—Within FADD, Ser194 is part of a C-terminal domain outside of the DD. We therefore postulated that this region is not involved in recruiting FADD to the activated CD95 receptor. This suggested that phosphorylation of FADD at this residue does not interfere with apoptosis signaling through CD95 and may not function in apoptosis signaling. It has been shown that C-FADD inhibits cell cycle progression or is even toxic when expressed in nontumor cells (10Morgan M.J. Thorburn J. Thomas L. Maxwell T. Brothman A.R. Thorburn A. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 696-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), whereas it acts only as an inhibitor of CD95-mediated apoptosis in constantly cycling tumor cells (8Scaffidi C. Volkland J. Blomberg I. Hoffmann I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1236-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 10Morgan M.J. Thorburn J. Thomas L. Maxwell T. Brothman A.R. Thorburn A. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 696-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We therefore sought a nontumor cell line that would allow us to test the effects of C-FADD and its phosphorylation on the cell cycle. MCF10A cells are spontaneously immortalized breast epithelial cells that require both growth factors and steroids in culture (11Moran T.J. Gray S. Mikosz C.A. Conzen S.D. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 867-872PubMed Google Scholar). We used adenoviruses allowing us to express C-FADD (AdV-wt), C-FADD in which we replaced the phosphorylated serine at position 194 with alanine (AdV-SA), and GFP (AdV-GFP) as control. MCF10A cells could be quantitatively infected with these viruses, and the C-FADD proteins were expressed at the expected molecular weights (Fig. 1A). To test the effect of these proteins on apoptosis we infected the mammary carcinoma cell line MCF7-Fas with these viruses (12Jäättelä M. Benedict M. Tewari M. Shayman J.A. Dixit V.M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2297-2305PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Both proteins efficiently blocked CD95-mediated apoptosis confirming that all viruses transduced expression of functional C-FADD proteins.C-FADD Arrests MCF10A Cells in G2 /M—We next infected MCF10A cells with AdV-wt to test for effects on cell growth/cell cycle (Fig. 2A). C-FADD protein was expressed 2 days after infection (d2). However, beginning at day 3 post-infection the morphology of the cells changed, the proliferation stopped, and the cells exhibited a rounded morphology. At day 6 most of the cells were still attached to the plates but were rounded and appeared to be arrested in the cell cycle. Subsequent analysis demonstrated that C-FADD did not induce apoptosis in these cells as judged by the lack of fragmented nuclei following staining with propidium iodide (PI), lack of caspase processing in Western blot analysis, and the lack of PI uptake by these cells (data not shown). Furthermore, this effect of C-FADD on MCF10A cells was also observed when cells were cultured in the presence of the polyspecific caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (data not shown). A cell cycle analysis revealed that C-FADD-expressing cells arrested in G2/M (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, consistent with what we have reported previously, phosphorylation of endogenous FADD increased at the time of the G2/M arrest (Fig. 2B), indicating that expression of exogenous C-FADD can affect the phosphorylation status of endogenous FADD.Fig. 2C-FADD expression causes a phosphorylation dependent G2/M arrest in MCF10A cells. A, MCF-10A cells were transduced with AdV-wt and representative pictures of cell morphology are shown from 2 days (d2) to 6 days (d6) post-infection. Numbers represent ratio of cells in G1 versus G2/M stages of the cell cycle determined by propidium iodide staining. B, anti-FADD Western blot indicating expression of C-FADD and FADD from day 2 to day 6 of infection. C, MCF10A and MCF7 cells were infected with either AdV-GFP (GFP), AdV-C-FADD-wt (wt), or AdV-C-FADD-SA (S194A) and morphological changes documented over the course of 6 days. Representative pictures from day 2 (d2) and day 6 (d6) post-infection are shown. D, PI staining and cell cycle analysis of AdV-wt-infected MCF10A and MCF7 cells on day 6 of infection. Percentage of cycling cells in G1, S and G2/M phases is quantified on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The C-FADD-induced Cell Cycle Arrest in Nontumor Cells Requires an Intact Ser194 Phosphorylation Site—We next tested the effects of the different adenoviral constructs on MCF10A cells and on a corresponding tumor cell line MCF7 cells. Six days after infection MCF10A cells infected with AdV-GFP continued to proliferate (Fig. 2C), whereas MCF10A cells infected with AdV-wt had again rounded and stopped growing. In contrast, cells infected with AdV-SA continued to proliferate at a rate similar to GFP expressing cells (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, MCF7 cells expressing very similar high levels of C-FADD were not affected in their growth and not arrested in the cell cycle (Fig. 2D). These data first demonstrate that an intact phosphorylation site within C-FADD is required for the C-FADD-mediated inhibition of the cell cycle and second confirm that C-FADD acts in a cell-specific fashion.C-FADD-SE Lowers the Threshold for G2 /M Arrest in Cells Not Arrested by C-FADD—We and others (8Scaffidi C. Volkland J. Blomberg I. Hoffmann I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1236-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 10Morgan M.J. Thorburn J. Thomas L. Maxwell T. Brothman A.R. Thorburn A. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 696-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) have shown that certain tumor cell lines while rendered resistant to CD95-mediated apoptosis were not arrested in the cell cycle by overexpression of C-FADD. Since C-FADD arrested MCF10A cells in G2/M, and we demonstrated previously that the highest phosphorylation of FADD at Ser194 is found in G2/M, we generated BJAB cells (a Burkitt lymphoma cell line) stably expressing C-FADD with a S194E mutation to mimic phosphorylated FADD. Similar to C-FADD-wt and C-FADD-SA-expressing BJAB cells, CD95-mediated apoptosis was inhibited in the C-FADD-SE transfectants confirming that all proteins were expressed in a functional form (Fig. 3A). Although no obvious effects on the cell cycle were observed in these transfectants, we tested whether we could detect differences in the sensitivity to a reagent that induces G2/M arrest and FADD phosphorylation such as the tubulin binder Taxol. When cells were treated with a low dose of Taxol the C-FADD-SE-expressing cells arrested earlier and much more efficiently than the cells expressing the nonphosphorylatable C-FADD-SA (Fig. 3B). This result suggested that the phosphorylation of C-FADD at Ser194 could be generally relevant for the cell cycle but that cells have different thresholds of sensitivity to this effect. We therefore expected that a low expression of C-FADD-SE in MCF10A cells would also make these cells more susceptible to Taxol-induced G2/M arrest without causing a direct cell cycle arrest. To achieve lower protein expression than observed by infecting cells with adenoviruses, we switched to a retroviral system. Because MCF10A cells grow very slowly and could therefore not be efficiently infected by retroviruses (data not shown), we used MCF10A cells transfected with c-Myc. c-Myc accelerated the growth of MCF10A cells significantly without transforming them (11Moran T.J. Gray S. Mikosz C.A. Conzen S.D. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 867-872PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were infected with the different GFP-C-FADD viruses (at an infectious yield of ∼40%) and after 2 weeks sorted for GFP-positive cells resulting in similar expression of C-FADD (Fig. 3C). Overexpression of C-FADD did not affect expression of c-Myc (data not shown). Similar to the BJAB cells, MCF10A-Myc cells stably expressing C-FADD-SE were not directly affected in the cell cycle but were more sensitive to Taxol-induced G2/M arrest suggesting that even under conditions in which C-FADD does not directly block cell cycle progression it still has an effect on the cell cycle and this effect is dependent on its phosphorylation at Ser194 (Fig. 3D). Our data are consistent with a model in which C-FADD-SE acts synergistically with Taxol.Fig. 3Expression of a constitutive phosphorylation mimicking mutant C-FADD-SE increases efficiency of G2/M arrest. A, BJAB control cells or BJAB cells stably transfected with C-FADD wild type (wt) or the point mutants S194A (SA) or S194E (SE) were treated with anti-CD95 (closed bars) or control treated (open bars). Apoptosis was quantified as the percentage of cells with DNA fragmentation. The inset is an anti-FADD Western blot showing the exogenous proteins. B, kinetics of G2/M arrest in BJAB stable transfectants treated with 50 nm Taxol. C, anti-FADD Western blot corresponding to the 18-h time point in D, in normal cycling cells or cells arrested with Taxol. D, kinetics of G2/M arrest in retrovirally transduced MCF10A-Myc cells stably expressing C-FADD wt, SA, or SE arrested with 500 nm Taxol. Kinetics of untransfected cells were similar to the wt- and SA-expressing cells (data not shown). The experiments are representative of at least four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A previous study has shown that C-FADD only kills normal but not tumorigenic prostate epithelial cells (10Morgan M.J. Thorburn J. Thomas L. Maxwell T. Brothman A.R. Thorburn A. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 696-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The authors had attributed this activity to the FADD DD. However, our data make it likely that the Ser194 phosphorylation site of FADD was involved in this activity. Ser194 is located in a domain C-terminal of the DD in FADD that has thus far not been well studied. However, C-FADD has been widely used to test whether a form of apoptosis is dependent on activation of death receptors. Our data provide an explanation for the growing number of cases in which C-FADD has been shown to inhibit cell death where no involvement of death receptors/ligands could be shown (13Rytomaa M. Martins L.M. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1043-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 14Gil J. Esteban M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3665-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 15Bush J.A. Cheung Jr., K.J. Li G. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 271: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that in these cases C-FADD affected the cell cycle, which may have rendered them more resistant to apoptosis. Indeed, a previous report characterizing the MCF10A-Myc cells found that apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal was substantially blocked by overexpression of C-FADD, and no evidence for death receptor involvement could be found (11Moran T.J. Gray S. Mikosz C.A. Conzen S.D. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 867-872PubMed Google Scholar).MCF10A cells in our study were arrested in G2/M by C-FADD. In contrast, resting cells overexpressing C-FADD were shown to be arrested in G0 or G1 (16Hueber A. Zörnig M. Bernard A. Chautan M. Evan G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10453-10462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). An analysis of FADD–/– T cells showed that a fraction of T cells in these mice showed a 10-fold increase of cells in S and the G2/M phase over wild type levels (17Zhang J. Kabra N.H. Cado D. Kang C. Winoto A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29815-29818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It is not clear at present how the lack of FADD or overexpression of C-FADD interferes with the cell cycle in different cells. An analysis has excluded a role for the following pathways in T cells: activation of NF-κB, mobilization of intracellular calcium, p38, and mitogen-activated protein kinases (18Newton K. Kurts C. Harris A.W. Strasser A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 273-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The kinase that phosphorylates FADD at Ser194 therefore likely acts in parallel or downstream of all these pathways. It has been reported that upon overexpression of C-FADD several cell cycle proteins were deregulated suggesting FADD may directly or indirectly interfere with the cell cycle machinery (18Newton K. Kurts C. Harris A.W. Strasser A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 273-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although it is not clear how overexpression of C-FADD relates to the function of endogenous FADD, our study is consistent with recent data on mice carrying a FADD(S191D) replacement (the corresponding serine in mouse FADD), which show that regulation of FADD phosphorylation at Ser191 is crucial for cell cycle progression in T cells (9Hua Z.C. Sohn S.J. Kang C. Cado D. Winoto A. Immunity. 2003; 18: 513-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This situation is reminiscent of the remarkable similarities between T cells from C-FADD transgenic mice and FADD-deficient mice (5Strasser A. Newton K. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 3Zhang J. Cado D. Chen A. Kabra N.H. Winoto A. Nature. 1998; 392: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Collectively, the data point to an important role of the kinase that phosphorylates FADD on Ser194 in linking death receptor signaling to cell cycle progression. In summary, our data demonstrate: first, the activity of C-FADD to affect cell cycle progression is not restricted to T cells; second, the serine 194 phosphorylation site of FADD is involved in this effect; and third, cells have different thresholds to respond to the cell cycle inhibiting effects of C-FADD. FADD is a death domain (DD) 1The abbreviations used are: DD, death domain; DED, death effector domain; FCS, fetal calf serum; GFP, green fluorescent protein; wt, wild type; PI, propidium iodide.1The abbreviations used are: DD, death domain; DED, death effector domain; FCS, fetal calf serum; GFP, green fluorescent protein; wt, wild type; PI, propidium iodide. and death effector domain (DED) containing adaptor protein essential for recruitment of the initiator caspases 8 and 10 to activated death receptors during apoptosis (1Peter M.E. Scaffidi C. Medema J.P. Kischkel F. Krammer P.H. Results Probl. Cell Differ. 1999; 23: 25-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the C-terminal half of FADD (C-FADD/FADD-DN), which contains the DD but lacks the DED, has been shown to have a dominant interfering effect, protecting against death receptor-mediated apoptosis by competing with endogenous FADD for binding to death receptors (2Chinnaiyan A.M. Tepper C.G. Seldin M.F. O'Rourke K. Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4961-4965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). FADD–/– mice die in utero, which suggests a role for FADD in embryonic development (3Zhang J. Cado D. Chen A. Kabra N.H. Winoto A. Nature. 1998; 392: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 4Yeh W.C. Pompa J.L. McCurrach M.E. Shu H.B. Elia A.J. Shahinian A. Ng M. Wakeham A. Khoo W.

Furthermore, FADD may also be a necessary component in T cell development and activation. Thymocytes and peripheral T cells from transgenic mice expressing C-FADD under the control of the proximal lck promoter exhibit a defect in activation-induced proliferation (5Strasser A. Newton K. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Similarly, FADD–/– T cells in chimeric mice of the RAG-1–/– background, which themselves lack T cells, also show impaired proliferation following activation (3Zhang J. Cado D. Chen A. Kabra N.H. Winoto A. Nature. 1998; 392: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar) resulting in a block in early T cell development (6Kabra N.H. Kang C. Hsing L.C. Zhang J. Winoto A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

We recently showed that FADD and C-FADD are selectively phosphorylated at Ser194 (8Scaffidi C. Volkland J. Blomberg I. Hoffmann I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J.

Recently, the ability of FADD to promote cell cycle progression of T cells was found to depend on the phosphorylation of this site (9Hua Z.C. Sohn S.J. Kang C. Cado D. Winoto A. Immunity. 2003; 18: 513-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We now provide evidence that the Ser194 phosphorylation site is responsible for the ability of C-FADD to interfere with the cell cycle. Our data suggest that C-FADD may affect cell growth through the activity of a third domain located in the 35 C-terminal amino acids distinct from the DED and the DD.

https://openalex.org/W1976961832,"The importance of the mitochondria in UV-induced apoptosis has become increasingly apparent. Following DNA damage cytochrome c and other pro-apoptotic factors are released from the mitochondria, allowing for formation of the apoptosome and subsequent cleavage and activation of caspase-9. Active caspase-9 then activates downstream caspases-3 and/or -7, which in turn cleave poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase (PARP) and other down-stream targets, resulting in apoptosis. In an effort to understand the mechanisms of Akt-mediated cell survival in breast cancer, we studied the effects of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I treatment on UV-treated MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Apoptosis was induced in MCF-7 cells after UV treatment, as measured by caspase-7 and PARP cleavage, and IGF-I co-treatment protected against this response. Surprisingly caspase-9 cleavage was unchanged with UV and/or IGF-I treatment. Using MCF-7 cells overexpressing caspase-3 we have shown that resistance of caspase-9 to cleavage was not altered by the expression of caspase-3. Furthermore, overexpression of caspase-9 did not enhance PARP or caspase-7 cleavage after UV treatment. Because caspase-8 was activated with UV treatment alone, we believe that UV-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells occurs independently of cytochrome c and caspase-9, supporting the existence of a cytoplasmic inhibitor of cytochrome c in MCF-7 cells. We anticipate that such inhibitors may be overexpressed in cancer cells, allowing for treatment resistance.

Caspases, a family of cysteine proteases, are an integral part of the execution phase of programmed cell death. Initiator caspases-2, -8, -9, and -10 are first induced to undergo oligomerization, leading to autocatalytic activity and subsequent cleavage of the downstream effector caspases (see Refs. 1Shi Y. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar and 2Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar for review). The two major pathways for the execution of apoptosis are defined by the initiator caspases-8 and -9. Caspase-8-induced apoptosis is regulated via activation of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) 1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; PARP, poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Z-IETD-FMK, Z-Ile-Glu-(OMe)-Thr-Asp(OMe) fluoromethyl ketone. receptor superfamily of receptors induced by ligands such as TNF-α, TRAIL, or Fas (3Zou H.

Non-cytokine-mediated cellular stress, such as UV or chemical treatment, can initiate apoptosis through mitochondrial release of cytochrome c (8Hakem R. Hakem A. Dunscan G.S. Henderson J.T. Woo M.

In the caspase-9 initiated pathway, cytoplasmic cytochrome c triggers the formation of the apoptosome, a multi-protein complex containing cytochrome c, dATP, Apaf-1, and pro-caspase-9 (9Li P.

The presence of caspase-3 and/or -7 within the apoptosome may allow more optimal cleavage of caspase-9. Ultimately, activated caspase-9 serves as the initiator caspase, which may further amplify an apoptotic signal by activating caspase-8 and -2 upstream of the mitochondria (11Lassus P. Rodriguez J. Lazebnik Y. Science. 2002; 297: 1352-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Downstream responses to caspase-9 include cleavage of caspase-3 and/or -7 and eventually poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase (PARP) (12Cain K. Brown D.G. Langlais C. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22686-22692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Multiple mechanisms of resistance to apoptosis have been recently identified. By phosphorylating caspase-9, Akt inhibits its proteolytic activity (13Cardone M.H. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Franke T.F. Stanbridge E. Frisch S. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (2735) Google Scholar). Further, resistance to mitochondrial initiated events has also been reported. For example, Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL can inhibit cytochrome c translocation (14Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Schofield L. Israels S. Roncinske R. Yoshida K. Bharti A. Yuan Z.M. Saxena S. Weichselbaum R. Nalin C.

Israels S. Roncinske R. Yoshida K. Bharti A. Yuan Z.M. Saxena S. Weichselbaum R. Nalin C. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The apoptosome and effector caspase activity can be further regulated by members of the IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis proteins) family of proteins, which can directly bind to caspases via BIR (baculoviral IAP repeat) protein domains. BIR domains 1 and 2 of IAPs bind and inhibit caspases-3 and -7, whereas the BIR3 domain binds to and specifically inhibits caspase-9 (19Deveraux Q.L. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Van Arsdale T. Zhou Q.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5242-5250Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). These inhibitory effects can be offset by the stress-induced release of the mitochondrial protein, Smac/Diablo, which competitively binds to IAPs, relieving their inhibitory effects on caspases-3, -7, and -9 (21Verhagen A.M.

Methylation mediated transcriptional repression of Apaf-1 has been reported in metastatic melanomas and ovarian cancer cell lines (23Soengas M.S. Capodieci P. Polsky D. Mora J. Esteller M.

Akt phosphorylation of pro-caspase-9, a downstream target of p53, blocks cleavage of pro-caspase-9 and its subsequent activation (13Cardone M.H. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Franke T.F. Stanbridge E. Frisch S. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (2735) Google Scholar, 25Soengas M.S. Larcon R.M. Yoshida H. Giaccia A.J. Hakem R. Mak T. Lowe S.W. Science. 1999; 284: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Thus, regulation of pro-caspase-9 is of particular importance in p53-mediated effects. Therefore, we initially set out to determine whether pro-caspase-9 may be an Akt target for survival of IGF-I sensitive breast cancer cells. Since the discovery that MCF-7 human breast cancer cells do not express full-length caspase-3, because of a 47-base pair deletion within exon 3 of the caspase-3 gene, debate has existed regarding the ability of MCF-7 cells to undergo programmed cell death (26Janicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1721) Google Scholar, 27Blanc C. Deveraux Q.L. Krajewski S. Janicke R.U. Porter A.G. Reed J.C. Jaggi R. Marti A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4385-4390Google Scholar). More recently, the MCF-7 cell line has become a model for investigation of caspase-3-dependent and -independent effects. Although less studied, caspase-7 may convey many of the same effects as caspase-3, suggesting some redundancy between the two proteins. Here we show that MCF-7 cells undergo caspase-mediated apoptosis upon UV treatment, as indicated by caspase-7 and PARP cleavage. Most interesting is our observation that UV treatment can induce apoptosis via caspase-8 activation, independent of caspase-9. Additionally, in studying the potential mechanism for the lack of a caspase-9 response, we conclude that MCF-7 cells harbor a cytochrome c or apoptosome defect. Cell Culture and Treatments—MCF-7 cells were provided by Dr. C. Kent Osborne (University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX), and other MCF-7 cells were provided by Dr. Heide Ford (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO); HEK 293 cells were provided by Dr. Douglas Wolf (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO). Cell lines were maintained in full serum medium (MCF-7 in Iscove's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Mediatech), antibiotics, and insulin; HEK 293 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech) was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Mediatech) and antibiotics). In each experiment the cells were plated in full serum-containing media and cultured overnight at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. The cells were washed twice the next day in warm phosphate buffered saline (PBS; Biofluids, Rockville, MD) followed by overnight culture in serum-free medium. On the third day, the cells were treated with UV (UV-C, 10 J/m2) in a SpectroLinker UV linker 100 (Spectronics, Westbury, NY) with lids removed and/or IGF-1 (obtained from the National Hormone and Pituitary Program, NIDDK, National Institutes of Health and Dr. A. F. Parlow) or with TNF-α (Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA) and cycloheximide (Sigma-Aldrich), as indicated in figure legends. When applicable, pretreatments with LY294002 (Alexis Biochemicals) or Z-IETD-FMK (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) were performed 40 or 30 min prior to stimulation with UV, respectively. Stable and Transient Transfections—pcDNA3 caspase-3 and FLAG-caspase-9 vectors were graciously provided by Dr. C. Vincenz (University of Michigan). Generation of MCF-7 caspase-3 stable transfectants was performed by electroporation of 3.0 × 106 MCF-7 cells in 200 μl of medium containing 10 μg of DNA. Forty-eight hours later, the cells were selected with 800 μg/ml of G418 (Mediatech). Individual drug-resistant colonies were isolated and expanded. Detection of clones overexpressing caspase-3 was performed by Western blot analysis using a caspase-3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). For transient transfections with wild-type caspase-9 or Bcl-2, 1.0 × 106 MCF-7 cells were plated in 6-cm2 dishes and cultured overnight in full serum medium. The cells were washed twice the following day with warm PBS and then incubated with serum free Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) for 45 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The cells were then transfected with 30 μl of Plus reagent, 4 μl of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen), and 4 μgofDNA (3 μg of DNA of interest and 1 μg of green fluorescent protein); 3 h later plates were supplemented with full serum medium. Twenty-four hours after transfection the cells were assessed for transfection efficiency by visualization of green fluorescent protein and then treated as mentioned above. Preparation of Cell Lysates and Western Blot Analyses—At the indicated times, the cells were scraped and harvested by centrifugation. The plates were washed once with cold PBS followed by an additional centrifugation. The cells were then lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.368 mg/ml Na Orthovanadate, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 17 μg/ml aprotinin) followed by centrifugation at 13,000 to remove cellular debris. The protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad D/C protein assay kit. Sixty micrograms of total cell lysate were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, unless stated otherwise, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blot analyses were performed using primary antibodies for caspase-3, caspase-7, caspase-8, caspase-9, cleaved caspase-9 D315 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), PARP (BD Pharmingen), XIAP (BD Pharmingen), or tubulin (Sigma), and enhanced chemiluminescence (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Each Western blot shown is representative of at least three separate experiments. Antibody Cross-linking and Immunoprecipitations—Immunoprecipitations were performed by first cross-linking antibody to protein G-agarose beads (Invitrogen). The antibody for caspase-9 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was incubated with protein G-agarose beads in PBS for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed six times in 0.18 m sodium borate (pH 8.0) before incubation with 0.18 m sodium borate (pH 8.0) containing 100 mm DMP (dimethylpimelimidate) for 2 h at room temperature. The beads were then washed three times with 0.2 m ethanolamine and incubated with 0.2 m ethanolamine for 2 h at room temperature. The cross-linked beads were washed in cold PBS and stored at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitations, the cells were treated and harvested as described above. For each treatment, 200 μg of total cell lysate were incubated with 10 μl of cross-linked beads in a total volume of 300 μl of lysis buffer. Incubation was carried out for 3 h at 4 °C; beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer before being resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. Western blots were carried out as described above. Mitochondrial Inner Membrane Potential—Mitochondrial inner membrane potential was assessed by a mitochondrial voltage-sensitive dye JC-1 (Intergen, Purchase, NY) per manufacturer instructions and flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson, University of Colorado Cancer Center Flow Cytometry Core facility, which is supported by NCI, National Institutes of Health Cancer Core Support Grant CA46934). The fluorescent mitochondrial probe, JC-1, was used to verify treatment mediated changes in mitochondrial membrane ΔΨ. In apoptotic cells, the JC-1 dye remains monomeric in the cytoplasm showing green fluorescence. Whereas in unstressed cells, the mitochondrial aggregate forms fluorescent red at 590 nm. The experiments were repeated three times, and representative results are shown. Cytochrome c Immunostaining—The cells were plated at a density of 85,000 cells/25-mm diameter slides (Lab-Tek, Nalge Nunc, Naperville, IL) and fixed in PBS containing 2% paraformaldehyde. The cells were washed in PBS, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100, and then blocked in 10% normal goat serum/PBS. The cells were incubated with cytochrome c antibody (clone 6H2.B4 (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA)) and then washed and incubated with mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 488 AB (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The slides were imaged on a Nikon Diaphot TE200 microscope using a CoolSNAP-fx monochrome digital camera and Image-Pro Plus V4.1 software. The images are shown with color overlay. The experiments were repeated three times, and representative results are shown. In Vitro Cleavage of Pro-caspase-9—A plasmid containing cDNA encoding pro-caspase-9 (pcDNA3-FLAG-tagged caspase-9) was in vitro transcribed and translated in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) using a coupled transcription/translation TnT kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The protein was desalted and exchanged into buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2,1mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) with Bio-Spin P-6 columns (Bio-Rad). The cell lysates were prepared as described above but were lysed with buffer A. The radiolabeled reactions consisted of 80 μg of cell lysate, 5 μl of 35S-labeled pro-caspase-9, 1.5 mm dATP (Sigma-Aldrich), and 1.8 or 18.0 μm horse heart cytochrome c (Sigma-Aldrich) in a 30-μl total volume; the reactions for Western blot analysis were identical with the omission of 35S-labeled pro-caspase-9. The reactions were allowed to proceed for 4 h at 30 °C before being analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (STORM 860, Molecular Dynamics, Amersham Biosciences) or Western blot (19Deveraux Q.L. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Van Arsdale T. Zhou Q. Srinivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2215-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). The experiments were repeated a minimum of two times, and representative results are shown. Cytochrome c Sequencing—RNA was extracted from confluent 10-cm2 dishes of MCF-7 and HEK 293 cells using RNAwiz isolation reagent (Ambion, Austin, TX) per manufacturer instructions. 1 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in 20 μl of reaction mixture. Cytochrome c was amplified from the resulting cDNA (10 μl) using platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and the primers 5′-gagtgttcgttgtgccagcg and 5′-gcccaacaaaatattctgtcagtc. cDNA was amplified in 35 cycles, consisting of denaturing for 15 s at 94 °C, annealing for 30 s at 55 °C, and primer extension for 60 s at 68 °C. The PCR products were purified using Microcon PCR Centrifugal Filter devices (Ambion) per manufacturer instructions. The University of Colorado Cancer Center DNA Sequencing and Analysis Core Facility, which is supported by NCI, National Institutes of Health Cancer Core Support Grant CA46934, sequenced the DNA samples using an ABI Prism 3100 capillary automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Analyses of DNA sequences were done with Sequencher 3.1 (Gene Codes Corp., Ann Arbor, MI). UV Induces Caspase-7 and PARP Cleavage in MCF-7 Cells—Because UV irradiation frequently induces mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and cleavage of caspase-9, we exposed MCF-7 breast cancer cells to UV irradiation to induce apoptosis via PARP and caspase-7 cleavage and also to determine whether IGF-I co-treatment could inhibit UV-mediated cell death. We also pretreated cells with LY294002, which blocks the activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and downstream Akt. Measurement of PARP cleavage was used as a direct measure of apoptosis. Fig. 1 clearly shows that MCF-7 cells that are induced to undergo apoptosis via UV irradiation are protected by co-treatment with IGF-I, and this survival effect can be blocked by LY294002. Because MCF-7 cells are deficient in caspase-3, we also measured caspase-7 processing to determine whether it could function similarly to caspase-3 as an effector caspase that can cleave PARP (Fig. 1). Caspase-7 cleavage patterns were very similar to those of PARP, in that UV treatment resulted in caspase-7 cleavage, and IGF-I co-treatment inhibited its cleavage. These data support a previous study showing that caspase-7 catalytic activity can induce PARP cleavage (28Germain M. Affar E.B. D'Amours D. Dixit V.M. Salvesen G.S. Poirier G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28379-28384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). By assessing both caspase-7 and PARP cleavage, LY294002 not only reversed IGF-I-mediated survival, but it also enhanced cell death in the presence of UV irradiation, presumably by inhibiting survival signals mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Caspase-9 Cleavage Is Unchanged with UV and/or IGF-I Treatment—UV irradiation induces apoptosis among various cell types in a mitochondrial-dependent manner (8Hakem R. Hakem A. Dunscan G.S. Henderson J.T. Woo M. Soengas M.S. Elia A. de la Pompa J.L. Kagi D. Khoo W. Potter J. Yoshida R. Kaufman S.A. Lowe S.W. Penninger J.M. Mak T.W. Cell. 1998; 94: 339-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). Following irradiation, cytochrome c is released from the mitochondria into the cytosol, where it then complexes with Apaf-1, dATP, and pro-caspase-9 to form the apoptosome. Once bound in the apoptosome, pro-caspase-9 is processed to its active form, and it then activates effector caspases-3 and -7 to complete the apoptotic process. We sought to determine whether pro-caspase-9 is processed as expected in our MCF-7 cells and whether IGF-I could inhibit pro-caspase-9 cleavage. Again, UV treatment of MCF-7 cells induced PARP cleavage (Fig. 2). Despite the UV-induced PARP cleavage, we observed no detectable changes in the amount of caspase-9 cleavage following UV treatment. Also intriguing was the amount of caspase-9 cleavage present in the absence of stress (Fig. 2, Serum lane, negative control). Under normal conditions, pro-caspase-9 is not processed unless a stress signal induces cells to undergo apoptosis. In MCF-7 cells, pro-caspase-9 is processed to a small extent even in unstressed cells. We confirmed that the cleavage product observed in MCF-7 cell lysates corresponded to the manufacturer's positive lysate control and not the negative lysate control, ruling out the possibility that we were only detecting a nonspecific band (data not shown). Caspase-9 cleavage was also unaltered by IGF-I treatment, even though the cells were protected from apoptosis (compare PARP cleavage minus and plus IGF-I treatment). Caspase-3 Expression Does Not Sensitize Caspase-9 to UV Treatment in MCF-7 Cells—The presence of some caspase-9 cleavage in untreated cells and the lack of a caspase-9 treatment-mediated increase in cleavage both suggest either a defect in endogenous pro-caspase-9 or the cellular machinery that processes it. We reasoned that if endogenous pro-caspase-9 of MCF-7 cells is defective, then transfected wild-type pro-caspase-9 could rescue the defect in caspase processing and should further enhance cleavage of the effector caspase-7. Because there is evidence to support a requirement for caspase-3 in the apoptosome for proper function (29Bratton S.B. Walker G. Srinivasula S.M. Sun X.M. Butterworth M. Alnemri E.S. Cohen G.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 998-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), we also decided to address the role of caspase-3 in our model. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we transfected MCF-7 cells with wild-type pro-caspase-9 and reassessed caspase-9 cleavage in the presence and absence of UV irradiation (Fig. 3). Further, because a lack of endogenous caspase-3 could lead to a defect in apoptosome function and subsequent caspase-9 processing, we assessed caspase-9 cleavage in MCF-7 cells stably expressing wild-type caspase-3. As shown in Fig. 3A, transiently transfected pro-caspase-9 is partially processed in MCF-7 cells; however, it does not lead to enhanced processing of effector caspase-7 after UV treatment. Fig. 3B illustrates that caspase-9 cleavage products increase with transfection even in the absence of UV-induced stress. Together, these studies indicate that endogenous pro-caspase-9 is processed in a similar fashion as transfected wild-type protein, ruling out a defect in endogenous caspase-9 in MCF-7 cells and supporting the possibility that UV-mediated apoptosis in MCF-7 cells is caspase-9-insensitive. These data suggest an apoptosome defect in MCF-7 cells. Other investigators have shown that overexpression of caspase-3 in MCF-7 cells enhances cleavage of pro-caspase-9 by using in vitro reactions with exogenous pro-caspase-9 and cytochrome c (27Blanc C. Deveraux Q.L. Krajewski S. Janicke R.U. Porter A.G. Reed J.C. Jaggi R. Marti A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4385-4390Google Scholar). Although the presence of caspase-3 is evident in the caspase-3 transfectants used in Fig. 3A (data not shown), processing of endogenous caspases-9 and -7 were unaffected by the presence of caspase-3 compared with parental MCF-7 cells. Again, these data indicate that the defect lies upstream of apoptosome formation, not within endogenous pro-caspase-9. Stress Treatments Induce Cytochrome c Translocation in MCF-7 Cells—Because the initiator caspase-8 can also cleave Bid to tBid and tBid translocation can induce cytochrome c release, we then tested whether there may be either an aberration in mitochondrial function, preventing proper release of cytochrome c, or a defect in the formation and/or function of the apoptosome. Using the JC-1 assay, we first sought to determine whether cellular stress results in mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Further, we wanted to determine whether cytochrome c is properly localized and released from mitochondria following UV irradiation. As a positive control for these assays, we used HEK 293 cells. Many investigators have confirmed that UV induces mitochondrial membrane changes and cytochrome c translocation in these cells. In the JC-1 assay, we used valinomycin treatment that generally induces mitochondrial membrane ΔΨ changes in ∼95–98% of either HEK 293 or MCF-7 cells (Fig. 4A). Although UV treatment also changed mitochondrial membrane ΔΨ, it was not as robust as with valinomycin treatment in either cell line. Next, we also examined cytochrome c cellular localization using cytochemistry. With this assay we observed that in untreated MCF-7 cells, cytochrome c was somewhat diffusely localized in the cytoplasm, whereas the pattern of staining was more characteristic of a mitochondrial, punctate staining in the HEK 293 cells (Fig. 4B). With UV or valinomycin exposure, cytochrome c becomes diffusely localized in the cytoplasm in both cell lines. These studies confirm that like HEK 293 cells, MCF-7 cells can respond to cellular stress by changing mitochondrial membrane ΔΨ and inducing cytochrome c cytoplasmic translocation. MCF-7 Cell Lysates Can Cleave Caspase-9 with Exogenous Cytochrome c—Given our evidence that cytochrome c release is stimulated by either valinomycin or UV in MCF-7 cells yet caspase-9 is unresponsive to treatment, we decided to determine whether the defect in pro-caspase-9 processing lies within the endogenous cytochrome c protein itself. Both MCF-7 and HEK 293 cell lysates were obtained from either untreated cells or cells exposed to valinomycin (to stimulate endogenous cytochrome c release) prior to harvesting. We then performed in vitro caspase-9 cleavage assays (Fig. 5A). Wild-type procaspase-9 was in vitro transcribed and translated in the presence of [35S]met"

We previously demonstrated that Glu1089 in transmembrane (TM) 14 is critical for the protein to confer anthracycline resistance. We have now assessed the functional importance of all polar and charged amino acids in this TM helix. Asn1100, Ser1097, and Lys1092, which are all predicted to be on the same face of the helix as to Glu1089, are involved in determining the substrate specificity of the protein. Notably, elimination of the positively charged side chain of Lys1092, increased resistance to the cationic drugs vincristine and doxorubicin, but not the electroneutral drug etoposide (VP-16). In addition, mutations S1097A and N1100A selectively decreased transport of 17β-estradiol 17-(β-d-glucuronide) (E217βG) but not cysteinyl leukotriene 4 (LTC4), demonstrating the importance of multiple residues in this helix in determining substrate specificity. In contrast, mutations of Asp1084 that eliminate the carboxylate side chain markedly decreased resistance to all drugs tested, as well as transport of both E217βG and LTC4, despite the fact that LTC4 binding was unaffected. We show that these mutations prevent the ATP-dependent transition of the protein from a high to low affinity substrate binding state and drastically diminish ADP trapping at nucleotide binding domain 2. Based on results presented here and crystal structures of prokaryotic ATP binding cassette transporters, Asp1084 may be critical for interaction between the cytoplasmic loop connecting TM13 and TM14 and a region of nucleotide binding domain 2 between the conserved Walker A and ABC signature motifs.

In addition, these studies provided evidence for cross-talk between residues in the two TM helices (39Zhang D.W. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. J. Biol.

TM17 of MRP1 is topologically equivalent to TM12 of P-gp, which has been shown to be intimately involved in substrate binding and determination of substrate specificity (41Hafkemeyer P. Dey S.

Similarly, TM 14 corresponds to TM 9 of P-gp, but the involvement of residues in this helix in determining substrate specificity or overall activity has only recently been identified (42Loo T.W.

In addition to Glu1089, TM14 of MRP1 contains two charged residues, Asp1084 and Lys1092, as well as four amino acid residues with polar side chains (Fig. 1). We have now characterized the role of all of these residues in determining the substrate specificity and/or overall activity of MRP1. These studies demonstrate that Lys1092, Ser1097, and Asn1100, which are all predicted to be on the same face of the helix, are important for defining the substrate specificity of MRP1 and that Asp1084 is critical for its overall activity. We also show that proteins in which Asp1084 has been mutated to non-carboxylic amino acids retain the ability to bind LTC4 with high affinity but are unable to shift into a low affinity binding state in the presence of ATP and vanadate. Finally, we demonstrate that the inability of the Asp1084 mutant protein to enter a transition state is attributable to a defect in the ability of NBD2 to hydrolyze ATP, as evidenced by a loss of vanadate-dependent trapping of ADP at this NBD.

Cell Lines and Tissue Culture—Stable transfection of HEK293 cells with the pCEBV7 vector containing the wild type and mutant MRP1 cDNAs has been described previously (13Stride B.D. Grant C.E.

Briefly, HEK293 cells were transfected with pCEBV7 vectors containing mutant MRP1 using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. After ∼48 h, the transfected cells were supplemented with fresh medium containing 100 μg/ml hygromycin B. Approximately 3 weeks after transfection, the hygromycin B-resistant cells were cloned by limiting dilution and the resulting cell lines were tested for high level expression of the mutant proteins. Confocal Microscopy—Confocal microscopy was carried out as described previously (37Zhang D.W. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. J. Biol.

Briefly, ∼5 × 105 stably-transfected HEK293 cells were seeded in each well of a 6-well tissue culture dish on coverslips. When the cells had grown to confluence, they were washed once in PBS and then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS, followed by permeabilization using digitonin (0.25 mg/ml in PBS). MRP1 proteins were detected with the monoclonal antibody MRPm6. Antibody binding was detected with Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Fab′)2 fragment. Nuclei were stained with propidium iodide. Localization of MRP1 in the transfected cells was determined using a Meridian Insight confocal microscope (filter, 620/40 nm for propidium iodide and 530/30 nm for Fluor 488). Determination of Protein Levels in Transfected Cells—Plasma membrane vesicles were prepared by centrifugation through sucrose, as described previously (13Stride B.D. Grant C.E. Loe D.W. Hipfner D.R.

After determination of protein levels by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), total membrane protein (0.5, 1.0, and 1.25 μg) from transfectants expressing wild type MRP1 and various mutant proteins were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using a 7.5% gel. Proteins were subsequently transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) by electroblotting. The proteins were detected with mAb MRPm6 (Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA). Antibody binding was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Pierce), followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection and X-Omat™ Blue XB-1 films (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Densitometry of the film images was performed using a Chemi-Imager™ 4000 (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). The relative protein expression levels were calculated by dividing the integrated densitometry values obtained for 0.5, 1.0, and 1.25 μg of total membrane proteins from transfectants expressing the mutant proteins by the integrated densitometry values obtained for the comparable amounts of total membrane proteins from transfectants expressing the wild type protein. Each comparison was performed at least three times in independent experiments. The results were then pooled and the mean values used for normalization purposes. Expression of the NH 2 - and the COOH-proximal Half-molecules of MRP1 in SF21 Cells—The construction of the dual expression vector pFASTBAC Dual (Invitrogen) encoding the NH2- and the COOH-proximal half-molecules of MRP1 has been described previously (45Gao M.

To generate MRP1D1084N-pFASTBAC Dual vector, pCEBV7-MRP1 containing mutation D1084N was digested with BstEII, and an ∼600-bp fragment comprising nucleotides 3369-3913 of MRP1D1084N was isolated. This fragment was then ligated to an ∼9.4-kb fragment isolated from BstEII-digested MRP1-pFASTBAC Dual vector. Recombinant bacmids and baculoviruses were generated as described previously (45Gao M.

Plasma membrane vesicles were prepared, and the expression levels of wild type and mutant protein in infected cells were determined, as described previously (13Stride B.D. Grant C.E. Loe D.W.

The NH2-proximal proteins were detected with mAb MRPr1 (Alexis Biochemicals), and the COOH-proximal proteins were detected with mAb MRPm6 (Alexis Biochemicals). LTC 4 , E 2 17βG, and GSH Transport by Membrane Vesicles—Plasma membrane vesicles were prepared as described previously, and ATP-dependent transport of [3H]LTC4 into the inside-out membrane vesicles was measured by a rapid filtration technique (16Loe D.W.

Briefly, vesicles (10 μg of total proteins) were incubated at 23 °C in 100 μl of transport buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm sucrose, 0.02% sodium azide, pH 7.4) containing ATP or AMP (4 mm), 10 mm MgCl2 and [3H]LTC4 (50 nm, 200 nCi). At the indicated times, 20-μl aliquots were removed and added to 1 ml of ice-cold transport buffer, followed by filtration under vacuum through glass fiber filters (type A/E, Gelman Sciences, Dorval, Quebec, Canada). Filters were immediately washed twice with 4 ml of cold transport buffer. The bound radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. All data were corrected for the amount of [3H]LTC4 that remained bound to the filter in the absence of vesicle protein (usually <5% of the total radioactivity). [3H]LTC4 uptake was expressed relative to the total protein concentration in each reaction. ATP-dependent uptake of [3H]E217βG (400 nm, 120 nCi) was measured as described for [3H]LTC4 except that the reaction was carried out at 37 °C. K m and V max values of ATP-dependent [3H]LTC4 uptake by membrane vesicles (2.5 μg of total proteins) were measured at various LTC4 concentrations (0.01-1 μm) for 1 min at 23 °C. in 25 μl of transport buffer containing 4 mm ATP and 10 mm MgCl2, followed by non-linear regression analyses. Kinetic parameters of ATP-dependent [3H]E217βG (0.1-16 μm) uptake were determined as described for [3H]LTC4 except that the reaction was carried out at 37 °C. GSH uptake was also measured by rapid filtration with membrane vesicles (20 μg of total proteins) incubated at 37 °C for 20 min in a 60-μl reaction volume with [3H]GSH (100 μm, 300 nCi). To minimize GSH catabolism by γ-glutamyltranspeptidase during transport, membranes were preincubated in 0.5 mm acivicin for 10 min at 37 °C prior to measuring [3H]GSH uptake in the presence of verapamil (100 μm). Photoaffinity Labeling of the Wild Type and Mutant Proteins with [3H]LTC 4 —Wild-type and mutant MRP1 membrane proteins were photolabeled with [3H]LTC4 essentially as described previously (16Loe D.W.

Briefly, membrane vesicles (50 μg of total proteins in 35 μl of transport buffer) were incubated with [3H]LTC4 (0.3 μCi, 200 nm) at room temperature for 10 min, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and UV-irradiated. Proteins were analyzed on a 5-15% gradient gel by SDS-PAGE. The gel was then fixed, treated with Amplify (Amersham Biosciences), dried, and exposed to film for 1 week at -70 °C. Photolabeling of MRP1 by 8-Azido-[α-32P]ATP and Orthovanadate-induced Trapping of 8-Azido-[α-32P]ATP by MRP1—Wild-type and mutant MRP1 membrane proteins were photolabeled with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP essentially as described previously (45Gao M.

Here we demonstrate that the TR4 orphan nuclear receptor (TR4) can induce apoE expression in HepG2 cells. This TR4-mediated regulation of apoE gene expression was further confirmed in vivo using TR4 knockout mice. Both serum apoE protein and liver apoE mRNA levels were significantly reduced in TR4 knockout mice. Gel shift and luciferase reporter gene assays further demonstrated that TR4 can induce apoE gene expression via a TR4 response element located in the hepatic control region that is 15 kb downstream of the apoE gene. Furthermore our in vivo data from TR4 knockout mice prove that TR4 can also regulate apolipoprotein C-I and C-II gene expression via the TR4 response element within the hepatic control region.

ApoE is an important constituent of plasma lipoproteins, such as very low density lipoprotein and chylomicrons, and serves as a ligand for the receptor-mediated uptake of these lipoproteins by the liver (3Mahley R.W.

Previous studies using transgenic mice show that in liver, the major source of plasma apoE, the expression of apoE, apoC-I, apoC-IV, and apoC-II are promoted by liver-specific enhancers called hepatic control regions (HCR-1 and HCR-2) (8Simonet W.S.

However, the molecular mechanism controlling HCR regulation of apoE expression in liver remains unclear. Recently apoC-II, one of the members of the apoE/C-I/C-IV/C-II gene cluster, was shown to be induced by farnesoid X receptor (FXR)/RXRα heterodimer via HCRs (11Kast H.R. Nguyen C.M. Sinal C.J.

However, further study will be needed to determine whether the FXR/RXRα heterodimer also regulates the expression of other apolipoproteins (apoE, apoC-I, and apoC-IV) within the apoE/C-I/C-IV/C-II gene cluster. Members of the nuclear receptor superfamily are transcription factors that regulate gene expression through binding to specific DNA sequences known as hormone response elements (HREs). These nuclear receptors include those for steroids, thyroid hormones, vitamin D3, and retinoids as well as a large number of orphan receptors with no known ligands (12Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C.

A particular member of the nuclear receptor family, the TR4 orphan nuclear receptor (TR4), is able to regulate the expression of target genes through binding to DR AGGTCA core motif sequences with variable numbers of spacer nucleotides (13Lee H.J.

To understand the physiological role of TR4, we sought to identify TR4 target genes based on the response element binding preferences of the receptor. In vitro binding assays showed that TR4 has the highest affinity for DR1 elements, and we found a DR1 site in the HCR-1, which represents a potential TR4 response element (TR4RE). We hypothesize that the apoE gene, regulated by HCR-1, is a TR4 target gene. Transcription factors and their effects on gene expression have largely been studied via in vitro binding and transfection assays in cultured cells. However, many genes have multiple response elements for different transcription factors, including nuclear receptors. Nuclear receptors have overlapping binding sites in many genes and often compete with other transcription factors for the same binding site under particular conditions (19Galson D.L. Tsuchiya T.

Here we demonstrate that TR4 can regulate apoE expression via a DR1 element in the HCR-1 of the apoE/C-I/C-IV/C-II gene cluster and have further confirmed the role of TR4 in vivo through analysis of TR4 knockout (TR4KO) mice. Moreover, consistent with previous transgenic mouse studies showing HCR-based gene regulation, TR4 is able to modulate the expression of apoC-I and apoC-II via binding to a response element within the HCR of the apoE/C-I/C-IV/C-II gene cluster.

The apoE 5′ promoter region consisting of –1046 to +872 bp was amplified by PCR from the 11.1-kb human apoE gene, including 5.7 kb of the 5′-flanking sequence and 1.9 kb of the 3′-flanking sequence, and cloned into pGL3-Luc (Promega) to generate pGL-apoE-Luc. We first generated pGL-TK-Luc by cloning the thymidine kinase (TK) promoter (–32 to +48 bp) into pGL3-Luc (Promega). HCR-1 was amplified by PCR from HepG2 genomic DNA and subcloned into pGL-TK-Luc or pGL-apoE-Luc to generate pGL-TK-HCR-1-Luc and pGL-apoE/HCR-1-Luc, respectively. Synthesized DR1 and mutant (mt) DR1 oligonucleotides were subcloned into pGL-TK-Luc to create pGL-TK-(DR1)3-Luc and pGL-TK-mt(DR1)3-Luc, respectively. Immunohistochemistry—Two-month-old C57BL6J mice under pentobarbital anesthesia were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. The liver was removed after adequate perfusion, and then it was further fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 6 h. After processing and embedding in paraffin, tissue blocks were cut for staining. The liver sections were rehydrated, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 30 min, blocked in 10% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min, and immunostained using the EnVision+ system (Dako, Carpinteria, CA). The primary antibody was a rabbit anti-TR4 polyclonal antibody (150-fold dilution). Preimmune rabbit serum (150-fold dilution) was used as a negative control in adjacent sections. After staining, the sections were developed using a 3,3′-diaminobenzidine substrate kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Nuclear counterstain was performed with Gill's hematoxylin (Thermo-Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA) in all sections. Cell Culture and Transfections—HepG2 and COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Transfections were performed by using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (14Young W.J. Smith S.M. Chang C. J. Biol.

Metabolic Labeling of Cells and Immunoprecipitation—HepG2 cells were plated at 5 × 105 cells/60-mm dish and transfected with TR4 expression vector or empty vector (pCMX-TR4 or pCMX). After 16 h of transfection, the medium was changed, and cells were grown for another 12 h for recovery. Cells were incubated with serum- and methionine (Met)-free Dulbecco's minimum essential medium for 1 h and then pulse-labeled for 45 min with [35S]Met at 150 μCi/ml in medium. After incubation, the medium was collected, and cells were lysed by addition of 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.5, 15 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Proteins newly synthesized in cell lysates and secreted into the medium were determined using trichloroacetic acid precipitation, and the required amount of each sample was aliquoted into a new tube. The volume of each sample was adjusted to 1 ml with lysis buffer, and samples were immunoprecipitated with an anti-apoE polyclonal antibody (Calbiochem). The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and radiolabeled apoE was quantified using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Western Blot Analysis—Serum samples were tested for the presence of apoE by Western blot analyses. Samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred from the gel to Immobilon P transfer membrane (Millipore). ApoE was resolved using an anti-apoE polyclonal antibody (Chemicon) and an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad), and then the relative amount of each sample was quantified using a VersaDoc imaging system (Bio-Rad). RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from wild-type and TR4KO mouse livers using TriZol reagent (Invitrogen), and RT-PCR was carried out using the SuperScript™ II (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Briefly, after denaturation for 5 min at 65 °C in the presence of 0.5 μg of random hexamers, 3 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed for 1 h at 43 °C with 200 units of SuperScript II in a 20-μl reaction (containing a 0.5 mm concentration of each dNTP). Two micro-liters of the cDNA sample were used as template for PCR amplification with a forward primer (5′-CAGCAGTTCATCCTAACCAGCCC-3′) specific to a region of exon 3 present in the TR4 gene in wild-type mice as well as in the targeting construct present in TR4KO mice and a reverse primer (5′-CTGCTCCGACAGCTGTAGGTC-3′) specific to a region of exon 5 replaced by the targeting construct in TR4KO mice. Hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase expression was analyzed (primers: forward, 5′-GCTGGTGAAAAGGACCTCT-3′; reverse, 5′-CACAGGACTAGAACACCTGC-3′) as an internal control in the same run. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated using TriZol reagent (Invitrogen), and Northern blots were performed as described previously (16Lee Y.F. Young W.J. Burbach J.P. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13437-13443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). An apoE probe was prepared from human apoE cDNA by AatII and DraIII digestion. Probes for mouse apoC-I (GenBank™ accession number NM_007469), apoC-II (GenBank™ accession number NM_009695), β-actin, and 18 S rRNA were generated by RT-PCR. Membrane-immobilized mRNA was hybridized with radiolabeled cDNA probes, and hybridization signals were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Ratios of apoE, apoC-I, and apoC-II mRNA levels relative to either 18 S rRNA or β-actin were calculated. Gel Shift Assay—Gel shift assays were performed as described previously (14Young W.J. Smith S.M. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3109-3116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) with the use of in vitro translated proteins or HepG2 nuclear extracts and 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes. The following oligonucleotides were used in gel shift assays: TR4RE-DR1-apoE (5′-CTTGGGGCAGAGGTCAGAG-3′), mutated (underlined) TR4RE-DR1-apoE (5′-CTTGCCGCAGACCTCAGAG-3′), and the DR1/inverted repeat 1 (IR1) element (5′-CTTGGGGCAGAGGTCAGAGACCTCTC-3′). For the antibody supershift assays, an anti-TR4 mouse monoclonal antibody was added to the reaction. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 5% native gel and analyzed by PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). TR4 Induces ApoE Gene Expression in Vitro—TR4 has been shown to be highly expressed in rat primary hepatocytes (18Yan Z.H. Karam W.G. Staudinger J.L. Medvedev A. Ghanayem B.I. Jetten A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10948-10957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To verify the physiological relevance for studying the effect of TR4 on hepatic apoE expression, we performed staining of mouse liver tissue with a rabbit polyclonal antibody specific to the N-terminal domain of TR4. In mouse liver sections, the anti-TR4 antibody stained both the cytoplasm and nuclei of hepatocytes with stronger staining in the nuclei compared with the cytoplasm (Fig. 1, A and C, arrows). We also performed staining of adjacent sections with preimmune rabbit serum as a negative control to show whether this staining is TR4-specific. As shown in Fig. 1, B and D, only a weak background appears when staining with preimmune serum. These results supported our interest in further characterizing the potential regulation of hepatic apoE gene expression by TR4. We then applied a pulse labeling assay in HepG2 cells, transfected with either a TR4 expression vector or an empty vector, to study the effect of TR4 on apoE expression. After transfection and overnight recovery, cells were pulsed with [35S]Met for 45 min, and the levels of newly synthesized apoE were determined by immunoprecipitation using an anti-apoE antibody. As shown in Fig. 1E, addition of TR4 can significantly increase apoE protein expression. This induction was further confirmed at the mRNA level using Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1F, the level of apoE mRNA was higher in HepG2 cells transfected with a TR4 expression vector than in empty vector-transfected HepG2 cells. Together the data from Fig. 1 demonstrate that TR4 can induce apoE expression at both the protein and mRNA levels. Hepatic Control Region Contains a TR4 Response Element— Human hepatic control regions (HCR-1 and HCR-2) were identified in the studies of apoE/C-I/C-IV/C-II gene expression using transgenic mice (8Simonet W.S. Bucay N. Lauer S.J. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8221-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Allan C.M. Walker D. Taylor J.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 29113-29119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). HCR-1 and HCR-2 have 85% nucleotide identity and are located 18.4 and 29.4 kb downstream of the apoE transcription initiation site, respectively (Fig. 2A). In studies with transgenic mice, HCRs have been shown to have critical roles in the regulation of hepatic expression of the apoE/C-I/C-IV/C-II gene cluster. Within the entire HCR-1 774-bp region, the 319 bp at the 5′ terminus confer full HCR-1 functional activity (27Dang Q. Walker D. Taylor S. Allan C. Chin P. Fan J. Taylor J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22577-22585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and sequence analysis demonstrated that this 319-bp region contains a DR1 element. Of the DR elements recognized by TR4, the receptor binds to DR1 sequences with the highest affinity (13Lee H.J. Lee Y. Burbach J.P. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30129-30133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 14Young W.J. Smith S.M. Chang C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 16198-16205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We next performed a gel shift assay to determine that this DR1 element (GGGGCAGAGGTCA named TR4RE-DR1-apoE; core motifs are underlined) functions as a TR4RE. As shown in Fig. 2B, in vitro translated TR4 protein formed a specific complex with 32P-labeled TR4RE-DR1-apoE. In contrast, the mock-translated control lysate was unable to form a complex with the DR1 element (left panel, lane 2 versus lane 1, open arrowhead). The TR4-TR4RE complex could be abolished by unlabeled TR4RE-DR1-apoE but not by mutated, unlabeled TR4RE-DR1-apoE (lane 3 versus lane 4). Moreover a supershift of the specific TR4-DR1 complex was achieved by addition of an anti-TR4 antibody (lane 5, closed arrowhead), further indicating that the TR4RE-DR1-apoE is a specific binding site for TR4. We confirmed the specific TR4-DR1 interaction when we replaced in vitro translated TR4 with HepG2 cell nuclear extracts containing endogenous TR4 (Fig. 2B, right panel). This result also confirms that TR4 protein is present in liver cells. We then used luciferase reporter assays to test whether TR4 regulates apoE gene expression through interaction with the HCR-1 region. We first linked HCR-1 to TK-luciferase (pGL-TK-HCR-1-Luc) and tested whether TR4 has any influence on the transcriptional activity of a reporter regulated by HCR-1. This construct shows high basal transcriptional activity in HepG2 cells, and co-transfection of a TR4 expression vector (pCMX-TR4) can induce luciferase activity (Fig. 2C, lane 1 versus lane 2). In contrast, the reporter construct showed very low basal transcriptional activity in COS-1 cells with significantly increased luciferase activity upon addition of the TR4 expression vector (Fig. 2C, lane 3 versus lane 4). The difference in the basal activity of the reporter in HepG2 versus COS-1 cells could be due to variation in the availability of endogenous TR4 and cooperation between endogenous TR4 and other liver-specific transcription factors to modulate HCR-1-regulated gene expression in HepG2 cells. We next addressed whether the proximal promoter of the apoE gene has any effect on HCR-1 activity. Either pGL-apoE-Luc, containing the apoE gene promoter (–1046/+872 bp) only, or pGL-apoE/HCR-1-Luc, containing the apoE gene promoter fused with the HCR-1 region, were transfected into HepG2 cells in the absence or presence of the TR4 expression vector. TR4 was found to enhance the transcriptional activity of apoE promoter and apoE promoter/HCR-1-driven luciferase reporters (Fig. 2D). However, we were unable to see any further enhancement of the TR4 effect on HCR-1 activity by addition of the apoE proximal promoter (Fig. 2, C versus D). Although TR4 stimulates apoE promoter activity, the induced promoter activity was even lower than the basal activity of pGL-apoE/HCR-1-Luc. This suggests that the apoE promoter may not have an important role in hepatic expression of the apoE gene. Indeed previous reports have indicated that the apoE promoter has no significant role in hepatic apoE expression (8Simonet W.S. Bucay N. Lauer S.J. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8221-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Allan C.M. Walker D. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26278-26281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 10Allan C.M. Taylor S. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29113-29119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The apoE promoter may have potential TR4 binding sites as suggested by reporter gene assay even though the promoter activity does not have a significant effect on hepatic apoE expression. To define the role of TR4 relative to non-tissue-specific apoE promoter function, further study will be needed. To further confirm that TR4RE-DR1-apoE within the HCR-1 region can mediate TR4 induction of apoE expression in hepatic cells, we co-transfected a reporter with three copies of the TR4-DR1-apoE element (pGL-TK-(DR1)3-Luc). Luciferase activity was expressed based on the induction -fold relative to transfection of empty vector (pCMX, set as 1.0-fold) in each reporter gene assay. As demonstrated in Fig. 3, TR4 was able to significantly activate this pGL-TK-(DR1)3-Luc reporter in HepG2 and COS-1 cells (lane 3 versus lane 4). In contrast, TR4 only had marginal induction effects when we replaced TR4RE-DR1-apoE with mutated TR4RE-DR1-apoE (pGL-TK-(mtDR1)3-Luc) or with parent reporter plasmid (pGL-TK-Luc). Together these data strongly suggest that the DR1 element in HCR-1 is a TR4 response element important for TR4-induced transcriptional activation of the apoE gene. ApoE Expression Is Reduced in TR4KO Mouse Liver—Recently we generated TR4KO mice (in collaboration with Lexicon Genetics Inc.) by the insertion of a LacZ/Neo selection cassette between exons 4 and 5 of the TR4 gene. 2L. L. Collins, Y.-F. Lee, W.-J. Lin, C. A. Heinlein, N.-C. Liu, Y.-Ts. Chen, Y.-T. Chen, C.-R. Shyr, C. K. Meshul, H. Uno, S. M. Chou, K. A. Platt, and C. Chang, manuscript in preparation. RT-PCR analysis of total RNAs from wild-type and TR4KO mouse liver tissues confirmed the deletion of TR4 gene exons 4 and 5 in homozygous TR4KO mouse liver tissues (Fig. 4A). To determine whether TR4 could also regulate apoE expression in vivo, we examined apoE expression in wild-type (Fig. 4B, lanes 1, 3, and 5) and TR4KO mice (Fig. 4B, lanes 2, 4, and 6). From Northern blot analysis using three sets of wild-type and TR4KO mouse liver total RNAs, it was found that TR4KO apoE mRNA levels were reduced to 70% of those in wild-type mice (Fig. 4, B and D, left panel). Western blot analysis of serum apoE protein revealed that serum apoE levels of TR4KO mice were decreased by about 50% compared with wild-type serum apoE levels (Fig. 4, C and D, right panel). Considering that most apoE present in the serum is derived from the liver, the low level of serum apoE protein in TR4KO mice could be a result of the reduction of apoE mRNA expression in the liver. In vivo data collected from TR4KO mice confirm our in vitro data from HepG2 cells, which show that TR4 can induce apoE expression. Influence of Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4 (HNF-4) on TR4-induced ApoE Expression—Many nuclear receptors are able to bind to DR1-HRE sites, although the relative binding affinity could be influenced by the nucleotide sequences of core motifs as well as the spacer nucleotide within the particular DR1-HRE (34Nakshatri H. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2491-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 35Fraser J.D. Martinez V. Straney R. Briggs M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2702-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). One of these nuclear receptors is HNF-4. We were interested in determining the relative influence of TR4 and HNF-4 on apoE expression. As shown in Fig. 5A, TR4 highly induced transcriptional activity of the reporter gene (pGL-TK-(DR1)3-Luc), whereas HNF-4 showed only a marginal effect on this reporter gene. To explore the mechanism of the differential induction effects of TR4 and HNF-4 on apoE expression, we performed gel shift assays. As shown in Fig. 5B, in vitro translated TR4 could strongly bind to 32P-TR4RE-DR1-apoE (lane 2, open arrowhead). However, we can only see a very weak binding complex consisting of HNF-4 and TR4RE-DR1-apoE when we replaced in vitro translated TR4 with in vitro translated HNF-4 (lane 3, arrow). Previous reports have demonstrated that changing the spacer nucleotide from A to G reduces the affinity of HNF-4 for DR1-HRE (34Nakshatri H. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2491-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 35Fraser J.D. Martinez V. Straney R. Briggs M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2702-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This suggests that the nucleotide sequence of TR4RE-DR1-apoE may contribute to weak binding affinity for HNF-4.

The Extra Sex Combs-Enhancer of Zeste complex is expressed early in embryogenesis and is thought to play a role in the initiation of silencing. The Extra Sex Combs-Enhancer of Zeste complex catalyzes the modification of chromatin. It has histone deacetylase activity and can also methylate lysine residues in histones. Some of these modifications, such as the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27, facilitate the binding of the PRC1 complex to chromatin. The PRC1 complex is involved in the maintenance of repression and can block chromatin remodeling by SWI/SNF helicases (4Shao Z. Raible F. Mollaaghababa R. Guyon J.R. Wu C.T. Bender W. Kingston R.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 37-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). The product of the PcG gene Sex Comb on Midleg (SCM) copurifies with PRC1 and colocalizes with the PSC gene product on polythene chromosomes (9Franke A. DeCamillis M.A. Zink D. Cheng N. Brock H.W. Paro R. EMBO. 1992; 11: 2941-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). SCM plays a key role in PcG repression of gene expression, as embryos deficient in both maternal and zygotic copies of the gene die with severe homeotic transformations (10Jones C.A. Ng J. Peterson A.J. Morgan K. Simon J. Jones R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2825-2834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Jones R.S. Gelbart W.M. Genetics. 1990; 126: 185-199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SCM protein consists of a C-terminal sterile α motif (SAM) domain and two ∼100 amino acid repeats in the N-terminal portion of the protein (12Bornemann D. Miller E. Simon J. Development. 1996; 122: 1621-1630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The product of the D. melanogaster tumor suppressor gene lethal (3Satijn D.P. Otte O.P. Mol. Cell.

Takebayashi S. Okumura K. Saya H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3799-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Because of their occurrence in this protein, these repeats have been termed malignant brain tumor (MBT) repeats. A third D. melanogaster protein containing four repeats has also been identified. Proteins with similar domain organizations are found in mammals. The SAM domain of SCM has been shown to bind to the SAM domain of PC and is probably responsible for the recruitment of SCM to the PRC1 complex (14Peterson A.J. Kyba M. Bornemann D. Morgan K. Brock H.W. Simon J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6683-6692Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The role of the MBT repeats is less clear. Several SCM mutant alleles map within the MBT repeats, suggesting that they have an important role (15Bornemann D. Miler E. Simon J. Genetics. 1998; 150: 675-686PubMed Google Scholar). The MBT repeat region of human lethal (3Satijn D.P. Otte O.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) MBT has been shown to be required for transcriptional repression, although the molecular basis for this activity is not known (16Boccuni P. MacGrogan D. Scandura J.M. Nimer S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15412-15420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To try to learn more about the function of MBT repeats, we have determined the crystal structure of an N-terminal fragment, a human homologue of SCM called SCML2, containing two MBT repeats in tandem. Cloning of the Gene—The SCML2 MBT repeats were cloned from a human multiple tissue cDNA library (Clontech) with 5′- and 3′-end primers containing BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites, respectively. Three clones were made, i.e. MBT 1 (Gly23–Tyr134), MBT 2 (Trp141–Ser243) and MBT (1 + 2) (Gly23–Ser243) (Gly23 is a result of having BamHI as the restriction site). The resulting PCR products were ligated into the cloning sites of modified mini-pRSET (A) with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The wild-type MBT (1 + 2) protein had an internal thrombin cleavage site. Hence, the mutant K147E was made using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). Protein Expression and Purification—The plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli C-41 host cells and grown on a tryptone/yeast extract (TY)-agar plate containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. A single colony of each clone was used to inoculate 1 ml of 2× TY medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. These cultures were added to inoculate 1 liter of 2× TY medium with ampicillin. The cultures were incubated in a shaker at 37 °C until it reached an OD600 of 0.8. Expressions were induced with 0.1 m isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the bacteria were harvested after 4 h at 37 °C by centrifugation. MBT 1, MBT 2, and the pseudo-wild-type MBT (1 + 2) proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen). Bound protein was cut with thrombin and loaded on a second nickel column. The untagged protein eluted without binding to the affinity column. The concentrated protein (12 mg/ml) was applied to a Superdex 75 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) for final purification and characterization. Crystallization of Native and Heavy Atom Derivatives—Sitting drops containing 3 μl of 12 mg/ml mutant (K147E) MBT (1 + 2) protein in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 5 mm dithiothreitol were mixed with equal volumes of reservoir buffer containing 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 15.6% PEG 4000, and 50 mm MgCl2. Clustered plate-like crystals were obtained in 5 days at 4 °C. Crystals were sensitive to temperature. Single crystals were obtained by seeding. The crystals contain one molecule of the MBT repeat per asymmetric unit and belong to the space group C2 (a = 118.76 Å, b = 47.70 Å, c = 41.49 Å, α = 90°, β = 100.29°, and γ = 90°). Crystals were cryo-protected in reservoir buffer with additional 20% PEG 2000 prior to stream freezing. Heavy atom derivatives were prepared by soaking the crystals in 10 mm heavy atom solutions made in the reservoir buffer enriched to 20% PEG 4000 for 3 h. Mercury and platinum derivatives were made using ethylmercurithiosalicylic acid (Hg (II)) and K2PtCl4 (Pt (II)) solutions, respectively. Diffraction Data Collection—Native and derivative data were collected using the MAR 345 imaging plate detector system (MAR-Research, Hamburg, Germany) and mounted on a Rigaku RUH3R generator. Data processing and integration was done using MOSFLM (17Leslie A. Recent Changes to the MOSFLM Package for Processing Film and Image Plate Data. SERC Laboratory, Daresbury, Warrington, United Kingdom1991Google Scholar) and SCALA (18Kabsch K. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1988; 21: 916-924Crossref Scopus (1683) Google Scholar). Structure Solution—Crystallographic calculations were carried out using the CCP4 program suite (19Project C.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19769) Google Scholar). The structure was solved using Molecular Isomorphous Replacement with Anomalous Scattering (MIRAS). Phases were obtained using heavy atom derivatives and calculated using SOLVE (20Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). RESOLVE was used for solvent flattening assuming a 50% solvent content (21Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar). Electron density maps were built by MAIN (22Turk D. Weiterentwicklung eines Programms fuer Molekuelgraphik und Elektrondichte-Manipulation und seine Anwendung auf verschiedene Protein-Struckturaufklaerungen. Technische Universität München, Munich, Germany1992Google Scholar), and the structure calculations and refinement were done by CNS (23Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J-S Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). Stability of the MBT Repeats—Of the three proteins expressed, only MBT (1 + 2) (Gly23–Ser243) could be purified. MBT 1 (Gly23–Tyr134) could be expressed but aggregated upon thrombin cleavage. MBT 2 (Trp141–Ser243) did not express well. The wild-type protein MBT (1 + 2) was prone to degradation by thrombin, which was identified by SDS gel and analyzed by mass spectrometry. The protein fragments could not be separated from the full-length protein. The mutant K147E, at the thrombin-cleavage site, gave pure protein for further studies and yielded crystals. The wild-type protein did not give any crystals, probably because of the inseparable cleavage product. Crystal Structure—The crystal structure of the pseudo-wild-type of the two MBT repeats was solved to a resolution of 1.78Å using MIRAS. The crystallographic data are presented in Table I. Electron density for the first ten residues (Gly23–Asp32) at the N terminus and four residues (Met136–Ser139) in the linker region is missing. The final refinement gave 308 water molecules and one PEG molecule in an asymmetric unit. 92.3% of residues are present in the maximum allowed region and none in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot. The final structure has a Rfree value of 20.4, a Rwork value of 17.1, and an overall temperature factor of 16.09. The model has root mean square deviation in bond length of 0.004 Å and in bond angle of 1.30°.

Each repeat consists of an extended “arm” and a globular core. The arm of the first repeat packs against the core of the second repeat and vice versa. The structure of the core-interacting part of each arm consists of an N-terminal α-helix and a turn of 310 helix connected by a short β-strand. The core consists of an Src homology 3-like five-stranded β-barrel followed by a C-terminal α-helix and another short β-strand. Each arm interacts with its partner core in a similar way, with the orientation of the N-terminal helix relative to the barrel varying slightly. There are also extensive interactions between the two barrels. Thus, the two repeats form one inter-linked structural unit, which explains why it was not possible to express them individually. The interaction between the arm and the core units is reminiscent of “domain swapping” in homo-oligomeric proteins (24Liu Y. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1285-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 25Rousseau F. Schymkowitz J.W. Itzhaki L.S. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 243-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The two barrels contact each other non-symmetrically using different sides. The residues in the barrel interface are hydrophobic and generally conserved in MBT repeats, suggesting that the formation of other multi-repeat structures may involve similar barrel interfaces and arm exchanges. These packing arrangements can easily accommodate three or four repeats and are likely to occur in all MBT repeat-containing proteins. A third repeat can readily be added to the present structure without steric clashes, and the addition of two repeats requires only minor adjustments of the observed barrel interface. The assembly of three or four repeats would form a ring-like structure with the N-terminal arm packing against the C-terminal barrel and the other arms packing against the preceding barrel. A model of the assembly of four repeats is shown in Fig. 1B. The three-repeat model is consistent with the experimental structure published after the submission of this paper (26Wang W.K. Tereshko V. Boccuni P. MacGrogan D. Nimer S.D. Patel D.J. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 775-789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Conserved residues are distributed throughout the repeat within both the barrel and the N-terminal extension. There are a number of conserved glycine and proline residues in the extensions situated where the polypeptide chain changes direction, indicating that the conformation of these regions is conserved (Fig. 1C). Conserved hydrophobic residues are present both within the core of the barrel and in the N-terminal and C-terminal extensions. The high degree of sequence conservation in the N-terminal extension suggests that it is present in all MBT repeats. There is a highly conserved glutamate in the first strand of the barrel (see alignment in Figs. 1C and 2), which was suggested previously to have a functional role. This residue hydrogen bonds to the N terminus of the C-terminal helix and appears to play a critical structural role in the formation of the arm-binding surface. Most of other residues in the repeats also appear to be conserved for structural reasons; for example, a lysine residue at the start of the first strand of the barrel and an aspartate residue at the end of the third strand form a salt bridge that stabilizes the barrel. The exceptions are Asp73 and Asp105, which have no apparent structural role and are presumably conserved for function (Fig. 1C). SCML2 has a high degree of sequence similarity with Drosophila SCM within the MBT repeats. Three Scm mutant alleles have been identified that map within the first MBT repeat of the protein (Fig. 3). One of these is an in-frame deletion that removes four amino acids at the C terminus of the repeat. This deletion is likely to have a significant effect on the packing of the repeats. The other two are missense mutations. In one of these, a conserved aspartate residue is changed to an asparagine. This is a very conservative mutation of a solvent exposed residue that does not appear to have a structural role. This strongly suggests that this residue is functionally important. In the other mutation, a buried valine in the hydrophobic core of the β-barrel is substituted to glutamate. This is likely to have a destabilizing effect on the domain and could cause a local disruption of the structure. Structural Similarities—Comparison of the structure of the MBT repeats to other protein structures by eye and by using the DALI (27Holm L. Sander C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar) server reveals a significant similarity within the β-barrel portion of the structure to the Tudor domain of the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein (53 residues) superimposed with an root mean square deviation of 1.4 Å and to the PWWP domain with 77 residues overlapping at an root mean square deviation of 3.1 Å (28Selenko P. Sprangers R. Stier G. Buhler D. Fischer U. Sattler M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 29Qiu C. Sawada K. Zhang X. Cheng X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 217-224PubMed Google Scholar, 30Slater L.M. Allen M.D. Bycroft M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; PubMed Google Scholar). This degree of structural similarity is in a good agreement with the prediction that the MBT, Tudor, and PWWP domains are all members of a homologous protein superfamily (29Qiu C. Sawada K. Zhang X. Cheng X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 217-224PubMed Google Scholar, 31Maurer-Stroh S. Dickens J. Huges-Davies L. Kouzarides T. Eisenhaber F. Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 69-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The Tudor and PWWP domains are not typically found in tandems, and the similarity does not extend to the N- and C-terminal extensions present in the MBT repeat. The most significant difference within the β-barrel of the MBT repeat compared with the Tudor and PWWP barrels is an insertion of two extra residues in the turn between the fourth and fifth strand (Fig. 2). This insertion widens the top of the MBT repeat barrel, resulting in the formation of a hydrophobic pocket that accommodates the conserved aromatic residue in the arm. The conservation of this insertion in the MBT repeats reiterates the importance of the MBT repeat assembly for their biological function. Although there is no identified ligand for MBT repeat proteins, it can be expected that at least two correctly positioned repeats will be required for the formation of the ligand-binding site. A hint to a possible biological function of MBT repeats is suggested by its structural and probable evolutionary relations. The PWWP domain is found in proteins associated with chromatin, suggesting that it may have a role in transcriptional regulation, although no biochemical role has been attributed to it. The Tudor domain is found in a range of proteins. There is some evidence that the SMN Tudor domain binds to methylated arginine residues. This interaction is mapped to the aromatic rich region involving the loops between the first and the second strands and in the third and fourth strands at the same end of the barrel (Fig. 4) (28Selenko P. Sprangers R. Stier G. Buhler D. Fischer U. Sattler M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The equivalent region in the PWWP domain contains several highly conserved residues, suggesting that it is functionally important in this module as well. Also, there is an important structural similarity between the Tudor and PWWP barrels and the complex of the chromo domain with a methylated lysine peptide from the histone H3 tail (Fig. 4) (32Nielsen P. Nietlispach D. Mott H.R. Callaghan J. Bannister A. Kouzarides T. Murzin A.G. Murzina N.V. Laue E.D. Nature. 2002; 416: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 33Jacobs S.A. Khorasanizadeh S. Science. 2002; 295: 2080-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). The histone peptide is bound in a β-strand conformation and occupies the site corresponding to the first strand of the common Tudor/PWWP/MBT barrel. The methylated lysine binds to a conserved aromatic pocket in the equivalent site to the proposed methylated arginine-binding site of the SMN Tudor domain. In the chromo domain complex, the conserved loop forming a part of the methylated lysine-binding site adopts a conformation close to that of the equivalent loop between the third and fourth strand of the MBT repeat barrel. In the MBT loop, there are three conserved aromatic residues, two of which are also conserved in the chromo and Tudor domains. These aromatic residues are conserved in some but not all MBT repeats; in SCML2 they are found in the second repeat only (Fig. 1C). In all MBT containing proteins, however, at least one of the repeats has aromatic residues in all these positions. The highly conserved aspartate residues that have been found to be important for SCM function in vivo are also located close to this site (Fig. 3). This would suggest that this binding site is important in the MBT domain as well. Although genetic results implicate the MBT repeats of SCM in the in vivo function of the protein, little is known about their biochemical role. Proteins containing mutations within the MBT repeat region are associated with their normal sites on polytene chromosomes. This suggests that the repeats are not involved in SCM localization. It is more likely that they provide a biochemical activity required for transcriptional silencing. Based on the structure of the repeats, it is unlikely that they have a catalytic role. Given their similarity to the Tudor and chromo domains, a binding role is more likely, in particular because the mutation of a residue in a putative binding site compromises the in vivo function. Post-translationally modified histones seem to be a probable binding target. The PRC1 complex is recruited to chromatin in which histone H3 has been methylated at lysine 27. This modification is thought to be recognized by the chromo domain of Polycomb. In Drosophila, Polycomb is involved in generating heterochromatin and repressing homeotic genes. It is has been shown that the Polycomb chromo domain is essential for the binding of the PC protein to chromatin and is probably involved in compacting the chromosomal proteins present in heterochromatin or heterochromatin-like complexes (34Messmer S. Franke A. Paro R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1241-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Arginine residues in histones are also known to be methylated. For example, symmetric dimethylation of histone tails by the protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT5 is known to be associated with transcriptional repression (35Branscombe T.L. Frankel A. Lee J.H. Cook J.R. Yang Z. Pestka S. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32971-32976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). No protein or domain responsible for the recognition of this modification has been reported to date. Because the MBT repeat is similar in structure to the Tudor domain implicated in the binding of methylated arginine peptides, it is possible that the MBT domains of SCM provide a link between arginine methylation of histones and the PRC1 complex (36Sprangers R. Groves M.R. Sinning I. Sattler M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 507-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Although it would appear that the binding function of SCM is not required for localization of the PRC1 complex, it may, under some circumstances, have a role in repression. The MBT domain is always found in a tandem of at least two repeats. It is possible that this arrangement is required to enable the protein to interact with multiple sites on chromatin that help to lock it into an inactive state. This scenario would fit with a model in which PRC1 function depends on chromatin modifications carried out by other complexes. Biochemical data suggest that SCM is not always part of the PRC1 complex. It is possible that arginine methylation and SCM are required for the repression of some targets in some tissues. Mammals have several SCM-like proteins, and it is likely that the regulation of PRC1 function is even more complex. The data presented here strongly suggest that MBT repeats have a binding function, probably to modified histones. Identification of the binding partners is likely to provide important insights into the regulation of transcriptional repression in cell memory."

Opposite to rats, in mice, channel mRNA and total protein increase in late pregnancy, but current density decreases as in rats. Here, we investigated the mechanism of these differences. Real time PCR and Western blots demonstrate that, in late pregnancy, channel transcript quantities and total protein were diminished in rats but up-regulated in mice. High resolution confocal microscopy of single myocytes showed that, in nonpregnant mice, channels were expressed in clusters at the surface membrane.

This contrasts with rat myometrium, where there is a reduction of channel transcripts and overall protein levels including the surface membrane. We conclude that large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel surface expression is reduced in both rat and mouse late pregnant myometrium.

MaxiK channels are highly expressed in uterine smooth muscle as a MaxiK channel-specific blocker, iberiotoxin, blocks the majority of outward K+ currents in myometrial cells from nonpregnant rats (1Anwer K.

Barila B. Toro L. Stefani E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In contrast, work performed in mouse myometrium showed the opposite, that total protein of crude membrane preparations and mRNA increase in late pregnancy (5Benkusky N.A. Fergus D.J. Zucchero T.M. England S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27712-27719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, in both rats (6Wang S.Y. Yoshino M. Sui J.L. Wakui M. Kao P.N. Kao C.Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 737-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and mice (5Benkusky N.A. Fergus D.J. Zucchero T.M. England S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27712-27719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), MaxiK current density that measures channel functional expression at the cell surface is diminished in late pregnancy. The reduction of MaxiK current density in late pregnant mice, regardless of its increase in total protein, was explained by a hypothetical change in the open probability of the channel via altered voltage/Ca2+ sensitivities (5Benkusky N.A. Fergus D.J. Zucchero T.M. England S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27712-27719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Here, we investigated the mechanism that controls MaxiK current density by systematically comparing in rats versus mice and nonpregnant versus late pregnant myometrium MaxiK mRNA quantities in conjunction with MaxiK protein levels and its subcellular distribution. Consistent with previous findings (4Song M. Zhu N. Olcese R. Barila B. Toro L. Stefani E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 5Benkusky N.A. Fergus D.J. Zucchero T.M. England S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27712-27719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), our results show that MaxiK mRNA and total protein levels change in opposite directions, being reduced in late pregnant rats but increased in late pregnant mice. However, high resolution confocal microscopy of single uterine myocytes showed that in late pregnant mice the up-regulated MaxiK protein was accumulated in perinuclear organelles with a lower MaxiK protein density at the surface membrane. Most importantly, MaxiK channels were forming distinct clusters at the surface membrane in nonpregnant myometrium that practically disappeared during late pregnancy. These observations indicate that in both rats and mice, MaxiK channel density at the plasma membrane of myometrial cells is reduced toward the end of pregnancy, preparing myometrium for delivery. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this effect is radically different in rats and mice. In rats, transcriptional down-regulation and associated diminished protein levels can explain the surface MaxiK channel reduction. In mice, the reduction of surface MaxiK channel expression is not correlated with MaxiK transcript and protein down-regulation, but it appears to be mainly due to altered channel trafficking, since high levels of MaxiK channel protein were localized in perinuclear organelles. Nonpregnant (NP; diestrus) and late pregnant (LP) rats (Sprague-Dawley) and mice (C57/BL) were used. Rats were 21–22 days pregnant, and mice were 19–20 days. Protocols received institutional review committee approval. Real Time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from NP and LP rat and mouse myometrium using the ToTALLY™ RNA isolation kit (Ambion). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified using the Oligotex™ mRNA purification system (Qiagen). Purified mRNA (20 ng) was reverse transcribed to single-stranded cDNA by priming with oligo(dT) (avian myeloblastosis virus; Roche Applied Science). The quality of cDNA was confirmed by the lack of detectable genomic DNA using primers flanking intronic regions of β-actin (forward primer, 5′-GGCTACAGCTTCACCACCAC-3′, nucleotides 2383–2402; reverse primer, 5′-TACTCCTGCTTGCTGATCCAC-3′, nucleotides 3071–3091, GenBank™ accession number V01217). Real time PCR (iCycler iQ Real Time PCR, Bio-Rad) was used for quantification of MaxiK and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA using SYBRgreen I (diluted at 1:80,000 from stock solution × 10,000) (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and Platinum Quantitative PCR SuperMix-udg (Invitrogen). Measurements were performed in triplicate. Controls included the reaction mixture without cDNA or plasmid DNA and transcript levels of the housekeeping gene, GAPDH. Specific primers were designed to have a similar melting point and to amplify segments of ∼200 base pairs of MaxiK and GAPDH. Specific products were detected as clear single peaks at their melting temperature in the first derivative of fluorescence (dF/dT) versus temperature plot (melting curve). As expected from the melting curve, a single band of the expected size was detected in agarose gel electrophoresis at the end of the reaction. Gene-specific primers were as follows: for MaxiK, forward primer 5′-CCATTAAGTCGGGCTGATTTAAG-3′ (nucleotides 2515–2537) and reverse primer 5′-CCTTGGGAATTAGCCTGCAAGA-3′ (nucleotides 2681–2702); for GAPDH, forward primer 5′-TCCTGCACCACCAACTGCTTAG-3′ (nucleotides 1294–1315) and reverse primer 5′-GATGACCTTGCCCACAGCCTTG-3′ (nucleotides 1485–1506) according to GenBank™ accession numbers U55995 (MaxiK) and AF106860 (GAPDH). The reaction conditions were as follows: 5 min at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 45 s, 61 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 45 s. GAPDH and MaxiK calibration curves were obtained using known concentrations of MaxiK (full-length clone) and GAPDH (200-bp amplicon). To obtain the standard curve, a threshold was assigned in the linear range of the fluorescence cycle number plot and plotted as a function of [cDNA]. The data were fitted to a straight line, where its slope is an indication of the reaction efficiency, and a slope of 3.32 represents 100% efficiency. Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a purified peptide corresponding to residues 883–896 (GenBank™ accession number U11058) of the human MaxiK channel α subunit (anti-α883–896 antibody) and a commercial antibody (Alomone Laboratories) raised against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein corresponding to residues 1098–1196 (GenBank™ accession number A48206) (anti-α1098–1196 antibody) were used. Both antibodies recognize rat and mouse MaxiK channels and can be blocked with the corresponding antigens. Vinculin monoclonal antibody was from Sigma. Myometrium Membrane Preparation and Western Blots—After scrapping off the endometrium, the myometrium was homogenized in 20 mm HEPES-KOH, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, pH 7.4, supplemented with 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min to obtain crude membranes. Membranes were suspended in 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, and treated with SDS loading buffer and dithiothreitol to a final concentration of 62.5 mm Tris-Cl, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 42 mm dithiothreitol and stored at –70 °C. Protein concentration was measured using the Bradford method (Pierce). Prestained molecular weight standards were from Invitrogen or from Li-Cor. Myometrial membrane proteins (5–40 μg) were separated by 6–10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions and electro-transferred to nitrocellulose paper. Blots analyzed with chemiluminescence were blocked with Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.1% Tween, pH 7.4) containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature. Thereafter, they were incubated with primary antibodies: anti-α883–896 (0.8 μg/ml) or anti-α1098–1196 (6 μg/ml) and anti-vinculin (0.43 μg/ml) antibodies in 1% nonfat milk/TBS for 12 h at 4 °C, washed with TBS three times for 10 min each, and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h, Alexa Fluor 680 goat anti-rabbit IgG (0.133 μg/ml) (Molecular Probes), or IRDye™ 800 goat anti-mouse (0.066 μg/ml) (Rockland, Inc.) for 1 h. After washing, blots were treated for 1 min with chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and autoradiographed on Eastman Kodak Co. BioMax film. Alternatively, to achieve a wider dynamic range for relative quantification, blots were developed using the Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-Cor). In this case, the blocking solution was without detergent. Direct infrared detection makes it possible to detect strong and weak bands on the same blot and to perform dual labeling. Western blots showed two bands at an approximately equivalent position that were identified as being MaxiK channel protein. The specificity of the antibody was tested by preadsorbing with the antigenic peptide (3–10 mg of peptide/mg of antibody). Bands corresponding to the immunoreactive MaxiK protein (estimated molecular mass ∼120 kDa) were quantified using the Bio-Rad GS670 Imaging Densitometer (for chemiluminescence) or with MetaMorph (Universal Imaging Corp.) (for infrared fluorescence). Results are expressed as pixel intensity. Cell Isolation—The uterus was quickly removed and placed in ice-cold dissociation solution containing 55 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, 80 mm sodium glutamate, pH 7.4. The endometrial layer was peeled off, and the myometrium was cut into small square pieces (2 × 2 mm). Papain 38 units/ml (Sigma) was preactivated in dissociation solution with 0.22 mm EDTA and 2.2 mm dithiothreitol for 20 min. Collagenase stock solution, 10,128 units/ml (Type IA; Sigma) was prepared in dissociation solution with 2 mm CaCl2. Collagenase was then added to the preactivated papain solution to a final concentration of 1,030 units/ml collagenase, 33.6 units/ml papain, 0.2 mm Ca2+, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol. The myometrium pieces were incubated in this mixture in a shaking water bath at 25 °C for 40–60 min. After washing three times with dissociation solution, single cells were obtained by gentle trituration of the digested tissue with a plastic pipette. Cells were washed and resuspended in the dissociation solution, plated on coverslips precoated with laminin (20 μg/ml) for 1 h, and fixed for immunocytochemistry. Immunocytochemistry—Stretched uteri or freshly dissociated myometrium cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 2% picric acid in 0.1 m Na2HPO4, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaH2PO4 for 2 h for whole tissue or 20 min for isolated cells. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating the transverse cryostat sections (10 μm) or isolated cells with 5% donkey serum for 30 min at room temperature. The tissue sections or isolated cells were incubated for 12 h at 4 °C with anti-α1098–1196 antibody (3 μg/ml) in 0.5% normal donkey serum, 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS: 10 mm Na2HPO4, 2.3 mm NaH2PO4, 138 mm NaCl, and 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4, washed with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS three times for 5 min each, and then incubated with 7.5 μg/ml Rhodamine Red™-X-conjugated affinity-purified donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) for 1 h at room temperature. Tissue sections or isolated cells were washed in PBS three times for 5 min each and mounted using Prolong (Molecular Probes). The specificity of the antibody was tested by preadsorbing with the antigen (5 mg/mg antibody). NP and LP pregnant samples were stained in parallel, and confocal images were taken with the same laser intensity. Stacks of images were typically acquired by optically sectioning tissues or cells every 0.25 μm at 0.115 μm per pixel with a confocal microscope (Olympus Fluoview). Images were analyzed using Image-Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics), MetaMorph (Universal Imaging Corp.), and Auto Deblur (AutoQuant). Digital Image Processing: Three-dimensional-Blind Deconvolution— Confocal images show out of focus fluorescence due to intrinsic optical nonuniformities; nevertheless, they can be significantly improved by image processing (7Shaw P.J. Pawley J.B. Handbook of Biological Confocal Microscopy. Plenum, New York1995: 373-387Crossref Google Scholar). The processing involves the characterization of the out of focus signals and their removal from the acquired images. This process is generally referred to as deconvolution or image restoration. The characterization of out-of-focus signal is based on the three-dimensional image of a point source of light, the so-called point-spread function (PSF). The deconvolution process should remove the out of focus information transforming diffuse PSF in a single point PSF (8McNally J.G. Karpova T. Cooper J. Conchello J.A. Methods. 1999; 19: 373-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 illustrates the PSF of 0.1 μm fluorescein isothiocyanate-fluorescent beads (Molecular Probes) obtained for the laser-scanning confocal microscope used in our studies (Olympus FluoView, ×60, 1.4 numerical aperture, oil immersion). Stacks of images were acquired every 0.1 μm in the z axis at 0.057 μm/pixel in the x, y plane. The images at the left show unprocessed signals with the ovoid shape PSF typical for laser-scanning confocal microscopy (9Andrews P.D. Harper I.S. Swedlow J.R. Traffic. 2002; 3: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The images at the right show the result of applying three-dimensional-blind deconvolution with Auto-Deblur (AutoQuant) (10Holmes T.J. O'Connor N.J. J. Microsc. 2000; 200: 114-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This method uses an image reconstruction algorithm applying the “maximum likelihood” to search for the PSF in the acquired data that caused the acquired image. This process increases the resolution practically to the theoretical limit in the y, x axis (top panels); z, x axis (lower panels); and z, y axis (not shown) and was used for image analysis of MaxiK localization in isolated myometrial cells from NP and LP mice. Statistics—Unless otherwise stated, data were expressed as mean ± S.E. Comparisons between two groups were analyzed by Student's t test with a statistical significance of <0.05. MaxiK Transcripts Are Down-regulated in Rats and Up-regulated in Mice at the End of Pregnancy—Using an RNA protection assay, we have previously shown that, in LP rats, myometrium MaxiK transcripts were down-regulated (4Song M. Zhu N. Olcese R. Barila B. Toro L. Stefani E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), whereas Benkusky et al. (5Benkusky N.A. Fergus D.J. Zucchero T.M. England S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27712-27719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) found that, in LP mouse, myometrium MaxiK transcripts were up-regulated. As a first step, to understand these differences, we used real time PCR as an alternative method to systematically compare the pattern of MaxiK transcript expression in NP and LP rat and mouse myometrium and to quantify the absolute values of MaxiK transcripts. Fig. 2A shows the fluorescence intensity versus cycle number plot for 100, 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001 pg of MaxiK amplicon. The broken line marks the threshold used to construct the standard calibration curve in Fig. 2E (open circles). Fig. 2B shows the melting curve with a single sharp peak for all samples, indicating the presence of a single PCR product. The fluorescence cycle number curves for NP and LP rats are shown in Fig. 2C. The curve is right-shifted at the end of pregnancy (LP), indicating that MaxiK transcripts become less abundant at this gestational stage. Opposite to this finding, in myometrium from LP mouse, the MaxiK curve is left-shifted, demonstrating in this species an up-regulation of MaxiK transcripts at the end of pregnancy (Fig. 2D). The curves also show a higher abundance of MaxiK transcripts in NP rat myometrium than in NP mouse myometrium, as indicated by a lower threshold cycle number in rat versus mouse (19 versus 23). To calculate the absolute values of reverse transcribed MaxiK mRNA, we selected the same threshold value for all the samples in the linear range of the fluorescence versus cycle number curves (Fig. 2, C and D, broken lines) and interpolated them in the standard curve (Fig. 2E; ▪, NP rat; □, LP rat; ▴, NP mouse; ▵, LP mouse). The results are summarized in Fig. 2F. The absolute MaxiK transcript values were (in pmol/g mRNA) for rats, 65 ± 7 in NP and 2 ± 0.6 in LP myometrium; and values for mice were 2.6 ± 0.8 in NP and 30 ± 7 in LP myometrium (n = 3). As control, GAPDH showed no significant change between NP and LP myometrium in both species. Consistent with previous RNA protection assay determinations, real time PCR experiments showed that indeed myometrium MaxiK transcripts are down-regulated in rats but up-regulated in mice at the end of pregnancy, indicating that the mechanism of MaxiK transcript hormonal regulation is different, depending on the species. MaxiK Total Protein Is Down-regulated in Rats but Up-regulated in Mice at the End of Pregnancy—MaxiK protein quantification using Western blots of myometrial crude membrane preparations produced similar results as real time PCR experiments. Fig. 3A shows that anti-α1098–1196 antibody recognizes in both rats and mice a doublet at approximately the expected molecular size of MaxiK channel protein (∼125 kDa, arrows). This signal is specific, since the protein-antibody interaction was fully inhibited when the antibody was preadsorbed with the corresponding antigen (10 μg/ml; not shown). Different concentrations of membrane protein were loaded, and dose-response curves were constructed to compare the relative abundance of MaxiK in NP versus LP rats (Fig. 3B) and mice (Fig. 3C). Dose-response curves show that MaxiK protein is diminished in rats but increased in mice prior labor by about 3- and 8-fold, respectively. Qualitatively similar results were obtained in another four preparations. These results are in agreement with previous work and demonstrate opposite MaxiK protein handling in rats versus mice. However, the increase in total protein in LP mice cannot explain the previously reported decrease in MaxiK current density (5Benkusky N.A. Fergus D.J. Zucchero T.M. England S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27712-27719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the possibility that the subcellular distribution of MaxiK is different in NP versus LP mouse with less surface expression at the end of pregnancy. MaxiK Channel Protein Accumulates in Cytoplasmic Regions of Myometrial Cells from Late Pregnant Mice—Using immunocytochemistry, we have previously shown that during pregnancy there is a dramatic reduction in the overall MaxiK protein in rats including decreased surface expression and some degree of accumulation in the perinuclear region (4Song M. Zhu N. Olcese R. Barila B. Toro L. Stefani E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, the subcellular distribution of MaxiK protein in uterine myocytes from NP and LP mice is unknown. Tissue sections from NP and LP mouse myometrium were examined using anti-α1098–1196 antibody. Fig. 4 shows single confocal planes of transverse uterine sections illustrating the circular layer from NP (A) and LP (B) mice. Consistent with Western blots, the images in NP mouse showed very low levels of MaxiK signal that appeared to be mainly located at the surface membrane of smooth muscle cells (arrows). On the other hand, myometrium from late pregnant mice was strongly labeled with the MaxiK antibody (Fig. 4B), but the majority of the protein seemed accumulated in the cytoplasm in perinuclear organelles. No staining was detected when the anti-MaxiK antibody was preadsorbed with the corresponding antigen (Fig. 4C). Since, in confocal images of tissue sections, it was difficult to distinguish the level of immunostaining at the cell surface, we performed MaxiK immunostaining in freshly isolated myometrial cells. Fig. 5 illustrates a montage of raw single confocal planes near the middle of isolated myometrial cells from NP (A) and LP (B) mice. Note that in NP mice (A), MaxiK labeling shows some degree of clustering near the cell surface with very little intracellular labeling, whereas in LP mice there is an overall large increase in total MaxiK protein, which is mostly localized surrounding the nucleus (B). Although single cell labeling significantly increased the optical resolution when compared with tissue sections, analysis of middle sections could not determine whether MaxiK channel expression was different at the cell surface in NP versus LP uterine myocytes. Therefore, we further analyzed stacks of images taken every 0.25 μm in the z plane.Fig. 5MaxiK channel protein accumulation in perinuclear organelles in isolated uterine cells at term. Shown are single confocal images near the middle of the cells from isolated uterine smooth muscle cells from NP (A) and LP (B) mouse. The cells were immunostained with anti-α1098–1196 antibody. Note the weaker stain of NP cells when compared with LP cells and the strong MaxiK cytoplasmic staining in the perinuclear region of LP cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) MaxiK Channel Localizes in Clusters at the Surface of NP Mouse Uterine Myocytes and Redistributes in Late Pregnancy— In order to determine whether the degree of MaxiK labeling at the cell surface is different in myometrial cells from NP and LP mice, stacks of confocal images were restored with three-dimensional-blind deconvolution. Fig. 6 shows bright field differential interference contrast images and the corresponding deconvoluted confocal middle sections of NP (A and C) and LP (B and D) uterine myocytes. Note that in the NP myocyte (C), MaxiK channels seem clustered at the surface membrane where the optical section is close to the surface (arrows). On the other hand, in the LP uterine myocyte (D), MaxiK channel clustering was barely detected at the periphery, and the protein is mainly visualized in canalicular type structures throughout the cytoplasm with predominant staining near the nucleus (D, inset). E–H illustrates the analysis of optical sections at the top of NP and LP cells corresponding to the cell plasma membrane. E is a raw image of a confocal section near the top surface of a cell of NP myometrium, and F is after image restoration. Note in F, after deconvolution, the clear clustered pattern of MaxiK channel localization. G illustrates the region depicted in F (square) at a higher magnification. On the other hand, LP uterine myocytes show an overall reduction of MaxiK channel labeling at the cell surface without a noticeable clustering. As an example, H illustrates the region in B at higher magnification and taken at the top surface after deconvolution, demonstrating the lack of detection of MaxiK channel clusters. This is quantified in Fig. 7, which shows the line scan plot between the arrows in Fig. 6, F and H. The plot reflects the regular peak pattern of the clusters at the cell surface in the NP uterine myocyte (▪) and the smooth and lower intensity signal in the LP myocyte (□). Cluster analysis in a NP myocyte after setting the lower threshold at 100-pixel intensity (Fig. 7, broken line) gives the following cluster values: cluster area 0.083 ± 0.011 μm2, estimated radius 160 ± 15 nm, and 0.72 clusters/μm2 (n = 43 clusters). Similar results were obtained in another seven LP and NP uterine myocytes. We can conclude that MaxiK channels in NP uterine myocytes are localized in discrete microdomains, forming clusters at the cell surface that are difficult to distinguish in LP myometrium. The disappearance of MaxiK channel from the cell surface and the increased protein accumulation in the perinuclear region at the end of pregnancy reconcile the increase in total protein measured with Western blot with the decreased current density that reflects the active channels at the surface membrane in LP mouse.Fig. 7Line scan plot of MaxiK channel clusters in NP uterine myocytes. Line scan plot between the arrows in Fig. 6 for a NP (F) and LP (H) uterine myocytes. Note the regular pattern of the peaks (clusters) in the NP uterine myocyte (▪) and the smooth and lower intensity plot in the LP myocyte (□). The broken line marks the lower threshold (100-pixel intensity) used for cluster analysis (values given under “Results”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The main findings of this work are that 1) MaxiK transcripts and total protein are diminished in rats but up-regulated in mice at the end of pregnancy; 2) despite an overall increase in total protein in mice at the end of pregnancy, there is little signal at the surface membrane; 3) in LP mouse myocytes, the majority of the protein appears to be in the cytoplasm in a canalicular pattern that is more evident near the nucleus; and 4) MaxiK channels in NP mice are localized in discrete microdomains, forming clusters at the cell surface that are difficult to distinguish in LP myometrium. During pregnancy, the uterine smooth muscle undergoes dramatic changes in hormonal levels, morphology, and state of contractile activity. Electrophysiological recordings in both rats and mice indicate that the majority of K+ outward current in NP uterine smooth muscle cells is due to the activity of MaxiK channels, since the majority of the outward current was blocked by iberiotoxin (4Song M. Zhu N. Olcese R. Barila B. Toro L. Stefani E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 5Benkusky N.A. Fergus D.J. Zucchero T.M. England S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27712-27719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). MaxiK channels are also present in LP mice and rats (5Benkusky N.A. Fergus D.J. Zucchero T.M.

Gynecol. 1993; 168: 652-660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) but seem to contribute less to the total outward K+ current. The lower current density of MaxiK channel in rats correlated well with our findings showing that the MaxiK transcript and total and surface protein are drastically decreased toward the end of pregnancy (4Song M. Zhu N. Olcese R. Barila B. Toro L. Stefani E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, the lower MaxiK current density in mice could not be explained from the total protein and transcript measurements, since both are increased at the end of pregnancy (5Benkusky N.A. Fergus D.J. Zucchero T.M. England S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27712-27719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The diminution of MaxiK channel function at the end of pregnancy in mouse was attributed to 1) a hypothetical lower Ca2+ sensitivity of the channel, 2) a potential right shift in the channel activation curve, 3) different regulation of MaxiK channel splice variants during pregnancy, and 4) up-regulation of the accessory β1 subunit (5Benkusky N.A.

In this work, using image restoration of confocal images, we found that although at the end of pregnancy there is an overall increase in total protein in mice, the majority of the protein is accumulated in the cytoplasm with little signal at the surface membrane. It appears that a novel mechanism that involves altered channel trafficking during pregnancy can explain the lower ionic current measurements despite an increase in total protein (5Benkusky N.A. Fergus D.J. Zucchero T.M. England S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27712-27719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Previous immunocytochemistry experiments in rats also showed that although MaxiK surface protein is diminished in myometrium close to term, the small amount synthesized is accumulated in the perinuclear region (4Song M. Zhu N. Olcese R. Barila B. Toro L. Stefani E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Similarly, Kv4.3 down-regulation in rat myometrium at term is associated with perinuclear accumulation of Kv4.3 protein (14Song M. Helguera G. Eghbali M. Zhu N. Zarei M.M. Olcese R. Toro L. Stefani E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31883-31890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Therefore, a diminished intracellular traffic in both rats and mice may modulate surface expression of channel proteins in LP myometrium. This mechanism seems to be predominant in mouse myometrium near term, explaining the reduced surface expression of MaxiK channel. Our results also indicate that during pregnancy there are species differences in the way MaxiK channel mRNA and total protein are expressed and handled. In rats, there is a parallel correspondence between surface protein and mRNA levels, suggesting that the predominating mechanism regulating MaxiK channel protein expression is transcription (4Song M. Zhu N. Olcese R. Barila B. Toro L. Stefani E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This contrasts with mice, where traffic regulation seems to be the predominant mechanism. Since during pregnancy there are dramatic changes in sex hormone levels, we may speculate that sex hormones may diminish channel traffic to the surface, a mechanism that seems to be predominant in mouse myometrium. To our knowledge, this work presents the first direct evidence that MaxiK channels are not evenly distributed at the surface membrane of smooth muscle cells but are localized in microdomains, forming clusters. Recent evidence suggests that channel clustering forming macromolecular complexes with regulatory signaling enzymes seems necessary to create localized cell machineries dedicated to specific cell functions. For example, L-type Ca2+ channels colocalizes in puncta with β2 adrenergic receptor in hippocampal axosomatic synapses for synaptic function (15Davare M.A. Avdonin V. Hall D.D. Peden E.M. Burette A. Weinberg R.J. Horne M.C. Hoshi T. Hell J.W. Science. 2001; 293: 98-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) and with ryanodine receptors and calse-questrin in heart cells for excitation-contraction coupling (16Scriven D.R. Dan P. Moore E.D. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2682-2691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and Kv2.1 K+ channels spatially associate in clusters with ryanodine receptors regulating dendritic Ca2+ transients (17Antonucci D.E. Lim S.T. Vassanelli S. Trimmer J.S. Neuroscience. 2001; 108: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In smooth muscle from cerebral arteries, MaxiK channels are functionally coupled to ryanodine receptors via Ca2+ sparks, which activate MaxiK channels favoring relaxation (18Nelson M.T. Cheng H. Rubart M. Santana L.F. Bonev A.D. Knot H.J. Lederer W.J. Science. 1995; 270: 633-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar). In agreement with our MaxiK clustering measurements, recent Ca2+ sparks data in amphibian smooth muscle suggest that MaxiK channels do not appear to be uniformly distributed over the membrane, but instead they may form clusters at the spark site with an estimated radius of 150–300 nm for the membrane area over which a Ca2+ concentration ≥10 μm is reached to activate MaxiK channels (19ZhuGe R. Fogarty K.E. Tuft R.A. Walsh Jr., J.V. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This local Ca2+ concentration is optimal to fully activate MaxiK channels assembled by the pore-forming α subunit and its β1 regulatory subunit (20Meera P. Wallner M. Jiang Z. Toro L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Thus, our results showing MaxiK clusters at the surface membrane with an estimated radius of about 200 nm are in agreement with functional studies and support the view that MaxiK channels form distinct and localized macromolecular complexes optimized for its function that can undergo remodeling in late pregnancy. In conclusion, surface expression of MaxiK channel protein can be influenced by transcriptional regulation and intracellular trafficking probably under the control of sex hormones during pregnancy. Our results demonstrate that in both mice and rats the final result at the end of pregnancy is a diminished surface expression of MaxiK channel protein that would translate to a higher myometrium contractility favoring parturition.

Here, we report experiments demonstrating that the core 1-specific lectin jacalin almost completely abrogated laminin-induced AChR clustering in C2C12 myotubes and that α-dystroglycan was the predominant jacalin-binding protein detected in C2C12 myotube lysates. Although jacalin likely inhibited laminin-induced AChR clustering by directly binding to α-dystroglycan, jacalin had no effect on laminin binding to the myotube surface or to α-dystroglycan. Like jacalin, peanut agglutinin lectin also binds the core 1 disaccharide but not when it is terminally sialylated as expressed on α-dystroglycan.

The dystroglycan complex was originally identified as a component of the skeletal muscle dystrophin-glycoprotein complex, which spans the sarcolemma of muscle cells and physically couples the actin cytoskeleton with the extracellular matrix (1Blake D.J.

The dystroglycan complex consists of α-dystroglycan, a highly glycosylated extracellular protein that binds to several extracellular ligands, and β-dystroglycan, a single-pass transmembrane protein that links cytoplasmic dystrophin with α-dystroglycan (3Michele D.E. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15457-15460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Both dystroglycan subunits are encoded by a single highly conserved pro-peptide that is proteolytically processed into α- and β-dystroglycan, which remain stably associated through non-covalent interactions (3Michele D.E.

Thus, it is generally thought that one important function of the dystroglycan complex in skeletal muscle is to mechanically protect the sarcolemma against shear stresses imposed during muscle contraction. However, the dystroglycan complex has also been linked with more dynamic developmental or pathological processes (6Henry M.D. Campbell K.P. Curr. Opin.

Chem. 2003; 278: 15457-15460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). α-Dystroglycan is also modified by more generic N-linked glycans and sialylated core 1 oligosaccharides with the structure SiaAα(2–3)Galβ(1–3)GalNAc (11Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. Cell. 1991; 66: 1121-1131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar). However, enzymatic removal of these glycans has no effect on α-dystroglycan binding to laminins (12Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 809-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar), agrin (13Bowe M.A. Deyst K.A. Leszyk J.D. Fallon J.R. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1173-1180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), or neurexins (14Sugita S. Saito F. Tang J. Satz J. Campbell K. Sudhof T.C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Recently, Martin and colleagues (15Parkhomovskiy N. Kammesheidt A. Martin P.T. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2000; 15: 380-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 16Xia B. Martin P.T. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2002; 19: 539-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) have reported data suggesting that the common core 1 disaccharide Galβ(1–3)GalNAc may play a role in AChR clustering. Most relevant to the current study, the core 1-reactive lectin peanut agglutinin was demonstrated to completely inhibit AChR clustering induced by neuraminidase treatment of myotubes (15Parkhomovskiy N. Kammesheidt A. Martin P.T. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2000; 15: 380-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 16Xia B. Martin P.T. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2002; 19: 539-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, the core 1-modified glyconjugate(s) important for neuraminidase-induced AChR clustering and blocked by peanut agglutinin were not identified. Here, we report that the core 1-specific lectin jacalin bound predominantly to α-dystroglycan in C2C12 myotubes and inhibited laminin-induced AChR clustering. We further demonstrate that α-dystroglycan was the predominant peanut agglutinin-binding protein detected in neuraminidase-treated C2C12 myotubes and that both α-dystroglycan binding to peanut agglutinin and neuraminidase-induced AChR clustering were dramatically inhibited by endo-O-glycosidase digestion. Additional experiments indicate that the sialylated core 1 oligosaccharides of α-dystroglycan play a role in laminin-induced AChR clustering through a mechanism independent from oligosaccharide-mediated binding of α-dystroglycan to laminin. Cell Culture—The C2C12 cell line was obtained from ATCC and used between 3 and 7 passages. Proliferating cells were grown in 10 cm dishes or on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro, Fisher Scientific) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) plus 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (Sigma) at 37 °C in a humid atmosphere of 5–10% CO2. After reaching confluency, the media was switched to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% equine serum (Hyclone) plus 1% antibiotic/antimycotic. Cells were cultured until full differentiation to multi-nucleate myotubes was observed morphologically (4 days) with fresh media exchanged every 2 days. Analysis of AChR Clustering—3-day old C2C12 myotubes grown on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips were incubated with 120 nm laminin-1, 50 μg/ml jacalin lectin (EY Labs, San Mateo, CA), or both diluted in media for 18 h at 37 °C. Cells were rinsed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with 500 ng/ml Alexa488-bungarotoxin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) diluted in media. Stained cells were rinsed twice in PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were rinsed in PBS and mounted on slides for immunofluorescence analysis. In addition, 4-day-old C2C12 myotubes were treated with 0.1 unit/ml Clostridium perfringens neuraminidase in the absence or presence of 15 milliunits/ml endo-O-glycosidase for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were rinsed twice with media and fixed and stained as described above. Fluorescence images were collected with a Bio-Rad MRC 1000 confocal microscope (Keck Center for Biological Imaging), or Zeiss CFL 25 fluorescence microscope using a 40× oil immersion objective and the number of AChR quantitated as previously described (17McDearmon E.L. Combs A.C. Ervasti J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35078-35086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). All images were re-sized and cropped using Adobe Photoshop 5.0 and imported into CorelDraw 10 for figure preparation. Myotube Solubilization and Lectin Chromatography—Differentiated C2C12 myotubes were rinsed twice with 37 °C PBS and scraped off each dish into 5 ml of ice-cold PBS containing the following protease inhibitors: 100 μg/ml benzamidine, 40 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm iodoacetamide, and 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin A. Cells were pelleted by brief centrifugation and solubilized in 0.5 ml/dish of 1% Triton buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml benzamidine, 40 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm iodoacetamide, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1% Triton X-100) containing 150 mm NaCl (unless otherwise noted). The resuspended cell pellet was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with end-over-end mixing followed by centrifugation for 15 min at 10,000 × g. 0.2 ml of Triton-solubilized C2C12 myotube lysate was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 50 μl of jacalinagarose or peanut agglutinin-agarose beads (EY Labs) that were preequilibrated in wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 100 μg/ml benzamidine, 40 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Triton X-100). The beads were pelleted by brief centrifugation and the void volumes retained for Western blot analysis. Lectin beads were then washed extensively with wash buffer and bound proteins eluted by incubation with Laemmli sample buffer (LSB, 3% SDS, 0.115 m sucrose, 65 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 1% β-mercaptoethanol) containing 0.1 m lactose. To determine the effects of neuraminidase and endo-O-glycosidase treatment on the peanut agglutinin-reactivity of α-dystroglycan, C2C12 myotubes were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 0.1 units/ml C. perfringens neuraminidase (Roche Applied Science) in the absence or presence of 15 milliunits/ml endo-O-glycosidase (Prozyme, San Leandro, CA). Cells were rinsed twice with 37 °C PBS, harvested, and solubilized for peanut agglutinin-agarose chromatography as described above. Immunofluorescence Analysis of β-Dystroglycan Distribution and Laminin-1 Binding to C2C12 Myotubes—3-day-old C2C12 myotubes were incubated for 18 h at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 50 μg/ml jacalin, 120 nm laminin-1, or both jacalin plus laminin-1 diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% equine serum. To assess the effect of jacalin on the distribution of β-dystroglycan, control and jacalin-treated myotubes were rinsed with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After blocking overnight at 4 °C with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS, myotubes were incubated with mouse monoclonal antibody NCL-β-DG to β-dystroglycan (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) in 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS for 2 h at room temperature. Myotubes were rinsed three times with PBS followed by an incubation with Alexa488-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies (Molecular Probes) diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were rinsed and mounted on slides for fluorescence microscopy. To assess the effect of jacalin on laminin-1 binding to C2C12 myotubes, control, laminin-1-treated, and laminin-1 plus jacalin-treated myotubes were rinsed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Myotube-bound laminin-1 was detected with an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against mouse laminin-1 (Sigma) and Alexa488-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies as described above. Images were collected and processed for inclusion in figures as described above. Western Blot Analysis of Laminin-1 Binding to C2C12 Myotubes— Control, laminin-1-treated, and laminin-1 plus jacalin-treated myotubes were rinsed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and solubilized with Laemmli sample buffer. The relative laminin α1 chain immunoreactivity present in equal amounts of total myotube protein was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting using an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against mouse laminin-1. Analysis of Laminin-1 Binding to α-Dystroglycan—The effect of jacalin on laminin-1 binding to α-dystroglycan was also assessed by two methods. First, polystyrene microtiter wells coated overnight at 4 °C with 0.1 μg of α-dystroglycan purified from rabbit skeletal muscle were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2 and incubated with 4 nm laminin-1 in the presence of increasing concentrations of jacalin. Laminin-1 binding was detected with affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies against laminin-1, followed by HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary and color development with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Color development was quantitated kinetically at 655 nm using a Molecular Dynamics Spectramax 340UV/Vis microplate reader. As a positive control for inhibition, a parallel assay was performed in the presence of increasing concentrations of purified monoclonal antibody IIH6 (the kind gift of Dr. Kevin Campbell), which was previously shown to inhibit laminin-1 binding to α-dystroglycan (12Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 809-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). In the second assay, C2C12 myotubes were solubilized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml benzamidine, 40 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, and 50 mm NaCl to facilitate laminin binding to α-dystroglycan in the presence of detergent (12Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 809-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar), and lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with jacalinagarose either alone or in the presence of 0.25 μg/ml or 0.5 μg/ml purified laminin-1. Beads were washed extensively, and bound proteins were eluted with Laemmli sample buffer. To determine whether laminin-1 bound directly to jacalin-agarose, purified laminin-1 was diluted to 0.5 μg/ml in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm CaCl2, and 100 μl was incubated overnight with 20 μl of jacalin-agarose at 4 °C. Jacalin-agarose was washed and bound proteins eluted as described above. The amount of laminin α1 chain and α-dystroglycan present in the starting material, voids, and lectin-bound fractions was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting—Samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and stained with Coomassie blue or transferred to nitrocellulose as previously described (11Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. Cell. 1991; 66: 1121-1131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed with either monoclonal antibody IIH6 to α-dystroglycan (11Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. Cell. 1991; 66: 1121-1131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar), or affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies against laminin-1 followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. Lectin blotting was performed by blocking nitrocellulose transfers with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 followed by incubation with 1 μg/ml HRP-conjugated jacalin or peanut agglutinin (EY Labs) in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature and extensive washing with PBS. All antibody and lectin staining was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using Pierce Supersignal Pico West substrate. Gels and chemiluminescence films were imaged using a Bio-Rad GS670 imaging densitometer and the images processed using Bio-Rad Molecular Analyst software (version 1.4) before importation into CorelDraw 10 for figure preparation.

Cell Neurosci. 2002; 19: 539-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) further suggest a role for glycoconjugates bearing the core 1 disaccharide Galβ(1–3)GalNAc in AChR clustering on the surface of muscle cells. The lectin jacalin shows specificity for Galβ(1–3)GalNAc but can also bind avidly to SiaAα(2–3)Galβ(1–3)GalNAc (26Hortin G.L. Trimpe B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 188: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Because α-dystroglycan is modified by sialylated core 1 disaccharides (see Fig. 2A), we treated C2C12 myotubes with 120 nm laminin-1, 50 μg/ml jacalin, or both and quantitated the number of AChR clusters per field for each treatment (Fig. 1, A and B). Although jacalin alone had no effect on the number of AChR clusters observed relative to untreated control myotubes and laminin-1 alone induced an ∼4-fold increase in the number of AChR clusters, jacalin almost completely abrogated laminin-1-induced AChR clustering (Fig. 1B).Fig. 1Jacalin lectin inhibits laminin-induced AChR clustering. Shown in A, C2C12 myotubes were treated with 50 μg/ml jacalin (+ Jac), 120 nm laminin-1 (+ Ln-1) or both for 18 h at 37 °C and stained with Alexa488-conjugated bungarotoxin to label AChRs (scale bar is 20 μm). The graph in B reports the average number of AChR clusters observed (± S.E.) in C2C12 myotubes that were either untreated, treated with jacalin, laminin-1, or both jacalin and laminin-1. AChR clusters were counted in 5–10 random fields from each of 2 independent experiments. The number of AChR clusters measured in laminin-1-treated cultures was significantly greater than in control (CON) cultures (p < 0.001), or those treated with jacalin in the absence (p < 0.001), or presence of laminin-1 (p < 0.001) as assessed by ANOVA with Tukey post-test. The number of AChR clusters in control, jacalintreated, and laminin-1 plus jacalin-treated cultures were not significantly different (p > 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To begin to elucidate the mechanism by which jacalin may inhibit laminin-induced AChR clustering, Triton lysates of C2C12 myotubes were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose and stained with peroxidase-conjugated jacalin. Surprisingly, jacalin detected only a single diffuse band that co-migrated with α-dystroglycan immunoreactivity (Fig. 2B). We further observed that α-dystroglycan in C2C12 myotube lysates was not detected in the voids after passage over jacalinagarose and was quantitatively retained on the lectin matrix (Fig. 2C). α7β1 integrin also mediates laminin-induced AChR clustering (27Burkin D.J. Gu M. Hodges B.L. Campanelli J.T. Kaufman S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1067-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 28Burkin D.J. Kim J.E. Gu M. Kaufman S.J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2877-2886Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the electrophoretic mobility of the β1 integrin subunit overlaps with that of α-dystroglycan. However, no β1 integrin in C2C12 myotubes bound to jacalin-agarose (Fig. 2C). From these data, we conclude that jacalin inhibited laminin-1-induced AChR clustering (Fig. 1, A and B) by directly binding to sialylated core 1 oligosaccharides present on α-dystroglycan. Because jacalin is bivalent and the number of sialylated core 1 oligosaccharides present on α-dystroglycan is unknown, we considered the possibility that jacalin inhibited laminin-1-induced AChR clustering by sequestering dystroglycan into cluster-incompetent aggregates on the myotube surface. However, we found that prolonged incubation of C2C12 myotubes with 50 μg/ml jacalin had no effect on the normally diffuse distribution of β-dystroglycan (Fig. 3A). The carbohydrate moieties present on α-dystroglycan are clearly necessary for its binding to laminins, agrin, and neurexins although the specific oligosaccharides on α-dystroglycan responsible for its binding to extracellular ligands have not been identified (3Michele D.E. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15457-15460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Therefore, jacalin could inhibit laminin-1-induced AChR clustering by blocking laminin-1 binding to α-dystroglycan. To test this possibility, C2C12 myotubes were either left untreated or incubated with 120 nm exogenous laminin-1 in the absence or presence of 50 μg/ml jacalin, and bound laminin-1 was assessed by two methods. In the first, laminin-1 bound to the myotube surface was assessed qualitatively by immunofluorescence microscopy using an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody raised against laminin-1 (Fig. 3B). Consistent with a previous study (29Colognato H. Winkelmann D.A. Yurchenco P.D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 619-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), we detected virtually no laminin-1 immunoreactivity on the surface of control myotubes, whereas the surfaces of laminin-1-treated myotubes were strongly stained (Fig. 3B). However, surface staining of myotubes incubated with both laminin-1 and jacalin was indistinguishable from that observed for myotubes incubated with laminin-1 alone (Fig. 3B). In the second method, control myotubes and myotubes incubated with laminin-1 in the absence or presence of jacalin were rinsed and solubilized with 1% SDS to extract all protein retained on the culture dish. Western blot analysis of equal amounts of the SDS myotube extracts obtained after each treatment regime revealed an equivalent amount of laminin-1 α1 chain immunoreactivity retained by cultures incubated with laminin-1 regardless of whether jacalin was present during the incubation period (Fig. 3C). Although the results presented in Fig. 3, B and C, suggest that jacalin did not inhibit laminin-1-induced AChR clustering by preventing laminin-1 binding to the myotube surface, it remained possible that laminin-1 predominantly binds to myotubes via interaction with α7β1 integrin but that jacalin subsequently blocks laminin-1 interaction with α-dystroglycan on the myotube surface. However, we performed two experiments indicating that jacalin was unable to directly block laminin-1 binding to α-dystroglycan. First, we measured laminin-1 binding to purified α-dystroglycan immobilized in microtiter wells and measured no effect of jacalin even at concentrations as high as 100 μg/ml (Fig. 4A). As a control, we performed a parallel experiment with monoclonal antibody IIH6, which has previously been shown to block the laminin/α-dystroglycan interaction (12Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 809-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). As expected, IIH6 completely inhibited laminin-1 binding to immobilized α-dystroglycan (Fig. 4A) when present at a concentration of 50 μg/ml (63 nm). Given the great molecular weight disparity between jacalin (50,000) and IIH6 IgM (800,000), the data in Fig. 4A indicate that jacalin was unable to inhibit laminin-1 binding to α-dystroglycan even when present at 500-fold molar excess over laminin-1 and ∼30-fold molar excess over the concentration of IIH6 that completely inhibited binding. Finally, we tested whether exogenous laminin-1 could inhibit the binding of C2C12 myotube α-dystroglycan to jacalin-agarose. Triton-solubilized myotube lysates were pre-incubated with 0, 0.25, or 0.5 μg/ml of purified laminin-1 followed by incubation with jacalin-agarose. We observed similar amounts of α-dystroglycan retained by jacalinagarose in the absence or presence of added laminin-1 (Fig. 4B). Staining of an identical blot with affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies to laminin-1 revealed that equivalent amounts of laminin α1 chain were retained by jacalin-agarose (Fig. 4B) even though purified laminin-1 alone exhibited no binding to jacalin-agarose (Fig. 4C). The results of Fig. 4, B and C, indicate that laminin-1 was retained on jacalin-agarose through interaction with α-dystroglycan in the myotube lysate and that we had saturated all laminin-1 binding sites on α-dystroglycan. We conclude that laminin-1 and jacalin do not compete for the same or overlapping binding sites on α-dystroglycan and that the three proteins may form a ternary complex. Previous studies (15Parkhomovskiy N. Kammesheidt A. Martin P.T. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2000; 15: 380-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 16Xia B. Martin P.T. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2002; 19: 539-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the enzyme neuraminidase can induce AChR clustering in C2C12 myotubes and that neuraminidase-induced AChR clustering is blocked by the lectin peanut agglutinin. Like jacalin, peanut agglutinin lectin also binds specifically to the core 1 disaccharide but cannot when modified by a terminal sialic acid as expressed on α-dystroglycan (Fig. 2A). Given that the data in Figs. 1 and 2 suggested that jacalin inhibited laminin-induced AChR clustering by binding to sialylated core 1 oligosaccharides on α-dystroglycan, we hypothesized that peanut agglutinin may also inhibit neuraminidase-induced AChR clustering by binding to desialylated core 1 disaccharides of neuraminidase-digested α-dystroglycan. Peroxidase-conjugated peanut agglutinin lectin stained none of the proteins present in control myotube lysates but stained a single diffuse band with an electrophoretic migration that matched that of α-dystroglycan immunoreactivity in neuraminidase-treated myotubes (Fig. 5A). Peanut agglutinin staining of this single band was substantially decreased when neuraminidase-treated myotubes were simultaneously digested with endo-O-glycosidase (Fig. 5A), which specifically cleaves unmodified core 1 disaccharides from the underlying polypeptide backbone (Fig. 2A). To confirm that the peanut agglutinin-reactive protein in neuraminidase-treated myotubes was indeed α-dystroglycan, we performed peanut agglutinin-agarose chromatography on control myotube lysates as well as lysates prepared from myotubes digested with neuraminidase in the absence or presence of endo-O-glycosidase. Although α-dystroglycan in neuraminidase-treated myotubes bound to peanut agglutinin-agarose, no α-dystroglycan in control lysates was retained by the lectin matrix (Fig. 5B). Moreover, the amount of α-dystroglycan bound to peanut agglutinin-agarose was dramatically reduced when myotubes were simultaneously incubated with neuraminidase and endo-O-glycosidase (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that peanut agglutinin inhibits neuraminidase-induced AChR clustering by binding to desialylated core 1 disaccharides present on α-dystroglycan. If core 1 disaccharides are important for AChR clustering, we reasoned that endo-O-glycosidase treatment should also inhibit neuraminidase-induced AChR clustering. Consistent with previous studies from several labs (15Parkhomovskiy N. Kammesheidt A. Martin P.T. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2000; 15: 380-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 17McDearmon E.L.

Neurobiol. 1999; 40: 356-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), neuraminidase treatment of C2C12 myotubes caused an ∼4-fold increase in the number of clusters observed in comparison with untreated myotubes (Fig. 6). More interestingly, endo-O-glycosidase dramatically inhibited neuraminidase-induced AChR clustering (Fig. 6). When taken together with the results of Martin and colleagues (15Parkhomovskiy N.

Cell Neurosci. 2002; 19: 539-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the data in Figs. 5 and 6 indicate that either blocking (by peanut agglutinin) or specific enzymatic removal of core 1 disaccharides from α-dystroglycan largely abrogates neuraminidase-induced AChR clustering. Although the relevance of neuraminidase-induced AChR clustering in vivo is unclear, these data further support an important role for α-dystroglycan core 1 disaccharides in AChR clustering, regardless of the mode by which cluster formation is triggered. Distinct oligosaccharide structures have long been implicated in the process of neuromuscular synaptogenesis based on unique labeling of adult neuromuscular junctions with carbohydrate-specific lectins and antibodies as well as perturbation of AChR clustering in myotube cultures by lectins and glycosidases (15Parkhomovskiy N.

With regard to the identity of glycoconjugates bearing sialylated oligosaccharides important in AChR cluster formation, recent data suggests that agrin and MuSK both bind to and are modified by several oligosaccharides that are potentially the site of action by glycosidases and lectins that have been shown to significantly alter AChR clustering in vitro (15Parkhomovskiy N. Kammesheidt A. Martin P.T. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2000; 15: 380-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 16Xia B. Martin P.T. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2002; 19: 539-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Modulation of agrin and MuSK activity by glycosylation is likely of great physiological relevance because they, along with rapsyn and AChRs, are the core components necessary for AChR cluster formation in vivo (35Sanes J.R. Lichtman J.W. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Existing evidence suggests that neuraminidase induces AChR clustering in myotubes at least in part by removing sialic acid residues from oligosaccharides present on MuSK (31Grow W.A. Ferns M. Gordon H. J. Neurobiol. 1999; 40: 356-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 36Watty A. Burden S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50457-50462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Although peanut agglutinin could conceivably inhibit neuraminidase-induced AChR clustering by directly binding to MuSK, Watty and Burden (36Watty A. Burden S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50457-50462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) showed that the sialic acid moieties present on MuSK were entirely contained within N-linked oligosaccharides. Moreover, this study observed no binding of peanut agglutinin to MuSK either before or after treatment with neuraminidase (36Watty A. Burden S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50457-50462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These results indicate that neuraminidase does not stimulate AChR clustering by exposing core 1 disaccharides on MuSK, nor does peanut agglutinin block clustering through binding to core 1 disaccharides on MuSK. In addition to inducing AChR clustering through its action on sialylated N-linked oligosaccharides on MuSK (36Watty A. Burden S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50457-50462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), our results demonstrate that neuraminidase treatment also exposes peanut agglutinin-reactive core 1 disaccharides detected predominantly on α-dystroglycan (Figs. 5 and 6), which suggests that peanut agglutinin exerts its inhibitory effect by binding directly to desialylated α-dystroglycan. Our experiments with endo-O-glycosidase (Figs. 5 and 6) further indicate that removal of core 1 disaccharides from desialylated α-dystroglycan is as effective in abrogating neuraminidase-induced AChR clustering as was blocking core 1 disaccharides by peanut agglutinin (15Parkhomovskiy N. Kammesheidt A. Martin P.T. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2000; 15: 380-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 16Xia B. Martin P.T. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2002; 19: 539-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). More importantly, we demonstrated that jacalin also binds predominantly to α-dystroglycan and effectively inhibits laminin-induced AChR clustering (Figs. 1 and 2) independent of treatment by any glycosidase. These results suggest that the sialylated core 1 oligosaccharides present on native α-dystroglycan may participate in the formation or stabilization of AChR clusters in vivo. A critical test of this possibility awaits the identification of the α-dystroglycan amino acids bearing sialylated core 1 oligosaccharides so they can be genetically altered without affecting the O-linked oligosaccharides important for its extracellular ligand binding activities (3Michele D.E. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15457-15460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Because jacalin had no effect on laminin binding to the myotube surface (Fig. 3), or to α-dystroglycan (Fig. 4), we hypothesize that the sialylated core 1 oligosaccharides of α-dystroglycan likely perform a novel function in AChR cluster formation that is independent from and likely downstream of the well established role for α-dystroglycan glycosylation in laminin binding (3Michele D.E. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15457-15460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Clusters of core 1 oligosaccharides are generally thought to confer a stiff, extended conformation on the underlying polypeptide backbone (37van den S.P. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Opdenakker G. Crit Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 151-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), and both the extensive glycosylation (3Michele D.E. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15457-15460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) and electron microscopic evidence (38Brancaccio A. Schulthess T. Gesemann M. Engel J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) support the idea that this may hold true for α-dystroglycan as well. Therefore, it is conceivable that enzymatic removal of sialylated core 1 oligosaccharides may collapse an extended conformation of α-dystroglycan that is necessary to transduce laminin binding into some form of downstream signaling. This mechanism is difficult to reconcile with our (Fig. 1) and others' observations (15Parkhomovskiy N. Kammesheidt A. Martin P.T. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2000; 15: 380-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 16Xia B. Martin P.T. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2002; 19: 539-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) that lectin binding to core 1 oligosaccharides also effectively inhibited neuraminidase- and laminin-induced AChR clustering. We instead favor the hypothesis that the sialylated core 1 oligosaccharides of α-dystroglycan mediates its lateral association with another cell surface or extracellular molecule that is important for AChR cluster formation. Molecules interacting with the sialylated core 1 oligosaccharides of α-dystroglycan could either stimulate AChR clustering upon binding to α-dystroglycan, or they may constitutively inhibit clustering until repressed when bound to α-dystroglycan (35Sanes J.R. Lichtman J.W. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). In this model, either blocking (by lectin binding) or enzymatic removal of the oligosaccharide would be sufficient to abrogate the putative protein-oligosaccharide interaction and disrupt AChR clustering. Although an obvious candidate for lateral interaction with α-dystroglycan is α7β1 integrin (27Burkin D.J. Gu M. Hodges B.L. Campanelli J.T. Kaufman S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1067-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), we have not been able to detect a biochemical interaction between α-dystroglycan and α7β1 integrin even after prolonged incubation of C2C12 myotubes with laminin. Based on its direct binding to and activation by the isolated core 1 disaccharide (15Parkhomovskiy N. Kammesheidt A. Martin P.T. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2000; 15: 380-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), MuSK can be postulated as a candidate for lateral interaction with α-dystroglycan. However, the disaccharide Galβ(1–4)GlcNAc also binds to and activates MuSK with the same efficacy as the isolated core 1 disaccharide whereas SiaAα(2–3)Galβ(1–4)GlcNAc exhibits neither activity (15Parkhomovskiy N. Kammesheidt A. Martin P.T. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2000; 15: 380-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore, the lack of specificity of MuSK for core 1 disaccharide, the absence of activity upon sialylation, and the ability of laminin to induce AChR clustering in MuSK-/- myotubes (22Sugiyama J.E. Glass D.J. Yancopoulos G.D. Hall Z.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) all argue against this possibility and suggests that α-dystroglycan may laterally associate with a novel cell surface molecule. Fortunately, the results and methodologies described herein provide both the basis and means to identify sialylated core 1 interacting proteins in future experiments. We thank Drs. Hynda Kleinman and Kevin Campbell for purified laminin-1 and monoclonal antibody IIH6, respectively."

In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the induction of meiosis is controlled by a combination of cell type and environmental cues. Specifically, only strains heterozygous at the MAT locus that are deprived of nitrogen and a fermentable carbon source will initiate meiotic development (for a review, see Refs. 1Honigberg S.M. McCarroll R.M. Esposito R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar and 2Malone R.E. Cell. 1991; 61: 375-378Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Many genes required for meiosis are repressed during vegetative growth but exhibit a precise pattern of mRNA accumulation and decline during specific junctures in this process (3Chu S. DeRisi J. Eisen M. Mulholland J. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Herskowitz I. Science. 1998; 282: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar, 4Primig M. Williams R.M. Winzeler E.A. Tevzadze G.G. Conway A.R. Hwang S.Y. Davis R.W. Esposito R.E. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Six genes were identified (UME1-6) that are required for the vegetative repression of several genes normally transcribed early in meiosis (e.g. SPO11, SPO13) (5Strich R. Slater M.R. Esposito R.E.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2401-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies revealed that these factors can be divided into two repression systems. One system is composed of a cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase (Ume3p/Srb11p-Ume5p/Srb10p) (7Cooper K.F. Mallory M.J. Smith J.S. Strich R.

The second repression system operates through the URS1 promoter element found in several early meiotic genes (11Vershon A.K. Hollingsworth N.M. Johnson A.D. Mol. Cell.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies have confirmed the role of histone deacetylation in Ume6p-dependent repression (19Kadosh D. Struhl K. Mol. Cell.

Nature. 1998; 392: 831-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Recruitment of Rpd3p by Ume6p is mediated through the Ume4p/Sin3p co-repressor (16Kadosh D. Struhl K. Cell. 1997; 89: 365-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Sin3p contains four paired amphipathic helix (PAH) domains that direct protein-protein interactions (21Wang H. Nicholson P.R. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1743-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Deletion analysis found that of these domains, only PAH3 was required for repression of many mitotic genes (22Wang H. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1804-1815Google Scholar). A more recent study found that PAH2 directs Ume6p binding (23Washburn B.K. Esposito R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2057-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), indicating that these domains are performing independent, but coordinated, functions. However, Ume6p does not regulate many genes that are controlled by Rpd3p or Isw2 (17Fazzio T.G. Kooperberg C. Goldmark J.P. Neal C. Basom R. Delrow J. Tsukiyama T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6450-6460Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 18Goldmark J.P. Fazzio T.G. Estep P.W. Church G.M. Tsukiyama T. Cell. 2000; 103: 423-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Therefore, the early meiotic genes represent a select subset of loci that are controlled by all six of the UME factors. As indicated above, Rpd3p, Ume6p, and Isw2 activities have been studied in some detail. However, little is known about the role of the co-repressor Ume1p in controlling meiotic gene expression. Ume1p binds Rpd3p in vivo (24Kurdistani S.K. Robyr D. Tavazoie S. Grunstein M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), suggesting that it plays a role in chromatin deacetylation. However, the functional significance of this association has not been determined. The present study analyzes the requirement of Ume1p for meiotic gene repression at different stages of the yeast life cycle. In addition to mitotic cell division, Ume1p is also necessary for the rapid repression of precommitment meiotic cells returning to growth. Structure/function analysis revealed that two conserved domains shared between Ume1p and the human HDAC-binding protein p48 are required for repression and Rpd3p binding in vivo. The stable association between Rpd3p and Ume1p requires PAH3 of the Sin3p co-repressor. These studies provide a functional role for the conserved domains in the p48-Ume1p protein family. In addition, our findings suggest that Ume1p-Rpd3p-Sin3p comprise an interdependent complex that mediates transcriptional repression.

The null allele of UME1 (ume1-2) was constructed by substituting the coding region of UME1 with the URA3 selectable marker via one-step transplacement (27Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). The antisense riboprobe used to detect the 3′ end of the UME1 mRNA in S1 protection assays was derived from pBN34, a minimal subclone inserted into pRS314 (28Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pBN34 was digested with PstI and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase to produce a run-off antisense riboprobe. The probes for SPO13 and ACT1 have been described previously (29Surosky R.T. Esposito R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3948-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To construct the various UME1 derivatives, site-directed mutagenesis was performed on single-stranded DNA prepared from a centromeric plasmid containing the wild-type UME1 gene (pMM112). The NEE box deletion utilized an oligomer (5′-GACAACAAAATAAAATCAATACCCTCATTA-3′) that corresponds to bp +25 to +81 with respect to the initiator ATG with amino acids 14-22 deleted (pMM140). Trp-306 and Asp-307 were each changed to alanines (pMM168) using an oligomer 5′-GGGGCTCTCAAGGTTGCTGCTATACGTGCAGTTATC-3′. A single HA epitope tag was then introduced immediately downstream of the start codon into pMM112, pMM140, and pMM168 using oligomer 5′-TAATCACTTAAAATGTACCCATACGACGTCCCAGACTACGCTAGCACTTTAGATATT-3′ to generate pMM143, pMM144, and pMM145, respectively. All mutagenesis constructs were verified by sequence analysis. Cloning and Sequence Analysis of UME1 and ume1-1—The UME1 gene was cloned by complementing the aberrant mitotic expression phenotype of a spo13-lacZ reporter gene in a ume1-1 mutant RSY81 (5Strich R. Slater M.R. Esposito R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 10018-10022Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A yeast single-copy library (a gift from M. Rose, Princeton University) was introduced into RSY81 that harbored p(spo13)28. Of ∼3500 transformants screened, four positive isolates were recovered that exhibited reduced vegetative expression of the spo13-lacZ reporter as determined by filter assays (5Strich R. Slater M.R. Esposito R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 10018-10022Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The library plasmids from the four positives was rescued into Escherichia coli and retested to verify the complementation results. Restriction digests revealed that all four genomic inserts shared common DNA fragments, indicating that the same genetic locus had been recovered. The minimal complementing fragment was determined by subcloning DNA fragments into pRS shuttle vectors (28Sikorski R.S. Hieter P.

Nested deletions constructed in the minimal fragment using the Erase-a-base kit (Promega Inc.) were sequenced with Sequenase™ (U. S. Biochemical) using the chain termination procedure (30Sanger R. Nicklen S Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar). The UME1 sequence has been deposited with GenBank™ (accession number U10280). To determine the nature of the ume1-1 mutation, the full-length UME1 open reading frame was amplified from RSY81 (ume1-1) and RSY10 (UME1) using specific primers (+1-ATGAGCACTTTAG-+13, +1382-TTAACTTTTGGC-+1368) that contain BamHI restriction sites for convenient cloning. The amplified products were gel-purified and cloned into pVZ1 (Strategene Inc.) to facilitate DNA sequence analysis. Meiotic/Return-to-Growth S1 Protection Assays—Return-to-growth assays were performed essentially as described previously (29Surosky R.T. Esposito R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3948-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Diploid cultures were induced to enter meiosis and then either allowed to complete sporulation or challenged with glucose (final concentration 2%) during peak accumulation of SPO13 mRNA prior to meiotic commitment. Time points were taken prior to, and following, the addition of glucose. Total RNA was prepared and probed for SPO13 mRNA using S1 protection assays (31Elder R.T. Loh E.Y. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1983; 80: 2432-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The SPO13 transcript levels were quantitated using phosphorimaging (Fuji Inc.) and compared with actin (ACT1) controls. Linear regression analyses were performed to determine the SPO13 mRNA decay rate. At least three experiments were performed for each strain, and only curves with an r value >0.9 were included in the calculation. β-Galactosidase Assays—β-Galactosidase activities were measured essentially as described (32Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar). At least three independent cultures of each strain tested were grown to mid-log phase (5 × 106 cells/ml) in either synthetic dextrose or synthetic acetate-defined media to permit plasmid selection. Cells were harvested and disrupted by vigorous vortexing in the presence of glass beads. The extracts were cleared by centrifugation (13,000 × g), and soluble protein concentrations were determined using the micro dye binding assay (Bio-Rad). Multiple dilutions of each extract were assayed for β-galactosidase activities to ensure that the reactions were within the linear range. Units are presented as μmoles of o-nitrophenol produced per minute per mg of soluble protein × 1000. Western Blot/Immunoprecipitation Studies—Protein extracts were prepared from either mid-log phase or meiotic cultures as described elsewhere (7Cooper K.F. Mallory M.J. Smith J.S. Strich R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4665-4675Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). 250 μg and 1 mg of soluble protein were immunoprecipitated for protein detection and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, respectively. Straight Western blot analysis was conducted on 50 μg of soluble protein. The immunoprecipitates were collected with Protein A-Sepharose and then washed several times with PBST (phosphate-buffered saline plus Tween 20 at 0.2%) and subjected to standard SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting to Immobilon P (Millipore). Ume1p-HA was detected by probing these blots with a high affinity rat monoclonal antibody directed at the HA epitope (Roche Applied Science). Rpd3p was detected using rabbit α-Rpd3p antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). Tubulin was detected using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (a gift from V. Guacci, Fox Chase Cancer Center). Ume1p or Rpd3p signals were detected using either anti-rat or anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) and CDP-Star substrate (Tropix) as per the manufacturers' recommendations. Isolation of UME1—A DNA fragment containing the coding region of UME1 was isolated by complementing the ume1-1 mutant phenotype (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The nucleotide sequence of the minimum complementary fragment (pMM112) was determined. Analysis of the DNA sequence revealed a single large open reading frame encoding a 460-amino-acid protein (Ume1p) of a predicted molecular mass of 51 kDa. Three pieces of evidence indicate that the authentic UME1 gene was isolated. A strain carrying a deletion for the only large open reading frame in this clone was mated to a ume1-1 strain containing a spo13-lacZ reporter p(spo13)28. The resulting diploid strain still displayed the ume1 phenotype as determined by the aberrant mitotic expression of the reporter (i.e. the recessive ume1-1 allele was not complemented by the null strain). This diploid was then sporulated and subjected to tetrad analysis. Of 10 tetrads analyzed, all of the meiotic products still exhibited aberrant mitotic spo13-lacZ β-galactosidase activity, indicating that no recombination between ume1-1 and the deletion allele occurred. Finally, if the UME1 gene was isolated, then the ume1-1 locus should carry a mutation. To address this issue, the ume1-1 allele was isolated and subjected to DNA sequence analysis (see “Experimental Procedures”). Sequence analysis of three independent isolates from RSY81 revealed an identical nucleotide deletion at position +1431, which resulted in a frameshift and stop codon one residue later at amino acid 215. The combined genetic and molecular results demonstrate that the UME1 gene was isolated. Ume1p Represses SPO13 Transcription in Cultures Utilizing Fermentable or Non-fermentable Carbon Sources—To further analyze the role of UME1 in meiotic gene expression, a null allele was constructed (ume1-2, see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Viable spores harboring this allele were recovered, indicating that UME1 is dispensable for vegetative growth. Moreover, growth curves generated from wild-type and ume1-2 cultures revealed no difference in generation times in medium containing either a fermentable or a non-fermentable carbon source (data not shown). To determine the effects on SPO13 expression in a null versus a ume1-1 strain, S1 protection assays were performed on isogenic UME1 and ume1-2 strains. These experiments revealed an elevated level of SPO13 mRNA in mutant vegetative cultures as compared with wild type (Fig. 1A). Quantitation of these experiments revealed a 6-fold increase in SPO13 mRNA levels, a value observed previously for the ume1-1 allele (5Strich R. Slater M.R. Esposito R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 10018-10022Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These results suggest that truncation of Ume1p past amino acid 215 destroys the activity of this factor (see below). The derepression associated with loss of Ume1p activity is ∼20-fold below the fully induced meiotic levels (Fig. 1A, mei lane), indicating that additional UME repression activity is still active. A previous report found that UME2 and UME5 represses SPO13 expression in the presence of glucose but not in acetate medium (8Surosky R.T. Strich R. Esposito R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3446-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of glucose in UME1 activity, we measured SPO13 expression in wild-type and ume1 mutant strains growing in medium containing glucose or acetate as the carbon source. At least three independent UME1 (RSY333) and ume1-2 (MMY2-2A) cultures harboring a spo13-lacZ reporter gene (p(spo13)28) were grown to mid-log phase in either synthetic dextrose or synthetic acetate medium. The cells were harvested, and β-galactosidase activities from the spo13-lacZ reporter gene were measured (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The UME1 strain exhibited a 3-fold increase in β-galactosidase activity when the cultures were grown in acetate medium as compared with glucose (Fig. 1B). In glucose medium, the ume1-2 mutants exhibited an approximate 4-fold increase in spo13-lacZ expression as compared with wild type. A similar difference in β-galactosidase activity was observed between the mutant and wild-type strains with acetate as the carbon source. These results indicate that, unlike Ume2p and Ume5p, Ume1p still actively represses SPO13 in non-glucose medium. Ume1p Is Not Required to Re-establish Repression of Early Meiotic Genes—Previous studies have found that sin3 (5Strich R. Slater M.R. Esposito R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 10018-10022Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), rpd3 (33Vidal M. Gaber R.F. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 6317-6327Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), and ume6 (15Strich R. Surosky R.T. Steber C. Dubois E. Messenguy F. Esposito R.E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 796-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) mutants all arrest prior to meiosis I, whereas ume3/srb11 mutants exhibit more subtle meiotic phenotypes (34Cooper K.F. Strich R. Euk. Cell. 2002; 1: 67-76Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of UME1 in meiosis, both molecular and cytological parameters were examined in homozygous ume1-2/ume1-2 (MMY2) and heterozygous UME1/ume1-2 (MMY1) diploids induced to undergo synchronous meiotic divisions. No significant differences were observed in the timing of either the first or the second meiotic divisions as determined by the appearance of bi- and tetranucleated cells during the meiotic time course (data not shown). MMY2 produced asci at a rate similar to wild type although spore viability was slightly reduced from 95% in the wild type as compared with 81% for the mutant. These results suggest that Ume1p may play a modest role in spore viability. To evaluate the impact of Ume1p on early meiotic gene expression, the levels of SPO13 mRNA were monitored during a meiotic time course experiment. Samples were taken prior to the shift to sporulation medium (0 h) and continued throughout meiosis and spore formation. SPO13 mRNA levels were determined from total RNA preparations using S1 nuclease protection assays as described in Fig. 1. These S1 protection assays were not exposed to film sufficiently to detect the aberrant vegetative SPO13 transcripts as these experiments were intended to observe the mRNA accumulation kinetics during meiosis. These experiments found that SPO13 expression patterns were similar between the wild type and mutant (Fig. 2A). A small, but reproducible, elevation in SPO13 mRNA levels was observed in the mutant as compared with wild type in early time points (e.g. 3 h). These results suggest that SPO13 induction occurs more rapidly in the ume1 mutant. However, no differences were observed in the kinetics of SPO13 re-repression (9-24 h). These results suggest that the repression system utilized to silence early meiotic genes is different in vegetative cultures than in cells completing the meiotic program. UME1 Is Required for the Normal Return-to-Growth Response in Precommitment Meiotic Cells—Early meiotic genes are rapidly repressed when glucose is added to meiotic cultures prior to the commitment point (29Surosky R.T. Esposito R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3948-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To examine whether Ume1p plays a role in this response, isogenic diploids harboring either the wild-type or the null allele of UME1 were induced to enter meiosis but then challenged with glucose (2% final concentration) 6 h following shift to sporulation medium. This time point represents the peak of SPO13 mRNA accumulation (Fig. 2A) and is before the acquisition of commitment. Samples were taken prior to (0 min) and at intervals following the addition of glucose. Total RNA was prepared from these samples, and the levels of SPO13 mRNA were determined by S1 analysis (Fig. 2B). In the wild type, the half-life of SPO13 mRNA following the addition of glucose was calculated to be 4.2 min (three experiments, Fig. 2C). A similar value was reported previously (29Surosky R.T. Esposito R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3948-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, the ume1-2 mutant exhibited a 2.2-fold increase (9.3 min, three experiments) in the half-life of SPO13 mRNA. Previous studies reported that Ume1p does not affect SPO13 half-life under these conditions (29Surosky R.T. Esposito R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3948-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, these results indicate that Ume1p is involved in the rapid repression of SPO13 transcription when precommitment meiotic cells return to vegetative growth. Glucose Stimulates UME1 Transcript Levels—Ume1p represses meiotic gene expression in vegetatively growing cells and in precommitment meiotic cells returning to growth. To determine whether this factor is itself subject to transcriptional regulation, UME1 mRNA levels were measured when SPO13 expression switched from an induced to a repressed state. Specifically, UME1 mRNA levels were followed when precommitment meiotic cultures were challenged with glucose. The results from these experiments indicated that UME1 mRNA levels increased ∼2-fold coincident with the decline of SPO13 transcripts (Fig. 3A, quantitated in Fig. 3B). The elevated levels of UME1 transcript remained constant following the complete repression of SPO13 and during subsequent mitotic cell divisions (data not shown). Currently, it is not clear whether the increase in UME1 mRNA levels represents an increase in transcription initiation, stability, or both (see “Discussion”). The rapid induction of UME1 co-incident with the down-regulation of SPO13 suggests a role for this factor in the establishment, as well as the maintenance, of full transcriptional repression of SPO13. These results indicate that, unlike other UME factors studies (7Cooper K.F. Mallory M.J. Smith J.S. Strich R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4665-4675Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 8Surosky R.T.

Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 5927-5936Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), UME1 is transcriptionally regulated. However, placing UME1 on a high-copy plasmid did not alter the transcription kinetics of SPO13 during meiosis or in return-to-growth assays (data not shown). These results suggest that although UME1 mRNA levels increase during periods of peak repression activity, Ume1p levels do not appear to be rate-limiting for this control. Ume1p Association with the Histone Deacetylase Rpd3p Requires the Conserved NEE Box Motif—Previous studies have found that Ume1p and p48 associate with Rpd3p and the human histone deacetylase HDAC1, respectively (24Kurdistani S.K.

To elucidate the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme for use in computer-aided design of therapeutically relevant enzyme inhibitors, we investigated the participation of cysteine residues in disulfide linkages in a purified murine recombinant enzyme. The pattern of free and disulfide-bonded Cys residues was determined by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry in the absence and presence of dithiothreitol. Of nine highly conserved Cys residues, under both conditions, one (Cys217) is a free thiol, and eight are engaged in disulfide bonds, with pairs formed between Cys59–Cys413, Cys100–Cys172, Cys151–Cys199, and Cys372–Cys381. The only non-conserved residue within the β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase family, Cys235, is also a free thiol in the presence of dithiothreitol; however, in the absence of reductant, Cys235 forms an intermolecular disulfide linkage. Biochemical studies performed with thiolreactive agents demonstrated that at least one free cysteine affects enzyme activity and is proximal to the UDP-GlcNAc binding site. A Cys217 → Ser mutant enzyme was insensitive to thiol reactants and displayed kinetic properties virtually identical to those of the wild-type enzyme, thereby showing that Cys217, although not required for activity per se, represents the only thiol that causes enzyme inactivation when modified. Based on the pattern of free and disulfide-linked Cys residues, and a method of fold recognition/threading and homology modeling, we have computed a three-dimensional model for this enzyme that was refined using the T4 bacteriophage β-glucosyltransferase fold.

Mucin-type O-glycans expressed on the cell surface of leukocytes figure prominently in controlling cell adhesion events and, in this respect, have been shown to play a role during the initial course of the inflammatory cascade (1Fukuda M.

These sugars serve as ligands for the selectins, a family of structurally related cell-surface glycoproteins that mediate tethering and rolling of leukocytes on activated endothelial cells (3Vestweber D.

Based on these results, small molecule, orally available inhibitors of C2GnT-I activity can be expected to be of therapeutic use for the treatment of overzealous inflammatory responses that lead to pathological conditions such as reperfusion injury, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease. In this regard, the development of SLex mimics as anti-inflammatory drugs has already become an active area of research (reviewed in Ref. 32Kaila N. Thomas IV, B.E. Med. Res. Rev. 2002; 22: 566-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and soluble SLex tetrasaccharide was shown to block neutrophil invasion and acute inflammation in animal models of injury (33Mulligan M.S.

However, the short serum half-life and low affinity of the monomeric sugar ligand in solution has, thus far, limited success in discovering viable drug therapies (32Kaila N. Thomas IV, B.E. Med. Res. Rev. 2002; 22: 566-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).In support of a program focused on the development of drug-like C2GnT-I inhibitors, we initially computed two possible three-dimensional protein models of the catalytic domain of the enzyme for use in both virtual screenings and optimization of lead inhibitor candidates identified via high-throughput enzyme assay efforts (35Donovan R.S. Datti A. Baek M.-G. Wu Q. Sas I.J. Korczak B. Berger E.G. Roy R. Dennis J.W. Glycoconj. J. 1999; 16: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In order to select and refine the most likely protein fold, we conducted Cys analysis by LC/ESIMS/MS in a murine recombinant form of C2GnT-I.This study shows that of the nine highly conserved Cys residues shared by all members of the β1,6-Core2/I-GnT family, eight are engaged in disulfide bonds and one is a free thiol that, although not required for enzyme activity, is responsible for inactivation of the enzyme if modified. We also noted that the only unconserved Cys residue forms an intermolecular bridge under non-reducing conditions, thereby causing dimerization of the enzyme protein. Finally, our results show that the spatial constraints defined by the disulfide bonds, together with evidence for lack of divalent cations in the core protein, argue for a protein fold predicated upon that of T4 bacteria phage β-glucosyltransferase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Materials used for methods in molecular biology, enzymology, and cell biology were routinely purchased from reputable suppliers (specified in the text for most items) and were of the highest quality available. For the radiometric enzyme assay, UDP-GlcNAc and BSA (essentially free of fatty acids and globulins, used as a stabilizer) were from Sigma; MES (free acid) was from Calbiochem; UDP-[3H]Glc-NAc (12 Ci/mmol) was from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Canada), and the acceptor substrate Galβ1–3GalNAcα-pNp was from Rose Scientific (Edmonton, Canada). Sep-Pak C18 columns (500 mg) were purchased from Waters, and scintillation fluid (Scintisafe™ 30%) was from Fisher. Protein quantitation was performed with the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) kit from Pierce.Murine, Recombinant C2GnT-I—The procedures followed to obtain a murine C2GnT-I fusion protein have been described previously (35Donovan R.S. Datti A. Baek M.-G. Wu Q. Sas I.J. Korczak B. Berger E.G. Roy R. Dennis J.W. Glycoconj. J. 1999; 16: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A truncated cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 38–428 was prepared by PCR and fused in-frame to pPROTA vector (36Sanchez-Lopez R. Nicholson R. Gesnel M.C. Matrisian L.M. Breathnach R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11892-11899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for expression as a secreted NH2-ProteinA-C2GnT-I-COOH chimera (ProtA-C2GnT-I). The expression vector was co-transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells, along with pSV2neo, in a 10:1 molar ratio, using the calcium phosphate method. Cells were cultured in the presence of 800 μg/ml geneticin (antibiotic G418, Invitrogen), and resistant cell clones were selected and tested for C2GnT activity in culture medium. The representative clone 614 C2 showed stable expression of C2GnT activity and was selected for enzyme production. The cells were routinely propagated in minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and G418 (0.2 mg/ml). To partially purify the enzyme, IgG-Sepharose Fast Flow™ beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added in a ratio of 5 μl of a 50% bead slurry, 2.5 μl of 2 m Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, and 5 μl of 10% Tween 20 per ml of culture medium. Following incubation on a rocking platform at 4 °C for 20 h, the beads were collected by centrifugation, washed with 10 volumes of TNT buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and 2 volumes of 5 mm NH4Ac, pH 5.0. The recombinant ProtA-C2GnT-I enzyme was then eluted with 1 volume 0.5 m acetic acid, pH 3.4, and immediately resuspended in 3 volumes of 0.5 m MES, pH 7.5. The enzyme preparation was routinely passed through a 0.22-micron filter prior to storage at 4 °C in 30 mm MES buffer, pH 6.7. Purity of the ProtA-C2GnT-I protein was ∼95%, based on Coomassie Blue staining following SDS-PAGE.Production of a Murine (Cys217 → Ser) C2GnT-I Mutant—A truncated cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 34–428 of murine C2GnT-I was amplified by PCR and ligated in-frame into pFLAG-CMV™-3 vector (Sigma) using BglII and XbaI sites, for expression as a secreted fusion protein NH2-FLAG(DYKDDDDKLAAANSSIDL)-C2GnTI-COOH.The cDNA was mutated at base pair 650 where a G nucleotide was exchanged for a C nucleotide, thereby resulting in a segment encoding a mutant protein in which Cys217 was replaced with Ser. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange® kit (catalog number 200518, Stratagene). The mutated construct was transiently transfected into Chinese hamster ovary-S (CHO-S) cells (Invitrogen) using LipofectAMINE™ 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, CHO-S cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids (growth medium). cDNA (200 μg) was added to 3 ml of reduced serum medium (Opti-MEM® I, Invitrogen) and then mixed with a second 3-ml aliquot of Opti-MEM® containing 130 μl of LipofectAMINE™ 2000. After 20 min of incubation at room temperature, the cDNA/LipofectAMINE mixture was added to cells (90% confluence) that were seeded in flasks that had been treated previously for 24 h with 30 ml of growth medium. After 16 h of culture, medium was removed and tested to confirm enzyme activity. Cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen) and then cultured in 50 ml of serum-free medium (CHO-S-SFM II, Invitrogen) for 24 h. Medium was harvested and stored at 4 °C if not promptly used in the subsequent enzyme purification step. Cells were washed again in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 70 ml of CHO-S-SFM II, and cultured for an additional 36–48 h, after which medium was again collected.Purification of the FLAG-C2GnT-I (Cys217 → Ser) chimera was performed via affinity chromatography, using the ANTI-FLAG® M1 monoclonal antibody-agarose affinity gel (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions (5 ml of gel beads per 400 ml of medium). The column was washed 4 times with 50 ml of a solution made of 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm CaCl2 prior to elution of the fusion protein in 30 ml of 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, containing 2 mm EDTA and 0.05% Tween 20. Eluates were concentrated using Centricon plus-80 centrifugal filter units (30,000 molecular weight cut-off, Millipore), followed by dialysis in 30 mm MES buffer, pH 6.7. Each sample was routinely passed through a 0.22-micron filter prior to storage at 4 °C. Purity of the FLAG-(Cys217 → Ser) C2GnT-I fusion protein exceeded 98%, based on Coomassie Blue staining after SDS-PAGE.Determination of C2GnT-I Activity—A radiometric enzyme assay for C2GnT-I was performed essentially as described previously (9Yousefi S. Higgins E. Daoling Z. Pollex-Kruger A. Hindsgaul O. Dennis J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1772-1782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Datti A. Orlacchio A. Siminovitch K.A. Dennis J.W. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 206: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), using a mixture of 30 mm MES buffer, pH 6.7, 1 mg/ml BSA, 1 mm UDP-GlcNAc, 1 μCi of UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (12 Ci/mmol), 0.5 mm Galβ1–3GalNAcα-pNp as the acceptor substrate, and 10 μl of recombinant C2GnT-I enzyme (15–20 × 10-6 units), 2One unit is the amount of enzyme required to transform 1 μmol of substrate per min. in a total reaction volume of 30 μl. Reactions were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, followed by C18 Sep-Pak processing to separate the reaction product, which was then quantified based on radioactive emissions. In all instances, measurements were performed in duplicate; background was calculated under identical conditions except for the presence of enzyme and regularly subtracted from the signal.Enzyme Treatment with Thiol-reactive Agents—A fresh preparation of ProtA-C2GnT-I was divided into identical aliquots, each with ∼1 μm protein. Samples were treated with varying concentrations of iodoacetamide, 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), or N-ethylmaleimide. A control sample was prepared identically, except for the addition of thiol-specific reagents (replaced by the same volume of water). Each sample, in a total volume of 20 μl, was preincubated at 37 °C for various time points, after which 3-μl aliquots were removed from each solution and diluted with 600 μl of 30 mm MES, pH 6.7. Ten μl of the diluted protein solution (∼3.2 ng) was added to 20 μl of assay mixture to determine enzyme activity (38Kitz R. Wilson I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3245-3249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Substrate Protection Experiments—Aliquots of ProtA-C2GnT-I protein (1 μm) were preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min with various concentrations of either donor or acceptor substrate, prior to treatment with thiol-reactive agents. Controls were prepared in the same way, except for the addition of thiol reactants (replaced by an identical volume of water). The total volume in each sample was 20 μl. At various time points, 3-μl aliquots were removed from each tube and added to 600 μl of 30 mm MES, pH 6.7. Ten μl of the diluted solution, corresponding to ∼3.2 ng of enzyme protein, was used as the source of activity in the enzyme assay.Alkylation of Cys Residues for LC/ESI-MS/MS Analyses—A ProtAC2GnT-I preparation (0.14 μg/μl in 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm KCl) was split into 2 aliquots (200 μl each), one of which was treated with 1 mm DTT for 8 h at room temperature. Both samples were subjected to alkylation in the presence of 10 mm polyethylene oxide-maleimide-activated biotin (M-biotin, Pierce), which was incubated for 60 h in the dark at room temperature. M-biotin-labeled ProtA-C2GnT-I samples were denatured with 8 m urea for 1 h, after which they were transferred to a Microcon YM-30 (Millipore) unit and ultrafiltered (8,000 × g) three times with 200 μl of 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, to remove unreacted M-biotin. Prior to PNGase F digestion, the enzyme protein preparations were reconstituted in 80 μl of 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.2.Peptide-N-Glycosidase (PNGase) F Digestion—Lyophilized PNGase F (ProZyme) was dissolved in 10 mm Tris·HCl buffer, pH 7.2, containing 15 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA, at a concentration of 1250 units/ml. Two μl of this preparation was used to treat each enzyme sample overnight at 37 °C.Digestion with Trypsin, Chymotrypsin, or Endoproteinase Glu-C—Following PNGase F digestion, the ProtA-C2GnT-I sample was split into identical aliquots and digested with either trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega), chymotrypsin (sequencing grade, Roche Applied Science), or endoproteinase Glu-C (sequencing grade, Roche Applied Science). The reactions were set using a 1:20 to 1:40 ratio (w/w) of proteolytic enzyme versus ProtA-C2GnT-I. Incubations were carried out overnight at 37 °C.Identification of Free Cys Residues and Disulfide Bond Pairs—Liquid Chromatography/Electrospray Ionization-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS/MS) analyses were performed using a LCQ™ Classical ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan) with a modified electrospray ionization source (39Yen T.-Y. Yan H. Macher B.A. J. Mass Spectrom. 2002; 37: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A positive voltage of 1.8 kV was applied to the electrospray needle, and the temperature of the stainless steel heating capillary was maintained at 220 °C. The voltages at the exit end of the heating capillary and the tube lens were held at 17 and 3 V, respectively, to minimize source-induced dissociation and optimize the ESI signal of the analyte. Ion injection was controlled by automatic gain control to avoid space charge effects. The full scan mass spectrum was acquired from m/z 300 to m/z 2000. MS/MS experiments were carried out with a relative collision energy of 38%. The LC/MS analysis was conducted using a Micro-LC system (Micro-Tech Scientific) coupled to the ion trap mass spectrometer. The mobile phase was subjected to splitting prior to injection, after which a flow rate of 0.3 μl/min was established through the capillary C18 column (75 μm × 90 mm). The enzymatically digested peptides were eluted from the column using 0.1% formic acid in water (mobile phase A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (mobile phase B) using a three-step linear gradient, where phase B was 10–25% during the first 35 min, 25–35% over the next 10 min, and 35–50% in the final 10 min. The LC/ESI-MS/MS analysis was conducted using an automated data acquisition procedure, based on a cyclic use of full, zoom, and MS/MS scan modes. The most intense peak (signal >1.5 × 105 counts) in a full scan was selected as the precursor ion, upon which a high resolution zoom and an MS/MS scan were performed to determine charge state and structural fragment ions, respectively. The resulting MS/MS spectra were then screened against a protein data base using the program Sequest to confirm the sequences of the tryptic peptides.Fold Recognition and Comparative Molecular Modeling—Two glycosyltransferases were used as templates for homology modeling of C2GnT-I: (i) bacteriophage T4 β-glucosyltransferase (T4BGT, Protein Data Bank code 1JIV), which transfers glucose from UDP-glucose to DNA, and (ii) rabbit N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GnT I, Protein Data Bank code 1FOA), a medial Golgi enzyme that catalyzes the addition of N-acetylglucosamine in β1,2-linkage from UDP-GlcNAc to Man5GlcNAc2. Initially, the lack of homology with T4BGT and GnT I prompted us to align the amino acid sequence of murine C2GnT-I with that of both templates, using each fold for threading. Manual adjustments were performed based on conformational constraints dictated by pairing of Cys residues in disulfide bonds. Alignments were further adjusted by inspection of the Protein Data Bank structures, with insertions and deletions that were moved into proximal loop regions whenever they occurred inside secondary structure elements. The predicted secondary structure for C2GnT-I was obtained using the PHD server (University of Columbia) (40Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MODELER module in Insight II (Accelrys) was used for the homology modeling; the coordinates of homologous regions were transferred from each template structure to C2GnT-I following final alignments. Optimization was performed locally to remove steric side chain clashes. Three models were generated for each alignment, and the one with the lowest objective function was chosen for research applications.Sample Preparation for Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometry—One liter of stock solution of partially purified mouse ProtA-C2GnT-I in 30 mm MES, pH 6.7, was concentrated to a volume of 5"
https://openalex.org/W2043193954,"CrkII belongs to the adaptor protein family that plays a crucial role in signal transduction. In order to better understand the biological functions of CrkII, we focused on the regulation of gene expression by CrkII. Various transcriptional control elements were examined for their activation by CrkII-expression, and we found that CrkII selectively activates the serum response element (SRE), a transcriptional control element of immediate-early genes. This SRE activation induced by CrkII-overexpression was mediated by the serum response factor (SRF) via Rho. Indeed, we confirmed that the amount of activated Rho was increased in the CrkII-expressing cells. Moreover, we showed that when overexpressed, CrkII induces the cellular transformation of NIH 3T3 cells and that a dominant negative mutant of Rho suppresses this transformation, strongly suggesting that activation of Rho is essential for the transforming activity by CrkII. Furthermore, we also found that CrkII and Galpha12, a member of the heterotrimeric G proteins, synergistically activates Rho as well as the SRF, and that an SH3 mutant of CrkII can inhibit the Galpha12-induced activation of SRF. These results strongly suggest that CrkII is involved in the activation of Rho and SRF by Galpha12. Our study provides strong evidence that Rho activation plays a crucial role in CrkII-mediated signals to induce gene expression and cellular transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2034681985,"Random mutagenesis and genetic screens for impaired Raf function in Caenorhabditis elegans were used to identify six loss-of-function alleles of lin-45 raf that result in a substitution of a single amino acid. The mutations were classified as weak, intermediate, and strong based on phenotypic severity. We engineered these mutations into the homologous residues of vertebrate Raf-1 and analyzed the mutant proteins for their underlying biochemical defects. Surprisingly, phenotype strength did not correlate with the catalytic activity of the mutant proteins. Amino acid substitutions Val-589 and Ser-619 severely compromised Raf kinase activity, yet these mutants displayed weak phenotypes in the genetic screen. Interestingly, this is because these mutant Raf proteins efficiently activate the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) cascade in living cells, a result that may inform the analysis of knockout mice. Equally intriguing was the observation that mutant proteins with non-functional Ras-binding domains, and thereby deficient in Ras-mediated membrane recruitment, displayed only intermediate strength phenotypes. This confirms that secondary mechanisms exist to couple Ras to Raf in vivo. The strongest phenotype in the genetic screens was displayed by a S508N mutation that again did not correlate with a significant loss of kinase activity or membrane recruitment by oncogenic Ras in biochemical assays. Ser-508 lies within the Raf-1 activation loop, and mutation of this residue in Raf-1 and the equivalent Ser-615 in B-Raf revealed that this residue regulates Raf binding to MEK. Further characterization revealed that in response to activation by epidermal growth factor, the Raf-S508N mutant protein displayed both reduced catalytic activity and aberrant activation kinetics: characteristics that may explain the C. elegans phenotype.

The importance of the Ras signaling pathway in the regulation of cellular proliferation, differentiation, and survival has been well established using a variety of biochemical and genetic systems. One of the main Ras effectors is Raf, a serine/threonine kinase that is evolutionarily conserved in higher eukaryotes. Raf is a critical part of a signaling cascade that connects cell-surface receptors with regulatory events within the cell (1Dickson B. Sprenger F. Morrison D. Hafen E.

The activation of eukaryotic endogenous Raf molecules is dependent on relieving the interaction between the N-terminal regulatory and C-terminal kinase domain of the Raf molecule (8Heidecker G.

The initial event in Raf activation is the recruitment of Raf from the cytosol to the plasma membrane through a high affinity interaction between the switch 1 region of activated Ras-GTP and the N-terminal minimal Ras-binding domain of Raf (Raf RBD) (10Finney R.

However, the interaction between Ras and Raf alone is not sufficient for full Raf activation, because Ras-GTP cannot activate Raf unless Ras-GTP is membrane bound (12Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G.

Full Raf activation involves interaction of the Raf cysteine-rich domain (Raf CRD) with Ras and membrane phospholipids, dephosphorylation of specific Raf serine residues, and a complex series of phosphorylation events at serine, tyrosine, and threonine residues.

Disruption of the Raf·chaperone complex in vivo reduces the half-life of Raf and abrogates Ras-dependent membrane recruitment (19Cissel D.S. Beaven M.A. J. Biol.

Raf-1 knockout mice are anemic and die in utero or shortly after birth, with vascular defects in the yolk sac and placenta as well as an increase in the number of apoptotic cells throughout the embryo (28Huser M.

Intriguingly, Raf-1 Y340F/Y341F “knockin” mice, which express the kinase-inactive RafFF mutant in place of wild-type Raf-1, survive to adulthood with no detectable phenotype (28Huser M. Luckett J.

One conclusion from this study is that Raf-1 kinase function may not be required for normal mouse development. Instead, Raf-1 could play an anti-apoptotic role during development via a mechanism that is independent of its kinase function, perhaps by an interaction with the pro-apoptotic, stress activated protein kinase apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (34Chen J. Fujii K. Zhang L. Roberts T. Fu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7783-7788Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Investigation as to whether Raf-1 kinase activity is critical for Raf-1 biological function is hampered in mammalian systems due to the overlapping activities of different Raf isoforms (33Wojnowski L. Stancato L.F. Larner A.C. Rapp U.R. Zimmer A. Mech. Dev. 2000; 91: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Invertebrates have only a single Raf isoform (D-Raf in Drosophila and LIN-45 in C. elegans). In C. elegans, signaling pathways that involve Raf are used multiple times during development to control a variety of cell fate decisions (2Han M. Golden A. Han Y. Sternberg P.W. Nature. 1993; 363: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). These signaling pathways have been characterized most extensively during the formation of the hermaphrodite vulva, a specialized epithelial structure used for egg laying (35Horvitz H.R. Sternberg P.W. Nature. 1991; 351: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). A mutation that reduces the activity of a gene in the Raf signaling pathway generates a vulvaless (Vul) phenotype. By contrast, a mutation that results in constitutive activity of one of these genes results in a multivulva (Muv) phenotype. Thus, vulva formation serves as an easily visualized readout of the activity of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK-signaling pathway. This signaling pathway regulates additional cell fate decisions including differentiation of the excretory cell, which is necessary for larval viability, and progression of germ cells through pachytene stage, which is necessary for fertility (36Yochem J. Sundaram M. Han M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2716-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 37Church D.L. Guan K.L. Lambie E.J. Development. 1995; 121: 2525-2535PubMed Google Scholar). As there is only a single Raf isoform, genetic analysis in C. elegans is ideally suited to examine the functional significance of Raf within a physiological context. To characterize the function of the Raf gene, we used random chemical mutagenesis and genetic screens for worms with developmental defects to identify a collection of lin-45 raf alleles (38Hsu V. Zobel C.L. Lambie E.J. Schedl T. Kornfeld K. Genetics. 2002; 160: 481-492PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular lesions in these alleles were identified, and the mutations were classified based on phenotypic severity; they ranged from weak loss-of-function mutations that cause mild defects to strong or complete loss-of-function mutations that cause severe phenotypes. Six of the alleles contain missense mutations that result in substitution of a single amino acid. To understand the biochemical defects caused by these mutations, we engineered them into homologous residues of vertebrate Raf-1 and characterized the biochemical properties of the mutant proteins in vertebrate cells. These assays included measurements of basal kinase activity, Ras-stimulated kinase activity, membrane recruitment, and binding to 14–3–3, Hsp90, Cdc37, and MEK. Our analysis identifies functionally significant residues in the Ras-binding domain, protein kinase domain as well as MEK and 14–3–3-binding domains and demonstrates the necessity of these residues and domains for Raf activity in an animal. An interesting observation that mirrors the Raf-1 knockout mice studies recently published is that in vitro Raf kinase activity does not necessarily correlate to the in vivo function of the Raf protein. The significance of this apparently paradoxical observation is discussed. Plasmids and Mutagenesis—Raf mutant constructs were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using a human Raf-1 or B-Raf clone tagged with a FLAG or myc epitope. All constructs were sequenced prior to use. EXV-K-RasG12V, EXV-FLAG-Raf, EXV-FLAG-RafDD, and EXV-FLAG-RafCAAX have all been previously described (39Roy S. Lane A. Yan J. McPherson R. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20139-20145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Raf-GFP was constructed by subcloning the Raf-1 cDNA into pEGFP-N3 (Clontech). Cell Culture and Antibodies—COS cells and baby hamster kidney cells (BHK) were grown and maintained in HEPES-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% donor calf serum as described previously (39Roy S. Lane A. Yan J. McPherson R. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20139-20145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal antibodies, anti-Raf-1, Hsp90, and Cdc37, were obtained from Transduction Laboratories, and anti-FLAG from Eastman Kodak Co. Polyclonal anti-14–3–3 antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-Ras rat monoclonals (Y13–259 and Y13–238) were made from hybridomas acquired from the American Type Culture Collection. Polyclonal GFP antibody was obtained from I.A. Prior (University of Queensland) and monoclonal GFP antibody from Roche Applied Science. Phospho-MEK polyclonal and phospho-ERK monoclonal antibodies were purchased from New England Biolabs. Polyclonal MEK-1/2 (New England Biolabs) and ERK-1 polyclonal (Santa Cruz) were used as input control antibodies where indicated. Cell Transfection and Immunofluorescence—COS cells were electroporated as described previously (40Huang D.C.S. Marshall C.J. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2420-2431Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). After 54 h cells were switched to serum-free medium and incubated for a further 18 h before harvesting. BHK cells were seeded onto coverslips for immunofluorescence or 10-cm dishes for biochemical assays, and transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells on 10-cm dishes were maintained in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 16 h after lipofection before being harvested. Cells were washed and scraped on ice into 0.5 ml of buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 25 mm NaF, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm NaVO4). After 10 min on ice, cells were passed 25× through a 23-gauge needle and the nuclei removed by low speed centrifugation. Post-nuclear supernatants were spun at 100,000 × g. The supernatant (S100) was removed, and the sedimented fraction (P100) was rinsed and sonicated for 5 min in 100 μl of ice-cold buffer A. The S100 fraction and resuspended P100 fractions were snap-frozen and stored at –70 °C in aliquots after measuring protein content by the Bradford reaction. Cells on coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde 24 h after lipofection. The coverslips were washed for 10 min in phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, and blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. The primary antibody Y13–238 (Ras) was diluted in blocking buffer at a 1:2 to 1:30 dilution and the secondary antibody, anti-rat CY-3, used at 1:300 dilution. Raf-GFP was visualized by direct fluorescence. Western Blotting—Expression and subcellular localization of ectopically expressed proteins were determined by immunoblotting. Cellular fractions, normalized for protein content, were resolved on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using semi-dry transfer. The membranes were probed with anti-Raf-1, Y13–259 for Ras, or anti-14–3–3, anti-Hsp90, anti-CDC37, or anti-GFP monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies as appropriate, then developed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence. Where indicated immunoblots were quantified by phosphorimaging (Bio-Rad). Raf Kinase Assays—P100 aliquots of transfected cells were normalized for protein content and assayed for Raf activity using a two-stage coupled MEK/ERK assay with phosphorylation of myelin basic protein as readout (39Roy S. Lane A. Yan J. McPherson R. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20139-20145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For assays of cytosolic Raf proteins, S100 fractions were normalized for Raf content and Raf proteins immunoprecipitated with M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal or anti-GFP polyclonal antibodies as previously described (23McPherson R.A. Harding A. Roy S. Lane A. Hancock J.F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3862-3869Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were then assayed for Raf activity as above. After the kinase assays, immunoprecipitates were taken up in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted. Identification and Molecular Characterization of lin-45 raf Alleles—Alleles of lin-45 raf were identified by conducting genetic screens for C. elegans hermaphrodites with defective vulval development or sterility. To investigate how these mutations affect the activity of lin-45 and the role of lin-45 during development, the phenotypes of these mutants were characterized extensively (38Hsu V. Zobel C.L. Lambie E.J. Schedl T. Kornfeld K. Genetics. 2002; 160: 481-492PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these findings, the alleles were arranged in a series of increasing severity that is likely to correspond to an increasing loss of lin-45 activity; the series is the same whether larval lethality, vulval formation, or sterility are considered (Ref. 38Hsu V. Zobel C.L. Lambie E.J. Schedl T. Kornfeld K.

Open table in a new tab The Effect of lin-45 Loss-of-function Mutations on Ras Mediated Raf-1 Activation—To elucidate the biochemical basis of the inactivating mutations in lin-45, we initially generated the loss-of-function point mutations in lin-45. However, when expressed in mammalian cell lines the LIN-45 protein was catalytically inactive. We therefore turned to the well characterized model system of Ras-dependent Raf-1 activation in COS cells. K-Ras was used for these experiments because this mammalian Ras isoform most closely resembles C. elegans let-60 ras. Amino acid substitutions were introduced into FLAG-Raf (Raf-1 with an N-terminal FLAG epitope tag) at residues corresponding to the lin-45 loss-of-function point mutations identified in the genetic screens (Table I and Fig. 1). Briefly, the lin-45 mutations P92S, R108W, R118W, S645N, I726F, and S754F were introduced at the homologous Raf-1 residues P63S, H79W, R89W, S508N, V589F, and S619F, respectively. Wild-type and mutated FLAG-Raf-1 constructs were co-expressed with constitutively active RasG12V in COS cells. Membrane fractions of these cells were normalized for Raf-1 content, and Raf-1 kinase activity was measured in a coupled MEK/ERK assay. Fig. 2 shows that all of the lin-45 point mutations, except H79W, profoundly abrogated K-Ras-dependent Raf-1 activation. Raf-1 mutants resistant to RasG12V activation may be deficient in membrane recruitment or refractory to later membrane activation events. To examine Ras-dependent plasma membrane recruitment, the lin-45 point mutations were introduced into Raf-GFP (Raf-1 with a C-terminal GFP epitope tag). BHK cells were then co-transfected with the Raf-GFP constructs and RasG12V. Plasma membrane recruitment was assessed using confocal microscopy. Fig. 3 shows that Raf-GFP plasma membrane recruitment was abrogated by the two RBD point mutations P63S and R89W but was unaffected by the H79W substitution. None of the mutations outside of the Raf RBD compromised Raf-GFP membrane recruitment.Fig. 2Ras-dependent activation of lin-45 loss-of-function mutations. COS cells transfected with activated RasG12V and Raf-1 constructs indicated were fractionated and crude membrane (P100) fractions were immunoblotted for Ras and Raf-1 (lower panel). P100 fractions from each transfection were normalized for Raf-1 content and assayed for Raf-1 kinase activity using a coupled MEK/ERK assay (upper panel). The results show mean Raf specific activity from a single transfection assayed in duplicate. Similar results were obtained in three independent COS cell transfections.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3Ras-dependent plasma membrane recruitment of lin-45 loss-of-function mutations.

Representative cells are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Effect of lin-45 Loss-of-function Mutations on Raf-1 Basal Kinase Activity and Associated Proteins—We next examined the effect of the lin-45 point mutations on Raf-1 basal kinase activity and interaction with known associated proteins. FLAG-Raf and Raf-GFP constructs containing lin-45 point mutations were expressed equivalently in COS cells and anti-FLAG or anti-GFP immunoprecipitates prepared from the cytosolic S100 fraction. Basal Raf kinase activity in immunoprecipitates normalized for Raf-1 protein was measured in a coupled MEK/ERK assay. The results in Fig. 4 show that point mutations within the Raf RBD, P63S, H79W, and R89W, had no effect on Raf-1 basal kinase activity. In contrast, point mutations within the Raf kinase domain, S508N and V589F, and a point mutation directly adjacent to the COOH-terminal 14–3–3 binding motif (S619F) all markedly reduced basal kinase activity. Immunoprecipitates were then blotted for 14–3–3, Cdc37, and Hsp90, which are important co-factors for Raf-1 activation. (FLAG immunoprecipitates could not be blotted for Cdc37, or GFP immunoprecipitates for 14–3–3, due to secondary antibody species cross-reactivity.) The mutations P63S, V589F, and S619F severely reduced the association of 14–3–3 with Raf-1, but no mutation had any significant effect on Hsp90 or Cdc37 interactions. Thus reduced 14–3–3 association has a minimal effect on Cdc37 or Hsp90 interactions with Raf-1. Basal Raf-1 kinase activity could be reduced because of increased interaction between the N-terminal regulatory and catalytic domains, or structural disruption of the Raf-1 kinase domain. Replacement of tyrosines 340 and 341 with aspartic acid partially relieves the neg"
