https://openalex.org/W3174034037,"Background During COVID-19, the public actively sought non-pharmacological and self-management approaches to prevent infection. Little is known on the use of traditional, complementary and integrative medicine (TCIM) by the public as preventive measures. This study investigated the prevalence and patterns of TCIM use during the pandemic, and identified factors associated with its use among the general population in Hong Kong. Methods An online cross-sectional survey was conducted from November to December 2020. The survey solicited information on the respondents’ sociodemographic characteristics, risk perception of the pandemic, and use of TCIM before and during the pandemic. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine predictors of TCIM use. Results In total, 632 responses (completion rate = 88.1%) were analyzed. TCIM was used by 44.0% of respondents during the pandemic. The most popular forms of TCIM were vitamins or other dietary supplements (n = 160, 25.3%) and Chinese herbal medicine (n = 122, 19.3%) during the pandemic. The most frequently reported indication was strengthening the immune system, especially for vitamins or other dietary supplements (n = 142/160, 88.8%). Respondents who reported using TCIM were more likely to be female (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.29–2.59), had higher education attainment (aOR = 2.21, 95% CI = 1.39–3.59), and older-aged (age &gt;55 years: aOR = 1.77, 95% CI = 1.04–3.02). Respondents who resided in districts with moderate to high number of confirmed COVID-19 cases (aOR = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.07–2.42) and had a higher level of risk perception (aOR = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.01–1.07) were also more likely to use TCIM. Conclusion TCIM was used commonly in Hong Kong during the COVID-19 pandemic. While vaccination and social distancing remain the mainstay of controlling the pandemic, professional bodies should proactively consider public preferences and provide information regarding the effectiveness and safety of TCIM for COVID-19 prevention and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3180212133,"• New deep neural network models are proposed for trajectory prediction. • LSTM and GAN1 models are used for unimodal predictions, GAN3 model for multimodal. • Metrics are proposed for normalizing errors for more consistent comparisons. • New dataset are proposed with low linearity and a high diversity. Human trajectory prediction is an important topic in several application domains, ranging from self-driving cars to environment design and planning, from socially-aware robots to intelligent tracking systems. This complex subject comes with different challenges, such as human-space interaction, human-human interaction, multimodality, and generalizability. Currently, these challenges, especially generalizability, have not been completely explored by state-of-the-art works. This work attempts to fill this gap by proposing and defining new methods and metrics to help understand trajectories. In particular, new deep learning models based on Long Short-Term Memory and Generative Adversarial Network architectures are used in both unimodal and multimodal contexts. These approaches are evaluated with new error metrics, which normalize some biases in standard metrics. Tests have been assessed using newly collected datasets characterized by a higher diversity and lower linearity than those used in state-of-the-art works. The results prove that the proposed models and datasets are comparable to and yield better generalizability than state-of-the-art works. Moreover, we also prove that our datasets better represent multimodal scenarios (allowing for multiple possible behaviors) and that human trajectories are moderately influenced by their spatial region and slightly influenced by their date and time."
https://openalex.org/W3177153681,"SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome with the need of invasive ventilation. Pulmonary herpes simplex-1 (HSV-1) reactivation in invasively ventilated patients is a known phenomenon. To date very little is known about the frequency and the predisposing factors of HSV-1 reactivation in COVID-19. Therefore, we evaluated our cohort of invasively ventilated COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia for HSV-1 in respiratory specimens and combined these results with functional immunomonitoring of the peripheral blood. Tracheal secretions and bronchial lavages were screened by PCR for HSV-1 positivity. Comprehensive immunophenotyping and quantitative gene expression analysis of Interferon-stimulated genes (IFI44L, MX1, RSAD2, ISIG15 and IFIT1) and IL-1 beta were performed in whole blood. Time course of infection beginning at symptom onset was grouped into three phases (“early” phase 1: day 1–10, “middle” phase 2: day 11–30 and “late” phase 3: day 31–40). Pulmonary HSV-1 reactivation was exclusively observed in the later phases 2 and 3 in 15 of 18 analyzed patients. By FACS analysis a significant increase in activated CD8 T cells (CD38 + HLADR + ) in phase 2 was found when compared with phase 1 (p&lt;0.05). Expression of Interferon-stimulated genes (IFI44L, RSAD2 ISIG15, MX1, IFIT1) was significantly lower after HSV-1 detection than before. Taken together, reactivation of HSV-1 in the later phase of SARS-CoV-2- infection occurs in parallel with a drop of antiviral innate responsiveness as shown by decreased expression of Interferon-stimulated genes and a concurrent increase of highly activated CD38 + HLADR + CD8 T cells."
https://openalex.org/W3176687103,"Understanding the genetic structure and diversity of crops facilitates progress in plant breeding. A collection of 270 bambara groundnut (Vigna subterrenea L) landraces sourced from different geographical regions (Nigeria/Cameroon, West, Central, Southern and East Africa) and unknown origin (sourced from United Kingdom) was used to assess genetic diversity, relationship and population structure using DArT SNP markers. The major allele frequency ranged from 0.57 for unknown origin to 0.91 for West Africa region. The total gene diversity (0.482) and Shannon diversity index (0.787) was higher in West African accessions. The genetic distance between pairs of regions varied from 0.002 to 0.028 with higher similarity between Nigeria/Cameroon-West Africa accessions and East-Southern Africa accessions. The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed 89% of genetic variation within population, 8% among regions and 3% among population. The genetic relatedness among the collections was evaluated using neighbor joining tree analysis, which grouped all the geographic regions into three major clusters. Three major subgroups of bambara groundnut were identified using the ADMIXTURE model program and confirmed by discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC). These subgroups were West Africa, Nigeria/Cameroon and unknown origin that gave rise to sub-population one, and Central Africa was sub-population two, while Southern and East Africa were sub-population three. In general, the results of all the different analytical methods used in this study confirmed the existence of high level of diversity among the germplasm used in this study that might be utilized for future genetic improvement of bambara groundnut. The finding also provides new insight on the population structure of African bambara groundnut germplasm which will help in conservation strategy and management of the crop."
https://openalex.org/W3176163267,"Frailty is associated with adverse health outcomes in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Evidence supporting targeted interventions is needed. This pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) aimed to inform the design of a definitive RCT evaluating the effectiveness of a home-based exercise intervention for pre-frail and frail older adults with CKD.Participants were recruited from nephrology outpatient clinics to this two-arm parallel group mixed-methods pilot RCT. Inclusion criteria were: ≥65 years old; CKD G3b-5; and Clinical Frailty Scale score ≥4. Participants categorised as pre-frail or frail using the Frailty Phenotype were randomised to a 12-week progressive multi-component home-based exercise programme or usual care. Primary outcome measures included eligibility, recruitment, adherence, outcome measure completion and participant attrition rate. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants to explore trial and intervention acceptability.Six hundred and sixty-five patients had an eligibility assessment with 217 (33%; 95% CI 29, 36) eligible. Thirty-five (16%; 95% CI 12, 22) participants were recruited. Six were categorised as robust and withdrawn prior to randomisation. Fifteen participants were randomised to exercise and 14 to usual care. Eleven (73%; 95% CI 45, 91) participants completed ≥2 exercise sessions/week. Retained participants completed all outcome measures (n = 21; 100%; 95% CI 81, 100). Eight (28%; 95% CI 13, 47) participants were withdrawn. Fifteen participated in interviews. Decision to participate/withdraw was influenced by perceived risk of exercise worsening symptoms. Participant perceived benefits included improved fitness, balance, strength, well-being, energy levels and confidence.This pilot RCT demonstrates that progression to definitive RCT is possible provided recruitment and retention challenges are addressed. It has also provided preliminary evidence that home-based exercise may be beneficial for people living with frailty and CKD.ISRCTN87708989; https://clinicaltrials.gov/."
https://openalex.org/W4230865148,"Vehicles' trajectory prediction is a topic with growing interest in recent years, as there are applications in several domains ranging from autonomous driving to traffic congestion prediction and urban planning. Predicting trajectories starting from Floating Car Data (FCD) is a complex task that comes with different challenges, namely Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) interaction, Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) interaction, multimodality, and generalizability. These challenges, especially, have not been completely explored by state-of-the-art works. In particular, multimodality and generalizability have been neglected the most, and this work attempts to fill this gap by proposing and defining new datasets, metrics, and methods to help understand and predict vehicle trajectories. We propose and compare Deep Learning models based on Long Short-Term Memory and Generative Adversarial Network architectures; in particular, our GAN-3 model can be used to generate multiple predictions in multimodal scenarios. These approaches are evaluated with our newly proposed error metrics N-ADE and N-FDE, which normalize some biases in the standard Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE) metrics. Experiments have been conducted using newly collected datasets in four large Italian cities (Rome, Milan, Naples, and Turin), considering different trajectory lengths to analyze error growth over a larger number of time-steps. The results prove that, although LSTM-based models are superior in unimodal scenarios, generative models perform best in those where the effects of multimodality are higher. Space-time and geographical analysis are performed, to prove the suitability of the proposed methodology for real cases and management services."
https://openalex.org/W3177425940,"This paper analyses the influence of the Covid-19 coverage by the social media upon the shape of the sovereign yield curves of the five major developing countries, namely Federative Republic of B razil, Russian Federation, Republic of India, People’s Republic of China, and the Republic of South Africa (BRICS). The coherenc e between the level, slope, and the curvature of the sovereign yield term structures and the Covid-19 medi a coverage is found to vary between low and high ranges, depending on the phases of the pandemic. The empirical estimations of the yield-curve factors a re performed by means of the Diebold–Li modified version of the Nelson–Siegel model. The intervals of low coherence reveal the capacity of the two latent factors, level and slope, to be used for creating cross-factor diversification strategies, workable under crisis conditions, as evidenced on the example of the ongoing pandemic. Diverse coherence patterns are reported on a per-country basis, highlighting a promising potential of sovereign debt investments for designing cross-country and cross-factor fixed-income strategies, capable of hedging downside risks."
https://openalex.org/W3175258836,"As the world's population is expected to be over 2/3rd urban by 2050, climate action in cities is a growing area of interest in the inter-disciplines of development policy, disaster mitigation and environmental governance. The climate impacts are expected to be quite severe in the developing world, given its urban societies are densely packed, vastly exposed to natural elements while possessing limited capabilities. There is a notable ambiguity and complexity that inhibits a methodical approach in identifying urban resilience measures. The complexity is due to intersection of large number of distinct variables in climate geoscience (precipitation and temperature anomalies at different locations, RCPs, timeline), adaptation alternatives (approach, priority, intervention level) and urban governance (functional mandate, institutional capacity, and plans & policies). This research examines how disparate and complex knowledge and information in these inter-disciplines can be processed for systematic 'negotiation' to situate, ground and operationalize resilience in cities. With India as a case, we test this by simulating mid-term and long-run climate scenarios (2050 & 2080) to map regional climate impacts that shows escalation in the intensity of climate events like heat waves, urban flooding, landslides and sea level rise. We draw on suitable adaptation measures for five key urban sectors- water, infrastructure (including energy), building, urban planning, health and conclude a sleuth of climate resilience building measures for policy application through national/ state policies, local urban plans and preparation of city resilience strategy, as well as advance the research on 'negotiated resilience' in urban areas."
https://openalex.org/W3175792840,"Adolescents living with HIV comprise a significant patient population in sub Saharan Africa but are poorly retained in care with consequent increased mortality and morbidity. We conducted in-depth interviews with 25 adolescents living with HIV engaged in care from five clinics in Johannesburg regarding their recommendations for the healthcare system. Findings included advocating for adolescent clinics, recognizing the importance of clinic-based support groups, valuing the influence lay counselors have in providing healthcare to adolescents, improving widespread education of vertical HIV transmission and meaningfully linking clinics to the community. Our study offers guidance to the differentiated care model recommended for adolescent treatment highlighting that a positive youth development approach and use of lay and peer counselors may act as cornerstones of this model. Serving the mental health needs of adolescents living with HIV in a responsive manner may strengthen their use of the system and elevate it to a source of resilience."
https://openalex.org/W3177266959,"Background Life expectancy is increasing in most high-income countries, but gains in life years are maximized if spent in good health and if cognitive abilities are maintained until old age. Age-related decline of cognitive abilities does nevertheless occur, but the pace of decline is decisive. This was the starting point for our study that aims to examine cohort effects of cognitive aging in women and men in Germany, Spain and Sweden by analyzing changes from 2004 to 2013 by estimating cohort effects within age groups starting from the age of 50 years. Methods A cohort study was conducted that was based on data of the surveys 2004 (N = 6,081) and 2013 (N = 8,650) from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). The analyses were based on data of female and male respondents aged 50 years and older. Age-specific means of verbal fluency and delayed recall from the German, Spanish and Swedish samples were the cognitive domains considered in the study. Results In both domains of cognitive ability the achievements in the later surveys were higher than in the earlier ones. This was found in all countries, abut achievement levels increased markedly in the German and the Spanish samples, while the scores of the Swedish samples were not significantly different. While the highest scores were found for Sweden, Germany ranked in the middle and the lowest scores were found in the Spanish samples. Over time, the scores of the German samples approached those of Sweden. Conclusions From the first to the second survey, improvements of older adults’ cognitive abilities were found for all countries considered. This may indicate improvements of the underlying educational systems, but also increasingly stimulating general living conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3113737667,"The spread of COVID-19 in the Spring of 2020 prompted state and local governments to implement a variety of policies, including stay-at-home (SAH) orders and mandatory mask requirements, aimed at reducing the infection rate and the severity of the pandemic’s impact. We implement a discrete choice experiment survey in three major U.S. States—California, Georgia, and Illinois—to empirically quantify individuals’ willingness to stay (WTS) home, measured as the number of weeks of a potential new SAH order, to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 disease and explore factors leading to their heterogeneous WTS. Our results demonstrate broad support for statewide mask mandates. In addition, the estimate of WTS to lower new positive cases is quite large, approximately five and half weeks, even though staying home lowers utility. We also find that individuals recognize the trade-offs between case reduction and economic slowdown stemming from SAH orders when they decide to stay home or not. Finally, pandemic related factors such as age, ability to work from home, and unemployment status are the main drivers of the heterogeneity in individuals’ WTS."
https://openalex.org/W3173307070,"Purpose To develop the first normative database of macular and circumpapillary scans with reference values at the level of the A-scan using the Heidelberg Spectralis Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) machine. Methods This study is a retrospective cross sectional analysis of macular and circumpapillary OCT scans of healthy individuals. All participants had a full ophthalmic examination, including best corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure, biomicroscopy, posterior segment examination and OCT scan. The volume and thickness of each of the nine Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy zones at the macula were analysed for the total retinal thickness, retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL), ganglion cell layer (GCL) and inner plexiform layer (IPL). The thickness of the circumpapillary RNFL was analysed at the disc. Associations between age, gender, refractive error and OCT measurements were explored. De-identified A-scans were extracted from the OCT machine as separate tab-separated text file and made available according to the data sharing statement. Results Two-hundred eyes from 146 participants were included of which 69 (47%) were female. The mean age (SD) was 48.52 (17.52). Participants were evenly distributed across four age groups and represented nine broad ethnic groups in proportions comparable to the local distribution. All the macular scans were 20° x 20° (5.9 mm x 5.9 mm), with a total scan density between 12,800 and 49,152 A-scans. The peripapillary scans were all 12° (3.5 mm), at a scan density of 768 A-scans. The mean retinal, GCL and IPL volumes were significantly greater in males than females. Mean peripapillary RNFL thickness did not differ significantly between males and females. Age and total retinal volume (r = –0.2561, P = 0.0003), GCL volume (–0.2911, P &lt; 0.0001) and IPL volume (–0.3194, P &lt; 0.0001) were negatively correlated. The IPL had the strongest three significant negatively associated segments; superior inner IPL (r = –0.3444, P &lt; 0.0001), nasal outer IPL (r = –0.3217, P &lt; 0.0001) and inferior inner IPL (r = –0.3179, P &lt; 0.0001). The temporal inner macular RNFL showed a statistically significant positive correlation (r = 0.1929, P = 0.0062) with age. The only significant association between age and thickness at the peripapillary disc scan was the superior temporal sector (r = –0.1910, P = 0.0067). All retinal layers were negatively correlated for refractive error, except for the central RNFL which was positively correlated (r = 0.1426, P = 0.044). Conclusion This study provides a normative database of macular and circumpapillary scans with reference values at the level of the A-scan using the Heidelberg Spectralis Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) machine."
https://openalex.org/W3173644794,"Some developing countries are currently introducing and implementing an electronic medical record system (EMRs) for improvement in healthcare delivery services. Availability of information and communication technology (ICT), technical skillful staff, and strong resistance to change by the health professionals impacted the successful adoption of EMRs. This study aimed to assess the ICT literacy, knowledge, and readiness for EMRs adoption among health professionals in a tertiary hospital, Myanmar. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 118 health professionals involving in a tertiary hospital at Nay Pyi Taw, Myanmar from February to April 2020 using a stratified sampling method. The data were collected through face-to-face interviews using a pretested structured questionnaire after getting informed consent. Data were analyzed by using SPSS version 23.0. Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, and logistic regression analysis were performed to assess the associated factors of ICT literacy, knowledge, and overall readiness for EMRs adoption. The prevalence of high ICT literacy and knowledge on EMRs among health professionals were 20.3% and 24.6% respectively. The factors associated with ICT literacy were professional, education, duration of service, and reported English language skills. Duration of service was associated with knowledge on EMRs. The overall readiness was 54.2% (core readiness 59.3% and engagement readiness 61.9%), and postgraduate [Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR): 7.32, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 2.26-23.68] and knowledge on EMRs (AOR: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.13-1.43) were the factors associated with overall readiness for EMRs adoption. Expanding infrastructure and provision of ICT development training are crucial for the improvement of ICT literacy. EMRs training program enabling hands-on experience should be implemented for improvement of knowledge on EMRs. In general, the overall readiness for EMRs adoption was found to be moderate. Enhancing the establishment of comprehensive on-the-job training and contextualization of curriculum in EMRs training program are recommended to improve the health professionals' readiness for EMRs adoption."

Data were compared in patients who did (n = 41; BTT) and did not (n = 36; non-BTT) require pre-transplant ECMO support. Data were also compared in patients who underwent short-term (<14 days; n = 21; ST-BTT) and long-term (≥14 days; n = 20; LT-BTT) BTTs.Among 77 patients included, 51 (66.2%) were male and median age was 53 years. The median bridging time in the BTT group was 13 days (interquartile range [IQR], 7-19 days). Although simplified acute physiologic score II was significantly higher in the BTT group (median, 35; IQR, 31-49 in BTT group vs. median, 12; IQR, 7-19 in non-BTT group; p<0.001), 1-year (73.2% vs. 80.6%; p = 0.361) and 5-year (61.5% vs. 61.5%; p = 0.765) post-transplant survival rates were comparable in both groups. Comparison of ST- and LT-BTT subgroups showed that 1-year (90.5% vs. 55.0%; p = 0.009) and 5-year (73.0% vs. 48.1%; p = 0.030) post-transplant survival rates were significantly higher in ST-BTT group. In age and sex adjusted model, the LT-BTT was an independent risk factor for 1-year post-transplant mortality (hazard ratio, 3.019; 95% confidence interval, 1.119-8.146; p = 0.029), whereas the ST-BTT was not.Despite the severe illness, the BTT group showed favorable post-transplantation outcomes, particularly those bridged for less than 14 days."
https://openalex.org/W3173640694,"Weight-loss is an integral part of Huntington's disease (HD) that can start before the onset of motor symptoms. Investigating the underlying pathological processes may help in the understanding of this devastating disease as well as contribute to its management. However, the complex behavior and associations of multiple biological factors is impractical to be interpreted by the conventional statistics or human experts. For the first time, we combine a clinical dataset, expert knowledge and machine intelligence to model the multi-dimensional associations between the potentially relevant factors and weight-loss activity in HD, specifically at the premanifest stage. The HD dataset is standardized and transformed into required knowledge base with the help of clinical HD experts, which is then processed by the class rule mining and self-organising maps to identify the significant associations. Statistical results and experts' report indicate a strong association between severe weight-loss in HD at the premanifest stage and measures of certain cognitive, psychiatric functional ability factors. These results suggest that the mechanism underlying weight-loss in HD is, at least partly related to dysfunction of certain areas of the brain, a finding that may have not been apparent otherwise. These associations will aid the understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease and its progression and may in turn help in HD treatment trials."
https://openalex.org/W3174230221,"Background In cohorts with voluntary participation, participants may not be representative of the underlying population, leading to distorted estimates. If the relevant sources of selective participation are observed, it is however possible to restore the representativeness by reweighting the sample to resemble the target population. So far, few studies in epidemiology have applied reweighting based on extensive register data on socio-demographics and disease history, or with self-reported data on health and health-related behaviors. Methods We examined selective participation at baseline and the first two follow-ups of the Scania Public Health Cohort (SPHC), a survey conducted in Southern Sweden in 1999/2000 (baseline survey; n = 13,581 participants, 58% participation rate), 2005 (first follow-up, n = 10,471), and 2010 (second follow-up; n = 9,026). Survey participants were reweighted to resemble the underlying population with respect to a broad range of socio-demographic, disease, and health-related characteristics, and we assessed how selective participation impacted the validity of associations between self-reported overall health and dimensions of socio-demographics and health. Results Participants in the baseline and follow-up surveys were healthier and more likely to be female, born in Sweden, middle-aged, and have higher socioeconomic status. However, the differences were not very large. In turn, reweighting the samples to match the target population had generally small or moderate impacts on associations. Most examined regression coefficients changed by less than 20%, with virtually no changes in the directions of the effects. Conclusion Overall, selective participation with respect to the observed factors was not strong enough to substantially alter the associations with self-assessed health. These results are consistent with an interpretation that SPHC has high validity, perhaps reflective of a relatively high participation rate. Since validity must be determined on a case-by-case basis, however, researchers should apply the same method to other health cohorts to assess and potentially improve the validity."
https://openalex.org/W3175785940,"Background The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic is a global health emergency which has been shown to pose a great challenge to mental health, well-being and resilience of healthcare workers, especially nurses. Little is known on the impact of COVID-19 among nurses in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods A cross sectional study was carried out between August and November 2020 among nurses recruited from the Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi. The survey questionnaire consisted of six components- demographic and work title characteristics, information regarding care of COVID-19 patients, symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, distress and burnout, measured using standardized questionnaires. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health disorders. Results Of 255 nurses, 171 (67.1%) consented to complete the survey. The median age of the participants was 33.47 years, 70.2% were females and 60.8% were married. More than half, 64.9% were frontline workers directly engaged in COVID-19 care. Only 1.8% reported a prior history or diagnosis of any mental health disorder. Depression, anxiety, insomnia, distress, and burnout were reported in 45.9%, 48.2%, 37.0%, 28.8% and 47.9% of all nurses. Frontline nurses reported experiencing more moderate to severe symptoms of depression, distress and burnout. Furthermore, females reported more burnout as compared to males. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that after adjustment, working in the frontlines was an independent risk variable for depression and burnout. Conclusion This is one of the few studies looking at mental health outcomes among nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic in Kenya. Similar to other studies from around the world, nurses directly involved with COVID-19 patients reported higher rates of mental health symptoms. Burnout threatens to exacerbate the pre-existing severe nursing workforce shortage in low-resource settings. Cost-effective and feasible mitigating strategies, geared to low-middle income countries, are urgently needed to help cope with mental health symptoms during such a pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3176554092,"Machine learning models have increasingly been used in bankruptcy prediction. However, the observed historical data of bankrupt companies are often affected by data imbalance, which causes incorrect prediction, resulting in substantial economic losses. Many studies have proposed the insolvency imbalance problem, but little attention has been paid to the effect of the undersampling technology. Therefore, a framework is used to spot-check algorithms quickly and combine which undersampling method and classification model performs best. The results show that Naive Bayes (NB) after Edited Nearest Neighbors (ENN) has the best performance, with an F2-measure of 0.423. In addition, by changing the undersampling rate of the cluster centroid-based method, we find that the performance of the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Naive Bayes (NB) are affected by the undersampling rate. Neither of them is uniformly declining, and LDA has higher performance when the undersampling rate is 30%. This study accordingly provides another perspective and a guide for future design."
https://openalex.org/W3162671188,"Flicker light stimulation can induce short-term alterations in consciousness including hallucinatory color perception and geometric patterns. In the study at hand, the subjective experiences during 3 Hz and 10 Hz stroboscopic light stimulation of the closed eyes were assessed. In a within-subjects design (N = 24), we applied the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (mood state), time perception ratings, the Altered State of Consciousness Rating Scale, and the Phenomenology of Consciousness Inventory. Furthermore, we tested for effects of personality traits (NEO Five-Factor Inventory-2 and Tellegen Absorption Scale) on subjective experiences. Such systematic quantification improves replicability, facilitates comparisons between pharmacological and non-pharmacological techniques to induce altered states of consciousness, and is the prerequisite to study their underlying neuronal mechanisms. The resulting data showed that flicker light stimulation-induced states were characterized by vivid visual hallucinations of simple types, with effects strongest in the 10 Hz condition. Additionally, participants' personality trait of Absorption scores highly correlated with the experienced alterations in consciousness. Our data demonstrate that flicker light stimulation is capable of inducing visual effects with an intensity rated to be similar in strength to effects induced by psychedelic substances and thereby support the investigation of potentially shared underlying neuronal mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W3173765752,"Descriptive analyses of 2009-2016 were performed using the data of the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) which covers nearly 70 percent of the Thai population. The analyses described the time and geographical trends of nationwide admission rates of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its complications, including chronic kidney disease (CKD), myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular diseases, retinopathy, cataract, and diabetic foot amputation.The database of T2DM patients aged 15-100 years who were admitted between 2009 and 2016 under the UCS and that of the UCS population were retrieved for the analyses. The admitted cases of T2DM were extracted from the database using disease codes of principal and secondary diagnoses defined by the International Classification of Diseases 9th and 10th Revisions. The T2DM admission rates in 2009-2016 were the number of admissions divided by the number of the UCS population. The standardized admission rates (SARs)were further estimated in contrast to the expected number of admissions considering age and sex composition of the UCS population in each region. A linearly increased trend was found in T2DM admission rates from 2009 to 2016. Female admission rates were persistently higher than that of males. In 2016, an increase in the T2DM admission rates was observed among the older ages relative to that in 2009. Although the SARs of T2DM were generally higher in Bangkok and central regions in 2009, except that with CKD and foot amputation which had higher trends in northeastern regions, the geographical inequalities were fairly reduced by 2016.Admission rates of T2DM and its major complications increased in Thailand from 2009 to 2016. Although the overall geographical inequalities in the SARs of T2DM were reduced in the country, further efforts are required to improve the health system and policies focusing on risk factors and regions to manage the increasing T2DM."

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration Biologics Effectiveness and Safety Initiative (BEST) is expanding its analytical capacity by developing claims-based definitions-referred to as algorithms-for populations and outcomes of interest. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was of interest due to its potential association with select biologics and the lack of an externally validated International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) algorithm.Develop and apply an ICD-10-CM-based algorithm in a U.S. administrative claims database to identify and characterize AMI populations.A comprehensive literature review was conducted to identify validated AMI algorithms. Building on prior published methodology and consistent application of ICD-9-CM codes, an ICD-10-CM algorithm was developed via forward-backward mapping using General Equivalence Mappings and refined with clinical input. An AMI population was then identified in the IBM® MarketScan® Research Databases and characterized using descriptive statistics.Between 2014-2017, 2.83-3.16 individuals/1,000 enrollees/year received ≥1 AMI diagnosis in any healthcare setting. The 2015 transition to ICD-10-CM did not result in a substantial change in the proportion of patients identified. Average patient age at first AMI diagnosis was 64.9 years, and 61.4% of individuals were male. Unspecified chest pain, hypertension, and coronary atherosclerosis of native coronary vessel/artery were most commonly reported within one day of AMI diagnosis. Electrocardiograms were the most common medical procedure and beta-blockers were the most commonly ordered cardiac medication in the one day before to 14 days following AMI diagnosis. The mean length of inpatient stay was 5.6 days (median 3 days; standard deviation 7.9 days). Findings from this ICD-10-CM-based AMI study were internally consistent with ICD-9-CM-based findings and externally consistent with ICD-9-CM-based studies, suggesting that this algorithm is ready for validation in future studies."

Binge or hazardous drinking may do greater alcohol-related damage to the developing fetus than drinking a comparable amount spread over several days or weeks. This study aimed to identify determinants of hazardous alcohol use among pregnant women attending antenatal care at Gondar town public health facilities, Northwest Ethiopia.An unmatched facility-based nested case-control study was carried out to identify the determinants of hazardous alcohol use among pregnant women within a prospective cohort study from 29 October 2019 to 7 May 2020. A two-stage random sampling technique was used to select 455 (113 cases and 342 controls) pregnant women. Data collection was performed using the AUDIT-C standardized and pretested questionnaire. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were computed to identify the predictors of alcohol consumption using the odds ratio, 95% CI, and p-value < 0.05.Multivariable logistic regression model revealed that no formal education of the husbands [AOR = 2.79; 95%CI: 1.24, 6.29], being housewife[AOR = 2.43; 95%CI: 1.12, 5.26], poor household wealth index[AOR = 2.65; 95%CI: 1.07, 6.54], unplanned pregnancy [AOR = 4.36;95%CI: 2.44, 7.79], poor social support [AOR = 4.9;95%CI: 2.4, 10.04], depression[AOR = 3.84;95%CI: 2.16, 6.82], and not ever heard the risk of alcohol drinking during pregnancy [AOR = 1.97; 95%CI: 1.08, 3.58] were significantly associated with hazardous alcohol use.Routine alcohol screening during ANC visits creates an appropriate referral system for clinical management and provides an opportunity for healthcare workers to offer information on the potential risks associated with alcohol use in pregnancy. Antenatal care providers have a special role to play in assuring that women receive adequate advice about alcohol use and care to manage the problems especially for pregnant women with depression, poor social support, unplanned pregnancy, low socioeconomic status, and for housewives during the antenatal visits. The warning marks on alcoholic beverages including an ongoing message about the risks of alcohol use during pregnancy could be public health good strategies to minimize preventable harms attributed to alcohol consumption during pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W3176031404,"Investigation reveals that a high percentage of incident causes are ascribed to some forms of human error. To effectively prevent incidents from happening, Human Reliability Analysis (HRA), as a structured way to represent unintentional operator contribution to system reliability, is a critical issue. Human Error Reduction and Assessment Technique (HEART) as a famous HRA technique, provides a straightforward method to estimate probabilities of human error based on the analysis of tasks. However, it faces varying levels of uncertainty in assigning of weights to each error producing condition (EPC), denoted as assessed proportion of affect (APOA), by experts. To overcome this limitation and consider the confidence level (reliability or credibility) of the experts, the current study aimed at proposing a composite HEART methodology for human error probability (HEP) assessment, which integrates HEART and Z-numbers short for, Z-HEART. The applicability and effectiveness of the Z-HEART has been illustrated in the de-energization power line as a case study. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is fulfilled to investigate the validity of the proposed methodology. It can be concluded that Z-HEART is feasible for assessing human error, and despite the methodological contributions, it offers many advantages for electricity distribution companies."

https://openalex.org/W3174799204,"Climate change and anthropogenic modifications to the landscape can have both positive and negative effects on an animal. Linking landscape change to physiological stress and fitness of an animal is a fundamental tenet to be examined in applied ecology. Cortisol is a glucocorticoid hormone that can be used to indicate an animal's physiological stress response. In the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California, fishers (Pekania pennanti) are a threatened mesocarnivore that have been subjected to rapid landscape changes due to anthropogenic modifications and tree mortality related to a 4-year drought. We measured cortisol concentrations in the hair of 64 fishers (41 females, 23 males) captured and radio-collared in the Sierra National Forest, California. We addressed two main questions: (1) Is the physiological stress response of fishers influenced by anthropogenic factors, habitat type, canopy cover, and tree mortality due to drought in their home range? (2) Does the physiological stress response influence survival, reproduction, or body condition? We examined these factors within a fisher home range at 3 scales (30, 60, 95% isopleths). Using model selection, we found that tree mortality was the principle driver influencing stress levels among individual fishers with female and male fishers having increasing cortisol levels in home ranges with increasing tree mortality. Most importantly, we also found a link between physiological stress and demography where female fishers with low cortisol levels had the highest annual survival rate (0.94), whereas females with medium and high cortisol had lower annual survival rates, 0.78 and 0.81, respectively. We found no significant relationships between cortisol levels and body condition, male survival, or litter size. We concluded that tree mortality related to a 4-year drought has created a ""landscape of stress"" for this small, isolated fisher population."
https://openalex.org/W3175392830,"Introduction Antibiotics are commonly used for the treatment and prevention of bacterial infections. The potency of antibiotics can be affected by factors such as temperature, light, moisture, and storage conditions. Inappropriate storage and transportation of antibiotics may lead to loss of potency earlier than the expiry date. The aim of this study was to determine the potency and associated factors of commonly retailed antibiotics. Method Institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted on commonly retailed antibiotics in pharmacies that are available in Adama, Ethiopia from March 2018 to June 2018. This study focused on commonly ordered antibiotics such as amoxicillin, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, and ceftriaxone. Antibiotics to be tested were selected by using a simple random sampling technique. Socio-demographic and related data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using the disc diffusion method as described in the Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute guideline. Results Mean inhibition zones of amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, and ceftriaxone were 14.2 ± 4 mm, 30.9 ± 4.2 mm, 17.47 ± 3.83 mm, and 32.7±1.8 respectively. Out of 164 antibiotics tested, 61% passed the potency test. The potency of antibiotics varies across different countries in which 53.7% and 54.6 of antibiotics from India and Ethiopia passed the potency test. All ceftriaxone tested in this study passed the potency test. Factors such as air condition of pharmacy (X 2 = 4.27; p = 0.039), source of all antibiotics (X 2 = 5.41; p = 0.02), and source of amoxicillin (X 2 = 4.73; p = 0.03) were significantly associated with potency of antibiotics. Conclusions About 40% of antibiotics tested in the current study did not pass the potency test; this warrants further investigation to identify the magnitude of the problem and its causes at a large scale."
https://openalex.org/W3176040620,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of acute respiratory infection in children. One of the most important strategies for treatment of an RSV infection is to decide whether the patient needs respiratory support. This study aimed to assess the validity and clinical benefit of the Global Respiratory Severity Score (GRSS) and the Wang bronchiolitis severity score (WBSS) for clinical decision-making regarding providing respiratory support (high-flow nasal cannula, nasal continuous positive airway pressure, or ventilator) in infants with an RSV infection.This retrospective cohort study enrolled 250 infants aged under 10 months who were admitted to Atsugi City Hospital with an RSV infection between January 2012 and December 2019. The utility of these scores was evaluated for assessing the need for respiratory support through decision curve analysis by calculating the optimal GRSS and WBSS cut-offs for predicting the need for respiratory support.Twenty-six infants (10.4%) received respiratory support. The optimal cut-offs for the GRSS and the WBSS were 4.52 and 7, respectively. Decision curve analysis suggested that the GRSS was a better predictive tool than the WBSS if the probability of needing respiratory support was 10-40%.The GRSS was clinically useful in determining the need for respiratory support in infants aged under 10 months with an RSV infection."
https://openalex.org/W3176486401,"Accurate data on HIV-related mortality are necessary to evaluate the impact of HIV interventions. In low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), mortality data obtained through civil registration are often of poor quality. Though not commonly conducted, mortuary surveillance is a potential complementary source of data on HIV-associated mortality.During April-July 2019, we assessed HIV prevalence, the attributable fraction among the exposed, and the population attributable fraction among decedents received by two high-volume mortuaries in Kisumu County, Kenya, where HIV prevalence in the adult population was estimated at 18% in 2019 with high ART coverage (76%). Stillbirths were excluded. The two mortuaries receive 70% of deaths notified to the Kisumu East civil death registry; this registry captures 45% of deaths notified in Kisumu County. We conducted hospital chart reviews to determine the HIV status of decedents. Decedents without documented HIV status, including those dead on arrival, were tested using HIV antibody tests or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) consistent with national HIV testing guidelines. Decedents aged less than 15 years were defined as children. We estimated annual county deaths by applying weights that incorporated the study period, coverage of deaths, and mortality rates observed in the study.The two mortuaries received a total of 1,004 decedents during the study period, of which 95.1% (955/1004) were available for study; 89.1% (851/955) of available decedents were enrolled of whom 99.4% (846/851) had their HIV status available from medical records and post-mortem testing. The overall population-based, age- and sex-adjusted mortality rate was 12.4 per 1,000 population. The unadjusted HIV prevalence among decedents was 28.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): 25.5-31.6). The age- and sex-adjusted mortality rate in the HIV-infected population (40.7/1000 population) was four times higher than in the HIV-uninfected population (10.2/1000 population). Overall, the attributable fraction among the HIV-exposed was 0.71 (95% CI: 0.66-0.76) while the HIV population attributable fraction was 0.17 (95% CI: 0.14-0.20). In children the attributable fraction among the exposed and population attributable fraction were 0.92 (95% CI: 0.89-0.94) and 0.11 (95% CI: 0.08-0.15), respectively.Over one quarter (28.5%) of decedents received by high-volume mortuaries in western Kenya were HIV-positive; overall, HIV was considered the cause of death in 17% of the population (19% of adults and 11% of children). Despite substantial scale-up of HIV services, HIV disease remains a leading cause of death in western Kenya. Despite progress, increased efforts remain necessary to prevent and treat HIV infection and disease."
https://openalex.org/W3173227318,"We performed large-scale numerical simulations using a composite model to investigate the infection spread in a supermarket during a pandemic. The model is composed of the social force, purchasing strategy and infection transmission models. Specifically, we quantified the infection risk for customers while in a supermarket that depended on the number of customers, the purchase strategies and the physical layout of the supermarket. The ratio of new infections compared to sales efficiency (earned profit for customer purchases) was computed as a factor of customer density and social distance. Our results indicate that the social distance between customers is the primary factor influencing infection rate. Supermarket layout and purchasing strategy do not impact social distance and hence the spread of infection. Moreover, we found only a weak dependence of sales efficiency and customer density. We believe that our study will help to establish scientifically-based safety rules that will reduce the social price of supermarket business."
https://openalex.org/W3173788836,"Chemokines are small proteins that promote leukocyte migration during development, infection, and inflammation. We and others isolated the unique chemokine CCL21, a potent chemo-attractant for naïve T-cells, naïve B-cells, and immature dendritic cells. CCL21 has a 37 amino acid carboxy terminal extension that is distinct from the rest of the chemokine family, which is thought to anchor it to venule endothelium where the amino terminus can interact with its cognate receptor, CCR7. We and others have reported that venule endothelium expressing CCL21 plays a crucial role in attracting naïve immune cells to sites of antigen presentation. In this study we generated a series of monoclonal antibodies to the amino terminus of CCL21 in an attempt to generate an antibody that blocked the interaction of CCL21 with its receptor CCR7. We found one humanized clone that blocked naïve T-cell migration towards CCL21, while memory effector T-cells were less affected. Using this monoclonal antibody, we also demonstrated that CCL21 is expressed in the mucosal venule endothelium of the large majority of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, and also in celiac disease. This expression correlated with active IBD in 5 of 6 cases, whereas none of 6 normal bowel biopsies had CCL21 expression. This study raises the possibility that this monoclonal antibody could be used to diagnose initial or recurrent of IBD. Significantly, this antibody could also be used for therapeutic intervention in IBD by selectively interfering with recruitment of naïve immune effector cells to sites of antigen presentation, without harming overall memory immunity."
https://openalex.org/W3174366153,"While the issue of individual variation has been widely studied in second language learning or processing, it is less well understood how perceptual and musical aptitude differences can explain individual variation in native speech processing. In the current study, we make use of tone merger in Hong Kong Cantonese, an ongoing sound change that concerns the merging of tones in perception, production or both in a portion of native speakers, to examine the possible relationship between tone merger and musical and pitch abilities. Although a previous study has reported the occurrence of tone merger independently of musical training, it has not been investigated before whether tone-merging individuals, especially those merging tones in perception, would have inferior musical perception and fine-grained pitch sensitivities, given the close relationship of speech and music. To this end, we tested three groups of tone-merging individuals with various tone perception and production profiles on musical perception and pitch threshold tasks, in comparison to a group of Cantonese speakers with congenital amusia, and another group of controls without tone merger or amusia. Additionally, the amusics were compared with tone-merging individuals on the details of their tone discrimination and production profiles. The results showed a clear dissociation of tone merger and amusia, with the tone-merging individuals exhibiting intact musical and pitch abilities; on the other hand, the amusics demonstrated widespread difficulties in tone discrimination yet intact tone production, in contrast to the highly selective confusion of a specific tone pair in production or discrimination in tone-merging individuals. These findings provide the first evidence that tone merger and amusia are distinct from each other, and further suggest that the cause of tone merger may lie elsewhere rather than being driven by musical or pitch deficits. We also discussed issues arising from the current findings regarding the neural mechanisms of tone merger and amusia."
https://openalex.org/W3174474203,"The open burning of agricultural crop residue is a key environmental issue facing the Hindu Kush Himalaya region, the Indo-Gangetic plain in particular. There is a varying intensity in the incidence of open agricultural burning in this region, and multiple drivers that determine why farmers in this region decide to burn their crop residues. While there have been research studies conducted for other countries in the region, research into the determinants of crop-burning in the Nepalese context is missing. Using primary data from a survey of 388 farming households across three districts of the Nepal Terai―Nawalparasi, Rupandehi and Kapilvastu―applying a recursive bivariate probit model, this study seeks to find out what drives the Nepalese farmers to burn their crop residue instead of using them in a sustainable manner and suggest policy recommendations for mitigation. Our findings show that the major determining factors that influence the farmers’ behavior in Nepal are livestock ownership, combine harvester use and awareness level of the farmers. While the effects of crop residue burning is transboundary in nature, the mitigation measures require to be region specific. Based on the findings, the study proposes raising livestock, using technology like Happy Seeders or upgrade the combine harvesters, raising awareness and changing perception of farmers, and promoting alternative uses of crop residue as viable mitigation measures."
https://openalex.org/W3176584963,"Assessing species status and making classification decisions under the Endangered Species Act is a critical step towards effective species conservation. However, classification decisions are liable to two errors: i) failing to classify a species as threatened or endangered that should be classified (underprotection), or ii) classifying a species as threatened or endangered when it is not warranted (overprotection). Recent surveys indicate threatened spectacled eider populations are increasing in western Alaska, prompting the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to reconsider the federal listing status. There are multiple criteria set for assessing spectacled eider status, and here we focus on the abundance and decision analysis criteria. We estimated population metrics using state-space models for Alaskan breeding populations of spectacled eiders. We projected abundance over 50 years using posterior estimates of abundance and process variation to estimate the probability of quasi-extinction. The decision analysis maps the risk of quasi-extinction to the loss associated with making a misclassification error (i.e., underprotection) through a loss function. Our results indicate that the Yukon Kuskokwim Delta breeding population in western Alaska has met the recovery criteria but the Arctic Coastal Plain population in northern Alaska has not. The methods employed here provide an example of accounting for uncertainty and incorporating value judgements in such a way that the decision-makers may understand the risk of committing a misclassification error. Incorporating the abundance threshold and decision analysis in the reclassification criteria greatly increases the transparency and defensibility of the classification decision, a critical aspect for making effective decisions about species management and conservation."
https://openalex.org/W3177125089,"The perception of moving objects (real motion) is a critical function for interacting with a dynamic environment. Motion perception can be also induced by particular structural features of static images (illusory motion) or by photographic images of subjects in motion (implied motion, IM). Many cortical areas are involved in motion processing, particularly the medial temporal cortical area (MT), dedicated to the processing of real, illusory, and implied motion. Recently, there has been a growing interest in the influence of high-level visual processes on pupillary responses. However, just a few studies have measured the effect of motion processing on the pupil, and not always with consistent results. Here we systematically investigate the effects of real, illusory, and implied motion on the pupil diameter for the first time, by showing different types of stimuli (movies, illusions, and photos) with the same average luminance to the same observers. We find different pupillary responses depending on the nature of motion. Real motion elicits a larger pupillary dilation than IM, which in turn induces more dilation than control photos representing static subjects (No-IM). The pupil response is sensitive even to the strength of IM, as photos with enhanced IM (blur, motion streaks, speed lines) induce larger dilation than simple freezed IM (subjects captured in the instant they are moving). Also, the subject represented in the stimulus matters: human figures are interpreted as more dynamic and induce larger dilation than objects/animals. Interestingly, illusory motion induces much less dilation than all the other motion categories, despite being seen as moving. Overall, pupil responses depend on the individual perception of dynamicity, confirming that the pupil is modulated by the subjective interpretation of complex stimuli. We argue that the different pupillary responses to real, illusory, and implied motion reflect the top-down modulations of different cortical areas involved in their processing."

In this study, Enterococcus thailandicus TC1 was first isolated in healthy pigs in Tongcheng, China and identified by phenotypic analysis and 16S rRNA-based techniques. To evaluate the strain safety, an approach including virulence factors, antibiotic resistance, and animal experiments was adopted. The results show that cylA , gelE , esp , agg , ace , efaAfm , efaAfs , ptsD genes were undetected, and that the strain was sensitive or poorly resistant to some clinically relevant antibiotics. However, the isolated strain demonstrated β-hemolytic activity in rabbit blood agar plates. Analysis of animal experiments revealed that the isolated strain had no adverse effect on translocation and the internal organ indices, though significant differences in histology (villi height, crypts height) of ileum were observed. The data acquired suggest that E . thailandicus TC1 may be associated with a potential health risk."
https://openalex.org/W3174743296,"Background The Covid-19 pandemic has had unprecedented effects on individual lives and livelihoods as well as on social, health, economic and political systems and structures across the world. This article derives from a unique collaboration between researchers and museums using rapid response crowdsourcing to document contemporary life among the general public during the pandemic crisis in Sweden. Methods and findings We use qualitative analysis to explore the narrative crowdsourced submissions of the same 88 individuals at two timepoints, during the 1 st and 2 nd pandemic waves, about what they most fear in relation to the Covid-19 pandemic, and how their descriptions changed over time. In this self-selected group, we found that aspects they most feared generally concerned responses to the pandemic on a societal level, rather than to the Covid-19 disease itself or other health-related issues. The most salient fears included a broad array of societal issues, including general societal collapse and fears about effects on social and political interactions among people with resulting impact on political order. Notably strong support for the Swedish pandemic response was expressed, despite both national and international criticism. Conclusions This analysis fills a notable gap in research literature that lacks subjective and detailed investigation of experiences of the general public, despite recognition of the widespread effects of Covid-19 and its’ management strategies. Findings address controversy about the role of experts in formulating and communicating strategy, as well as implications of human responses to existential threats. Based on this analysis, we call for broader focus on societal issues related to this existential threat and the responses to it."
https://openalex.org/W3174933438,"Supported by the German Alliance Against Depression, 82 regions in Germany launched their own community-based multi-level intervention programs targeting both depression and suicidal behavior prior to January 2016. Sixteen of these regions have implemented the full 4-level intervention program comprising 1) training of General Practitioners, 2) a public awareness campaign, 3) training of community facilitators and 4) support for depressed patients and their relatives for at least three years. The aim of the study was to examine possible suicide prevention effects in these sixteen 4-level intervention regions (comprising a population of 6,976,309) by 1) comparing the annual suicide rates during the 3-year intervention period to a 10-year baseline and 2) comparing these differences to corresponding trends in Germany after excluding all intervention regions (Germany-IR). Primary outcome was the annual rate of suicides. Analyses included negative binomial regression models. When examining differences between suicide rates during the intervention period compared to the baseline period, only a trend towards a significant reduction was found. This reduction of suicides in the sixteen 4-level intervention regions did not differ from that in Germany-IR as control. The interpretation of these findings has to take into account that the training of General Practitioners, police and other community facilitators might have improved the recognition of suicides, thus increasing detection rates. Furthermore, destigmatizing effects of the public awareness campaigns might have increased the number of suicides by lowering suicide threshold (“normalization”) for those at risk and by decreasing the rate of suicides deliberately hidden by suicide victims or their relatives."

Material and methods A questionnaire was released, at the national level, to health professionals with HD management expertise. Questionnaire included 21 questions that were scored using a Likert scale: 0 (null probability) to 4 (very high probability). The internal consistency and reliability of the questionnaire were calculated using Cronbach’s alpha and the intraclass correlation coefficient, respectively. Results 144 questionnaires (response rate 70.2%) were obtained: 65 (45.1%) were nurses, 42 (28.9%) occupational physicians, and 37 (26.1%) were pharmacists. Cronbach’s alpha was 0.93, and intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.94 (95% CI 0.91–0.97; p-value &lt; 0.001). The mean probability was 1.95 ± 1.02 (median 1.9; minimum: 0.05; 1st quartile 1.1; 3rd quartile 2.6; and maximum 4). Differences were observed in scoring among professional groups (occupational physicians versus nurses (1.6/2.1, p = 0.044); pharmacists versus nurses (1.7/2.1, p = 0.05); and occupational physicians versus pharmacists (1.6/1.7, p = 0.785), due mainly to the administration stage (p = 0.015). Conclusions The perception of risk of exposure was moderate, being higher for nurses. It would be advisable to integrate HDs into a standardized management system (risk management model applicable to any healthcare center) to improve the safety of health professionals."
https://openalex.org/W3177266012,"Joint kinetic characteristics during the eccentric phase are important in resistance exercises because eccentric actions with elastic potential energy storage lead to the energy recoil with large joint moment and power generation during the subsequent concentric phase. Previous studies assessed the force production capacity in the barbell hip thrust; however, these were reported by the methodology using only surface electromyographic amplitudes recorded in the lower back and thigh muscles and did not focus on eccentric action. This study aimed to determine kinetic characteristics of lumbosacral, hip and knee joints of sprinters during the eccentric and concentric phases in a barbell hip thrust, compared to those of deadlift and back squat. Eleven well-trained male sprinters participated in this study. Each participant performed two full ranges of motion repetition using their previously determined six-repetition maximum loads. During strength exercises, reflective marker displacements attached to the body and a barbell were captured using 22 high-speed cameras, and ground reaction forces were captured using 4 force plates simultaneously. In the barbell hip thrust, as well as deadlift, the peak values of the lumbosacral and hip extension moments were generated almost immediately after the eccentric phase and were 24% and 42% larger than those in the back squat, respectively. In the knee joint, the largest was the peak extension moment in the back squat (155 ± 28 Nm), followed in order by that in the barbell hip thrust (66 ± 33 Nm) and that in the deadlift (24 ± 27 Nm). These demonstrated that a barbell hip thrust, as well as deadlift, can be a resistance exercise to strengthen the lower back and posterior thigh muscles. Thus, these resistance exercises may be able to be used separately according to their intended purposes, enabling transformations of strength training to specific dynamic motions such as sprint running."
https://openalex.org/W3173261987,"This paper presents regulation of an asynchronous induction motor so as to create a stable vacuum milk pump using Variable Frequency Drive (VFD). Contribution includes providing information about the usage of the VFD, which regulates the activity of an asynchronous induction motor so that the vacuum pump milking machine creates stable vacuum. The paper describes the functional and time dependence of input values and output parameters of frequency converters at changing electric motor speed. For simulation and verification the milking process a mathematical model of the milking machine was created. The simulation was verified in Matlab/Simulink software. The constructed mathematical model showed symmetric regulation. Control model symmetry was verified at the laboratory of milking machine. The possibility to remove the control valve from milking equipment was proven using the measured data. It was found that constant vacuum values can be maintained. A constant vacuum can be maintained by changing vacuum pump speed. This control is of an accepted standard (ISO 5707: 2007). The power saving control values (on the milking equipment) of the VFD were positive throughout the measuring range. The performance of the milking vacuum pump is normally designed from the maximum air consumption of the milking machine at nominal vacuum (50 kPa), and a performance reserve is added to this. This means that the pump is operated between the ranges 7.53 and 15.06 dm3 s-1. By using a vacuum pump controlled by a VFD, power savings can be achieved from 32.50% to 54.02% compared to a control valve."

We use the UK Department of Transport Annual Average Daily Flow (AADF) data, which records traffic flows for seven transport modes (including cars, buses, bicycles, heavy and light goods vehicles). Using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that the introduction of the WEZ led to a 4.9% decline in road traffic flows in the new congestion charge area. These results are robust to different model specifications. HGVs traffic did not significantly change post-WEZ, which indicates that their road demand is price inelastic. The removal of the WEZ led to no significant variations in traffic. This result indicates asymmetry in behaviour with persistent changes in post-intervention traffic demand levels."
https://openalex.org/W3174110264,"Background Bunyamwera(BUNV) and Ngari (NGIV) viruses are arboviruses of medical importance globally, the viruses are endemic in Africa, Aedes(Ae) aegypti and Anopheles(An) gambiae mosquitoes are currently competent vectors for BUNV and NGIV respectively. Both viruses have been isolated from humans and mosquitoes in various ecologies of Kenya. Understanding the risk patterns and spread of the viruses necessitate studies of vector competence in local vector population of Ae . simpsoni sl which is abundant in the coastal region. This study sought to assess the ability of Ae . Simpsoni sl mosquitoes abundant at the Coast of Kenya to transmit these viruses in experimental laboratory experiments. Methods Field collected larvae/pupae of Ae . Simpsoni sl mosquitoes from Rabai, Kilifi County, were reared to adults, the first filial generation (F0) females’ mosquitoes were orally exposed to infectious blood meal with isolates of the viruses using the hemotek membrane feeder. The exposed mosquitoes were incubated under insectary conditions and sampled on day 7, 14 and 21days post infection to determine susceptibility to the virus infection using plaque assay. Results A total of 379 (Bunyamwera virus 255 and Ngari virus 124) Ae . simpsoni sl were orally exposed to infectious blood meal. Overall, the infection rate (IR) for BUNV and NGIV were 2.7 and 0.9% respectively. Dissemination occurred in 5 out 7 mosquitoes with mid-gut infection for Bunyamwera virus and 1 out of 2 mosquitoes with mid-gut infection for Ngari virus. Further, the transmission was observed in 1 out of 5 mosquitoes that had disseminated infection and no transmission was observed for Ngari virus in all days post infection (dpi). Conclusion Our study shows that Ae . simpsoni sl . is a laboratory competent vector for Bunyamwera virus since it was able to transmit the virus through capillary feeding while NGIV infection was restricted to midgut infection and disseminated infection, these finding adds information on the epidemiology of the viruses and vector control plan."
https://openalex.org/W3175439792,"Technologies and practices that reduce the environmental impacts of US agriculture are well documented. Less is known about how best to encourage their adoption. We report on the results of a large randomized controlled trial conducted with nearly 10,000 agricultural producers in the United States. The experiment was embedded in US Department of Agriculture outreach efforts to improve soil conservation practices. USDA varied the content of mailings to test two sets of competing theories about outreach to agricultural producers. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find no evidence that acknowledging the link between climate change and agricultural production discourages conservation action. Furthermore, we find that producers who were invited to a webinar were less likely to take any action to learn more about conservation practices than producers who were not told about the webinar, a result that runs counter to the popular wisdom that offering more options leads to more action."
https://openalex.org/W3175967701,"Some mutations in the HIV-1 Gag gene are known to confer resistance to ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors (PI/r), but their clinical implications remain controversial. This review aims at summarizing current knowledge on HIV-1 Gag gene mutations that are selected under PI/r pressure and their distribution according to viral subtypes.Randomized and non-randomized trials, cohort and cross-sectional studies evaluating HIV-1 Gag gene mutations and protease resistance associated mutations, will all be included. Searches will be conducted (from January 2000 onwards) in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILAC), Web of Science, African Journals Online, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases. Hand searching of the reference lists of relevant reviews and trials will be conducted and we will also look for conference abstracts. Genotypic profiles of both Gag gene and the protease region as well as viral subtypes (especially B vs. non B) will all serve as comparators. Primary outcomes will be the ""prevalence of Gag mutations"" and the ""prevalence of PI/r resistance associated mutations"". Secondary outcomes will be the ""rate of treatment failure"" and the distribution of Gag mutations according to subtypes. Two reviewers will independently screen titles and abstracts, assess the full texts for eligibility, and extract data. If data permits, random effects models will be used where appropriate. This study will be reported according to the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses.This systematic review will help identify HIV-1 Gag gene mutations associated to PI/r-based regimen according to viral subtypes. Findings of this review will help to better understand the implications of the Gag gene mutations in PI/r treatment failure. This may later justify considerations of Gag-genotyping within HIV drug resistance interpretation algorithms in the clinical management of patients receiving PI/r regimens.PROSPERO: CRD42019114851."
https://openalex.org/W3176256077,"In power system networks, automatic fault diagnosis techniques of switchgears with high accuracy and less time consuming are important. In this work, classification of abnormal location in switchgears is proposed using hybrid gravitational search algorithm (GSA)-artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. The measurement data were obtained from ultrasound, transient earth voltage, temperature and sound sensors. The AI classifiers used include artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM). The performance of both classifiers was optimized by an optimization technique, GSA. The advantages of GSA classification on AI in classifying the abnormal location in switchgears are easy implementation, fast convergence and low computational cost. For performance comparison, several well-known metaheuristic techniques were also applied on the AI classifiers. From the comparison between ANN and SVM without optimization by GSA, SVM yields 2% higher accuracy than ANN. However, ANN yields slightly higher accuracy than SVM after combining with GSA, which is in the range of 97%-99% compared to 95%-97% for SVM. On the other hand, GSA-SVM converges faster than GSA-ANN. Overall, it was found that combination of both AI classifiers with GSA yields better results than several well-known metaheuristic techniques."
https://openalex.org/W3176735511,"The primary aim of this study is to propose a potential landscape value assessment from different dimensions rather than the traditional approach of a composite indicator. The method used in this study is the combination of data collection from stakeholder survey, score measurement for landscape value dimensions using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), and spatial representation with the support of Geographic Information System (GIS). From a large-scale (n = 400) investigation in the Moc Chau district, the statistical data extracted from the survey provides input data for the score determination process. SEM analysis shows that each landscape site has 11 determinants influencing the landscape value assessment. Using the RMSE comparison (for validation) with different interpolation methods, the ordinary kriging method is chosen to model the aggregation landscape value map of Moc Chau District. About 24.97% total area of the study area has great potential for tourism development, being mainly distributed in the center of a high mountainous area. This approach can be used as a model to advocate local and regional assessment and enhance value-based management in other territories in Vietnam and beyond."
https://openalex.org/W3173349749,"This work presents a practical proposal for estimating health system utilization for COVID-19 cases. The novel methodology developed is based on the dynamic model known as S usceptible, I nfected, R emoved and D ead (SIRD). The model was modified to focus on the healthcare system dynamics, rather than modeling all cases of the disease. It was tuned using data available for each Brazilian state and updated with daily figures. A figure of merit that assesses the quality of the model fit to the data was defined and used to optimize the free parameters. The parameters of an epidemiological model for the whole of Brazil, comprising a linear combination of the models for each state, were estimated considering the data available for the 26 Brazilian states. The model was validated, and strong adherence was demonstrated in most cases."
https://openalex.org/W3173491004,"Big data require new techniques to handle the information they come with. Here we consider four datasets (email communication, Twitter posts, Wikipedia articles and Gutenberg books) and propose a novel statistical framework to predict global statistics from random samples. More precisely, we infer the number of senders, hashtags and words of the whole dataset and how their abundances (i.e. the popularity of a hashtag) change through scales from a small sample of sent emails per sender, posts per hashtag and word occurrences. Our approach is grounded on statistical ecology as we map inference of human activities into the unseen species problem in biodiversity. Our findings may have applications to resource management in emails, collective attention monitoring in Twitter and language learning process in word databases."
https://openalex.org/W3175791035,"Although the visual and geomagnetic orientation cues used by sea turtle hatchlings during sea-finding have been well studied, the potential for auditory stimuli to act as an orientation cue has not been explored. We investigated the response of sea turtle hatchlings to natural and anthropogenic noises present on their nesting beaches during sea-finding. The responses of hatchling leatherback sea turtles, Dermochelys coriacea, collected from the Sandy Point National Wildlife Refuge, St. Croix, were measured in the presence of aerial acoustic sounds within hatchlings' hearing range of 50 to 1600 Hz. The highest sound energy produced by beach waves occurs at frequencies 50-1000 Hz, which overlaps with the most sensitive hearing range of hatchling leatherbacks (50-400 Hz). Natural beach wave sounds, which have highest sound energy at frequencies of 50-1000 Hz, may be masked by human conversations (85-650 Hz) and vehicle traffic noise (60-8000 Hz). In the presence of three stimuli, a) beach wave sounds (72.0 dB re: 20 μPa), b) human conversation (72.4 dB re: 20 μPa), and c) vehicle traffic noise (71.1 dB re: 20 μPa), hatchlings exhibited no phonotaxic response (wave sounds: mean angle = 152.1°, p = 0.645; human conversation: mean angle = 67.4°, p = 0.554; traffic noise: mean angle = 125.7°, p = 0.887). These results may be due to the hatchlings being unable to localize sounds in the experimental arena. Visual and auditory cues may also converge to affect sea-finding orientation. Future studies should focus on the localization ability of sea turtles and on the role that sound may play in orientation when combined with other sensory and environmental cues."
https://openalex.org/W3176654707,"Multicollinearity widely exists in empirical studies, which leads to imprecise estimation and even endogeneity when omitted variables are correlated with any regressors. We apply an innovative strategy, different from the usual tools (instrumental variable, ridge regression, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), to estimate the robust determinants of income distribution. We transform panel data into (quasi-) cross-sectional data by removing country and time effects from the data so that all variables become zero mean and orthogonal to the country dummies and time variable, and multicollinearity becomes very low or even disappears with the quasi-cross sectional data in any specifications regardless of country dummies and time variable being included or not. Our contribution is threefold. First, we build a general method to address the multicollinearity issue in panel data, which is to isolate the common contents of correlated variables and ensures robust estimates in different specifications (dynamic or static specifications) and estimators (within- or between-effects estimators). Second, we find no evidence for the Kuznets hypothesis within and across countries; investment is economically and statistically the most robust determinant of income inequality; meanwhile, labor income share shows robustly and consistently positive effects on income inequality, which challenges the related literature. Last, simulations with our estimates show that the total marginal effects of development (regarding GDP, capital stock and investment) on income inequality are very likely to be positive within and between countries except that the impacts on middle-60% and top-quintile income shares are not so likely to increase income inequality across countries."
https://openalex.org/W3177369155,"The biguanide, metformin, is the first-choice therapeutic agent for type-2 diabetes, although the mechanisms that underpin metformin clinical efficacy remain the subject of much debate, partly due to the considerable variation in patient response to metformin. Identification of poor responders by genotype could avoid unnecessary treatment and provide clues to the underlying mechanism of action. GWAS identified SNPs associated with metformin treatment success at a locus containing the NPAT (nuclear protein, ataxia-telangiectasia locus) and ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) genes. This implies that gene sequence dictates a subsequent biological function to influence metformin action. Hence, we modified expression of NPAT in immortalized cell lines, primary mouse hepatocytes and mouse tissues, and analysed the outcomes on metformin action using confocal microscopy, immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry. In addition, we characterised the metabolic phenotype of npat heterozygous knockout mice and established the metformin response following development of insulin resistance. NPAT protein was localised in the nucleus at discrete loci in several cell types, but over-expression or depletion of NPAT in immortalised cell models did not change cellular responses to biguanides. In contrast, metformin regulation of respiratory exchange ratio (RER) was completely lost in animals lacking one allele of npat. There was also a reduction in metformin correction of impaired glucose tolerance, however no other metabolic abnormalities, or response to metformin, were found in the npat heterozygous mice. In summary, we provide methodological advancements for the detection of NPAT, demonstrate that minor reductions in NPAT mRNA levels (20-40%) influence metformin regulation of RER, and propose that the association between NPAT SNPs and metformin response observed in GWAS, could be due to loss of metformin modification of cellular fuel usage."
