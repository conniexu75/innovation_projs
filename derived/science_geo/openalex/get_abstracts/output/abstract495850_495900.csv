https://openalex.org/W1991155948,"Background Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been life saving for hundreds of thousands of Ethiopians. With increased availability of ART in recent years, achievement of optimal adherence and patient retention are becoming the greatest challenges in the management of HIV/AIDS in Ethiopia. However, few studies have explored factors influencing medication adherence to ART and retention in follow-up care among adult Ethiopian HIV-positive patients, especially in the Amhara region of the country, where almost one-third of the country’s ART is prescribed. The aim of this qualitative study was to collect such data from patients and healthcare providers in the Amhara region of Ethiopia. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 24 patients, of whom 11 had been lost to follow-up and were non-persistent with ART. In addition, focus group discussions were performed with 15 ART nurses and 19 case managers. All interviews and focus groups were audio-recorded, transcribed, and coded for themes and patterns in Amharic using a grounded theory approach. The emergent concepts and categories were translated into English. Results Economic constraints, perceived stigma and discrimination, fasting, holy water, medication side effects, and dissatisfaction with healthcare services were major reasons for patients being non-adherent and lost to follow-up. Disclosure of HIV status, social support, use of reminder aids, responsibility for raising children, improved health on ART, and receiving education and counseling emerged as facilitators of adherence to ART. Conclusions Improving adherence and retention requires integration of enhanced treatment access with improved job and food security. Healthcare providers need to be supported to better equip patients to cope with the issues associated with ART. Development of social policies and cooperation between various agencies are required to facilitate optimal adherence to ART, patient retention, and improved patient outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W1990455314,"Background Despite the importance of body composition in athletes, reference sex- and sport-specific body composition data are lacking. We aim to develop reference values for body composition and anthropometric measurements in athletes. Methods Body weight and height were measured in 898 athletes (264 female, 634 male), anthropometric variables were assessed in 798 athletes (240 female and 558 male), and in 481 athletes (142 female and 339 male) with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). A total of 21 different sports were represented. Reference percentiles (5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th) were calculated for each measured value, stratified by sex and sport. Because sample sizes within a sport were often very low for some outcomes, the percentiles were estimated using a parametric, empirical Bayesian framework that allowed sharing information across sports. Results We derived sex- and sport-specific reference percentiles for the following DXA outcomes: total (whole body scan) and regional (subtotal, trunk, and appendicular) bone mineral content, bone mineral density, absolute and percentage fat mass, fat-free mass, and lean soft tissue. Additionally, we derived reference percentiles for height-normalized indexes by dividing fat mass, fat-free mass, and appendicular lean soft tissue by height squared. We also derived sex- and sport-specific reference percentiles for the following anthropometry outcomes: weight, height, body mass index, sum of skinfold thicknesses (7 skinfolds, appendicular skinfolds, trunk skinfolds, arm skinfolds, and leg skinfolds), circumferences (hip, arm, midthigh, calf, and abdominal circumferences), and muscle circumferences (arm, thigh, and calf muscle circumferences). Conclusions These reference percentiles will be a helpful tool for sports professionals, in both clinical and field settings, for body composition assessment in athletes."
https://openalex.org/W2037184357,"Our previous studies have shown that microRNA-320 (miR-320) is one of the most down-regulated microRNAs (miRNA) in mouse ovarian granulosa cells (GCs) after TGF-β1 treatment. However, the underlying mechanisms of miR-320 involved in GC function during follicular development remain unknown. In this study, we found that pregnant mare serum gonadotropin treatment resulted in the suppression of miR-320 expression in a time-dependent manner. miR-320 was mainly expressed in GCs and oocytes of mouse ovarian follicles in follicular development. Overexpression of miR-320 inhibited estradiol synthesis and proliferation of GCs through targeting E2F1 and SF-1. E2F1/SF-1 mediated miR-320-induced suppression of GC proliferation and of GC steroidogenesis. FSH down-regulated the expression of miR-320 and regulated the function of miR-320 in mouse GCs. miR-383 promoted the expression of miR-320 and enhanced miR-320-mediated suppression of GC proliferation. Injection of miR-320 into the ovaries of mice partially promoted the production of testosterone and progesterone but inhibited estradiol release in vivo. Moreover, the expression of miR-320 and miR-383 was up-regulated in the follicular fluid of polycystic ovarian syndrome patients, although the expression of E2F1 and SF-1 was down-regulated in GCs. These data demonstrated that miR-320 regulates the proliferation and steroid production by targeting E2F1 and SF-1 in the follicular development. Understanding the regulation of miRNA biogenesis and function in the follicular development will potentiate the usefulness of miRNA in the treatment of reproduction and some steroid-related disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1967808562,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is transmitted via inhalation of aerosolized particles. While alveolar macrophages are thought to play a central role in the acquisition and control of this infection, Mtb also has ample opportunity to interact with the airway epithelium. In this regard, we have recently shown that the upper airways are enriched with a population of non-classical, MR1-restricted, Mtb-reactive CD8+ T cells (MAIT cells). Additionally, we have demonstrated that Mtb-infected epithelial cells lining the upper airways are capable of stimulating IFNγ production by MAIT cells. In this study, we demonstrate that airway epithelial cells efficiently stimulate IFNγ release by MAIT cells as well as HLA-B45 and HLA-E restricted T cell clones. Characterization of the intracellular localization of Mtb in epithelial cells indicates that the vacuole occupied by Mtb in epithelial cells is distinct from DC in that it acquires Rab7 molecules and does not retain markers of early endosomes such as Rab5. The Mtb vacuole is also heterogeneous as there is a varying degree of association with Lamp1 and HLA-I. Although the Mtb vacuole shares markers associated with the late endosome, it does not acidify, and the bacteria are able to replicate within the cell. This work demonstrates that Mtb infected lung epithelial cells are surprisingly efficient at stimulating IFNγ release by CD8+ T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2078955977,"Ergothioneine is a small, sulfur-containing metabolite (229 Da) synthesized by various species of bacteria and fungi, which can accumulate to millimolar levels in tissues or cells (e.g. erythrocytes) of higher eukaryotes. It is commonly marketed as a dietary supplement due to its proposed protective and antioxidative functions. In this study we report the genes forming the two-step ergothioneine biosynthetic pathway in the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We identified the first gene, egt1+ (SPBC1604.01), by sequence homology to previously published genes from Neurospora crassa and Mycobacterium smegmatis. We showed, using metabolomic analysis, that the Δegt1 deletion mutant completely lacked ergothioneine and its precursors (trimethyl histidine/hercynine and hercynylcysteine sulfoxide). Since the second step of ergothioneine biosynthesis has not been characterized in eukaryotes, we examined four putative homologs (Nfs1/SPBC21D10.11c, SPAC11D3.10, SPCC777.03c, and SPBC660.12c) of the corresponding mycobacterial enzyme EgtE. Among deletion mutants of these genes, only one (ΔSPBC660.12c, designated Δegt2) showed a substantial decrease in ergothioneine, accompanied by accumulation of its immediate precursor, hercynylcysteine sulfoxide. Ergothioneine-deficient strains exhibited no phenotypic defects during vegetative growth or quiescence. To effectively study the role of ergothioneine, we constructed an egt1+ overexpression system by replacing its native promoter with the nmt1+ promoter, which is inducible in the absence of thiamine. We employed three versions of the nmt1 promoter with increasing strength of expression and confirmed corresponding accumulations of ergothioneine. We quantified the intracellular concentration of ergothioneine in S. pombe (0.3, 157.4, 41.6, and up to 1606.3 µM in vegetative, nitrogen-starved, glucose-starved, and egt1+-overexpressing cells, respectively) and described its gradual accumulation under long-term quiescence. Finally, we demonstrated that the ergothioneine pathway can also synthesize selenoneine, a selenium-containing derivative of ergothioneine, when the culture medium is supplemented with selenium. We further found that selenoneine biosynthesis involves a novel intermediate compound, hercynylselenocysteine."
https://openalex.org/W1975188427,"Background There is absence of specific biomarkers and an incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Methods and Findings Eighty-eight vitreous samples (73 from patients with treatment naïve AMD and 15 control samples from patients with idiopathic floaters) were analyzed with capillary electrophoresis coupled to mass spectrometry in this retrospective case series to define potential candidate protein markers of AMD. Nineteen proteins were found to be upregulated in vitreous of AMD patients. Most of the proteins were plasma derived and involved in biological (ion) transport, acute phase inflammatory reaction, and blood coagulation. A number of proteins have not been previously associated to AMD including alpha-1-antitrypsin, fibrinogen alpha chain and prostaglandin H2-D isomerase. Alpha-1-antitrypsin was validated in vitreous of an independent set of AMD patients using Western blot analysis. Further systems biology analysis of the data indicated that the observed proteomic changes may reflect upregulation of immune response and complement activity. Conclusions Proteome analysis of vitreous samples from patients with AMD, which underwent an intravitreal combination therapy including a core vitrectomy, steroids and bevacizumab, revealed apparent AMD-specific proteomic changes. The identified AMD-associated proteins provide some insight into the pathophysiological changes associated with AMD."
https://openalex.org/W1964214627,"Threatened preterm labor (TPTL) is defined as persistent premature uterine contractions between 20 and 37 weeks of gestation and is the most common condition that requires hospitalization during pregnancy. Most of these TPTL women continue their pregnancies to term while only an estimated 5% will deliver a premature baby within ten days. The aim of this work was to study differential whole blood gene expression associated with spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) within 48 hours of hospital admission. Peripheral blood was collected at point of hospital admission from 154 women with TPTL before any medical treatment. Microarrays were utilized to investigate differential whole blood gene expression between TPTL women who did (n = 48) or did not have a sPTB (n = 106) within 48 hours of admission. Total leukocyte and neutrophil counts were significantly higher (35% and 41% respectively) in women who had sPTB than women who did not deliver within 48 hours (p<0.001). Fetal fibronectin (fFN) test was performed on 62 women. There was no difference in the urine, vaginal and placental microbiology and histopathology reports between the two groups of women. There were 469 significant differentially expressed genes (FDR<0.05); 28 differentially expressed genes were chosen for microarray validation using qRT-PCR and 20 out of 28 genes were successfully validated (p<0.05). An optimal random forest classifier model to predict sPTB was achieved using the top nine differentially expressed genes coupled with peripheral clinical blood data (sensitivity 70.8%, specificity 75.5%). These differentially expressed genes may further elucidate the underlying mechanisms of sPTB and pave the way for future systems biology studies to predict sPTB."
https://openalex.org/W2059772741,"Thymosin β4 (Tβ4), a G-actin-sequestering peptide, improves neurological outcome in rat models of neurological injury. Tissue inflammation results from neurological injury, and regulation of the inflammatory response is vital for neurological recovery. The innate immune response system, which includes the Toll-like receptor (TLR) proinflammatory signaling pathway, regulates tissue injury. We hypothesized that Tβ4 regulates the TLR proinflammatory signaling pathway. Because oligodendrogenesis plays an important role in neurological recovery, we employed an in vitro primary rat embryonic cell model of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and a mouse N20.1 OPC cell line to measure the effects of Tβ4 on the TLR pathway. Cells were grown in the presence of Tβ4, ranging from 25 to 100 ng/ml (RegeneRx Biopharmaceuticals Inc., Rockville, MD), for 4 days. Quantitative real-time PCR data demonstrated that Tβ4 treatment increased expression of microRNA-146a (miR-146a), a negative regulator the TLR signaling pathway, in these two cell models. Western blot analysis showed that Tβ4 treatment suppressed expression of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), two proinflammatory cytokines of the TLR signaling pathway. Transfection of miR-146a into both primary rat embryonic OPCs and mouse N20.1 OPCs treated with Tβ4 demonstrated an amplification of myelin basic protein (MBP) expression and differentiation of OPC into mature MBP-expressing oligodendrocytes. Transfection of anti-miR-146a nucleotides reversed the inhibitory effect of Tβ4 on IRAK1 and TRAF6 and decreased expression of MBP. These data suggest that Tβ4 suppresses the TLR proinflammatory pathway by up-regulating miR-146a.

Thymosin β4 (Tβ4) 2The abbreviations used are: Tβ4thymosin β4OPColigoprogenitor cellOLoligodendrocyteTLRToll-like receptorMBPmyelin basic proteinqrtPCRquantitative real-time PCR. is a 5-kDa, 43-amino acid peptide originally isolated from the thymus gland (1Goldstein A.L.

U.S.A. 1966; 56: 1010-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Tβ4 regulates the cellular actin-cytoskeleton and cellular migration by sequestering G-actin (2Huff T. Müller C.S. Otto A.M.

Most mammalian cells express Tβ4, and its observed actions in dermal wound and cardiac ischemia models are anti-inflammatory and proangiogenic (4Goldstein A.L. Hannappel E. Kleinman H.K.

In addition, Tβ4 promotes cardiomyocyte and keratinocyte migration in these models. Tβ4 improves functional outcome after experimental induction of multiple sclerosis, embolic stroke, and traumatic brain injury (5Morris D.C. Chopp M. Zhang L. Lu M. Zhang Z.G.

In all three models, improvement in neurological outcome is associated with oligodendrogenesis (i.e. differentiation of oligoprogenitor cells (OPCs) into mature myelin-secreting oligodendrocytes (OLs)). Oligodendrogenesis contributes to remyelination after neurological injury by differentiation of OPCs into mature myelin-expressing OLs. thymosin β4 oligoprogenitor cell oligodendrocyte Toll-like receptor myelin basic protein quantitative real-time PCR. Neurorestorative agents act on intact parenchymal cells to promote neurogenesis, angiogenesis, oligodendrogenesis, and axonal remodeling during the recovery phase of neurological injury and thereby enhance neurological recovery (8Zhang Z.G. Chopp M. Neurorestorative therapies for stroke: underlying mechanisms and translation to the clinic.Lancet Neurol. 2009; 8: 491-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Therefore, Tβ4 is a candidate neurorestorative agent when administered in animal models of multiple sclerosis, stroke, and traumatic brain injury (9Morris D.C. Chopp M. Zhang L. Zhang Z.G.

However, its mechanisms of action are unclear and require investigation. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are pattern recognition receptors that recognize conserved molecular patterns of pathogens. In addition to pathogens, TLRs also recognize damage-associated molecular patterns, which are molecular patterns of endogenous host debris released during cellular injury or death (10Beutler B. Innate immunity: an overview.Mol. Immunol. 2004; 40: 845-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 11Hanke M.L. Kielian T. Toll-like receptors in health and disease in the brain: mechanisms and therapeutic potential.Clin. Sci. 2011; 121: 367-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). This debris can be extracellular matrix protein, oxidized proteins, RNA, or DNA. Once recognition occurs, the TLRs are stimulated, resulting in activation of many signaling pathways, including those pathways involving the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and the nuclear factor NF-κB transcription factors. The MAPKs activate OL differentiation; therefore, TLR signaling may be involved in oligodendrogenesis as well as in regulating the inflammatory response (12Symons A. Beinke S. Ley S.C. MAP kinase kinase kinases and innate immunity.Trends Immunol. 2006; 27: 40-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 13Taganov K.D. Boldin M.P. Chang K.J. Baltimore D.

U.S.A. 2006; 103: 12481-12486Crossref PubMed Scopus (3507) Google Scholar). In addition, the TLR pathways are affected by miR-146, which down-regulates proinflammatory cytokine production and activation of inflammatory pathways (14Butcher J. Abdou H. Morin K. Liu Y.

TLR4, is a well studied TLR that mediates its proinflammatory response through three proteins, IRAK1 (IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1), IRAK4, and TRAF6 (tumor necrosis receptor associated factor 6) (18Nahid M.A. Satoh M. Chan E.K. MicroRNA in TLR signaling and endotoxin tolerance.Cell Mol. Immunol. 2011; 8: 388-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). By targeting IRAK1 and TRAF6, miR-146 inhibits NF-κB activation. We therefore hypothesized that Tβ4 regulates the TLR proinflammatory signaling pathway by specifically regulating miR-146a to promote differentiation of OPCs to mature myelin basic protein (MBP)-expressing OLs. All animal experiments were performed according to protocols approved by the Henry Ford Hospital Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Primary rat embryonic OPCs were isolated and prepared according to the method of Chen et al. (19Chen Y. Balasubramaniyan V. Peng J. Hurlock E.C. Tallquist M. Li J. Lu Q.R. Isolation and culture of rat and mouse oligodendrocyte precursor cells.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Briefly, on embryonic day 17, the rat embryos were removed from a pregnant Wistar rat in a laminar flow hood. The cortices were dissected out by using microdissecting scissors, rinsed twice in Hanks' buffered salt solution, and dissociated after digesting with 0.01% trypsin and DNase at 37 °C for 15 min. The digested cells were washed twice, filtered through a 70-mm nylon cell strainer, and plated with DMEM containing 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in poly-d-lysine-coated T75 cell culture flasks (∼10 million cells/flask). The cells grew to confluence for 10 days and then were placed on the shaker at 200 rpm at 37 °C for 1 h to remove microglial cells. Subsequently, the cells were left on the shaker for an additional 18–20 h to collect OPCs. The collected OPCs were plated in untreated Petri dishes for 1 h to remove contaminated microglia and astrocytes, which attach to the Petri dish more efficiently than OPCs. The unattached OPCs were transferred onto poly-dl-ornithine-coated Petri dishes at a cell density of 104/cm2 with a basal chemically defined medium containing 10 ng/ml platelet-derived growth factor-α and 10 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor for 7–10 days. The mouse primary cultures of OPCs were conditionally immortalized by transformation with a temperature-sensitive large T-antigen into a mouse OPC cell line, N20.1 (20Paez P.M. García C.I. Davio C. Campagnoni A.T. Soto E.F. Pasquini J.M. Apotransferrin promotes the differentiation of two oligodendroglial cell lines.Glia. 2004; 46: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). N20.1 cells were provided by Dr. Anthony Campagnoni (UCLA). N20.1 cells were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/F-12 with 1% FBS and G418 (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C. For N20.1 cells, transient transfections were performed with the Nucleofector kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amaxa, Germany). The cells (106) were mixed with 1 μg of plasmid DNA or 100 pmol of siRNA/oligonucleotides and pulsed according to the manufacturer's instruction. The transfected cells were immediately plated into Petri dishes with DMEM containing 1% FBS and incubated at 37 °C for 2 days. Primary rat embryonic OPCs were transiently transfected with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) overnight, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Amounts of DNA and siRNA/oligonucleotides were used as recommended by manufacturer. The control plasmid (pcDNA3) was used as a mock-transfected control for miR-146a expression vector transfection, and control siRNA (Ambion; a random mixture of oligonucleotides) was used as a mock-transfected control for transfections with Tβ4 siRNA, Krox-20/EGR2 siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, TX), and anti-miR-146a inhibitor nucleotides (21Izadi H.

To investigate the effect of Tβ4 on oligodendrocyte differentiation, primary rat embryonic OPCs and mouse N20.1 cells (104 cells/cm2) were incubated at 37 °C with media containing 0, 25, 50, or 100 ng/ml Tβ4 (RegeneRx Biopharmaceuticals Inc., Rockville, MD) without any growth or differentiation factors. Cells were fed every 2 days for 4 days. Basal defined medium without FBS for primary rat embryonic OPCs and DMEM containing 1% FBS for N20.1 cells were employed. After the treatment with Tβ4, we examined the oligodendrocyte differentiation by measuring the expression of its marker, MBP, with Western blot and quantitative real-time (qrtPCR), as described below. The samples that showed the elevation of MBP expression after Tβ4 treatment as a positive response to oligodendrocyte differentiation were utilized for all experiments involved in oligodendrocyte differentiation. For the treatment with kinase inhibitors, the cells were pretreated with p38 MAPK-specific inhibitor (SB 203580) and JNK-specific inhibitor II (SP600125) (Calbiochem) at the dose of 1 μm for 20–30 min before the addition of Tβ4 into the medium. To test for LPS contamination in Tβ4, the cells were cultured in the presence of LPS inhibitor polymyxin B (50 μg/ml), followed by treatment with Tβ4. Tβ4 (100 ng/ml) was boiled for 10 min in order to denature Tβ4 protein and used as a negative control. Transfected cells (2 × 104 cells/cm2), including mock-transfected controls, were treated with and without 100 ng/ml Tβ4 (RegeneRx Biopharmaceuticals Inc.) for 4 days, and fresh medium was provided at day 2 with/without Tβ4. The extraction of total RNA and preparation of cDNA were performed as described previously (22Santra M. Santra S. Buller B. Santra K. Nallani A. Chopp M. Effect of doublecortin on self-renewal and differentiation in brain tumor stem cells.Cancer Sci. 2011; 102: 1350-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The qrtPCR amplification was done for 40 cycles in the following thermal cycle using SYBR Green (Invitrogen): 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s. The sequences for each primer were used, as reported previously (23Santra M. Chopp M. Zhang Z.G. Lu M. Santra S. Nalani A. Santra S. Morris D.C.

After qrtPCR, agarose gel electrophoresis was performed to verify the quality of the qrtPCR products. There were no secondary products in our data. Each sample was tested in triplicate, and all values were normalized to GAPDH. Values obtained from three independent experiments were analyzed relative to gene expression data using the 2−ΔΔCT method (24Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Analysis of relative gene expression data using real-time quantitative PCR and the 2−ΔΔC(T) method.Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (123070) Google Scholar). The cDNA for each microRNA and TaqMan assay were performed in triplicate according to the manufacturer's protocol specified in the Applied Biosystems ViiATM 7 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Briefly, total RNA was isolated with TRIzol (Qiagen). The reverse transcription reaction mixture contained 1–10 ng of total RNA, 5 units of MultiScribe reverse transcriptase, 0.5 mm each dNTP, 1× reverse transcription buffer, 4 units of RNase inhibitor, and nuclease-free water. The microRNA cDNA was performed by individual reverse transcription in the following thermal cycle: 16 °C for 30 min, 42 °C for 30 min, 85 °C for 5 min. The TaqMan assay was performed in 20-μl TaqMan real-time PCRs containing 1× TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix No AmpErase UNG, 1× TaqMan microRNA assay buffer, 1.33 μl of undiluted cDNA, and nuclease-free water. All values were normalized to a U6 snRNA TaqMan microRNA control assay (Applied Biosystems) as the endogenous control. Values obtained from three independent experiments were analyzed relative to gene expression data using the 2−ΔΔCT method (24Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D.

For Western blot analysis, rabbit antiserum for MBP (1:200; Dako, Carpinteria, CA); monoclonal antibodies (1:1000) for p38 MAPK, phosphorylated p38 MAPK, c-Jun, and phosphorylated c-Jun (1:1000; Upstate, Charlottesville, VA); rabbit polyclonal antibodies (1:1000) for JNK1 and phosphorylated JNK1 (Promega Corp., Madison, WI); goat polyclonal antibodies for TLR2, rabbit polyclonal antibodies for TLR4, TRAF6, IκBα (1:1000), and Krox-20/EGR2 (1:500), and mouse monoclonal antibodies for IRAK1 (1:1000) and β-actin (1:5000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas,TX); and mouse monoclonal α-tubulin antibodies (1:5000; Sigma) were used. Donkey anti-goat, anti-rabbit, and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (1:5000; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) were used as secondary antibodies. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. The protein bands were quantified based on histogram analysis relative to gel loading marker α-tubulin in at least three independent experiments. Immunofluorescence staining was performed in N20.1 and primary rat embryonic OPC cells. These cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h, washed with PBS, blocked with 1% serum for 1 h, incubated with monoclonal antibodies of OPC marker, O4 (1:1000, Chemicon, Billerica, MA), and a polyclonal antibody against mature OL marker MBP (1:200; Dako, Carpinteria, CA) at room temperature for 1 h, and rinsed with PBS. Secondary antibodies were labeled with cyanine fluorophore (Cy3, red fluorescence) for 1 h. The slides were counterstained with DAPI (blue fluorescence) and examined under a fluorescent illumination microscope (Olympus IX71/IX51, Tokyo, Japan). O4- and MBP-positive cells were quantified by counting in at least three slides per experiment for at least three independent experiments. DAPI-positive cells were considered as the total number of cells. Data were summarized using mean and S.D. values. To compare the differences between cell cultures with Tβ4 treatment and without, a one-sample t test or a two-sample t test was used. For the comparisons of qrtPCR of mRNA/GAPDH and qrtPCR of miR-146a/U6, controls were normalized to 1, so that a one-sample t test was used for analysis. To compare the percentage of positive stained cells of the total number of cells between Tβ4 treatment and control, a two-sample t test was used. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. We investigated the effect of Tβ4 treatment on the expression of miR-146a and miR-146b in primary rat embryonic OPCs (n = 5) and in a mouse OPC cell line, N20.1 (n = 5), by qrtPCR. The purity of rat primary OPCs used in the experiments was confirmed by immunostaining for O4 and was quantified by cell counting. The cell counting data showed that >90% of these cells were O4-positive (Fig. 1). We found that Tβ4 treatment induced the expression of miR-146a in rat primary embryonic OPCs and mouse N20.1 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). In contrast, Tβ4 treatment had no effect on miR-146b expression in rat primary embryonic OPCs and mouse N20.1 cells (Fig. 2B). Transfection with miR-146a plasmid enhanced miR-146a expression ∼30- to ∼50-fold but had no effect on miR-146b expression in rat primary embryonic OPCs and mouse N20.1 cells (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2MicroRNA analysis of miR-146a and miR-146b in OPCs after Tβ4 treatment by qrtPCR. The total RNA samples were extracted from primary rat embryonic OPCs (left) and mouse OPC cell line N20.1 (right) after treatment with Tβ4 at doses ranging from 0 to 100 ng/ml (shown at the bottom) and after transfection with miR-146a for microRNA analysis of miR-146a (A) and miR-146b (B) by qrtPCR. Note that expression of miR-146a was increased in a dose-dependent manner in both OPCs. In contrast, expression of miR-146b remained unchanged. p < 0.05 was considered as significant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) miR-146a targets two proinflammatory cytokines, IRAK1 and TRAF6, in the intracellular TLR signaling pathway (25Hou J.

We investigated the effect of Tβ4 treatment on the TLR signaling pathway in rat primary embryonic OPCs and mouse N20.1 cells. These cell cultures, which demonstrated induction of miR-146a expression after Tβ4 treatment (Fig. 2), were utilized to analyze the expression levels of IRAK1, TRAF6, and MBP, the mature OL marker, by Western blot. Tβ4 treatment markedly reduced the expression levels of IRAK1 and TRAF6 and increased the expression level of MBP in a dose-dependent manner in rat primary embryonic OPCs (n = 3) and mouse N20.1 OPCs (n = 3) (Fig. 3). These data indicate that the TLR signaling pathway may be involved in Tβ4-mediated OPC differentiation in primary rat embryonic OPCs and mouse N20.1 cells. We investigated the effect of Tβ4 on MAPKs involved in downstream signaling of the TLR pathway. Expression of TLR2 and TLR4 was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3). However, treatment with Tβ4 had no effect on expression of TLR2 and TLR4 (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4). Western blot was performed to measure expression and phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, ERK1, JNK1, and c-Jun after Tβ4 treatment (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4). Tβ4 treatment induced expression and phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, a known regulator of oligodendrocyte differentiation, in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, Tβ4 dose-dependently inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK1, and c-Jun in primary rat embryonic OPCs and mouse N20.1 cells (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4). During Schwann cell myelination, a similar opposing effect of MAPKs, p38 MAPK, ERK1, and JNK1, has been reported for the expression of a key transcription factor of the MBP promoter, Krox-20, which is also known as EGR2 (early growth response-2) transcription factor (23Santra M. Chopp M. Zhang Z.G. Lu M. Santra S. Nalani A. Santra S. Morris D.C.

To determine whether Tβ4 treatment affected Krox-20 expression in OPCs, we reprobed the Western blots with Krox-20/EGR2 antibodies in OPCs after Tβ4 treatment. These data showed that Tβ4 induced Krox-20 expression in OPCs (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4). To avoid confounding data because of any LPS contamination in Tβ4, the cells were cultured in the presence of polymyxin B (50 μg/ml), followed by Tβ4 treatment at a dose of 50 and 100 ng/ml for 4 days. The qrtPCR data indicate that Tβ4 treatment induced the expression of MBP in a dose-dependent manner even in the presence of polymyxin B (50 μg/ml) in rat OPC and N20.1 cells in both mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 5, A–C). In contrast, the boiled denatured Tβ4 (100 ng/ml) treatment had no effect on MBP expression (Fig. 5, A–C). These data suggested that induction of MBP was solely dependent on natural Tβ4 and independent of LPS contamination. We measured protein expression of IRAK1, TRAF6, and MAPKs in miR-146a-overexpressing and miR-146a knock-out primary rat embryonic OPCs (n = 3) and mouse N20.1 cells (n = 3) (Fig. 6). Overexpression and knock-out of miR-146a were determined by quantitative analysis of miR-146a. The efficacy of transfection was an increase of miR-146a of 51 ± 5.3-fold in N20.1 cells and 33.5 ± 4.1-fold in rat OPCs for miR-146a overexpression and a decrease of 73.1 ± 8.3-fold in N20.1 cells and 46.7 ± 5.2-fold in rat OPCs for miR-146a knock-out. Western blot analysis revealed that the miR-146a transfection inhibited expression of IRAK1 and TRAF6 and increased expression and activation of p38 MAPK. In contrast, transfection with anti-miR-146a inhibitor nucleotides significantly inhibited the expression of MBP and phosphorylation of p38 MAPK (Fig. 6). Expression of IRAK1, TRAF6, phospho-ERK1, phospho-JNK, and phospho-c-Jun remained unchanged or slightly elevated. These data indicate that miR-146a may be directly involved in OL differentiation by activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway in rat primary embryonic OPCs and mouse N20.1 cells. To determine whether miR-146a transfection regulates Krox-20 expression in OPCs, we performed Western blot analysis in rat primary embryonic OPCs and mouse N20.1 cells. These data demonstrate that miR-146a transfection markedly up-regulated Krox-20 expression. (Fig. 6). To investigate the mechanistic link between Tβ4 and miR-146a upon MBP expression, we further investigated the effect of both Tβ4 and miR-146a on the TLR signaling pathways using primary rat embryonic OPCs (n = 3) and the mouse OPC cell line N20.1 (n = 3). Fig. 7 demonstrates a 2-fold increase in mRNA MBP expression in the miR-146a transfection and Tβ4 group in rat primary embryonic OPCs and mouse N20.1 cells. However, a 10-fold increase in mRNA MBP expression is observed when miR-146a-transfected cells are grown in the presence of Tβ4, suggesting that Tβ4 amplifies miR-146a-induced MBP expression. A similar but less robust result is observed when measuring p38 MAPK. Western blot demonstrated similar results at the protein level, as shown in Fig. 8 (primary rat OPCs) and Fig. 9 (mouse N20.1 cells). Furthermore, knock-out of miR-146a or silencing Tβ4 using Tβ4 siRNA (transfection efficiency of Tβ4 siRNA was 58.3 ± 6.2-fold in rat OPCs and 75.1 ± 7.9-fold in N20.1 cells) inhibited MBP expression with no effect on the proinflammatory expression of IRAK1 and TRAF6 or the MAPKs, phospho-ERK1, phospho-JNK1, phospho-c-Jun, and Krox-20 when compared with control (FIGURE 8, FIGURE 9). Interestingly, silencing Tβ4 using Tβ4 siRNA in miR-146a-overexpressing cells showed inhibition of IRAK1 and TRAF6 without an increase of MBP expression, suggesting that Tβ4 may be necessary for MBP expression. In contrast, using knock-out miR-146a cells treated with Tβ4 showed no change in the expression of MBP, IRAK1, TRAF6, p38 MAPK phospho-ERK1, phospho-JNK1, phospho-c-Jun, and Krox-20. These data indicate that miR-146a is a necessary component for Tβ4-mediated MBP expression. Relative protein expression is quantified and shown in Fig. 10. Collectively, these results suggest that Tβ4 promotes the expression of MBP and Krox-20 through up-regulation of miR-146a.FIGURE 8Effect of Tβ4 treatment and transfection with miR-146a, anti-miR-146a, and Tβ4 siRNA on MBP expression and downstream signaling mediators of TLR in the primary rat embryonic OPCs.

https://openalex.org/W2098230066,"Corin is a membrane-bound serine protease that acts as the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) convertase in the heart. Recent studies show that corin also activates ANP in the pregnant uterus to promote spiral artery remodeling and prevent pregnancy-induced hypertension. Two CORIN gene mutations, K317E and S472G, were identified in preeclamptic patients and shown to have reduced activity in vitro. In this study, we carried out molecular modeling and biochemical experiments to understand how these mutations impair corin function. By molecular modeling, the mutation K317E was predicted to alter corin LDL receptor-2 module conformation. Western blot analysis of K317E mutant in HEK293 cells showed that the mutation did not block corin expression on the cell surface but inhibited corin zymogen activation. In contrast, the mutation S472G was predicted to abolish a β-sheet critical for corin frizzled-2 module structure. In Western blot analysis and flow cytometry, S472G mutant was not detected on the cell surface in transfected HEK293 cells. By immunostaining, the S472G mutant was found in the ER, indicating that the mutation S472G disrupted the β-sheet, causing corin misfolding and ER retention. Thus, these results show that mutations in the CORIN gene may impair corin function by entirely different mechanisms.

https://openalex.org/W1990975890,"The precise regulation of numbers and types of neurons through control of cell cycle exit and terminal differentiation is an essential aspect of neurogenesis. The Hippo signaling pathway has recently been identified as playing a crucial role in promoting cell cycle exit and terminal differentiation in multiple types of stem cells, including in retinal progenitor cells. When Hippo signaling is activated, the core Mst1/2 kinases activate the Lats1/2 kinases, which in turn phosphorylate and inhibit the transcriptional cofactor Yap. During mouse retinogenesis, overexpression of Yap prolongs progenitor cell proliferation, whereas inhibition of Yap decreases this proliferation and promotes retinal cell differentiation. However, to date, it remains unknown how the Hippo pathway affects the differentiation of distinct neuronal cell types such as photoreceptor cells. In this study, we investigated whether Hippo signaling regulates retinogenesis during early zebrafish development. Knockdown of zebrafish mst2 induced early embryonic defects, including altered retinal pigmentation and morphogenesis. Similar abnormal retinal phenotypes were observed in zebrafish embryos injected with a constitutively active form of yap [(yap (5SA)]. Loss of Yap’s TEAD-binding domain, two WW domains, or transcription activation domain attenuated the retinal abnormalities induced by yap (5SA), indicating that all of these domains contribute to normal retinal development. Remarkably, yap (5SA)-expressing zebrafish embryos displayed decreased expression of transcription factors such as otx5 and crx, which orchestrate photoreceptor cell differentiation by activating the expression of rhodopsin and other photoreceptor cell genes. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that Rx1 is a novel interacting partner of Yap that regulates photoreceptor cell differentiation. Our results suggest that Yap suppresses the differentiation of photoreceptor cells from retinal progenitor cells by repressing Rx1-mediated transactivation of photoreceptor cell genes during zebrafish retinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2062717944,"While it is accepted that viruses can enter epithelial cells by endocytosis, the lack of an established biological mechanism for the trafficking of infectious virions through vaginal epithelial cells and their release from the plasma membrane has contributed to ongoing controversy about whether endocytosis is a mere artifact of some cell culture systems and whether squamous vaginal epithelial cells are even relevant as it pertains to HIV-1 transmission.In this study, we investigated the intracellular trafficking pathway that HIV-1 exploits to transcytose vaginal epithelial cells. The reduction of endosome tubulation by recycling endosome inhibitors blocked transcytosis of HIV-1 in a cell culture and transwell system. In addition, we demonstrate that although heat-inactivated virus was endocytosed as efficiently as native virus, heat-inactivated virus was trafficked exclusively to the lysosomal pathway for degradation following endocytosis. Lysosomal protease-specific inhibitors blocked the degradation of inactivated virions. Immunofluorescence analysis not only demonstrated that HIV-1 was inside the cells but the different colocalization pattern of native vs. heat inactivated virus with transferrin provided conclusive evidence that HIV-1 uses the recycling pathway to get across vaginal epithelial cells.Altogether, our findings demonstrate the precise intracellular trafficking pathway utilized by HIV-1 in epithelial cells, confirms that HIV-1 transcytosis through vaginal epithelial cells is a biological phenomenon and brings to light the differential intracellular trafficking of native vs heat-inactivated HIV-1 which with further exploration could prove to provide valuable insights that could be used in the prevention of transcytosis/transmission of HIV-1 across the mucosal epithelia."

This study evaluates the impact of residency and urbanicity on Hib vaccine and PCV coverage for children aged 2 to 7 years living in Shanghai, China, in August 2012.In this exploratory cohort study, a sample of children aged 2 to 7 years, all of whom were eligible to have received the complete series of Hib vaccine and PCV, was obtained from the Shanghai Immunization Program Information System. Three measures of vaccination coverage for Hib vaccine and PCV were examined: dose 1 coverage, series completion, and timeliness of dose 1 vaccination. Multivariable binomial regression was used to estimate the difference in vaccination coverage between locals and the floating population.Dose 1 coverage was 50.9% for Hib vaccine and 11.4% for PCV for the 28,141 abstracted pediatric records. For both vaccines, dose 1 coverage was higher in locals than in the floating population. The disparity in coverage between locals and the floating population was greater in suburban areas than urban areas. Of all children who received dose 1, 79.7% completed the Hib vaccine series, and 91.3% completed the PCV series. Timely dose 1 coverage was 8.2% for Hib vaccine and 0.5% for PCV.Low vaccination coverage and extremely low levels of timely dose 1 vaccination indicate that current vaccination efforts are inadequate to reduce the burden of Hib and pneumococcal disease among Chinese children, especially infants. Government funding of the Hib vaccine and PCV through the Expanded Program on Immunization would increase uptake and could also ensure that improvement in the timeliness of administration and series completion is targeted for all demographic groups."
https://openalex.org/W2016704690,"Asymmetry in the alignment of the lower limbs during weight-bearing activities is associated with patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS), caused by an increase in patellofemoral (PF) joint stress. High neuromuscular demands are placed on the lower limb during the propulsion phase of the single leg triple hop test (SLTHT), which may influence biomechanical behavior. The aim of the present cross-sectional study was to compare kinematic, kinetic and muscle activity in the trunk and lower limb during propulsion in the SLTHT using women with PFPS and pain free controls. The following measurements were made using 20 women with PFPS and 20 controls during propulsion in the SLTHT: kinematics of the trunk, pelvis, hip, and knee; kinetics of the hip, knee and ankle; and muscle activation of the gluteus maximus (GM), gluteus medius (GMed), biceps femoris (BF) and vastus lateralis (VL). Differences between groups were calculated using three separate sets of multivariate analysis of variance for kinematics, kinetics, and electromyographic data. Women with PFPS exhibited ipsilateral trunk lean; greater trunk flexion; greater contralateral pelvic drop; greater hip adduction and internal rotation; greater ankle pronation; greater internal hip abductor and ankle supinator moments; lower internal hip, knee and ankle extensor moments; and greater GM, GMed, BL, and VL muscle activity. The results of the present study are related to abnormal movement patterns in women with PFPS. We speculated that these findings constitute strategies to control a deficient dynamic alignment of the trunk and lower limb and to avoid PF pain. However, the greater BF and VL activity and the extensor pattern found for the hip, knee, and ankle of women with PFPS may contribute to increased PF stress."
https://openalex.org/W2030079026,"Regulation of spatiotemporal gene expression in higher eukaryotic cells is critical for the precise and orderly development of undifferentiated progenitors into committed cell types of the adult. It is well known that dynamic epigenomic regulation (including chromatin remodeling and histone modifications by transcriptional coregulator complexes) is involved in transcriptional regulation. Precisely how these coregulator complexes exert their cell type and developing stage-specific activity is largely unknown. In this study we aimed to isolate the histone demethylase lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) complex from neural cells by biochemical purification. In so doing, we identified myelin transcription factor 1 (MyT1) as a novel LSD1 complex component. MyT1 is a neural cell-specific zinc finger factor, and it forms a stable multiprotein complex with LSD1 through direct interaction. Target gene analysis using microarray and ChIP assays revealed that the Pten gene was directly regulated by the LSD1-MyT1 complex. Knockdown of either LSD1 or MyT1 derepressed the expression of endogenous target genes and inhibited cell proliferation of a neuroblastoma cell line, Neuro2a. We propose that formation of tissue-specific combinations of coregulator complexes is a critical mechanism for tissue-specific transcriptional regulation."

A total of 45,016 contigs and 25,519 unigenes were generated from the de novo transcriptome assembly, and 15,167 unigenes were annotated via BLAST querying against current databases, including nr, SwissProt, the Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO). Aligning the transcript to Tetranychus urticae genome, the 19255 (75.45%) of the transcripts had significant (e-value <10-5) matches to T. urticae DNA genome, 19111 sequences matched to T. urticae proteome with an average protein length coverage of 42.55%. Core Eukaryotic Genes Mapping Approach (CEGMA) analysis identified 435 core eukaryotic genes (CEGs) in the CSM dataset corresponding to 95% coverage. Ten gene categories that relate to insecticide resistance in arthropod were generated from CSM transcriptome, including 53 P450-, 22 GSTs-, 23 CarEs-, 1 AChE-, 7 GluCls-, 9 nAChRs-, 8 GABA receptor-, 1 sodium channel-, 6 ATPase- and 12 Cyt b genes. We developed significant molecular resources for T. cinnabarinus putatively involved in insecticide resistance. The transcriptome assembly analysis will significantly facilitate our study on the mechanism of adapting environmental stress (including insecticide) in CSM at the molecular level, and will be very important for developing new control strategies against this pest mite."

This cohort constitutes one of the most important sources for the assessment of radiation risk. It is exceptional because it comprises information on several other risk factors. While most of the workers have been exposed to external gamma radiation, a large proportion has additionally been exposed to internal radiation from inhaled plutonium. Compared to a previous study by Azizova et al. 2012, the updated dosimetry system MWDS-2008 has been applied and methods of analysis have been revised. We extend the analysis of the significant incidence risk and observe that main detrimental effects of external radiation exposure occur after more than about 30 years. For mortality, significant risk was found in males with an excess relative risk per dose of 0.09 (95% CI: 0.02; 0.16) while risk was insignificant for females. With respect to internal radiation exposure no association to risk could be established."

Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a downstream mediator of TGF-β, and transgelin, a binding and stabilising protein of the cytoskeleton, are both regulated by TGF-β1 and play an important role in airway remodelling. Both have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of BPD. The aim of the present study was to clarify whether caffeine, an unspecific phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor, and rolipram, a prototypical PDE-4 selective inhibitor, were both able to affect TGF-β1-induced Smad signalling and CTGF/transgelin expression in lung epithelial cells. Furthermore, the effect of transgelin knock-down on Smad signalling was studied. The pharmacological effect of caffeine and rolipram on Smad signalling was investigated by means of a luciferase assay via transfection of a TGF-β1-inducible reporter plasmid in A549 cells. The regulation of CTGF and transgelin expression by caffeine and rolipram were studied by promoter analysis, real-time PCR and Western blot. Endogenous transgelin expression was down-regulated by lentiviral transduction mediating transgelin-specific shRNA expression. The addition of caffeine and rolipram inhibited TGF-β1 induced reporter gene activity in a concentration-related manner. They also antagonized the TGF-β1 induced up-regulation of CTGF and transgelin on the promoter-, the mRNA-, and the protein-level. Functional analysis showed that transgelin silencing reduced TGF-β1 induced Smad-signalling and CTGF induction in lung epithelial cells. The present study highlights possible new molecular mechanisms of caffeine and rolipram including an inhibition of Smad signalling and of TGF-β1 regulated genes involved in airway remodelling. An understanding of these mechanisms might help to explain the protective effects of caffeine in prevention of BPD and suggests rolipram to be a potent replacement for caffeine."
https://openalex.org/W2009732694,"A PEG-based, folate mediated, active tumor targeting drug delivery system using DOX-hyd-PEG-FA nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared. DOX-hyd-PEG-FA NPs showed a significantly faster DOX release in pH 5.0 medium than in pH 7.4 medium. Compared with DOX-hyd-PEG NPs, DOX-hyd-PEG-FA NPs increased the intracellular accumulation of DOX and showed a DOX translocation from lysosomes to nucleus. The cytotoxicity of DOX-hyd-PEG-FA NPs on KB cells was much higher than that of free DOX, DOX-ami-PEG-FA NPs and DOX-hyd-PEG NPs. The cytotoxicity of DOX-hyd-PEG-FA NPs on KB cells was attenuated in the presence of exogenous folic acid. The IC50 of DOX-hyd-PEG-FA NPs and DOX-hyd-PEG NPs on A549 cells showed no significant difference. After DOX-hyd-PEG-FA NPs were intravenously administered, the amount of DOX distributed in tumor tissue was significantly increased, while the amount of DOX distributed in heart was greatly decreased as compared with free DOX. Compared with free DOX, NPs yielded improved survival rate, prolonged life span, delayed tumor growth and reduced the cardiotoxicity in tumor bearing mice model. These results indicated that the acid sensitivity, passive and active tumor targeting abilities were likely to act synergistically to enhance the drug delivery efficiency of DOX-hyd-PEG-FA NPs. Therefore, DOX-hyd-PEG-FA NPs are a promising drug delivery system for targeted cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2082307865,"Cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum, CDDP) is a well-known chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of several cancers. However, the precise mechanism underlying apoptosis of cancer cells induced by CDDP remains unclear. In this study, we show mechanistically that CDDP induces GM3-mediated apoptosis of HCT116 cells by inhibiting cell proliferation, and increasing DNA fragmentation and mitochondria-dependent apoptosis signals. CDDP induced apoptosis within cells through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), regulated the ROS-mediated expression of Bax, Bcl-2, and p53, and induced the degradation of the poly (ADP-ribosyl) polymerase (PARP). We also checked expression levels of different gangliosides in HCT116 cells in the presence or absence of CDDP. Interestingly, among the gangliosides, CDDP augmented the expression of only GM3 synthase and its product GM3. Reduction of the GM3 synthase level through ectopic expression of GM3 small interfering RNA (siRNA) rescued HCT116 cells from CDDP-induced apoptosis. This was evidenced by inhibition of apoptotic signals by reducing ROS production through the regulation of 12-lipoxigenase activity. Furthermore, the apoptotic sensitivity to CDDP was remarkably increased in GM3 synthase-transfected HCT116 cells compared to that in controls. In addition, GM3 synthase-transfected cells treated with CDDP exhibited an increased accumulation of intracellular ROS. These results suggest the CDDP-induced oxidative apoptosis of HCT116 cells is mediated by GM3."
https://openalex.org/W1975746243,"Since the early 1980s remarkable progress has been made in understanding the role of the HER2 locus in carcinogenesis, but many details of its regulatory network are still elusive. We recently reported the finding of 367 new human microRNA (miRNA) genes of which one, mir-4728, is encoded in an intron of the HER2 gene. Here, we confirm that the HER2 oncogene is a bi-functional locus encoding the membrane receptor and a functional miRNA gene. We further show that miR-4728-3p has alternative functionalities depending on the region used for interaction with its target; the canonical seed between nucleotides 2-8 or a novel, more internal seed shifted to nucleotides 6-12. Analysis of public data shows that this internal seed region, although rare compared to the far more abundant canonical 2-8 seed interaction, can also direct targeted down-regulation by other miRNAs. Through the internal seed, miR-4728-3p regulates expression of estrogen receptor alpha, an interaction that would have remained undetected if classic rules for miRNA-target interaction had been applied. In summary, we present here an alternative mode of miRNA regulation and demonstrate this dual function of the HER2 locus, linking the two major biomarkers in breast cancer."

Ectopic expression of DspA/E in plant or in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is toxic, indicating that DspA/E likely targets a cellular process conserved between yeast and plant. To unravel the mode of action of DspA/E, we screened the Euroscarf S. cerevisiae library for mutants resistant to DspA/E-induced growth arrest. The most resistant mutants (Δsur4, Δfen1, Δipt1, Δskn1, Δcsg1, Δcsg2, Δorm1, and Δorm2) were impaired in the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway. Exogenously supplied sphingolipid precursors such as the long chain bases (LCBs) phytosphingosine and dihydrosphingosine also suppressed the DspA/E-induced yeast growth defect. Expression of DspA/E in yeast down-regulated LCB biosynthesis and induced a rapid decrease in LCB levels, indicating that serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), the first and rate-limiting enzyme of the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway, was repressed. SPT down-regulation was mediated by dephosphorylation and activation of Orm proteins that negatively regulate SPT.

https://openalex.org/W2146908354,"MAGE-A3 is a potential target for immunotherapy due to its tumor-specific nature and expression in several tumor types. Clinical data on MAGE-A3 immunotherapy have raised many questions that can only be addressed by using animal models. In the present study, different aspects of the murine anti-tumor immune responses induced by a recombinant MAGE-A3 protein (recMAGE-A3) in combination with different immunostimulants (AS01, AS02, CpG7909 or AS15) were investigated.Based on cytokine profile analyses and protection against challenge with MAGE-A3-expressing tumor, the combination recMAGE-A3+AS15 was selected for further experimental work, in particular to study the mechanisms of anti-tumor responses. By using MHC class I-, MHC class II-, perforin-, B-cell- and IFN-γ- knock-out mice and CD4+ T cell-, CD8+ T cell- and NK cell- depleted mice, we demonstrated that CD4+ T cells and NK cells are the main anti-tumor effectors, and that IFN-γ is a major effector molecule. This mouse tumor model also established the need to repeat recMAGE-A3+AS15 injections to sustain efficient anti-tumor responses. Furthermore, our results indicated that the efficacy of tumor rejection by the elicited anti-MAGE-A3 responses depends on the proportion of tumor cells expressing MAGE-A3.The recMAGE-A3+AS15 cancer immunotherapy efficiently induced an antigen-specific, functional and long-lasting immune response able to recognize and eliminate MAGE-A3-expressing tumor cells up to several months after the last immunization in mice. The data highlighted the importance of the immunostimulant to induce a Th1-type immune response, as well as the key role played by IFN-γ, CD4+ T cells and NK cells in the anti-tumoral effect."
https://openalex.org/W2000359348,"Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) asymptomatic infection has been previously linked to Type 1 diabetes (T1D) and Multiple Sclerosis. An association between MAP infection and Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) was also proposed only in a case report. This study aimed to investigate the robustness of the latter association, testing a large cohort of HT and healthy control (HCs) subjects, all from Sardinia. Prevalence of anti-MAP3865c Abs was assessed by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Moreover, given that human ZnT8 is specifically expressed in the pancreatic β-cells, in the follicle epithelial cells and in the parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland, we also tested ZnT8 epitopes homologues to the MAP3865c immunodominant peptides previously identified. Indeed, Abs targeting MAP3865c and ZnT8 homologous regions display similar frequencies in patients and controls, thus suggesting that Abs recognizing these epitopes could be cross-reactive. A statistically significant difference was found between HT patients and HCs when analyzing the humoral response mounted against MAP3865c/ZnT8 homologues epitopes. To our knowledge, this is the first report, which provides statistically significant evidence sustaining the existence of an association between MAP sero-reactivity and HT. Further studies are required to investigate the relevance of MAP to HT, aimed at deciphering if this pathogen can be at play in triggering this autoimmune disease. Likewise, genetic polymorphism of the host, and other environmental factors need to be investigated."
https://openalex.org/W2049937138,"Most studies concerning the foraging ecology of marine vertebrates are limited to breeding adults, although other life history stages might comprise half the total population. For penguins, little is known about juvenile dispersal, a period when individuals may be susceptible to increased mortality given their naïve foraging behaviour. Therefore, we used satellite telemetry to study king penguin fledglings (n = 18) from two sites in the Southwest Atlantic in December 2007. The two sites differed with respect to climate and proximity to the Antarctic Polar Front (APF), a key oceanographic feature generally thought to be important for king penguin foraging success. Accordingly, birds from both sites foraged predominantly in the vicinity of the APF. Eight king penguins were tracked for periods greater than 120 days; seven of these (three from the Falkland Islands and four from South Georgia) migrated into the Pacific. Only one bird from the Falkland Islands moved into the Indian Ocean, visiting the northern limit of the winter pack-ice. Three others from the Falkland Islands migrated to the eastern coast of Tierra del Fuego before travelling south. Derived tracking parameters describing their migratory behaviour showed no significant differences between sites. Nevertheless, generalized linear habitat modelling revealed that juveniles from the Falkland Islands spent more time in comparatively shallow waters with low sea surface temperature, sea surface height and chlorophyll variability. Birds from South Georgia spent more time in deeper waters with low sea surface temperature and sea surface height, but high concentrations of chlorophyll. Our results indicate that inexperienced king penguins, irrespective of the location of their natal site in relation to the position of the APF, develop their foraging skills progressively over time, including specific adaptations to the environment around their prospective breeding site."
https://openalex.org/W2019119369,"Formins perform essential roles in actin assembly and organization in vivo, but they also require tight regulation of their activities to produce properly functioning actin structures. Saccharomyces cerevisiae Bud14 is one member of an emerging class of formin regulators that target the FH2 domain to inhibit actin polymerization, but little is known about how these regulators are themselves controlled in vivo. Kelch proteins are critical for cell polarity and morphogenesis in a wide range of organisms, but their mechanistic roles in these processes are still largely undefined. Here, we report that S. cerevisiae Kelch proteins, Kel1 and Kel2, associate with Bud14 in cell extracts to form a stable 520-kDa complex with an apparent stoichiometry of 2:2:1 Bud14/Kel1/Kel2. Using pairwise combinations of GFP- and red fluorescent protein-tagged proteins, we show that Kel1, Kel2, and Bud14 interdependently co-localize at polarity sites. By analyzing single, double, and triple mutants, we show that Kel1 and Kel2 function in the same pathway as Bud14 in regulating Bnr1-mediated actin cable formation. Loss of any component of the complex results in long, bent, and hyper-stable actin cables, accompanied by defects in secretory vesicle traffic during polarized growth and septum formation during cytokinesis. These observations directly link S. cerevisiae Kelch proteins to the control of formin activity, and together with previous observations made for S. pombe homologues tea1p and tea3p, they have broad implications for understanding Kelch function in other systems."
https://openalex.org/W2033671339,"Inappropriate activation of cell cycle proteins, in particular cyclin D/Cdk4, is implicated in neuronal death induced by various pathologic stresses, including DNA damage and ischemia. Key targets of Cdk4 in proliferating cells include members of the E2F transcription factors, which mediate the expression of cell cycle proteins as well as death-inducing genes. However, the presence of multiple E2F family members complicates our understanding of their role in death. We focused on whether E2F4, an E2F member believed to exhibit crucial control over the maintenance of a differentiated state of neurons, may be critical in ischemic neuronal death. We observed that, in contrast to E2F1 and E2F3, which sensitize to death, E2F4 plays a crucial protective role in neuronal death evoked by DNA damage, hypoxia, and global ischemic insult both in vitro and in vivo. E2F4 occupies promoter regions of proapoptotic factors, such as B-Myb, under basal conditions. Following stress exposure, E2F4-p130 complexes are lost rapidly along with the presence of E2F4 at E2F-containing B-Myb promoter sites. In contrast, the presence of E2F1 at B-Myb sites increases with stress. Furthermore, B-Myb and C-Myb expression increases with ischemic insult. Taken together, we propose a model by which E2F4 plays a protective role in neurons from ischemic insult by forming repressive complexes that prevent prodeath factors such as Myb from being expressed."
https://openalex.org/W2088850800,"Introduction Assessing the contextual factors that influence walking for transportation is important to develop more walkable environments and promote physical activity. To advance previous research focused on residential environments and overall walking for transportation, the present study investigates objective environmental factors assessed around the residence, the workplace, the home – work itinerary, and the home – supermarket itinerary, and considered overall walking for transportation but also walking to work and to shops. Methods Data from the RECORD Study involving 7290 participants recruited in 2007–2008, aged 30–79 years, and residing in the Paris metropolitan area were analyzed. Multilevel ordinal regression analyses were conducted to investigate environmental characteristics associated with self-reported overall walking for transportation, walking to work, and walking to shops. Results High individual education was associated with overall walking for transportation, with walking to work, and walking to shops. Among workers, a high residential neighborhood education was associated with increased overall walking for transportation, while a high workplace neighborhood education was related to an increased time spent walking to work. The residential density of destinations was positively associated with overall walking for transportation, with walking to work, and with walking to shops, while the workplace density of destinations was positively associated with overall walking for transportation among workers. Environmental factors assessed around the itineraries were not associated with walking to work or to the shops. Conclusion This research improves our understanding of the role of the environments on walking for transportation by accounting for some of the environments visited beyond the residential neighborhood. It shows that workers' walking habits are more influenced by the density of destinations around the workplace than around the residence. These results provide insight for the development of policies and programs to encourage population level active commuting."
https://openalex.org/W2035950984,"Quality control operates at different steps in translation to limit errors to approximately one mistranslated codon per 10,000 codons during mRNA-directed protein synthesis. Recent studies have suggested that error rates may actually vary considerably during translation under different growth conditions. Here we examined the misincorporation of Phe at Tyr codons during synthesis of a recombinant antibody produced in tyrosine-limited Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Tyr to Phe replacements were previously found to occur throughout the antibody at a rate of up to 0.7% irrespective of the identity or context of the Tyr codon translated. Despite this comparatively high mistranslation rate, no significant change in cellular viability was observed. Monitoring of Phe and Tyr levels revealed that changes in error rates correlated with changes in amino acid pools, suggesting that mischarging of tRNA(Tyr) with noncognate Phe by tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase was responsible for mistranslation. Steady-state kinetic analyses of CHO cytoplasmic tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase revealed a 25-fold lower specificity for Tyr over Phe as compared with previously characterized bacterial enzymes, consistent with the observed increase in translation error rates during tyrosine limitation. Functional comparisons of mammalian and bacterial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase revealed key differences at residues responsible for amino acid recognition, highlighting differences in evolutionary constraints for translation quality control."
https://openalex.org/W2160880203,"The in vivo study of protease activated receptors (PARs) in platelets is complicated due to species specific expression profiles. Human platelets express PAR1 and PAR4 whereas mouse platelets express PAR3 and PAR4. Further, PAR subtypes interact with one another to influence activation and signaling. The goal of the current study was to generate mice expressing PAR1 on their platelets using transgenic approaches to mimic PAR expression found in human platelets. This system would allow us to examine specific signaling from PAR1 and the PAR1-PAR4 heterodimer in vivo. Our first approach used the mouse GPIbα promoter to drive expression of mouse PAR1 in platelets (GPIbα-Tg-mPAR1). We obtained the expected frequency of founders carrying the transgene and had the expected Mendelian distribution of the transgene in multiple founders. However, we did not observe expression or a functional response of PAR1. As a second approach, we targeted human PAR1 with the same promoter (GPIbα-Tg-hPAR1). Once again we observed the expected frequency and distributing of the transgene. Human PAR1 expression was detected in platelets from the GPIbα-Tg-hPAR1 mice by flow cytometry, however, at a lower level than for human platelets. Despite a low level of PAR1 expression, platelets from the GPIbα-Tg-hPAR1 mice did not respond to the PAR1 agonist peptide (SFLLRN). In addition, they did not respond to thrombin when crossed to the PAR4−/− mice. Finally, we used an alternative platelet specific promoter, human αIIb, to express human PAR1 (αIIb-Tg-hPAR1). Similar to our previous attempts, we obtained the expected number of founders but did not detect PAR1 expression or response in platelets from αIIb-Tg-hPAR1 mice. Although unsuccessful, the experiments described in this report provide a resource for future efforts in generating mice expressing PAR1 on their platelets. We provide an experimental framework and offer considerations that will save time and research funds."
https://openalex.org/W1968387516,"Background In 2009 the state government of Madhya Pradesh, India launched an emergency obstetric transportation service, Janani Express Yojana (JEY), to support the cash transfer program that promotes institutional delivery. JEY, a large scale public private partnership, lowers geographical access barriers to facility based care. The state contracts and pays private agencies to provide emergency transportation at no cost to the user. The objective was to study (a) the utilization of JEY among women delivering in health facilities, (b) factors associated with usage, (c) the timeliness of the service. Methods A cross sectional facility based study was conducted in facilities that carried out > ten deliveries a month. Researchers who spent five days in each facility administered a questionnaire to all women who gave birth there to elicit socio-demographic characteristics and transport related details. Results 35% of women utilised JEY to reach a facility, however utilization varied between study districts. Uptake was highest among women from rural areas (44%), scheduled tribes (55%), and poorly educated women (40%). Living in rural areas and belonging to scheduled tribes were significant predictors for JEY usage. Almost 1/3 of JEY users (n = 104) experienced a transport related delay. Discussion The JEY service model complements the cash transfer program by providing transport to a facility to give birth. A study of the distribution of utilization in population subgroups suggests the intervention was successful in reaching the most vulnerable population, promoting equity in access. While 1/3 of women utilized the service and it saved them money; 30% experienced significant transport related delays in reaching a facility, which is comparable to women using public transportation. Further research is needed to understand why utilization is low, to explore if there is a need for service expansion at the community level and to improve the overall time efficiency of JEY."

Various types of commercially available metal ink are widely used in different industries such as the solar cell, radio frequency identification (RFID) and light emitting diode (LED) industries, with limited usage in semiconductor packaging. The use of printed ink in semiconductor IC packaging is limited by several factors such as poor electrical performance and mechanical strength. Poor adhesion of the printed metal track to the epoxy molding compound is another critical factor that has caused a decline in interest in the application of printing technology to the semiconductor industry. In this study, two different groups of adhesion promoters, based on metal and polymer groups, were used to promote adhesion between the printed ink and the epoxy molding substrate. The experimental data show that silver ink with a metal oxide adhesion promoter adheres better than silver ink with a polymer adhesion promoter. This result can be explained by the hydroxyl bonding between the metal oxide promoter and the silane grouping agent on the epoxy substrate, which contributes a greater adhesion strength compared to the polymer adhesion promoter. Hypotheses of the physical and chemical functions of both adhesion promoters are described in detail."
https://openalex.org/W2061441842,"The fibrillar assembly and deposition of amyloid β (Aβ) protein, a key pathology of Alzheimer disease, can occur in the form of parenchymal amyloid plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Familial forms of CAA exist in the absence of appreciable parenchymal amyloid pathology. The molecular interplay between parenchymal amyloid plaques and CAA is unclear. Here we investigated how early-onset parenchymal amyloid plaques impact the development of microvascular amyloid in transgenic mice. Tg-5xFAD mice, which produce non-mutated human Aβ and develop early-onset parenchymal amyloid plaques, were bred to Tg-SwDI mice, which produce familial CAA mutant human Aβ and develop cerebral microvascular amyloid. The bigenic mice presented with an elevated accumulation of Aβ and fibrillar amyloid in the brain compared with either single transgenic line. Tg-SwDI/Tg-5xFAD mice were devoid of microvascular amyloid, the prominent pathology of Tg-SwDI mice, but exhibited larger parenchymal amyloid plaques compared with Tg-5xFAD mice. The larger parenchymal amyloid deposits were associated with a higher loss of cortical neurons and elevated activated microglia in the bigenic Tg-SwDI/Tg-5xFAD mice. The periphery of parenchymal amyloid plaques was largely composed of CAA mutant Aβ. Non-mutated Aβ fibril seeds promoted CAA mutant Aβ fibril formation in vitro. Further, intrahippocampal administration of biotin-labeled CAA mutant Aβ peptide accumulated on and adjacent to pre-existing parenchymal amyloid plaques in Tg-5xFAD mice. These findings indicate that early-onset parenchymal amyloid plaques can serve as a scaffold to capture CAA mutant Aβ peptides and prevent their accumulation in cerebral microvessels."
https://openalex.org/W2053732812,"2-O-α-Glucosylglycerol phosphorylase (GGP) from Bacillus selenitireducens catalyzes both the reversible phosphorolysis of 2-O-α-glucosylglycerol (GG) and the hydrolysis of β-d-glucose 1-phosphate (βGlc1P). GGP belongs to the glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 65 and can efficiently and specifically produce GG. However, its structural basis has remained unclear. In this study, the crystal structures of GGP complexed with glucose and the glucose analog isofagomine and glycerol were determined. Subsite -1 of GGP is similar to those of other GH65 enzymes, maltose phosphorylase and kojibiose phosphorylase, whereas subsite +1 is largely different and is well designed for GG recognition. An automated docking analysis was performed to complement these crystal structures, βGlc1P being docked at an appropriate position. To investigate the importance of residues at subsite +1 in the bifunctionality of GGP, we constructed mutants at these residues. Y327F and K587A did not show detectable activities for either reverse phosphorolysis or βGlc1P hydrolysis. Y572F also showed significantly reduced activities for both of these reactions. In contrast, W381F showed significantly reduced reverse phosphorolytic activity but retained βGlc1P hydrolysis. The mode of substrate recognition and the reaction mechanisms of GGP were proposed based on these analyses. Specifically, an extensive hydrogen bond network formed by Tyr-327, Tyr-572, Lys-587, and water molecules contributes to fixing the acceptor molecule in both reverse phosphorolysis (glycerol) and βGlc1P hydrolysis (water) for a glycosyl transfer reaction. This study will contribute to the development of a large scale production system of GG by facilitating the rational engineering of GGP."

The net pattern mutation creates breaks in the seed coat of soybean (Glycine max) because of ruptured cell walls. Using RNA-Seq, we examined the seed coat transcriptome from three stages of immature seed development in two pairs of isolines with normal or defective seed coat phenotypes due to the net pattern. The genome-wide comparative study of the transcript profiles of these isolines revealed 364 differentially expressed genes in common between the two varieties that were further divided into different broad functional categories. Genes related to cell wall processes accounted for 19% of the differentially expressed genes in the middle developmental stage of 100–200 mg seed weight. Within this class, the cell wall proline-rich and glycine-rich protein genes were highly differentially expressed in both genetic backgrounds. Other genes that showed significant expression changes in each of the isoline pairs at the 100–200 mg seed weight stage were xylem serine proteinase, fasciclin-related genes, auxin and stress response related genes, TRANSPARENT TESTA 1 (TT1) and other transcription factors. The mutant appears to shift the timing of either the increase or decrease in the levels of some of the transcripts. The analysis of these data sets reveals the physiological changes that the seed coat undergoes during the formation of the breaks in the cell wall."

However, cardiac function, regarding the association of hypertension and baroreflex dysfunction, has not been previously evaluated by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) using intracardiac echocardiographic catheter.We evaluated exercise tests, baroreflex sensitivity and cardiovascular autonomic control, cardiac function, and biventricular invasive pressures in rats 10 weeks after sinoaortic denervation (SAD). The rats (n = 32) were divided into 4 groups: 16 Wistar (W) with (n = 8) or without SAD (n = 8) and 16 spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with (n = 8) or without SAD (SHRSAD) (n = 8). Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) did not change between the groups with or without SAD; however, compared to W, SHR groups had higher BP levels and BP variability was increased. Exercise testing showed that SHR had better functional capacity compared to SAD and SHRSAD. Echocardiography showed left ventricular (LV) concentric hypertrophy; segmental systolic and diastolic biventricular dysfunction; indirect signals of pulmonary arterial hypertension, mostly evident in SHRSAD. The end-diastolic right ventricular (RV) pressure increased in all groups compared to W, and the end-diastolic LV pressure increased in SHR and SHRSAD groups compared to W, and in SHRSAD compared to SAD.Our results suggest that baroreflex dysfunction impairs cardiac function, and increases pulmonary artery pressure, supporting a role for baroreflex dysfunction in the pathogenesis of hypertensive cardiac disease. Moreover, TEE is a useful and feasible noninvasive technique that allows the assessment of cardiac function, particularly RV indices in this model of cardiac disease."
https://openalex.org/W2073159058,"Aim p16 Methylation frequently occurs in carcinogenesis. While it has been hypothesized that the p16 methylation states are dynamically maintained in cancer cells, direct evidence supporting this hypothesis has not been available until now. Methods A fusion cell model was established which reprogrammed the native DNA methylation pattern of the cells. The methylation status of the p16 alleles was then repeatedly quantitatively analyzed in the fusion monoclonal, parental cancer cell lines (p16-completely methylated-AGS and unmethylated-MGC803), and HCT116 non-fusion cell using DHPLC and bisulfite sequencing. Histone methylation was analyzed using chromatin immuno-precipitation (ChIP)-PCR. P16 expression status was determined using immuno-staining and RT-PCR. Results The methylation status for the majority of the p16 alleles was stably maintained in the fusion monoclonal cells after up to 60 passages. Most importantly, focal de novo methylation, demethylation, and hydroxymethylation were consistently observed within about 27% of the p16 alleles in the fusion monoclones, but not the homozygously methylated or unmethylated parental cells. Furthermore, subclones of the monoclones consistently maintained the same p16 methylation pattern. A similar phenomenon was also observed using the p16 hemi-methylated HCT116 non-fusion cancer cell line. Interestingly, transcription was not observed in p16 alleles that were hydroxymethylated with an antisense-strand-specific pattern. Also, the levels of H3K9 and H3K4 trimethylation in the fusion cells were found to be slightly lower than the parental AGS and MGC803 cells, respectively. Conclusion The present study provides the first direct evidence confirming that the methylation states of p16 CpG islands is not only homeostatically maintained, but also accompanied by a dynamic process of transient focal methylation, demethylation, and hydroxymethylation in cancer cells."

Whereas KIT D816V/H mutation is a well-characterized oncogenic event and principal cause of systemic mastocytosis, the homologous CSF-1R D802V has not been identified in human cancers. The KIT D816V oncogenic mutation triggers resistance to the RTK inhibitor Imatinib used as first line treatment against chronic myeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal tumors. CSF-1R is also sensitive to Imatinib and this sensitivity is altered by mutation D802V. Previous in silico characterization of the D816V mutation in KIT evidenced that the mutation caused a structure reorganization of the juxtamembrane region (JMR) and facilitated its departure from the kinase domain (KD). In this study, we showed that the equivalent CSF-1R D802V mutation does not promote such structural effects on the JMR despite of a reduction on some key H-bonds interactions controlling the JMR binding to the KD. In addition, this mutation disrupts the allosteric communication between two essential regulatory fragments of the receptors, the JMR and the A-loop. Nevertheless, the mutation-induced shift towards an active conformation observed in KIT D816V is not observed in CSF-1R D802V. The distinct impact of equivalent mutation in two homologous RTKs could be associated with the sequence difference between both receptors in the native form, particularly in the JMR region. A local mutation-induced perturbation on the A-loop structure observed in both receptors indicates the stabilization of an inactive non-inhibited form, which Imatinib cannot bind."
https://openalex.org/W1963497208,"End-binding 1 (EB1) proteins are evolutionarily conserved components of microtubule (MT) plus-end tracking protein that regulate MT dynamics. Giardia lamblia, with two nuclei and cytoskeletal structures, requires accurate MT distribution for division. In this study, we show that a single EB1 homolog gene of G. lamblia regulates MT dynamics in mitosis. The haemagglutinin-tagged G. lamblia EB1 (GlEB1) localizes to the nuclear envelopes and median bodies, and is transiently present in mitotic spindles of dividing cells. Knockdown of GlEB1 expression using the morpholinos-based anti-EB1 oligonucleotides, resulted in a significant defect in mitosis of Giardia trophozoites. The MT-binding assays using recombinant GlEB1 (rGlEB1) proteins demonstrated that rGlEB1102–238, but not rGlEB11–184, maintains an MT-binding ability comparable with that of the full length protein, rGlEB11–238. Size exclusion chromatography showed that rGlEB1 is present as a dimer formed by its C-terminal domain and a disulfide bond. In vitro-mutagenesis of GlEB1 indicated that an intermolecular disulfide bond is made between cysteine #13 of the two monomers. Complementation assay using the BIM1 knockout mutant yeast, the yeast homolog of mammalian EB1, indicated that expression of the C13S mutant GlEB1 protein cannot rescue the mitotic defect of the BIM1 mutant yeast. These results suggest that dimerization of GlEB1 via the 13th cysteine residues plays a role during mitosis in Giardia."
https://openalex.org/W2161682860,"Epinephrine and norepinephrine are present in the pro-urine. β-Adrenergic receptor (β-AR) blockers administered to counteract sympathetic overstimulation in patients with congestive heart failure have a negative inotropic effect, resulting in reduced cardiac contractility. Positive inotropes, β1-AR agonists, are used to improve cardiac functions. Active Ca(2+) reabsorption in the late distal convoluted and connecting tubules (DCT2/CNT) is initiated by Ca(2+) influx through the transient receptor potential vanilloid type 5 (TRPV5) Ca(2+) channel. Although it was reported that β-ARs are present in the DCT2/CNT region, their role in active Ca(2+) reabsorption remains elusive. Here we revealed that β1-AR, but not β2-AR, is localized with TRPV5 in DCT2/CNT. Subsequently, treatment of TRPV5-expressing mouse DCT2/CNT primary cell cultures with the β1-AR agonist dobutamine showed enhanced apical-to-basolateral transepithelial Ca(2+) transport. In human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells, dobutamine was shown to stimulate cAMP production, signifying functional β1-AR expression. Fura-2 experiments demonstrated increased activity of TRPV5 in response to dobutamine, which could be prevented by the PKA inhibitor H89. Moreover, nonphosphorylable T709A-TRPV5 and phosphorylation-mimicking T709D-TRPV5 mutants were unresponsive to dobutamine. Surface biotinylation showed that dobutamine did not affect plasma membrane abundance of TRPV5. In conclusion, activation of β1-AR stimulates active Ca(2+) reabsorption in DCT2/CNT; an increase in TRPV5 activity via PKA phosphorylation of residue Thr-709 possibly plays an important role. These data explicate a calciotropic role in addition to the inotropic property of β1-AR."
https://openalex.org/W2015501021,"The aim of this study was to determine whether the concentration of disintegrin and metalloprotease protein12 (ADAM12) in first trimester maternal serum can be used as a marker for first-trimester complete spontaneous abortions, missed abortions, ectopic pregnancies and hydatidiform moles.The maternal serum concentrations of ADAM12 were measured in the range of 5-9+6 weeks of gestation using an automated AutoDelfia immunoassay platform in 9 cases of complete spontaneous abortion, 27 cases of missed abortions, 56 cases of ectopic pregnancies, 12 cases of hydatidiform moles, and 100 controls. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine significant factors for predicting adverse pregnancy outcomes in early pregnancy. Screening performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curves.Two hundred and four women were enrolled in the study. In the control group, the level of ADAM12 increased with gestational age. The median ADAM12 levels in the spontaneous abortion (0.430 MoM), ectopic pregnancy (0.460 MoM) and hydatidiform mole (0.037 MoM) groups were lower than that in the control group, while the median ADAM12 level in the missed abortion group (1.062 MoM) was not significant from the controls (1.002 MoM). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the level of ADAM12 in maternal serum facilitated the detection of ectopic pregnancies (OR = 0.909; 95% CI = 0.841 ∼ 0.982) and complete spontaneous abortion (OR = 0.863; 95% CI = 0.787 ∼ 0.946).In complete spontaneous abortion and ectopic pregnancy, ADAM12 maintained at low levels in early pregnancies, and there were significant differences compared to normal pregnancies. ADAM12 is a promising marker for the diagnosis of complete spontaneous abortion and ectopic pregnancy in symptomatic women, and under certain conditions, ADAM12 can diagnose ectopic pregnancy and spontaneous abortion before an ultrasonographic detection of the conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2059924058,"Microdeletions in the AZF region of the Y chromosome are among the most frequent genetic causes of male infertility, although the specific role of the genes located in this region is not fully understood. AZFa and AZFb deletions impair spermatogenesis since no spermatozoa are found in the testis. Deletions of the AZFc region, despite being the most frequent in azoospermic patients, do not correlate with spermatogenic failure. Therefore, the aim of this work was to develop a screening method to ascertain the presence of the main spermatogenesis candidate genes located in the AZFc region in the light of the identification of those responsible for spermatogenic failure. DAZ, CDY, BPY2, PRY, GOLGA2LY and CSGP4LY genes were selected on the basis of their location in the AZFc region, testis-only expression, and confirmed or predicted protein codification. AMEL and SRY were used as amplification controls. The identification of Real Time PCR products was performed by High Resolution Melting analysis with SYTO 9 as intercalating dye. The herein described method allows a rapid, simple, low-cost, high-throughput screening for deletions of the main AZFc genes in patients with spermatogenic failure. This provides a strategy that would accelerate the identification of spermatogenesis candidate genes in larger populations of patients with non-obstructive idiopathic azoospermia."
https://openalex.org/W1979543070,"There are several indigenous ethnic populations along the silk road in the Northwest of China that display clear differences in culture and social customs, perhaps as a result of geographic isolation and different linguistic traditions. However, extensive trade and other interactions probably facilitated the admixture of different gene pools between these populations over the last two millennia. To further explore the evolutionary relationships of the 13 ethnic populations residing in Northwest China and to reveal the features of population admixture, the 9 most-commonly employed CODIS loci (D3S1358, TH01, D5S818, D13S317, D7S820, CSF1PO, vWA, TPOX, FGA) were selected for genotyping and further analysis. Phylogenetic tree and principal component analysis revealed clear pattern of population differentiation between 4 populations living in Sinkiang Uighur Autonomous Region and other 9 populations dwelled in the upper regions of Silk Road. R matrix regression showed high-level gene flow and population admixture dose exist among these ethic populations in the Northwest region of China. Furthermore, the Mantel test suggests that larger percent of genetic variance (21.58% versus 2.3%) can be explained by geographic isolation than linguistic barriers, which matched with the contribution of geographic factors to other world populations."
https://openalex.org/W2010288993,"Regulation of transcription is one of the mechanisms involved in animal development, directing changes in patterning and cell fate specification. Large temporal data series, based on microarrays across the life cycle of the fly Drosophila melanogaster, revealed the existence of groups of genes which expression increases or decreases temporally correlated during the life cycle. These groups of genes are enriched in different biological functions. Here, instead of searching for temporal coincidence in gene expression using the entire genome expression data, we searched for temporal coincidence in gene expression only within predefined catalogues of functionally related genes and investigated whether a catalogue's expression profile can be used to generate larger catalogues, enriched in genes necessary for the same function. We analyzed the expression profiles from genes already associated with early neurodevelopment and late neurodifferentiation, at embryonic stages 16 and 17 of Drosophila life cycle. We hypothesized that during this interval we would find global downregulation of genes important for early neuronal development together with global upregulation of genes necessary for the final differentiation of neurons. Our results were consistent with this hypothesis. We then investigated if the expression profile of gene catalogues representing particular processes of neural development matched the temporal sequence along which these processes occur. The profiles of genes involved in patterning, neurogenesis, axogenesis or synaptic transmission matched the prediction, with largest transcript values at the time when the corresponding biological process takes place in the embryo. Furthermore, we obtained catalogues enriched in genes involved in temporally matching functions by performing a genome-wide systematic search for genes with their highest expression levels at the corresponding embryonic intervals. These findings imply the use of gene expression data in combination with known biological information to predict the involvement of functionally uncharacterized genes in particular biological events."
https://openalex.org/W2105203430,"Tollip plays an important role in the interleukin-1 receptor IL-1R and Toll pathways. As a modulator of the immune pathway, it indirectly controls the amount of antimicrobial peptides. This could indicate a vital step in maintaining animal immune systems and preventing infection. Evolutionary questions are crucial to understanding the conservation and functioning of the biochemical pathways like the Tollip-mediated one. Through an analysis of 36 sequences of the Tollip protein from different animal taxa, downloaded from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databank, we inferred diverse evolutionary parameters, such as molecular selection and structure conservation, by analyzing residue by residue, beyond the canonical parameters to this type of study, as maximum likelihood trees. We found that Tollip presented different trends in its evolving history. In primates, the protein is becoming more unstable, just the opposite is observed in the arthropod group. The most interesting finding was the concentration of positively selected residues at amino terminal ends. Some observed topological incongruences in maximum likelihood trees of complete and curated Tollip data sets could be explained through horizontal transfers, evidenced by recombination detection. These results suggest that there is more to be researched and understood about this protein."
https://openalex.org/W2008430212,"Synphilin-1 is a cytoplasmic protein that has been shown to be involved in the control of energy balance. Previously, we reported on the generation of a human synphilin-1 transgenic mouse model (SP1), in which overexpression of human synphilin-1 resulted in hyperphagia and obesity. Here, behavioral measures in SP1 mice were compared with those of their age-matched controls (NTg) at two time points: when there was not yet a group body weight difference (""pre-obese"") and when SP1 mice were heavier (""obese""). At both time points, meal pattern analyses revealed that SP1 mice displayed higher daily chow intake than non-transgenic control mice. Furthermore, there was an increase in meal size in SP1 mice compared with NTg control mice at the obese stage. In contrast, there was no meal number change between SP1 and NTg control mice. In a brief-access taste procedure, both ""pre-obese"" and ""obese"" SP1 mice displayed concentration-dependent licking across a sucrose concentration range similar to their NTg controls. However, at the pre-obese stage, SP1 mice initiated significantly more trials to sucrose across the testing sessions and licked more vigorously at the highest concentration presented, than the NTg counterparts. These group differences in responsiveness to sucrose were no longer apparent in obese SP1 mice. These results suggest that at the pre-obese stage, the increased trials to sucrose in the SP1 mice reflects increased appetitive behavior to sucrose that may be indicative of the behavioral changes that may contribute to hyperphagia and development of obesity in SP1 mice. These studies provide new insight into synphilin-1 contributions to energy homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2016350559,"The fern Dicranopteris dichotoma is an important pioneer species of the understory in Masson pine (Pinus massoniana) forests growing on acidic soils in the subtropical and tropical China. To improve our understanding of the role of D. dichotoma in nitrogen (N) uptake of these forests, a short-term 15N experiment was conducted at mountain ridge (MR, with low N level) and mountain foot (MF, with high N level). We injected 15N tracers as 15NH4, 15NO3 or 15N-glycine into the soil surrounding each plant at both MR and MF sites. Three hours after tracer injection, the fern D. dichotoma took up 15NH4+ significantly faster at MF than at MR, but it showed significantly slower uptake of 15NO3− at MF than at MR. Consequently, 15NO3− made greater contribution to the total N uptake (50% to the total N uptake) at MR than at MF, but 15N-glycine only contributed around 11% at both sites. Twenty-four hours after tracer injection, D. dichotoma preferred 15NH4+ (63%) at MR, whereas it preferred 15NO3− (47%) at MF. We concluded that the D. dichotoma responds distinctly in its uptake pattern for three available N species over temporal and spatial scales, but mainly relies on inorganic N species in the subtropical forest. This suggests that the fern employs different strategies to acquire available N which depends on N levels and time."
https://openalex.org/W2040251215,"The behaviour of the nestlings of nocturnal cavity-nesting species has relatively rarely been studied in detail because of problems connected with use of the technical devices required to provide long-term monitoring of individuals. However, long-term observation of nestling behaviour is crucial in order to identify different types of behaviour which may be caused by sibling competition at the end of nesting period. We studied behaviour of 43 Tengmalm's owl (Aegolius funereus) nestlings at 14 nests using a camera and a chip system. The nestlings perched at the nest box entrance from an average age of 28 days from hatching (range 24-34 days) until fledging, spending around 2 hours per day here in total, in periods ranging from a few seconds to 147 min (7.6±10.9 min, mean ± SD). We found that individual duration of perching at the nest box entrance was significantly influenced by nestlings' age and wing length and that the duration of perching at the nest box entrance significantly decreased with time of night. However, during daylight hours, time of day had no effect on either probability or duration of nestlings' perching. We suggest daylight perching at the nest box entrance results from nestlings' preparation for fledging, while individuals perching here during the night may gain an advantageous position for obtaining food from the parents; another possibility at all times of day is that nestlings can reaffirm their social dominance status by monopolizing the nest box entrance."
https://openalex.org/W2026290130,"Few quantitative measures of genome architecture or organization exist to support assumptions of differences between microorganisms that are broadly defined as being free-living or pathogenic. General principles about complete proteomes exist for codon usage, amino acid biases and essential or core genes. Genome-wide shifts in amino acid usage between free-living and pathogenic microorganisms result in fundamental differences in the complexity of their respective proteomes that are size and gene content independent. These differences are evident across broad phylogenetic groups–a result of environmental factors and population genetic forces rather than phylogenetic distance. A novel comparative analysis of amino acid usage–utilizing linguistic analyses of word frequency in language and text–identified a global pattern of higher peptide word repetition in 376 free-living versus 421 pathogen genomes across broad ranges of genome size, G+C content and phylogenetic ancestry. This imprint of repetitive word usage indicates free-living microorganisms have a bias for repetitive sequence usage compared to pathogens. These findings quantify fundamental differences in microbial genomes relative to life-history function."
