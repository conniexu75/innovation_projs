https://openalex.org/W3165179041,"Compartmentalization is a defining characteristic of eukaryotic cells, and partitions distinct biochemical processes into discrete subcellular locations. Microscopy1 and biochemical fractionation coupled with mass spectrometry2-4 have defined the proteomes of a variety of different organelles, but many intracellular compartments have remained refractory to such approaches. Proximity-dependent biotinylation techniques such as BioID provide an alternative approach to define the composition of cellular compartments in living cells5-7. Here we present a BioID-based map of a human cell on the basis of 192 subcellular markers, and define the intracellular locations of 4,145 unique proteins in HEK293 cells. Our localization predictions exceed the specificity of previous approaches, and enabled the discovery of proteins at the interface between the mitochondrial outer membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum that are crucial for mitochondrial homeostasis. On the basis of this dataset, we created humancellmap.org as a community resource that provides online tools for localization analysis of user BioID data, and demonstrate how this resource can be used to understand BioID results better."
https://openalex.org/W3165282863,"The concentration of dissolved oxygen in aquatic systems helps to regulate biodiversity1,2, nutrient biogeochemistry3, greenhouse gas emissions4, and the quality of drinking water5. The long-term declines in dissolved oxygen concentrations in coastal and ocean waters have been linked to climate warming and human activity6,7, but little is known about the changes in dissolved oxygen concentrations in lakes. Although the solubility of dissolved oxygen decreases with increasing water temperatures, long-term lake trajectories are difficult to predict. Oxygen losses in warming lakes may be amplified by enhanced decomposition and stronger thermal stratification8,9 or oxygen may increase as a result of enhanced primary production10. Here we analyse a combined total of 45,148 dissolved oxygen and temperature profiles and calculate trends for 393 temperate lakes that span 1941 to 2017. We find that a decline in dissolved oxygen is widespread in surface and deep-water habitats. The decline in surface waters is primarily associated with reduced solubility under warmer water temperatures, although dissolved oxygen in surface waters increased in a subset of highly productive warming lakes, probably owing to increasing production of phytoplankton. By contrast, the decline in deep waters is associated with stronger thermal stratification and loss of water clarity, but not with changes in gas solubility. Our results suggest that climate change and declining water clarity have altered the physical and chemical environment of lakes. Declines in dissolved oxygen in freshwater are 2.75 to 9.3 times greater than observed in the world’s oceans6,7 and could threaten essential lake ecosystem services2,3,5,11. Analysis of temperate lakes finds a widespread decline in dissolved oxygen concentrations in surface and deep waters, which is associated with reduced solubility at warmer surface water temperatures and increased stratification at depth."
https://openalex.org/W3165885441,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is caused by a mutation in the β-globin gene HBB1. We used a custom adenine base editor (ABE8e-NRCH)2,3 to convert the SCD allele (HBBS) into Makassar β-globin (HBBG), a non-pathogenic variant4,5. Ex vivo delivery of mRNA encoding the base editor with a targeting guide RNA into haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from patients with SCD resulted in 80% conversion of HBBS to HBBG. Sixteen weeks after transplantation of edited human HSPCs into immunodeficient mice, the frequency of HBBG was 68% and hypoxia-induced sickling of bone marrow reticulocytes had decreased fivefold, indicating durable gene editing. To assess the physiological effects of HBBS base editing, we delivered ABE8e-NRCH and guide RNA into HSPCs from a humanized SCD mouse6 and then transplanted these cells into irradiated mice. After sixteen weeks, Makassar β-globin represented 79% of β-globin protein in blood, and hypoxia-induced sickling was reduced threefold. Mice that received base-edited HSPCs showed near-normal haematological parameters and reduced splenic pathology compared to mice that received unedited cells. Secondary transplantation of edited bone marrow confirmed that the gene editing was durable in long-term haematopoietic stem cells and showed that HBBS-to-HBBG editing of 20% or more is sufficient for phenotypic rescue. Base editing of human HSPCs avoided the p53 activation and larger deletions that have been observed following Cas9 nuclease treatment. These findings point towards a one-time autologous treatment for SCD that eliminates pathogenic HBBS, generates benign HBBG, and minimizes the undesired consequences of double-strand DNA breaks. A custom adenine base editor can edit the variant of the β-globin gene that causes sickle cell disease into a non-pathogenic variant in human and mouse cells, and transplantation of the edited cells rescues sickle cell disease in mice."
https://openalex.org/W3165023010,"The human fetal immune system begins to develop early during gestation; however, factors responsible for fetal immune-priming remain elusive. We explored potential exposure to microbial agents in utero and their contribution toward activation of memory T cells in fetal tissues. We profiled microbes across fetal organs using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and detected low but consistent microbial signal in fetal gut, skin, placenta, and lungs in the 2nd trimester of gestation. We identified several live bacterial strains including Staphylococcus and Lactobacillus in fetal tissues, which induced in vitro activation of memory T cells in fetal mesenteric lymph node, supporting the role of microbial exposure in fetal immune-priming. Finally, using SEM and RNA-ISH, we visualized discrete localization of bacteria-like structures and eubacterial-RNA within 14th weeks fetal gut lumen. These findings indicate selective presence of live microbes in fetal organs during the 2nd trimester of gestation and have broader implications toward the establishment of immune competency and priming before birth."
https://openalex.org/W3165366231,"The tumour suppressor APC is the most commonly mutated gene in colorectal cancer. Loss of Apc in intestinal stem cells drives the formation of adenomas in mice via increased WNT signalling1, but reduced secretion of WNT ligands increases the ability of Apc-mutant intestinal stem cells to colonize a crypt (known as fixation)2. Here we investigated how Apc-mutant cells gain a clonal advantage over wild-type counterparts to achieve fixation. We found that Apc-mutant cells are enriched for transcripts that encode several secreted WNT antagonists, with Notum being the most highly expressed. Conditioned medium from Apc-mutant cells suppressed the growth of wild-type organoids in a NOTUM-dependent manner. Furthermore, NOTUM-secreting Apc-mutant clones actively inhibited the proliferation of surrounding wild-type crypt cells and drove their differentiation, thereby outcompeting crypt cells from the niche. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of NOTUM abrogated the ability of Apc-mutant cells to expand and form intestinal adenomas. We identify NOTUM as a key mediator during the early stages of mutation fixation that can be targeted to restore wild-type cell competitiveness and provide preventative strategies for people at a high risk of developing colorectal cancer. NOTUM from Apc-mutant cells acts as a key mediator during the early stages of mutation fixation and drives the formation of intestinal adenomas."
https://openalex.org/W3165305177,"The persistence of undetectable disseminated tumour cells (DTCs) after primary tumour resection poses a major challenge to effective cancer treatment1–3. These enduring dormant DTCs are seeds of future metastases, and the mechanisms that switch them from dormancy to outgrowth require definition. Because cancer dormancy provides a unique therapeutic window for preventing metastatic disease, a comprehensive understanding of the distribution, composition and dynamics of reservoirs of dormant DTCs is imperative. Here we show that different tissue-specific microenvironments restrain or allow the progression of breast cancer in the liver—a frequent site of metastasis4 that is often associated with a poor prognosis5. Using mouse models, we show that there is a selective increase in natural killer (NK) cells in the dormant milieu. Adjuvant interleukin-15-based immunotherapy ensures an abundant pool of NK cells that sustains dormancy through interferon-γ signalling, thereby preventing hepatic metastases and prolonging survival. Exit from dormancy follows a marked contraction of the NK cell compartment and the concurrent accumulation of activated hepatic stellate cells (aHSCs). Our proteomics studies on liver co-cultures implicate the aHSC-secreted chemokine CXCL12 in the induction of NK cell quiescence through its cognate receptor CXCR4. CXCL12 expression and aHSC abundance are closely correlated in patients with liver metastases. Our data identify the interplay between NK cells and aHSCs as a master switch of cancer dormancy, and suggest that therapies aimed at normalizing the NK cell pool might succeed in preventing metastatic outgrowth. Liver-resident natural killer (NK) cells sustain the dormancy of disseminated breast cancer cells, and a decrease in NK cells and increase in activated hepatic stellate cells is associated with the formation of liver metastases."

https://openalex.org/W3165269198,"Future quantum networks will enable the distribution of entanglement between distant locations and allow applications in quantum communication, quantum sensing and distributed quantum computation. At the core of this network lies the ability of generating and storing entanglement at remote, interconnected quantum nodes. While remote physical systems of various nature have been successfully entangled, none of these realisations encompassed all of the requirements for network operation, such as telecom-compatibility and multimode operation. Here we report the demonstration of heralded entanglement between two spatially separated quantum nodes, where the entanglement is stored in multimode solid-state quantum memories. At each node a praseodymium-doped crystal stores a photon of a correlated pair, with the second photon at telecommunication wavelengths. Entanglement between quantum memories placed in different labs is heralded by the detection of a telecom photon at a rate up to 1.4 kHz and is stored in the crystals for a pre-determined storage time up to 25 microseconds. We also show that the generated entanglement is robust against loss in the heralding path, and demonstrate temporally multiplexed operation, with 62 temporal modes. Our realisation is extendable to entanglement over longer distances and provides a viable route towards field-deployed, multiplexed quantum repeaters based on solid-state resources."

https://openalex.org/W3164162707,"Owing to the inevitable loss in communication channels, the distance of entanglement distribution is limited to approximately 100 kilometres on the ground1. Quantum repeaters can circumvent this problem by using quantum memory and entanglement swapping2. As the elementary link of a quantum repeater, the heralded distribution of two-party entanglement between two remote nodes has only been realized with built-in-type quantum memories3–9. These schemes suffer from the trade-off between multiplexing capacity and deterministic properties and hence hinder the development of efficient quantum repeaters. Quantum repeaters based on absorptive quantum memories can overcome such limitations because they separate the quantum memories and the quantum light sources. Here we present an experimental demonstration of heralded entanglement between absorptive quantum memories. We build two nodes separated by 3.5 metres, each containing a polarization-entangled photon-pair source and a solid-state quantum memory with bandwidth up to 1 gigahertz. A joint Bell-state measurement in the middle station heralds the successful distribution of maximally entangled states between the two quantum memories with a fidelity of 80.4 ± 2.2 per cent (±1 standard deviation). The quantum nodes and channels demonstrated here can serve as an elementary link of a quantum repeater. Moreover, the wideband absorptive quantum memories used in the nodes are compatible with deterministic entanglement sources and can simultaneously support multiplexing, which paves the way for the construction of practical solid-state quantum repeaters and high-speed quantum networks. Heralded entanglement is realized between two solid-state absorptive quantum memories 3.5 metres apart and with a bandwidth of 1 gigahertz, and with a fidelity of approximately 80%."
https://openalex.org/W3165076761,"Moiré superlattices formed by van der Waals materials can support a wide range of electronic phases, including Mott insulators1–4, superconductors5–10 and generalized Wigner crystals2. When excitons are confined by a moiré superlattice, a new class of exciton emerges, which holds promise for realizing artificial excitonic crystals and quantum optical effects11–16. When such moiré excitons are coupled to charge carriers, correlated states may arise. However, no experimental evidence exists for charge-coupled moiré exciton states, nor have their properties been predicted by theory. Here we report the optical signatures of trions coupled to the moiré potential in tungsten diselenide/molybdenum diselenide heterobilayers. The moiré trions show multiple sharp emission lines with a complex charge-density dependence, in stark contrast to the behaviour of conventional trions. We infer distinct contributions to the trion emission from radiative decay in which the remaining carrier resides in different moiré minibands. Variation of the trion features is observed in different devices and sample areas, indicating high sensitivity to sample inhomogeneity and variability. The observation of these trion features motivates further theoretical and experimental studies of higher-order electron correlation effects in moiré superlattices. Optical experiments on WSe2/MoSe2 heterobilayers reveal signatures of moiré trions, including interlayer emission with sharp lines and a complex charge-density dependence, features that differ markedly from those of conventional trions."

https://openalex.org/W3164768747,"Interactions between tumour cells and the surrounding microenvironment contribute to tumour progression, metastasis and recurrence1–3. Although mosaic analyses in Drosophila have advanced our understanding of such interactions4,5, it has been difficult to engineer parallel approaches in vertebrates. Here we present an oncogene-associated, multicolour reporter mouse model—the Red2Onco system—that allows differential tracing of mutant and wild-type cells in the same tissue. By applying this system to the small intestine, we show that oncogene-expressing mutant crypts alter the cellular organization of neighbouring wild-type crypts, thereby driving accelerated clonal drift. Crypts that express oncogenic KRAS or PI3K secrete BMP ligands that suppress local stem cell activity, while changes in PDGFRloCD81+ stromal cells induced by crypts with oncogenic PI3K alter the WNT signalling environment. Together, these results show how oncogene-driven paracrine remodelling creates a niche environment that is detrimental to the maintenance of wild-type tissue, promoting field transformation dominated by oncogenic clones. By inducing changes in surrounding tissue, mutant intestinal stem cells create an unfavourable niche environment that gives them a competitive advantage over non-mutant neighbours."
https://openalex.org/W3165259149,"AMPA receptors (AMPARs) mediate the majority of excitatory transmission in the brain and enable the synaptic plasticity that underlies learning1. A diverse array of AMPAR signalling complexes are established by receptor auxiliary subunits, which associate with the AMPAR in various combinations to modulate trafficking, gating and synaptic strength2. However, their mechanisms of action are poorly understood. Here we determine cryo-electron microscopy structures of the heteromeric GluA1–GluA2 receptor assembled with both TARP-γ8 and CNIH2, the predominant AMPAR complex in the forebrain, in both resting and active states. Two TARP-γ8 and two CNIH2 subunits insert at distinct sites beneath the ligand-binding domains of the receptor, with site-specific lipids shaping each interaction and affecting the gating regulation of the AMPARs. Activation of the receptor leads to asymmetry between GluA1 and GluA2 along the ion conduction path and an outward expansion of the channel triggers counter-rotations of both auxiliary subunit pairs, promoting the active-state conformation. In addition, both TARP-γ8 and CNIH2 pivot towards the pore exit upon activation, extending their reach for cytoplasmic receptor elements. CNIH2 achieves this through its uniquely extended M2 helix, which has transformed this endoplasmic reticulum-export factor into a powerful AMPAR modulator that is capable of providing hippocampal pyramidal neurons with their integrative synaptic properties. Analyses of AMPA receptor–auxiliary subunit complexes provide insights into the gating and modulation of the AMPA receptor by TARP-γ8 and CNIH2."
https://openalex.org/W3164377241,"Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a World Health Organization priority pathogen. CCHFV infections cause a highly lethal hemorrhagic fever for which specific treatments and vaccines are urgently needed. Here, we characterize the human immune response to natural CCHFV infection to identify potent neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nAbs) targeting the viral glycoprotein. Competition experiments showed that these nAbs bind six distinct antigenic sites in the Gc subunit. These sites were further delineated through mutagenesis and mapped onto a prefusion model of Gc. Pairwise screening identified combinations of non-competing nAbs that afford synergistic neutralization. Further enhancements in neutralization breadth and potency were attained by physically linking variable domains of synergistic nAb pairs through bispecific antibody (bsAb) engineering. Although multiple nAbs protected mice from lethal CCHFV challenge in pre- or post-exposure prophylactic settings, only a single bsAb, DVD-121-801, afforded therapeutic protection. DVD-121-801 is a promising candidate suitable for clinical development as a CCHFV therapeutic."

Thus, the vagus motor nerve communicates via genetically defined labeled lines to control functionally unique enteric neurons within discrete subregions of the gastrointestinal tract. This discovery reveals that the parasympathetic nervous system utilizes a striking division of labor to control autonomic function. Langley first coined the term “autonomic nervous system” (ANS) in 1897 to describe the nerve fibers that innervate tissues other than skeletal muscle (Langley, 1897Langley J.N. On the Regeneration of Pre-Ganglionic and of Post-Ganglionic Visceral Nerve Fibres.J. Physiol. 1897; 22: 215-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, Langley, 1921Langley J.N. The Autonomic Nervous System Part I. Cornell University Library, 1921Google Scholar). The parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) is a major component of the ANS and is often characterized as mediating the “rest and digest” response (Gibbons, 2019Gibbons C.H. Basics of autonomic nervous system function.Handb. Clin. Neurol. 2019; 160: 407-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In accordance with the “rest and digest” function of the PNS, vagal motor neurons originating from the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV) provide parasympathetic motor input to the stomach, small intestine, large intestine, gallbladder, and pancreas. These DMV neurons engage enteric neurons to regulate multiple digestive processes, including gastric contraction, relaxation, and acid secretion, pancreatic endocrine and exocrine secretions, gallbladder contraction, and intestinal motility (Rogers and Hermann, 2012Rogers R.C. Hermann G.E. Brainstem control of the gastric function.in: Johnson L.R. Gishan F.K. Kaunitz J.D. Merchant J.L. Said H.M. Wood J.D. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract.

However, the organizational principles of the DMV are unknown and it is unclear how vagal motor neurons accomplish brain control of visceral function. Are there discrete vagal neurons that target narrow domains within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and then functionally distinct enteric neurons within these narrow domains (a highly selective labeled line view), or alternatively, consistent with the widely talked about general “rest and digest” function of the PNS, do vagal motor neurons broadcast their projections broadly? Some have speculated that “labeled lines” of communication should exist to account for the varied functions carried out by the vagus (Huang et al., 1993Huang X.F. Törk I. Paxinos G.

To date, there have been no demonstrations that this “labeled line” view is true, and if true, the field has lacked any means of experimentally “accessing” such labeled lines. This gap in knowledge and the lack of tools have prevented progress in the field. Recombinase-expressing mouse lines, in which a DNA recombinase (e.g., Cre) is expressed from a targeted gene locus, can be used to genetically access specific neuron subtypes (Luo et al., 2018Luo L. Callaway E.M. Svoboda K. Genetic Dissection of Neural Circuits: A Decade of Progress.Neuron. 2018; 98: 256-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) for mapping axon projections, manipulating and measuring neuronal activity, and determining postsynaptic targets. However, this approach requires a priori knowledge of genetic markers for each neuron subtype, which does not exist for DMV neurons. In this study, we investigate the hypothesis that functionally distinct subtypes of DMV neurons express different genes and whether such knowledge provides the means for selectively accessing each subtype. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we identified seven subtypes of DMV neurons and genetic markers for each subtype. Remarkably, we found two DMV subtypes that exclusively innervate the glandular stomach and target neurochemically distinct enteric neurons. In total, our findings strongly support the “labeled line” model of communication between the DMV and the gut and provide an experimental approach for interrogating these discrete brain-to-gut circuits. We used single-nucleus RNA-seq (sNuc-seq) (Habib et al., 2016Habib N. Li Y. Heidenreich M. Swiech L. Avraham-Davidi I. Trombetta J.J. Hession C. Zhang F. Regev A.

A Cre-dependent nuclear reporter adeno-associated virus (AAV), AAV-DIO-H2b-mCherry, was injected into the brainstem of four adult male Chat-IRES-Cre mice. Tissue samples containing the DMV were dissected from the brains of these mice and used to collect H2b-mCherry+ single nuclei by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The samples were processed into cDNA libraries with Smart-Seq2 (Todd et al., 2020Todd W.D. Venner A. Anaclet C. Broadhurst R.Y. De Luca R. Bandaru S.S. Issokson L. Hablitz L.M. Cravetchi O.

Samples expressing <5,000 genes were considered low quality and excluded from further analysis. This left 306 samples with 11,231 ± 1,471 genes detected per nucleus. Clustering the samples by their gene expression profiles identified eight neuron subtypes that differed in their gene expression profiles, including marker genes (Figures 1B and 1C; Table S1). Gene expression profiles at the single cell and cluster levels can be readily visualized and further analyzed via the publicly available Broad Institute Single Cell Portal (https://singlecell.broadinstitute.org/single_cell/study/SCP1345/dmvchat-neuron2021#study-summary). Primary sequencing data FASTQ files are available both through the Single Cell Portal and at GEO (GEO: GSE172411). As expected, all clusters expressed the housekeeping gene, Actb, the neuronal marker, Tubb3, and Chat. Glial specific genes (Gfap, Olig1, Aif1, and Cspg4), on the other hand, were lowly expressed or not detected (Figure 1C). These results confirmed that the isolated samples were cholinergic neurons. We cross-referenced the top marker genes for each cluster with in situ hybridization data from the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas (Lein et al., 2007Lein E.S. Hawrylycz M.J. Ao N. Ayres M. Bensinger A. Bernard A. Boe A.F. Boguski M.S. Brockway K.S. Byrnes E.J. et al.Genome-wide atlas of gene expression in the adult mouse brain.Nature. 2007; 445: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (3498) Google Scholar). We identified one neuron cluster (cluster c1) that did not originate from the DMV. This cluster came from cholinergic neurons in the neighboring hypoglossal nucleus as it expressed Calca but not Phox2b (Pattyn et al., 1997Pattyn A. Morin X. Cremer H. Goridis C. Brunet J.F.

Pattyn A. Phox2 genes - from patterning to connectivity.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) or Adcyap1 (Figure 1D). Note that Calca is expressed in the hypoglossal nucleus, whereas Phox2b and Adcyap1 are expressed in the DMV (Allen Brain Atlas) (Lein et al., 2007Lein E.S. Hawrylycz M.J. Ao N. Ayres M. Bensinger A. Bernard A. Boe A.F. Boguski M.S. Brockway K.S. Byrnes E.J. et al.Genome-wide atlas of gene expression in the adult mouse brain.Nature. 2007; 445: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (3498) Google Scholar). The remaining seven clusters represent DMV neuron subtypes because all were positive for Phox2b and Adcyap1 but negative for Calca. We hypothesized that the molecular subtypes of DMV neurons form distinct circuits with visceral organs. To test our hypothesis, we selected marker genes for two DMV neuron subtypes (Cck for cluster c2, Pdyn for cluster c7) (Figure 1C) for further analysis. We used in situ hybridization to assess the expression of these genes in the DMV. We labeled DMV neurons with systemic injections of the retrograde tracer, fluorogold. Fluorogold is taken up by axon terminals and, when injected systemically, it efficiently labels CNS neurons that project beyond the blood-brain barrier, including vagal motor neurons (Leong and Ling, 1990Leong S.K.

Fox E.A. Berthoud H.R. Retrograde tracer technique for assessment of selective and total subdiaphragmatic vagotomies.Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: R361-R370PubMed Google Scholar). Cck and Pdyn were each expressed in a small proportion of fluorogold-labeled DMV neurons (240 Cck+ neurons and 232 Pdyn+ neurons of 2,904 fluorogold-labeled DMV neurons) (Figure 2B). Co-localization of the two markers was minimal (2 Cck+ Pdyn+ neurons of 2,904 fluorogold-labeled DMV neurons), confirming that these two genes mark separate DMV neuron subtypes. Interestingly, we observed that Cck+ and Pdyn+ DMV neurons differ in their distributions along the rostral-caudal axis of the DMV (Figure 2A). Most Cck+ DMV neurons were found in the rostral and intermediate DMV, whereas most of the Pdyn+ DMV neurons were found in the intermediate and caudal DMV (Figures 2B and 2C). These results show that Cck and Pdyn expressions mark distinct neurons located in different regions of the DMV. Given that Cck and Pdyn mark distinct populations of DMV neurons, we wondered if Cck+ and Pdyn+ DMV neurons have different axon projection profiles. We used AAVs expressing either a Cre-dependent tdTomato (AAV-FLEX-tdTomato) or a placental alkaline phosphatase (AAV-FLEX-PLAP) to map the axon projections of DMV neurons. For genetic access to Chat+ DMV neurons (i.e., all DMV cholinergic neurons) and the Cck+ and Pdyn+ DMV subtypes, we used Chat-IRES-Cre, Cck-IRES-Cre, and Pdyn-IRES-Cre knockin mice, respectively. Two-color in situ hybridization validated that Cre recombinase was expressed in the correct neurons of Cck-IRES-Cre and Pdyn-IRES-Cre mice (Figure S1). Following AAV injections into the brainstem, we observed tdTomato expression in virtually all DMV neurons in Chat-IRES-Cre mice and only a subset of DMV neurons in Cck-IRES-Cre and Pdyn-IRES-Cre mice (Figure S2). In accordance with previous studies (Rogers and Hermann, 2012Rogers R.C. Hermann G.E. Brainstem control of the gastric function.in: Johnson L.R. Gishan F.K. Kaunitz J.D. Merchant J.L. Said H.M.

Physiol. 2006; 68: 279-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), we observed that Chat+ DMV neurons innervate the entire GI tract, gallbladder, and pancreas (Figures 3A–3F). The rodent stomach is divided into two domains: (1) the nonglandular stomach, or forestomach, which has a non-secretory squamous epithelium similar to that of the esophagus and serves as a reservoir for food contents, and (2) the glandular stomach, or corpus and antrum, which has a thick muscular wall for mixing food contents and a columnar glandular epithelium for secreting acid, proteins, and hormones. Remarkably, although Chat+ DMV neurons innervate both domains of the stomach, the Cck+ and Pdyn+ DMV neurons both exclusively innervate the glandular stomach and not the nonglandular stomach (Figures 3B and 3C). Furthermore, Cck+ and Pdyn+ DMV neurons do not innervate the pancreas, gallbladder, or lower GI tract (Figures 3D–3F). Because our studies focused on the above-mentioned visceral targets of the DMV (i.e., GI tract, gallbladder, and pancreas), we cannot exclude the possibility that Cck+ or Pdyn+ DMV neurons might also send projections to a site that was not studied. In total, to our knowledge this is the first demonstration that genetically distinct DMV neuron subtypes can exclusively and selectively innervate a very specific region of a GI organ, in this case the glandular portion of the stomach. Given that the vast majority of DMV neurons release the same neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, it has been proposed that DMV neurons exert different and sometimes opposing effects (e.g., contraction versus relaxation) by engaging neurochemically distinct types of postganglionic enteric neurons (Powley et al., 2019Powley T.L.

Because the Cck+ and Pdyn+ DMV neuron subtypes both exclusively innervate the glandular stomach, we hypothesized that these two DMV neuron subtypes target different enteric neuron types. We visualized cholinergic enteric neurons using Chat-GFP mice and nitrergic enteric neurons using immunohistochemistry. Consistent with previous studies showing that enteric neurons in the stomach are either cholinergic or nitrergic (Schubert and Peura, 2008Schubert M.L. Peura D.A.

Types of neurons in the enteric nervous system.J. Auton. Nerv. Syst. 2000; 81: 87-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar), and validating our approach for visualizing the two types of enteric neurons, we found that all enteric neurons in the glandular stomach are marked by either Chat-GFP or Nos1 IHC and essentially none are marked by both (Figure S3A). Of interest, we found that Cck+ DMV neurons selectively form pericellular arborizations around cholinergic enteric neurons and avoid nitrergic enteric neurons. In striking contrast, Pdyn+ DMV neurons selectively form pericellular arborizations around nitrergic enteric neurons and avoid cholinergic enteric neurons (Figures 4A and 4B ). We also observed that Cck+ DMV neurons formed pericellular arborizations around a subset of cholinergic enteric neurons, and Pdyn+ DMV neurons formed pericellular arborization with most but not all of the nitrergic enteric neurons (Figure S3B). The DMV is the primary source of parasympathetic input to the gastrointestinal (GI) system and plays a major role in regulating multiple digestive processes, including gastric contraction, relaxation, and acid secretion, pancreatic endocrine and exocrine secretions, gallbladder contraction, and intestinal motility (Rogers and Hermann, 2012Rogers R.C. Hermann G.E. Brainstem control of the gastric function.in: Johnson L.R. Gishan F.K. Kaunitz J.D. Merchant J.L. Said H.M. Wood J.D. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract.

Although activation of the parasympathetic nervous system is typically described as promoting the general “rest and digest” response, the variety of digestive functions controlled by the DMV suggests a division of labor mediated by distinct neuron subtypes. Here, we used single-cell transcriptomics to systematically classify seven Chat+ DMV neuron subtypes by their genome-wide expression profiles. We show that expression of two genes, Cck and Pdyn, specifically marks two transcriptionally distinct DMV neuron subtypes whose somas lie in different anatomical domains of the DMV. Using respective Cre driver mice, we show that both of these DMV neuron subtypes very selectively innervate the glandular stomach and not the nonglandular stomach or any other GI organ. Finally, we show that Cck+ and Pdyn+ DMV neurons selectively form pericellular arborizations around different enteric neurons releasing functionally opposite neurotransmitters. Our studies confirm that single-cell transcriptomics is a powerful approach for elucidating highly specific lines of brain-to-gut parasympathetic communication. Of interest, it was recently shown that cholinergic sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the spinal cord, which are analogous to DMV parasympathetic preganglionic neurons, are also transcriptionally heterogenous (Blum et al., 2021Blum J.A. Klemm S. Shadrach J.L. Guttenplan K.A. Nakayama L. Kathiria A. Hoang P.T. Gautier O. Kaltschmidt J.A. Greenleaf W.J. Gitler A.D. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of the adult mouse spinal cord reveals molecular diversity of autonomic and skeletal motor neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2021; 24: 572-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Perhaps like DMV neurons, these transcriptional differences similarly predict specificity in targeting of sympathetic postganglionic neurons and hence sympathetically regulated tissues/organs. Given that most, if not all, DMV motor neurons are cholinergic, it has been proposed that DMV neurons exert different—and sometimes opposing—effects by engaging separate populations of enteric neurons (Powley et al., 2019Powley T.L. Jaffey D.M. McAdams J. Baronowsky E.A. Black D. Chesney L. Evans C. Phillips R.J. Vagal innervation of the stomach reassessed: brain-gut connectome uses smart terminals.Ann. N Y Acad.

However, direct evidence for such a “labeled-line” model has been difficult to obtain due to the lack of methods for selectively and specifically visualizing discrete DMV neuron subtypes. Using the above-mentioned approaches, we show that two subtypes of DMV neurons, Cck+ and Pdyn+, innervate the same region of the digestive system but remarkably form pericellular arborizations around neurochemically distinct enteric neurons. Specifically, Cck+ DMV neurons preferentially form pericellular arborizations around cholinergic enteric neurons whereas Pdyn+ DMV neurons do the opposite—they form pericellular arborizations around nitrergic enteric neurons (Figure 4). Because acetylcholine secreted from cholinergic enteric neurons results in gastric acid secretion and contraction, and nitric oxide released from nitrergic enteric neurons leads to gastric relaxation (Rogers and Hermann, 2012Rogers R.C. Hermann G.E. Brainstem control of the gastric function.in: Johnson L.R. Gishan F.K. Kaunitz J.D. Merchant J.L. Said H.M. Wood J.D. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract.

Hermann G.E. Browning K.N. Rogers R.C. Brainstem circuits regulating gastric function.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2006; 68: 279-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), our results are consistent with the view that separate and distinct DMV neuron subtypes, by engaging functionally unique enteric neurons, control different digestive functions. Essentially all enteric neurons in the stomach receive DMV neuron pericellular arborizations (Chang et al., 2003Chang H.Y. Mashimo H. Goyal R.K. Musings on the wanderer: what’s new in our understanding of vago-vagal reflex? IV. Current concepts of vagal efferent projections to the gut.Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest.

In this context, it is notable that Cck+ DMV neurons formed pericellular arborizations around only a subset of cholinergic enteric neurons and very few nitrergic enteric neurons, and Pdyn+ DMV neurons formed arborizations around most nitrergic enteric neurons and very few cholinergic enteric neurons (Figure S3). There are two implications of this. First, there must be additional DMV subtypes that innervate the glandular stomach to engage cholinergic enteric neurons not innervated by Cck+ or Pdyn+ DMV neurons. These other DMV neurons are likely captured in our DMV single-cell transcriptomic analysis. Second, it suggests functional diversity in cholinergic enteric neurons in that different cholinergic enteric neurons are innervated by different DMV neuron subtypes. Consistent with this, some cholinergic neurons control gastric contraction whereas others control acid"

We develop a model that allows us to investigate the importance of these factors in reducing the effective reproduction number. We show that the reduction in onward transmission during quarantine and isolation has a bigger effect than tracing coverage on the reproduction number. We also show that intuitively reasonable contact tracing performance indicators, such as the proportion of contacts quarantined before symptom onset, are often not well correlated with the reproduction number. We conclude that provision of support systems to enable people to quarantine and isolate effectively is crucial to the success of contact tracing."
https://openalex.org/W3164755064,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is often being diagnosed at an advanced stage, conferring a poor prognosis. The probability of local tumor control after radiotherapy depends on the eradication of cancer stem cells (CSCs) with activated DNA repair. This study provides evidence that the CSC-related transcription factor Oct4 contributes to HNSCC radioresistance by regulating DNA damage response and the CSC phenotype. Knockdown of Oct4 A isoform reduced self-renewal capacity in HNSCC and led to partial tumor cell radiosensitization caused by transcriptional downregulation of the cell cycle checkpoint kinases CHK1 and WEE1 and homologous recombination (HR) repair genes PSMC3IP and RAD54L. Besides, PARP inhibition with Olaparib selectively radiosensitized Oct4 A knockout, but not wild-type HNSCC cells. This finding links Oct4 A to the HR-mediated DNA repair mechanisms. In turn, knockdown of PSMC3IP and RAD54L reduced the HNSCC self-renewal capacity and clonogenic cell survival after irradiation, suggesting the interplay between DNA repair and the CSC phenotype. Similar to the effect of Oct4 knockdown, overexpression of Oct4 also resulted in significant HNSCC radiosensitization and increased DNA damage, suggesting that Oct4-dependent regulation of DNA repair depends on its fine-tuned expression. In line with this observation, HNSCC patients with high and low nuclear Oct4 expression at the invasive tumor front exhibited better loco-regional tumor control after postoperative radio(chemo)therapy compared to the intermediate expression subgroup. Thus, we found that the Oct4-driven transcriptional program plays a critical role in regulating HNSCC radioresistance, and a combination of radiotherapy with PARP inhibitors may induce synthetic lethality in Oct4-deregulated tumors."

It is not known what impact ICS cause in terms of COVID-19 positivity or disease severity in COPD. This study examined 27,810 patients with COPD from the Cleveland Clinic COVID-19 registry between March 8th and September 16th, 2020. Electronic health records were used to determine diagnosis of COPD, ICS use, and clinical outcomes. Multivariate logistic regression was used to adjust for demographics, month of COVID-19 testing, and comorbidities known to be associated with increased risk for severe COVID-19 disease. Amongst the COPD patients who were tested for COVID-19, 44.1% of those taking an ICS-containing inhaler tested positive for COVID-19 versus 47.2% who tested negative for COVID-19 (p = 0.033). Of those who tested positive for COVID-19 (n = 1288), 371 (28.8%) required hospitalization. In-hospital outcomes were not significantly different when comparing ICS versus no ICS in terms of ICU admission (36.8% [74/201] vs 31.2% [53/170], p = 0.30), endotracheal intubation (21.9% [44/201] vs 16.5% [28/170], p = 0.24), or mortality (18.4% [37/201] vs 20.0% [34/170], p = 0.80). Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated no significant differences in hospitalization (adj OR 1.12, CI: 0.90–1.38), ICU admission (adj OR: 1.31, CI: 0.82–2.10), need for mechanical ventilation (adj OR 1.65, CI: 0.69–4.02), or mortality (OR: 0.80, CI: 0.43–1.49). In conclusion, ICS therapy did not increase COVID-19 related healthcare utilization or mortality outcome in patients with COPD followed at the Cleveland Clinic health system. These findings should encourage clinicians to continue ICS therapy for COPD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3165638314,"Invasion and metastasis are the leading causes of death in patients with breast cancer (BC), and epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) plays an essential role in this process. Here, we found that Lnc-408, a novel long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), is significantly upregulated in BC cells undergoing EMT and in BC tumor with lymphatic metastases compared with those without lymphatic metastases. Lnc-408 can enhance BC invasion and metastasis by regulating the expression of LIMK1. Mechanistically, Lnc-408 serves as a sponge for miR-654-5p to relieve the suppression of miR-654-5p on its target LIMK1. Knockdown or knockout of Lnc-408 in invasive BC cells clearly decreased LIMK1 levels, and ectopic Lnc-408 in MCF-7 cells increased LIMK1 expression to promote cell invasion. Lnc-408-mediated enhancement of LIMK1 plays a key role in cytoskeletal stability and promotes invadopodium formation in BC cells via p-cofilin/F-actin. In addition, the increased LIMK1 also facilitates the expression of MMP2, ITGB1, and COL1A1 by phosphorylating CREB. In conclusion, our findings reveal that Lnc-408 promotes BC invasion and metastasis via the Lnc-408/miR-654-5p/LIMK1 axis, highlighting a novel promising target for the diagnosis and treatment of BC."

The machine learning algorithms tested included: support vector machine, random forest, multilayer perceptron, extreme gradient boosted tree, and logistic regression. The extreme gradient boosted tree algorithm outperformed the alternatives and was the machine learning method used for the final risk model. Primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes were: rehospitalization, and any of 23 adverse clinical events occurring within 30 days of the index admission date.The machine learning algorithm performance was evaluated by both the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) and Brier Score. The risk model demonstrated high performance for prediction of: 30-day mortality (AUROC = 0.88; Brier Score = 0.06), and 17 of the 23 adverse events (AUROC range: 0.80-0.86; Brier Score range: 0.01-0.05).

Sleep was monitored by actigraphy, sleep diaries and the Bergen Insomnia Scale. The stress scales used were the Relationship Satisfaction Scale, the Perceived Stress Scale and the Pre-Sleep Arousal Scale. Total white light exposure three hours prior to bedtime were also assessed.The prevalence of insomnia among the pregnant women was 38%, with a mean score on the Bergen Insomnia Scale of 11.2 (SD = 7.5). The corresponding figures in the comparing group was 51% and 12.3 (SD = 7.7). The pregnant women reported lower sleep efficiency (mean difference 3.8; 95% CI = 0.3, 7.3), longer total sleep time derived from actigraphy (mean difference 59.0 minutes; 95% CI = 23.8, 94.2) and higher exposure to evening light (mean difference 0.7; 95% CI = 0.3, 1.2), compared to the non-pregnant group.

https://openalex.org/W3164244768,"Late Jurassic deposits across Europe have yielded a rich fauna of extinct turtles. Although many of these turtles are recovered from marine deposits, it is unclear which of these taxa are habitually marine and which may be riverine species washed into nearby basins, as adaptations to open marine conditions are yet to be found. Two new fossils from the Late Jurassic of Germany provide unusually strong evidence for open marine adaptations. The first specimen is a partial shell and articulated hind limb from the Late Jurassic (early Tithonian) platy limestones of Schernfeld near Eichstätt, which preserves the integument of the hind limb as an imprint. The skin is fully covered by flat, polygonal scales, which stiffen the pes into a paddle. Although taxonomic attribution is not possible, similarities are apparent with Thalassemys. The second specimen is a large, articulated skeleton with hypertrophied limbs referable to Thalassemys bruntrutana from the Late Jurassic (early Late Kimmeridgian) platy limestone of Wattendorf, near Bamberg. Even though the skin is preserved as a phosphatic film, the scales are not preserved. This specimen can nevertheless be inferred to have had paddles stiffened by scales based on the pose in which they are preserved, the presence of epibionts between the digits, and by full morphological correspondence to the specimen from Schernfeld. An analysis of scalation in extant turtles demonstrated that elongate flippers stiffed by scales are a marine adaptation, in contrast to the elongate but flexible flippers of riverine turtles. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that Thalassemys bruntrutana is referable to the mostly Late Jurassic turtle clade Thalassochelydia. The marine adapted flippers of this taxon therefore evolved convergently with those of later clades of marine turtles. Although thalassochelydian fossils are restricted to Europe, with one notable exception from Argentina, their open marine adaptations combined with the interconnectivity of Jurassic oceans predict that the clade must have been even more wide-spread during that time."

Mental health was assessed using self-reported measures of anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9) and quality of life (single-item). Dietary intake in the prior month was assessed using a dietary screener (DSQ) and participants were asked to self-identify a diet preference (e.g., vegan).339 university undergraduate students.A principal component analysis of dietary intake found three dominant dietary patterns (plant-based, animal-based, and 'junk foods'); 28.1% (n = 95) of participants self-identified as pescatarian, vegetarian, vegan, other.

However, the mechanism mediated by hypoxia in HCC has not yet been elucidated. Here, we found multifunction scaffold protein p54nrb/NONO exerted pleiotropic effects to regulate hypoxia transcription signals, thereby enhancing the progression of liver cancer. Extensive analysis of clinical data demonstrated that NONO was significantly upregulated and represented as a poor prognostic indicator of HCC. The crucial role of NONO in driving angiogenesis and glycolysis, two well-known cancer phenotypes mediated by hypoxia, was examined in vitro an in vivo. Mechanistically, NONO interacted with and stabilized both HIF-1 and HIF-2 complexes thus activating the transcription of hypoxia-induced genes. Besides, NONO bound pre-mRNA and subsequent mRNA of these genes to facilitate them splicing and mRNA stability, respectively. Thus, NONO knockout seriously disrupted the expression of a cluster of HIF-1/2 targets and impeded hypoxia-enhanced progression in HCC. In conclusion, NONO functioned as a multipurpose scaffold that interacted with HIF-1/2 complex and their downstream transcripts to facilitate the expression of hypoxia-induced genes, allowing malignant proliferation, indicating that NONO might be a potential therapeutic target for HCC."

Accelerometer cut-points (activity counts, raw data) were derived for each of the investigated placements by linear regression using the treadmill part. Performance of the cut-points was assessed by applying the cut-points to the everyday activities. We provide cut-points for six placements and two accelerometer metrics in the specific age group. However, the derived cut-points did not outperform published ones. More research and innovative approaches are needed for improving internal and external validity of research results across populations and age groups."

https://openalex.org/W3165833311,"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are aggressive soft-tissue sarcomas that cause significant mortality in adults with neurofibromatosis type 1. We compared gene expression of growth factors in normal human nerves to MPNST and normal human Schwann cells to MPNST cell lines. We identified WNT5A as the most significantly upregulated ligand-coding gene and verified its protein expression in MPNST cell lines and tumors. In many contexts WNT5A acts as an oncogene. However, inhibiting WNT5A expression using shRNA did not alter MPNST cell proliferation, invasion, migration, or survival in vitro. Rather, shWNT5A-treated MPNST cells upregulated mRNAs associated with the remodeling of extracellular matrix and with immune cell communication. In addition, these cells secreted increased amounts of the proinflammatory cytokines CXCL1, CCL2, IL6, CXCL8, and ICAM1. Versus controls, shWNT5A-expressing MPNST cells formed larger tumors in vivo. Grafted tumors contained elevated macrophage/stromal cells, larger and more numerous blood vessels, and increased levels of Mmp9, Cxcl13, Lipocalin-1, and Ccl12. In some MPNST settings, these effects were mimicked by targeting the WNT5A receptor ROR2. These data suggest that the non-canonical Wnt ligand WNT5A inhibits MPNST tumor formation by modulating the MPNST microenvironment, so that blocking WNT5A accelerates tumor growth in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W3165392411,"Facing the pressure of environment, sustainable development is the demand of the current construction industry development. Prefabricated construction technologies has been actively promoted in China. Cost has always been one of the important factors in the development of prefabricated buildings. The hidden cost of prefabricated buildings has a great impact on the total cost of the project, and it exists in the whole process of building construction. In this paper innovatively studies the cost of prefabricated buildings from the perspective of hidden cost. In order to analysis the hidden cost of prefabricated buildings, the influencing factor index system in terms of design, management, technology, policy and environment has been established, which includes 13 factors in total. And the hidden cost analysis model has been proposed based on FISM-BN, this model combines fuzzy interpretive structure model(FISM) with Bayesian network(BN). This model can comprehensively analyze the hidden cost through the combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. And the analysis process is dynamic, not fixed at a certain point in time to analyze the cost. We can get the internal logical relationship among the influencing factors of the hidden cost, and present it in the form of intuitive chart by FISM-BN. Furthermore the model could not only predict the probability of the hidden cost of prefabricated buildings and realize in-time control through causal reasoning, but also predict the posterior probability of other influencing factors through diagnostic reasoning when the hidden cost occurs and find out the key factors that lead to the hidden cost. Then the final influencing factors are determined after one by one check. Finally, the model is demonstrated on the hidden cost analysis of prefabricated buildings the probability of recessive cost is 26%. In the analysis and control of the hidden cost of prefabricated buildings, scientific and effective decision-making and reference opinions are provided for managers."

This study aimed to assess the spatial distribution and spatial determinants of dietary consumption of foods rich in vitamin A among children aged 6-23 months in Ethiopia.Ethiopian 2016 demographic and health survey dataset using a total of 3055 children were used to conduct this study. The data were cleaned and weighed by STATA version 14.1 software and Microsoft Excel. Children who consumed foods rich in vitamin A (Egg, Meat, Vegetables, Green leafy vegetables, Fruits, Organ meat, and Fish) at least one food item in the last 24 hours were declared as good consumption. The Bernoulli model was fitted using Kuldorff's SaTScan version 9.6 software. ArcGIS version 10.7 software was used to visualize spatial distributions for poor consumption of foods rich in vitamin A. Geographical weighted regression analysis was employed using MGWR version 2.0 software. A P-value of less than 0.05 was used to declare statistically significant predictors spatially.Overall, 62% (95% CI: 60.56-64.00) of children aged 6-23 months had poor consumption of foods rich in vitamin A in Ethiopia. Poor consumption of foods rich in vitamin A highly clustered in Afar, eastern Tigray, southeast Amhara, and the eastern Somali region of Ethiopia. Spatial scan statistics identified 142 primary spatial clusters located in Afar, the eastern part of Tigray, most of Amhara and some part of the Oromia Regional State of Ethiopia. Children living in the primary cluster were 46% more likely vulnerable to poor consumption of foods rich in vitamin A than those living outside the window (RR = 1.46, LLR = 83.78, P < 0.001). Poor wealth status of the household, rural residence and living tropical area of Ethiopia were spatially significant predictors.Overall, the consumption of foods rich in vitamin A was low and spatially non-random in Ethiopia. Poor wealth status of the household, rural residence and living tropical area were spatially significant predictors for the consumption of foods rich in vitamin A in Ethiopia. Policymakers and health planners should intervene in nutrition intervention at the identified hot spot areas to reduce the poor consumption of foods rich in vitamin A among children aged 6-23 months."

However, there are limited studies on the influence of partners' characteristics on exclusive breastfeeding in Ghana. This study examined the association between partners' characteristics and exclusive breastfeeding in Ghana.This cross-sectional study used data from the 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey. Infants less than 6 months old (exclusively breastfed or not) with maternal and paternal characteristics were included in the study. A total of 180 participants were used for the study. A binary logistic regression was used to examine the influence of partners' characteristics on exclusive breastfeeding.Partners' characteristics such as education, desire for children, religion, and children ever born were associated with exclusive breastfeeding. Mothers whose partners had primary education (AOR = 0.12; CI 95%: 0.02-0.93; p = 0.04) were less likely to practice exclusive breastfeeding compared to those whose partners had no formal education. Also, mothers whose partners desired more children (AOR = 0.20; CI 95%: 0.06-0.70; p = 0.01) were less likely to practice exclusive breastfeeding compared to those whose partners desire fewer children.Improving EBF requires the involvement of partners in exclusive breastfeeding campaigns/programmes. A more couple-oriented approach is required by health practitioners to educate and counsel both mothers and partners on the importance of exclusive breastfeeding in Ghana."
https://openalex.org/W3164414554,"Tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum Gartn.) is a highly functional crop that is poised to be the target of many future breeding efforts. The reliable ex situ conservation of various genetic resources is essential for the modern breeding of tartary buckwheat varieties. We developed PCR-based co-dominant insertion/deletion (InDel) markers to discriminate tartary buckwheat genetic resources. First, we obtained the whole genome from 26 accessions across a superscaffold-scale reference genome of 569.37 Mb for tartary buckwheat cv. ""Daegwan 3-7."" Next, 171,926 homogeneous and 53,755 heterogeneous InDels were detected by comparing 26 accessions with the ""Daegwan 3-7"" reference sequence. Of these, 100 candidate InDels ranging from 5-20 bp in length were chosen for validation, and 50 of them revealed polymorphisms between the 26 accessions and ""Daegwan 3-7."" The validated InDels were further tested through the assessment of their likelihood to give rise to a single or a few PCR products in 50 other accessions, covering most tartary buckwheat genome types. The major allele frequencies ranged from 0.5616 at the TB42 locus to 0.9863 at the TB48 locus, with the average PIC value of 0.1532 with a range of 0.0267-0.3712. To create a user-friendly system, the homology of the genotypes between and among the accessions were visualized in both one- (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) barcode types by comparing amplicon polymorphisms with the reference variety, ""Daegwan 3-7."" A phylogenetic tree and population structure of the 76 accessions according to amplicon polymorphisms for the 50 InDel markers corresponded to those using non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism variants, indicating that the barcode system based on the 50 InDels was a useful tool to improve the reliability of identification of tartary buckwheat accessions in the germplasm stocks."

Measuring maternal mortality is challenging in this region, where civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems are weak or non-existent. We describe a protocol designed to explore the use of CRVS to monitor maternal mortality in Zimbabwe-an SSA country.In this study, we will collect deliveries and maternal death data from CRVS (government death registration records) and health facilities for 2007-2008 and 2018-2019 to compare MMRs and causes of death. We will code the causes of death using classifications in the maternal mortality version of the 10th revision to the international classification of diseases. We will compare the proportions of maternal deaths attributed to different causes between the two study periods. We will also analyse missingness and misclassification of maternal deaths in CRVS to assess the validity of their use to measure maternal mortality in Zimbabwe.This study will determine changes in MMR and causes of maternal mortality in Zimbabwe over a decade. It will show whether HIV, which was at its peak in 2007-2008, remains a significant cause of maternal deaths in Zimbabwe. The study will recommend measures to improve the quality of CRVS data for future use to monitor maternal mortality in Zimbabwe and other SSA countries of similar characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W3163971852,"Understanding sociodemographic, behavioral, clinical, and laboratory risk factors in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 is critically important, and requires building large and diverse COVID-19 cohorts with both retrospective information and prospective follow-up. A large Health Information Exchange (HIE) in Southeast Texas, which assembles and shares electronic health information among providers to facilitate patient care, was leveraged to identify COVID-19 patients, create a cohort, and identify risk factors for both favorable and unfavorable outcomes. The initial sample consists of 8,874 COVID-19 patients ascertained from the pandemic’s onset to June 12 th , 2020 and was created for the analyses shown here. We gathered demographic, lifestyle, laboratory, and clinical data from patient’s encounters across the healthcare system. Tobacco use history was examined as a potential risk factor for COVID-19 fatality along with age, gender, race/ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), and number of comorbidities. Of the 8,874 patients included in the cohort, 475 died from COVID-19. Of the 5,356 patients who had information on history of tobacco use, over 26% were current or former tobacco users. Multivariable logistic regression showed that the odds of COVID-19 fatality increased among those who were older (odds ratio = 1.07, 95% CI 1.06, 1.08), male (1.91, 95% CI 1.58, 2.31), and had a history of tobacco use (2.45, 95% CI 1.93, 3.11). History of tobacco use remained significantly associated (1.65, 95% CI 1.27, 2.13) with COVID-19 fatality after adjusting for age, gender, and race/ethnicity. This effort demonstrates the impact of having an HIE to rapidly identify a cohort, aggregate sociodemographic, behavioral, clinical and laboratory data across disparate healthcare providers electronic health record (HER) systems, and follow the cohort over time. These HIE capabilities enable clinical specialists and epidemiologists to conduct outcomes analyses during the current COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. Tobacco use appears to be an important risk factor for COVID-19 related death."
https://openalex.org/W3164932306,"The brassica leaf beetle Phaedon brassicae is a notorious defoliator of cruciferous vegetables. However, few molecular studies of this pest have been conducted due to limited sequence data. Recently, RNA sequencing has offered a powerful platform to generate numerous transcriptomic data, which require RT-qPCR to validate target gene expression. The selection of reliable reference genes to normalize RT-qPCR data is a prerequisite for gene expression analysis. In the present study, the expression stabilities of eight candidate reference genes under biotic conditions (development stages and various tissues) and abiotic perturbations (thermal stress and pesticide exposure) were evaluated using four different statistical algorithms. The optimal suites of reference genes were recommended for the respective experimental conditions. For tissue expression analysis, RPL32 and EF-1α were recommended as the suitable reference genes. RPL19 and TBP were the optimal reference genes across different developmental stages. RPL32 and TBP were identified as the most suitable references for thermal stress. Furthermore, RPL32 and RPL19 were ranked as the best references for insecticide exposure. This work provides a systematic exploration of the optimal reference genes for the respective experimental conditions, and our findings would facilitate molecular studies of P. brassicae."
https://openalex.org/W3165461075,"Cross-sectional studies have found some built environmental attributes to be associated with residents' lower levels of mobility (functional capacity to walk outside the home). However, less is known about what environmental attributes are related to mobility decline. This longitudinal study examined area-level associations of specific environmental attributes with mid-to-older aged adults' changes in walking mobility.Data collected from 4,088 adults (aged 46-71 years at baseline) who participated in a cohort study in Brisbane, Australia were used. The outcome was the change in self-reported mobility score (SF-36) from 2013 to 2016, which were aggregated at the neighborhood (N = 156) and suburb (N = 99) levels, due to the known lack of sensitivity in SF-36 subscales to individual changes. Linear regression analysis examined associations of mobility change with seven environmental attributes measured at baseline (residential density, intersection density, land use mix, density of walking/bike paths, park density, bus stop density, density of social incivilities), adjusting for confounding variables.Participants on average reported 4% of mobility decline during the 3-year study period. It was found that greater land use diversity was consistently associated with less decline in walking mobility, while greater density of social incivilities was associated with more decline in walking mobility. The latter finding was significant only at the neighborhood level. No consistent associations were observed for residential density, intersection density, density of walking/bike paths, park density, and bus stop density.Our findings suggest that mid-to-older aged adults who live in areas with lower land use diversity and more social incivilities may be at risk of developing mobility limitations. Recommended policies to slow residents' mobility decline and to achieve aging in place include improving these environmental attributes where needed and advising older adults to relocate to safer, mixed-use neighborhoods."

It provides an opportunity to explore the differences and similarities in stakeholder attitudes towards attraction management and reveals desired levels of participation of community in managing vandalism in tourism. This mixed method research employs community survey and interviews of site managers and government officials as its main data collection approach. It also offers an innovative approach to data analysis using the severity and optimist/pessimist psychographic variables coupled with quantitative analytical techniques. The results reveal complex relationship between psychographic profiles, future and current time dimensions, and location. In conclusion, the study offers several recommendations to city managers and policymakers on methods of vandalism control. It also highlights the importance of cultural context and its influence on community involvement. While this study is limited to tourism attractions, it provides a solid foundation for future research, one that can extend into urban planning and public policy design."
https://openalex.org/W3164386608,"Nucleotide-sugar transporters (NSTs) transport nucleotide-sugar conjugates into the Golgi lumen where they are then used in the synthesis of glycans. We previously reported crystal structures of a mammalian NST, the CMP-sialic acid transporter (CST) (Ahuja and Whorton 2019). These structures elucidated many aspects of substrate recognition, selectivity, and transport; however, one fundamental unaddressed question is how the transport activity of NSTs might be physiologically regulated as a means to produce the vast diversity of observed glycan structures. Here, we describe the discovery that an endogenous methylated form of cytidine monophosphate (m5CMP) binds and inhibits CST. The presence of m5CMP in cells results from the degradation of RNA that has had its cytosine bases post-transcriptionally methylated through epigenetic processes. Therefore, this work not only demonstrates that m5CMP represents a novel physiological regulator of CST, but it also establishes a link between epigenetic control of gene expression and regulation of glycosylation."
https://openalex.org/W3164877239,"Stereotypes and stigma associated with living on welfare or a low income can be a psychological threat that hampers performance and undermines aspirations. Our paper explores the potential of a novel self-affirmation intervention to mitigate such adverse impacts. The intervention comprises a verbal self-affirmation exercise for applicants during their first meeting with a caseworker. We conduct a cluster-randomised trial among a sample of 174 applicants for social assistance benefits in a Social Services office in Maastricht, the Netherlands. We measure outcomes on feelings of self-worth, stress, societal belonging, job search behaviour self-efficacy and cognitive performance immediately after the meeting. In our full sample, the intervention has a negative impact on feelings of societal belonging, but no effect on other outcomes. Effects, however, vary by subgroups. Our treatment increases negative feelings of self-worth and negatively affects societal belonging, but also improves cognitive performance among the group that had paid work in the previous two years. By contrast, self-affirmation positively impacts job search behaviour self-efficacy and cognitive performance for individuals who face increased challenges to (re)integrate into the labour market, proxied by lower levels of education or social assistance receipt in the previous two years. Since our intervention gives rise to testing more than one null hypothesis, we control the false discovery rate using the Benjamini-Hochberg approach. Our findings are sobering. Effects only remain significant for negative feelings of self-worth and improved cognitive performance for one particular subgroup: individuals with paid work in the past two years. This suggests self-affirmation may have reminded them of the time they still had a job, hence creating a backlash effect on feelings of self-worth. At the same time, they may have felt a need to distinguish themselves from others on social assistance benefits resulting in better cognitive performance. These interpretations are consistent with theory and empirical evidence on social identity and self-categorisation. We discuss the implications of our results and outline avenues for future work."

While there have been studies of national trends in this population, there remains a gap in studies of regional trends. Using data from the Arizona Department of Health Services Hospital Discharge Database, this study aimed to characterize the population of neonates with neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) and mothers who were opioid dependent at the time of giving birth, in Arizona. We analyzed approximately 1.2 million electronic medical records from the Arizona Department of Health Services Hospital Discharge Database to identify patterns and disparities across socioeconomic, ethnic, racial, and/or geographic groupings. In addition, we identified comorbid conditions that are differentially associated with NOWS in neonates or opioid dependence in mothers. Our analysis was designed to assess whether indicators such as race/ethnicity, insurance payer, marital status, and comorbidities are related to the use of opioids while pregnant. Our findings suggest that women and neonates who are non-Hispanic White and economically disadvantaged, tend be part of our populations of interest more frequently than expected. Additionally, women who are opioid dependent at the time of giving birth are unmarried more often than expected, and we suggest that marital status could be a proxy for support. Finally, we identified comorbidities associated with neonates who have NOWS and mothers who are opioid dependent not previously reported."
https://openalex.org/W3164015221,"Previous studies on dental anxiety have examined the psychophysiological responses evoked in dentally anxious subjects by dental-related stimuli, but not during a real-life dental examination, which was achieved in the present study.The heart rate, skin conductance level, and heart rate variability of 25 subjects with dental anxiety and 25 healthy controls were examined. Anxiety was determined by the Modified Dental Anxiety Scale and the Dental Anxiety Scale-Revised. The psychophysiological reactions of the two groups were compared during exposure to dental-related pictures, dental-related sounds, and an actual examination in a dental surgery.All the dental-related stimuli provoked an increase in heart rate, i.e. visual stimuli (p<0.001; 95% CI 0.98-3.95 bpm), auditory stimuli (p<0.001; 95% CI 1.34-4.99 bpm), and a dental examination (p<0.001; 95% CI 1.26-5.39 bpm). Dental-related pictures provoked inferior skin conductance level changes compared to dental-related sounds and the dental examination (visual modality vs auditory p<0.001; 95% CI 0.039-0.152; visual modality vs examination p<0.001; 95% CI 0.083-0.275). Heart rate variability manifested in a complex pattern of responses to the dental examination. However, when exposed to all three dental-related stimuli presentation conditions, the heart rate (F = 0.352, p = 0.556), skin conductance level (F = 0.009, p = 0.926), and heart rate variability parameters of subjects with dental anxiety did not differ in comparison to the healthy controls.This pilot study represents an evaluation of psychophysiological reactions during a real-life dental examination compared to single modality stimuli, and shows that a real-life dental examination provokes an increase in heart rate, heart rate variability and skin conductance level. Additionally, autonomic responses did not differ between the experimental and control groups. The key issue for future studies is the effect of real-life situations on the physiological and psychological state of the subjects, which should be considered when planning new research and studied in depth."
https://openalex.org/W3164455910,"We aimed to describe the epidemiology of statue attacks along with statue representativeness relative to modern day demographics in one case study country: New Zealand.We performed Internet searches for the existence of outdoor statues of named individuals and historical attacks in New Zealand (NZ), combined a national survey with field visits to all identified statues to examine for injuries and repairs.Of the 123 statues identified, nearly a quarter (n = 28, 23%) had been attacked at least once (total of 45 separate attack events), with the number of attacks increasing from the 1990s. Attacks involved paint/graffiti (14% of all statues at least once), nose removal/damage (7%), decapitation (5%), and total destruction (2%). The risk of attack was relatively higher for statues of royalty (50%), military personnel (33%), explorers (29%), and politicians (25%), compared to other reasons for fame (eg, 0% for sports players). Statue subjects involved in colonialism or direct harm to Māori (Indigenous population), had 6.61 (95%CI: 2.30 to 19.9) greater odds (adjusted odds ratio) of being attacked than other subjects. Most of the statue subjects were of men (87%) and Europeans (93%). Other ethnicities were 6% Māori (comprising 15% of the population) and 1% each for Asian and Pacific peoples, who comprise 12% and 7% of the population respectively.This national survey found an association between statue attacks and the role of statue subjects in colonialism or direct harm to the Indigenous population. Furthermore, the demography of the statue subjects may represent historical and current social power relationships-with under-representation of women and non-European ethnic groups."
https://openalex.org/W3164654383,"Mesangial C4d deposits have been associated with worse outcomes in Western patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN), but there is limited data in Asians. Previously, a high proportion of stained glomeruli was often required for the classification of C4d positive (C4d+ve). Positive staining in lower proportion of staining would be classified as C4d-ve. This retrospective study evaluated the prognostic value of C4d+ve using a less stringent definition (one C4d+ve glomerulus) in Thai patients with IgAN (n = 120). Baseline findings and outcomes were compared between those with more extensive C4d staining patterns and those with more restricted staining. Clinico-pathologic parameters and risk for kidney outcomes (kidney failure or decline GFR50%) were compared between C4d+ve versus C4d-ve, and between different patterns: Focal (< 50%) versus Diffuse (≥ 50% of glomeruli); or Global (≥ 50) versus Segmental (< 50% of mesangial area). The hazard ratios were estimated using Cox proportional hazard models for Model 1 (Oxford score+ C4d) and Model 2 (Model 1+ clinical factors). C4d+ve (n = 81) had lower eGFR, more global sclerosis, and interstitial fibrosis than C4d-ve at baseline. The 5-year kidney survival for C4d+ve was lower (53.7%) than C4d-ve (89.7%); P = 0.0255. By univariate analysis, T1, T2, C4d+ve, eGFR<60, proteinuria were predictors of kidney outcome. By multivariate analysis, proteinuria, T1, T2 and C4d+ve were independent predictors (Model 2 HR (95% CI) C4d+ve: 3.24 (1.09-9.58), p = 0.034). Segmental had lower eGFR, higher tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and segmental sclerosis compared to Global pattern. Clinicopathological parameters were not different between Focal and Diffuse patterns. Outcomes were similar between staining patterns. In conclusion, C4d staining may be a valuable marker of poor prognosis in Asian patients with IgAN. Less stringent criteria for C4d+ve should be considered as no differences in outcomes were observed between more extensive staining with less extensive patterns. More studies are needed to identify the optimum criteria for C4d+ve."
https://openalex.org/W3165634558,"The electromyographic (EMG) activity and force relationship, i.e. EMG-force relationship, is a valuable indicator of the degree of the neuromuscular activation during isometric force production. However, there is minimal information available regarding the EMG-force relationship of individual triceps brachii (TB) muscles at different elbow joint angles. This study aimed to compare the EMG-force relationships of the medial (TB-Med), lateral (TB-Lat), and long heads (TB-Long) of the TB. 7 men and 10 women performed force matching isometric tasks at 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80%maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) at 60°, 90°, and 120° of extension. During the submaximal force matching tasks, the surface EMG signals of the TB-Med, TB-Lat, and TB-Long were recorded and calculated the root mean square (RMS). RMS of each force level were then normalized by RMS at 100%MVC. For the TB-Med, ultrasonography was used to determine the superficial region of the muscle that faced the skin surface to minimize cross-talk. The joint angle was monitored using an electrogoniometer. The elbow extension force, elbow joint angle, and surface EMG signals were simultaneously sampled at 2 kHz and stored on a personal computer. The RMS did not significantly differ between the three muscles, except between the TB-Med and TB-Lat during 20%MVC at 60°. The RMS during force levels of ≥ 60%MVC at 120° was significantly lower than that at 60° or 90° for each muscle. The sum of difference, which represents the difference in RMS from the identical line, did not significantly differ in any of the assessed muscles in the present study. This suggests that a relatively smaller neuromuscular activation could be required when the elbow joint angle was extended. However, neuromuscular activation levels and relative force levels were matched in all three TB synergists when the elbow joint angle was at 90° or a more flexed position."

ADHD medications available in Japan are limited compared with those in Western countries. Prescribing status has not been sufficiently evaluated in clinical settings in Japan. This study investigated the current use of ADHD medications and characteristics of patients who received multiple ADHD medications in a clinical setting in Japan.Study participants were those who visited the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Kohnodai Hospital between April 2015 and March 2020. We investigated patients who received osmotic-controlled release oral delivery system methylphenidate, atomoxetine, or guanfacine. A retrospective case-control design was used to evaluate the characteristics of patients who received multiple ADHD medications. Patients who were given three ADHD medications were defined as the case group. Randomly sampled sex- and age-matched patients diagnosed with ADHD were defined as the control group. We compared data for child-to-parent violence, antisocial behavior, suicide attempt or self-harm, abuse history, refusal to attend school, and two psychological rating scales (the ADHD-Rating Scale and Tokyo Autistic Behavior Scale).Among the 878 patients who were prescribed any ADHD medications, 43 (4.9%) received three ADHD medications. Logistic regression revealed that children with severe ADHD symptoms, autistic characteristics, or tendency of child-to-parent violence were more likely to have been prescribed three medications during their treatment.Our findings suggest the approach to prevent the use of multiple ADHD medications. A prospective study to investigate the causality between prescribing status and clinical characteristics is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3165066620,"Several organizational factors facilitate or hinder information transfer in palliative care teams. According to past research, organizational factors that reduce information transfer include the inconsistent use of shared electronic patient files, frequent changes of healthcare staff, a lack of opportunities for personal exchange, and a lack of evaluation of collaborative processes. Insufficient information sharing between professionals can negatively impact patient safety, whereas studies have shown that some organizational factors improve collaboration between professionals and thus contribute to improved patient outcomes. The main purpose of this study is thus to investigate whether, and if so how, organizational factors contribute to successful information exchange in palliative care teams in Switzerland, while also accounting for the different care contexts of primary and specialized palliative care. A nationwide survey was aimed at medical professionals working in palliative care. In total, 379 participants (mean age = 49.8 years, SD = 10.3) were included in this study. Two main outcome variables were examined: healthcare providers' satisfaction with information transfer in their team and their overall satisfaction with communication in their team. Hypotheses were tested by employing structural equation modeling. Findings revealed that the strongest predictors for effective information transfer in palliative care teams were sufficient opportunities for face-to-face meetings and supervision alongside feedback tools to improve collaborative practices and the application of guidelines and standards for collaboration. Face-to-face meetings were an even greater contributor to information transfer in specialized settings, whereas sharing the same work-based values with colleagues was considered more important in primary settings. Results from this study contribute to the existing literature elucidating how information transfer is facilitated in the field of palliative care. If proposed measures are implemented, this could possibly improve patient outcomes in palliative care. Furthermore, the findings can be useful for healthcare organizations and associations to make more efficient resource allocation decisions with the aim to optimize information transfer within the workforce."
