https://openalex.org/W4292121737,"Abstract Realizing increasingly complex artificial intelligence (AI) functionalities directly on edge devices calls for unprecedented energy efficiency of edge hardware. Compute-in-memory (CIM) based on resistive random-access memory (RRAM) 1 promises to meet such demand by storing AI model weights in dense, analogue and non-volatile RRAM devices, and by performing AI computation directly within RRAM, thus eliminating power-hungry data movement between separate compute and memory 2–5 . Although recent studies have demonstrated in-memory matrix-vector multiplication on fully integrated RRAM-CIM hardware 6–17 , it remains a goal for a RRAM-CIM chip to simultaneously deliver high energy efficiency, versatility to support diverse models and software-comparable accuracy. Although efficiency, versatility and accuracy are all indispensable for broad adoption of the technology, the inter-related trade-offs among them cannot be addressed by isolated improvements on any single abstraction level of the design. Here, by co-optimizing across all hierarchies of the design from algorithms and architecture to circuits and devices, we present NeuRRAM—a RRAM-based CIM chip that simultaneously delivers versatility in reconfiguring CIM cores for diverse model architectures, energy efficiency that is two-times better than previous state-of-the-art RRAM-CIM chips across various computational bit-precisions, and inference accuracy comparable to software models quantized to four-bit weights across various AI tasks, including accuracy of 99.0 percent on MNIST 18 and 85.7 percent on CIFAR-10 19 image classification, 84.7-percent accuracy on Google speech command recognition 20 , and a 70-percent reduction in image-reconstruction error on a Bayesian image-recovery task."
https://openalex.org/W4292121951,"Abstract Cellular function in tissue is dependent on the local environment, requiring new methods for spatial mapping of biomolecules and cells in the tissue context 1 . The emergence of spatial transcriptomics has enabled genome-scale gene expression mapping 2–5 , but the ability to capture spatial epigenetic information of tissue at the cellular level and genome scale is lacking. Here we describe a method for spatially resolved chromatin accessibility profiling of tissue sections using next-generation sequencing (spatial-ATAC-seq) by combining in situ Tn5 transposition chemistry 6 and microfluidic deterministic barcoding 5 . Profiling mouse embryos using spatial-ATAC-seq delineated tissue-region-specific epigenetic landscapes and identified gene regulators involved in the development of the central nervous system. Mapping the accessible genome in the mouse and human brain revealed the intricate arealization of brain regions. Applying spatial-ATAC-seq to tonsil tissue resolved the spatially distinct organization of immune cell types and states in lymphoid follicles and extrafollicular zones. This technology progresses spatial biology by enabling spatially resolved chromatin accessibility profiling to improve our understanding of cell identity, cell state and cell fate decision in relation to epigenetic underpinnings in development and disease."
https://openalex.org/W4292121795,"Single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq) has greatly advanced our ability to characterize cellular heterogeneity1. However, scRNA-seq requires lysing cells, which impedes further molecular or functional analyses on the same cells. Here, we established Live-seq, a single-cell transcriptome profiling approach that preserves cell viability during RNA extraction using fluidic force microscopy2,3, thus allowing to couple a cell's ground-state transcriptome to its downstream molecular or phenotypic behaviour. To benchmark Live-seq, we used cell growth, functional responses and whole-cell transcriptome read-outs to demonstrate that Live-seq can accurately stratify diverse cell types and states without inducing major cellular perturbations. As a proof of concept, we show that Live-seq can be used to directly map a cell's trajectory by sequentially profiling the transcriptomes of individual macrophages before and after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, and of adipose stromal cells pre- and post-differentiation. In addition, we demonstrate that Live-seq can function as a transcriptomic recorder by preregistering the transcriptomes of individual macrophages that were subsequently monitored by time-lapse imaging after LPS exposure. This enabled the unsupervised, genome-wide ranking of genes on the basis of their ability to affect macrophage LPS response heterogeneity, revealing basal Nfkbia expression level and cell cycle state as important phenotypic determinants, which we experimentally validated. Thus, Live-seq can address a broad range of biological questions by transforming scRNA-seq from an end-point to a temporal analysis approach."
https://openalex.org/W4292121984,"Photoelectrochemical (PEC) artificial leaves hold the potential to lower the costs of sustainable solar fuel production by integrating light harvesting and catalysis within one compact device. However, current deposition techniques limit their scalability1, whereas fragile and heavy bulk materials can affect their transport and deployment. Here we demonstrate the fabrication of lightweight artificial leaves by employing thin, flexible substrates and carbonaceous protection layers. Lead halide perovskite photocathodes deposited onto indium tin oxide-coated polyethylene terephthalate achieved an activity of 4,266 µmol H2 g-1 h-1 using a platinum catalyst, whereas photocathodes with a molecular Co catalyst for CO2 reduction attained a high CO:H2 selectivity of 7.2 under lower (0.1 sun) irradiation. The corresponding lightweight perovskite-BiVO4 PEC devices showed unassisted solar-to-fuel efficiencies of 0.58% (H2) and 0.053% (CO), respectively. Their potential for scalability is demonstrated by 100 cm2 stand-alone artificial leaves, which sustained a comparable performance and stability (of approximately 24 h) to their 1.7 cm2 counterparts. Bubbles formed under operation further enabled 30-100 mg cm-2 devices to float, while lightweight reactors facilitated gas collection during outdoor testing on a river. This leaf-like PEC device bridges the gulf in weight between traditional solar fuel approaches, showcasing activities per gram comparable to those of photocatalytic suspensions and plant leaves. The presented lightweight, floating systems may enable open-water applications, thus avoiding competition with land use."
https://openalex.org/W4292122046,"Abstract Although p53 inactivation promotes genomic instability 1 and presents a route to malignancy for more than half of all human cancers 2,3 , the patterns through which heterogenous TP53 (encoding human p53) mutant genomes emerge and influence tumorigenesis remain poorly understood. Here, in a mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma that reports sporadic p53 loss of heterozygosity before cancer onset, we find that malignant properties enabled by p53 inactivation are acquired through a predictable pattern of genome evolution. Single-cell sequencing and in situ genotyping of cells from the point of p53 inactivation through progression to frank cancer reveal that this deterministic behaviour involves four sequential phases— Trp53 (encoding mouse p53) loss of heterozygosity, accumulation of deletions, genome doubling, and the emergence of gains and amplifications—each associated with specific histological stages across the premalignant and malignant spectrum. Despite rampant heterogeneity, the deletion events that follow p53 inactivation target functionally relevant pathways that can shape genomic evolution and remain fixed as homogenous events in diverse malignant populations. Thus, loss of p53—the ‘guardian of the genome’—is not merely a gateway to genetic chaos but, rather, can enable deterministic patterns of genome evolution that may point to new strategies for the treatment of TP53- mutant tumours."
https://openalex.org/W4292121925,"CD8+ T cells that respond to chronic viral infections or cancer are characterized by the expression of inhibitory receptors such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and by the impaired production of cytokines. This state of restrained functionality-which is referred to as T cell exhaustion1,2-is maintained by precursors of exhausted T (TPEX) cells that express the transcription factor T cell factor 1 (TCF1), self-renew and give rise to TCF1- exhausted effector T cells3-6. Here we show that the long-term proliferative potential, multipotency and repopulation capacity of exhausted T cells during chronic infection are selectively preserved in a small population of transcriptionally distinct CD62L+ TPEX cells. The transcription factor MYB is not only essential for the development of CD62L+ TPEX cells and maintenance of the antiviral CD8+ T cell response, but also induces functional exhaustion and thereby prevents lethal immunopathology. Furthermore, the proliferative burst in response to PD-1 checkpoint inhibition originates exclusively from CD62L+ TPEX cells and depends on MYB. Our findings identify CD62L+ TPEX cells as a stem-like population that is central to the maintenance of long-term antiviral immunity and responsiveness to immunotherapy. Moreover, they show that MYB is a transcriptional orchestrator of two fundamental aspects of exhausted T cell responses: the downregulation of effector function and the long-term preservation of self-renewal capacity."
https://openalex.org/W4292121948,"Cellular RNAs are heterogeneous with respect to their alternative processing and secondary structures, but the functional importance of this complexity is still poorly understood. A set of alternatively processed antisense non-coding transcripts, which are collectively called COOLAIR, are generated at the Arabidopsis floral-repressor locus FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC)1. Different isoforms of COOLAIR influence FLC transcriptional output in warm and cold conditions2-7. Here, to further investigate the function of COOLAIR, we developed an RNA structure-profiling method to determine the in vivo structure of single RNA molecules rather than the RNA population average. This revealed that individual isoforms of the COOLAIR transcript adopt multiple structures with different conformational dynamics. The major distally polyadenylated COOLAIR isoform in warm conditions adopts three predominant structural conformations, the proportions and conformations of which change after cold exposure. An alternatively spliced, strongly cold-upregulated distal COOLAIR isoform6 shows high structural diversity, in contrast to proximally polyadenylated COOLAIR. A hyper-variable COOLAIR structural element was identified that was complementary to the FLC transcription start site. Mutations altering the structure of this region changed FLC expression and flowering time, consistent with an important regulatory role of the COOLAIR structure in FLC transcription. Our work demonstrates that isoforms of non-coding RNA transcripts adopt multiple distinct and functionally relevant structural conformations, which change in abundance and shape in response to external conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4292121961,"Moir\'e superlattices in atomically thin van-der-Waals heterostructures hold great promise for an extended control of electronic and valleytronic lifetimes, the confinement of excitons in artificial moir\'e lattices, and the formation of novel exotic quantum phases. Such moir\'e-induced emergent phenomena are particularly strong for interlayer excitons, where the hole and the electron are localized in different layers of the heterostructure. In order to exploit the full potential of correlated moir\'e and exciton physics, a thorough understanding of the ultrafast interlayer exciton formation process and the real-space wavefunction confinement in the moir\'e potential is indispensable. However, direct experimental access to these parameters is limited since most excitonic quasiparticles are optically dark. Here we show that femtosecond photoemission momentum microscopy provides quantitative access to these key properties of the moir\'e interlayer excitons. We find that interlayer excitons are dominantly formed on the sub-50~fs timescale via interlayer tunneling at the K valleys of the Brillouin zones. In addition, we directly measure energy-momentum fingerprints of the moir\'e interlayer excitons by mapping their spectral signatures within the mini Brillouin zone that is built up by the twisted heterostructure. From these momentum-fingerprints, we gain quantitative access to the modulation of the exciton wavefunction within the moir\'e potential in real-space. Our work provides the first direct access to the interlayer moir\'e exciton formation dynamics in space and time and reveals new opportunities to study correlated moir\'e and exciton physics for the future realization of exotic quantum phases of matter."
https://openalex.org/W4292104010,"Abstract The theory of the strong force, quantum chromodynamics, describes the proton in terms of quarks and gluons. The proton is a state of two up quarks and one down quark bound by gluons, but quantum theory predicts that in addition there is an infinite number of quark–antiquark pairs. Both light and heavy quarks, whose mass is respectively smaller or bigger than the mass of the proton, are revealed inside the proton in high-energy collisions. However, it is unclear whether heavy quarks also exist as a part of the proton wavefunction, which is determined by non-perturbative dynamics and accordingly unknown: so-called intrinsic heavy quarks 1 . It has been argued for a long time that the proton could have a sizable intrinsic component of the lightest heavy quark, the charm quark. Innumerable efforts to establish intrinsic charm in the proton 2 have remained inconclusive. Here we provide evidence for intrinsic charm by exploiting a high-precision determination of the quark–gluon content of the nucleon 3 based on machine learning and a large experimental dataset. We disentangle the intrinsic charm component from charm–anticharm pairs arising from high-energy radiation 4 . We establish the existence of intrinsic charm at the 3-standard-deviation level, with a momentum distribution in remarkable agreement with model predictions 1,5 .We confirm these findings by comparing them to very recent data on Z -boson production with charm jets from the Large Hadron Collider beauty (LHCb) experiment 6 ."
https://openalex.org/W4292121761,"Rabi oscillations are periodic modulations of populations in two-level systems interacting with a time-varying field. They are ubiquitous in physics with applications in different areas such as photonics, nano-electronics, electron microscopy, and quantum information. While the theory developed by Rabi was intended for fermions in gyrating magnetic fields, Autler and Townes realized that it could also be used to describe coherent light-matter interaction within the rotating wave approximation\cite. Although intense nanometer-wavelength light-sources have been available for more than a decade, Rabi dynamics at such short wavelengths have not been observed directly. Here we show that femtosecond extreme-ultraviolet pulses from a seeded free-electron laser can drive Rabi oscillations between the ground state and an excited state in helium atoms. The measured photoemission signal revealed an Autler-Townes doublet as well as an avoided crossing, phenomena that are both trademarks of quantum optics. Using theoretical analyses that go beyond the strong-field approximation, we found that the ultrafast build-up of the doublet structure follows from a quantum interference effect between resonant and non-resonant photoionization pathways. Given the recent availability of intense attosecond and few-femtosecond extreme-ultraviolet pulses, our results offer opportunities to carry out ultrafast manipulation of coherent processes at short wavelengths using free-electron lasers."
https://openalex.org/W4292121953,"Compelling evidence shows that brown and beige adipose tissue are protective against metabolic diseases1,2. PR domain-containing 16 (PRDM16) is a dominant activator of the biogenesis of beige adipocytes by forming a complex with transcriptional and epigenetic factors and is therefore an attractive target for improving metabolic health3-8. However, a lack of knowledge surrounding the regulation of PRDM16 protein expression hampered us from selectively targeting this transcriptional pathway. Here we identify CUL2-APPBP2 as the ubiquitin E3 ligase that determines PRDM16 protein stability by catalysing its polyubiquitination. Inhibition of CUL2-APPBP2 sufficiently extended the half-life of PRDM16 protein and promoted beige adipocyte biogenesis. By contrast, elevated CUL2-APPBP2 expression was found in aged adipose tissues and repressed adipocyte thermogenesis by degrading PRDM16 protein. Importantly, extended PRDM16 protein stability by adipocyte-specific deletion of CUL2-APPBP2 counteracted diet-induced obesity, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia in mice. These results offer a cell-autonomous route to selectively activate the PRDM16 pathway in adipose tissues."

https://openalex.org/W4292121800,"Abstract A key event at the onset of development is the activation of a contractile actomyosin cortex during the oocyte-to-embryo transition 1–3 . Here we report on the discovery that, in Caenorhabditis elegans oocytes, actomyosin cortex activation is supported by the emergence of thousands of short-lived protein condensates rich in F-actin, N-WASP and the ARP2/3 complex 4–8 that form an active micro-emulsion. A phase portrait analysis of the dynamics of individual cortical condensates reveals that condensates initially grow and then transition to disassembly before dissolving completely. We find that, in contrast to condensate growth through diffusion 9 , the growth dynamics of cortical condensates are chemically driven. Notably, the associated chemical reactions obey mass action kinetics that govern both composition and size. We suggest that the resultant condensate dynamic instability 10 suppresses coarsening of the active micro-emulsion 11 , ensures reaction kinetics that are independent of condensate size and prevents runaway F-actin nucleation during the formation of the first cortical actin meshwork."
https://openalex.org/W4292122029,"Neurons are highly polarized cells that face the fundamental challenge of compartmentalizing a vast and diverse repertoire of proteins in order to function properly1. The axon initial segment (AIS) is a specialized domain that separates a neuron's morphologically, biochemically and functionally distinct axon and dendrite compartments2,3. How the AIS maintains polarity between these compartments is not fully understood. Here we find that in Caenorhabditis elegans, mouse, rat and human neurons, dendritically and axonally polarized transmembrane proteins are recognized by endocytic machinery in the AIS, robustly endocytosed and targeted to late endosomes for degradation. Forcing receptor interaction with the AIS master organizer, ankyrinG, antagonizes receptor endocytosis in the AIS, causes receptor accumulation in the AIS, and leads to polarity deficits with subsequent morphological and behavioural defects. Therefore, endocytic removal of polarized receptors that diffuse into the AIS serves as a membrane-clearance mechanism that is likely to work in conjunction with the known AIS diffusion-barrier mechanism to maintain neuronal polarity on the plasma membrane. Our results reveal a conserved endocytic clearance mechanism in the AIS to maintain neuronal polarity by reinforcing axonal and dendritic compartment membrane boundaries."
https://openalex.org/W4292121771,"The mammalian immune system uses various pattern recognition receptors to recognize invaders and host damage and transmits this information to downstream immunometabolic signalling outcomes. Laccase domain-containing 1 (LACC1) protein is an enzyme highly expressed in inflammatory macrophages and serves a central regulatory role in multiple inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases, arthritis and clearance of microbial infection1–4. However, the biochemical roles required for LACC1 functions remain largely undefined. Here we elucidated a shared biochemical function of LACC1 in mice and humans, converting l-citrulline to l-ornithine (l-Orn) and isocyanic acid and serving as a bridge between proinflammatory nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) and polyamine immunometabolism. We validated the genetic and mechanistic connections among NOS2, LACC1 and ornithine decarboxylase 1 (ODC1) in mouse models and bone marrow-derived macrophages infected by Salmonella enterica Typhimurium. Strikingly, LACC1 phenotypes required upstream NOS2 and downstream ODC1, and Lacc1–/– chemical complementation with its product l-Orn significantly restored wild-type activities. Our findings illuminate a previously unidentified pathway in inflammatory macrophages, explain why its deficiency may contribute to human inflammatory diseases and suggest that l-Orn could serve as a nutraceutical to ameliorate LACC1-associated immunological dysfunctions such as arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease. Findings suggest that l-ornithine could serve as a novel nutraceutical to ameliorate LACC1-associated immunological dysfunctions."
https://openalex.org/W4292121694,"Pumps are transport mechanisms in which direct currents result from a cyclic evolution of the potential. As Thouless has shown, the pumping process can have topological origins, when considering the motion of quantum particles in spatially and temporally periodic potentials. However, the periodic evolution that drives these pumps has always been assumed to be imparted from outside, as was the case in the experimental systems studied so far. Here we report on an emergent mechanism for pumping in a quantum gas coupled to an optical resonator, where we observe a particle current without applying a periodic drive. The pumping potential experienced by the atoms is formed by the self-consistent cavity field interfering with the static laser field driving the atoms. Due to dissipation, the cavity field evolves between its two quadratures, each corresponding to a different centrosymmetric crystal configuration. This self-oscillation results in a time-periodic potential analogous to that describing the transport of electrons in topological tight-binding models, like the paradigmatic Rice-Mele pump. In the experiment, we directly follow the evolution by measuring the phase winding of the cavity field with respect to the driving field and observing the atomic motion in-situ. The discovered mechanism combines the dynamics of topological and open systems, and features characteristics of continuous dissipative time crystals."

https://openalex.org/W4292677277,"Face masks are used to protect the wearer from harmful external air and to prevent transmission of viruses from air exhaled by potentially infected wearers to the surrounding people. In this study, we examined the potential utility of masks for collecting viruses contained in exhaled breath and detected the collected viruses via various molecular tests. Using KF94 masks, the inner electrostatic filter was selected for virus collection, and an RNA extraction protocol was developed for the face mask. Virus detection in worn mask samples was performed using PCR and rolling circle amplification (RCA) tests and four different target genes (N, E, RdRp, and ORF1ab genes). The present study confirmed that the mask sample tests showed positive SARS-CoV-2 results, similar to the PCR tests using nasopharyngeal swab samples. In addition, the quantity of nucleic acid collected in the masks linearly increased with wearing time. These results suggest that samples for SARS-CoV-2 tests can be collected in a noninvasive, quick, and easy method by simply submitting worn masks from subjects, which can significantly reduce the hassle of waiting at airports or public places and concerns about cross-infection. In addition, it is expected that miniaturization technology will integrate PCR assays on face masks in the near future, and mask-based self-diagnosis would play a significant role in resolving the pandemic situation."
https://openalex.org/W4293066195,"Although COVID-19 vaccines are available, evidence suggests that several factors hinder or facilitate their use. Several studies have found gender differences in COVID-19 vaccine uptake, with women less likely to vaccinate than men in many countries, including Ghana. These studies, however, have primarily been quantitative. This study used a qualitative approach to examine the facilitators and barriers to vaccine uptake among women in Ghana. Using a cross-sectional descriptive qualitative research design, 30 women in the Greater Accra and Ashanti regions of Ghana were conveniently sampled and interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide. Fifteen (15) interviews were conducted in each region. The data were transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically using QSR NVivo version 10 software. Among the key factors that facilitate COVID-19 vaccination are the desire to protect oneself and family against COVID-19, education about COVID-19 vaccines, seeing others receive the COVID-19 vaccine, and vaccine being cost-free. On the other hand, long queues at the vaccination centres, fear of side effects, misconceptions about the vaccines, and shortage of vaccines were the main barriers against COVID-19 vaccination. The study results show that individual, institutional, and vaccine-related factors facilitate or hinder COVID-19 vaccination among women. Addressing these factors need continuous comprehensive health education, and ensuring vaccine availability at vaccination sites will improve women’s uptake of the COVID-19 vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W4293067840,"The timing of initiation of first antenatal care visit is paramount for ensuring optimal care and health outcomes for women and children. However, the existing evidence from developing countries, including Ethiopia, indicates that most pregnant women are attending antenatal care in late pregnancy. Thus, this study was aimed to assess timely initiation of antenatal care and associated factors among pregnant women attending antenatal care services in Southwest Ethiopia.Institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted among 375 pregnant women from April 15 to June 15, 2019 in Southwest Ethiopia. A structured and pre-tested face-to-face interviewer-administered questionnaire technique was used to collect data. Systematic random sampling technique was employed to recruit pregnant women. The data were entered into Epi data version 4.4.2 and analyzed using SPSS version 25. Frequency tables, charts and measures of central tendency were used to describe the data. The effect of each variable on timely initiation of antenatal care was assessed using bi-variable logistic regression. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with timely initiation of antenatal care. The adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence interval and p<0.05 was used to identify factors associated with timely initiation of antenatal care.The study revealed that 41.9% of pregnant women started antenatal care timely. Pregnant women who had good knowledge of timely initiation of antenatal care (AOR = 3.8, 95% CI: 2.2-6.5), planned to be pregnant (AOR = 5.1, 95% CI: 2.9-8.9), being primigravida (AOR = 2.6, 95% CI: 1.4-4.7) and confirmed their pregnancy by urine test (AOR = 4.1, 95% CI: 2.4-6.9) were found to be significant predictors for timely initiation of antenatal care.Despite the efforts made to make ANC visit services freely available, timely initiation of antenatal care among pregnant women in the study area was low. Pregnant women who had good knowledge of timely initiation of antenatal care, planned to be pregnant, being primigravida and confirmed pregnancy by urine test were found to be significant predictors for timely initiation of antenatal care. Therefore, efforts that strengthen awareness on antenatal care and its right time of commencement, increase pregnant women's knowledge of timing of antenatal care services and reducing unplanned pregnancies should be organized."
https://openalex.org/W4292117699,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a complex, multifactorial disease driven by a dysregulated immune response against host commensal microbes. Despite rapid advances in our understanding of host genomics and transcriptomics, the metabolic changes in UC remain poorly understood. We thus sought to investigate distinguishing metabolic features of the UC colon (14 controls and 19 patients). Metabolomics analyses revealed inflammation state as the primary driver of metabolic variation rather than diagnosis, with multiple metabolites differentially regulated between inflamed and uninflamed tissues. Specifically, inflamed tissues were characterized by reduced levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and enhanced levels of nicotinamide (NAM) and adenosine diphosphate ribose (ADPr). The NAD+/NAM ratio, which was reduced in inflamed patients, served as an effective classifier for inflammation in UC. Mitochondria were also structurally altered in UC, with UC patient colonocytes displaying reduced mitochondrial density and number. Together, these findings suggest a link between mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and NAD+ metabolism in UC."
https://openalex.org/W4292213002,"Vascular calcification is very common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), but so far, there is no effective treatment. Dendrobium officinale polysaccharide (DOP), a natural component of Chinese herbal medicine, has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activity. Inflammation and apoptosis play an essential role in the progression of vascular calcification. However, the exact role and molecular mechanisms of DOP in vascular calcification remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of DOP on vascular calcification using vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), arterial rings, and CKD rats. Alizarin red staining and gene expression analysis revealed that DOP inhibited calcification and osteogenic differentiation of rat VSMCs in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, ex vivo studies revealed that DOP inhibited the calcification of rat arterial rings. Furthermore, the administration of DOP alleviated vascular calcification in CKD rats. Moreover, DOP treatment suppressed VSMC inflammation and apoptosis. Finally, DOP treatment upregulated mRNA and protein levels of heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX-1); both pharmacological inhibition of HMOX-1 by the HMOX-1 inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin-9ZnPP9 and knockdown of HMOX-1 by siRNA markedly abrogated the suppression of inflammation and osteogenic differentiation of VSMCs by DOP. Collectively, these results suggest that DOP alleviates vascular calcification in CKD by suppressing apoptosis and inflammation via HMOX-1 activation. These results may provide a promising treatment for vascular calcification in CKD."

Digital mental health services that offer personalized care recommendations hold promise to efficiently expand service, but evidence of the effectiveness of digitally delivered mental health care in real-world settings remains limited.A retrospective cohort of adults (N = 1,852) receiving care through a digital mental health platform with elevated depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic was analyzed to estimate changes in subjective well-being and clinical improvement in depressive symptoms (using the World Health Organization-Five [WHO-5] Well-Being Index), as well as compare the relative effectiveness and cost of different care utilization patterns.The average improvement in WHO-5 score was 10.1 points (CI: 9.3-10.9, p<0.001) at follow-up, which constituted a medium effect size (d = 0.73). The odds of clinical improvement in depressive symptoms were significantly greater among those who utilized telecoaching (aOR = 2.45, 95%CI: 1.91-3.15, p < .001), teletherapy (aOR = 2.01, 95%CI: 1.57-2.57, p < .001), and both services (aOR = 2.28, 95%CI: 1.67-3.11, p < .001) compared to those who only utilized assessments, adjusting for baseline WHO-5 score, age, sex, and number of days between baseline and follow-up assessments. The average estimated cost of care for telecoaching was $124 per individual, which was significantly less than teletherapy ($413) or both services ($559).Digitally delivered care with a therapist and/or coach was effective in improving subjective well-being and clinical improvement in depressive symptoms. Although clinical outcomes were similar across utilization patterns, the cost of care was lowest among those utilizing telecoaching."

https://openalex.org/W4293065798,"Background Fifteen percent of US adults have chronic kidney disease (CKD). The effect of CKD on the development of different malignancies is unknown. Understanding the effect of CKD on the risk of development of cancer could have important implications for screening and early detection of cancer in these patients. Methods Adult CKD patients [estimated GFR (eGFR) &lt;60ml/min/1.73m 2 ] between January 2001 and December 2020 were identified in this single institution study. Patients were divided into four stages of CKD by eGFR. The incidence of cancer and time to development of the first cancer were identified. Multivariable models were used to compare the overall cancer incidence while considering death as a competing risk event and adjusting for relevant covariates (sex, race, diabetes, hypertension, CAD, smoking or not, BMI, and CKD stages). Separate multivariable models of the incidence of cancers were conducted in each age group. Multivariable Cox models were used to fit the overall death adjusting for relevant covariates. Patients were censored at the conclusion of the study period (December 31, 2020). Statistical analysis was performed with SAS software (version 9.4). Results Of the 13,750 patients with a diagnosis of CKD in this cohort, 2,758 (20.1%) developed a malignancy. The median time to development of cancer following a diagnosis of CKD was 8.5 years. Factors associated with the risk of developing cancer in CKD patients included increasing age, male sex and worsening chronic kidney disease, while diabetes was associated with a lower risk of malignancy. On multivariate analysis, the factors associated with increased mortality in patients who developed cancer included increasing age, diabetes and lower eGFR. Conclusion CKD is an increased risk factor for the development of various malignancies. Age appropriate cancer screening should be aggressively pursued in those with progressive CKD."
https://openalex.org/W4292121810,"The early history of deuterostomes, the group composed of the chordates, echinoderms and hemichordates1, is still controversial, not least because of a paucity of stem representatives of these clades2-5. The early Cambrian microscopic animal Saccorhytus coronarius was interpreted as an early deuterostome on the basis of purported pharyngeal openings, providing evidence for a meiofaunal ancestry6 and an explanation for the temporal mismatch between palaeontological and molecular clock timescales of animal evolution6-8. Here we report new material of S. coronarius, which is reconstructed as a millimetric and ellipsoidal meiobenthic animal with spinose armour and a terminal mouth but no anus. Purported pharyngeal openings in support of the deuterostome hypothesis6 are shown to be taphonomic artefacts. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that S. coronarius belongs to total-group Ecdysozoa, expanding the morphological disparity and ecological diversity of early Cambrian ecdysozoans."

While a few studies have attempted to address smog crises effects on human health in that geographic region, research in this regard is still in its infancy. We exploited a unique situation based on two factors: large pollutant concentration variations due to the Chiang Mai smog crises and a relatively large sample of out-patient visits. About 216,000 out-patient visits in the area of Chiang Mai during the period of 2011 to 2014 for upper (J30-J39) and lower (J44) respiratory tract diseases were evaluated with respect to associations with particulate matter (PM 10 ), ozone (O 3 ), and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) concentrations using single-pollutant and multiple-pollutants Poisson regression models. All three pollutants were found to be associated with visits due to upper respiratory tract diseases (with relative risks RR = 1.023 at cumulative lag 05, 95% CI: 1.021–1.025, per 10 μg/m 3 PM 10 increase, RR = 1.123 at lag 05, 95% CI: 1.118–1.129, per 10 ppb O 3 increase, and RR = 1.110 at lag 05, 95% CI: 1.102–1.119, per 10 ppb NO 2 increase). Likewise, all three pollutants were found to be associated with visits due to lower respiratory tract diseases (with RR = 1.016 at lag 06, 95% CI: 1.015–1.017, per 10 μg/m 3 PM 10 increase, RR = 1.073 at lag 06, 95% CI: 1.070–1.076, per 10 ppb O 3 increase, and RR = 1.046 at lag 06, 95% CI: 1.040–1.051, per 10 ppb NO 2 increase). Multi-pollutants modeling analysis identified O 3 as a relatively independent risk factor and PM 10 -NO 2 pollutants models as promising two-pollutants models. Overall, these results demonstrate the adverse effects of all three air pollutants on respiratory morbidity and call for air pollution reduction and control."

https://openalex.org/W4292680502,"Given the ever-shorter length of hospital stay after surgical procedures, nowadays it is more important than ever to study interventions that may have an impact on surgical patients' wellbeing. According to the ERAS (Enhanced Recovery After Surgery protocols) program, early feeding must be considered one of the key components to facilitate early recovery while improving outcomes and patients' overall experiences. To date, the international literature has reported that early postoperative feeding compared with traditional (or late) timing is safe; nevertheless, small clinical outcomes effects has been reported, also for recovery of gastrointestinal function. Therefore, the effectiveness of early postoperative feeding to reduce postoperative ileus duration remains still debated.To analyse the effects of early versus delayed oral feeding (liquids and food) on the recovery of intestinal motility after gastrointestinal surgery.Pubmed, Embase, Cinahl, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the ClincalTrials.gov register will be searched to identify the RCTs of interest.Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing the effect of early postoperative versus late oral feeding on major postoperative outcomes after gastrointestinal surgery will be included.Two review authors will independently screen titles and abstracts to determine the initially selected studies' inclusion. Any disagreements will be resolved through discussion and consulting a third review author. The research team members will then proceed with the methodological evaluation of the studies and their eligibility for inclusion in the systematic review."
https://openalex.org/W4292682533,"Although closed-note exams have traditionally been used to evaluate students in undergraduate biology classes, open-note exams are becoming increasingly common, though little is known about how students prepare for these types of exams. We investigated student perceptions of and their preparation habits for online open-note exams in an undergraduate biology class, as compared to their previous experiences with closed-note exams in other classes. Specifically, we explored the following research questions: (1a) How do students perceive open-note exams impact their exam scores, their anxiety, the amount they studied, and the amount their peers studied? (1b) How do these perceptions impact performance outcomes? (2a) How do students prepare for open-note exams? (2b) How do these preparation methods impact performance outcomes? Results demonstrate students perceived increased exam scores, decreased exam-anxiety, decreased study time spent personally, and decreased study time spent by their peers for open-note exams, as compared to past experiences with closed-note exams. Open-ended survey responses analyzed through first- and second-cycle analyses showed students adapted their study habits by focusing on note preparation and broad conceptual understanding rather than rote memorization. Using linear mixed effects models to assess student performance, we found students who focused on understanding, note preparation and using external resources outperformed students who did not report those study habits. As institutions shift towards flexible and scalable assessments that can be used in face-to-face or online environments, the use of open-note exams can promote effective study habits and reward higher-order thinking with intentional guidance from the instructor."
https://openalex.org/W4293066109,"In competitive settings, firms locate their facilities according to customers' behavior to maximize their market share. A common behavior is consuming from different motivations: one is for convenient demand, and the other is for quality demand. In this behavioral pattern, consumers patronize facilities within convenience for some demands, and patronize high quality facilities beyond convenience range for other demands. This behavior has never been included in competitive facility location problems. Given several other companies' facilities in the market offering similar products or services, we study how a new entrant company can locate facilities based on this customer behavior to maximize its market share. A two-level robust model for the new entrant company is proposed to locate its facilities by taking into account the uncertainty of the types of customers' demands. For medium size problems, we propose an equivalent mixed binary linear programming to obtain exact solutions. For large size problems, an exact algorithm (GCKP-A) for solving the inner-level model is given first by exploring the optimal solution. Then a heuristic algorithm is proposed by imbedding (GCKP-A) and 2-opt strategy into the framework of the improved ranking-based algorithm. The performance of the proposed heuristic algorithm is checked for different size problems. The sensitivity analysis of a quasi-real example shows that: (1) in most cases, the uncertainty between two types of demands does not affect the location scheme; (2) the convenience range, the quality range and the quality threshold play an important role in the market share of the new entrant company."
https://openalex.org/W4293068207,"Background The goal of antiretroviral therapy is to achieve sustained human immune deficiency virus (HIV) viral suppression. However, research on factors associated with viral load suppression among adolescents in low and middle-income countries is limited. The objectives of this study were to determine HIV viral suppression levels among adolescents in Kabale district and the associated clinical, adherence and psychosocial factors. Methods Cross-sectional and retrospective cohort study designs were used. Two hundred and forty-nine adolescents living with HIV that attended clinics between September and October 2019 at nine health facilities were interviewed and their medical records reviewed. A data abstraction tool was used to collect clinical data from adolescent’s clinical charts, face to face interviews were conducted using semi-structured questionnaire adopted from the HEADS tool and in-depth interviews conducted with ten key informants. Qualitative data was analyzed using thematic content analysis. Logistic regression was used to determine the magnitude by which clinical and psychosocial factors influence viral load suppression. Odds Ratios (ORs) were used for statistical associations at 95% confidence interval considering statistical significance for p-values less than 0.05. Qualitative data collected from Key informants to support our quantitative findings was analyzed using thematic content analysis. Results HIV viral suppression among (n = 249) adolescents was at 81%. Having no severe opportunistic infections was associated with viral load suppression among adolescent living with HIV (OR = 1.09; 95%CI [1.753–4.589]; p&lt;0.001) as well as having no treatment interruptions (OR = 0.86; 95% CI [2.414–6.790]; p = 0.004). Belonging to a support group (OR = 1.01; 95% CI [1.53–4.88]; P = 0.020), having parents alive (OR = 2.04; 95% CI[1.02–4.12]; P = 0.047) and having meals in a day (OR = 5.68; C.I = 2.38–6.12, P = 0.010), were significantly associated to viral load suppression. The findings also indicated that long distances from health facilities, transport challenges and unprofessional conduct of health workers that make adolescent unwelcome at health facilities negatively affected viral suppression among adolescents. Conclusion The findings indicate that HIV viral suppression among adolescents on ART was at 81%. Kabale district was likely not to achieve the third 90 of the UNAIDS 90-90-90 global target for this population category. The findings further indicate that having no severe opportunistic infection and no treatment interruptions, good nutrition status, peer support and support from significant others, were highly associated with viral load suppression."
https://openalex.org/W4292219954,"The aim of the study was to assess the validity of the use of the battery of tests assessing higher auditory functions in the diagnostic process of APD in 6-year-old children. The study involved 1,012 Polish-speaking children aged 6 to 9 years with normal hearing sensitivity. The evaluation of auditory functions was performed using the ATS Neuroflow test battery comprising: Adaptive Speech in Noise test (ASPN-S), Dichotic Digits Test (DDT) and Frequency Pattern Test (FPT). Two groups were distinguished: the group”S” (Study) containing 880 participants with APD (participants who obtained abnormal results in at least two tests) and the group”C” (Control) including 132 participants without APD. The results obtained by 6-year-old children in behavioral tests present a similar disorder’s profile to those of older children in terms of the prevalence of specific deficits and their severity. Performance in the APD tests of healthy 6-year-old children is higher than 9-year-old children with APD, despite the process of physiological development of hearing functions in older children. The test assessing understanding speech in noise was the most frequently impaired among all examined, while the dichotic listening with distracted attention was the least frequently impaired function. The deficit found in DDT was opposite between patients with APD and healthy children, we called the detected phenomenon the reversed lateralization pattern. The use of DDT, FPT and ASPN-S tests to evaluate higher auditory functions in the process of diagnosing APD in 6-year-old children is justified by the lack of discrepancy in the disorder profile of 6-year-old children in comparison with older children, both in the healthy population, and in children with impaired auditory function development. Early diagnosis can be beneficial for accurate programming of therapeutic goals."
https://openalex.org/W4292219960,"Background By spacing births and preventing unintended pregnancies, family planning is a crucial technique strategy for controlling the fast expansion of the human population. It also improves maternal and child health. women who are thought to be sexually active but who do not use modern contraception methods, who either do not want to have any more children (Limiting) or who want to delay having children for at least two years are considered to have an unmet need for family planning (Spacing). Objective This study carried out to determine which socio-demographic factors are the key contributors to the discrepancies in the unmet need for family planning among women of reproductive age between surveys years 2005 and 2016. Methods The data for this study arrived from the Ethiopia Demographic Health Surveys in 2005, 2011, and 2016 to investigate trends and Predictors of change of unmet need for family planning among reproductive age women in Ethiopia. Pooled weighted sample of 26,230 (7761 in 2005, 9136 in 2011 and 9,333 in 2016 Ethiopian demographic health surveys) reproductive-age women were used for this study. For the overall trend (2005–2016) multivariable decomposition analysis for non-linear response outcome was calibrated to identify the factors that contributed to the change of unmet need for family planning. The Logit based multivariable decomposition analysis utilizes the output from the logistic regression model to assign the observed change in unmet need for family planning over time into two components. Stata version 16.0 was used to analyze the data. Result The percentage of Ethiopian women of reproductive age who still lack access (unmet need) for family planning declined from 39.6% in 2005 to 23.6 percent in 2016. The decomposition analysis revealed that the change of unmet need for family planning was due to change in characteristics and coefficients. The difference in coefficients accounted for around nine out of 10 variations in unmet family planning need. Education level, birth order, and desired number of children were all factors that changed over the course of the last 11 years in relation to the unmet need for family planning. Conclusion Between 2005 and 2016, there were remarkable changes in unmet need for family planning. Women with birth orders of five and up, women with secondary education, and women who wanted fewer children overall were the main causes of the change in unmet need for family planning."

The accuracy and stability of the servo system can be improved by studying system identification and mechanical resonance frequency. In this study, firstly, the SGCMG gimbal servo system was simplified to a two-mass block model. The theoretical mathematical model of the system's transfer function and mechanical resonance frequency was derived. Secondly, this paper studied the effective suppression method for mechanical resonance. Thirdly, the mathematical model of the orthogonal correlation analysis method was deduced for system identification. Then, an experimental platform was investigated to obtain the frequency characteristic curve and the transfer function. Finally, the frequency characteristic curve obtained using the transfer function model was plotted and compared with the frequency characteristic curve obtained experimentally. Our results indicate that the orthogonal correlation analysis has a high identification accuracy."

Care episodes in three populations were defined using COVID-19-related diagnoses (population 1), SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification test procedures (population 2), and all-cause hospitalizations (population 3) in two linked claims-EHR databases: IBM® MarketScan® Explorys® Claims-EMR Data Set (commercial) and OneFlorida Data Trust linked Medicaid-EHR. Positive and negative predictive values were calculated. Respectively, populations 1, 2, and 3 included 26,686, 26,095, and 2,564 episodes (commercial) and 29,117, 23,412, and 9,629 episodes (Florida Medicaid). The positive predictive value was >80% and the negative predictive value was >95% in each population, with the highest positive predictive value in population 3 (commercial: 91.9%; Medicaid: 93.1%). Findings did not vary substantially by patient age. Positive predictive values in populations 1 and 2 fluctuated during April-June 2020. They then stabilized in the commercial but not the Medicaid population. Negative predictive values were consistent over time in all populations and databases. Our findings indicate that U07.1 has high performance in identifying COVID-19 cases and noncases in claims databases. Performance may vary across populations and periods."

Therefore, this study aimed to determine whether there is any significant difference in the prevalence of premarital HIV testing among women who had autonomous versus non-autonomous marriage, and to investigate the factors associated with premarital HIV testing among women who had autonomous versus non-autonomous marriage in Ethiopia.Data were extracted from 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey dataset and analyzed by using SPSS version 20. Frequencies and weighted percentage of the variables, and second-order Rao-Scott statistic were computed. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors between the two groups. An adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence interval was considered to state statistically significant associations.From 9602 included sample, 4,043 (42.1%) of the women had autonomous marriage, and 5,559(57.9%) of the women had non-autonomous marriage. The prevalence of premarital HIV testing in Ethiopia among women who had autonomous marriage was 30.5% (95% CI: 27.7-33.4%) compared to 20.6% (95% CI: 18.5-22.8) among women who had a non-autonomous marriage. No differences in associated factors were found between women who had autonomous versus non autonomous marriage to uptake HIV testing. In both groups, residence in rural area, education attainment (primary, secondary, higher), media access, being rich and richest, knowing the places for HIV testing, chewing chat, and drinking alcohol were significantly predicts premarital HIV testing.The study indicated that 10% more women in autonomous marriage tested for HIV relative to non-autonomous women whilst being an urban resident, educated, having access to media, household wealth and knowledge of testing facilities significantly predict HIV testing among women in Ethiopia. The paper recommends the Ethiopian government shall expand access to education among women while improving their access to media to enhance their socioeconomic wellbeing and health. Furthermore, it is better to inspire women to undergo autonomous marriage by fostering education in the community to enhance premarital HIV testing."
https://openalex.org/W4293068818,"Different hip pathologies can cause geometric variation of the acetabulum and femoral head. These variations have been considered as an underlying mechanism that affects the tribology of the natural hip joint and changes the stress distribution on the articular surface, potentially leading to joint degradation. To improve understanding of the damage mechanisms and abnormal mechanics of the hip joint, a reliable in-vitro methodology that represents the in vivo mechanical environment is needed where the position of the joint, the congruency of the bones and the loading and motion conditions are clinically relevant and can be modified in a controlled environment. An in vitro simulation methodology was developed and used to assess the effect of loading on a natural hip joint. Porcine hips were dissected and mounted in a single station hip simulator and tested under different loading scenarios. The loading and motion cycle consisted of a simplified gait cycle and three peak axial loading conditions were assessed (Normal, Overload and Overload Plus). Joints were lubricated with Ringer’s solution and tests were conducted for 4 hours. Photographs were taken and compared to characterise cartilage surface and labral tissue pre, during and post simulation. The results showed no evidence of damage to samples tested under normal loading conditions, whereas the samples tested under overload and overload plus conditions exhibited different severities of tears and detachment of the labrum at the antero-superior region. The location and severity of damage was consistent for samples tested under the same conditions; supporting the use of this methodology to investigate further effects of altered loading and motion on natural tissue."

However, traditional FCMs are usually learned by gradient-based methods, and the adopted sigmoid nonlinear activation function frequently causes gradient saturation. These two shortcomings set a limit on the modeling accuracy. To overcome those problems, we propose in this paper a new FCM with two improvements. First, the rectified linear unit (ReLu) activation function is adopted to replace the sigmoid function. Second, a newly proposed quasi-oppositional bare bone imperialist competition algorithm (QBBICA) is used to learn the FCM. The improved FCM is used to predict the employment rate of graduates from Liren College, Yanshan University. Experimental results show that the improved FCM is effective in employment rate prediction."

However, no previous study has examined such effects in an extremely short-term period such as one classroom lesson. This study aimed to examine the effects of using standing desks for 45 minutes on elementary school students' stress and executive function. For this experiment, 56 students were recruited from public elementary schools in Setagayaku, Tokyo, Japan. There were three conditions involving the use of standing desks (standing, sitting, and mixed), and all students performed tasks for 45 minutes in each condition. Measurements of stress and executive function were performed before and after the students engaged with each condition. Stress levels did not differ between the sitting and standing conditions for the full 45 minutes. The number of correct answers in the Stroop test, an interference task, was higher in the standing and mixed conditions (switching between standing and sitting) than in the sitting condition (interaction: F(1,37) = 3.340, p = 0.04, η2 = 0.05). These results indicate that using standing desks for 45 minutes improved the 'inhibition' of executive function without excessively increasing stress levels."

Coronary revascularization is reported to provide benefit in these patients; however, the optimal timing remains uncertain.This retrospective study was performed at a tertiary center in Taipei from January 2010 to December 2017. 1931 patients received coronary revascularization indicated for AMI. Among these, 239 patients were hospitalized for acute infection but later developed AMI. Patients with either an ST-elevation myocardial infarct or the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease were excluded. Revascularization was performed via either percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). We defined early and delayed revascularization groups if it was performed within or after 24 hours of the diagnosis of AMI, respectively. We evaluated whether the timing of revascularization altered 30-day and one-year all-cause mortality.At one month, 24 (26%) patients died in early revascularization group and 32 (22%) patients in delayed revascularization group. At one year, 40 (43%) and 59 (40%) patients died on early and delayed revascularization groups respectively. Early revascularization did not result in lower 30-day all-cause mortality (P = 0.424), and one-year all-cause mortality (Hazard ratio (HR): 0.935; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.626-1.397, P = 0.742) than delay revascularization.Timing of coronary revascularization of post infectious acute coronary syndrome may be arranged according to individual risk category as those without sepsis."

Unavailability of cardiac tissue has hindered the comprehensive exploration of gene regulatory networks and nodal players in DCM. In this study, we carried out integrated analysis of transcriptome and methylome data using non-negative matrix factorization from a cohort of DCM patients to uncover underlying latent factors and covarying features between whole-transcriptome and epigenome omics datasets from tissue biopsies of living patients. DNA methylation data from Infinium HM450 and mRNA Illumina sequencing of n = 33 DCM and n = 24 control probands were filtered, analyzed and used as input for matrix factorization using R NMF package. Mann-Whitney U test showed 4 out of 5 latent factors are significantly different between DCM and control probands (P<0.05). Characterization of top 10% features driving each latent factor showed a significant enrichment of biological processes known to be involved in DCM pathogenesis, including immune response (P = 3.97E-21), nucleic acid binding (P = 1.42E-18), extracellular matrix (P = 9.23E-14) and myofibrillar structure (P = 8.46E-12).

https://openalex.org/W4292680133,"Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is a maternally inherited trait that inhibits plants from producing or releasing viable pollen. CMS is caused by mitochondrial-nuclear interaction, and can be rescued by introducing functional nuclear restorer-of-fertility (Rf) gene. The Tetep-CMS/Rf lines were developed through successive inter-subspecific backcrosses between indica and japonica rice accessions. Phenotypic characterization of Tetep-CMS lines revealed abnormal anther dehiscence and the inability to release, while possessing functional pollen. Transverse sections of developing anthers collected from CMS plants showed connective tissue deformities and aberrant dehydration of endothecium and epidermis. Fine mapping of Rf-Tetep using a series of segregating populations, delimited the candidate region to an approximately 109 kb genomic interval between M2099 and FM07 flanking markers. Nanopore long-read sequencing and genome assembly, proceeded by gene prediction and annotation revealed 11 open reading frames (ORFs) within the candidate region, and suggest ORF6 annotated as pentatricopeptide repeat motif containing gene 1 (PPR1), as a possible candidate gene responsible for fertility restoration. This study suggests that tissue-specific abnormalities in anthers are responsible for indehiscence-based sterility, and propose that the functional Rf gene is derived from allelic variation between inter-subspecies in rice."

In this paper, we focus on user multiple session interest and propose a hierarchical model based on session interest (SIHM) for CTR prediction. First, we divide the user sequential behavior into session layer. Then, we employ a self-attention network obtain an accurate expression of interest for each session. Since different session interest may be related to each other or follow a sequential pattern, next, we utilize bidirectional long short-term memory network (BLSTM) to capture the interaction of different session interests.

https://openalex.org/W4293065791,"To meet the high demand for white Guinea yam, there is a need to develop and release improved varieties to farmers. Unfortunately, low rate of adoption of most of the improved yam varieties by both producers and consumers was observed. Information regarding agronomic characteristics and food qualities of popular white Guinea yam landraces with high market value are not available to establish minimum standards to be considered by breeding programs. To fill this gap, surveys using rural appraisal tools were carried out in 20 villages and 16 markets throughout Benin. Data on the agronomic performance suggested that for an improved variety to be adopted by Beninese farmers it should have a minimum yield of 4.16 ± 0.15 kg per mound, and average number of marketable tubers of 1.23 ± 0.05, a mean tuber length of 36.41 ± 1.22 cm, and a minimum diameter of 25.44 ± 1.16 cm. The sensorial attributes for boiled and pounded tubers of this improved variety should have minimum score of 3.16 for texture, 0.75 for softness, 3.75 for elasticity, and 1.34 for colour during the sensory evaluation. The improved variety must also have a minimum average severity score of 1.1 for yam mosaic virus disease, 1.33 for anthracnose and 1 for nematodes. Landraces Amoula, Laboko, and Djilaadja should be considered as the standard for yield, sensory attributes, and tolerance to pest and diseases while landraces Danwari, Kodjewe, Mondji, and Gnidou should be characterized as possessing good flowering and fruit setting capacities for breeding programs."

This study aimed to investigate the association between implementation of mass media campaigns (MMC) and community-based campaigns (CBC) for increased fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption to meet the global recommended level in the Thai population. The sample was obtained from a nationally-representative, longitudinal household survey of the Thai population, Round1 (2018) and Round2 (2019). The study applied a multi-stage sampling design to obtain a sample of persons age 15 years or older. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 3,010 respondents who successfully participated in both Round1 and Round2 surveys. Information on FV consumption, exposure to Government MMC, ThaiHealth MMC including social marketing (MMSMC) and CBC, and sociodemographic characteristics were collected. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the association between implementation of those campaigns and increased FV consumption compared to the recommended level. Of the total respondents, only 11.3% had higher FV consumption and also met the minimum requirement. Respondents who lived in rural areas, were farmers, and grew FV at home had the highest probability of increased FV consumption. Exposure to the MMC and CBC was also associated with an increase in FV consumption. Above all, those who had exposure to the MMSMC, who reported either having high level of perception (OR = 1.832, 95% CI 1.259-2.666) or ever heard or seen (OR = 1.770, 95% CI 1.264-2.479) or heard and seen (OR = 1.698, 95% CI 1.131-2.550) campaign information were more likely to have a substantial increase in FV consumption and meeting/exceeding the recommended level than those who were not exposed to these campaigns. Other associated factors include education, occupation and physical activity. Implementation of MMSMC can help the population meet the global recommended level of FV consumption. This study presents its novelty since it was the first to highlight influence of mass media campaigns on increased FV consumption in Asian population. This was also the first study that used data from a population-based longitudinal study. The study suggested that MMC and CBC should also be promoted together with support systems to increase their intensity to a level that can increase population FV consumption to meet the recommended level. Sociodemographic characteristics should be taken into account, and targeted media is needed to effectively reach specific sub-groups of the population."

In this study, through a stringent bioinformatics analysis of the core genome and proteome of S . pneumoniae PCS8235, we identified and analyzed 28 HPs that are common in many Streptococcus species and might have a potential role in the virulence or pathogenesis of the bacteria. Functional annotations of the proteins were conducted based on the physicochemical properties, subcellular localization, virulence prediction, protein-protein interactions, and identification of essential genes, to find potentially druggable proteins among 28 HPs. The majority of the HPs are involved in bacterial transcription and translation. Besides, some of them were homologs of enzymes, binding proteins, transporters, and regulators. Protein-protein interactions revealed HP PCS8235_RS05845 made the highest interactions with other HPs and also has TRP structural motif along with virulent and pathogenic properties indicating it has critical cellular functions and might go under unconventional protein secretions. The second highest interacting protein HP PCS8235_RS02595 interacts with the Regulator of chromosomal segregation (RocS) which participates in chromosome segregation and nucleoid protection in S . pneumoniae . In this interacting network, 54% of protein members have virulent properties and 40% contain pathogenic properties. Among them, most of these proteins circulate in the cytoplasmic area and have hydrophilic properties. Finally, molecular docking and dynamics simulation demonstrated that the antimalarial drug Artenimol can act as a drug repurposing candidate against HP PCS8235_RS 04650 of S . pneumoniae . Hence, the present study could aid in drugs against S . pneumoniae ."
