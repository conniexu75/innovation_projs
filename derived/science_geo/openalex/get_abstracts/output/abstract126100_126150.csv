https://openalex.org/W2058096164,"Human and bovine capillary endothelial cells were switched from growth to apoptosis by using micropatterned substrates that contained extracellular matrix-coated adhesive islands of decreasing size to progressively restrict cell extension. Cell spreading also was varied while maintaining the total cell-matrix contact area constant by changing the spacing between multiple focal adhesion-sized islands. Cell shape was found to govern whether individual cells grow or die, regardless of the type of matrix protein or antibody to integrin used to mediate adhesion. Local geometric control of cell growth and viability may therefore represent a fundamental mechanism for developmental regulation within the tissue microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2027699993,"CD4 T cells potentiate the inflammatory or humoral immune response through the action of Th1 and Th2 cells, respectively. The molecular basis of the differentiation of these cells from naive T cell precursors is, however, unclear. We found that GATA-3 was selectively expressed in Th2 cells. GATA-3 is expressed at a high level in naive, freshly activated T cells and Th2 lineage cells, but subsides to a minimal level in Th1 lineage cells as naive cells commit to their Th subset. Antisense GATA-3 inhibited the expression of all Th2 cytokine genes in the Th2 clone D10. GATA-3 directly activated an IL-4 promoter-luciferase reporter gene in M12 cells. In transgenic mice, elevated GATA-3 in CD4 T cells caused Th2 cytokine gene expression in developing Th1 cells. Thus, GATA-3 is necessary and sufficient for Th2 cytokine gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2054513544,"We used positional cloning to identify the circadian Clock gene in mice. Clock is a large transcription unit with 24 exons spanning approximately 100,000 bp of DNA from which transcript classes of 7.5 and approximately 10 kb arise. Clock encodes a novel member of the bHLH-PAS family of transcription factors. In the Clock mutant allele, an A-->T nucleotide transversion in a splice donor site causes exon skipping and deletion of 51 amino acids in the CLOCK protein. Clock is a unique gene with known circadian function and with features predicting DNA binding, protein dimerization, and activation domains. CLOCK represents the second example of a PAS domain-containing clock protein (besides Drosophila PERIOD), which suggests that this motif may define an evolutionarily conserved feature of the circadian clock mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2023052504,"No growth factors specific for the lymphatic vascular system have yet been described. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) regulates vascular permeability and angiogenesis, but does not promote lymphangiogenesis. Overexpression of VEGF-C, a ligand of the VEGF receptors VEGFR-3 and VEGFR-2, in the skin of transgenic mice resulted in lymphatic, but not vascular, endothelial proliferation and vessel enlargement. Thus, VEGF-C induces selective hyperplasia of the lymphatic vasculature, which is involved in the draining of interstitial fluid and in immune function, inflammation, and tumor metastasis. VEGF-C may play a role in disorders involving the lymphatic system and may be of potential use in therapeutic lymphangiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1995434077,"Presenilin-1 (PS1) is the major gene responsible for early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). To understand the normal function of PS1, we have generated a targeted null mutation in the murine homolog of PS1. We report that PS1-/- mice die shortly after natural birth or Caesarean section. The skeleton of homozygous mutants is grossly deformed. Hemorrhages occur in the CNS of PS1 null mutants with varying location, severity, and time of onset. The ventricular zone of PS1-/- brains is markedly thinner by embryonic day 14.5, indicating an impairment in neurogenesis. Bilateral cerebral cavitation caused by massive neuronal loss in specific subregions of the mutant brain is prominent after embryonic day 16.5. These results show that PS1 is required for proper formation of the axial skeleton, normal neurogenesis, and neuronal survival."

The murine MEF2C gene is expressed in heart precursor cells before formation of the linear heart tube. In mice homozygous for a null mutation of MEF2C , the heart tube did not undergo looping morphogenesis, the future right ventricle did not form, and a subset of cardiac muscle genes was not expressed. The absence of the right ventricular region of the mutant heart correlated with down-regulation of the dHAND gene, which encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor required for cardiac morphogenesis. Thus, MEF2C is an essential regulator of cardiac myogenesis and right ventricular development."
https://openalex.org/W2035651986,"The dominant exported proteins and protective antigens of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are a triad of related gene products called the antigen 85 (Ag85) complex. Each has also been implicated in disease pathogenesis through its fibronectin-binding capacities. A carboxylesterase domain was found within the amino acid sequences of Ag85A, B, and C, and each protein acted as a mycolyltransferase involved in the final stages of mycobacterial cell wall assembly, as shown by direct enzyme assay and site-directed mutagenesis. Furthermore, the use of an antagonist (6-azido-6-deoxy-α,α′-trehalose) of this activity demonstrates that these proteins are essential and potential targets for new antimycobacterial drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2051818544,"As a complementary approach to positional cloning, we used in vivo complementation with bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones expressed in transgenic mice to identify the circadian Clock gene. A 140 kb BAC transgene completely rescued both the long period and the loss-of-rhythm phenotypes in Clock mutant mice. Analysis with overlapping BAC transgenes demonstrates that a large transcription unit spanning approximately 100,000 base pairs is the Clock gene and encodes a novel basic-helix-loop-helix-PAS domain protein. Overexpression of the Clock transgene can shorten period length beyond the wild-type range, which provides additional evidence that Clock is an integral component of the circadian pacemaking system. Taken together, these results provide a proof of principle that ""cloning by rescue"" is an efficient and definitive method in mice."

The fully modern midfacial morphology of the fossils antedates other evidence of this feature by about 650,000 years. The midfacial and subnasal morphology of modern humans may be a retention of a juvenile pattern that was not yet present in H. ergaster.

https://openalex.org/W2133778193,"Transcription factor Sp1 has been implicated in the expression of many genes. Moreover, it has been suggested that Sp1 is linked to the maintenance of methylation-free CpG islands, the cell cycle, and the formation of active chromatin structures. We have inactivated the mouse Sp1 gene. Sp1-/- embryos are retarded in development, show a broad range of abnormalities, and die around day 11 of gestation. In Sp1-/- embryos, the expression of many putative target genes, including cell cycle-regulated genes, is not affected, CpG islands remain methylation free, and active chromatin is formed at the globin loci. However, the expression of the methyl-CpG-binding protein MeCP2 is greatly reduced in Sp1-/- embryos. MeCP2 is thought to be required for the maintenance of differentiated cells. We suggest that Sp1 is an important regulator of this process."
https://openalex.org/W1988479344,"Ten ACA yeast small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) were shown to be required for site-specific synthesis of pseudouridine psi in ribosomal RNA. A common secondary folding motif for the snoRNAs and rRNA target segments predicts that site selection involves: (1) base pairing of the snoRNA with complementary rRNA elements flanking the site of modification, and (2) identification of a uridine located at a near-constant distance from the snoRNA ACA box. The model is supported by mutations showing that: (1) reducing the complementarity between the snoRNA and rRNA disrupts psi formation, and (2) altering the distance between the ACA box and target uridine causes an adjacent uridine to be modified. This discovery implies that most snoRNAs function in targeting nucleotide modification in rRNA: ribose methylation for the box C/D snoRNAs and psi formation for the ACA snoRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2113031608,"Although LOX mRNA accumulates early during differentiation, a differentiation control element in its 3′ untranslated region confers translational silencing until late stage erythropoiesis. We have purified two proteins from rabbit reticulocytes that specifically mediate LOX silencing and identified them as hnRNPs K and E1. Transfection of hnRNP K and hnRNP E1 into HeLa cells specifically silenced the translation of reporter mRNAs bearing a differentiation control element in their 3′ untranslated region. Silenced LOX mRNA in rabbit reticulocytes specifically coimmunoprecipitated with hnRNP K. In a reconstituted cell-free translation system, addition of recombinant hnRNP K and hnRNP E1 recapitulates this regulation via a specific inhibition of 80S ribosome assembly on LOX mRNA. Both proteins can control cap-dependent and internal ribosome entry site–mediated translation by binding to differentiation control elements. Our data suggest a specific cytoplasmic function for hnRNPs as translational regulatory proteins."

Recently, we reported a mutation in a novel MHC class I-like gene, called HLA-H (3Feder J.N. Gnirke A. Thomas W. Tsuchihashi Z. Ruddy D.A. Basava A. Dormishian F. Domingo R. Ellis M.C. Fullan A.

Eighty-three percent of HH patient DNAs were found to be homozygous for this mutation, which consists of a single base transition of G to A and results in a change of cysteine 282 → tyrosine (C282Y).

A second missense mutation, histidine 63 → aspartate (H63D), was also reported that was enriched in heterozygotes with the C282Y mutation (eight of nine cases) (3Feder J.N. Gnirke A. Thomas W.

The specific role that either of these mutations in HLA-H play in the etiology of HH disease has not been elucidated.The HLA-H protein is similar to MHC class I family molecules including HLA-A2, nonclassical class I molecules such as HLA-G, and the human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). All four of the invariant cysteine residues that form disulfide bridges in the α2 and α3 domains of MHC class I family members are present in the HLA-H protein. One of these conserved cysteine residues is altered in the C282Y mutation. The integrity of the conserved disulfide linkages has been suggested to be critical for proper maintenance of the secondary and tertiary structure of the protein allowing interactions with accessory molecules such as β2-microglobulin (7Bjorkman P.J. Parham P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 253-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Importantly, the functional significance of an interaction between β2-microglobulin and an unknown class I-like molecule in HH disease was suggested by β2-microglobulin-deficient mice; these mice display a progressive hepatic iron overload similar to that observed in human HH (8de Souza M.

Other studies have demonstrated that mutation of cysteine 203 in the α3 domain of the mouse MHC class I family member H-2Ld prevented intracellular transport of the molecule from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane (11Miyazaki J. Appella E. Ozato K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).As a step toward understanding the role of HLA-H in HH disease, we examined the effects of the C282Y and H63D mutations on HLA-H cellular processing. In this report we demonstrate that wild-type HLA-H binds to β2-microglobulin and that the C282Y mutation completely abrogates this interaction and disrupts intracellular protein trafficking. The data provide support for the hypothesis that the C282Y mutation results in intracellular sequestration of the HLA-H protein, which leads to HH disease.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe first sought to demonstrate an interaction of the HLA-H protein with β2-microglobulin and to examine the effects of the C282Y and H63D mutations on that interaction. Human embryonic kidney cells (293 cells) were transfected with vectors containing the wild-type HLA-H cDNA or the cDNA with either the C282Y or H63D mutation. The FLAG octapeptide sequence was fused onto the carboxyl terminus of each, providing a specific tag for detection of the expressed proteins (13Ford C.F. Suominen I. Glatz C.E. Protein Expression Purif. 1991; 2: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We established individual stable cell lines expressing the three proteins. Immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with monoclonal antibodies directed to the FLAG sequences (M2 antibodies), to precipitate the HLA-H/FLAG fusion protein, followed by Western blotting with β2-microglobulin polyclonal antibodies demonstrated a clear interaction between the HLA-H protein and β2-microglobulin (Fig. 1 A, left panel, Wild type lane). Significantly, β2-microglobulin was not detected in immune complexes from cell lines expressing the HLA-H protein with the C282Y mutation (Fig. 1 A, left panel). This failure to detect β2-microglobulin was not due to lack of HLA-H protein in the mutant cell lines, since stripping the blots and immunodetection with rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed to the COOH-terminal 17 amino acids of HLA-H (CT1 antibodies) demonstrated that the amount of HLA-H protein in the three cell lines was similar (Fig. 1 A, right panel). The results with the H63D mutant were similar to the wild-type HLA-H protein; β2-microglobulin was co-immunoprecipitated along with that mutant protein (Fig. 1 A, left panel, compare H63D and Wild type lanes). It is of interest to note that the wild-type or H63D HLA-H proteins detected in the right panel appeared to migrate as a doublet of 49 and 46 kDa in lighter exposures, whereas the C282Y appeared as only a single band of approximately 46 kDa.The β2-microglobulin/HLA-H interaction results were corroborated by performing the inverse experiment in which cell lysates were initially immunoprecipitated with β2-microglobulin antibodies followed by Western blotting with antibodies directed toward the COOH-terminal sequence of HLA-H (CT1 antibodies). In this experiment, the β2-microglobulin antibodies co-immunoprecipitated HLA-H protein from the wild-type and H63D mutant expressor cell lines, but failed to do so in the C282Y mutant expressor cell line (Fig. 1 B, left panel). Stripping the blots and reprobing with β2-microglobulin antibodies demonstrated that similar amounts of β2-microglobulin protein were immunoprecipitated from each cell line (Fig. 1 B, right panel). These results further confirm an interaction between wild-type HLA-H protein and β2-microglobulin and demonstrate that the C282Y, but not the H63D, mutation disrupts this association.Previous reports have suggested that association of the MHC class I heavy chain with β2-microglobulin is critical for cell-surface expression (14Arce-Gomez B. Jones E.A. Barnstable C.J. Solomon E. Bodmer W.F. Tissue Antigens. 1978; 11: 96-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 15Seong R.H. Clayberger C.A. Krensky A.M. Parnes J.R. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 288-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because of the failure of the HLA-H protein containing the C282Y mutation to interact with β2-microglobulin, we next investigated whether this mutation would also affect cell-surface presentation of the HLA-H protein. Parental 293 cell lines and those expressing the wild-type HLA-H protein or the C282Y mutant were examined for cell-surface protein expression by immunostaining with rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific to sequences residing in the predicted external domain of the HLA-H protein (EX1 and EX2 antibodies) followed by detection with immunofluorescence. Parental 293 cells displayed no detectable surface labeling by these antibodies (Fig. 2 A), consistent with the undetectable levels of HLA-H protein observed in the Western blotting experiments (Fig. 1 A, right panel). Wild-type HLA-H-expressing cells demonstrated a distinct pattern of surface labeling as evidenced by a punctate pattern of labeling that was much more intense at the edges of the cells (Fig. 2 B). By contrast, cells expressing the C282Y mutation displayed no surface labeling and were indistinguishable from the parental controls (Fig. 2, compare C and A). The specificity of the antibody labeling was demonstrated by preincubating the EX1 and EX2 antibodies with their respective peptides; in these experiments the punctate surface labeling observed in the wild-type HLA-H expressor cells was completely abolished (data not shown).Figure 2The C282Y mutation in HLA-H prevents cell surface expression. To examine HLA-H determinants exposed on the cell surface, parental 293 cell lines, and 293 cells stably transfected with wild-type HLA-H (Wild type) or HLA-H containing the C282Y or H63D mutations were first fixed in paraformaldehyde and then labeled with a 1:1 mixture of antibodies EX1 and EX2 at 50 μg/ml followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (A–C, Non-permeablized). For a comparison with surface staining, cells were fixed and then permeablized with saponin and labeled as in A–C(D–F, Permeablized), both internal and to a lesser extent, surface determinants are labeled with this procedure. Magnification, × 630.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We examined the possibility that the C282Y mutant protein was expressed in the transfected cells but remained intracellularly localized. Immunostaining was performed following treatment of the cells with saponin to permeablize them. Staining of these cells for the FLAG-tagged C282Y mutant HLA-H protein demonstrated strong perinuclear fluorescence, which was absent in the parental control cells (Fig. 2, compare D and F). Permeablized wild-type HLA-H protein expressor cells showed similar intracellular staining with the FLAG-M2 antibody, suggesting that not all of the wild-type protein in these transfected cells reaches the cell surface (E). Experiments utilizing the EX1, EX2, or CT1 antibodies yielded the same results (data not shown). These results clearly demonstrate that the C282Y mutation specifically disrupts cell-surface presentation of the HLA-H protein.To examine the distribution of wild-type and mutant HLA-H proteins within the cell in more detail, we performed subcellular fractionations on stepwise sucrose gradients to separate the various membrane components. Three separate postnuclear membrane fractions were obtained; the 20/35% interface contained the lightest density membranes (L); dense membranes (D) partitioned at the 40/50% interface, whereas the 35/40% medium-density (M) interface contained a mixture of light and dense membrane-derived components. We initially characterized the efficacy of our subcellular membrane fractionation scheme by assaying these fractions for marker proteins. Antibodies to Na+/K+-ATPase were utilized as markers for plasma membrane, β-coatomer protein (β-COP) for Golgi, and calnexin for ER membrane identification. Samples representing membranes from equal numbers of cells from each interface were analyzed by Western blotting and quantitated on a Molecular Dynamics scanning densitometer. Plasma membranes were found primarily in the light-density interface and to a lesser extent in the medium-density layer: L, 90%; M, 10%; D, 0%. Golgi membranes were distributed nearly equally throughout the three interfaces: L, 30%; M, 40%; D, 30%. ER membranes were found mostly in the dense membrane interface: L, 0%; M, 20%; D, 80%. The fractionations from each of the three cell lines gave equivalent results.We determined the specific distribution of HLA-H proteins in the sucrose gradient interfaces by Western blotting and probing with HLA-H antibodies. As with the co-immunoprecipitation results (Fig. 1), the immunostaining suggested that the wild-type HLA-H protein migrated as a doublet of the 49 and 46 kDa forms (Fig. 3, left panel). The slower migrating 49-kDa form was found principally in those fractions containing plasma membranes, whereas the lower molecular mass 46-kDa form was distributed in a pattern similar to that of the Golgi marker, β-COP. By contrast, the C282Y mutant HLA-H protein consisted only of the faster migrating 46-kDa species. Like the wild-type 46-kDa protein, the mutant 46-kDa protein was distributed in a pattern that most closely resembled that of the Golgi marker protein, suggesting the possibility of incomplete posttranslational processing or modification (Fig. 3, middle panel). The H63D mutant proteins migrated in a pattern resembling that of the wild-type protein, implying that this mutation had little or no effect on intracellular HLA-H protein trafficking (Fig. 3, right panel). In other studies, no HLA-H protein was detected in the cytosolic fractions of any of the wild-type or mutant cell lines, suggesting that neither the C282Y nor the H63D mutation cause a redistribution of the protein to the cytoplasm (data not shown).Figure 3The C282Y mutation in HLA-H alters the subcellular distribution of the protein. Membranes from 293 cells stably expressing the wild-type HLA-H or the C282Y or H63D mutant proteins were fractionated by isopycnic stepwise sucrose gradient centrifugation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Membranes from each interface were then resolved on SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane, and the HLA-H protein detected with a 1:1 mixture of EX1 and EX2 HLA-H antibodies followed by ECL.

Cysteine 282 is one of four cysteine residues that are invariant in both classical and nonclassical MHC class I molecules and forms a critical disulfide bridge in the α3-immunoglobulin-like domain (7Bjorkman P.J. Parham P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 253-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Thus, the integrity of this structure is critical to the formation of the heterodimer of β2-microglobulin and HLA-H and also for proper intracellular processing of the protein. Class I MHC molecules are noncovalently linked heterodimers between an α heavy chain and β2-microglobulin (light chain) (7Bjorkman P.J. Parham P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 253-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). The role of the β2-microglobulin/heavy chain interaction is to facilitate and stabilize the folding of the heavy chain during biosynthesis through interactions with the α1-α2platform and the α3 domain (16Hansen T.H. Myers N.B. Lee D.R. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 3522-3527PubMed Google Scholar) (7Bjorkman P.J. Parham P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 253-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Previous work demonstrated that mutating the reciprocal cysteine residue (cysteine 203) in mouse H-2Ld protein abolished cell-surface presentation (11Miyazaki J. Appella E. Ozato K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the mutant H-2Ld molecule retained the ability to associate with β2-microglobulin. Mouse H-2Ld belongs to the family of classical antigen-presenting molecules, whereas HLA-H is nonpolymorphic and, therefore, resembles nonclassical molecules such as HLA-G or the human Fc receptor (3Feder J.N. Gnirke A. Thomas W. Tsuchihashi Z. Ruddy D.A. Basava A. Dormishian F. Domingo R. Ellis M.C. Fullan A. Hinton L.M. Jones N.L. Kimmel B.E. Kronmal G.S. Lauer P. Lee V.K. Loeb D.B. Mapa F.A.

Genet. 1996; 13: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (3327) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that the integrity of the α3 domain may be less stringent for β2-microglobulin association with classical antigen-presenting proteins (such as H-2Ld) than for nonclassical molecules (such as HLA-H).The biogenesis of MHC class I molecules is well documented. The heavy chain of a MHC class I molecule is synthesized on membrane-bound polysomes, and N-linked glycosylation occurs co-translationally in the ER (17Ploegh H.L. Cannon L.E. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2273-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the modified heavy chain associates with chaperone proteins and β2-microglobulin in the ER and is then transported through the cis-Golgi network, to the middle and trans-Golgi cisternae where the glycosyl side chain is modified to a more complex form en route to the plasma membrane (18Krangel M.S.

Class I molecules that fail to assemble properly are recycled between the ER and Golgi, rather than being retained exclusively in the ER (21Hsu V.W. Yuan L.C. Nuchtern J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Hammerling G.J. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1991; 352: 441-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In our studies the C282Y mutant of HLA-H is retained on intracellular membranes in a pattern that would be consistent with these earlier observations. The mutant protein migrates similar to the Golgi marker protein β-COP in subcellular fractionations, but because of the limited resolution of the step-gradient, we cannot rule out that some protein may also be in the ER. The perinuclear pattern of staining noted in the immunofluorescence studies does not definitively resolve this. More detailed studies will be necessary to ascertain the specific point at which intracellular transport of the C282Y mutant is disrupted.In contrast to our results with the C282Y mutation, we found no detectable changes in the β2-microglobulin interaction or intracellular processing of the H63D mutant form of HLA-H, which is enriched in C282Y heterozygous patients (3Feder J.N.

Other studies have demonstrated alterations in intracellular transport of class I molecules by mutations in the peptide-binding groove of HLA-A (22Salter R.D. Immunogenetics. 1994; 39: 266-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The H63D mutation is localized in the α1 domain between the third and fourth β strands of the external peptide-binding region. It is possible that the effect of this mutation is to alter the affinity of the HLA-H protein for an as yet unidentified ligand or to alter the manner that the mutant protein interacts with other proteins in the cell membrane. Alternatively, this mutation may represent a common polymorphism with little or no effect on the biological functioning of the protein. The definitive answer to this question will await further investigation as we elucidate how the HLA-H molecule regulates iron metabolism in the body.

Recently, we reported a mutation in a novel MHC class I-like gene, called HLA-H (3Feder J.N. Gnirke A. Thomas W. Tsuchihashi Z. Ruddy D.A. Basava A. Dormishian F. Domingo R. Ellis M.C. Fullan A.

Eighty-three percent of HH patient DNAs were found to be homozygous for this mutation, which consists of a single base transition of G to A and results in a change of cysteine 282 → tyrosine (C282Y). Subsequent reports have confirmed the high frequency of this founder mutation in other HH patients (4Jaswinska E.C. Cullen L.M. Busfield F. Pyper W.R. Webb S.I. Powell L.W. Morris C.P. Walsh T.P.

A second missense mutation, histidine 63 → aspartate (H63D), was also reported that was enriched in heterozygotes with the C282Y mutation (eight of nine cases) (3Feder J.N. Gnirke A. Thomas W.

The specific role that either of these mutations in HLA-H play in the etiology of HH disease has not been elucidated. hereditary hemochromatosis major histocompatibility complex polymerase chain reaction β-coatomer protein endoplasmic reticulum polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis polyvinyl difluoride. The HLA-H protein is similar to MHC class I family molecules including HLA-A2, nonclassical class I molecules such as HLA-G, and the human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). All four of the invariant cysteine residues that form disulfide bridges in the α2 and α3 domains of MHC class I family members are present in the HLA-H protein. One of these conserved cysteine residues is altered in the C282Y mutation. The integrity of the conserved disulfide linkages has been suggested to be critical for proper maintenance of the secondary and tertiary structure of the protein allowing interactions with accessory molecules such as β2-microglobulin (7Bjorkman P.J. Parham P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 253-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Importantly, the functional significance of an interaction between β2-microglobulin and an unknown class I-like molecule in HH disease was suggested by β2-microglobulin-deficient mice; these mice display a progressive hepatic iron overload similar to that observed in human HH (8de Souza M.

Other studies have demonstrated that mutation of cysteine 203 in the α3 domain of the mouse MHC class I family member H-2Ld prevented intracellular transport of the molecule from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane (11Miyazaki J. Appella E. Ozato K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). As a step toward understanding the role of HLA-H in HH disease, we examined the effects of the C282Y and H63D mutations on HLA-H cellular processing. In this report we demonstrate that wild-type HLA-H binds to β2-microglobulin and that the C282Y mutation completely abrogates this interaction and disrupts intracellular protein trafficking. The data provide support for the hypothesis that the C282Y mutation results in intracellular sequestration of the HLA-H protein, which leads to HH disease.

https://openalex.org/W2006913118,"In the vertebrate brain, neurons grouped in parallel laminae receive distinct sets of synaptic inputs. In the avian optic tectum, arbors and synapses of most retinal axons are confined to 3 of 15 laminae. The adhesion molecule N-cadherin and cell surface glycoconjugates recognized by a plant lectin are selectively associated with these “retinorecipient” laminae. The lectin and a monoclonal antibody to N-cadherin perturbed laminar selectivity in distinct fashions. In contrast, neurotrophins increased the complexity of retinal arbors without affecting their laminar distribution. Thus, cell surface molecules and soluble trophic factors may collaborate to shape lamina-specific arbors in the brain, with the former predominantly affecting their position and the latter their size."

These results have strong implications in the design of anticancer drugs based on inhibition of prenylation. Post-translational modifications of small molecular weight GTP-binding proteins have been the subject of intense studies since the first reports of prenylation appeared (1Casey P.J. Solski P.A.

Science. 1989; 245: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Many of these proteins, and specifically the Ras proteins, are involved in tumorigenesis. Since prenylation is necessary for the transformation potential of Ras proteins, a number of groups have been dedicated to the design of inhibitors of prenylation as a strategy to inhibit tumor formation (4Buss J.E. Marsters J.C. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 787-791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Two types of prenyl modifications have been described: farnesylation and geranylgeranylation.

Gierasch L.M. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In this sequence, C stands for cysteine and A for any amino acid. The amino acid X specifies whether the protein will be farnesylated (methionine or serine) or geranylgeranylated (leucine or phenylalanine) by the appropriate enzyme. This rule is followed in the majority of cases. However, recent reports have shown that Ki-Ras, whose C terminus CVIM predicts farnesylation, can also be geranylgeranylated in vitro, (8James G.L. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6221-6226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) and that its prenylation in cells is inhibited by a GGTase I inhibitor (9Lerner E.C. Qian Y.M.

Since activated Ki-Ras is the type of Ras most frequently found in human cancers, it is very important to determine how it is modified in vivo and whether this modification can be inhibited. farnesyl protein transferase geranylgeranyl protein transferase I mevalonate transport protein S-farnesyl cysteine S-geranylgeranyl cysteine geranylgeranylated Ki-Ras farnesyl diphosphate geranylgeranyl diphosphate Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high performance liquid chromatography Cell labeling with [3H]mevalonate in the presence of inhibitors of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase such as lovastatin allows the radioactive labeling of cholesterol and its intermediate isoprenoids. However, a major drawback of this approach is the low level of [3H]mevalonate incorporation into cells. The fortuitous identification of the gene for a mevalonate transport membrane protein (pMev) has provided a tool that makes the identification of isoprenoid and non-steroidal isoprenoid intermediates easier (10Faust J. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1996-2004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kim C.M. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23113-23121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection of cells expressing either Ha-Ras or Ki-Ras oncogenes with the mevalonate transporter and growth of the cells under conditions in which the endogenous pools of farnesyl diphosphate and geranylgeranyl diphosphate are radioactively labeled enabled us to demonstrate that both Ha-Ras and Ki-Ras are farnesylated under normal conditions. In the presence of the farnesyl transferase inhibitor B956, farnesylation of both Ha-Ras and Ki-Ras was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. However, as farnesylation was inhibited, Ki-Ras became geranylgeranylated. These results have strong implications for the design of prenylation inhibitors as potential anticancer agents. The inhibitors B956 (trans,cis) (12Nagasu T. Yoshimatsu K. Rowell C. Lewis M.D. Garcia A.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5310-5314PubMed Google Scholar), and its isomer B957 (trans,trans) were synthesized at Eisai Research Institute. Lovastatin was kindly provided by Dr. A. Alberts, Merck Research Laboratories. pMev cDNA was obtained from ATCC. [3H]Mevalonolactone (60 Ci/mmol, ARC) was routinely dried and resuspended in sterile water at 10 mCi/ml. When specified, the lactone was converted to the acid by heating at 37 °C with 1 eq of NaOH. After 30 min, the sample was neutralized with HCl, sterile-filtered, and stored at 4 °C. Ha-Ras and Ha-Ras(61L-CAIL) were purified as described previously (13Garcia A.M. Rowell C. Ackermann K. Kowalczyk J.J. Lewis M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18415-18418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ki-Ras(12V) and GST-Rho A(V14) were purified from BL21(DE3)pLysS cells. Briefly, after transfection, competent BL21(DE3)pLysS were plated and grown overnight at 30 °C. Single colonies were picked and grown in LB plus antibiotics at 30 °C until absorbance at 600 nm was 0.5, at which time the cultures were kept at 4 °C overnight. Next day, the bacterial cultures were diluted 1:50 into prewarmed medium, grown until A600 = 0.5 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 3 h, the bacterial cells were centrifuged, resuspended in 50 ml/liter culture of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, and lysed with 0.1% Triton X-100. The lysed bacteria were stored frozen at −80 °C until further use. To purify soluble Ki-Ras, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to the defrosted lysate; this was clarified by sonication, followed by centrifugation to remove debris. The clear supernatant was applied to a DEAE anion exchange column equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The unbound material containing Ki-Ras was dialyzed against 25 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (Buffer A). The dialyzed Ki-Ras was applied to a Resource-S column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in Buffer A and eluted with a 0–50% linear gradient of Buffer B (Buffer A plus 1 m NaCl). Ki-Ras eluted as a sharp peak around 0.3 m NaCl. The fractions containing Ki-Ras were pooled, and octyl glucoside was added to 0.2%. Ki-Ras (0.06 mg/ml) was flash frozen and stored at −80 °C. Rho A-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was purified by binding to glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) according to supplier's instructions. After washing beads to remove unbound material, Rho A was cleaved with thrombin (Pharmacia) and thrombin was removed with p-aminobenzamidine beads. Beads were sedimented by centrifugation, and cleaved, purified, soluble Rho A was recovered from the supernatant. To standardize prenyl cysteine identification, Ki-Ras (29 pmol), Rho A (78 pmol), or Ha-Ras(CAIL) (26 pmol) was prenylated in medium containing [3H]FPP or [3H]GGPP as described previously (13Garcia A.M. Rowell C. Ackermann K. Kowalczyk J.J. Lewis M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18415-18418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that the incubation continued for 2 h. The labeled proteins were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, washed with 90% acetone, and digested with Pronase, followed by prenyl group extraction as described below. In vitro inhibition of prenylation by B957 was determined using recombinant Ha-Ras or Ha-Ras(CAIL) substrates (13Garcia A.M. Rowell C. Ackermann K. Kowalczyk J.J. Lewis M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18415-18418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NIH-3T3 cells overexpressing either Ha-Ras (zH1 cells obtained from C. Der, University of North Carolina) or Ki-Ras (DK1 cells; Ref. 12Nagasu T. Yoshimatsu K. Rowell C. Lewis M.D. Garcia A.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5310-5314PubMed Google Scholar) were transfected with 2 μg of pMev DNA using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were selected in DMEM, 10% calf serum, 20 μm mevalonate (Sigma), and 50 μm lovastatin (selection/maintenance medium). After 15 days under selection, clones were isolated and maintained in selection medium. To assess the functional expression of pMev, the uptake of [3H]mevalonate was determined by hexane:propanol extraction of cell lysates (11Kim C.M. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23113-23121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, [3H] mevalonate incorporation into protein was measured after trichloroacetic acid precipitation from cell lysates. For isotope labeling, cells were plated at a density of 2 × 106 cells/10-cm plate and grown overnight in maintenance medium (see above). Prior to adding label, cells were starved of mevalonate for approximately 6 h in 4.5 ml of DMEM containing 10% calf serum, 50 μm lovastatin, with or without FTase inhibitor. After starvation, 0.5 ml of medium containing at least 750 μCi of [3H]mevalonolactone and cold mevalonolactone up to the concentration indicated in figure legends was added. Cells were grown for 16 h and lysed in 0.5 ml of 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.01 mm leupeptin and 0.01 mm pepstatin. Ras from [3H]mevalonate-labeled lysates was immunoprecipitated from comparable amounts of proteins with Y13–259 antibody. After washing, the protein A-agarose-Ras complex was resuspended in 250 μl of 90% acetone. From this point on only siliconized materials were used. The acetone slurry was transferred to a glass tube and dried until only the aqueous portion remained. This was diluted with 250 μl of 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 500 μl of Pronase (10 mg/ml in 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5; Calbiochem). The samples were incubated for 16 h in a shaking water bath at 37 °C. Prenyl cysteine groups were extracted four times from the aqueous Pronase solution with 500 μl of chloroform:methanol (9:1). All four extractions were pooled into a siliconized glass tube, and the organic solvent was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen. Prenyl cysteines were resuspended in 150 μl of 20% acetonitrile:methanol containing 0.5 mm each F-Cys and GG-Cys standards (prepared byS-alkylation of cysteine with the corresponding isoprenyl halides). F-Cys and GG-Cys were separated by reversed phase HPLC using a TosoHaas TSK-gel, ODS-120T (4.6 mm × 25 mm) column. Elution was performed with a 10-min linear gradient of 100% buffer A (10% acetonitrile, 0.15% trifluoroacetic acid) to 60% buffer B (100% acetonitrile, 0.15% trifluoroacetic acid), 15 min at 60% B, followed by a 15-min linear gradient to 100% B. The flow rate was constant at 1 ml/min. This protocol allowed for optimal separation of F-Cys and GG-Cys. One-ml fractions were collected, 10 ml of Liquiscint (National Diagnostics) was added, and the samples were counted in a scintillation counter. The pMev clone is available from ATCC in a mammalian expression vector with the neoR gene for selection. However, the cells of interest already express theneoR gene. A novel selection protocol was developed based partially on conditions already described to isolate the transporter (10Faust J. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1996-2004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After transfection with pMev, the cells were grown in limiting concentrations of mevalonate: 50 μmlovastatin, 20 μm mevalonate. Under these conditions most of the control, untransfected cells died after a week, but many of the pMev-transfected cells survived and formed numerous colonies. A few of these clones were isolated and expanded. When tested for [3H]mevalonate uptake, up to 10-fold more 3H products were extracted from DKMev clones than from untransfected cells (Table I, DKMev clones). Alternatively, incorporation of [3H]mevalonate into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable protein was determined, in which case up to 60-fold more 3H was incorporated into zHMev clones than in controls (Table I, zHMev). In contrast, control cells that adapted to grow under limiting concentrations of mevalonate, accumulated as little mevalonate as untransfected cells (Table I, zH1 selected). Clones DKMev2 and zHMev6 were kept under limiting mevalonate conditions to maintain the expression of the transporter and used for further studies.Table IExpression of the mevalonate transporter in DK1 or zH1 cellsCell typeUptake1-aUptake of [3H]mevalonate determined by hexane:propanol extraction of whole cell lysates.Cell typeIncorporation1-bIncorporation of [3H]mevalonate into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable protein from whole cell lysates.cpmcpm/μg proteinDKMev112,396zHMev21602DKMev216,961zHMev31658DKMev37797zHMev41815DKMev48761zHMev51965DKMev53854zHMev64290DKMev69851zH1 (selected)1-cDK1 and zH1 are the parental cell lines. zH1 (selected) correspond to zH1 cells grown under selection conditions.72DK11-cDK1 and zH1 are the parental cell lines. zH1 (selected) correspond to zH1 cells grown under selection conditions.1595zH11-cDK1 and zH1 are the parental cell lines. zH1 (selected) correspond to zH1 cells grown under selection conditions.871-a Uptake of [3H]mevalonate determined by hexane:propanol extraction of whole cell lysates.1-b Incorporation of [3H]mevalonate into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable protein from whole cell lysates.1-c DK1 and zH1 are the parental cell lines. zH1 (selected) correspond to zH1 cells grown under selection conditions. Open table in a new tab Since GGPP is not a major intermediate in the synthesis of cholesterol, it was important to determine whether the internal pool of GGPP could be efficiently labeled by radioactive mevalonate. Analysis of post-translational processing under maintenance conditions indicated that more than 90% of Ha-Ras was processed (data not shown), but only 36% of Rap 1A proteins were processed (Fig. 1,lane 3). When cells were grown with increasing concentrations of mevalonolactone in the medium, the amount of processed Rap 1A protein increased (Fig. 1, lanes 2–6). At concentrations above 150 μm mevalonolactone, all the Ha-Ras (not shown) and Rap 1A were post-translationally processed, as indicated by the disappearance of the slower migrating band (Fig. 1,lane 6). Analysis of prenyl groups from total protein extracted from cells incubated at increasing concentrations of [3H]mevalonolactone (Fig. 2) showed an increase in the total amount of prenylated cysteines, as well as a higher increase in GG-Cys in comparison to F-Cys. Thus, when cells were labeled at low mevalonolactone concentration (33 μm, Fig.2) the amount of F-Cys was higher than GG-Cys (GG-Cys/F-Cys = 0.8). As the mevalonolactone concentration was increased, the amount of GG proteins also increased and the ratio GG-Cys/F-Cys became 1.8 at 250 μm (Fig. 2). These results are in agreement with previously published information, indicating that in the presence of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors like lovastatin, 20 μm mevalonate is enough for minimal synthesis of FPP and GGPP (14Rilling H.C. Bruenger E. Leining L. Buss J.E. Epstein W.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 210-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), while 200 μm mevalonate will maintain non-sterol isoprenoid synthesis as well (15Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 505-517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the cell culture medium contains serum, it is likely that no cholesterol synthesis is needed, and therefore all the FPP becomes available for prenylation of proteins as well as dolichol and ubiquinone synthesis. However, since GGPP is not a major precursor in the synthesis of cholesterol, it appears that not enough of it is made to prenylate all proteins. In other words, under the maintenance conditions described here, the endogenous pools of FPP and GGPP are practically depleted. Upon incubation with 250 μm [3H]mevalonolactone, the pools are reloaded but now with [3H]FPP and [3H]GGPP, which are then used for protein prenylation. Curiously, despite published data indicating that pMev does not transport mevalonolactone efficiently (10Faust J. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1996-2004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), no difference was found between the accumulation of radioactive lactone or acid after overnight incubations (data not shown).Figure 2Analysis of total protein prenylation.Whole cell lysates were subjected to Pronase digestion as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Prenyl cysteines were extracted and separated by HPLC.

The protocol was optimized using recombinant, in vitro prenylated Ki-Ras, Rho A, or Ha-Ras(CAIL). After in vitro prenylation, the proteins were digested with Pronase, the prenylated cysteines extracted into an organic phase, and then separated by HPLC. In the case of farnesylated Ki-Ras, a single peak of radioactivity at 23 min, coeluting with the F-Cys standard, was obtained (Fig. 3A,upper trace). For geranylgeranylated Ki-Ras, two peaks of radioactivity were observed, a major one at 36 min coeluting with GG-Cys standard and a minor peak eluting earlier, at 28 min (Fig.3A, lower trace). To confirm this pattern, two normally geranylgeranylated proteins, Rho A and Ha-Ras(CAIL) were labeled in vitro with [3H]GGPP and their prenylated peptides analyzed by HPLC. As seen in Fig. 3B, these two proteins present the same profile, namely a major peak at 36 min coeluting with GG-Cys standard and a smaller peak at 28 min. We have observed that the magnitude of the 28-min peak increases and the 36-min peak decreases with longer incubations in Pronase (data not shown). This suggests that the 28-min peak is a degradation product of GG-Cys, perhaps an oxide. To test this idea, the sulfoxide of GG-Cys was chemically synthesized, and it was found that, in fact, it elutes from HPLC at 28 min (data not shown). Nevertheless, the elution pattern of GG-Cys is very diagnostic regardless of whether the sample is derived from recombinant proteins prenylated in vitro or from whole cell lysate immunoprecipitation (see below). To identify Ki-Ras prenyl modification in vivo, DKMev cells were grown in [3H]mevalonolactone in the presence or absence of the FTase inhibitor B956 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In the absence of inhibitor, there is a single peak of radioactivity at 23 min, coeluting with F-Cys standard (Fig.A). In the presence of B956 from 0.2 to 100 μm, peaks corresponding to GG-Cys appear (Fig.4A). The radioactivity associated with F-Cys decreases significantly, in a dose-dependent manner, from 2 μm to 100 μm B956 treatment (Fig.4A). In contrast, the radioactivity associated with the two peaks of GG-Cys at 28 and 36 min increase at the same concentrations of B956 (Fig. 4A). Since the specific activity of the F and GG moieties is different, and the pools of FPP and GGPP are not known, it is not possible to obtain quantitative data from this experiment. Nevertheless, the appearance of a significant amount of GG-Cys in the presence of the inhibitor is indisputable. In contrast to the above data, when the prenylation of Ha-Ras was analyzed, only a peak corresponding to F-Cys was observed (Fig.4B). The amount of farnesylated Ha-Ras decreased with increasing concentrations of B956 (Fig. 4B). In agreement with previous data (12Nagasu T. Yoshimatsu K. Rowell C. Lewis M.D. Garcia A.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5310-5314PubMed Google Scholar), the farnesylation of Ha-Ras was more sensitive than Ki-Ras to inhibition by B956. In fact, at 0.2 μmB956 about half as much radioactivity as in the control eluted as F-Cys. Almost no Ha-Ras was farnesylated at 2 μm B956 (Fig. 4B). In contrast to Ki-Ras, no evidence that Ha-Ras can be geranylgeranylated was observed even at 100 μmB956. We previously reported that 0.5 μm B956 inhibits post-translational modification of Ha-Ras by 50% (12Nagasu T. Yoshimatsu K. Rowell C. Lewis M.D. Garcia A.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5310-5314PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, both Western blot (12Nagasu T. Yoshimatsu K. Rowell C. Lewis M.D. Garcia A.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5310-5314PubMed Google Scholar) and HPLC (this work) identification methods give comparable results for inhibition of Ha-Ras prenylation. We also reported that Ki-Ras prenylation was inhibited by 50% at 25 μm B956 (12Nagasu T. Yoshimatsu K. Rowell C. Lewis M.D. Garcia A.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5310-5314PubMed Google Scholar). However, this value was obtained by inhibition of [3H]mevalonate incorporation into Ki-Ras at low mevalonate concentration, where not enough GGPP was being synthesized. In view of the data presented here, that result is not valid. Unfortunately the correct concentration of B956 that inhibits Ki-Ras prenylation by 50% can not be determined here. B956 is not a very specific FTase inhibitor in vitro. It inhibits H-CAIL geranylgeranylation and Ha-Ras farnesylation equally with an IC50 of 20 nm. In contrast B957, the (trans, trans) isomer of B956, has similar potency against FTase, but it is more specific for FTase than GGTase in vitro with IC50 values of 40 nm (FTase) and 460 nm (GGTase I). The effect of B957 on Ki-Ras prenylation was also tested (Fig. 5). In this case, a similar inhibition of farnesylation was observed when compared with the effect of B956. Peaks corresponding to GG-Cys appeared after treatment with 2 μm or more B957, concurrent with a decrease in the F-Cys peak (Fig. 5). However, there seems to be more GG-Cys formation than when the cells were treated with B956. This is more evident if the ratios of radioactivity associated with the F-Cys and GG-Cys peaks are compared. Thus, at 2 μm either B956 or B957, the ratio F-Cys/GG-Cys is 0.9. When the concentration of inhibitor is increased to 20 μm, the F-Cys/GG-Cys ratio becomes 0.5 for B956 treatment and 0.26 for B957. At the highest concentration tested, 100 μm, the ratio is 0.3 for B956 and 0.1 for B957. These results indicate that B957 inhibits Ki-Ras farnesylation at least as efficiently as B956. However, B956 seems to inhibit both farnesylation and geranylgeranylation of Ki-Ras, while B957 inhibits only farnesylation. Conventional techniques were used to determine the identity of the prenyl group attached to Ras proteins, but they were modified with simpler protocols. Important modifications were the selection and maintenance of cells at very low mevalonate concentration and the identification of prenyl cysteines without cleavage of the prenyl group (1Casey P.J. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Buss J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8323-8327Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 16Farnsworth C.C. Gelb M.H. Glomset J.A. Science. 1990; 247: 320-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This latter modification eliminated technical difficulties and considerably shortened the time required for prenyl identification. It did introduce an artifact, the oxidation of GG-Cys, but since its presence depends on the length of incubation in Pronase, carefully controlling the conditions gives consistently reproducible results. On the other hand, selection of cells transfected with the pMev transporter in lovastatin and low mevalonate concentration allows the introduction of the transporter into any cell, regardless of whether they have been previously transfected. However, when cells were kept in 20 μm mevalonate, a large fraction of prenylated proteins were not post-translationally processed (Figs. 1 and 2). Despite the presence of non-prenylated proteins, the appearance and growth properties of the cells were apparently normal. This finding is surprising and indicates that either very little of these proteins is required for survival or that the prenylated proteins analyzed here are not necessary for cell growth. It has been previously reported in the literature that Ki-Ras is farnesylated in vivo (1Casey P.J. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Buss J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8323-8327Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). The work presented here confirms this finding, but it shows for the first time that Ki-Ras can also be geranylgeranylated in vivo. Under normal conditions, Ki-Ras is exclusively farnesylated. However, upon treatment of cells with FTase inhibitors like B956 and B957, in vivo farnesylation is inhibited and Ki-Ras is alternatively modified to a significant extent by geranylgeranylation. This effect is probably true for many FTase inhibitors, as indicated by their reduced effect on Ki-Ras transformed cells (12Nagasu T. Yoshimatsu K. Rowell C. Lewis M.D. Garcia A.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5310-5314PubMed Google Scholar, 17James G. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4454-4458Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In vitro data have indicated that Ki-Ras is a substrate for both FTase and GGTase I (8James G.L. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6221-6226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). However, the affinity of Ki-Ras for FTase is much higher than that for GGTase, suggesting that Ki-Ras will be preferentially farnesylated in vivo (8James G.L. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6221-6226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). 2K. Ackermann, N. Leshinsky, M. D. Lewis, and A. M. Garcia, unpublished data. We demonstrated here that this prediction is valid and that only when the conditions are altered, as in the presence of FTase inhibitors, does Ki-Ras become geranylgeranylated. Perhaps Ki-Ras plays a crucial role in maintaining cell growth and its alternative prenylation is a protective mechanism developed by the cells. Previous to this study, a major question has been whether it is possible to detect Ki-Ras-GG in cells. Reports by others have suggested that this might not be possible because labeling must be done under limiting concentrations of mevalonate (17James G. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4454-4458Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, geranylgeranylation of proteins is reduced compared with farnesylation (Ref. 14Rilling H.C. Bruenger E. Leining L. Buss J.E. Epstein W.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 210-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar and Figs. 1 and 2). However, when the cells were transferred to higher mevalonolactone concentration, the synthesis of FPP and GGPP was stimulated and normal protein prenylation resumed. Even though the specific activities of [3H]FPP and [3H]GGPP were lower than under limiting conditions, enough [3H]mevalonate was incorporated to adequately label FPP and GGPP. It should be mentioned that the reportedKm for mevalonate uptake by pMev is 300 μm (10Faust J. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1996-2004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, at the concentrations used here for cell labeling (250 μm), significantly more mevalonate is taken up than under limiting conditions (20 μm), counterbalancing the lower specific activity. The data presented here are in disagreement with a recently published article suggesting that Ki-Ras is normally geranylgeranylated (9Lerner E.C. Qian Y.M. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26770-26773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). This suggestion was based on data showing that Ki-Ras post-translational modification and signaling were inhibited by a specific GGTase I inhibitor, GGTI-286. We cannot explain this discrepancy. It is possible that the inhibitor used, although not very effective against Ha-Ras farnesylation, inhibits Ki-Ras farnesylation as efficiently as geranylgeranylation. Data on inhibition of Ki-Ras prenylation by GGTI-286 in vitro were not presented (9Lerner E.C. Qian Y.M. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26770-26773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). It will be important to identify the type of prenyl group modifying Ki-Ras in the presence of GGTI-286 to clarify this issue. Inhibition of post-translational processing of members of the Ras family has become very popular in recent years, because of the possibility of using the inhibitors as anticancer drugs (4Buss J.E. Marsters J.C. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 787-791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 18Gibbs J.B. Oliff A. Kohl N.E. Cell. 1994; 77: 175-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Up to this point, the emphasis has been on designing very specific inhibitors of FTase to avoid possible toxic effects originating from inhibition of the related GGTase I enzyme (19Kohl N.E. Mosser S.D. deSolms S.J. Giuliani E.A. Pompliano D.L. Graham S.L. Smith R.L. Scolnick E.M. Oliff A. Gibbs J.B. Science. 1993; 260: 1934-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 20Manne V.

Science. 1993; 260: 1937-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Thus, most compounds synthesized so far have been good inhibitors of Ha-Ras-transformed cells and not very potent against Ki-Ras-transformed cells. The lack of potency of FTase inhibitors against Ki-Ras-transformed cells could be explained by a failure to inhibit Ki-Ras post-translational processing by GGTase I. However, this explanation implies that Ki-Ras is the only factor controlling cell growth, and present evidence suggests that this might not be true. Although it has been shown that Ki-Ras-GG binds to SOS, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (22Porfiri E. Evans T. Chardin P. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22672-22677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it remains to be studied whether Ki-Ras-GG is functional in downstream events and whether it has the same role in cell growth as farnesylated Ki-Ras. The data presented here suggest that it is very important to further characterize the properties and functions of Ki-Ras. Nevertheless, the information gathered so far imply that it would be better to design prenylation inhibitors that can inhibit both farnesylation and geranylgeranylation of Ki-Ras for development as potential cancer drugs.

Dower S.K. Blood. 1995; 85: 3378-3404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, TNFR1, TNFR2, and CD40 modulate the expression of proinflammatory and costimulatory cytokines, cytokine receptors, and cell adhesion molecules through activation of the transcription factor NF-κB (2Tewari M. Dixit V. Curr. Opin. Genet. Devel. 1996; 6: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Some TNFR family members regulate also the AP-1 transcription factor, whose target genes are less well defined (3Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar). NF-κB is the prototype of a family of dimeric transcription factors whose subunits contain conserved Rel regions (4Baldwin A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). In its latent form, NF-κB is complexed with members of the IκB inhibitor family; upon inactivation of IκB in response to certain stimuli, released NF-κB translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to specific DNA sequences and activates gene transcription (4Baldwin A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). AP-1 represents a family of dimeric complexes composed of members of the Jun and Fos protein families (3Karin M. J.

For example, TRAF2 associates directly with TNFR2, CD40, and CD30 and plays a key role in NF-κB activation by these receptors (6Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V.

TRAF2 also mediates TNFR1 activation of NF-κB and of JNK, although it associates with TNFR1 indirectly, via the TRADD adaptor protein; TRADD signals apoptosis activation by TNFR1 as well (9Hsu H.

By using an expressed sequence tag (EST) approach, we have identified a member of the TNFR family that proved to be closely related to the recently isolated HVEM (18Montgomery R. Warner M. Lum B.

In the present study, we provide evidence suggesting that HVEM interacts with several members of the TRAF family and modulates activation of NF-κB, JNK, and AP-1. Human fetal and adult tissue poly(A) RNA blots (CLONTECH) were analyzed by Northern hybridization using a 32P-labeled cDNA probe containing the entire HVEM coding region. In addition, poly(A) RNA was prepared from purified human peripheral blood T cells (19Marsters S. Pitti R. Donahue C. Ruppert S. Bauer K. Ashkenazi A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 750-752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and from Jurkat T cells (ATCC) using a FastTrack kit (Invitrogen), and 50 ng of RNA were analyzed for HVEM expression by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using oligonucleotide primers that amplify a 240-base pair sequence in the putative extracellular region of HVEM. The cytoplasmic region of HVEM was cloned into the pGEX-2TK vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST), and subsequently purified by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography (20Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells (ATCC) were transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method with pRK5-based expression vectors encoding Flag epitope-tagged TRAFs 1, 2, 3, 5, or 6 (5 μg/10-cm dish). Total cell lysates were prepared 36 h later (7Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). Aliquots from each lysate were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with ∼1 μg of GST-HVEM fusion protein. Bound complexes were precipitated with glutathione-agarose beads, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and detected by immunoblot with anti-Flag monoclonal antibody (Eastman Kodak Co.) using the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system (Amersham). The interaction of GST-HVEM with endogenous TRAFs in nontransfected HEK293 cells was determined using a similar approach, except that the TRAFs were detected by sequential immunoblot with polyclonal anti-human TRAF1 or TRAF2 antibodies (21Shu H.-B.

M. Ayres and M. Rothe, unpublished results. The activation of NF-κB and AP-1 was analyzed by EMSA using oligonucleotide probes specific for each transcription factor. Nuclear extracts were prepared 24 h after transient transfection (22Marsters S.A. Pennica D. Bach E. Schreiber R.D. Ashkenazi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5401-5405Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) of HEK293 cells by HVEM or control expression plasmids (10 μg/10-cm dish). Aliquots from each extract (1 μg of total protein) were reacted (22Marsters S.A. Pennica D. Bach E. Schreiber R.D. Ashkenazi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5401-5405Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) with a32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe. For NF-κB, we used as a control a radioprobe based on a mutated NF-κB target sequence (plus strand sequence 5′-AGTTGAGGCGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′) (23Lenardo M.J. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 9-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar), or a radioprobe based on a wild type NF-κB target sequence (plus strand sequence 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′) (23Lenardo M.J. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 9-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar). For AP-1 we used a control radioprobe based on a mutated AP-1 target sequence (plus strand sequence 5′-CGCTTGATGACTTGGCCGGAA-3′) (24Lee W. Mitchell P. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 49: 52-741Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1365) Google Scholar), or a radioprobe based on a wild type AP-1 target sequence (plus strand sequence 5′-CGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAA-3′) (24Lee W. Mitchell P. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 49: 52-741Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). The reactions were subjected to PAGE and visualized by phosphorimager analysis (22Marsters S.A.

JNK activation was determined with a SAPK/JNK assay kit (New England Biolabs). Cell lysates were prepared 24 h after transient transfection of HEK293 cells by HVEM or control expression plasmids. JNK was precipitated with a GST-c-Jun fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. After washing, the kinase reaction was allowed to proceed in the presence of ATP, and was resolved by SDS-PAGE. Phospho-c-Jun was detected by immunoblot with antibody specific for c-Jun phosphorylated on Ser-63, a site important for transcriptional activity (5Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar), using chemiluminescence. TNFR family members share sequence homology primarily in their extracellular region, which contains three to six characteristic cysteine-rich pseudorepeats (1Gruss H.J. Dower S.K. Blood. 1995; 85: 3378-3404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Smith C.A. Farrah T. Goodwin R.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 62-959Google Scholar). To identify new members of the TNFR family, we searched the DNA data bases for ESTs that exhibit homology to individual TNFR family members. We identified a human retinal EST (GenBank locus AA021617), which upon translation showed homology to the cysteine-rich regions of several TNFR family proteins. To isolate the full-length cDNA, we screened a human retinal cDNA bacteriophage library (CLONTECH) by hybridization to a 60-base pair oligonucleotide probe based on a region of consensus between AA021617 and several related ESTs. We identified five independent positive clones containing cDNA inserts of 1.8–1.9 kb. Three of the inserts were subcloned into the pRK5 plasmid, and sequenced on both strands. The cDNA sequences were identical (with the exception of an intron found in one of the clones), and encoded a putative 283-amino acid transmembrane protein that showed significant extracellular sequence homology to the TNFR family (data not shown). Subsequently, a protein designated HVEM was reported independently (18Montgomery R. Warner M. Lum B. Spear P. Cell. 1996; 87: 427-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar), and turned out to be closely related to the protein we had identified. HVEM was isolated from a human HeLa cell cDNA library as a mediator of herpesvirus entry into mammalian cells; the cloning strategy was based on a functional screen of transfected cDNA clones for ability to confer herpesvirus sensitivity upon resistant cells (18Montgomery R. Warner M. Lum B. Spear P. Cell. 1996; 87: 427-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). The protein we identified and HVEM (18Montgomery R. Warner M. Lum B. Spear P. Cell. 1996; 87: 427-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar) differ, respectively, in two extracellular amino acid residues: codon 108 encodes a serine or a threonine, and codon 140 encodes an alanine or an arginine. These differences may be due to polymorphism in the HVEM gene; hence, we refer to both proteins here as HVEM. We investigated expression of the HVEM mRNA in human tissues by Northern blot hybridization (Fig. 1, A–C). We detected a major transcript of about 1.8 kb, which is similar to the size of our cDNA clones, in multiple fetal and adult tissues; this transcript was most highly expressed in adult spleen and peripheral blood leukocytes. A second transcript of about 3.8 kb, as well as some larger transcripts also were detected. In addition, we analyzed the expression of HVEM mRNA in peripheral T cells purified from human blood and in the human Jurkat T cell line by reverse transcriptase-PCR (Fig. 1 D). Both primary T cells and the T cell line expressed HVEM mRNA. The data of Fig. 1 B are consistent with the previous observation that HVEM mRNA is expressed in several non-lymphoid tissues (18Montgomery R. Warner M. Lum B. Spear P. Cell. 1996; 87: 427-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). However, our results demonstrate that in fact the predominant sites of HVEM mRNA expression are lymphocyte-rich tissues, i.e. spleen and peripheral blood leukocytes (Fig. 1 C), and show further that HVEM mRNA is expressed in purified T cells (Fig. 1 D) and in several fetal tissues (Fig. 1 A). To investigate whether HVEM interacts with TRAFs, we generated a GST fusion protein based on the cytoplasmic region of HVEM and tested its ability to co-precipitate five of the six known TRAFs upon their overexpression in HEK293 cells (Fig. 2, A andB). We observed strong association of HVEM with TRAF2; weaker association with TRAF5, TRAF3, and TRAF1; and no association with TRAF6. Consistent with these results, HVEM bound also to endogenous TRAFs in HEK293 cells, with a similar rank order (Fig.2 C). LTβR recognized the same set of endogenous TRAFs in HEK293 cells as did HVEM, while TNFR2 interacted mainly with TRAF2 and TRAF1 (Fig. 2 C). These results are intriguing, because the 58-amino acid cytoplasmic region of HVEM is related to the cytoplasmic domain of LTβR (11 identities), but shows no homology to the cytoplasmic region of TNFR2. CD40, another TNFR family member that shows significant cytoplasmic region homology to HVEM (12 identities), also interacts with TRAF2, TRAF3, and TRAF5 (7Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar, 11Hu H. O'Rourke K. Boguski M. Dixit V. J. Biol.

Science. 1995; 267: 1494-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), but unlike HVEM, it recognizes TRAF6 as well (16Ishida T. Mizishima S.I. Azuma S. Kobayashi N. Tojo T. Suzuki K. Aizawa S.

To explore possible HVEM-regulated signaling pathways, we investigated whether transfection of HEK293 cells by HVEM affects NF-κB activity (Fig. 3). Cells transfected by a pRK5-based HVEM expression plasmid showed significant NF-κB activation relative to cells transfected by pRK5 alone (Fig. 3 A). For comparison, we tested two other TNFR family members that have been shown previously to activate NF-κB, namely TNFR1 and Apo-3/DR-3/WSL-1 (2Tewari M. Dixit V. Curr. Opin. Genet. Devel. 1996; 6: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 26Marsters S. Sheridan J. Donahue C. Pitti R. Gray C. Goddard A. Bauer K. Ashkenazi A. Curr.

Nature. 1996; 384: 372-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar); the level of NF-κB activation by these receptors was similar to the level of activation by HVEM (Fig. 3 A). A specific antibody to the p65/RelA subunit of NF-κB, but not preimmune serum, inhibited the mobility of the NF-κB probe in the case of each receptor (Fig.3 B). Hence, the NF-κB complexes activated by HVEM, TNFR1, and Apo-3 in HEK293 cells appear to contain the p65/RelA protein (Fig.3 B). These results indicate that HVEM is linked to an NF-κB activation pathway. It is possible that interaction of HVEM with TRAF2 and/or TRAF5 (Fig. 2) mediates the NF-κB activation, since these TRAFs are key to NF-κB activation by other related TNFR family members (see above). Next, we investigated whether transfection of HEK293 cells by HVEM activates JNK, as well as the transcription factor AP-1, which is activated through JNK-mediated phosphorylation of Jun proteins (Fig.4). HVEM-transfected cells showed marked JNK activation as compared with cells transfected by pRK5 alone (Fig. 4 A); the level of activation was comparable to the level induced by TNFR1 transfection. Consistent with JNK activation, HVEM-transfected cells showed AP-1 activation as well (Fig. 4 B). Anti-Jun D antibody, but not preimmune serum, inhibited the migration of the AP-1-specific probe (Fig. 4 C), suggesting that Jun D participates in the AP-1 complexes activated by HVEM in HEK293 cells. These results indicate that HVEM is coupled to the JNK/AP-1 signaling pathway. The interaction of HVEM with TRAF2 (Fig. 2) may contribute to JNK/AP-1 activation by HVEM, since TRAF2 plays a key role in mediating JNK activation by TNFR1 (10Liu Z. Hsu H. Goeddel D. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). However, it remains to be established which TRAFs signal NF-κB and JNK/AP-1 activation by HVEM. Using an EST-based approach, we have identified a novel member of the human TNFR family. Montgomery et al. (18Montgomery R. Warner M. Lum B. Spear P. Cell. 1996; 87: 427-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar) isolated a closely related protein, HVEM, as an entry receptor for herpesvirus. There are only two amino acid differences between the two receptors, suggesting that these proteins may be encoded by a single, polymorphic HVEM gene. Our results provide an important step toward understanding the physiological function of HVEM. HVEM associates with members of the TRAF family and activates JNK/SAPK, as well as the transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1, which control expression of multiple immune, inflammatory, and acute phase action genes in response to infection or cellular stress (3Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar, 4Baldwin A. Annu. Rev.

The induction of NF-κB and AP-1 by HVEM, together with the relatively abundant expression of HVEM mRNA in T cells and in lymphocyte-rich tissues, suggests that HVEM is involved in regulating lymphocyte activation."

STAT3, a transcription factor for acute phase response genes, was found to act as an adapter molecule in signal transduction from the type I interferon receptor. STAT3 bound to a conserved sequence in the cytoplasmic tail of the IFNAR1 chain of the receptor and underwent interferon-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation. The p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, which activates a series of serine kinases, bound to phosphorylated STAT3 and subsequently underwent tyrosine phosphorylation.

https://openalex.org/W2121735022,"In neonatal rat ventricular myocytes, stimulation of the α1-adrenergic receptor (α1-AdrR) activates a program of genetic and morphological changes characterized by transcriptional activation of the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) gene and enlargement (hypertrophy) of the cells. The low molecular weight GTPase Ras has been established as an important regulator of hypertrophy bothin vitro and in vivo. Ras activates a kinase cascade involving Raf, the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), and the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK). However, the extent of involvement of this pathway in regulating hypertrophic responses is controversial. We demonstrate here that both α1-AdrR stimulation and Ras can also activate the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) in cardiomyocytes. The α1-AdrR effect on JNK occurs through a pathway requiring Ras and MEK kinase (MEKK). A constitutively activated mutant of MEKK that preferentially activates JNK, stimulates ANF reporter gene expression, while a dominant negative MEKK mutant inhibits ANF expression induced by PE. Furthermore, JNK activity is increased in the ventricles of mice overexpressing oncogenic Ras, whereas ERK activity is not. These results suggest that the α1-AdrR mediates ANF gene expression through a Ras-MEKK-JNK pathway and that activation of this pathway is associated with in vitro and in vivo hypertrophy.

The hypertrophic response is further characterized by increases in cell size and organization of myofilaments into sarcomeric units (reviewed in Ref.1Chien K.R. Knowlton K.U. Zhu H. Chien S. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Ras, a low molecular weight GTPase known to transduce mitogenic signals from growth factor-activated tyrosine kinase receptors, has been shown to be required for α1-AdrR-mediated ANF gene expression, increases in cell size and myofilament organization (2Thorburn A.

Evidence for the involvement of Ras comes from studies in which microinjection of a dominant-interfering Ras expression vector blocked α1-AdrR-induced increases in ANF protein and cell size (2Thorburn A.

Furthermore expression of oncogenic Ras in transgenic mice results in the development of pathological hypertrophy (3Hunter J.J. Tanaka N. Rockman H.A. Ross Jr., J. Chien K.R. J. Biol.

Ras activates the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway in a number of cell systems. This pathway has been linked to cell proliferation and growth regulation. Studies from several laboratories have implicated Raf (5Thorburn J. McMahon M. Thorburn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30580-30586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), MEK (6Gillespie-Brown J.

On the other hand, ERK1 and ERK2 are activated by agonists (e.g. carbachol and ATP) that fail to induce ANF expression or myofilament organization (10Post G.R. Goldstein D. Thuerauf D. Glembotski C.C. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8452-8457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In addition, expression of activated MEK, the kinase that activates the ERKs, failed to induce ANF expression and paradoxically inhibited it (11Thorburn J. Carlson M. Mansour S.J. Chien K.R. Ahn N.G. Thorburn A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1479-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that activation of the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway alone is insufficient to transduce the α1-AdrR-induced hypertrophic responses. Ras can also couple to and activate MEKK (12Russell M.

Science. 1994; 265: 1458-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). This kinase was originally described as an activator of the MEK-ERK cascade (14Lange-Carter C.A. Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar) but has more recently been shown to activate JNKK, a dual specificity kinase that phosphorylates and activates JNK, another member of the MAP kinase superfamily (15Lin A.

JNK, in turn, phosphorylates c-Jun which dimerizes with c-Fos to activate AP-1-dependent gene transcription (18Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar). The role of the MEKK-JNKK-JNK pathway in regulating cardiomyocyte hypertrophy has not been extensively studied. Recent studies in myocytes demonstrate that cellular stressors can activate JNK (19Bogoyevitch M.A. Ketterman A.J. Sugden P.H. J. Biol.

Additionally, transfection of myocytes with activated MEKK and JNKK has been shown to increase cell size and ANF transcriptional activation (21Bogoyevitch M.A. Gillespie-Brown J. Ketterman A.J.

We have investigated the effects of α1-AdrR stimulation on activation of the MEKK-JNK signaling cascade. Our data demonstrate that PE causes a sustained activation of JNK and that the resultant increase in c-Jun transcriptional activity is dependent on Ras and MEKK. We show that MEKK, rather than Raf, is a mediator of PE-induced ANF gene expression. Increased JNK activity is also detected in the ventricles of transgenic Ras mice, whereas ERK activities are not elevated above those in control mice. We propose that the maintenance of elevated JNK activity is important in the development of the hypertrophic state in vitro as well as in vivo. Neonatal ventricular myocytes were cultured from 1- to 3-day-old Harlan Sprague Dawley rats as described previously (22Iwaki K. Sukhatme V.P. Shubeita H.E. Chien K.R. J. Biol.

Trisected hearts were dissociated by treatment with collagenase II (Worthington) and pancreatin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and myocytes were purified by centrifugation through a discontinuous Percoll gradient. Cells were plated at a density of 4 × 104/cm2 on gelatin-coated tissue culture dishes and maintained overnight in 4:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/medium 199 (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% horse serum, 5% fetal calf serum, and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). Myocytes plated on 100-mm dishes were serum-starved for 24 h, washed twice with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and incubated with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 3 h. Cells were stimulated with 100 μm phenylephrine plus 2 μmpropranolol for various times and lysed in a 0.5% Nonidet P-40 buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmNaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm Na3VO4. Lysates were cleared of unincorporated [32P]orthophosphate using activated charcoal. Ras was immunoprecipitated with a rat anti-Ras antibody (Y13-259, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) in conjunction with a rabbit anti-rat secondary antibody and protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Labeled GDP and GTP were eluted from the immunocomplexes with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mm EDTA, 2% SDS, 0.5 mm GDP, and 0.5 mm GTP and separated by thin layer chromatography (Bakerflex PEI-F cellulose TLC plates). The data were visualized by autoradiography, and the intensity of the spots on the film was analyzed by densitometry. The following constitutively activated plasmid constructs were used: Ras (G12V), Ras (Q61L), Raf-1 (BXB), a truncated form of Raf-1 lacking amino acids 26–303 in the regulatory domain, and MEKKΔ, a truncated form of MEKK lacking amino acids 1–351. Dominant negative constructs used include Ras (T17N), Raf-1 (K375R), and MEKKΔ (K432M). The ANF reporter gene was a 638-base pair fragment of the 5′-flanking region of the rat ANF promoter cloned upstream of firefly luciferase cDNA (23Knowlton K.U. Baracchini E. Ross R.S. Harris A.N.

Myocytes were washed extensively and incubated for an additional 48 h in serum-free medium alone or with PE. Luciferase activity was measured, normalized to protein concentration as determined by Bradford analysis, and used as an index of gene expression. For assaying endogenous kinase activity, cells were plated on 60-mm dishes, serum-starved for 24 h, and then mock-stimulated or stimulated with PE. To examine the effect of activated Ras on JNK activity, myocytes plated on 100-mm dishes were cotransfected with Leu-61 Ras and SRα-HA-JNK1 and then washed extensively and cultured in maintenance media for 48 h. Cell lysates were then prepared and kinase activities assayed as described previously (28Sah V.P. Hoshijima M. Chien K.R. Brown J.H. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells were harvested in lysis buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and kinases were immunoprecipitated using either mouse monoclonal 12CA5 anti-HA antibodies (Boehringer Mannheim) or rabbit polyclonal anti-JNK1, ERK1, or ERK2 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) conjugated to protein A-Sepharose. The kinase assays were then carried out at 30 °C for 15 min (ERK) or 20 min (JNK) using [γ-32P]ATP and substrate (myelin basic protein (Sigma) for ERK or GST-c-Jun-(1–79) for JNK). Phosphorylated substrates were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. 32P incorporation was quantitated by radioanalytic scanning (AMBIS). Cell lysates (50 μg of protein) from above were boiled in Laemmli buffer and resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) and probed with a rabbit polyclonal anti-JNK1 antibody which is more specific for JNK1 but also recognizes the JNK2 isoform. Membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Sigma) and visualized by chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Corp.). Adult myosin light chain-2v-Val-12 Ras mice (3Hunter J.J. Tanaka N. Rockman H.A. Ross Jr., J. Chien K.R. J. Biol.

Left ventricles were dissected and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen ventricles were powdered and homogenized in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 3 mm EDTA, and 3 mm EGTA plus protease inhibitors (100 μm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and then lysed in a similar buffer with the addition of 250 mm NaCl, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. It is well-established that Ras mediates PE-induced ANF expression (2Thorburn A. Thorburn J. Chen S.-Y. Powers S. Shubeita H.E. Feramisco J.R. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2244-2249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To directly establish that stimulation of the α1-AdrR causes activation of Ras, myocytes were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and treated with or without PE for short times. Ras was then isolated and the proportion of GTP-bound Ras determined. The amount of Ras in its GTP-bound (activated) state increased by 35% after 1 min of agonist stimulation (Fig.1). This increase, although small, was reproducible and was sustained for at least 10 min. Multiple signaling pathways can be activated downstream of Ras. These include the Raf-MEK-ERK cascade and the more recently characterized MEKK-JNKK-JNK cascade. We have previously shown that PE stimulates ERK activity in myocytes (10Post G.R. Goldstein D. Thuerauf D. Glembotski C.C. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8452-8457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To determine if α1-AdrR stimulation also activates JNK, we examined the effects of PE on JNK activity. Myocytes were treated in the absence or presence of PE for various times, and JNK was immunoprecipitated and assayed for its ability to phosphorylate its substrate GST-c-Jun. Induction of JNK activity was observed following 20 min of PE stimulation, and its activation level was sustained through 48 h (Fig. 2, A and B). Immunoblotting using an anti-JNK antibody demonstrated that the observed increase in JNK activity was not associated with an increase in JNK protein levels even at long times of PE stimulation (Fig. 2C). These data indicate that PE activates existing JNK rather than increasing its expression. To determine if oncogenic Ras also activates JNK, constitutively activated (Leu-61) Ras was cotransfected into myocytes along with HA-tagged JNK1. As shown in Fig. 3, Leu-61 Ras caused a significant activation of HA-JNK1, increasing its activity 8-fold above basal. Leu-61 Ras was also an effective activator of HA-ERK2, stimulating its activity 20-fold above control (data not shown). These data clearly demonstrate that JNK can be activated by both PE and Ras and prompted our further investigation concerning the pathway for JNK activation.Figure 3Activated Ras stimulates JNK activity.Myocytes were transfected with 10 μg of SRα3 (control) or activated (Leu-61) Ras (Ras*) together with 3 μg of SRα-HA-JNK1. The HA-tagged kinase was immunoprecipitated, and activity was assayed by assessing incorporation of [γ-32P]ATP into GST-c-Jun-(1–79). Data are from two experiments performed in duplicate and are represented as the average fold stimulation ± S.E. of kinase activities over vector control-transfected samples. A representative autoradiogram from one of the experiments is shown in the inset; the two left lanes are control-transfected samples, and the two right lanes are Leu-61 Ras-transfected samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since PE and Leu-61 Ras both increased JNK activity, we sought to establish whether PE activated JNK through its effect on Ras. To address this question, we employed an assay that uses c-Jun transcriptional activity as a readout for JNK activation in transiently transfected cells. c-Jun transcriptional activity is stimulated following its phosphorylation by JNK at Ser-63 and Ser-73 (29Smeal T. Binetruy B. Mercola D.A. Birrer M. Karin M. Nature. 1991; 354: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 30Smeal T. Binetruy B. Mercola D.A. Heidecker G. Rapp U. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3507-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Thus the α1-AdrR-induced increases in JNK activity should result in induction of c-Jun transcriptional activity. Phenylephrine stimulated the expression of a GAL4-luciferase reporter gene that was responsive to a GAL4-c-Jun-(1–223) fusion protein containing the c-Jun transactivation domain. This stimulation was completely inhibited by coexpression of dominant negative (Asn-17) Ras (Table I), indicating that the effects of PE are mediated through Ras. The stimulation of c-Jun transcriptional activity by PE was dependent on c-Jun phosphorylation since PE failed to stimulate the activity of a mutant GAL4-c-Jun-(1–223;A63/73) fusion protein in which the serines normally phosphorylated by JNK were replaced by alanines (data not shown). To determine if the protein kinase cascade that leads to activation of JNKs is dependent on MEKK, we asked whether PE-induced c-Jun transcriptional activity (and hence JNK activation) was inhibited by dominant negative MEKK. Coexpression of a dominant negative mutant of MEKK along with the GAL4-luciferase reporter gene abolished PE-induced c-Jun transcriptional activity (Table I). In parallel experiments, we found that coexpression of dominant negative Raf paradoxically elevated the basal GAL4-luciferase activity; nonetheless, there was little decrease in the fold stimulation of GAL4-luciferase by PE (data not shown). These data indicate that PE stimulates JNK activity, leading to the phosphorylation and transcriptional activation of c-Jun, and that these events are dependent on Ras and MEKK but not Raf.Table IDominant negative Ras and dominant negative MEKK inhibit PE-induced c-Jun transcriptional activationPlasmidGAL4-luciferase expression (% maximal)Control+PEVector (SRα3)4.5 ± 1.3100.0 ± 7.1dn-Ras7.7 ± 2.514.6 ± 2.0Vector (SRα3)13.9 ± 5.2100.0 ± 13.0dn-MEKK6.1 ± 1.57.3 ± 1.4Myocytes in 6-well plates were transfected with 4.8 μg of vector (SRα3), dominant negative (Asn-17) Ras (dn-Ras), or dominant negative MEKK (dn-MEKK), 1.8 μg of 5×GAL4-luciferase, and 20 ng of GAL4-c-Jun-(1–223).

Data are expressed as percent maximal stimulation of GAL4-luciferase expression (in the presence of PE) and are the mean ± S.E. of four experiments performed in triplicate. MEKK was originally identified as an alternative to Raf in activating MEK, leading to the activation of the ERKs (14Lange-Carter C.A. Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). However, it is now clear that Raf is a more specific activator of the ERK pathway and MEKK is a more specific activator of the JNK pathway (16Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I.

Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). To determine the effects of activated MEKK and activated Raf on ANF expression in cardiomyocytes, we coexpressed activated MEKK or activated Raf with the ANF-luciferase reporter gene. As shown in Table II, both activated MEKK and activated Raf stimulated ANF reporter expression, although the stimulation by activated MEKK was greater than that by activated Raf even when a 10-fold lower amount of activated MEKK cDNA was utilized.Table IIBoth activated Raf and activated MEKK stimulate ANF gene expressionPlasmidANF-luciferase expressionfold stimulation3 μg Raf*6.7 ± 2.40.3 μg MEKK*21.4 ± 3.53 μg MEKK*22.0 ± 6.5Myocytes in 60-mm dishes were cotransfected with 3 μg of the ANF reporter gene and the indicated amounts of activated Raf (Raf*) or activated MEKK (MEKK*). After 48 h in serum-free medium, luciferase activity from cell lysates was measured and normalized to protein concentration. The data are the mean fold stimulation ± S.E. of 6–12 determinations. Open table in a new tab Myocytes in 60-mm dishes were cotransfected with 3 μg of the ANF reporter gene and the indicated amounts of activated Raf (Raf*) or activated MEKK (MEKK*). After 48 h in serum-free medium, luciferase activity from cell lysates was measured and normalized to protein concentration. The data are the mean fold stimulation ± S.E. of 6–12 determinations. The observation that activated MEKK and activated Raf both stimulate ANF expression does not indicate whether PE-induced cardiac gene expression is dependent on MEKK or Raf or both. To address this question, myocytes were transfected with empty vector or vector encoding dominant interfering Raf-1 or dominant interfering MEKK along with the ANF reporter gene and subsequently stimulated with PE. Dominant interfering Raf-1 failed to block PE-mediated ANF-luciferase expression, although it was able to inhibit the response to activated (Val-12) Ras (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, dominant negative MEKK significantly inhibited PE- and Ras-induced ANF reporter gene expression (Fig. 4, A andB). These data suggest that PE mediates its effects on ANF gene expression, in addition to its effects on JNK (Table I), through MEKK rather than Raf. It has recently been shown that ventricular expression of Val-12 Ras in mice induces cardiac hypertrophy characterized by increased ratios of left ventricular weight to body weight and increased ventricular ANF expression (3Hunter J.J. Tanaka N. Rockman H.A. Ross Jr., J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23173-23178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The left ventricles of 6-week-old transgenic Ras and wild-type (control) mice were rapidly isolated, frozen, homogenized, and subjected to kinase assays to determine JNK, ERK1, and ERK2 activities. Tissue from six Ras animals and four control animals were analyzed. JNK activity was consistently higher in the tissue from Ras animals; however, no difference was observed in either ERK1 or ERK2 activity (Fig. 5). These data demonstrate that constitutive activation of Ras in vivo correlates with increased JNK, but not ERK, activity. Hypertrophic agents such as the α1-AdrR agonist PE activate a program of genetic and morphological changes in terminally differentiated cardiac myocytes. The PE-induced hypertrophic responses have been shown to be Ras-dependent (2Thorburn A. Thorburn J. Chen S.-Y. Powers S. Shubeita H.E. Feramisco J.R. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2244-2249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this, we find that PE increases the amount of GTP-bound Ras and hence the activity of Ras. These data confirm findings reported by Thorburn's laboratory (31Thorburn J. Thorburn A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 1586-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and raised the question as to the effector(s) of Ras involved in regulating hypertrophic responses. Stimulation of cardiomyocytes with PE activates the ERKs (32Bogoyevitch M.A. Glennon P.E. Sugden P.H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 317: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 33Thorburn A. Biochem.

Our current data demonstrate that while constitutively activated Raf can induce ANF expression, a dominant negative mutant displays no inhibitory effect on PE-induced ANF expression. As a result, activation of an additional signaling pathway would appear to be necessary for the transduction of PE-evoked signals leading to hypertrophy. The JNK family of MAP kinases can be activated via heterotrimeric G proteins (34Coso O.A. Chiarello M. Kalinec G. Kyriakis J.M. Woodgett J. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol.

Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar), it is now evident that it does not simply regulate these pathological states. In cardiac myocytes, we demonstrate that α1-AdrR stimulation increases JNK activity within 20 min of PE treatment and that JNK activity remains elevated for at least 48 h. This is in contrast to the ERKs, which have been shown to be maximally activated at 5 min, declining to basal levels thereafter (8Bogoyevitch M.A. Andersson M.B. Gillespie-Brown J. Clerk A. Glennon P.E. Fuller S.J. Sugden P.H. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 10Post G.R. Goldstein D. Thuerauf D. Glembotski C.C. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8452-8457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). That the kinetics of JNK activation is slower than that of the ERKs is in agreement with other published findings (19Bogoyevitch M.A. Ketterman A.J. Sugden P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29710-29717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 34Coso O.A. Chiarello M. Kalinec G. Kyriakis J.M. Woodgett J. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5620-5624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The differences in activation kinetics may be explained by recent data that demonstrate that JNK activation induces MAP kinase phosphatase-1 activity, correlating with down-regulation of ERK activity (44Bokemeyer D. Sorokin A. Yan M. Ahn N.G. Templeton D.J. Dunn M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 639-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The maintenance of JNK activation may be important in the progression of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, since the accompanying genetic and morphological changes are not triggered immediately but rather take hours to develop. Our findings indicate that MEKK is a critical intermediate in PE-induced JNK activation and ANF expression. We have shown that activation of the GAL4-c-Jun hybrid transcription factor by PE, presumably via JNK-induced phosphorylation, is dependent on both Ras and MEKK. In examining the role of MEKK in cardiac gene expression, we found that constitutively activated MEKK increased ANF expression, and a dominant negative mutant of MEKK significantly inhibited PE-induced ANF reporter expression. Our results indicate a role for the MEKK-JNK signaling pathway in regulating α1-AdrR-induced ANF expression and in serving as a downstream mediator of signals generated through Ras in cardiomyocytes. In vivo studies using transgenic Ras mice support this conclusion. These data show that JNK, but not ERK, activity is elevated, relative to control, in the hypertrophic left ventricles of these mice. Although kinase activity was measured in homogenates of whole left ventricles, the myosin light chain-2v promoter driving expression of the Val-12 ras transgene is specific for ventricular myocytes; thus, we believe that the observed kinase activity changes reflect those that occur in myocytes. Since the kinetics of ERK and JNK activation differ in the in vitro myocyte culture system, their activation kinetics might also differin vivo; thus we cannot rule out that ERK activity is increased transiently in the course of development of hypertrophy, whereas JNK activity remains elevated. Nonetheless, our data indicate that constitutive activation of Ras in the mouse heart ventricle leads either directly or indirectly to stimulation of cardiomyocyte JNK activity. That JNK activation and hypertrophy are related events is further supported by studies using transverse aortic constriction to induce cardiac pressure overload in mice. In this mouse model, left ventricular hypertrophy is evident at 7 days post-banding, and JNK activity is also observed to be significantly increased. 2L. Mao, J. Ross, Jr., V. P. Sah, and J. H. Brown, unpublished data. The extent to which JNK activation is the cause or effect of the associated hypertrophy remains to be determined. If elevation of JNK activity is sufficient to induce hypertrophy, then we expect that transgenic mice expressing activated MEKK would also exhibit a hypertrophic phenotype and that hypertrophy induced by pressure overload will be blunted in JNK knockout mice. We are currently investigating these possibilities. We thank Dr. M. Karin for his generosity in providing advice and reagents for this work. We thank Drs. G. Johnson, U. Rapp, and M.

https://openalex.org/W2147192624,"We have studied the role of Jun/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) pathway in DNA repair and cisplatin resistance in T98G glioblastoma cells. JUN/SAPK is activated by DNA damage and phosphorylates serines 63 and 73 in the N-terminal domain of c-Jun, which is known to increase its transactivation properties. We show that treatment of T98G glioblastoma cells with cisplatin but not the transplatin isomer activates JNK/SAPK about 10-fold. T98G cells, which are highly resistent to cisplatin (IC50 = 140 ± 13 μm), modified to express a nonphosphorylatable dominant negative c-Jun (termed dnJun) exhibit decreased viability following treatment with cisplatin, but not transplatin, in proportion (rPearson = 0.98) to the level of dnJun expressed leading to a 7-fold decreased IC50. Similar effects are observed in U87 cells, PC-3 cells, and MCF-7 cells, as well as in T98G cells modified to express TAM-67, a known inhibitor of c-Jun function. In contrast, no sensitization effect was observed in cells modified to express wild-type c-Jun. Furthermore, through quantitative polymerase chain reaction-stop assays, we show that dnJun expressing cells were inhibited in repair of cisplatin adducts (p = 0.55), whereas repair is readily detectable (p = 0.003) in parental cells. These observations indicate that the JNK/SAPK pathway is activated by cisplatin-induced DNA damage and that this response is required for DNA repair and viability following cisplatin treatment.

These observations suggest that the JNK/SAPK pathway may mediate a physiological response to DNA damage such as induction of one or more DNA repair enzymes. Here we provide evidence that the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin, which damages DNA through the formation of bifunctional platinum adducts, but not transplatin, which does not damage DNA (19Sherman S.E. Gibson D. Wang A.H. Lippard S.J. Science. 1985; 230: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 20Zamble D.B. Lippard S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 435-439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), activates JNK/SAPK up to 10-fold in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, inhibition of this pathway in cells modified by expression of a nonphosphorylatable dominant negative mutant of c-Jun, dnJun, blocks DNA repair as judged by quantitative PCR and markedly decreases viability following treatment with cisplatin but not transplatin. Thus, JNK/SAPK is activated by cisplatin-induced DNA damage and is required for DNA repair and survival following cisplatin treatment. c-Jun N-terminal kinase activator protein complex 1 cisplatin,cis-diaminodichloroplatinum stress-activated protein kinase micro-tetrazolium (dye) test transplatin,trans-diaminodichloroplatinum ultraviolet light C band 254 nm maximum intensity for UV cross-linker 1800 dominant negative c-Jun polymerase chain reaction kilobase pair activation transcription factor cAMP response element binding protein (3-(4,5′-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxylphenyl-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium inner salt. Culture conditions and all cell lines and plasmids used here were developed using standard methods as described previously (22Mercola D.A. Carpenter P. Grover-Bardwick A. Mercola M. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1793-1803PubMed Google Scholar, 23Potapova O. Fakhrai H. Baird S. Mercola D. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 280-286PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of c-Jun and dnJun was quantitated using the methods (24Grover-Bardwick A. Adamson E. Mercola D. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 1667-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and antibodies previously characterized (24Grover-Bardwick A. Adamson E. Mercola D. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 1667-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The PCR-stop assay (28Horton J. Srivastava D. Zmudzka B. Wilson S.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3810-3815Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) was used to quantitate cisplatin-DNA adduct formation and subsequent repair. The assay is based on the observation that the efficiency of amplification of cisplatin-treated DNA is inversely proportional to the degree of platination. Genomic DNA was isolated immediately or 6 h after treatment of cells for 1 h 15 min with varying amounts of cisplatin and amplified quantitatively using32P-end-labeled primers, giving rise to a 2.7-kb and a nested 0.15-kb fragment of the hyopxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase gene. The 5′ and 3′ primers were TGGGATTACACGTGTGAACCAACC and GATCCACAGTCTGCCTGAGTCACT, respectively, with a 5′ nested primer of CCTAGAAAGCACATGGAGAGCTAG. The 0.15-kb segment of genomic DNA sustains undetectable levels of DNA damage under our conditions and serves as an internal PCR control and the basis for normalization of the amount of amplification of the 2.7-kb fragment. The number of lesions/2.7-kb fragment (i.e. Fig. 4) is calculated as 1 − (cpm damaged DNA/cpm undamaged DNA) (8Adler V. Fuchs S., Y. Kim J. Kraft A. King M., P. Pelling J. Ronai Z. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 1437-1446PubMed Google Scholar). JNK assays were carried out exactly as described previously (7Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). Viability (29Gjerset R. Turla S. Sobol R. Scalise J. Mercola D. Collins H. Isabella P. Mol. Carcinogen. 1995; 14: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) was assessed by the addition of cisplatin or transplatin for 1 h one day after seeding test cells into 96-well plates followed by a change of medium to fresh medium and determination of surviving cells 5 days later by addition of MTS for 1 h and determination of A590 nm of the dissolved formazan product as described by the manufacturer (Promega). All results were carried out in quadruplicate, and viability is expressed as the ratio of the amount of viable cells following cisplatin or transplatin treatment to that of the same cells without treatment. It is known that cisplatin but not transplatin forms covalent covalent cross-links between the N7 position of adjacent guanine or adjacent adenine-guanine residues (19Sherman S.E. Gibson D. Wang A.H. Lippard S.J. Science. 1985; 230: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 20Zamble D.B. Lippard S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 435-439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). We find that the JNK activity of T98G cells is elevated in a dose-dependent manner up to 10-fold following a 1-h exposure to cisplatin but not to transplatin (Fig.1 A). As a positive control of the effects of a DNA-damaging agent, we examined the response of JNK of T98G cells to UV-C irradiation (Fig. 1 B) and observed a similar dose-response relationship. Cisplatin-specific responses have been observed in other cell lines from tumor types that are commonly refractory to cisplatin treatment such as the human nonsmall cell lung carcinoma lines A549 (data not shown) and M103 (Fig. 1 C). Moreover, 1 h after treatment with cisplatin, but not transplatin, JNK activity of T98G cells or lung carcinoma cells M103 remains elevated, suggesting that treatment with cisplatin leads to a prolonged response. These results indicate that only the DNA-damaging cisplatin isomer activates JNK activity. We developed clonal lines of human T98G glioblastoma cells, which stably express a dominant negative inhibitor (1Smeal T. Binétruy B. Mercola D.A. Birrer M. Karin M.

The effect of cisplatin treatment on the viability of representative clonal lines of the dnJun-expressing T98G cells is compared with that of an empty vector control line, T98GLHCX, in Fig. 2 A. The viability of empty vector control T98G cells remains largely unaffected by treatment with increasing concentrations of cisplatin even at doses of ≥70 μm. Extended titrations revealed IC50values of 147 and 154 μm for the parental cells and empty vector control cells, respectively (Table I). In contrast, the dnJun expressing cells exhibit an IC50 as low as 21 μm (Fig. 2 A) or over 7-fold more sensitive to cisplatin than the control cells (Table I). Replicate experiments using additional clones that exhibit varying amounts of steady state dnJun indicate the sensitization to cisplatin is proportional (rPearson = 0.98) to the amount of dnJun expressed (Fig. 2 B). Transplatin has no discernible effect at concentrations where the viability following treatment with cisplatin is less than 25% (Fig. 3 B) and in extended titrations no significant effect at 250 μm, indicating that the requirements for sensitization by dnJun depends upon the stereospecific DNA-binding properties of cisplatin, similar to the conditions for the activation of JNK.Table ISensitization of human tumor lines to cisplatin-induced cytotoxicityCellControl1-aIn all cases parental and empty vector cells were analyzed in parallel and with equal concentrations of cisplatin and transplatin in the range 0–250 μm all in quadruplicate.

None of the cell lines examined here were made cisplatin-resistant prior to analysis. Expression of wild-type c-Jun does not mimic dnJun-expressing cells (Fig. 2 A). In fact, the viability of these cells when treated with cisplatin is somewhat increased relative to parental or empty vector control cells for all viability determinations in the range 20–60 μm cisplatin, suggesting that increased JNK substrate augmented viability following treatment with cisplatin (Fig. 2 A). Thus, the sensitization to cisplatin observed for the dnJun-expressing cells appears to correlate with interference in the role of activated c-Jun. We have tested the generality of the sensitizing properties of dnJun in PC3 prostate carcinoma cells modified to express dnJun under the control of an inducible truncated metallothionein promoter as described previously (21Brown P.H. Chen T.K. Birrer M.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 791-799PubMed Google Scholar). Viability studies show that parental or empty vector control cells are largely insensitive to cisplatin at concentrations ≤60 μm (Fig. 3 A,circles). Extended titrations revealed IC50values of 109 and 156 μm for the parental and empty vector control cells, respectively (Table I). However, for PC3 cells that stably express pMTdnJun, the IC50 value is markedly reduced (Fig. 3 A,open diamonds). Further, induction of maximum expression of dnJun by the addition of zinc acetate leads to greatly increased cytotoxicity with an IC50 of 16 μm (Fig. 3 B) or 7.24–9.8-fold more sensitive to cisplatin than control cells (TableI). The addition of zinc acetate alone has no effect on the viability of parental or empty vector control cells (Fig. 3 A,filled circles). Thus, the results observed following induction of expression of dnJun by a single clonal line confirm the results of Fig. 2 B that sensitization to cisplatin is dependent upon the expression of dnJun. As a further control, we examined PC3 prostate carcinoma cells modified to express a zinc-inducible c-Jun derivative, TAM-67, a well characterized transdominant negative inhibitor of AP-1 owing to a deletion of residues 2–122 (21Brown P.H. Chen T.K. Birrer M.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 791-799PubMed Google Scholar). As with dnJun, induction of TAM-67 in PC3 cells strongly enhances their sensitivity to cisplatin (Fig. 3 A). We have determined that these TAM-67 and dnJun are expressed in approximately equal amounts, suggesting that the comparable degree of sensitization for TAM-67 and dnJun (Fig.3 A) is accounted for by interference in the role of phosphorylation-related function of c-Jun. Similar results have been observed with an additional human glioblastoma line, U87, and an additional epithelial tumor line, MCF-7 (Table I). Clonal dnJun-expressing lines of these cells exhibit 2.6- and 3.8-fold decreased IC50 values, respectively (Table I). Thus, the sum of results indicate that the JNK/SAPK pathway may have a general role in mediating a functional response to DNA-cisplatin adduct formation. Inhibition of this response sensitizes cells to the cell-killing properties of cisplatin. We assessed the extent of genomic DNA damage and repair following cisplatin treatment using a modified PCR assay (25Jennerwein M.M. Eastman A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6209-6214Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For this assay, it has been shown that the degree of inhibition of PCR-catalyzed amplification of DNA purified from cisplatin-treated cells is a direct measure of the amount of DNA-cisplatin adduct formation as measured by atomic absorption (25Jennerwein M.M. Eastman A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6209-6214Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, this assay provides a direct assessment of the extent of cisplatin-induced DNA damage. DNA isolated from T98G cells immediately after treatment with 0, 100, or 200 μm cisplatin for 1 h exhibit increasing levels of DNA damage (Fig. 4 A,circles). However, if a 6-h “recovery” period is introduced prior to the DNA purification, damage is markedly and significantly (p = 0.003) reduced (Fig. 4 A,filled circles). As a positive control for the effects of inhibition of genomic DNA repair, an inhibitor of ADP-ribosylation, 2-aminobenzidine, was added at the time of treatment of the cells with cisplatin (Fig. 4 A, squares). Following the 6-h recovery period, DNA damage remained unrepaired, and total DNA damage was substantially increased. Next, we compared the level of DNA damage for T98G cells and dnJun-expressing cells following treatment with cisplatin (Fig. 4 B). For the dnJun-expressing T98G cells,6 h after cisplatin treatment DNA damage remains completely unrepaired for cells treated at either 100 or 200 μmcisplatin (p > 0.53). All the results summarized here (Fig. 4, A and B) are the averages of three independent assays, which confirms the reliability of this observation. The sum of results, therefore, strongly indicates that expression of dnJun by T98G cells largely abolishes DNA repair following exposure of the cells to cisplatin. These studies show that the JNK/SAPK pathway is activated by cisplatin-induced DNA damage and is required for DNA repair and viability following cisplatin treatment. T98G glioblastoma cells modified to express a nonphosphorylatable dominant negative inhibitor of c-Jun, dnJun, fail to repair cisplatin adducts and are sensitized to the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin under conditions that have little or no effect on parental and control lines. In contrast, cell lines modified to overexpress wild-type c-Jun are resistant to cisplatin, an observation that rules out that possibility that the sensitization effect of dnJun is mediated by one or more of the domains it shares with wild-type c-Jun. Moreover, sensitization to cisplatin by dnJun is exhibited by several cell lines of varying origins. Sensitization to cisplatin is also observed in PC-3 prostate carcinoma cells modified to express TAM-67, a known dominant negative inhibitor of AP-1 (21Brown P.H. Chen T.K. Birrer M.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 791-799PubMed Google Scholar). Because the degree of protein expression and sensitization is similar for TAM-67 and for dnJun, we conclude that most of the sensitization effects we observe are accounted for by inhibition of the phosphorylation-related functions of Jun. Two major types of DNA regulatory elements that respond to the phosphorylation state of c-Jun include classic AP-1 sites and ATF/CREB sites. Classic AP-1 sites consisting of a 7-base pair consensus motif, T(G/T)A(C/G)TCA, bind to AP-1 complexes consisting of heterodimers of members of the Fos and Jun families and to Jun-Jun homodimers (9Sluss H.

Indeed, because JNK phosphorylates ATF2 as well as c-Jun and promotes complex formation and binding to ATF/CREB sites, these sites are likely to be major targets of JNK-mediated regulation (9Sluss H.

Thus, the inhibition of induction of any or all of these activities could account for the inhibitory effects of dnJun on DNA repair and the resultant increase in cisplatin sensitivity. In view of the common regulatory mechanism involving ATF/CREB sites, a concerted induction of genes with a related function, DNA repair, is suggested. The sum of results indicate, therefore, that a potential physiological role for the strong activation of the JNK/SAPK pathway following DNA damage may be to mediate DNA repair by enhancing transaction of DNA repair enzymes.

https://openalex.org/W2109354493,"Abnormal regulation of ion channels by members of the ABC transport protein superfamily has been implicated in hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia and in excessive Na+absorption by airway epithelia in cystic fibrosis (CF). How ABC proteins regulate ion conductances is unknown, but must generally involve either the number or activity of specific ion channels. Here we report that the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which is defective in CF, reverses the regulation of the activity of single epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) by cAMP. ENaC expressed alone in fibroblasts responded to activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase with increased open probability (Po) and mean open time, whereas ENaC co-expressed with CFTR exhibited decreasedPo and mean open time under conditions optimal for PKA-mediated protein phosphorylation. Thus, CFTR regulates ENaC at the level of single channel gating, by switching the response of single channel Po to cAMP from an increase to a decrease.

ENaC-mediated Na+ absorption is increased 200–300% in airway epithelia and, abnormally, further stimulated by raising intracellular cAMP (3Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Knowles M.R. Cantley L. Gatzy J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 1245-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Because most CF mutations result in little if any functional CFTR in the apical cell membrane of affected epithelia (4Collins F.S. Science. 1992; 256: 774-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar), we inferred that normal CFTR must either down-regulate the number of active Na+ channels or decrease the activity of individual Na+ channels. In the present study we have studied the effects of cAMP-dependent protein-phosphorylating conditions on the single channel kinetics of ENaC expressed alone or together with CFTR in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESα-, β-, and γ-ENaC subunits were stably expressed in NIH 3T3 cell lines that had been previously transduced with a truncated (inactive) interleukin-2 receptor (ENaC alone cells) or with human CFTR (ENaC + CFTR cells) (5Stutts M.J. Canessa C.M. Olsen J.C. Hamrick M. Cohn J.A. Rossier B.C. Boucher R.C. Science. 1995; 269: 847-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). ENaC-mediated single channel currents were recorded from cell attached and excised membrane patches as described in the figure legends.RESULTSThe single channel conductance (4–5 picosiemens) of ENaC expressed in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, as well as cation selectivity (Li+ > Na+ > K+), amiloride inhibition (Ki ≈ 0.3 μm) and the slow gating pattern (MOT ≈ 1 s), are similar to what has been reported for the cloned channel expressed in oocytes (6Canessa C.M. Horisberger J. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 7Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C.

J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 25-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) or A6 cells (9Marunaka Y. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C1071-C1084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). These similar results in very different cells suggest that cell specific cytoskeletal or other elements are not critical determinants of the basic biophysical characteristics of ENaC. The basal conductance and amiloride sensitivity of ENaC were not affected by co-expression with CFTR (Fig.1).ENaC present in excised membrane patches exhibited a variable degree of rundown following excision. Rundown was partially reversed (Fig. 2 A, panel i) or prevented (Fig.2 A, panel ii) by exposure of the cytoplasmic surface to PKA catalytic subunit and 2 mm ATP (CS + ATP). Fig.2 A, panel iii, summarizes the results from both paradigms, revealing positive regulation of ENaC activity by PKA. One explanation for a range of basal activity, for rundown following excision, and for variable degree of activation by CS + ATP is that the resting phosphorylation state differs from patch to patch. Moreover, it seemed possible that water-soluble reagents, such as PKA catalytic subunit, might have poor access to hydrophobic compartments within the membrane patch. We tested these possibilities with a specific peptide inhibitor of PKA (mPKI) that had been modified by myristoylation to promote its association with biologic membranes (10Glass D.B. Cheng H.C. Mende-Mueller L. Reed J. Walsh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8802-8810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Walsh D.A. Glass D.B. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 304-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). mPKI was effective in (6/6) inside out membrane patches, reversing the effects of exogenous CS + ATP (Fig. 2 A) by inhibiting Po(Fig. 2 A, panel iii) and MOT (not shown) to levels lower than “basal.” This observation suggests that the level of basal phosphorylation in the system influences the gating of ENaC in the absence of external manipulation.Figure 2Effect of CFTR on regulation of ENaC by PKA in excised patches. A: panel i, current recorded from an inside out patch of ENaC only cell, starting just after excision. “c” indicates all channels closed. The probability of one channel being open decreased from 0.72 in the first 60 s following excision to 0.42 in the 60 s before addition of CS + ATP (rundown) and increased during exposure to CS + ATP to 0.65 in the last 60 s before addition of mPKI. mPKI completely inhibited ENaC.Panel i is representative of six experiments carried out with this paradigm). Panel ii, experiment illustrating the excision of an ENaC only cell attached patch directly into bath solution containing CS + ATP. Up to six ENaC remain active until exposed to mPKI by addition to the bath. Panel ii is representative of five patches excised into CS + ATP. Panel iii, summary of Po calculated from data recorded (minimum duration of 60 s) from inside out patches exposed to different bath solutions. Basal (n = 11) includes the six patches from panel i and five patches studied under basal conditions only; CS + ATP (n = 11) includes all patches from panels i and ii; and mPKI (n = 6) includes five patches from panel i and one patch from panel ii. *, different from basal by unpaired t test, p < 0.05). **, different from CS + ATP by unpaired t test,p < 0.01).

Basal refers to stationary channel activity following excision or just before exposure to CS and ATP. “CS + ATP” refers to the highest Po observed during a minimal interval of 60 s in the period 3–10 min following exposure to 100 units/ml CS (Promega) + 2 mm ATP to the bath. mPKI refers to the Po recorded in the period from 15 to 75 s following exposure to 1 μm mPKI (Biolmol) in the bath. Powas determined from amplitude histograms. For multichannel patches,nPo was calculated and Poderived assuming independent and equal gating of each channel and observation of maximal number of channels in the patch during recording.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The presence of CFTR caused a dramatic change in the regulation of ENaC in excised patches by CS + ATP. Whereas the gating and rundown of ENaC in patches excised from CFTR expressing cells were not obviously abnormal under nonstimulated conditions, exposure to CS + ATP routinely inhibited ENaC activity in two different paradigms (Fig.2 B). First, in 4/5 excised inside out patches, CS + ATP decreased Po (Fig. 2 B, panel i). Second, ENaC in 5/5 patches excised from CFTR expressing cells directly into CS + ATP demonstrated low Po (Fig.2 B, panel ii) and MOT (not shown). mPKI further decreasedPo of ENaC co-expressed with CFTR (Fig.2 B, panels i and iii). Fig. 2 B, panel iii, summarizes the very different pattern of regulation of ENaC by PKA in the presence of CFTR (compare with Fig. 2 A, panel iii).To study PKA and CFTR regulation of ENaC in the absence of excision-induced rundown, we exposed cells to permeant PKA activators (cpt-cAMP + forskolin (cpt-cAMP/FSK)) during cell-attached recording (Fig. 3). In ENaC-only cells cpt-cAMP + forskolin increased ENaC Po (Fig.3 A), whereas in ENaC + CFTR-expressing cells PKA activators routinely decreased Po (Fig. 3 B). This result, coupled with the effects of CS + ATP in excised patches, strongly indicates that the CFTR-mediated regulation of whole cell amiloride-sensitive Na+ current observed previously (5Stutts M.J. Canessa C.M. Olsen J.C. Hamrick M. Cohn J.A. Rossier B.C. Boucher R.C. Science. 1995; 269: 847-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar) reflects modulation by CFTR of ENaC single channel gating.Figure 3Effects of cAMP on open probability of ENaC studied on cell. A, cell-attached patch of ENaC only expressing cell. Pipette current was recorded at 30 mV (−Vpipette). Cell-permeant cAMP (cpt-cAMP) (500 μm) and forskolin (FSK, 10 μm) were added (as indicated by thearrow). The second and third traces were recorded 90 and 180 s later, respectively. For analysis, thePo during basal conditions (Basal, n = 8) and after stimulation (Stim, n = 8) were compared. (Histogram; p < 0.05, n= 8). B, effect of cpt-cAMP and forskolin (FSK) on ENaC activity in a cell attached patch from an ENaC plus CFTR expressing cell. Analyzed as in A. (Histogram;n = 8 in each condition). Methods: cell attached recordings were carried out under basal (Basal, prior to additions) and stimulated conditions (Stim, 3–8 min following 500 μm cpt-cAMP and 10 μmforskolin), at −Vpipette of −20 to −40 mV. A minimum of 60 s of data was analyzed from each experiment.Po was determined as above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The results in Figs. 2 and 3 suggest that negative regulation of ENaC by CFTR reflects an effect on ENaC activity rather than ENaC number. Additional analyses of our data support this conclusion. First, co-expression of CFTR with ENaC did not affect the number of ENaC channels observed per patch (2.17 ± 0.29 (n = 28) without CFTR and 2.29 ± 0.29 (n = 26) with CFTR). Second, the MOT of unambiguous single channel openings in excised, and cell-attached patches under optimal conditions of PKA activation were markedly decreased by the presence of CFTR (Fig. 4). Thus, CFTR negative regulation of ENAC can be explained by decreased activity of individual ENaC channels.Figure 4CFTR alters cAMP regulation of ENaC kinetics (Po and MOT). Excised inside out patches or cell-attached patches that demonstrated only single ENaC during the entire experiment or patches with two channels that exhibited infrequent coincident openings were selected from the experiments presented in Figs. 2 and 3 to determine the effect of CFTR on ENaC gating in the presence of maximal PKA activity. Methods:Po was calculated as above, and lists of the durations of unambiguous openings were compiled from each experiment, with the events list feature of PClamp 6 (Axon Instruments). Very long openings precluded sufficient observations for conventional analysis of the distribution of open time durations. Accordingly, the arithmetic average of all openings greater than 40 milliseconds was calculated as an estimate of mean open time (MOT), for each experiment (minimum 60 s or 40 openings analyzed). *, ENaC + CFTR (n = 7) different from ENaC (n = 9) by unpaired t analysis (p < 0.02).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONOur data reveal a surprisingly strong positive regulation of ENaC alone by PKA. The low Po recorded in the presence of mPKI (Fig. 3) and the high Po and long MOT measured during PKA activation (Fig. 4) indicate that increasing protein phosphorylation increased the time ENaC occupied a stable open conformation. This result differs from the cAMP-dependent increase of the number of endogenous amiloride sensitive Na+ channels seen in A6 epithelial cells (9Marunaka Y. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C1071-C1084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which are reported to regulate surface expression of transport elements by membrane insertion and retrieval (12Schafer J.A. Hawk C.T. Kidney Int. 1992; 41: 255-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), but is similar to cAMP-dependent regulation ofPo of partially purified renal (13Ismailov I.I. McDuffie J.H. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10235-10241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and lung alveolar type II cell Na+ channels (14Senyk O. Ismailov I. Bradford A.L. Baker R.R. Matalon S. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1148-C1156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of heterologously expressed ENaC in oocytes (15Mall M. Hipper A. Greger R. Kunzelmann K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and of reconstituted ENaC in lipid bilayers (16Ismailov I.I. Awayda M.S. Jovov B. Berdiev B.K. Fuller C.M. Dedman J.R. Kaetzel M.A. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4725-4732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) detected no effect of PKA activation on single channel gating. γ-rENaC used in our study contains two consensus PKA phosphorylation sites, but these are not highly conserved across species (6Canessa C.M. Horisberger J. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 7Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). Thus, PKA regulation of ENaC gating may well involve the phosphorylation and function of an additional protein or proteins, including cytoskeletal components such as actin (17Berdiev B.K. Prat A.G. Cantiello H.F. Ausiello D.A. Fuller C.M. Jovov B. Benos D.J. Ismailov I.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17704-17710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Cell-specific expression of these proteins could explain why fibroblasts reproduce the defect in CF airways better than oocytes (15Mall M. Hipper A. Greger R. Kunzelmann K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).In intact oocytes (15Mall M. Hipper A. Greger R. Kunzelmann K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), or in ENaC reconstituted in lipid bilayers after expression in oocytes (16Ismailov I.I. Awayda M.S. Jovov B. Berdiev B.K. Fuller C.M. Dedman J.R. Kaetzel M.A. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4725-4732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), the presence of CFTR decreased whole cell currents or single channel open probability. Thus, CFTR appears to exert a negative modulatory regulation of ENaC in several distinct cell types, including human airway epithelia, mouse fibroblasts, and amphibian oocytes.The present findings help explain the long standing observation that Na+ absorption across CF airway epithelia is increased and inappropriately further stimulated by cAMP (3Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Knowles M.R. Cantley L. Gatzy J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 1245-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). In CF airways, the abnormally high rate of basal Na+ absorption reflects the absence of negative regulation of ENaC by CFTR under basal phosphorylating conditions, and increased PKA activity leads only to further absorption. In contrast, CFTR function in normal airways converts the activation of PKA into a stimulus for both inhibition of ENaC-mediated Na+ absorption and stimulation of CFTR-mediated Cl− secretion. Despite previous reports of abnormal regulation of Na+ channel activity in CF (18Chinet T.C. Fullton J.M. Yankaskas J.R. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1050-C1060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Chinet T.C. Fullton J.M. Yankaskas J.R. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Am. J.

Res. 1991; 12: 17-23Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar), this conclusion was in doubt until now, because PKA has been reported to regulate only the number of active amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels in A6 cells (9Marunaka Y. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C1071-C1084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and because another genetic disease associated with excessive Na+ reabsorption (Liddle's syndrome) has been attributed solely to increased ENaC number (21Snyder P.M. Price M.P. McDonald F.J. Adams C.M. Volk K.A. Zeiher B.G. Stokes J.B. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 969-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). More recently, the mutations associated with Liddle's syndrome have been shown to act predominantly by increased ENaCPo and MOT (22Hansson J.H. Schild L. Lu Y. Wilson T.A. Gautschi I. Shimkets R. Nelson-Williams C. Rossier B.C. Lifton R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11495-11499Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). This observation, coupled with the present results, make it clear that regulation of ENaC single channel kinetics is broadly implicated in the control of epithelial sodium absorption.A general mechanism of regulation of ion channels by ABC proteins is yet to be identified (23Higgins C.F. Cell. 1995; 82: 693-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), but it is clear that CFTR regulates ENaC at the level of single channel gating. This observation is an important consideration for understanding the mechanism by which ABC proteins, including not only CFTR but also SUR and MDR (23Higgins C.F. Cell. 1995; 82: 693-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), can influence other ion channels. Potentially, ABC proteins regulate the activity of other ion channels through transported substrates, as proposed for CFTR-mediated ATP release (24Cantiello H.F. Prat A.G. Reisin I.L. Ercole L.B.

Alternatively, ABC proteins may regulate the activity of other ion channels by direct or indirect protein-protein interactions. Recent studies (1Burch L. Talbot C. Knowles M.R. Canessa C. Rossier B.

These similar results in very different cells suggest that cell specific cytoskeletal or other elements are not critical determinants of the basic biophysical characteristics of ENaC. The basal conductance and amiloride sensitivity of ENaC were not affected by co-expression with CFTR (Fig.1).ENaC present in excised membrane patches exhibited a variable degree of rundown following excision.

Fig.2 A, panel iii, summarizes the results from both paradigms, revealing positive regulation of ENaC activity by PKA. One explanation for a range of basal activity, for rundown following excision, and for variable degree of activation by CS + ATP is that the resting phosphorylation state differs from patch to patch. Moreover, it seemed possible that water-soluble reagents, such as PKA catalytic subunit, might have poor access to hydrophobic compartments within the membrane patch.

Whereas the gating and rundown of ENaC in patches excised from CFTR expressing cells were not obviously abnormal under nonstimulated conditions, exposure to CS + ATP routinely inhibited ENaC activity in two different paradigms (Fig.2 B). First, in 4/5 excised inside out patches, CS + ATP decreased Po (Fig. 2 B, panel i). Second, ENaC in 5/5 patches excised from CFTR expressing cells directly into CS + ATP demonstrated low Po (Fig.2 B, panel ii) and MOT (not shown). mPKI further decreasedPo of ENaC co-expressed with CFTR (Fig.2 B, panels i and iii). Fig. 2 B, panel iii, summarizes the very different pattern of regulation of ENaC by PKA in the presence of CFTR (compare with Fig. 2 A, panel iii).To study PKA and CFTR regulation of ENaC in the absence of excision-induced rundown, we exposed cells to permeant PKA activators (cpt-cAMP + forskolin (cpt-cAMP/FSK)) during cell-attached recording (Fig. 3). In ENaC-only cells cpt-cAMP + forskolin increased ENaC Po (Fig.3 A), whereas in ENaC + CFTR-expressing cells PKA activators routinely decreased Po (Fig. 3 B). This result, coupled with the effects of CS + ATP in excised patches, strongly indicates that the CFTR-mediated regulation of whole cell amiloride-sensitive Na+ current observed previously (5Stutts M.J.

A, cell-attached patch of ENaC only expressing cell. Pipette current was recorded at 30 mV (−Vpipette). Cell-permeant cAMP (cpt-cAMP) (500 μm) and forskolin (FSK, 10 μm) were added (as indicated by thearrow). The second and third traces were recorded 90 and 180 s later, respectively. For analysis, thePo during basal conditions (Basal, n = 8) and after stimulation (Stim, n = 8) were compared. (Histogram; p < 0.05, n= 8). B, effect of cpt-cAMP and forskolin (FSK) on ENaC activity in a cell attached patch from an ENaC plus CFTR expressing cell. Analyzed as in A. (Histogram;n = 8 in each condition). Methods: cell attached recordings were carried out under basal (Basal, prior to additions) and stimulated conditions (Stim, 3–8 min following 500 μm cpt-cAMP and 10 μmforskolin), at −Vpipette of −20 to −40 mV. A minimum of 60 s of data was analyzed from each experiment.Po was determined as above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The results in Figs. 2 and 3 suggest that negative regulation of ENaC by CFTR reflects an effect on ENaC activity rather than ENaC number. Additional analyses of our data support this conclusion. First, co-expression of CFTR with ENaC did not affect the number of ENaC channels observed per patch (2.17 ± 0.29 (n = 28) without CFTR and 2.29 ± 0.29 (n = 26) with CFTR). Second, the MOT of unambiguous single channel openings in excised, and cell-attached patches under optimal conditions of PKA activation were markedly decreased by the presence of CFTR (Fig. 4). Thus, CFTR negative regulation of ENAC can be explained by decreased activity of individual ENaC channels.Figure 4CFTR alters cAMP regulation of ENaC kinetics (Po and MOT). Excised inside out patches or cell-attached patches that demonstrated only single ENaC during the entire experiment or patches with two channels that exhibited infrequent coincident openings were selected from the experiments presented in Figs. 2 and 3 to determine the effect of CFTR on ENaC gating in the presence of maximal PKA activity. Methods:Po was calculated as above, and lists of the durations of unambiguous openings were compiled from each experiment, with the events list feature of PClamp 6 (Axon Instruments). Very long openings precluded sufficient observations for conventional analysis of the distribution of open time durations. Accordingly, the arithmetic average of all openings greater than 40 milliseconds was calculated as an estimate of mean open time (MOT), for each experiment (minimum 60 s or 40 openings analyzed). *, ENaC + CFTR (n = 7) different from ENaC (n = 9) by unpaired t analysis (p < 0.02).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The single channel conductance (4–5 picosiemens) of ENaC expressed in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, as well as cation selectivity (Li+ > Na+ > K+), amiloride inhibition (Ki ≈ 0.3 μm) and the slow gating pattern (MOT ≈ 1 s), are similar to what has been reported for the cloned channel expressed in oocytes (6Canessa C.M. Horisberger J. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 7Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C.

J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 25-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) or A6 cells (9Marunaka Y. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C1071-C1084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). These similar results in very different cells suggest that cell specific cytoskeletal or other elements are not critical determinants of the basic biophysical characteristics of ENaC. The basal conductance and amiloride sensitivity of ENaC were not affected by co-expression with CFTR (Fig.1). ENaC present in excised membrane patches exhibited a variable degree of rundown following excision. Rundown was partially reversed (Fig. 2 A, panel i) or prevented (Fig.2 A, panel ii) by exposure of the cytoplasmic surface to PKA catalytic subunit and 2 mm ATP (CS + ATP). Fig.2 A, panel iii, summarizes the results from both paradigms, revealing positive regulation of ENaC activity by PKA. One explanation for a range of basal activity, for rundown following excision, and for variable degree of activation by CS + ATP is that the resting phosphorylation state differs from patch to patch. Moreover, it seemed possible that water-soluble reagents, such as PKA catalytic subunit, might have poor access to hydrophobic compartments within the membrane patch. We tested these possibilities with a specific peptide inhibitor of PKA (mPKI) that had been modified by myristoylation to promote its association with biologic membranes (10Glass D.B. Cheng H.C.

Thus, CFTR negative regulation of ENAC can be explained by decreased activity of individual ENaC channels. DISCUSSIONOur data reveal a surprisingly strong positive regulation of ENaC alone by PKA. The low Po recorded in the presence of mPKI (Fig. 3) and the high Po and long MOT measured during PKA activation (Fig. 4) indicate that increasing protein phosphorylation increased the time ENaC occupied a stable open conformation. This result differs from the cAMP-dependent increase of the number of endogenous amiloride sensitive Na+ channels seen in A6 epithelial cells (9Marunaka Y. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C1071-C1084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which are reported to regulate surface expression of transport elements by membrane insertion and retrieval (12Schafer J.A. Hawk C.T.

Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). Thus, PKA regulation of ENaC gating may well involve the phosphorylation and function of an additional protein or proteins, including cytoskeletal components such as actin (17Berdiev B.K. Prat A.G.

Thus, CFTR appears to exert a negative modulatory regulation of ENaC in several distinct cell types, including human airway epithelia, mouse fibroblasts, and amphibian oocytes.The present findings help explain the long standing observation that Na+ absorption across CF airway epithelia is increased and inappropriately further stimulated by cAMP (3Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Knowles M.R. Cantley L. Gatzy J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 1245-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). In CF airways, the abnormally high rate of basal Na+ absorption reflects the absence of negative regulation of ENaC by CFTR under basal phosphorylating conditions, and increased PKA activity leads only to further absorption. In contrast, CFTR function in normal airways converts the activation of PKA into a stimulus for both inhibition of ENaC-mediated Na+ absorption and stimulation of CFTR-mediated Cl− secretion. Despite previous reports of abnormal regulation of Na+ channel activity in CF (18Chinet T.C. Fullton J.M. Yankaskas J.R. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Am. J.

For example, the androgens act through the androgen receptor (AR) 1The abbreviations used are:ARandrogen receptorGRglucocorticoid receptorDBDDNA-binding domainHREhormone response elementMRmineralocorticoid receptorCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseHAhemagglutininPCRpolymerase chain reaction to stimulate protein synthesis in skeletal muscle and to increase smooth muscle and prostate proliferation. Additionally, androgen receptors may be involved directly or indirectly in triggering aggressive dominant male behavior (2Monder C. Sakai R.R. Miroff Y. Blanchard D.C. Blanchard R.J.

In contrast, glucocorticoids act through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) to cause skeletal muscle protein degradation and to inhibit smooth muscle and prostate proliferation and are correlated with submissive behavior in male rats (2Monder C.

These opposing effects of androgens and glucocorticoids appear to reflect interaction at some level in their signaling pathways since glucocorticoids inhibit both the proliferative and anabolic effects of androgens (7Syms A.J.

Schlondorff D. Bonventre J. Molecular Nephrology: Kidney Function in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 525-533Google Scholar). Receptor specificity does not appear to be determined primarily by protein-DNA interaction, since their transcriptional activities differ markedly in some contexts (Fig.1 and Refs. 11Rundlett S.E. Miesfeld R.L. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 109: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 12Adler A.J. Scheller A. Robins D.M. Mol. Cell.

It appears that factors other than DNA affinity control GR and AR activity at different types of HREs, as has been described previously for GR and its close relative, the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) (14Pearce D. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1993; 259: 1161-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 15Rupprecht R. Arriza J.L. Spengler D. Reul J.M. Evans R.M. Holsboer F. Damm K. Mol.

HREs contain imperfect palindromes composed of two half-sites that AR, GR, and MR bind as head-to-head homodimers, and recent evidence has suggested that, in addition to homodimer formation, MR and GR heterodimerize (16Liu W.-H. Wang J. Sauter N.K. Pearce D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12480-12484Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 18Trapp T. Rupprecht R. Castren M. Reul J.M. Holsboer F. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1457-1462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In view of these observations, it seemed plausible that AR and GR might also interact directly through heterodimer formation to inhibit each other's transcriptional activities, thus providing a molecular basis for the observation of an inhibitory interaction at the cell and tissue level. To examine this possibility, we performed co-transfection experiments with various AR-specific and GR-specific HREs in cultured cells and tested for direct physical interactions in gel shift assays. We also used a genetic approach to demonstrate that heterodimer formation was essential for their inhibitory effects at the transcriptional level. 60–80% confluent monolayers of monkey CV-1b cells (Cell Culture Facility, University of California, San Francisco) were grown in 5% CO2, 95% air (relative humidity, 90%) at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium H-16 (Mediatech) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were transfected by the LipofectAMINE method as described (Life Technologies, Inc.), with 100 ng of GR expression plasmid (6RGR), 100 ng of AR expression plasmid (6RAR), or 100 ng of each expression plasmid together, along with 50 ng of reporter plasmid TAT1-TATA and 100 ng of reporter plasmid C′Δ9 (a kind gift of Diane M. Robins, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). 20 ng of RSV-β-gal plasmid was included as an internal standard, and the BlueScript KS− vector plasmid was used as carrier to bring the total amount of DNA to 1 μg. The reporter TAT1-TATA contains one HRE with sequence TGTACAGGATGTTCT fused to the Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase minimal promoter (−33/+4) driving luciferase expression. The reporter C′Δ9 contains Slp enhancer sequences upstream of a thymidine kinase chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene (13Adler A.J. Danielsen M. Robins D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11660-11663Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The effect of cotransfection of GR and AR on multimerized HREs was also determined by using 50 ng of reporter plasmid TAT3-TATA, which contains a trimerized HRE fused to the same Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase minimal promoter driving luciferase expression. Fresh medium containing 5% stripped serum (charcoal treated to remove endogenous steroids) and penicillin G at 100 units/ml and streptomycin sulfate at 100 μg/ml was added 18 h before transfection. Lipid-DNA complexes were prepared according to the manufacturer's manual. Cells were incubated in the medium containing DNA-lipid complexes for 5 h, after which an equal volume of medium with twice the serum was added and cells were incubated for 16 h. Cells were then washed two times in 37 °C phosphate-buffered saline, and refed with fresh medium. Corticosterone (100 nm) and dihydrotestosterone (100 nm) were added to one of two identical transfections; 24 h later, cells were harvested and extracts were prepared as described previously (14Pearce D. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1993; 259: 1161-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The extracts were assayed for luciferase and CAT activity. Both luciferase and CAT values were normalized to protein content and to β-galactosidase activity (expression driven by the Rous sarcoma virus promoter) without any significant difference. For in vitro measurements, receptor DBDs lacking the ligand-binding domains and N termini were expressed in bacteria. Sequences encoding the rat AR DBD were cloned into the plasmid pET-14b (Novagen) and expressed inEscherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS as a recombinant protein with the sequence AR residues 535–623 (89 residues, 11.0 kDa). An influenza hemagglutinin (HA)/epitope-tagged version of this recombinant protein was also obtained by introducing a three HA-epitope sequence fragment in front of the DBD region. Purification was as described (19Freedman L.P. Luisi B.F. Korszun Z.R. Basavappa R. Sigler P.B. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1988; 334: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), except that the AR was precipitated by addition of 45% ammonium sulfate and then redissolved with and dialyzed in HEGDZ50 (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μmZnSO4, 50 mm NaCl). Rat GR recombinant protein T7X556 (179 residues; 19.0 kDa) was expressed and purified as described (16Liu W.-H. Wang J. Sauter N.K. Pearce D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12480-12484Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The TAT0.5 (containing a single HRE half-site) and TAT1.0 (containing one full HRE site) probes were excised from the plasmids possessing the HRE sequences: TAT0.5 (TATCACGGATGTTCT) and TAT1.0 (TGTACAGGATGTTCT) (the half- and full sites are underlined). The DNA fragments were gel-purified and ethanol-precipitated. Probe was 32P-end-labeled by filling in with Klenow (Boehringer Mannheim). Binding was quantified by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. GR or AR DNA-binding domains were mixed with the 32P-labeled HRE in reaction buffer (50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 200 ng of poly(dI-dC), 100 ng of bovine serum albumin) in a total volume of 20 μl. Either the anti-HA (influenza hemagglutinin) monoclonal antibody or an anti-GR monoclonal antibody, BuGR (20Eisen L.P. Reichman M.E. Thompson E.B. Gametchu B. Harrison R.W. Eisen H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11805-11810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), directed against amino acids 407–420, was included in the reaction mixtures where indicated. After incubation for 15 min at room temperature, reaction mixtures were applied to a 8.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (37.5:1, acrylamide/bisacrylamide; National Diagnostics) buffered with 0.5 × TBE (44.5 mm Tris·HCl, 44.5 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8), and resolved by electrophoresis (250 V) at room temperature, followed by autoradiography. The mammalian expression vector 6RAR was made by inserting a 2.8-kilobase pairXba I-Xba I rat AR fragment from the vector pCMV5 (a generous gift of Diane M. Robins) into the vector 6R. The AR point mutation (Arg-581 → Asp) was introduced into the plasmid 6RAR using PCR to generate AR/R581D mutant as described previously. The N-terminal deletion derivatives of AR wild type (ARΔN) and AR/R581D mutant (ARΔN/R581D) were obtained by the following steps. First, the DBD region was obtained by PCR with the introduction of a Bgl II site in front of the DBD region; the resulting PCR fragments were then religated with 6RAR or 6RAR/R581D plasmid fragments, which had been deleted of the entire N-terminal and DBD regions. GR point mutants and GR N-terminal deletion mutants have been described previously (16Liu W.-H. Wang J. Sauter N.K. Pearce D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12480-12484Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Thein vivo interaction of AR and GR was determined by cotransfection with AR and GR complementary mutants. Cells were transfected with full-length receptor expression plasmids following the procedures described above. For the N-terminal deletion receptors, cells were transfected as described above except with 20 ng of GR expression plasmid, 20 ng of AR expression plasmid, or 10 ng of each expression plasmid together, along with 50 ng of reporter plasmid TAT3-TATA. Corticosterone (100 nm) and dihydrotestosterone (1000 nm) were used. Luciferase values were also normalized to both protein content and to β-galactosidase activity without any significant difference. We were initially interested in asking if AR and GR could influence each other's transcriptional activities at HREs to which they are both able to bind. We began by transfecting CV-1b cells with the androgen-specific HRE C′Δ9 (driving CAT expression) and the GR-responsive HRE TAT1-TATA (driving luciferase expression) with AR and GR either alone or the two receptors together. CV-1b cells lack endogenous GR (14Pearce D. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1993; 259: 1161-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) and AR (13Adler A.J. Danielsen M. Robins D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11660-11663Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) activity and therefore provide a null background for expression of transfected wild type or mutant receptors. As shown in Fig. 1A, C′Δ9 reporter activity was strongly induced by AR, but responded only marginally to GR in transfected CV-1b cells, consistent with the prior observations of Adler et al. (13Adler A.J. Danielsen M. Robins D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11660-11663Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In contrast, AR had marginal activity on TAT1-TATA while GR induced a robust transcriptional response (Fig.1B). When the receptors were coexpressed, GR inhibited AR-induced activity at C′Δ9 while AR inhibited GR at TAT1-TATA. In a series of titration experiments, we found that inhibition occurred at all levels of transfected receptors, suggesting that it was not due to squelching or occlusion (13Adler A.J. Danielsen M. Robins D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11660-11663Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and was consistent with the formation of an inhibitory heterodimer. AR also inhibited GR transcriptional activity at TAT3-TATA, a reporter that contains three HREs driving a minimal promoter. As shown in Fig. 1C, AR and GR activities were not as disparate on TAT3 as on TAT1 and C′Δ9, although, like TAT1, GR had considerably more activity than AR. Again, AR inhibited GR activity, albeit more modestly than at TAT1 (Fig. 1C,AR + GR). Thus, AR and GR activities differ markedly at a variety of HREs, and they demonstrate mutual inhibition at all of these sites. We next sought to determine whether the receptors physically interact in vivo under the same conditions where they had demonstrated mutual inhibition. We used an approach developed to demonstrate heterodimer formation between MR and GR in vivo through introduction of complementary salt bridge mutations (16Liu W.-H. Wang J. Sauter N.K. Pearce D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12480-12484Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 17Liu W.-H. Wang J. Yu G.-Q. Pearce D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1399-1406PubMed Google Scholar). AR, GR, and MR (as well as progesterone receptor) share a high degree of sequence homology in their DBD regions (21Luisi B.F. Xu W.X. Otwinowski Z. Freedman L.P. Yamamoto K.R. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1991; 352: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar, 22Dahlman-Wright K. Wright A. Gustafsson J.-A. Carlstedt-Duke J. J. Biol.

Science. 1990; 249: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Within the DBD, a conserved Arg-Asn-Asp motif was shown by x-ray crystallographic analysis of GR to participate in homodimer formation by forming a reciprocal pair of salt bridges (21Luisi B.F. Xu W.X. Otwinowski Z. Freedman L.P. Yamamoto K.R. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1991; 352: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar, 22Dahlman-Wright K. Wright A. Gustafsson J.-A. Carlstedt-Duke J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3107-3112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that this same salt-bridge pair is a point of direct physical contact between MR and GR (16Liu W.-H. Wang J. Sauter N.K. Pearce D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12480-12484Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Thus, it seemed likely that these same residues would mediate AR-GR interaction in vivo as well. Initially we used N-terminal deletion derivatives of AR and GR for introduction of point mutations (as shown in Fig. 2) to avoid the confounding effects of the dimer mutations on full-length receptor activity (see Ref. 16Liu W.-H. Wang J. Sauter N.K. Pearce D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12480-12484Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar and below). Previous evidence demonstrated that salt bridge mutations decrease the transcriptional activity of GRΔN on either a TAT1- or TAT3-containing reporter gene (16Liu W.-H. Wang J. Sauter N.K. Pearce D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12480-12484Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 17Liu W.-H. Wang J. Yu G.-Q. Pearce D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1399-1406PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, as shown in Fig. 3, both GRΔN/R479D and GRΔN/D481R had much lower activity than wild type GRΔN when cotransfected with TAT3-TATA. Similarly, the homologous Arg-Asp mutant of ARΔN, ARΔN/R581D, had lower activity than ARΔN as well (Fig.3). If AR and GR heterodimerized using the same salt bridge, then coexpression of complementary mutants should be able to reestablish the ionic interaction and restore heterodimer formation, and consequently, wild type transcriptional activity. Coexpression of noncomplementary mutants, on the other hand, would not reestablish the ionic interaction and little or no transcriptional activity should result. In keeping with this prediction, cotransfection of the complementary mutants, ARΔN/R581D and GRΔN/D481R, fully restored transcriptional activity to that obtained by wild type receptors (Fig. 3, compare ARΔN + GRΔN with ARΔN/R581D + GRΔN/D481R) while coexpression of non-complememtary mutants did not (Fig. 3,ARΔN/R581D + GRΔN/R479D). These data strongly support the idea that ARΔN and GRΔN heterodimerize at TAT3-TATA in vivo and this interaction is mediated via the DBD region.Figure 3Genetic evidence for AR and GR interactionin vivo. Complementary and non-complementary salt bridge mutants of AR and GR N-terminal deletion derivatives were coexpressed in CV-1b cells. TAT3-TATA was cotransfected with wild type receptors or salt bridge mutants as shown. 100 nmcorticosterone and 1000 nm dihydrotestosterone were added for 24 h. Luciferase values were normalized with β-galactosidase activities and represent the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To look directly at heterodimer formation, we performed gel shift assays usingE. coli-expressed proteins encompassing the receptor DBDs. AR and GR truncated proteins of differing size (AR, 11 kDa; GR, 19 kDa) containing their DBDs were expressed in E. coli and were partially purified (see “Experimental Procedures”). To unequivocally identify the positions of monomer and dimer bands for each receptor, their HRE binding activities were initially analyzed with oligonucleotides containing either a half HRE site or a whole HRE site (two half-sites separated by three nucleotides). As shown in Fig.4A, AR DBD protein was highly active in binding to the HRE-containing oligonucleotides and the relative mobility of bands using single half-site versus full HRE demonstrated the gel locations of monomer and homodimer (comparelanes 3 and 4). Specificity of binding was demonstrated by competition using cold specific and nonspecific oligonucleotides (data not shown). GR demonstrated a similar result; its monomer and homodimer bands are shown in lanes 5 and6. To look for heterodimer formation, various amounts of AR and GR were mixed with the single full-site HRE probe, keeping the total amount of protein constant, as shown in Fig. 4B, lanes 2–12. A band of intermediate size appears in reaction mixtures containing both receptors, strongly supporting heterodimer formation. Furthermore, in experiments in which a highly specific monoclonal anti-GR antibody (BuGR, see “Experimental Procedures”) was included, the upper GR homodimer band, the intermediate AR-GR heterodimer band and the GR monomer band were complete supershifted (Fig. 4C, lanes 5–7). Although the AR homodimer and AR monomer bands were not supershifted by BuGR in the absence of GR, their intensity was reduced in the presence of GR (Fig.4C, compare lanes 5 and 6). This might be due to stabilization by BuGR of the AR-GR heterodimer consequently favoring heterodimer formation and thus depleting AR homodimer and monomer bands, as has been described for other DNA-binding proteins. Similar supershift results were obtained with an HA/epitope-tagged derivative of AR DBD that both the AR homodimer and AR-GR heterodimer could be supershifted by the anti-HA antibody (data not shown). Thus, from these results, we conclude that AR and GR heterodimerize directly via DBD regions in vitro. We last tested heterodimer formation of full-length receptors. Recently, the role of the DBD dimer interface in steroid receptor function has come into question. Liu et al. demonstrated that disruption of the DBD dimer interface in the context of full-length MR or GR markedly increased receptor activity on multimerized HREs (17Liu W.-H. Wang J. Yu G.-Q. Pearce D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1399-1406PubMed Google Scholar) in striking contrast with its effect on receptor N-terminal deletion derivatives (Ref. 16Liu W.-H. Wang J. Sauter N.K. Pearce D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12480-12484Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar and Fig. 3). Restoration of the contacts through coexpression of complementary mutants decreased activity to near wild type levels. These observations suggested the surprising conclusion that the DBD dimer interface restrains receptor activity by interfering with its capacity for transcriptional synergy. To examine if this same principle “constrained self-synergy” applied to AR, the Arg-581 → Asp mutation was introduced into full-length AR and the synergistic activity of the mutant receptor (AR/R581D) was examined. As shown in Fig. 5, the activity of AR/R581D was 4-fold greater than that of wild type AR at TAT3-TATA. The activity of GR was also potentiated by the salt bridge mutations as shown previously. In a parallel set of experiments, AR/R581D activity on TAT1-TATA was found to be lower than wild type (data not shown). Thus, AR self-synergy, like that of GR and MR, is increased by disruption of the DBD dimer interfaces, further supporting the idea that the dimer interface is inhibitory. Coexpression of complementary salt-bridge mutants returned the elevated transcriptional activity back to the wild type level, while coexpression of noncomplementary mutants did not. It is notable that the transcriptional activity elicited by AR/R581D + GR/D481R was lower than that of wild type GR alone consistent with an inhibitory effect transmitted through the DBD dimer interface. These results strengthen our hypothesis that AR and GR mutual inhibition proceeds through heterodimerization and further support the idea that the role of the DBD dimer interface in this receptor subfamily is to limit transcriptional self-synergy, not to stabilize receptor occupancy at the HRE, i.e. this protein-protein contact appears to transmit inhibitory information from one subunit to the other in the context of a heterodimer. It is interesting to note that a mutation within the DBD dimer interface of AR has been implicated in the human disease, Reifenstein's syndrome (24Kaspar F. Klocker H. Denninger A. Cato A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7850-7858Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In transfection experiments, Kasparet al. found that the mutant AR was surprisingly unaffected by the mutation at paired HREs while its activity was decreased at a simple HRE. We also find that the effect of the dimer mutations on receptor activity is context-dependent; receptor activity is increased at multiple simple HREs (Fig. 5 and Ref. 17Liu W.-H. Wang J. Yu G.-Q. Pearce D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1399-1406PubMed Google Scholar), decreased at a single HRE (17Liu W.-H. Wang J. Yu G.-Q. Pearce D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1399-1406PubMed Google Scholar), and unaffected at a complex HRE with interspersed receptor binding sites and sites for non-receptor factors. For example, we tested the activity of wild type and mutant GR and AR to repress AP-1 activity at a composite GRE containing reporter, the plfG (25Diamond M.I. Miner J.N. Yoshinaga S.K. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1990; 249: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). In cotransfection experiments into F9 cells, while the receptors showed qualitatively the same results on TAT3-TATA as in CV-1b cells, we found that activation by AP-1 was repressed by both AR (26Bubulya A. Wise S.C. Shen X.Q. Burmeister L.A. Shemshedini L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24583-24589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 27Kallio P.J. Poukka H. Moilanen A. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1017-1028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and GR (14Pearce D. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1993; 259: 1161-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) in a ligand-dependent manner as reported previously (data not shown). Interestingly, we also found that both AR and GR salt-bridge mutants could repress the AP-1 activation of transcription at a level similar to wild type. Furthermore, in cotransfection experiments with complementary mutants (AR/R581D + GR/D481R) or non-complementary mutants (AR/R581D + GR/R479D), we found that repression was comparable to wild type, suggesting that the two receptors do not heterodimerize. These results support the hypothesis that GR and AR act as monomers when repressing AP-1 activation as suggested previously (28Heck S. Kullmann M. Gast A. Ponta H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Cato A.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4087-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). A variety of studies in whole animals, isolated tissues, and cultured cells suggest that AR and GR not only mediate opposite effects on cellular metabolism and proliferation but that their signaling pathways are mutually inhibitory (2Monder C.

We have demonstrated that AR and GR inhibit each other's transcriptional activities in cultured cells, that they heterodimerize in cells and in vitro, and that re-establishing heterodimer formation by coexpression of complementary salt-bridge mutants restores AR inhibition of GR at TAT3-TATA. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that heterodimer formation underlies their inhibitory interaction at the transcriptional level. We propose that the opposing effects of androgens and glucocorticoids are due, at least in part, to mutual inhibition of AR and GR through heterodimer formation. This might have important implications for balancing the anabolic, pro-aggressive actions of the androgens on the one hand with the catabolic homeostatic actions of the glucocorticoids on the other. For example, as glucocorticoid levels rise to predominate over testosterone in a stressed animal, heterodimer formation will ensure that the energy-consuming anabolic effects mediated by AR homodimers are curtailed at the same time that GR homodimers begin to activate transcription of genes involved in catabolism. In a similar fashion, the behavioral effects of androgens (those mediated by AR rather than estrogen receptor) also might be blocked by GR-AR heterodimers resulting in dramatic changes in behavior. When AR activity predominates (high androgen/glucocorticoid rates), a reciprocal effect might be observed. It is important to note that these inhibitory interactions at a subset of HREs do not rule out the possibility that at other HREs AR and GR do not interact, have similar effects, or perhaps even synergize. Indeed, AR and GR both repress AP-1 activity at either a composite GRE (25Diamond M.I. Miner J.N. Yoshinaga S.K. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1990; 249: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar,29Mordacq J.C. Linzer D.I. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) 2S.

Cell. 1990; 62: 1189-1204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). Moreover, repression does not require an intact DBD dimer interface (27Kallio P.J. Poukka H. Moilanen A. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1017-1028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and AR and GR do not influence each other's activities.2 Heterodimer formation is widely recognized as a key component of transcriptional regulation by the nuclear receptors. Retinoid X receptor, the ubiquitously expressed receptor for 9-cis-retinoic acid, interacts with several members of the nuclear receptor superfamily (notably, retinoic acid, thyroid, and vitamin D receptors) (32Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2837) Google Scholar, 33Forman B.M. Umesono K. Chen J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 541-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The resulting heterodimers bind primarily to direct repeats whose spacing is determined by the DBD dimer interface (34Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6326) Google Scholar, 35Perlmann T. Rangarajan P.N. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1411-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Recently, heterodimer formation between MR and GR has been described (16Liu W.-H. Wang J. Sauter N.K. Pearce D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12480-12484Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 18Trapp T. Rupprecht R. Castren M. Reul J.M. Holsboer F. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1457-1462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), challenging the idea that heterodimerization is limited to the nuclear receptors. Our present observations suggest that this important regulatory interaction extends to AR and may extend to the entire family. However, the nuclear receptor and steroid receptor heterodimers differ in several important respects. Notably, in the context of our present observations, there is no evidence that the DBD dimer interface differentially controls receptor half-site spacing selection as it does for the nuclear receptors. Furthermore, there is little evidence that direct repeat elements exist and it appears that steroid receptor homo- and heterodimers bind in a head-to-head fashion. Our present data also add further support to the novel idea that the primary role of the DBD dimer interface is not to stabilize receptor occupancy on the DNA but rather to curtail receptor self-synergy (17Liu W.-H. Wang J. Yu G.-Q. Pearce D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1399-1406PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed this site of direct contact between subunits appears to convey inhibitory information where receptor multimers are bound to clusters of HREs. In light of these observations, it is interesting to note that receptor binding to multiple HREs is highly cooperative and moreover that this cooperativity requires the receptor N terminus (36Wright A.P. Gustafsson J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8283-8287Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 37Schmid W. Strahle U. Schutz G. Schmitt J. Stunnenberg H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2257-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), a domain that is also required for the augmented activity of the dimer mutants (compare Fig. 3 and 5, and see Ref. 17Liu W.-H. Wang J. Yu G.-Q. Pearce D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1399-1406PubMed Google Scholar). While the physiological implications and mechanistic basis of these observations remain to be explored, they clearly challenge the paradigm of a static interaction that merely stabilizes receptor occupancy at a palindromic HRE. Indeed, these data suggest the intriguing possibility that the inhibitory effect of the DBD dimer interface might be modulated by DNA sequence, half-site spacing, or protein factors and thus play a crucial regulatory role in receptor transcriptional activity.

https://openalex.org/W2047814166,"We have generated a transgenic mouse model for astrocytoma by expressing the v-src kinase under control of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) gene regulatory elements in astrocytes. Abnormal astrogliosis was observed in all transgenic animals already at 2 weeks postnatally, frequently followed by the development of dysplastic changes. Later, small proliferative foci arose, and overt astrocytoma developed in the brain and spinal cord in 14.4% of mice after a follow up time of 65 weeks. While early lesions were histologically consistent with low-grade astrocytoma, at later stages most tumors were highly mitotic and frankly malignant. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was expressed by tumor cells already at early stages, suggesting induction by v-src, and it was most pronounced in pseudopalisading cells surrounding necrotic areas, implying additional upregulation by hypoxia. In larger lesions, mitotic activity and expression of flk-1, the cognate receptor of VEGF were induced in endothelial cells. Therefore, end-stage tumors mimicked the morphological and molecular characteristics of human glioblastoma multiforme. Time course and stochastic nature of the process indicate that v-src did not suffice for malignant transformation, and that astrocytomas were the result of a multistep process necessitating co-operation of additional genetic events."
https://openalex.org/W2080101736,"Sentrin is a novel ubiquitin-like protein that protects cells against both anti-Fas and tumor necrosis factor-induced cell death. Antiserum recognizing the N terminus of sentrin revealed the presence of a 18-kDa sentrin monomer, a 90-kDa band (p90), and multiple high molecular mass bands. Because sentrin possesses the conserved Gly-Gly residues near the C terminus, it is likely that these additional bands represent conjugation of sentrin to other proteins in a manner that is similar to the ubiquitination pathway. Transient expression of hemagglutinin epitope-tagged sentrin mutants in COS cells demonstrated that the sentrin C terminus is cleaved, which allows it to be conjugated to other proteins via the conserved C-terminal Gly residue. Immunocytochemical staining and cell fractionation analysis demonstrated that sentrin monomer is localized predominantly to the cytosol. However, p90 and the majority of sentrinized proteins appeared to be localized to the nucleus. When the conserved Gly-Gly residues of sentrin were changed to Gly-Ala, only sentrin monomer and p90 but not the high molecular mass bands were observed. Thus, p90 generation appears to be required for the formation of high molecular mass bands in the nucleus. Taken together, sentrinization represents a novel pathway for nuclear protein modification, which is distinct from ubiquitination."
https://openalex.org/W2064970842,A human nuclear protein that specifically interacts with the constitutive transport element (CTE) of simian retrovirus was identified as adenosine 5′-triphosphate–dependent RNA helicase A. This protein could bind to functional CTE but not to inactive CTE mutants. The interaction of helicase A with CTE was distinct from previously described helicase activity of this protein. Helicase A shuttled from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in the presence of a transcription inhibitor or in cells transiently overexpressing CTE-containing RNA. In vivo colocalization of helicase A and CTE was observed in experiments that combined in situ hybridization and immunostaining. These results suggest that helicase A plays a role in the nuclear export of CTE-containing RNA.
https://openalex.org/W2094431180,"Interleukin-2 (IL-2) activates the receptor-associated Janus family tyrosine kinases, Jak1 and Jak3, which in turn phosphorylate and activate specific STAT proteins (signal transducers and activators of transcription), such as STAT5.

We report here that IL-2-induced DNA-binding activity and tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 are stabilized by a proteasome inhibitor MG132; however, no detectable ubiquitination of the STAT proteins is observed. This sustained STAT5 activation can be blocked by protein kinase inhibitors, which is consistent with the ability of the proteasome inhibitor to stabilize IL-2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 and Jak3.

Members of the cytokine receptor superfamily recruit the Jak family kinases to phosphorylate and activate downstream STAT proteins. STAT proteins are latent cytoplasmic transcription factors that, upon activation by tyrosine phosphorylation, translocate to the nucleus and bind to specific regulatory elements that control gene expression. Diversity in cellular responses to different cytokines is determined in part by selective association of cytokine receptors with different Jak kinases and subsequent phosphorylation of different STAT proteins (4Leonard W.J.

While the mechanisms involved in Jak and STAT activation are being delineated, the mechanisms underlying their subsequent deactivation are still largely unknown. Based on the observation that there is a good correlation between tyrosine dephosphorylation and inactivation of both Jak and STAT proteins, the roles of protein-tyrosine phosphatases in down-regulating the Jak-STAT pathways have been suggested. Indeed, there is genetic and biochemical evidence indicating that protein-tyrosine phosphatases are critical in regulating distinct Jak kinases within specific cytokine receptor complexes (13David M. Chen H.E. Goelz S. Larner A.C. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7050-7058Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 14Klingmuller U. Lorenz U. Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Lodish H.F.

The evidence for the involvement of specific protein-tyrosine phosphatases in dephosphorylating STAT proteins, however, is more indirect (16David M. Grimley P.M. Finbloom D.S. Larner A.C. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6262-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Another important mechanism in regulating signal transduction is proteolysis (19Ciechanover A.

The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, in particular, plays an important role in degrading a number of cellular proteins, including transcription factors (21Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar, 22Trier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D.

Biol. 1995; 15: 7106-7116Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The target proteins are first tagged with multiple molecules of the small protein ubiquitin and then destroyed by the multisubunit proteasome complex. Recently, there have been reports indicating the potential role of proteasome-mediated proteolysis in down-regulating STAT1 activity following interferon-γ (IFN-γ) stimulation. However, one report provided evidence that STAT1 itself is ubiquitinated and degraded (24Kim T.K. Maniatis T. Science. 1996; 273: 1717-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), while another report suggested that its upstream signaling pathway is the target of proteasomes (18Haspel R.L. Salditt-Georgieff M. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6262-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In this report, we address the possible role of proteasome-mediated protein degradation in modulating STAT5 activity following stimulation with interleukin-2 (IL-2) to determine if proteasomes are involved in regulating other STAT proteins in response to diverse cytokines. Furthermore, we investigate whether the STAT proteins themselves or the upstream signaling molecules, such as the Jak kinases, are modulated through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Maintenance of the IL-2-dependent cell line CTLL-20 has been described earlier (25Ravichandran K.S. Igras V. Shoelson S.E. Fesik S.W. Burakoff S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5275-5280Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). For IL-2 stimulation experiments, exponentially growing CTLL-20 cells were washed three times in RPMI 1640 medium, resuspended in medium without IL-2, and starved for 4 h at 37 °C. IL-2-deprived CTLL-20 cells were then stimulated with 30 units/ml of recombinant human IL-2 for various times as indicated in the figure legends. Recombinant human IL-2 was a gift of Dr. J. Sepinwall (Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Nutley, NJ). The oligonucleotides specific for STAT5 binding were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) (sc-2565). The proteasome inhibitor MG132 and calpain inhibitor II were from Peptide Institute, Inc. (Louisville, KY) and Boehringer Mannheim, respectively. Me2SO, genistein, and staurosporine were from Sigma. Anti-STAT5 antibodies used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (sc-835) and Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) (S21520), respectively. Anti-Jak1 antibodies used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY) (06-272) and Transduction Laboratories (J24320), respectively. Anti-Jak3 antibodies used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were from Upstate Biotechnology (06–342) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (sc-1079), respectively. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibody RC20H was obtained from Transduction Laboratories. CTLL-20 cells were washed once with PBS supplemented with 1 mmNa3VO4 (ortho) and once with PBS supplemented with 1 mm Na3VO4 (ortho) and 5 mm NaF. Nuclear extracts were prepared from washed cell pellets essentially as described earlier (26Yu C.-L. Meyer D.J. Campbell G.S. Larner A.C. Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. Jove R. Science. 1995; 269: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar), except for the modification of the hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm KCl). STAT5 gel shift oligonucleotides were labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. EMSA was performed as described previously (26Yu C.-L. Meyer D.J. Campbell G.S. Larner A.C. Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. Jove R. Science. 1995; 269: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). CTLL-20 cells were washed once with PBS supplemented with 1 mmNa3VO4 (ortho) and once with PBS supplemented with 1 mm Na3VO4 (ortho) and 10 mm NaF. Preparation of cell lysates, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting were done essentially as described elsewhere (24Kim T.K. Maniatis T. Science. 1996; 273: 1717-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar,27Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). Dilutions of different antibodies for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting and subsequent detection by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system were performed as recommended by the manufacturers. To determine if proteasome-mediated proteolysis is involved in modulating STAT activity in response to cytokines, such as IL-2, we examined the effects of a proteasome inhibitor (MG132) on STAT5 activation induced by IL-2 (28Gaffen S.L. Lai S.Y. Xu W. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Goldsmith M.A. Greene W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7192-7196Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 29Wakao H. Harada N. Kitamura T. Mui A.L. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2527-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). An IL-2-dependent cell line CTLL-20 was deprived of IL-2, pretreated with the carrier Me2SO, MG132, or a cysteine protease inhibitor (calpain inhibitor II) for 1 h and then stimulated with IL-2 for 15 min to 2 h. We analyzed nuclear extracts by EMSA using a labeled probe specific for STAT5 DNA binding activity (Fig. 1). In Me2SO-treated cells, IL-2 induced rapid and transient STAT5 DNA binding activity (lanes 1–6). This DNA binding activity involves both STAT5a and STAT5b, as determined by supershift assays using specific antibodies (data not shown). This IL-2-induced STAT5 DNA binding activity was sustained in the presence of MG132 (lanes 7–12), but not calpain inhibitor II (lanes 13–15). This result demonstrates that proteasome-mediated protein degradation, but not proteolysis in general, is involved in modulating IL-2-induced STAT5 activity. In many cases, phosphorylation of target proteins is required for their ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by proteasomes (24Kim T.K. Maniatis T. Science. 1996; 273: 1717-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 27Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T.

Linskens M.H.K. Sadis S. Rubin D.M. Futcher B. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 731-741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether active STAT5 is directly degraded by proteasomes, we prepared cell lysates from IL-2-stimulated cells in the absence or presence of MG132 under conditions that should preserve ubiquitinated proteins (24Kim T.K. Maniatis T. Science. 1996; 273: 1717-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 27Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). Anti-STAT5 immunoprecipitates were prepared from cell lysates and analyzed by protein immunoblotting with antibody to phosphotyrosine or anti-STAT5 mAb (Fig. 2). The anti-STAT5 antibodies used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting recognize both STAT5a and STAT5b. As a result, STAT5 proteins appear as broad bands on immunoblots, and the bands become even broader when some of the STAT5 proteins are phosphorylated and migrate slower in SDS-polyacrylamide gels (32Lin J.X. Mietz J. Modi W.S. John S. Leonard W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10738-10744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Consistent with its DNA binding activity, IL-2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 is prolonged by MG132 (Fig. 2, lanes 9–14 compared with lanes 3–8). Proteins conjugated with multiple molecules of ubiquitin appear as a ladder of higher molecular mass proteins in SDS-polyacrylamide gels (24Kim T.K. Maniatis T. Science. 1996; 273: 1717-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 27Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). We could not detect any ubiquitinated STAT5 in the presence of MG132 either in phosphotyrosine or STAT5 immunoblots. This result suggests that inactivation of STAT5 following IL-2-induced activation is mostly due to dephosphorylation, but not removal of active STAT5 through a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. To further confirm that tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT5 is not the direct target of proteasomes, we examined the effects of protein kinase inhibitors on IL-2-induced DNA-binding activity (Fig.3 A) and tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig.3 B) of STAT5. Two protein kinase inhibitors were tested: genistein, a protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and staurosporine, a broad spectrum protein kinase inhibitor. Both inhibitors have been shown to block cytokine-induced STAT activation (18Haspel R.L. Salditt-Georgieff M. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6262-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 24Kim T.K. Maniatis T. Science. 1996; 273: 1717-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 33Bhat G.J. Thekkumkara T.J. Thomas W.G. Conrad K.M. Baker K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31443-31449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We first stimulated CTLL-20 cells, which were pretreated with either Me2SO or MG132, with IL-2 to accumulate a pool of active STAT5 (lanes 2 and 9). Genistein, staurosporine, or carrier Me2SO were then added to block further upstream signaling that would activate STAT5. As expected, in the absence of MG132, treatment with both protein kinase inhibitors results in rapid dephosphorylation of STAT5 with a rapid decrease in STAT5 DNA binding activity (lanes 5–8). If active STAT5 proteins are directly destroyed by proteasomes, MG132 should still be able to stabilize these pre-activated proteins, even without continuous generation of active STAT5. Consistent with our previous conclusion that proteasomes do not directly degrade tyrosine-phosphorylated, active STAT5, both protein kinase inhibitors almost completely abolished STAT5 phosphorylation and activation in the presence of MG132 (lanes 12–15). Moreover, this result indicates that protein kinases are important in maintaining IL-2-induced prolonged STAT5 activation by MG132. Jak1 and Jak3 are the two Janus family nonreceptor tyrosine kinases that become tyrosine-phosphorylated and activated by IL-2 stimulation, which in turn activate the STAT proteins (34Johnston J.A. Kawamura M. Kirken R.A. Chen Y.Q. Blake T.B. Shibuya K. Ortaldo J.R. McVicar D.W. O'Shea J.J. Nature. 1994; 370: 151-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 35Johnston J.A. Bacon C.M. Finbloom D.S. Rees R.C. Kaplan D. Shibuya K. Ortaldo J.R. Gupta S. Chen Y.Q. Giri J.D. O'Shea J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8705-8709Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). To determine if sustained Jak activation contributes to prolonged STAT5 activation by IL-2 in the presence of MG132, anti-Jak1 and anti-Jak3 immunoprecipitates were prepared from cell lysates and analyzed by immunoblotting with antibody to phosphotyrosine. As shown in Fig.4, IL-2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of both Jak1 (panel A) and Jak3 (panel B) was prolonged in the presence of MG132 (compare lanes 3 and 6) and correlated well with sustained STAT5 activity. Without IL-2 stimulation, however, MG132 itself does not enhance tyrosine phosphorylation of either Jak1 or Jak3 above background (lane 7). Furthermore, under conditions that preserve protein ubiquitination (24Kim T.K. Maniatis T. Science. 1996; 273: 1717-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar,27Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar), we were unable to detect any ubiquitinated Jak1 or Jak3 in the presence of MG132 (lanes 5 and 6). This observation suggests that inactivation of Jak kinases following IL-2-induced activation is mostly due to tyrosine dephosphorylation instead of removal of active Jak proteins through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Consistent with this explanation, there was no detectable loss of either Jak proteins after IL-2 stimulation in the absence of MG132 (lanes 2 and 3, lower panels). These findings suggest that MG132 may sustain IL-2-induced STAT5 activation by maintaining tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 and Jak3. Recent studies have shown that proteasome-mediated proteolysis down-regulates STAT1 activity subsequent to IFN-γ-induced activation either by degrading active STAT1 (24Kim T.K. Maniatis T. Science. 1996; 273: 1717-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) or by blocking upstream signaling (18Haspel R.L. Salditt-Georgieff M. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6262-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Our results that the proteasome inhibitor MG132 stabilizes IL-2-induced STAT5 activation further support the notion that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway does play an important role in regulating STAT activity in response to multiple cytokines. Even though active STAT1 may be removed through this pathway in some cases (24Kim T.K. Maniatis T. Science. 1996; 273: 1717-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), we provide further evidence indicating that this mechanism is not generalizable to all STAT proteins in response to different cytokines. First, Haspel et al. (18Haspel R.L. Salditt-Georgieff M. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6262-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) demonstrated that STAT1 is quantitatively preserved through the activation-inactivation cycle following IFN-γ stimulation. Second, as demonstrated by our findings, proteasomes modulate IL-2-initiated signaling pathways upstream of STAT5, instead of directly destroying active STAT5 proteins. Haspel et al. (18Haspel R.L. Salditt-Georgieff M. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6262-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) also reported that proteasome inhibitors prolonged signaling from the IFN-γ receptors after ligand stimulation by showing sustained tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptors in the presence of MG132. They proposed that proteasome inhibitors may prevent the internalization and subsequent proteolysis of the ligand or receptor or both. The alternative, but not mutually exclusive explanation, is that the proteasome inhibitor MG132 may stabilize active Jak kinases, which are the kinases phosphorylating both the cytokine receptors and the downstream STAT proteins. Consistent with this possibility, we clearly demonstrate here that IL-2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 and Jak3 is maintained in the presence of MG132. It has become increasingly evident that protein-tyrosine phosphatases play important roles in modulating Jak-STAT signaling pathways in response to different cytokines (13David M. Chen H.E. Goelz S. Larner A.C. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7050-7058Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 14Klingmuller U. Lorenz U. Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Lodish H.F.

Even though we cannot completely rule out the possibility that small amounts of tyrosine-phosphorylated, active Jak kinases are subjected to proteasome-mediated protein degradation, our results are more consistent with the involvement of protein-tyrosine phosphatases in modulating Jak activity. Therefore, we propose that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway down-regulates a phosphatase inhibitor(s), which normally inhibits protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity directed toward the Jak kinases. The proteasome inhibitor MG132 stabilizes the phosphatase inhibitor(s), prevents dephosphorylation of the Jak kinases, and results in prolonged signaling by activating downstream STAT proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2155219498,"Despite myriads of biological activities ascribed to uteroglobin (UG), a steroid-inducible secreted protein, its physiological functions are unknown. Mice in which the uteroglobin gene was disrupted had severe renal disease that was associated with massive glomerular deposition of predominantly multimeric fibronectin (Fn). The molecular mechanism that normally prevents Fn deposition appears to involve high-affinity binding of UG with Fn to form Fn-UG heteromers that counteract Fn self-aggregation, which is required for abnormal tissue deposition. Thus, UG is essential for maintaining normal renal function in mice, which raises the possibility that an analogous pathogenic mechanism may underlie genetic Fn-deposit human glomerular disease."

Tyrosine phosphorylation of Eps15 is transient and occurs within 2 min of EGF stimulation (1Fazioli F. Minichiello L. Matoskova B. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5814-5828Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In addition, EGF stimulation results in the appearance on SDS-polyacrylamide gels of a slowly migrating band of Eps15 of approximately 150 kDa. Tyrosine kinase activity of the EGF receptor was found to be required for this apparent increase in molecular mass of Eps15 (7van Delft S. Verkleij A.J. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M.P. NATO ASI Series. 1997; 101: 151-161Google Scholar). Expression of Eps15 cDNA in bacteria shows the presence of only the 142-kDa form, suggesting that Eps15 is undergoing an EGF-induced post-translational modification (1Fazioli F. Minichiello L. Matoskova B. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5814-5828Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In this paper we investigated the nature of this post-translational modification of Eps15. We found that the appearance of the high molecular mass form of Eps15 is not due to EGF-induced hyperphosphorylation. Instead, we found that the 8-kDa increase in molecular mass was caused by monoubiquitination of Eps15. This indicates that EGF induces two different modes of post-translational modification of Eps15: tyrosine phosphorylation and ubiquitination. HER14 fibroblasts (NIH3T3 fibroblasts stably transfected with human EGF receptor cDNA) were cultured in bicarbonate buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisely, UK) supplemented with 7.5% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS) (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. Cells were grown in 60-, 100-, or 175-mm dishes (Nunc Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) till 80% confluency. Cells were serum-starved in DMEM with 0% v/v FCS for 24 h before stimulation with 50 ng/ml EGF. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmbenzamidine, 100 mm NaF, and 1 mmNa3VO4) at 4 °C for 5 min, scraped from the dish, and centrifuged for 5 min at 12,000 × g in an Eppendorf centrifuge. Total cell lysate samples were prepared by adding Laemmli sample buffer to the RIPA lysates. For immunoprecipitations, the RIPA lysates were incubated with 25 μl of a 1:1 suspension of protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged. Supernatants were incubated with anti-Eps15 antibody (8Schumacher C. Knudsen B. Ohuchi T. Di Fiore P.P. Glassman R.H. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15341-15347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) for 2 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, protein A-Sepharose was added, and after a further incubation of 2 h, the immunoprecipitates were washed three times, once with RIPA-buffer, once with high salt buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100), and finally once with low salt buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100). For alkaline phosphatase treatment, immunoprecipitates were incubated in phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, and 1 mm EDTA) with 50 units of alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany) at 37 °C for 30 min. Heat-inactivated alkaline phosphatase was prepared by incubating the alkaline phosphatase at 95 °C for 15 min. The beads were boiled in 20 μl of Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min, and proteins were separated by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western blotted onto PVDF membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford MA, USA), and probed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Eps15, mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine PY20 (Transduction laboratories, Lexington KY), or rabbit polyclonal anti-ubiquitin antibodies (antibody kindly provided by Dr. A. Ciechanover). Protein bands were visualized by Enhanced Chemiluminescence (Renaissance, DuPont NEN, Boston, MA) using peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit or rabbit-anti-mouse immunoglobulins (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Pennsylvania, PA). To determine the N-terminal amino acid sequence of Eps15, proteins of immunoprecipitates were separated on a 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The proteins were stained with Ponceau S (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), and the Eps15 bands were cut out of the membrane, washed thoroughly with distilled water, and subjected to Edman degradation (9Edman P. Acta. Chem. Scand. 1950; 4: 283-293Crossref Google Scholar, 10Dopheide T.A.A. Moore S. Stein W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1833-1837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). High pressure liquid chromatography was used for analysis of degradation products. Inhibition of endocytosis in HER14 cells was performed by potassium depletion (11Larkin J.M. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1983; 33: 273-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), by incubating the cells in hypertonic medium (12Daukas G. Zigmond S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1673-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), by acidification of the cytosol (13Sandvig K. Olsnes S. Petersen O.W. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 679-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), or by an incubation of the cells at 4 °C (14Dunn W.A. Hubbard A.L. Aronson N.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5971-5978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For potassium depletion, cells were washed twice with depletion buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.14 m NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 g/l d-glucose). Subsequently, cells were incubated for 5 min with a hypotonic buffer consisting of one part depletion buffer and one part H2O. Next, the cells were incubated for a further 30 min in depletion buffer at 37 °C. Control cells were incubated with the same buffer supplemented with 10 mm KCl. Inhibition of endocytosis by hypertonic shock of cells was performed using hypertonic medium consisting of DMEM supplemented with 0.45m sucrose. Cells were washed twice with hypertonic medium before a 30-min incubation at 37 °C in this medium. For inhibition of endocytosis by acidification of the cytosol, cells were incubated for 10 min in DMEM, pH 5.0, supplemented with 10 mm acetic acid. Control cells were incubated in DMEM, pH 5.0, without acetic acid. Inhibition of endocytosis by an incubation at 4 °C was performed by placing the cells for 30 min at this temperature in DMEM-Hepes 0% FCS, supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. For all experiments, cells were serum-starved for 24 h prior to treatment with EGF. Internalization assays were performed using a protocol modified from Haigler et al. (15Haigler H.T. Maxfield F.R. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1239-1241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HER14 cells were grown on 6-well dishes to 80% confluency and incubated for 30 min with 1 ng/ml 125I-EGF in DMEM containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Nonspecific EGF binding was measured in the presence of 500-fold molar excess of unlabeled EGF. Following this incubation, the medium was removed and the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Surface-bound EGF was removed by successive incubation of the cells with 0.2 m sodium acetate, pH 3.5, containing 150 mm NaCl (acid wash) for 5 and 1 min, respectively. The acid wash solution represented the surface-bound radioactivity. Internalized ligand was determined by lysis of the cells by incubation with 1 n NaOH for 5 min at 37 °C. The rate of endocytosis was expressed as the ratio of internal and surface-bound EGF. To determine the nature of the EGF-induced increase in the molecular mass of Eps15, we investigated whether this increase is caused by tyrosine phosphorylation. HER14 fibroblasts expressing the human EGF receptor were stimulated with EGF, and Eps15 was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates. One Eps15 immunoprecipitate was treated with alkaline phosphatase, whereas two controls were either left untreated or treated with heat-inactivated phosphatase. The proteins were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto PVDF membrane. After detection of tyrosine phosphorylated Eps15 by anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, two Eps15 bands of 142 and 150 kDa were visible in untreated cells. This indicates that both forms of Eps15 are phosphorylated (Fig.1, Con). The two Eps15 bands of 142 and 150 kDa are each resolved into a tightly spaced doubled, and both forms of the doubled are tyrosyl phosphorylated. The reason for the slight difference in molecular mass is not known but could be due to differential splicing. Treatment of Eps15 with alkaline phosphatase resulted in the complete dephosphorylation of Eps15 (Fig. 1,AP), whereas treatment with heat-inactivated alkaline phosphatase did not change the phosphorylation state of Eps15 (Fig. 1,HI-AP). Reprobing the same blot with anti-Eps15 antibodies showed that irrespective of the phosphorylation state of Eps15, the 142- and 150-kDa forms were present (Fig. 1). These results demonstrate that the appearance of high molecular mass form of Eps15 is not the result of tyrosine phosphorylation. The approximate increase of 8 kDa in the modified form of Eps15 stimulated us to investigate the possible monoubiquitination of Eps15. Ubiquitin is a highly conserved protein of about 8 kDa, which is abundant in eukaryotes. Ubiquitin is found free or covalently linked via its C terminus to NH2 groups of one or more lysine residues of a variety of cytoplasmic, nuclear, and integral membrane proteins (16Finley D. Chau V. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 25-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). To investigate the monoubiquitination of Eps15, Eps15 was immunoprecipitated from HER14 cells that were either left unstimulated or stimulated with 50 ng/ml EGF. The protein samples were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the Western blot was probed with anti-Eps15 antibodies. A clear mobility shift was seen after EGF stimulation but not in unstimulated cells (Fig. 2). Subsequently, the Western blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-ubiquitin antibodies. In this case only the 150-kDa form of Eps15 was detected, demonstrating that Eps15 becomes monoubiquitinated upon EGF stimulation (Fig. 2). In addition to the appearance of the 150-kDa band, a slight staining of higher molecular mass Eps15 was detected upon EGF addition. This phenomenon was better visible upon longer exposures (data not shown). Eps15 of higher molecular mass was previously also found on Western blots containing immunoprecipitated Eps15 that were stained for phosphotyrosine residues (2van Delft S. Schumacher C. Hage W. Verkleij A.J. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 811-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that Eps15 is not only monoubiquitinated but that a minority of Eps15 may also be multiubiquitinated. To obtain further proof for the ubiquitination of Eps15, the N-terminal sequences of the 142- and 150-kDa Eps15 isoforms were determined by Edman degradation. Because ubiquitin is conjugated via its C terminus to the target proteins, the N terminus of conjugated ubiquitin is still available for Edman degradation. Sequencing of the 142-kDa form of Eps15 did not result in any signal, most probably due to N-terminal blocking. Sequencing of the 150-kDa form of Eps15 resulted in a single protein sequence (Fig. 3). Comparison of these 10 amino acids with the published sequence of bovine ubiquitin revealed that the obtained amino acids are identical to the first amino acids of ubiquitin. Comparison of this sequence with sequences in the SWISS-PROT protein data base did not reveal a relevant match with any other protein than ubiquitin. Based on both the Western blotting results and the N-terminal amino acid sequence, we conclude that Eps15 becomes ubiquitinated after stimulation of the cell with EGF. Because the increase in molecular mass of Eps15 is similar to the molecular mass of ubiquitin (8 kDa), we conclude that Eps15 becomes predominantly monoubiquitinated. Because the approximate ratio of the two Eps15 forms in EGF-stimulated cells was previously determined as 1:1, we estimate that about 50% of Eps15 becomes monoubiquitinated after stimulation of cells with EGF (2van Delft S. Schumacher C. Hage W. Verkleij A.J. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 811-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Both forms of Eps15 become phosphorylated on tyrosine residues (Fig. 1), which indicates that ubiquitination of Eps15 is not required for its phosphorylation. Monoubiquitination of proteins has not frequently been reported. Examples of monoubiquitination are the T cell antigen receptor (17Hou D. Cenciarelli C. Jensen J.P. Nguygen H.B. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14244-14247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), histone H2A (18Davie J.R. Murphy L.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4752-4757Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and cytochrome c (19Sokolik C.W. Cohen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9100-9107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The yeast α-factor receptor has recently been shown to become either mono- or diubiquitinated (20Roth A.F. Davis N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 661-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Multiubiquitination of proteins usually starts on one lysine residue (16Finley D. Chau V. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 25-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Subsequently, this ubiquitin becomes ubiquitinated, resulting in the formation of multiubiquitin chains. Examples of multiubiquitination include cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins but also integral membrane proteins such as receptors for EGF (21Galcheva-Gargova Z. Theroux S.J. Davis R.J. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2649-2655PubMed Google Scholar), growth hormone (22Leung D.W. Spencer S.A. Cachianes G. Hammonds R.G. Collins C. Henzel W.J. Barnard R. Waters M.J. Wood W.I.

Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 25-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The most widely studied function of ubiquitination lies in the targeting of (multiubiquitinated) proteins for degradation to the 26 S proteasome. However, not all ubiquitinated proteins are degraded, suggesting additional functions for ubiquitination besides proteolysis. Treatment of cells with transcription inhibitors resulted in a reduced level of ubiquitinated histone H2B, suggesting a role for ubiquitination in chromatin organization (18Davie J.R. Murphy L.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4752-4757Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been suggested that ubiquitination plays a role in the activation of IκBα, a regulator of the transcription factor NFκB (26Roff M. Thompson J. Rodriquez M.S. Jacque J.M. Baleux F.

Interestingly, a new function for ubiquitination has been recently described for the ubiquitination of plasma membrane receptors. Ubiquitination of both the growth hormone receptor and the α-factor receptor in S. cerevisiae have been implicated in the endocytosis of these receptors (20Roth A.F. Davis N.G. J.

The binding of Eps15 to both adaptor protein complex-2 and clathrin and the presence of Eps15 in clathrin-coated pits and vesicles of mammalian cells suggest a role for Eps15 in the endocytosis of the EGF receptor. To investigate the possible relationship between Eps15 ubiquitination and EGF receptor internalization, we examined the effect of blocking EGF receptor internalization on Eps15 ubiquitination. Internalization of EGF receptors was inhibited in four different ways: by incubation at low temperature, by depleting potassium from the cytosol, by a hypertonic shock of the cells, or by acidification of the cytosol. These methods inhibit different steps in endocytosis: hypertonic shock and incubation at low temperature prevent clustering of receptors (12Daukas G. Zigmond S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1673-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), potassium depletion inhibits the assembly of coated pits (11Larkin J.M. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1983; 33: 273-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), whereas acidification of the cytosol is suggested to inhibit pinching off of clathrin-coated pits from the plasma membrane (13Sandvig K. Olsnes S. Petersen O.W. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 679-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The effect of these conditions on EGF endocytosis was measured using125I-labeled EGF. In control cells EGF was rapidly internalized, whereas under all four endocytosis inhibiting conditions EGF internalization was inhibited for more than 80% (Fig.4). Analysis of Eps15 phosphorylation revealed that in all cases Eps15 became phosphorylated on tyrosine residues (Fig.5 B). These results demonstrate that EGF receptor activity has not been affected by either of these treatments. Interestingly, it was recently reported by Vieira and co-workers (28Vieira A.V. Lamaze C. Schmid S. Science. 1996; 274: 2086-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar) that inhibition of endocytosis using a dynamin mutant resulted in differences in EGF receptor substrate phosphorylation. This indicates that maximum Eps15 phosphorylation is already achieved before the EGF receptor internalization process is initiated. Detection of Eps15 by Western blotting showed that in control cells Eps15 became ubiquitinated after 10 min of EGF stimulation (Fig. 5 A). However, when cells were incubated and stimulated at 4 °C, ubiquitination of Eps15 was completely abolished (Fig. 5 A,row 1). The same results were obtained when endocytosis was inhibited by alternative methods such as potassium depletion (Fig.5 A, row 2), acidification of the cytosol (Fig.5 A, row 3), and hypertonic shock (Fig.5 A, row 4). Together these data show that when endocytosis is inhibited Eps15 monoubiquitination is abolished, but tyrosine phosphorylation remains undisturbed.Figure 5Inhibition of endocytosis prevents Eps15 monoubiquitination. HER14 cells were subjected to four different methods to inhibit endocytosis: low temperature, hypertonic shock, potassium depletion, or cytosol acidification. Subsequently the cells were left unstimulated or stimulated with 50 ng/ml EGF for 10 min. Proteins from the cell lysates were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the Western blots were incubated with anti-Eps15 antibodies (A). Immunoprecipitated (IP) Eps15 was separated in a similar manner, and the Western blots (WB) were incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine (α-p-tyr) antibodies (B). The 142-kDa band of Eps15 and the ubiquitinated 150-kDa band of Eps15 (Eps15-Ub) are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) An interesting question is the possible function of the monoubiquitination of Eps15. The absence of Eps15 ubiquitination under conditions that inhibit EGF receptor internalization indicates that either Eps15 ubiquitination is required for Eps15 endocytosis or EGF receptor endocytosis is a prerequisite for Eps15 ubiquitination. The first possibility is an analogy to what has been reported for the growth hormone receptor in mammalian cells (23Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3806-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) and the α-factor receptor in yeast (20Roth A.F. Davis N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 661-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In this case Eps15 ubiquitination could be involved in the early steps of endocytosis of the EGF receptor. However, inhibition of endocytosis of the α-factor receptor in yeast resulted in an increased ubiquitination of the receptor, which is in contrast to the results presented in this paper (20Roth A.F. Davis N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 661-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Alternatively, our results may indicate that endocytosis is required for Eps15 ubiquitination. This would imply that Eps15 ubiquitination occurs exclusively at a post-surface endocytic transport step. We have shown previously that Eps15 localization is restricted to coated pits and coated vesicles and absent from early endosomes (2van Delft S. Schumacher C. Hage W. Verkleij A.J. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 811-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The monoubiquitination of Eps15 could thus be involved in the targeting of coated pits to the early endosome or in the uncoating of the coated vesicle. Another possibility is that Eps15 ubiquitination could be involved in the targeting of Eps15 to the 26 S proteasome for its degradation, which is in fact the first described function of protein ubiquitination.

https://openalex.org/W2067030834,"Activation of the erythropoietin receptor is essential for the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of erythroid progenitors. To understand the role of erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) activation in erythroid differentiation, we infected primary erythroid progenitors with high-titer retrovirus encoding the non-hematopoietic prolactin receptor. The infected progenitors responded to prolactin in the absence of Epo by generating fully differentiated erythroid colonies. Therefore, differentiation of erythroid progenitors does not require an intracellular signal generated uniquely by the EpoR; the EpoR does not have an instructive role in erythroid differentiation. We also infected primary erythroid progenitors with retrovirus encoding chimeric receptors containing the extracellular domain of PrlR and the intracellular domain of either the wild-type or truncated EpoRs. A chimeric receptor containing only the membrane-proximal 136 amino acids of the EpoR cytoplasmic domain efficiently supported prolactin-dependent differentiation of erythroid progenitors. Substitution of the single cytoplasmic domain tyrosine in this receptor with phenylalanine (Y343F) eliminated its ability to support differentiation. The minimal EpoR cytoplasmic domain required for erythroid differentiation is therefore the same as that previously reported to be sufficient to support cell proliferation (D'Andrea, A.

The exact role of growth factors in this process is not clear and has been described broadly by two alternative hypotheses. The stochastic hypothesis suggests that commitment of a progenitor to a particular lineage is a stochastic event, subsequent to which cell differentiation proceeds along a predetermined program; growth factors are merely required to ensure the survival and proliferation of committed progenitors (10Korn A.P.

A number of hybrid hypotheses have also been proposed, where, for example, committed progenitors arise stochastically, but their subsequent differentiation and acquisition of the mature phenotype are uniquely induced by lineage-specific growth factors (18Just U.

However, there is a unique requirement for EpoR activation during the subsequent proliferation and terminal differentiation of committed erythroid progenitors: the EpoR−/− CFU-e and BFU-e progenitors fail to give rise to mature erythrocytes unless EpoR is expressed by retroviral infection (21Wu H.

Since the greatest homology between cytokine receptors is found in the Box 1 and Box 2 domains of their membrane-proximal regions (30Murakami M. Narazaki M. Hibi M. Yawata H. Yasukawa K. Hamaguchi M.

We also examined whether the entirety of the cytosolic domain of the EpoR can be replaced with the corresponding segment of a different receptor; we chose the prolactin receptor, which plays no role in hematopoiesis, but belongs to the same subfamily of cytokine receptors as EpoR, and shares many of its signaling molecules.

We therefore examined whether the distal half of the EpoR cytoplasmic domain is essential for differentiation of primary fetal liver erythroid progenitors. We also examined whether the entirety of the cytosolic domain of the EpoR can be replaced with the corresponding segment of a different receptor; we chose the prolactin receptor, which plays no role in hematopoiesis, but belongs to the same subfamily of cytokine receptors as EpoR, and shares many of its signaling molecules.

https://openalex.org/W1967301981,"Transcription factors of the Stat gene family are selectively activated by many hormones and cytokines. Stat5 originally was cloned as a prolactin-stimulated DNA-binding protein, but is also activated by non-lactogenic cytokines in many cell types. The recent identification of two distinct Stat5 genes, which encode a 94-kDa Stat5a and a 92-kDa Stat5b as well as several lower molecular weight isoforms, suggests additional complexity and combinatorial possibilities for transcriptional regulation. We now report a biochemical analysis of prolactin activation of Stat proteins in Nb2 lymphocytes, which was associated with: 1) rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5a, Stat5b, a COOH-terminally truncated 80-kDa Stat5 form, Stat1α, and Stat3; 2) rapid and selective formation of Stat5a/b heterodimers, without involvement of Stat1α or Stat3; 3) marked serine, but not threonine phosphorylation of Stat5a and Stat5b; and 4) the appearance of two qualitatively distinct Stat5 protein complexes, which discriminated between oligonucleotides corresponding to the prolactin response elements of the β-casein and interferon regulatory factor-1 gene promoters. Collectively, our analyses showed that Stat5a and Stat5b respond similarly to prolactin receptor activation, but also suggested that the two genes have evolved unique properties that may contribute to the specificity of receptors that utilize Stat5 signaling proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2325363379,"Tax1, a transcriptional trans-activator of the Human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I), induces the expression of many cellular genes through interaction with at least three distinct cellular transcription factors; CREB/ATF, NF-κB, and SRF. This Tax1-induced activation of cellular genes is considered to be a critical event in T-cell transformation by HTLV-I. To elucidate the role of each Tax1-inducible transcriptional pathway in T-cell transformation, we introduced Tax1 mutants with different trans-activating phenotypes into peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) by retroviral vectors. Analysis of these PBLs revealed that activation of the NF-κB pathway is sufficient to promote the growth response to IL-2. However, for the clonal expansion of CD4+ T-cells, which is a characteristic result of HTLV-I infection, activation of the CREB/ATF and SRF pathways is also required."

The extent of MAO activity is associated with various behavioral aberrations. MAO A deficiency was found to be associated with impulsive aggressive behavior (14Brunner H.G. Nelen M. Breakefield X.O.

Inhibitors of MAO A are widely used to treat affective disorders, whereas MAO B inhibitors are of benefit for subjects with neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease. MAO B inhibition is associated with the enhanced activity of dopamine, as well as with the decreased production of hydrogen peroxide, a reactive oxygen species. One needs to know which region or residues in the molecule confer MAO A or MAO B enzymatic activity to develop highly selective inhibitors as well as to elucidate recognition mechanisms of related enzymes. cDNAs of the two isozymes of MAO have been cloned from human, bovine, and rat tissues (16Bach A.W.J.

Primary structures deduced from the cDNAs revealed that rat liver MAO A and B consist of 526 and 520 amino acid residues, respectively, and that the amino acid sequences of the two enzymes are approximately 70% identical and show more than 90% sequence similarity when conservative amino acid substitutions are included (19Kuwahara T.

We used chimeric enzymes constructed from MAO A and MAO B and found that the region between about residues 120–220 is responsible for determination of the substrate specificity of MAOs, whereas the middle portion, about residues 220–400, may relate to the relative catalytic activity toward substrates (21Tsugeno Y. Hirashiki I. Ogata F. Ito A. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 118: 974-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Essentially the same results were reported by Gottowik et al. (22Gottowik J.

In the present work, we attempted to elucidate amino acids responsible for substrate recognition of MAOs. We obtained evidence that a single amino acid, Phe-208 in MAO A and Ile-199 at the corresponding position in MAO B, has a vital role determining the substrate selectivity of MAOs.

Restriction endonucleases and DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from Nippon Gene (Toyama, Japan), Toyobo (Osaka, Japan), Takara Shuzo (Kyoto, Japan), and New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA).

Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with synthetic oligonucleotides, according to the procedure used by Kunkel et al. (25Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The introduced mutation was verified by sequence analysis following the chain termination method (26Sanger F. Coulson A. Barrell B. Smith A. Roe B. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 143: 161-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (2197) Google Scholar). The original and chimeric cDNAs constructed above were then inserted into pYcDE2, a yeast expression vector. Transformation of yeast cells,Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain TD-1 (his4–38, ura3–52, trp1–289, cans, MAK(k) [cir+]) with plasmid pYcDE2, was done according to Ito et al. (27Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Trp+transformants were selected on SD synthetic medium containing 2% glucose, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 20 mg/ml each of adenine sulfate and uracil, and 0.5% casamino acid. The transformed cells were cultured to the mid-logarithmic phase in YPD medium with vigorous shaking, and then the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2,200 × g for 10 min. Mitochondrial fraction was prepared as described (21Tsugeno Y. Hirashiki I. Ogata F. Ito A. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 118: 974-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, after treatment of the cells with Zymolyase 100 T (2 mg/g wet cells) for 60 min at 30 °C, the resultant spheroplasts were lysed in 10 mmHEPES-KOH buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.65 m sorbitol, 1 mm EDTA, and a protease inhibitor mixture (0.1 mg/ml chymostatin, 2 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin A, 1.1 mg/ml phosphoramidon, 7.2 mg/ml E-64, 0.5 mg/ml leupeptin, 2.5 mg/ml antipain, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with a Dounce homogenizer. The lysate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to obtain the mitochondrial fraction. The mitochondrial pellet was finally suspended in 10 mm HEPES-KOH buffer, pH 7.4, containing 15% glycerol, 0.65 m sorbitol, and 1 mm EDTA and stored at −80 °C until use. Because each mutant enzyme had a different stability after solubilization of the mitochondrial membranes, we used fresh mitochondrial fractions for MAO activity. The activity was determined by the radiometric procedure described by Wurtmann and Axelrod (28Wurtman R.J. Axelrod J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1963; 12: 1439-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar), using as substrates serotonin, tryptamine, tyramine, and PEA. The assay mixture contained the mitochondrial fraction (50 μg of protein) in a total volume of 60 μl of 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The reaction, initiated by adding the substrate, was run for 20 min at 37 °C and was stopped by the addition of 40 μl of 2 m HCl. When tryptamine and PEA were used as substrate, the reaction time was set within the period (2 min) for which the reaction progressed linearly. The product was extracted with water-saturated ethyl acetate-toluene (1:1 v/v), and the radioactivity that was transferred into the organic solvent phase was estimated in a Packard Tri-Carb liquid scintillation spectrometer. In inhibition experiments, mitochondria were preincubated with various concentrations of clorgyline or deprenyl in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 37 °C for 30 min, and the remaining activity was determined as described above. Comparison of the primary structures of the two forms of rat MAO with those from other species revealed a greater degree of similarity between the same form from different species than between different forms from the same species. The amino acid residues that are identical in different species in each form can be inferred to have been conserved during evolution because of their functional importance. The residues that are conserved among various species but different between the two forms might be those responsible for substrate selectivity of MAO. In a region between residues 120 and 220 that has been determined to be important in conferring substrate selectivity of MAO A and MAO B (21Tsugeno Y. Hirashiki I. Ogata F. Ito A. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 118: 974-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), only nine amino acid residues are identical in each form of MAO but are different between the two forms (amino acid residuesboxed in Fig. 1). Five nonconservative amino acid residues in MAO B (shaded in Fig. 1) were replaced with the corresponding amino acids in MAO A, by site-directed mutation using oligonucleotides. The cDNAs encoding the wild-type and mutated MAOs were introduced into yeast cells, and the mitochondrial fractions were isolated from the cells expressing the enzymes, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Monoamine oxidase activities in the mitochondrial fractions were measured using as substrates serotonin, tryptamine, tyramine, and PEA. As described in the previous report (21Tsugeno Y. Hirashiki I. Ogata F. Ito A. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 118: 974-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the specific activities of the mutant proteins based on mitochondrial protein varied, and the mutants derived from MAO B, even the parent MAO B, usually had very low activity in yeast cells with every substrate used. Thus, a comparison of the Vmax values among the mutant enzymes would be invalid. In the present study, affinity for four substrates (Km) served as a criterion for ascertaining which type of the substrate selectivity was rendered to the mutant enzymes (Table I). The MAO B variants carrying a His residue instead of Leu at position 139, MAO B(L139H), has substantially the same affinity profile for the substrates as that of the wild-type MAO B, that is, high affinity to PEA and no detectable activity toward serotonin. Affinity for the substrates of the mutant with triple substitutions at positions 172, 175, and 177, MAO B(C172N/A175S/T177P), was also unaffected. However, the mutant B(I199F), in which Ile-199 was converted to Phe, exhibited a dramatic increase in affinity for serotonin and tyramine, and their Km values were close to those of MAO A, although practically no change was observed in the affinity for tryptamine but with some decrease in that for PEA. The result indicates that the amino acid residue at position 199 in MAO B is important for selective binding of some substrates such as serotonin and tyramine. Because the above data pointed to Ile-199 as the single most important determinant of substrate selectivity of MAO B, we asked whether the corresponding amino acid in MAO A plays the same role in the substrate recognition. Phe at position 208 in MAO A was mutated to Ile to make the counter mutant of B(I199F), A(F208I). As shown in TableI, the mutation caused a marked reduction in affinity for serotonin and tyramine, to the same level of that in MAO B with practically no change in the affinity to tryptamine and PEA. This confirmed that an amino acid residue at the position 208 in MAO A and the residue at the corresponding position in MAO B plays a vital role in determination of substrate selectivity of MAO A and MAO B.Table IAffinity of wild-type and mutant MAOs for substratesKmSerotoninTyramineTryptaminePEAmmA (wild type)0.31 ± 0.010.40 ± 0.10.23 ± 0.10.24 ± 0.05B (wild type)NC1-aNC, not calculated.

The values given are the means ± S.E. of three experiments. To determine whether structural differences between Ile and Phe, a hydrophobic branched chain and an aromatic ring, respectively, contribute to different affinities for the substrates, Phe-208 in MAO A was replaced with Tyr, Val, and Ala. Mutation of Phe to Tyr had no effect on affinity for all the substrates used. However, mutants in which Phe was converted to the residues with aliphatic side chains, A(F208V) and A(F208A), exhibited exactly the same affinity profile as that of the mutant A(F208I) discussed above. Thus, substrate selectivity of MAO can be explained by the different aromatic and aliphatic side chains of amino acids at this position. Effects of the type-specific inhibitors on the mutation at position 208 in MAO A were examined using clorgyline and deprenyl as inhibitors for MAO A and MAO B, respectively. PEA was used as the substrate because all the enzymes examined oxidized this substrate. IC50values of clorgyline and deprenyl for MAO A were reported to be 0.025 μm and 5.0 μm, respectively, and those for MAO B were reported to be 79 μm and 0.13 μm, respectively (21Tsugeno Y. Hirashiki I. Ogata F. Ito A. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 118: 974-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). 0.5 and 1 μm of clorgyline and deprenyl, respectively, were then used to examine the different sensitivity of the mutants to the two inhibitors (Fig.2). At these concentrations of inhibitors, MAO A activity was abolished by clorgyline, whereas the full activity remained even in the presence of deprenyl. The reverse was true for MAO B. As expected from data on the substrate selectivity of B-type, B(L139H) and B(C172N/A175S/T177P) were inhibited only with deprenyl. However, B(I199F) had substantially the same inhibition pattern as those mutants and MAO B, although the enzyme did exhibit an A-type nature at least with regard to the affinity for serotonin and tyramine. On the contrary, patterns of sensitivity to inhibitors of A(F208I), A(F208V), and A(F208A) converted to that of the B-type enzymes with the single amino acid mutation, as in the case for substrate selectivity. A(F208Y) showed the same inhibitor sensitivity as the parent enzyme. Thus, except for B(I199F), all mutant enzymes had inhibitor sensitivity expected from their substrate selectivity. We obtained evidence that an amino acid residue at position 208 in MAO A and the residue at the corresponding position 199 in MAO B plays an important role in determination of substrate selectivity of MAO A and MAO B. An enzyme with aromatic amino acids, such as Phe and Tyr, at this position has a similar affinity for all substrates examined, whereas ones with amino acids with an aliphatic side chain, such as Ile, Val, and Ala, have little affinity for serotonin and tyramine and a high affinity for tryptamine and PEA, although these amino acids are usually classified as hydrophobic amino acids. A good correlation between aromatic amino acid at this position and MAO A-type substrate specificity was seen in trout MAO (29Chen K. Wu H.-F Gimsby J. Shih J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1226-1233PubMed Google Scholar), which has Phe at this position and properties in substrate specificity and inhibitor sensitivity more like those of mammalian MAO A, although it does share a similar extent of homology (about 70%) with both mammalian MAO A and MAO B. MAO A has a similar affinity for most substrates with aromatic rings, yet over a 1000-fold difference in the affinity among substrates was observed for MAO B. The finding of participation of the aromatic side chain in substrate recognition of MAO A suggests that π-π interaction between aromatic rings of substrates and the enzyme plays a major part in their interaction and could explain why MAO A has a similar affinity for aromatic substrates. This was further confirmed by inhibition experiments using aromatic and nonaromatic compounds. Serotonin oxidizing activity of MAO A was competitively inhibited by PEA and 3-phenyl-1-propylamine with Ki values of about 150 μm, whereas the value of cyclohexane methylamine was over 10 times higher (about 2 mm). On the other hand, the presence of an amino acid with an aliphatic side chain at the position responsible for substrate selectivity of MAO B as well as large differences in its affinity to aromatic substrates indicate involvement of different interactions from the π-π interaction between substrates and the enzyme. PEA and tryptamine were good substrates for MAO B, whereas the enzyme showed practically no activity toward serotonin and tyramine, which have an extra phenolic hydroxyl group to the same carbon skeleton as tryptamine and PEA, respectively. Affinity of the enzymes for serotonin and tyramine was markedly reduced with a single mutation of residue 208 of MAO A from aromatic to aliphatic amino acids. It has been shown that C5–C10 linear aliphatic amines are preferentially oxidized by MAO B (30Yu P.H. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1989; 41: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that a hydrophobic van der Waals' interaction, instead of an aromatic one, seems to be involved in recognition of substrates by MAO B and the phenolic hydroxyl group may strongly interfere such an interaction between substrates and the enzyme. When Ile at position 199 in MAO B was replaced with Phe, aromatic interaction may take place of hydrophobic one in substrate recognition of the mutant enzymes, and it acquired reasonable affinity to compounds with phenolic hydroxyl group. Although most mutant enzymes have the sensitivity to type-specific inhibitors expected from their substrate selectivity, one mutant, B(I199F), exhibited the B-type sensitivity, in contrast to its substrate preference of the A-type. Polarity of the two chloride groups in clorgyline may be too large and strong to be accepted in the substrate-binding pocket of MAO B, even after substitution of Ile-199 by an aromatic amino acid. The present study provides the first experimental evidence for identification of a key amino acid participating the substrate selectivity of MAO. Our observations provide important information for molecular design of highly selective inhibitors."

This deletion mutant tropomyosin spans four instead of the normal seven actins, and most of the tropomyosin region believed to interact with troponin is retained and uninterrupted in the mutant. The mutant tropomyosin was compared with a full-length control molecule that was modified to functionally resemble muscle tropomyosin (Monteiro, P. B., Lataro, R. C., Ferro, J. A., and Reinach, F. C. (1994) J. Biol. Chem.269, 10461–10466). The tropomyosin deletion suppressed the actin-myosin subfragment 1 MgATPase rate and thein vitro sliding of thin filaments over a heavy meromyosin-coated surface. This inhibition was not reversed by troponin plus Ca2+. Comparable tropomyosin affinities for actin, regardless of the deletion, suggest that the deleted region has little interaction with actin in the absence of other proteins. Similarly, the deletion did not weaken binding of the troponin-tropomyosin complex to actin. Furthermore, Ca2+ had a 2-fold effect on troponin-tropomyosin's affinity for actin, regardless of the deletion. Notably, the deletion greatly weakened tropomyosin binding to myosin subfragment 1-decorated actin, with the full-length tropomyosin having a 100-fold greater affinity.

Tropomyosin is an extended α-helical coiled-coil that spans seven actin monomers. Periodicity in tropomyosin's amino acid sequence and also in its modeled three-dimensional structure have led to the proposal that it contains 7 and possibly 14 quasiequivalent regions (1McLachlan A.D.

However, deletion of ⅔ of a putative actin binding motif abolishes binding and therefore regulation (4Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Varnell T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 885-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In the present study a mutant tropomyosin designated rαTmΔ(49–167) with three of the seven regions (regions 2, 3, and 4) deleted has been created. 119 amino acids are absent from this mutant, corresponding to approximately 3 × 39 ⅔ residues per region as defined by McLachlan and Stewart (1McLachlan A.D. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 103: 271-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). rαTmΔ(49–167) is long enough to span only four actin monomers, yet the present report shows it to behave normally in many respects.Recent structural data suggest that tropomyosin can be positioned in three different locations on the actin filament. These positions are dependent upon the presence or the absence of troponin, calcium, and myosin. Troponin in the absence of Ca2+ induces an “off” state in which only weak transitory myosin S-1 binding occurs (5Lehman W. Vibert P. Uman P. Craig R. J. Mol.

Tropomyosin in this position blocks actin sites necessary for strong myosin S-1 binding as modeled by Rayment et al. and others (6Rayment I. Holden H.M. Whittaker M. Yohn C.B. Lorenz M. Holmes K.C.

When either Ca2+ is added or troponin is removed, there is a 25 ° rotation of the tropomyosin from the off state, partially uncovering actin residues involved in myosin binding (7Lorenz M.

An additional 10 ° rotation of tropomyosin about the actin filament occurs when myosin S-1 is bound to the actin (7Lorenz M. Poole K.J.V. Popp D. Rosenbaum G. Holmes K.C. J. Mol.

J. 1996; 70 (abstr.): 15Google Scholar).The structural studies above suggest that tropomyosin-actin interactions are highly diverse. Accordingly, several conditions were examined to characterize the deletion tropomyosin of the present report. The deletion was found not to alter tropomyosin-actin binding under almost all conditions. However, the deletion had a major effect on this process in the presence of myosin S-1. Furthermore, rαTmΔ(49–167) was found to inhibit in vitro motility and thin filament-myosin S-1 MgATPase activity. The functional significance of these interrelated observations is discussed.DISCUSSIONTropomyosin has been shown by several investigators to have different affinities for actin depending upon the presence or the absence of myosin, troponin, and Ca2+ (reviewed in Ref.37Tobacman L.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 447-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The addition of troponin increases tropomyosin's affinity for actin (23Hill L.E. Mehegan J.P. Butters C.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16106-16113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), perhaps due to troponin-actin interactions (37Tobacman L.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 447-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), and causes it to shift position when Ca2+ is added (7Lorenz M. Poole K.J.V. Popp D. Rosenbaum G. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 108-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 8Vibert P. Craig R. Uman P. Lehman W. Biophys. J. 1996; 70 (abstr.): 15Google Scholar, 9Poole K.J.V. Holmes K.C. Rayment I.

Biol. 1997; 266: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Myosin S-1 also increases tropomyosin's affinity for actin (24Cassell M. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12867-12872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 35Eaton B.L. Science. 1976; 192: 1337-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 36Szczesna D. Borovikov Y.S. Sobieszek A. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1989; 370: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and emerging results (9Poole K.J.V. Holmes K.C. Rayment I. Lorenz M. Biophys. J. 1994; 68 (abstr.): 348Google Scholar, 11Vibert P. Craig R. Lehman W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 12Lehman W. Craig R. Uman P. Vibert P. Biophys. J. 1996; 70 (abstr.): 15Google Scholar) indicate that it induces tropomyosin to shift to a third location on the actin, different from either the relaxed state or the Ca2+ state. These different quaternary structures for the thin filament may correspond to the blocked, closed, and opened states proposed in Ref. 38McKillop D.F.A. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 693-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar. Our results suggest that the deleted region, tropomyosin regions 2, 3, and 4, is required for stabilizing the myosin-induced state but is not required for other conformational states. The idea that the ends rather than the middle of tropomyosin are most important for actin binding in the absence of myosin is supported by several lines of evidence. First, in electron microscopy data obtained under conditions (0.5 mmMgCl2) poorly favoring tropomyosin-actin binding, Mabuchi (39Mabuchi K. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 278-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) observes tropomyosin molecules tethered by one end to the actin filament. Second, the use of carboxypeptidase-A-digested tropomyosin or unacetylated tropomyosin severely decreases tropomyosin's affinity for actin (13Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Heald R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9730-9735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Heeley D.H. Golosinska K. Smillie L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9971-9978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this effect is not due to diminished cooperativity (15Willadsen K.A. Butters C.A. Hill L.E. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23746-23752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Butters C.A. Willadsen K.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15565-15570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, Hitchcock-DeGregori and An (17Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. An Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3600-3603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) showed that deletion of tropomyosin regions 2 and 3 had only a 2-fold effect on troponin-tropomyosin binding to actin. This prior study differed from the present results, because two rather than three of the quasiequivalent regions were deleted and because the fusion dipeptide at the NH2 terminus was absent. This latter difference compensates for the absence of acetylation in bacterially expressed tropomyosin and permits experiments in the absence of troponin. Such experiments now demonstrate that the deleted region does not contribute significantly to actin binding when troponin is absent.The deletion of tropomyosin regions 2, 3, and 4 also had no effect on troponin-mediated changes in thin filament assembly. For both full-length and deletion tropomyosins, troponin promoted binding to actin (compare Fig. 4 with the 150 mm KCl data in Fig. 1). In these assays the Kapp values for full-length tropomyosin-troponin and 4/7 length tropomyosin-troponin are very close in value. This parallels published findings that deletion of regions 2 and 3 had little effect (17Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. An Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3600-3603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 also shows both recombinant tropomyosin-troponin complexes have a decreased affinity for actin upon the addition of Ca2+. The decrease in affinity is comparable between full-length and shortened tropomyosins, suggesting that the deletion of these three regions does not interfere with Ca2+-induced changes in the thin filament conformation. This would be very significant because it suggests that the shortened tropomyosin is capable of undergoing calcium-induced changes yet inhibits MgATPase activity (Fig. 3) and in vitro motility (Table I). Other data will be needed to establish this point definitively, however.Full-length rαTm binds actin at least 100-fold more tightly in the presence than in the absence of myosin S-1 and permits actin-myosin S-1 MgATPase activity and in vitro filament movement. Shortened rαTmΔ(49–167) exhibits none of these properties. Because myosin S-1 slightly promotes rαTmΔ(49–167)-actin binding (Fig.5B), it can be concluded that myosin S-1 and rαTmΔ(49–167) can bind simultaneously to F-actin. The reduced thin filament sliding speed and fraction of smoothly moving filaments at intermediate concentrations of rαTmΔ(49–167) (Table I) suggests the presence of a drag force, perhaps from myosin S-1 attachment to a portion of the thin filament where tropomyosin is bound. Nevertheless, the tropomyosin internal deletion results in destabilization of the actin-myosin S-1-tropomyosin structure relative to what is found with normal tropomyosin. Furthermore, the thin filament assembly data in the absence of myosin indicate that this destabilization is specific for the myosin-induced conformation of the thin filament.Strongly bound myosin cross-bridges create an activated state of tropomyosin-containing thin filaments, with increased actomyosin ATPase rates (42Bremel R.D.

Murray J.M. Weber A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1972; 37: 267-275Crossref Google Scholar). Recent structural data suggest that regulated thin filament have at least three conformations but that only one of these conformations has tropomyosin in a position to allow cross-bridge cycling (11Vibert P. Craig R. Lehman W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 59Holmes K. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 2s-7sPubMed Google Scholar). These results and recent solution studies of actin-myosin S1 interactions in the absence (38McKillop D.F.A. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 693-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar) and the presence (60Butters C.A. Tobacman J.B. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; : 272Google Scholar) of ATP point toward the conclusion that there is essentially one active state for the thin filament. One way to test this concept would be to specifically destabilize the myosin-induced or potentiated state of the thin filament and then evaluate the effect on regulation under low myosin, high MgATP conditions. Unexpectedly, tropomyosin with regions 2, 3, and 4 deleted has properties that provide such a test of the mechanism of regulation. The tropomyosin internal deletion destabilizes the actin-myosin-tropomyosin complex and does not change the Ca2+-sensitive assembly of the actin-myosin-tropomyosin-troponin complex, yet the deletion is profoundly inhibitory to actin-myosin cycling. Unless the tropomyosin binds very strongly to actin-myosin S-1, it is inhibitory.Finally, a relevant prior report is the 1990 study by Hitchcock-DeGregori and Varnell, which showed that an internal deletion of tropomyosin did not prevent Ca2+-sensitive regulation of the myosin S-1 MgATPase rate (4Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Varnell T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 885-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This shortened tropomyosin had only region 2 deleted and was 6/7 the normal length, so there is no conflict between this earlier data and the present report. Rather, the combined results suggest the possibility that a specific tropomyosin sequence within region 3 and/or 4 is necessary for thin filament activation. It may be functionally important, for example, that rαTmΔ(49–167) is missing half of the tropomyosin region (residues 150–180) believed to interact with the globular region of troponin (31White S.P.

However, loss of a specific interaction with troponin would not explain the inhibitory properties of rαTmΔ(49–167) in the absence of troponin. An alternative possibility is that there are a critical number of internal tropomyosin regions needed to stabilize the myosin S-1 induced “on” state or otherwise to restore regulation. In other words, the crucial difference may be that a 6/7 length tropomyosin permits thin filament activation and a 4/7 length tropomyosin does not, with the specific regions relatively unimportant. Further experiments may be able to distinguish among these different explanations. Tropomyosin is an extended α-helical coiled-coil that spans seven actin monomers. Periodicity in tropomyosin's amino acid sequence and also in its modeled three-dimensional structure have led to the proposal that it contains 7 and possibly 14 quasiequivalent regions (1McLachlan A.D.

In the present study a mutant tropomyosin designated rαTmΔ(49–167) with three of the seven regions (regions 2, 3, and 4) deleted has been created. 119 amino acids are absent from this mutant, corresponding to approximately 3 × 39 ⅔ residues per region as defined by McLachlan and Stewart (1McLachlan A.D.

Recent structural data suggest that tropomyosin can be positioned in three different locations on the actin filament. These positions are dependent upon the presence or the absence of troponin, calcium, and myosin. Troponin in the absence of Ca2+ induces an “off” state in which only weak transitory myosin S-1 binding occurs (5Lehman W. Vibert P. Uman P. Craig R. J. Mol.

Science. 1993; 261: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). Tropomyosin in this position blocks actin sites necessary for strong myosin S-1 binding as modeled by Rayment et al. and others (6Rayment I. Holden H.M. Whittaker M. Yohn C.B. Lorenz M. Holmes K.C.

When either Ca2+ is added or troponin is removed, there is a 25 ° rotation of the tropomyosin from the off state, partially uncovering actin residues involved in myosin binding (7Lorenz M.

An additional 10 ° rotation of tropomyosin about the actin filament occurs when myosin S-1 is bound to the actin (7Lorenz M. Poole K.J.V. Popp D. Rosenbaum G. Holmes K.C. J. Mol.

The structural studies above suggest that tropomyosin-actin interactions are highly diverse. Accordingly, several conditions were examined to characterize the deletion tropomyosin of the present report. The deletion was found not to alter tropomyosin-actin binding under almost all conditions. However, the deletion had a major effect on this process in the presence of myosin S-1. Furthermore, rαTmΔ(49–167) was found to inhibit in vitro motility and thin filament-myosin S-1 MgATPase activity. The functional significance of these interrelated observations is discussed. DISCUSSIONTropomyosin has been shown by several investigators to have different affinities for actin depending upon the presence or the absence of myosin, troponin, and Ca2+ (reviewed in Ref.37Tobacman L.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 447-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The addition of troponin increases tropomyosin's affinity for actin (23Hill L.E. Mehegan J.P. Butters C.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16106-16113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), perhaps due to troponin-actin interactions (37Tobacman L.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 447-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), and causes it to shift position when Ca2+ is added (7Lorenz M. Poole K.J.V. Popp D. Rosenbaum G. Holmes K.C. J. Mol.

The fraction of this component (extent of inactivation) is increased by microfilament disruption induced by cytochalasins or by phosphorylation of the α subunit at Ser-446, which impairs the interaction of the channel with microfilaments. The relevant sites of interaction on the channel molecules have not been identified. Using a phosphorylation-deficient mutant of α, S446A, to ensure maximal basal interaction of the channel with the cytoskeleton, we show that one relevant site is the end of the C terminus of α. Truncation of the last six amino acids resulted in αβ channels with an extent of inactivation up to 2.5-fold larger and its further enhancement by cytochalasins being reduced 2-fold. The wild-type channels exhibited strong inactivation, which could not be markedly increased either by cytochalasins or by the C-terminal mutations, indicating that the interaction of the wild-type channels with microfilaments was minimal to begin with, presumably because of extensive basal phosphorylation. Since the C-terminal end of Kv1.1 was shown to participate in channel clustering via an interaction with members of the PSD-95 family of proteins, we propose that a similar interaction with an endogenous protein takes place, contributing to channel connection to the oocyte cytoskeleton.

In contrast with the well understood structural determinants within the core of voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channel proteins that underlie many functional properties (e.g. voltage-sensing regions, pore region; Refs. 1Jan L.Y.

Rev. 1992; : S79-S88Google Scholar), much less is known about the role of extrinsic factors in determining Kv channel function. One such factor is the interaction of ion channels with the cytoskeleton, which could affect structural and functional organization of neuronal elements. Recently, a family of membrane-associated putative guanylate kinases were shown to bind directly to K+ channels of the Shaker (Kv1) family and to induce their clustering in COS7 cells (6Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothchild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar, 7Kim E. Sheng M. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This family includes PSD-95, an abundant synaptic protein found both pre- and postsynaptically, and SAP97, a protein found in axons of neurons as well as in non-neuronal cells (for reviews, see Refs. 8Sheng M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 575-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar and 9Gomperts S.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 659-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). These data together with the demonstration of colocalization of the channels with PSD-95 (6Kim E.

Apart from a probable role in clustering, it is not known whether the association with PSD-95 has a functional role of modulating the biophysical characteristics of the channel. For several years now our interest has been the modulation by direct phosphorylation of the voltage-gated K+ channel Kv1.1 (originally cloned from rodent brain cDNA libraries; Refs. 11Tempel B.L.

Chem. 1995; 270: 14611-14618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Recently it became clear that part of the diversity of Kv channels may arise from association of pore-forming Kv1 subunits with auxiliary Kvβ subunits (for review, see Ref. 17Isom L.L. De Jongh K.S. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1183-1194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) and that the functional consequence of the association between Kv1.1 (α) and rat brain Kvβ1.1 (β) is the appearance of rapid inactivation of the current (18Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar, 19Morales M.J. Castellino R.C. Crews A.L. Rasmusson R.L.

( Lond .). 1996; 493: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Therefore, we studied also the Kv1.1/Kvβ1.1 (αβ) channel and its modulation by direct phosphorylation (21Levin G. Chikvashvilli D. Singer-Lahat D. Peretz T. Thornhill W.B. Lotan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29321-29328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that the inactivation of the αβ current is not complete, even under conditions where the α polypeptide is saturated with the β polypeptide, and has an inherent sustained component, indistinguishable from a pure α current. The extent of the inactivation (the fraction of the inactivating component) is increased either by phosphorylation of the α subunits at Ser-446 or by depolymerization of the microfilaments by cytochalasins; the latter effect occludes the former. To account for our findings we proposed a simple model that assumes the existence of two modes of the αβ channels, in one mode inactivation is conferred on the channels by the β, in the other mode no inactivation is observed despite the fact that α is physically associated with β. Interaction of the channels with microfilaments shifts the equilibrium between the two modes toward the noninactivating mode, and phosphorylation (which impairs the interaction of the channels with microfilaments by an unknown mechanism) shifts the equilibrium toward the inactivating mode. The α protein has at its very C terminus a TDV sequence (amino acids 493–495), which presumably mediates the coclustering of Kv1.1 channels with PSD-95 and SAP97 in COS7 cells (7Kim E. Sheng M. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Thus, we assumed that this site might mediate the interaction of the αβ channels with the oocyte microfilaments; phosphorylation of Ser-446, which is also in the cytoplasmic C terminus of the α protein, seemed an attractive mechanism to modulate this interaction. Supportive of such a notion is the recent demonstration that the binding of the inwardly rectifying K+ channel Kir 2.3 to PSD-95 is regulated by phosphorylation of the channel; however, in this case the phosphorylation occurs at the binding site itself (22Cohen N.A. Brenman J.E. Snyder S.H. Bredt D.S. Neuron. 1996; 17: 759-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In this study we set out to test the site of interaction with the cytoskeleton by studying the effect of truncation of the last C-terminal amino acids of the α protein on the extent of inactivation of the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated αβ channels and their susceptibility to microfilament depolymerization. The results are in agreement with a scenario where the very C terminus of the α subunits in αβ channels interacts with the microfilaments via a PSD-like protein; the interaction is phosphorylation-dependent and affects the extent of channel inactivation. Chemicals were from Sigma (Rishon Le-Zion, Israel) unless stated otherwise. Vanadate (sodium orthovanadate) and okadaic acid were from Alomone Laboratories (Jerusalem). [35S]Methionine/cysteine mix and [γ-32P]ATP were from Amersham Corp. Kv1.1 antiserum was generated against a 23-amino acid peptide that corresponds to the N terminus of RCK1 (SGENADEASAAPGHPQDGSYPRQ), as described (15Ivanina T. Perets T. Thornhill W.B. Levin G.

Oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis was performed using a mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions, using double-stranded DNA as templates and oligonucleotide primers (synthesized by General Biotechnology Inc., Rehovot, Israel) encoding the desired mutations.

Frogs (Xenopus laevis) were maintained and dissected, and their oocytes were prepared as described (23Dascal N. Lotan I. Methods Mol. Biol. 1992; 13: 205-225Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with 2–5 ng/μl Kv1.1 and 200–500 ng/μl Kvβ1.1 mRNA for two electrode voltage clamp studies and 100–200 ng/μl Kv1.1 and 3–7 μg/μl Kvβ1.1 mRNAs for macropatch and biochemical studies. The concentrations of the injected mutant RCK1 mRNAs deviated slightly from the above concentrations as they were adjusted to give similar current amplitudes with Kvβ1.1. Injected oocytes were incubated at 22 °C for 1–3 days in ND96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mmHepes, pH 7.5) supplemented with 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin (NDE solution) and then assayed either electrophysiologically or biochemically. Cytochalasins were added 4–6 h before the electrophysiological assay. Two electrode voltage clamp recordings were performed as described (16Levin G. Keren T. Peretz T. Chikvashvili D. Thornhill W.B.

To avoid possible errors introduced by series resistance, only current amplitudes up to 4 μA were recorded, and in a given experiment the amplitudes of WT and mutant currents were similar. Oocytes were placed in a 1-ml bath continuously perfused with ND96 solution. Currents were elicited by stepping the membrane potential from a holding potential of −80 mV to +50 mV for 70 ms. Net current was estimated by subtraction of the scaled leak current elicited by a voltage step to −90 mV. This was done essentially as described (16Levin G. Keren T. Peretz T. Chikvashvili D.

Following injection, six to eight oocytes were incubated at 22 °C for 4 h in NDE solution, then for 3 days in NDE containing 0.2 mCi/ml [35S]Met/Cys, and then were homogenized in 150–300 μl of medium consisting of 20 mm Tris, pH = 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 100 mmNaCl, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmiodoacetamide, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 mm1,10-phenanthroline supplemented with protein phosphatase inhibitors: 50 nm okadaic acid, 0.5 mm vanadate, and 50 mm KF. Debris was removed by centrifugation at 1000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. After addition of Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 4%, followed by centrifugation for 15 min at 4 °C, antiserum was added to the supernatant for 16 h at 4 °C. The antibody-antigen complex was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose and then pelleted by centrifugation for 1 min at 8000 × g. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with immunowash buffer (150 mm NaCl, 6 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH = 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100); the final wash contained no Triton X-100. Gels were dried and placed in a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) cassette for about 1 day. Using the software ImageQuant, a digitized scan was derived, and relative intensities of protein bands were estimated quantitatively by the software ImageQuant as described (16Levin G. Keren T.

Data are presented as means ± S.E.; N denotes number of frogs assayed, n denotes the number of oocytes assayed. The Student's t test was used to calculate the statistical significance of differences between two populations. The mRNAs of Kv1.1 (α) and Kvβ1.1 (β) were coinjected at a β-to-α mRNA ratio of 100, which ensures saturation of α polypeptides with β. As described before (21Levin G. Chikvashvilli D.

The apparent extent of inactivation (inactivating fraction) was defined as Ii/Ip (Ip = peak current). Previously, we showed that the extent of inactivation of the αS446Aβ channel (in which Ser-446 of the α subunit was substituted with alanine; S446A) is significantly smaller (by about 70%) than that of the WT (αWTβ) channel and related it to the fact that the mutant, unlike the wild-type, channel is not phosphorylated in its basal state in the oocyte (21Levin G.

In this study the average extent of inactivation of αWTβ currents was 0.57 ± 0.02 (mean ± S.E.; N = 3 oocyte batches, n = 41 oocytes) and that of αS446Aβ currents was 0.12 ± 0.025 (N = 6 oocyte batches, n = 78 oocytes). Truncation of the very end of the C terminus of S446A α polypeptide by deletion of the last six amino acids (substituting Lys-490 with stop codon: K490s.c), or substitution of Thr-493 with Ala (T493A), increased by 155 and 65% the extent of inactivation of the respective αS446Aβ channels (see Fig. 1,A and B, open bars). The same mutations in the WT α polypeptide did not increase the extent of inactivation of the corresponding αβ channels (Fig. 2, A andB, open bars). Previously, we showed that treatment of oocytes with 40 μm of the microfilament-disrupting agent dihydrocytochalasin B (DHCB) increases the extent of inactivation, the effect being severalfold larger in the αS446Aβ than in the αWTβ channels. If, as we believed, the above increases in the extent of inactivation of the αS446Aβ channels in which the C terminus of the α subunit was truncated are due to some impairment of the interaction of the channels with the cytoskeleton, one would expect that these effects will be occluded by the DHCB treatment. Indeed, in oocytes of the same frogs the inactivations of αS446Aβ and each one of its C-terminal mutants were practically the same after DHCB treatment (Fig. 1 B, hatched bars). Thus, whereas the effect of DHCB was about 400% on αS446Aβ, it was more than 2-fold smaller (about 185%) on either one of the mutants. The effects of DHCB on the αWTβ channels (about 10%) and on its C-terminal mutations were much smaller (Fig. 2 B, hatched bars).Figure 2The effect of mutations in the very C terminus of the α subunit of αWTβ channel on the extent of inactivation, both basal and after DHCB treatment.

This possibility was excluded in the concomitant biochemical analysis. SDS-PAGE analysis of [35S]Met/Cys-labeled α and β polypeptides coprecipitated by anti-α antibody showed that the β-binding capacity of all the αS446A polypeptide species is similar, namely, the same amount of β was coprecipitated per equal amounts of any of the α polypeptides (Fig. 3). This result is in accord with our previous data showing that under the conditions of such an experiment the β-to-α ratio of the coprecipitated polypeptides was the maximal possible, when >90% of α was saturated with β (21Levin G.

The same SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 3) shows that, as demonstrated before (16Levin G. Keren T. Peretz T. Chikvashvili D. Thornhill W.B. Lotan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14611-14618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the S446A α polypeptides migrate as a 54-kDa polypeptide, which is the nonphosphorylated form, whereas the WT α polypeptide migrates as a doublet of 54- and 57-kDa polypeptides, the latter being the phosphorylated form. It should be noted that the WT α polypeptide was basally phosphorylated to a large extent, as is evident from the relative intensities of the 57- and 54-kDa bands. Our preceding study (21Levin G. Chikvashvilli D. Singer-Lahat D. Peretz T. Thornhill W.B. Lotan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29321-29328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the inactivation of the Kv1.1/Kvβ1.1 (αβ) channel is hampered by interaction of the channel with microfilaments and that this interaction can be disrupted to a significant extent by phosphorylation of a single C-terminal residue (Ser-446) of the α subunit. Thus, in the present study, the αS446Aβ channel having the S446A α subunit, which, unlike the WT, is not basally phosphorylated in the oocyte, had a substantially weaker inactivation (∼10% of total current) than the αWTβ channel (∼60%). Consequently, αS446Aβ displayed a much stronger increase (by ∼300%) in inactivation than αWTβ (by ∼10%) upon treatment with DHCB, which disrupts the microfilaments (21Levin G. Chikvashvilli D. Singer-Lahat D. Peretz T. Thornhill W.B. Lotan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29321-29328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Therefore, to look for the interaction between the αβ channel and the cytoskeleton, rather than using the wild-type channel, we utilized the αS446Aβ mutant in which the channel-cytoskeleton interaction is functionally intact and which responds to any reduction in the strength of this interaction by a marked change in inactivation kinetics. The interaction of the αβ channel with microfilaments could occur at sites on both the α and the β polypeptides. A highly probable candidate was the consensus TDV sequence at the end of the C terminus, recognized by the PDZ domain of the Dlg/PSD-95 family of proteins (for reviews, see Refs. 8Sheng M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 575-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar and 24Saras J. Heldin C.-H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 455-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), thus providing cytoskeletal interaction (9Gomperts S.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 659-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and inducing clustering of Kv1.1 channels in COS7 cells (7Kim E. Sheng M. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we studied the effects of truncation of the very C terminus of α subunits, and of a point mutation in the TDV sequence, on the extent of inactivation, both basal and following DHCB treatment, of the αS446Aβ channels. One would expect that if the interaction between the channel and the cytoskeleton was disrupted by the mutations, the extent of inactivation would increase and the enhancement of inactivation by DHCB would be weakened. Indeed, the two different C-terminal mutations in the S446A α subunit (a deletion of the last six amino acids and a replacement of the crucial Thr-493 with alanine) significantly increased the basal extent of inactivation of αS446Aβ and reduced the magnitude of the inactivation enhancement by DHCB. As expected, under the conditions of these experiments, in which the αWTβ channels were essentially detached from the cytoskeleton in their basal state in the oocyte (as indicated by the large basal inactivation and small DHCB effect), the same C-terminal mutations of the WT α subunit did not increase the inactivation of the αWTβ channels. This is also in accord with the large extent of basal phosphorylation in the oocytes used in these experiments (Fig. 3). In conclusion, the data presented in this report corroborate the hypothesis that the very C terminus of α interacts with the microfilaments. The interaction of the very C terminus of the α subunit with the oocyte's cytoskeleton is via an endogenous protein in the oocyte, possibly resembling protein members of the dlg/PSD-95 family. However, truncation of all last six amino acids in the C-terminal tail was more effective than substitution of Thr-493 in the TDV sequence with alanine, a substitution that was shown to abolish the interaction of a related α protein, Kv1.4, with PSD-95 (6Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothchild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems that the TDV motif in Kv1.1 is not the only determinant of α-subunit binding to the postulated endogenous protein. In view of the demonstration that the interaction of Kv1.1 with PSD-95 was much weaker than that of Kv1.4 in COS7 cells, and that Kv1.1 is missing a glutamate that precedes the TDV sequence in Kv1.4 and was shown to be critical for the Kv1.4 interaction with PSD-95 (7Kim E. Sheng M. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), it seems plausible that Kv1.1 interactsin vivo with a protein having a somewhat different recognition sequence, yet to be identified. An alternative explanation to the stronger interaction of Kv1.4 with PSD-95 could be that the basal phosphorylation of this channel is weaker than that of Kv1.1 in the cells tested. It should be pointed out that the DHCB effect occluded the effects caused by truncations of the C terminus of α in αS446Aβ channels, much as it occluded (21Levin G. Chikvashvilli D. Singer-Lahat D. Peretz T. Thornhill W.B. Lotan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29321-29328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) the effect of Ser-446 phosphorylation of α in αWTβ channels. This suggests that disruption of microfilaments by DHCB causes maximal enhancement of inactivation extent of the αβ channel experimentally achievable, probably by a massive disruption of interactions between the channels and the microfilaments. However, the fact that the effect of DHCB was still prominent, though significantly reduced, in the C terminus-truncated mutants suggests that there are additional sites of interaction with the microfilaments on the αβ channel molecules that modulate the inactivation. The present study correlates the extent of inactivation of the Kv1.1/Kvβ1.1 channel with its interactions with PSD-95-like proteins. This is the first report that assigns a modulatory role to such interactions. Such a functional interaction might be physiologically relevant at synaptic sites in different brain areas where PSD-95 family members were shown to be concentrated and colocalized with Shaker-type K+ channels including Kv1.1 (6Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothchild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). We thank Dr. N. Dascal for helpful discussions."

To further examine the function of the bHLHZip protein, USF, we screened for cellular proteins which could directly interact with USF using the yeast two-hybrid system. A bZip protein, Fra1, was found to efficiently interact with USF. USF specifically interacts with Fra1 but not with other closely related family members, c-Fos, Fra2, FosB, or with c-Jun. Both the bHLHZip and the N-terminal regions of Fra1 are required for efficient interaction with USF. In vivo association between USF and Fra1 has been demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. Expression of exogenous USF led to a decrease in AP1-dependent transcription in F9 cells. Co-expression of exogenous Fra1 restored the AP1 activity in a dose-dependent manner. These data show that USF and Fra1 physically and functionally interact demonstrating that cross-talk occurs between factors of distantly related transcription families."

Cells were harvested after exposure to 0.05% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA in Hanks' buffered salt solution (Biofluids). For permeabilizing sensitized adherent cells, 12 well plates (Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) were seeded with 6 × 105 cells in the presence of 0.6 μg/ml IgE. After overnight culture, the cell monolayers were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (without Mg2+ or Ca2+) and then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 300 units/ml streptolysin O (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, each time allowing the wash buffer to incubate for at least 1 min before removal. The efficiency of permeabilization was assessed by following the depletion of cytosolic proteins as described under “Results.” Cells were activated by adding 1 μg/ml DNP25-BSA in assay buffer (25 mm K+PIPES, pH 7.2, 119 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5.6 mm glucose, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm ATP) at 37 °C. Cells in suspension were sensitized with IgE, washed, and permeabilized at 1.25 × 107 cells/ml in assay buffer containing 1 unit/ml streptolysin O (Murex). The mixture was incubated for 3 min at 37 °C with gentle agitation. This protocol resulted in the permeabilization of >99% of the cells, as assessed by trypan blue uptake. Such permeabilized cells (107 cells/ml) were then stimulated for 2 min at 37 °C with 1 μg/ml DNP25-BSA in assay buffer. Cells were solubilized in lysis buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mmEDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mmNa4P2O7, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm iodoacetate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation (16,000 × g for 10 min). The supernatants were first precleared with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and selected proteins were reacted with appropriate antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C. The solutions were then incubated with 60 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with 500 μl of lysis buffer and extracted with hot sample buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 10% glycerol) by boiling for 5 min. The eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on precast gels (Novex). Receptors aggregated with a multivalent antigen solubilize more slowly than monomeric receptors and for this reason may be subject to dephosphorylation during solubilization due to slow delivery of PTP inhibitors. Therefore, except where otherwise noted, the monovalent hapten DNP-ε-NH2 caproate was included in the solubilization buffer to disaggregate the receptors. When adherent cells were solubilized by this protocol, FcεRI but not other cellular proteins showed enhanced levels of tyrosine phosphorylation. With cells in suspension, where the solutions can be votexed to promote the action of detergent (13Pribluda V.S. Pribluda C. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11246-11250Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), addition of hapten did not further enhance the recovery of phosphotyrosine. Analysis of protein tyrosine phosphorylation by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was performed as described previously (15Kent U.M. Mao S.-Y. Wofsy C. Goldstein B. Ross S. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3087-3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Western blotting by various antibodies was carried out using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence for detection (Amersham Corp.). Autophotographs were quantitatively analyzed by computerized densitometry (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). In separate experiments, we checked that under the conditions we used here, the chemiluminescence generated by the two critical antibodies, anti-β and anti-phosphotyrosine, was linearly proportional to the amount of subunit and phosphotyrosine in the precipitate (data not shown). Phosphorylated FcεRI to be used as substrate for anin vitro PTP assay was prepared from intact cells in suspension. Stimulated cells were solubilized, and FcεRI was immunoprecipitated. The immunoprecipitates were first washed with lysis buffer and then further with buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, and 5 mm EDTA. The amount of phosphotyrosine on the receptor subunits used in thein vitro PTP assay can be estimated as follows. On average, about 10% of the receptors that become phosphorylated in our routine stimulations can be precipitated by anti-phosphotyrosine (data not shown). Since we routinely use 8.3 × 105 cells that have approximately 3 × 105 receptors per cell, the minimum number of phosphotyrosines would be 0.04 pmol. The phosphorylation of the β- and γ-subunits has recently been assessed directly, and the amount of phosphotyrosine associated with the ITAMs of β:γ2 were found to be in the ratio of ≈1:3.3 (24Pribluda V.S. Pribluda C. Metzger H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11185-11192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Then, if all phosphorylated receptors are always fully phosphorylated, the maximal number of phosphotyrosines would be 4.3 × 0.04, or 0.17 pmol. The total cell lysate for in vitro PTP assay was prepared by solubilizing resting cells (4.2 × 106 cells/ml) in 0.05% Triton X-100, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mmglutathione, and 10 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation (16,000 × g for 10 min). Two hundred μl of the supernatant was added to the washed immunoprecipitates of FcεRI and incubated at 30 °C. The reaction was quenched by 1 mmNa3VO4 at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed once with buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mmNa3VO4, extracted with hot sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The procedures used to fractionate cells into total membranes and cytosol have been described (12Pribluda V.S. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11446-11450Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). When compared at equal cell equivalents, >96% of the β-subunit of FcεRI was recovered in the membrane pellet (n = 6), whereas approximately 95% of the PTPs SHP-1 and SHP-2 were in the cytosolic fraction (n = 3). Before the PTP assay, the fractions were adjusted to have the same buffer composition as in the lysate. During the in vitro PTP assay, some dissociation of the β- and γ-subunits from the IgE-binding α-subunit was observed. Therefore, to normalize the level of phosphorylation/receptor we corrected for the amount of β. After probing with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, the nitrocellulose membranes were stripped of bound antibody by incubation with a buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, and 100 mm2-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 50 °C. The membranes were then washed and reprobed with anti-β antibody. The preparation of substrate (corresponding to residues 53–65 in the COOH-terminal region of hirudin (22Donella-Deana A. Stone S.R. Pinna L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 501-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar)) for PTP assay and detection of residual phosphotyrosine after the assay were performed according to the manufacturer's instruction. Fifty μl of the cell lysate, prepared as above, was added to 4.8 pmol of peptide and incubated at 30 °C. Our objective was to characterize the phosphatases that with the kinase(s) regulate the degree to which the tyrosines on the β- and γ-subunits of FcεRI are phosphorylated. We chose to examine first the phosphatase activity in total cell lysate that could dephosphorylate receptors that had been aggregated. RBL-2H3 cells sensitized with DNP-specific IgE were reacted with antigen, and the FcεRI was extracted with detergent. The receptors were precipitated by reacting the receptor-bound IgE with anti-IgE and protein A, and the precipitates were washed and subjected to PTP assays. A detergent extract of resting RBL cells was used as the source of total PTP, and aliquots were incubated with the immunoprecipitates at 30 °C. At the end of the assay, the precipitates were extracted with SDS, and the subunits were resolved electrophoretically on polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and the latter were analyzed for phosphotyrosine by Western blotting (Fig. 1 A, anti-PY blot). The conditions of the assay cause some of the β- and γ-subunits of FcεRI to dissociate in unison from the IgE-bound α-subunit in the immune complex (25Kinet J.-P. Alcaraz G. Leonard A. Wank S. Metzger H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4117-4124Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, Western blotting with anti-β was used to quantitate the amount of β (and γ) remaining in order to normalize the phosphorylation data to a constant number of subunits (Fig. 1 B,anti-β blot). After such correction, the data show no evidence for dephosphorylation of either the β- or γ-subunits of the receptor in the presence of assay buffer only (Fig.1 C, open circles). Therefore, the immunoprecipitates of the receptor prepared in our experiments had no detectable associated PTP activity (cf. Ref. 26Swieter M. Berenstein E.H. Siraganian R.P. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5330-5336PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of total lysate, both subunits were rapidly and completely dephosphorylated during the in vitro PTP assay (Fig. 1, A and C). By varying the dose of lysate and the time of incubation, we developed conditions such that the dephosphorylation of the β- and γ-subunits over a fixed time period was proportional to the amount of cell lysate added (Fig.2). These data showed that the lysate from 2.1 × 105 RBL cells hydrolyzed approximately 50% of the phosphotyrosine on the β- and γ-subunits of the receptors derived from 8.3 × 105 cell eq/min. Thus, each cell equivalent of lysate had adequate activity in the in vitro assay to dephosphorylate a cell equivalent of phosphorylated FcεRI in approximately 30 s. The whole cell lysate may well contain a variety of phosphatases with varying activities against the phosphorylated subunits of the receptor. Therefore, to assure that the assay was at least in principle capable of providing quantitative estimates of phosphatase activity in such a potentially complex system, we utilized the recombinant PTP, YOP34, and compared the results with it to those obtained with the RBL lysate against a phosphorylated peptide (22Donella-Deana A. Stone S.R. Pinna L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 501-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The complex mixture and the recombinant phosphatase gave similarly proportional responses in a dose-response assay (data not shown). We were interested in determining the intracellular distribution of the PTP(s) that could dephosphorylate the receptor subunits. Unactivated RBL cells were sonicated, and a cell-free supernatant was prepared by centrifugation at low speed. This supernatant was re-centrifuged at higher speed to sediment the membranes. The latter were either washed or resuspended by sonication in lysis buffer. The various fractions derived from equivalent numbers of cells as well as unfractionated lysate were then assayed for PTP activity against immunoprecipitates of phosphorylated receptor or a tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide (Table I). Relative amounts of PTP against the receptor subunits present in each preparation were then calculated from the extent of dephosphorylation. These data showed that the PTP activity against the β- and γ-subunits was about equally distributed between cytosol and membrane fractions. However, when sedimented and resuspended in buffer twice, the washed membrane preparations retained only half of their initial PTP activity. When such preparations were assayed against the phosphorylated peptide, a somewhat greater fraction of the total PTP activity was found in the cytosolic fraction.Table IDistribution of phosphatase activity in subcellular fractions of RBL-2H3 cellsSubstrate1-aThe phosphorylated receptors were prepared from 8.3 × 105 cell eq as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The phosphorylated peptide was 4.8 pmol/sample.Fraction1-bThe subcellular fractions were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In the assay using receptors, they were reacted for 4 min with 2.1 × 105 cell eq; in the assay using peptide, they were reacted for 2 min with 5.2 × 104cell eq.% DephosphorylationRelative PTP1-dThe relative amounts of phosphatases were calculated by the approximation that the extent of dephosphorylation was proportional to the log of cell equivalents (and thus the amount of PTP).Absolute1-cThe data represent the averages from two separate experiments; a total of three specimens were assayed against receptors whereas four were assayed against the phosphopeptide.

Open table in a new tab We next determined whether the cytosolic PTP dephosphorylating FcεRI was one of two PTPs that have been implicated in signal transduction through cell surface receptors (27Marengère L.E.M.

Roy G. Chan A.C. Thomas M.L. Science. 1996; 272: 1173-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). These are the SH2 domain-containing cytosolic enzymes, SHP-1 and SHP-2. By immunoblotting, both SHP-1 and SHP-2 were present in RBL cell lysate (data not shown; see Ref. 29Mao S.-Y. Yamashita T. Metzger H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1968-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). RBL lysate from resting cells was first precipitated with anti-SHP-1 or anti-SHP-2, and the supernatant was then allowed to dephosphorylate FcεRI in vitro. The antibodies removed about 99% of the respective PTP, as assessed by Western blotting (data not shown). Nevertheless, the precleared supernatants dephosphorylated both β- and γ-subunits as rapidly as the control sample (data not shown), indicating that neither SHP-1 nor SHP-2 was significantly involved in dephosphorylation of FcεRIin vitro. The results of the fractionation showed that about equal amounts of PTP activity against the receptor subunits were present in the cytosol and the membranes. An alternative method was used to probe the same question, i.e. the localization of the PTP used by the cell to regulate the phosphorylation of receptor tyrosines. Sensitized adherent RBL cells permeabilized with streptolysin O were briefly stimulated with antigen, and the receptors were then disaggregated by the addition of hapten. The cells were then solubilized, and immunoprecipitates of the receptor were analyzed for residual phosphotyrosines. Several proteins were examined to assess the loss of cytosolic components from the permeabilized cells. The average loss of lactic dehydrogenase was 88%; the corresponding losses for the two cytosolic phosphatases, SHP-1 and SHP-2, were 71 and 66%, respectively. On the other hand, the membrane-bound Lyn kinase was fully retained. As with the intact cells, aggregating the receptors on IgE-sensitized permeabilized cells with antigen led to a dramatic increase in phosphotyrosine, whereas in the absence of antigen there was no signal above background (data not shown). After addition of hapten, the rates of dephosphorylation for the intact and permeabilized cells were indistinguishable (Fig. 3). It was of interest to compare the dephosphorylation of aggregated versus disaggregated receptors in the in vitro PTP assay. Cells were activated as before, and their receptors were solubilized (with lysis buffer that did not contain hapten (see “Experimental Procedures”)). One aliquot was immunoprecipitated directly with anti-IgE; another was first reacted with hapten to disaggregate the receptors before immunoprecipitation. Fig. 4 shows that the rates of dephosphorylation of the receptor subunits from aggregated and disaggregated receptors were equivalent. In this experiment it is of course important to verify that the aggregated receptors remained aggregated during the course of the dephosphorylation assay. Because the state of phosphorylation of only those subunits that remained associated with the immunoprecipitates was measured, effective disaggregation could only have occurred if there had been substantial dissociation of the β- and γ-subunits during the course of the assay. Use of anti-β blots verified that at the earliest points (inset) >70% of the β-subunit remained with both the aggregated and hapten-disaggregated receptors. It was of interest to compare the in vivo dephosphorylation of the receptor with other cellular proteins after the addition of hapten to antigen-activated cells. We first examined the kinetics of phosphorylation for various cellular proteins. IgE-sensitized adherent RBL cells were stimulated with antigen, the cells were solubilized, and the whole cell lysate (as well as immunoprecipitates of the receptor) was assessed for phosphotyrosines. As shown in the top panels of Fig. 5, the phosphorylation of the β- and γ-subunits occurred at similar rates, reaching a maximum at 4–8 min after stimulation. These rates were about 4-fold slower than those obtained for cells in suspension (data not shown; see Refs. 12Pribluda V.S. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11446-11450Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar and 26Swieter M. Berenstein E.H. Siraganian R.P. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5330-5336PubMed Google Scholar); on the latter, using the same dose of antigen, maximum phosphorylation of the receptors was generally seen by about 1–2 min after the addition of antigen, and by 4 min it declined to about 40–75% of the maximum. The phosphorylation of at least some of the major phosphotyrosine-containing proteins appeared to reach a plateau somewhat earlier (Fig. 5, middle panels). We then investigated the kinet"

Internalization at the cell surface and targeting back to thetrans-Golgi network is dependent on a hexapeptide motif, SDYQRL, in the cytosolic tail of the protein. It was recently demonstrated that this motif specifically interacts with the μ2 subunit of the AP2 adaptor complex. We have studied the interaction between the entire cytosolic domain of TGN38 and μ2 using the yeast two hybrid system, in vitro binding of recombinant fusion proteins and IAsys optical biosensor technology. A specific interaction has been demonstrated in each of the systems we have employed. We have shown an absolute requirement for Tyr-333 of TGN38 in binding to μ2. In addition we found that mutation of Ser-331 to alanine reduces the affinity of the interaction. By measuring tryptophan fluorescence at equilibrium, we have also determined the dissociation constant for the interaction between the entire cytosolic tail of TGN38 and μ2 as 58 nm. In contrast to previously published work, our data suggest that not only Tyr-333 but also its context is important in determining the specificity of binding of TGN38 to μ2.

Efficient cell surface internalization of many proteins is mediated by their sequestration into endocytic vesicles. The hallmark feature of the process is the localization of endocytic proteins to clathrin-coated pits at the plasma membrane and their subsequent internalization in coated vesicles. Formation of the coated vesicle depends on recruitment of the vesicle coat to the plasma membrane. The coat of clathrin-coated vesicles involves binding of adaptor complexes onto the membrane and their subsequent binding of soluble clathrin. The adaptor complexes are also believed to be involved in the selective concentration of cargo proteins into coated pits. The high efficiency internalization of many different proteins at the cell surface has been shown to be mediated through targeting signals within the cytosolic domain. Many proteins including the transferrin receptor, mannose-6-phosphate receptor, and TGN38 have tyrosine-based internalization motifs conforming to the consensus, YXX∅, where ∅ represents a hydrophobic amino acid within their cytosolic domains (1Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar).

This sequence has been shown to be responsible for the high efficiency internalization of the protein at the cell surface and its subsequent targeting back to the trans-Golgi network (3Bos K.

Various roles have been proposed for TGN38 (7Banting G. Ponnambalam S. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1355: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), but its precise function remains to be elucidated. trans-Golgi network thioredoxin A glutathioneS-transferase polymerase chain reaction 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-D-galactopyranoside The best characterized of the adaptor complexes are AP1 and AP2, which bind to TGN membranes and the plasma membrane, respectively (8Pearse B.

Both are composed of two large (>100 kDa) adaptin subunits (β′ and γ for AP1 and β and α for AP2), a medium chain (μ) subunit, and a small (ς) chain subunit. The β subunits of both AP1 and AP2 complexes have been shown to bind to clathrin (10Ahle S. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20089-20093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5237-5244Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Several proteins are known to bind directly to the AP2 adaptor complex. For example, epidermal growth factor receptors can be co-immunoprecipitated with AP2 complexes in stoichiometric amounts (12Sorkin A. Carpenter G. Science. 1993; 261: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 13Sorkin A. McKinsey T. Shih W. Kirchhausen T. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 619-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Purified adaptor complexes have also been shown to bind synthetic peptides corresponding to regions within the cytosolic domains of the mannose-6-phosphate receptor, low density lipoprotein receptor, and lysosomal acid phosphatase, all of which have tyrosine-based sorting signals in their cytosolic domains (14Pearse B.M.F.

It was recently shown that the tyrosine-based internalization signal of TGN38, SDYQRL (Fig.1), interacts with the medium chain subunit (μ2) of the plasma membrane adaptor complex, AP2 (17Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.-C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1995; 269: 1872-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar) which suggests a role for the μ subunits in mediating interaction with, at least some, tyrosine-based targeting signals. The tyrosine motif of Lamp-1 (lysosomal associated membrane protein-1, GYQTI) has also recently been shown to bind to both AP1 and AP2 in vitro (18Honing S. Griffith J. Geuze H.J. Hunziker W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5230-5239Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The interaction between TGN38 and the μ2 subunit was initially detected by screening a yeast two hybrid library with a triplet repeat of the hexapeptide motif SDYQRL (17Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.-C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1995; 269: 1872-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). The system was also used to show that the triplet repeat (SDYQRL)3 could interact with the μ1 subunit of AP1, the TGN adaptor complex. A single copy of the repeat sequence as well as the complete cytosolic domain of TGN38 were also shown to interact with μ2. The specificity of interaction was confirmed from binding assays using in vitro translated μ2 and a GST-(SDYQRL)3 fusion protein. The data obtained from these experiments showed an absolute requirement for the tyrosine residue of the motif, in agreement with previously published data (3Bos K. Wraight C. Stanley K.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2219-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 4Humphrey J.S. Peters P.J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. J.

Binding could also be competed using a synthetic peptide corresponding to the same sequence. We decided to examine the interaction between the complete cytosolic tail of TGN38 and μ2 in more detail. Apart from demonstrating an interaction between the two proteins in the two hybrid system, Ohnoet al. (17Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.-C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1995; 269: 1872-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar) presented no further work using the entire TGN38 tail sequence. As well as confirming the importance of Tyr-333 of TGN38, we have examined the effect of mutating Ser-331 of the SDYQRL motif to alanine with regard to μ2 binding. This residue has previously been shown to be important for both internalization of TGN38 at the cell surface and targeting back to the TGN (5Wong S.H. Hong W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22853-22862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have used the two hybrid system, interaction of recombinant fusion proteins, and optical biosensor technology to study the interaction. In addition, the equilibrium dissociation constant for the interaction has been determined by fluorescence quenching. Our data support previous observations (17Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.-C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1995; 269: 1872-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar) with the exception that we show a clear role for the serine residue of the SDYQRL motif in determining the specificity of binding. This suggests that the context of the sequence and not only the presence of the tyrosine motif is important in determining molecular recognition by the adaptor complexes. All reagents were purchased from Sigma (Poole, UK) unless otherwise stated. All plasmid manipulations were carried out according to standard methodologies (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.3-1.105Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced into TGN38 by PCR using primers incorporating the mutated codons. Mutation S331A was initially incorporated into the full TGN38 coding sequence, which was then used as a PCR template to amplify the cytosolic domain. The mutation Y333A was incorporated into a construct lacking the four carboxyl-terminal residues of TGN38 that were added back during subsequent amplification of the cytosolic domain alone. Primer sequences were as follows: S331A, 5′-AAGCTTTAGGTTCAAACGTTGGTAGTCAGCGGCCTTTGG-3′; Y333A, 5′-CAAACGTTGGGCGTCAGCGGCCTTTGG-3′. Each primer was used in conjunction with a sense TGN38 primer incorporating anAsp718I site at the extreme 5′ end of the TGN38 coding region: 5′-GGTACCAGACTACAGGATGCAGTTCCTGG-3′. All oligonucleotides were synthesized within the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council funded Molecular Recognition Center of the University of Bristol. All sequences were amplified for subcloning by 10 cycles of PCR using 2 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim, Lewes, UK), 0.2 mm dNTPs, 1.5 mmMgCl2, and 5 pmol of each primer. PCR products were gel purified and subcloned via pGEM-T (Promega, Southampton, UK) to the target vector using standard methods (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.3-1.105Google Scholar). All sequences amplified by PCR were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. cDNAs encoding rat μ1 and μ2 were kindly provided by Dr. M. S. Robinson (University of Cambridge, UK). The full coding sequence of each was amplified by PCR and subcloned, in frame, into (i) the two hybrid activation domain vector, pVP16 (20Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1658) Google Scholar), creating pVP16-μ1 and pVP16-μ2, respectively, and (ii) the plasmid-based prokaryotic expression vector pET32a (Novagen, Abingdon, UK) for bacterial expression. Amino-terminally truncated μ2 (corresponding to amino acids 121–435 of μ2, generating μ2ΔN) was also made and subcloned into pET32a. Wild-type and mutant versions of the cytosolic tail of TGN38 were amplified by PCR and subcloned into (i) pGEX4T (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., St. Albans, UK) for expression as GST fusion proteins, (ii) pET32a (Novagen), for expression as thioredoxin fusion proteins, and (iii) the two hybrid DNA binding domain vector, pBTM116 (20Vojtek A.B.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain L40 (MATa his3D200 trp1–901 leu2–3, 112 ade2 LYS2::(lexAop)4-HIS3 URA3::(lexAop)8-lacZ gal4 gal80 (20Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1658) Google Scholar)) was co-transformed with plasmids to express TGN38 cytosolic tail variants as LexA fusions and μ1 or μ2 as VP16 fusions, according to previously published methods (21Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2883) Google Scholar). Cells were also transformed with pVP16-μ1/μ2 and pLexA-Lamin as a negative control for interaction. Cells were then washed in TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA) and plated onto selective medium (lacking Trp and Leu). After 3–4 days, colonies were streaked onto selective medium lacking Trp, Leu, Lys, and Ura and grown at 30 °C for a further 3 days. Colonies were then assayed for β-galactosidase activity. Colonies were lifted onto a Whatman 1 filter and frozen by submerging in liquid nitrogen for 10 s. The filter was then thawed at room temperature and layered over another filter, presoaked in Z buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, pH 7.0) containing 0.4 mg·ml−1 X-gal. Filters were then incubated overnight at 30 °C in humidified Petri dishes. TGN38 cytosolic domains were expressed as GST fusion proteins inEscherichia coli strain BL21DE3 and purified on glutathione-agarose according to recommended protocols (Pharmacia). Briefly, cultures were inoculated with 1% (v/v) of saturated overnight culture, grown to A600 = 0.4 and induced for 1 h with 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. Following sonication in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 μg·ml−1 leupeptin, 2 μg·ml−1 antipain, 10 μg·ml−1benzamidine, 10 units·ml−1 aprotinin, 1 μg·ml−1 chymostatin, 1 μg·ml−1pepstatin A), purification was achieved using glutathione-agarose with washes in phosphate-buffered saline. Thioredoxin fusions were expressed in an identical manner and purified using Talon™ purification resin (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All proteins were dialyzed into 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and stored at −70 °C. Full-length μ2 and μ2ΔN were also expressed in BL21DE3 as follows. Cultures were inoculated with 10% (v/v) overnight culture, grown for a further 2 h at 37 °C with shaking, and induced for 30 min with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. Cells were pelleted and lysed by sonication; the insoluble pellet was washed twice in 100 mm sodium phosphate containing 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 before solubilization in 50 mm sodium phosphate containing 8 m urea and 10 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h at room temperature. Proteins were refolded by stepwise dialysis into lower concentrations of urea at 4 °C. Buffers for dialysis down to 0.5 m urea contained 2 mm dithiothreitol; for lower urea concentrations (less than 0.5 m), dithiothreitol was omitted and 10% glycerol was included. Finally, μ2ΔN and μ2 proteins were dialyzed into 50 mm sodium phosphate containing 10% glycerol and stored at −70 °C. GST-TGN38 tail fusions (30 μg each) and Trx-μ2ΔN (10 μg) were incubated together for 1 h at room temperature in a total volume of 0.2 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 10% glycerol and supplemented with protease inhibitors (5 μg·ml−1 leupeptin, 10 μg·ml−1antipain, 50 μg·ml−1 benzamidine, 50 units·ml−1 aprotinin, 5 μg·ml−1chymostatin, 5 μg·ml−1 pepstatin A). Complexes were then immunoprecipitated for 1 h with a polyclonal antibody that specifically recognizes thioredoxin that had been preadsorbed to protein G-Sepharose (20 μl bed volume). Complexes were washed twice in binding buffer and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 12% gels and stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. Band intensities were quantitated following scanning of individual gels on a Apple Macintosh® computer using the public domain NIH Image program (developed at the U. S. National Institutes of Health and available on the Internet). 2The Internet address ishttp://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image. Experiments were performed using an IAsys resonant mirror optical biosensor (Affinity Sensors, Cambridge, UK). Thioredoxin fusions of TGN38 cytosolic domains were immobilized on carboxymethyl-dextran cuvette surfaces according to the manufacturer's instructions. Binding experiments were performed in 50 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 10% glycerol. μ2ΔN was added to a final concentration of 0.2 μm in a total volume of 200 μl, and changes in resonant angle were monitored at 1-s intervals for approximately 300 s. Experiments were performed at 25 °C with a stirrer speed of 100 rpm. For repeated measurements using the same cuvette, surfaces were regenerated by washing for 2 min in 200 mm formic acid. For peptide competition experiments, μ2ΔN was preincubated with 10 μm peptide (CKASDYQRLNLKL) for 1 h at room temperature before addition to the cuvette. Fluorescence emission was monitored between 300 and 450 nm following excitation at 290 nm using a Perkin-Elmer fluorimeter. A 2-ml cuvette containing Trx-μ2ΔN at 50 nm was used. 5-μl aliquots of GST-TGN38 fusion were added sequentially (each addition increasing the concentration of GST fusion in the cuvette by 30 nm), and fluorescence emission was monitored. A base line of fluorescence from the buffer alone was subtracted from each data set prior to analysis. Data were plotted and analyzed using the GraFit package. Data were analyzed according to the following equations describing the addition of B (GST-TGN38 fusion) to A (Trx-μ2ΔN), and the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated: Fluorescence, F =Ia·[A] + Ib·[B] +Iab·[AB], where I represents the fluorescence intensity, [A] represents the concentration of unbound A, [B] represents the concentration of unbound B, and [AB] represents the concentration of AB complex; [A] = [A]o·(1 − α), [A:B] = [A]o·α, [B]o − [A:B], and α = (([B]o + [A]o + Kd) − ([B]o + [A]o +Kd)2 − 4[A]o·[B]o)0.5)/2.[A]o, where α represents the saturation of A with B, [A]orepresents the total concentration of A, [B]o represents the total concentration of B, and Kd represents the equilibrium dissociation constant. Two hybrid screening (22Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4838) Google Scholar) of a mouse spleen cDNA library with a triplet sequence of the SDYQRL motif found within the cytosolic domain of TGN38 has recently led to the identification of the μ2 subunit of the AP2 adaptor complex as a binding partner (17Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.-C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1995; 269: 1872-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Further analyses confirmed the interaction using a single copy of the motif as well as the cytosolic domain of TGN38. We have used an alternative two hybrid system to test this interaction as well as to assess the strength of interaction with μ1 and μ2 of a number of TGN38 constructs mutated in the serine or tyrosine residues of the SDYQRL motif. In frame fusions of TGN38 cytosolic domain sequences with LexA and coding sequences of μ1 or μ2 with VP16 were generated and transformed into yeast strain L40. Fig. 2 shows the result of a two hybrid β-galactosidase assay to test for interaction between the cytosolic domain of TGN38 and μ1 or μ2. No activation of transcription was detected with any of the constructs individually nor following co-transformation of yeast with pVP16-μ1 or pVP16-μ2 and with a negative control plasmid encoding a LexA-Lamin fusion. A positive signal was seen following cotransformation of yeast with μ2 and the wild-type cytosolic tail of TGN38 after a 6-h incubation. No interaction was observed between any of the other paired constructs even following incubation in the presence of X-gal for up to 24 h. Mutation of Tyr-333 of TGN38 to Ala (Y333A) abolished the interaction, confirming the requirement for a tyrosine-based signal. Mutation of Ser-331 to Ala (S331A) also abolished the interaction. This indicates a requirement for Ser-331 in mediating a high affinity binding of TGN38 to μ2. No interaction was detected between any of the TGN38 constructs and μ1 (the medium chain of the TGN adaptor complex, AP1). To extend the data from the two hybrid system, we have used an in vitro system involving interaction of recombinant fusion proteins of the two binding partners. The cytosolic domain of TGN38 (and mutants thereof) was expressed as a GST fusion, and μ2 and μ2ΔN were expressed as thioredoxin fusions. Proteins were incubated together in solution followed by immunoprecipitation using a thioredoxin-specific polyclonal antibody. The strength of interaction was then assessed by Coomassie Blue staining of polyacrylamide gels. The data of Ohno et al.(17Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.-C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1995; 269: 1872-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar) suggested that μ2 truncated in the first 120 amino acids bound with equal efficiency to TGN38. We too observed equivalent binding of full-length and truncated μ2 to the cytosolic tail of TGN38. Noin vitro data could be obtained for binding of μ1 because soluble protein could not be generated in sufficient amounts. The results of these experiments showed, in agreement with the two hybrid data, that the wild-type cytosolic domain of TGN38 interacts with μ2ΔN (Fig. 3A, lane 2). Binding was considerably reduced by mutation of either the tyrosine or serine residues of the SDYQRL motif to alanine (Fig. 3A,lanes 3 and 4, respectively). Quantitation of band intensities using the NIH Image package (Fig. 3B) showed that there was more than 2-fold greater binding of μ2ΔN to the wild-type TGN38 fusion protein compared with either S331A or Y333A mutants. A possible explanation for the observed binding of both the S331A and Y333A mutants above that of GST alone is that the GST fusion proteins used in this part of the study may have the potential to dimerize (23Ji X. Zhang P. Armstrong R.N. Gilliland G.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 267: 4296-4299Google Scholar). Multimeric forms of the cytosolic domain of TGN38 may mediate a different interaction with μ2 than the LexA and thioredoxin fusions used for the other analyses described here. These results, however, do support the observation from the two hybrid analysis that the S331A mutation disrupts the interaction with μ2ΔN. The IAsys resonant mirror optical biosensor was used to analyze the interaction between the two proteins in real time. TGN38-thioredoxin fusion proteins were immobilized onto carboxy-methyl dextran cuvettes and binding of μ2ΔN determined. The thioredoxin fusion of TGN38 was used for this part of the study due to the increased stability of these constructs over GST fusions. All TGN38 constructs as well as the thioredoxin domain alone were immobilized at a concentration of 8 ng·mm2 protein. Change in resonant angle was monitored continuously over a 5-min period following the addition of μ2ΔN to a final concentration of 200 nm in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 10% glycerol. Binding curves for these experiments are shown in Fig. 4A. The data are consistent with those obtained from the two previous approaches. As anticipated, μ2ΔN did not bind to Trx-TGN38 fusions in which the tyrosine residue within the SDYQRL motif had been mutated to alanine. A significant reduction in binding was observed for the of Ser-331 to alanine mutant (S331A, Fig. 4A, open squares). No significant binding to thioredoxin alone was observed. Binding curves were replicated in each case following regeneration of the cuvette surface with 200 mm formic acid. Fig. 4B shows that this treatment did not reduce the bioactivity of the surface with regard to μ2ΔN binding (wt 1 and wt 2 in Fig.4B). Binding of μ2ΔN was competed by preincubation with a 50-fold molar excess of synthetic peptide corresponding to part of the cytosolic tail of TGN38 overlapping the SDYQRL motif. Preincubation of μ2ΔN with the peptide followed by subsequent addition to the biosensor cuvette reduced binding significantly (Fig. 4B, wt + pep). Binding of μ2ΔN was repeated following regeneration of the surface as before to remove the peptide and any bound μ2ΔN. In this case a reduction in binding was observed (wt 3 in Fig.4B). The level of binding was still above that seen in the presence of competing peptide but less than that seen initially. The most plausible explanation for this is that the peptide was not completely removed from the dextran matrix by formic acid treatment. The data obtained from the optical biosensor are in complete agreement with that obtained from the other approaches but also show that the effect of the S331A mutation is not as significant as that of Y333A. Equilibrium measurement of tryptophan fluorescence was used to determine the dissociation constant for the interaction between TGN38 and μ2ΔN. Sequential addition of GST-TGN38 to Trx-μ2ΔN would lead to linear increase in fluorescence due to the four tryptophan residues of GST-TGN38. Deviation from the linearity of this increase indicates an interaction between the two proteins. Change in fluorescence was plotted against concentration of GST-TGN38 and then subtracted from the linear increase due to sequential addition of TGN38. The resulting fluorescence quench data were curve fitted to the equation shown under “Experimental Procedures” from which the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated (Fig. 5). Using this method the Kd for the interaction between wild-type TGN38 tail and μ2ΔN was calculated as 58 nm(standard error ± 7). The Kd for the interaction of the S331A fusion with μ2ΔN was similarly determined as 103 nm (standard error ± 8). The dissociation constant for the binding of the Y333A mutant was found to be 755 nm (standard error ± 100). These data are in entirely consistent with those obtained from the other approaches described here. In particular, the lower affinity of the S331A mutant compared with the wild-type protein for μ2ΔN reflects the binding curve obtained using the IAsys optical biosensor, suggesting that the mutation S331A does indeed affect the binding of the cytosolic domain of TGN38 to μ2ΔN. We have used a number of complementary approaches to study the interaction of a tyrosine-based internalization signal with the medium chain component, μ2, of the adaptor complex, AP2. We have studied the internalization signal of TGN38, SDYQRL, which in isolation has previously been shown to interact with the μ2 protein in a two hybrid system and in an in vitro binding assay (17Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.-C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1995; 269: 1872-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). The context of critical tyrosine residues within internalization signals is almost certainly important for specificity, for example, the spacing of the tyrosine motif of lamp-1 from the membrane is critical for interaction with the TGN adaptor complex, AP1 (24Rohrer J. Schweizer A. Russell D. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The triplet repeats used by Ohno et al. (17Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.-C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1995; 269: 1872-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar) would obviously also be very different in structure to the entire cytosolic domain of TGN38, which has been shown by NMR to form a nascent helix in solution (25Wilde A. Dempsey C. Banting G. J . Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7131-7136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For this reason, we chose to study the interaction in more detail using the entire cytosolic domain of TGN38. Initial experiments exploited the yeast two hybrid system (22Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4838) Google Scholar) to study the interaction. Interaction was detected between μ2 and the wild-type TGN38 cytosolic domain but not following mutation of the tyrosine or serine residues of the SDYQRL motif to alanine. No interaction was detected between the cytosolic tail of TGN38 and μ1. This is in conflict with the results of Ohno et al. (17Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.-C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1995; 269: 1872-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar), who readily detected an interaction between a triplet repeat of SDYQRL and μ1. This suggests that the interaction, if any, between the entire cytosolic tail of TGN38 and μ1 is too weak to be detected using the sensitive two hybrid system we employed. It can be inferred from this that the context of the critical tyrosine residue is an important determinant of adaptor binding. Indeed, recent surface plasmon resonance data from the same group showed that the cytosolic domain of TGN38 does bind to AP1 with lower affinity than AP2 (26Boll W. Ohno H. Songyang Z. Rapoport I. Cantley L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5789-5795Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) in agreement with our two hybrid data. Similarly, the endocytic signal of the epidermal growth factor receptor has been shown to bind to AP1 with lower affinity than to AP2 (27Boll W. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1168-1178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The two hybrid experiments reported here also show an importance for Ser-331 of the SDYQRL motif in determining binding specificity. This result complements the earlier biological observation that mutation of serine-331 plays a role in determining the intracellular localization of TGN38 (5Wong S.H. Hong W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22853-22862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ohno et al. demonstrated that mutation of this residue to alanine did not affect binding of an isolated SDYQRL motif to μ2 when assayed for growth on histidine-deficient medium (17Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.-C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1995; 269: 1872-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). These growth assays are not quantitative, and so it is difficult to determine the relative importance of this mutation. In our hands the same mutation, in the context of the entire cytosolic tail sequence, completely abolished interaction with μ2 as evidenced by lack of activation of transcription of the β-galactosidase reporter gene. More recently, two hybrid screening of a combinatorial cDNA library of constructs ending AAYXXX (26Boll W. Ohno H. Songyang Z. Rapoport I. Cantley L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5789-5795Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) also failed to show any role for Ser-331 of TGN38 in mediating binding to μ2. Again, this discrepancy with our data is most easily explained by the context of the tyrosine motif. Our constructs have the additional four amino acids (NLKL) of TGN38 present, whereas those used for screening of the combinatorial library did not. Thus, although the tetrapeptide sequence of YXX∅ may be sufficient for directing binding to μ2, it is clear that the exact sequence context of these motifs affects the affinity of binding and therefore presumably the efficiency of sorting into endocytic vesicles. To complement the two hybrid data, we investigated the interaction between recombinant fusion proteins of the two binding partners. Fusion proteins were incubated together, and complexes were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Using this approach we were able to detect binding of the wild-type cytosolic domain of TGN38 to μ2ΔN (a μ2 construct deleted in the first 120 amino acids, a modification that has been shown not to alter binding to the cytosolic domain of TGN38; Ref. 17Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.-C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1995; 269: 1872-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). In addition, this result confirmed the observation apparent from our two hybrid results that both Ser-331 and Tyr-333 of the cytosolic domain of TGN38 are important in mediating a high affinity interaction with μ2ΔN. In addition to the above approaches, we have utilized the IAsys resonant mirror optical biosensor to investigate the interaction between TGN38 and μ2ΔN. The biosensor measures changes in resonant angle that occur on binding of, in this case, μ2ΔN to TGN38 cytosolic domains immobilized on a cuvette surface in real time. No binding of the thioredoxin fusion domain alone was observed, indicating that any interaction observed is due to the μ2ΔN domain. We were able to confirm the absolute requirement of Tyr-333 in the interaction because mutation to alanine (Y333A) abolished the interaction. In addition, binding was also competable using a synthetic peptide containing the SDYQRL motif. The inhibition of binding was significant but not complete, probably due to insufficiently high peptide concentrations (10 μm). Indeed Heilker et al.(28Heilker R. Manning-Krieg U. Zuber J.-F. Spiess M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2893-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) found that 20 μm peptide did not significantly affect binding of internalization motifs to adaptor complexes as assessed by surface plasmon resonance. Very high concentrations of competing peptide were also required for competition of binding oflamp-1 to adaptor complexes (18Honing S. Griffith J. Geuze H.J. Hunziker W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5230-5239Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This may be a feature of the different affinities of the free peptide and immobilized fusion protein for μ2 resulting from the context or presentation of the tyrosine motif. The peptide used in this study had only four residues upstream of the SDYQRL motif, and it is possible that this greatly reduced the affinity of interaction with μ2 compared with the entire cytosolic domain of TGN38. The fact that binding was at least to some extent competable suggests specificity of interaction. Due to the exquisite sensitivity of the system, the IAsys experiments showed an effect of Ser-331 in determining efficiency of binding not apparent from the two hybrid analyses or immunoprecipitation. Mutation of this residue to alanine (S331A) significantly reduced the amount of binding detected as well as the initial rate of the interaction but unlike the Y333A mutation caused only a partial disruption of binding. This suggests that in the context of the complete TGN38 tail sequence, this upstream residue is important in determining the affinity of interaction between TGN38 and the adaptor complex and is consistent with previously published data implicating Ser-331 in internalization and return of TGN38 to the TGN (5Wong S.H. Hong W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22853-22862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of S331A TGN38 in COS-7 cells does lead to enhanced expression of TGN38 at the cell surface compared with similar levels of expression of wild-type TGN38. 3E. P. Roquemore and G. Banting, submitted for publication. To determine the equilibrium dissociation constant for the interaction between TGN38 and μ2, we studied quenching of tryptophan fluorescence on binding. On addition of TGN38 fusion proteins, a nonlinear increase of fluorescence was observed, and from this dissociation constants for the interactions were calculated. Strong binding of the wild-type cytosolic domain of TGN38 to μ2ΔN was observed (Kd = 58 nm) with somewhat weaker binding for the S331A mutant (Kd = 103 nm). Binding of the Y333A mutant was significantly lower (Kd>700 nm). Interaction was barely detectable with this mutant as evidenced by the low confidence limits of the calculated dissociation constant (standard error = ±100 nm). This quantitative approach confirms the observations from the other techniques described here. The data confirm that the tyrosine residue within the SDYQRL motif of TGN38 is essential for binding to the μ2 chain of the AP2 complex and in addition indicate that the serine residue within this motif is also important in mediating high affinity binding to the complex. Our data are somewhat in conflict with previously published results (17Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.-C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1995; 269: 1872-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar) because they indicate an important role for residues other than the tyrosine and bulky hydrophobic residue of the YXX∅ consensus in determining specificity of binding of tyrosine-based targeting motifs to adaptors. This additional specificity may have a role in determining the subcellular compartment to which proteins are ultimately targeted. This may be of particular relevance to TGN38 given the demonstration of a role for Ser-331 in return of the protein from the cell surface to the TGN (5Wong S.H. Hong W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22853-22862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The greater affinity of interaction shown here between TGN38 and μ2 compared with μ1 might account for the observed traffic of TGN38 to the cell surface and its subsequent internalization as opposed to μ1-mediated transport direct from the TGN to lysosomal compartments. Similar differences in binding affinity of TGN38 to adaptor complexes at the level of the sorting endosome could mediate transport to the TGN as opposed to entering a recycling pathway such as that seen for the transferrin receptor. In summary, we have shown using three complementary approaches that the complete cytosolic tail of TGN38 interacts with the μ2 subunit of the AP2 adaptor complex. The interaction has been shown to occur in free solution, intracellularly (using the two hybrid system) and also by recruitment of μ2ΔN to immobilized TCN38 tails (IAsys measurements). The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) for the interaction is 58 nm. The interaction has been shown to be dependant not only on the tyrosine residue of the internalization motif of TGN38 but also on the serine residue upstream of this YXX∅ motif. We thank Dr. M. S. Robinson (University of Cambridge) for providing cDNAs of μ1 and μ2, Drs. S. Hollenberg, P. Bartel, and S. Fields for the two hybrid vectors and yeast strain, Dr. M.

It is generally assumed that the asymmetric GroEL·GroES complex is the acceptor state for substrate protein. Nevertheless, this species is poorly understood in its binding characteristics for nucleotide and nonnative protein. We show here that this species has a high affinity binding site for nonnative protein. In addition to this, binding of nucleotide to one GroEL ring is strongly favored by GroES binding to the other ring. However, the slow rate of release of substrate protein from the unproductive trans-position kinetically favors the binding of a second GroES, thereby forming a symmetric GroEL14·(GroES7)2complex and simultaneously ensuring that substrate protein is sequestered in a position underneath GroES. Our results demonstrate that the intrinsic binding characteristics of the trans-bullet complex determine the sequence of events during the reaction cycle.

Their most prominent tasks seem to be the folding of newly synthesized proteins (4Horwich A.L. Low K.L. Fenton W.A. Hirshfield I.N. Furtak K. Cell. 1993; 74: 909-917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) and preventing irreversible aggregation of nonnative protein (5Buchner J. Schmidt M. Fuchs M. Jaenicke R. Rudolph R. Schmid F.X. Kiefhaber T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1586-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 6Höll-Neugebauer B. Rudolph R. Schmidt M. Buchner J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11609-11614Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In vitro, their protein folding activity can be demonstrated by the increase in the reactivation yield of numerous structurally different proteins after denaturation with chaotropes (7Jaenicke R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 104-112Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Chaperone-mediated refolding of denatured protein allows to overcome highly unfavorable or even completely nonpermissive folding conditions. To achieve this function in the case of GroE, a chaperone oligomer of extraordinary structural complexity is required. Seven GroEL monomers are associated to a ring, forming a binding cavity for nonnative protein at the inner side of the central channel (8Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Two such seven-membered rings are associated back to back building a cylindrical complex. The crystal structure of GroEL shows a tripartite structure of the GroEL monomer (9Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hedge R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). The interactions of the equatorial domains provide the contacts between the individual subunits within a ring as well as the interface to the second ring of the complex. A small intermediate domain connects to the apical domain, which forms the ends of the cylinder. These ends are of outstanding functional importance since both binding of nonnative protein and of the co-chaperone GroES are located in this region. The reversible interaction of GroEL with nonnative substrate protein via hydrophobic interactions (10Zahn R. Axmann S.E. Rücknagel K.-P. Jaeger E. Laminet A.A. Plückthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 150-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 11Lin Z. Schwarz F.P. Eisenstein E. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 258: 74-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) is controlled by the binding and hydrolysis of ATP. Loading of the nucleotide-binding sites of GroEL with ATP switches them to a low affinity state for denatured protein (12Sparrer H. Lilie H. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 74-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 13Lin Z. Eisenstein E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1977-1981Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The importance of ATP-induced conformational changes for the functional cycle has been demonstrated using a GroE mutant in which domain movements were blocked by a cystine bridge (14Murai N. Makino Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28229-28234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). If GroES is present, the ordered association of nucleotide and GroES leads to the formation of an asymmetric, bullet-shaped GroES·GroEL complex, the three-dimensional structure of which has been elucidated by cryo-electron microscopy and image reconstruction (15Roseman A.M. Chen S. White H. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Cell. 1996; 87: 241-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of ATP in one ring releases GroES and nucleotide from the other ring in reverse order (16Todd M.J. Viitanen P. Lorimer G.H. Science. 1994; 265: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 17Burston S.G. Ranson N.A. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 138-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The order of binding is also of crucial importance in GroE-mediated folding of substrate protein. Association of a folding intermediate and subsequent binding of GroES to the same ring sequesters the polypeptide in a position under GroES (cis-bullet complex) and is a prerequisite for productive folding (18Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). At present, it is enigmatic how the binding of nonnative protein, GroES, and ATP and their dissociation from GroE are integrated in the folding cycle. To analyze the acceptor state for denatured substrate protein, we determined the ability of GroEL, as well as that of the asymmetric GroEL·GroES bullet complex, to bind nonnative protein. As a nonnative protein substrate, we used a slow folding mutant of MBP 1The abbreviations used are:MBPmaltose-binding proteinRBPribose-binding proteinRubiscoribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenaseATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) since the unfolding of this protein is completely reversible and it can be monitored directly by following changes in tryptophan fluorescence. This allows quantitative analysis of the folding kinetics. The interaction of MBP with the chaperone SecB has been investigated in detail (19Randall L.L. Hardy S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 65-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and, recently, MBP has been used to characterize the effects of nucleotides on the binding characteristics of GroEL (12Sparrer H. Lilie H. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 74-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Folding of MBP can be completely suppressed in the presence of GroEL. The protein released from GroEL in the presence or absence of nucleotide folds with kinetics similar to those of the spontaneous folding reaction. Thus, the rate-limiting folding step is not changed by binding to GroEL. Structural rearrangements may, however, occur on GroEL in the case of kinetically trapped proteins (see “Discussion”). Efficient release of MBP requires the loading of GroEL with nucleotides, which converts the high affinity binding site(s) for proteins into the low affinity state. Here, we used the release of MBP bound to GroEL to determine how GroES bound to one ring of GroEL influences the binding properties of the opposite ring. A major advantage of MBP as a model substrate in this context is that it allows the performance of competition experiments with the structurally closely related RBP and mutants thereof (20Teschke C.M. Kim J. Song T. Park S. Park C. Randall L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11789-11796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and thus the determination of microscopic on and off rates of the interaction between MBP and GroE complexes. maltose-binding protein ribose-binding protein ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) We present a model of how GroES regulates the interaction of the trans-ring with nucleotide, nonnative protein, and GroES. GroEL and GroES were purified from the Escherichia coli strain JM 109 TZ 136 bearing the multicopy plasmid DHαpOF 39 (21Fayet O. Louarn J.-M. Georgopoulos C.P. Gen. Genet. 1986; 202: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) as described previously (22Schmidt M. Bücheler U. Kaluza B. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27964-27972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentrations of both chaperones were determined spectrophotometrically by using the following extinction coefficients: E2800.1% = 0.2 for GroEL (12Sparrer H. Lilie H. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 74-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and E2760.1% = 0.142 for GroES (22Schmidt M. Bücheler U. Kaluza B. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27964-27972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine GroEL concentrations, the absorbance spectrum was corrected for light scattering of the solution due to the particle size of GroEL. Furthermore, the GroEL concentrations were confirmed by the results of the binding of MBP Y283D to GroEL showing two independent binding sites (12Sparrer H. Lilie H. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 74-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Mature MBP Y283D and RBP A27T were purified according to previously published protocols (12Sparrer H. Lilie H. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 74-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The concentration of MBP Y283D and RBP A27T were determined spectrophotometrically using extinction coefficients of E2800.1% = 1.94 and E2800.1% = 0.55, respectively. 2L. Randall, personal communication. The molecular masses are 799,932 Da for GroEL14, 72,709 Da for GroES7, 40,659 Da for MBP Y283D, and 28,504 Da for RBP A27T. Folding assays of MBP Y283D were performed in a Spex FluoroMax spectrofluorimeter. Tryptophans were excited with an excitation wavelength of 295 nm, and emission was recorded at 344 nm. The bandwidths for excitation and emission were set to 2.5 and 8.5 nm, respectively. All experiments were performed in a thermostatted cuvette under constant stirring. The temperature for all experiments was set to 25 °C. Our standard folding conditions used throughout the experiments were 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 200 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2. MBP Y283D was denatured in 4 m guanidinium chloride, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, for at least 1 h at room temperature. Denatured MBP Y283D was diluted 200-fold in renaturation buffer, giving a final concentration of 25 nm. The residual concentration of guanidinium chloride was 20 mm. A slow folding mutant of RBP A27T (CP632) was denatured for at least 4 h at room temperature in 3.3 m urea. Stock solutions of denatured RBP A27T were 480 μm. Competition experiments were performed as follows (cf. Ref.12Sparrer H. Lilie H. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 74-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Prior to addition of denatured MBP Y283D, the following GroEL or GroEL14·GroES7 complexes were formed (see also “Results”). 1) The high affinity state of GroEL14was analyzed in the absence of nucleotide; 2) the low affinity state of GroEL14 was formed at concentrations of 1 mm ATPγS and 5 mm ADP, respectively; 3) the high affinity site of the trans-ring of the GroEL14·GroES7 complex was populated in the presence of 5 μm ATPγS or 10 μm ADP (25 nm GroEL and 80 nm GroES); and 4) the low affinity site of the trans-ring of the GroEL14·GroES7 complex was created in the presence of 100 μm ATPγS and 200 μm ADP, respectively. After forming these species, 25 nm denatured MBP Y283D was added to start the reaction. To avoid interference with the reassociation reaction, denatured RBP A27T was added as a competitor 30–60 s later. The final concentration of the competitor was 5 μm (200-fold excess over MBP Y283D), yielding a residual concentration of 30 mm urea. Binding of GroES to GroEL is not affected by the final concentration of denaturant, since the same number of binding sites for MBP can be determined both in its presence or absence (see “Results”). Since the amount of denatured RBP A27T is constantly reduced by spontaneous folding, additional denatured RBP A27T was added every 200 s. To calculate the concentrations of high and low affinity binding sites, numerical simulation of the data assuming a rebinding equilibrium was performed with the program KINSIM (24Barshop B.A. Wrenn R.F. Frieden C. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 133: 134-145Crossref Scopus (667) Google Scholar). The following mechanism file was used for the simulation of the titration of the binding sites with different nucleotides (Scheme 1).1)MBPden.+GroELhigh aff.⇔MBPden..GroElhigh aff.2)MBPden.+GroELlow aff.⇔MBPden..GroEllow aff.3)MBPden.→MBPnat. SCHEME I The different species in the mechanism are as follows. MBPden. is a MBP Y283D folding intermediate; MBPnat. is a native MBP Y283D molecule; GroELhigh aff. is a high affinity site of GroEL, irrespective whether it refers to a GroEL double ring or an asymmetric bullet; GroELlow aff. is a low affinity site of GroEL, irrespective whether it refers to a GroEL double ring or an asymmetric bullet; ↔ represents a binding-rebinding equilibrium; → represents an irreversible reaction. This mechanism reflects that folding of denatured MBP Y283D is completely blocked after association with GroEL and that folding intermediates free in solution fold to the native state with the spontaneous folding rate. Furthermore, an MBP Y283D folding intermediate can associate to a low and a high affinity binding site, depending on whether the respective ring is titrated with nucleotide or not. For both the high and the low affinity GroEL binding sites, the microscopic association and dissociation rates were determined by competition experiments as described previously (12Sparrer H. Lilie H. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 74-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and these parameters were included in the simulation. The competition experiments were performed for the GroEL double ring and the asymmetric bullet, respectively. For the ADP-jump experiments, simulating the transition from the high affinity state to the low affinity state of the trans-ring in the asymmetric bullet, the following mechanism was used (Scheme II).1)MBPden.+GroELhigh aff.⇔MBPden..GroElhigh aff.2)MBPden.+GroELlow aff.⇔MBPden..GroEllow aff. MBPden.+GroELhigh aff.⇔GroEllow aff.+MBP3)MBPden.→MBPnat. SCHEME II Since all MBP Y283D molecules were stably associated with the high affinity site of the trans-bullet, the concentration of the MBPden.·GroELhigh aff. complex was set to 25 nm in the beginning of the reaction. Upon binding of ADP, this complex is converted to a low affinity complex and MBP Y283D folding intermediates formerly bound to the trans-ring are released. These folding intermediate may then fold to the native state with the spontaneous folding rate, or they may be rebound transiently by a low affinity complex, which is characterized by the on and off rates obtained from the competition experiments. Analysis of the cooperativity in the transition of the GroEL binding sites from a high affinity state to a low affinity state was performed by fitting the relative percentage of low affinity states to the Hill equation: x0 = xmax ×K[S]n/(1 + K[S]n), wherex0 and xmax are the minimal and maximal percentages, [S] is the concentration of nucleotide, K is the apparent nucleotide binding constant, and n is the Hill coefficient. The first step in GroE-mediated protein folding is the entry of nonnative protein in the reaction cycle. However, none of the potential acceptor states has been analyzed previously with respect to their protein binding properties. Therefore, we characterized both GroEL and the asymmetric bullet as potential acceptor states for binding nonnative protein using a mutant of maltose-binding protein, MBP Y283D, as a nonnative substrate. This protein directly reports the number of binding sites on GroEL, as well as the strength of the interaction (12Sparrer H. Lilie H. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 74-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Association of MBP Y283D to a high affinity binding site of GroEL leads to the formation of a very tight complex (KD 1.0 × 10−11m), in which the folding of MBP Y283D is completely suppressed (12Sparrer H. Lilie H. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 74-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For GroEL, binding of nucleotide to one ring is sufficient to convert its high affinity binding site for nonnative protein to a low affinity state. The conformational change induced by nucleotide binding leads to an increase in the dissociation equilibrium constant for nonnative protein by 3 orders of magnitude (12Sparrer H. Lilie H. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 74-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Consequently, in the low affinity state complete folding of MBP Y283D is not inhibited by GroEL. Binding of nucleotide to GroEL occurs in a cooperative manner involving one ring at a time (25Yifrach O. Horovitz A Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5303-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Therefore, concomitant changes in affinity can be directly tested by the binding assay for denatured MBP Y283D, which allows a quantitative description of this reaction, since all the microscopic rate constants for association and dissociation of MBP Y283D and GroEL can be obtained by a competition assay (12Sparrer H. Lilie H. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 74-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As expected, titration of GroEL with increasing amounts of nucleotide leads to a decrease of high affinity binding sites, which is reflected in a higher amount of folding of MBP Y283D. For GroEL alone, an increase in the concentration of ATPγS resulted in a cooperative transition of the substrate binding sites in both rings to the low affinity state with a midpoint at 40 μm ATPγS (Fig.1). The Hill coefficient for the allosteric transition was 1.6. This is in good agreement with data by Gray and Fersht (26Gray T. Fersht A.R. FEBS Lett. 1991; 292: 254-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and Yifrach and Horovitz (25Yifrach O. Horovitz A Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5303-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). For ADP, the midpoint of the transition occurs at much higher nucleotide concentrations, reflecting its weak binding to GroEL. The midpoint of the transition is at 200 μm, and the two binding sites for substrate protein are completely shifted to the low affinity state at ADP concentrations above 2 mm. Similarly, conformational changes were reported for a pyrene-labeled GroEL upon binding of ADP (17Burston S.G. Ranson N.A. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 138-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 27Jackson G.S. Staniforth R.A. Halsall D.J. Atkinson T. Holbrook J.J. Clarke A.R. Burston S.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2554-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Thus, independent methods monitoring conformational changes of GroEL confirm the validity of the transitions observed. The co-chaperone GroES is an essential component for GroE-mediated protein folding under nonpermissive conditions (18Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 28Goloubinoff P. Christseller J.T. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H.

Nature. 1996; 379: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In the presence of nucleotide and GroES, an asymmetric bullet-shaped GroEL·GroES particle is formed. The binding of GroES to GroEL is very tight, with a dissociation constant for this binary complex of 0.3–0.5 nm (27Jackson G.S. Staniforth R.A. Halsall D.J. Atkinson T. Holbrook J.J. Clarke A.R. Burston S.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2554-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Therefore, the asymmetric bullet should be present exclusively under our experimental conditions. This could be directly demonstrated in the MBP binding assay. Since two independent binding sites for MBP Y283D have been reported (12Sparrer H. Lilie H. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 74-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), addition of nucleotide and GroES to GroEL prior to substrate protein should result in a reduction of the available binding sites to one. As shown in Fig.2 in the presence of low concentrations of nucleotide and excess GroES, indeed about only one half of the fluorescence amplitude can be detected (Fig. 2). The rate constant of this folding reaction is identical to the rate constant observed in the absence of chaperones. This indicates that half of the molecules did not interact with GroEL, because one binding site in the GroES7·ADP7·GroEL14 complex is blocked by GroES. The second half of the amplitude for the MBP Y283D folding reaction could be recovered by the addition of ATP (Fig. 2). This proved that half of the molecules were indeed trapped by the asymmetric bullet, with GroES and nonnative substrate protein associated to opposite ends of the cylinder (trans-bullet). Since folding of MBP Y283D could be suppressed completely in the presence of equimolar concentrations of the asymmetric bullet and MBP Y283D, we conclude that the trans-ring existed in a nucleotide-free, high affinity state for substrate protein. Competition experiments with denatured RBP A27T confirmed the tight binding of nonnative protein to the trans-ring. In the presence of an excess of denatured RBP A27T, about the same off rate of MBP Y283D folding intermediates was measured as for a high affinity binding site of GroEL alone (Table I). Since residual amounts of denaturant introduced in the folding assay may disturb the stability of the GroEL·GroES complex (31Todd M.J. Lorimer G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5388-5394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we measured the number of binding sites in the presence of corresponding amounts of urea and found again one binding site per asymmetric complex (data not shown). We therefore conclude that GroES was indeed associated with GroEL during the competition assay.Table IMicroscopic on and off rates for nonnative protein and GroEL or the asymmetric GroEL·GroES complexComplexOn rateOff rateKdissm−1·s−1s−1mGroEL + ADPHigh affinity state1.0 · 1087.5 · 10−47.5 · 10−12Low affinity state3.0 · 1051.7 · 10−35.7 · 10−9GroEL + ATPγSHigh affinity state1.0 · 1087.5 · 10−47.5 · 10−12Low affinity state8.0 · 1051.0 · 10−31.3 · 10−9GroES7·ADP·GroEL14complexHigh affinity state1.0 · 1089.7 · 10−49.7 · 10−12Low affinity state1.0 · 1052.8 · 10−32.8 · 10−8GroES7·ATPγS7·GroEL14 complexHigh affinity state1.0 · 1085.0 · 10−45.0 · 10−12Low affinity state2.0 · 1052.0 · 10−31.0 · 10−8The microscopic on and off rates were determined via a competition assay with RBP A27T (see “Experimental Procedures” and Ref. 12Sparrer H. Lilie H. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 74-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The affinity of a GroE binding site for MBP Y283D folding intermediates is reflected in the ability of the respective GroE species to retard the folding of MBP Y283D compared to the spontaneous folding reaction. In the presence of the competitor protein, the off rate can be directly determined. The respective on rates were obtained by a kinetic simulation of the reaction. Open table in a new tab The microscopic on and off rates were determined via a competition assay with RBP A27T (see “Experimental Procedures” and Ref. 12Sparrer H. Lilie H. Buchner J. J. Mol.

The affinity of a GroE binding site for MBP Y283D folding intermediates is reflected in the ability of the respective GroE species to retard the folding of MBP Y283D compared to the spontaneous folding reaction. In the presence of the competitor protein, the off rate can be directly determined. The respective on rates were obtained by a kinetic simulation of the reaction. From published data (e.g. Refs. 16Todd M.J. Viitanen P. Lorimer G.H. Science. 1994; 265: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar and 17Burston S.G. Ranson N.A. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 138-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), it is evident that, in the presence of ADP, GroEL and GroES form a stable complex in which GroES does not exchange during a time course of hours. The experiments described above show that nonnative protein is stably bound in the trans-position of the GroEL·GroES complex with an affinity comparable to that previously determined for GroEL (12Sparrer H. Lilie H. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 74-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible to create a well defined static bullet complex loaded with substrate protein in trans as a starting point for experiments to analyze the regulation of the trans-ring by GroES. This is an important unresolved question for understanding the molecular mechanism of protein folding mediated by the GroE double ring complex. First, we performed titration experiments with ADP and ATPγS. In these experiments, the influence of GroES bound to one GroEL ring on nucleotide binding to the opposite GroEL ring could be tested. Interestingly, we found that the affinity for both ATPγS and ADP to the trans-ring was about 1 order of magnitude higher in the asymmetric complex compared with GroEL alone (Fig. 3). For ATPγS, the trans-ring was converted to the low affinity state for protein between 5 μm and 30 μm, while for ADP the respective transition was between 20 μm and 100 μm. The Hill coefficients for nucleotide binding increased from 1.6 to 4.4 for ATPγS and from 1.2 to 3.7 for ADP, respectively. In its low affinity state, the trans-bullet showed almost no affinity for denatured protein. The folding rates of MBP Y283D in the presence of the low affinity bullet were almost identical to the spontaneous folding reaction. Surprisingly, in comparison to the low affinity sites of GroEL, the dissociation equilibrium constant was further increased by more than a factor of 5 (Table I). Thus, GroES bound in cis weakens the interaction of substrate bound to GroEL in the trans-ring. From the data presented above, we conclude that the trans-ring of the asymmetric bullet exists in a low and high affinity state, depending on whether it is occupied with nucleotide or not. Interaction of GroES with one GroEL ring increases the affinity and cooperativity of nucleotide binding to the other ring considerably. This results in a shift for the transition from a high affinity state to the low affinity state to much lower nucleotide concentrations compared with GroEL. Thus, the notion of two distinct states determining the interaction with nonnative protein is also valid for the trans-ring, while the cis-ring is stably associated with GroES. In addition, GroES influences the trans-ring further by increasing the dissociation equilibrium constant for nonnative protein. The markedly enhanced binding of nucleotide to the trans-ring makes the formation of a symmetric GroE-species with respect to nucleotide binding more favorable. This is in contrast to the empty GroEL ring, where symmetric binding of nucleotide is strongly hindered by the negative cooperativity of the GroEL rings (25Yifrach O. Horovitz A Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5303-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Next, we determined how the reaction cycle proceeds after formation of the asymmetric bullet with nonnative protein bound in trans. Therefore, in addition to studying the transition in binding affinity under equilibrium conditions, we tr"
https://openalex.org/W2008419154,"One basis for the evolution of organisms is the acquisition of new temporal and spatial domains of gene expression. Such novel expression domains could be generated either bycis sequence changes that alter the complement oftrans-acting regulators binding to control elements or by changes in the expression patterns of one or more of the regulatory (trans) factors themselves. The γ globin gene is a prime example of a gene that has undergone a distinct change in temporal expression at a defined time in evolution. Approximately 35–55 million years ago, the previously embryonic γ gene acquired a fetal expression pattern. This change occurred in a simian primate ancestor after the separation of simian and prosimian primates but before the further separation of the major simian lineages; thus, the (prosimian) galago γ gene retains the ancestral embryonic expression pattern, whereas the (simian) human γ gene is fetal. This analysis of galago and human γ genes in transgenic mice demonstrates thatcis changes in sequences within a 4.0-kilobase region surrounding the γ gene were responsible for the evolution of a novel fetal expression pattern in the γ globin genes of simian primates. One basis for the evolution of organisms is the acquisition of new temporal and spatial domains of gene expression. Such novel expression domains could be generated either bycis sequence changes that alter the complement oftrans-acting regulators binding to control elements or by changes in the expression patterns of one or more of the regulatory (trans) factors themselves.

Reconstruction of the evolutionary history of the mammalian β globin gene cluster indicates that in the common ancestor of marsupial and placental mammals (135 MYA), 1The abbreviations used are:MYAmillion years agoLCRlocus control regionbpbase pair(s)kbkilobase(s)HShypersensitive siteSSPstage selector protein two β-like globin genes existed, each with a different temporal expression pattern (1Koop B.F. Goodman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3893-3897Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This two gene cluster, 5′-ε-β-3′, persists in present day marsupials; the ε gene is expressed in embryonic life, whereas the β gene is active postembryonically (1Koop B.F. Goodman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3893-3897Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 2Cooper S.J.B. Hope R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11777-11781Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In early placental mammals, however, prior to the mammalian radiation (80–100 MYA), a β duplication produced two postembryonic genes (δ and β), and ε duplications produced three embryonic genes (ε, γ, and η) (3Goodman M. Koop B.F. Czelusniak J. Weiss M.L. Slightom J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 108: 803-823Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 4Hardison R.C. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1984; 1: 390-410PubMed Google Scholar). Although gene duplications, gene inactivations, gene deletions, and even whole locus duplications or triplications have further modified the β globin loci of all present day eutherian mammals, a clear relationship to this ancestral five-member cluster can still be appreciated (3Goodman M. Koop B.F. Czelusniak J. Weiss M.L. Slightom J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 108: 803-823Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Moreover, these five genes have, for the most part, retained their ancestral programs of stage specificity; the ε gene is embryonic, and the β gene is postembryonic in all extant eutherian mammals. However, some lineage-specific alterations in the temporal expression of globin genes have occurred. An important example is the γ globin gene; originally embryonic in its expression pattern, the γ gene was recently recruited to be a fetal gene in anthropoid (simian) primates (5Tagle D.A. Koop B.F. Goodman M. Slightom J.L. Hess D.L. Jones R.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 439-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). million years ago locus control region base pair(s) kilobase(s) hypersensitive site stage selector protein All simian γ genes studied to date are expressed fetally, whereas prosimian γ genes retain the embryonic pattern characteristic of other (nonprimate) eutherian mammals (4Hardison R.C.

Chem. 1984; 259: 3739-3747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, acquisition of fetal specificity can be traced to a relatively narrow evolutionary window (35–55 MYA), after the separation of simian (catarrhine and platyrrhine) from prosimian (galagos and lemurs) primates but prior to the divergence of platyrrhine (New World Monkeys) from catarrhine (Old World Monkeys, apes, and human) primates (4Hardison R.C. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1984; 1: 390-410PubMed Google Scholar, 5Tagle D.A. Koop B.F. Goodman M. Slightom J.L. Hess D.L. Jones R.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 439-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Two other events can be traced to this same evolutionary window: duplication of the γ gene and a burst of base substitutions that occurred both in the promoter region of the γ globin gene and in coding regions (5Tagle D.A. Koop B.F. Goodman M. Slightom J.L. Hess D.L. Jones R.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 439-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Amino acid substitutions resulting from the coding region changes led to loss of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate binding ability, resulting in a fetal hemoglobin molecule that could bind oxygen with increased affinity and thus facilitate the transfer of oxygen from mother to fetus. Both the promoter and coding region base substitutions were subsequently fixed during further evolution of platyrrhine and catarrhine primates. This pattern of accelerated base substitution followed by decelerated rates of substitutions in the same regions has been considered indicative of the spreading and subsequent preservation of adaptive substitutions (8Goodman M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1981; 37: 105-164Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 9Czelusniak J. Goodman M. Hewett-Emmett D. Weiss M.L. Venta P.J. Tashian R.E.

Biol. 1987; 522: 875-890Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Although these three molecular events (fetal recruitment, gene duplication, and the burst of promoter substitutions) cannot be temporally ordered based on current phylogenetic evidence, one possible scenario is that the duplication of the γ gene provided a redundant substrate for the accumulation of base changes that altered γ stage specificity (6Goodman M. Slightom J.L. Gumucio D.L. Holmes R.S. Lim H.A. Gene Families: Structure, Function, Genetics and Evolution. World Scientific Publishing Co., River Edge, New Jersey1996: 43-52Google Scholar, 11Fitch D.H.A. Bailey W.J. Tagle D.A. Goodman M. Sieu L. Slightom J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7396-7400Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Once such a base change was collected, perhaps in the duplicate γ gene at greater distance from the LCR (Aγ or γ2), they may have been selected for and subsequently transferred to the other gene (Gγ or γ1) by gene conversion. Indeed, evidence exists for gene conversions of this polarity (11Fitch D.H.A. Bailey W.J. Tagle D.A. Goodman M. Sieu L. Slightom J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7396-7400Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 12Hayasaka K. Skinner C.G. Goodman M. Slightom J.L. Genomics. 1993; 18: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Implicit in this hypothetical scenario is the assumption that cis mechanisms were responsible for the fetal recruitment of the γ gene, an assumption that has not been definitively tested. To examine this question directly, transgenic mice were generated in which expression of the galago γ (embryonic) and the human γ (fetal) genes could be compared. Analysis of the stage-specific expression of these two γ genes in the mice reveals distinctly different patterns; galago γ gene expression is embryonic and is silenced in the fetal liver, whereas human γ gene activity peaks in fetal life. cis differences in the γ gene fragments must therefore direct these different expression patterns. The galago γ fragment used spans sequences 10508–14995 of GenBank™ entry M73981of the Galago crassicaudatis β globin cluster. The human γ fragment corresponds to sequences 38084–42140 of the human globin cluster (GenBank™ HUMHBB) and includes the Aγ 3′ enhancer region (13Bodine D.M. Ley T.J. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2997-3004Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The galago γ gene contains several small insertions not present in the human gene, accounting for the slight size difference in these two fragments (4057 and 4487 bp for the human and galago γ gene, respectively). Human ε sequences and HS3 sequences used for both constructs correspond to HUMHBB coordinates 3267–5172 (HS3) and 17841–21241 (ε). Insert DNA was purified away from vector sequences prior to injection of the constructs for production of transgenic mice. Purified DNA fragments were microinjected into F2 hybrid zygotes from C57BL/6J X SJL/J parents at a concentration of 2–3 ng/μl. Injections were done by the Transgenic Animal Model Core in the University of Michigan Biomedical Core Research Facility. All procedures using mice were approved by the University of Michigan Committee on Use and Care of Animals, and all work was conducted in accord with the principles and procedures outlined in the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Use and Care of Experimental Animals. Four founder animals were identified for each construct and were mated to CD-1 females to acquire F1 males that could be used in breeding for all experimental time points. Timed matings were done to obtain F2 (in some cases, F3) conceptuses for S1 analysis. DNA for polymerase chain reaction and Southern analysis was purified from tails of founders or F1 and from the heads of F2 or F3 fetal and embryonic conceptuses. Polymerase chain reaction primers consisted of 5′-AGCTGCTGCAGTCAAAGTCGAATGCAGCTG and 5′-TCCATCCATTTCTACCATTTCTTTCTCCTA and detected the boundary between the upstream ε region and HS3. For determination of copy number and transgene integrity, Southern blots were probed with a 0.4-kb Hin dIII/Bam HI fragment corresponding to the 5′ end of the 1.9-kb Hin dIII HS3 fragment used in both constructs. RNA was extracted from 10.5-day yolk sacs, or from fetal liver of 12.5-, 14.5-, and 16.5-day conceptuses (the morning on which the plug was detected was considered day 0.5). Tissues were dissected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to processing. Isolation of RNA was accomplished using Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's directions. RNA was quantitated spectrophotometrically and was analyzed on agarose gels to assess integrity. To quantitate mRNA levels, S1 nuclease protection was used according to published protocols (14Ulrich M.J. Ley T.J. Blood. 1990; 75: 990-999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). S1 nuclease probes for the detection of human and mouse mRNAs were kindly provided by Dr. Timothy Ley and have been described earlier (14Ulrich M.J. Ley T.J. Blood. 1990; 75: 990-999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ley T.J. Maloney K.A. Gordon J.I. Schwartz A.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1032-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The galago γ S1 probe corresponded to a 435-bpXba I/Bam HI genomic fragment labeled at theBam HI site in exon 2. The protected fragment was 204 bp. Quantitation of the signals from S1 analysis was accomplished using a PhosphorImager with ImageQuant software. Two related constructs (of structure HS3-ε-γ) were introduced into transgenic mice (Fig. 1A). The degree of homology of the two γ fragments used is illustrated in Fig.1B. The native galago β-like globin cluster contains a single γ gene, whereas the human cluster contains two γ genes (5Tagle D.A. Koop B.F. Goodman M. Slightom J.L. Hess D.L. Jones R.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 439-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The human Aγ (γ2) gene, including its 3′ enhancer (13Bodine D.M. Ley T.J. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2997-3004Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), was used in these constructs. The galago γ gene contains sequences similar to the human Aγ enhancer as indicated in the matrix plot of homology shown in Fig. 1B; however, the regulatory function, if any, of this region of the galago γ gene has never been tested. LCR sequences are necessary for the high level expression of human transgenes in the murine background (16Grosveld F. van Assendelft G.B. Greaves D.R. Kollias G. Cell. 1987; 51: 975-985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar), but single DNaseI hypersensitive sites (HS) within the LCR can also confer this property (17Fraser P. Hurst J. Collis P. Grosveld F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3503-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 18Ryan T.M. Behringer R.R. Martin N.C. Townes T.M. Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L.

Because it had been demonstrated that HS3 could impart high level, copy number dependent expression to a human transgene, a 1.9-kbHin dIII fragment spanning this region was included in both constructs (17Fraser P. Hurst J. Collis P. Grosveld F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3503-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 19Philipsen S. Talbot D. Fraser P. Grosveld F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2159-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In addition, earlier data indicated that of all of the hypersensitive sites, HS3 may be uniquely able to drive γ expression in the fetal liver (20Fraser P. Pruzina S. Antoniou M. Grosveld F. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 106-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). To provide a standard against which to compare expression of the human and galago γ genes, the human ε gene (−2000 to +1780) was also included in both constructs. Earlier studies had shown that this ε fragment is expressed in the embryonic yolk sac and silenced autonomously in the fetal liver (21Shih D.M. Wall R.J. Shapiro S.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5465-5472Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 22Raich N. Enver T. Nakamoto B. Josephson B. Papayannopoulou T. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Science. 1990; 250: 1147-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Transgene copy number (Table I) and integrity (not shown) were assessed in Southern blots of tail DNA. For each construct, transgenic males from four independent lines were bred to obtain embryonic and fetal tissues. Table I summarizes the copy number corrected expression levels for ε and γ transgenes in all eight lines examined relative to total mouse α chains.

Open table in a new tab All eight transgenic lines expressed both the ε and γ transgenes. However, line to line variation in transgene expression level was observed, most likely due to position effects. Thus, expression was not copy number-dependent despite the fact that both constructs contained the region of HS3 recently shown to possess dominant chromatin opening function (23Ellis J. Kian C.T.-U. Harper A. Michalovich D. Yannoutsos N. Philipsen S. Grosveld F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 562-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Significant position effects with HS3Aγ transgenes (but missing the Aγ enhancer) have also been observed by others (24Li Q. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6087-6096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, all four HS3-ε-galγ lines and three of four HS3-ε-humγ lines exhibit an inverse relationship between copy number and expression (Table I). This pattern has been observed previously with HS2-containing constructs (25Morley B.J. Abbott C.A. Sharpe J.S. Lida J. Chan-Thomas P.S. Wood W.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2057-2066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the significance of this phenomenon is presently unclear. Although expression levels varied, patterns of transgene expression during development were highly reproducible for each gene as illustrated in Fig. 3 where expression at each time point is plotted relative to the 10.5-day expression level (which is taken as 100%). In both HS3-ε-humγ and HS3-ε-galγ lines, the human ε gene was expressed at high levels in the embryonic yolk sac (day 10.5 and 12.5) and was significantly repressed in 14.5 and 16.5 day fetal livers (Figs. 2 and3). The yolk sac portion (10.5 and 12.5 days) of the ε expression curves in HS3-ε-humγ lines were somewhat more variable than those seen in HS3-ε-galγ lines. However, the well known variability in the timing of development of conceptuses even within the same litter makes it difficult to determine if these differences are significant. Nevertheless, the fetal portion (14.5 and 16.5 days) of the ε expression curves was identical in mice carrying both constructs; the human ε gene was silenced in fetal life. In contrast, the two γ genes exhibited distinctly different expression patterns in the fetal liver (Figs. 2 and 3). The galago γ gene was expressed at highest levels in embryonic life and silenced along with the human ε gene by 14.5 days, mimicking the embryonic pattern characteristic of the galago (5Tagle D.A. Koop B.F. Goodman M. Slightom J.L. Hess D.L. Jones R.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 439-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the developmental expression curves for human ε and galago γ in each line were nearly superimposed, suggesting that the two genes were coordinately silenced. In contrast, the human γ gene was not coordinately silenced with ε; rather, expression peaked in 14.5 day fetal livers and declined at 16.5 days. Although expression curves were somewhat variable in shape, considerable γ expression was still observed at 16.5 days, a pattern distinctly different than that seen for the galago γ gene. Examination of 10.5-day expression levels for all transgenes (Table I) reveals that in HS3-ε-humγ lines, γ gene expression was greater than ε gene expression (average 1.4-fold). This pattern (ε < γ) has been seen by others when larger constructs containing the human ε and γ genes were studied in the mouse (26Strouboulis J. Dillon N. Grosveld F. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1857-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 27Peterson K.R. Clegg C.H. Huxley C. Josephson B.M. Haugen H.S. Furukawa T. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7593-7597Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In contrast, in HS3-ε-galγ lines, human ε expression was greater than galago γ expression (3.3-, 6.4-, 35.7-, and 2.8-fold for the four lines). These data indicate that the characteristic embryonic expression pattern of the galago γ gene can be recapitulated in the transgenic mouse. It has also been demonstrated that globin genes from the chicken (28Mason M.M. Kee E. Westphal H. Reitman M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 407-414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and frog (29Dillon N. Kollias G. Grosveld F. Williams J.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6227-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) are expressed in the mouse background in temporal patterns similar to those expected on the basis of in vivo patterns. Together, these studies attest to the broad evolutionary conservation of cis and trans regulators of globin gene expression. The work presented here demonstrates that human and galago γ transgenes exhibit different developmental expression patterns when linked to the same portion of the LCR and when placed in the same microenvironment (mouse fetal liver). The divergent expression patterns of the two genes must therefore be due to differences in DNA sequence (cis elements) within the 4.0-kb fragment that contains the γ gene. Thus, fetal recruitment of the simian γ gene was (at least in part, see below) a cis-mediated event. Moreover, this result confirms that cis signals for stage-specific globin gene expression must reside near the genes, not within the LCR. Earlier studies of human transgene expression in the absence of LCR sequences also support this conclusion (30Starck J. Sarkar R. Romana M. Bhargava A. Scarpa A.L. Tanaka M. Chamberlain J.W. Weissman S.M. Forget B.G. Blood. 1994; 84: 1656-1665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The data also eliminate distance from the LCR as a determinantper se of the differences in stage-specific gene expression of these two genes (31Peterson K.R. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4836-4843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Hanscomb O. Whyatt D. Fraser P. Yannoutsos N. Greaves D. Dillon N. Grosveld F. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1387-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The physical distance between the γ gene(s) and the LCR in the intact β-like globin loci of human and galago differ significantly; the single galago γ gene is 13.5 kb from the 3′ end of the LCR (the HS1 core), whereas the human Gγ and Aγ genes are 21 and 26 kb away, respectively. In the constructs studied here, both γ genes were equidistant from HS3; however, their characteristic expression patterns were preserved. It is nevertheless possible that the increased distance of the duplicated human γ gene from the LCR may have played a permissive role in the initial evolution of a new fetal expression pattern (6Goodman M.

The conclusion that a fetal liver trans environment that is permissive for γ expression had already evolved prior to the mammalian radiation is supported by data presented here and elsewhere (24Li Q.

This does not imply that the mouse fetal liver environment is identical to that of the human; differences may exist in the relative balance of trans factors that would result in some distinct patterns of regulation in each species. Indeed, when the human γ gene is placed in the context of the entire β-like globin locus, it seems to be silenced at an earlier developmental time in the mouse fetal liver than in the human fetal liver (26Strouboulis J. Dillon N. Grosveld F. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1857-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 27Peterson K.R. Clegg C.H. Huxley C. Josephson B.M. Haugen H.S. Furukawa T. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7593-7597Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Regardless of these differences, the data presented here indicate clearly thatcis differences exist between galago and human γ genes that result in the generation of distinct patterns of expression in the fetal mouse liver; the galago γ gene is silenced, whereas human γ gene expression peaks in this stage. Interestingly, in several independent lines carrying the HS3-ε-galγ construct, the kinetics of galago γ and human ε gene silencing after embryonic life were nearly identical. Such coordinate regulation could be a consequence of lineage restriction. That is, both genes may be expressed at high levels only in yolk sac derived “primitive” erythrocytes and not in fetal liver-derived “definitive” erythrocytes. Whether there are actually two different stem cell lineages that contribute progeny to primitive and definitive lineages is still a matter of some debate, but recent identification of an intraembryonic source of long term repopulating hematopoietic cells suggests that this is likely (reviewed in Ref. 34Dzierzak E. Medvinsky A. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 359-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Coordinate regulation of human ε and galago γ genes could be achieved by the presence of silencers that act on both genes in definitive cells or by the absence of primitive activators in definitive cells. Alternatively, lineage specific changes in chromatin structure may explain the coordinate silencing of these two genes. The human γ gene but not the human ε or galago γ genes may contain elements that allow it to be expressed in the progressively heterochromatic environment of the definitive cell. In order for the simian γ gene to complete the transition from an exclusively embryonically expressed gene (the galago γ pattern) to a primarily fetally expressed gene (the human γ pattern), a second anthropoid-specific change is required: reduction of embryonic expression levels. This could have been accomplished by cis alterations that created binding site(s) for anthropoid-specific embryonic repressor(s) or by trans changes (loss of an embryonic activator of the γ gene specifically in anthropoid primates). Both scenarios imply that the trans environment of the mouse yolk sac must differ from that of the human and other anthropoid primates. Because γ globin gene expression has only been studied in relatively few anthropoid primates, it is possible that further analysis will reveal a species in which the γ gene is expressed at high levels in both embryonic and fetal life. The constructs described here should facilitate the identification of the specific cis sequence change(s) that mediated fetal γ expression, information that will likely reveal the molecular mechanisms responsible for acquisition of this new temporal expression domain. Several possible mechanisms exist, and a few candidatecis elements have already been identified. First, nucleotide changes could have resulted in the loss of fetal-specific repressor binding site(s) in the ancestral simian γ gene; a region near the proximal CCAAT box shows anthropoid-specific base changes that reduce the binding of a complex of putative fetal repressor proteins (35Gumucio D.L. Shelton D.A. Blanchard-McQuate K. Gray T. Tarle S. Heilstedt-Williamson H. Slightom J.L. Collins F. Goodman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15371-15380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, base changes could have generated simian-specific activator motif(s); anthropoid-specific changes in the −1086 region alter a YY1 binding site that appears to be important for the activation of γ in the fetal stage. 2W. Zhu, C. TomHon, N. Richards, D. Fairfield, and D. L. Gumucio, submitted for publication. Third, the gain of a binding site for a fetal stage selector protein (SSP; Ref. 36Jane S.M. Ney P.A. Vanin E.F. Gumucio D.L. Nienhuis A.W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2961-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) may have given the γ gene a competitive edge over the β gene in fetal life. In the −50 region of the human γ promoter, several anthropoid-specific nucleotides comprise a binding site for SSP; the SSP site is absent in the galago γ gene (36Jane S.M. Ney P.A. Vanin E.F. Gumucio D.L. Nienhuis A.W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2961-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Finally, fetal γ expression could have arisen via acquisition of a new interaction between the γ promoter and the LCR that is stable in the fetal stage. In this regard, it is of interest that in HS3-ε-galγ lines, ε>γ and the two genes are coordinately silenced, but in HS3-ε-humγ lines, γ > ε and silencing is not coordinate. Establishment of a strong LCR contact that is stable in fetal life would not only accomplish the fetal recruitment of γ but could conceivably force a delay in the expression of β via competitive mechanisms. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that the galago β gene is activated in early fetal life, whereas human β gene activation occurs at birth (5Tagle D.A. Koop B.F. Goodman M. Slightom J.L. Hess D.L. Jones R.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 439-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Identification of the exactcis sequences that mediated the different expression patterns of the γ genes observed in this study is likely to further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that control the evolution of novel stage-specific expression domains as well as the regulation of hemoglobin switching.

https://openalex.org/W2330794195,"An increasing number of reports shows a link between the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and lymphoid neoplasia. The latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is likely to play a determinant role in this process since this EBV encoded protein has oncogenic properties and is usually expressed in EBV-associated lymphoproliferative diseases (LPD), except Burkitt's lymphoma. We previously identified in LPD patients mutational hot spots and a 30 bp or 69 bp deletion in the LMP1 gene region coding for the C-terminal domain. These deletions are located in an area shown to be important for the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB. These findings lead us to test whether these natural deletion variants may have a functional effect. We measured the stimulation of their activity using a luciferase reporter plasmid containing NF-κB responsive elements. We tested the NF-κB inducing activity of four naturally occurring LMP1 deletion variants. Our results show that these deletion variants activate NF-κB to the same level as the wild-type form, indicating that the crucial residues for NF-κB activation are conserved among the variants isolated and lie within the last 32 amino acids of the C-terminal domain of the LMP1 oncogene."

https://openalex.org/W2033423858,"DNA damage is recognized as a central component of carcinogenesis. DNA-damaging agents activate a number of signal transduction pathways that lead to repair of the DNA, apoptosis, or cell cycle arrest. It is reasoned that a cell deficient in DNA repair is more likely to acquire other cancer-promoting mutations. Despite the recent interest in the link between DNA damage and carcinogenesis, retroviral oncogenes have not yet been shown to affect the DNA damage-signaling pathway. In this report, we show that Finkel-Biskis-Reilly mouse osteosarcoma virus (FBR) v-fos, the retroviral homologue of the c-fos proto-oncogene, inhibits the cellular response to ionizing radiation. Cells that express FBR v-Fos show a decreased ability to repair DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation, and these cells show decreased survival in response to ionizing radiation. In addition, FBR v-Fos inhibits DNA-dependent protein kinase, a kinase specifically activated upon exposure to ionizing radiation. These effects were specific to ionizing radiation, as no effect of FBR v-Fos on the UV light signaling pathway was seen. Last, these effects were dependent on a lipid modification required for FBR v-Fos tumorigenesis, that of myristoylation of FBR v-Fos. A non-myristoylated mutant FBR v-Fos caused none of these effects. This study suggests that a retroviral oncogene can lead to an increased genomic instability, which can ultimately increase the carcinogenic potential of a cell.

A non-myristoylated mutant FBR v-Fos caused none of these effects. This study suggests that a retroviral oncogene can lead to an increased genomic instability, which can ultimately increase the carcinogenic potential of a cell. A hallmark of neoplasms is the loss of genomic integrity (1White A.E. Livanos E.M. Tlsty T.D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 666-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Since cancer arises from a stepwise progression of mutations in DNA, a loss in genomic integrity increases the likelihood of acquiring cancer promoting mutations. This is highlighted in hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer in which cancer cells have a mutator phenotype caused by a defect in DNA mismatch repair (2Fishel R. Lescoe M.K. Rao M.R. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Garber J. Kane M. Kolodner R. Cell. 1993; 75: 1027-1028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2603) Google Scholar, 3Leach F.S. Nicolaides N.C. Papadopoulous N. Liu B. Jen J.

In addition, the human papilloma virus oncoproteins, E6 and E7, have been shown to cause the cell to lose its cell cycle checkpoint controls, ultimately leading to genomic instability (1White A.E. Livanos E.M. Tlsty T.D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 666-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Despite the heightened interest in the link between genomic instability, DNA repair, and cancer, the only retroviral oncogene that has been shown to affect DNA repair is the HTLV-I tax protein (4Jeang K.T. Widen S.G. Semmes O.J., IV Wilson S.H. Science. 1990; 247: 1082-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In this paper, we show that FBR 1The abbreviations used are: FBR, Finkel-Biskis-Reilly mouse osteosarcoma virus; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; neo R, neomycin resistance gene; DNA-PK, DNA-dependent protein kinase; Gy, gray. v-Fos, the retroviral homologue of the c-fos proto-oncogene, can inhibit cellular signaling and DNA repair in response to ionizing radiation. Previously our laboratory has been interested in the mechanism by which FBR v-Fos causes transformation. FBR v-fos differs from c-fos both by an N-terminal viral gag sequence and a C-terminal mouse c-Fox sequence (5Curran T. Verma I.M. Virology. 1984; 135: 218-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). FBR v-Fos heterodimerizes with c-Jun, but displays a loss of function at AP-1 sites (6Kamata N. Jotte R.M. Holt J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 7Kamata N. Holt J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 876-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This loss of function can be mapped to the myristoylation of FBR v-Fos. When the myristoylation site is mutated (G2A v-Fos), the non-myristoylated G2A v-Fos regains the ability to transactivate AP-1 sites (6Kamata N. Jotte R.M. Holt J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cellular transformation is not affected by FBR v-Fos' myristoylation, but myristoylation of FBR v-Fos increases its carcinogenic potentialin vivo. Transgenic mice that express G2A v-Fos only develop lipomas, while mice that express FBR v-Fos develop a wide range of mesenchymal tumors, including rhabdomyosarcomas, liposarcomas, chondrosarcomas, and osteosarcomas (8Jotte R.M. Holt J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 457-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which FBR v-Fos causes this increased carcinogenesis is unclear. In addition to its function in AP-1 transactivation, c-Fos has also been shown to be an integral component of the cell's stress response (9Schreiber M. Baumann B. Cotten M. Angel P. Wagner E.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5338-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Since DNA damage has been shown to be an essential component of carcinogenesis, we hypothesized that FBR v-Fos might cause a generalized defect in the stress response and DNA repair. In this paper, we show that FBR v-Fos causes a decreased capacity to repair double-strand DNA breaks caused by ionizing radiation, but it does not cause a decreased capacity to repair DNA damage caused by UV radiation. We show that cells that express FBR v-Fos show decreased survival in response to ionizing radiation, but normal survival when exposed to UV radiation. In addition, FBR v-Fos expression causes decreased activity of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), a kinase specifically activated by ionizing radiation. Last, all of these effects are dependent on the myristoylation of FBR v-Fos as cells that express G2A v-Fos do not show any of these effects. These data imply that while both FBR v-Fos and G2A v-Fos cause efficient transformation, only FBR v-Fos leads to a genomic instability, which increases a cell's carcinogenic potential. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma), 2 mm l-glutamine (Sigma) and 1% antimycotic/antibiotic (Sigma). Stably transfected cell lines were created by calcium phosphate precipitation with 18 μg of FBR v-Fos or G2A v-Fos and 2 μg of RSV-neo (for RSV-neo only stable cell lines, 2 μg of RSV-neo and 18 μg of pGEM-4Z was used). Cells were then selected for 14 days in medium containing 300 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Approximately 500–1000 clones were pooled and shown to express FBR v-Fos or G2A v-Fos by radioimmunoprecipitation and Western blotting. DNA repair CAT assays were performed as described previously (9Schreiber M. Baumann B. Cotten M. Angel P. Wagner E.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5338-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 10Klocker H. Schneider R. Burtscher H.J. Auer B. Hirsch-Kauffmann M. Schweiger M. Eur. J. Cell.

Briefly, SV40-CAT was damaged by UV radiation (0, 100, 250, and 400 J/m2 (emission peak: 254 nm, Stratagene)) or by ionizing radiation (0, 3, 7, 15 Gy (137Cs, 2 Gy/0.7 min)). Activity of these constructs was assayed 12 h later. At 12 h, DNA repair has not taken place, so the activity of the construct is directly related to the amount of DNA damage that has been sustained (9Schreiber M. Baumann B. Cotten M. Angel P. Wagner E.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5338-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 10Klocker H. Schneider R. Burtscher H.J. Auer B. Hirsch-Kauffmann M. Schweiger M. Eur. J. Cell.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 509-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). 12 h after transfection, cell lysis was performed by four alternating cycles of freezing and thawing. Transfection efficiency was then standardized by equal expression of β-galactosidase via methods described previously (12Kerr L.D. Holt J.T. Matrisian L. Science. 1988; 242: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Following standardization, CAT activity was measured as described previously (13Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5294) Google Scholar). The TLC plate was developed by autoradiography, and counts were measured by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). 400 J/m2 and 15 Gy were judged to be the optimal doses of DNA-damaging agent. These plasmids were then assayed at 48 h after transfection (a time at which DNA repair has taken place) to assay for these constructs' ability to be repaired. CAT activity was indistinguishable between irradiated DNA and unirradiated DNA at 48 h. Cells were transfected with these constructs and 5 μg of FBR v-Fos or G2A v-Fos, and CAT activity was assayed 48 h after transfection as described above. Activities were standardized to unirradiated construct alone + expression vector. For instance, FBR v-Fos' effect on repair was determined by standardizing FBR v-Fos + irradiated reporter to FBR v-Fos + unirradiated reporter. Cells were transfected with 5 or 10 μg of c-Fos, FBR v-Fos, or G2A v-Fos expression vector. 48 h later, the cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in Buffer P (10 mmHEPES (pH 7.2), 25 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1.1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA). Cells were set on ice for 5 min and then centrifuged at 14 K for 10 min to obtain soluble lysate. Soluble lysate was allowed to sit on ice for 30 min to allow all proteins to mix. Transfection efficiency was standardized by β-galactosidase assay, and protein concentration was standardized by Bio-Rad protein assay. Cell extract was added to a peptide corresponding to the consensus DNA-PK phosphorylation site in p53 (PESQEAFADLWKK) as described previously (14Lees-Miller S.P. Sakaguichi S.P.K. Ullrich S. Appella E. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5041-5409Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). [γ-32P]ATP was added in 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 70 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.25 mm ATP to a total volume of 40 μl. Double-stranded calf thymus (10 μg/ml) DNA was added to one tube, while a second reaction was run in parallel without DNA added. After 30 min at 30 °C, the DNA-PK mixture was applied to Whatman No. 3MM paper, washed extensively, allowed to air dry, and scintillation counts were then measured. Specific activity was determined by the following method. Cell irradiation was performed as described previously (15Smider V. Rathmell W.K. Lieber M.R. Chu G. Science. 1994; 266: 288-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 16Taccioli G.E. Gottlieb T.M. Blunt T. Priestly A. Demengeot J. Mizuta R. Lehmann A.R. Alt F.W. Jackson S.P. Jeggo P.A. Science. 1994; 265: 1442-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated at 200 cells/dish and irradiated at the given dose. For UV irradiation, medium was removed before irradiation. The same medium was then added to the dish immediately following irradiation. Cells were then cultured for 10 days. They were stained with Giemsa and colonies were counted. Relative survival was determined by comparing cell survival of cells irradiated at a given does to unirradiated cells plated at the same density and cultured for the same amount of time. Since the cellular proto-oncogene c-fos has been shown to be an integral component of a cell's stress response (9Schreiber M. Baumann B. Cotten M. Angel P. Wagner E.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5338-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and since the stress response is tightly linked to DNA repair and cancer (2Fishel R. Lescoe M.K. Rao M.R. Copeland N.G.

Parsons R. et al.Cell. 1993; 75: 1215-1225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that FBR v-Fos could cause a defect in DNA repair. To test this hypothesis, DNA repair assays were performed (9Schreiber M. Baumann B. Cotten M. Angel P. Wagner E.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5338-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 10Klocker H.

Wagner E.F. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 509-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar) using either UV light or ionizing radiation as the insulting agent. UV light causes nicks in DNA, while ionizing radiation causes double-strand DNA breaks. SV40-CAT was damaged with the two sources at various doses, and damage was titrated to obtain the optimal amount. Expression was measured 12 h after transfection. At 12 h, DNA repair has not occurred, so a lack of signal represents unrepaired CAT DNA (9Schreiber M. Baumann B. Cotten M. Angel P. Wagner E.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5338-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 10Klocker H. Schneider R. Burtscher H.J. Auer B. Hirsch-Kauffmann M. Schweiger M. Eur. J. Cell.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 509-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). 400 J/m2 for UV-treated CAT and 15 Gy for x-ray-treated CAT were judged to be the optimal amounts of damage (Fig.1 A). Assays performed with these plasmids 12 h after transfection showed significant DNA damage (CAT activity = 85% reduction (UV) and 69% reduction (x-ray) from unirradiated SV40-CAT, respectively). Both of these damaged plasmids were able to be repaired effectively as activity of the damaged plasmids matched the activity of the undamaged plasmids 48 h after transfection, a time at which DNA repair has occurred (control, Figs.1, C and D). To assess the effects of FBR v-Fos on nicked DNA and double-strand breaks, FBR v-Fos or G2A v-Fos were co-transfected into HeLa cells with the damaged reporter plasmids. CAT assays were performed 48 h after transfection, and activity was standardized to control for the effect of FBR v-Fos or G2A v-Fos on the reporter plasmid. A representative CAT assay is shown in Fig. 1 B. When FBR v-Fos was co-transfected with 15 Gy-treated reporter, repair of the reporter plasmid was significantly impaired (Fig. 1 C). This result is even more dramatic when it is considered that unrepaired reporter (12-h time point, Fig. 1 A) had ∼30% residual activity (residual activity is shown as a solid line in Fig. 1 C). In contrast, G2A v-Fos did not impair reporter function (Fig. 1,B and C), indicating that FBR v-Fos' myristoylation plays a significant role in its inhibition of DNA repair. These results were specific to DNA treated with ionizing radiation. When the same assay was performed with reporter plasmid treated with 400 J/m2 UV, there was no significant difference between reporter plasmid co-transfected with FBR v-Fos or G2A v-Fos (Fig. 1 D) despite higher amounts of damage to the 400 J/m2-treated reporter (Fig. 1, A andsolid line in E). Thus, FBR v-Fos' effect on DNA repair is specific to double-strand-break repair. Since FBR v-Fos causes a defect in a cell's ability to repair double-strand DNA breaks, we were interested in determining whether FBR v-Fos affected the repair process itself or if FBR v-Fos affected the signaling pathway that leads to repair of double strand DNA breaks. To delineate between these possibilities, we made use of a kinase that becomes activated in response to ionizing radiation. DNA-PK activity has been shown to increase when the cell is exposed to ionizing radiation. Upon activation, DNA-PK has been shown to phosphorylate p53, SP-1, c-Jun, Oct-1, and RNA polymerase II (reviewed in Ref. 21Anderson C.W. Carter T.H. Molecular Analysis of DNA Rearrangements in the Immune System. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1996: 91-112Google Scholar). Cells that lack DNA-PK are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation, and these cells cannot undergo VDJ recombination (a process requiring the resolution of double-strand DNA breaks) (15Smider V.

On the other hand, if DNA-PK was unaffected by FBR v-Fos, this would indicate that FBR v-Fos affected the repair machinery directly. To test this, FBR v-Fos, c-Fos, or G2A v-Fos were transfected into HeLa cells. 48 h after transfection, whole cell lysates were prepared. Protein concentration and transfection efficiency were standardized. Our transfection efficiency was approximately 10%, and given this transfection efficiency, we would expect to see a result in only 10% of the cells. To correct for this, after cell lysis we allowed the cells to sit on ice for 30 min. This allowed the recombinantly overexpressed FBR v-Fos equal access to all cellular proteins in the lysate. DNA-PK activity was then measured (14Lees-Miller S.P. Sakaguichi S.P.K. Ullrich S. Appella E. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5041-5409Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Reactions were run in the presence and absence of DNA to isolate DNA-dependent kinase activity (described under “Materials and Methods”). Neither c-Fos nor G2A v-Fos affected endogenous DNA-PK activity (Fig.2 A). In contrast, FBR v-Fos caused a 5-fold decrease in DNA-PK activity (Fig. 2 A). Next, HeLa cell lines, which stably expressed RSV-neo, G2A v-Fos, or FBR v-Fos, were constructed. Briefly, cells were transfected with either FBR v-Fos or G2A v-Fos and the neo R gene in a 9:1 ratio. 500–1000 clones from each respective cell line were pooled. A control cell line containing only neo R was also constructed (RSV-neo cells) The FBR v-Fos and G2A v-Fos stable cell lines expressed the 75-kDa FBR v-Fos or G2A v-Fos protein, and neither of these proteins were present in the RSV-neo only stable cell lines (data not shown). DNA-PK activity was measured in these cell lines. Again, FBR v-Fos causes a significant decrease in DNA-PK activity, and this decrease is again dependent on FBR v-Fos' myristoylation (Fig.2 B). To assess the in vivo effect of FBR v-Fos' on double-strand break repair, the stable cell lines expressing RSV-neo, FBR v-Fos, and G2A v-Fos were utilized. FBR v-Fos, G2A v-Fos, and RSV-neo cell lines were plated at equal cell densities and exposed to various doses of irradiation from a 137Cs source or a UV source. Colonies were allowed to grow for 10 days before they were stained and counted. Because we were concerned about the effects that expression of a viral oncogene would have on normal cell growth, FBR v-Fos, G2A v-Fos, and RSV-neo cells' growth were measured relative to themselves. For example, at a given radiation dose, FBR v-Fos cells' survival was measured relative to an unirradiated plate of FBR v-Fos cells plated at the same density and grown for the same amount of time. In response to ionizing radiation, RSV-neo cells show a decrease in cell survival as the radiation dose increases (Fig.3 A), but this decrease is small, indicating that HeLa cells can survive exposure to ionizing radiation. Relative to RSV-neo cells, FBR v-Fos cells show a significant decrease in cell survival at all doses of ionizing radiation (Fig. 3 A). G2A v-Fos-expressing cells retain wild-type sensitivity to radiation (Fig. 3 A), so FBR v-Fos' effect on cell survival is myristoylation-dependent. In contrast to the results seen with ionizing radiation, these cells show no differences in response to UV light (Fig. 3 B). Even at doses that cause 90% lethality, no difference in survival is seen. These data support the findings seen with the damaged CAT reporter plasmid and the DNA-PK activity inhibition. FBR v-Fos' effect is specific to ionizing radiation, the process in which DNA-PK has been implicated as performing a critical function. A cell responds to exposure to ionizing radiation by activating a variety of integrating signaling pathways. To varying extents, DNA-PK (reviewed in Ref. 21Anderson C.W. Carter T.H.

Clin. Invest. 1992; 88: 691-695Crossref Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Despite the increasing knowledge of a cell's response to ionizing radiation, no oncogenes have yet been shown to affect this signal transduction network. In this work, we have analyzed the effect of the retroviral oncogene, FBR v-fos, on this pathway. We have found that cells that express FBR v-Fos show a decreased capacity to repair double-strand DNA breaks (Fig. 1). These cells show decreased DNA-PK activity (Fig. 2), and they show a decreased ability to survive exposure to ionizing radiation (Fig. 3). These data imply that FBR v-Fos could be causing a genomic instability in cells in which it is expressed. This could in turn lead to a mutator phenotype, making it more likely that a cell which expresses FBR v-Fos becomes carcinogenic. FBR v-Fos' role in cancer has been a mystery. It was originally isolated by virtue of its ability to increase the frequency of bone cancers in mice exposed to ionizing radiation (31Finkel M.P. Reilly Jr., C.A. Biskis B.O. Front. Radiat. Ther. Oncol. 1975; 10: 28-39Crossref Google Scholar). Upon discovery of c-Fos and c-Fos' role in AP-1 transactivation, it was assumed that FBR v-Fos mimicked c-Fos' transactivation of AP-1. This was shown not to be true, however, as AP-1 activity has been shown to be neither necessary (6Kamata N. Jotte R.M. Holt J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 7Kamata N. Holt J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 876-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 8Jotte R.M. Holt J.T. J.

New Biol. 1991; 3: 671-677PubMed Google Scholar) for transformation by Fos. Despite the fact that FBR v-Fos and G2A v-Fos transform tissue culture cells at an equal frequency (8Jotte R.M. Holt J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 457-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), in vivo, only FBR v-Fos leads to a variety of malignant cancers that ultimately kill the animal (8Jotte R.M. Holt J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 457-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Due to the differences in FBR v-Fos' and G2A v-Fos' effects on carcinogenesis and transformation, we favor a two-step model of carcinogenesis by FBR v-Fos. First, transformation must occur. Only the Fos sequences present in both of FBR v-Fos and G2A v-Fos are needed for transformation (8Jotte R.M. Holt J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 457-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 34Funk M. Poensgen B. Graulich W. Jerome V. Muller R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), so both G2A v-Fos and FBR v-Fos satisfy this requirement for carcinogenesis. The second step for carcinogenesis is one of genomic instability. An unstable genome allows the cell to obtain a variety of mutations in a short amount of time. This would increase the likelihood of a cell acquiring even more cancer-promoting mutations. Since cells that express FBR v-Fos show decreased ability to repair damaged DNA, and cells that express G2A v-Fos show no defect in DNA repair, only FBR v-Fos satisfies the second requirement. These findings support the observation that both FBR v-Fos and G2A v-Fos can cause transformation in vitro, but only FBR v-Fos causes cancer in vivo (8Jotte R.M. Holt J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 457-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The precise role by which FBR v-Fos causes this effect on the cell's response to ionizing radiation is unclear. FBR v-Fos could be acting as a transcriptional repressor, inhibiting the expression of a gene that is crucial to the x-ray response. FBR v-Fos could also act as a transcriptional activator to increase expression of a gene that antagonizes the x-ray response. Last, FBR v-Fos could have a growth stimulatory effect, pushing the cell through its cell cycle in the face of x-ray-induced DNA damage. Future experiments will help to define FBR v-Fos' role in the ionizing radiation signaling pathway."

The reaction between HCII and thrombin is quite unique, because it involves an unusual HCII-reactive site loop sequence of Leu444-Ser445, requires the presence of glycosaminoglycans for optimal activity and involves a protein-protein interaction besides the reactive site loop-active site interaction characteristic of serine proteinase inhibitor-serine proteinase pairs. Two mutations at a unique HCII residue, Arg200 → Ala or Glu, were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutations did not alter either HCII binding to heparin-Sepharose or HCII inhibition of thrombin in the presence of heparin or dermatan sulfate, suggesting that Arg200 is not part of the glycosaminoglycan binding site of HCII. In the absence of glycosaminoglycan, there was a significant increase in α-thrombin inhibition by the Arg200 mutants as compared with wild type recombinant HCII (wt-rHCII), whereas inhibition rates with chymotrypsin were identical. Inhibition of γT-thrombin, which lacks anion-binding exosite 1 ((ABE-1), the region of α-thrombin that interacts with the acidic domain of HCII), was significantly reduced compared with α-thrombin, but the reduction was more dramatic for the Arg200-rHCII mutants. Hirugen, which binds to ABE-1 of α-thrombin, also diminished inhibition of α-thrombin by the Arg200-rHCII mutants to nearly wt-rHCII levels. Both Arg200-rHCII mutants had significantly increasedka values as compared with wt-rHCII, whereas thekd rates were unchanged. Collectively, these results suggest that the improved inhibitory activity of the Arg200-rHCII mutants is mediated by enhanced interactions between the acidic domain and ABE-1, resulting in an increased HCII-thrombin association rate.

Heparin cofactor II (HCII) belongs to a subfamily of serpins whose activity is greatly accelerated upon binding to glycosaminoglycans, such as heparin, heparan sulfate, and dermatan sulfate (4Tollefsen D.M.

The physiological target of HCII is presumed to be thrombin, a pluripotent coagulation proteinase that participates in inflammation and wound healing processes based on its chemotactic, mitogenic, and cytokine-like action on vascular smooth muscle cells, monocytes, and fibroblasts (9Bar-Shavit R. Kahn A. Wilner G.D. Fenton J.W., II Science. 1983; 220: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 10Bar-Shavit R. Kahn A.J. Mann K.G. Wilner G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thrombin activity generated during blood coagulation is regulated primarily by antithrombin, a heparin-binding serpin that inhibits most coagulation proteinases. However, extravascular thrombin activity associated with inflammation and wound healing processes is thought to be regulated by HCII, which exhibits remarkable specificity for thrombin (13Church F.C.

HCII is the only heparin-binding serpin that binds dermatan sulfate to accelerate thrombin inhibition (15Tollefsen D.M. Pestka C.A. Monafo W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6713-6716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The heparin and dermatan sulfate binding sites, which are distinct but overlapping, are localized primarily in the D-helix region (16Whinna H.C. Blinder M.A. Szewczyk M. Tollefsen D.M. Church F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8129-8135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Blinder M.A. Andersson T.R. Abildgaard U. Tollefsen D.M. J. Biol.

Ulshofer T. Gerewitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5211-5218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HCII is also unique because it has Leu444 at the P1 position, whereas most thrombin-inhibiting serpins (like antithrombin and protein C inhibitor) and typical thrombin substrates contain an Arg at the P1 site (20Griffith M.J. Noyes C.M. Tyndall J.A. Church F.C. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6777-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 21Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). The P1 residue, which is located on an exposed loop that interacts with the active site of the proteinase, determines in large part the proteinase specificity of the serpin (for a review, see Ref. 3Potempa J. Korzus E. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15957-15960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of a P1 Leu in HCII enables it to inhibit chymotrypsin, a nonphysiological target, more rapidly than thrombin in the absence of glycosaminoglycans (22Church F.C. Noyes C.M. Griffith M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6431-6434Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). HCII with an Arg substituted for the P1 Leu no longer inhibits chymotrypsin (23Derechin V.M. Blinder M.A. Tollefsen D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5623-5628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, this mutant has an increased thrombin inhibition rate in the absence of glycosaminoglycans, but is also proteolytically inactivated by thrombin in the presence of heparin (23Derechin V.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 888-893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Although HCII is ∼30% identical in primary structure to antithrombin and other serpins (25Tollefsen D.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 1209-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), it has an unusual amino-terminal extension of approximately 80 residues (26Blinder M.A. Marasa J.C. Reynolds C.H. Deaven L.L. Tollefsen D.M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 752-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 27Hortin G. Tollefsen D.M. Strauss A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15827-15830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amino terminus contains a tandem repeat of two acidic stretches that are somewhat homologous to the carboxyl terminus of the leech thrombin inhibitor, hirudin (28Dodt J. Muller H.P. Seemuller V. Chang J.Y. FEBS Lett. 1984; 165: 180-183Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The acidic domains of both HCII and hirudin bind to anion-binding exosite-1 (ABE-1) of thrombin (29Skrzypczak-Jankun E. Carperos V.E. Ravichandran K.G. Tulinsky A. Westbrook M. Maraganore J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 1379-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The acidic domain of HCII is also thought to bind intramolecularly to the D-helix, the glycosaminoglycan binding site on HCII. Binding of glycosaminoglycans to the D-helix is thought to displace the acidic domain and promote its interaction with ABE-1 of thrombin (30Van Deerlin V.M.D. Tollefsen D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20223-20231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Ragg H. Ulshofer T. Gerewitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22386-22391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The acidic domain interaction with ABE-1 appears to be the driving force for the rapid inhibition of thrombin by HCII in the presence of glycosaminoglycans and compensates for the unfavorable P1 Leu residue (19Ragg H. Ulshofer T. Gerewitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5211-5218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Van Deerlin V.M.D. Tollefsen D.M. J. Biol.

We are studying HCII to better understand the role of specific amino acid residues in this unique thrombin inhibition reaction. A comparison of serpin sequences shows that HCII is the only heparin-binding serpin with a basic residue at Arg200 (2Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Arg200 of HCII is in strand 2 of β sheet A, adjacent to the dermatan sulfate-binding region of the D-helix; thus it may be poised to play a unique role in regulating HCII activity. In this study, we have found that Arg200 promotes the interaction of the acidic domain with HCII in the absence of glycosaminoglycans, but is not involved in glycosaminoglycan binding. We propose that the function of Arg200 is to keep HCII essentially “inactive” when it is circulating in the blood stream unbound to glycosaminoglycans. Human wild type recombinant HCII (wt-rHCII) (cDNA kindly provided by Dr. Douglas M. Tollefsen, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO) was previously expressed in the baculovirus expression system and characterized (33Ciaccia A.V. Cunningham E.L. Church F.C. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 806-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To generate R200A-rHCII and R200E-rHCII, site-directed mutagenesis was performed by the method of Kunkel on full-length human HCII cDNA subcloned via flanking Eco RI sites into the pBluescript SK+ mutagenesis and cloning vector (Stratagene) (34Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). A degenerate oligonucleotide was used to introduce two point mutations in the HCII cDNA (683CGG → GCG or GAG), which caused substitutions of Ala or Glu, respectively, at residue Arg200. The mutations were identified by DNA sequencing (Sequenase® Version 2.0, U. S. Biochemical Corp.), and positive clones were sequenced in full to verify the absence of erroneously introduced mutations. Subcloning into baculoviral transfer vector pVL1392 (PharMingen) and cotransfection with linearized BaculoGold™ (PharMingen) Autographica californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9, Invitrogen) insect cells was performed as described previously (33Ciaccia A.V. Cunningham E.L. Church F.C. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 806-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The infectious medium was collected 4 days post-transfection and was further amplified in freshSf9 cells. Production of rHCII was verified by immunoblot analysis of whole cell lysates from infected cells. Sf9 cells were maintained in spinner flasks in Grace's medium (JRH Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), 0.3 g/liter l-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (Life Technologies, Inc.). High-Five™ insect cells (Invitrogen) grown at 27 °C in serum free ExCell 401™ medium with l-glutamine (JRH Scientific) were used to express rHCII. Two T150 flasks of High-Five™ cells were infected with viral stock (150 μl/flask), and the cell supernatant was collected after 2 days and centrifuged at 350 × g for 5 min to remove cell debris. The medium was diluted with an equal volume of HPN buffer, pH 6.5 (20 mm HEPES (Boehringer Mannheim), 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000 (Sigma), 0.05% NaN3) and batch-adsorbed with 0.5 ml of heparin-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for 1 h at 4 °C. rHCII was eluted from the heparin-Sepharose with 0.5 m NaCl in HPN buffer, pH 7.4, after two washes in 75 mm NaCl in HPN, pH 6.5, buffer. The heparin-Sepharose eluate was diluted in HPN buffer to a final concentration of 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.8, and batch-adsorbed with 0.5 ml of Q-Sepharose (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. After two washes in 50 mm NaCl, the protein was eluted with 0.5m NaCl in HPN, pH 7.8, buffer, aliquoted, and stored at −70 °C. A direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a mouse anti-HCII monoclonal antibody and a goat IgG-conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) was used as described previously to measure rHCII concentrations (33Ciaccia A.V. Cunningham E.L. Church F.C. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 806-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Human plasma HCII, purified as described previously (35Griffith M.J. Noyes C.M. Church F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2218-2225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used for the standard curve. Assays were performed in 96-well microtiter plates and color development was monitored at 405 nm on a Vmaxmicroplate reader (Molecular Devices). The relative affinity of wt-rHCII and the R200-rHCII mutants for immobilized heparin was determined by fast protein liquid chromatography using a Pharmacia Biotech Inc. system and a 1-ml heparin-Sepharose column. The samples were dialyzed into 20 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% polyethylene glycol, pH 7.4, loaded onto the column with dialysis buffer, and eluted with a linear 1.0 ml/min salt gradient of 50 mm to 0.5 m NaCl. 1.0 μg of recombinant HCII was loaded, and 20 × 1-ml fractions were collected. The fractions were analyzed by thrombin inhibition assays in the presence of 10 μg/ml heparin, as described below. Human α-thrombin was isolated and prepared as described previously (36Church F.C. Whinna H.C. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 157: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and bovine chymotrypsin was purchased from Sigma. γT-Thrombin was prepared by limited proteolysis of plasma-derived α-thrombin withl-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Cooper Biomedical) [(37) as modified in (32Rogers S.J. Pratt C.W. Whinna H.C. Church F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3613-3617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)]. The activity of γT-thrombin was then verified by chromogenic substrate cleavage and fibrin clotting assays. Chromogenic substrates were tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-ρ-nitroanilide (150 μm; Boehringer Mannheim) for thrombin andN-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-ρ-nitroanilide (500 μm; Sigma) for chymotrypsin. Hirugen (residues 53–64) was from Multiple Peptide Systems. A control peptide corresponding to the reverse sequence of the HCII acidic domain (residues 47–61) was synthesized on a Synergy™ peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems). Proteinase inhibition assays for wt-rHCII and the R200-rHCII mutants were performed in 96-well enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates (previously coated with 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) at room temperature in HNPN, pH 7.4, buffer containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. In the absence of glycosaminoglycan, 100 nm HCII and 1 nm thrombin were incubated together for 30–180 min in the presence of 50 μg/ml polybrene. The thrombin-HCII association time was 90 min for assays performed in the presence of hirugen. For the heparin (Diosynth, Oss, The Netherlands) and dermatan sulfate (Calbiochem; nitrous acid-treated to remove contaminating heparin and heparan sulfate) template curves, 5 nm HCII, and 0.5 nm thrombin were incubated together for 20 s. The reactions were quenched by the addition of a chromogenic substrate solution containing 3 mg/ml polybrene, and color development was monitored at 405 nm on a Vmax microplate reader. Second order inhibition rate constants (k2,m−1 min−1) were measured in triplicate on two to four different preparations of rHCII. The rates were obtained under pseudo-first order reaction conditions as described previously and were calculated using the equationk2 = (−ln a)/t [I], where a is the residual proteinase activity, t is the time, and [I] is the HCII concentration (38Whinna H.C. Church F.C. J. Protein Chem. 1993; 12: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Slow binding kinetic assays were performed in 96-well bovine serum albumin-coated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates at room temperature in HNPN, pH 7.4, buffer containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. A low-evaporation lid coated with anti-fogging agent (Molecular Devices) was used to minimize evaporation. Chromogenic substrate was S-2266 (d-Val-Leu-Arg-ρ-nitroanilide; Kabi Pharmacia). S-2266 was selected from several chromogenic substrates tested because its high Km (262 μm; Ref. 39Hermans J.M. Stone S.R. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) permitted adequate inhibition of thrombin by HCII under the experimental conditions. Color development was monitored as described above. The reaction was started by the addition of 0.5 nm thrombin to wells containing varying concentrations of HCII (25–400 μm range) and 500 μm S-2266, and readings were taken at 10-min intervals for 8 h. Data points were excluded from the analysis when the level of substrate utilization exceeded 10%. Control assays indicated that the thrombin was stable during the course of the experiment. The competition between substrate and inhibitor for thrombin can be described by the following scheme (39Hermans J.M. Stone S.R. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).E+S⇌KmESRcat¯E+P+IRd↑↓RaEI where E, S, P, and I represent the enzyme (thrombin), substrate (d-Val-Leu-Arg-ρ-nitroanilide), product (ρ-nitroaniline), and inhibitor (HCII), respectively.Km and kcat are the Michaelis and catalytic constants for the enzyme-substrate reaction, respectively, and ka and kd are the association and dissociation rate constants for the thrombin-HCII reaction. This kinetic scheme assumes reversible binding, which the HCII-thrombin interaction appears to follow under the conditions established in this assay, since vs was significant at all concentrations of serpins. The progress curve of product formation for this mechanism is given by Equation 1(40Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar),P=vst+[(vo−vs)/R'](1−e−R't)Equation 1 where P is the amount of product at time t,k′ is an apparent first-order rate constant, andvo and vs are the initial and steady-state velocities, respectively. A plot of k′versus inhibitor concentration (Equation 2) yields a slope equal to k′a, the apparent association rate, and ay intercept equal to kd (39Hermans J.M. Stone S.R. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).R'=Rd+R'a.IEquation 2 The k′a is related to the true rate constant by Equation 3.Ra=R'a(1+(S/Km))Equation 3 vo was determined from a linear fit to the first 10 measurements of the thrombin alone control for each row on the microplate, and this value was then used in Equation 1. The data from the progress curves were fitted to Equation 1 by nonlinear regression using software written for SlideWrite. The values fork′ at each HCII concentration were then used to determinek′a and kd by a linear fit of the data to Equation 2. The true ka was then determined from Equation 3. R200A-rHCII and R200E-rHCII were engineered, expressed, and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The protein yield from a typical preparation was essentially the same as for wt-rHCII (50–100 μg purified from two T150 flasks). Immunoblot analysis and SDS-PAGE demonstrated the mutants had the same electrophoretic mobility as wt-rHCII (data not show). Gradient salt elution from heparin-Sepharose was performed to determine whether the mutations altered the apparent affinity of HCII for immobilized heparin. Since the intermolecular interactions between heparin and HCII are thought to be primarily ionic, the concentration of NaCl required to elute the proteins is a measure of their relative affinity (41Pratt C.W. Whinna H.C. Church F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8795-8801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There were no significant differences in the NaCl concentrations (mm) required to elute the proteins: 270 ± 40 for wt-rHCII (n = 3), 260 ± 20 for R200A-rHCII (n = 4), and 270 ± 40 for R200E-rHCII (n = 3). The Arg200 mutants were assayed for their ability to inhibit thrombin in the presence of glycosaminoglycans. Fig. 1shows that both HCII mutants exhibited typical bell-shaped curves for inhibition of α-thrombin in the presence of increasing concentrations of heparin or dermatan sulfate. While the optimal heparin concentration is about 2-fold higher for the Arg200 mutants (500 μg/ml) as compared with wt-rHCII (200 μg/ml) (Fig. 1A), the second order inhibition rate constants (k2,m−1 min−1) are not significantly different (see Table I). Likewise, dermatan sulfate-accelerated thrombin inhibition was identical for wt-rHCII and the Arg200 mutants, both in terms of optimal dermatan sulfate concentration and maximal inhibition rate (Fig. 1B and Table I).Table ISecond-order rate constants (k2) for proteinase inhibition by wt-rHCII and Arg200 mutantsk2wt-rHCIIR200A-rHCIIR200E-rHCIIm−1min−1α-Thrombin−GAG2.7 ± 1.1 × 1049.5 ± 3.2 × 1041-ap < 0.05 compared with wt-rHCII.15.4 ± 3.8 × 1041-ap < 0.05 compared with wt-rHCII.+ Heparin4.1 ± 0.4 × 1085.5 ± 1.4 × 1084.6 ± 0.8 × 108(200 μg/ml)1-bThe optimal glycosaminoglycan (GAG) concentration is shown in parentheses below the inhibition rate.(500 μg/ml)(500 μg/ml)+ Dermatan1.2 ± 0.2 × 1091.3 ± 0.3 × 1091.1 ± 0.2 × 109sulfate(1000 μg/ml)(1000 μg/ml)(1000 μg/ml)γT-Thrombin1.4 ± 0.5 × 1043.3 ± 1.2 × 1043.2 ± 0.9 × 104Chymotrypsin1.6 ± 0.2 × 1051.7 ± 0.9 × 1051-cp > 0.05 compared with wt-rHCII.1.7 ± 1.0 × 1051-cp > 0.05 compared with wt-rHCII.Inhibition rate constants (k2,m−1 min−1) for wt-rHCII, R200A-rHCII, and R200E-rHCII with α-thrombin, γT-thrombin, and chymotrypsin are summarized below.

For glycosaminoglycan-accelerated inhibition, template curves were performed in the presence of increasing concentrations of glycosaminoglycan, and the maximal inhibition rates were taken from an average of the curves. Assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and values are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of four to seven determinations. wt-rHCII and the Arg200 mutants were assayed for their ability to inhibit α-thrombin, γT-thrombin, and chymotrypsin in the absence of glycosaminoglycans. The second order rate constants of inhibition (k2, m−1min−1) are summarized in Table I. With α-thrombin, both mutants have significantly higher inhibition rates than wt-rHCII (p < 0.05). The k2 values for R200A-rHCII and R200E-rHCII are 3.5- and 5.6-fold higher, respectively, than wt-rHCII. In contrast, the k2 values for wt-rHCII and the Arg200 mutants were identical with chymotrypsin (p > 0.05), indicating that the mutations did not alter the conformation of the reactive site loop. To determine whether the increased inhibitory activity of HCII with α-thrombin is due to enhanced interactions between the acidic domain and ABE-1, inhibition assays were performed with γT-thrombin. γT-Thrombin lacks portions of ABE-1, which have been removed by limited proteolysis with trypsin. All three HCII variants had lower inhibition rates with γT-thrombin as compared with α-thrombin, but the greater decrease in activity was observed with the Arg200mutants. Although the k2 values of the mutants are still higher than wt-rHCII (p < 0.05), they are both now only 2.3-fold higher than wt-rHCII (Table I). To further examine the role of ABE-1 in the enhanced activity of the Arg200 mutants, the rate of α-thrombin inhibition in the presence of hirugen was determined. By binding directly to ABE-1, hirugen interferes with acidic domain-ABE-1 interactions and reduces the rate of α-thrombin inhibition by HCII (33Ciaccia A.V. Cunningham E.L. Church F.C. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 806-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Increasing amounts of hirugen resulted in a dose-dependent blockage of the HCII-thrombin reaction, with a maximal response at 100 μm for all three HCII proteins (data not shown). Hirugen has a greater effect on the ability of the Arg200 mutants to inhibit α-thrombin than it does on wt-rHCII. At 100 μm hirugen, the α-thrombin inhibition rates (k2, m−1min−1) for R200A-rHCII and R200E-rHCII were reduced to 2.2 ± 0.8 × 104 and 2.8 ± 0.6 × 104, respectively, as compared with 1.0 ± 0.4 × 104 for wt-rHCII (Fig. 2). This effect is specific since a control peptide that was highly negatively charged could not block the HCII-thrombin reactions (Fig. 2). To determine whether the enhanced activity of the mutants is due to an increased HCII-thrombin association rate (ka) or to a decreased HCII-thrombin dissociation rate (kd), a slow binding kinetics assay was developed for HCII inhibition of thrombin. In slow binding kinetics, the inhibitor and substrate compete for binding to the proteinase. Shown in Fig. 3 are representative time courses of α-thrombin inhibition at different HCII concentrations. Analysis of the raw data yielded a good fit to Equation 1, typically with correlation coefficients (r2) of 0.999. The values obtained fork′ were used to estimate ka andkd, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A representative plot of k′ versus HCII concentration, shown in Fig. 4, demonstrates the significantly increased ka of the Arg200mutants as compared with wt-rHCII. The ka values (Table II) for R200A-rHCII and R200E-rHCII are 5- and 9-fold higher, respectively, than wt-rHCII. Interestingly, the calculated kd for all the HCII variants are not significantly different (p > 0.05).Figure 4Determination of ka andkd for wt-rHCII and the Arg200mutants. The data from the progress curves were fitted to Equation1 under “Experimental Procedures,” and values for k′ were obtained at each inhibitor concentration. Shown above is a representative plot of k′ versus the HCII concentration (nm) for wt-rHCII (▪), R200A-rHCII (▴), and R200E-rHCII (•). ka is proportional to the slope of the line, while kd is equal to they intercept.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IIka and kd rates for wt-rHCII and the Arg200mutantskakdka ratiom−1min−1min−1wt-rHCII1.3 ± 0.3 × 1041.5 ± 0.4 × 10−3R200A-rHCII6.5 ± 1.8 × 1042-ap < 0.05 compared with wt-rHCII.1.6 ± 0.8 × 10−32-bNot statistically different from wt-rHCII.5R200E-rHCII11.4 ± 1.7 × 1042-ap < 0.05 compared with wt-rHCII.1.6 ± 1.0 × 10−32-bNot statistically different from wt-rHCII.9Summarized below are the ka andkd rates for wt-rHCII and the Arg200mutants.

Open table in a new tab Summarized below are the ka andkd rates for wt-rHCII and the Arg200mutants. The values represent the mean ± S.D. of four to five determinations. We initially hypothesized that Arg200 of HCII would be important for the glycosaminoglycan-mediated inhibitory activity of HCII with thrombin because no other heparin-binding serpin has a basic residue at the analogous position. Furthermore, Arg200 is adjacent to the D-helix region of HCII, previously established to be important for activity. We expected that changing this positively charged residue to an uncharged alanine or a negatively charged glutamic acid would decrease both heparin-Sepharose affinity and glycosaminoglycan-mediated thrombin inhibition. However, mutations at Arg200 did not affect either heparin binding or heparin- and dermatan sulfate-accelerated thrombin inhibition. Although slightly higher concentrations of heparin were required to optimally stimulate inhibition of thrombin by the mutants, the maximal inhibition rate was nearly identical to wt-rHCII. Mutation of critical D-helix residues in previous studies has led to both significantly decreased glycosaminoglycan-accelerated thrombin inhibition and reduced heparin-Sepharose affinity (16Whinna H.C. Blinder M.A. Szewczyk M. Tollefsen D.M. Church F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8129-8135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Blinder M.A. Andersson T.R. Abildgaard U. Tollefsen D.M. J.

The finding that R200A-rHCII and R200E-rHCII are fully active in the presence of both heparin and dermatan sulfate and that their heparin-Sepharose elution profiles are nearly identical indicates that Arg200 is not critical for glycosaminoglycan binding. Interestingly, the thrombin inhibition rates of R200A-rHCII and R200E-rHCII in the absence of glycosaminoglycans were significantly increased. The increased inhibitory activity of the mutants appears to be caused by an enhanced interaction between the HCII acidic domain and ABE-1 of thrombin, since inhibition rates with γT-thrombin are more significantly reduced for the mutants than for wt-rHCII. Furthermore, the addition of hirugen to the HCII-thrombin reaction reduces the activity of the mutants to almost the same level as that of wt-rHCII. However, even with γT-thrombin or α-thrombin/hirugen, the mutants are still more active than wt-rHCII, most likely because the acidic domain binding site on ABE-1 is neither totally removed in γT-thrombin nor completely blocked by hirugen. We have shown previously that dermatan sulfate accelerates γT-thrombin inhibition by HCII by 30-fold, indicating that the acidic domain still interacts with the remaining portions of ABE-1 in a productive manner (32Rogers S.J. Pratt C.W. Whinna H.C. Church F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3613-3617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the identical inhibition rates of wt-rHCII and the Arg200 mutants with chymotrypsin (which does not require either the acidic domain of HCII or glycosaminoglycans for inhibition) indicate that the reactive site loop has not been altered to an “activated” conformation, further implicating a role for the acidic domain in the increased activity of the mutants. To determine whether the enhanced interaction between the acidic domain of the Arg200 mutants and ABE-1 of thrombin resulted in an increased association rate (ka) or a decreased dissociation rate (kd), a slow binding kinetics assay, previously used to characterize other serpin-proteinase reactions, was adapted for HCII-thrombin. These studies revealed that the increased inhibitory activity of the mutants is due to an increased association rate (ka) with thrombin. This suggests that the acidic domain is more involved in the initial “handshake” between HCII and thrombin than in the stabilization of the bimolecular serpin-proteinase complex. These results imply that for wild type HCII, Arg200 helps to maintain acidic domain-HCII intramolecular interactions, thus attenuating thrombin inhibition in the absence of glycosaminoglycans. Previous studies have led to the hypothesis that the D-helix is the intramolecular binding site for the acidic domain in HCII. A study instrumental in developing this hypothesis showed that amino-terminal truncation mutants of HCII that are missing one (Δ67-rHCII) or both (Δ74-rHCII) acidic repeats have greatly increased heparin-Sepharose affinity (30Van Deerlin V.M.D. Tollefsen D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20223-20231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A D-helix double mutant (R184Q/K185Q-rHCII) generated by site-directed mutagenesis was shown to have significantly decreased heparin-Sepharose affinity, enhanced ability to form SDS-PAGE-stable complexes with thrombin in the absence of glycosaminoglycans, but reduced ability to form complexes in the presence of glycosaminoglycans (19Ragg H. Ulshofer T. Gerewitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5211-5218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This study suggested that the increased formation of R184Q/K185Q-rHCII-thrombin complexes in the absence of glycosaminoglycans was due to a disruption in acidic domain interactions with R184 and K185, resulting in increased acidic domain interaction with ABE-1. Our results imply that in the absence of glycosaminoglycan, the presence of an Arg at residue 200 either promotes acidic domain interactions with the D-helix of HCII or binds the acidic domain directly. Changing Arg200 to an Ala or Glu would alter the “equilibrium” and favor the interaction of the acidic domain and ABE-1, resulting in increased thrombin inhibition. These results are also consistent with the hypothesis that the mechanism of acidic domain binding to ABE-1 is part of the HCII-thrombin association reaction. Finally, this interaction would further contribute to maintaining blood plasma HCII in a conformation that would be a poor thrombin inhibitor in the absence of glycosaminoglycans. We acknowledge the late Stuart R. Stone (1951–1996), our colleague and friend, for his advice on developing the slow binding kinetic assay used in this study."

The hydrolysis of 2,3-DPG is physiologically stimulated by 2-phosphoglycolate, a normal constituent of red blood cells (4Rose Z.B. Liebowitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 3232-3241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BPGM also displays a mutase reaction similar to that of the glycolytic enzyme monophosphoglycerate mutase (MPGM, EC 5.4.2.1) which reversibly converts glycerate 3-phosphate (3-PG) to glycerate 2-phosphate (5Rosa R. Gaillardon J. Rosa J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 51: 536-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar,6Sasaki R. Ikura K. Sugimoto E. Chiba H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 50: 581-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). bisphosphoglycerate mutase monophosphoglycerate mutase 2,3-diphosphoglycerate glycerate 3-phosphate glycerate 1,3-diphosphate glycerate 2-phosphate. In red blood cells, 2,3-DPG is the main allosteric effector of hemoglobin. It shifts the equilibrium between the oxy and deoxy conformations of hemoglobin by preferentially stabilizing the unliganded form (6Sasaki R. Ikura K. Sugimoto E. Chiba H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 50: 581-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Consequently, increasing the level of 2,3-DPG would ameliorate oxygen delivery to the tissues. However, 2,3-DPG also promotes polymerization of deoxy-HbS in sickle cell disease (7May A. Huehns E.R. Br. J. Haematol. 1975; 30: 317-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and so decreasing the level of 2,3-DPG would be of potential therapeutic advantage in this serious disease (8Poillon W.N. Kim B.C. Blood. 1990; 76: 1028-1036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Poillon W.N. Kim B.C. Labotka R.J. Hicks C.U. Kark J.A. Blood. 1995; 85: 3289-3296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Modification of BPGM activity may enable the level of cellular 2,3-DPG to be varied. The functional properties of the wild-type erythrocytic BPGM have been extensively studied (10Rose Z.B. Meister A. Advances in Enzymology. Academic Press, New York1980: 211-253Google Scholar). The three reactions have been shown to occur at a unique active site whereas distinct binding sites have been proposed for the two substrates: bisphosphoglycerates and monophosphoglycerates (11Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Watson H.C. Meister A. Advances in Enzymology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1989: 227-313Google Scholar, 12Chiba H. Sasaki R. Curr. Top. Cell.

Commun. 1988; 156: 874-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) shows extensive similarity with MPGM from different sources (17White M.F. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 18Shanske S. Sakoda S. Hermodson M.A. DiMauro S. Schon E.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1988; 263: 16906-16910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The active site of yeast MPGM has been located using enzyme crystals soaked in the substrate, 3-PG (20Winn S.I. Watson H.C. Harkins R.N. Fothergill L.A. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Ser. B. 1981; 293: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although inactive enzyme was used in these studies, there is evidence indicating that 3-PG may interact with Ser11 and Thr20, two amino acid residues located in the putative active site. Although human BPGM has been crystallized (21Cherfils J. Rosa R. Garel M.C. Calvin M.C. Rosa J. Janin J. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 269-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), x-ray diffraction analysis of the structure has not been obtained. We have constructed a three-dimensional model of human BPGM based on crystallographic data from yeast MPGM since in human BPGM and yeast MPGM about 50% of residues are identical (22Craescu C.T. Schaad O. Garel M.C. Rosa R. Edelstein S. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1992; 74: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The BPGM model shows specific charge configuration near the postulated substrate position, in the active site, which differs from MPGM. In particular Ser11, Thr20, and Gly21 in yeast MPGM are replaced by Gly13, Cys22, and Ser23, respectively, in BPGM. In an attempt to develop substrates or cofactor analogs of therapeutic benefit, BPGM variants were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and the structure-function relationships of the enzymes were analyzed to determine which residues are critical in substrates or cofactor binding. A precise identification of mono- and diphosphoglycerate-binding sites would be of great benefit in the chemical synthesis of analogs capable of specifically modulating one of the three activities of BPGM. A prokaryotic expression vector constructed in our laboratory (23Calvin M.C. Blouquit Y. Garel M.C. Préhu M.O. Cohen-Solal M. Rosa J. Rosa R. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1990; 72: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) was used to synthesize wild-type and mutant forms of BPGM in Escherichia coli. Analysis of the catalytic properties of variants have shown that Arg89 is specifically involved in the monophosphoglycerate-binding sites (24Garel M.C. Lemarchandel V. Calvin M.-C. Arous N. Craescu C.T. Préhu M.O. Rosa J. Rosa R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) as has been reported for a natural human BPGM variant (25Rosa R. Préhu M.O. Beuzard Y. Rosa J. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 62: 907-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 26Rosa R. Préhu M.O. Albrecht-Ellmer K. Calvin M.C. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1989; 264: 7837-7843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, we have shown that Gly13 is specifically involved in the diphosphoglycerate-binding sites and that replacement of Gly13 by a positively charged amino acid residue greatly activates the phosphatase reaction, whereas the synthase and mutase reactions are greatly reduced (28Garel M.C. Arous N. Calvin M.C. Craescu C.T. Rosa J. Rosa R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3593-3597Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Further amino acid substitutions were made to determine which residues are actively involved in the catalytic reactions. Initially we focused on Cys22 as sulfhydryl treatment of human BPGM is known to inhibit the different catalytic activities to various degrees (29Rosa R. Calvin M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 153: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 30Tauler A. Bartrons R. Pons G. Carreras J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1983; 76: 789-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The position of Cys22, in the three-dimensional protein model appears to be in the putative active site (Fig.1), strongly implicating it in the chemical inactivation. Second, mutagenesis experiments were performed targeting the Ser23 residue since Fothergill et al. (11Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Watson H.C. Meister A. Advances in Enzymology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1989: 227-313Google Scholar) reported that the amide hydrogen of Ser23 in BPGM may interact with the hydroxyl function of 1,3-DPG and amino acid sequence comparisons indicate that Ser23 is conserved in BPGM from different sources but is not present in any MPGM. The catalytic properties of several BPGM variants, obtained by substitution of Cys22 and Ser23 are reported here. Further enzymatic studies on the variant R89K described previously (24Garel M.C. Lemarchandel V. Calvin M.-C. Arous N. Craescu C.T. Préhu M.O. Rosa J. Rosa R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) are also reported. Circular dichroism spectroscopy was used to study modifications in the secondary structure of the purified proteins, both alone and in the presence of substrates or cofactor. The physical analyses were in agreement with the kinetic data. We conclude that there is at least a punctual discrimination between monophosphoglycerates and 2-phosphoglycolate-binding sites. The buffer reagents were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) except where specified otherwise. All substrates and commercial enzymes were from Boehringer Mannheim (Germany) except glyceraldehyde phosphate which was from Sigma. Trizma base (Tris), Gly-Gly buffer, 2-phosphoglycolate, Dowex 1W8–400, ampicillin, and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside were all from Sigma. [33P]Orthophosphoric acid was from Isotochim (France). Oligonucleotides for mutagenesis experiments were from Genset (France). The procedure for oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis was based on the method of Taylor et al. (31Taylor J.W. Ott J. Eckstein F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8765-8785Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) using the Sculptor kit developed by Amersham (United Kingdom). Single-stranded DNAs of putative mutant phages were prepared and sequenced using the dideoxy method (32Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52250) Google Scholar). The Cys22 residue was replaced by Leu, Ser, or Thr by changing the BPGM cDNA sequence TGT (bases 177–179) to CTT, AGT, or ACT, respectively. The S23G mutation was constructed by changing the codon AGC (bases 180–183) to GGC. Expression plasmids were prepared as described previously (33Garel M.-C. Joulin V. Le Boulch P. Calvin M.-C. Prehu M.-O. Arous N. Longin R. Rosa R. Rosa J. Cohen-Solal M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18966-18972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by subcloning theEcoRI/Pst I fragment of the human BPGM mutated cDNA into the expression vector, pKK 223-3 (Pharmacia). The basic cloning methods described by Maniatis et al. (34Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor. 1982; Google Scholar) were used for all these procedures. Wild-type and mutant enzymes were prepared as described previously (33Garel M.-C. Joulin V. Le Boulch P. Calvin M.-C. Prehu M.-O. Arous N. Longin R. Rosa R. Rosa J. Cohen-Solal M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18966-18972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The native and mutated enzymes were purified by an established procedure (23Calvin M.C. Blouquit Y. Garel M.C. Préhu M.O. Cohen-Solal M. Rosa J. Rosa R. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1990; 72: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 33Garel M.-C. Joulin V. Le Boulch P. Calvin M.-C. Prehu M.-O. Arous N. Longin R. Rosa R. Rosa J. Cohen-Solal M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18966-18972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), however, the lysate was not heated prior to chromatography and the first purification step was on an high pressure liquid chromatography column of Fractogel TSK-AF blue at room temperature (24Garel M.C. Lemarchandel V. Calvin M.-C. Arous N. Craescu C.T. Préhu M.O. Rosa J. Rosa R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The purified enzymes were stored in sodium phosphate buffer containing 20% glycerol at −80 °C until used. Protein concentration was determined using the method of Lowry et al. (35Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purity of the enzymes was determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described by Laemmli (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205516) Google Scholar). Synthase activity was measured using a simplified method recently published (37Ravel P. Garel M.C. Toullec D. C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris III. 1997; 320: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Mutase activity was measured as described previously (25Rosa R. Préhu M.O. Beuzard Y. Rosa J. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 62: 907-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The catalytic constants of synthase and mutase activity were calculated using the ε of NADH of 6 mm−1 cm−1 at 334 nm and by fitting experimental points to the Michaelis-Menten equation with a nonlinear iterative regression program. Phosphatase activity was measured using a radioactive procedure (37Ravel P. Garel M.C. Toullec D. C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris III. 1997; 320: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Following the synthesis of the radioactive substrate [33P]2,3-DPG, the phosphatase reaction was monitored by measuring the radioactivity of monophosphorylated reaction products (Pi and 3-PG). Two types of phosphatase reaction were studied. The first was hydrolysis of 2,3-DPG in the presence of activator ions: chloride (100 mm) and phosphate (10 mm) (25Rosa R. Préhu M.O. Beuzard Y. Rosa J. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 62: 907-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This reaction was called the ion-stimulated phosphatase activity. The second reaction was 2,3-DPG hydrolysis in the presence of both anions and the physiological activator 2-phosphoglycolate (50 μm). This reaction was called the 2-phosphoglycolate-stimulated phosphatase activity. All far-UV CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco 700 spectropolarimeter in a 0.1-cm cell at 20 °C, at enzyme concentrations between 5 and 10 μm. Near-UV spectra were measured using 1-cm quartz cells at concentrations 10-fold higher. The average of 10 runs was taken corrected for solvent distortion. Samples were prepared in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0. The concentration of samples was determined from the UV absorption at 280 nm using ε of the BPGM monomer of 50 mm−1 cm−1. The CD data are given as mean residue ellipticity in units of degree cm2dmol−1. In the human, murine, and rabbit BPGMs, the Cys22 and Ser23 residues are strictly conserved (Table I), however, at the position of Ser23in BPGMs there is always a Gly in the MPGMs from human muscle and brain and from yeast. In contrast, whereas Cys22 is conserved in human muscle MPGM, it is substituted by Ser in human brain MPGM and by Thr in yeast MPGM. These two residues (Cys22 and Ser23) were replaced by amino acids found at the same position in different MPGMs by site-directed mutagenesis in E. coli. The following three mutated enzymes were synthesized: C22T, C22S, and S23G. The effect of the size of the side chain at position 22 was studied by constructing the C22L variant. The protein yield was the same for all the BPGM variants.Table IAlignment of the amino acid sequences (one-letter code) of the human BPGM, rabbit BPGM, murine BPGM, human MPGM type M (MPGM-M), human MPGM type B (MPGM-B), and yeast MPGM Residue numbers refer to the human BPGM amino acid sequence.EnzymeAmino acid residues21222324Human BPGMFCSWRabbit BPGMFCSWMurine BPGMFCSWHuman MPGM-MFCGWHuman MPGM-BFSGWYeast MPGMFTGW Open table in a new tab Circular dichroism experiments were conducted in near- and far-UV regions for all the purified enzymes, to detect aberrant protein folding or large-scale structural modifications induced by the amino acid substitutions. The far-UV circular dichroism spectrum (185–250 nm) is a sensitive probe for protein secondary structure. The wild-type spectrum is characterized by two negative peaks at 208 and 222 nm and by a positive one at 192 nm (Fig. 2 A). The relative intensities of these peaks and the global shape of the spectrum are characteristic for α/β protein three-dimensional structure (38Johnson Jr., W.C. Proteins. 1990; 7: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). The amplitude of the negative peak at 222 nm is directly related to the structure of the α-helix. The mutants analyzed in this study (C22L, C22T, C22S, S23G, and R89K) all had similar CD spectra (data not shown), suggesting that the secondary structure was not significantly perturbed by the amino acid substitutions. The near-UV CD spectrum (250–300 nm) gives a qualitative measure of changes in tertiary structure as it is sensitive to assymetry of aromatic side chains (Trp, Tyr, and Phe). All the variants had similar near-UV spectra to the wild-type BPGM (Fig. 2 B). The enzymes studied here were found to be stable in solution under the experimental conditions used. Taken together with the CD results, this strongly suggested that the secondary and global tertiary structure of the mutant enzymes was unaltered by the amino acid substitutions. The alterations in enzyme activity are therefore likely to be due to the local changes induced by specific amino acid substitutions. The Michaelis constants were determined for each substrate. In addition, the affinity constant for 2-phosphoglycolate was also determined (TablesII, III, IV). A detailed analysis of all the catalytic activities enabled the functions of Cys22, Ser23, and Arg89 in monophosphoglycerates and phosphatase activator binding to be distinguished.Table IISteady-state kinetic parameters of synthase activity of wild-type and mutant forms of BPGMEnzymekcatKm3-PG2-a3-PG as substrate.kcat/Kms−1mms−1mm−1WT13.63 ± 0.3028.70 ± 0.900.47 ± 0.02C22T8.48 ± 0.8523.86 ± 4.030.36 ± 0.10C22S9.94 ± 0.9120.98 ± 0.930.47 ± 0.06S23G4.63 ± 0.1951.90 ± 5.200.09 ± 0.01kcat, the rate constant for 2,3-DPG synthesis, equal to NADH reduction at saturating 3-PG and GAP concentrations, was obtained by fitting experimental points to the Michaelis-Menten equation with a nonlinear iterative regression program.

When Cys22 was substituted by Ser, a polar residue of similar size, only the 2-phosphoglycolate-stimulated phosphatase reaction was significantly reduced (Tables II, III, IV). The presence of another polar residue (Thr) in this position caused an additional decrease in cofactor-stimulated phosphatase reaction, indicating that residue 22 and its specific polarity are important in this catalytic activity. An increase in the size of the side chain from Ser to Thr caused a moderate alteration of all the activities (TablesII, III, IV), suggesting that the bulkier moiety reduced enzymatic activity. This supposition was reinforced by the functional analysis of the C22L variant which had lost all catalytic activities (data not shown), probably due to the large size of the leucine side chain. Further analysis of the catalytic reaction parameters may facilitate an understanding of the molecular basis of the reactions. The steady-state kinetic parameters of the synthase, mutase, and ion-stimulated phosphatase activities were not significantly altered in C22S and C22T (Tables II, III, IV), whereas the affinity for 2-phosphoglycolate was drastically reduced, with Ka values 22-fold higher for C22T, and 16-fold higher for C22S than for the wild-type enzyme (Table IV). In contrast, the Km values for 2,3-DPG and 3-PG of the Cys22-mutated enzyme was not significantly altered. The enzymatic data provides good evidence that Cys22 is necessary for 2-phosphoglycolate-stimulated phosphatase activity probably via activator binding. These results are consistent with those of Diederich et al. (39Diederich D. Khen A. Santos I. Grisolia S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 212: 441-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) who reported that the phosphatase reaction of yeast MPGM which has a Thr side chain at position 22, was not activated by 2 mm 2-phosphoglycolate, whereas this catalytic activity was stimulated 9-fold in MPGM from human skeletal muscle, which has a Cys residue in the position corresponding to Cys22 in human BPGM. Furthermore, MPGM from human erythrocytes (brain type) which has a serine residue at position 22, has very little phosphatase activity, even in the presence of 1 mm 2-phosphoglycolate (40Rosa R. Calvin M.C. Prehu M.O. Arous N. J. Chromatogr. 1984; 285: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), indicating the lack of activation by this cofactor. Our results, in agreement with Hg2+-inhibition experiments on BPGM activities (30Tauler A. Bartrons R. Pons G. Carreras J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1983; 76: 789-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), did not implicate Cys22 in 2,3-DPG binding, indicating that cysteine oxidation did not impede this binding. All the data support the conclusion that Cys22 is specifically involved, directly or indirectly, in 2-phosphoglycolate binding of human BPGM. The properties of the S23G variant were very similar to MPGM: the mutase activity was highly effective whereas the synthase reaction was significantly reduced (Tables II, III, IV). Substitution of Ser by Gly did not affect either of the 2,3-DPG hydrolysis reactions whereas 2-phosphoglycolate stimulated activity was greatly reduced. A detailed analysis of the catalytic reactions indicated a 3-fold increase in the Michaelis constant for 3-PG in the mutase reaction and a 4-fold decrease in the affinity for 2-phosphoglycolate in the cofactor stimulated phosphatase reaction, however, no significant modification of the apparent affinity for 2,3-DPG was observed as provided by absence of its Km modification (TablesII, III, IV). Two other proteins, mutated at position 23 were also studied. The kinetics showed that the replacement of Ser23 by Ala did not produce any significant change in the enzymatic reactions, however a variant with a Thr residue at position 23 was too unstable to be studied (data not shown). These enzymatic results all provide strong evidence for a direct or indirect active role of Ser23 in 3-PG and 2-phosphoglycolate binding. The presence of a glycine residue at position 23 as in all MPGM species, may explain the increase in mutase activity. Previous results obtained in our laboratory strongly suggested that the Arg89 residue of human BPGM is specifically involved in the 3-PG-binding site (24Garel M.C. Lemarchandel V. Calvin M.-C. Arous N. Craescu C.T. Préhu M.O. Rosa J. Rosa R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 27Rosa R. Blouquit Y. Calvin M.C. Promé D. Promé J.-C. Rosa J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7837-7843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We completed the functional studies on the R89K mutant by investigating the ion-stimulated phosphatase activity and measuring the affinity constant for 2-phosphoglycolate. This substitution has no significant effect on the catalytic constant or the activator affinity (TableIV). As previously reported (24Garel M.C. Lemarchandel V. Calvin M.-C. Arous N. Craescu C.T. Préhu M.O. Rosa J. Rosa R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), the R89K mutated protein presents increased Michaelis constants for monophosphoglycerates, whereas the 2,3-DPG one is not affected. Our present results demonstrated that its affinity for 2-phosphoglycolate was also unchanged, indicating that Arg89 is only involved, directly or indirectly, in the monophosphoglycerate-binding sites. By these properties Arg89 allows a discrimination between monophosphoglycerates and 2-phosphoglycolate-binding sites. The far-UV region of the CD spectrum was used to monitor possible structural changes of the enzymes upon ligand binding. Addition of 2,3-DPG to the native BPGM solution (protein monomer: 2,3-DPG molar ratio = 1:10) induced spectroscopic changes. A small but significant and reproducible decrease in the negative band at 208 nm was detected, whereas the α-helix-type band at 222 nm was practically unchanged (Fig. 3). Phosphorylation of the protein by 2,3-DPG is thought to be the first step in the mutase and phosphatases activities of BPGM (11Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Watson H.C. Meister A. Advances in Enzymology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1989: 227-313Google Scholar) and CD spectral modification may be a result of this phosphorylation. The lack of resolution of the method precludes a precise structural explanation of the decrease in the 208 nm negative band, however, the observation is compatible with a relative decrease in the random coil spectral component (negative band at 197 nm) in favor of more regular structures. The stabilization of the COOH-terminal structure of the enzyme by 2,3-DPG fixation and subsequent phosphorylation (11Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Watson H.C. Meister A. Advances in Enzymology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1989: 227-313Google Scholar) would explain the spectroscopic data. Similar CD experiments with yeast MPGM failed to detect any effect of 2,3-DPG (41White M.F. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This may be due to differences between the COOH-terminal structures of MPGM and BPGM. Similar results were obtained for the C22S, C22T, S23G, and R89K variants probably due to their comparable binding parameters for 2,3-DPG. Monophosphoglycerate alone and 2-phosphoglycolate alone did not produce any spectroscopic modification. The addition of 2-phosphoglycolate to the phosphorylated wild-type and R89K mutant led to restoration of the spectroscopic characteristics of the unmodified enzymes (Fig. 4). Structurally, this may correspond to dephosphorylation of the enzyme after stimulation of its phosphatase activity by the cofactor. This hypothesis is further supported by the fact that the two phosphorylated variants, S23G and C22T, which have lower 2-phosphoglycolate affinity than the wild-type and decreased cofactor-stimulated phosphatase activity, show no additional CD modification in the presence of the cofactor. In contrast, addition of 3-PG to the phosphorylated native and mutated BPGMs did not produce a significant spectral change, probably because the enzymes maintain the phosphorylated state. The presence of 3-PG induces the mutase activity without any reduction in the 2,3-DPG level. Under these conditions, the transient phosphorylated state of the enzymes may be maintained. The present results show that monophosphoglycerates and 2-phosphoglycolate have partially distinct binding sites in the active site of BPGM. Cys22 is involved specifically, either directly or indirectly, in 2-phosphoglycolate binding, whereas Arg89 is specific for 3-PG binding, demonstrating that the binding sites are distinct. On the other hand, Ser23 seems to be implicated in both binding sites. Delineation of the specific roles of amino acid residues in the active site is of great importance in the design of substrate or cofactor analogs of potential pharmacological benefit. Analogs of 2-phosphoglycolate modulating the 2,3-DPG level in red blood cells, without changing 3-PG binding, would be of great therapeutic advantage. Discrimination between the monophosphoglycerates and 2-phosphoglycolate-binding sites also prevents perturbation of red blood cells MPGM activity by avoiding cofactor analogs affecting the 3-PG-binding site. This is a critical requirement in therapeutic design since the integrity of MPGM and its interaction with 3-PG in the glycolysis, is critical for cell survival."
