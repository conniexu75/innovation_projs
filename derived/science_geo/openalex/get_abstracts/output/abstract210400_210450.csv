https://openalex.org/W2066552401,"Volumetric experiments on single fibers isolated from semitendinosus muscles of frogs, some performed in correlation with measurements of membrane potential, confirm the data obtained on whole muscles, but only for the specific range of conditions in which most of the latter experiments have been done. These conditions are restricted to media in which the anion (Cl usually) is permanent and the K is 10 to 12.5 meq/liter, or four to five times above the normal level in Ringer's solution. When other ionic conditions are employed, phenomena are disclosed which have not previously been described. The findings throw doubt upon the validity of some generally accepted views regarding the permeability properties of the membrane of frog muscle fibers and regarding the nature of the mechanisms which regulate their volume."

https://openalex.org/W1993930165,"CRUDE preparations of penicillinase from Bacillus cereus N.R.R.L. 569, unlike the purified penicillinase from this organism or crude penicillinase from Staphylococcus aureus R1, have been shown to catalyse the hydrolysis of the β-lactam ring of cephalosporin C and other derivatives of 7-aminocephalosporanic acid at a significant rate. The enzyme responsible for this hydrolysis was termed a cephalosporinase1,2. The maximum rate of hydrolysis (Vmax) of cephalosporin C obtained with a crude enzyme from B. cereus was only 5 per cent of that of benzyl-penicillin, but this value increased to 33 per cent after selective inactivation of penicillinase in aqueous solution at 60° C. Subsequent studies were made with a crude enzyme from Bacillus subtilis N.C.T.C. 6346, induced with cephalosporin C and freed from the cells by the action of lysozyme3. With this enzyme preparation Vmax for cephalosporin C was about 10 per cent that for benzyl-penicillin, but attempts to separate a cephalosporinase from a penicillinase, or selectively inactivate a penicillinase, were unsuccessful."

https://openalex.org/W2015764727,"ALTHOUGH there is adequate evidence that anoxia can damage the brain, the precise method by which it does so is not known. It has been suggested that deprivation of oxygen can lead to death of the cell by direct action on the neurone itself1. However, an alternative mechanism has been postulated by Lindenberg, namely, that cerebral œdema follows anoxia and this in turn leads to interference with the blood supply of the nerve cells in certain vulnerable areas2."

https://openalex.org/W2018243907,"IT has been shown1 that histamine-induced peptic ulceration in the intact unanaesthetized guinea pig can be prevented or diminished by the oral administration of the sulphated polysaccharide, degraded carrageenan; severe duodenal ulceration could be completely prevented by a dose which at the same time approximately halved the severity of gastric ulceration. It was suggested that degraded carrageenan might augment the natural protection afforded by mucin by complexing with it, so providing a more robust mucosal coating. It has since also been found2 that in the guinea pig the volume and acidity of histamine gastric secretion is reduced by prior oral administration of degraded carrageenan"

https://openalex.org/W2045306591,"IRON absorption has been shown to be increased by a variety of substances. Ascorbic acid is perhaps the best known of these1. The activities of inosine2, succinic acid3, fructose4 and cysteine5,6 have been discovered more recently. Several different hypotheses have been offered in explanation of the action of these substances. (1) That ferrous iron is more readily absorbed than ferric iron and that the ferrous form is maintained by an intra-luminal intestinal reducing agent (ascorbic acid); (2) that iron transport is linked with oxidative metabolism (succinic acid); (3) that iron transport depends on a carrier or chelating agent (fructose, cysteine)."
https://openalex.org/W1969121633,"THE presence of phosphoprotein in the plasma of the laying hen is widely held to be the result of the action of œstrogenic substances produced by the growing ova of the mature bird1, though the precise nature and quantities of œstrogenic substances present in the blood stream have not yet been determined. Recently it has been shown that the phosphoprotein in the plasma of the laying hen is phosvitin, the principal protein of egg yolk2, and it seemed desirable to examine the plasma of œstrogen-treated non-laying birds to determine whether or not such treatments could, in fact, lead to the formation of phosvitin."

Other statistical parameters could be also used, since they throw some light on regulatory mechanisms. This can be shown by the following results."

https://openalex.org/W2008648333,"AUTORADIOGRAPHY is a technique which reveals the sites of radioactivity in an object by means of a photographic emulsion. The object is brought into close contact with the emulsion and after a suitable period of time the emulsion is processed by photographic development. In such a preparation the sites of radioactivity are indicated by the presence of silver grains in the emulsion. At present, regions of an autoradiograph are regarded as different if the densities of their silver grains, in terms of some attribute of the object, are different. It may be possible to use another property of the grains to show that regions are different. This property is the way the grains are distributed in clusters."
