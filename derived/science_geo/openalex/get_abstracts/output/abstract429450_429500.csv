https://openalex.org/W2044997702,"Improving Lithium Batteries Lithium-oxygen batteries have similar volumetric energy densities to lithium-ion batteries, but, because the oxygen part of the battery can be extracted from the air, they have a significant advantage in their gravimetric energy densities. One of the fundamental problems plaguing the nonaqueous Li-O 2 system is that the Li 2 O 2 that forms on discharge must be completely reversed on charging, but for most systems, a range of side products form instead of Li 2 O 2 . Peng et al. (p. 563 , published online 19 July) show that by using dimethyl sulfoxide as the electrolyte, and a porous gold cathode, they can get reversible production and removal of Li 2 O 2 during discharge and charge cycles. Furthermore, the electrolyte-electrode system operates with much faster kinetics than carbon electrodes."
https://openalex.org/W2111307685,"The 1000 Genomes Project and disease-specific sequencing efforts are producing large collections of haplotypes that can be used as reference panels for genotype imputation in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, imputing from large reference panels with existing methods imposes a high computational burden. We introduce a strategy called 'pre-phasing' that maintains the accuracy of leading methods while reducing computational costs. We first statistically estimate the haplotypes for each individual within the GWAS sample (pre-phasing) and then impute missing genotypes into these estimated haplotypes. This reduces the computational cost because (i) the GWAS samples must be phased only once, whereas standard methods would implicitly repeat phasing with each reference panel update, and (ii) it is much faster to match a phased GWAS haplotype to one reference haplotype than to match two unphased GWAS genotypes to a pair of reference haplotypes. We implemented our approach in the MaCH and IMPUTE2 frameworks, and we tested it on data sets from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 2 (WTCCC2), the Genetic Association Information Network (GAIN), the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and the 1000 Genomes Project. This strategy will be particularly valuable for repeated imputation as reference panels evolve."
https://openalex.org/W2121690903,"RNA-Seq of single cells has been limited by biases in transcript coverage and unknown technical variability. Ramsköld et al. describe a protocol to reproducibly recover full-length transcripts and use it to quantitatively analyze splice isoforms in single cells. Genome-wide transcriptome analyses are routinely used to monitor tissue-, disease- and cell type–specific gene expression, but it has been technically challenging to generate expression profiles from single cells. Here we describe a robust mRNA-Seq protocol (Smart-Seq) that is applicable down to single cell levels. Compared with existing methods, Smart-Seq has improved read coverage across transcripts, which enhances detailed analyses of alternative transcript isoforms and identification of single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We determined the sensitivity and quantitative accuracy of Smart-Seq for single-cell transcriptomics by evaluating it on total RNA dilution series. We found that although gene expression estimates from single cells have increased noise, hundreds of differentially expressed genes could be identified using few cells per cell type. Applying Smart-Seq to circulating tumor cells from melanomas, we identified distinct gene expression patterns, including candidate biomarkers for melanoma circulating tumor cells. Our protocol will be useful for addressing fundamental biological problems requiring genome-wide transcriptome profiling in rare cells."
https://openalex.org/W2043215109,"Plant growth is coordinately regulated by environmental and hormonal signals. Brassinosteroid (BR) plays essential roles in growth regulation by light and temperature, but the interactions between BR and these environmental signals remain poorly understood at the molecular level. Here, we show that direct interaction between the dark- and heat-activated transcription factor phytochrome-interacting factor 4 (PIF4) and the BR-activated transcription factor BZR1 integrates the hormonal and environmental signals. BZR1 and PIF4 interact with each other in vitro and in vivo, bind to nearly 2,000 common target genes, and synergistically regulate many of these target genes, including the PRE family helix–loop–helix factors required for promoting cell elongation. Genetic analysis indicates that BZR1 and PIFs are interdependent in promoting cell elongation in response to BR, darkness or heat. These results show that the BZR1–PIF4 interaction controls a core transcription network, enabling plant growth co-regulation by the steroid and environmental signals. Wang and colleagues have uncovered a direct functional relationship between the brassinosteroid-activated transcription factor BZR1 and the light- and heat-sensitive transcription factor PIF4. This interplay integrates hormonal and environmental signals to modulate cell elongation during plant growth."
https://openalex.org/W1979855662,"Medulloblastoma is the most common brain tumour in children; using exome sequencing of tumour samples the authors show that these cancers have low mutation rates and identify 12 significantly mutated genes, among them the gene encoding RNA helicase DDX3X. Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumour in children. Four papers published in the 2 August 2012 issue of Nature use whole-genome and other sequencing techniques to produce a detailed picture of the genetics and genomics of this condition. Notable findings include the identification of recurrent mutations in genes not previously implicated in medulloblastoma, with significant genetic differences associated with the four biologically distinct subgroups and clinical outcomes in each. Potential avenues for therapy are suggested by the identification of targetable somatic copy-number alterations, including recurrent events targeting TGFβ signalling in Group 3, and NF-κB signalling in Group 4 medulloblastomas. Medulloblastomas are the most common malignant brain tumours in children1. Identifying and understanding the genetic events that drive these tumours is critical for the development of more effective diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic strategies. Recently, our group and others described distinct molecular subtypes of medulloblastoma on the basis of transcriptional and copy number profiles2,3,4,5. Here we use whole-exome hybrid capture and deep sequencing to identify somatic mutations across the coding regions of 92 primary medulloblastoma/normal pairs. Overall, medulloblastomas have low mutation rates consistent with other paediatric tumours, with a median of 0.35 non-silent mutations per megabase. We identified twelve genes mutated at statistically significant frequencies, including previously known mutated genes in medulloblastoma such as CTNNB1, PTCH1, MLL2, SMARCA4 and TP53. Recurrent somatic mutations were newly identified in an RNA helicase gene, DDX3X, often concurrent with CTNNB1 mutations, and in the nuclear co-repressor (N-CoR) complex genes GPS2, BCOR and LDB1. We show that mutant DDX3X potentiates transactivation of a TCF promoter and enhances cell viability in combination with mutant, but not wild-type, β-catenin. Together, our study reveals the alteration of WNT, hedgehog, histone methyltransferase and now N-CoR pathways across medulloblastomas and within specific subtypes of this disease, and nominates the RNA helicase DDX3X as a component of pathogenic β-catenin signalling in medulloblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W2007747853,"Systemic infections with Gram-negative bacteria are characterized by high mortality rates due to the ""sepsis syndrome,"" a widespread and uncontrolled inflammatory response. Though it is well recognized that the immune response during Gram-negative bacterial infection is initiated after the recognition of endotoxin by Toll-like receptor 4, the molecular mechanisms underlying the detrimental inflammatory response during Gram-negative bacteremia remain poorly defined. Here, we identify a TRIF pathway that licenses NLRP3 inflammasome activation by all Gram-negative bacteria. By engaging TRIF, Gram-negative bacteria activate caspase-11. TRIF activates caspase-11 via type I IFN signaling, an event that is both necessary and sufficient for caspase-11 induction and autoactivation. Caspase-11 subsequently synergizes with the assembled NLRP3 inflammasome to regulate caspase-1 activation and leads to caspase-1-independent cell death. These events occur specifically during infection with Gram-negative, but not Gram-positive, bacteria. The identification of TRIF as a regulator of caspase-11 underscores the importance of TLRs as master regulators of inflammasomes during Gram-negative bacterial infection."
https://openalex.org/W2111766323,"Sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response to infection, commonly progresses to acute lung injury (ALI), an inflammatory lung disease with high morbidity. We postulated that sepsis-associated ALI is initiated by degradation of the pulmonary endothelial glycocalyx, leading to neutrophil adherence and inflammation. Using intravital microscopy, we found that endotoxemia in mice rapidly induced pulmonary microvascular glycocalyx degradation via tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-dependent mechanisms. Glycocalyx degradation involved the specific loss of heparan sulfate and coincided with activation of endothelial heparanase, a TNF-α-responsive, heparan sulfate-specific glucuronidase. Glycocalyx degradation increased the availability of endothelial surface adhesion molecules to circulating microspheres and contributed to neutrophil adhesion. Heparanase inhibition prevented endotoxemia-associated glycocalyx loss and neutrophil adhesion and, accordingly, attenuated sepsis-induced ALI and mortality in mice. These findings are potentially relevant to human disease, as sepsis-associated respiratory failure in humans was associated with higher plasma heparan sulfate degradation activity; moreover, heparanase content was higher in human lung biopsies showing diffuse alveolar damage than in normal human lung tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1989456683,"Mutation rates in cancer genomes are closely related to chromatin organization, indicating that the arrangement of the genome into heterochromatin- and euchromatin-like domains may be a dominant influence on variation in regional mutation rate in human somatic cells. The sequencing of cancer genomes provides an opportunity to determine directly how mutation rates vary across the human genome. Benjamin Schuster–Bckler and Ben Lehner explore the landscape of mutation rates in somatic, as opposed to germline, cells using data on more than 80,000 unique single–nucleotide–variant positions from leukaemia, melanoma, lung cancer and prostate cancer genomes. They find that the mutation rates are closely related to chromatin organization, suggesting that the arrangement of the genome into heterochromatin and euchromatin–like domains is a dominant influence on regional mutation–rate variation in human somatic cells. Cancer genome sequencing provides the first direct information on how mutation rates vary across the human genome in somatic cells1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Testing diverse genetic and epigenetic features, here we show that mutation rates in cancer genomes are strikingly related to chromatin organization. Indeed, at the megabase scale, a single feature—levels of the heterochromatin-associated histone modification H3K9me3—can account for more than 40% of mutation-rate variation, and a combination of features can account for more than 55%. The strong association between mutation rates and chromatin organization is upheld in samples from different tissues and for different mutation types. This suggests that the arrangement of the genome into heterochromatin- and euchromatin-like domains is a dominant influence on regional mutation-rate variation in human somatic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1976118830,"Here the authors show that the binding of amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomers to cellular prion protein (PrPc) activates Fyn kinase. Aβ stimulation of PrPc/Fyn signaling drives phosphorylation of the NR2B subunit of NMDA receptors, with a subsequent loss of receptor surface expression and dendritic spines. Amyloid-beta (Aβ) oligomers are thought to trigger Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology. Cellular prion protein (PrPC) selectively binds oligomeric Aβ and can mediate Alzheimer's disease–related phenotypes. We examined the specificity, distribution and signaling of Aβ-PrPC complexes, seeking to understand how they might alter the function of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) in neurons. PrPC is enriched in postsynaptic densities, and Aβ-PrPC interaction leads to Fyn kinase activation. Soluble Aβ assemblies derived from the brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disease interacted with PrPC to activate Fyn. Aβ engagement of PrPC-Fyn signaling yielded phosphorylation of the NR2B subunit of NMDARs, which was coupled to an initial increase and then a loss of surface NMDARs. Aβ-induced dendritic spine loss and lactate dehydrogenase release required both PrPC and Fyn, and human familial Alzheimer's disease transgene–induced convulsive seizures did not occur in mice lacking PrPC. These results delineate an Aβ oligomer signal transduction pathway that requires PrPC and Fyn to alter synaptic function, with deleterious consequences in Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2051876668,"Brassinosteroid and gibberellin promote many similar developmental responses in plants; however, their relationship remains unclear. Here we show that BR and GA act interdependently through a direct interaction between the BR-activated BZR1 and GA-inactivated DELLA transcription regulators. GA promotion of cell elongation required BR signalling, whereas BR or active BZR1 suppressed the GA-deficient dwarf phenotype. DELLAs directly interacted with BZR1 and inhibited BZR1–DNA binding both in vitro and in vivo. Genome-wide analysis defined a BZR1-dependent GA-regulated transcriptome, which is enriched with light-regulated genes and genes involved in cell wall synthesis and photosynthesis/chloroplast function. GA promotion of hypocotyl elongation requires both BZR1 and the phytochrome-interacting factors (PIFs), as well as their common downstream targets encoding the PRE-family helix–loop–helix factors. The results demonstrate that GA releases DELLA-mediated inhibition of BZR1, and that the DELLA–BZR1–PIF4 interaction defines a core transcription module that mediates coordinated growth regulation by GA, BR and light signals. Wang and colleagues show that, in Arabidopsis thaliana, brassinosteroid and light-dependent transcription factors are required for giberellin effects on hypocotyl elongation, by modulating transcription of giberellin-induced genes involved in cell wall synthesis and photosynthesis. Conversely, giberellin relieves the brassinosteroid component BZR1 from inhibition by DELLA proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2016298708,"Reverse engineering of biological form and function requires hierarchical design over several orders of space and time. Recent advances in the mechanistic understanding of biosynthetic compound materials, computer-aided design approaches in molecular synthetic biology 4,5 and traditional soft robotics, and increasing aptitude in generating structural and chemical micro environments that promote cellular self-organization have enhanced the ability to recapitulate such hierarchical architecture in engineered biological systems. Here we combined these capabilities in a systematic design strategy to reverse engineer a muscular pump. We report the construction of a freely swimming jellyfish from chemically dissociated rat tissue and silicone polymer as a proof of concept. The constructs, termed 'medusoids', were designed with computer simulations and experiments to match key determinants of jellyfish propulsion and feeding performance by quantitatively mimicking structural design, stroke kinematics and animal-fluid interactions. The combination of the engineering design algorithm with quantitative benchmarks of physiological performance suggests that our strategy is broadly applicable to reverse engineering of muscular organs or simple life forms that pump to survive."

https://openalex.org/W1973659410,"A Double Escapee Toll-like receptors (TLRs)—TLR2 and TLR7—are thought to contribute to the sensing of Gram-positive bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae by the immune system. Mice deficient in these receptors, however, are still sensitive to infection with these bacteria. Oldenburg et al. (p. 1111 , published online 19 July) demonstrate that TLR13 also plays a role in detecting Gram-positive bacteria. TLR13 recognized a conserved region in the peptidyl transferase loop of bacterial 23S ribosomal RNA. Intriguingly, this same sequence is modified by specific methyltransferases that confer resistance to erythromycin. Indeed, erythromycin-resistant bacteria were no longer detectible by TLR13."
https://openalex.org/W2117026298,"The identification of somatic activating mutations in JAK2 (refs 1–4) and in the thrombopoietin receptor gene (MPL) in most patients with myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) led to the clinical development of JAK2 kinase inhibitors. JAK2 inhibitor therapy improves MPN-associated splenomegaly and systemic symptoms but does not significantly decrease or eliminate the MPN clone in most patients with MPN. We therefore sought to characterize mechanisms by which MPN cells persist despite chronic inhibition of JAK2. Here we show that JAK2 inhibitor persistence is associated with reactivation of JAK–STAT signalling and with heterodimerization between activated JAK2 and JAK1 or TYK2, consistent with activation of JAK2 in trans by other JAK kinases. Further, this phenomenon is reversible: JAK2 inhibitor withdrawal is associated with resensitization to JAK2 kinase inhibitors and with reversible changes in JAK2 expression. We saw increased JAK2 heterodimerization and sustained JAK2 activation in cell lines, in murine models and in patients treated with JAK2 inhibitors. RNA interference and pharmacological studies show that JAK2-inhibitor-persistent cells remain dependent on JAK2 protein expression. Consequently, therapies that result in JAK2 degradation retain efficacy in persistent cells and may provide additional benefit to patients with JAK2-dependent malignancies treated with JAK2 inhibitors."

https://openalex.org/W2046585589,"Although loss-of-function p53 alterations are widespread in many tumors, melanomas typically do not harbor TP53 mutations. This report uncovers upregulation of MDM4 as a frequent trait of melanomas that contributes to tumorigenesis by inactivating p53 signaling. MDM4 is required for growth and survival of melanoma cell lines, and compounds that can target MDM4 are effective against melanoma in vivo and against tumors resistant to BRAF-targeted therapy in vitro. The inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor pathway, which often occurs through mutations in TP53 (encoding tumor protein 53) is a common step in human cancer. However, in melanoma—a highly chemotherapy-resistant disease—TP53 mutations are rare, raising the possibility that this cancer uses alternative ways to overcome p53-mediated tumor suppression. Here we show that Mdm4 p53 binding protein homolog (MDM4), a negative regulator of p53, is upregulated in a substantial proportion (∼65%) of stage I–IV human melanomas and that melanocyte-specific Mdm4 overexpression enhanced tumorigenesis in a mouse model of melanoma induced by the oncogene Nras. MDM4 promotes the survival of human metastatic melanoma by antagonizing p53 proapoptotic function. Notably, inhibition of the MDM4-p53 interaction restored p53 function in melanoma cells, resulting in increased sensitivity to cytotoxic chemotherapy and to inhibitors of the BRAF (V600E) oncogene. Our results identify MDM4 as a key determinant of impaired p53 function in human melanoma and designate MDM4 as a promising target for antimelanoma combination therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1967658333,"Diseases of the esophageal epithelium (EE), such as reflux esophagitis and cancer, are rising in incidence. Despite this, the cellular behaviors underlying EE homeostasis and repair remain controversial. Here, we show that in mice, EE is maintained by a single population of cells that divide stochastically to generate proliferating and differentiating daughters with equal probability. In response to challenge with all-trans retinoic acid (atRA), the balance of daughter cell fate is unaltered, but the rate of cell division increases. However, after wounding, cells reversibly switch to producing an excess of proliferating daughters until the wound has closed. Such fate-switching enables a single progenitor population to both maintain and repair tissue without the need for a ""reserve"" slow-cycling stem cell pool."

https://openalex.org/W2146843890,"Earthquake in a Maze The 11 April 2012 magnitude 8.6 earthquake offshore of Sumatra was the largest measured earthquake along a strike-slip boundary that modern seismological instruments have ever recorded. Despite its size and proximity to a large population, there was no subsequent tsunami and there were no reported fatalities. Meng et al. (p. 724 , published online 19 July) used teleseismic data from seismological networks in Japan and Europe to image the source of high-frequency radiation generated by the earthquake to understand the mechanics of this unique event. The resultant back projections showed that the earthquake slowly ruptured along a complex series of faults. The deeper-than-usual rupture path and large stress drop are both features that may not be unique to this earthquake, suggesting that regions in a similar tectonic environment may have the potential for more complex—or larger—intraplate earthquakes than might have been expected."

https://openalex.org/W1999407700,"Primary astrocytomas of grade 3 or 4 according to the classification system of the World Health Organization (high-grade astrocytomas or HGAs) are preponderant among adults and are almost invariably fatal despite the use of multimodal therapy. Here we show that the juvenile brain has an endogenous defense mechanism against HGAs. Neural precursor cells (NPCs) migrate to HGAs, reduce glioma expansion and prolong survival time by releasing endovanilloids that activate the vanilloid receptor (transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily member-1 or TRPV1) on HGA cells. TRPV1 is highly expressed in tumor and weakly expressed in tumor-free brain. TRPV1 stimulation triggers tumor cell death through the branch of the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway that is controlled by activating transcription factor-3 (ATF3). The antitumorigenic response of NPCs is lost with aging. NPC-mediated tumor suppression can be mimicked in the adult brain by systemic administration of the synthetic vanilloid arvanil, suggesting that TRPV1 agonists have potential as new HGA therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2022037546,"The formation of epithelial tissues requires both the generation of apical–basal polarity and the coordination of this polarity between neighbouring cells to form a central lumen. During de novo lumen formation, vectorial membrane transport contributes to the formation of a singular apical membrane, resulting in the contribution of each cell to only a single lumen. Here, from a functional screen for genes required for three-dimensional epithelial architecture, we identify key roles for synaptotagmin-like proteins 2-a and 4-a (Slp2-a/4-a) in the generation of a single apical surface per cell. Slp2-a localizes to the luminal membrane in a PtdIns(4,5)P2-dependent manner, where it targets Rab27-loaded vesicles to initiate a single lumen. Vesicle tethering and fusion is controlled by Slp4-a, in conjunction with Rab27/Rab3/Rab8 and the SNARE syntaxin-3. Together, Slp2-a/4-a coordinate the spatiotemporal organization of vectorial apical transport to ensure that only a single apical surface, and thus the formation of a single lumen, occurs per cell. By performing a screen for genes that regulate epithelial architecture, Martín–Belmonte and colleagues identify key roles for the synaptotagmin-like proteins Slp2-a and Slp4-a in restricting lumen generation. They find that Slp2-a targets Rab27a/b-positive vesicles to PtdIns(4,5)P2-enriched apical membranes, whereas Slp4-a controls subsequent vesicle tethering and fusion. Their coordinated activities ensure the creation of a single lumen per cell."
https://openalex.org/W2053859176,"Brassinosteroids (BRs) are steroidal phytohormones that regulate plant growth and development. Whereas in Arabidopsis the network-like routes of BR biosynthesis have been elucidated in considerable detail, the roles of some of the biosynthetic enzymes and their participation in the different subpathways remained to be clarified. We investigated the function of the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CYP90A1/CPD, which earlier had been proposed to act as a BR C-23 hydroxylase. Our GC-MS and genetic analyses demonstrated that the cpd mutation arrests BR synthesis upstream of the DET2-mediated 5α reduction step and that overexpression of the C-23 hydroxylase CYP90C1 does not alleviate BR deficiency in the cpd mutant. In line with these results, we found that CYP90A1/CPD heterologously expressed in a baculovirus-insect cell system catalyzes C-3 oxidation of the early BR intermediates (22S)-22-hydroxycampesterol and (22R,23R)-22,23-dihydroxycampesterol, as well as of 6-deoxocathasterone and 6-deoxoteasterone. Enzyme kinetic data of CYP90A1/CPD and DET2, together with those of the earlier studied CYP90B1, CYP90C1, and CYP90D1, suggest that BR biosynthesis proceeds mainly via the campestanol-independent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1988752967,"Bacterial pathogens have evolved specific effector proteins that, by interfacing with host kinase signalling pathways, provide a mechanism to evade immune responses during infection. Although these effectors contribute to pathogen virulence, we realized that they might also serve as valuable synthetic biology reagents for engineering cellular behaviour. Here we exploit two effector proteins, the Shigella flexneri OspF protein and Yersinia pestis YopH protein, to rewire kinase-mediated responses systematically both in yeast and mammalian immune cells. Bacterial effector proteins can be directed to inhibit specific mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways selectively in yeast by artificially targeting them to pathway-specific complexes. Moreover, we show that unique properties of the effectors generate new pathway behaviours: OspF, which irreversibly inactivates mitogen-activated protein kinases, was used to construct a synthetic feedback circuit that shows novel frequency-dependent input filtering. Finally, we show that effectors can be used in T cells, either as feedback modulators to tune the T-cell response amplitude precisely, or as an inducible pause switch that can temporarily disable T-cell activation. These studies demonstrate how pathogens could provide a rich toolkit of parts to engineer cells for therapeutic or biotechnological applications."
https://openalex.org/W2056934197,"In Helicobacter pylori infection, vacuolating cytotoxin (VacA)-induced mitochondrial damage leading to apoptosis is believed to be a major cause of cell death. It has also been proposed that VacA-induced autophagy serves as a host mechanism to limit toxin-induced cellular damage. Apoptosis and autophagy are two dynamic and opposing processes that must be balanced to regulate cell death and survival. Here we identify the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) as the VacA receptor for toxin-induced autophagy in the gastric epithelial cell line AZ-521, and show that VacA internalization through binding to LRP1 regulates the autophagic process including generation of LC3-II from LC3-I, which is involved in formation of autophagosomes and autolysosomes. Knockdown of LRP1 and Atg5 inhibited generation of LC3-II as well as cleavage of PARP, a marker of apoptosis, in response to VacA, whereas caspase inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-fmk), and necroptosis inhibitor, Necrostatin-1, did not inhibit VacA-induced autophagy, suggesting that VacA-induced autophagy via LRP1 binding precedes apoptosis. Other VacA receptors such as RPTPα, RPTPβ, and fibronectin did not affect VacA-induced autophagy or apoptosis. Therefore, we propose that the cell surface receptor, LRP1, mediates VacA-induced autophagy and apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2172159799,"Discovery of the native activity of the ~60,000 putative glycosyltransferases remains a substantial challenge. A high-throughput, label-free method drastically speeds this process, with assays of 85 enzymes, 24 acceptors and 7 donors returning functions for four new proteins. Glycosyltransferases catalyze the reaction between an activated sugar donor and an acceptor to form a new glycosidic linkage. Glycosyltransferases are responsible for the assembly of oligosaccharides in vivo and are also important for the in vitro synthesis of these biomolecules. However, the functional identification and characterization of new glycosyltransferases is difficult and tedious. This paper describes an approach that combines arrays of reactions on an immobilized array of acceptors with an analysis by mass spectrometry to screen putative glycosyltransferases. A total of 14,280 combinations of a glycosyltransferase, an acceptor and a donor in four buffer conditions were screened, leading to the identification and characterization of four new glycosyltransferases. This work is notable because it provides a label-free method for the rapid functional annotation of putative enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1994253261,"Visual attention is guided to stimuli either on the basis of their intrinsic saliency against their background (bottom-up factors) or through willful search of known targets (top-down factors). Posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is thought to be important for the guidance of visual bottom-up attention, whereas dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is thought to represent top-down factors. Contrary to this established view, we found that, when monkeys were tested in a task requiring detection of a salient stimulus defined purely by bottom-up factors and whose identity was unknown before the presentation of a visual display, prefrontal neurons represented the salient stimulus no later than those in the PPC. This was true even though visual response latency was shorter in parietal than in prefrontal cortex. These results suggest an early involvement of the prefrontal cortex in the bottom-up guidance of visual attention."
https://openalex.org/W2079666386,"The cellular response to virus infection is initiated by recognition of the invading pathogen and subsequent changes in gene expression mediated by both transcriptional and translational mechanisms. In addition to well established means of regulating antiviral gene expression, it has been demonstrated that RNA interference (RNAi) can play an important role in antiviral responses. Virus-derived small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a primary antiviral response exploited by plants and invertebrate animals, and host-encoded microRNA (miRNA) species have been clearly implicated in the regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses in mammals and other vertebrates. Examination of miRNA abundance in human lung cell lines revealed endogenous miRNAs, including miR-7, miR-132, miR-146a, miR-187, miR-200c, and miR-1275, to specifically accumulate in response to infection with two influenza A virus strains, A/Udorn/72 and A/WSN/33. Known antiviral response pathways, including Toll-like receptor, RIG-I-like receptor, and direct interferon or cytokine stimulation did not alter the abundance of the tested miRNAs to the extent of influenza A virus infection, which initiates primary miRNA transcription via a secondary response pathway. Gene expression profiling identified 26 cellular mRNAs targeted by these miRNAs, including IRAK1, MAPK3, and other components of innate immune signaling systems."

https://openalex.org/W2070824377,"Functional heterogeneity within a class of neurons is investigated by comparing the intrinsic properties of pairs of mitral cells belonging to either the same or different glomerular circuits; this shows that neuronal excitability is stereotypic for mitral cells from the same olfactory network, indicating that local circuits are functionally adapted to process subtly distinct information. The brain's complexity depends largely on the variety of its neuronal cell types, but what further functional heterogeneity exists within each class of neurons is still poorly documented. Focusing on the olfactory system, Troy Margrie and colleagues now report that mitral cells belonging to the same glomerulus — and therefore receiving input from one common odorant receptor — express similar levels of the HCN2 ion channel subunit, and thus present similar neuronal excitability. Mitral cells engaged in brain circuits linked to other glomeruli express different biophysical profiles, suggesting that intrinsic diversity among neurons of a given morphological class may reflect functional adaptations of local circuits to the subtly distinct information they process. One defining characteristic of the mammalian brain is its neuronal diversity1. For a given region, substructure, layer or even cell type, variability in neuronal morphology and connectivity persists2,3,4,5. Although it is well known that such cellular properties vary considerably according to neuronal type, the substantial biophysical diversity of neurons of the same morphological class is typically averaged out and ignored. Here we show that the amplitude of hyperpolarization-evoked sag of membrane potential recorded in olfactory bulb mitral cells is an emergent, homotypic property of local networks and sensory information processing. Simultaneous whole-cell recordings from pairs of cells show that the amount of hyperpolarization-evoked sag potential and current (Ih)6 is stereotypic for mitral cells belonging to the same glomerular circuit. This is corroborated by a mosaic, glomerulus-based pattern of expression of the HCN2 (hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 2) subunit of the Ih channel. Furthermore, inter-glomerular differences in both membrane potential sag and HCN2 protein are diminished when sensory input to glomeruli is genetically and globally altered so that only one type of odorant receptor is universally expressed7. Population diversity in this intrinsic property therefore reflects differential expression between local mitral cell networks processing distinct odour-related information."
https://openalex.org/W1969593814,"APOBEC3A belongs to a family of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) DNA cytosine deaminases that are known for restriction of HIV through deamination-induced mutational inactivation, e.g. APOBEC3G, or initiation of somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination (activation-induced cytidine deaminase). APOBEC3A, which is localized to both the cytoplasm and nucleus, not only restricts HIV but can also initiate catabolism of cellular DNA. Despite being ascribed these roles, there is a paucity of data available on the biochemical mechanism by which APOBEC3A deaminates ssDNA. Here we assessed APOBEC3A deamination activity on ssDNA and in dynamic systems modeling HIV replication (cytoplasmic event) and DNA transcription (nuclear event). We find that APOBEC3A, unlike the highly processive APOBEC3G, exhibits low or no processivity when deaminating synthetic ssDNA substrates with two cytosines located 5-63 nucleotides apart, likely because of an apparent K(d) in the micromolar range (9.1 μm). APOBEC3A was able to deaminate nascently synthesized (-)DNA in an in vitro model HIV replication assay but induced fewer mutations overall in comparison to APOBEC3G. However, the data indicate that the target deamination motif (5'-TC for APOBEC3A and 5'-CC for APOBEC3G) and not the number of mutations best predicted the ability to mutationally inactivate HIV. We further assessed APOBEC3A for the ability to deaminate dsDNA undergoing transcription, which could allow for collateral deaminations to occur in genomic DNA similar to the action of activation-induced cytidine deaminase. That APOBEC3A was able to deaminate dsDNA undergoing transcription suggests a genomic cost of a deamination-based retroviral restriction system."
https://openalex.org/W1970858662,"Histone deacetylases (HDACs) function in a wide range of molecular processes, including gene expression, and are of significant interest as therapeutic targets. Although their native complexes, subcellular localization, and recruitment mechanisms to chromatin have been extensively studied, much less is known about whether the enzymatic activity of non-sirtuin HDACs can be regulated by natural metabolites. Here, we show that several coenzyme A (CoA) derivatives, such as acetyl-CoA, butyryl-CoA, HMG-CoA, and malonyl-CoA, as well as NADPH but not NADP(+), NADH, or NAD(+), act as allosteric activators of recombinant HDAC1 and HDAC2 in vitro following a mixed activation kinetic. In contrast, free CoA, like unconjugated butyrate, inhibits HDAC activity in vitro. Analysis of a large number of engineered HDAC1 mutants suggests that the HDAC activity can potentially be decoupled from ""activatability"" by the CoA derivatives. In vivo, pharmacological inhibition of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) to decrease NADPH levels led to significant increases in global levels of histone H3 and H4 acetylation. The similarity in structures of the identified metabolites and the exquisite selectivity of NADPH over NADP(+), NADH, and NAD(+) as an HDAC activator reveal a previously unrecognized biochemical feature of the HDAC proteins with important consequences for regulation of histone acetylation as well as the development of more specific and potent HDAC inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2077968912,"Promoting the Male X Chromosome In mammals and fruit flies, females have a double dose of the X chromosome compared to males, and to compensate for this imbalance, in fruit flies, transcription from across most of the male X chromosome is boosted by twofold. Conrad et al. (p. 742 , published online 19 July) measured the binding of RNA polymerase II, responsible for the majority of the transcription on the X chromosome, and found a consistent increase at the promoters of genes on the male X chromosome. Thus, the increase in transcription on the male X chromosome is not driven by increased rates of transcriptional elongation, as has been suggested previously, but must involve up-regulation of transcription initiation."

The best characterized mammalian PITPs are the Class I PITPs, PITPα (PITPNA) and PITPβ (PITPNB), which are single domain proteins with a hydrophobic cavity that binds a phosphatidylinositol (PI) or phosphatidylcholine molecule. In this study, we report the lipid binding properties of an uncharacterized soluble PITP, phosphatidylinositol transfer protein, cytoplasmic 1 (PITPNC1) (alternative name, RdgBβ), of the Class II family. We show that the lipid binding properties of this protein are distinct to Class I PITPs because, besides PI, RdgBβ binds and transfers phosphatidic acid (PA) but hardly binds phosphatidylcholine. RdgBβ when purified from Escherichia coli is preloaded with PA and phosphatidylglycerol. When RdgBβ was incubated with permeabilized HL60 cells, phosphatidylglycerol was released, and PA and PI were now incorporated into RdgBβ. After an increase in PA levels following activation of endogenous phospholipase D or after addition of bacterial phospholipase D, binding of PA to RdgBβ was greater at the expense of PI binding. We propose that RdgBβ, when containing PA, regulates an effector protein or can facilitate lipid transfer between membrane compartments.

Pearce and Moran (p. 984 , published online 19 July) trained two macaques to reach around randomly placed objects in a virtual reality task while simultaneously recording neuronal activity in the premotor cortex. Neurons in the premotor cortex coded for the direction of the hand movement and at the same time also coded other variables, including the position of the hand and the final location of the target. Population vector analyses were able to decode multiple kinematic variables from the neural activity. In one monkey, the population vector was first directed to the target but when the obstacle appeared the population vector rotated. However, the other monkey waited until the obstacle appeared. The differences in the neural planning between these two monkeys suggest different optimization strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2023080456,"TDP2 is a multifunctional enzyme previously known for its role in signal transduction as TRAF and TNF receptor-associated protein (TTRAP) and ETS1-associated protein 2 (EAPII). The gene has recently been renamed TDP2 because it plays a critical role for the repair of topoisomerase II cleavage complexes (Top2cc) and encodes an enzyme that hydrolyzes 5'-tyrosine-DNA adducts that mimic abortive Top2cc. Here we further elucidate the DNA-processing activities of human recombinant TDP2 and its biochemical characteristics. The preferred substrate for TDP2 is single-stranded DNA or duplex DNA with a four-base pair overhang, which is consistent with the known structure of Top2cc or Top3cc. The k(cat)/K(m) of TDP1 and TDP2 was determined. It was found to be 4 × 10(5) s(-1)M(-1) for TDP2 using single-stranded 5'-tyrosyl-DNA. The processing of substrates as short as five nucleotides long suggests that TDP2 can directly bind DNA ends. 5'-Phosphodiesterase activity requires a phosphotyrosyl linkage and tolerates an extended group attached to the tyrosine. TDP2 requires Mg(2+) or Mn(2+) for efficient catalysis but is weakly active with Ca(2+) or Zn(2+). Titration with Ca(2+) demonstrates a two-metal binding site in TDP2. Sequence alignment suggests that TDP2 contains four conserved catalytic motifs shared by Mg(2+)-dependent endonucleases, such as APE1. Substitutions at each of the four catalytic motifs identified key residues Asn-120, Glu-152, Asp-262, and His-351, whose mutation to alanine significantly reduced or completely abolished enzymatic activity. Our study characterizes the substrate specificity and kinetic parameters of TDP2. In addition, a two-metal catalytic mechanism is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2164815006,"Mutations in the SRGAP3 gene residing on chromosome 3p25 have previously been associated with intellectual disability. Genome-wide association studies have also revealed SRGAP3, together with genes from the same cellular network, as risk genes for schizophrenia. SRGAP3 regulates cytoskeletal dynamics through the RHO protein RAC1. RHO proteins are known to be involved in cytoskeletal reorganization during brain development to control processes such as synaptic plasticity. To elucidate the importance of SRGAP3 in brain development, we generated Srgap3-knockout mice. Ten percent of these mice developed a hydrocephalus and died before adulthood. Surviving mice showed various neuroanatomical changes, including enlarged lateral ventricles, white matter tracts, and dendritic spines together with molecular changes, including an increased basal activity of RAC1. Srgap3(-/-) mice additionally exhibited a complex behavioral phenotype. Behavioral studies revealed an impaired spontaneous alternation and social behavior, while long-term memory was unchanged. The animals also had tics. Lower locomotor activity was observed in male Srgap3(-/-) only. Srgap3(-/-) mice showed increased methylphenidate stimulation in males and an impaired prepulse inhibition in females. Together, the results show neurodevelopmental aberration in Srgap3(-/-) mice, with many of the observed phenotypes matching several schizophrenia-related intermediate phenotypes. Mutations of SRGAP3 may thus contribute to various neurodevelopmental disorders."

However, several lines of evidence suggest that MeCP2 not only silences gene expression, but that it is also involved in the activation of transcription. First, in the hypothalamus, lack of MeCP2 leads to reduced expression of thousands of genes (3Chahrour M. Jung S.Y. Shaw C. Zhou X. Wong S.T. Qin J. Zoghbi H.Y. MeCP2, a key contributor to neurological disease, activates and represses transcription.Science. 2008; 320: 1224-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar). Second, MeCP2 may form a complex with the transcriptional activator cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) and can cooperate with CREB in the transactivation of a transfected reporter gene that contains the promoter region of a MeCP2 target gene (3Chahrour M.

MeCP2, a key contributor to neurological disease, activates and represses transcription.Science. 2008; 320: 1224-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation by MeCP2 may also occur via “derepression,” which has been reported to play a role in the regulation of Bdnf expression in rat hippocampal and cortical neurons (4Chen W.G.

Mice that either lack or overexpress MeCP2 develop a phenotype that recapitulates many characteristic features of Rett syndrome, including normal early postnatal development followed by progressive motor and cognitive dysfunctions. In addition, similar to Rett syndrome patients, they show abnormalities in brain morphology and cyto-architecture, in particular a decrease in dendritic arborization and spine loss (8Zhou Z.

However, given the evidence that synaptogenesis and the proper wiring of the nervous system is a neuronal activity-driven process, it has been suggested that MeCP2 may relay neuronal activity patterns in early postnatal development to the transcriptional machinery (16West A.E. Greenberg M.E. Neuronal activity-regulated gene transcription in synapse development and cognitive function.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2011; 3: a005744Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Failure of MeCP2 either to induce appropriate genome-wide chromatin changes or to activate or repress as yet unidentified target genes could lead to malfunction of circuit development, which may ultimately cause neuropsychiatric disorders. According to this concept, signal regulation is a key feature of MeCP2 and indeed critical for proper brain development. The best characterized, inducible post-translational modification of MeCP2 is its phosphorylation on serine 421 (8Zhou Z. Hong E.J. Cohen S. Zhao W.N. Ho H.Y. Schmidt L. Chen W.G. Lin Y. Savner E.

This phosphorylation event is triggered by KCl-induced membrane depolarization or synaptic activity and requires calcium entry through NMDA receptors and/or voltage-gated calcium channels (8Zhou Z.

The calcium-dependent modulation of MeCP2 function suggests that its role in neural circuit development could be mediated by one or several components of a pool of about 1000 genes that are induced or repressed within a few hours following NMDA receptor stimulation and the activation of calcium signaling pathways (18Zhang S.J.

A rAAV vector containing the mouse CaMKII promoter (a gift from Ali Cetin and Peter Seeburg, Max Planck Institute for Medical Research Heidelberg, Germany), was used to generate rAAV-CaMKII(1–290)-Flag, rAAV-CaMKII(1–290)NLS-Flag, and rAAV-CaMKVI(1–313)NLS-Flag. rAAV vectors were generated by standard molecular biology techniques and verified by sequencing.

Depending on the experimental conditions, hippocampal neurons were infected after DIV 3 at multiplicities of infection of 2 × 109 copies/ml and harvested at DIV 10. Total RNA was isolated at DIV 10 from hippocampal primary neuron cultures with the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) including an optional DNase I treatment at room temperature for 15 min according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). cDNAs were synthesized from 1.3 μg of total RNA using the High Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was done on an ABI7300 thermal cycler using universal quantitative reverse transcription-PCR master mix with TaqMan gene expression assays for the indicated genes (Applied Biosystems). The following TaqMan gene expression assays were used in this study: Gapdh (Mm99999915_m1), Gusb (Mm00446953_m1), and Bdnf (Mm00432069_m1). The expression of target genes was normalized against the expression of Gusb and Gapdh as endogenous control genes using the ΔΔCt method. Data represent mean value (±S.E.) from at least four independent experiments. The following primers were used to detect exon-specific Bdnf expression by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR using Power SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems): Bdnf promoter I, forward, 5′-AACAAGACACATTACCTTCCAGCAT-3′, reverse, 5′CTCTTCTCACCTGGTGGAACATT-3′; Bdnf promoter IV, forward: 5′-GCTGCCTTGATGTTTACTTTGA-3′, reverse, 5′-GCAACCGAAGTATGAAATAACC-3′. The following cycling conditions were used: 95 °C for 10 min followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, annealing temperature 55 °C for 10 s. Melting curve analysis was performed at the end of each reaction to confirm amplification of a single PCR product. All reactions were performed in duplicate. The expression of Bdnf was normalized to the expression of Hprt1 (forward, 5′-CAGTCCCAGCGTCGTGATTA-3′, reverse, 5′-AGCAAGTCTTTCAGTCCTGTC-3′) as endogenous control using the ΔΔCt method (28Kairisalo M.

Nuclear protein extraction was performed using a QproteomeTM nuclear protein extraction kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cytosolic and nuclear extracts were acetone-precipitated, and equal amounts were quantified by Western blot analysis. Expression of endogenous and recombinant proteins was detected by indirect immunofluorescence staining using standard protocol. In brief, hippocampal neurons were fixed at DIV 10 in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in methanol, blocked in 10% normal goat serum in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and stained with the following primary (overnight at 4 °C) and secondary antibodies (1 h at room temperature): rabbit anti-FLAG polyclonal (1:1000, Sigma), goat anti-CaMKIIα (1:250, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-5391), goat anti-CaMKIIβ (1:250, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-1540), goat anti-CaMKIIγ (1:250; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-1541), goat anti-CaMKIIδ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-5392), rabbit anti-MeCP2 (1:500, Millipore), rabbit anti-MeCP2pS421 (1:500, a gift from Michael E.

Counterstain of nuclei was done with Hoechst (1:5000, Serva). Samples were mounted in Mowiol. Stained samples were analyzed using a CCD camera (Spot Insight 2; Visitron Systems, Puchheim, Germany). Standard protocols for immunoblot analysis were used to detect the expression and/or phosphorylation of the indicated proteins. Antibodies against the following proteins and/or their phosphorylated forms were used: ATF3, CaMKIIα, CaMKIIβ, CaMKIIγ, CaMKIIδ, and SP1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); histone H3 (Abcam); dsRED (Clontech); hrGFP (Stratagene), FLAG, and tubulin (Sigma); MeCP2 and pCREB (Upstate Biotech Millipore); CREB and pERK1/2 (Cell Signaling); and MeCP2pS421. Immunoblot analysis of endogenously expressed tubulin was used to control for protein loading. Hippocampal neurons were loaded with 3.4 μm Fluo-3 AM (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) in the dark for 20 min at room temperature in buffered, CO2-independent, salt-glucose-glycine solution containing (in mm) 140.1 NaCl, 5.3 KCl, 1.0 MgCl2, 2.0 CaCl2, 10.0 Hepes (pH 7.4), 1.0 glycine, 30.0 glucose, and 0.5 sodium pyruvate. Hippocampal neurons were incubated for another 20 min in the darkness in salt-glucose-glycine. Fluo-3 signals of neurons mounted in a perfusion chamber (Life Imaging Services, Reinach, Switzerland) were measured at room temperature in salt-glucose-glycine using an inverted Leica SP2 confocal microscope with an HCX PL APO CS 40.0 × 1.25 NA oil UV objective (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Images were taken every 1.635 s. To calibrate the fluorescence signal (F), Fluo-3 was saturated by adding 50 μm ionomycin (Fmax) (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, München, Germany) and then quenched with MnCl2 (Fmin). [Ca2+] was expressed as a function of the Fluo-3 fluorescence Kd × ((F − Fmin)/(Fmax − F)) (29Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y.

All data plotted in histograms represent the means ± S.E. One-way analysis of variance with Tukey's post hoc test was used for all statistical analysis. To investigate the role of nuclear calcium signaling in the regulation of MeCP2 phosphorylation on serine 421, we infected primary mouse hippocampal neurons with an rAAV containing an expression cassette for CaMBP4 (rAAV-CaMBP4-Flag). CaMBP4 is a nuclear protein that contains four repeats of the M13 calmodulin-binding peptide from the skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase; it binds to and inactivates the nuclear calcium/CaM complex (30Wang J.

Expression of CaMBP4, as well as that of hrGFP after infection with rAAV-CaMBP4 and rAAV-hrGFP, was readily detectable immunocytochemically in 80–95% of the viable cells (Fig. 1A). The correct size proteins were also detected in immunoblots (Fig. 1B). Neither expression of CaMBP4 after infection with rAAV-CaMBP4-Flag nor infection with the rAAV vector alone (rAAV-empty) interfered with the ability of the neurons to generate robust intracellular calcium transients following the induction of bursts of action potential (AP) firing (Fig. 1C). To induce AP bursting, we exposed the cultures to the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline; this led to the removal of tonic inhibition from the network, giving rise to periodically occurring"

Here we use 125I-EGF binding to quantitate the interaction of the EGF receptor with ErbB2. We show that the EGFR/ErbB2 heterodimer binds EGF with a 7-fold higher affinity than the EGFR homodimer. Because it cannot bind a second ligand, the EGFR/ErbB2 heterodimer is not subject to ligand-induced dissociation caused by the negatively cooperative binding of EGF to the second site on the EGFR homodimer. This increases the stability of the heterodimer relative to the homodimer and is associated with enhanced and prolonged EGF receptor autophosphorylation. These effects are independent of the kinase activity of ErbB2 but require back-to-back dimerization of the EGF receptor with ErbB2. Back-to-back dimerization is also required for phosphorylation of ErbB2. These findings provide a molecular explanation for the apparent preference of the EGF receptor for dimerizing with ErbB2 and suggest that the phosphorylation of ErbB2 occurs largely in the context of the EGFR/ErbB2 heterodimer, rather than through lateral phosphorylation of isolated ErbB2 subunits.

These generalizations have been based in most part on experiments utilizing gene expression analyses of cell lines and tumor tissue. To assess the relevance of these generalizations to a native mammalian tissue, we used isolated human and rodent pancreatic islets to examine interleukin (IL)-1β-induced PGE2 production, because PGE2 has been shown to mediate IL-1β inhibition of islet function. Rat islets constitutively expressed mRNAs of COX-1, COX-2, cPGES, and mPGES-1. As expected, IL-1β increased mRNA levels for COX-2 and mPGES-1, but not for COX-1 or cPGES. Basal protein levels of COX-1, cPGES, and mPGES-2 were readily detected in whole cell extracts but were not regulated by IL-1β. IL-1β increased protein levels of COX-2, but unexpectedly mPGES-1 protein levels were low and unaffected.

https://openalex.org/W2075066102,"Our aim was to employ novel analytical methods to investigate the therapeutic treatment of the energy regulation dysfunction occurring in a Huntington disease (HD) mouse model. HD is a neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by progressive motor impairment and cognitive alterations. Changes in neuroendocrine function, body weight, energy metabolism, euglycemia, appetite function, and gut function can also occur. It is likely that the locus of these alterations is the hypothalamus. We determined the effects of three different euglycemic agents on HD progression using standard physiological and transcriptomic signature analyses. N171-82Q HD mice were treated with insulin, Exendin-4, and the newly developed GLP-1-Tf to determine whether these agents could improve energy regulation and delay disease progression. Blood glucose, insulin, metabolic hormone levels, and pancreatic morphology were assessed. Hypothalamic gene transcription, motor coordination, and life span were also determined. The N171-82Q mice exhibited significant alterations in hypothalamic gene transcription signatures and energy metabolism that were ameliorated, to varying degrees, by the different euglycemic agents. Exendin-4 or GLP-1-Tf (but not insulin) treatment also improved pancreatic morphology, motor coordination, and increased life span. Using hypothalamic transcription signature analyses, we found that the physiological efficacy variation of the drugs was evident in the degree of reversal of the hypothalamic HD pathological signature. Euglycemic agents targeting hypothalamic and energy regulation dysfunction in HD could potentially alter disease progression and improve quality of life in HD."

As a transcription factor, AP-1 is commonly found as a heterodimer comprised of c-Jun and c-Fos proteins. However, other heterodimers may also be formed. The function of these dimers, specifically the heterodimeric AP-1 comprised of JunD and c-Fos (AP-1(JunD/c-Fos)), has not been elucidated. Here, we identified a function of AP-1(JunD/c-Fos) in Xenopus hematopoiesis. A gain-of-function study performed by overexpressing junD and c-fos and a loss-of-function study using morpholino junD demonstrate a critical role for AP-1(JunD/c-Fos) in hematopoiesis during Xenopus embryogenesis. Additionally, we confirmed that JunD of AP-1(JunD/c-Fos) is required for BMP-4-induced hematopoiesis. We also demonstrated that BMP-4 regulated JunD activity at the transcriptional regulation and post-translational modification levels. Collectively, our findings identify AP-1(JunD/c-Fos) as a novel hematopoietic transcription factor and the requirement of AP-1(JunD/c-Fos) in BMP-4-induced hematopoiesis during Xenopus hematopoiesis."

Catalase-peroxidases are homodimeric oxidoreductases with each subunit being composed of N- and C-terminal domains with a close sequence and structural relationship with Class I peroxidases of the peroxidase-catalase superfamily (e.g. cytochrome c peroxidases, ascorbate peroxidases, and hybrid peroxidases of type A and B) (6Zámocký M. Furtmüller P.G. Obinger C. Evolution of structure and function of Class I peroxidases.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2010; 500: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, only the N-terminal domain of KatGs contains a heme cavity that is very similar to that of cytochrome c peroxidase and ascorbate peroxidases except for some crucial modifications required for the catalatic activity including the distal +Met-Tyr-Trp adduct, which is formed post-translationally (5Smulevich G.

The KatG-specific adduct participates in redox chemistry, and its reactivity appears to be regulated by a fully conserved mobile arginine that can adopt two pH-dependent conformations (10Carpena X.

The unique catalytic properties of KatGs present a fascinating system in which to study how the protein framework can modulate catalysis at the heme center of heme enzymes. Catalase-peroxidases are widespread in archaea and bacteria with about 40% of the bacteria possessing katG genes, often chaotically distributed among species (12Passardi F. Zamocky M. Favet J. Jakopitsch C. Penel C. Obinger C. Dunand C. Phylogenetic distribution of catalase-peroxidases: are there patches of order in chaos?.Gene. 2007; 397: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The catalase-peroxidase family, currently with 479 annotated sequences (PeroxiBase), is phylogenetically located at the origin of the peroxidase-catalase superfamily (6Zámocký M. Furtmüller P.G. Obinger C. Evolution of structure and function of Class I peroxidases.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2010; 500: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), formerly known as the superfamily of bacterial, fungal, and plant peroxidases, now containing over 6,700 annotated sequences. The superfamily most probably evolved from an ancestor of KatG, and phylogenetic reconstruction (Fig. 1a) suggests several lateral gene transfers (across the whole gene family) in addition to frequent duplication events (6Zámocký M. Furtmüller P.G. Obinger C. Evolution of structure and function of Class I peroxidases.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2010; 500: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 12Passardi F. Zamocky M.

Phylogenetic distribution of catalase-peroxidases: are there patches of order in chaos?.Gene. 2007; 397: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Following the acquisition of katG genes by ancient ascomycete fungi via horizontal gene transfer from Bacteroidetes (1Zamocky M. Obinger C. Molecular phylogeny of heme peroxidases.in: Torres E. Ayala M. Biocatalysis Based on Heme Peroxidases. Springer, Berlin2010: 7-35Google Scholar, 6Zámocký M. Furtmüller P.G. Obinger C. Evolution of structure and function of Class I peroxidases.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2010; 500: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the evolution of eukaryotic KatGs proceeded toward the dominant Clade 1, whereas evolution of the mixed archaeal and protistan Clade 2 occurred in a different way (Fig. 1a). Currently, the nonsecreted or intracellular KatG1s are found in nonpathogenic and pathogenic fungi (13Zámocký M. Furtmüller P.G. Obinger C. Two distinct groups of fungal catalase/peroxidases.Biochem.

During the last decade, KatGs from prokaryotes have been extensively investigated including the elucidation of the crystal structures of an archaeal and three bacterial enzymes (19Yamada Y. Fujiwara T. Sato T. Igarashi N. Tanaka N. The 2.0 Å crystal structure of catalase-peroxidase from Haloarcula marismortui.Nat. Struct.

To date, only a small number of biochemical studies of eukaryotic fungal catalase-peroxidases have been reported, mainly focused on the intracellular KatG1 from Neurospora crassa (NcKatG1, originally named CAT-2) (22Peraza L. Hansberg W. Neurospora crassa catalases, singlet oxygen, and cell differentiation.Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 569-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea (MagKatG1) (14Zamocky M. Furtmüller P.G. Bellei M. Battistuzzi G. Stadlmann J. Vlasits J. Obinger C. Intracellular catalase/peroxidase from the phytopathogenic rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea: expression analysis and biochemical characterization of the recombinant protein.Biochem. J. 2009; 418: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Recently, the first biochemical data about the secreted KatG2 from M. grisea (MagKatG2) have been reported (15Zámocký M. Droghetti E. Bellei M. Gasselhuber B. Pabst M. Furtmüller P.G. Battistuzzi G. Smulevich G. Obinger C. Eukaryotic extracellular catalase-peroxidase from Magnaporthe grisea: biophysical/chemical characterization of the first representative from a novel phytopathogenic KatG group.Biochimie. 2012; 94: 673-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Here we extend the characterization of MagKatG2 with the report of its crystal structure, the first of an eukaryotic catalase-peroxidase, at 1.55 Å resolution. It is similar in many respects to prokaryotic and archaebacterial KatGs but presents in addition a number of novel features that are fully conserved in secretory KatGs. These data are discussed with respect to the putative physiological role of secretory catalase-peroxidases in phytopathogenic organisms. Recombinant catalase-peroxidases (wild-type MagKatG2 and single and double mutants) were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 StarTM (DE3) (Invitrogen) and purified to homogeneity as described previously (15Zámocký M. Droghetti E. Bellei M. Gasselhuber B. Pabst M. Furtmüller P.G. Battistuzzi G. Smulevich G. Obinger C.

Briefly, the inducible expression with 0.5% lactose overnight at 16 °C yielded on average 30 mg of soluble KatG2 per liter of M9ZL medium supplemented with hemin (75 μm final concentration). After homogenization by four ultrasonication cycles, the crude homogenate was centrifuged for 20 min at 45,000 × g, and the clear supernatant was loaded onto a 30-ml column of chelating Sepharose fast flow (GE Healthcare) charged with Ni2+ ions. His-tagged protein (with added protease inhibitors PMSF and leupeptin) was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–500 mm imidazole in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl. Subsequent purification by hydroxyapatite column separated the high-spin heme fractions (15Zámocký M. Droghetti E. Bellei M. Gasselhuber B. Pabst M. Furtmüller P.G. Battistuzzi G. Smulevich G. Obinger C.

Droghetti E. Bellei M. Gasselhuber B. Pabst M. Furtmüller P.G. Battistuzzi G. Smulevich G. Obinger C.

Dimeric protein fractions were concentrated up to 11 mg/ml in Centriprep 50K in 5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and used for crystallization studies. For protein electrophoresis, NuPAGE Novex Bis-Tris gradient gels (4–12%) or homogeneous 12% gels (Invitrogen) were used. Running buffer was MOPS-SDS, and the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Sigma-Aldrich). Point mutations in the cloned M. grisea katG2 gene were introduced with a PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis protocol using two complementary oligonucleotides with the planned mutation in the middle of their sequence. The PCR program included initial denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min, 16 cycles; 20 s at 98 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, 4 min at 72 °C; and a final amplification for 5 min at 72 °C (KAPAHifi DNA polymerase from PEQLAB Biotechnologie). Resulting DNA was cut with endonuclease DpnI (New England Biolabs) to remove the methylated, nonmutated DNA, and the purified mutated DNA was transformed into competent E. coli BL21-DE3-Star cells. Sequencing (LGC Genomics) confirmed the presence of only the planned mutation(s). A DNA segment encoding the C-terminal domain of MagKatG2 was synthesized, codon-optimized for E. coli expression, at GenScript Inc. (Piscataway, NJ). The 944-bp-long NdeI-NotI region was cloned into pET21a (Novagen), and heterologous expression was achieved in M9ZL medium (15Zámocký M. Droghetti E. Bellei M. Gasselhuber B. Pabst M. Furtmüller P.G.

Purification to homogeneity succeeded under the same conditions as described for complete MagKatG2 (15Zámocký M. Droghetti E. Bellei M. Gasselhuber B. Pabst M. Furtmüller P.G. Battistuzzi G.

Crystals of MagKatG2 were obtained using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method at 4 °C with a protein concentration of 5 mg/ml in 5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. The mother liquor contained 15% PEG4000, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.6. At beam line ID23eh1 (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), Grenoble), diffraction data up to 1.55 Å were obtained using a flash-cooled crystal in a cryoprotectant solution, which contained an increased concentration of PEG4000 (35%). Data processed using the HKL package (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter Jr., C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology. Vol. 276, part A. Academic Press, New York1997: 307-326Google Scholar) corresponded to space group P212121 with unit cell parameters a = 103.0 Å, b = 109.6 Å, c = 132.3 Å. Using MOLREP (24Vagin A.A. Teplyakov A. MOLREP: an automated program for molecular replacement.J. Appl.

The protein structure was then refined at 1.55 Å resolution using REFMAC (25Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J.

Open table in a new tab Thermal denaturation of MagKatG2 and its point mutants was monitored using DSC. All DSC measurements were performed on VP-DSC MicroCal LLC equipment from GE Healthcare. Protein concentration of all samples was either 5 μm or 10 μm. The temperature profile was recorded between 20 and 90 °C with a scan speed of 1 °C/min. The samples contained 0.5 m urea to avoid protein aggregation at higher temperatures. The results were evaluated and fitted with Origin 7.0 software (OriginLab). UV-visible spectra of recombinant KatGs were recorded with a Hitachi U-3900 spectrophotometer in the range 200–800 nm at 25 °C. The molar absorption coefficient of the ferric, high-spin MagKatG2 at Soret maximum (λ404 nm = 102,600 m−1 cm−1) was determined recently (15Zámocký M. Droghetti E. Bellei M. Gasselhuber B. Pabst M.

Apparent bimolecular rate constants of cyanide complex formation were determined by conventional stopped-flow spectroscopy (SX-18MV from Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK) as described previously (15Zámocký M.

Determination of the enzymatic parameters of the catalase activity was performed as described previously (14Zamocky M. Furtmüller P.G. Bellei M. Battistuzzi G. Stadlmann J. Vlasits J. Obinger C.

Unfolding of MagKatG2 by urea was followed by fluorescence spectroscopy using a Hitachi F-7000 fluorometer equipped with a thermostatic cell holder. A quartz cuvette of 10-mm path length was used to monitor changes of intrinsic tryptophan emission. The following parameters were used: excitation wavelength, 295 nm; emission wavelength range, 300–360 nm; excitation and emission bandwidth, 5 nm; photomultiplier tubes voltage, 400 V; scan speed, 60 nm/min. The final protein concentration for these measurements was 0.5 μm, and all samples prepared in 5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, were incubated with increasing concentrations of urea ranging from 0 to 8 m. After incubation for 18 h at 25 °C, the tryptophan emission spectra were recorded. Electronic circular dichroism spectra were recorded on a Chirascan equipped with a thermostatically controlled cell holder (Applied Photophysics). For recording far-UV spectra, the quartz cuvette had a path length of 1 mm, and for recording visible spectra, a cuvette with a path length of 10 mm was used. To monitor the thermal unfolding, 5.8 μm KatG samples were incubated in 5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.5 m urea (nondenaturing concentration (28Vidossich P. Alfonso-Prieto M. Carpena X. Loewen P.C. Fita I. Rovira C. Versatility of the electronic structure of compound I in catalase-peroxidases.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 13436-13446Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar)) with stepwise increasing temperature ranging from 20 to 90 °C. The instrument was flushed with nitrogen with a flow rate of 5 liters min−1. The instrument allowed simultaneous UV/visible and electronic circular dichroism monitoring and was equipped with a Peltier element for temperature control. In the near-UV and visible region (250–500 nm), instrument parameters were set as follows: path length, 10 mm; spectral bandwidth, 1 nm; step size, 1 nm; scan time per point, 0.5 s (scan period, 25 μs × 20,000 counts); scan time, ∼125 s. In addition, single wavelength scans were performed with the instrumental parameters set as follows: spectral bandwidth, 1 nm (Soret) or 0.5 (far-UV); scan time per point, 12 s; stepwise temperature increase (1 °C) with 2 min incubation time. Orthorhombic crystals of MagKatG2 confirm the dimeric structure common to KatGs with two subunits in the asymmetric unit. The electron density maps clearly define the main and side chains of residues Thr-51–Val-782 from the two subunits. The final model, which also includes two heme b groups and 1,616 water molecules, has crystallographic agreement R and Rfree factors of 19.7 and 22.0% for 199,450 reflections at 1.55 Å resolution (Table 1). Both the structure of subunits as well as the organization in the molecular dimer are similar to prokaryotic KatGs (13Zámocký M. Furtmüller P.G. Obinger C.

https://openalex.org/W2033668224,"Lipoxygenases (LOXs) contain a hydrophobic substrate channel with the conserved Gly/Ala determinant of regio- and stereospecificity and a conserved Leu residue near the catalytic non-heme iron. Our goal was to study the importance of this region (Gly(332), Leu(336), and Phe(337)) of a lipoxygenase with catalytic manganese (13R-MnLOX). Recombinant 13R-MnLOX oxidizes 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3 to 13R-, 11(S or R)-, and 9S-hydroperoxy metabolites (∼80-85, 15-20, and 2-3%, respectively) by suprafacial hydrogen abstraction and oxygenation. Replacement of Phe(337) with Ile changed the stereochemistry of the 13-hydroperoxy metabolites of 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3 (from ∼100% R to 69-74% S) with little effect on regiospecificity. The abstraction of the pro-S hydrogen of 18:2n-6 was retained, suggesting antarafacial hydrogen abstraction and oxygenation. Replacement of Leu(336) with smaller hydrophobic residues (Val, Ala, and Gly) shifted the oxygenation from C-13 toward C-9 with formation of 9S- and 9R-hydroperoxy metabolites of 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3. Replacement of Gly(332) and Leu(336) with larger hydrophobic residues (G332A and L336F) selectively augmented dehydration of 13R-hydroperoxyoctadeca-9Z,11E,15Z-trienoic acid and increased the oxidation at C-13 of 18:1n-6. We conclude that hydrophobic replacements of Leu(336) can modify the hydroperoxide configurations at C-9 with little effect on the R configuration at C-13 of the 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3 metabolites. Replacement of Phe(337) with Ile changed the stereospecific oxidation of 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3 with formation of 13S-hydroperoxides by hydrogen abstraction and oxygenation in analogy with soybean LOX-1."

The extracellular domain (ECD) of human TLR9 (hTLR9) is composed of 25 leucine-rich repeats (LRR) contributing to the binding of CpG ODN. Herein, we showed that among LRR2, -5, -8, and -11, LRR11 of hTLR9 had the highest affinity for CpG ODN followed by LRR2 and -5, whereas LRR8 had almost no affinity. In vitro, preincubation with LRR11 more significantly decreased CpG ODN internalization, subsequent NF-κB activation, and cytokine release than with LRR2 and -5 in mouse peritoneal macrophages treated with CpG ODN. The LRR11 deletion mutant of hTLR9 conferred decreased cellular responses to CpG ODN. Single- or multiple-site mutants at five positively charged residues of LRR11 (LRR11m1–9), especially Arg-337 and Lys-367, were shown to contribute to hTLR9 binding of CpG ODN. LRR11m1–9 showed reduced inhibition of CpG ODN internalization and CpG ODN/TLR9 signaling, supporting the above findings. Prediction of whole hTLR9 ECD-CpG ODN interactions revealed that Arg-337 and Lys-338 directly contact CpG ODN through hydrogen bonding, whereas Lys-347, Arg-348, and His-353 contribute to stabilizing the shape of the ligand binding region. These findings suggested that although all five positively charged residues within LRR11 contributed to its high affinity, only Arg-337 and Lys-338 directly interacted with CpG ODN. In conclusion, the results suggested that LRR11 could strongly bind to CpG ODN, whereas mutations at the five positively charge residues reduced this high affinity. LRR11 may be further investigated as an antagonist of hTLR9. TLR9 is a receptor for sensing bacterial DNA/CpG-containing oligonucleotides (CpG ODN).

https://openalex.org/W2037047823,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress develops when the ER is overloaded with too many proteins to fold. This elicits a signaling pathway called the unfolded protein response. The unfolded protein response is physiologically required for the terminal development of B cells into antibody-secreting plasma cells. Ring Box Protein 1 (RBX1) is a 14-kDa protein necessary for ubiquitin ligation activity of the multimeric cullin ring ubiquitin ligases (CRLs). As RBX1 is shared by a large number of CRLs, alterations in its activity may lead to global changes in protein stability. We discovered that RBX1 is cleaved in the course of LPS-induced plasma cell differentiation and in multiple myeloma cell lines upon induction of pharmacological ER stress. The cleavage is executed by several caspase proteases that cleave RBX1 eight amino acids from the N terminus. To address the possible implication of RBX1 cleavage for CRL activity, we replaced the endogenous RBX1 homolog of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Roc1, with the wild type or the N-terminal Δ8 mutant human RBX1. We show that yeast expressing the cleaved RBX1 are hypersensitive to ER stress and are impaired in CRL-mediated ubiquitination and degradation. We propose a model by which N-terminal cleavage of RBX1 impairs its activity and promotes susceptibility to ER stress induction.

https://openalex.org/W2009601311,"Studies with perfused frog heart in the late 1880s led Sydney Ringer (1) first to identify the essential role of the divalent cation Ca2+ in cardiac muscle contraction. It was a landmark observation that failed to receive the immediate attention it deserved: over the following 60 or 70 years, it was followed only by a handful of scattered findings that confirmed that Ca2+, in addition to its acknowledged structural role in bones and teeth, also has a general role as a carrier of biological signals. It was not until the 1940s that this concept gained momentum with fundamental discoveries on the contraction of muscles by Heilbrunn (2) and by Bailey (3), followed subsequently by the demonstration of the active transport of Ca2+ across the membranes of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria by Vasington and Murphy (4), DeLuca and Engstrom (5), Hasselbach and Makinose (6), and Ebashi and Lipmann (7). Ebashi's subsequent landmark discovery of troponin C (8, 9) as the calcium-binding component of the muscle protein troponin provided the molecular basis for decoding the Ca2+ message by specific binding proteins. This observation was instrumental in making Ca2+ signaling one of the most important and most intensively studied areas of cell research.

Through the decades that followed the 1960s, it became clear that Ca2+ is a major regulatory signal in all eukaryotic cells, being involved in regulating such fundamental processes as cell fertilization, movement, growth, and proliferation; neurotransmission; energy metabolism; gene transcription; and programmed cell death. The actions of calcium have been shown to be mediated by many specific, high affinity calcium-binding proteins structurally related to troponin C and by other proteins such as protein kinase C and calpain that bind and process the Ca2+ signal through distinct binding motifs. These intracellular calcium receptors are in turn regulated by elaborate systems for modulating cytosolic free calcium concentrations through the action of calcium channels that admit calcium into the cytosol and calcium pumps and translocases that remove or sequester it. Calcium transporters in the plasma membrane allow communication with the extracellular space, whereas those in internal membranes permit emptying and refilling of internal stores used for calcium signal generation.

Recent advances in elucidating the structural features of calcium channels, pumps, and translocases have provided a greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which the movement of Ca2+ is mediated, as well as the basis for understanding how mutations in them are linked to Ca2+ signaling disorders. The minireviews in the series entitled “Ins and Outs of Calcium Transport” will explore recent advances in understanding these structural details. A second related series entitled “Calcium Function and Disease” will explore recent advances in understanding the linkages between known calcium signaling systems and disease processes in animals."
