https://openalex.org/W2072389568,"Pairs of neurons which inhibit each other can produce regular alternating bursts of impulses if they also exhibit postinhibitory rebound (PIR). Computer studies show that stable patterns occur spontaneously in systems of pacemaker neurons with PIR, and can be triggered in systems of nonpacemakers without requiring tonic excitation. The repetition rates of these patterns are determined largely by the PIR parameters. The patterns resist perturbation by phasic synaptic inputs, but can be modulated or turned off by tonic inputs. One pair of PIR neurons can be entrained by another pair with a different repetition rate to produce more complex firing patterns."

https://openalex.org/W2017658729,"Lassa fever is a severe febrile illness of man, first recognized in West Africa in 1969. During an epidemic in Sierra Leone, Lassa virus was isolated for the first time from wild rodents of Mastomys natalensis. A high prevalence of infected Mastomys was found in houses occupied by patients with Lassa fever. The data presented provide the first demonstration of an extra-human cycle of Lassa virus transmission and suggest that rodent control may be an effective method of limiting the disease."

The peak pressure level of these transients, measured within the audible frequency band as a function of the microwave pulse parameters, is adequate to explain the ""clicks"" heard by people exposed to microwave radiation."

https://openalex.org/W1566826363,"SUMMARY The divalent cation ionophore A-23187 increased the rate of enzyme secretion in the rat pancreas. As in the secretion induced through the cholinergic receptor, the ionophore causes a specific secretion of digestive enzymes which re- quires calcium in the medium and is dependent on efficient ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation. It is sug- gested that the activation of the cholinergic receptor intro- duces calcium into the cell to act as a second messenger in the process of enzyme secretion. Secretion of digestive enzymes from exocrine glands was ex- tensively studied in the pancreas (I-3) and parotid gland (4, 5). These studies revealed that enzyme secretion operates via two major pathways: the one in the pancreas, which is Ca”+-de- pendent and involves cholinergic and peptide hormone receptors (6, 7), and the second in the parotid, which does not depend on the presence of Ca2+ in the medium and operates via a P-adre- nergic receptor and adenosine 3’: 5’.monophosphate (5). We have recently found that in the parot)id, epinephrine, which causes enzyme secretion through a fi-adrenergic receptor, also acts on an ol-adrenergic receptor causing a Ca2+-dependent K+ release (8). Using a rat parotid slice system, we also showed that calcium, acting through the divalent cation ionophore A-23187, mimics the cy-adrenergic response while having. little effect on enzyme secretion (9). The ionophore A-23187, first described by Reed and Lardy (lo), has been found useful in probing the effect of CaZf m various tissues (11). In the presence of Ca2+ it causes K+ release from rat erythrocytes"

https://openalex.org/W2010896961,Microbodies characterized by a single limiting membrane and finely granular matrix occur in mouse myocardium and appear in close spatial relation to mitochondria and sarcoplasmic reticulum. The presence of catalase in the microbodies is revealed cytochemically and confirmed biochemically by direct measurement of its activity in myocardial tissue fractions. It is suggested that the microbodies may play an important role in myocardial lipid metabolism.

https://openalex.org/W1605459273,"Abstract The heterogeneity of the lysine-rich histone from several mammalian cells has been studied. The molecules were cleaved with N-bromosuccinimide and separated into three fractions by exclusion chromatography. The three fractions were Fraction 1, the NH2-terminal peptide of molecular weight ∼6000 which proved to be highly heterogeneous upon electrophoretic analysis; Fraction 2, the COOH-terminal fragment, which consists of two molecular weight groups (14,500 and 15,500), both of which are additionally heterogeneous as was deduced from tryptic fingerprinting and analysis of arginine-containing peptides; and Fraction 3, a protein which had the same molecular weight as the intact, unreacted lysine-rich histone. However, it did contain a spirolactone and we deduce that it is the product of an abnormal N-bromosuccinimide cleavage reaction. It shows the same type of electrophoretic heterogeneity as is seen for unreacted histone."

https://openalex.org/W1982225097,"The chick ciliary ganglion receives a nonvascular symathetic innervation in addition to the well-known cholinergic one; fluorescent, varicose adrenergic fibers form pericelluar baskets. Adrenergic fibes were identified electron microscopically in ganglia fixed with potassium permanganate. The fibers degenerate after injection of 6-hydroxydopamine. No true synaptic relationships involving adrenergic varicosities and ganglion cells or cholinergic terminals were demonstrable. The distribution of the adrenergic fibers suggests a kind of ""distance à synapse"" with the choroidal cells or with the preganglionic fibers (or both). The adrenergic innervation might provide a modulation of the cholinergic transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2084117274,The altered gelation behavior found in mixtures of sickle cell hemoglobin with other hemoglobins is due to the formation of hybrid hemoglobin tetramers from unlike dimers. The hemoglobins need not possess the deoxy quaternary structure for gelation to occur; liganded forms are also capable of participation in gelation.

https://openalex.org/W2037912341,"THE time intervals of consequence in music range from about 50 ms, the fastest that notes may be separately fingered on the piano, to about 1 s, the tempo of slow largo. Poetry is customarily recited with beats every 600–800 ms, and the semi-isochronous stresses of speech rhythm are, according to Classe, of the order of 600 ms apart1. We take pride in the accuracy with which we can produce and appreciate these intervals or deviate from them at will. That we require an auditory information storage of brief duration, briefer than that customarily named short-term memory, is known, Neisser calling it echoic memory2; but, as distinct from our other kinds of memory which memorise events in rank order of occurrence only, what our talent for music and speech shows is that in this brief storage we possess, with a working range of a second or so, a comprehension of those things we have just heard, arranged quite accurately in true time relationship."

Before exposure to noise, this auditory response is invariant within the range of temperatures employed. The mechanism of reduction of cochlear response appears to involve processes sensitive to body temperature."

https://openalex.org/W2095043321,"Cigarette smooke contains high concentrations of unstable moleculles that react with oxygen to produce chemiluminescence. The chemiluminescent activity is concentrated in the aerosol phase that can be absorbed on glass-fiber filters and extracted into organic solvents. Cigarette smnoke in N, N-dimethylformamide produces a long-lasting luminescence visible to the dark-adapted eye. We have demonstrated the oxygen dependence and have measured the kinetics, activation energies, emission spectra, and absolute photon intensities of this chemiluminescence. The total light emission from a single puff (35 cubic centimeters) of cigarette smoke is greater than 10(12) photons. There was a significant correlation between smoke chemiluminescence anSd tar content. It is suggested that the chemical production of electronically excited states of aromatic hydrocarbons is equivalent to photoexcitation in the promotion of the carcinogenicity of these agents."
