Treatment of various preadipocyte cell lines with micromolar concentrations of indomethacin in the presence of insulin promotes their terminal differentiation. However, the molecular basis for the adipogenic actions of indomethacin had remained unclear. In this report, we show that indomethacin binds and activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), a ligand-activated transcription factor known to play a pivotal role in adipogenesis. The concentration of indomethacin required to activate PPARγ is in good agreement with that required to induce the differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells to adipocytes. We demonstrate that several other NSAIDs, including fenoprofen, ibuprofen, and flufenamic acid, are also PPARγ ligands and induce adipocyte differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells. Finally, we show that the same NSAIDs that activate PPARγ are also efficacious activators of PPARα, a liver-enriched PPAR subtype that plays a key role in peroxisome proliferation. Interestingly, several NSAIDs have been reported to induce peroxisomal activity in hepatocytes both in vitro and in vivo Our findings define a novel group of PPARγ ligands and provide a molecular basis for the biological effects of these drugs on adipogenesis and peroxisome activity.

The molecular basis for the therapeutic actions of NSAIDs is believed to be their ability to inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) activity and thereby block the production of prostaglandins (PGs). Two COX enzymes have been identified. COX-1 is constitutively expressed, and the PGs produced by this enzyme are thought to function in the so-called housekeeping functions of the cell; in contrast, the COX-2 isozyme is an inducible enzyme that is normally absent from cells but is expressed in response to growth factors, tumor promoters, and cytokines (2DeWitt D. Smith W.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 345-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Most of the NSAIDs inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2, although they vary in their relative potencies against the two COX isozymes (3Mitchell J.A. Akaraereenont P. Thiemermann C. Flower R.J. Vane J.R.

Indomethacin is also widely used as a research tool to study the process of adipocyte differentiation. While there is at least one report of indomethacin blocking adipocyte differentiation (4Negrel R. Gaillard D. Ailhaud G. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 399-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), treatment of several preadipocyte cell lines with this drug results in their terminal differentiation (5Williams I.H. Polakis S.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 77: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 6Verrando P. Negrel R. Grimaldi P. Murphy M. Ailhaud G. Biochim. Biophys.

Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 36-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Early reports suggested that indomethacin might function as an adipogenic agent through its inhibition of COX activity. However, two lines of evidence indicate that the adipogenic activity of indomethacin cannot simply be ascribed to the inhibition of COX. First, the concentration of drug required to induce differentiation is 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than that required to inhibit COX activity, and second, several NSAIDs that inhibit COX activity fail to induce adipocyte differentiation (7Knight D.M. Chapman A.B. Navre M. Drinkwater L. Bruno J.J. Ringold G.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 36-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanism underlying the adipogenic activity of indomethacin has remained obscure. Insight into the molecular mechanisms responsible for adipocyte differentiation was recently provided by the identification of a ligand-activated transcription factor, termed PPARγ, as a key regulator of adipogenesis (8Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3133) Google Scholar). PPARγ, a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is selectively expressed in adipocytes and induced early during the course of differentiation of several preadipocyte cell lines (9Chawla A. Schwartz E.J. Dimaculangan D.D. Lazar M.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 10Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R. Budavari A. Spiegelman B. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar). Forced expression of PPARγ in fibroblast and myoblast cell lines results in efficient adipocyte differentiation in a PPARγ-activator-dependent fashion (8Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3133) Google Scholar, 11Hu E. Tontonoz P. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9856-9860Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Thus, PPARγ functions as a master regulator of adipocyte differentiation. Two other PPAR subtypes, termed PPARα and PPARΔ, have been identified in addition to PPARγ (12Green S. Wahli W. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 100: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 13Desvergne B. Wahli W. Baeuerle P.A. Inducible Gene Expression. Birkhauser, Boston, MA1995: 142-176Google Scholar). PPARα is the predominant PPAR subtype expressed in liver and is activated by a group of chemicals that induce the proliferation of peroxisomes in rodents (14Isseman I. Green S. Nature. 1990; 347: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (3059) Google Scholar). Gene disruption experiments have demonstrated that PPARα is required for the pleiotropic hepatic response to peroxisome proliferators in rodents (15Lee S.S.-T. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar). Work from several laboratories had shown that PGs have marked effects, both positive and negative, on adipocyte differentiation (4Negrel R. Gaillard D. Ailhaud G. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 399-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 16Christ E.J. Nugteren D.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 218: 296-307Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 17Axelrod L. Levine L.

Prostaglandins. 1993; 46: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PPARγ is activated by PGs and PG-like molecules (20Krey G. Keller H. Mahfoudi A. Medin J. Ozato K.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 974-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Recently, the arachidonic acid metabolite 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 was shown to bind directly to PPARγ and to promote the efficient conversion of fibroblast and mesenchymal stem cell lines to adipocytes (24Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar, 25Kliewer S.A. Lenhard J.M. Willson T.M. Patel I.

The finding that a PG functions as a PPARγ ligand and promotes adipocyte differentiation provided additional evidence that products of the COX pathway play an important role in modulating adipogenesis. If prostanoids can function as PPARγ ligands and induce adipogenesis, how then does a COX inhibitor such as indomethacin, which blocks PG synthesis, promote adipocyte differentiation? In this report, we show that indomethacin and several other NSAIDs function as PPARγ ligands, suggesting a mechanism for the adipogenic actions of these compounds. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these same NSAIDs also activate PPARα, providing a basis for the reported effects of NSAIDs on peroxisome activity in liver. Indomethacin, flufenamic acid, fenoprofen, ibuprofen, piroxicam, acetaminophen, and salicylic acid were purchased from Sigma. The peroxisome proliferator Wy14,643 was purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA) and 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 from Cayman Chemical Company (Ann Arbor, MI). To generate the pSG5-GAL4-PPARαLBD and pSG5-GAL4-PPARγLBD chimeric receptor expression plasmids, cDNAs encoding the ligand binding domains (LBDs) of the human PPARα (amino acids 167-468) (26Sher T. Yi H.-F. McBride O.W. Gonzalez F.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5598-5604Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) and the human PPARγ (amino acids 176-477) (27Greene M.E. Blumberg B. McBride O.W. Yi H.F. Kronquist K. Kwan K. Hsieh L. Greene G. Nimer S.D. Gene Expr. 1995; 4: 281-299PubMed Google Scholar) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into the pSG5-GAL4 expression plasmid (28Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A.

The pCMV-PPARγ expression plasmid has been described (27Greene M.E. Blumberg B. McBride O.W. Yi H.F. Kronquist K. Kwan K. Hsieh L. Greene G. Nimer S.D. Gene Expr. 1995; 4: 281-299PubMed Google Scholar). The (UAS)5-tk-CAT and aP2-tk-CAT reporter plasmids were previously described (28Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3469) Google Scholar). Transient cotransfection assays using these plasmids were performed as described previously (28Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3469) Google Scholar). The LBD of human PPARγ (amino acids 176-477) (27Greene M.E. Blumberg B. McBride O.W. Yi H.F. Kronquist K. Kwan K. Hsieh L. Greene G. Nimer S.D. Gene Expr. 1995; 4: 281-299PubMed Google Scholar) was overexpressed in Escherichia coli as a histidine-tagged fusion protein and bacterial lysates prepared as described previously (25Kliewer S.A. Lenhard J.M. Willson T.M. Patel I. Morris D.C. Lehmann J.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 813-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1872) Google Scholar). For competition binding assays, bacterial extracts (approximately 100 μg of protein) containing the PPARγ ligand binding domain were incubated at 4°C for 2-3 h with 40 nM [3H]BRL49653 (specific activity, 40 Ci/mmol) in the absence or presence of unlabeled competitor in buffer containing 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 50 mM KCl, 10 mM dithiothreitol. Bound was separated from free radioactivity by elution through 1- ml Sephadex G-25 desalting columns (Boehringer Mannheim). Bound radioactivity eluted in the column void volume and was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Data shown are the result of binding assays performed in duplicate, and each experiment was repeated at least twice with similar results. C3H10T1/2 clone 8 murine fibroblasts (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 10 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin. One day after reaching confluence, the cells were treated with BRL49653 or the various NSAIDs in the presence of 200 nM insulin. Fresh media and test compounds were added every 2 days. Lipogenesis was measured in cells at 9 days post-confluence as described previously (29Moody A.J. Stan M.A. Stan M. Gliemann J. Horm. Metab. Res. 1974; 6: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). For Northern analysis, total RNA was prepared from vehicle- and compound-treated cells using the RNeasy Total RNA Kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Fifteen μg of total RNA was electrophoresed on a formaldehyde gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blot was probed with mouse aP2 and GAPDH probes labeled via the random priming technique with [α-32P]dCTP. The results of Northern assays were quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics Computing Densitometer and Image Quant software. The PPARs are activated by a large number of structurally diverse compounds including prostanoids, long-chain fatty acids, the fibrate class of hypolipidemic drugs, leukotriene antagonists, and anti-diabetic thiazolidinediones (13Desvergne B. Wahli W. Baeuerle P.A. Inducible Gene Expression. Birkhauser, Boston, MA1995: 142-176Google Scholar). While chemically diverse, these compounds share certain structural characteristics including a lipophilic backbone and an acid moiety, usually a carboxylate. Indomethacin and many of the other NSAIDs are amphipathic carboxylates that share these broad structural features (Fig. 1). This suggested to us that indomethacin might exert its adipogenic effects through direct activation of PPARγ. We tested the possibility that indomethacin activates PPARγ via a transient transfection assay. An established chimera system was used (28Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3469) Google Scholar) in which the LBD of PPARγ was fused to the DNA binding domain of the yeast transcription factor GAL4. The advantage of the GAL4 chimera assay is that it minimizes background due to the cell's endogenous receptors. Expression plasmid for the GAL4-PPARγ LBD chimera was transfected into CV-1 cells together with a reporter construct containing five copies of the GAL4 response element driving expression of the reporter chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (UAS5-tk-CAT). Dose-response analysis revealed that indomethacin is an efficacious activator of PPARγ, inducing PPARγ activity roughly 40-fold at 1 × 10−4M (Fig. 2). This activation is comparable with the maximal induction obtained with the PPARγ ligands 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 and the anti-diabetic thiazolidinedione BRL49653 (25Kliewer S.A. Lenhard J.M. Willson T.M. Patel I. Morris D.C. Lehmann J.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 813-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1872) Google Scholar, 28Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3469) Google Scholar) (see below). Indomethacin activated PPARγ with an EC50 of approximately 4 × 10−5M (Fig. 2). Similar EC50 and fold activation values were obtained for indomethacin in transient transfection assays performed with an expression vector for wild-type PPARγ and a reporter driven by the fatty acid binding protein/aP2 enhancer region which contains two PPARγ response elements (10Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R. Budavari A. Spiegelman B. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Thus, indomethacin is an efficacious activator of PPARγ. We next sought to determine whether indomethacin activates PPARγ through direct interactions with the receptor. We and others (24Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar, 28Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3469) Google Scholar) have previously shown that the anti-diabetic thiazolidinedione BRL49653 can bind to PPARγ with high affinity. The ability of indomethacin to bind to PPARγ was assessed in a competition binding assay using [3H]BRL49653 and bacterially expressed PPARγ LBD. As shown in Fig. 3, indomethacin competed efficiently with [3H]BRL49653 for binding to the PPARγ LBD, with an IC50 of approximately 1 × 10−4M. In control experiments, acetaminophen, an NSAID that does not activate PPARγ (see below), failed to compete with [3H]BRL49653 for binding to the PPARγ LBD (Fig. 3). These data demonstrate that indomethacin can interact directly and specifically with the PPARγ LBD and thus define a novel PPARγ ligand. Several chemically distinct classes of NSAIDs are used clinically including thiazinecarboxamides (e.g. piroxicam) and derivatives of arylacetic acid (e.g. indomethacin), aminoarylcarboxylic acid (e.g. flufenamic acid), arylpropionic acid (e.g. ibuprofen and fenoprofen), and salicylic acid (e.g. aspirin) (Fig. 1) (1Insel P.A. Hardman J.G. Limbird L.E. Molinoff P.B. Ruddon R.W. Goodman Gilman A. The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutic Drugs. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1996: 617-657Google Scholar). We next tested whether representative compounds from the different classes of NSAIDs could also activate PPARγ. CV-1 cells were transfected with the GAL4-PPARγLBD expression plasmid and the UAS5-tk-CAT reporter and treated with 1 × 10−4M of piroxicam, flufenamic acid, ibuprofen, fenoprofen, and salicylic acid. As shown in Fig. 4A, flufenamic acid, fenoprofen, and ibuprofen were efficient activators of PPARγ, activating the receptor to a degree comparable to that obtained with the PPARγ ligands BRL49653 and 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 and the peroxisome proliferator Wy14,643. However, in contrast to indomethacin, no activation of PPARγ was observed in transfected cells treated with 1 × 10−5M of these compounds (data not shown). Thus, indomethacin is the most potent of the NSAIDs that we tested for PPARγ activation. Treatment of transfected cells with piroxicam resulted in only a modest activation of PPARγ (approximately 5-fold), whereas treatment with salicylic acid or acetaminophen resulted in little or no induction of reporter expression (Fig. 4A). We note that the compounds that activated PPARγ efficiently (>6-fold) were all amphipathic acids (Fig. 1) and thus conform in their general structural features to known PPAR activators. The ability of these compounds to interact with PPARγ was assessed in the competition binding assay using [3H]BRL49653. These studies revealed a good correlation between the compounds that activated PPARγ in the transfection assay and those that interacted directly with the receptor. Although flufenamic acid, fenoprofen, and ibuprofen competed efficiently with [3H]BRL49653 for binding to the PPARγ LBD, little or no competition was seen with piroxicam, salicylic acid, or acetaminophen (Fig. 4B). Taken together, the transfection and binding analyses demonstrate that some but not all NSAIDs bind and activate PPARγ. For comparative purposes, we also tested the various NSAIDs on the PPARα and PPARΔ subtypes using the transfection assay. Little or no activation of PPARΔ was seen in the presence of 1 × 10−4M of these compounds (data not shown). However, indomethacin, fenoprofen, ibuprofen, and flufenamic acid were efficacious activators of PPARα at this concentration, with fenoprofen activating the receptor to a degree comparable to that obtained with the strong peroxisome proliferator Wy14,643 (Fig. 4A). Thus, the same NSAIDs that activate PPARγ are also efficacious activators of the PPARα subtype. We and others (24Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M.

Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that treatment of various fibroblast and mesenchymal stem cell lines with PPARγ ligands, including 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 and the anti-diabetic thiazolidinediones, promotes their efficient conversion to adipocytes. As discussed, indomethacin is used to promote the terminal differentiation of preadipocyte cell lines. We next examined whether the concentration of indomethacin required to activate PPARγ in CV-1 cells was consistent with that required to induce adipocyte differentiation. C3H10T1/2 mouse mesenchymal stem cells were treated with various concentrations of indomethacin and subsequently assayed for lipogenesis, an established measure of adipocyte differentiation (29Moody A.J. Stan M.A. Stan M. Gliemann J. Horm. Metab. Res. 1974; 6: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Dose-response analysis revealed the EC50 for indomethacin in the lipogenesis assay to be approximately 8 × 10−5M (Fig. 5A). This value is in good agreement with that reported in a previous study (3 × 10−5M) using TA1 cells, a stable adipogenic cell line derived from C3H10T1/2 cells (7Knight D.M. Chapman A.B. Navre M. Drinkwater L. Bruno J.J. Ringold G.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 36-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and is also consistent with the EC50 value of indomethacin for PPARγ activation in the transfection assay (Fig. 2). Taken together, these data suggest that PPARγ is the target for the adipogenic actions of indomethacin. Our finding that flufenamic acid, fenoprofen, and ibuprofen also activated PPARγ at micromolar concentrations suggested that these NSAIDs might also promote adipocyte differentiation. We tested this possibility using C3H10T1/2 cells and the lipogenesis assay. In agreement with previous studies, treatment of the C3H10T1/2 cells with either 1 × 10−6M of the thiazolidinedione BRL49653 or 3 × 10−6M 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 resulted in marked increases in adipocyte differentiation (Fig. 5B) (25Kliewer S.A.

As expected, concentrations of the hypolipidemic agent Wy14,643 sufficient to activate PPARγ also induced lipogenesis (Fig. 5B) (9Chawla A. Schwartz E.J. Dimaculangan D.D. Lazar M.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 28Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3469) Google Scholar). Treatment of C3H10T1/2 cells with 1 × 10−4M of either flufenamic acid or fenoprofen promoted lipogenesis, albeit less efficiently than indomethacin (Fig. 5B). The results of the lipogenesis assay were confirmed by oil red O staining for lipid accumulation in treated cells (data not shown). The NSAIDs that did not activate PPARγ efficiently in the transfection assay, including piroxicam, salicylic acid, and acetaminophen, failed to induce lipogenesis in the C3H10T1/2 cells (Fig. 5B). We conclude that NSAIDs other than indomethacin can also promote adipocyte differentiation at concentrations at which they activate PPARγ. We note that ibuprofen, which was a less efficacious activator of PPARγ in CV-1 cells than either flufenamic acid or fenoprofen (Fig. 4A), failed to promote lipogenesis in C3H10T1/2 cells when tested at 1 × 10−4M (Fig. 5B). However, increasing the concentration of indomethacin to 5 × 10−4M resulted in significant lipogenesis (Fig. 5B). In Northern analysis, 1 × 10−4M ibuprofen induced weak expression of the gene encoding aP2, an adipocyte-specific fatty acid binding protein whose expression is directly regulated by PPARγ (Fig. 5C) (10Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R. Budavari A. Spiegelman B. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar). Consistent with the results of the transfection studies, 1 × 10−4M indomethacin stimulated aP2 gene expression approximately 3-fold more efficiently than ibuprofen (Fig. 5C). Taken together, these data indicate that ibuprofen is less potent than indomethacin, flufenamic acid, or fenoprofen in the activation of PPARγ in both CV-1 and C3H10T1/2 cells. The NSAID indomethacin is frequently included as one of a mixture of compounds used to promote the terminal differentiation of various preadipocyte cell lines in vitro This differentiation mixture also routinely includes insulin, corticosteroids, and isobutylmethylxanthine. Recent work has indicated that isobutylmethylxanthine and corticosteroids induce the expression of the genes encoding CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins β and Δ, respectively, members of the basic region-leucine zipper family of transcription factors (34Yeh W.-C. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 168-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). These two transcription factors are induced early during the course of 3T3-L1 cell conversion to adipocytes and appear to play key roles in the differentiation cascade (34Yeh W.-C. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 168-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 35Cao Z. Umek R. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar, 36Wu Z.

Biol. 1996; 16: 4128-4136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism underlying the adipogenic activity of indomethacin, however, has remained unclear. Early speculation focused on the ability of indomethacin to inhibit COX activity. However, Knight et al. (7Knight D.M. Chapman A.B. Navre M. Drinkwater L. Bruno J.J. Ringold G.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 36-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) showed that the concentration of indomethacin required to promote the differentiation of TA1 cells to adipocytes was 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than the concentrations needed to block prostaglandin synthesis. Furthermore, not all COX inhibitors promoted adipocyte differentiation. Likewise, we have found that several COX inhibitors, including the potent NSAID piroxicam (38Carty T.J. Eskra J.D. Lombardino J.G. Hoffman W.W. Prostaglandins. 1980; 19: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), fail to promote adipocyte differentiation. These data provide compelling evidence that the effects of indomethacin are not mediated through the inhibition of prostaglandin production. In searching for the basis of its adipogenic activity, we have found that indomethacin functions as a micromolar ligand for the adipogenic transcription factor PPARγ. PPARγ is abundantly expressed in adipose tissue where it functions as a key modulator of the adipocyte differentiation program (8Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3133) Google Scholar–10Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R. Budavari A. Spiegelman B. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar). PPARγ ligands, including the anti-diabetic thiazolidinediones and the arachidonic acid metabolite 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2, are potent inducers of the differentiation of several different fibroblastic cell lines to adipocytes (30Hiragun A. Sato M. Mitsui H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 134: 124-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 31Sparks R.L. Strauss E.E. Zygmunt A.I. Phelan T.E. J. Cell.

Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our finding that the concentration of indomethacin required to induce C3H10T1/2 cell differentiation correlates with that required to activate PPARγ in the transfection assay provides strong evidence that the adipogenic actions of this NSAID are mediated through its binding and activation of PPARγ. While indomethacin is widely used to promote the differentiation of preadipocyte cell lines, in at least one instance indomethacin was found to block this process (4Negrel R. Gaillard D. Ailhaud G. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 399-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Our results together with the recent findings that a subset of the PGs activate PPARγ (23Brun R.P. Tontonoz P. Forman B.M. Ellis R. Chen J. Evans R.M. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 974-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 24Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M.

Cell. 1995; 83: 813-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1872) Google Scholar) may provide an explanation for this paradox. At lower concentrations, indomethacin may block COX activity, thus inhibiting the formation of adipogenic PGs and activators of PPARγ such as 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 and prostacyclin without directly affecting the PPARs. At higher concentrations, however, indomethacin not only inhibits COX activity but also acts as a PPARγ agonist, promoting adipocyte differentiation. Thus, indomethacin may function to either inhibit or induce adipogenesis depending upon the particular concentration of drug used in the experiment. We have shown that the same NSAIDs that activate PPARγ also activate PPARα. PPARα is the predominant PPAR subtype expressed in the rodent liver (14Isseman I. Green S. Nature. 1990; 347: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (3059) Google Scholar, 21Kliewer S.A. Forman B.M. Blumberg B. Ong E.S. Borgmeyer U. Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7355-7359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). Targeted gene disruption experiments have shown that PPARα is essential for the induction of peroxisomal enzymes and peroxisome proliferation in the rodent liver (15Lee S.S.-T. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar). Interestingly, several NSAIDs have been reported to have marked effects on peroxisome activity in hepatocytes when used either in vitro or in vivo Indomethacin and ibuprofen induced β-oxidation in peroxisomes of cultured hepatocytes (39Foxworthy P.S. Perry D.N. Eacho P.I. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1993; 118: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Furthermore, treatment of rats with ibuprofen induced peroxisomal β-oxidation, reduced serum triglycerides and cholesterol, and increased liver weight (39Foxworthy P.S. Perry D.N. Eacho P.I. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1993; 118: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Finally, treatment of rats with benoxaprofen, an NSAID closely related to ibuprofen, at doses comparable to those used clinically induced peroxisomal β-oxidation and increased cytochrome P4504A1 apoprotein and enoyl-CoA hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase bifunctional protein levels in liver (40Ayrton A.D. Ionnides C. Parke D.V. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Expression of both of these genes is known to be induced by PPARα in response to peroxisome proliferators (15Lee S.S.-T. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar, 41Muerhoff A.S. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol.

S. A. 1992; 89: 7541-7545Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). As a whole, the effects of these NSAIDs on liver function are similar to those seen in experiments performed with the fibrate class of hypolipidemic drugs (43Reddy J.K. Lalwai N.D. CRC Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1983; 12: 1-58Crossref Scopus (868) Google Scholar), agents that are established activators of PPARα (14Isseman I. Green S. Nature. 1990; 347: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (3059) Google Scholar). Our data strongly suggest that the actions of NSAIDs on peroxisomal and liver functions are mediated through the activation of PPARα. We note, however, that we do not have a binding assay for mammalian PPARα and, as a consequence, have not been able to demonstrate direct interactions between the NSAIDs and PPARα. Thus, it remains possible that the NSAIDs modulate PPARα activity through an indirect mechanism. It is interesting that NSAIDs are associated with a variety of detrimental side effects, including hepatotoxicity (1Insel P.A. Hardman J.G. Limbird L.E. Molinoff P.B. Ruddon R.W. Goodman Gilman A. The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutic Drugs. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1996: 617-657Google Scholar). While there is currently no evidence of a link between these negative effects and PPARs, evaluation of the activities of NSAIDs on PPARs may be useful in minimizing the potential for unwanted side effects as new drugs of this class are developed. In summary, we have demonstrated that indomethacin and other NSAIDs are efficacious activators of PPARα and PPARγ at micromolar concentrations. These data provide evidence for a common mechanism underlying the seemingly disparate biological effects of these compounds on the induction of adipocyte differentiation in vitro and peroxisome proliferation in vivo We thank Tim Willson for preparation of Fig. 1 and critical reading of the manuscript and Larry Hammacher for assistance with cell culture."

P. and Halestrap, A. P. (1994) Biochem. J. 302, 321-324) is less. From a range of nucleotides tested only ADP, deoxy-ADP, and ATP inhibited the MPT. ADP inhibition involved two sites with Ki values of about 1 and 25 μM which were independent of [Ca2+] and CyP binding. Carboxyatractyloside (CAT) abolished the high affinity site. Following pretreatment of mitochondria with TBH or diamide, the Ki for ADP increased to 50-100 μM, whereas pretreatment with PheArs or eosin maleimide increased the Ki to >500 μM; only one inhibitory site was observed in both cases. Eosin maleimide is known to attack Cys159 of the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) in a CAT-sensitive manner (Majima, E., Shinohara, Y., Yamaguchi, N., Hong, Y. M., and Terada, H.

In adenine nucleotide-depleted mitochondria, no stimulation of the MPT by uncoupler was observed in the presence or absence of thiol reagents, suggesting that membrane potential may inhibit the MPT by increasing adenine nucleotide binding through an effect on the ANT conformation. We conclude that CsA and ADP inhibit pore opening in distinct ways, CsA by displacing bound CyP and ADP by binding to the ANT. Both mechanisms act to decrease the Ca2+ sensitivity of the pore.

In contrast, protection is afforded by low pH, high Δψ, and agents that stabilize the “m” conformation of the ANT (see Refs. 1Bernardi P. Broekemeier K.M. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Bioenerg.

In addition, pore opening can be prevented by sub-micromolar concentrations of cyclosporin A (CsA) and its analogues (4Crompton M. Ellinger H. Costi A. Biochem.

Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). This effect appears to be mediated through the matrix peptidyl-proline cis-trans-isomerase, since the Ki values for inhibition of this enzyme by a number of CsA analogues correlate with their ability to inhibit pore opening (6Halestrap A.P.

N-terminal sequencing of the purified peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans-isomerase has shown it to be a member of the cyclophilin (CyP) family (9Connern C.P. Halestrap A.P. Biochem.

These observations led us to suggest that an interaction of matrix CyP with an integral membrane protein leads to a change in its conformation which, when triggered by Ca2+, induces pore opening. In view of the influence of the ANT conformation on this process, we suggested that the integral membrane protein might be the ANT (6Halestrap A.P. Davidson A.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 7Griffiths E.J. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Further evidence in support of this model has come from our observations that oxidative stress, thiol reagents, NADH oxidation, increased matrix volume, and chaotropic agents, all of which enhance pore opening, also cause a recruitment of CyP to the inner mitochondrial membrane (13Connern C.P. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 14Connern C.P. Halestrap A.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8172-8180Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In contrast, modulation of pore opening by matrix pH, AdNs, Δψ, and the conformation of the ANT appeared to be independent of CyP binding and must involve different regulatory sites on the pore complex (13Connern C.P.

Matrix ADP is an important modulator of pore opening and acts by decreasing the sensitivity of the calcium trigger site to [Ca2+]. There are thought to be two ADP binding sites, one with high affinity associated with the ANT that is blocked by the inhibitor carboxyatractyloside (CAT) and another lower affinity site (15Hunter D.R.

Thus, at a constant intramitochondrial [Ca2+], progressive lowering of Δψ by addition of uncoupler leads to a progressive stimulation of pore opening. Thiol reagents shift this voltage dependence, allowing the pore to open at higher Δψ (19Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8834-8839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Petronilli V.

Acta. 1994; 1187: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), implying that the voltage sensor possesses critical thiol groups whose modification attenuates the voltage sensitivity. During our studies on the effects of thiol reagents on CyP binding, we noticed that phenylarsine oxide (PheArs) consistently produced a greater stimulation of pore opening than diamide or t-butylhydroperoxide (TBH), and yet induced less CyP binding. This led us to consider the possibility that thiol reagents might antagonize ADP inhibition of the MPT through an effect on the nucleotide binding site of the ANT, independent of their effects on CyP binding. Under the influence of a physiological Δψ, the ANT drives ATP4− out of mitochondria in exchange for the entry of ADP3−. This electrically driven process is brought about by an effect of Δψ on the conformation of the carrier and its affinity for AdNs at the extramitochondrial binding site (24Souverijn J.H.M. Huisman L.A. Rosing J. Kemp N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 305: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 25Klingenberg M. J. Membr.

If Δψ were also able to increase the affinity of the matrix facing nucleotide binding site for AdNs, this might explain the regulation of the pore by Δψ. Thus at high Δψ AdN binding would be tighter and the pore would be less sensitive to [Ca2+], while at lower Δψ binding would become weaker and the sensitivity of the pore to [Ca2+] would increase. This effect would be exacerbated by thiol reagents if these decrease the affinity of AdN binding. This paper provides evidence in support of this hypothesis. Rat liver mitochondria were prepared as described by Halestrap and Davidson (6Halestrap A.P. Davidson A.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). For some experiments, mitochondria were depleted of their endogenous AdNs by incubation for 15 min at 25°C in sucrose isolation buffer supplemented with 2 mM PPi as described previously (27Griffiths E.J.

When required, energization was achieved by addition of 2 mM succinate in the absence of antimycin and A23187; where indicated 150 mM KCl was replaced by 300 mM sucrose. Other additions were made as indicated in the figure legends. The effects of Δψ and thiol reagents on pore opening in energized mitochondria were investigated using a procedure similar to that described by Petronilli et al. (22Petronilli V. Costantini P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Passamonti S. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16638-16642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondria (5 mg of protein) were added to 7 ml of buffer, and aliquots (3.5 ml) of this mitochondrial suspension were then added to both sample and reference cuvettes of a split-beam spectrophotometer (29Davidson A.M. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and A520 was monitored. After incubation at 25°C for 1 min in the presence of succinate, pore opening was initiated by addition of Ca2+ (20-70 nmol/mg of protein) followed at 50-s intervals by 0.5 mM EGTA, the reagent of interest, and finally the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide p-trifluormethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) at the required concentration. Mitochondria were pre-swollen as described previously (13Connern C.P. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 14Connern C.P. Halestrap A.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8172-8180Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), by incubating for 20 min at 30°C and 2 mg of protein/ml under de-energized conditions in KSCN buffer (150 mM KSCN, 20 mM Mops, 10 mM Tris, 0.5 μM rotenone, 0.5 μM antimycin at pH 7.2) containing 1 mM CaCl2. Additions of TBH, diamide, or PheArs to the buffer were made as required. Swelling was terminated by addition of 1.2 mM EGTA and centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min to sediment the swollen mitochondria which were then resuspended at 20 mg of protein/ml in KSCN buffer containing 2 mM nitrilotriacetic acid and 2 μM A23187. Shrinkage of these pre-swollen mitochondria at different [Ca2+] was determined by measuring the rate of increase of A520 upon addition of 7% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) as described previously (13Connern C.P. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 14Connern C.P. Halestrap A.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8172-8180Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Briefly, pre-swollen mitochondria (approximately 1 mg of protein) were added to a cuvette containing 3 ml of KSCN buffer (with 2 mM nitrilotriacetic acid and 2 μM A23187) supplemented with CaCl2 to give the desired free [Ca2+] and other additions as required. After incubation for 1 min at 25°C, measurement of A520 was initiated and monitored continuously (10 data points per s). Shrinkage was induced by addition of 0.5 ml of 50% (w/v) PEG 2000 through a light-sealed injection port followed by rapid mixing (<1 s). Shrinkage induced by the colloidal osmotic pressure of PEG was detected as a rapid increase in A520. Mitochondria (1 mg of protein/ml) were incubated in the cuvette of a double-beam spectrophotometer at 25°C in buffer containing 125 mM KCl, 20 mM Mops, 10 mM Tris, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.5 μM rotenone, and 10 μM safranin. Energization was determined as the difference in absorbance at 554 and 524 nm (A554-524) (30Åkerman K.E.O. Wikström M.K. F FEBS Lett. 1976; 68: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) and was monitored continuously. Energization was induced either by addition of 2 mM succinate or 0.2 mM ATP. Other additions were made as described in the figure legend. No attempt was made to calibrate Δψ measurements. CyP binding to mitochondrial membranes was measured in parallel incubations as described previously (14Connern C.P. Halestrap A.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8172-8180Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial membranes were prepared by freeze-thawing mitochondrial incubations following addition of KSCN buffer containing the protease inhibitors antipain, pepstatin, and leupeptin at 1 μg/ml and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 100 μM. Detection of CyP binding to the membranes was performed using SDS-PAGE (10 μg of protein per track determined by Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as standard) and Western blotting with N-terminal antipeptide antibodies to mitochondrial CyP using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Corp., Bucks., UK). Western blotting with antibody to NAD+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase was performed in parallel to correct for changes in nonspecific CyP binding. 4-Aminophenylarsine oxide was conjugated to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad, prepared for reaction as described by the manufacturer). The 4-aminophenylarsine oxide was dissolved in H2O at 5 mg/ml by vigorous stirring and addition of 1 M HCl until the pH was 1.5. HEPES (50 mM) was then added and the pH brought to 7.2 with 1 M NaOH. An aliquot equivalent to 3 mg of the reagent was reacted with 3 ml of Affi-Gel 10 overnight at room temperature, followed by blocking of unreacted groups by incubation for 1 h at pH 8.0 with 0.3 M ethanolamine. Columns (usually 0.5 ml) were poured and washed with 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, containing 150 mM Na2SO4, 1 mM EDTA, 0.25% (w/v) Triton X-100, and the protease inhibitors antipain, leupeptin, and pepstatin at 1 μg/ml and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 100 μM (Buffer A). Coupling efficiency of the phenylarsine oxide was not determined. Mitochondria were solubilized at 0°C and 10 mg of protein per ml in Buffer A containing additional Triton X-100 (3%). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 180,000 × g for 1 min in a Beckman Airfuge, and 1 ml of sample was added to a 0.5-ml column. Unbound material was washed through the column with Buffer A until no protein was detected in the effluent. Bound protein was then eluted with Buffer A containing 10 mM dithiothreitol, and the protein concentration in each fraction (0.6 ml) was determined by Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as standard. Samples (20 μl) of both flow-through and eluted fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE on 15% acrylamide gels, and Western blotting was performed with anti-ANT antibodies. All light scattering traces shown are representative of at least three separate experiments. Initial rates were determined by differentiation of traces (ignoring the response during the first second which is associated with mixing artifacts) and used to provide a relative measure of the extent of mitochondrial pore opening. The resulting data were analyzed using FigP and PFit software (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). The dependence of pore opening on [Ca2+] is shown as smooth curves generated by least squares regression analysis to Equation 1 for cooperative kinetics:v=Vmin+(Vmax−Vmin)/(1+(([Ca]/K0.5)−n))(Eq. 1) where Vmax and Vmin are the rates of shrinkage at maximal and zero [Ca2+], respectively, K0.5 is the [Ca2+] giving the half-maximal rate of shrinkage, and n is the Hill coefficient. It should be noted that the 1-s mixing time limited the maximum rates of light scattering changes that could be measured accurately to rates with a t0.5 of 5 s or greater. No attempt was made to determine rates at saturating [Ca2+], and thus, without an accurate estimate of Vmax, the values of K0.5 and n cannot be determined with certainty. Nevertheless, the shape of each curve was reproducible from day to day, and the plots obtained readily illustrate changes in Ca2+ sensitivity of pore opening. The inhibition of shrinkage by ADP was usually analyzed by least squares regression analysis using Equation 2 which assumes only one binding site for ADP: v=Vmin+(Vmax−Vmin)/(1+(([ADP]/Ki)(Eq. 2) where Vmax is the initial rate of shrinkage in the absence of ADP, Vmin the rate in the absence of Ca2+, and Ki is the dissociation constant for ADP binding to its inhibitory site. Where two binding sites were suggested by the data, Equation 3 was used: v=Vmin+Vmax1/(1+(([ADP]/Ki1)+Vmax2/(1+(([ADP]/Ki2)(Eq. 3) where Ki1 and Ki2 are the dissociation constants for the two ADP binding sites, and Vmax 1 and Vmax 2 represent that part of the Ca2+-sensitive rate of shrinkage that is inhibited when ADP binding sites 1 and 2, respectively, are saturated. TBH, diamide, and PheArs all increase CyP binding to the inner membrane of de-energized mitochondria, in parallel with their ability to increase the Ca2+ sensitivity of the MPT (8Nicolli A. Basso E. Petronilli V. Wenger R.M. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2185-2192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 13Connern C.P. Halestrap A.P. Biochem.

Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8483-8488Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). However, as illustrated by the data in Fig. 1, 20 μM PheArs consistently gave a greater stimulation of the MPT than diamide, while the increase in CyP binding was substantially less. These data suggested that PheArs must exert an effect on the MPT independent of CyP binding. One such site of action could be on the ability of matrix ADP to inhibit the MPT, because ADP, in contrast to CsA, does not appear to displace membrane-bound CyP (Fig. 2).Fig. 2The effects of ADP and CsA on the Ca2+ sensitivity of the MPT pore. The extent of pore opening in pre-swollen mitochondria was measured at varying [Ca2+] using the rate of shrinkage induced by addition of 7% (w/v) PEG as described under “Methods.” Where indicated 1 μM CsA, 20 μM ADP, 1 μM CsA + 20 μMADP, or 100 μM ADP were added 1 min before PEG addition. The inset shows Western blots of CyP and NAD+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) binding to mitochondrial membranes prepared from parallel incubations. Tracks represent membranes from pre-swollen mitochondria incubated for 1 min in the absence (track 1) or presence of 1 μM CsA (track 2), 0.2 mM ADP (track 3), or both CsA and ADP (track 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In order to investigate the interaction of thiol reagents with ADP inhibition of the MPT, we used the PEG-induced shrinkage assay of the MPT first introduced by Haworth and Hunter (16Haworth R.A. Hunter D.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 195: 460-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). The advantage of this assay is that it allows the extent of pore opening to be determined after equilibration with defined matrix [Ca2+] and [ADP]. The data of Fig. 2 investigate the interaction between ADP and CsA on the Ca2+ sensitivity of pore opening in parallel with measurements of CyP binding. The data confirm that activation by Ca2+ is cooperative (16Haworth R.A. Hunter D.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 195: 460-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 17Novgorodov S.A. Gudz T.I. Milgrom Y.M. Brierley G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16274-16282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that ADP and CsA both decrease the Ca2+ sensitivity by shifting the activation curve to the right. Comparison of the effect of 20 and 100 μM ADP shows that higher concentrations of ADP shift the curve further to the right suggesting that ADP acts as a competitive inhibitor of the Ca2+ trigger site in agreement with the conclusions of others (17Novgorodov S.A. Gudz T.I. Milgrom Y.M. Brierley G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16274-16282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Novgorodov S.A. Gudz T.I. Brierley G.P. Pfeiffer D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In contrast, increasing the concentration of CsA from 0.2 to 1 μM had almost no additional effect (data not shown). Furthermore, the effects of ADP and CsA were additive, confirming that they act on different sites as implied by the CyP binding experiments. It should be noted that complete removal of bound CyP by addition of CsA was never obtained. Although this may account for the CsA-insensitive pore opening seen at high [Ca2+], it is more likely that bound CyP is not essential for pore opening but rather enhances its Ca2+ sensitivity (8Nicolli A. Basso E. Petronilli V. Wenger R.M. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2185-2192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 13Connern C.P. Halestrap A.P. Biochem.

Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8483-8488Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). In Fig. 3 we investigate the effects of pretreatment of mitochondria with TBH, diamide, and PheArs on the inhibition of the MPT by ADP at a fixed [Ca2+]. Since such pretreatment increases the sensitivity of the MPT to [Ca2+] (13Connern C.P. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 14Connern C.P. Halestrap A.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8172-8180Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we chose to fix the [Ca2+] at different concentrations for the control and pretreated mitochondria in order to give similar rates of shrinkage in the absence of ADP. However, we performed ADP titrations on control mitochondria at two different [Ca2+] in order to confirm that [Ca2+] did not influence the Ki for ADP. Data are shown in Fig. 3A The Ki values derived using a single site model were 6.9 ± 1.0 and 8.1 ± 1.1 μM at 50 and 100 μM [Ca2+], respectively. Thus Ca2+ does not appear to compete with ADP for a common binding site. In contast, pretreatment of mitochondria with TBH, diamide, and PheArs all greatly increased the Ki for ADP, as shown in Fig. 3. The data of Fig. 3A show that 1 mM TBH and 0.1 mM diamide gave a large increase in Ki from 8.1 ± 1.1 to 42.9 ± 2.9 μM and 91.4 ± 11.1 μM, respectively, while the data of Fig. 3B, obtained with a different mitochondrial preparation, show that pretreatment with 20 μM PheArs or 1 mM TBH increased the Ki from 1.7 ± 0.4 to 491 ± 27 μM and 67.0 ± 9.7 μM, respectively. The higher Ki values obtained in the control experiments of Fig. 3A than those of Fig. 3B reflect a variability in this parameter which we believe to reflect oxidative stress during the pre-swelling of the mitochondria. The presence of 1 μM CsA significantly reduced the [Ca2+] sensitivity of the MTP, requiring a higher [Ca2+] to induce the same rate of shrinkage. Howeve"

The growing list of reported hormone-mimics includes the alkylphenolic (AP) compounds, a small number of which have been reported to be weakly estrogenic. In their most basic form, APs are composed of an alkyl group, which can vary in size, branching, and position, joined to a phenolic ring. The aim of this project was to identify the important structural features responsible for the estrogenic activity of AP chemicals.

The results were compared to the effects of the main natural estrogen 17β-estradiol. The data indicate that both the position (para > meta > ortho) and branching (tertiary > secondary = normal) of the alkyl group affect estrogenicity. Optimal estrogenic activity requires a single tertiary branched alkyl group composed of between 6 and 8 carbons located at the para position on an otherwise unhindered phenol ring.

https://openalex.org/W2056416370,"Anandamide (arachidonoylethanolamide, AnNH) and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) have been proposed as the physiological ligands, respectively, of central and peripheral cannabinoid receptors. Both of these receptors are expressed in immune cells, including macrophages and mast cells/basophils, where immunomodulatory and/or anti-inflammatory actions of AnNH and PEA have been recently reported. We now provide biochemical grounds to these actions by showing that the biosynthesis, uptake, and degradation of AnNH and PEA occur in leukocytes. On stimulation with ionomycin, J774 macrophages and RBL-2H3 basophils produced AnNH and PEA, probably through the hydrolysis of the corresponding N-acylphosphatidylethanolamines, also found among endogenous phospholipids. Immunological challenge of RBL-2H3 cells also caused AnNH and PEA release. The chemical structure and the amounts of AnNH and PEA produced upon ionomycin stimulation were determined by means of double radiolabeling experiments and isotope dilution gas chromatography/electron impact mass spectrometry. Both cell lines rapidly sequestered the two amides from the culture medium through temperature-dependent, saturable and chemically inactivable mechanisms. Once uptaken by basophils, AnNH and PEA compete for the same inactivating enzyme which catalyzes their hydrolysis to ethanolamine. This enzyme was found in both microsomal and 10,000 × g fractions of RBL cell homogenates, and exhibited similar inhibition and temperature/pH dependence profiles but a significantly higher affinity for PEA with respect to neuronal “anandamide amidohydrolase.” The finding of biosynthetic and inactivating mechanisms for AnNH and PEA in macrophages and basophils supports the previously proposed role as local modulators of immune/inflammatory reactions for these two long chain acylethanolamides.

In the past 15 years evidence has been accumulating to support the existence of a neuroimmune axis. The presence of neuropeptide receptors in immune cells allows them to respond to peptidergic stimulation with decreased or augmented proliferation, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, degranulation, lymphokine and cytokine release, superoxide radical formation, and leukotriene biosynthesis (see Refs. 1Morley J.E.

Sci. 1989; 10: 91-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, for reviews). The concomitant action on vascular permeability of neuropeptides like substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and neurokinins, concurs to the onset of immune/inflammatory reactions, as in the “axon-reflex” model for neurogenic inflammation. These reactions can be modulated through feed-back actions on autonomic and sensorial fibers by mediators and neurotransmitters produced by immune cells (3Payan D.G. Levine J.D. Goetzl E.J. J.

Some circulating leukocytes can, in fact, synthesize, store, and release neuropeptides such as vasoactive intestinal peptide, endorphins, and substance P (1Morley J.E. Kay N.E. Solomon G.F.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar); 2) the synthesis of AnNH in the presence of AA and high concentrations of ethanolamine (18Ueda N. Kurahashi Y. Yamamoto S. Tokunaga T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23823-23827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Although very potent at functionally activating the central CB1 receptor, AnNH binds poorly to the “peripheral” CB2 receptor, where it rather behaves as an antagonist (9Munro S. Thomas K.L. Abu-Shaar M. Nature. 1993; 365: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (4150) Google Scholar, 19Bayewitch M. Rhee M.-H. Avidor-Reiss T. Breuer A. Mechoulam R. Vogel Z. J. Biol.

While the discovery of CB1 receptors also on immune cells, like macrophages and lymphocytes (20Herkenham M. Pertwee R.G. Cannabinoid Receptors. Academic Press, London1995: 35-85Google Scholar), explains the regulatory actions on macrophage morphology and NO synthesis (37Stefano G.B. Liu Y. Goligorsky M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19238-19242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and on lymphocyte proliferation and apoptosis (21Schwarz H. Blanco F.J. Lotz M. J. Neuroimmunol. 1994; 55: 107-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 22Lee M. Yang K.H. Kaminski N.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 275: 529-536PubMed Google Scholar) that AnNH, under certain conditions, shares with cannabinoids, there remains to find both a physiological function and an endogenous ligand for the CB2 receptor. In a recent report (23Facci L. Dal Toso R. Romanello S. Buriani A. Skaper S.D. Leon A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3376-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar), cannabinoids and a congener of AnNH, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), were shown: 1) to bind selectively to membrane preparations from rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells, where the CB2, but not the CB1, receptor was found to be constitutively expressed; and 2) to inhibit the immunogenic activation of RBL-2H3 and mast cells. Interestingly, AnNH did not exert the latter action but antagonized the effect induced by PEA. The authors suggested that PEA, by acting at CB2 receptors, might function as an “autacoid local inflammation antagonist amide” (23Facci L. Dal Toso R. Romanello S. Buriani A. Skaper S.D. Leon A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3376-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). The immunosuppressant and anti-inflammatory effects of PEA and other saturated or monounsaturated AEs, similar in some ways to those ascribed to cannabinoids, were also briefly discussed in a review (24Schmid H.H.O. Schmid P.C. Natarajan V. Prog. Lipid Res. 1990; 29: 1-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) where data on the accumulation of these lipids, as well as of their phospholipid precursors, during tissue injury and inflammation are also described. However, no data are available yet on the binding of PEA to membranes of CB2 receptor cDNA-transfected cells, nor on the capability of this ethanolamide to elicit a typical CB2-mediated response, i.e. the inhibition of adenylate cyclase (25Felder C.C. Briley E.M. Axelrod J. Simpson J.T. Mackie K. Devane W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7656-7660Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory actions by PEA, respectively, against glutamate-evoked excitotoxicity in rat cerebellar granule neurons and substance P-induced plasma extravasation in rodents, have been, instead, described (26Skaper S.D. Buriani A. Petrelli L. Dal Toso R. Romanello S. Facci L. Leon A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3984-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 27Mazzari S. Canella R. Petrelli L. Marcolongo G. Leon A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 300: 227-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Despite the well documented immunomodulatory actions of AnNH and PEA, no report exists on the actual availability to leukocytes of molecular mechanisms for the formation and inactivation of these two AEs, required to support their proposed role as either autacoid local inflammation antagonist amides or blood cell cannabinoid receptor endogenous ligands. Hence the necessity to carry out the present study, where we show that two immortalized blood cell types, J774 and RBL-2H3 cells, widely used as experimental models for monocytes/macrophages and mast cells/basophils (23Facci L. Dal Toso R. Romanello S. Buriani A. Skaper S.D. Leon A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3376-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar), possess the means for the biosynthesis, uptake, and degradation of AnNH and PEA. AnNH, PEA, and other AEs, either radiolabeled or unlabeled, were synthesized by the diisopropylcarbodiimide method described previously (28Fontana A. Di Marzo V. Cadas H. Piomelli D. Prostaglandins Leukotriens Essent. Fatty Acids. 1995; 53: 301-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), starting from either [14C]ethanolamine (Amersham, United Kingdom, 53-57 mCi/mmol) or unlabeled ethanolamine plus the corresponding free fatty acids. The resulting synthetic [14C]AEs had a specific radioactivity of 5.3-5.7 mCi/mmol. RBL-2H3 cells were obtained by Dr. A. Leon, ResearchLife, Italy. RBL-1 and J774A.1 cells were purchased from DSM (Germany). RBL and J774 cells were cultured, respectively, in minimum Eagle's medium (MEM, Sigma) or in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Sigma), both containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) plus 1% penicillin:streptomycin (Sigma), in 5% CO2 at 37°C. The biosynthesis of AnNH and PEA in the two cell types under study was investigated by employing a methodology analogous to that used previously to demonstrate AnNH biosynthesis in rat central neurons (16Di Marzo V. Fontana A. Cadas H. Schinelli S. Cimino G. Schwartz J.-C. Piomelli D. Nature. 1994; 372: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar) and mouse neuroblastoma cells (29Di Marzo V. De Petrocellis L. Sepe N. Buono A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Cells were prelabeled overnight with 0.1 μCi/ml culture medium of either [14C]ethanolamine, [3H]AA (NEN DuPont de Nemours, Germany, 230 Ci/mmol), or [3H]palmitic acid (Sigma, 50 Ci/mmol), and then rinsed twice with serum-free DMEM before stimulation. Confluent cells from at least ten 100-mm Petri dishes (0.5-1.5 × 107 cells/dish) were stimulated for 20 min with 3 ml/dish of DMEM containing either Streptomyces chromofuscus PLD (Sigma, 10 units/ml) or ionomycin (Sigma, 5 μM). Control incubations were conducted with the same number of cells treated with DMEM only. RBL-2H3 cells were also stimulated for 15 min with human serum albumin-dinitrophenol (HSA-DNP, Sigma, 0.1 μg/ml), after 2 h sensitization with anti-DNP antibody (Sigma, 0.3 μg/ml) (23Facci L. Dal Toso R. Romanello S. Buriani A. Skaper S.D. Leon A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3376-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Cell viability after stimulation was checked with trypan blue and found to be higher than 95% in all cases. Arachidonoyltrifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF3, 10 μM, Cascade, UK), an inhibitor of both anandamide amidohydrolase and phospholipase A2 (PLA2) (30Koutek B. Prestwich G.D. Howlett A.C. Chin S.A.

After the incubation, 3 ml of methanol was added to each dish and cells were transferred to Falcon tubes before adding 6 ml of chloroform. The mixtures were then sonicated and the two phases allowed to separate by centrifugation. In order to purify and characterize the AEs and NaPEs therein contained, the organic phase was then submitted to a series of chromatographic steps described previously (28Fontana A. Di Marzo V. Cadas H. Piomelli D. Prostaglandins Leukotriens Essent. Fatty Acids. 1995; 53: 301-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 29Di Marzo V. De Petrocellis L. Sepe N. Buono A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), including SiO2 open bed chromatography, thin layer chromatography (TLC), and reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). NaPEs were characterized further by digestion with phospholipase D from S. chromofuscus, which released the corresponding AEs, followed by TLC and RP-HPLC (28Fontana A. Di Marzo V. Cadas H. Piomelli D. Prostaglandins Leukotriens Essent. Fatty Acids. 1995; 53: 301-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 29Di Marzo V. De Petrocellis L. Sepe N. Buono A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Spots and bands on TLC plates were visualized by exposure to iodine vapors. Radioactivity profiles of TLC analyses were determined by using a radioactivity scanner (Packard). The radioactivity profiles of HPLC analyses were determined by liquid scintillation counting of each 1-ml fraction. The yields of AEs and their phospholipid precursors after the extraction and purification procedure have been described previously (28Fontana A. Di Marzo V. Cadas H. Piomelli D. Prostaglandins Leukotriens Essent. Fatty Acids. 1995; 53: 301-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 29Di Marzo V. De Petrocellis L. Sepe N. Buono A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). For conclusive identification and quantitation of AnNH and PEA, cells from 60 100-mm Petri dishes (about 5.0 × 108 cells, corresponding approximately to 4 g wet tissue weight) were stimulated with 5 μM ionomycin and the lipids extracted and purified as described above. 250 pmol of [2H8]AnNH and [2H3]PEA (a generous gift by Dr. C. Felder, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, MD) as well as of hexadecanoylethanolamide and cis-eicosadienoylethanolamide, which are not synthesized by the cells under study, were introduced before extraction. TLC fractions with the same RF as synthetic AnNH and PEA were scraped off preparative TLC plates and acetylated with 100 μl of acetic anhydride in 400 μl of anhydrous pyridine. The reaction product was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) carried out on a Hewlett-Packard instrument consisting of a HP-GC 5890 series II apparatus equipped with a HP-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25-μm film thickness, cross-linked 5% HP ME siloxane), and of a HP-MS 5989B quadrupole mass analyzer equipped with an electron impact (EI) source operating at 70 Ev and 250°C. In order to improve sensitivity, acquisition was performed in the selected ion monitoring mode which consists in monitoring the presence in the GC eluate of only few selected ion fragments. GC was carried out using a 3-min isotherm step at 200°C followed by a temperature gradient from 200 to 300°C at a rate of 5°C/min (elium flow 1 ml/min, injector and transfer line temperature 260°C). The quantities of AnNH and PEA produced by cells were determined by constructing standard curves for stable isotope dilution GC-EIMS measurement of the two AEs. 250 pmol of either [2H8]AnNH or [2H3]PEA plus varied amounts (0, 50, 100, 250, 500, and 1000 pmol) of either non-deuterated compound were dissolved in methanol/water, extracted, purified by preparative TLC, derivatized, and analyzed by GC-EIMS as described above. Ion current ratios, which represent the ion current peak area for the unlabeled derivative divided by that of the deuterated derivative, were calculated for the molecular ions as well as the fragment ions corresponding to the loss of acetic acid (see “Results”). Standard curves were obtained by reporting on the abscissa axis the amount of AE and on the ordinate axis the ion current ratios. The amounts, in GC-EIMS analyses of cell extracts, of acetoxy-AnNH and -PEA, which, under the above elution conditions, are eluted after 18.1 and 13.6 min, respectively, were calculated by interpolation of the corresponding ion current ratios on the standard curves. Using the selected ion monitoring acquisition mode, amounts of acetoxy-AnNH and -PEA, as little as 5 pmol, can be detected (28Fontana A. Di Marzo V. Cadas H. Piomelli D. Prostaglandins Leukotriens Essent. Fatty Acids. 1995; 53: 301-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which starting from 5.0 × 108 cells, corresponds to about 0.1 pmol/107 cells. The uptake and degradation of [14C]AnNH and [14C]PEA by intact cells was studied as described previously (16Di Marzo V. Fontana A. Cadas H. Schinelli S. Cimino G. Schwartz J.-C. Piomelli D. Nature. 1994; 372: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar) by incubating for different time intervals confluent cells, in 6-well dishes (0.1-0.3 × 107 cells/well), with 1 ml of serum-free DMEM containing 10,000 cpm (1.2 μM) of either AE. The rate of disappearance of [14C]AEs from incubation mixtures and of appearance of [14C]AEs in cell extracts (after having washed three times the cells with 3 ml of DMEM, 1% bovine serum albumin) was taken as a measure of AE uptake, while the rate of formation of [14C]ethanolamine in the incubation liquid plus cell extracts, determined as described previously (16Di Marzo V. Fontana A. Cadas H. Schinelli S. Cimino G. Schwartz J.-C. Piomelli D. Nature. 1994; 372: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar), was taken as a measure of AE degradation. The contribution to carrier-mediated transport of non-carrier-mediated partitioning of AEs into membranes was determined by conducting incubations at 4°C. Incubations (20 min) were also carried out with different concentrations of [14C]AEs for Km and Vmax determination (in this case the uptake at 4°C was subtracted from that at 37°C), or with 50,000 cpm of either AE in the presence of 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 μM) or 0.1 mM N-ethylmaleimide (100 μM). Confluent RBL-2H3 cells were harvested and homogenized in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mM EDTA, using a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged sequentially at 800 × g (5 min), 10,000 × g (15 min), and 100,000 × g (30 min). Pellets from the last two centrifugations (in aliquots of 100-200 μg of total proteins) were incubated, unless otherwise stated, in 0.5 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, at 37°C for 30 min in the presence of 100,000 cpm (24 μM) of either [14C]anandamide, [14C]PEA, or other [14C]AEs (5.3 mCi/mmol, labeled on the ethanolamine moiety). Incubations were terminated by adding 1 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v), and lowering the temperature to 4°C. [14C]Ethanolamine produced by the enzymatic hydrolysis of [14C]AEs was determined by open bed chromatography of the aqueous phase on Porapak mini-columns (16Di Marzo V. Fontana A. Cadas H. Schinelli S. Cimino G. Schwartz J.-C. Piomelli D. Nature. 1994; 372: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar), followed by liquid scintillation counting. Experiments were carried out also with different amounts of total membrane proteins (0-400 μg) or with different concentrations of [14C]AEs, for Km and Vmax determination, or in different buffers at different pH values, as described previously (17Maurelli S. Bisogno T. De Petrocellis L. Di Luccia A. Marino G. Di Marzo V. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Thermal stability of the enzymatic activities was determined by keeping identical aliquots of the same enzyme preparation (100-200 μg of total proteins) at various temperatures for 5 min, and then conducting the incubation as usual (17Maurelli S. Bisogno T. De Petrocellis L. Di Luccia A. Marino G. Di Marzo V. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The effect of AACOCF3 (10 μM), PEA (50 μM), or AnNH (50 μM) was also determined by conducting the assay in identical aliquots of the same 10,000 × g pellet suspension and incubating as usual with and without the inhibitors. The effect of 5 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mM p-bromophenacyl bromide, 0.1 mM p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, 0.1 mM N-ethylmaleimide, 0.1 mM o-phenanthroline, and 0.1 mM benzamidine, all purchased from Sigma, was likewise studied. When stimulated with either S. chromofuscus phospholipase D (10 units/ml) or 5 μM ionomycin, J774 macrophages and RBL-2H3 basophils, prelabeled with [14C]ethanolamine, produced a radioactive lipid component (Fig. 1 and data not shown) which was absent in extracts from unstimulated cells and co-chromatographed with AE standards in TLC analyses (carried out in conditions (28Fontana A. Di Marzo V. Cadas H. Piomelli D. Prostaglandins Leukotriens Essent. Fatty Acids. 1995; 53: 301-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) that do not discriminate among different AEs). The same component, albeit in smaller amounts, was found also upon stimulation with albumin-DNP of RBL-2H3 cells previously sensitized with an antibody against this antigen (Fig. 1). A period of 20 min was employed for stimulation with ionomycin since pilot experiments conducted in J774 cells (Ref. 29Di Marzo V. De Petrocellis L. Sepe N. Buono A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar and data not shown) had shown that a 15-20-min incubation was necessary to observe maximal formation of AnNH. When the AE-like material (which was present in negligible amounts if AACOCF3 was not introduced in the incubation medium) was analyzed by RP-HPLC, a series of radiolabeled metabolites co-eluting with synthetic standards of AEs with different fatty acid chains was found in both cell types (Table I). The identity of PEA and AnNH was confirmed by labeling both cell types with either [3H]palmitic or [3H]AA, respectively, and by stimulating the cells with 5 μM ionomycin. Radiolabeled components, absent from extracts of unstimulated cells, and with the same chromatographic behavior as PEA and AnNH authentic standards in TLC and RP-HPLC analyses, were found in both macrophages (318 ± 34 and 280 ± 26 cpm, respectively, means ± S.D. of two experiments, subtracted of background) and basophils (155 ± 35 and 128 ± 16 cpm, respectively). Finally, conclusive identification of PEA and AnNH produced by ionomycin stimulation of either RBL-2H3 or J774 cells was achieved by GC-MS analyses of acetylated samples. These analyses were carried out using the selected ion monitoring mode of acquisition, which revealed the presence of GC peaks eluting with the same retention time and yielding the same electron impact MS fragment ions as synthetic acetylated AnNH and PEA (Fig. 2 and data not shown). The most abundant fragment for both compounds was that at m/z = 85 due to β-cleavage followed by McLafferty rearrangement of the fragments at, respectively, m/z = 329 and 281, which, in turn, are due to loss of acetic acid from the molecular ion peaks at m/z = 389 and 341. Other fragments were f"

Induced expression of CPT I mRNA was observed upon programmed cell death in the murine hematopoietic cell lines LyD9 and WEHI-231. To elucidate the role of CPT I in programmed cell death, we examined the effects of long-chain fatty acids and found that the addition of palmitate or stearate to cultured cells led to activation of a death program with a morphology resembling that of apoptosis. Other naturally occurring fatty acids, including myristate and palmitoleate, had no effect. Since both palmitate and stearate are sphingolipid precursors, the effect of these fatty acids on sphingolipid metabolism was tested. Our results indicate that apoptosis induced by palmitate or stearate is correlated with de novo synthesis of ceramide. Inhibition of CPT I by etomoxir enhanced palmitate-induced cell death and led to a further increase in ceramide synthesis.

Superfluous cells frequently arise during development of multicellular organisms (1Saunders J.W. Science. 1966; 154: 604-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 2Sulston J.E. Schierenberg E.

In addition, cells damaged by mutational events may emerge anytime in life and lead to cancer. Efficient removal of these cells is important to maintain morphogenesis and homeostasis and is achieved by an intrinsic mechanism resulting in cellular suicide. This death appears to be genetically controlled and has been termed programmed cell death. Tight regulation is essential since both excessive cell death and insufficient cell death will disrupt tissue integrity and may have fatal consequences for the organism. Cells undergoing the death program can often be recognized by a number of distinct morphological changes that have been described as apoptosis (5Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (6728) Google Scholar, 6Ellis R.E. Yuan J. Horvitz H.R. Ann. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 663-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar). Several genes regulating programmed cell death have been identified, and some insight into their function has been obtained (7White E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). Induced expression of a short polypeptide encoded by the reaper gene, for example, precedes apoptosis in Drosophila melanogaster Inactivation of reaper suppresses virtually all programmed cell death in Drosophila (8Steller H. Science. 1995; 267: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (2436) Google Scholar). The reaper polypeptide appears to have homology to the death domains found in the cytoplasmic region of several mammalian cell-surface receptors, including CD95 and TNFR1 (9Golstein P. Marguet D. Depraetere V. Cell. 1995; 81: 185-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Members of the interleukin 1-converting enzyme family of cysteine proteases also play an important role in the regulation of cell death. These enzymes promote apoptosis by converting inactive precursor polypeptides into their active form (10Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 801-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2279) Google Scholar). The BCL-2 protein, on the other hand, often extends cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis (11Vaux D.L. Cory S. Adams J.M. Nature. 1988; 335: 440-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar, 12Hockenbery D. Nunez G. Milliman C. Schreiber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3544) Google Scholar). Several BCL-2 homologs have been isolated, but their function remains vague. Analysis of signal transduction pathways has pointed toward sphingolipid metabolites as intracellular mediators of programmed cell death. Ceramide, in particular, has been shown to incite antiproliferative responses and apoptosis (13Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A.

Several stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor-α, γ-interferon, and ionizing radiation initiate sphingomyelin hydrolysis, thereby generating ceramide (15Kim M.-Y. Linardic C. Obeid L. Hannun Y. J.

Palmitoyl-CoA, an important precursor of sphingolipids synthesized de novo, is also a substrate for carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I), 1The abbreviations used are: CPT Icarnitine palmitoyltransferase IIL-3interleukin-3DTPAdiethylenetriaminepentaacetic acidDAGdiacylglycerol. which resides at the outer mitochondrial membrane, and, together with CPT II and a carnitine/acylcarnitine translocase, facilitates passage of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria for β-oxidation. CPT I catalyzes the rate-limiting step in this process and is a site for intracellular regulation of fatty acid metabolism, with malonyl-CoA acting as a physiological inhibitor (20McGarry J.D.

In this report, we demonstrate that two saturated fatty acids, palmitate and stearate, induce de novo synthesis of ceramide and programmed cell death. We show that inhibition of CPT I activity enhances both sphingolipid synthesis and palmitate-induced cell death. bcl-2β cDNA was a kind gift from Dr. D. Loh. Triacsin C and ISP1 were kindly provided by Dr. S. Omura (Kitasato Institute, Tokyo, Japan) and Dr. T. Kawasaki (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan), respectively. Etomoxir (2-[6-(4-chlorophenoxy)hexyl]oxirane-2-carboxylic acid) was purchased from ASAT AG (Zug, Switzerland). Fumonisin B1 and C2-ceramide were from BIOMOL Research Labs Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). L-[3-14C]Serine and the sn-1,2-diacylglycerol assay system were from Amersham Corp. Other chemicals were from Sigma and Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan). The murine cell lines LyD9 (21Palacios R. Karasuyama H. Rolink A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3687-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and WEHI-231 (22Lanier L.L. Warner N.L. J. Immunol. 1981; 126: 626-631PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described (23Ishida Y. Agata Y. Shibahara K. Honjo T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3887-3895Crossref PubMed Scopus (2250) Google Scholar). Long-chain fatty acids were dissolved in 30 mM KOH and gently heated when required. Fresh preparations were used for induction of cell death. Triacsin C and C2-ceramide were dissolved in ethanol and stored at −20°C at concentrations of 2 and 40 mM, respectively. ISP1 was in methanol (100 μM). The final concentration of alcohol in cell cultures was ≤0.1%. Fumonisin B1 and etomoxir were dissolved in water (10 mM each). Reagents dissolved in water were prepared immediately before use as cell culture additives. Total cellular RNA was extracted by centrifugation through a cesium chloride cushion in the presence of guanidium isocyanate (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified by oligo(dT) column chromatography (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The subtractive hybridization procedure was carried out as described (23Ishida Y. Agata Y. Shibahara K. Honjo T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3887-3895Crossref PubMed Scopus (2250) Google Scholar), except that first-strand cDNA for library construction was generated using poly(A)+ RNA extracted from LyD9 cells that had been deprived of IL-3 for 6 h. For subtracted library construction, the Cr0t value (normalized for the presence of high salt) (25Britten R.J. Graham D.E. Neufeld B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 29: 363-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar) was driven to 6565 mol/s/liter. The Cr0t value of a subtracted cDNA probe used for library screening reached 8307 mol/s/liter. This probe was radiolabeled to a specific activity of 2.5 × 109 dpm/μg. For plaque hybridizations, a sodium dodecyl sulfate-based hybridization solution (26Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7266) Google Scholar) was used to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Positive clones were picked; inserts were subcloned into a Bluescript® KS plasmid vector (Stratagene); and their nucleotide sequence was determined. Full-length cDNA was isolated from an ordinary LyD9 cDNA library, generated by standard procedures (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Northern hybridizations were carried out as described (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequences were determined using a Model 373 DNA Sequencer® (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). DNA ladder formation was detected as described previously (23Ishida Y. Agata Y. Shibahara K. Honjo T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3887-3895Crossref PubMed Scopus (2250) Google Scholar). Nuclear fragmentation was analyzed on a FACScan® flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) employing the method of Nicoletti et al. (27Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4431) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were collected and washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline. Samples were lysed and stained with propidium iodide for 1 h at room temperature before fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. For the analysis of de novo synthesized sphingolipids, LyD9 cells or WEHI-231 cells (5 × 106) were metabolically labeled for 3 h with [14C]serine (0.5 μM/ml) after starving them for 15 min in serine-free medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum. Lipids were extracted as described by Bligh and Dyer (28Bligh E.A. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar) and separated by one-dimensional TLC (29Hanada K. Nishijima M. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Fujita S. Ogawa T. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23527-23533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipid extracts were dissolved in a volume of 20 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v); 1-μl aliquots were spotted on TLC plates (Merck No. 5547) and separated in chloroform, methanol, 2 N ammonia (100:25:2.5, v/v/v). Radioactivity was detected and quantitated on a BAS 2000® image analyzer (Fujifilm). Lipid extractions and ceramide measurements were carried out as described (30Van Veldhoven P.P. Bishop W.R. Yurivich D.A. Bell R.M. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1995; 36: 21-30PubMed Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Lipids were dissolved in 20 μl of detergent consisting of 7.5% (w/v) n-octyl β-glucopyranoside and 5 mM cardiolipin in 1 mM DTPA. After sonication, 70 μl of a reaction mixture (containing 70 mM imidazole HCl, pH 6.6, 70 mM NaCl, 18 mM MgCl2, 1.4 mM EGTA, 2.8 mM dithiothreitol, and an Escherichia coli membrane preparation enriched in DAG kinase) was added. Included standards were ceramide and DAG. After TLC, radioactivity incorporated into ceramide phosphate and phosphatidic acid was measured as described above. The murine IL-3-dependent hematopoietic precursor cell line LyD9 undergoes apoptosis after IL-3 deprivation (21Palacios R. Karasuyama H. Rolink A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3687-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 23Ishida Y. Agata Y. Shibahara K. Honjo T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3887-3895Crossref PubMed Scopus (2250) Google Scholar). Apoptosis in LyD9 cells is inhibited by actinomycin D and therefore requires de novo RNA synthesis. To isolate cell death-associated genes, we screened a subtracted LyD9 cDNA library enriched for cDNAs induced after IL-3 withdrawal. Differential screening led to the isolation of a clone whose sequence is highly homologous to that of rat liver CPT I (GenBank™ accession number D49472) (31Esser V. Britton C.H. Weis B.C. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5817-5822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Northern analysis confirmed the induced expression of murine CPT I mRNA in IL-3-deprived LyD9 cells. To test whether CPT I mRNA levels after death induction are also increased in other cell lines, we used WEHI-231 cells, an immature B-cell line (22Lanier L.L. Warner N.L. J. Immunol. 1981; 126: 626-631PubMed Google Scholar), and found that CPT I gene expression was augmented after apoptosis, induced by cross-linking of surface IgM (Fig. 1). The enhanced expression of CPT I suggested an involvement of fatty acid metabolism in programmed cell death. We intended to test whether substrates of CPT I, like palmitoyl-CoA, affect apoptosis. Because palmitoyl-CoA is not cell-permeable, we tested the effect of palmitate, the direct precursor of palmitoyl-CoA, on cell survival. As shown in Fig. 2A, palmitate induced cell death in LyD9 cells as effectively as C2-ceramide, a cell-permeable ceramide analog previously shown to cause apoptosis (13Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1993; 259: 1769-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1618) Google Scholar). After the addition of palmitate, mitotic activity ceased. The following cell death was accompanied by cellular shrinkage, nuclear condensation, and nuclear fragmentation, a morphology typically observed in cells undergoing apoptosis. Another long-chain fatty acid, stearate, had similar effects. Other saturated fatty acids with carbon chain lengths ranging from C4 to C14 were tested; however, none of them could induce apoptosis. Furthermore, unsaturated fatty acids with carbon chain lengths ranging from C16 to C20, including several branched fatty acids, had no effect on cell viability. Representative data from experiments using laurate, myristate, palmitate, palmitoleate, and stearate, which have a similar chemical structure, are shown in Fig. 2A Cell death induction by palmitate was also observed in WEHI-231 cells (Fig. 2B), but not in bcl-2-transfected WEHI-231 cells (data not shown). As expected, induced expression of CPT I mRNA was found also when cell death was triggered by palmitate (Fig. 1). To determine whether CPT I activity can modulate palmitate-induced cell death, we blocked the enzyme using etomoxir, a highly specific irreversible CPT I inhibitor (32Bartlett K. Turnbull D.M. Sherratt H.S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1984; 12: 688-689Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 33Ratheiser K. Schneeweiss B. Waldhausl W. Fasching P. Korn A. Nowotny P. Rohac M. Wolf H.P. Metabolism. 1991; 40: 1185-1190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The drug was added to LyD9 cell cultures at concentrations that did not compromise viability (Fig. 3A). When etomoxir was applied together with palmitate, a dramatic increase in DNA ladder formation (Fig. 2B) and nuclear fragmentation (Fig. 3B) was observed. Indeed, concentrations of palmitate that were not effective alone caused substantial cell death in combination with etomoxir, as judged by the incidence of nuclear fragmentation events (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained using another cell line, WEHI-231 (data not shown). Thus, inhibition of CPT I by etomoxir appears to reduce the threshold for palmitate-induced apoptosis. Long-chain fatty acids are not available as CPT I substrates until they are activated by acyl-CoA synthetase. The active form of etomoxir is its CoA ester, which is also formed by this enzyme (32Bartlett K. Turnbull D.M. Sherratt H.S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1984; 12: 688-689Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Therefore, both palmitate and etomoxir depend on acyl-CoA synthetase activity to gain access to the mitochondrial CPT system. Acyl-CoA synthetase activity is inhibited by a number of competitive inhibitors, with triacsin C being the most potent member of this group (34Tomoda H. Igarashi K. Omura S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 921: 595-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 35Tomoda H. Igarashi K. Cyong J.-C. Omura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4214-4219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of nontoxic concentrations of triacsin C to LyD9 cells grown in the presence of palmitate and etomoxir significantly reduced the occurrence of nuclear fragmentation (Fig. 3C). Thus, palmitoyl-CoA and/or etomoxir-CoA are necessary for apoptosis induction. We speculated that inhibition of CPT I by etomoxir might prevent the entrance of palmitoyl-CoA into mitochondria and lead to its accumulation in the cytoplasm. Since palmitoyl-CoA is a precursor of sphingolipid synthesis, we considered the possibility that inhibition of CPT I leads to augmented production of ceramide. The initial step in ceramide synthesis is the formation of 3-ketodihydrosphingosine from palmitoyl-CoA and L-serine. This reaction is catalyzed by serine palmitoyltransferase, which is inhibited by the sphingosine analog ISP1 at picomole concentrations (36Miyake Y. Kozutsumi Y. Nakamura S. Fujita T. Kawasaki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 396-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The addition of ISP1 to LyD9 cells cultured with palmitate and etomoxir markedly reduced nuclear fragmentation (Fig. 3C). Similar data were obtained using fumonisin B1, which suppresses ceramide synthetase activity (37Wang E. Norred W.P. Bacon C.W. Riley R.T. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14486-14490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the final step in de novo synthesis of ceramide. These results suggest that de novo synthesized sphingolipids may be mediators of apoptosis induced by simultaneous treatment with palmitate and etomoxir. To verify that the addition of palmitate causes de novo synthesis of ceramide, LyD9 cells were metabolically labeled with [14C]serine. After lipid extraction, samples were analyzed by TLC. The amount of de novo synthesized sphingolipids was compared among samples treated with various combinations of the inhibitors described above. The results shown in Fig. 4 confirmed that palmitate addition to cultured cells leads to de novo synthesis of ceramide. An ∼3-fold increase in radiolabeled ceramide was observed in cells treated with 100 μM palmitate within 3 h as compared with cells treated with carrier alone. The additional use of etomoxir led to a further rise by a factor of 2. The use of palmitate and etomoxir in combination with either ISP1 or fumonisin B1 caused a reduction in de novo synthesized ceramide. ISP1 blocked ceramide synthesis almost completely, whereas fumonisin B1 was less effective, but still reduced ceramide build-up to a level similar to that seen in untreated cells (Fig. 4). Of note, the amounts of ceramide synthesized in the presence of the various reagents generally correlate with the extent of cell death observed (Fig. 3). To further validate the notion that palmitate-induced apoptosis is mediated by de novo synthesized sphingolipids and that CPT I confers a protective effect on this kind of cell death, it was important to establish that cell membrane-derived sphingomyelin does not contribute to ceramide production after treatment of cells with palmitate. Total cellular ceramide content was determined in an assay using E. coli DAG kinase. This assay allows the simultaneous measurement of ceramide phosphate derived from ceramide and of phosphatidic acid derived from DAG. The results substantiate our previous data that palmitate treatment leads to ceramide production that is enhanced in the presence of etomoxir (Fig. 5A). DAG levels were also increased in the presence of palmitate and etomoxir (Fig. 5B). More important, the use of ISP1 in addition to palmitate and etomoxir caused a decrease in ceramide phosphate to levels well below those seen in cells treated with carrier alone, indicating that, in fact, all ceramide generated under these conditions is derived from de novo synthesis. Therefore, sphingomyelin residing in the cell membrane compartment does not appear to be released. Palmitoyl-CoA and stearyl-CoA are important components of ceramide and other sphingolipids. To test whether both fatty acids have similar effects on de novo sphingolipid synthesis, stearate-treated LyD9 cells were metabolically labeled with [14C]serine as described above. The ceramide increase detected after apoptosis induction by stearate was almost indistinguishable from that seen after palmitate treatment (Fig. 4). However, in contrast to the observations made after cell death induction with palmitate, inhibition of CPT I by etomoxir did not lead to an additional increase in ceramide levels when stearate was used to induce apoptosis (Fig. 4). In agreement with these findings, etomoxir could not accelerate stearate-induced cell death as efficiently as it did when palmitate was used (Table I).Table I.Induction of programmed cell death by palmitate and stearate in LyD9 cellsIncubation+Palmitate (50 μM)aSamples treated with carrier alone for 24 h were 5.92%.+Stearate (50 μM)aSamples treated with carrier alone for 24 h were 5.92%.−Etomoxir+Etomoxir (200 μM)bSamples treated with etomoxir (200 μM) alone for 24 h were 4.17%.−Etomoxir+Etomoxir (200 μM)bSamples treated with etomoxir (200 μM) alone for 24 h were 4.17%.h%%813.3456.159.0921.311648.6791.6051.5678.212461.3298.2172.3296.75a Samples treated with carrier alone for 24 h were 5.92%.b Samples treated with etomoxir (200 μM) alone for 24 h were 4.17%. Open table in a new tab In this report, we describe an experimental system that allows the investigator to study programmed cell death mediated by de novo synthesis of sphingolipids. Ceramide production is induced by culturing cells of hematopoietic origin in the presence of palmitate and is further enhanced by simultaneous administration of the CPT I inhibitor etomoxir. The use of the pharmacological inhibitors fumonisin B1 and ISP1, which interfere with ceramide synthesis, rescues cells from apoptosis (Fig. 3). Increased de novo synthesis of ceramide may ultimately lead to increased levels of other sphingolipids, such as sphingosine and sphingomyelin. The data presented here do not exclude the possibility that sphingolipids other than de novo synthesized ceramide are directly involved in the cell deaths observed. Increased levels of sphingomyelin, for example, may be a target for sphingomyelinase and in turn be degraded to ceramide again. Sphingolipid metabolism has been shown to play an important role in the regulation of programmed cell death (38Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We show that CPT I, a component of the mitochondrial CPT enzyme complex, can protect from palmitate-triggered cell death by down-regulation of sphingolipid synthesis. This conclusion is based mainly on three observations. First, cell death induced by palmitic acid was accelerated after inhibition of CPT I by etomoxir (Fig. 3 and Table I). Second, an ∼2-fold increase in de novo synthesized ceramide was observed in cells treated with etomoxir and palmitic acid as compared with cells treated with palmitic acid alone (Fig. 4). The palmitate-mediated build-up of ceramide is blocked in the presence of ISP1 and, to a lesser extent, fumonisin B1. As a result, total cellular ceramide levels drop (Fig. 5). Cell membrane-derived sphingomyelin does not appear to be utilized to replenish ceramide levels because, in the presence of ISP1, ceramide levels drop below those seen in cells treated with carrier alone. The various aspects of sphingolipid metabolism are restricted to different cellular compartments (39Merrill Jr., A.H. Jones D.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1044: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Sphingomyelin within the cell membrane may not be released without the appropriate signals. Third, the sphingolipids produced after simultaneous treatment with palmitate and etomoxir were the cause of apoptosis because inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis by ISP1 and fumonisin B1 blocked the death program (Fig. 3). It is important to stress that the amounts of ceramide produced in the presence of the various inhibitors correlate well with the extent of cell death observed (Fig. 3, Fig. 4 and Table I). ISP1-dependent depletion of intracellular sphingolipid levels has recently been shown to cause cell death in the interleukin-2-dependent cytotoxic T-cell line CTLL-2 (40Nakamura S. Kozutsumi Y. Sun Y. Miyake Y. Fujita T. Kawasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1255-1257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As suggested by Nakamura et al. (40Nakamura S. Kozutsumi Y. Sun Y. Miyake Y. Fujita T. Kawasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1255-1257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), this may be due to a cell lineage-specific sensitivity toward sphingolipid depletion since viability in several other cell lines tested by the authors, including another interleukin-2-dependent cell line (F7), was not compromised. In our hands, neither LyD9 nor WEHI-231 cell growth was affected by 100 nM ISP1. The protection from apoptosis afforded by CPT I after death induction with palmitate is likely to be the consequence of long-chain fatty acyl-CoA clearance from the cytoplasm. The CPT enzyme complex effectively transfers activated long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix, where they serve as fuel for β-oxidation. Sphingolipid precursors, like palmitoyl-CoA, are subject to removal from the cytoplasm by this mechanism. Cells that express high amounts of CPT I per se are therefore expected to withstand palmitate-induced death. Indeed, hepatoma cell lines that are known to be rich in mitochondria were resistant to palmitate-induced apoptosis (data not shown). In addition to palmitate, only stearate was able to induce apoptosis and led to increased ceramide synthesis. However, inhibition of CPT I by etomoxir did not enhance sphingolipid synthesis when stearate was used for cell death induction. Since palmitoyl-CoA and stearyl-CoA are important components of ceramide and both are substrates for CPT I, the reason for this difference was not immediately obvious. However, the two activated fatty acids enter the sphingolipid synthesis pathway at different points. While palmitoyl-CoA, the substrate for serine palmitoyltransferase, constitutes the major non-amide-linked fatty acid component of ceramide, stearate is the predominant amide-linked fatty acid component of ceramide (41Kubota M. Kitahara S. Shimasaki H. Ueta N. Jpn. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 59: 59-64PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of the stearyl group to the ceramide backbone is one of the last steps in ceramide synthesis, whereas the condensation of serine and palmitoyl-CoA is the first dedicated step in ceramide synthesis. It may be that an accumulation of palmitoyl-CoA as a result of CPT I inhibition immediately influences ceramide metabolism, while the accumulation of stearyl-CoA without sufficient palmitoyl-CoA resources cannot effectively boost ceramide synthesis. Therefore, the available amount of palmitoyl-CoA may be rate-limiting in de novo synthesis of ceramide. Moreover, stearyl-CoA may be replaced by other long-chain fatty acids like palmitoyl-CoA to form the amide-linked component of ceramide, whereas the high substrate specificity of serine palmitoyltransferase prevents the use of another long-chain fatty acyl-CoA instead of palmitoyl-CoA. Inhibition of CPT I by etomoxir boosts cell death also in WEHI-231 cells (Fig. 2B), which have been shown to accumulate ceramide after cross-linking of surface Ig (42Gottschalk A.R. McShan C.L. Kilkus J. Dawson G. Quintans J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1032-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Ceramide has been reported to incite a stress-activated protein kinase. Of note, a <2-fold increase in intracellular ceramide levels was sufficient to induce stress-activated protein kinase and apoptosis (19Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar). Other protein kinases may also be activated by increased ceramide levels (43Kolesnick R. Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar, 44Lozano J. Berra E. Municio M.M. Diaz-Meco M.T. Dominguez I. Sanz L. Moscat J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19200-19202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CPT I association with programmed cell death was initially discovered based on enhanced expression of its mRNA in LyD9 cells deprived of IL-3 (Fig. 1). However, apoptosis in LyD9 cells induced by growth factor withdrawal was only slightly accelerated in the presence of etomoxir (data not shown). Moreover, de novo synthesis of ceramide after IL-3 deprivation was only marginal (Fig. 4). Therefore, the mitochondrial CPT system may play an additional, yet to be elucidated role in the lipid metabolism of programmed cell death. CPT I isoforms with overlapping tissue-specific expression have been characterized (45Weis B.C. Esser V. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18712-18715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CPT I isoform switching has recently been shown to take place in development (46Brown N.F. Weis B.C. Husti J.E. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8952-8957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Proteins with CPT activity are also associated with peroxisomes and microsomes (47Murthy M.S.R. Pande S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18283-18286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Murthy and Pande (48Murthy M.S. Pande S.V. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) have described a microsomal stress-regulated protein containing CPT activity. Additional analysis of the mitochondrial CPT system in the context of the cellular stress response will be required to further define the apoptosis-related aspects of this multienzyme complex."

The present study was carried out to elucidate the origin of NO2− found in decomposed peroxynitrite solutions. As revealed by stopped-flow spectroscopy, the decay of peroxynitrite followed first-order kinetics and exhibited a pKa of 6.8 ± 0.1. The reaction of peroxynitrite with NO was considered as one possible source of NO2−, but the calculated second order rate constant of 9.1 × 104M−1 s−1 is probably too small to explain NO2− formation under physiological conditions. Moreover, pure peroxynitrite decomposed to NO2− without apparent release of NO. Determination of NO2− and NO3− in solutions of decomposed peroxynitrite showed that the relative amount of NO2− increased with increasing pH, with NO2− accounting for about 30% of decomposition products at pH 7.5 and NO3− being the sole metabolite at pH 3.0. Formation of NO2− was accompanied by release of stoichiometric amounts of O2 (0.495 mol/mol of NO2−). The two reactions yielding NO2− and NO3− showed distinct temperature dependences from which a difference in Eact of 26.2 ± 0.9 kJ mol−1 was calculated. The present results demonstrate that peroxynitrite decomposes with significant rates to NO2− plus O2 at physiological pH.

Formation of NO2− was accompanied by release of stoichiometric amounts of O2 (0.495 mol/mol of NO2−). The two reactions yielding NO2− and NO3− showed distinct temperature dependences from which a difference in Eact of 26.2 ± 0.9 kJ mol−1 was calculated. The present results demonstrate that peroxynitrite decomposes with significant rates to NO2− plus O2 at physiological pH. Through formation of biologically active intermediates, this novel pathway of peroxynitrite decomposition may contribute to the physiology and/or cytotoxicity of NO and superoxide. INTRODUCTIONThe reaction between nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide anion (O2) yields peroxynitrite with a second order rate constant near the diffusion-controlled limit (k = 4.3-6.7 × 109M−1 s−1) (1Huie R.E.

The reaction constitutes an important sink for O2 because it is about twice as fast as the maximum velocity of SOD. 1The abbreviations used are:SODsuperoxide dismutaseSIN-13-(4-morpholinyl)-sydnoniminehydrochlorideHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyDTPAdiethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid. Consequently, peroxynitrite has been implicated in many pathological conditions including stroke (3Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. London E.D. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 599-635Google Scholar, 15Koppenol W.H. Moreno J.J. Pryor W.A. Ischiropoulos H. Beckman J.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 834-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar). The anion is rather stable in alkaline solutions but decomposes rapidly (t1/2 = 1 s at pH 7.4, 37°C) upon protonation to peroxynitrous acid (ONOOH) (pKa = 6.8) (16Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (6666) Google Scholar). Two pathways of ONOOH decomposition have been proposed. Some studies have argued that ONOOH is cleaved homolytically to generate hydroxyl and NO2 radicals. This hypothesis is based on the sensitivity to hydroxyl radical scavengers of certain peroxynitrite-induced reactions, including the formation of malondialdehyde from deoxyribose and the hydroxylation on the benzene ring of sodium benzoate, phenylalanine, and tyrosine (16Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (6666) Google Scholar, 17van der Vliet A. O'Neill C.A. Halliwell B. Cross C.E. Kaur H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Studies on decomposition of peroxynitrite by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy with the spin traps 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide and 4-pyridyl-1-oxide-N-tert-butylnitrone also provided evidence for the formation of free hydroxyl radicals (18Augusto O. Gatti R.M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 19Pou S. Nguyen S.Y. Gladwell T. Rosen G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1244: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Against this, Koppenol et al. (15Koppenol W.H. Moreno J.J. Pryor W.A. Ischiropoulos H. Beckman J.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 834-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar) concluded from molecular dynamic calculations that homolytic cleavage of ONOOH is highly improbable. This was reinforced by the independence of the rate of ONOOH decomposition on solvent viscosity (20Pryor W.A. Jin X. Squadrito G.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 3125-3128Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Based on these results, it was suggested that decomposition of ONOOH to NO3− involves formation of an activated intermediate (ONOOH*), which might account for the hydroxyl radical-like properties of peroxynitrite (15Koppenol W.H. Moreno J.J. Pryor W.A. Ischiropoulos H. Beckman J.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 834-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar, 21Pryor W.A. Jin X. Squadrito G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11173-11177Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar).There are several methods for the detection of peroxynitrite in biological systems. Since ONOOH decomposition yields an intermediate that nitrates phenolic compounds (22Beckman J.S. Ischiropoulos H. Zhu L. van der Woerd M. Smith C. Chen J. Harrison J. Martin J.C. Tsai M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 438-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, 23Ischiropoulos H. Zhu L. Chen J. Tsai M. Martin J.C. Smith C.D. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar), presence of nitrotyrosine in proteins was proposed to be evidence of peroxynitrite production in tissues (24Beckman J.S. Ye Y.Z. Anderson P.G. Chen J. Accavitti M.A. Tarpey M.M. White C.R. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). However, using both a monoclonal antibody specifically recognizing peroxynitrite-modified proteins (24Beckman J.S. Ye Y.Z. Anderson P.G. Chen J. Accavitti M.A. Tarpey M.M. White C.R. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar) as well as a published HPLC method (17van der Vliet A. O'Neill C.A. Halliwell B. Cross C.E. Kaur H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), we failed to detect tyrosine nitration by authentic peroxynitrite at concentrations <0.1 mM. 2S. Pfeiffer, and B. Mayer, unpublished observations. Spectrophotometric determination of dihydrorhodamine 123 oxidation was described as another sensitive assay for the specific detection of peroxynitrite at submicromolar concentrations (25Kooy N.W. Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. Beckman J.S. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1994; 16: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar), but in our hands, interference of several redox-active compounds precluded application of this method in cell-free assay systems. 3P. Klatt, and B. Mayer, unpublished observations. Under certain experimental conditions, indirect evidence for peroxynitrite production can be obtained by comparing NO release in the absence and presence of SOD. The peroxynitrite donor compound SIN-1, for example, does not release detectable amounts of free NO unless SOD is present in amounts sufficient to outcompete the reaction with concomitantly produced O2 (26Schmidt K. Klatt P. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 645-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Based on similar results obtained with purified neuronal NO synthase, we suggested that the enzyme generates NO and O2 simultaneously and hence functions as peroxynitrite synthase if incubated in vitro (27Mayer B. Klatt P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 655-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, in contrast with the widely held view that peroxynitrite decomposes exclusively to NO3−, considerable amounts of NO2− were also found as a major stable product of SIN-1 or NO synthase under physiological conditions.2 Similarly, excess NO2− formation was observed in peroxynitrite producing cells (28Lewis R.S. Tamir S. Tannenbaum S.R. Deen W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29350-29355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), suggesting that additional as yet unidentified reactions contribute to peroxynitrite decomposition.The present study was done to elucidate the fate of peroxynitrite in aqueous solution. Studies with the authentic compound, prepared in two different ways, identified a reaction leading to release of NO2− and O2 in a 2:1 stoichiometry as a route of peroxynitrite decomposition at pH ≥ 7.5.RESULTSDecomposition of peroxynitrite was monitored as decrease in absorbance at 302 nm at 20°C. As expected, decomposition at pH 3 was very fast and followed first order kinetics with a calculated rate constant (kcalc) of 0.86 ± 0.05 s−1 but slowed down at increasing pH. The kcalc values and corresponding Hill coefficients summarized in Table I demonstrate that peroxynitrite decay was first order under most conditions although Hill coefficients smaller than 1.0 were obtained at pH 8.0 (0.67 ± 0.02) and pH 11.0 (0.5 ± 0.1). Using the Hill equation for overall kinetic analysis of decomposition at pH 3-11, we calculated a pKa of 6.8 ± 0.1, which agrees well with published data (35Pryor W.A. Squadrito G.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 12Google Scholar). The possible contribution of transition metals to peroxynitrite decomposition was studied with 0.6 mM peroxynitrite in 0.5 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) in the presence of Cu(NO3)2, Fe(NH4)(SO4)2, Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2, and the metal chelator DTPA. Rates of decomposition were affected neither by the metal salts (0.1 mM each) nor by DTPA (0.1 and 1 mM). At a concentration of 2.5 mM DTPA, the peroxynitrite decay rate was enhanced 10-fold.Table IApparent first-order rate constants of peroxynitrite decomposition as a function of pHpHkcalcav (s−1)Hill coefficient30.86 ± 0.050.91 ± 0.0740.82 ± 0.011.09 ± 0.0750.71 ± 0.021.16 ± 0.0560.61 ± 0.011.11 ± 0.0370.39 ± 0.020.83 ± 0.0380.08 ± 0.0090.67 ± 0.0290.0298 ± 0.0091.10 ± 0.03100.0033 ± 0.00011.16 ± 0.05110.00008 ± 0.000010.5 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab Stopped-flow data showed that peroxynitrite decomposition was faster in the presence of ∼1 mM NO and that the increase in rate was dependent on the NO concentration. However, calculation of rate constants was difficult because the exact NO concentrations in these experiments were not known and the effect of NO was observed only as a relatively small increase of an already fast reaction. Therefore, we used an NO-sensitive electrode to measure the consumption of NO by known amounts of peroxynitrite. Fig. 1 shows a representative trace obtained by addition of 4 μl of a saturated NO solution to 1.8 ml of 0.1 M phosphate buffer, followed by two repetitive additions of peroxynitrite yielding concentrations of 0.75 μM each. Peroxynitrite induced a rapid consumption of NO with initial rates of 100 ± 9 nM s−1 and a stoichiometry close to 1:1 (0.75 μM peroxynitrite consumed 0.66 ± 0.06 μM NO). NO consumption (initial NO concentration 1-2 μM) was linear in the range of 0.25-1 μM peroxynitrite with initial rates ranging from 20 to 167 nM s−1 and a rate constant of 9.1 × 104M−1 s−1.We consistently observed that decomposition of peroxynitrite or [Me4N][ONOO] resulted in formation of about 70% NO3− and 30% NO2− at pH 7.4 and 37°C. As the NO2−/NO3− ratios were not affected by known metal chelators (Table II), our results do not support previous suggestions according to which formation of NO2− is due to contamination of peroxynitrite solutions with trace metals (36Plumb R.C. Edwards J.O. Herman M.A. Analyst. 1992; 117: 1639-1641Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) but indicate that NO2− release results from an as yet unrecognized pathway of peroxynitrite decomposition. To address this issue, we measured NO2− and NO3− after peroxynitrite decomposition at pH 3-9 and found that the relative amount of NO2− increased with increasing pH (Fig. 2A). Assuming that these results were not due to a reaction of peroxynitrite with contaminants in the stock solutions, our findings led us to speculate that 2 mol of peroxynitrite decomposed to 2 mol of NO2− and 1 mol of O2. Indeed, using a Clark-type O2 sensor, we found that the pH-dependent formation of NO2− was accompanied by release of stoichiometric amounts of O2 (Fig. 2A). The replot of the data (Fig. 2B) revealed a correlation coefficient of 0.988 and a slope of 0.495, suggesting that NO2− and O2 were released in a 2:1 stoichiometry.Table IIFormation of NO2− and NO3− upon decomposition of peroxynitrite in the presence of metal chelatorsChelatorNO2−0.1 mM%Control32.4 ± 6.3EDTA27.7 ± 5.9Neocuproine29.0 ± 5.4Cuprizone32.8 ± 2.2Bathophenanthroline32.8 ± 7.3DTPA32.6 ± 2.5 Open table in a new tab Fig. 2Decomposition of peroxynitrite yields NO2− and oxygen.

Fig. 3A shows that formation of NO2− and O2 increased when [Me4N][ONOO] (0.25 mM) was decomposed at increasing pH. The linear correlation of NO2− versus O2 shown in Fig. 3B yielded a slope of 0.657 and a correlation coefficient of 0.983. Although these data nicely confirmed the results obtained with the conventional preparation, two interesting differences were observed. First, while release of NO2− and O2 was negligible when the Baeyer-Villinger preparation of peroxynitrite was decomposed at pH ≤6.5 (cf Fig. 2A), decomposition of [Me4N][ONOO] resulted in formation of significant amounts of NO2− and O2, even at low pH. Second, release of NO2− and O2 from [Me4N][ONOO] did not level off at high pH values and appeared to account for virtually 100% of the decomposition occurring at pH 9.0. In all experiments, the measured sum of NO2− plus NO3− was close to theoretical values.Fig. 3Decomposition of [Me4N][ONOO] yields NO2− and oxygen. A, [Me4N][ONOO] (0.25 mM final initial concentration) was decomposed by incubation in 0.5 M phosphate buffer (pH 3.0-9.0) at 37°C for 1 h, followed by the determination of NO2−, NO3−, and O2 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” NO2− and NO3− were determined after measurement of O2 release in the same vials.

As shown in Table III, decomposition of 0.1 mM [Me4N][ONOO] at pH 7.4 yielded 16.2 and 52.1% NO2− at 5 and 56°C, respectively. A similar increase of the NO2−/NO3− ratio was observed with three concentrations (0.1, 0.5, and 1 mM) of the Baeyer-Villinger preparation (not shown). We also determined the temperature dependence for the overall peroxynitrite decomposition rate between 5 and 50°C by stopped-flow spectroscopy. The Arrhenius plots showed a strictly linear relationship between ln kobs and T−1 at pH 5.0 and 7.4 (Fig. 4A). From the slope of the plots, values for Eact of 92.0 ± 2 kJ mol−1 and 90.0 ± 0.8 kJ mol−1 were calculated for decomposition at pH 5.0 and 7.4, respectively. Assuming that the NO2−/NO3− ratios reflect the kinetic partitioning of the two pathways leading to NO2− and NO3− formation, the difference in Eact of the reations (ΔEact) was estimated as 26.2 ± 0.9 kJ mol−1 (Fig. 4B).Table IIIEffect of temperature on formation of NO2− and NO3− from [Me4N][ONOO]TemperatureNO2−NO3−% NO2−°CμMμM515.0 ± 1.177.7 ± 0.116.22422.1 ± 1.668.9 ± 1.624.33732.8 ± 0.759.4 ± 1.435.65649.2 ± 1.945.4 ± 1.252.1 Open table in a new tab Fig. 4Arrhenius plots of peroxynitrite decomposition yielding NO2− and NO3−.

Decomposition of 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mM peroxynitrite at pH 7.4 and 37°C resulted in formation of 29.6 ± 1.3, 25.5 ± 5.7, 27.3 ± 1.2, and 28.9 ± 1.5%, respectively, of NO2− (mean ± S.E.; n = 3 each).DISCUSSIONThe present study was carried out to identify the pathways of formation of NO2− in the course of peroxynitrite decomposition. Stopped-flow kinetic experiments confirmed that peroxynitrite decomposed rapidly upon protonation with a pKa of 6.8. The first order rate constants calculated for peroxynitrite decomposition at different pH values agreed well with previously published data (11Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Koppenol W.H. Moreno J.J. Pryor W.A. Ischiropoulos H. Beckman J.S. Chem. Res.

Under physiological conditions (pH 7.4 and 37°C), decomposition consistently yielded about 30% NO2−, whereas NO3− was the sole product at pH <5.0. Some studies indicated that under certain experimental conditions, peroxynitrite does indeed decompose to NO2−, but this was attributed to minor side reactions catalyzed by contaminating trace metals (36Plumb R.C. Edwards J.O. Herman M.A. Analyst. 1992; 117: 1639-1641Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 38Hughes M.N. Nicklin H.G. J. Chem. Soc. 1970; : 925-1970Crossref Google Scholar). In our hands, NO2− release was not metal-catalyzed because it was affected neither by chelators nor by metal ions (0.1 mM).Previous studies showed that small amounts of NO are released upon peroxynitrite decomposition under certain conditions (39Zhu L. Gunn C. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 452-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) and that peroxynitrite reacts with NO according to Equation 1 (40Crow J.P. Beckman J.S. Ignarro L. Murad F. Advances in Pharmacology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1995: 17-43Google Scholar, 41Miles A.M. Bohle D.S. Glassbrenner P.A. Hansert B. Wink D.A. Grisham M.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 29350-29355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) observed that activated macrophages release more NO2− than expected and considered Equation 1 as a possible source for excess NO2−. To judge whether Equation 1 could account for NO2− formation under physiological conditions, we studied the reaction of peroxynitrite with NO using both stopped-flow kinetic spectroscopy and an NO-sensitive electrode. These experiments yielded an apparent second order rate constant of 9.1 × 104M−1 s−1, which is in the same order of magnitude as the rate constant determined for peroxynitrite reacting with CO2 (42Lymar S.V. Hurst J.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 8867-8868Crossref Scopus (493) Google Scholar). However, the concentration of NO that would be required to render the reaction as fast as peroxynitrite decomposition (0.69 s−1 at pH 7.4 and 37°C) is so high (7.6 μM) that the reaction with NO is probably insignificant under most physiological conditions (43Laurent M. Lepoivre M. Tenu J.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).Since pure peroxynitrite decomposed to NO2− without detectable release of free NO, we considered additional pathways that could account for NO2− formation. Assuming that there were no other redox-active reaction partners of peroxynitrite present, we speculated that two peroxynitrite molecules might combine to release 2 molecules of NO2− and 1 molecule of O2 according to Equation 2.This hypothesis was corroborated by determination of NO2− and O2 formed upon decomposition of two different peroxynitrite preparations. With both products, we obtained linear correlations between NO2− and O2 release with slopes close to the theoretical value of 0.50. At pH 3.0-11.0, peroxynitrite decomposition was first order at most. Moreover, even though the temperature dependence of the NO2−/NO3− ratio clearly indicated that the two pathways have different activation energies (ΔEact = 26.2 ± 0.9 kJ mol−1), the Arrhenius plot for overall peroxynitrite decomposition at pH 7.4 (∼30% NO2−) was strictly linear and yielded an Eact value that was virtually identical to that observed at pH 5.0 (∼10% NO2−). The Eact of overall peroxynitrite decomposition was found to be rather high (92 ± 2 and 90.0 ± 0.8 kJ mol−1 at pH 5.0 and 7.4, respectively). A similar value (77.5 kJ mol−1 at pH 5.0) was reported by Koppenol et al. (15Koppenol W.H. Moreno J.J. Pryor W.A. Ischiropoulos H. Beckman J.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 834-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar).From these observations, we conclude that the rate-limiting step in both reactions is the same, a conformational change of ONOOH to an activated intermediate that either rearranges to HNO3 (15Koppenol W.H. Moreno J.J. Pryor W.A. Ischiropoulos H. Beckman J.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 834-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar, 35Pryor W.A. Squadrito G.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 12Google Scholar) or undergoes a reaction with peroxynitrite anion to yield NO2− and O2 (this study). Any potential model must account for the thoroughly characterized kinetics of peroxynitrite decomposition as well as the stoichiometries of the end products. Further, a bimolecular rate law for either of the product determining steps is excluded because the partitioning of the two pathways does not depend on the concentration of peroxynitrite. Fig. 5 shows a hypothetical pathway of peroxynitrite decomposition that appears to be most consistent with the data presented both here and in the literature. According to this scheme, activated ONOOH can either isomerize to NO3− or decompose to HO and NO2 radicals. At alkaline pH, the OH radical may react with peroxynitrite anion yielding O2, NO, and OH−, and NO could react with NO2 radicals to yield N2O3 and finally nitrite.Fig. 5Hypothetical mechanism of peroxynitrite decomposition to nitrite and nitrate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The novel pathway of peroxynitrite decomposition described here could have important physiological consequences, as it possibly involves generation of intermediates with biological activities not attributed so far to peroxynitrite. In a recent paper, it was reported that peroxynitrite decomposition could lead to release of singlet O2 (44Khan A.U. J. Biolumin. Chemilumin. 1995; 10: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). If that observation were due to the novel reaction proposed here, peroxynitrite-dependent toxicity might be mediated by singlet O2 toxicity under certain pathophysiological conditions. Alternatively, decomposition to H NO2− and O2 may be responsible for the observed NO-like biological activity of peroxynitrite. At pH 7.4, peroxynitrite oxidizes hemoglobin to methemoglobin with an efficiency of about 20% (26Schmidt K. Klatt P. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 645-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and it is tempting to speculate that this reaction represents scavenging by hemoglobin of the NO that is formed as intermediate during decomposition to NO2− and O2 (Fig. 5). Also, our working hypothesis involves intermediary formation of N2O3, a potent nitrosating agent that could account for the observed peroxynitrite-induced nitrosation of GSH, especially in light of our findings that the nitrosation reaction has a pronounced pH dependence and does not occur at significant rates below pH 7.5 (45Mayer B.

Accordingly, reactive intermediates formed in the course decomposition to NO2− and O2 could be responsible for stimulation of soluble guanylyl cyclase by peroxynitrite (45Mayer B. Schrammel A.

https://openalex.org/W1989710374,"The mammalian mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase homologue p38 has been shown to be activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as physical and chemical stresses. We now show that a variety of hemopoietic growth factors, including Steel locus factor, colony stimulating factor-1, granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor, and interleukin-3, activate p38 MAP kinase and the downstream kinase MAPKAP kinase-2. Furthermore, although these growth factors activate both p38 MAP kinase and Erk MAP kinases, we demonstrate using a specific inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase, SB 203580, that p38 MAP kinase activity was required for MAP kinase-activated protein kinase-2 activation. Conversely p38 MAP kinase was shown not to be required for in vivo activation of p90rsk, known to be downstream of the Erk MAP kinases. Interleukin-4 was unique among the hemopoietic growth factors we examined in failing to induce activation of either p38 MAP kinase or MAP kinase-activated protein kinase-2. These findings demonstrate that the activation of p38 MAP kinase is involved not only in responses to stresses but also in signaling by growth factors that regulate the normal development and function of cells of the immune system."

INTRODUCTIONMast cells, an important cell type in allergic diseases, are widely distributed throughout vascularized tissue and epithelia. Activation of mast cells by aggregation of high affinity IgE receptors causes degranulation, releasing stored mediators of inflammation such as histamine and serotonin. Mast cell activation also induces the synthesis and release of leukotrienes and prostaglandin D2 (PGD2). Ligand stimulation in most cells elicits a relatively slow production of prostaglandins, peaking only after 4-6 h (1Herschman H.R. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 241-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 2Herschman H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). In contrast, PGD2 synthesis in activated mast cells occurs in two stages, a rapid, early phase and a late, delayed phase (3Kawata R. Reddy S.T. Wolner B. Herschman H.R. J.

PLA2 enzymes release arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids. Free arachidonate is converted to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), a common precursor for all prostanoids, by prostaglandin synthases. Several PLA2 enzymes have been implicated in arachidonate release following ligand stimulation of various cell types (5Clark J.D. Schievella A.R. Nalefski E.A. Lin L.L. J. Lipid Mediat.

Many cells also express two distinct prostaglandin synthases: PGS1, a primarily constitutively expressed form, and PGS2, an inducible PGS expressed following appropriate ligand stimulation in different cell types (1Herschman H.R.

BioEssays. 1995; 17: 1031-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), demonstrated that ligand-induced prostaglandin production in fibroblasts and macrophages requires induced PGS2 expression, despite the presence of active PGS1 enzyme. In contrast, the rapid, early phase of PGD2 synthesis in activated mast cells is mediated by pre-existing PGS1 (3Kawata R. Reddy S.T. Wolner B. Herschman H.R. J.

The second, delayed phase of PGD2 synthesis in activated mast cells is similar to prostaglandin production in growth factor-induced fibroblasts and endotoxin-induced macrophages, requiring activation-induced PGS2 expression (3Kawata R.

Immunol. 1995; 155: 4445-4453PubMed Google Scholar).Following activation, mast cells secrete a low molecular weight PLA2, sPLA2 (9Fonteh A.N. Bass D.A. Marshall L.A. Seeds M. Samet J.M. Chilton F.H.

Activation of mast cells also induces the activation, translocation, and expression of cytoplasmic cPLA2 (10Nakatani Y. Murakami M. Kudo I. Inoue K. J.

In this report we investigate the roles of sPLA2 and cPLA2 in early, PGS1-dependent PGD2 synthesis and late, PGS2-dependent PGD2 synthesis following mast cell activation by aggregation of high affinity IgE receptors.DISCUSSIONAggregation of mast cell IgE receptors results in two phases of PGD2 production, an early burst completed within 10-30 min and a second phase peaking after 5-6 h (3Kawata R. Reddy S.T. Wolner B. Herschman H.R. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 818-825PubMed Google Scholar, 4Murakami M. Bingham III, C.O. Matsumoto R. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4445-4453PubMed Google Scholar). Pharmacologic studies demonstrated that the early PGD2 burst is due solely to activity of pre-existing PGS1 enzyme, while delayed PGD2 production in activated mast cells requires induced PGS2 synthesis (3Kawata R. Reddy S.T. Wolner B. Herschman H.R. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 818-825PubMed Google Scholar, 4Murakami M. Bingham III, C.O. Matsumoto R. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4445-4453PubMed Google Scholar). Arachidonic acid, released from membrane phospholipids by PLA2, is a substrate for both PGS enzymes. Mast cells contain at least two distinct arachidonic acid precursor pools, whose arachidonate products remain segregated after release from cellular phospholipids (9Fonteh A.N. Bass D.A. Marshall L.A. Seeds M. Samet J.M. Chilton F.H. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5438-5446PubMed Google Scholar, 22Fonteh A.N. Chilton F.H. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 563-570PubMed Google Scholar, 23Chilton F.H. Fonteh A.N. Surette M.E. Triggiani M. Winkler J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Moreover, mast cells have at least three distinct PLA2 isoforms (6Murakami M. Kudo I. Inoue K. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1995; 12: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 24Murakami M. Kudo I. Umeda M. Matsuzawa A. Takeda M. Komada M. Fujimori Y. Takahashi K. Inoue K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The temporal separation of PGD2 production by PGS1 and PGS2 in activated mast cells suggested that distinct phospholipid arachidonate pools and distinct phospholipases might provide arachidonate to the two prostaglandin synthase enzymes.The Late Phase of PGD2 Production in Activated Mast CellsThe inability of either antibody to sPLA2 or SB203347, the sPLA2 inhibitor, to reduce PGS2-dependent PGD2 production demonstrates that sPLA2 plays no role in the late phase of PGD2 synthesis. MAFP was initially described as a cytoplasmic type IV cPLA2 inhibitor, with no effect on type II sPLA2 (19Huang Z. Liu S. Street I. Laliberte F. Abdullah K. Desmarais S. Wang Z. Kennedy B. Payette P. Riendeau D. Weech P. Gresser M. Mediat. Inflamm. 1994; 3: 307-308Google Scholar). The late, PGS2-dependent phase of PGD2 production in activated mast cells is completely blocked by MAFP, suggesting that cPLA2 is required to provide arachidonate for this second component of PGD2 production. MAFP, however, also inhibits a cytosolic, calcium-independent PLA2 (iPLA2) (21Lio Y.C. Reynolds L.J. Balsinde H. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). When assayed previously, iPLA2 could not be detected in bone marrow-derived murine mast cells (25Currie S. Roberts E.F. Spaethe S.M. Roehm N.W. Kramer R.M. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 923-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In our experiments, we found only a small fraction of MAFP-inhibitable phospholipase A2 activity present in extracts of activated mast cells to be calcium-independent (Fig. 10). In addition, specific iPLA2 inhibition in stimulated P388D1 macrophages enhances, rather than inhibits, arachidonate release (20Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). MAFP inhibition of late, PGS2-dependent PGD2 production in activated mast cells is, therefore, likely to be due to type IV cPLA2 inactivation. cPLA2 and PGS2 appear to be metabolically coupled in activated mast cells for the delayed phase of PGD2 synthesis. However, conclusive proof of this hypothesis will require the specific suppression of cPLA2 synthesis by antisense cPLA2, development of pharmacologic agents that more specifically inhibit cPLA2, or mast cells derived from animals in which the cPLA2 gene has been disrupted.The Early Phase of PGD2 Production in Activated Mast CellsPrevious experiments suggested that sPLA2 plays a role in PGD2 production following mast cell activation (9Fonteh A.N. Bass D.A. Marshall L.A. Seeds M. Samet J.M. Chilton F.H. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5438-5446PubMed Google Scholar). The ability, demonstrated here, of both a monoclonal antibody to sPLA2 (9Fonteh A.N. Bass D.A. Marshall L.A. Seeds M. Samet J.M. Chilton F.H. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5438-5446PubMed Google Scholar) and a specific sPLA2 inhibitor, SB203347 (15Marshall L.A. Hall R.H. Winkler J.D. Badger A. Bolognese B. Roshak A. Louis-Flamberg P. Sung C.-M. Chabot-Fletcher M. Adams J.L. Mayer R.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 274: 1254-1262PubMed Google Scholar), to completely block early, PGS1-dependent PGD2 production following mast cell activation supports this conclusion and demonstrates that sPLA2 and PGS1 are metabolically coupled. sPLA2 activity is required for the early phase of PGD2 production in activated mast cells. The low molecular weight, secreted PLA2 from mast cells has not been molecularly characterized. Three related murine genes encoding low molecular weight, secreted PLA2 enzymes of related structure are known, each with a cell type-specific distribution pattern (26Chen J. Engle S.J. Seilhamer J.J. Tischfield J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23018-23024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Tischfield J.A. Xia Y.-R. Shih D.M. Klisak I. Chen J. Engle S.J. Siakotos A.N. Winstead M.V. Seilhamer J.J. Allamand V. Gyapay G. Lusis A.J. Genomics. 1996; 32: 328-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). It will be of great interest to identify the PLA2 isoform(s) secreted by activated mast cells, since this enzyme(s) may represent an important target in mast cell eicosanoid production.Balsinde and Dennis (20Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) have demonstrated, in activated P388D1 macrophages, that “a functionally active cPLA2 appears to be necessary for sPLA2 to act.” Their results prompted us to examine the effects of preincubation of mast cells with MAFP on the early, sPLA2/PGS1-dependent phase of PGD2 synthesis in activated mast cells. An MAFP-sensitive step is required for one-half to two-thirds of the early phase of PGD2 production following the activation of mast cells by aggregation of their IgE receptors (Fig. 9). Since we have verified the inability of MAFP to block the enzymatic activity of either recombinant sPLA2 (Fig. 6) or the sPLA2 activity present in mast cell supernatants (Fig. 10), we conclude that the MAFP-sensitive step in early PGD2 production in response to aggregation of mast cell IgE receptors is likely to be mediated by cPLA2. Like the data of Balsinde and Dennis (20Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), our results suggest that a cPLA2-mediated function is required prior to the action of sPLA2. It should be emphasized that, although there exists a cPLA2-dependent event required for the early phase of PGD2 synthesis in activated mast cells, cPLA2 does not release arachidonic acid that is then available for PGD2 production by PGS1. Inhibition of sPLA2 by either SB203347 or mAbF10, which do not inhibit cPLA2, prevents all PGD2 production in the early phase of mast cell activation (Figs. 1, 2, 3).Spatial Separation of PGD2 Production in Mast CellsIn most cells, PGS1 is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (1Herschman H.R. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 241-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 2Herschman H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). In contrast, biochemical and ultrastructural analysis suggested that mast cell granules contain phospholipids (28Chock S.P. Schmauder-Chock E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2862-2868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), sPLA2 (29Chock S.P. Schmauder-Chock E.A. Cordella-Miele E. Miele L. Mukherjee A.B. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 619-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and PGS1 (30Schmauder-Chock E.A. Chock S.P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1989; 37: 1319-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Degranulation and exposure of granule contents to high extracellular calcium following aggregation of IgE receptors may activate sPLA2, leading to production of arachidonic acid substrate for PGS1 and the synthesis of the early PGD2 burst. Additional investigation of sPLA2 and PGS1 localization in resting and activated mast cells will be of great interest, now that two temporal phases of mast cell PGD2 production have been demonstrated.PGS2 is detected in both the endoplasmic reticulum and the nuclear envelope of mitogen-stimulated fibroblasts (31Morita I. Schindler M. Regier M.K. Otto J.C. Hori T. DeWitt D. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10902-10908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Subcellular PGS2 localization has not been reported in mast cells. Following mast cell activation, cPLA2 moves from the cytoplasm to the nuclear envelope (13Glover S. Bayburt T. Jonas M. Chi E. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15359-15367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Ligand treatment also stimulates translocation of cPLA2 to the nuclear fraction in Chinese hamster ovary cells (32Schievella A.R. Regier M.K. Smith W.L. Lin L.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30749-30754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) and in macrophages (33Peters-Golden M. McNish R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Assuming PGS2 is also localized predominantly at the nuclear envelope in mast cells after activation-induced synthesis, the data are consistent with the following model. Activated mast cells translocate cPLA2 to the nuclear envelope, where this enzyme releases arachidonate from phospholipids. Newly synthesized PGS2, also present in the nuclear envelope, utilizes this arachidonate to catalyze the late phase of PGD2 production. Mast cell PGS1 may not be able to use the arachidonate produced by cPLA2 for several reasons. It seems most likely that physical sequestration of PGS1 in mast cells may make cPLA2-dependent arachidonate, produced at the nuclear envelope, inaccessible to PGS1. Alternatively, PGS1 may be inactivated by a suicide reaction (34Rome L.H. Lands W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4863-4865Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) during the early PGD2 synthesis phase, prior to adequate activation-induced cPLA2 translocation.Identification of the PLA2 and PGS isoforms that mediate the two phases of PGD2 production in activated mast cells may permit development of additional pharmacologic agents that can discriminate between these two PGD2 production pathways. In addition to mediating PGS1-dependent PGD2 production by mast cells following activation, sPLA2 released by activated mast cells can also initiate trans-cellular prostaglandin production by mobilizing arachidonate in a distal cell as substrate for PGS1 in that cell (16Reddy S.T. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 186-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Specific inhibition of mast cell sPLA2 may, therefore, be an important pharmacologic target for several modes of prostaglandin production in chronic and acute inflammatory responses. INTRODUCTIONMast cells, an important cell type in allergic diseases, are widely distributed throughout vascularized tissue and epithelia. Activation of mast cells by aggregation of high affinity IgE receptors causes degranulation, releasing stored mediators of inflammation such as histamine and serotonin. Mast cell activation also induces the synthesis and release of leukotrienes and prostaglandin D2 (PGD2). Ligand stimulation in most cells elicits a relatively slow production of prostaglandins, peaking only after 4-6 h (1Herschman H.R.

BioEssays. 1995; 17: 1031-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), demonstrated that ligand-induced prostaglandin production in fibroblasts and macrophages requires induced PGS2 expression, despite the presence of active PGS1 enzyme. In contrast, the rapid, early phase of PGD2 synthesis in activated mast cells is mediated by pre-existing PGS1 (3Kawata R. Reddy S.T. Wolner B. Herschman H.R. J.

The second, delayed phase of PGD2 synthesis in activated mast cells is similar to prostaglandin production in growth factor-induced fibroblasts and endotoxin-induced macrophages, requiring activation-induced PGS2 expression (3Kawata R.

Activation of mast cells also induces the activation, translocation, and expression of cytoplasmic cPLA2 (10Nakatani Y. Murakami M. Kudo I. Inoue K. J.

We report here the isolation of three overlapping genomic clones of human MUC5B spanning approximately 40 kilobases. We have determined their partial restriction maps and the intron-exon boundaries of the central region encoding a single open reading frame. This coding region has been completely sequenced. Its length is 10,713 base pairs, and it encodes a 3570-amino acid peptide. Nineteen subdomains have been individualized. Some subdomains show similarity to each other, creating larger composite repeat units that we have called super-repeats. Four super-repeats of 528 amino acid residues are thus observed within the central exon. Each comprises (i) a subdomain composed of 11 repeats of the irregular repeat of 29 amino acid residues, (ii) a unique conserved subdomain with no typical repeat, and (iii) a cysteine-rich subdomain. This latter subdomain has high sequence similarity to the cysteine-rich domains described in MUC2 and MUC5AC. Sequence data of these three genes, together with their clustered organization, lead us to suggest that they may be a part of a multigene family. The super-repeat present in MUC5B is the largest ever determined in mucin genes and the central exon of this gene is, by far, the largest reported for a vertebrate gene.

Mammalian respiratory, gastrointestinal, and reproductive tracts are protected by mucus secretions, of which the major components are the mucins. The mucins form a heterogeneous group of high molecular mass, polydisperse, highly glycosylated macromolecules. They are synthesized and secreted by specialized cells in the epithelium. Considerable advances have been made over the past years toward our understanding of the structure and function of mucin glycoproteins. The isolation of mucin cDNA clones introduced a new approach to the structure of the mucins. Until now, at least eight human mucin genes have been identified (see Ref. 1Gendler S.J. Spicer A.P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 607-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar for review). The chromosomal localization of these genes has been established: four of them, MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC5B, and MUC6, are clustered on 11p15.5 between the HRAS and IGF2 genes, MUC1 is on 1q21-24, MUC3 on 7q22, MUC4 on 3q29, and MUC7 on chromosome 4q13-21. Recently, a cDNA called pAM1 has been cloned from a human tracheal library and localized on chromosome 12 (2Shankar V. Gilmore M.S. Elkins R.C. Sachdev G.P. Biochem.

More recently, a novel cDNA (pSM2-1) from human sublingual gland has been described (6Troxler F.R. Offner G.D. Zhang F. Iontcheva I. Oppenheim F.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 1112-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). MUC1, which is developmentally regulated and aberrantly expressed by carcinomas, encodes a membrane-associated mucin-like glycoprotein. In contrast, the other described genes code for secreted mucins (1Gendler S.J. Spicer A.P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 607-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). Mucins present extended arrays of tandemly repeated sequences, producing a protein core rich in potential O-glycosylation sites and having a high content of serine, threonine, proline, glycine, and alanine. The tandem repeat units vary in length from as few as 24 bp 1The abbreviations used are: bpbase pairkbkilobase(s)ntnucleotideaaamino acidPCRpolymerase chain reactionRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsRT-PCRreverse transcription PCR. in MUC5AC (7Aubert J.P.

In the MUC2 gene product, these tandem repeats are flanked by cysteine-rich subdomains of approximately 845 residues upstream and 700 residues downstream. Both cysteine-rich subdomains have sequences similar to the D-domains of human pro-von Willebrand factor (9Gum Jr., J.R. Hicks J.W. Toribara N.W. Rothe E.-M. Lagace R.E. Kim Y.S. J. Biol.

In addition it is becoming apparent that an abnormal expression of the mucin genes occurs in various disease states and in conditions associated with a high risk of adenoma or carcinoma (15Ho J.J.L.

Therefore, the study of the factors responsible for the regulation of mucin expression is of great interest. With this goal, it is necessary to acquire a detailed knowledge of the genomic structure of the mucin genes. The complete sequences of MUC1 (18Gendler S. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Duhig T. Rothbard J.

The whole genomic structure is only known for MUC1 (21Lancaster C.A. Peat N. Duhig T. Wilson D. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Gendler S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 1019-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), although the partial genomic organization of MUC7 has also been reported recently (22Bobek L.A. Liu J. Sait S.N.J. Shows T.B. Bobek Y.A. Levine M.J. Genomics. 1996; 31: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We have previously described four human tracheobronchial cDNA clones with degenerate 87-bp tandem repeats belonging to the human MUC5B gene (23Dufossé J. Porchet N. Audié J.P. Guyonnet-Dupérat V. Laine A. VanSeuningen I. Marrakchi S. Degand P. Aubert J.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has focused considerable attention upon this gene which is expressed in mucous glands of tracheobronchial tissue, submaxillary glands, gall bladder, and endocervix (24Audié J.P.

In this paper, we present the partial restriction map of the three overlapping genomic clones of the MUC5B gene spanning more than 40 kb and the complete sequence of its central exon which encompasses 10,713 bp and codes for a 3570-amino acid peptide. Nineteen subdomains are individualized. Some subdomains show similarity to each other, creating larger composite repeat units that we call super-repeats. In addition to the tandem repeat of 29 amino acid residues as described previously (23Dufossé J. Porchet N. Audié J.P. Guyonnet-Dupérat V. Laine A. VanSeuningen I. Marrakchi S. Degand P. Aubert J.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), which we now define as being irregular or imperfectly conserved, four repeats of 528 amino acid residues are observed within the central exon. Each comprises 11 repeats of the irregular repeat of 29 amino acid residues, a unique conserved domain of 111 amino acid residues with no typical repeat but rich in threonine, serine, and alanine and a cysteine-rich region of 108 amino acid residues. This latter subdomain has sequence similarity with cysteine-rich domains of MUC2 and MUC5AC or its related cDNAs. This super-repeat is the largest ever determined in mucin genes. DNA from 20 healthy unrelated volunteers was prepared from leukocytes. It was digested with the following restriction endonucleases: BamHI, BglII, EcoRI, HindIII, KpnI, PstI, XbaI, and XhoI. Fragments were separated by electrophoresis in phosphate buffer through 1% agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized as described previously (23Dufossé J. Porchet N. Audié J.P. Guyonnet-Dupérat V. Laine A. VanSeuningen I. Marrakchi S. Degand P. Aubert J.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). JER57, the longest cDNA of MUC5B isolated previously (23Dufossé J. Porchet N. Audié J.P. Guyonnet-Dupérat V. Laine A. VanSeuningen I. Marrakchi S. Degand P. Aubert J.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), was first used as a probe to screen a genomic EMBL4 phage library (12Guyonnet-Dupérat V. Audié J.P. Debailleul V. Laine A. Buisine M.P. Zouitina-Galiègue S. Pigny P. Degand P. Aubert J.P. Porchet N. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). One positive clone CEL5 was isolated and studied. Other screenings only gave the same clone. To isolate larger genomic clones of the MUC5B gene, we screened a human placenta genomic DNA library in pWE15 cosmids provided by Stratagene using the JER57 probe. Two positive clones BEN1 and BEN2 were isolated and studied. The restriction mapping strategy of Wahl et al. (27Wahl G.M. Lewis K.A. Ruiz J.C. Rothenberg B. Zhao J. Evans G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2160-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) was slightly modified as follows. Cosmids were digested to completion with the restriction enzyme NotI. For each of the other restriction enzymes used, one part of this NotI-digested cosmid was digested to completion and a second part partially digested with the enzyme in order to generate a set of fragments that began at the T7 or T3 promoters and ended at the site of cleavage of the chosen enzyme. These NotI-terminated digestion products were fractionated on an agarose gel (0.6%) and blotted to Hybond™-N+ membrane (Amersham Corp.) by capillary blotting overnight. The fragments were then mapped relative to the T7 or T3 promoters by hybridizing the blot with end-labeled oligonucleotide-sequencing primers specific for these promoters. The 5′ AmpliFINDER RACE kit (Clontech, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) was used to synthesize first strand cDNA from 2 μg of human tracheal poly(A)+ RNA obtained from Clontech with NAU58 as first primer (5′-TTGTAGCACATCTTGAAGACGCCC-3′, antisense nt 776-799) followed by the ligation of the 5′ anchor adapter. The RACE-PCR was performed in 50-μl reaction volumes containing 5 μl of 10 × buffer, 5 μl of 10 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 2.5 μl of reversed transcribed target cDNA, 10 pmol of each primer (NAU57, 5′-ACGGATCCCCTGCACACCAGGCCGAAGTG-3′, antisense nt 741-762 with underlined nucleotides added in 5′ to generate a BamHI restriction site and 5′ anchor primer), and 1.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim). After overlaying with 50 μl of mineral oil (Sigma), the mixture was denatured at 94°C for 3 min followed by 30 cycles at 94°C for 1 min, 71°C for 1 min, 72°C for 2 min. The elongation step was extended for an additional 10-min period. Secondary amplification was performed using 2.5 μl of the primary amplification product. The thermal cycling protocol used was the same as for the primary RACE amplification. Total RNA was extracted from a human gall bladder using the guanidine isothiocyanate/CsCl method (28Glisin V. Orkvenjakov R. Byus C. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2633-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar, 29Crépin M. Porchet N. Aubert J.P. Degand P. Biorheology. 1990; 27: 471-484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A sample (0.5 μg) of human tracheal poly(A)+ RNA (Clontech) and a sample (1 μg) of total RNA extracted from human gall bladder were reverse-transcribed with the 1st-STRAND™ cDNA synthesis kit (Clontech) using random primers according to the manufacturer's instructions. The first strand cDNA (8 μl) and cosmid DNA (30 ng) were amplified by PCR with various primers: NAU112 (antisense) 5′-ACCAGGCTGGGCCTGGGCACGGCA-3′ (nt 3105-3129), NAU113 (sense) 5′-GACGACTACAGCCACTGCCCCAGTACCCTA-3′ (nt 1671-1697), NAU81 (sense) 5′-CCAACTGGACCCTGGCACAGGTG-3′ (nt 694-716), NAU82 (antisense) 5′-GACTGAGGAGGACACAGTGGACACG-3′ (nt 10601-10625), NAU128 (sense) 5′-CGTGTCCACTGTGTCCTCCTCAGTC-3′ (nt 10601-10625), NAU71 (antisense) 5′-AGTGCTGATTGCACACTGCGT-3′ (in the first exon downstream the central exon), NAU136 (sense) 5′-TTCAACTATGAAATCCGTGTGTTC-3′ (nt 8493-8516) The thermal cycling protocol used was the same as the one described above except that the annealing temperature was 62°C. PCR experiments were performed using a Perkin-Elmer apparatus. RACE-PCR products were separated by electrophoresis. Parts of the gel containing bands of interest were excised and the DNA was purified using Glassmilk (BIO 101, Inc.) and cloned into pGEMT vector (Promega). PCR products were purified using Preps DNA purification resin (Promega) and cloned into pMOSblue vector (Amersham). The fragments of interest from phage or cosmid clones were subcloned into the pBluescript KS(+) vector from Stratagene. We used the Wizard™ minipreps DNA purification system (Promega). The clones were sequenced on both strands by the dideoxy chain termination method using α-35S-dATP with Sequenase version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), Sequitherm (TEBU), or the T7Sequencing™ kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). They were sequenced using synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to the T7 and T3 primers of the pKS plasmid, to the T7 and −40 primers of the pGEMT or pMOSblue vector. Part of the sequence was determined by primer walking using primers specific to the MUC5B gene. Analyses of nucleic acid and protein sequence data were performed using PC/GENE Software. To perform DNA sequencing directly on cosmids (2 μg), we had to anneal at 37°C for 30 min and to use 5 pmol of primers instead of 0.5 pmol when sequencing DNA in plasmids using the Sequenase version 2.0. The nucleotide sequence reported in this paper has been submitted to the EMBL Data Bank with accession number Z72496. Human genomic DNA from leukocytes of 20 healthy unrelated volunteers was digested with BamHI, BglII, EcoRI, HindIII, KpnI, PstI, XbaI, and XhoI. The sizes of the fragments obtained and hybridized with the JER57 probe are indicated in Table I. These results indicated the fragments of interest recognized with the JER57 probe. We isolated all these fragments from a phage or a cosmid genomic library and sequenced them to obtain the complete sequence recognized with the JER57 probe (see below).Table ISizes (kb) of the DNA fragments obtained with various restriction enzymes and hybridizing with the JER57 probeBam HIBgl IIEco RIHind IIIKpn IPst IXba IXho I1.618>302581.4>30251.12.21.253.70.42.10.951.61.60.65 Open table in a new tab The EMBL4 human genomic library has been screened with the JER57 probe, and one positive clone with an insert of approximately 12 kb called CEL5 was obtained. The JER57 probe hybridized with one BamHI-BamHI fragment of 1.1 kb (indicated in Fig. 1, Fig. 2A) situated in the 5′ part of this clone. This fragment was completely sequenced. Other screenings of the EMBL4 genomic library only gave the same clone. This led us to screen a human placenta genomic DNA library in cosmid vector pWE15 using JER57 as probe. Two cosmid clones containing inserts of approximately 40 kb were obtained and called BEN1 and BEN2. The partial restriction map of the three clones (CEL5, BEN1, and BEN2) is indicated in Fig. 1. BEN1 contains a CpG island, since restriction sites such as BssHII and NotI are close together (30Brown W.R.A. Bird A.P. Nature. 1986; 322: 477-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 31Bickmore W.A. Bird A.P. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 216: 224-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This island is located at 24 kb from the 5′-end of the insert and corresponds to the I 8 CpG island on the macrocartography performed in the 11p15.5 region (32Guyonnet-Dupérat, V. Study of the Human Mucin Genes Located in 11p15. Ph.D. thesis, University of Lille, France. 1993; Google Scholar). BEN2 overlaps the 3′ region of BEN1 on 16 kb and overlaps completely the CEL5 clone. We have found on these clones all the restriction fragments corresponding to the fragments recognized with the JER57 probe and observed on Southern blots of genomic DNA (Fig. 1 and Table I).Fig. 2Sequencing strategy, BamHI restriction map, and schematic protein subdomains diagram of the open reading frame.

We distinguished the fragments obtained from BEN2 only (with an asterisk). One fragment BamHI-BamHI of 1.1 kb was obtained from BEN2 and from CEL5 (noted with an asterisk and ++++). Since some fragments had the same lengths but were at various positions, we had to carefully isolate them starting from larger fragments unambiguously positioned, obtained for example only from BEN2, or for others only from BEN1. Due to an extremely high proportion of GC residues, many sequence problems were encountered. Subclones were thus sequenced several times before a reliable sequence was obtained. To obtain cDNAs upstream of the central tandem repeat region we used 5′ RACE-PCR with the primers NAU58 and NAU57 chosen in a nonrepeat region in 5′ of the central region. The amplification products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Four ethidium bromide-stained bands ranging from 0.4 to 1 kb were obtained (data not shown) and cloned into pGEMT vector. Several transformants were isolated and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence showed that the 3′-ends of all the clones sequenced overlap with the genomic sequence. The comparison of the sequence of the longest cDNA (985 bp) with the sequence of the fragment BamHI-KpnI of 1.35 kb (noted with a vertical arrow on the left in Fig. 2A) from the cosmid BEN1 indicates an intron of 468 bp (nucleotide sequence not shown), thus identifying the 5′-end of the central exon. Splice acceptor and donor sequences agree with the “GT-AG” rule (33Jacob M. Gallinaro H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2159-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To determine the 3′-end of the central exon we performed RT-PCR using two primers (NAU128 and NAU71, their positions are shown on Fig. 2A) on human RNAs from tracheobronchial tissue and from gall bladder. Then we compared the sequences obtained after subcloning into pMOSblue vector with those determined on fragments of the cosmid located 3′ of the central exon: fragment BamHI-SacII ∼ 1.7 kb and PstI-SacII ∼ 1.3 kb (noted with vertical arrows on the right in Fig. 2A). The presence of an intron at 27 bp downstream from the site PstI evidenced by comparing the sequences of the two cDNAs obtained with the genomic sequence. Splice acceptor and donor sequences agree with the GT-AG rule (33Jacob M. Gallinaro H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2159-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In order to confirm that the sequence was in the correct order, we performed restriction maps of overlapping fragments such as the 8-kb KpnI-KpnI fragment from BEN2 or the 5.5-kb HindIII-NotI 3′-end fragment from BEN1 (Fig. 1). To confirm that this sequence forms only one exon, additional PCR products were produced using various pairs of primers (see Fig. 2A). We compared the lengths and the sequences of the fragments obtained first by RT-PCR on gall bladder or tracheobronchial RNA and by PCR on genomic DNA (cosmids BEN1 or BEN2). Using NAU81 and NAU112 we obtained fragments of ∼2500 bp, using NAU113 and NAU112 fragments of ∼1400 bp, using NAU82 and NAU136 fragments of ∼2100 bp. In each case, we obtained the same lengths and the same sequences with either cDNAs or genomic DNA as matrices. No intron was detected in this way. Thus the sequenced region consists of a single long open reading frame which extends over 10,713 bp (submitted to the EMBL Data Bank with accession number Z72496) coding for 3570 amino acid residues and leading to a polypeptide core with a calculated Mr of 370,000. The nucleotide sequences of the previously isolated cDNAs JUL10, JER28, and JUL7 (23Dufossé J. Porchet N. Audié J.P. Guyonnet-Dupérat V. Laine A. VanSeuningen I. Marrakchi S. Degand P. Aubert J.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) have been positioned within the central exon. JUL10 is at position 5272-6258. JUL7 overlaps JER28. They are respectively positioned at 8510-10143 and at 9172-9732. Some small differences in sequence were observed between the genomic sequence determined here and these cDNAs as determined previously by us (23Dufossé J. Porchet N. Audié J.P. Guyonnet-Dupérat V. Laine A. VanSeuningen I. Marrakchi S. Degand P. Aubert J.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). As we did not succeed to position the JER57 sequence as reported by us (23Dufossé J. Porchet N. Audié J.P. Guyonnet-Dupérat V. Laine A. VanSeuningen I. Marrakchi S. Degand P. Aubert J.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), we redetermined its nucleotide sequence (accession number X74955 with correction submitted to the EMBL Data Bank). The reason for this discrepancy between this newly determined sequence of JER57, which is at position 8361-10222, and our previous work is explained under “Discussion.” These cDNAs were obtained by screening a human tracheobronchial tissue cDNA expression library using antibodies (23Dufossé J. Porchet N. Audié J.P. Guyonnet-Dupérat V. Laine A. VanSeuningen I. Marrakchi S. Degand P. Aubert J.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Their deduced amino acid sequences allowed us to choose the appropriate open reading frame of the central exon continuous with that of their sequences. Nineteen subdomains are individualized and are indicated in Fig. 2B Seven code for cysteine-rich subdomains called Cys1 (aa 6-112), Cys2 (aa 176-283), Cys3 (aa 457-565), Cys4 (aa 986-1093), Cys5 (aa 1515-1622), Cys6 (aa 2213-2320), and Cys7 (aa 2742-2849). Their amino acid sequences are displayed in Fig. 3. Their average amino acid composition is given in Table II (column Cys). These subdomains are rich in cysteine residues (9.3%). In Fig. 3 is also shown the similarity between these cysteine-rich subdomains and homologous domains found in other mucins such as human MUC5AC or related cDNAs (3Meerzaman D. Charles P. Daskal E.

INTRODUCTIONIn 1958, Koshland (1Koshland Jr., D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1958; 44: 98-104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) proposed the “induced fit” model of enzyme action in which conformational changes induced by substrate binding could orient functional groups on an enzyme so as to enhance the efficiency of the subsequent chemical process. Since then, the number of examples where ligand binding and solvation alter three-dimensional structures seems to increase proportionally with the information available from structure biology. Conformational flexibility of enzymes required for this effect is well recognized (2Kraut J. Science. 1988; 242: 533-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 3Jonson K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 4Bone R. Sile J.L. Aghard D.A. Nature. 1989; 339: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Recent evidence from folding and unfolding of enzymes indicated that loss of enzyme activity can precede marked changes in protein conformation. Tsou (5Tsou C.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 111: 427-429Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 6Tsou C.L. Science. 1993; 262: 380-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that enzyme active sites may be conformationally more flexible than the intact enzymes.On the other hand, the result that ribonuclease can be denatured reversibly leads to the contemporary view that protein conformation is determined by the amino acid sequence (7Anfinsen C.B. Science. 1973; 181: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (5079) Google Scholar). Therefore, methodologies allowing comparison of amino acid sequences to investigate enzyme structure and function have been developed (8Sali A. Shakhnovich E.I. Karplus M. Nature. 1994; 369: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar, 9Crippen G.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4232-4237Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 10Sippl M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 859-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar, 11Monge A. Friesner R.A. Honig B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5027-5029Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The information obtained by comparative analysis of the known protein structures is of potential value in understanding their architecture and the principles that govern the polypeptide chain folding. Structural comparisons of unrelated proteins are most important since structural similarities between proteins suggest that some basic principles, rather than the evolutionary divergence or functional convergence of proteins, are the basis of the similarity. Many significant insights into enzyme structure and function have been provided from the methodologies above. However, the properties of enzyme active site structures have not been investigated in detail. Functional properties, for example binding to ligands and catalysis, require precise distributions of appropriate groups. Therefore assessing these properties may allow an understanding of the formation of enzyme active sites and may provide guidance for protein design.The Gly residue is unique among the amino acids in that all side chains are hydrogen atoms. Its conformation has greater freedom so that it can provide flexibility for adjacent residues. Because of this, it is not surprising that Gly plays a special role in enzyme structure and function. In this paper, we present a method to investigate the properties of enzyme active sites by comparing amino acid sequence. This analysis suggests that Gly residues may provide flexibility for enzyme active sites.MATERIALS AND METHODSX-ray crystallographic data for various proteins were used in the analysis as indicated in the tables. Only non-homologous structures were used in the study. The amino acid sequences of the enzymes were divided into several parts according to the number of essential amino acids involved in the enzyme active sites. The number of amino acid residues investigated for each enzyme was less than 30% of the total amino acids of the enzyme except copper-zinc superoxide dismutase, for which 73 of 151 residues were examined. The hydrophobicity of amino acid residues in proteins was estimated according to the method of Rose et al. (12Rose G.D. Geselowitz A.R. Lesser G.J. Lee R.H. Zehfus M.H. Science. 1985; 229: 834-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). Hydrophobic residues include Cys, Val, Ile, Leu, Met, Phe, and Trp; amphipathic residues include Ala, His, Thr, and Tyr; hydrophilic residues include Ser, Pro, Asp, Asn, Glu, Gln, Lys, and Arg. Specifically, continuous 3-residue segments containing Gly (G-X-Y and Y-X-G) in active site regions were extracted to investigate their properties. Both Y-X-G and G-X-Y oligopeptides are designated G-X-Y oligopeptides under “Results and Discussion.”RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIn the majority of enzymes, the residues involved in binding and catalysis come close together in the tertiary structure to form the enzyme active site “pocket” (Fig. 1) but are dispersed along the amino acid sequence. Binding and catalysis take place within the pocket (some workers term it as tunnel or cleft). In the case of cellobiohydrolase I from Trichoderma reesei, small angle x-ray scattering techniques indicate a maximum length of 18 nm and a largest diameter of 4.4 nm (13Schumuck M. Pilz I. Biotechnol. Lett. 1986; 8: 397-402Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The crystal structure for the catalytic core of the enzyme showed that it consists of a large single domain with dimensions of approximately 6 × 5 × 4 nm and contains a 4-nm-long active site tunnel (14Divne C. Stahlberg J. Reinikainen T. Rouhonen L. Pettersson G. Knowles J.K.C. Teeri T. Jones T.A. Science. 1994; 265: 524-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). On the other hand, enzymes are usually built from domains. When ligands are present in the pocket this is designated as the “closed form” of the enzyme molecule. Without bound ligands, the domains are farther apart and the pocket is accessible. This is the “open form.” The solvent-accessible area is increased in the open form compared with the closed form. The main function of the open form is to allow access to the active site. The major force driving the closing of domains is probably the exclusion of water from the binding site, maximizing interdomain salt links and electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. Domain motion is critical for a variety of the enzyme activities. In this work, first we evaluate the intrinsic flexibility of enzyme active sites, and then discuss the constraints of packing and the limited flexibility of the main amino acid chain of enzymes.Table I summarizes the amount and location of G-X-Y oligopeptides in the active site regions of the 23 enzymes examined (15Tao W.S.

Fig. 2 shows the frequency of the X, Y residues occurring in the G-X-Y oligopeptides. In general, the X and Y residues in the G-X-Y oligopeptides of these enzymes possess the following properties: 1) X and Y are often polar and non-polar residues, respectively; 2) X and Y are usually small in size and polarity; and 3) the frequency of such G-X-Y oligopeptides is significantly higher in active site regions than in other parts of the enzyme molecule.Table IThe amounts and location of the G-X-Y oligopeptides in enzymesEnzymesNo. of amino acidsTotalLocation%177 2401.GDH3212352TLGIYGFGSIGQALAKRAQGFDMDIDYFD—PQGAIRGDL—EAGRLAYAGFDVFAG-269 287EPNINEGYYDLPNTFLFPHIGSA176179 231GPDH3332931VEGLMTTVHAVTATQKTVDGPSAKDWRGGRGAA—STGAAKAVGKVIPELDGKLTGMAFR—4446 61 69 78 81Cu, Zn-SOD1512361VTGSITGLTEGDHGFHVHEFGDNTNG—SAGPH—HGGPKDEERHVGDLGNVTADKNGVA—118IIGRTMVVHEKPDDLGRGGNE58 63 66 114Glutathione reductase4783850ELGARAAVVESHKLGGTCVNVGCVPK—YENNLTKSHIEIIRGHA—IPGASLGITSDGFFN-197 201 291LEELPGRSVIVGAGYIANEMAGILSALGSK—AIGRVPNTKDLSLNKLGINTDDLGHI—331 467 472VKGIYAVGDVCGKALLTPVAIAAGRK—GATKADFDNTVAIHPTSSE72 1622.PFK3194050EVGDVGDIIHRGGTILYTARCPEFKTEEGOKKGIE—RTYVIEVMGRHAGDIALWSGLAGGA-222 243 252E—GHERGKKHSIIIVAEGVGSGVDFGRQIQEATGFETRVTVLGHVQRGGS2729 3233 5153 139CGTase6845334DGNPSNNPTGAA—GGDWQGLI—AKGIKTVIDFAPNHTSPAMETDTSFAENGRLYDNGTLV-190 199 229 233GGYTNDTNGYFHHNGGSDFSSLENGIYKNLYDLADD—DMGVDGIRVDAVKHMPLGWQ—257 328TFGEWFLGSA—D—13 123 156 167Adenylate kinase2142045LLGAPGAKAQFIMEGTQKYGIP—IVGRRVHAPSGRV—VEGKDDVTGEELTTR—RLVEY-HQMTAPLIGYY69 72 145 1963.Carboxypeptidase A3072167DLGIHSPEWITNATGVY—GVDANRNWDAGFGAGAS—GNFKAFLSIHSYSNLLLYPYG—248 270GSIITTIYNSAGGSI—GIKYSFTFGLRDTGRYGEL12 119RNase A124333——H——CEGDPYVPVH—35 52 62 63 108Lysozyme1291164GLYSLGNYVCAAKFE—GSTDYGILN—WWCDNGRTPGSR—GMNAW—25 106 158Papain2122638NAGSCGSC—GGIFVGPCGNKVDHAVAAVGYNPGYT—SWGPGYDCGYS—16 57 102 194195 214Chymotrypsin A2452138GLSRIVNGEE—HCGVT—D—GVSSCMGDSGGP—GIVSWGSS—175 221 272 364367CBH II4472741DCAALASNGEYSIADGGVA—DSLANLVTNLGTP—PAGHAGWLGW—PTGNNNWGDWCNV-IGTGFGIR—12 18 129PTPase157650CLGNICR—GSYDPQKQLIIEDPYYG179 204α-Amylase4034035DIGFDGWRFDFAKGYS—EIWTSLAYGGDGKP—TKGILNVAVEGELWRLRGTDGKAPGMIG-276277 289WWPAKAVTFVDNHDTGSTQHMWPFPSDRVMOGYAILTHPGTP9293 96 102 149Astacin2001443ANGCVYHGTIIHELLMHAIGPYH—YVGEDYQYYSIMHYGKYSPSIQWGVL70 73 130Lactamase2911553KSGKEVKFNSDKRFAYASTSK—YVGKDITLKALIEASMTYSDNTANNKIIKEIGGIKKVKQR-166 234 236LKELGDKVTNPVRYE—KSGDTLIKDGVPKPKDYKVADKSGQA124125128 175 223226 260262 289Dehalogenase3101553DWGGFLGLT—ADGFTAW—NAGVRKFPKMV—AIGMKDKLLGPD—DAGHFNEFGEN-60 6566 1234.Rubisco4764156QPGVPPEEAGAAVAAESSTGTWTTVWTDGLT—EEGSVTNMFTSIVGNVFGFK—KYGRPL-175177 334 381LGCTIKPKLGLSAKNYGRA—LSGGDHIHSGTVVGKLERDITLGFV—TPGVLPVASGGI-403404H—IFGDDSVLQFGGGTLGHPWGNAPGAV%238 274Citrate synthase4373456HEGGNVSAHTSHLVGSA—MNGLAGPLHGLANEVLGWL—AGADASLRDYIWNTLNSGRVVP-320 329 375GYGHAVLRKTDPRYTVNREFALKHLPGDP—ENGAAANPWPNVDAHSGVLLNYYGMT—401 421LFGVSRALGVL—ALGFPLERPKSMSTDGLI13 95 1655.Phosphate isomerase2482335FVGGNWKMNG—DIGAAWVILGHSERRHVFG—EPVWAIGTGKT—158 195 201 204 2106.Glutathione synthetase3162250ILKPLDGMGGAS—GVLAETLTEHGTRYCMAQNYLPAIKDGDKVLVVDGEP—QIGPTLKEK-275 289GLIFVGLDIGDRLTEINVTSPTCIREIEAEFPVSITGML47 269 397Glutamine synthetase4683132EEGKMFDGSSIGGWKGIN—MFGDNGSGMHCHMSLSKNGVN—HPGEAMDKNLYDLPPEIPN-VAG Open table in a new tab Fig. 2Frequency of amino acid residues observed in x, y position in the G-X-Y or Y-X-G oligopeptides.

Data were from non-homogenous structures determined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These observations suggest that such G-X-Y oligopeptides cannot interact strongly with other parts of the enzymes that contain bulky and large charged or hydrophobic residues. In other words, Gly residues provide more flexibility for enzyme active sites than for other regions. In the active site regions, the most probable amino acids in either X or Y position in the G-X-Y oligopeptides include Val, Leu, Ile, Ala, Ser, Thr, and Asp (frequency, >6%) (Fig. 2). By contrast, Cys is rare in such G-X-Y oligopeptides. The reason for this is not clear; the frequency of His, Gln, Met, and Trp is also low (frequency, <2%). It is worthy to note that the overall frequency of Pro in G-X-Y oligopeptides is moderate (4.2% for the X position and 5.8% for the Y position, respectively). With the increasing size of the protein sequence database, it is becoming apparent that Pro residues are found at a much higher frequency than average in many proteins. MacArthur and Thorton (38MacArthur M.W. Thorton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar) indicated that the overall frequency of Gly residues in X-Pro pairs of proteins was 8.8%, and that Pro influenced the conformation of both the preceding and following residues when the X-Pro and Pro-X pairs are in the β-conformation. Gly appears to be restricted in its conformational freedom when followed by a Pro residue. Thus the unit Gly-Pro nearly always adopts the extended conformation. In the active site regions, the relative low frequency of Pro in G-X-Y oligopeptides may be favored to reduce the influence of the rigid dihedral conformation. In addition, enzyme active sites were not always observed in the helix structure. This may be because the G-X-Y oligopeptide often makes a bend or coil structure.In principle, both X and Y residues with strong polarity would result in a 41% exposure of the G-X-Y oligopeptide to the protein surface, and large bulky hydrophobic residues in the X and Y position would lead to the G-X-Y that might be buried within enzyme molecules (12Rose G.D. Geselowitz A.R. Lesser G.J. Lee R.H. Zehfus M.H. Science. 1985; 229: 834-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). This rule is generally obeyed by enzyme active site structures (Fig. 2). The exceptions are in phosphofructokinase, where two GKKs were found, and in glutathione reductase, D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, α-amylase, and glutamine synthetase, where one GRK, one GRW, one GWR and one GWK were found, respectively. However, these oligopeptides are not associated with the active sites directly, and their functional role is not well understood.It should be noted that in some enzymes of the oligopeptides containing Gly residues, the percentage of the G-X-Y oligopeptides is low (<25%), especially in large enzymes such as DNA topoisomerase I (864 residues), ribonucleotide reductase protein R1 (1522 residues), prostaglandin H2 synthase-1 (576 residues), myeloperoxidase (578 residues), and bile salt-activated lipase (722 residues). One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the oligopeptides containing Gly residue in non-active site regions often have strongly polar residues and large basic residues; in the meantime, because proteins are folded, enzyme active sites are not sequentially contiguous, and they may be far apart along the sequence and brought into physical proximity by the fold of the enzyme. As a result, such G-X-Y oligopeptides would be likely to interact strongly with some other portion of the enzyme or play a structural role. The enzyme conformation requires a coil or bend structure, and turn or coil propensity is expected with Gly. In the case of lysozyme, oligopeptide segments containing Gly residues (4-6, 13-16, 114-117, and 125-128) that were outside of the active site regions are Gly-Arg-Cys, Lys-Arg-His-Gly, Arg-Cys-Cys-Gly, and Arg-Gly-Cys-Arg, respectively. The properties of these oligopeptides are obviously different from the G-X-Y oligopeptides we discuss here.To further investigate the properties of the G-X-Y oligopeptides in enzymes, the main chain conformation of residues in the G-X-Y oligopeptides of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase was studied in more detail. The secondary structure and dihedral angles of each residue are shown in Table II. The most striking feature here is the β and loop structures adopted by the G-X-Y oligopeptides. On the other hand, 9 of 14 Gly residues in the G-X-Y oligopeptides have conformations outside the energetically favorable regions. Three non-glycine residues in the G-X-Y oligopeptides that fall outside the normally allowed regions are Asn-90, Leu-124, and Asn-129, respectively. These unusual dihedral angles suggest that they have steric strained backbones as demonstrated by Herzberg and Moult (39Herzberg O. Moult J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), who examined 24 high resolution refined proteins and indicated that 10 of the 24 proteins have a strained backbone. A residue with a strained backbone is rare in proteins, and where it does occur, it is always in regions of the structures intimately involved in function. In the present work, residues with strained backbones were also found in some enzymes as shown in Table III. Gly residue has little influence on the conformation of a residue preceding or following it, thus a strained backbone in active site regions may be understood in terms of more stringent structural requirements for enzyme function.Table IIThe conformations of residues involved in the active site regions of copper-zinc superoxide dismutaseNo.ResidueφψStructureNo.ResidueφψStructure29V−112123β78H−89125Loop30T−133165β79V−40−38Loop31G148−179β80G−73−3Loop32S−125152β81D−113146Loop33I−140135β82L−1358β34T−137159β83G79−130β35G8139β84N−123136β36L−102161β85V−92151β37T−103112β86T−114152β38E−99147β87A−137140β39G124−170β88D−139−175β40D−85141β89K−8695β41H−137150β90N−122−97β42G−47128β91G−14978β43F−143101β92V−120134β44H−142159β93A−126108β45V−111129β46H−99147β110I−1191Loop47Q−49−56Loop111I−71113Loop48F−105155Loop112G1093Loop49G−9426Loop113R−107166β50D−83109Loop114T−105132β51N−10120Loop115M−85131β116V−137142β57S−791Loop117V−115105β58A−75−34Loop118H−79176β59G70−163Loop119E−81−25Loop60H−57136Loop120K−132162Loop121P−61140Loop69H−87132Loop122D−76−149Loop70G−145−158Loop123D−75−22Loop71G−98173Loop124L−4011Loop72P−50−37Loop125G117−13Loop73K−78−30Loop126R−78−28Loop74D−79155Loop127G−11491Loop75E−75−31Loop128G122−73Loop76E−9389Loop129N−140−142Loop77R−155155Loop130E−90−35Loop Open table in a new tab Table IIIResidues with the strained backbone in enzyme active site regionsEnzymeResidueφψLocation1.Copper-zincAsn-90−122−97In the G-X-YsuperoxideLeu-124−40−11In the G-X-YdismutaseAsn-129−140−142In the G-X-Y2.GlutathioneHis-52−123−118Not in the G-X-YreductaseHis-219−119−146Not in the G-X-Y3.CGTaseAla-15244−127Not in the G-X-YTyr-195−62−114Not in the G-X-Y4.α-AmylaseAsp-214−170−20In the G-X-YSer-292−50−120In the G-X-Y5.AstacinSer-72−82−143In the G-X-Y6.DehalogenaseAsp-124−49−135At active site7.LactamaseAla-69−42−140Not in the G-X-YLeu-220−108−125Not in the G-X-Y8.CarboxylSer-199−1500Not in the G-X-Ypeptidase AIle-247−103−89Not in the G-X-YAsp-273−99−150In the G-X-Y9.Citrate synthaseHis-274−124−127At active site10.GlutathioneSer-155−76−58Not in the G-X-YsynthetaseCys-289−86−6At active site Open table in a new tab Gerstein et al. (40Gerstein M. Lesk A.M. Chothia C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6739-6749Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar) classified the structural mechanisms for domain movements of proteins into “shear motion” and “hinge motion.” One of the main features for domain closure is that the main chain packing for shear motion is constrained by close packing, while for hinge motion it is free to kink. Citrate synthase is one of the clearest examples of a domain closure occurring through shear motions in which a steric-strained backbone was found (Table II). However, there is also evidence that adenylate kinase and lysozyme possess hinge motions, but no strained backbone was found in two enzymes (26Muller C.W. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 159-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 39Herzberg O. Moult J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Indeed, many enzymes have domain linkages. The advantage of a single linkage is a wide degree of flexibility, allowing the two domains considerable conformational freedom. However, for many large proteins, too much flexibility may be a considerable disadvantage. The addition of a second or third connecting segment could reduce the flexibility and restrict the possible modes of domain movements. This situation is often found in some enzymes with hinge motions (40Gerstein M. Lesk A.M. Chothia C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6739-6749Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Therefore the observations above may suggest that the shear motions controlling domain movements in enzymes may be due to a sterically strained backbone. More detailed studies of the relationships in these examples would be informative.The analysis suggests that with more evaluation, prediction of some regions that contain the enzyme active sites may be possible. For an enzyme of unknown structure when the amino acid sequence is obtained, the regions rich in the G-X-Y oligopeptides might contain the active sites of the enzyme. By contrast, amino acid residues, which were not located in the regions, are unlikely to be involved in enzyme active sites. It may be useful for predicting the active sites of some glycosyl hydrolytic enzymes such as cellulase, which was determined to possess the same mechanism of lysozyme. For endoglucanase A (41Wong W.K.R. Gerhard B. Guo Z.M. Kilburn D.G. Warren R.A.J. Miller Jr., R.C. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 44: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) from Cellulomonas fimi, Glu-90, Asp-93, Asp-126, Trp-233, Glu-250, Asp-252, Trp-293, Asp-297, Glu-309, and Trp-384 had been found to be in the G-X-Y oligopeptide-rich regions. Therefore some of them may be involved in the enzyme active sites. An obvious limitation of the method for many enzymes is that we can locate only the enzyme active site regions rather than the particular amino acids involved in the active sites. However, our analysis indicated that the high frequency of occurrence of the G-X-Y oligopeptides in enzyme active site regions may be of some relevance to enzyme function. Collectively, the present analysis demonstrated that enzyme active sites are formed by relatively weak molecular interactions. The G-X-Y oligopeptides we defined here may be a structural motif for the formation of enzyme active sites. The evidence available from crystal analysis of some proteins suggests that the open and closed forms are only slightly different in energy and at room temperature are in dynamic equilibrium (42Sharff A.T. Rodseth L.E. Spurlino J.C. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10657-10663Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 43Baker E.N. Rumball S.V. Anderson B.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 350-355Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Therefore domain closure must be fast, and the transition between open and closed forms cannot involve a high energy barrier. Indeed, rapid diffusion in and out by the substrate and product requires a more open binding site. In catalysis, domain closure often excludes water from the active site, helps position catalytic groups around the substrate, and also traps substrates and prevents the escape of reaction intermediates. Therefore, efficient catalysis and substrate recognition and alignment may be expected to require flexible enzyme active sites with local strain.Our findings give a new clue to the design of functional proteins, especially in the design of enzyme de novo Although several designed peptides and proteins have been reported to have substantial enzymatic activity (44DeGrado W.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 365: 488-490Google Scholar, 45Johnsson K. Allemann R.K. Wildmer H. Benner S.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 365: 530Google Scholar), the structural basis for this activity has been established for only one peptide. Protein design requires consideration of various aspects involved in protein folding and stability. A rational strategy for the design of enzymes should be based on the recognition that the formation of enzyme active site structures needs only one or, at most, a few structural motifs. If this reasoning is accepted, it may provide an intuitive basis for expected motifs. The fact that structural motifs recur in many proteins even though the sequences vary widely led us to hypothesize that proteins are assembled by the combination of individual folding motifs and that these motifs represent specific functional modules of the protein. Consequently, the construction of such enzyme active site motifs for the G-X-Y oligopeptides is an attractive strategy for the design of enzymes. On the one hand, the strategy should be based on geometric considerations to ensure the formation of the active site pocket, with additional checks to avoid unfavorable steric interactions. On the other hand, a rational strategy for enzyme design must reflect the hierarchy of forces required for stabilizing tertiary structure, beginning with hydrophobic forces and adding more specific interactions as required to achieve a unique functional enzyme. Recently, some proteins with defined conformational properties have been designed (46Hecht M.H. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Ogden R.C. Science. 1990; 249: 884-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 47Ho S.P. DeGrado W.F J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 6751-6758Crossref Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 48Ghadiri M.R. Granja J.R.

Struct. 1995; 24: 31-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), indicating that the design of proteins is indeed a feasible enterprise; similar progress on the design of enzymes will certainly follow. The ultimate goal in protein design is to elucidate the fundamental principles that determine structure. With increased understanding of the molecular basis underlying the sequence-structure relationship may come the ability to control it and generate proteins with desired specifications. Efforts toward such exquisite designs will undoubtedly foster our understanding of how enzymes work at a molecular level. INTRODUCTIONIn 1958, Koshland (1Koshland Jr., D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1958; 44: 98-104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) proposed the “induced fit” model of enzyme action in which conformational changes induced by substrate binding could orient functional groups on an enzyme so as to enhance the efficiency of the subsequent chemical process.

This decreased expression is due to circulating factors distinct from insulin or glucose. Here we evaluated the effect of palmitic acid and the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone on GLUT2 expression by in vitro cultured rat pancreatic islets. Palmitic acid induced a 40% decrease in GLUT2 mRNA levels with, however, no consistent effect on protein expression. Dexamethasone, in contrast, had no effect on GLUT2 mRNA, but decreased GLUT2 protein by about 65%. The effect of dexamethasone was more pronounced at high glucose concentrations and was inhibited by the glucocorticoid antagonist RU-486. Biosynthetic labeling experiments revealed that GLUT2 translation rate was only minimally affected by dexamethasone, but that its half-life was decreased by 50%, indicating that glucocorticoids activated a posttranslational degradation mechanism. This degradation mechanism was not affecting all membrane proteins, since the α subunit of the Na+/K+-ATPase was unaffected. Glucose-induced insulin secretion was strongly decreased by treatment with palmitic acid and/or dexamethasone. The insulin content was decreased (∼55 percent) in the presence of palmitic acid, but increased (∼180%) in the presence of dexamethasone. We conclude that a combination of elevated fatty acids and glucocorticoids can induce two common features observed in diabetic β cells, decreased GLUT2 expression, and loss of glucose-induced insulin secretion.

For example, the effective dose required to reach 50% saturation (ED50) of the estrogen receptor by its ligand is several orders of magnitude greater than the ED50 for maximal transcriptional activity (19Reese J.C. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9868-9873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A possible explanation for this is that ligand-activated estrogen receptor acts in a cooperative manner with unoccupied estrogen receptor molecules during interaction with its DNA response element or with the transcriptional apparatus, whereas other steroid hormone receptors do not. Another exception is the progesterone antagonist RU486; this synthetic ligand binds tightly to the progesterone receptor, but does not induce transcriptional activity (20Meyer M.E. Pornon A. Ji J.

Recently, we began to analyze the mechanism of action of analogues of α,25-(OH)2D3 that regulate receptor-mediated transcription more effectively than the natural hormone, although their affinity for VDR is not greater (6Peleg S.

For example, a concentration of 10−11M is required to induce 50% of maximal DNA binding and transcriptional activities of VDR by the 20-epi analogue MC 1288 (1-E; see Fig. 1), but this concentration of 1-E is 200-fold lower than the ED50 of 2 × 10−9M for saturation of VDR binding sites in equilibrium (6Peleg S.

These results suggest that enhanced activation of VDR occurs after binding of the analogue to VDR, but before induction of transcription. Because analogue 1-E induces a unique conformational change in VDR in vitro and enhances dimerization of VDR with RXR in vivo (6Peleg S. Sastry M. Collins E.D. Bishop J.E. Norman A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10551-10558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), we speculated that the conformation of 20-epi analogue-activated VDR promotes better binding to DNA by stabilizing the VDR heterodimer. The conformational differences between α,25-(OH)2D3·VDR and 20-epi analogue·VDR complexes are probably due to differences in the sites where ligands contact the receptor, as are the differences in the interaction of progesterone and RU486 with the progesterone receptor (21Vegeto E. Allan G.F. Schrader W.T. Tsai M.-J. McDonnell D.P. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 1992; 69: 703-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, it is necessary to map the ligand-binding domain of VDR, to identify the amino acids that are required for the binding of α,25-(OH)2D3 to it, and to determine whether the same amino acids are also required for binding of the 20-epi analogues (E-analogues). In the study presented here, we identified the amino acids required for interaction of α,25-(OH)2D3 at the C-terminal region of VDR. We also showed that the same amino acids were required for binding of α,25-(OH)2D3 and analogues with a natural orientation of the side chain (N-analogues). However, all of the E-analogues examined had different binding requirements at this region, and these differences in binding requirements were associated with increased stability of the ligand-receptor complexes. Synthetic oligonucleotides were prepared by the Macromolecular Synthesis and Analysis Facility of the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. [35S]Methionine and α,25-(OH)2[26,27-3H]D3 were obtained from Amersham Corp. A coupled transcription/translation kit and a site-directed mutagenesis kit were obtained from Promega. The analogues used in this study were a generous gift from Dr. L. Binderup (Leo Pharmaceuticals, Ballerup, Denmark). The structural formulas for and abbreviations of these ligands are shown in Fig. 1. Single-stranded DNA templates were prepared from Escherichia coli JM109 cells bearing the plasmid pAlter (Altered Sites in vitro mutagenesis system, Promega) with an insert encoding the wild-type human VDR cDNA, a tetracycline resistance gene, and a mutated ampicillin resistance gene. A VDR primer with the desired mutation and an oligonucleotide containing repair sequences for the mutation in the ampicillin resistance gene were annealed to the single-stranded DNA, and then synthesis of complementary strand was catalyzed by T4 DNA polymerase. Synthetic plasmids were transformed into E. coli strain BMH71-18 (mutS) and isolated from ampicillin-resistant colonies. Plasmid DNA was transformed into JM109 for a second screening, and then DNA was isolated from individual colonies and screened for mutations by DNA sequencing through the mutated site. Subsequently, the DNA coding for a mutant VDR was subcloned into the plasmid pGEM-4 for in vitro studies with synthetic receptor or into a eukaryotic expression vector for functional studies in intact cells. Rat osteosarcoma ROS 17/2.8 cells and monkey kidney CV-1 cells were plated in 35-mm dishes at a density of 3 × 105/dish. ROS 17/2.8 cells were transfected with 2 μg of plasmid ocVDRE containing the vitamin D-responsive element (VDRE) from the human osteocalcin gene (GGTGACTCACCGGGTGAACGGGGGCATT) (23Ozono K. Liao J. Kerner S.A. Scott R.A. Pike J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21881-21888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This response element was attached to the thymidine kinase promoter/growth hormone fusion gene. Monkey kidney CV-1 cells were transfected with the osteocalcin VDRE/reporter fusion gene (4 μg/dish) and the recombinant human VDR expression vector (2 μg/dish). Monkey kidney COS-1 cells were plated in 150-mm dishes at a density of 6 × 105/dish and transfected with recombinant human VDR plasmids (20 μg/dish). All transfections were performed by the DEAE-dextran method (6Peleg S. Sastry M. Collins E.D. Bishop J.E. Norman A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10551-10558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Medium samples for measurements of growth hormone were collected 2 days after transfection. Growth hormone production from the reporter gene was measured by a radioimmunoassay as described by the manufacturer (Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA). To assess the relative affinity of α,25-(OH)2D3 and the E-analogues for wild-type and mutant VDRs in vitro, whole-cell homogenates from COS-1 cells transfected with VDR expression plasmids were prepared in KTED buffer (0.3 M KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1.5 mM EDTA, and 1 mM dithiothreitol) as described previously (6Peleg S.

The homogenates were then aliquoted into tubes containing 0.2 pmol of α,25-(OH)2[3H]D3 and increasing concentrations of nonradioactive ligand. For Scatchard analysis of α,25-(OH)2D3 binding to wild-type and mutant VDRs, the homogenates were incubated with increasing concentrations of α,25-(OH)2[3H]D3 (0.05-5 nM). The mixtures were incubated on ice for 3-4 h, and then the free ligand was separated from bound by hydroxylapatite (24Wecksler W.R. Norman A.W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 67: 488-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The bound ligand was released from the hydroxylapatite by ethanol extraction, and the radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. For the competition assays, the results were plotted as the inverse value of percent maximal binding against competitor concentration by the method of Wecksler and Norman (24Wecksler W.R. Norman A.W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 67: 488-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To assess receptor occupancy by the ligand as well as the dissociation rate of the ligand in vivo, monolayers of VDR-transfected COS-1 cells were washed three times in PBS and incubated for 1 h with ligand in serum-free medium. Then the medium was discarded, the cells were washed three times in PBS, and fresh medium was added. At various times, the medium was discarded again, and the cells were washed three times in cold PBS, scraped into 10 ml of PBS, centrifuged, resuspended in KTED buffer, and homogenized. Aliquots (0.2 ml) of the homogenates were incubated on ice for 3-4 h with 0.2 pmol of α,25-(OH)2[3H]D3 with or without a 100-fold excess of unlabeled ligand. To assess the number of unoccupied VDR sites, the free ligand was separated from the bound by hydroxylapatite as described above. To assess exchange of unlabeled α,25-(OH)2D3 or its analogues with α,25-(OH)2[3H]D3, monolayers of VDR-transfected COS-1 cells were washed three times in PBS and incubated for 1 h with ligand in serum-free medium. Then the medium was discarded, and the cells were washed three times in cold PBS, scraped into 10 ml of PBS, centrifuged, resuspended in KTED buffer, and homogenized. Aliquots of the homogenates (0.2 ml) were incubated at 30°C with 0.2 pmol of α,25-(OH)2[3H]D3 for various times and then transferred to ice for an additional 3 h. The free radioactive ligand was separated from the bound by hydroxylapatite as described above. Exchange was assessed by comparing the amount of α,25-(OH)2[3H]D3 bound to unoccupied VDR and the amount of α,25-(OH)2[3H]D3 bound to in vivo bound VDR at each time point. Synthetic wild-type and mutant human VDRs labeled with [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol) were prepared by in vitro coupled transcription/translation in reticulocyte lysates (Promega) with the human VDR cDNA inserted into the pGEM-4 plasmid. The receptor preparations were incubated with the indicated concentrations of α,25-(OH)2D3 or analogues for 10 min at room temperature. Then 0-25 μg/ml trypsin (Calbiochem) was added, and the mixtures were incubated for another 10 min. The digestion products were analyzed by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the gels were dried and autoradiographed. A recent study from our laboratories showed that the E-analogue 1-E had a 200-fold greater transcriptional activity through a VDRE than did α,25-(OH)2D3 (6Peleg S. Sastry M. Collins E.D. Bishop J.E. Norman A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10551-10558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Another E-analogue with a modified chemistry of the side chain, 3-E, also had enhanced transcriptional activity. These results suggested that side chains with 20-epi configuration facilitated receptor action. To further study the role of the chemistry and stereochemistry of the side chain in VDR actions, we examined the transcriptional activity of three E-analogues and their N-analogue homologues (Table I). The transcriptional activity of these ligands was examined in ROS 17/2.8 cells transfected with a fusion gene containing the osteocalcin VDRE fused to the thymidine kinase promoter/growth hormone reporter gene. The cells were treated with the ligand for 1 h in serum-free medium to allow ligand uptake and saturation of cellular VDR ligand-binding sites in the absence of serum-binding proteins. The results of this assay (Table I) showed that extension of the α,25-(OH)2D3 side chain (as in 2-N) enhanced transcriptional activity by 50-fold, but the addition of oxygen at position 22 (as in 3-N) to this chemically modified side chain decreased transcriptional activity by 2-fold relative to 2-N. The 20-epi stereochemistry of each of these side chains further enhanced their transcriptional activities. The E-analogue 2-E had the greatest transcriptional activity, up to 5000-fold greater than that of α,25-(OH)2D3. Therefore, we concluded that the 20-epi configuration enhanced the transcriptional activity of these ligands whether or not their side chains were chemically modified.Table ITranscriptional activity of the N-analogues and their E-homologuesAnalogueTranscription (ED50)Mα,25-(OH)2D3(3.0 ± 1.2) × 10−91-E(10.0 ± 0.5) × 10−122-N(6.0 ± 0.6) × 10−112-E(6.0 ± 3.1) × 10−133-N(10.0 ± 0.5) × 10−113-E(2.0 ± 1.1) × 10−11 Open table in a new tab In our previous study (6Peleg S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 10551-10558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), we confirmed the earlier report (Binderup et al. (22Binderup L. Latini S. Binderup E. Bretting C. Calverley M. Hansen K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 1569-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar)) that the increased growth inhibitory and differentiating activities of the E-analogues were not associated with a greater affinity for VDR. However, another aspect of ligand binding was not tested in these studies: the stability of the ligand-receptor complexes in nonequilibrium. This is an important aspect of analogue action because, in our experiments, cellular VDR binding sites were first saturated with the ligand under equilibrium conditions, but then the ligand was removed. Therefore, we tested the transcriptional activity of the VDR·ligand complexes under nonequilibrium conditions. Similar conditions may develop naturally during prolonged incubation of cell cultures with the ligand or in vivo when the ligand is removed by catabolism. Therefore, we tested the possibility that the enhanced transcriptional activity of the analogues may in part be due to a change in their rate of dissociation from the VDR complexes. VDR-transfected COS-1 cells were incubated with 10−8M α,25-(OH)2D3 or its analogues for 1 h; the excess ligand was then removed; and the rate of appearance of unoccupied binding sites was measured over the next 3 h (Fig. 2A). We found that unoccupied binding sites appeared at a rapid rate when cellular VDR was first saturated with α,25-(OH)2D3 or with the N-analogues: in 3 h, only 35% of the VDR binding sites remained occupied with α,25-(OH)2D3, and 50% of the VDR binding sites remained occupied with the analogues 2-N and 3-N. We also concluded that the chemistry of these analogues' side chains did not have a significant effect on the stability of the ligand-receptor complexes. On the other hand, 20-epi configuration of these side chains significantly slowed down the replenishment of unoccupied binding sites. After 3 h of incubation, 80% of the VDR binding sites remained occupied by the E-analogues 1-E and 3-E, and all of the binding sites remained occupied by the most active 20-epi analogue, 2-E. Therefore, we conclude that ligands with a natural orientation of the side chain dissociate rapidly from VDR, whereas ligands with the 20-epi side chain either dissociate very slowly from VDR or induce irreversible inactivation of VDR ligand-binding sites by an unknown mechanism. To determine whether the increase in the number of unoccupied binding sites in intact cells was due to dissociation of ligand from VDR or due to reactivation of inactive VDR, we performed an in vitro exchange assay. Again, VDR-transfected COS-1 cells were incubated with a 10−8M concentration of each ligand for 1 h in serum-free medium; the ligands were removed; and the cells were washed three times and homogenized. The homogenates were incubated at 30°C with α,25-(OH)2[3H]D3, and exchange of unlabeled and radioactive ligands was measured at various times. The results (Fig. 2B) show that the exchange rate of receptor-bound unlabeled α,25-(OH)2D3 with α,25-(OH)2[3H]D3 in vitro was very rapid in the first 15 min of incubation: 55% of the receptor-bound unlabeled ligand was exchanged for the radioactive ligand. On the other hand, 45% of the receptor binding sites did not bind the radioactive ligand even after 1 h of incubation. A similar pattern of rapid exchange of ligand from a high percentage of the occupied binding sites was seen with the two N-analogues. However, rapid exchange of 1-E occurred with only 20% of the occupied VDR binding sites, and no detectable rapid exchange occurred with VDR binding sites occupied with the analogue 2-E. Only 3-E had an exchange rate similar to that of its N-analogue homologue (3-N). So, although the dissociation rate of this analogue in the cells was very slow, its exchange rate in vitro was not affected by the orientation of the side chain. It is possible that the presence of the oxygen atom at position 22 controls the interaction with the ligand-binding domain so that the orientation of the side chain does not affect the complex process of exchange that requires the simultaneous movement of 3-E out of the ligand-binding domain and α,25-(OH)2[3H]D3 into it. The results presented above, together with our earlier observations of differences in the conformation of VDR complexed with α,25-(OH)2D3 and the E-analogues (6Peleg S. Sastry M. Collins E.D. Bishop J.E. Norman A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10551-10558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), support the hypothesis that the mode of interaction of the 20-epi analogues with VDR is different from that of α,25-(OH)2D3 and the N-analogues. One possible explanation for these differences is that the contact points of the 20-epi analogues with the ligand-binding domain are different from the contact points of ligands with natural side chain stereochemistry. To test this hypothesis, we mapped the ligand-binding domain of VDR by deletions, testing the binding activities of the mutants to α,25-(OH)2D3 and the analogues. The mutation strategy was based on earlier studies by McDonnell et al. (25McDonnell D.P. Scott R. Kerner S.A. O'Malley B.W. Pike J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 635-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and Nakajima et al. (7Nakajima S. Hsieh J.-C. MacDonald P.N. Galligan M.A. Haussler C.A. Whitfield G.K. Haussler M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), who identified a C-terminal sequence between amino acids 390 and 427 as essential for ligand binding activity. To further map this region, we prepared deletion mutants by inserting stop codons at the positions shown in Fig. 3A These deletion mutants were first examined for protein expression in COS-1 cells and then for binding and transcriptional activities. Analysis by Western blotting showed that all the mutants in Fig. 3 expressed similar levels of immunoreactive VDR in COS-1 cells (data not shown). Fig. 3C shows that the transcriptional activity of VDR was abolished by deleting the C-terminal residues 420-427. This deletion did not abolish the binding activity of α,25-(OH)2D3 to VDR (Fig. 3B), but did decrease it by 50-70%. Further deletion of residues 410-420 had no marked effect on binding of α,25-(OH)2D3 to VDR, but deleting residues 403-410 induced an additional dramatic decrease, leaving only residual binding activity. This residual binding activity was completely abolished by deleting residues 396-403. From these mapping experiments, we concluded that at the C-terminal region, the amino acids important for binding of α,25-(OH)2D3 were located between residues 420 and 427 and between residues 396 and 410. Therefore, some of the amino acids required for binding of α,25-(OH)2D3 overlap with amino acids that are essential for transcriptional activity of VDR. To determine whether the binding requirements of the E-analogues were different from those of the N-analogues, we performed binding assays in which wild-type or mutant VDRs were incubated with α,25-(OH)2[3H]D3 and increasing concentrations of unlabeled competitors. The data were plotted as the inverse value of percent maximal binding against competitor concentration. The slopes of the linear plots reflect the affinity of each ligand for the α,25-(OH)2D3-binding site in wild-type and mutant VDRs. Fig. 3D shows that the slope of the competition plot of α,25-(OH)2D3 was significantly reduced by deleting residues 420-427, suggesting that the affinity of α,25-(OH)2D3 for this mutant was reduced. There was no significant reduction in the slope of the competition plot of α,25-(OH)2D3 using VDR that had an additional deletion of residues 410-420, suggesting that this deletion did not introduce another change in the affinity of α,25-(OH)2D3 for the receptor. To confirm the change in affinity of these deletion mutants for α,25-(OH)2D3, we performed saturation assays. Scatchard analysis of these assays in one experiment revealed that the equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) for α,25-(OH)2D3 binding to wild-type VDR, to deletion mutant 420/TGA, and to deletion mutant 410/TAA were 0.9, 4.5, and 3.75 nM, respectively. In another experiment, the Kd values were 1.2 nM (wild-type VDR), 7.8 nM (mutant 420/TGA), and 7.5 nM (mutant 410/TAA). The competition assays with the E-analogue 1-E showed that deleting residues 420-427 had no effect on the ability of 1-E to compete for the binding of α,25-(OH)2[3H]D3 to VDR, but deleting residues 410-420 induced a small but consistent reduction in the ability of 1-E to compete for the binding of α,25-(OH)2[3H]D3 to VDR. Therefore, we concluded that the last seven amino acids of VDR were important for the binding of α,25-(OH)2D3, but not for 1-E, and that residues 410-420 seem to be more important for the binding of the E-analogue than for the binding of α,25-(OH)2D3. Because the most significant difference in the binding requirements of α,25-(OH)2D3 and the E-analogue was within residues 420-427, we wished to determine if this difference was indeed due to the stereochemistry of the side chain and not due to its chemistry. Therefore, we repeated the competition assays with the six ligands shown in Fig. 1, using wild-type VDR and the VDR deletion mutant 420/TGA. Fig. 4 shows that the ability of α,25-(OH)2D3 and the N-analogues to compete for the binding of α,25-(OH)2[3H]D3 to VDR was significantly reduced by removal of residues 420-427. However, this deletion had either little or no effect on the ability of the E-analogues to compete for the binding of α,25-(OH)2[3H]D3 to VDR. The results of these experiments strongly suggest that the binding requirements of the E-analogues are upstream from the eight C-terminal amino acids of VDR, although we do not know which other residues are required for binding of these compounds.

Here, we show that PTH can induce a transient activation of MAP kinase as well. This was observed in both Chinese hamster ovary R15 cells stably expressing high levels of rat PTH/PTH-related peptide receptor and parietal yolk sac carcinoma cells expressing the receptor endogenously. PTH was a strong activator of adenylate cyclase and phospholipase C in Chinese hamster ovary R15 cells. PTH-induced MAP kinase activation did not depend on activation of Gi, phorbol ester-sensitive protein kinase C, elevated intracellular calcium levels, or release of Gβγ subunits. It could, however, be mimicked by addition of forskolin or 8-bromo-cAMP to these cells. Prolonged treatment with forskolin caused sustained protein kinase A activity, whereas MAP kinase activity returned to basal levels. Subsequent treatment with PTH or 8-bromo-cAMP did not result in MAP kinase activation, whereas phorbol ester- or insulin-induced MAP kinase activation was unaffected. Finally, expression of a dominant negative form of Ras (RasAsn-17), which completely blocked insulin-induced MAP kinase activation, did not affect activation by PTH or cAMP.

The activity of MAP kinase is under the control of external stimuli that mediate their effects by binding to cell surface receptors. Protein tyrosine kinase receptors transduce the signal by autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues, allowing the receptor to interact with Src homology 2 domain-containing proteins, such as Grb2, which will recruit son of sevenless, resulting in the activation of Ras. This will cause the successive activation of Raf-1, MAP kinase kinase (MEK), and MAP kinase (4Vandergeer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell.

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) regulate MAP kinase activity, depending on the identity of the G protein, the receptor, and the cell type involved. Gi-coupled receptors, such as the M2 muscarine acetylcholine receptor, the α2-adrenergic receptor, or the receptors for lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) or thrombin, stimulate MAP kinase in a Ras-dependent manner (5Winitz S.

Nature. 1994; 369: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar), whereas the Gqα-induced activation is mediated by phorbol ester-sensitive protein kinase C (PKC) in a Ras-independent manner (11Hawes, B. E., van Biesen, T., Koch, W. J., Luttrell, L. M., Lefkowitz, R. J., J. Biol. Chem., 270, 17148–17153.Google Scholar). Gs-coupled receptors, such as the β-adrenergic receptor or the pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide receptor, can either trigger or inhibit MAP kinase activation (14Crespo P.

Chem. 1994; 269: 6207-6214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is cell type-dependent and can in most cases be mimicked by addition of cell-permeable cAMP analogues. With respect to the inhibition of MAP kinase activation, it was demonstrated that activation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) interfered with Ras-mediated activation of MAP kinase at the level of Raf-1 (17Burgering B.M.T. Bos J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 18-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism behind the cAMP-mediated activation of MAP kinase, as in PC12 cells, is largely unclear (16Frödin M. Peraldi P. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol.

PTH and PTHrP bind to a common receptor, which has been shown to couple to at least two signal transduction systems: (i) a Gs-mediated increase in cAMP, leading to activation of PKA (19Fujimori A.

A. 1992; 89: 2732-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar); and (ii) a Gq-mediated activation of PLC-β, leading to increases in intracellular inositol triphosphate and calcium levels and activation of PKC (19Fujimori A.

The identity of downstream effectors and their role in cellular responses to PTH and PTHrP are unclear. We have recently demonstrated that PTH inhibits growth factor-induced MAP kinase activation in osteosarcoma cells via a pathway that is dependent on PKA (24Verheijen M.H.G. Defize L.H.K. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3331-3337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show for two cell types that triggering of the PTH/PTHrP receptor can also lead to activation of MAP kinase. This activation was not dependent on three well established Gq-mediated events, i.e.: (i) elevation of intracellular calcium levels, (ii) activation of PKC, and (iii) the release of Gβγ subunits. We provide evidence that the effect is mediated by elevation of intracellular cAMP levels and occurs in a Ras-independent manner. Rat PTH(1-34) was purchased from Peninsula Laboratories Europe (St. Helens, United Kingdom). 8-Bromo-cAMP and thapsigargin were obtained from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Thrombin, insulin, LPA, isoproterenol, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), forskolin, pertussis toxin (PTX), and the peptides Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide), myelin basic protein, and protein kinase inhibitor were from Sigma. [γ−32P]ATP and ECL were purchased from Amersham Corp. Indo-1 acetoxymethyl ester was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Polyclonal antibodies against p42 MAP kinase were kindly provided by Drs. J. L. Bos and B. M. T. Burgering (Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands). CHO-R15, CHO-β2, and CHO-K1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 7.5% fetal calf serum (FCS). PYS-2 cells were grown in medium consisting of a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F12 containing 7.5% FCS. Transient transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. One day prior to transfection, the CHO-R15 cells were plated at a density of 8 × 103 cells/cm2 in six-well tissue culture clusters. The following day they were cotransfected with plasmid DNA encoding p44 HA-MAP kinase (2 μg/well), Gα subunit of retinal transducin (Gαt) (1 μg/well), or RasAsn-17 (3 μg/well). Puc-Rous sarcoma virus plasmid was added to bring the total amount of plasmid DNA to 10 μg/well. Nearly confluent CHO-R15 monolayers, attached to rectangular glass coverslips, were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum for 18 h. The cells were loaded with indo-1 by exposing them to 10 μM indo-1 ester for 40 min at 37°C. [Ca2+]-dependent fluorescence was recorded at an excitation wavelength of 355 nm and an emission of 405 nm (25Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Since we were not able to perform proper calibration of the calcium responses in CHO-R15 cells, we related the calcium response to PTH(1-34) to that to thrombin (1 arbitrary unit). The CHO and PYS-2 cells were plated in concentrations of, respectively, 2.5 × 104 and 1 × 104 cells/cm2 in six-well tissue culture clusters and grown for 24 h. The cells were incubated in medium containing 0.5% FCS for 18 h and subsequently treated with agents as indicated. MAP kinase phosphorylation was measured by Western blotting with anti-p42 MAP kinase antibodies as described previously (24Verheijen M.H.G. Defize L.H.K. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3331-3337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylated p42 MAP kinase is detected as a band with reduced mobility compared with unphosphorylated p42 MAP kinase (26Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Experiments were repeated at least three times, and representative results are shown. For determination of MAP kinase activity, endogenous p42 MAP kinase and epitope-tagged p44 HA-MAP kinase were immunoprecipitated with protein A-Sepharose beads coupled to, respectively, anti-p42 MAP kinase antibodies and monoclonal antibody 12CA5, as described previously (24Verheijen M.H.G. Defize L.H.K. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3331-3337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Meloche S. Pagès G. Pouysségur J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). After the kinase reaction with myelin basic protein as a substrate, the reaction mix was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Phosphorylation of myelin basic protein was measured using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). CHO-R15 cells were plated at a concentration of 2.5 × 104 cells/cm2 in 96-well tissue culture clusters and grown for 24 h. The cells were incubated in medium containing 0.5% FCS for 18 h and subsequently treated with agents as indicated. Activation of PKA was measured as described previously (24Verheijen M.H.G. Defize L.H.K. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3331-3337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Heasly L.E. Johnson G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 35: 331-338Google Scholar). Briefly, digitonin-permeabilized cells were incubated with a salt solution containing [γ-−32P]ATP and Kemptide as a substrate, with or without protein kinase inhibitor as an inhibitory peptide. After a 10-min incubation, the reaction was stopped with 25% trichloroacetic acid, and the trichloroacetic acid-soluble material was spotted on phosphocellulose filters. The difference in radioactivity incorporated in the filters between samples treated with protein kinase inhibitor- versus non-protein kinase inhibitor-treated samples was defined as PKA activity. Whereas in most cell types the PTH/PTHrP receptor is a potent activator of Gs, the activation of Gq is suggested to be dependent on receptor density (29Guo J. Iida-Klein A. Huang X. Abou-Samra A.B. Segre G.V. Bringhurst F.R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3884-3891Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of PTH on MAP kinase activity in a situation in which the receptor couples strongly to both Gs and Gq (21Abou-Samra A.B. Jüppner H. Force T. Freeman M.W. Kong X.F. Schipani E. Urena P. Richards J. Bonventre J.V. Potts J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Segre G.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2732-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar, 29Guo J. Iida-Klein A. Huang X. Abou-Samra A.B. Segre G.V. Bringhurst F.R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3884-3891Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we used Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with the rat PTH/PTHrP receptor (CHO-R15). Binding studies with a radioiodinated PTH analogue, PTH(1-34), revealed that these cells express approximately 300,000 PTH/PTHrP receptors per cell. 2M. H. G. Verheijen and L. H. K. Defize, unpublished observations. Activation of MAP kinase was detected using a gel mobility shift assay (26Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Treatment of the cells with 10−7M PTH(1-34) induced a transient phosphorylation of MAP kinase, which was maximal after 5-10 min and returned to a basal level within 60 min (Fig. 1A). PTH(1-34) induced MAP kinase phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner, starting at 10−11M (Fig. 1B). Well established pathways used by GPCRs in the activation of MAP kinase involve Gi or PKC (5Winitz S. Russell M. Qian N.-X. Gardner A. Dwyer L. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19196-19199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Alblas J. van Corven E.J. Hordijk P.L. Milligan G. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol.

Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 304-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We tested their involvement in the PTH-induced MAP kinase activation by a prolonged treatment of the cells with PTX and TPA to respectively inhibit Gi and down-modulate PKC. As expected, PTX inhibited the thrombin-induced MAP kinase activation by approximately 80%, whereas prolonged TPA treatment completely inhibited the TPA-induced MAP kinase activation. Neither of the treatments affected the activation of MAP kinase by PTH (data not shown). Combined treatment with PTX and TPA completely inhibited the activation of MAP kinase by both thrombin and TPA but had no effect on the activation of MAP kinase by PTH(1-34) (Fig. 2). Thus it appears that the PTH-induced MAP kinase activation is not dependent on Gi or TPA-sensitive PKC. Stimulation of CHO-R15 cells with PTH(1-34) induced a transient increase in intracellular calcium, as shown in Fig. 3A Several reports demonstrate that an increase in intracellular calcium can be sufficient to activate MAP kinase (32Chao T.S.O.

A. 1996; 93: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We first examined whether PTH mobilizes calcium from an intracellular or extracellular source by incubating the cells with thapsigargin. This depletes calcium from intracellular stores (36Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drøbak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (3008) Google Scholar). As is demonstrated in Fig. 3A for FCS, the rapid component, due to release of calcium from intracellular stores, was completely inhibited by a 40-min thapsigargin pretreatment, whereas the slower component, due to calcium influx, was not. The calcium response to PTH(1-34) was completely inhibited by thapsigargin, suggesting that PTH induces release of calcium from intracellular stores. Thapsigargin treatment by itself induced transient MAP kinase phosphorylation (Fig. 3B), showing that, also in CHO-R15 cells, a strong increase in intracellular calcium can be sufficient to activate MAP kinase. To determine whether an increase in calcium levels is necessary for the activation of MAP kinase by PTH, we prevented both calcium release and calcium influx by preincubating the cells with EGTA followed by thapsigargin. 30 min after the addition of these reagents, the phosphorylation of MAP kinase had returned to basal levels. Subsequent addition of PTH(1-34) stimulated MAP kinase phosphorylation to a similar level as in control cells, indicating that an increase in intracellular calcium levels is not required for MAP kinase activation by PTH. Another GPCR-mediated event, described as being involved in the activation of MAP kinase, is the release of Gβγ subunits (8Faure M. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7851-7854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine a possible role of Gβγ subunits in the PTH-induced MAP kinase activation in CHO-R15 cells, we expressed Gαt to sequester Gβγ subunits after they are released from G proteins on receptor stimulation (8Faure M. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7851-7854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows that Gαt expression efficiently inhibits the activation of a cotransfected, hemagglutinin-tagged MAP kinase (HA-MAP kinase) (27Meloche S. Pagès G. Pouysségur J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) by LPA, showing that Gβγ subunits are indeed efficiently sequestered (9Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Allen L.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12706-12710Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 13van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Luttrell D.K. Krueger K.M. Touhara K. Porfiri E. Sakaue M. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 781-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). However, PTH(1-34)-induced MAP kinase activation is not affected, suggesting that this is not dependent on the release of Gβγ subunits. PTH is a strong activator of adenylate cyclase in CHO-R15 cells (data not shown). Elevation of intracellular cAMP levels inhibits MAP kinase activation in many cell types (17Burgering B.M.T. Bos J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 18-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), and we have previously shown that it is involved in the inhibition of MAP kinase by PTH in osteosarcoma cells (24Verheijen M.H.G. Defize L.H.K. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3331-3337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We were therefore surprised to find that elevation of intracellular cAMP levels by addition of forskolin or the cell-permeable cAMP analogue 8-bromo-cAMP induced a transient phosphorylation of MAP kinase in CHO-R15 cells (Fig. 5A). The kinetics and the quantity of this phosphorylation were comparable with the phosphorylation induced by PTH(1-34) (Fig. 1A). Also, in wild-type CHO cells (CHO-K1), elevation of cAMP levels resulted in MAP kinase phosphorylation (Fig. 5B). To examine whether Gs-induced cAMP formation is sufficient for MAP kinase activation, we measured the activation of MAP kinase by a typically Gs-coupled receptor, the β-adrenergic receptor. Addition of isoproterenol to CHO cells stably transfected with the β2-adrenergic receptor (CHO-β2) (37Nantel F. Marullo S. Krief S. Strosberg A.D. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13148-13155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) resulted in a phosphorylation of MAP kinase with the same quantity and kinetics as the phosphorylation induced by PTH in CHO-R15 cells (Fig. 5C). 8-Bromo-cAMP also induced phosphorylation of MAP kinase in these cells (not shown). Thus, elevation of cAMP levels through activation of Gs is sufficient to explain MAP kinase activation by PTH in CHO-R15 cells. To determine whether elevation of cAMP could account for MAP kinase activation by PTH, we measured activation of MAP kinase after prolonged incubation (2 h) with forskolin. This resulted in a sustained PKA activation (Fig. 6B), whereas MAP kinase activity had returned to basal levels (Fig. 6A). Subsequent stimulation with insulin or TPA resulted in phosphorylation of MAP kinase to a comparable level as in nonpretreated cells, whereas addition of 8-bromo-cAMP or PTH(1-34) no longer induced phosphorylation of MAP kinase (Fig. 6A). 8-Bromo-cAMP or PTH had no or little effect on PKA activity in cells preincubated with forskolin (Fig. 6B). Similar results were obtained when cells were incubated overnight with cholera toxin (data not shown). Importantly, preincubation with forskolin had no effect on the PTH(1-34)-induced calcium release (Fig. 6C), showing that PTH/PTHrP receptor functioning was not impaired. Taken together, these results suggest that the activation of MAP kinase by PTH is mediated solely by elevation of intracellular cAMP levels.Fig. 6Prolonged cAMP elevation inhibits MAP kinase activation by PTH and other cAMP-elevating agents. A, CHO-R15 cells were left untreated or pretreated with 10 μM forskolin for 2 h and subsequently stimulated with 1 mM 8-bromo-cAMP, 100 nM PTH(1-34), 1 μg/ml insulin, 1 ng/ml TPA, or 100 ng/ml TPA for 10 min. MAP kinase activity was determined by a mobility shift. B, CHO-R15 cells were left untreated or pretreated with 10 μM forskolin for 2 h and subsequently stimulated with 100 nM PTH(1-34) or 1 mM 8-bromo-cAMP for 10 min. PKA activity was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data represent the means ± S.D. (bars) of triplicate samples.

Bos J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 18-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). To examine the involvement of Ras in the activation of MAP kinase by PTH, we interfered with Ras-mediated signaling by overexpression of a dominant-negative form of Ras, RasAsn-17 (38de Vries-Smits A.M.M. Burgering B.M.T. Bos J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). This was performed either by infection of the cells with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing RasAsn-17, to interfere with endogenous Ras molecules, or by cotransfection of RasAsn-17 and HA-MAP kinase. Stimulations with insulin and TPA were used as controls for, respectively, Ras-dependent and -independent activation of MAP kinase (38de Vries-Smits A.M.M. Burgering B.M.T. Bos J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 39de Vries-Smits A.M.M. Burgering B.M.T. Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. Bos J.L. Nature. 1992; 357: 602-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Infection with wild-type vaccinia virus had no effect. As expected, expression of RasAsn-17 completely inhibited the activation of MAP kinase by insulin, whereas TPA-induced MAP kinase activation was not affected (Fig. 7A). Interestingly, forskolin and PTH(1-34) also were still able to induce MAP kinase activation. Similar results were seen with transfected RASAsn-17 on the activation of cotransfected HA-MAP kinase (Fig. 7B). These results suggest the existence of a Ras-independent MAP kinase-activating pathway in CHO cells, which involves elevated cAMP levels and can be triggered by the PTH/PTHrP receptor. To test the relevance of our findings for PTH/PTHrP receptor signaling, we tested several cell lines that express the receptor endogenously. Fig. 8 shows that PTH(1-34) can also induce MAP kinase activation in one such cell line, parietal yolk sac carcinoma (PYS-2) cells (40Liapi C. Gerbaud P. Anderson W.B. Evain Brion D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 133: 405-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This activation was not affected by prolonged TPA treatment, suggesting that TPA-sensitive PKC is not involved. PTH is a strong inducer of cAMP formation in PYS-2 cells (40Liapi C. Gerbaud P. Anderson W.B. Evain Brion D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 133: 405-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and forskolin induced an activation of MAP kinase in these cells as well, suggesting a comparable mechanism for PTH-induced MAP kinase activation in PYS-2 and CHO-R15 cells. In the present study, we show that stimulation of the PTH/PTHrP receptor induces activation of MAP kinase in CHO-R15 and PYS-2 cells. PTH-induced MAP kinase activation was not dependent on PLC-me"

The T4 terminase is composed of two subunits, gene products (gp) 16 and 17. The role of the small subunit, gp16, in T4 DNA packaging is not well characterized. We developed a new purification procedure to obtain large quantities of purified gp16 from an overexpression vector. The pure protein is found in two molecular weight forms, due to specific C-terminal truncation, displays in vitro packaging activity, and binds but does not hydrolyze ATP. gp16 forms specific oligomers, rings, and side-by-side double rings, as judged by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and scanning transmission electron microscopy measurements. The single ring contains about eight monomers, and the rings have a diameter of about 8 nm with a central hole of about 2 nm. A DNA-binding helix-turn-helix motif close to the N terminus of gp16 is predicted. The oligomers do not bind to DNA, but following denaturation and renaturation in the presence of DNA, binding can be demonstrated by gel shift and filter binding assays. gp16 binds to double-stranded DNA but not single-stranded DNA, and appears to bind preferentially to a gene 16-containing DNA sequence.

Terminases in most of the phages contain two subunits. The large subunit generally has DNA-dependent ATPase and endonuclease activities, whereas the DNA-binding specificity resides in the small subunit (cf. Ref. 1Black L.W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1989; 43: 267-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). λ terminase specifically binds and cuts at a unique cos site to leave 12-base 5′ protruding complementary ends at both termini (2Feiss M. Becker A. Hendrix R.W. Roberts J.W. Stahl F.W. Weisberg R.A. Lambda II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1983: 305-330Google Scholar, 3Murialdo H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 125-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For phages P1 or P22, the terminases bind and cut specifically near an initiation packaging (pac) site and then generate nonspecific ends, which result from processive headful packaging (4Skorupski K. Pierce J.C. Sauer B. Sternberg N. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 977-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 5Casjens S. Sampson L. Randall S. Eppler K. Wu H. Petri J.B. Schmieger H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 1086-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although it was first established in phage T4 that the mature DNA ends result from headful packaging, in the case of T4 the mechanism of DNA end formation in packaging is less well defined (6Streisinger G. Emrich J. Stahl M.M. Genetics. 1967; 57: 292-295Google Scholar). In fact, the phage T4 terminase displays many of the features of other phage terminases, including the small (gp16) and large (gp17) subunit structure (1Black L.W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1989; 43: 267-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 7Rao V.B. Black L.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Our genetic studies implicate gp16, the small subunit of T4 terminase, in amplifying a gene 17-gene 19 fragment. This is achieved by recombination following alignment of two homologous 24-base pair segments within gene 16 and gene 19 in T4 Hp17 (amplification) mutants. A synapsis model was proposed to correlate this novel activity with the known role of gene 16 in initiation of DNA packaging and in controlling activity of gp17, the terminase large subunit. This amplification suggests DNA binding by gp16 whose sequence specificity remains to be assessed (8Wu C.H.H. Lin H. Black L.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 523-528PubMed Google Scholar, 9Black L.W.

ATP hydrolysis is required for phage in vitro DNA packaging (1Black L.W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1989; 43: 267-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 10Morita M. Tasaka M. Fujisawa H. Virology. 1993; 193: 748-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). ATP not only provides an energy source for DNA translocation into the prohead, but also acts as an allosteric effector to control terminase holoenzyme specificity (11Higgins R.R. Lucko H.J. Becker A. Cell. 1988; 54: 765-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). λ terminase has two ATP binding sites, where the high affinity site is located in the large subunit, and the low affinity site exists in the small subunit in which a weak ATPase activity was detected (12Feiss M. Trends Genet. 1986; 2: 100-104Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 13Tomka M.A. Catalano C.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11992-11997Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 14Becker A. Gold M. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 199: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It is possible that ATP binding to the terminase small subunit may serve mainly as an allosteric effector rather than in energy transduction. Thus in the Bacillus subtilis phage SPP1, the small subunit binds but does not hydrolyze ATP (15Chai S. Kruft V. Alonso J.C. Virology. 1994; 202: 930-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In T4, the large subunit showed DNA-dependent ATPase activity (7Rao V.B. Black L.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), whereas gp16 did not. This is consistent with our present findings; weak ATP binding to gp16 is observed, but not ATP hydrolysis. Many overexpressed small terminase subunits form high molecular weight species. Overexpressed λ gpNu1 was found mainly in insoluble aggregates, raising difficulties for purification as well as for the study of DNA binding. This obstacle has been overcome by a well established solubilizing method, followed by a subsequent renaturation step (16Parris W. Rubinchik S. Yang Y.-C. Gold M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13564-13574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, overexpressed T4 gp16 (Mr = 18,387; Ref. 17Powell D. Franklin J. Arisaka F. Mosig G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18Google Scholar) is quite soluble, although it chromatographs as a high molecular weight complex whose structural properties were not characterized (7Rao V.B. Black L.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In this study, a new overexpression vector for production of gp16 at a higher level was constructed and a novel purification scheme was developed to obtain higher yields of pure active gp16. This report characterizes the DNA packaging activity, ATP affinity, and DNA binding properties of gp16, as well as the structure of the monomeric protein and of two specific oligomeric assemblies that it forms in vivo and in vitro An XhoI-EcoRI fragment containing gene 16 and its ribosome binding site (RBS) as well as the T4 late promoter for genes 16 and 17 (7Rao V.B.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18Google Scholar) was cut from plasmid pR16, and inserted into a pET12a vector containing a φ10 T7 promoter, to make pL16 (Fig. 1). HMS174 (DE3) was transformed with pL16 and induced at A600 = 0.4 by adding 0.4 mM IPTG at 37°C for 4 h as described by Studier et al. (18Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar). IPTG induced HMS174 (DE3) bacteria containing pL16 from 2 liters of Luria Broth were collected by centrifugation at 4,225 × g for 10 min and resuspended in buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, and 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)). The suspension was then disrupted in a French press at a pressure of 20,000 lb. After centrifuging down the cell debris at 26,890 × g for 30 min, 5% (final concentration) streptomycin sulfate was added to the 30-ml supernatant. The supernatant was stirred for 20 min at 4°C and centrifuged again at 26,890 × g for 30 min. Solid ammonium sulfate was slowly added to the streptomycin supernatant to reach 50% final concentration at 4°C. After sitting on ice for 1 h, the insoluble material was collected by centrifuging at 26,890 × g for 1 h and was resuspended in 15 ml of buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 0.5 mM DTT, and 0.1 mM PMSF). Solid urea was added to reach a final concentration of 6 M after overnight dialysis against buffer B. The urea-denatured sample was loaded into a 10-ml Bio-Rad ceramic hydroxyapatite column, which was equilibrated with buffer C (buffer B + 6 M urea). After extensively washing with buffer C, a 0-10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) gradient in buffer C was developed. A Bio-Rad high Q column (5-ml cartridge) was equilibrated with buffer Q (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mM DTT, 0.1 mM ATP, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2, and 0.1 mM PMSF). The hydroxyapatite peak fractions were freed from urea gradually by dialysis against buffer Q containing, successively, 3, 1.5, 0.75, and 0 M urea. The renatured protein was loaded onto the High Q column, and a 0.10-1 M NaCl gradient was applied. The fractions containing gp16, as judged by SDS-PAGE, were collected and rechromatographed on the High Q column to remove high molecular weight contaminants. Except for the room temperature hydroxyapatite column, the remainder of the purification was performed at 4°C on a Bio-Rad Econo System. 100 μg of gp16 was eluted from the gel according to Hager and Burgess (19Hager D.A. Burgess R.R. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 109: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). 20-30 μg of the eluted gp16 in phosphate-buffered saline was emulsified with an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant and injected into the rabbit subcutaneously. 20 μg of eluted gp16 in Freund's incomplete adjuvant was injected subcutaneously 3 weeks later. A subsequent booster, using 10 μg of gp16, was given similarly to the first one. Four days later, the antiserum was obtained and was able to interact with gp16 as judged by Western blotting. The preimmune serum was harvested prior to the first antigen injection from the same rabbit. 35S-Labeled late protein lysates from T4 wild type and mutants grown in a non-suppressor-containing strain were obtained according to Vanderslice and Yegian (20Vanderslice R.W. Yegian C.D. Virology. 1974; 60: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), except the labeling time was from 10-35 min after the first infection. 10 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (850 Ci/mmol) was added to the overexpression strain after a 10-min induction. A labeled gp16-containing bacterial lysate was harvested 50 min after the addition of the isotope at 37°C. Labeled bacterial extracts were prepared immediately after centrifugation by boiling in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis running buffer, and 15,000 cpm from each lysate was used to do immunoprecipitation with anti-gp16 antiserum according to the procedure of McNicol et al. (21McNicol L.A. Simon L.D. Black L.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 116: 183-261Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). 20 μl of gp16 in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, 6 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT, 5 μM gp16, and 0.5 μM [α-32P]ATP (800 Ci/mmol) was incubated at 37°C for 60 s. Then it was placed on parafilm resting on an aluminum block on ice and irradiated with a General Electric G15T8 15-watt germicidal UV lamp at a distance of 8 cm for 20 min. 1 μl of 50 mM ATP was added to stop the reaction. After the addition of 10 μg of gp16 as carrier protein, 200 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid was added and a precipitate was allowed to form on ice for 1 h. After spinning at 23,500 × g for 1 h, the pellet was washed with 1 ml of 20% trichloroacetic acid followed by acetone. Then it was subjected to SDS-PAGE, dried, and autoradiographed (22Biswas S.B. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7990-7993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATPase assays were carried out by chromatography on polyethyleneimine-cellulose, followed by autoradiography according to Debreceni et al. (23Debreceni N. Behme M.T. Ebisuzaki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 41: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Analysis of oligomers of gp16 was performed at Brookhaven National Laboratory using the STEM facility. Freeze-dried specimens for mass analysis were prepared by the wet film technique (24Wall J.S. Hainfield J.F. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 355-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples in solution were deposited on thin carbon film, which had tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) as an internal control previously deposited on them. The samples were extensively washed with 20 mM ammonium acetate before being freeze-dried overnight. Stained specimens were prepared similarly except that the final wash was stain, which in this case was 2% methylamine vanadate (Nanovan, Nanoprobes, Inc., Stony Brook, NY), and the samples were air-dried. Mass analysis of unstained freeze-dried specimens is possible because the number of scattered electrons collected by the annular detectors in the dark field mode is directly proportional to the mass thickness. An automated computer program (Automass) was developed by J. Wall to analyze the digital STEM data. By subtracting the background of the thin carbon supporting film, using an appropriate calibration (either determined from the control TMV present, or using the microscope calibration), the sum of the scattered electrons over the area of an individual particle gives its molecular weight. The Automass program selects TMV segments and particles to measure which fit a model (models) whose parameters have been chosen. Two different models were used to select the larger oligomer forms (see Table II).Table II.STEM measurement for the mass of gp16 oligomersOligomersAverage massCopy numberskDa1.

Open table in a new tab A 24-base ssDNA oligonucleotide sequence (5′-GAAGCTCATGATGCTCGTCAGAAG-3′) was synthesized (Biopolymer Lab located at University of Maryland at Baltimore Medical School). 10 pmol of DNA was labeled by phosphorylation with bacteriophage T4 polynucleotide kinase (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 10.2-11.61Google Scholar). The radiolabeled fragment was purified by Ultrafree-MC filter units, 5,000 nominal molecular weight limitation low binding-regenerated cellulose membrane (Millipore), spun at 6,500 rpm (microcentrifuge) for 1 h. 100 μl of Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer was added, and the oligonucleotide was spun for another 1 h to wash free of radioactive mononucleotide. The probe was resuspended in 30 μl of TE (pH 8.0). A 215-base pair PCR product, made from pL16 with primer 22 (5′ GAATGCGACAGTATTCATGG 3′) and primer 4 (5′ AGATTTTATCCAATGAATTCCATCT 3′), which corresponds to the 3′ end of gene 16 (8Wu C.H.H. Lin H. Black L.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 523-528PubMed Google Scholar), was isolated from 4% FMC Nusieve GTG agarose run in 1 × Tris-acetate-EDTA (TAE) buffer using a Qiaex gel extraction kit from Qiagen Co. The DNA fragment was labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 10.2-11.61Google Scholar) and was purified as the above except using Ultrafree-MC filter units, 10,000 nominal molecular weight limitation low binding-regenerated cellulose membrane. The labeled DNAs (8 × 10−8μm ssDNA; 2.5 × 10−7μm 215-base pair dsDNA fragment) were mixed with 2.7 × 10−3μm denatured gp16 in 100 μl (final volume) of buffer Q with 2 M urea and renatured by gradually dialyzing away the urea from Q buffer containing successive urea concentrations of 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.00125, and 0 M. The renatured gp16 with or without the addition of anti-gp16 antiserum or preimmune serum was run on an 8% native polyacrylamide gel in 1 × TAE in the presence of ATP and Mg2+. The gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. Plasmids pL16 and pET12a were radioactively labeled by nick translation (Amersham Corp.). Membrane filters (HATF) from Millipore were soaked in soaking buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mM DTT, 3 mM ATP, and 1.5 mM MgCl2) for 30 min. gp16 was concentrated by 5% trichloroacetic acid precipitation on ice and washed twice with acetone. The dried pellet was redissolved to 10 mg/ml in 6 M urea in Q buffer. Aliquots of the 6 M urea-dissolved protein were pipetted into a series of microcentrifuge tubes. The protein was then gradually renatured by adding aliquots (sequential additions of the original volume) of the Q buffer to dilute the urea. When the protein was suspended in 2 M urea, 5 fmol of DNA probe (3000-5000 cpm) was added to each reaction tube in the final volume of 20 μl. By adding serial amounts of Q buffer, the protein and probe were renatured gradually by diluting the urea concentration to 1, 0.5, and 0.25 M at room temperature. The samples were then allowed to sit at room temperature overnight, and 1 ml of Q buffer was added the next day, mixed, and the mixture slowly filtered through the membrane at a speed of 2 ml/min on a Millipore filtration manifold. The membranes were washed once with 1 ml of 50 mM NaCl in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 2.5 mM EDTA. The membranes were air-dried and subjected to scintillation counting. A 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel was used for the separation of the gp16 monomer, and an 8% native polyacrylamide gel was used for the DNA binding (band shift) measurements and for characterization of the oligomeric complexes. Polyacrylamide gels were run by standard methods (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 10.2-11.61Google Scholar). Electroblotting of SDS-PAGE for N-terminal sequencing was according to Bio-Rad, and N-terminal sequencing was done by the Macromolecular Resources Lab at Colorado State University. C-terminal sequencing of the purified gp16 (Q2, Table I) and of the two proteins separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto Teflon supports (26Bailey J.M. Shenoy N.R. Ronk M. Shively J.E. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 68-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) was kindly performed by Dr. Jerome Bailey, Hewlett-Packard Co. Mass spectrometry was carried out on fraction Q2 at the Hewlett-Packard Co., Palo Alto, Calif. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad).Table I.Purification of terminase subunit gp16FractionaFractions are as described in Fig. 1BProtein amountsTotal activitySpecific activityYieldsPurificationmgunitsbUnit is a plaque forming unit assayed as defined under “Materials and methods”.units/μg%-fold1.

Open table in a new tab The in vitro T4 DNA packaging assay was according to Black (27Black L.W. Virology. 1981; 113: 336-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) using gene 16amN87-amN67 rII deletion mutant-infected bacterial extracts containing ∼2 × 109 proheads. pL16 has three ATG and RBS sites (Fig. 1): one in the NdeI site 5′ to the gene 16 coding region, a second at the beginning of gene 16, and a third within gene 16 which initiates translation of gene 17 at the five-codon, out-of-frame overlapping region between genes 16 and 17 The first 105 base pairs of gene 17 remain in the pL16 plasmid. A truncated peptide is expected from the first ATG, since there are two downstream stop codons before the second gene 16 ATG site. Therefore, the overexpressed gp16 is expected to be synthesized only from the RBS and ATG site for gene 16 found in the phage T4 DNA sequences. Optimal synthesis of gp16 from the expression vector was assessed by Western blotting using an antiserum prepared against gp16 (data not shown). The overexpression level could reach about 5-10% of the total protein (Fig. 2), which is much higher than the previous λpL promoter driven overexpression plasmid, pR16 (7Rao V.B. Black L.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Following a new purification procedure of six steps (Fig. 1), concentrated gp16 was obtained with about a 40-fold increase in specific DNA packaging activity (Table I). In the final High Q column, a 0.10 to 1.0 M NaCl gradient was applied and the protein profile was followed by SDS-PAGE. The correspondence of the protein (as measured by A280), gp16 (SDS-PAGE Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 stained for protein), and activity profiles with an in vitro DNA packaging assay is given in Fig. 3. The new purification scheme, summarized in Table I, gave us about 40% yield of active purified protein, 1% of the total protein, and more than ∼95% purity was achieved.Fig. 3Assessment of the purity of gp16 in the final chromatography step and synthesis of two molecular weight forms of gp16.

Both proteins yielded the predicted gp16 N-terminal sequence following blotting and microsequencing, MEGLDINK, strongly suggesting that both are gene 16 products. Mass spectrometry of the purified gp16 (Q2 fraction) that gave rise to the doublet showed a mixture of two components with masses of 18,406 and 17,513 Da, as compared to a DNA sequence (17Powell D. Franklin J. Arisaka F. Mosig G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18Google Scholar) calculated molecular mass of 18,387 Da. The major C-terminal group was arginine, and the minor end group was the expected aspartic acid, which corresponded to the end groups found in the major lower band, and the minor upper band, respectively, following analysis of the electroblotted proteins (26Bailey J.M. Shenoy N.R. Ronk M. Shively J.E. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 68-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Loss of nine amino acids from the C-terminal end of the full-length protein would leave an arginine C terminus and yield a protein with predicted molecular mass of 17,448 Da. Therefore, a specific C-terminal truncation of a majority of the polypeptide chains apparently yields the two components detected after the purification (see “Discussion”). The activity of purified gp16 was measured by an in vitro DNA packaging assay. Trace activity (∼2 × 103 plaque-forming units/ml) was present even in the absence of gp16, since the small subunit is partially dispensable for the packaging of mature DNA (7Rao V.B. Black L.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The DNA packaging activity of purified gp16 appeared to reach a plateau value at ∼0.3 μg (0.33 μM) (Fig. 4). The activity decreased slightly thereafter, possibly due to the presence of high salt in the sample, or because the inactive oligomer is favored over the formation of the gp16-gp17 holoenzyme. The purified gp16 contains no endonuclease activity as measured (data not shown). The purified protein is highly active, since a half-maximal yield of phage is reached at a concentration of the purified gp16 of about 5.5 × 10−2μM (0.05 μg). However, the enzymatic activity measured in the lower concentration range is not linear with respect to the amount of protein added. Probably, multiple copies of gp16 are required to form an active packaging gp16-gp17 (terminase) complex, which occurs below the 0.01 μg (1.1 × 10−2μM) level and contributes to a threshold stage (Fig. 4, inset). When gp16 and gp17 are co-expressed, the gp17 and gp16 are found to be associated during purification, although the association appears to be weak (7Rao V.B. Black L.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). ATP was UV-cross-linked to gp16 (22Biswas S.B. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7990-7993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the labeling was prevented by the presence of 50 (and 500) μM non-radioactive ATP (Fig. 5, A and B). Without UV irradiation, ATP was not able to cross-link to gp16 (data not shown). We observed that the lower gp16 band (the major form) bound ATP less well than the upper band. Unexpectedly, a ∼50-kDa band appeared in the protein-stained gel as well as the autoradiogram. Since the band also appeared in the UV-irradiated sample containing protein without the addition of any ATP, but was dependent upon UV irradiation, it could be due to cross-linking of protein monomers to form multimers via tyrosine residues, which are in proximity in the gp16 oligomer. ATPase activity was also measured in the presence and absence of dsDNA and of 1% Sarkosyl to dissociate the oligomers; however, no ATP hydrolysis was detected even following overnight incubation with 10 μg of gp16 (data not shown). Of course, a gp16-associated ATPase activity could appear when the protein is assembled with gp17 and proheads. The purified gp16 fractions were run on an 8% native polyacrylamide gel. gp16 migrated as two sharp high molecular weight complexes toward the top of the gel, C1 and C2, with little or no detectable gp16 monomer (Fig. 6). The oligomers reformed from 6 M urea, and were stable in 1 M NaCl, although Sarkosyl treatment released some monomer (Fig. 6, lane 9). The molecular weight of the lower major band was judged from the polyacrylamide migration compared to standards to be in the mass range of 150-200 kDa. This measurement is consistent with the STEM measurement of the complexes (Table II). Fraction 19 from the 8% native acrylamide gel was used to prepare specimens for the STEM. Masses were determined on unstained, freeze-dried specimens, such as shown in Fig. 7A The summary of the mass measurements is shown in Table II. A histogram of the mass measurements (Fig. 8) shows that the mass distribution over 680 particles is bimodal, suggesting that the sample contained at least two populations of particles.

The enzymes were purified to homogeneity using a combination of ion exchange, hydroxyapatite, gel filtration, and Mono Q column chromatography. Molecular masses of amadoriase enzymes Ia, Ib, and Ic were 51 kDa, and 49 kDa for amadoriase II. Apparent kinetic constants for Nε-fructosyl Nα-t-butoxycarbonyl lysine and fructosyl adamantanamine were almost identical for enzymes Ia, Ib, and Ic, but corresponding values for enzyme II were significantly different. FAD was identified in all enzymes based on its typical absorption spectrum. N-terminal sequence was identical for enzymes Ia and Ib (Ala-Pro-Ser-Ile-Leu-Ser-Thr-Glu-Ser-Ser-Ile-Ile-Val-Ile-Gly-Ala-Gly-Thr-Trp-Gly-) and Ic except that the first 5 amino acids were truncated. The sequence of enzyme II was different (Ala-Val-Thr-Lys-Ser-Ser-Ser-Leu-Leu-Ile-Val-Gly-Ala-Gly-Thr-Trp-Gly-Thr-Ser-Thr-). All enzymes had the FAD cofactor-binding consensus sequence Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Gly within the N-terminal sequence. In summary, these data show the presence of two distinct amadoriase enzymes in the Aspergillus sp. soil strain selected on fructosyl adamantanamine and induced by fructosyl propylamine.

Nonenzymatic glycation of proteins has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications as one of several mechanisms by which chronic elevation of glycemia may be responsible for the early cellular and extracellular dysfunctions triggered by diabetes. The Amadori product, which forms in the initial stages of the Maillard reaction in vivo, has been shown to be recognized by receptors at the surface of monocytes, aortic endothelial, and mesangial cells (1Salazar R.

Collectively, these data suggest that increased levels of Amadori product in diabetes may be responsible for much of the glucotoxicity underlying the pathogenesis of diabetic complications. Based on this premise, we began a few years ago to search for novel ways to selectively prevent the effects of protein glycation by attempting to deglycate proteins enzymatically (16Gerhardinger C. Taneda S. Marion M.S. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27297-27302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the ultimate goal of utilizing such enzymes in transgenic models of hyperglycemia. We found and partially purified a deglycating enzyme in a Pseudomonas sp. soil strain selected for growth with glycated ε-aminocaproic acid as sole carbon source (17Gerhardinger C. Marion M.S. Rovner A. Glomb M. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 218-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, the enzyme obtained cleaved glycated substrates at the N-alkyl instead of the ketoamine bond and released free fructosamine, while the deaminated alkyl residue spontaneously oxidized to the acid. We synthesized a highly sterically inhibited Amadori product using adamantanamine, and utilized this substrate as sole carbon source to select soil organisms. Two molecularly distinct isoenzymes were obtained from an Aspergillus sp., which can degrade both glycated low molecular weight amines and amino acids. The work described below provides a basis for the molecular analysis of deglycating enzymes and their biological mechanism of regulation. N,O-Bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide (BtmSA) was obtained from Fluka. Silica gel-coated aluminum thin layer chromatography plates (0.2 mm thick) were obtained from EM Separations (Gibbstown, NJ). α-Glucosone was a gift from Dr. Milton Feather (Department of Biochemistry, University of Missouri) or synthesized from the phenylosazone derivative (18Richtmyer N.K. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1963; 2: 127-131Google Scholar) as described by Bayne (19Bayne S. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1963; 2: 421-423Google Scholar). Adamantanamine and o-phenylenediamine (OPD) were purchased from Aldrich. Aminopropyl glass, poly-D-lysine, poly-L-lysine, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), EDTA, bovine serum albumin (BSA) (fraction V) and m-aminophenylboronic acid agarose were from Sigma. Glucosone triazine was a gift from Dr. Marcus Glomb. DEAE-Sepharose, Sephacryl S-200, and Mono Q were purchased from Pharmacia (Uppsala, Sweden). Bio-Gel HT hydroxyapatite was obtained from Bio-Rad. All other materials were analytical grade. Fructosyl adamantanamine was synthesized according to a modified protocol of Hodge and Rist (20Hodge J.E. Rist C.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1953; 75: 316-322Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar). 5 g of adamantanamine, 3.8 g of glucose, and 10 ml of acetylacetone were heated in 100 ml of ethanol for 2 h under reflux. The solution was evaporated, and the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (17 × 2.5 cm, eluent: n-butanol/NH3, 10:1; monitored by TLC, eluent: ethanol/NH3, 10:1, RF = 0.4, detected with 0.2% ninhydrin in ethanol or 2% TTC in methanol, 1 N NaOH, 1:1). Fractions containing the product were pooled, evaporated, redissolved in water, and freeze-dried. The product identity was confirmed by 1H NMR: 1.36-1.70 (12H), 2.05 (3H), 3.31 (2H), and 3.52-3.56 (5H). Glycated BSA, poly-D-lysine (Mr 150,000-300,000), and poly-L-lysine (Mr 30,000-70,000) were prepared as follows: 15 mg/ml BSA, poly-D-lysine or poly-L-lysine was incubated in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) containing 1 M glucose, 1 mM DTPA, and 1 μl/ml chloroform and toluene for 5 days at 37°C. The pH was monitored during incubation and adjusted by NaOH. The solution was dialyzed three times against water and freeze-dried. Glycated aminopropyl glass (Sigma) and Spherisorb-NH2 (Phenomenex) were prepared as follows; 50 mg/ml aminopropyl glass or Spherisorb was incubated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137 mM NaCl, 2.68 mM KCl, 1.47 mM KH2PO4, 8.06 mM Na2HPO4) containing 1 M glucose, 1 mM DTPA, and 1 μl/ml chloroform and toluene for 24 h at 60°C. The suspension was filtered and intensively washed with sterile water. Nε-fructosyl Nα-t-Boc-lysine and Nα-fructosyl Nε-acetyllysine were prepared according to Finot and Mauron (21Finot P.A. Mauron J. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1969; 52: 1488-1495Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Fructosyl propylamine was prepared as follows; 30 g of glucose and 30 ml of propylamine were heated at 70°C until the sugar was dissolved. The mixture was diluted in 200 ml of isopropanol and poured into 800 ml of diethyl ether. The precipitate was filtered and dissolved in 300 ml of boiling dioxane. 20 g of oxalic acid dissolved in 200 ml of dioxane was added, and the mixture was heated for 15 min at 70°C. The precipitate was crystallized from dioxane/methanol (1:1), and oxalate was replaced by chloride by anion exchange chromatography. Fructosyl propylamine in reduced form was prepared as follows; 1.2 g of NaBH4 was added to 200 mg of fructosyl propylamine dissolved in 50 ml of water and incubated 12 h at room temperature. 1 ml of acetic acid was added to stop the reaction, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. 50 ml of methanol was added and evaporate to remove boronic acid. The residue was purified by Sephadex G-15 gel filtration column chromatography (eluent: PBS, detected with 0.2% ninhydrin in ethanol). An Aspergillus sp. strain was isolated from soil by selection on minimal medium (3 g of KH2PO4, 7 g of K2HPO4, 0.1 g of (NH4)2SO4, 1 mM MgSO4 in 100 ml), containing fructosyl adamantanamine as sole carbon source (5.5 mg/ml). Solid media containing 2 g of agar/100 ml of medium were also prepared. The microorganism was isolated by alternate growth in liquid and on solid medium. Batch cultures were grown in nutrient broth containing 1 mg/ml fructosyl propylamine. Incubation was carried out at 37°C for 3 days aerobically. To identify the reaction products, enzyme-rich fraction was prepared from Aspergillus sp. as follows. Mycel was harvested by filtration and washed by PBS. 750 mg (wet weight) of mycel was homogenized by using Potter-Elvehjem Teflon-glass homogenizer and by vortexing with 900 mg of glass beads in 300 μl of 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM EDTA, and 2 mM DTT. The homogenate was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g, and the supernatant was brought to ammonium sulfate fractionation. The precipitation between 45% and 70% of ammonium sulfate was obtained by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min, redissolved in PBS containing 1 mM EDTA and 0.2 mM PMSF and diluted to a protein concentration of 8.0 mg/ml. The reaction products were identified by TLC and GC/MS. As a control an enzyme solution was heated for 15 min at 100°C. For TLC 200 μl of the enzyme-rich fraction and 2 mg of Nε-fructosyl Nα-t-Boc-lysine or fructosyl propylamine were incubated at 37°C. After 1-4 days a sample was tested on TLC plates (eluent: n-butanol/acetic acid/water, 5:3:1, detection: 0.2% ninhydrin in ethanol or 2% TTC in methanol, 1 N NaOH, 1:1). As standards Nε-fructosyl Na-t-Boc-lysine, fructosyl propylamine, glucosone, glucose, mannose, Nα-t-Boc-lysine, and propylamine were used. For GC/MS 8 μl of enzyme-rich fraction was incubated in 1 ml of PBS containing 15 mM fructosyl propylamine and 50 mM aminoguanidine for 24 h at 37°C. The solution was filtered through a Microcon-10 (Amicon), and the filtrate was dried under vacuum (Savant, Farmingdale, NY). The residue was derivatized in 100 μl of pyridine/BtmSA (1:1) for 1 h at room temperature. Coupled gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) were performed on a Hewlett-Packard 5890 series II gas chromatograph using helium as the carrier gas (flow rate 26.3 cm/s) on an Ultra 2 capillary column (25 m, 0.2 mm (inner diamter), film thickness 0.33 μm; Hewlett-Packard). Methane was used for positive chemical ionization. Injector and interface temperatures were 270°C and 280°C, respectively. Temperature program was 100-200°C at 5°C · min−1, 200-270°C at 10°C · min−1, and isothermal at 270°C for 10 min. Glucosone triazine generously provided by Dr. Marcus Glomb was derivatized as above and used as a standard. Four different assays were developed to measure the activity of the enzyme. For purification, the enzyme activity was monitored by the release of glucosone measured by a colorimetric reaction with OPD (22Kawakishi S. Cheng R.Z. Saito S. Uchida K. Labuza T.P. Reineccius G.A. Monnier V.M. O'Brien J. Baynes J.W. Maillard Reactions in Chemistry, Food, and Health. Royal Society of Chemistry, London1994: 281-285Google Scholar) using fructosyl propylamine as a substrate. This assay is based on the end point measurement of glucosone formed after 120 min of reaction time. The reaction mixture contained 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 10 mM OPD, 10 mM fructosyl propylamine, and enzyme protein in a final volume of 1 ml. After incubation at 37°C for 2 h, the absorbance at 320 nm was measured. The reaction was linear to 240 min in a dose-dependent manner under these conditions. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of the enzyme that produces 1 μmol of glucosone/min. Synthesized glucosone was used as a standard. To assay the release of free amine, fluorescence was measured after reaction with fluorescamine. 25 μl of a solution of pure enzyme or enzyme-rich fraction, 15 μl of 20% fructosyl propylamine in water, and 250 μl of PBS were incubated at 37°C for different times as indicated. The reaction was stopped by filtration through a Microcon-10 (Amicon, Beverly, MA) at 4°C. 1 μl of the pure or 1:10 diluted filtrate was added to 1.5 ml of 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 8.0. Under vigorous vortexing 0.5 ml of 0.03% fluorescamine in dioxane was rapidly added. After 5 min fluorescence was measured (λex = 390 nm, λem = 475 nm). A standard plot was made with 6-150 ng of propylamine. Hydrogen peroxide was quantitated by the quinone dye assay according to Sakai et al (23Sakai Y. Yoshida N. Isogai A. Tani Y. Kato N. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1995; 59: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1.5 mM 4-aminoantipyrine, 2.0 mM phenol, 2.0 units of peroxidase, 10 mM fructosyl propylamine, and enzyme protein in a total volume of 1 ml. Production of the H2O2 was monitored by the formation of a quinone dye following the absorbance at 505 nm (ε = 5.13 × 103). The production of 0.5 μmol of quinone dye corresponds to the formation of 1.0 μmol of H2O2. Oxygen consumption was determined with a YSI-Beckman glucometer II equipped with a Clarke type oxygen electrode as described before (17Gerhardinger C. Marion M.S. Rovner A. Glomb M. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 218-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, enzyme (50 μl) was added to the chamber containing 750 μl of PBS and 650 μl of water. The reaction was started by addition of 50 μl of 300 mM fructosyl propylamine (final concentration 10 mM). All purification steps were carried out at 4°C. Washed mycelia (180 g as wet weight) were suspended and homogenized in 900 ml of homogenizing buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT) using a Polytron homogenizer (Kinematica, Littau, Switzerland) and Potter-Elvehjem Teflon-glass homogenizer. The homogenate was squeezed through the gauze and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min to remove unbroken cell and cell debris. The pellet was discarded, and solid ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to give 45% saturation. After stirring for 30 min, the mixture was centrifuged at 6,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was adjusted to 70% saturation by solid ammonium sulfate. After stirring for 30 min, the precipitate was obtained by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 30 min and dissolved in a minimum volume of buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT) followed by dialysis against the same buffer. Insoluble material formed was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was applied to a DEAE Sepharose column (5 × 16 cm) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed extensively with buffer A, and the bound protein was eluted with a 3000-ml linear gradient of NaCl of 0-0.2 M in the same buffer. Fractions containing enzyme activity were pooled and dialyzed against 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT and applied to a hydroxyapatite column (1.5 × 4 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. After washing the column extensively with the equilibration buffer, elution was carried out with a 140-ml linear gradient of sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, over 10-100 mM, containing 1 mM EDTA and 2 mM DTT. Fractions with enzyme activity were pooled and concentrated with an Amicon Diaflow Ultrafiltration using PM 10 membrane (Amicon), and applied to a Sephacryl S-200 column (1 × 90 cm) equilibrated with 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 2 mM DTT, and eluted with the same buffer. The enzyme-active fractions were pooled, dialyzed against buffer A, and applied onto a Mono Q column (0.5 × 5 cm) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 4 ml of buffer A, and elution was carried out with a 20-ml linear gradient of 0-0.5 M NaCl in buffer A. Fractions containing enzyme activity were used as the purified preparation of amadoriases. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215653) Google Scholar) with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit using BSA as a standard. Protein analysis by SDS-PAGE was carried out according to Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). The molecular weight of native enzyme was determined by gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-200 column equilibrated with PBS containing 2 mM DTT using molecular weight markers (Sigma). Kinetic constants were calculated from the data by least-squares linear regression analysis. pH profiles were determined over the range pH 5.8-9.5 using the following buffers: MES (pH 5.8-6.5), MOPSO (pH 6.5-7.5), POPSO (pH 7.5-8.5), and CHES (pH 8.5-9.5). Overlaps were used in all cases, and checks were made to ensure that none of the buffers were inhibitory and that the enzymes was stable during the time needed for the measurements. Isoelectric points were determined by isoelectric focusing using PhastGel IEF 5-8 (Pharmacia) and pI maker (IEF Mix 3.6-9.3, Sigma) in PhastSystem (Pharmacia). N-terminal amino acid sequencing was performed at the Molecular Biology Core laboratory (Department of Biochemistry, Case Western Reserve University) with an Applied Biosystems 477A Protein Sequencer (Foster City, CA). Soil specimens were screened for a microorganism that can degrade Amadori products by using culture media with glycated substrates as sole carbon source. In order to increase the chances that the enzyme would also have activity against glycated proteins, Amadori products were chosen with a maximal steric hindrance at the amino side. As carbon sources glycated aminopropyl glass, glycated aminopropyl silica gel, glycated poly-D-lysine, and fructosyl adamantanamine were tested, but no organism could be isolated in presence of these substrates except fructosyl adamantanamine. From the medium enriched with 5.5 mg/ml fructosyl adamantanamine, a microorganism was isolated and identified as an Aspergillus sp. strain. To ascertain the presence of Amadori product degrading activity, an extract of the fungus was produced and incubated with Nε-fructosyl Nα-t-Boc-lysine. The reaction was monitored by TLC (Fig. 1) and compared with that of the heat-inactivated extract. In the course of the incubation the amount of the Amadori product in the extract was decreasing, whereas two new spots appeared on TLC. A ninhydrin-positive spot could be identified by comparison of the RF with an authentic standard as free Nα-t-Boc-lysine. The other spot reacted with TTC and co-migrated with synthetic glucosone. In the same way, free propylamine and glucosone derived from the reaction mixture of enzyme-rich fraction and fructosyl propylamine were observed (data not shown). In order to confirm the molecular identity of the products, GC/MS analysis was performed after preparing the triazine derivatives with aminoguanidine and the trimethylsilyl derivatives with BtmSA. In the sample two major peaks appeared at retention times of 26.13 and 26.60 min, respectively (Fig. 2, top panel). The mass spectrum of both compounds showed characteristic peaks at m/z 342, 270, and 217 (Fig. 2A). A sample of authentic glucosone was derivatized in the same way with aminoguanidine and BtmSA and subjected to GC/MS analysis. The chromatogram showed peaks at 26.13 and 26.60 min for the two triazine stereomers, and the fragmentation patterns were identical to those of the degradation products (Fig. 2B). From the TLC and GC/MS data, it can be concluded that the enzyme releases glucosone and free amine from the Amadori product. Oxygen consumption during the reaction was detected polarographically using an oxygen electrode, and H2O2 generation was detected by the quinone dye assay (data not shown). Thus, all the data confirm that the Amadori product is degraded by an oxidative cleavage of the ketoamine bond, whereby oxygen is used as an electron acceptor and free amine and glucosone are released (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Proposed reaction mechanism for the formation of glucosone and H2O2 from glycated low molecular weight substrates in the presence of oxygen.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Time-course experiments on the formation of glucosone detected as quinoxaline derivative by the OPD method were carried out with an enzyme-rich fraction incubated with fructosyl propylamine (Fig. 4). The amount of glucosone formed increased in the course of the incubation and with increasing enzyme concentration, proving thereby that an enzyme was responsible for the activity. A time-dependent release of free amine could be also found by free amine assay using fluorescamine (data not shown). Since glucosone could be easily assayed by the OPD method, it was used for routine assays in the course of purification. Purification was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The extract was first fractionated by DEAE-Sepharose (Fig. 5A). Two peaks of amadoriase activity were observed. They were pooled into “pool 1” and “pool 2” and separately subjected to further purification. Fig. 5B shows the profile of the hydroxyapatite column chromatography of pool 1. Three peaks of activity were observed and purified individually by gel filtration and Mono Q column chromatography. Obtained enzymes were named amadoriase Ia, Ib, and II according to the order of elution from the hydroxyapatite column chromatography. Pool 2 was also subjected to hydroxyapatite column chromatography (Fig. 5C), and an active peak obtained was purified by gel filtration and Mono Q column chromatography. The enzyme obtained from pool 2 was named amadoriase Ic. Altogether four amadoriase enzyme fractions were isolated from Aspergillus sp. that had been selected with fructosyl adamantanamine and grown in the presence of fructosyl propylamine. The results of each purification of amadoriases are summarized in Table I. Each enzyme was purified to homogeneity as judged by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6). The apparent molecular mass of amadoriase Ia, Ib, and Ic were found to be 51 kDa, and that of amadoriase II was 49 kDa. From the results of Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration, the apparent molecular masses of native amadoriases Ia, Ib, and Ic were calculated to be 40 kDa and II was 55 kDa (data not shown). The results indicated that all four enzymes were found to be monomers.Table IPurification of amadoriases Ia, Ib, II, and IcStepTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityYieldPurificationmgmilliunitsmilliunits/mg%-foldAmadoriase IaCell extract846160,0001901001.0(NH4)2SO4370107,000290671.5DEAE-Sepharose (pool 1)13.025,20019001610.0Hydroxyapatite 1 (peak Ia)0.80308039001.920.5Gel filtration0.42185044001.223.2Mono Q0.1465947000.424.7Amadoriase IbDEAE-Sepharose (pool 1)13.025,20019001610.0Hydroxyapatite 1 (peak Ib)1.4543039003.420.5Gel filtration0.92386042002.422.1Mono Q0.42198047001.224.7Amadoriase IIDEAE-Sepharose (pool 1)13.025,20019001610.0Hydroxyapatite 1 (peak II)2.8522019003.310.0Gel filtration2.2415019002.610.0Mono Q0.46114025000.713.2Amadoriase IcDEAE-Sepharose (pool 2)10.078007804.94.1Hydroxyapatite 21.2210018001.39.5Gel filtration0.3894625000.613.2Mono Q0.1877243000.522.6 Open table in a new tab Fig. 6SDS-PAGE of purified amadoriases Ia, Ib, Ic, and II.

All four enzymes were active toward Nε-fructosyl Nα-t-Boc-lysine as well as fructosyl propylamine. However, the relative activity of amadoriases Ia, Ib, and Ic toward fructosyl adamantanamine was low compared with that for fructosyl propylamine. They had no activity against Nα-fructosyl Nε-acetyllysine. In contrast, amadoriase II was active toward fructosyl adamantanamine and Nα-fructosyl Nε-acetyllysine. None of them were active toward reduced fructosyl propylamine (10 mM), glycated BSA (2 mg/ml), glycated poly-L-lysine (0.02%) or glucose (10 mM). Apparent kinetic constants for Nε-fructosyl Nα-t-Boc-lysine and fructosyl adamantanamine are shown in Table III. The stoichiometry of the reaction catalyzed by the enzymes was determined using fructosyl propylamine as a substrate. Stoichiometric consumption of O2 and formation of H2O2 and glucosone was observed for each enzyme (data not shown).Table II.Substrate specificity of amadoriasesSubstrates (10 mM)Spe"

In previous reports, truncations at the NH2 and COOH terminus of synaptobrevin have shown that the sequence 39-88 of synaptobrevin is the minimum substrate of TeNT, suggesting either the requirement of a well defined three-dimensional structure of synaptobrevin or a role in the mechanism of substrate hydrolysis for residues distal from the cleavage site. In this study, the addition of NH2- and COOH-terminal peptides of synaptobrevin, S 27-55 (S1) and S 82-93 (S2), to the synaptobrevin fragment S 56-81 allowed the cleavage of this latter peptide by TeNT to occur. This appears to result from an activation process mediated by the simultaneous binding of S1 and S2 with complementary sites present on TeNT as shown by surface plasmon resonance experiments and the determination of kinetic constants. All these results favor an exosite-controlled hydrolysis of synaptobrevin by TeNT, probably involving a conformational change of the toxin.

We examined the effects of HGF on E-cadherin localization and interaction with β-catenin in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell monolayers grown on filters. Surface biotinylation experiments showed that HGF increases apically accessible E-cadherin. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy of HGF-treated cells showed localization of E-cadherin at membrane domains contacting the apical compartment and an increase in accessibility of apically applied antibodies to lateral E-cadherin below the tight junction. Coimmunoprecipitation of β-catenin/E-cadherin complexes showed that the amount of E-cadherin associated with β-catenin increased during the first 24 h of HGF treatment with a return to baseline values after 48 and 72 h. Metabolic labeling showed that HGF increased the synthetic rate of β-catenin and the amount of newly synthesized E-cadherin associated with immunoprecipitated β-catenin, with the peak effect occurring after 12 h of treatment and returning to baseline after 24 h.

Nakamura T. Gann Monogr. Cancer Res. 1994; 42: 91-112Google Scholar). These HGF-induced events are mediated by activation of c-met, the tyrosine kinase receptor for HGF. Two in vitro models used previously for the characterization of motogenic and morphogenic events induced by HGF use the Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cell line. In the first model, MDCK cells were grown on impermeant supports as small colonies at low density. When exposed to HGF, these cells assumed a fibroblastoid morphology and scatter away from the colonies (hence the synonym of scatter factor for HGF) (2Stoker M. Gherardi E. Perryman M. Gray J. Nature. 1987; 327: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar, 3Weidner K.M. Behrens J. Vandekerckhove J. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2097-2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). In the second model, MDCK cells were grown as hollow cysts in type I collagen gels. When exposed to HGF, they formed complex branching tubules extending out from the cysts, mimicking the normal branching tubule morphogenesis that occurs during the development of many epithelial organs (4Rodriguez-Boulan E. Nelson W.J. Science. 1989; 245: 718-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar, 5Crepaldi T. Pollack A.L. Prat M. Zborek A. Mostov K. Comoglio P.M. J.

To analyze directly the effects of HGF on polarized epithelial cell functions that may be important for epithelial cell rearrangements during HGF-induced morphogenesis and motogenesis, we tested the effects of HGF on MDCK cells cultured on permeable supports. MDCK cells cultured on permeable filter supports form well polarized monolayers with apical and basolateral membrane domains separated by a functional tight junction belt (4Rodriguez-Boulan E. Nelson W.J. Science. 1989; 245: 718-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). This widely used model allows for apical and basolateral surface domain-specific techniques such as surface biotinylation, surface immunolabeling, and surface immunoprecipitation to study cell surface polarity. In epithelial cells, the response to HGF and cell polarity are interdependent. For example, in polarized MDCK cells, the HGF receptor, c-met, is localized to the basolateral cell surface (5Crepaldi T. Pollack A.L. Prat M. Zborek A. Mostov K. Comoglio P.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and cells respond to basolateral but not apical HGF. 2A. L. Pollack and K. E. Mostov, unpublished observations. However, epithelial cells that are less well polarized, such as MDCK cells cultured on plastic, scatter in response to HGF in the apical medium and acquire a fibroblastic morphology (2Stoker M. Gherardi E. Perryman M. Gray J. Nature. 1987; 327: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar, 3Weidner K.M. Behrens J. Vandekerckhove J. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2097-2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the permeable filter support model system would be useful for characterizing HGF-induced effects on epithelial cell polarity that might provide insight into more complex HGF-induced epithelial morphogenetic events such as tubulogenesis, organ development, and tissue repair. These morphogenetic events are likely to involve complex changes in cell-cell interactions. E-cadherin is a 120-kDa transmembrane protein that is primarily responsible for homotypic adhesion between adjacent epithelial cells (6Takeichi M. Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2989) Google Scholar). In well polarized epithelia, E-cadherin is localized to the basolateral membrane below the tight junction, and the extracellular domain of E-cadherin is, therefore, inaccessible from the apical environment. E-cadherin activity is necessary to maintain the adherens junctions, which are characteristic of polarized epithelial cells, as well as for the activity of other intracellular junctions including zonula occludins (tight junctions) and desmosomes (7Gumbiner B. Stevenson B. Grimaldi A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1575-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). E-cadherin is also believed to play a critical role in morphogenetic events through the regulation of cell-cell adhesion (8Takeichi M. Hatta K. Nose A. Nagafuchi A. Matsunaga M. Ciba Found. Symp. 1989; 144: 243-249PubMed Google Scholar, 9Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2943) Google Scholar). To exhibit functional activity, E-cadherin forms complexes with cytosolic proteins called catenins (α, β, and γ), which link E-cadherin to the actin cytoskeleton (10Kemler R. Ozawa M. Bioessays. 1989; 11: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 11Gumbiner B.M. McCrea P.D. J. Cell Sci. Suppl. 1993; 17: 155-158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). β- and γ-catenin are homologous to armadillo, a Drosophila segment polarity gene (12Peifer M. McCrea P.D. Green K.J. Wieschaus E. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 681-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Both of these catenins have been shown to modulate cell-cell adhesion (13Hinck L. Nelson W.J. Papkoff J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 14Bradley R.S. Cowin P. Brown A.M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1857-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). α-Catenin is involved in linking membrane proteins to the cortical cytoskeleton at sites of cell-cell contact and is also required for cell adhesion (15Hirano S. Kimoto N. Shimoyama Y. Hirohashi S. Takeichi M. Cell. 1992; 70: 293-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 16Knudsen K.A. Soler A.P. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Because of the importance of E-cadherin in epithelial structure and its suspected role in morphogenesis, we have now studied the effect of the HGF on E-cadherin localization and interaction with β-catenin in polarized MDCK cells grown on permeable filter supports. MDCK type II cells as well as MDCK type II cells expressing the transfected rabbit polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) were grown in MEM containing Earle's balanced salt solution (Cellgro, Mediatech, Inc., Washington, DC) supplemented with 5+ fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B in 5+ CO2/95+ air at 37°C. Cells grown on Transwells (Costar, Cambridge, MA) were seeded at confluency. Cell monolayers were used for experiments after 3 days of culture with daily media change. Hybridoma cells secreting mouse anti-E-cadherin mAb (rr1), which recognizes an extracellular epitope, were a kind gift from B. Gumbiner (Sloan Kettering, New York, NY)(17). Rat mAb R40.76 against ZO-1, a peripheral membrane protein associated with the cytoplasmic aspect of tight junctions (18Stevenson B.R. Siliciano J.D. Mooseker M.S. Goodenough D.A. J.

Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1141-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), was obtained from B. Stevenson (University of Alberta). Mouse mAb against β-catenin was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Secondary antibodies for immunofluorescence were goat anti-mouse-fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate and goat anti-rat-Texas Red from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Recombinant human HGF was generously provided by R. Schwall (Genentech, South San Francisco, CA). Biotinylation of MDCK cells grown on Transwells was performed essentially as described previously (5Crepaldi T. Pollack A.L. Prat M. Zborek A. Mostov K. Comoglio P.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed thoroughly with ice-cold Hank's balanced salt solution, pH 7.4, and the apical or basolateral cell surface was then derivatized twice for 15 min at 4°C using a sulfonated N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of biotin (Sulfo-NHS-Biotin; Pierce) (0.5 mg/ml in Hank's balanced salt solution). The reaction was quenched by washing three times with ice-cold MEM, containing Hank's balanced salts, 0.6+ BSA, and 20 mM HEPES (MEM/BSA), pH 7.3. Cells were then lysed, and the appropriate protein was immunoprecipitated as described below. MDCK cells grown on 24-mm Transwells with or without HGF treatment were rinsed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing Mg2+ and Ca2+ (PBS+) at 4°C. Filters were cut from their support and placed in 0.8 ml of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1+ SDS, 1+ TX-100, 1+ droxycholic acid, and 5 mM EDTA (RIPA buffer) containing inhibitors of proteases (2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml pepstatin, 50 μg/ml chymostatin, and 10 μg/ml antipain) for 15 min on ice. Protein concentration of cell lysates was determined by using a Pierce BCA kit. Cell lysates were rotated 1.0 h at 4°C with E-cadherin mAb (rr1 hybridoma conditioned media) or β-catenin mAb. Immunocomplexes were collected with affinity-purified rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs, Inc., West Grove, PA) coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads. Immunoprecipitate beads were washed three times with RIPA buffer, one time with 140 mM NaCl, 20 mM tetraethylammonia chloride, pH 8.6, 5 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.1+ Trasylol, and 0.02+ NaN3 (final wash buffer), and samples were eluted by boiling in Laemmli buffer containing 100 mM dithiothreitol. Cells were cultured on Transwell filters and cooled to 4°C in MEM/BSA and exposed to apical or basolateral rr1 conditioned media for 1 h. After this incubation, cells were quickly washed three times at 4°C with PBS+ and lysed in RIPA buffer as described in the immunoprecipitation protocol. Immunoprecipitates were electrophoresed on 8+ SDS-PAGE minigels and transferred to Immobilon P filters (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Filters containing biotinylated samples were blocked at room temperature for 60 min with 1 M glucose, 10+ glycerol, and 0.5+ Tween 20 solution (TGG) containing 3+ BSA and 1+ milk. The filter was then washed two times with PBS− containing 0.5+ Tween 20 and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase diluted 1:1000 in TGG and 0.3+ BSA. Filters were washed five times for 15 min each with PBS− containing 0.5+ Tween 20. Nonbiotinylated filter samples were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with PBS−, 5+ milk, and 0.1+ Tween 20 (block solution) and probed with mAb rr1 conditioned media diluted 1:2 in block solution or mAb β-catenin diluted 1:5000 in block solution. The filters were washed five times for 5 min each with PBS−, 0.1+ Tween 20 (wash solution), and probed with goat-anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase diluted 1:30,000 in block solution for 1 h. Filters were washed five times for 5 min each with wash solution. All filters were visualized on Kodak X-OMAT AR film with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Amersham Corp.). Autoradiographs were scanned and saved as Adobe Photoshop files with a UMAX PowerLook II scanner. Densitometry was performed using NIH Image Version 1.60 (NIH Image is in the public domain). MDCK cells grown on 6-mm Transwell filters were fixed with paraformaldehye. Cells were fixed with ice-cold 4+ paraformaldehyde in PBS+ for 20 min. After washing the filters three times with PBS+, the cells were quenched with 75 mM NH4Cl and 20 mM glycine, pH 8.0, with KOH (quench solution) for 10 min at room temperature. Filters were washed one time with PBS+ and permeabilized with PBS+, 0.7+ fish skin gelatin, and 0.025+ saponin (PFS) for 15 min at 37°C. Filters were labeled with rr1 or ZO-1 mAb diluted in PFS 1:2 and 1:100, respectively, for 1 h at 37°C. Filters were then washed four times for 5 min each with PFS at room temperature and then labeled with the appropriate secondary Ab diluted 1:100 in PFS for 1 h at 37°C. Filters were rinsed four times for 5 min each with PFS, one time with PBS+, 2 times with PBS+ containing 0.1+ TX-100, and one time with PBS+. Cells were postfixed in 4+ paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Filters were cut from the support with a scalpel and mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Burlingame, CA). For surface fluorescence labeling, the living cells were cooled to 4°C on ice and exposed to rr1-conditioned media from the apical or basolateral surface for 1 h at 4°C. The filters were then washed three times with ice-cold PBS+ and subjected to fixation and fluorescent labeling as described above. The samples were analyzed using a krypton-argon laser coupled with a Bio-Rad MRC1000 confocal head, attached to an Optiphot II Nikon microscope with a Plan Apo 60 × 1.4 NA objective lens. The samples were scanned individually or simultaneously for fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate or Texas Red with excitation/emission wavelengths of 488/520 and 568/615, respectively. The data were analyzed using Comos software. Images were converted to tagged information file format (TIFF), and contrast levels of the images were adjusted by using the Photoshop program (Adobe Co., Mountain View, CA) on a Power Macintosh 9500 (Apple, Cupertino, CA). Conventional immunofluorescent images were obtained with a Leitz microscope equipped with a 35-mm camera. The Leitz microscope generated photomicrographs were converted to TIFF images with a Polaroid SprintScan 35/ES. Filter-grown cells were starved in MEM lacking cysteine and methionine (obtained from UCSF Cell Culture Facility and supplemented with 5+ fetal bovine serum for 20 min, then pulse-labeled for 15 min in the same medium supplemented with [35S]cysteine and [35S]methionine (250 μCi/ml Tran35Slabel, ICN Biochemicals, Irvine, CA) as described previously (20Hinck L. Nathke I.S. Papkoff J. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1327-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). 35S incorporation into immunoprecipitated proteins was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and quantitated with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Transcytosis of dimeric immunoglobulin A (dIgA) assays were performed as described previously (21Casanova J.E. Breitfeld P.P. Ross S.A. Mostov K.E.

The paired two-sample for means t test was used to determine the probability (p) that the sample means are equal. A p ≤ 0.025 was considered to be significant. Statistical analyses were carried out with Microsoft EXCEL version 5.0a (Microsoft Corp.). In polarized epithelia, E-cadherin is basolaterally localized and, therefore, is not accessible to reagents in the apical environment that cannot cross the tight junction. Because E-cadherin function is important in cell-cell adhesion during development, we hypothesized that E-cadherin localization is altered during HGF-induced morphogenetic events. We, therefore, examined the effect of HGF treatment on the localization of E-cadherin in polarized MDCK cell monolayers grown on filters by domain-selective surface biotinylation. Cells were plated at confluency on 24-mm Transwell filters and cultured for 3 days with daily media changes before introducing recombinant human HGF at a concentration of 100 ng/ml into the basolateral compartment. After treatment for 24 h, apical or basolateral membrane domains were surface biotinylated, and cell membrane proteins were solubilized in RIPA buffer. E-cadherin in the total cell lysates from individual filters was immunoprecipitated with anti E-cadherin mAb rr1. Biotinylated E-cadherin was detected on immunoprecipitate blots by probing with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase and developed using ECL. The results are shown in Fig. 1 and demonstrate that HGF treatment increased apically exposed, biotin-derivatized E-cadherin. Total E-cadherin exposed at the basolateral surface was also increased, but to a lesser degree, and is likely due to a total increase in lateral membrane domain E-cadherin induced by HGF (see below). Because HGF elicits its biological effect by stimulation of c-met, a receptor tyrosine kinase, we also examined the effect of another tyrosine kinase agonist, epidermal growth factor. Whereas epidermal growth factor also increased total basolateral biotinylated E-cadherin, there was no effect on the amount of apically exposed, biotinylated E-cadherin (Fig. 1). Thus, the increase in apically biotinylated E-cadherin is specific to stimulation by HGF and is not due to nonspecific receptor tyrosine kinase activation. To visually characterize the HGF-induced, apically accessible E-cadherin, we added the anti-E-cadherin mAb rr1 to either the apical or basolateral surface of live cells at 4°C and detected binding of this antibody by immunofluorescence microscopy. The results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 2. In non-HGF-treated control cells (Fig. 2a), basolaterally applied rr1 clearly labeled E-cadherin, whereas apically applied rr1 failed to label E-cadherin. These findings confirm that under control conditions, the MDCK cell monolayer has competent tight junctions that exclude diffusion of rr1 from the apical compartment to the basolateral compartment. In contrast, cells treated for 24 h with HGF (Fig. 2b) showed an increase (2-3+ of the total number of cells) in labeling by apically applied rr1 of discrete patches of membrane at the lateral borders of individual cells of the monolayer. When viewed in the x-y axis (i.e. a section parallel to the plane of the filter), the apically accessible E-cadherin appeared to be in the lateral domain. Confocal microscopy allowed us to reconstruct x-z section views (i.e. perpendicular to the plane of the filter) of the apically accessible E-cadherin (Fig. 2c′) and the tight junction marker ZO-1 (Fig. 2c). After 24 h of HGF treatment, apically accessible E-cadherin was detected below the tight junction. Fig. 3 shows that with extended exposures to HGF, an increasing percentage of cells expressed E-cadherin, which was accessible from the apical compartment for surface immunolabeling. Fig. 3 was taken with a conventional fluorescence microscope, because it allowed a slightly different and informative overview of the distribution of apically accessible E-cadherin in this case. After 48 h of HGF exposure, approximately 15-20+ of the cells expressed apically accessible E-cadherin, whereas after 72 h of HGF exposure, 30-40+ of the cells expressed apically accessible E-cadherin. Confocal microscopy x-z section views shown in Fig. 4 of control and 48- or 72-h HGF-treated cells were co-stained for ZO-1 (Fig. 4) and either apically accessible E-cadherin (Fig. 4, b, c, and e) or basolaterally accessible E-cadherin (Fig. 4, a and d). These pictures showed that in addition to increasing access through the tight junction to E-cadherin in lateral membranes below the tight junction, the longer periods of HGF exposure (Fig. 4, c, 48 h and e, 72 h) also induced mislocalization of E-cadherin to membrane domains above the tight junction that are in direct contact with the apical compartment. The images of basolaterally accessible E-cadherin for control (Fig. 4a) and 72 h of HGF treatment (Fig. 4d) demonstrate that HGF treatment induced other morphological changes, i.e. increased thickness of the monolayer and more tortuous interrelationships between adjacent cells (increased lateral membrane surface). E-cadherin functional activity is dependent upon association with catenins. β-Catenin represents an important link between epidermal growth factor-induced signal transduction and cadherin function (22Hoschuetzky H. Aberle H. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1375-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). We, therefore, examined the effect of HGF on the association of E-cadherin with immunoprecipitated β-catenin. Fig. 5A shows that during HGF treatment, the amount of E-cadherin associated with immunoprecipitated β-catenin increased over a 24-h period (at 24 h, the amount was 313 ± 5.7+ (p = 0.0008)). Fig. 5B shows the amount of E-cadherin associated with immunoprecipitated β-catenin after 24, 48, and 72 h of HGF treatment. Again, E-cadherin associated with β-catenin is increased after 24 h of HGF treatment, but after 48 or 72 h of HGF treatment, this amount returned to approximately baseline. A slight increase in the amount of total immunoprecipitated β-catenin is detectable after HGF treatment (at 48 h, the amount was 115 ± 12+ of control) but is not statistically significant (data not shown). These results demonstrate that HGF modulates E-cadherin and β-catenin interaction during morphogenetic events. Because the previous experiments provided evidence that HGF increased the amount of E-cadherin associated with β-catenin in MDCK cells and, to a lesser extent, the amount of β-catenin, we examined the effect of HGF treatment on the biosynthetic rates of β-catenin and E-cadherin associated with β-catenin. (We did not examine the biosynthesis of total E-cadherin for technical reasons.) Polarized monolayers of MDCK cells were treated with HGF for 1, 3, 6, 12, or 24 h and pulse-labeled with [35S]cysteine and [35S]methionine for 15 min, and cell lysates were immediately collected. Equal amounts of RIPA buffer solubilized protein were subjected to immunoprecipitation by β-catenin mAb. Amounts of newly synthesized E-cadherin and β-catenin in the immunoprecipitates were quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. The results (Fig. 6) show that HGF treatment of polarized MDCK cells increased the synthetic rates of β-catenin and E-cadherin found in the β-catenin immunoprecipitates. The peak effect on synthesis was observed at approximately 12 h (p < 0.003 for both E-cadherin and β-catenin) and returned to near baseline by 24 h. These results demonstrate that HGF increases the relative rate of β-catenin synthesis. Moreover, HGF also increases the amount of newly synthesized E-cadherin molecules found in β-catenin complexes. This observation suggests that HGF is stimulating the rate of E-cadherin synthesis and/or the rate at which E-cadherin interacts with new and existing pools of β-catenin. The β-catenin immunoprecipitation results demonstrate that HGF modulates the amount of E-cadherin associated with β-catenin. To determine if β-catenin is associated with HGF-induced apically accessible E-cadherin, control cultures and cells treated with HGF for 24 or 48 h were subjected to apical and basolateral surface immunoprecipitation with rr1. Amounts of β-catenin associated in the immunoprecipitate complexes were determined by Western blot. Fig. 7 shows the results of such an experiment, from which we can draw the following conclusions: (a) these results confirmed that HGF increased the amount of apically accessible E-cadherin. However, this population of E-cadherin was not well visualized until 48 h of treatment, suggesting that this method is not as sensitive as surface biotinylation and surface immunofluorescence labeling; (b) these results demonstrated that both the apically and basolaterally accessible E-cadherin are associated with β-catenin. Because this protocol did not effectively immunoprecipitate apically accessible E-cadherin at 24 h, the time period in which increasing amounts of E-cadherin are associated with β-catenin, we cannot absolutely rule out changes in β-catenin associated with apically accessible E-cadherin at this time point; (c) the results show that HGF induced an increase in E-cadherin/β-catenin complexes at the basolaterally accessible cell surface, consistent with the observation of increased lateral membrane surface area (Fig. 4). The HGF-induced increase in apically accessible E-cadherin suggests a significant change in cell polarity. In a preliminary attempt to gain insight into the effects of HGF on polarized membrane traffic, we examined the effect of 48-h HGF treatment on the transcytosis of iodinated dIgA by MDCK cells expressing the rabbit pIgR. Under normal conditions, these cells exhibit functional polarity by trancytosing dIgA from the basolateral to the apical compartment, although a small fraction of the dIgA recycles to the basolateral compartment. Fig. 8 illustrates the results of such an experiment. HGF treatment of the pIgR-expressing MDCK monolayers significantly inhibited the basolateral to apical transcytosis of 125I-labeled dIgA but did not influence basolateral recycling. To a lesser degree, a similar pattern of transcytosis inhibition was observed after 24 h of HGF treatment (data not shown). These results suggest that HGF alters the polarity of filter-grown MDCK cells, at least in part, by changing the polarized membrane traffic. Our results provide evidence that HGF treatment of polarized MDCK cell monolayers grown on filters induced morphological changes, including an increase in apically accessible E-cadherin. The mechanism by which this occurs appears to be through localization of E-cadherin to the membrane domain in contact with the apical compartment and modulation of tight junction integrity. HGF treatment also modulated the association of E-cadherin with immunoprecipitated β-catenin and stimulated the de novo synthesis rates of β-catenin. In addition to altering the polarity of MDCK cell monolayers, HGF also altered polarized membrane traffic, as determined by the transcytosis of dIgA by the pIgR. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that this model of HGF treatment of polarized MDCK cells grown on filters provides a system by which complicated morphogenetic events in polarized cells can be dissected with regard to structural, biochemical, and functional polarity. This model will serve in the understanding of more complex processes, including the loss of polarity in disease processes such as carcinomas (23Fish E.M. Molitoris B.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 330: 1580-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), regaining epithelial polarity in tissue regeneration following injuries such as acute tubular necrosis (24Kawaida K. Matsumoto K. Shimazu H. Nakamura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4357-4361Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), and epithelial morphogenesis in normal and abnormal (e.g. polycystic kidney disease) development of the kidney (25Carone F.A. Nakamura S. Bacallao R. Nelson W.J. Khokha M. Kanwar Y.S. Kidney Int. 1995; 47: 861-868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The importance of E-cadherin in epithelial morphogenetic events is not restricted to mammalian systems. Recently, two groups simultaneously reported that the Drosophila gene shotgun that encodes the first classic cadherin isolated from invertebrates plays a crucial role in the developing Drosophila embryo (26Uemura T. Oda H. Kraut R. Hayashi S. Kotaoka Y. Takeichi M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 27Tepass U. Gruszynski-DeFeo E. Haag T.A. Omatyar L. Torok T. Hartenstein V. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 672-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Their results seem congruent with ours, in that they found that the continued zygotic expression of the Drosophila cadherin is required for epithelial cell rearrangement during morphogenesis. This suggests that our observed increase in the expression of E-cadherin in MDCK cells exposed to HGF may similarly be important for morphogenesis in mammalian epithelia. The Drosophila cadherin also interacts with catenins, and it is likely that these interactions are also modulated during invertebrate morphogenetic events such as embryonic development. Evidence supporting this hypothesis has been reported by two groups, demonstrating the requirement of the Drosophila β-catenin homolog Armadillo for the formation of Drosophila adherens junction and epithelial polarity (28Cox R. Kirkpatrick C. Peifer M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 29Muller H.-A.J. Wieschaus E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 149-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). By inducing localization of E-cadherin to the membrane domain facing the apical compartment and increasing apical accessibility via tight junctions, HGF decreases the degree of polarization in previously well polarized MDCK cells. Because alterations in epithelial polarity are associated with pathologic states such as carcinoma (23Fish E.M. Molitoris B.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 330: 1580-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), this model has potential in the characterization of cellular events during carcinoma induction. Recently, it was shown that estrogen activated c-JunER protein-induced loss of epithelial polarity, a disruption of intercellular junctions, and the formation of irregular multilayers in mammary epithelial cells (30Fialka I. Schwarz H. Reichmann E. Oft M. Busslinger M. Beug H. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1115-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The authors of this paper suggested that these processes may be important for both normal breast development and as initiating steps in the induction of breast carcinogenesis. Epithelial invasiveness is associated with down-regulation of E-cadherin amounts (31Schipper J.H. Frixen U.H. Behrens J. Unger A. Jahnke K. Birchmeier W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6328-6337PubMed Google Scholar, 32Shiozaki H. Tahara H. Oka H. Miyata M. Kobayashi K. Tamura S. Iihara K. Doki Y. Hirano S. Takeichi M. Mori T. Am. J. Path. 1991; 139: 17-23PubMed Google Scholar); however, the present findings showed an increase in apparent amounts of apical and basolateral E-cadherin by HGF treatment. This finding, coupled to the loss of epithelial polarity, raises the possibility of E-cadherin dysfunction in the present model and/or suggests that under certain conditions, epithelia can lose functional and structural polarity (a phenotype seen in carcinomas) with a paradoxical increase in E-cadherin amounts. HGF also reduces transcytosis of the pIgR (33Apodaca G. Bomsel M. Arden J. Breitfeld P.P. Tang K. Mostov K.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1877-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Basolateral recycling of dIgA by the pIgR was not affected by HGF treatment, suggesting that HGF treatment specifically alters the machinery necessary for efficient basolateral to apical translocation of dIgA. We do not know if this is due simply to the increased distance that the pIgR and dIgA must travel across the thicker monolayer. This result is intriguing because transcytosis to the apical surface is an essential mechanism by which epithelial polarity is established and maintained, particularly during the early steps in development of the polarized phenotype (34Zurzolo C. Le Bivic A. Quaroni A. Nitsch L. Rodriguez-Boulan E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2337-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Clearly, HGF affects the basic mechanisms of membrane traffic involved in the development of polarity. Treatment of polarized MDCK cells with HGF increased the amount of E-cadherin associated with immunoprecipitated β-catenin during the first 24 h of exposure with a return to baseline levels at 48 and 72 h of HGF treatment. Thus, HGF altered β-catenin protein interactions with E-cadherin in MDCK cells grown on filters. It should be noted that at 24 h, there is only a very small amount of apically accessible E-cadherin, which does not become prominent until 48-72 h. Therefore, the response to HGF can be viewed as having two phases: 1) an early phase that peaks at 24 h and is characterized primarily by an increase in the amount of E-cadherin associated with β-catenin; and 2) a late phase that peaks at 48-72 h and is characterized by the return of both β-catenin synthetic rate and association between β-catenin and E-cadherin to baseline levels, and a large amount of apically accessible E-cadherin. Assembly of E-cadherin/β-catenin complexes in polarized MDCK cells is a dynamic process (20Hinck L. Nathke I.S. Papkoff J. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1327-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) involving existing and newly synthesized components. Therefore, it is possible that HGF modifies this assembly process either through alteration in cadherin and catenin synthetic rates and/or modification of existing cadherins and catenins. We observed that HGF increases the relative rate of β-catenin synthesis. Moreover, HGF also increases the amount of newly synthesized E-cadherin molecules found in β-catenin complexes. This observation suggests that HGF is stimulating the rate of E-cadherin synthesis and/or the rate at which E-cadherin interacts with new and existing pools of β-catenin. Weidner et al. (3Weidner K.M. Behrens J. Vandekerckhove J. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2097-2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar) reported that HGF treatment does not increase E-cadherin synthesis. However, in that study, the MDCK cells were grown nonconfluently on impermeant supports, and E-cadherin synthesis was measured between 17 and 20 h of HGF treatment, a time when effects of HGF on synthesis rates of E-cadherin may have already declined to near baseline. In human carcinoma cells, HGF has been shown to modulate the function of the cadherin-catenin system via tyrosine phosphorylation of cadherin-associated proteins, including β-catenin (35Shibamoto S. Hayakawa M. Takeuchi K. Hori T. Oku N. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. Takeichi M. Ito F. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1994; 1: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin may play an important role in modulation of the E-cadherin/β-catenin complex assembly and composition in the HGF-treated MDCK monolayers and will be a subject for future investigation.

INTRODUCTIONCalmodulin is involved in the regulation of a range of cellular functions, usually through its Ca2+-dependent activation of target proteins (1Klee C.B. Cohen P. Klee C.B. Calmodulin. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1988: 33-56Google Scholar).

Those in the C-domain have a higher affinity than those in the N-domain, and there is positive cooperativity between two sites within a domain (5Linse S. Helmersson A. Forsén S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8050-8054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure shows the two domains separated by an extended α-helix. In solution, this central helix contains a loop (residues 74-82) which allows the calmodulin domains to interact closely with the peptide (6Barbato G. Ikura M. Kay L.E. Pastor R.W. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5269-5278Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar).Calcium binding to calmodulin induces a conformational change that exposes hydrophobic surfaces which comprise the binding site for target molecules. The solution structure of the complex of Ca4-CaM with M13, a 26-residue peptide derived from sk-MLCK, has been determined by NMR (7Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). The M13 peptide is in an α-helical conformation, effectively enclosed by the N- and C-domains of the calmodulin. The N and C termini of the peptide interact primarily with the C- and N-domains of calmodulin, respectively, and the Trp-4 and Phe-17 residues of the peptide appear to play an important anchoring role. The structures of the complexes of Ca4-CaM with peptides derived from sm-MLCK and CaM kinase II have been determined by x-ray diffraction (8Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1992; 257: 1251-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar, 9Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1993; 262: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). The structures of the three complexes are rather similar, although there are significant differences in the positions of the peptides and the relative orientations of the calmodulin domains. In particular, the complex of Ca4-CaM with the CaM kinase II peptide has fewer peptide residues involved in helix formation and contact with the calmodulin, and the longer loop in the central helix region (residues 73-83) allows the domains to move closer together (9Meador W.E.

The different structures show how calmodulin can adapt to bind peptides of different sequences, while maintaining high affinity in the interaction.In recent work we studied the peptide WFF, which corresponds to residues 1-18 of M13 and contains the major sites of interaction with CaM (7Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). We have also permuted the sequence of WFF to include either Trp or Phe residues at positions 4, 8, and 17 (peptides FWF, FFW, and FFF: Table I). These peptides bind with high affinity to Ca4-CaM and retain the standard orientation with residues 4 and 17 interacting with CaM C- and N-domains, respectively (10Findlay W.A. Martin S.R.

The effects of Ca2+ removal with a chelator were monitored using different fluorescent signals, including those of the chelator Quin2, peptide Trp, CaM Tyr (Tyr-138 in Drosophila CaM), and a Trp-containing calmodulin mutant, T26W (16Chabbert M.

We show that the predominant kinetic pathway is sensitive to changes in individual residues of the target peptides and deduce that the rate of the slowest step is determined by the contribution of a hitherto unsuspected kinetic relaxation mechanism involving the intermediate species Ca2-CaM·peptide, with two Ca2+ ions bound in the C-domain.RESULTSAssociation of Ca4CaM and PeptideFluorescence changes on mixing of WFF, FFW, or FWF (0.4 μM) with excess Ca4-CaM (at 20°C) were almost complete within the instrument deadtime, indicating a bimolecular association rate constant (kon) in excess of 8 × 108M−1 s−1. We therefore studied the association of FWF (0.4 μM) with Ca4-CaM (0.4 μM) at 9.5°C (Fig. 1D). The kon value obtained as described under “Materials and Methods” was 1 ± 0.5 × 109M−1 s−1. This is similar to a value of 9 × 108M−1 s−1 found for the reaction of a fluorescently labeled CaM with two peptides derived from sm-MLCK (22Török K. Trentham D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12807-12820Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and to a value of 2 × 109M−1 s−1 deduced from NMR studies on a peptide derived from Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase (30Craescu C.T.

These on-rates are close to the expected diffusion limit of 2 × 109M−1 s−1 (31Eigen M. Hammes G.G. Methods Enzymol. 1963; 25: 1-38Google Scholar, 32Rosenberry T.L. Neumann E.

Although slow processes attributed to conformational changes have been observed in studies of the association of fluorescently labeled CaMs with peptides and proteins (22Török K. Trentham D.R.

Values of kon for the interaction of CaM with proteins tend to be lower (20Kasturi R. Vasulka C. Johnson J.D. J. Biol.

The rates observed for T26W SYNCAM are two to three times faster than those for wild-type Drosophila CaM (Table II) and are somewhat faster than the value of 14 s−1 reported for SYNCAM (37Haiech J.

We note, however, that the slow phase rate observed with T26W only corresponds to some 5% of the total amplitude; the major signal change reflects dissociation of the N-terminal Ca2+ ions. These small differences may be due to sequence differences between the proteins (38Roberts D.M. Crea R. Malecha M. Alvarado-Urbina G. Chiarello R.H. Watterson D.M.

Open table in a new tab Dissociation of Ca4-CaM·Peptide ComplexesFig. 1 shows typical traces for the dissociation of the CaM complexes of the peptides WFF, FFF, and MasX induced by excess chelator. A-C of Fig. 1 are representative of the range of kinetic behavior observed. The complexes clearly show diverse properties, when compared with one another for a given optical parameter or when compared for different optical parameters for the same complex. The results in Table II show rates and relative amplitudes for the complexes studied. Full discussion of these results requires a consideration of possible mechanisms (see “The Kinetic Model”). However, some generalizations can usefully be made here.The rates observed with the complexes and Quin2 (Table II) are frequently biphasic, with a fast rate of 5-100 s−1 and a slow rate of 0.5-5 s−1. The total amplitude corresponds to four Ca2+ ions. The rates are markedly slower than those observed with CaM alone, where fast and slow rates clearly correspond to dissociation from N- and C-domains, respectively (27Bayley P.M. Ahlström P. Martin S.R. Forsén S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The presence of peptide enhances the affinity of both N- and C-domain Ca2+ sites (see “The Kinetic Model”), and this assignment of the faster rate from the N-domain is evidently retained in the presence of peptide. By contrast, for FFW and FFF the Quin2 signals were monophasic, with a small lag phase in the case of Ca4-CaM·FFF (Fig. 1B). In this case it appears that a distinction between the N- and C-domain properties cannot be made.For those cases showing biphasic Quin2 signals, the EGTA-induced dissociation of the complexes with the Trp-containing peptides also shows biphasic character, with the greater amplitude in the slow phase. The existence of the fast phase in the Trp signal in the case of WFF and FWF is an important observation, with mechanistic significance (see “The Relaxation Step: Experimental Justification”). It raises questions of the fluorescence properties of intermediate species and, more fundamentally, of the effects of coupling individual kinetic steps with different optical parameters. The biphasic kinetics observed in the EGTA dissociation of CaM·MasX is clearly exceptional, since (Fig. 1C) there is an intermediate species of enhanced fluorescence and the two kinetic components are oppositely signed.The EGTA-induced dissociation of complexes of non-Trp-containing peptides with CaM shows a single phase, usually in the slow range, consistent with the origins of this signal at Tyr-138 in the C-domain of CaM. The EGTA-induced dissociation of Ca4-CaM·FFF shows a lag phase, evidencing the sequential nature of the process.The T26W mutant was used with all peptides, since it has a significant fluorescent change when Ca2+ dissociates from the N-domain. In general, biphasic and monophasic behavior follow the Quin2 signals for all complexes (except CaM·Mas and CaM·CBP1). The rates are generally similar although CaM·MasX again appears exceptional. The relative amplitudes of biphasic transients are however different, with the fast phase predominating, consistent with the involvement of the N-domain. The signal in the case of complexes of T26W with Trp-containing peptides is composite, with similar contributions from the loss of Ca2+ from the N-domain and the change due to complete dissociation of the peptide. These two contributions overlap and cannot readily be resolved.There is no obvious relationship between the observed rates and the affinities of the peptides for Ca4-CaM. Thus, for example, EGTA-induced dissociation rates for complexes with Mas or CBP1 are similar, even though the affinity of CBP1 for Ca4-CaM is 2 orders of magnitude higher than that for Mas. Clearly the reactions studied here involve the eventual dissociation of both Ca2+ and peptide from the initial complex, whereas the peptide affinities reflect only the association/dissociation reaction of the peptide from the complex with Ca4-CaM. Thus, the pathway for the chelator-induced dissociation of the peptide appears to be under kinetic, rather than thermodynamic, control. Taken together, the results indicate that the dissociation mechanism is a complex multi-step pathway, with observed rates resulting from the coupling of individual kinetic steps.The Kinetic ModelThe purpose of the kinetic model is to account for the reduction in the Ca2+ dissociation rates from CaM in the presence of peptides and to identify steps in the pathway where differences in the peptides produce significant kinetic effects. The complete kinetic scheme for the dissociation of Ca2+ and peptide from a Ca4-CaM·peptide complex becomes unduly complex if the four Ca2+ ions are considered to dissociate independently. It is reasonable, however, based on extensive experimental evidence for the dissociation kinetics of Ca4-CaM, to consider the Ca2+ ions as dissociating in pairs, one pair from each domain (34Martin S.R. Andersson Teleman A. Bayley P.M. Drakenberg T. Forsén S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This assumption results in the Ca2+ dissociation scheme shown in Fig. 2A, where C represents CaM and the subscripts P, N, and C represent peptide, and the N- and C-terminal Ca2+ pairs, respectively. Therefore, for example, CNCP represents the full Ca4-CaM·peptide complex, and C−CP represents the Ca2-CaM·peptide complex with 2 Ca2+ in the C-domain.Fig. 2Formal kinetic scheme for dissociation of a Ca4-CaM·peptide complex, assuming that the Ca2+ ions dissociate in pairs. C represents CaM and the subscripts P, N, and C represent peptide, N- and C-terminal Ca2+ pairs, respectively. a, full scheme; b, simplified scheme and rate constants used in the simulations. All steps involving Ca2+ dissociation are assumed to be irreversible (see “Materials and Methods”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)This kinetic scheme can be simplified given knowledge of the properties of CaM itself. As shown in Fig. 2A, step 2 of the path involves peptide dissociation from CNCP to produce the species CNC− (i.e. Ca4-CaM). Dissociation of this species is known to proceed almost exclusively via steps 3 and 6, and not via steps 9 and 8, as the C-terminal Ca2+ ions dissociate about one hundred times slower from Ca4-CaM (CNC−) than the N-terminal Ca2+ ions (34Martin S.R. Andersson Teleman A. Bayley P.M. Drakenberg T. Forsén S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Correspondingly, we assume that dissociation of the C-terminal Ca2+ pair from CNCP is always slower than dissociation of the N-terminal pair and have therefore eliminated step 12 and the subsequent steps 10 and 11 This reduces the scheme to two competing pathways (Fig. 2B).In path A the N-terminal Ca2+ ions dissociate first (step 1), and in path B the peptide dissociates first (step 2). Path B is simply steps 2, 3, and 6 For path A, once the species C−CP forms it is possible for either the peptide to dissociate to form C−C− (step 4), or the C-terminal Ca2+ ions to dissociate to form C−−P (step 5). Step 4 is a reversible step and is a relaxation process in the mechanism, as opposed to a uni-directional irreversible step such as Ca2+ dissociation in the presence of a chelator. However, it is coupled to unidirectional steps 1 and 6 and is in parallel with step 5 It is necessary to know the relative rates of these processes to determine which path will predominate.The Relaxation Step: Theoretical JustificationThe values of k−4 and k−5 can be estimated, and dissociation via step 4 is found likely to predominate in certain cases. Constants k−1 and k−5, the N- and C-terminal Ca2+ dissociation rates, can be estimated for a typical Ca4-CaM·peptide complex as follows. The interaction of Ca4-CaM with a peptide may be characterized by Equation 1,Kd'/Kd=(K'/K)4 where Kd′ and Kd are the dissociation constants for the interaction of the peptide with apo-CaM and Ca4-CaM. K and K′ (average Ca2+ affinities) are equal to (K1K2K3K4)1/4 and (K1′K2′K3′K4′)1/4, respectively, where Ki and Ki′ are the stoichiometric Ca2+ association constants measured in the absence and presence of peptide (39Yazawa M. Ikura M. Hikichi K. Ying L. Yagi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10951-10954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The value of K for Drosophila CaM is 1.45 × 105M−1 (25Maune J.F. Klee C.B. Beckingham K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5286-5295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the values of Kd are known for each peptide (Table II). Values of Kd′ are less well established. Values of 620 and 25 mM have been reported for the peptides C28W and C20W from the CaM binding domain of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump (40Yazawa M. Vorherr T. James P. Carafoli E. Yagi K. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3171-3176Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and values of 80 mM and 5.7 μM have been reported for bovine heart phosphodiesterase and troponin I (41Olwin B.B. Storm D.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 8081-8086Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Since binding of the peptides WFF and FFW to apo-CaM cannot be detected by CD at peptide concentrations of 100 μM,2 it is reasonable to assume a Kd′ of more than 1 mM for the sk-MLCK peptides. For a typical peptide with a Kd of 1 nM, values of Kd′ in the range 1 to 100 mM would correspond to (K′/K)4 values in the range 106 to 108 and therefore to K′/K values in the range 30 to 100. Values in this range have been determined for other peptides (40Yazawa M. Vorherr T. James P. Carafoli E. Yagi K. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3171-3176Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 41Olwin B.B. Storm D.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 8081-8086Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar).Stoichiometric Ca2+ association constants for CaM in the presence of the peptides used here show that both N- and C-domain Ca2+ affinities are enhanced, and consistent with this, peptide WFF (like other peptides) shows much lower affinity for Ca2-TR2C (Kd = 76 nM) than for Ca4-CaM (<0.2 nM) (13Bayley P.M. Findlay W.A. Martin S.R. Protein Sci. 1996; 7: 1215-1228Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Thus Ca2+ binding in both domains contributes to the enhanced peptide affinity, and the peptide affinity for a partially saturated Ca2-CaM will be less than for Ca4-CaM. The above calculation can be taken further, assuming that the difference between K and K′ is reflected in the Ca2+ dissociation rates. If the effect of the peptide on the N- and C-domain Ca2+ affinity is approximately equal, both the N- and C-terminal dissociation rates are expected to be decreased by the above factor of 30 to 100. Since the dissociation rates in the absence of peptide are ≈700 s−1 (N-terminal) and 8.5 s−1 (C-terminal), we predict k−1 values in the range 25-7 s−1 and k−5 values in the range 0.3-0.085 s−1. The rate of Ca2+ dissociation from C−CP (step 5) is therefore predicted to be much slower than 8.5 s−1 (Table II), the rate of Ca2+ dissociation from CaM in the absence of peptide (step 6).Calculations also show that k−4, the peptide dissociation rate from C−CP, is likely to be at least 10 s−1, owing to the lower affinity of the peptide for CaM after loss of the N-terminal Ca2+ ions, see above. By analogy with the kon for the association of FWF with Ca4-CaM, k4 is likely to be of the order of 109M−1 s−1, and hence the re-association reaction of the peptide becomes significant. Step 4 is reversible, i.e. it is a relaxation process. The rate of this step will be greater than k−4, and, since k−4 > k−5, it will exceed k−5. Hence, dissociation via step 4 should be significant. Even if the effect of the peptide is largely on the C-terminal Ca2+ sites, both k−4 and k−5 will be reduced, and the relaxation step 4 and the dissociation step 5 will remain in competition.The Relaxation Step: Experimental JustificationThe reversible nature of step 4 suggests that the observed rates should be affected by the [peptide]/[CaM] ratio. We therefore measured the dissociation reaction for Ca4-CaM·WFF as a function of the [WFF]/[CaM] ratio. At [WFF]/[CaM] = 1.05 the EGTA-induced dissociation of Ca4-CaM·WFF (monitored by peptide Trp fluorescence) is biphasic with a fast phase rate of 12"

Riordan J.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7118-7126Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) that have N- and O-linked oligosaccharides attached to their polypeptide chains (2Conroy J.M. Hartley J.L. Soffer R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 524: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 3Ripka J.E. Ryan J.W. Valido F.A. Chung A.Y.K. Peterson C.M. Urry R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Expression of ACE in human HeLa cells in the presence of tunicamycin resulted in complete inhibition of glycosylation, rapidly degraded intracellular ACE, and no enzyme released in the medium (4Kasturi S. Jabbar M.A. Sen G.C. Sen I. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6228-6234Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). An enzymatically active ACE was produced with partial glycosylation in a mutant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line (ldlD), although it was released to a lesser extent (4Kasturi S. Jabbar M.A. Sen G.C. Sen I. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6228-6234Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Similarly, it was reported (5Naim H.Y. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) that inhibitors of glucosidases I and II in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mannosidase I in the cis-Golgi reduced the amount of oligosaccharide attached to human intestinal ACE and delayed protein release significantly. These data strongly suggest that glycosylation plays an important role in the membrane targeting and release of ACE, possibly by affecting the folding of the polypeptide and its recognition by a variety of enzymes in the folding and transport machineries. Recently, Sadhukhan and Sen (6Sadhukhan R. Sen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6429-6434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) reported that mutations at individual N-linked glycosylation sites (sequons) in rabbit testis ACE (tACE) resulted in varied efficiencies in enzyme release, which suggests that N-linked glycans at each site may make different contributions to ACE transport and release.Comparison of the cDNA sequences of ACE in human, rabbit, and mouse further supports such a role for glycosylation in ACE. Five of the seven potential N-linked glycosylation sequons in human tACE have counterparts in rabbit, and a sixth sequon is also present in mouse. It is not known whether the two additional N-linked glycosylation sequons in human tACE are utilized, although studies have shown heterogeneity across different species, both in the sites of oligosaccharide attachment and the types of carbohydrate components (3Ripka J.E. Ryan J.W. Valido F.A. Chung A.Y.K. Peterson C.M. Urry R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). tACE from all three species contains a serine/threonine-rich NH2-terminal motif that is heavily glycosylated, although no apparent function for the O-glycosylation has been demonstrated (4Kasturi S. Jabbar M.A. Sen G.C. Sen I. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6228-6234Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 7Ehlers M.R.W. Chen Y.-N.P. Riordan J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).Information on ACE active site residues and structures is based largely on homology between ACE and other zinc metalloenzymes, and attempts to crystallize ACE have not been successful. It is thought that partial or complete removal of the carbohydrate might facilitate the crystallization and structural studies of ACE. Expression of rabbit tACE in Escherichia coli resulted in a carbohydrate-free form of the protein, but it was devoid of any enzyme activity (6Sadhukhan R. Sen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6429-6434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Partially glycosylated ACE proteins generated by transient expression in human HeLa cells and in yeast were found to be enzymatically active but left open the question of whether glycosylation affects in any way the specific activities of ACE in vitroIn this study, we have identified the N-linked glycosylation sites in human tACE expressed in CHO cells by a combination of enzymatic digestion and chemical cleavage of the protein followed by mass spectrometry. Four of the five conserved sequons are glycosylated, and a fifth is likely glycosylated as well. A sequon that is present in human and mouse but not in rabbit ACE is partially glycosylated. In addition, we provide evidence that a chemically homogeneous form of tACE can be prepared by inhibition of complex N-linked glycosylation and enzymatic removal of the high mannose oligosaccharides. Kinetic analysis indicates that the enzyme is fully active in vitro, suggesting that it is a good candidate for crystallographic studies. Our results further support the hypothesis that glycosylation plays a critical role in the folding of ACE and that the effects on transport and enzyme release may be site-dependent.DISCUSSIONGlycosylation is an essential feature of the biosynthesis of ACE. Rabbit tACE, transiently expressed in human HeLa cells in the presence of tunicamycin, a chemical inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation, appeared only in the cytosol and was degraded rapidly (4Kasturi S. Jabbar M.A. Sen G.C. Sen I. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6228-6234Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Studies of partial glycosylation of tACE by mutation of potential N-linked glycosylation sites indicated that the oligosaccharide chains at each site make different contributions to in vivo stability and localization (6Sadhukhan R. Sen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6429-6434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Such selective effects are not unprecedented. For example, in the case of the human vasoactive intestinal peptide I receptor it was reported that Asn58 or Asn69 is critical for its correct delivery to the plasma membrane (15Couvineau A. Fabre C. Gaudin P. Maoret J.-J. Laburthe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1745-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and glycans at Asn25 in human interferon-γ were found to confer protease resistance (16Sareneva T. Pirhonen J. Cantell K. Julkunen I. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We have identified three fully glycosylated and three partially glycosylated Asn residues among the seven N-glycosylation sequons in human tACE when the enzyme is expressed in CHO cells. Our results are similar to those obtained with rabbit tACE (6Sadhukhan R. Sen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6429-6434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) in that all five conserved potential glycosylation sites are glycosylated. Three of these five are located near the NH2 terminus of the enzyme, and either of the first two was found to be sufficient for the release of rabbit tACE (6Sadhukhan R. Sen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6429-6434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Our observation is consistent with the suggestion that glycosylation at these sites is probably involved in recognition and intracellular transport during later stages of enzyme biosynthesis.The potential glycosylation site Asn155 was found to be present in both glycosylated and unglycosylated forms. It is interesting to note that Asn155 is located between cysteines 152 and 158, which form a disulfide bond (17Sturrock E.D. Yu X.C. Wu Z. Biemann K. Riordan J.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9560-9566Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and it is “homologous” to Asn131 in somatic ACE. We have suggested that specific disulfide formations in ACE could be critical in its folding process (17Sturrock E.D. Yu X.C. Wu Z. Biemann K. Riordan J.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9560-9566Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This would be consistent with the report that ACE expressed in E. coli did not have a conformation that generated enzymatic activity (6Sadhukhan R. Sen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6429-6434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It appears that glycosylation processes in either the ER or Golgi may be affected by disulfide formation. Specific constraints imposed by the disulfide linkage between Cys152 and Cys158 in human tACE may prevent or reduce oligosaccharide attachment at Asn155 much as it seems to prevent enzymatic deglycosylation (see above). In fact, Asn155 is replaced by an Asp in rabbit tACE, whereas the positions of the two cysteines are conserved. It was demonstrated that conditions that prevent disulfide bond formation in tissue-type plasminogen activator allow complete glycosylation of a sequon that is otherwise variably glycosylated (18Allen S. Naim H.Y. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4797-4804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus it may well be that mutations of cysteines that form the three disulfide bonds in tACE would not only affect folding but also affect glycosylation and consequently its transport and release.A summary of the N-glycosylation state of the seven sequons is presented in (Fig. 6). It is interesting that the fully glycosylated sequons all end with threonine, whereas those that are only partially glycosylated end with serine. This agrees with the recent report that when serine is in the third position, glycosylation is less complete than in the case of threonine (19Picard V. Ersdal-Badju E. Bock S.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8433-8440Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For Asn155 the effect of the disulfide bond discussed above may be an additional factor in reducing the level of glycosylation. Indeed, the particular order in which folding, disulfide formation, and other post-translational modifications occur within the ER will likely determine the accessibility of sequons to core glycosylation.The only unglycosylated site in tACE was identified at Asn620. It has been shown that ACE is released from the plasma membrane of the CHO cells into the medium by a cleavage between Arg627 and Ser628 (8Ehlers M.R.W. Schwager S.L.U. Scholle R.R. Manji G.A. Brandt W.F. Riordan J.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9549-9559Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 20Ramchandran R. Sen I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12645-12652Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The exact nature of the protease(s) involved in the cleavage reaction is not clear, but it is possible that if the nearby Asn620 was glycosylated, this proteolytic modification might be sterically hindered. Indeed, this potential glycosylation site is absent in rabbit and mouse. From our initial analyses of human somatic ACE, Asn1196, which corresponds to Asn620 of tACE, was also not glycosylated. Sequons at the COOH-terminal ends of proteins are often found to be unglycosylated. The present observations would seem to be another example of this general but not well understood phenomenon.Our sequencing analysis of somatic ACE, although not yet complete, provides interesting information on N-linked glycosylation sites. Human seminal plasma ACE has been reported to consist of 14% carbohydrate by weight and to have approximately seven N-linked glycosylation sites (3Ripka J.E. Ryan J.W. Valido F.A. Chung A.Y.K. Peterson C.M. Urry R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Whereas human kidney ACE may have slightly more carbohydrate, it is possible that we have identified most if not all of its glycosylated Asn sites and that the general pattern observed is, perhaps not surprisingly, similar to that seen in tACE (Fig. 7). Both isozymes are heavily glycosylated at their NH2 termini, with the Asn in sequon Asn-Lys-Ser glycosylated in both isozymes (Asn337 in tACE and Asn913 in somatic ACE). Further to the discussion above, it is likely that carbohydrates attached at the NH2 termini of the ACE proteins are used as general signals in trafficking to the plasma membrane. This concept is consistent with the observation by Sadhukhan and Sen and (6Sadhukhan R. Sen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6429-6434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) that only one sequon at the NH2 terminus of the rabbit tACE was necessary and sufficient for tACE release, but the exact site of that sequon was not critical. On the other hand, it is tempting to speculate that the oligosaccharide chain on Asn-Lys-Ser in both isozymes may play a more specific functional role in ACE, as the nearby zinc binding site and the disulfide-linked cysteines are located in a region where sequence homology is significantly higher. It should be noted, however, that the sequence of residues 36-701 of tACE is identical to that of residues 613-1277 (the COOH-terminal domain) of somatic ACE. Yet although six of the seven sequons in tACE are glycosylated, the limited evidence (Table III) suggests that only one is glycosylated in the corresponding segment of somatic ACE. Moreover, while the N- and C- domains of somatic ACE are homologous only one of the 10 sequons in the former has a counterpart in the latter. The five that are glycosylated have no equivalent sequons. Thus, the similarity of glycosylation patterns seen in somatic and tACE (Fig. 8) seems to be determined by the order in which sequons enter the ER rather than by overall sequence.It remains unclear whether and which glycosylation sites influence the transport, release, and stability of ACE. Naim (5Naim H.Y. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) reported that selective inhibition of glucosidases I and II in the ER and mannosidase I in the Golgi causes a significant delay in intestinal ACE secretion. In addition, rabbit tACE appeared to be trapped intracellularly and undergo rapid degradation in tunicamycin-treated human HeLa cells. These observations would be consistent with the concept that a specific interaction between oligosaccharides and the folding machinery in the ER is required for proper protein processing in eukaryotic cells. It was demonstrated that mutations in glycosylation sites in the human immunoglobulin E receptor α-subunit caused misfolding and retention of the protein in the ER (21Letourneur O. Sechi S. Willette-Brown J. Robertson M.W. Kinet J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8249-8256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Glycosylation may also affect protein secretion in a more direct way (22Fiedler K. Simons K. Cell. 1995; 81: 309-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). It has been documented that N-glycans in properly folded lysosomal enzymes are recognized by a specific mechanism in the Golgi which generates a mannose 6-phosphate marker critical to their delivery via endocytic pathways (23Kornfeld S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). Scheiffele et al. (24Scheiffele P. Peränen J. Simons K. Nature. 1995; 378: 96-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) demonstrated that nonglycosylated growth hormone is secreted both apically and basolaterally but only apically when glycosylated.Structural studies of ACE have long been hampered by an inability to crystallize the enzyme. It is thought that the removal of the carbohydrates on ACE may help alleviate this problem. As tACE expressed in E. coli is catalytically inactive (6Sadhukhan R. Sen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6429-6434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), enzymatic removal of oligosaccharides appears to be a promising alternative strategy. Complete enzymatic deglycosylation can only occur when ACE is denatured. To obtain structurally meaningful information on the active site of ACE, it is essential that the deglycosylated ACE retains its native conformation and is enzymatically active. Our results show that the NB-DNJ-treated ACE mutant digested with endoglycosidase H is deglycosylated yet fully active. (It actually retains a single N-acetylglucosamine residue at each glycosylation site but should be devoid of oligosaccharide-based heterogeneity.) This form of ACE is thus considered a good candidate for crystallographic studies. Our results further support the notion that in vivo, glycosylation confers higher stability and plays a role in the transport and release of ACE.

The results demonstrate that very minor changes in the peptide sequence may drastically alter antimicrobial activity but that the induction of bacteriocin production is much more tolerant of structural modification, especially at the N terminus."
https://openalex.org/W1568474642,"Abstract We have investigated binding of rat ribosomal proteins to the “GTPase domain” of 28 S rRNA and its effect on accessibility to the anti-28 S autoantibody, which recognizes a unique tertiary structure of this RNA domain. Ribosomal protein L12 and P protein complex (P complex) consisting of P0, P1, and P2 both bound to the GTPase domain of rat 28 S rRNA in a buffer containing Mg2. Chemical footprinting analysis of their binding sites revealed that the P complex mainly protected a conserved internal loop region comprising residues 1855-1861 and 1920-1922, whereas L12 protected an adjacent helix region encompassing residues 1867-1878 and 1887-1899. These sites are close to but distinct from the binding site for anti-28 S antibody determined previously. The bindings of P complex and L12 increased the anti-28 S accessibility, as revealed by gel retardation and quantitative immunoprecipitation analyses. In a Mg2+-eliminated condition, the RNA failed to bind to either anti-28 S or L12 but assembled into a complex under their coexistence. However, the RNA retained a property of binding to the P complex even in the absence of Mg2+, and this binding conferred high anti-28 S accessibility. These results indicated that the bindings of the P complex and L12 to their respective sites influenced the GTPase domain to increase the accessibility to anti-28 S. A possible RNA conformation adjusted by the protein bindings is discussed."

The mechanisms involved in the transcriptional control of the human gene are largely unknown. HepG2 cells represent an appropriate model system for the study of the regulation of the gene. To identify liver-specific DNA sequences in the promoter of the human CYP7 gene, we first examined the DNase I hypersensitivity in the 5′-region of the gene. An area of hypersensitivity was observed in the region from −50 to −200 of the human gene in nuclei from transcriptionally active HepG2 cells, but was absent in transcriptionally inactive HeLa cell nuclei or in free DNA. Various 5′-promoter deletion constructs were made and transfected into HepG2 cells. About 300 base pairs of upstream sequence are required for high level promoter activity of the human CYP7 gene in HepG2 cells. DNase I footprinting of the hypersensitive region revealed nine protected sequences. Gel retardation experiments demonstrated binding of HNF-3 to the segment from −80 to −70 and of hepatocyte nuclear factor HNF-4 (and ARP-1) to the segment from −148 to −127 of the human CYP7 promoter. Deletion of either of these sites depressed promoter activity in HepG2 cells. A third region from −313 to −285 is bound by members of the HNF-3 family and acts as an enhancer.

Cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the pathway that leads to the catabolism of cholesterol to bile acids (for review, see Ref. 1Russell D.W. Setchell K.D.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4737-4749Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase is a microsomal enzyme member of the cytochrome P-450 family. In human and rat, the major products of this metabolic pathway are cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid. Bile acids have an important role in cholesterol homeostasis; their synthesis and excretion cause a decrease in hepatic cholesterol levels, while their presence in the intestine facilitates the solubilization of dietary fats and is required for the absorption of cholesterol and fat-soluble vitamins. Because of the importance of these functions, bile acid synthesis in the liver is carefully regulated to maintain cholesterol homeostasis (1Russell D.W. Setchell K.D.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4737-4749Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). To date, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that control cholesterol catabolism and bile acid synthesis. The cDNAs and genes for cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase have been isolated from rat (2Li Y.C. Wang D.P. Chiang J.Y.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 8190-8197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), making this gene a target for the study of the molecular mechanisms implicated in hepatic-specific gene expression. Work by several groups has demonstrated that CYP7 mRNA levels are modulated in cultured cells by a number of effectors. For example, in cultured rat hepatocytes (10Twisk J. Lehmann E.M. Princen H.M.G. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and human hepatoma (HepG2) cells, the addition of bile acids to the culture media suppresses CYP7 mRNA levels (11Taniguchi T. Chen J. Cooper A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10071-10078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and dietary cholesterol and dexamethasone increase CYP7 mRNA levels (12Princen H.M.G. Meijer P. Hofstee B. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In vivo, however, cholesterol feeding increases but dexamethasone reduces CYP7 mRNA levels in rats (12Princen H.M.G. Meijer P. Hofstee B. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 13Pandak W.M. Li Y.C. Chiang J.Y.L. Studer E.J. Gurley E.C. Heuman D.M. Vlahcevic Z.R. Hylemon P.B. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1871-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) demonstrated that in rats, CYP7 gene expression follows a strict diurnal rhythm, with mRNA levels peaking in the evening; this phenomenon is controlled at the level of transcription by a specific transcription factor, DBP. Our long-term goal is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that operate to regulate transcription of the human CYP7 gene in the liver as well as those that promote modulation by diet and hormones. As a first step toward our goal, we have pursued the identification of liver-specific elements that regulate basal transcription of the human CYP7 gene in hepatic cells. HepG2 cells have been used successfully as a model system to study CYP7 gene expression in a number of laboratories (11Taniguchi T. Chen J. Cooper A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10071-10078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Chiang J.Y.L. Stroup D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17502-17507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Lee Y.-H. Alberta J.A. Gonzalez F.J. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14681-14689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Up-regulation of CYP7 mRNA by cholesterol as well as down-regulation by bile acids have been demonstrated (11Taniguchi T. Chen J. Cooper A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10071-10078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our rationale has been to use DNase I hypersensitivity as a tool to map liver-specific elements that are relevant in vivo, followed by a thorough analysis of the underlying hepatic control elements in HepG2 cells prior to testing them in in vivo animal models. Using this approach, we established that liver-specific promoter elements of the CYP7 gene lie between −213 and +1. Within this region are functional binding sites for the liver-enriched transcription factors HNF-3 (−80 to −70), HNF-4, and ARP-1 (−144 to −127). Furthermore, a ubiquitous transcription factor that binds to the region from −197 to −173 reduces promoter activity of the human CYP7 gene, and an enhancer resides within an HNF-3-like binding site at −300 to −293. All constructs were derived from plasmid D230 20.5-1 (kindly provided by the late Dr. Mike Komaromy). This plasmid contains the segment from −780 to +133 of the human cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase gene and was constructed by PCR 1The abbreviations used are:PCR,!polymerase chain reactionCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseCHOChinese hamster ovarybpbase pair(s). using oligonucleotide primers derived from the GeneBank™ data base sequence. The genomic sequence is flanked by BamHI sites, allowing it to be excised by digestion with BamHI. Construct −764CAT was made by insertion of the −764/+46 BamHI fragment into a pOCAT vector (17Prost E. Moore D.D. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 45: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) that had been digested with BamHI and treated with calf intestinal phosphatase. Plasmid −764CAT was used as a template for the remaining 5′-promoter deletion plasmids. The 5′-primers used for amplification were as follows: −341 to −317 for the −341CAT construct, −313 to −289 for the −313CAT construct, −285 to −261 for the −285CAT construct, −268 to −244 for the −268CAT construct, −227 to −203 for the −227CAT construct, −213 to −189 for the −213CAT construct, −91 to −67 for the −91CAT construct, and −65 to −41 for the −65CAT construct. In every case, the sequence of the primer started with CGCGGATTC (the BamHI site). The 3′-primer for all these constructs extended from +46 to +22 and also contained a BamHI site at its 5′-end. In each case, the amplified product was digested with BamHI, followed by ligation to the pOCAT vector that had been digested with BamHI. To prepare plasmid −313CATΔ(−80/−70), the following PCR primers were used: primer 1, from −313 to −292 (with the BamHI site at the 5′-end); primer 2, from −55 to −95, but without the sequence from −70 to −80; primer 3, from −95 to −55 without −80 to −70; and primer 4, from +46 to +22 with the BamHI site at the 5′-end. The first PCR utilized primers 3 and 4 and generated an intermediate product spanning from −95 to +46 without −80 to −70. The two intermediate PCR products were mixed, denatured, reannealed, and used as primers on a third PCR to generate a product spanning from −313 to +46 without −80 to −70. This BamHI fragment was then cloned into pOCAT. The orientation of the insert was determined by PCR. Constructs −227CATΔ(−197/−173), −213CATΔ(−144/−127), and −313CATΔ(−300/−293) were made in a similar manner as the construct described above. Construct −313mut-1 was made by introducing a primer in which five point mutations (CGTAC instead of AAACA at −298 to −294) were made to disrupt HNF-3 binding. The DNA sequence of every promoter deletion construct was verified by sequencing. polymerase chain reaction chloramphenicol acetyltransferase Chinese hamster ovary base pair(s). Human hepatoma cells (HepG2), Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and HeLa cells were grown as described previously (18Levy-Wilson B. Fortier C. Blackhart B.D. McCarthy B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Transient transfections with the various plasmid constructs were performed by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method as described previously (19Brooks A.R. Blackhart B.D. Haubold K. Levy-Wilson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7848-7859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with 7 μg of the CAT gene expression plasmid and 6 μg of an internal reference plasmid (pRSVβ-gal). In some experiments, 6 μg of an expression plasmid for HNF-3α (20Paulweber B. Sandhofer F. Levy-Wilson B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1534-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) or control vector was included. The CAT assays were performed according to the protocol of Gorman et al. (21Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5294) Google Scholar), and CAT activities were normalized according to the results of the β-galactosidase activity in order to correct for differences in transfection efficiency. Nuclear extracts from HepG2 and CHO cells were prepared by the method of Dignam et al. (22Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar). Extracts from mouse liver nuclei were made by the procedure of Gorski et al. (23Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts from COS cells were prepared as described previously (20Paulweber B. Sandhofer F. Levy-Wilson B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1534-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In some cases, cells were transfected with 20 μg of an expression plasmid for HNF-3 (24Lai E. Prezioso V.R. Smith E. Litvin O. Costa R.H. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation technique as described above. For gel mobility shift assays, 1-4 μg of nuclear extract was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 0.5-1 ng of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide and 4 μg of poly(dI-dC) in buffer containing 15 mM Hepes (pH 7.9), 15% glycerol, 0.6 mM EDTA, 60 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, and 0.6 mM dithiothreitol. Incubation mixtures were then fractionated on 5% native polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 × Tris borate/EDTA. Gels were soaked in 10% glycerol for 10 min, dried, and exposed to x-ray films. DNase I hypersensitivity studies were performed as described by Levy-Wilson et al. (18Levy-Wilson B. Fortier C. Blackhart B.D. McCarthy B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). DNase I footprinting was performed as described before (19Brooks A.R. Blackhart B.D. Haubold K. Levy-Wilson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7848-7859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were purchased from the Stanford University Digestive Disease Center. Complementary sets of single-stranded oligonucleotides were annealed to form double-stranded oligonucleotides and then purified on nondenaturing 15% acrylamide gels. To determine whether there are any DNase I-hypersensitive sites in the 5′-end of the human CYP7 gene, several sets of experiments were performed. A representative example is shown in Fig. 1. Nuclei from HepG2 cells or HeLa cells or free DNA was treated with increasing amounts of DNase I, followed by digestion of the purified DNA with EcoRV. The Southern blots were hybridized with the probe indicated at the bottom of Fig. 1. The original 2917-bp EcoRV fragment was progressively digested by incubation of HepG2 nuclei with increasing amounts of DNase I. Concomitantly, a broad band appeared and was designated DH1 (Nase I-ypersensitive). From the mobility of the DH1 band relative to known restriction fragment markers run in parallel with the samples, DH1 was localized to between −50 and −200 of the CYP7 gene, as shown above the map in the bottom part of Fig. 1. When nuclei from HeLa cells (in which the CYP7 gene is transcriptionally inactive) were treated in an identical manner with DNase I, the EcoRV fragment was resistant to degradation, and no DNase I-hypersensitive sites were detected (data not shown). The hypersensitive region was not observed when free DNA from HepG2 cells was subjected to the same procedure (Fig. 1, right panel), suggesting that chromatin structural features in the vicinity of the transcriptional start site of the human CYP7 gene in HepG2 nuclei are selectively open and available for DNase I cutting. The DNase I hypersensitivity studies suggest that hepatic-specific transcription factors bind to the region from −50 to −200, thus causing its hypersensitivity. Binding of hepatic-specific nuclear proteins to the 5′-proximal region of the human CYP7 gene was examined by DNase I footprinting. Nine protected regions were observed in the DNA segment from −341 to +46 using nuclear extracts from HepG2 cells (Fig. 2, A and B). Footprint 1 extends from −35 to −48, footprint 2 from −54 to −62, footprint 3 from −67 to −81, footprint 4 from −91 to −104, footprint 5 from −129 to −144, footprint 6 from −174 to −191, footprint 7 from −213 to −227, footprint 8 from −268 to −285, and footprint 9 from −313 to −341. The protected regions have been evolutionarily conserved, as evidenced by a correspondence among the footprints in human, mouse, and rat liver cells as shown in Fig. 2 (C and D), suggesting that the nuclear proteins that bind to these sequences have an important functional role in CYP7 gene transcription. The combined results from the hypersensitivity studies and DNase I footprinting strongly suggest that key liver-specific promoter elements reside in the 300 bp immediately upstream of the transcriptional start site of the CYP7 gene. This hypothesis was tested as follows. Several constructs were made in which 5′-segments of the human CYP7 gene of varying lengths were cloned upstream of the reporter CAT gene, and their promoter activity was tested in transient transfection assays in HepG2 cells. A schematic illustration of the constructs and their promoter activities are shown in Fig. 3. The construct with the largest 5′-extension was −764CAT, followed by −341CAT. To elucidate the potential functional role of the footprinted regions, subsequent constructs were designed to exclude either one footprint at a time or the region between two footprints. Transient transfections into HepG2 cells revealed a small but reproducible reduction of CAT activity (∼20%) upon deletion of sequences between −764 and −341, suggesting that weak positive control elements reside in this region. On the other hand, a weak negative element may reside between −341 and −313 (footprint 9), as judged by the 30% increase in CAT activity of the −313CAT construct as compared with the −341CAT construct. Deletion of the segment from −313 to −285 caused a 40% decrease in CAT activity, suggesting that this segment may contain binding sites for a positive regulatory element. Further deletions from −285 to −227 and from −227 to −213 increased CAT activity by 30% each, respectively, suggesting that footprints 7 and 8 may harbor binding sites for negative regulatory elements. The −213CAT construct exhibited the highest promoter activity, suggesting that most of the important elements are localized within 213 bp upstream of the start site, in agreement with the DNase I data of Fig. 1. Deletion of the segment from −213 to −91 that includes footprints 4-6 caused a 40% reduction in promoter activity, suggesting the removal of a positive element. The activity of the −65CAT deletion was 2-fold lower than that of the −91CAT construct, suggesting that a positive element resides between −91 and −65. Therefore, from the data in Fig. 3, we conclude that the segment from −213 to +1 contains the minimal regulatory elements required for transcription from the human CYP7 promoter in transient assays in HepG2 cells. The decline in transcriptional activity observed when sequences between −213 and −91 were deleted (Fig. 3) suggests that DNA sequences in this region play a key role in basal promoter activity. Three nuclear protein-binding sites, namely footprints 4-6, are located in this region. To identify the protein factors responsible for footprints 4-6, gel retardation experiments were conducted. A double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the segment from −197 to −173 (representing footprint 6) was incubated with nuclear extracts from HepG2 and CHO cells (Fig. 4). Two specific complexes were formed with HepG2 extracts (lane 1) that were competed for by an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide (lane 2). The same specific complexes were seen when using CHO extracts (lanes 3 and 4), suggesting that the transcription factor binding to this region may be ubiquitous. The specific complex of lower molecular weight may represent a proteolytic fragment of the major binding protein since the intensity of this band varied from extract to extract. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that two different proteins bind to this sequence. An excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides representing in each case the binding site for a known transcription factor such as HNF-1, C/EBP, HNF-3, and HNF-4 failed to abolish complex formation (data not shown). Comparison of the DNA sequence from −197 to −173 to a data base of transcription factor-binding sites revealed only some similarity to the binding site for the GATA factor that plays a role in erythroid expressed genes (25Tsai S.F. Martin D.I.K. Zon L.I. D'Andrea A.D. Wong G.G. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 26Evans T. Reitman M. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1989; 58: 877-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The segment from −148 to −127 (representing footprint 5) exhibited sequence similarity to the binding sites for the liver-enriched transcription factors HNF-4 (27Sladek F.M. Zhong W. Lai E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2353-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar) and ARP-1 (28Ladias J.A.A. Karathanasis S. Science. 1991; 251: 561-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). These two proteins bind to the same DNA sequence with different affinities. When the labeled −148/−127 oligonucleotide was incubated with an extract from COS cells that had been transfected with an HNF-4 expression vector (Fig. 5, lane 2), we observed a complex that was not detected with control extract. This complex was competed for by an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide (lane 3), confirming its identity as the HNF-4 complex. A weaker but specific HNF-4·DNA complex was also detected with HepG2 nuclear extracts (lanes 6 and 7). When the −148/−127 probe was incubated with an extract from COS cells that had been transfected with an ARP-1 expression plasmid, we observed formation of a retarded complex (lane 4), not evident with control extract, that was also specific (lane 5). However, the affinity of ARP-1 for the footprint 5 sequence appears to be severalfold lower than the affinity of HNF-4 for that same sequence. Incubation of an oligonucleotide representing footprint 4 with nuclear extracts yielded one weak specific complex of high molecular weight (data not shown). Computer analysis of footprint 4 revealed no similarities to the binding sites of known transcription factors. To ascertain the functional importance of the proteins binding to footprints 5 and 6, the effect of deleting these regions upon promoter activity was determined. The −144/−127 deletion (footprint 5) was made in the context of the −213CAT construct, and the −197/−173 deletion (footprint 6) was made in the context of the −227CAT construct (Fig. 6). Deletion of the sequence from −197 to −173 (footprint 6) increased promoter activity by 2-fold, suggesting that it binds a negative regulatory element. On the other hand, deletion of the −144/−127 segment (footprint 5) decreased CAT activity by ∼2.5-fold, indicating that the protein(s) binding to footprint 5 also play a role in the transcriptional activation of the CYP7 gene. Having demonstrated that both HNF-4 and ARP-1 can bind to footprint 5 (Fig. 5), we examined the effect of an excess of each of these transcription factors upon the CAT activities of the wild-type and deletion constructs. To this end, the reporter constructs were cotransfected with expression plasmids for either HNF-4 or ARP-1. Cotransfection of the wild-type −213CAT construct with HNF-4 failed to alter promoter activity, suggesting that HNF-4 may not be limiting in our HepG2 cells. As expected, the additional HNF-4 protein did not affect the CAT activity of the −213CAT construct in which the HNF-4 site had been deleted (Fig. 6). An excess of ARP-1 protein reduced the transcriptional activity of the wild-type −213CAT construct by 2-fold, a result consistent with the fact that ARP-1, when binding to its cognate sequence, usually exerts a repressor effect (28Ladias J.A.A. Karathanasis S. Science. 1991; 251: 561-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). As expected, an excess of ARP-1 protein had no effect in the absence of the ARP-1-binding site. These data suggest that both HNF-4 and ARP-1 can bind to the −144/−127 region. When HNF-4 binds, it promotes activation of transcription; when ARP-1 binds, transcription is decreased. This is analogous to the situation in the proximal promoter of the human apoB gene, where an HNF-4 (ARP-1) site resides (20Paulweber B. Sandhofer F. Levy-Wilson B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1534-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Computer analysis of the sequence of the proximal promoter region of the human CYP7 gene revealed a perfect match to the HNF-3-binding site (TGTTTGCT) (20Paulweber B. Sandhofer F. Levy-Wilson B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1534-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) in the segment from −80 to −70, a sequence that is 100% conserved among the human, rat, and mouse genes. Binding of nuclear proteins from HepG2 cells and mouse liver to an oligonucleotide encompassing this sequence (−88 to −65) was examined. In Fig. 7, we observe that the labeled −88/−65 oligonucleotide forms two major retarded complexes with HepG2 extracts, designated as A and B (lane 3). The mobility of these complexes is identical to that of complexes A and B formed between a labeled oligonucleotide representing a consensus HNF-3-binding site and HepG2 nuclear proteins (lane 1). Specificity of binding is established in lane 2 Furthermore, the −88/−65 probe also formed two specific complexes with mouse liver nuclear extracts (lane 4) that were competed for by the homologous oligonucleotide (lane 5) as well as by the HNF-3 consensus oligonucleotide (lane 6). The HNF-3 consensus oligonucleotide formed retarded complexes with mouse liver proteins that were identical in mobility to those formed by the −88/−65 oligonucleotide (lane 7) and were specific (lane 8) and also competed for by the −88/−65 oligonucleotide (lane 9). These observations confirm that HNF-3 does bind to the −88/−65 segment of the CYP7 promoter. The functional significance of this binding was studied by making a promoter construct in which the HNF-3 site at −80 to −70 was deleted in the context of the −313CAT construct (Fig. 8). The −313CAT construct has an activity of 1.10 as compared with the −764CAT construct. Deletion of the −80/−70 segment reduced promoter activity by 3-fold, demonstrating that binding of HNF-3 to this sequence is important for promoter activity in HepG2 cells. When an HNF-3α expression vector was cotransfected with our constructs, the activity of the wild-type −313CAT construct was 5-fold higher, implying that HNF-3α is limiting in HepG2 cells. When the region from −80 to −70 was deleted from the construct, transcriptional activity in the presence of an excess of HNF-3α was again reduced, thus underscoring the importance of this region in hepatic transcription of the CYP7 promoter. Based on computer analysis, there are three other potential HNF-3-binding sites within the region from −320 to −240 of the human CYP7 promoter, namely −316 to −306, −288 to −278, and −235 to −243 (29Wang D.P. Stroup D. Marrapodi M. Crestani M. Galli G. Chiang J.Y.L. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1831-1841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The footprinting data of Fig. 2 revealed a protected region from −285 to −268. However, deletion of this segment did not affect promoter activity (data not shown), suggesting that the putative HNF-3 site at −285 to −268 is not functional in our assays. Similarly, the segment from −255 to −245 was not protected by nuclear proteins from liver or HepG2 cells (Fig. 2), suggesting that HNF-3 may not bind to that sequence, and deletion of the region from −268 to −227 did not significantly affect the activity of the human CYP7 promoter. To evaluate the possible role of HNF-3 in these regions, we cotransfected our promoter deletion constructs together with an HNF-3α expression vector (Fig. 9). The transcriptional activity of the −764CAT, −341CAT, and −313CAT constructs was 5-7-fold higher in the presence of excess HNF-3α. On the other hand, the activity of the −285CAT construct dropped 2-fold as compared with that of the −313CAT construct in the presence of cotransfected HNF-3α, suggesting that a functional HNF-3-binding site may reside in the segment from −313 to −285 and that the putative site at −243 to −235 may not be functional. Examination of the DNA sequence from −313 to −285 revealed two (5 out of 8 bp) matches to the HNF-3 recognition sequence (−297 to −293 and −290 to −286). The sequence of this segment of the human CYP7 gene is shown in Fig. 10A, with the two 5-bp matches to the HNF-3 recognition sequences indicated by bracketsFig. 10Deletion or mutagenesis of the sequence from −302 to −293 severely reduces transcriptional activity. Shown in A are the DNA sequences of the segment from −313 to −285 of the human CYP7 gene as well as the sequences of th"

Reaction of the enzyme with 2′,4′-dinitrophenyl-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-β-D-glucopyranoside resulted in the time-dependent inactivation of this enzyme via the accumulation of a 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-glycosyl-enzyme intermediate as monitored also by electrospray mass spectrometry. The catalytic competence of this intermediate is demonstrated by its reactivation through hydrolysis (kreact = 0.0019 min−1) and by transglycosylation to benzyl thio-β-D-glucopyranoside (kreact = 0.024 min−1; Kreact = 56 mM). Peptic digestion of the labeled enzyme followed by tandem mass spectrometric analysis in the neutral loss mode allowed detection of two glycosylated active site peptides, the sequences of which were identified as NVAGEW and NVAGEWSAA. A crucial role for Glu-330 is confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis at this site and kinetic analysis of the resultant mutant. The activity of the Glu-330 → Gln mutant is reduced over 50,000-fold compared to the wild type enzyme. The glutamic acid, identified in the exoglucanase as Glu-330, is completely conserved in this family of enzymes and is hereby identified as the catalytic nucleophile.

Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). A number of these enzymes, including Exg, are also classified as family A glycanases, a group that comprises mainly cellulases (β-1,4-endoglucanases) (2Henrissat B. Claeyssens M. Tomme P. Lemsle L. Mornon J.-P. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 81: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). This family of glycosyl hydrolases cleaves glycosidic bonds with net retention of configuration, the enzymes functioning via a proposed double-displacement mechanism, involving a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate (Scheme I) (3Koshland D.E. Biol. Rev. 1953; 28: 416-436Crossref Scopus (819) Google Scholar, 4Sinnott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1497) Google Scholar).

The physiological role of Exg has not been clearly established, but it is undoubtedly involved in metabolism of cell wall β-1,3-glucan. It catalyzes the exolytic hydrolysis of polymers such as laminarin (β-1,3 linkages) and to a lesser extent pustulan (β-1,6 linkages) (5Luna A.J. Andaluz E. Ridruejo J.C. Olivero I. Larriba G. Yeast. 1991; 7: 833-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Recently it has been shown that deletion of Saccharomyces cerevisiae EXG1, which encodes the major exoglucanase secreted by the yeast resulted in a marked resistance to killer toxin (6Jiang B. Ram A.F. Sheraton J. Klis F.M. Bussey H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 248: 260-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This indicates that Exg1 is involved in the metabolism of β-1,6-linked glucan, the cell wall receptor for the toxin. In addition to catalyzing hydrolysis reactions, Exg of C. albicans also catalyzes the rapid transfer of glucosyl residues between suitable donor and acceptor molecules (7Sullivan P.A. Emerson G.W. Broughton M.J. Stubbs H.J. Tumbay E. Seeliger H.P.R. Ang O. Candida and Candidamycosis. Plenum Press, New York1991: 35-38Crossref Google Scholar). EXG, the gene for the C. albicans, encodes a protein consisting of a pre-pro sequence of 38 residues and a mature enzyme of 400 residues (8Chambers R.S. Sullivan P.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 111: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It has 58% identity at the deduced amino acid sequence level with EXG1 of S. cerevisiae A homology comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of Exg with those of other related glycosidases reveals two absolutely conserved acidic residues, Glu-230 and Glu-330. Since the generally accepted mechanism involves two carboxyl-containing amino acid residues acting as an acid/base catalyst and a nucleophile (3Koshland D.E. Biol. Rev. 1953; 28: 416-436Crossref Scopus (819) Google Scholar, 4Sinnott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1497) Google Scholar, 9Miao S. Ziser L. Aebersold R. Withers S.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7027-7032Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), it is possible that these residues represent the catalytic pair of Exg. Indeed, in a previous study we showed that the point mutations (E230D and E230Q) decreased the catalytic activity 15,000- and 400-fold, respectively (10Chambers R.S. Walden A.R. Brooke G.S. Cutfield J.F. Sullivan P.A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, an independent identification of the catalytic nucleophile by labeling studies is needed to distinguish the roles of these residues. The application of 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-glycosides in identifying active site nucleophiles has proven successful in a number of retaining glycosidases and glycanases (11Withers S.G. Aebersold R. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). These compounds function as mechanism-based inactivators, trapping the enzyme by the accumulation of a relatively stable but viable 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-glycosyl-enzyme intermediate. This labeling technique has been made more powerful with the advent of electrospray tandem mass spectrometry, circumventing the need for radiolabels in the identification and isolation of the labeled residue. Analysis of the proteolytic digest of a labeled enzyme by mass spectrometry has allowed for the identification of the catalytic nucleophiles of Bacillus subtilis xylanase (9Miao S. Ziser L. Aebersold R. Withers S.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7027-7032Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and human glucocerebrosidase (12Miao S. McCarter J.D. Grace M.E. Grabowski G.A. Aebersold R. Withers S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10975-10978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we report the use of 2′,4′-dinitrophenyl-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-β-D-glucopyranoside to inactivate the exo-(1,3)-β-glucanase and the use of this reagent to identify the catalytic nucleophile. In addition we describe the mutation of this residue and report the kinetic studies that confirm its key role in catalysis. Buffer chemicals and other reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise noted. The substrate 2,4-dinitrophenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (DNPGlc), and the inactivator 2′,4′-dinitrophenyl-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-β-D-glucopyranoside (2FDNPGlc) were synthesized following the general procedure described below. The inhibitor 2′,4′-dinitrophenyl-2-deoxy-2-chloro-β-D-glucopyranoside (2ClDNPGlc) was prepared in this laboratory (University of British Columbia) by Dr. L. Ziser. The competitive inhibitor benzyl thio-β-Dglucopyranoside was prepared using the procedure reported by Cerny et al (13Cerny M. Stanék J. Pacák J. Monatsh. 1963; 94: 290Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Pepsin (from porcine gastric mucosa) was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. DNPGlc and 2FDNPGlc were prepared from the corresponding per-O-acetylated glycosyl bromides (14Street I.P. Rupitz K. Withers S.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1581-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) as follows. 2,6-Lutidine (2.5 mmol, 270 mg), Drierite (1 g), and silver carbonate (2.4 mmol, 700 mg) were added to a solution of anhydrous 2,4-dinitrophenol (2.4 mmol, 450 mg) in anhydrous acetonitrile (10 ml) and stirred for 15 min under dry N2. After the dropwise addition of a solution of the glycosyl bromide (1.2 mmol) dissolved in anhydrous acetonitrile (5 ml), the reaction was stirred in the dark for 1 h, filtered, and concentrated. The residue was dissolved in chloroform (50 ml), and the solution successively washed with aqueous 5% NaHCO3 (3 × 50 ml), water (50 ml), dried over MgSO4, and concentrated. The products, crystallized from ethyl acetate and hexanes (yields from 70-85%), were deprotected with 4% (v/v) HCl/methanol (15Ballardie F. Capon B. Derek J. Sutherland G. Cocker D. Sinnott M. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin I. 1973; : 2418-2419Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Crystallization from methanol/diethyl ether yielded the final products whose analysis matched previously reported data (15Ballardie F. Capon B. Derek J. Sutherland G. Cocker D. Sinnott M. J. Chem.

Mutagenesis was carried out using either the recombinant PCR method described by Higuchi et al. (17Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2104) Google Scholar) or an oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis kit, version 2.1 (Amersham Corp.). DNA sequencing was carried out on an Applied Biosystems model 373A sequencer (version 1.2.0). Yeast transformations were carried out as described by Burgers and Percival (18Burgers P.M. Percival K.J. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 163: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) using Zymolyase 20T (Seikagaku Kogo). All other reagents used were of analytical grade. Escherichia coli strains DH5α and TG1 were used as the hosts for plasmids and bacteriophage M13mp19, respectively. Plasmids pUC19 and pBluescript KS+/− were used for subcloning experiments. Bacteriophage M13mp19 was used as the vector with the mutagenesis kit and pBluescript KS+/− was used as the vector for PCR mutagenesis. An EXG1-deficient mutant of S. cerevisiae, AWY-1 (α his3 1 leu2-3 leu2-112 ura3-52 trp1-289 gal can1 exg1:ura3) (7Sullivan P.A. Emerson G.W. Broughton M.J. Stubbs H.J. Tumbay E. Seeliger H.P.R. Ang O. Candida and Candidamycosis. Plenum Press, New York1991: 35-38Crossref Google Scholar) was used as the host organism for expression of recombinant C. albicans EXG species with expression vectors derived from plasmid pEMBLyex4 (19Cesareni G. Murray J.A.J. Setlow J.K. Genetic Engineering 9. Plenum Press, New York1987: 53-56Google Scholar). E. coli cultures carrying plasmids were grown in Luria or Terrific broth supplemented with 75 μg/ml ampicillin, and strains carrying M13mp19 were grown in 2 × YT broth (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae strains carrying plasmids were grown in the minimal medium of Wickerham (21Wickerham L.J. J. Bacteriol. 1946; 52: 293-301Crossref Google Scholar), plus 20 g/liter glucose, and 0.03 mg/ml each of L-histidine and L-tryptophan. The expression medium was the same except that the carbon source was 30 g/liter glycerol, 20 g/liter sodium lactate, and 0.5 g/liter glucose. The 1314-base pair open reading frame of the C. albicans EXG gene has previously been cloned into M13mp19 as a 1.4-kilobase pair EcoRI-HindIII fragment (22Chambers R.S. Broughton M.J. Cannon R.D. Carne A. Emerson G.W. Sullivan P.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 327: 366-369Google Scholar). Single-stranded DNA was prepared, and unique SacI and XbaI restriction sites were introduced into the gene at positions 521 and 904, respectively, using the SacI and XbaI oligonucleotides in sequential rounds of mutagenesis with the oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis kit. The mutated gene was then transferred to pUC19 as a 1.4-kilobase pair fragment, and restriction sites for PstI and SalI (3′ to the open reading frame and from a previous cloning cassette) were deleted by digestion with these enzymes, end-filling, and then ligation of the blunted ends. The EcoRI-HindIII fragment was then cloned into pBluescript KS. Prior to inserting EXG into the yeast expression plasmid pEMBLyex4, it was modified by digesting with SalI and SacI, end-filling and ligating the blunted ends. The EXG gene was then liberated from pBluescript KS as a 1.4-kilobase pair PstI-HindIII fragment and cloned into the pEMBLyex derivative described above, yielding pGB4. SalI-SacI, SacI-XbaI, and XbaI-HindIII fragments of 557, 383, and 443 base pairs from pGB4 were ligated to pBS KS to produce plasmids pFOX1, pFOX2, and pFOX3, and the fragments were sequenced fully in both directions to confirm the integrity of EXG inserted into pGB4. Primary PCR was performed in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 1.5 mM MgCl2, 50 μM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 pmol each of the appropriate mutagenic oligonucleotides, and either pFOX2 or pFOX3 as the template. The T7 and T3 oligonucleotide primers for pBluescript were used as the outside primers in both the primary and secondary PCR reactions. Reaction mixtures were subjected to an initial cycle of 95°C for 60 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 90 s. Thirty cycles of PCR were then performed. The PCR cycle was 15 s at 95°C, 30 s at 55°C, and 90 s at 72°C. Following the final cycle, the tubes were held at 72°C for 5 min. The reaction products were then size fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and desired bands were band-stabbed into secondary reaction mixtures using sterile needles. Secondary PCR was performed under the same conditions except that the pFOX templates were omitted. Products of correct size were recovered using the Geneclean II kit, digested with SacI and XbaI or XbalII and HindIII restriction enzymes, fractionated on agarose gels and recovered using the Geneclean II kit. The digested products were then ligated into pBluescript KS and cloned into E. coli DH5α. Clones were analyzed by restriction mapping and sequenced fully to confirm the desired base changes and to check for the absence of nonspecific mutations. Wild type fragments of the EXG gene in pGB4 were replaced by mutated fragments, generating plasmids pE230Q2, pE330Q2, pE330D2, and pQ330E2, and S. cerevisiae strain AWY-1 was transformed with these plasmids. Recombinant wild type Exg was purified from 10-liter batch fermentor cultures grown at 28°C with aeration at 10 liters/min and agitation at 200 rpm, and mutant exoglucanase species were purified from 1-liter cultures grown in minimal medium in shake flasks at 400 rpm, 28°C. Cultures were inoculated to an A600 = 0.15-0.20, grown to A600 = 0.35-0.4, and galactose was added to a final concentration of 20 g/liter to induce expression. Growth was continued for an additional 24-72 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (4000 × g, 15 min), and the supernatant was further clarified by passage through 1.2-μm filters. The medium was concentrated by ultrafiltration (Mr = 10,000 cut-off filter) and dialyzed against 5 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.6. With large scale preparations of the native recombinant enzyme, the concentrate was then applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column (5 × 15 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer, and the column was washed until the E280 was 0. The enzyme was then eluted in a 1.6-liter gradient from 50 mM to 150 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.6. Active fractions (at the end of the gradient) were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration, and the buffer exchanged with 5 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.6. (NH4)2SO4 was added to 0.6 M, and the solution was passed through a 0.22-μm filter and loaded onto a FPLC Phenyl-Superose HR 5/5 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) pre-equilibrated with 0.6 M (NH4)2SO4 in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The column was developed at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with a reverse gradient of 0.6-0.0 M (NH4)2SO4 in phosphate buffer over 30 min. Fractions (1 ml) containing the enzyme were pooled, and the solvent was changed to 5 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.6, using a Centricon-10 microconcentrator (Amicon). The enzyme preparations were finally concentrated to 0.5-1.0 ml and stored at 4°C with sodium azide added to a final concentration of 0.02%. With 1-liter cultures of mutant derivatives, the ion-exchange step was omitted, and the enzyme preparations were purified in one step on the Phenyl-Superose column. Exg activity was determined with laminarin, 0.54-7.8 mg/ml, in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.6. Assays (125 μl) were incubated for 30 min at 37°C, and the reactions were stopped by heating to 100°C for 10 min. Glucose formation was measured by the glucose oxidase method (23Bruss M.L. Black A.L. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 84: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and 1 unit of enzymic activity produced 1 μmol of glucose/min. Alternatively, enzyme activity was determined fluorimetrically with 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-D-glucopyranoside, 8 mM, in 20 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.6. Assays (250 μl) were incubated for 30 min at 37°C and the reactions were stopped with 500 μl of 0.1 M glycine-NaOH buffer, pH 10.3. The formation of the methylumbelliferone was measured by emission at 450 nm with excitation at 384 nm. One unit of enzyme activity produces 1 μmol of methylumbelliferone/min. The assay with methylumbelliferyl-glucoside was approximately 20 times more sensitive than the laminarin assay. Protein was estimated by a modified Lowry method (24Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 87: 386-396Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out with 10% acrylamide gels (25Laemmli U.K. Favre M. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar). Kinetic studies were performed at 37°C, in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.6, containing 0.1% BSA. A continuous spectrophotometric assay based on the hydrolysis of DNPGlc was used to monitor enzyme activity by measurement of the rate of 2,4-dinitrophenolate release (λ = 400 nm, ε = 1071 M−1 cm−1), using a Unicam UV4 UV-visible spectrophotometer equipped with a circulating water bath. The inactivation of Exg by 2FDNPGlc was monitored by incubation of the enzyme (0.02 mg/ml) under the above conditions in the presence of various concentrations of the inactivators. Residual enzyme activity was determined at appropriate time intervals by addition of an aliquot (10 μl) of the inactivation mixture to a solution of DNPGlc (2.0 mM, 600 μl) in the above buffer and measurement of 2,4-dinitrophenolate release. Pseudo-first order rate constants at each inactivator concentration (kobs) were determined by fitting each curve to a first order rate equation. Values for the inactivation rate constant (ki) and the dissociation constant for the inactivator (Ki) were determined by fitting to Equation 1.kobs = ki[I]ki+[I] Reactivation of the 2FGlc-inactivated enzyme was studied as follows. Enzyme (200 μl, 0.02 mg/ml inactivated as above, but in the absence of BSA) was concentrated using 30-kDa nominal cut-off centrifugal concentrators (Amicon Corp., Danvers, MA) to a volume of approximately 50 μl, then diluted with 200 μl of buffer without BSA. This was repeated twice, and the retentate was diluted to a final volume of 200 μl with buffer containing 1 mg/ml BSA. Samples of the inactivated enzyme were then incubated at 37°C in the presence of various concentrations of acceptor, BTGlc (0-88 mM). Reactivation was monitored by removal of aliquots (10 μl) at appropriate time intervals and assaying as described above. Any activity loss due to denaturation of the enzyme was corrected for by a control experiment involving incubation of enzyme with no inactivator. The observed reactivation rate constant, kobs, for each reaction was determined from the slope of the plots of ln(full rate minus observed rate) versus time. The rate constant (kreact) and dissociation constant (Kreact) for the reactivation were determined from a reciprocal replot of kobs versus acceptor concentrations. Exg (20 μl, 2.0 mg/ml, in 100 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.6, buffer) was incubated with 2FDNPGlc (2 μl, 20 mM) at 37°C for 2 h. Complete inactivation was confirmed by assaying with DNPGlc as described earlier. This mixture was immediately used for intact protein experiments or digested with pepsin as described below. Mass spectra were recorded using PE-Sciex API III (neutral loss experiments) and PE-Sciex API 300 (LC/MS and MS/MS experiments) triple quadrupole mass spectrometers (Sciex, Thornhill, Ontario, Canada), each equipped with an ion spray ion source. Peptides were separated by reverse phase HPLC on an Ultrafast Microprotein Analyzer (Michrom BioResources Inc., Pleasanton, CA) directly interfaced with the mass spectrometer. In each of the MS experiments, the proteolytic digest was loaded onto a C18 column (Reliasil, 1 × 150 mm), then eluted with a gradient of 0-60% solvent B over 20 min, followed by 100% B over 2 min at a flow rate of 50 μl/min (solvent A: 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, 2% acetonitrile in water; solvent B: 0.045% trifluoroacetic acid, 80% acetonitrile in water). A post-column splitter was present in all experiments, splitting off 80% of the sample into a fraction collector and sending 20% into the mass spectrometer. Spectra were obtained in either the single-quadrupole scan mode (LC/MS), the tandem MS neutral loss mode, or the tandem MS daughter scan mode (LC/MS/MS) using the settings described in each experiment. Exg (4 μg, native or 2FGlc-labeled) was introduced into the mass spectrometer through a microbore PLRP-5 column (1 × 50 mm) on a Michrom HPLC system. The quadrupole mass analyzer of an API 300 Triple Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer was scanned over a m/z range of 300-2500 Da, with a step size of 0.5 Da and a dwell time of 1 ms/step. The ion source voltage was set at 4.8 kV, and the orifice energy was 50 V. The molecular weights of the glucanase species were determined by using the deconvolution software, Multiview 1.1, supplied by Sciex. Exg (20 μl, native or labeled, 2.0 mg/ml) was mixed with 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 2 (40 μl), and pepsin (20 μl, 0.2 mg/ml in 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 2). Mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 90 min, and then immediately analyzed by ESMS or frozen until required. The single-quadrupole mode (LC/MS) conditions used were identical to those described earlier for analysis of the intact protein. In the neutral loss scanning mode, MS/MS spectra were obtained on the API III by searching for the mass loss of m/z 165, corresponding to the loss of the 2FGlc label from a peptide ion in the singly charged state. Thus, scan range: m/z 300-1800; step size: 0.5; dwell time: 1 ms/step; ion source voltage: 5 kV; orifice energy: 80; RE1 = 117; DM1 = 0.05; R1 = 10 V; R2 = −40 V; RE3 = 120; DM3 = 0.10; collision gas (90% argon, 10% N2) thickness (CGT): 3.0 × 1014 molecules/cm2 (CGT = 300-304). To maximize the sensitivity of neutral loss detection, the resolution (RE and DM) is normally compromised without generating artifact neutral loss peaks. The MS/MS daughter ion spectrum was obtained in the triple-quadrupole daughter scan mode by selectively introducing the m/z 839 (or 1068.5) peptide from the first quadrupole (Q1) into the collision cell (Q2) and observing the daughter ions in the third quadrupole (Q3). Thus, Q1 was locked on m/z 839; Q3 scan range: 100-900; step size: 0.5; dwell time: 1 ms; ion source voltage: 5.5 kV; orifice energy: 50; RNG = 400 V; Q0 = −10; RO1 = −14 V; RO2 = −55 V; RO3 = −63; CAD = 5 (collision gas = N2). To a sample (20 μl, 0.5 mg/ml) of 2FGlu-labeled digest was added concentrated ammonium hydroxide (5 μl). The mixture was incubated for 15 min at 50°C, acidified with 50% trifluoroacetic acid, and analyzed by ESMS using the same conditions as for the intact protein. Incubation of C. albicans Exg with 2FDNPGlc resulted in time-dependent inactivation of the enzyme. Data were consistent with the simple kinetic scheme shown below in which inactivation is a consequence of the accumulation of the glycosyl-enzyme intermediate E-I (Scheme II). Thus, the inactivation followed the expected pseudo-first order kinetics as seen in Fig. 1a Values for the inactivation rate constant (ki = 0.042 ± 0.002 min−1) and the dissociation rate constant (Ki = 1.49 ± 0.14 mM) were determined by direct fit to the kinetic expression as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A double-reciprocal plot of the pseudo-first order rate constants versus inhibitor concentration is shown in Fig. 1c Comparison of the Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameter for the substrate DNPGlc (Km = 2.2 ± 0.2 mM) with the Ki value for 2FDNPGlc indicates that replacement of the 2-hydroxyl by fluorine does not significantly affect ground state binding of the inactivator to the enzyme. Interestingly, no inactivation was observed for the 2-chloro analog of the inhibitor (2C1DNPG1c), as previously demonstrated with other glycosyl hydrolases (26Tull D. Miao S. Withers S.G. Aebersold R. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 27Staedtler P. Hoenig S. Frank R. Withers S.G. Hengstenberg W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 658-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Further, 2ClDNPGlc did not function as a substrate, no detectable hydrolysis over background being observed. 2ClDNPGlc was then tested as a competitive inhibitor against DNPGlc hydrolysis, and an approximate Ki of 0.7 ± 0.2 mM was determined. These results indicated that the 2ClDNPGlc can clearly bind, but the 2-chlorine prohibits not only turnover, but even formation of the glycosyl-enzyme intermediate. Incubation of Exg with 2FDNPGlc in the presence of a competitive inhibitor, BTGlc, resulted in reduction of the apparent inactivation rate constant (kobs) from 0.025 ± 0.001 min−1 to 0.0053 ± 0.0006 min−1 (Fig. 1b). These results indicate that the inactivator is active site-directed, and by analogy with results from β-glucosidase (28Withers S.G. Street I.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 8551-8553Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 29Withers S.G. Warren R.A.J. Street I.P. Rupitz K. Kempton J.B. Aebersold R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 5887-5889Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar), this indicates that inactivation is a consequence of the stabilization and trapping of the normal intermediate in catalysis. Evidence for the catalytic competence of the 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-glycosyl-enzyme intermediate was obtained by measuring the rates of spontaneous reactivation upon incubation in buffer at 37°C after removal of excess inactivator. The regain of activity (due to regeneration of free enzyme) followed a first order process, giving a reactivation rate constant of kreact = 0.0019 min−1, corresponding to a t1/2 of 526 min. The rate of reactivation was increased upon addition of BTGlc (a non-hydrolyzable glucoside) to the reaction mixture. This suggested that, as seen previously (9Miao S. Ziser L. Aebersold R.

These accessory proteins include a small, heat stable, thioredoxin-like protein moiety, referred to as protein-(SH)2 and which functions as a source of reducing equivalents and an unidentified flavoprotein (5del Campillo-Campbell A. Dykhuizen D. Cleary P.P. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 62: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The extensive characterization of BSO reductase has been limited by the low natural abundance of the protein, its constitutive expression, and the requirement for auxiliary proteins for activity coupled with the difficulty of its detection in the absence of specific antibodies. While the E. coli BSO reductase bisC structural gene has been cloned and sequenced, the enzyme has not been produced using heterologous expression systems.

R. sphaeroides f. sp. denitrificans IL 106 were the generous gift of Dr. T. Satoh (Hiroshima University). pUC19 was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim and the GST fusion protein expression vector, pGEX-5X-2, was purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. The entire 2.4-kilobase BSO reductase coding region was excised from the pUC19 construct (24Pollock V.V. Barber M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 322-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) using EcoRI and SalI restriction enzymes and cloned into the EcoRI and SalI sites of the pGEX-5X-2 expression vector. DNA sequencing was performed on this construct to confirm the proper junction sites and reading frame for the BSO reductase gene using the Sequenase Version 2 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) sequencing kit and [α-35S]dATP. Overnight cultures of E. coli JM109 transformed with either the pGEX-5X-2 vector containing the BSO reductase sequence, or the vector alone as a control, were diluted 1/100 in LB supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml final concentration) and sodium molybdate (1 mM final concentration) and grown at 37°C to an OD600 of 0.8. Isopropylthio-β-galactoside (0.1 mM final concentration) was added to induce protein expression and the cells were grown for an additional 4 h at 24° C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with dithiothreitol (10 mM), sodium molybdate (1 mM), aprotinin (0.1 mg/ml), EDTA (1 mM), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.1 mM), and sonicated on ice. The sonicated cells were centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min and the supernatant chromatographed on a glutathione-agarose affinity column (8-ml matrix volume) pre-equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline. Following several washes with phosphate-buffered saline, the bound fusion protein was eluted with 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, containing 10 mM GSSH, pH 8. Fractions exhibiting MV:BSOR activity were concentrated by pressure filtration (PM-10, Amicon) and stored in liquid nitrogen. Following cleavage with Factor Xa, the affinity-purified BSO reductase complex was re-chromatographed using glutathione-agarose to remove the GST portion of the fusion protein. Further purification of the BSO reductase to separate the enzyme from auxiliary proteins was achieved utilizing fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration on a Superose 12 column (1 × 30 cm, Pharmacia) in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8, and anion exchange on a Mono-Q column (0.5 × 5 cm) utilizing a salt gradient from 0 to 0.5 M NaCl. Untransformed E. coli JM 109 and ΔMu29 cells were grown in LB to an OD600 of 2.0, respectively. Cells were harvested and disrupted using identical methods to those described for the transformed cells and the supernatants assayed for both NADPH:BSOR and BSO-independent NADPH-oxidation activities, prior to and following dialysis, in 50 mM Tris, pH 8. R. sphaeroides cells were grown either aerobically in LB or anaerobically in the presence of 0.2% nitrate to an OD600 of 2.5, harvested, and processed as described for the E. coli cells. R. sphaeroides Me2SO reductase was isolated as described previously (1Barber M.J. Van Valkenburg H. Trimboli A.J. Pollock V.V. Neame P.J. Bastian N.R. Arch. Biochem.

Protein samples were subjected to cleavage by Factor Xa (1% w/w) in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, containing 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM CaCl2, pH 8, at 16° C for 16 h. BSO reductase purity was assessed by both SDS-PAGE and reverse-phase HPLC analysis. Enzyme samples (1-10 μg of total protein) were analyzed using either 10 or 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) stained with Coomassie Blue. For reverse-phase HPLC analysis, BSO reductase (30 μg) was mixed with an equal volume of 8 M guanidine hydrochloride, acidified with 0.5% acetic acid, and chromatographed on a C4 column (4.6 × 30 mm) using a linear gradient of trifluoroacetic acid (0.1%) to trifluoroacetic acid (0.1%), acetonitrile (70%). Samples of BSO reductase and Me2SO reductase were denatured with 1% SDS for 12 h followed by boiling for 20 min. The SDS was removed by precipitation with KCl (0.250 M), the samples centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min, and the denatured protein separated from the cofactor utilizing ultrafiltration spin columns (“ultrafree-MC” 5,000 MW cut-off, Millipore Corp.). The cofactor-containing solution was assayed for protein and its UV visible and fluorescence spectra recorded. For nucleotide pyrophosphatase cleavage, MgCl2, and lyophilized pyrophosphatase were added to the cofactor-containing solution which was incubated at 37°C for 15 min following which the cofactor was separated from the pyrophosphatase by ultrafiltration. NH2-terminal sequencing was performed as described by 24Pollock V.V. Barber M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 322-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar. For the generation and sequencing of internal peptides, protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transbloted onto nylon membranes, and subjected to in situ proteolytic cleavage. Excised membrane sections were first blocked with polyvinyl pyrrolidone (1% in methanol) for 30 min, extensively washed with water and immersed in 100 μl of protease digestion buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1% Triton X-100 and 10% acetonitrile). Endoproteinase Lys-C (1 μg) was added, and digestion continued at 37°C overnight. Following proteolysis, the peptide-containing solution was denatured with guanidine hydrochloride, acidified with acetic acid, and individual peptides separated by reverse-phase HPLC (Vydac C18 column, 4.6 × 250 mm) as described by 22Neame P.J.

The conversion of BSO to biotin was performed using MES buffer, pH 6 (140 μl of 114 mM), BSO (50 μl of 5 mg/ml), MV (500 μl of 100 mM in 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5, reduced with H2 and Pt-asbestos) and homogeneous BSO reductase (30 μl of 0.5 μg/μl). The buffer solution containing BSO was made anaerobic and extensively bubbled with argon. MV was added followed by the BSO reductase and the reaction allowed to proceed anaerobically until the MV had been depleted (about 5-10 min, final solution pH of 8). The reaction mixture was filtered (5,000 Mr cut-off ultrafiltration spin column) to separate the protein and reaction products and the latter subsequently analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC (Vydac C18 column, 4.6 × 250 mm) using a linear gradient of trifluoroacetic acid (0.05%, pH 2.5) to trifluoroacetic acid (0.05%, pH 2.5), acetonitrile (70:30, v/v) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Control reactions contained MV and buffer; BSO, MV and buffer; biotin (50 μl of 5 mg/ml), MV, and buffer; BSO, MV, heat-inactivated BSO reductase, and buffer, respectively. The disk microbiological assay was performed using a modified version of that previously described by 24Pollock V.V. Barber M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 322-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar. E. coli ΔMu29 (bio−, bis−, thi−), which cannot grow in the absence of biotin or in the presence of BSO and absence of biotin, was deposited onto minimal glucose plates supplemented with tetrazolium (0.0116%), thi (10 μg/ml), and str (75 μg/ml). The conversion of BSO to biotin was performed as described for the reverse-phase HPLC analysis of the BSO reductase reaction and the reaction products separated from the protein by ultrafiltration. Following dilution with water, aliquots (25 μl) of each reaction product were applied to filter disks placed on top of the minimal glucose plates containing E. coli ΔMu29. The plates were incubated at 37°C overnight and inspected for bacterial growth, detectable as the formation of red colonies surrounding the filter circles. BSO reductase activities were routinely determined at 600 nm under anaerobic conditions at 25°C in 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 8, as the oxidation of either MV (115 μM) or BV (115 μM) in the presence of BSO (1.7 mM). Concentrations of MV or BV were calculated using extinction coefficients of 13 mM−1 cm−1 (ε600 nm) (32Thorneley R.N.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 333: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and 13 mM−1 cm−1 (ε555 nm) (18Lissolo T. Pulvin S. Thomas D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11725-11729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Activities were expressed in units of micromole of BSO consumed per min/nmol of enzyme. Kinetic parameters were derived using the software “Enzfitter” (Elsevier Biosoft, Ferguson, MO). NADPH:BSOR and NADPH:FR activities, expressed as micromole of NADPH consumed per min/nmol of enzyme, were determined at 340 nm in 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 8.0, in the presence of either NADPH (250 μM) and BSO (1.7 mM) or NADPH (250 μM) and Fe(CN)63− (630 μM), respectively. NADPH:BSOR activity was also determined in the presence and absence of added E. coli or R. sphaeroides cell lysate supernatant, prior to and following dialysis of the supernatant. In addition, cell lysates were also assayed for endogenous NADPH oxidation, both in the presence and absence of BSO. BSO reduction to biotin was also monitored at 533 nm using the colorimetric reagent, p-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde (19McCormick D.B. Roth J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 34: 226-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). GST activities were determined at 340 nm and 25°C in 25 mM MOPS buffer, pH 7, in the presence of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (1 mM) and GSSH (0.5 mM) (10Habig W.H. Pabst M.J. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results of expression studies using E. coli harboring the GST-BSO reductase expression vector are shown in Fig. 1. Optimal expression of the soluble form of the GST-BSO reductase fusion protein was obtained using low concentrations of isopropylthio-β-galactoside (0.1 mM) coupled with bacterial culture at room temperature for 5 h. Elevated temperatures or longer growth periods resulted in decreased production of the soluble fusion protein and a corresponding increase in the formation of inclusion bodies. Under optimum expression conditions and compared to control cells containing the GST expression vector without the BSO reductase gene, the GST-BSO reductase fusion protein could be detected as the presence of an additional protein band of molecular mass approximately 106 kDa in both the pellet (Fig. 1, lane P) and soluble (Fig. 1, lane S) protein fractions. Quantitation of protein expression levels suggested that the soluble GST-BSO reductase fusion protein represented 2-3% of the total soluble protein while the insoluble form represented 8-10% of the pellet fraction. In comparison, control cells containing the vector alone produced a major, soluble, protein with a molecular mass of 26 kDa, that exhibited GST activity (data not shown). Under optimal conditions, the yield of purified BSO reductase protein corresponded to 1 mg from 8 liters of cells (8 g). The individual steps utilized to purify the BSO reductase to homogeneity together with the respective yields are indicated in Table I. The initial affinity purification of the soluble E. coli cell extract using glutathione-agarose resulted in the isolation of a complex protein mixture that exhibited both GST activity and MV:BSOR activity indicating the presence of the required fusion protein. Examination of the protein composition of this sample indicated the presence of four proteins, detected as individual bands corresponding to molecular masses of 106, 70, 60, and 26 kDa, respectively, following SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1, lane A, u). The high molecular mass band, corresponding to a molecular mass of 106 kDa, that occasionally appeared as a doublet following SDS-PAGE, was subsequently identified as the GST-BSO reductase fusion protein by a combination of Factor Xa proteolysis and its retention of both GST and MV:BSOR activity. However, this band was usually partially proteolyzed even without the addition of Factor Xa, evident as the presence of the small 26-kDa GST fragment. Following proteolysis with Factor Xa (Fig. 1, lane A, c), the 106-kDa band was converted to two bands with apparent molecular masses of 80 and 26 kDa, respectively, the former retaining MV:BSOR activity and the latter retaining GST activity. Direct analysis of the amino terminus of the 80-kDa protein yielded the sequence shown in Table II, confirming the identity of this protein as BSO reductase while the 26-kDa protein corresponded to the cleaved GST expression tag.Table I.Purification of recombinant R. sphaeroides BSO reductasePurification stepActivityProteinSpecific activityRecoveryFoldNADPHMV·+NADPHMV·+unitsaUnits: μmol of NADPH consumed/min (NADPH:BSO reductase activity).unitsbUnits: μmol of BSO consumed/min (MV:BSO reductase activity).mgunits/mgaUnits: μmol of NADPH consumed/min (NADPH:BSO reductase activity).units/mgbUnits: μmol of BSO consumed/min (MV:BSO reductase activity).%Cell supernatant52015.681.06.420.1931001.00Affinity chromatography40012.04.6087.02.617713.5Factor Xa cleavage34810.43.101123.356717.4Anion exchange3319.931.053159.466449.0Gel filtration3229.661.003229.666250.1a Units: μmol of NADPH consumed/min (NADPH:BSO reductase activity).b Units: μmol of BSO consumed/min (MV:BSO reductase activity).

These two additional proteins were tightly associated since they were only partially resolved by fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration of the complex (Fig. 1, lanes B and C). To confirm that the two auxiliary proteins bound specifically to BSO reductase and not the intact fusion protein, the isolated GST-BSO reductase fusion protein complex (Fig. 2, lane A) was treated with Factor Xa and affinity purified using glutathione-agarose. The flow-through from the column contained BSO reductase, identified by the retention of MV:BSOR activity, and both the 70- and 60-kDa auxiliary proteins (Fig. 2, lane B), whereas the cleaved GST portion remained bound to the column and could subsequently be eluted with GSSH as the sole protein (Fig. 2, lane C). BSO reductase could be resolved from the auxiliary proteins by ion exchange chromatography yielding a homogeneous enzyme (Fig. 2, lane D). The purity of the isolated BSO reductase obtained following ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography was also examined using reverse-phase HPLC. The HPLC chromatogram indicated the presence of a single protein peak corresponding to an elution time of 40.5 min (data not shown). To identify the 60-kDa auxiliary protein that bound to BSO reductase, the amino terminus of the protein was examined yielding the sequence shown in Table II. This sequence was identical to the first 15 residues (AAKDVKFGNDARVKM) of the E. coli groEL protein (14Hemmingsen S.M. Woolford C. van der Vies S.M. Tilly K. Dennis D.T. Georgopolus C.P. Hendrix R.V. Ellis R.J. Nature. 1988; 333: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). In contrast, we were unable to obtain any reliable sequence from the amino-terminal region of the 70-kDa protein. However, following proteolysis, three internal peptides were obtained which yielded the sequences shown in Table II, confirming the identity of this protein as E. coli hsp70 (2Bardwell J.C.A. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 848-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) and corresponding to residues 93-106 (IIAADNGDAWVEVK), 587-594 (KMQELAQV) and 598-616 (LMEIAQQQHAQQQTAGADA), respectively. Attempts to increase the level of soluble BSO reductase expression, by co-transformation of the JM109 cells with the groEL gene, failed to increase production of the soluble fusion protein-chaperonin complex. The UV-visible spectral characteristics of the native and SDS-treated BSO reductase and a sample of purified, oxidized R. sphaeroides Me2SO reductase are shown in Table III. Oxidized BSO reductase exhibited a protein peak at 278 nm with a broad shoulder centered around 370 nm with very little absorbance at higher wavelengths indicating the absence of any additional chromophores. Denaturation of both enzymes resulted in an increased intensity for both the dominant protein peak at 278 nm and increased resolution of the Mo cofactor peak, detected at approximately 375 nm, when compared to the spectra obtained for the native enzymes, consistent with cofactor release.Table IIIUV-visible spectral characteristics of BSO and Me2SO reductasesProteinAbsorbanceNativeSDS-treatedλ280λ375λ280λ375BSO reductase0.5900.0330.6730.082Me2SO reductase0.5910.0380.6860.089 Open table in a new tab UV CD spectra of both BSO reductase and Me2SO reductase were very similar and typical of proteins of the α/β class. BSO reductase exhibited a positive CD maximum at 192 nm and negative CD maxima at 209 and approximately 219 nm, respectively, whereas Me2SO reductase exhibited CD maxima at 192, 209, and 221 nm, respectively. To identify the Mo cofactor bound to the recombinant BSO reductase, the purified enzyme (Fig. 2, lane D) was denatured with SDS and the cofactor isolated. The UV-visible absorbance spectrum of the isolated Mo cofactor is shown in Fig. 3, together with the spectrum obtained from a corresponding sample of R. sphaeroides Me2SO reductase, a known MGD-containing enzyme (15Johnson J.L. Bastian N.R. Rajagopalan K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3190-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The spectrum of the isolated cofactor exhibited an additional peak at 249 nm due to absorption by the 5′-GMP portion of the cofactor. Identical results have previously been reported for Me2SO reductase by 15Johnson J.L. Bastian N.R. Rajagopalan K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3190-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar. To confirm the identity of the Mo cofactor as MGD, fluorescence emission spectra of the isolated cofactor, both prior to and following pyrophosphatase cleavage, were obtained and compared to those from a sample of cofactor isolated from Me2SO reductase. Incubation of the liberated MGD cofactor with pyrophosphatase, resulting in hydrolysis of the pyrophosphate linkage between the molybdopterin and 5′-GMP moieties, produced an increase in the fluorescence intensity (Table IV) of both samples with no shift in the fluorescence emission maxima which were determined to be 469 nm for the cofactor isolated from BSO reductase and 468 nm for MGD isolated from Me2SO reductase.Table IVFluorescence emission spectral data for BSO and Me2SO reductase Mo cofactorsProteinλmaxFluorescence intensity prior to pyrophosphatase cleavageFluorescence intensity following pyrophosphatase cleavagenmBSO reductase46957%90%Me2SO46854%83% Open table in a new tab The ability of the isolated BSO reductase to convert BSO to biotin, utilizing MV as an electron donor, was initially examined using reverse-phase HPLC analysis of the reaction products, as shown in Fig. 4. Under the conditions used for analysis, standard samples of BSO and biotin eluted at 9.2 min (peak 1, Trace C) and 18.7 min (peak 2, Trace B), respectively, while the large early peak present in all the elution profiles was due to the presence of MV. In the absence of BSO reductase or in the presence of heat-inactivated enzyme, none of the substrate was reduced to biotin (Traces C and D, respectively). However, in the presence of BSO reductase (Trace E), approximately 50% of the BSO was converted to biotin as evident by the decrease in the amplitude of the peak at 9.2 min and the appearance of the peak at 18.7 min due to biotin formation. HPLC analysis was also utilized to examine the conversion of BSO to biotin catalyzed by BSO reductase u"

The availability of a crystal structure of a fasciculin 2 (Fas2)-acetylcholinesterase complex affords an opportunity to examine in detail the interaction of this toxin with its target site. To this end, we constructed a synthetic fasciculin gene with an appropriate leader peptide for expression and secretion from mammalian cells. Recombinant wild-type Fas2, expressed and amplified in Chinese hamster ovary cells, was purified to homogeneity and found to be identical in composition and biological activities to the venom-derived toxin. Sixteen mutations at positions where the crystal structure of the complex indicates a significant interfacial contact point or determinant of conformation were generated. Two mutants of loop I, T8A/T9A and R11Q, ten mutants of the longest loop II, R24T, K25L, R27W, R28D, H29D, ΔPro30, P31R, K32G, M33A, and V34A/L35A, and two mutants of loop III, D45K and K51S, were expressed transiently in human embryonic kidney cells. Inhibitory potencies of the Fas2 mutants toward mouse AChE were established, based on titration of the mutants with a polyclonal anti-Fas2 serum. The Arg27, Pro30, and Pro31 mutants each lost two or more orders of magnitude in Fas2 activity, suggesting that this subset of three residues, at the tip of loop II, dominates the loop conformation and interaction of Fas2 with the enzyme. The Arg24, Lys32, and Met33 mutants lost about one order of magnitude, suggesting that these residues make moderate contributions to the strength of the complex, whereas the Lys25, Arg28, Val34-Leu35, Asp45, and Lys51 mutants appeared as active as Fas2. The Thr8-Thr9, Arg11, and His29 mutants showed greater ratios of inhibitory activity to immunochemical titer than Fas2. This may reflect immunodominant determinants in these regions or intramolecular rearrangements in conformation that enhance the interaction.

https://openalex.org/W1981897138,"<i>Drosophila yolk protein</i> genes are regulated by doublesex male protein (DSX<sup>M</sup>) in males and doublesex female protein (DSX<sup>F</sup>) in females. Both proteins bind to the same DNA sites from which DSX<sup>M</sup> represses and DSX<sup>F</sup> activates transcription. The proteins are identical through 397 NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal amino acids that include domains for oligomerization and DNA binding.

We report here mobility shift assays that examine the DNA binding properties of purified DSX<sup>M</sup> and DSX<sup>F</sup>. Dimers of DSX<sup>M</sup> and DSX<sup>F</sup> bind to a regulatory site, dsxA, with the same affinity (<i>K</i><sub>app</sub> = 0.2 nM), specificity (specific/nonspecific ≈ 1.2 × 10<sup>4</sup>), and dependence on monovalent and divalent cations. The DNA association rate constants also are indistinguishable (<i>k</i><sub>on</sub> = 4.6 × 10<sup>6</sup>M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) as are the several terms of the dissociation reaction. Dissociation has an intrinsic rate of <i>k</i><sub>off</sub> = 5.1 × 10<sup>−4</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> and other rate terms that depend on the free concentration of specific DNA binding sites (2.4 × 10<sup>4</sup>M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) or nonspecific binding sites (2.4 M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>). This first order dependence on unbound DNA suggests that a direct transfer between DNAs is likely to occur when DSX proteins search for specific sites in the many short open DNA regions of chromatin. Overall, dimer binding to individual DNA sites appears to be determined by the sex-nonspecific part of the two proteins. We infer that the sex-specific oligomerization domains play roles in binding cooperativity to multiple DNA sites or in other protein:protein interactions."

The Pax proteins make up a family of transcription factors involved in the regulation of cell morphogenesis and differentiation. The paired domain alone or in combination with the paired-type homeodomain, confers a novel DNA binding specificity (8Czerny T. Schaffner G. Busslinger M.

In this paper, we describe analyses of the human PAX6 promoter and upstream regulatory region and report the presence of multiple repressors and activators within the regulatory region. One of the repressive elements was a strong silencer (SX250) that could specifically repress PAX6 promoter activity in glioblastoma and HeLa cells. HeLa (a human cervical carcinoma cell line), U87 (a human glioblastoma cell line), and 293 (a human embryonic kidney cell line) were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 mM glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, K562 (a human chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line), and a normal human lymphoblastoid cell line were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 50 mM glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin. HBL100 (a human breast cell line) was grown in McCoy's 5a medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 50 mM glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin.

The PAX6 genomic clone cH1-7 (Ton et al., 1991) was isolated from a pWE15 cosmid library by screening with a 1.6-kb PAX6 cDNA (ph-12). Restriction endonuclease mapping revealed that cH1-7 contained a 36-kb insert. A 300-base pair (bp) probe derived from the 5′ end (from the HindIII site to the StuI site) of a human PAX6 cDNA clone (ph-12) was used to localize the most 5′ genomic sequence. A 6.5-kb EcoRI-XbaI genomic DNA fragment, which hybridized to the 300-bp ph-12 probe was cloned into pBluescript II KS (Stratagene). The insert was then further dissected to generate small overlapping subclones. The sequence of the 2.9 kb between the 5′-HindIII site and the 3′ end of exon 2 was determined by the dideoxy chain termination method. The sequence was analyzed for candidate transcription factor binding sites by using the Genetics Computer Group (Madison, WI) program. Total cellular RNA (30 μg) was hybridized with gel-purified labeled antisense transcripts (105 cpm). The probe was transcribed with T7 polymerase using [α-32P]CTP from a genomic fragment corresponding to the 5′ region of the PAX6 cDNA (−180 to +166 bp) cloned into the vector pBluescript SK+. The hybridization was carried out at 42°C overnight. Hybrids were digested for 30 min at 30°C with RNase A and T1 (ribonuclease protection assay kit, Ambion). The sizes of the protected fragments were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel using a DNA sequencing ladder as size marker. A 33-mer antisense primer corresponding to bases +133 to +101 of the human PAX6 cDNA sequence was end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase using [γ-32P]ATP. Total cellular RNA (15 μg) was hybridized with 105 cpm of the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide by heating at 90°C for 5 min in 20 μl of hybridization buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, 150 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA) and then immediately incubated at 42°C overnight. The DNA-RNA hybrid was then collected by ethanol precipitation and dissolved in 20 μl of reverse transcription buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM dNTP). The primer was extended by SuperScript™ II RNaseH− Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 42°C for 1 h. After completion of the reaction, samples were extracted with phenol-chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and analyzed on 6% polyacrylamide gel. The sequencing ladder was done with the same primer used for primer extension, and the DNA template is a genomic fragment corresponding to the 5′ region of the human PAX6 gene. DNA fragment (6.5-kb EcoRI-XbaI) derived from the 5′-flanking region clone described above was inserted immediately upstream from the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene in the promoterless and enhancerless CAT expression vector pCAT-basic (Promega). We then made a series of CAT expression constructs that contained various lengths of the 5′-upstream sequence of the PAX6 gene and had the same 3′ end, the NaeI site in exon 1. DNA fragments for minimal promoter analyses were prepared by PCR amplification with the following oligonucleotides: 5′-CCCAAGCTTCGGCTGGCGCGAGGCC-3′ (bases −66 to −50) for the 5′ ends of the PAX6 inserts and 5′-GCTCTAGAGTCATCATCCTCCAGCA-3′ (bases +93 to +109), 5′-GCTCTAGACCCACTAATCACTCCG-3′ (bases +13 to +29) for the 3′ end of the PAX6 inserts. The amplified products were digested with HindIII and XbaI and inserted immediately upstream of the CAT reporter gene in the vector's multiple cloning site. A 1147-bp HindIII-PstI (bases −2404 to −1256) fragment was amplified by PCR and inserted downstream of the CAT gene, which was driven by a 346-bp SmaI-NaeI PAX6 promoter fragment. A series of deletions from the 5′ and 3′ ends were generated by PCR with the 5′ primers and 3′ primers. The PCR fragments were digested with BamHI and BglII and inserted into the BamHI site of the PAX6 promoter construct pCSMNA. 5′ primers: 5′-CGGGATCCTCGGAAAGAAGCAGCC-3′, 5′-CGGGATCCCTCTGCCAAGTACCG-3′, 5′-CGGGATCCCATCAGGCCTTCGG-3′, and 5′-CGGGATCCAAACTCTCTCTTTC-3′; and 3′ primers: 5′-CGGGATCCCAGGGTCTGCAAA-3′ and 5′-GAAGATCTGCTTGACCGGGGAA-3′. CAT expression constructs were transfected into cells growing in monolayers or suspension by electroporation. 20 μg of plasmid DNA and 5 μg of internal control (pSV-β-gal) were electroporated normally into 5 × 106 cells in 0.3 ml of culture medium with a Bio-Rad gene pulser at 260 V and 960 microfarads. The transfected cells were harvested after 48 h, and cell lysates were prepared by three cycles of freezing and thawing. The β-galactosidase activity was determined by the method of 31Rosenthal N. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 704-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, and the protein concentration was determined with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Aliquots of cell extracts containing 30-50 μg of protein were used for the CAT assay. The acetylated chloramphenicol was separated from the unacetylated form by thin-layer chromatography in chloroform:methanol (97:3, v/v). The acetylated [14C]chloramphenicol was quantitated with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The CAT activity of each construct was determined with at least three independent transfection assays and normalized to the β-galactosidase activity. Nuclear extracts were prepared following the method described by 34Schreiber E. Mattias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17Crossref Scopus (3918) Google Scholar. The nuclei were isolated following the disruption of cells by the addition of 0.4% Nonidet P-40 after being swollen on ice in the lysis buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.0 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.0 μ/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 mg/ml benzamidine). The nuclear pellet was resuspended in nuclear extraction buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.0 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.0 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 mg/ml benzamidine) and centrifuged for 5 min at 4°C, and the supernatant (nuclear extracts) was stored at −70°C. The in vitro translated protein and nuclear extracts were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, electrotransferred to nitrocellulose, probed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against the full-length PAX6 protein, and detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Corp.). The nucleotide sequence of the human PAX6 promoter has been deposited in GenBank™ (accession number U63833). A human genomic library constructed in the cosmid vector pWE15 was screened with a 1.6-kb human PAX6 cDNA probe. Cosmid cH1-7 was selected and found to contain the first seven exons of the PAX6 gene. cH1-7 spans 36 kb, including 24 kb of the untranscribed 5′ sequence. cH1-7 was subcloned into pBluescript II SK+ and further analyzed by Southern blotting and restriction mapping (Fig. 1). The genomic structure obtained is similar to that reported by 11Glaser T. Walton D.S. Maas R.L. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar. Sequence analysis of the 5′ end of the clone (Fig. 2) revealed two untranslated exons (exons 1 and 2) separated by a 99-bp first intron. The translational start site was located in exon 4.Fig. 2Nucleotide sequence of the human PAX6 gene spanning transcriptional start site.

For this purpose we used both primer extension and RNase protection analysis. A 5′-labeled 33-mer antisense primer (corresponding to position +133 to +101) was used for primer extension and hybridized to total RNA isolated from PAX6-expressing cells and non-PAX6-expressing cells. A single 134-bp primer extension product was generated in three PAX6-expressing cells (U87, K562, and HeLa cells) but not in the Y79 cells that do not contain endogenous PAX6 mRNA (Fig. 3A). By comparison with a DNA ladder generated on a genomic plasmid by the same oligonucleotide primer, the transcriptional initiation site was located 108 bp upstream from the beginning of the reported longest cDNA sequence (11Glaser T. Walton D.S. Maas R.L. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). This result was confirmed by the RNase protection assay (Fig. 3B). A 32P-labeled antisense RNA probe corresponding to a 346-bp SmaI-NaeI fragment containing the 66-bp published 5′-terminal sequence was used to hybridize with 15 μg of total RNA isolated from PAX6-expressing cells and nonexpressing cells. A single protected fragment of approximately 166 bp was observed in PAX6-expressing cells but not in non-PAX6-expressing cells. In addition to primer extension and RNase protection analyses, we also carried out a 5′ RACE assay of the isolated total RNA from PAX6-expressing cell lines (data not shown). Using this experiment, the primer extended cDNA sequence exactly matched with the published 5′-terminal sequence and the adjacent 5′ genomic sequence. RNase protection and 5′ RACE assays both indicate that no intron sequence is located between the initiation site and the identified 5′ cDNA sequence. Therefore, the transcriptional start site was positioned 100 bp upstream of the beginning of the identified longest cDNA and numbered base +1. Sequence analyses of the 2.9-kb upstream promoter region (Fig. 2) from the HindIII site to the end of exon 2 revealed a TATA-like sequence (ATATTTT) located 26 bp from the initiation site, and two CCAAT boxes located −70 and −100 bp, respectively. The position of TATA-like box and CCAAT boxes are consistent with those found in other eukaryotes. A third consensus sequence (PyAPyPyPy), a pyrimidine-rich initiator element, is also found at the PAX6 transcriptional start site (3Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3298) Google Scholar et al 1981; 4Burley S.K. Roeder R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 769-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar et al 1996). Several putative transcriptional regulatory consensus sequences (10Faisst S. Meyer S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar) were identified within the NotI-NaeI proximal promoter region (at bases −452 to +166), including single binding sites for Sp1 protein (at bases −395 to −387), Myc protein (at bases −379 to −373), PuF protein (at bases −410 to −405), CCCT binding factor (at bases −334 to −329), and TCF-2 (at bases +81 to +86). In addition, we found two consensus TCF-1 binding sites (at bases +33 to +37 and −348 to −344), three potential binding sites for activator protein-2 (AP2) (at bases −51 to −44, −145 to −136, and −281 to −274), and four potential candidate binding sites for GCF (at bases −450 to −444, −392 to −386, −236 to −230, and −49 to −43). A 38-bp poly(CA) sequence was located at bases −992 to −955. To examine the PAX6 promoter activity and identify important regulatory domains within the 5′ region, a series of fragments with 5′ and 3′ deletions in the 5′ region of the PAX6 gene were ligated upstream of the bacterial CAT gene in the promoterless and enhancerless CAT expression vector pCAT-basic (Fig. 4A). These CAT constructs were tested for promoter activity by transfection into U87, K562, and NIH 3T3 cells. For comparison, the cells were also transfected with two control CAT constructs, one with a simian virus 40 promoter and enhancer (pCAT-control) and one without promoter and enhancer (pCAT-basic). The β-galactosidase-expressing vector pSV-β-gal was used as an internal control for transfection efficiency, and CAT activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Fig. 4 shows the structures of the deletion constructs and their promoter activity determined by transient expression assays. The longest construct, pCENA-b (bases −4900 to +166), had high promoter activity in both U87 and K562 cells (Fig. 4B). The 1.4-kb PstI-NaeI construct (pCPNA, bases −1254 to +166) had a very high level of CAT activity in K562 and U87 cells. It is interesting that the 346-bp SmaI-NaeI fragment (pCSMNA, bases −180 to +166) had the highest CAT activity in U87 and K562 cells. Further deletion to the BstXI site, which contained two CCAAT motifs, still exhibited a very high promoter activity in U87 cells. The deletion data indicate that these two CCAAT motifs are not critical to the PAX6 promoter activity, because deleting them from pCSMNA did not substantially affect its promoter activity. However, the deletion of the 3′ 228-bp BstXI-NaeI fragment (construct pCPBS) from pCPNA dramatically decreased the promoter activity to the basal level in both U87 and K562 cells. This indicates that the 228-bp BstXI-NaeI fragment, which contained the initiation sites, was required for normal PAX6 promoter activity. Deletion of a 2.4-kb EcoRI-HindIII fragment from pCENA to form pCHNA caused a 9-fold decrease in CAT activity in U87 cells but not in K562 cells. Deletion of a 1.1-kb HindIII-PstI fragment from pCHNA to form pCPNA caused a 16-fold increase in CAT activity in U87 cells but only a 2-fold increase in K562 cells. This suggested that there was a strong repressor between the HindIII and PstI sites that could regulate cell type-specific expression of the PAX6 gene. Further deletion of the 0.7-kb PstI-SacII fragment from pCPNA to form pCSANA caused 3-fold and 2.5-fold decreases in CAT activity in K562 and U87 cells, respectively. The deletion of a 363-bp SacII-SmaI fragment from pCSANA to form pCSMNA produced 3.5-fold increases in CAT activity in K562 and U87 cells. These results indicated that there is an activator sequence between the PstI and SacII sites and a repressor between the SacII and SmaI sites, and these regulatory elements were active in both K562 and U87 cells. However, the activator between the EcoRI and HindIII sites was only active in U87 cells, and the strong repressor between the HindIII and PstI sites functioned differently in U87 and K562 cells. The multiple activators and repressors in the 4.9-kb upstream promoter region may function differently in combination and in different cells. To determine the tissue specificity of the PAX6 promoter, murine and human cell lines of different origins were tested for promoter activity by using the constructs pCHNA and pCPNA. PAX6 promoter activity was detected in cell lines that expressed PAX6 mRNA (as revealed by Northern blotting, Fig. 5), including U87 glioblastoma cells, K562 erythroleukemia cells, 293 kidney cells, and HeLa cells (data not shown). No CAT activity was observed in cell lines that did not express pax6 mRNA, including NIH 3T3 murine fibroblast cells and HBL100 cells (data not shown). To confirm the expression of PAX6 protein in cell lines, we did Western analysis (Fig. 5B). The in vitro translated PAX6 protein was made from a human PAX6 expression construct (RC-CMV-PAX6) in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine. The result revealed a major 46-kDa band in U87 cells, K562 cells, and HeLa cells but not in NIH 3T3 cells. The rabbit anti-PAX6 serum (Tang et al., in press) can specifically recognize the PAX6 protein, because no cross-interaction was observed using an in vitro translated PAX8 protein. The size of the in vitro translated PAX6 protein is consistent with the predicted molecular weight of 46,500 for the 422-amino acid human PAX6 protein. The human PAX6 transcripts are well correlated with the protein level, indicating that PAX6 expression is mainly controlled at the transcriptional level, at least in the cell lines tested. Functional analysis of the PAX6 promoter region showed that the 228-bp BstXI-NaeI fragment (bases −62 to +166, pCBSNA) had very high CAT activity (Fig. 4B), especially in U87 cells. Four potential transcriptional factor binding sites in this region were identified in the nucleotide sequence, including AP2, GCF, TCF-1, and TCF-2 (Fig. 2). The relative activity of the 3′ deletion constructs created by PCR amplification was tested in U87 and K562 cells (Fig. 6). The 3′ deletion of bases +109 to +166 (pCHX-176) resulted in a nearly 50% decrease in promoter activity in both U87 and K562 cells, indicating that the 57-bp sequence (bases +109 to +166) contained a positive regulatory element or elements for PAX6 promoter function. Further deletion of the 79-bp 3′ fragment (bases +30 to +109, pCHX-95) still retained appreciable promoter activity. These observations demonstrated that sequences both upstream and downstream of the transcriptional start sites are required for PAX6 promoter activity. From the deletion analysis, we can conclude that the 92-bp sequence flanking the TATA-like box and the initiation start site is important for promoter activity. The TATA-like sequence (ATATTTT) identified in human PAX6 promoter is similar to that found in the quail pax6 promoter (ATATTAA) (28Plaza S. Dozier C. Saule S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 1041-1050PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the 5′ deletion constructs shown in Fig. 4 suggested the presence of a repressor between the HindIII and PstI sites (−2404 to −1256). This repressor repressed the PAX6 promoter in U87 cells but not in K562 cells. We then tested the repressive activity of this 1.1-kb fragment when it was inserted downstream of the PAX6 promoter. The fragment acted on the PAX6 promoter and a SV40 promoter as a strong repressor in a position- and orientation-independent manner in U87 cells but not in K562 cells (data not shown). Next, we dissected the 1.1-kb repressor to more precisely locate the sequence responsible for its repressive activity. After deletion of the 5′ 406-bp sequence (bases −2404 to −1998) from the 1.1-kb fragment, the remaining 730 bp (SX730) showed repressor activity in both U87 and HeLa cells but not in K562 cells (Fig. 7, A and B). Further dissection analysis of the 730-bp fragment showed that the 5′ 481-bp region (bases −1998 to −1519, SX480) had no repressor activity in all the cell lines tested, but the 3′ 250 bp (bases −1518 to −1268, SX250) caused a 2.5-fold decrease of CAT activity in both U87 and HeLa cells. The repressor activity was absent when the 250-bp sequence was split into two overlapping 5′ and 3′ fragments. Because the 5′ SX45 and 3′ SX54 (Fig. 7A) have a 31-bp overlap sequence, it is likely that cis-elements upstream and downstream of the 31-bp region are required for the repressor activity. The 250-bp repressor sequence functions equally well in either orientation (Fig. 7B). These results demonstrate that more than 31 bp overlap sequence is required for its repressor activity, and it functions as a cell type-specific silencer. Sequence analysis of the 250-bp silencer showed several transcription factor binding sites, but no potential binding site within 31 bp overlapped sequence (Fig. 7C). In this study, we report the isolation and characterization of the human PAX6 promoter. A 92-bp basal promoter (bases −62 to +30) was able to drive transcription of a CAT reporter gene in PAX6-expressing glioblastoma and erythroleukemia cell lines. The promoter activity was well correlated with the expression level of endogenous PAX6, and high CAT activity was found in cell lines with high levels of PAX6 transcripts. Deletion analysis of the 346-bp fragment (−180 to +166, pCSMNA) indicates that multiple cis-elements located upstream and downstream of the initiation start site are responsible for high level basal promoter activity and cell specificity. The 346-bp PAX6 minimal promoter region contains a single consensus binding site for the transcription factors TCF-1, TCF-2, and GCF and two binding sites for the AP2 protein. The PAX6 promoter has a typical initiator element, a TATA-like sequence and two CCAAT boxes at positions −70 and −100. This structure is similar to that of many tissue-specific genes that have a typical TATA box and initiator sequences (1Arcioni L. Simeone A. Guazzi S. Zappavigna V. Boncinelli E. Mavilio F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar; 19Hu Y. Kazenwadel J. James R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27214-27225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the quail pax6 promoter has been well characterized, we did sequence comparison of the 2.9-kb human PAX6 promoter and the quail 1.5-kb pax6 promoter (28Plaza S. Dozier C. Saule S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 1041-1050PubMed Google Scholar). Like many TATA box containing gene, they both have a TATA-like box and CCAAT box(es) in the corresponding position. One of the most intriguing results of the functional analysis of the PAX6 upstream region was the discovery of multiple repressors and activators. A series of 5′ deletions of these cis-regulatory elements altered promoter activity (Fig. 4). The various cis-regulatory elements had various levels of activity in different cell lines. No single cis-element was shown to be essential for PAX6 transcriptional activation. The tissue-specific and temporal expression of the PAX6 gene may be controlled by a combination of different cis-regulatory elements upstream and downstream of the initiation site. The cis-regulatory regions of the Drosophila paired box genes prd, gsb, and gsbn (22Li X. Noll M. Nature. 1994; 367: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) control the temporal and spatial expression of functionally equivalent genes. The three paired box genes play different roles during early embryogenesis and are controlled by cis-regulatory elements. All pax genes contain a very conserved paired domain and bind to a consensus recognition sequence (8Czerny T. Schaffner G. Busslinger M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2048-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar; 9Epstein J. Cai J. Glaser T. Jepeal L. Maas R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8355-8361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that several pax genes also have some redundant functions as do the homeobox genes. Therefore, some cis-regulatory elements may be responsible for the functional diversity of the pax genes. This hypothesis can be confirmed by mutation analysis of candidate cis-regulatory elements in aniridia patients. These elements can be positive or negative, because either haploinsufficiency or overdosage of PAX6 protein can cause eye defects (33Schedl A. Ross A. Lee M. Engelkamp D. Rashbass P. van Heyningen V. Hastie N.D. Cell. 1996; 86: 71-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). So far, less than half of the aniridia patients examined have been found to have mutations in the coding region of the PAX6 gene. 2Z.-P. Xu and G. F. Saunders, unpublished data. It is likely that some of the unidentified mutations are present in regulatory elements. This is the case for the Drosophila pax6 (eyeless) gene, in which two eyeless phenotypes were found to be caused by mutation in a 200-bp cis-regulatory element (30Quiring R. Walldorf U. Kloter U. Gehring W.J. Science. 1994; 265: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). Transient transfection analysis of the PAX6 promoter constructs showed that there is a transcriptional (silencer) in the upstream region. This silencer (bases −1518 to −1268) had different activities in different cell lines (U87, HeLa, and K562 cells). Sequence analysis showed multiple potential transcription factor binding sites in the silencer region (Fig. 7C). One binding site for GCF, a negative regulator of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene (21Kageyama R. Pastan I. Cell. 1989; 59: 815-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), was identified in the silencer region. Notochord transplantation experiments indicated that signals produced by the notochord can repress the region-specific expression of pax6 in the developing spinal cord (12Goulding M.D. Lumsden A. Gruss P. Development. 1993; 117: 1001-1016PubMed Google Scholar). It was suggested that one of the signal molecules, activin A, is involved in the dorsal and ventral down-regulation of pax6 gene expression (27Pituello F. Yamada G. Gruss P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6952-6956Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Another signal molecule, sonic hedgehog, appears to either directly or indirectly inhibit the expression of PAX6 (24MacDonald R. Barth K.A. Xu Q. Holder N. Mikkola I. Wilson S.W. Development. 1995; 121: 3267-3278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cell-specific silencer in combination with other positive and negative elements may contribute to tissue-specific and temporal expression of the PAX6 gene.

The sigma (σ) subunit provides selectivity for transcription initiation by interacting with the −10 and −35 elements of promoter DNA. Suppressor mutations in σ factor that compensate for specific “down” substitutions in the promoter have demonstrated that σ factor recognizes certain base pairs of the promoter. Since these suppressors were only identified for changes at the −12 and −11 positions of the −10 element (TAAT), the role of the other base pairs of this region in specifying recognition by σ factor remained unclear.

A mismatch bubble from −10 to +3 is bound regardless of the sequence within the bubble, or the presence or absence of a −35 element.

Nature. 1969; 221: 43-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 2Burgess R.R. Travers A.A. Fed. Proc. 1970; 29: 1164-1169PubMed Google Scholar). σ factor directs holoenzyme (α2ββ′σ) to the recognition sequences upstream of the transcription start site, and it is required for strand opening on circular DNA (3Saucier J. Wang J. Nat. New Biol. 1972; 239: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A variety of different σ subunits is available for positive regulation of gene expression in response to environmental stimuli (4Gross C.A. Lonetto M. Losick R. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 129-176Google Scholar). Each σ subunit recognizes a distinct DNA sequence and thereby confers selectivity for initiation upon RNA polymerase. The σ subunits are evolutionarily and functionally related. The largest family comprises those most similar to the primary σ factor from E. coli, σ70 (5Lonetto M. Gribskov M. Gross C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3843-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). Members of this family utilize promoters that comprise two hexameric DNA sequences at approximately −35 and −10 relative to the start point of transcription (6Hawley D.K. McClure W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 6381-6385Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 7Harley C.B. Reynolds R.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 2343-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). For σ70, the consensus promoter consists of TTGACA centered at −35 separated by 17 base pairs from TATAAT centered at −10. Deviations from consensus usually result in reduced promoter activity (8Youderian P. Bouvier S. Susskind M.M. Cell. 1982; 30: 843-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 9Moyle H. Waldburger C. Susskind M.M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1944-1950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One exception is the “extended −10” promoter, where an additional TGn is found immediately preceding the −10 hexamer, and a good match to the −35 consensus is not required for activity (10Backendorf C.

During initiation, base pairing of the promoter in the region from approximately −10 to +2 is disrupted and a transcriptionally competent open complex is formed (16Siebenlist U. Nature. 1979; 279: 651-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 17Siebenlist U. Simpson R.B. Gilbert W.

The precise role of σ factor in this process is not clear, but σ factor cross-links between −10 and +1 on the non-template strand (20Simpson R.B. Cell. 1979; 18: 277-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 21Buckle M. Buc H. Transcription: Mechanisms and Regulation. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994Google Scholar). Recently, σ70 holoenzyme has been shown to recognize the non-template strand of the −10 sequence in a melted transcription bubble (22Roberts C.W. Roberts J.W. Cell. 1996; 86: 495-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Others have proposed that σ factor stabilizes the single-stranded DNA in the open complex by interacting with chemical groups in the non-template strand (23DeHaseth P.L. Helmann J.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence analysis has revealed four highly conserved regions within the σ70 family (Fig. 1; Refs. 4Gross C.A. Lonetto M. Losick R. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 129-176Google Scholar, 5Lonetto M. Gribskov M. Gross C. J.

Biochem. 1988; 57: 839-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Region 1.1 inhibits DNA binding by the C-terminal DNA binding domains of σ70 in the absence of the core subunits (α2ββ′), and may physically interact with amino acids in or near the region 4 helix-turn helix domain at the C terminus (27Dombroski A.J. Walter W.A. Gross C. Cell. 1992; 70: 501-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 28Dombroski A.J. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2446-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that holoenzyme containing a σ70 derivative, which lacks Region 1.1, is significantly slower in progressing from the initial closed complex to a strand-separated initially transcribing complex. Additionally, if both Regions 1.1 and 1.2 are missing from σ70, holoenzyme is arrested in the first closed complex. 1Wilson, C., and Dombroski, A. J. (1997) J. Mol. Biol., in press. Region 2.4 recognizes the −10 hexamer (29Siegele D.A. Hu J.C. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 30Zuber P. Healy J. Carter III, H.L.

Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3282-3290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and recent studies suggest that region 2.3 may participate in the DNA melting stage of initiation (34Juang Y.-L. Helmann J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1470-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 35Rong J.C. Helmann J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5218-5224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Region 4.2 is involved in recognition of the −35 hexamer (27Dombroski A.J. Walter W.A. Gross C. Cell. 1992; 70: 501-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 29Siegele D.A.

Biol. 1989; 206: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), while region 4.1 has been proposed to contact certain transcriptional activators during initiation (37Makino K. Amemura M. Kim S.-K. Nakata A. Shinagawa H. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 38Li M. Moyle H. Susskind M.M.

The initial assignment of DNA recognition regions to the σ polypeptide was accomplished using genetic analyses, starting with point mutations in the −10 or −35 hexamers that severely reduced promoter activity. Suppressor mutations in σ factor, which improved utilization of promoter “down” mutations in the −10 hexamer, localized to region 2.4 (29Siegele D.A. Hu J.C. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 30Zuber P. Healy J. Carter III, H.L. Cutting S. Moran Jr., C.P. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 31Daniels D. Zuber R. Losick R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8075-8079Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 32Waldburger C. Gardella T. Wong R. Susskind M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mutations were only obtained for suppression of the first two positions of the hexamer. There are several possible explanations for this observation. The σ subunit may only interact with the first two positions of the hexamer, or the search for suppressor mutations was not saturating, or mutations that affect recognition of the +1 proximal positions are lethal. Thus, in this report a direct evaluation of how σ70 interacts with the −10 sequences of the promoter was conducted. Using a partial polypeptide of σ70 and derivatives of the tac promoter, several aspects of promoter recognition by σ in the absence of the core subunits of RNA polymerase have been addressed. First, the importance of each position in the −10 hexamer was evaluated. Second, the requirements for interaction with an extended −10 promoter were examined in the presence and absence of a −35 hexamer. Finally, the role of single-stranded DNA was assessed both alone, and as a component of a mismatch bubble. Restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA polymerase, T4 DNA ligase, and T4 polynucleotide kinase were from New England Biolabs or Promega. Taq DNA polymerase was from Perkin Elmer or Fisher Scientific. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Corp. Nitrocellulose filter discs (24 mm) were from Schleicher & Schuell or Millipore. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by either Genosys or Bioserve Biotechnology. 2Sequences are available from the author upon request. Single-stranded M13mp19ptac (27Dombroski A.J. Walter W.A.

Synthetic oligonucleotides (15-10-mers) were used according to Kunkel et al. (40Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A.

The “bubble” promoters, bub1/2, bub3/4, bub1/2GC, bub3/4GC, bub3/4-11C, and bub3/4-12G were constructed by annealing two oligonucleotides each 100 nucleotides in length. The annealing mixtures contained 50 μg of each oligonucleotide in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM EDTA, and 200 mM NaCl. The mixture was heated to 90°C in a heat block and allowed to cool slowly to room temperature. The efficiency of annealing was assessed on a 3% Metaphor agarose (FMC) gel. All of the promoter variants with a deletion of the −35 element, as well as the variants of ptac-ext-10 with point mutations were constructed using PCR for directed mutagenesis (41Ito W. Ishiguro H. Kurosawa Y. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 102: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Primer III was complementary to primer IV. In step 1, Primers I plus IV and Primers II plus III were used to produce a segment of the final DNA product using the next previous generation of promoter variant as the template. The products of the step 1 PCR (protocol as described in the following section) were purified using the Qiaquick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN). A mixture of 5 μl of each of these products was used in a subsequent PCR step (step 2) with no additional template for two cycles. Primers I and II were then added and PCR continued for 35 more cycles. The products were purified either with the Qiaquick PCR purification kit or, in some cases, if desired band was agarose gel-isolated, purified with the Qiaquick gel extraction kit. Oligonucleotides for PCR amplification of the ptac derivatives were complementary to sequences upstream and downstream of ptac such that the promoter was approximately centered within a 100-base pair length of DNA. One of the oligonucleotides was 5′-end-labeled with 32P as already described and used to generate radioactive specific DNA (27Dombroski A.J. Walter W.A. Gross C. Cell. 1992; 70: 501-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Labeled ptac and unlabeled competitor DNA were synthesized by PCR using 10-15 ng of template (replicative form of M13mp19ptac derivatives), 50 pmol of each primer, 10 × Taq buffer A from Fisher Scientific, and 2.5 units of either Ampli-Taq (Perkin Elmer) or Taq (Fisher) DNA polymerase in a 100-μl reaction. A Perkin Elmer Thermocycler was programmed for 35 cycles employing 94°C for denaturation, 55°C for annealing, and 72°C for extension with a time of 1 min for each segment. The product was purified using the Qiaquick PCR DNA purification kit (QIAGEN), and visualized on a 3% Metaphor agarose (FMC) gel. A fusion protein between regions 2-4 of σ70 and GST, GSTσ(360), was used to conduct all filter binding experiments. The construction and purification of this protein has been described in detail elsewhere (27Dombroski A.J. Walter W.A. Gross C. Cell. 1992; 70: 501-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Equilibrium competition binding assays were performed to measure the reduction in filter retention of [32P]ptac/GSTσ(360) complexes as a function of increasing unlabeled competitor DNA (mutated versions of ptac). Binding mixtures contained 100 pM [32P]ptac and various amounts of unlabeled competitor DNA in binding buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 14 mM potassium acetate, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.03% Triton X-100, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). GSTσ(360) was added to 1 nM, followed by incubation at 37°C for 20 min. The mixture was filtered through 24-mm nitrocellulose filters using a Hoefer model FH224V filter manifold, followed by one wash with wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM dithiothreitol). The filters were dried and subjected to liquid scintillation counting using Ultima gold (Packard). Background DNA retention was typically 5-10% of the total and was subtracted from the values obtained for retention of complexes. All data represent the average of 2-10 duplicate experiments. On any particular day, and for any set of competitors, ptac and ΔP were always included as control competitors. Additionally, the same experiments were repeated on different days with different preparations of both DNA and protein, for every competitor. Thus, the average values presented account for the variability inherent in the filter binding measurements. As a result, the ptac and ΔP curves are the same in each figure. A more detailed discussion of this assay has been published previously (27Dombroski A.J. Walter W.A. Gross C. Cell. 1992; 70: 501-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Genetic analysis of σ function as part of the holoenzyme complex demonstrated that the first two positions of the −10 hexamer (TATAAT) were important specifically for promoter recognition by the σ subunit of RNA polymerase (29Siegele D.A. Hu J.C. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 30Zuber P. Healy J. Carter III, H.L. Cutting S. Moran Jr., C.P. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 31Daniels D. Zuber R. Losick R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1990; 215: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 33Kenney T.J. Moran Jr., C.P. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3282-3290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The remaining four positions are clearly important for holoenzyme function, since mutations at any of these sites can severely affect promoter activity (8Youderian P. Bouvier S. Susskind M.M. Cell. 1982; 30: 843-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 9Moyle H. Waldburger C. Susskind M.M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1944-1950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These positions may be important for aspects of initiation beyond promoter recognition. For example, cross-linking studies have indicated that the β and β′ subunits are associated with DNA in the transcription complex (42Harrison C.A. Turner D.H. Hinkle D.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 2399-2414Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 43Hillel Z. Wu C.-W. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 2954-2961Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 44Brodolin K.L. Studitsky V.M. Mirzabekov A.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5748-5753Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this study, the interactions between σ factor and each position of the −10 hexamer were examined in the absence of the core subunits of polymerase. We previously used equilibrium competition binding assays to show that partial polypeptides of σ70, lacking the N-terminal inhibitory domain, interact preferentially with promoter DNA (27Dombroski A.J. Walter W.A. Gross C. Cell. 1992; 70: 501-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 45Dombroski A.J. Johnson B.D. Lonetto M. Gross C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8858-8862Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In those experiments a 100-base pair DNA fragment carrying the tac promoter was mixed with increased amounts of unlabeled competitor DNA, and a fixed amount of σ polypeptide. Retention of σ·DNA complexes on nitrocellulose filters served as a measure of DNA binding. A reduction in binding to the labeled DNA by one-half required addition of either an equivalent amount of unlabeled promoter DNA or a 5-8-fold excess of unlabeled non-promoter DNA. Since the actual size of the binding site is unknown, an accurate determination of selectivity on a per-site basis cannot be ascertained. Thus, selectivity is at least 5-fold and could be as high as several hundredfold (27Dombroski A.J. Walter W.A. Gross C. Cell. 1992; 70: 501-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Mutations were generated at each of the six positions from −12 to −7 (TATAAT) within the −10 hexamer of the tac promoter (46Amann E. Brosius J. Ptashne M. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 25: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) to investigate their relative importance (Table I). Equivalent substitutions have been shown previously to result in severe promoter down phenotypes in vivo (8Youderian P. Bouvier S. Susskind M.M. Cell. 1982; 30: 843-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 9Moyle H. Waldburger C. Susskind M.M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1944-1950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of the −10 mutant promoters to compete with the unaltered wild type tac promoter for binding to a partial σ70 polypeptide carrying both DNA binding domains fused to glutathione S-transferase, GSTσ(360), was tested in vitro Fig. 2 shows that mutations at −7, −8, or −9 had no effect on the ability of the unlabeled competitor DNA to compete with [32P]ptac for binding to GSTσ(360). These mutated promoters competed as well as unlabeled ptac (a specific competitor). Conversely, mutations at positions −10, −11, and −12 compromised the ability of competitor DNA with these changes to compete with ptac Competition by the −10G, −11C, and −12C or −12G DNAs more closely resembled the non-promoter competitor (ΔP). These results imply that only the upstream half of the −10 element is required for recognition and binding by the DNA binding domains of σ factor alone. In previous analyses of competition binding, conditions were established such that at a 1:1 molar ratio of competitor DNA to ptac, filter binding was reduced by half (27Dombroski A.J. Walter W.A. Gross C. Cell. 1992; 70: 501-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The partial σ factor polypeptide utilized here, GSTσ(360), has a slightly different composition than those used for competition binding in the past. It contains all of region 2, in addition to regions 3 and 4, rather than only part of region 2 (GSTσ(420)). This construction permits an evaluation of binding with the entire conserved region 2 present, which more closely resembles the actual DNA binding components present in wild type σ70. For GSTσ(360), conditions that resulted in a 50% reduction in binding at a 1:1 ratio were not found. The basis for this observation is not clear; however, GSTσ(360) does exhibit the expected selectivity for promoter over non-promoter DNA. The relevant comparison here is not the absolute amount of DNA needed to compete, but the relative ability of each mutant promoter DNA to compete compared to promoter (ptac) and non-promoter (ΔP) DNA. Certain prokaryotic promoters can function in the absence of a −35 element as long as they have the sequence TGnTATAAT, where the addition of TG creates an extended −10 promoter (10Backendorf C.

These results suggested that perhaps the extended −10 sequence can compensate for the lack of a −35 element with regard to σ factor binding as well. Several variants of ptac containing an extended −10 sequence were created. ptac-ext-10 carries a substitution of G for C at −14 and a substitution of C for G at −13 to generate a “perfect” extended −10 sequence (see Table I). This promoter already contained a T at −15. A point mutation from G to A at −32 was added to the extended −10 to make ptac-ext-10-32A This construction combines a promoter down change in the −35 hexamer, which is known to negatively affect σ binding (27Dombroski A.J. Walter W.A. Gross C. Cell. 1992; 70: 501-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), with the extended −10 promoter. Deletion of the −35 hexamer from ptac-ext-10 was used to generate ptac-ext-10Δ35 These constructions allow an assessment of the contribution of the −35 element to GSTσ(360) binding to an extended −10 promoter. Equilibrium competition binding experiments showed that, in general, as long as the promoter contained the extended −10 sequence it competed as well as ptac for binding to GSTσ(360) (Fig. 3A). The presence of a down substitution in the −35 hexamer (ptac-ext-10-32A) did not affect binding to the extended −10 promoter but did affect binding to ptac Thus, σ factor can recognize and bind to an extended −10 sequence in the absence of a −35 element, and a point mutation at −32 that normally disrupts binding by σ factor is ineffective in the context of an extended −10 sequence. This suggests that σ makes additional contacts in or near the −10 region, presumably the TG of the extended −10, that can substitute for loss of the contacts at −35. Finally, the question of whether point mutations in the −10 hexamer can be tolerated in the context of an extended −10 sequence and a deletion of the −35 hexamer was examined. Point mutations were generated in the ext-10Δ35 promoter to change each position of the −10 hexamer to a G:C base pair (see Table I). Fig. 3B shows that changes at positions −8, −9, −11, and −12 do not affect binding to an extended −10 promoter, even in the absence of a −35 element. Point mutations at −10 and −7 perhaps show a slightly deleterious effect on binding i"

INTRODUCTIONThe adenovirus genome is a linear double-stranded DNA molecule of 36 kbp, 1The abbreviations used are: bpbase pair(s)NFInuclear factor IpolDNA polymerasepTPprecursor terminal proteinDBPDNA-binding proteinAd5adenovirus 5SDSsodium dodecyl sulfateGSTglutathione S-transferaseGAglutathione agarose. which replicates very efficiently, producing high amounts of progeny DNA (105-106) in infected cells. Origins of replication are located at both ends of the genome, within the inverted terminal repeats, and encompass approximately 50 bp. The main proteins required for efficient replication are encoded by the virus itself and are expressed early in infection. These are the DNA polymerase (pol); the precursor terminal protein (pTP), which is required for correct initiation; and the DNA-binding protein (DBP), which is essential for elongation. The first two are present in infected cells as a stable heterodimer (pTP-pol).Initiation of DNA replication occurs by a protein-priming mechanism in which a serine residue in pTP covalently binds the first nucleotide, a deoxycytidine residue, via a phosphodiester bond (reviewed in Ref. 1Salas M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 37-71Crossref Scopus (343) Google Scholar). A pTP-trinucleotide intermediate is formed, guided by base pairing with an internal triplet and then jumping back to the very end of the DNA (2King A.J. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5786-5792Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Subsequently, this intermediate is used as a primer for further chain elongation via a strand displacement mechanism requiring the viral DNA-binding protein. The pTP remains bound to the 5′ terminus and probably serves several functions, such as protection from exonucleases, attachment to the nuclear matrix, and stabilizing the incoming pTP·pol complex (3Hay R.T. Freeman A. Leith I. Monaghan A. Webster A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 199: 31-48PubMed Google Scholar, 4van der Vliet P.C. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 199: 1-30PubMed Google Scholar). pTP·pol binding to the origin requires base pairs 8-18 for correct positioning of the complex (5Temperley S.M. Hay R.T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).In addition to the three viral proteins, at least two host proteins are recruited by the virus for maximal origin function. Both proteins, nuclear factor I (NFI) and the octamer-binding protein (Oct-1), are cellular transcription factors that bind independently to a region adjacent to the 18-bp core origin. Together, these two factors stimulate replication up to 200-fold. Their mechanism of stimulation has been studied both in vitro and in vivo (6Hay R.T. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 7Mul Y.M. Verrijzer C.P. van der Vliet P.C. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5510-5518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Pruijn G.J.M. van Driel W. van der Vliet P.C. Nature. 1986; 322: 656-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 9Hatfield L. Hearing P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3931-3939Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).NFI binds as a dimer to a partially symmetric sequence, 5′-TGGA(N)5GCCAA-3′, located between residues 25 and 38 of the Ad5 origin. The position of this NFI site relative to the core origin is critical for efficient replication. In vitro, NFI stimulates initiation in a pTP·pol concentration-dependent fashion (7Mul Y.M. Verrijzer C.P. van der Vliet P.C. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5510-5518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the proteins interact. A direct, DNA-independent contact can indeed be detected with the polymerase in the pTP·pol complex (7Mul Y.M. Verrijzer C.P. van der Vliet P.C. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5510-5518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Chen M. Mermod N. Horwitz M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18634-18642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Bosher J. Robinson E.C. Hay R.T. New Biol. 1990; 2: 1083-1090PubMed Google Scholar). This interaction is functional because mutations in NFI that fail to bind pTP·pol are also defective in stimulation of replication (12Armentero M.T. Horwitz M. Mermod N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11537-11541Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Template commitment studies showed a 10-fold increased stability of the pTP·pol complex on the origin in the presence of NFI, explaining most of the stimulatory action of NFI (13Mul Y.M. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).Oct-1 binds immediately next to the NFI site to the sequence 5′-TATGATAATGA-3′, which is located between residues 39 and 49. Deletion of the Oct-1 binding site in the adenovirus type 5 origin results in poorly growing viruses, with a yield 50-fold lower than that of the wild type (9Hatfield L. Hearing P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3931-3939Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As for NFI, the stimulatory activity of Oct-1 resides within the DNA binding domain. This DNA binding domain, the POU domain, consist of two combined helix-turn-helix DNA binding elements, the POU-specific domain (POUs), and the POU homeodomain (POUhd). POUs binds the sequence 39TATGA43, and POUhd recognizes 44TAATGA49 (14Verrijzer C.P. Van der Vliet P.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1173: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 15Herr W. Cleary M.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1679-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). In vitro Oct-1 stimulates replication 3-7-fold, also depending on the pTP·pol concentration and a DNA independent interaction between the pTP·pol complex and the POU homeodomain was observed (16Coenjaerts F.E.J. van Oosterhout J.A.W.M. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5401-5409Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The target in the pTP·pol complex and the mechanism of stimulation were not established; these discoveries are the purpose of the present study.Together with the viral proteins, NFI and Oct-1 assemble a preinitiation complex leading to optimal initiation. After initiation, this complex presumably disintegrates, but the details and kinetics of dissociation are still largely unknown. Employing an immobilized replication system, we previously showed that NFI disembarks from the preinitiation complex already at an early stage (17Coenjaerts F.E.J. van der Vliet P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5235-5240Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Using the same technology, we have now obtained evidence that Oct-1 dissociates later, upon passage of the replication fork through the Oct-1 binding site.DISCUSSIONWe show that the Oct-1 POU domain stabilizes the preinitiation complex via a direct interaction between pTP and POUhd. Enhanced pTP·pol binding in the presence of Oct-1 correlates well with the levels of stimulation, with the restriction that DNA binding assays and replication assays are performed under different conditions. Although binding of pTP is essential, it is not necessarily the only function of the POU domain. The POU domain is also capable of bending its recognition sequence slightly (23Verrijzer C.P. van Oosterhout J.A.W.M. van Weperen W.W. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1992; 10: 3007-3014Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 24Klemm J.D. Rould M.A. Aurora R. Herr W. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1994; 77: 21-32Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), and such a bend in the origin might facilitate the pTP-pol-POU interaction on DNA.Detailed mapping of the interaction domains on POUhd or pTP has not yet been achieved. POU proteins from all six classes are able to stimulate replication (25Verrijzer P.C. Strating M.J.J. Mul Y.M. van der Vliet P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6369-6375Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), 2A. van der Flier, personal communication. suggesting that the interaction domain is a conserved region. Mutation of several surface exposed residues, however, did not reduce the stimulatory action of the POU domain (data not shown). Previously (16Coenjaerts F.E.J. van Oosterhout J.A.W.M. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5401-5409Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) we observed that mutation of Oct-1 POUhd residues Q24 and E29 gave rise to enhanced stimulation, but the mechanism of this is not clear, and this effect might also have been due to a slight contamination of the mutant proteins with NFI.A Model for Assembly of the Adenovirus Initiation ComplexWe envisage the following model for initiation and early elongation (Fig. 7). The four proteins (pTP·pol, NFI and Oct-1) can form a complex even in the absence of DNA (Fig. 2B). Whether such a DNA free complex is formed in vivo and is sufficiently stable is presently unknown. The multiprotein complex (altogether, approximately 480 kDa) binds the origin, thereby positioning and stabilizing pTP·pol correctly in a preinitiation complex. Stabilization both by Oct-1 (Fig. 4) and NFI (13Mul Y.M. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) is achieved by lowering the off-rate of the pTP-pol-DNA interaction. Because Oct-1 and NFI interact with different subunits of the pTP·pol complex they supplement each other, thereby explaining the synergism in assembly and activation observed before (7Mul Y.M. Verrijzer C.P. van der Vliet P.C. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5510-5518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the four proteins form a complex, they do not all interact with each other. No interaction between NFI and pTP or between Oct-1 and the polymerase was detected (Fig. 2A). We also do not know whether both NFI subunits interact with the polymerase. It is likely that only one subunit of NFI is involved, but this is difficult to establish because monomeric NFI cannot be isolated (11Bosher J. Robinson E.C. Hay R.T. New Biol. 1990; 2: 1083-1090PubMed Google Scholar, 26Gounari F. De Francesco R. Schmitt J. van der Vliet P.C. Cortese R. Stunnenberg H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Although a weak interaction between NFI and Oct-1 was observed (Fig. 2B), we do not think that this is functional because maximal stimulation levels of Oct-1 and NFI do not seem to be influenced by each other (7Mul Y.M. Verrijzer C.P. van der Vliet P.C. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5510-5518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Only slight cooperative DNA binding was observed between NFI and Oct-1 on the Ad2 origin (7Mul Y.M. Verrijzer C.P. van der Vliet P.C. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5510-5518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such cooperativity was shown to occur in another sequence context on the human papillomavirus enhancer (27O'Connor M. Bernard H.U. Virology. 1995; 207: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).Not indicated in Fig. 7 is the role of DBP in initiation. We do not have evidence that DBP forms a complex with the other four proteins in the absence of DNA nor can it be found stably in the preinitiation complex. Nevertheless DBP has a pronounced effect on initiation because it decreases the Km of the polymerase for the initiator dCTP (28Mul Y.M. van der Vliet P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 641-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and enhances the binding of NFI (29Cleat P.H. Hay R.T. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1841-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 30Stuiver M.H. van der Vliet P.C. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 379-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These effects are most likely due to changes in the origin DNA, which are known to occur by DBP although we can not exclude a direct interaction with the polymerase.The complete preinitiation complex spans five helical turns. To allow all protein-protein contacts, considerable bending of the DNA has to occur within the first 50 bp (Fig. 7). Several lines of evidence indicate that this is indeed the case. The protein-free origin is already slightly bent, as concluded from circular permutation experiments (31Zorbas H. Rogge L. Meisterernst M. Winnacker E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7735-7748Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This intrinsic bend is enhanced by binding of NFI (31Zorbas H. Rogge L. Meisterernst M. Winnacker E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7735-7748Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Because Oct-1 also bends the DNA, we assume that a considerable distortion of the DNA structure must exist in a preinitiation complex. We are currently investigating whether simultaneous binding of NFI and Oct-1 causes the DNA to bend toward the same side of the helix. Further bending might also be generated by the covalently bound TP, which induces structural changes in the origin as concluded from the appearance of DNase I hypersensitive sites (32Pronk R. van der Vliet P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2293-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Finally, the enhancing effect of DBP on initiation could well be related to its property of inducing structural changes in DNA (33Stuiver M.H. Bergsma W.G. Arnberg A.C. van Amerongen H. van Grondelle R. van der Vliet P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 999-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Together, these DNA conformational changes might promote protein-protein interactions and destabilize the origin to facilitate initial opening.Dissociation of the Adenovirus Initiation ComplexAfter the initiation, the complex starts dissociating. NFI already dissociates as soon as initiation starts (Fig. 7). Because the NFI site is located between bp 25 and 38 of the origin and is likely to remain double-stranded at this stage, drastic changes in the initiation complex must occur that cause NFI to dissociate. The POU domain, in contrast, remains bound to the origin until the passing polymerase unwinds the octamer recognition site (Fig. 5). This suggests that the POU domain may also stabilize the complex after the first dCTP coupling, during formation of early elongation products. The pTP·pol heterodimer dissociates early in elongation. 3A. King and P. C. van der Vliet, manuscript in preparation. During elongation, DBP binds cooperatively to the displaced strand (34Tucker P.A. Tsernoglou D. Tucker A.D. Coenjaerts F.E. Leenders H. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2994-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), thereby assisting the polymerase in DNA unwinding. 4J. Dekker et al., manuscript in preparation.POU Domain Proteins as Regulators of Viral ReplicationThe use of a POU domain protein for efficient multiplication is not restricted to adenoviruses. Direct protein-protein interaction was reported between Oct-6 and the JC papovavirus T antigen (35Renner K. Leger H. Wegner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6433-6437Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and between Oct-1 and the Herpes simplex transactivator protein (36O'Hare P. Goding C.R. Haigh A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4231-4238Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), both resulting in enhanced viral gene activation. Other viruses that use a POU transcription factor include SV40, Epstein-Barr virus, murine mammary tumor virus, human papillomovirus, and hepatitis B virus (37Dent C.L. McIndoe G.A. Latchman D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4531-4535Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 38Bruggemeier U. Kalff M. Franke S. Scheidereit C. Beato M.

Biol. 1991; 11: 1353-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Presumably, their high level of conservation, in particular of the POU domain, and wide expression have made them attractive targets for invading viruses during evolution. Adenovirus, however, is the only virus known to use Oct-1 for efficient DNA replication. There is some indirect evidence that Oct-1 is involved in eukaryotic replication. Octamer sequences have been found in several chromosomal origins of replication (42Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ogawa N. Ariga H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1172: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 43Todd A. Landry S. Pearson C. Khoury V. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 57: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and enhanced replication of a transfected plasmid depended on an intact octamer site (42Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ogawa N. Ariga H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1172: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Whether this is a direct effect on replication remains to be elucidated. INTRODUCTIONThe adenovirus genome is a linear double-stranded DNA molecule of 36 kbp, 1The abbreviations used are: bpbase pair(s)NFInuclear factor IpolDNA polymerasepTPprecursor terminal proteinDBPDNA-binding proteinAd5adenovirus 5SDSsodium dodecyl sulfateGSTglutathione S-transferaseGAglutathione agarose. which replicates very efficiently, producing high amounts of progeny DNA (105-106) in infected cells. Origins of replication are located at both ends of the genome, within the inverted terminal repeats, and encompass approximately 50 bp. The main proteins required for efficient replication are encoded by the virus itself and are expressed early in infection. These are the DNA polymerase (pol); the precursor terminal protein (pTP), which is required for correct initiation; and the DNA-binding protein (DBP), which is essential for elongation. The first two are present in infected cells as a stable heterodimer (pTP-pol).Initiation of DNA replication occurs by a protein-priming mechanism in which a serine residue in pTP covalently binds the first nucleotide, a deoxycytidine residue, via a phosphodiester bond (reviewed in Ref. 1Salas M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 37-71Crossref Scopus (343) Google Scholar). A pTP-trinucleotide intermediate is formed, guided by base pairing with an internal triplet and then jumping back to the very end of the DNA (2King A.J. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5786-5792Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Subsequently, this intermediate is used as a primer for further chain elongation via a strand displacement mechanism requiring the viral DNA-binding protein. The pTP remains bound to the 5′ terminus and probably serves several functions, such as protection from exonucleases, attachment to the nuclear matrix, and stabilizing the incoming pTP·pol complex (3Hay R.T. Freeman A. Leith I. Monaghan A. Webster A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 199: 31-48PubMed Google Scholar, 4van der Vliet P.C. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 199: 1-30PubMed Google Scholar). pTP·pol binding to the origin requires base pairs 8-18 for correct positioning of the complex (5Temperley S.M. Hay R.T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).In addition to the three viral proteins, at least two host proteins are recruited by the virus for maximal origin function. Both proteins, nuclear factor I (NFI) and the octamer-binding protein (Oct-1), are cellular transcription factors that bind independently to a region adjacent to the 18-bp core origin. Together, these two factors stimulate replication up to 200-fold. Their mechanism of stimulation has been studied both in vitro and in vivo (6Hay R.T. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 7Mul Y.M. Verrijzer C.P. van der Vliet P.C. J.

J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3931-3939Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).NFI binds as a dimer to a partially symmetric sequence, 5′-TGGA(N)5GCCAA-3′, located between residues 25 and 38 of the Ad5 origin. The position of this NFI site relative to the core origin is critical for efficient replication. In vitro, NFI stimulates initiation in a pTP·pol concentration-dependent fashion (7Mul Y.M. Verrijzer C.P. van der Vliet P.C. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5510-5518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the proteins interact. A direct, DNA-independent contact can indeed be detected with the polymerase in the pTP·pol complex (7Mul Y.M. Verrijzer C.P. van der Vliet P.C. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5510-5518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Chen M. Mermod N. Horwitz M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18634-18642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Bosher J. Robinson E.C. Hay R.T. New Biol. 1990; 2: 1083-1090PubMed Google Scholar). This interaction is functional because mutations in NFI that fail to bind pTP·pol are also defective in stimulation of replication (12Armentero M.T. Horwitz M. Mermod N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11537-11541Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Template commitment studies showed a 10-fold increased stability of the pTP·pol complex on the origin in the presence of NFI, explaining most of the stimulatory action of NFI (13Mul Y.M. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).Oct-1 binds immediately next to the NFI site to the sequence 5′-TATGATAATGA-3′, which is located between residues 39 and 49. Deletion of the Oct-1 binding site in the adenovirus type 5 origin results in poorly growing viruses, with a yield 50-fold lower than that of the wild type (9Hatfield L. Hearing P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3931-3939Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As for NFI, the stimulatory activity of Oct-1 resides within the DNA binding domain. This DNA binding domain, the POU domain, consist of two combined helix-turn-helix DNA binding elements, the POU-specific domain (POUs), and the POU homeodomain (POUhd). POUs binds the sequence 39TATGA43, and POUhd recognizes 44TAATGA49 (14Verrijzer C.P. Van der Vliet P.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1173: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 15Herr W. Cleary M.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1679-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). In vitro Oct-1 stimulates replication 3-7-fold, also depending on the pTP·pol concentration and a DNA independent interaction between the pTP·pol complex and the POU homeodomain was observed (16Coenjaerts F.E.J. van Oosterhout J.A.W.M. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5401-5409Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The target in the pTP·pol complex and the mechanism of stimulation were not established; these discoveries are the purpose of the present study.Together with the viral proteins, NFI and Oct-1 assemble a preinitiation complex leading to optimal initiation. After initiation, this complex presumably disintegrates, but the details and kinetics of dissociation are still largely unknown. Employing an immobilized replication system, we previously showed that NFI disembarks from the preinitiation complex already at an early stage (17Coenjaerts F.E.J. van der Vliet P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5235-5240Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Using the same technology, we have now obtained evidence that Oct-1 dissociates later, upon passage of the replication fork through the Oct-1 binding site."

Previous studies have shown that IL-1-induced ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity down-regulation is involved in the anti-proliferative effect of IL-1 on human A375 melanoma cells. In this study, we examined the IL-1α-induced molecular events resulting in ODC activity down-regulation in C2-1, a A375 cell line stably transfected with human type I IL-1 receptor. Recombinant human (rh) IL-1α inhibited the growth and down-regulated the ODC activity of C2-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Kinetics studies showed that both the DNA synthesis and ODC activity of C2-1 cells progressively decreased from 12 h after IL-1 addition. Northern hybridization showed that IL-1 had no influence on ODC mRNA level. However, rhIL-1 induced both a decrease of ODC protein and an ODC-inhibiting activity in IL-1-treated C2-1 cells. IL-1 specifically up-modulated the mRNA level of antizyme, a protein essential for ODC regulation, but had little effect on its stability. IL-1-induced antizyme up-modulation preceded IL-1-induced down-regulation of ODC protein, ODC activity, and DNA synthesis in C2-1 cells. Run-on transcription analysis confirmed that the increased antizyme mRNA expression was due to elevated antizyme gene transcription. Furthermore, the action of IL-1 to inhibit the ODC activity and growth of C2-1 cells was blocked by expressing the antisense RNA of human antizyme in C2-1 cells.

Ion spray mass spectrometry demonstrated that the molecular mass of the enzyme inactivated by hydroxylamine during the dechlorination of monochloroacetate is about 74 Da greater than that of the native enzyme. To determine the increase of the molecular mass more precisely, we digested the inactivated enzyme with lysyl endopeptidase and measured the molecular masses of the peptide fragments. The molecular mass of the hexapeptide Gly6-Lys11 was shown to increase by 73 Da. Tandem mass spectrometric analysis of this peptide revealed that the increase is due to a modification of Asp10.

Paracatalytic enzyme modification is a catalysis-linked and substrate-dependent enzyme modification (1Christen P. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 46: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It involves a direct chemical reaction between an enzyme-activated substrate and an extrinsic reagent. The catalytic effect of an enzyme can increase the reactivity of a substrate with extrinsic reagents that are not constituents of the normal enzyme-substrate system. The reactive intermediates formed may thus react with extrinsic reagents to branch off from the normal catalytic pathway. Consequently, the enzyme active site may be specifically and irreversibly modified. L-2-Haloacid dehalogenase (EC 3.8.1.2) catalyzes the hydrolytic dehalogenation of L-2-haloalkanoic acids to produce the corresponding D-2-hydroxyalkanoic acids (2Hardman D.J. Crit. Rev.

Tandem MS/MS spectrometric analysis revealed that the active site Asp10 was specifically labeled. Hydroxylamine is thus useful to probe the active site carboxylate group, which constitutes an enzyme-substrate ester intermediate. Leu11, Ser176, and Arg185 were replaced by Lys by site-directed mutagenesis, and the resultant mutant enzyme, L-DEX T15, yields a small peptide fragment containing active site Asp10 of L-DEX YL by lysyl endopeptidase digestion.

Catalytic properties of L-DEX T15 such as the specific activity for L-2-chloropropionate and the optimum pH were indistinguishable from those of the wild type enzyme.

L-2-Chloropropionate and monochloroacetate were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) and Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan), respectively. Hydroxylamine sulfate was obtained from Wako Industry Co. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. L-DEX YL and L-DEX T15 were assayed with 25 mML-2-chloropropionate as a substrate.

In this assay, chloride ion reacts with Hg(SCN)2 to form HgCl2, HgCl42−, and SCN−, which gives a reddish orange color (FeSCN2+) with ferric ion in nitric acid solution. One unit of the enzyme was defined as the amount of enzyme which catalyzes the dehalogenation of 1 μmol of L-2-chloropropionate/min. Protein assay was done with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. For the experiment described in Tables I and 2 and MS analysis, reactions of l-DEX YL and L-DEX T15 with hydroxylamine were carried out with 1 ml of reaction mixtures containing 1 M Tris-H2SO4 buffer (pH 9.0), 10 μM enzyme, and 1 M hydroxylamine in the presence or absence of the indicated amount of substrates or monofluoroacetate (a substrate analog).Table IInactivation of L-DEX YL by hydroxylamineHydroxylamine−++++L-2-Chloropropionate−+−−−Monochloroacetate−−+−−Monofluoroacetate−−−+−Residual activity (%)100009596 Open table in a new tab To study the relationship between hydroxylamine concentration and the inactivation rate of the enzyme, the reactions were carried out in 1.5 ml of solution containing 0.1 M Tris-H2SO4 buffer (pH 9.5), 9.4 μML-DEX YL, 100 mM sodium monochloroacetate, and 0-0.5 M hydroxylamine at 30°C. At intervals, 50 μl of the reaction mixture was taken off, and the residual enzyme activity was measured in 450 μl of assay mixture containing 0.1 M Tris-H2SO4 (pH 9.5) and 25 mM sodium monochloroacetate. After incubation at 30°C for 10 min, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 50 μl of 3 M H2SO4, and the amount of chloride ions was measured by the method described above. To examine the effect of substrate concentration on the rate of L-DEX YL inactivation, the reactions were carried out in dialysis bags each of which contained 5 ml of 0.1 M Tris-H2SO4 buffer (pH 9.5), 0.57 μML-DEX YL, 0.5 M hydroxylamine, and 0-5 mM sodium monochloroacetate. The reactions were initiated by the addition of sodium monochloroacetate, and the dialysis bags were immediately put into 200 ml of 0.1 M Tris-H2SO4 buffer (pH 9.5) containing sodium monochloroacetate whose concentration was the same as that in the dialysis bag, in order to keep the substrate concentration constant during the reaction. The reactions were carried out at 30°C. After 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 min, 50 μl of the mixture was taken off from the dialysis bag, and the residual enzyme activity was measured in 450 μl of assay mixture containing 0.1 M Tris-H2SO4 buffer (pH 9.5) and 25 mM sodium monochloroacetate. Since the concentration of hydroxylamine carried into this assay mixture was sufficiently low, further inactivation of L-DEX YL in this assay mixture was negligible. After incubation at 30°C for 10 min, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 50 μl of 3 M H2SO4, and the amount of chloride ions was measured by the method described above. The amino acid sequences of the enzymes and peptides were determined with a fully automated protein sequencer PPSQ-10 (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Molecular masses of the enzyme and its derivatives dissolved in 50% acetonitrile containing 0.05% formic acid were determined by introducing into a PE-Sciex API III mass spectrometer equipped with an ion spray ion source (Sciex, Thornhill, Ontario, Canada) at a flow rate of 2 μl/min. The quadrupole was scanned from 800 to 1,500 atomic mass units with a step size of 0.1 atomic mass units and a 1-ms dwell time/step. Ion spray voltage was set at 5 kV, and the orifice potential was 80 V. Data analysis was done with MacSpec software supplied by Sciex, and the theoretical molecular masses were calculated with MacBioSpec. One ml of 1 M Tris-H2SO4 buffer (pH 9.0) containing 10 μML-DEX YL, 1 M hydroxylamine, and 100 mM sodium L-2-chloropropionate was incubated at 45°C for 30 min. The inactivated enzyme was dialyzed against 5,000 volumes of water, denatured with 3 M urea, and then digested with 5 μg of TPCK-treated trypsin in 0.2 M Tris-H2SO4 buffer (pH 8.0) for 12 h. L-DEX YL treated with hydroxylamine in the absence of the substrate was used as a control. Ten nmol of L-DEX T15 inactivated by hydroxylamine in the presence of monochloroacetate under the same conditions as those for the wild type L-DEX YL was denatured with 8 M urea and subsequently digested with 80-100 pmol of lysyl endopeptidase at 37°C for 12 h. L-DEX T15 treated with hydroxylamine in the absence of the substrate was used as a control. The proteolysate of the L-DEX YL inactivated in the presence of L-2-chloropropionate was loaded onto a packed capillary perfusion column (Poros II R/H, 320 μm × 10 cm, LC Packings, San Francisco, CA) connected to the mass spectrometer and then eluted with a linear gradient of 0-80% acetonitrile in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid over 40 min at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. The total ion current chromatogram was recorded in the single quadrupole mode with a PE-Sciex API III mass spectrometer equipped with an ion spray ion source. The quadrupole was scanned from 300 to 2,000 atomic mass units with a step size of 0.25 atomic mass units and a 0.5-ms dwell time/step. Ion spray voltage was set at 5 kV, and the orifice potential was 80 V. The molecular mass of each peptide was calculated with MacSpec software, and the theoretical average molecular masses of the peptides were calculated with MacBioSpec software supplied by Sciex. For the analysis of the peptide containing Asp10, the proteolysates of L-DEX T15 incubated with hydroxylamine in the presence or absence of monochloroacetate were applied to a C18 column (Puresil 5-μm C18 120 Å, 4.6 × 150 mm; Millipore, Tokyo, Japan) and eluted with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid for 5 min followed by a linear gradient of 0-80% acetonitrile in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid over 60 min at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The elution was monitored at 215 nm with a UV detector, and the fractions were collected and injected into a PE-Sciex API III mass spectrometer in the single quadrupole mode under the same conditions as described above. The MS/MS daughter ion spectra were obtained in the triple-quadrupole daughter scan mode by selectively introducing the peptides containing Asp10 (m/z 723.8, 708.7, or 650.5) from Q1 into the collision cell (Q2) and observing the daughter ions in Q3. Q1 was locked on m/z 723.8, 708.7, or 650.5. Q3 was scanned from 50 to just above the molecular mass of the peptide. A step size was 0.1, and the dwell time was 1 ms/step. Ion spray voltage was set at 5 kV, and the orifice potential was 100 V. Collision energy was 30 eV. The resolutions of Q1 and Q3 were approximately 500 and 1,500, respectively. The collision gas was argon, and the gas thickness was 2.9 × 1014 molecules/cm2. We found that treatment of L-DEX YL with hydroxylamine in the presence of monochloroacetate or L-2-chloropropionate led to an inactivation of the enzyme, whereas the treatment in the absence of the substrate or in the presence of monofluoroacetate, a substrate analog, caused no significant alteration in the enzyme activity (Table I). Extensive dialysis of the inactivated enzyme did not result in its reactivation, suggesting a covalent modification of the enzyme. The enzyme was inactivated as the chloride ions were released (data not shown), and the inactivation followed pseudo-first-order kinetics (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2B shows that the rate of inactivation is proportional to the concentration of hydroxylamine. The initial rates of the inactivation were plotted against substrate concentrations, and the data were computer fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation as shown in Fig. 3. The concentration of monochloroacetate causing a half-maximum rate of inactivation was thus calculated to be about 1.7 mM, which is close to the Km value for monochloroacetate in the dehalogenation reaction (1.1 mM) (4Liu J.-Q. Kurihara T. Hasan A.K.M.Q. Nardi-Dei V. Koshikawa H. Esaki N. Soda K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 2389-2393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These kinetic data show that this inactivation is due to a reaction of hydroxylamine with an enzyme-substrate complex.Fig. 3Rate of inactivation of L-DEX YL as a function of substrate concentration.

The molecular mass of the native L-DEX YL was 25,863 Da, which indicates that the COOH terminus of this enzyme preparation lacks the last three amino acid residues (25,862.4 Da) (12Nardi-Dei V. Kurihara T. Okamura T. Liu J.-Q. Koshikawa H. Ozaki H. Terashima Y. Esaki N. Soda K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 3375-3380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mass of the enzyme treated with hydroxylamine in the absence of the substrate was 25,863 Da, which is closely similar to the above value. In contrast, the molecular masses of the enzymes incubated with hydroxylamine in the presence of each of two kinds of the substrates, L-2-chloropropionate and monochloroacetate, were 25,952 and 25,937 Da, respectively, which are higher by 89 and 74 Da than that of the native protein. These indicate that L-DEX YL was modified by a molecule (or molecules) derived from the substrate (or plus hydroxylamine) to give molecular masses increased by 89 and 74 Da, respectively.Table II.Determination of NH2-terminal amino acid sequence and molecular mass of L-DEX YL inactivated by hydroxylamineAdditionaL-DEX YL was incubated with hydroxylamine in the presence of the indicated compound.NH2-terminal amino acid sequenceMolecular mass (Da)bMolecular mass was measured by ion spray mass spectrometry.Increase (Da)cIncrease in molecular mass compared with that of the enzyme that has not been treated with hydroxylamine.DaL-2-ChloropropionateMDYIKGIAFXdX indicates an unidentified amino acid residue.LYGTLFDVH—25,95289MonochloroacetateMDYIKGIAFXdX indicates an unidentified amino acid residue.LYGTLFDVH—25,93774NoneMDYIKGIAFDLYGTLFDVH—25,8630No treatmenteL-DEX YL was incubated in the absence of hydroxylamine.MDYIKGIAFDLYGTLFDVH—25,8630a L-DEX YL was incubated with hydroxylamine in the presence of the indicated compound.b Molecular mass was measured by ion spray mass spectrometry.c Increase in molecular mass compared with that of the enzyme that has not been treated with hydroxylamine.d X indicates an unidentified amino acid residue.e L-DEX YL was incubated in the absence of hydroxylamine. Open table in a new tab To examine if the active site Asp10 was modified at the step of inactivation by hydroxylamine, we carried out amino acid sequencing of the enzyme. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing showed that Asp10 of the enzyme was modified only in the presence of the substrate (Table II). The enzyme modified with hydroxylamine in the presence of L-2-chloropropionate was digested with TPCK-treated trypsin, and the molecular masses of the resulting peptide fragments were measured by LC/MS. When the spectrometer was in the single quadrupole mode, the total ion current chromatogram displayed several peaks (Fig. 4A). The molecular masses of the peptides for peaks 1 (Fig. 4C) and 3 (Fig. 4B) were 15 and 87 Da higher, respectively, than that for the peptide in peak 2 (Fig. 4D). The value of molecular mass of the peak 2 peptide was compatible with that of a peptide corresponding to residues 6-24 derived from the unmodified enzyme. The peptides for peaks 1 and 3 are probably those corresponding to the same region but containing an amino acid residue modified in the hydroxylamine reaction. We have prepared a mutant enzyme, L-DEX T15, which has been shown to be very convenient for analysis of modification of the active site Asp10 because it is possible to obtain several peptides with appropriate sizes which cover the entire enzyme from the NH2 terminus to the COOH terminus after cleavage with lysyl endopeptidase (5Liu J.-Q. Kurihara T. Miyagi M. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18309-18312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). L-DEX T15 incubated with hydroxylamine in the presence or absence of monochloroacetate was digested with lysyl endopeptidase, and the resulting peptide fragments were separated by high performance LC. Amino acid sequencing of the isolated peptides showed that a modified amino acid occurs at the position corresponding to the active site Asp10 in the hexapeptide G-I-A-F-D-K; Asp10 was modified only in the presence of the substrate (data not shown). The modified hexapeptide G-I-A-F-X-K (where X is an unknown residue) was subsequently introduced into the ion spray mass spectrometer for detailed analysis. Two major peaks, derived from peptides with molecular masses of 708 and 723 Da, were found (Fig. 5). These values are 58 and 73 Da higher, respectively, than that of the native hexapeptide (650 Da). These peptide fragments were analyzed in more detail by tandem MS/MS spectrometry. The parent ions of m/z 650.5, 708.7, and 723.8, corresponding to the native peptide and the two modified peptides, were selected in the first quadrupole and subjected to collision-induced fragmentation in a collision cell in the second quadrupole. The mass spectra of the daughter ions produced are shown in Fig. 6. The peaks at m/z 553.6, 482.2, and 335.2 generated from the parent ion of m/z 723.8 correspond to the y series fragment ions of the peptides A-F-X′-K, F-X′-K, and X′-K, respectively (where X′ is an unidentified residue). They are about 73 Da higher than those of peaks at m/z 480.2, 409.3, and 262.0 derived from the native peptide corresponding to A-F-D-K, F-D-K, and D-K, respectively. The peaks at m/z 538.5, 467.4, and 320.1 from the parent ion of m/z 708.7 correspond to the peptides A-F-X”-K, F-X”-K, and X”-K, respectively (where X” is an unidentified residue). They are about 58 Da higher than those of the corresponding peaks from the native peptide. However, molecular masses of the remaining portions (K) derived from these three peptides were essentially identical with each other (147.3, 147.3, and 147.1). These show that the active site Asp10 was specifically modified by molecules derived from the substrate and hydroxylamine. L-DEX YL is inactivated by hydroxylamine only in the presence of the substrate, whereas a substrate analog that is not subject to dehalogenation does not induce inactivation. The concentration of the substrate causing a half-maximum rate of inactivation is close to its Km value in the normal dehalogenation reaction, suggesting that the binding of the substrate to the active site of the enzyme is required for the inactivation by hydroxylamine. Moreover, mass spectrometric analysis of the inactivated enzyme showed that the active site Asp10 of the enzyme is modified with substrate- and hydroxylamine-derived moieties. These results indicate that hydroxylamine inactivates L-DEX YL paracatalytically; the intermediate derived from an enzyme-substrate complex is attacked by an extrinsic reagent. The molecular mass of L-DEX YL inactivated by hydroxylamine in the presence of monochloroacetate was shown to be about 74 Da higher than that of the native L-DEX YL. The mass spectrometric analysis of the Asp10-containing peptides derived from the inactivated L-DEX YL showed that there are two different species whose molecular masses are 58 and 73 Da higher than that of the unmodified peptide. Since we could not detect the modified L-DEX YL whose molecular mass is about 58 Da higher than that of the native L-DEX YL, the peptide species with 58-Da higher mass number probably was formed by degradation of the other peptide species showing 73-Da higher mass number in the course of preparation of the peptide fragments. The increment of the molecular mass of 73 Da, which is more reliable than that of 74 Da observed for the whole modified protein, is postulated to be due to modification of Asp10 leading to the formation of aspartate β-hydroxamate carboxymethyl ester as shown in Fig. 7. The species with 58 Da higher molecular mass would result from hydrolysis of hydroxyimido moiety of the above modified aspartate generating carboxymethylated Asp10. With L-2-chloropropionate as substrate, the treatment of L-DEX YL with hydroxylamine caused an 87-Da increment in the molecular mass, and a species whose molecular mass is 15 Da higher than that of the native protein was also produced during the preparation of the peptide fragments. These increments in molecular mass can also be explained based on the mechanism shown in Fig. 7. The increment of 87 Da may be due to the conversion of Asp10 to the β-hydroxyimido carboxyethyl ester. The 15 Da higher molecular mass species could be formed by hydrolysis, generating an aspartate β-hydroxamate residue. Under the normal enzymatic reaction conditions, Asp10 of the enzyme acts as a nucleophile to attack the α-carbon of the substrate leading to the formation of an ester intermediate, which is to be hydrolyzed by nucleophilic attack of a water molecule (5Liu J.-Q. Kurihara T. Miyagi M. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18309-18312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). When hydroxylamine is present, it attacks the carbonyl carbon of the Asp10 ester intermediate as shown in Fig. 7. The nonenzymatic reaction is thought to proceed through pathway 2 in Fig. 7 in preference to pathway 1, resulting in the formation of an aspartate β-hydroxamate residue. However, the mass spectrometric analysis of the modified residue showed that pathway 1 is preferred to pathway 2 in the case of L-DEX YL modification. The residues facilitating the elimination of the hydroxyl group and suppressing the elimination of the carboxyalkoxyl group are probably present in the active site of the enzyme. An alternative inactivation mechanism shown in Fig. 8 can also account for the 73- and 87-Da increments in the molecular mass of the enzyme inactivated in the presence of monochloroacetate and L-2-chloropropionate, respectively. Since MS has only identified the atoms incorporated into the inactivated enzyme and not their chemical arrangement, further studies are necessary to determine the exact structure of the modified Asp10 residue. Hydroxylamine has a much higher nucleophilicity than water and has been used successfully as an acyl group acceptor to trap acylenzyme intermediates of several enzymes, such as chymotrypsin (15Caplow M. Jencks W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 1640-1652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), D-alanine carboxypeptidase (16Nishino T. Kozarich J.W. Strominger J.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1975; 250: 5283-5288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of hydroxylamine, these ester intermediates are cleaved by hydroxylamine. Since the acyl moieties of the intermediates in these enzyme reactions are derived from the substrates, the reaction with hydroxylamine leads to the formation of hydroxamate analogs of the normal products. The formation of such hydroxamate analogs is considered evidence for the formation of an ester intermediate in the enzyme reaction. Unlike these enzymes, the active site Asp10 of L-DEX YL was specifically modified by hydroxylamine. This strongly indicates that an ester intermediate, whose acyl moiety is derived from Asp10, is produced during the reaction, which strongly supports the mechanism shown in Fig. 1.

INTRODUCTIONIntracellular concentration and distribution of the ubiquitous second messenger Ca2+ is tightly controlled by a number of pathways (1Tsien R.W. Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 715-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). The interaction of the pathways that mobilize and regulate free Ca2+ levels can result in highly complex and dynamic signaling patterns, such as Ca2+ oscillations and waves (1Tsien R.W. Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 715-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 2Berridge M.J. Dupont G. Curr. Opin.

Science. 1991; 251: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Although the role of second messengers themselves in dynamic signaling phenomena has been studied by photorelease techniques, the contribution of pathways that regulate second messenger levels remains unexplored.The family of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPases (SERCA) 1The abbreviations used are: SERCAsarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum ATPaseAMacetoxymethylDBHQ2,5-di(tert-butyl)hydroquinoneNmoco-nitromandelyloxycarbonyl. that sequester Ca2+ into the sarcoplasmic reticulum and endoplasmic reticulum are important regulators of cytosolic free Ca2+ levels (10Lytton J. Westlin M. Burk S.E. Shull G.E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14483-14489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We reasoned that the effect of these pumps on Ca2+ oscillations and waves could be elucidated by the development of a method for the pulsed modulation of their activity. This could be accomplished by the preparation of a caged, reversible SERCA inhibitor. Of the known SERCA inhibitors (11Thomas D. Hanley M.R. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 65-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), 2,5-di(tert-butyl)-1,4-hydroquinone (DBHQ, 1) (12Moore G.A. McConkey D.J. Kass G.E. O'Brien P.J. Orrenius S. FEBS Lett. 1987; 224: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 13Kass G.E.N. Duddy S.K. Moore G.A. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15192-15198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is ideally suited for the development of a caged SERCA modulator because it is a structurally simple and reversible inhibitor that is commercially available in large quantities.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe three most commonly used SERCA inhibitors are thapsigargin (20Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (2986) Google Scholar, 21Lytton J. Westlin M. Hanley M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17067-17071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cyclopiazonic acid (22Goeger D.E. Riley R.T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 3995-4003Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and DBHQ (12Moore G.A. McConkey D.J. Kass G.E. O'Brien P.J. Orrenius S. FEBS Lett. 1987; 224: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 13Kass G.E.N. Duddy S.K. Moore G.A. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15192-15198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because its inhibitory action is irreversible (23Sagara Y. Wade J.B. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1286-1292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thapsigargin is not a suitable target for a caged reagent to be used for reversible photomodulation of SERCA activity. Cyclopiazonic acid has a relatively complex molecular structure and, being a biosynthetic product of fungal origin, is available only in small quantities at high expense, which makes it an unattractive starting material for organic synthesis. In contrast, DBHQ is structurally simple, incorporating only one type of reactive functional group for caging purposes, and is commercially available in large quantities. These advantages, together with its reversibility, made DBHQ our preferred target for caging.The great majority of photoreleasable compounds have used caging groups structurally based on the 2-nitrobenzyl system (24Kao J.P.Y. Adams S.R. Herman B. Lemasters J.J. Optical Microscopy, Emerging Methods and Applications. Academic Press, San Diego1993: 27-85Google Scholar). Although the simple parent 2-nitrobenzyl moiety is a common caging group, it was not appropriate for caging DBHQ; preliminary experiments indicated that UV irradiation of cells bathed in medium containing 2-nitrobenzyl alcohol resulted in irreversible inhibition of the SERCA pump. Because photolysis of any 2-nitrobenzyl-caged compound is expected to generate the same photochemical byproducts, we inferred that the byproducts of photolyzing a 2-nitrobenzyl-caged DBHQ would not be inert.Hess and co-workers have shown that the α-carboxy-nitrobenzyl group is useful for caging neuroactive amino acids (25Milburn T. Matsubara N. Billington A.P. Udganonkar J.b. Walker J.W. Carpenter B.K. Webb W. Marque J. Denk W. McCray J. Hess G.P.

Photodeprotection was shown to proceed rapidly and with high quantum yield (28Wieboldt R. Gee K.R. Niu L.I. Ramesh D. Carpenter B.K. Hess G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8752-8756Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We recognized that the carboxylate on this caging group would reduce the reactivity of the photochemical byproduct. Furthermore, the presence of the carboxylate offers the added advantages of increasing the water solubility of the caged compound and allowing for the preparation of a caged AM ester, which could be passively loaded into cells.Caging DBHQ directly with the α-carboxy-nitrobenzyl group requires the formation of a benzyl ether, which model studies indicated was problematic. For example, reaction of DBHQ with 2-nitrobenzyl chloride in the presence of K2CO3 yielded numerous compounds that were difficult to isolate and characterize. Reasoning that the difficulties encountered in benzyl ether formation were at least partially the result of the sterically congested environment surrounding the phenolic hydroxyl groups of DBHQ, we postulated that an efficacious caging reaction would need to proceed through a different mechanism. The Nmoc group was designed as a photocleavable caging group that would combine the desirable qualities of the α-carboxy-nitrobenzyl group with a caging reaction that proceeds via carbonyl substitution. Irradiation of Nmoc-DBHQ (2) with UV light would result in the formation of DBHQ-bicarbonate (3), which would rapidly decompose under physiological conditions to DBHQ (1) and carbon dioxide as shown in Scheme 1. The photochemical side product, 2-(2-nitrosophenyl)glyoxylate (3a) is the same as that generated by photolysis of α-carboxy-nitrobenzyl-caged molecules (25Milburn T. Matsubara N. Billington A.P.

Carbon dioxide, liberated by decarboxylation of DBHQ-bicarbonate (3), is a normal product of metabolism and would thus also be innocuous.Nmoc-DBHQ was prepared as outlined in Scheme 2. 2-Nitrobenzaldehyde was converted to the cyanohydrin (4), which was hydrolyzed to o-nitromandelic acid (5) by refluxing in concentrated hydrochloric acid. Methyl o-nitromandelate (6) was prepared by Fisher esterification of 5. Caging DBHQ necessitated the preparation of an activated o-nitromandelyl-oxycarbonyl group. The oxycarbonyl imidazole derivative (7) was considered superior to the chloroformate because of its stability and ease of preparation. Treatment of alcohol 6 with carbonyl diimidazole gave 7 in high yield as a stable crystalline solid. The desired carbonate (8) was formed when a solution of 7 and DBHQ in N,N-dimethylformamide was heated with a catalytic amount of 4-dimethylaminopyridine. Saponification of the methyl ester (8) followed by acidification gave Nmoc-DBHQ (2). To facilitate loading of the caged reagent into cells, the AM ester of Nmoc-DBHQ (9) was prepared. Neutralization of 2 with one equivalent of sodium hydroxide, followed by esterification with bromomethyl acetate in the presence of tetrabutylammonium iodide gave Nmoc-DBHQ/AM (9).Scheme 2Synthesis of Nmoc-DBHQ and Its AM Ester.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To demonstrate the photoreactivity of Nmoc-DBHQ, a series of UV-visible absorption spectra were acquired from a solution of the sodium salt of Nmoc-DBHQ that was being photolyzed with 365 nm light (Fig. 1A). The spectroscopic changes resulting from photolysis are consistent with those expected from the classic o-nitrobenzyl rearrangement. In particular, photolysis causes an increase in absorbance at longer wavelengths, a result of the long wavelength absorption by the highly conjugated byproduct (3a in Scheme 1). Because the spectra show good isosbestic points through the course of photolysis, we were able to determine the quantum efficiency of photolysis of Nmoc-DBHQ by analyzing the absorbance changes as a function of time (6Adams S.R.

The time course for the decay of the transient absorbance following laser pulse photolysis of Nmoc-DBHQ is shown in Fig. 2. The decay is dominated by an exponential component with a lifetime (τ) of 182 ± 1 μs. 2There is a small contribution at short times from a fast minor component. The minor component accounts for less than 10% of the total decay amplitude and has τ = 29 ± 2 μs. These results imply that the photochemical cleavage reaction is essentially complete in approximately 550 μs (i.e. in about three lifetimes).Fig. 2Transient absorbance changes following pulsed laser photolysis of Nmoc-DBHQ.

Soc. 1978; 100: 3564-3567Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Because the pKa of DBHQ is estimated to be 11.21 (36Perrin D.D. Dempsey B. Serjeant E.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc.pKa Prediction for Organic Acids and Bases. Chapman and Hall, London1981Crossref Google Scholar), the rate constant for decomposition of the carbonate monoester of DBHQ is expected to be kdec≈ 130 s−1 (t1/2 ≈ 5.3 ms) at 25°C. We demonstrate in subsequent biological experiments that DBHQ photorelease is sufficiently rapid for probing Ca2+ signaling dynamics.Biological efficacy of Nmoc-DBHQ was tested in living cells. Loading cells simultaneously with Nmoc-DBHQ and the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator, fluo-3 allowed the effects of photoreleasing DBHQ on intracellular Ca2+ dynamics to be monitored through the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescence of fluo-3. Results of DBHQ photorelease experiments, performed in rat embryo fibroblasts (REF52 cell line) as well as in acutely isolated nodose neurons of adult ferret, are shown in Fig. 3. As expected, the data in Fig. 3 show that photorelease of DBHQ within cells lead to rapid, dose-dependent transient increases in [Ca2+]i. The resting cytosolic [Ca2+] is maintained through a dynamic balance of active pumping processes that remove Ca2+ from the cytosol and passive leaks that introduce Ca2+ into the cytosol. When photoreleased DBHQ disrupts the pump-leak balance by inhibiting the SERCA pumps, an increase in [Ca2+]i is observed. The [Ca2+]i rise is transient because SERCA inhibition by DBHQ is reversible and because free DBHQ is a small, uncharged, membrane-permeant molecule that is cleared from the cell by diffusion. Once DBHQ diffuses out of the cell and is lost to the bathing medium, inhibition of the SERCA pumps ceases, and the resting [Ca2+]i is re-established.Fig. 3Effect of DBHQ photorelease on [Ca2+]i. A, rat embryo fibroblast. B, ferret nodose neuron. Cells were loaded with Nmoc-DBHQ and fluo-3 indicator as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fluo-3 fluorescence data are presented as the relative intensity, F(t)/F0, where F(t) is the intensity at time t during an experiment, and F0 is the average intensity measured with the cell at rest (prior to photorelease). Arrowheads and associated numbers indicate, respectively, the times and durations of photolysis light flashes. Corresponding dips in the experimental traces are due to temporary interruption of fluorescence data acquisition by an electromechanical shutter to avoid exposure of the fluorescence photomultiplier tube to leakage from the high intensity photolytic flash. Each plus signs (+) on an experimental trace marks the first intensity datum collected after a photorelease episode.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Comparing the results from rat fibroblast and ferret nodose neuron (Fig. 3, A and B, respectively) shows that the kinetics of onset of the response to DBHQ photorelease are similar for the two cell types (rise times of 7.8 ± 3.4 and 6.2 ± 2.4 s, respectively). In contrast, decay of the response to photorelease appears more protracted in the nodose neuron. Whereas t1/2 for recovery from photorelease is of the order of 10-15 s in the fibroblast, in the nodose neuron the value increases to 40-50 s. The different kinetics of recovery likely reflect differences in the surface-to-volume ratios of the two cell types. Whereas the fibroblast is an adherent cell in monolayer culture with flat, extended morphology, and is at most a few microns in thickness, the acutely dissociated nodose neuron is spherical, with a diameter of ∼55 μm (19Jafri M.S. Weinreich D. J. Physiol. (Camb.). 1996; 493: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Clearance of photoreleased DBHQ from the cell interior by diffusion is thus expected to be slower for the nodose neuron than for the fibroblast.For demonstrating its usefulness in manipulating dynamic cellular phenomena, Nmoc-DBHQ was used to perturb [Ca2+]i oscillations. Highly regular calcium oscillations were initiated in REF52 fibroblasts by activation of the inositol trisphosphate signaling pathway coupled with depolarization (37Harootunian A.T. Kao J.P.Y. Tsien R.Y. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1988; 53: 935-943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as shown in Fig. 4A The effect of transient modulation of SERCA activity by photoreleasing DBHQ is shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen from Fig. 4B that pulsed inhibition of the SERCA pump produces distinct changes in the timing of [Ca2+] oscillations. 3The perturbation effects are the result of photorelease and are not observed when light flashes are delivered in the absence of caged reagent, as has been demonstrated previously (5Harootunian A.T.

Specifically, transient SERCA inhibition by DBHQ photorelease causes a delay in the occurrence of the next endogenous oscillation peak. Alternatively stated, DBHQ photorelease during an oscillation cycle increases the period of that cycle. The extent of period lengthening is in proportion to the amount of photorelease, with short light flashes producing only slight delays, whereas long flashes can cause significant period lengthening (Fig. 4B). Such quantitative information should be useful for constructing, as well as validating, biophysical models of intracellular Ca2+ dynamics (see for example Refs. 5Harootunian A.T. Kao J.P.Y.

Nmoc-DBHQ allows rapid and reversible modulation of the SERCA activity in living cells and should be useful for probing systems whose rapidly varying Ca2+ dynamics make study inaccessible through conventional techniques of reagent delivery. INTRODUCTIONIntracellular concentration and distribution of the ubiquitous second messenger Ca2+ is tightly controlled by a number of pathways (1Tsien R.W. Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 715-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). The interaction of the pathways that mobilize and regulate free Ca2+ levels can result in highly complex and dynamic signaling patterns, such as Ca2+ oscillations and waves (1Tsien R.W. Tsien R.Y.

Science. 1991; 251: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Although the role of second messengers themselves in dynamic signaling phenomena has been studied by photorelease techniques, the contribution of pathways that regulate second messenger levels remains unexplored.The family of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPases (SERCA) 1The abbreviations used are: SERCAsarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum ATPaseAMacetoxymethylDBHQ2,5-di(tert-butyl)hydroquinoneNmoco-nitromandelyloxycarbonyl. that sequester Ca2+ into the sarcoplasmic reticulum and endoplasmic reticulum are important regulators of cytosolic free Ca2+ levels (10Lytton J.

We reasoned that the effect of these pumps on Ca2+ oscillations and waves could be elucidated by the development of a method for the pulsed modulation of their activity. This could be accomplished by the preparation of a caged, reversible SERCA inhibitor. Of the known SERCA inhibitors (11Thomas D. Hanley M.R.

Intracellular concentration and distribution of the ubiquitous second messenger Ca2+ is tightly controlled by a number of pathways (1Tsien R.W. Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev.

https://openalex.org/W2161039306,"Southern blot analysis has demonstrated that the 5′ portion of the rabbit liver dexamethasone-inducible UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 2B13 RNA is related in sequence to a family of UGT genes (Tukey, R. H., Pendurthi, U. R., Nguyen, N. T., Green, M. D., and Tephly, T. R. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 15260-15266). To identify these additional gene transcripts, rabbit liver cDNA libraries were screened with a 5′ conserved 330-base pair UGT2B13 cDNA fragment, resulting in the isolation and characterization of several rabbit liver UGT cDNAs. One such clone, called pGT11, encodes a putative glycoprotein that is 78% similar to rabbit UGT2B13. The new UGT has been designated UGT2B16. The UGT2B16 gene is expressed as a single 4200-base RNA transcript that is regulated only in adult rabbits. The predicted NH2-terminal 25 amino acids of UGT2B16 are identical to that of rabbit liver UGT2B13, with the remainder of the protein being 77% similar to UGT2B13. Expressed UGT2B16 protein in COS-1 cells was active toward 4-hydroxybiphenyl, similar to that of UGT2B13. However, UGT2B16 efficiently conjugated 4-hydroxyestrone and 4-tert-butylphenol, substrates that are not efficiently catalyzed by UGT2B13. To further characterize the structural domains of UGT2B16 and UGT2B13, a series of chimeric cDNAs were constructed that contained portions of both UGT2B16 and UGT2B13. Chimeric 2B163002B13531, which contained the amino-terminal UGT2B16 amino acids 1-300 followed by amino acids 301-531 of UGT2B13, as well as chimeric 2B163582B13531 and 2B164342B13531 proteins, catalyzed the glucuronidation of 4-hydroxyestrone, indicating that the carboxyl terminus of UGT2B13 could substitute for those same regions on UGT2B16. However, the replacement of the carboxyl end of UGT2B13 with 2B16300-531 or 2B16434-531 dramatically impaired the catalytic function of the chimeric proteins. These results indicate that the carboxyl end of UGT2B13 plays an important role in the functional and possible conformational state of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W2162297602,"We investigated the inhibitory effects of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels in regulating class 3 aldehyde dehydrogenase (<i>aldh3</i>) gene expression using cultures of primary rat hepatocytes and transient transfection experiments with HepG2 cells. In addition to regulation by an <i>Ah</i> receptor-dependent mechanism, expression of many members of the <i>Ah</i> gene battery have been shown to be negatively regulated. As was seen for the cytochrome P450 (<i>cyp1A1</i>) gene, <i>aldh3</i> is transcriptionally inducible by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), and this induction involving function of the arylhydrocarbon (<i>Ah</i>) receptor is inhibited by the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors, 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine di-HCl (H7) and staurosporine. However, PAH induction of ALDH-3 activity, protein, and mRNA was potentiated 2-4-fold by addition of the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitors, <i>N</i>-(2-(methylamino)ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide di-HCl (H8) and <i>N</i>-(2-guanidinoethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide HCl (HA1004). These PKA inhibitors had no effect on the PAH induction of the <i>cyp1A1</i> Protein kinase A activity of cultured hepatocytes was specifically inhibited by H8 and HA1004 in a concentration-dependent manner, but not by H7, and there was an inverse correlation observed between potentiation of PAH-induced <i>aldh3</i> gene expression and inhibition of specific PKA activity by the PKA inhibitors. The cAMP analog dibutyryl cAMP, the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin, and the protein phosphatase 1 and 2A inhibitor okadaic acid all dramatically inhibited both PAH induction and H8 potentiation of PAH induction of <i>aldh3</i> expression but had no effect on induction of <i>cyp1A1</i> expression in cultured hepatocytes. Both basal and PAH-dependent expression of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression plasmid containing approximately 3.5 kilobase pairs of the 5′-flanking region of <i>aldh3</i> (pALDH3.5CAT) were enhanced 3-4-fold by the PKA inhibitor H8 but not by the PKC inhibitor H7 (>20 μM). cAMP analogs, activators of PKA activity, or protein phosphatase inhibitors diminished expression of the reporter gene in a manner identical to the native gene in cultured rat hepatocytes. Using deletion analysis of the pALDH3.5CAT construct, we demonstrated the existence of a negative regulatory region in the 5′-flanking region between −1057 and −991 base pairs which appears to be responsible for the cAMP-dependent regulation of this gene under both basal and PAH-induced conditions. At least two apparently independent mechanisms which involve protein phosphorylation regulate <i>aldh3</i> expression. One involves function of the <i>Ah</i> receptor which requires PKC protein phosphorylation to positively regulate both <i>aldh3</i> and <i>cyp1A1</i> gene expression and the other a cAMP-responsive process which allows PKA activity to negatively regulate expression of <i>aldh3</i> under either basal or inducible conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2086041288,"The α-globin of human hemoglobin was expressed in Escherichia coli and was refolded with heme in the presence and in the absence of native β-chains. The functional and structural properties of the expressed α-chains were assessed in the isolated state and after assembly into a functional hemoglobin tetramer. The recombinant and native hemoglobins were essentially identical on the basis of sensitivity to effectors (Cl− and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate), Bohr effect, CO binding kinetics, dimer-tetramer association constants, circular dichroism spectra of the heme region, and nuclear magnetic resonance of the residues in the α1β1 and α1β2 interfaces. However, the nuclear magnetic resonance revealed subtle differences in the heme region of the expressed α-chain, and the recombinant human normal adult hemoglobin (HbA) exhibited a slightly decreased cooperativity relative to native HbA. These results indicate that subtle conformational changes in the heme pocket can alter hemoglobin cooperativity in the absence of modifications of quaternary interface contacts or protein dynamics. In addition to incorporation into a HbA tetramer, the α-globin refolds and incorporates heme in the absence of the partner β-chain.

The basis of cooperative oxygen binding by human hemoglobin is an old problem that is being elucidated with the aid of modern technologies. Of particular importance is the elucidation of the properties of α- and β-chains, both in the isolated state and incorporated into the hemoglobin tetramer. Such studies should provide fine details on the linkage between tertiary and quaternary structure that forms the basis of cooperative oxygen binding. The recent development of hemoglobin expression systems offers great promise for facilitating the study of such structure-function relationships. This approach has been particularly useful for investigating the physicochemical properties of hemoglobin and myoglobin and has been employed in the development of hemoglobin variants with properties suitable for clinical use as red cell substitutes (1Vandegriff K.D.

In this paper we report the construction of a system for the synthesis of high levels of an α-globin fusion protein in E. coli. The conformational properties of the isolated chain are presented along with the functional and conformational characterization of reconstituted HbA tetramer following refolding of the expressed α-globin with heme in the presence of native β-chains. Spectral measurements and oxygen binding of these proteins reveal new insights into the linkage between the conformation of the heme pocket, ligand access channel, and quaternary interactions. The α-globin expression plasmid pNFα is structurally analogous to pJKO5, from which β-globin has been routinely produced as a fusion protein, and comprises 83 residues of a flu virus protein, NS1, a Factor X recognition sequence followed by β-globin. The construction of pNFα is similar to that of pJKO5 (6Fronticelli C. O'Donnell J.K. Brinigar W.S. J. Protein Chem. 1991; 10: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Human α-globin cDNA was provided by B. G. Forget (Yale University) as a 700-base pair PstI insert in pKT218 (8Michelson A.M. Markam A.F. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 472-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In an initial effort to express α-globin in E. coli, the 700-base pair PstI fragment was inserted into the PstI site of pKK-233-2 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and the short region between the NcoI sites at the initiation ATG site in the globin gene was subsequently removed by digestion with NcoI followed by religation. The resulting plasmid, pBα2, in JM101 induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside was found to produce very low levels of α-globin. Although unsatisfactory as an expression system, the 750-base pair NcoI to XmnI fragment from this plasmid was used as a source of the α-globin gene for the construction of pNFα. pNFα was constructed in two steps. The initial construct, pNα, was formed by inserting the NcoI to XmnI fragment from pBα2 into pJKO4 (6Fronticelli C. O'Donnell J.K. Brinigar W.S. J. Protein Chem. 1991; 10: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), from which the β-globin gene had been removed by digestion with NcoI and EcoRV. (Note that both EcoRV and XmnI produce blunt ended DNA.) pJKO4 codes for a fusion protein composed of 81 residues of NS1 followed by β-globin but does not have an intervening Factor X recognition sequence. pNα in E. coli strain AR120 (9Mott J.E.

A. 1985; 82: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), induced with nalidixic acid, produced high levels of the fusion protein NS1-α-globin (data not shown). A Factor X recognition sequence was inserted between the NS1 segment and α-globin by first digesting pNα with NcoI and making the DNA blunt ended with mung bean nuclease. Subsequent digestion with BglII removed the NS1 portion of the fused gene. This segment was replaced by the BglII to StuI fragment from pJKO1 (6Fronticelli C. O'Donnell J.K. Brinigar W.S. J. Protein Chem. 1991; 10: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which contains the same NS1 portion followed by a Factor X recognition sequence. The resulting plasmid, pNFα, is structurally identical to pJKO5 except that α-globin cDNA replaces the β-globin cDNA of pJKO5. This plasmid in strain AR120, induced with nalidixic acid, yielded large amounts of the NS1-FX-α-globin fusion protein as the principal component of the insoluble inclusion bodies. Growth, expression, and purification of the fusion protein followed a previously described protocol (6Fronticelli C. O'Donnell J.K. Brinigar W.S. J. Protein Chem. 1991; 10: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Enzymatic cleavage was monitored by reverse phase HPLC using a Vydac C4 column. The solvents were: A, 20% CH3CN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; and B, 60% CH3CN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The gradient was 44% B to 75% B over 120 min. Peaks were identified by eight cycles of Edman sequencing. Upon cleavage with Factor X, the α-globin was recovered as a precipitate, dissolved in a minimum volume of cold 0.1 M NaOH, and diluted to 2 mg/ml (A280 = 1.0 is taken as 1 mg/ml) with 0.04 M borate buffer, pH 9.0, 0.002 M EDTA. In order to solubilize the aggregates, the solution was deoxygenated by stirring under a constant stream of N2 followed by addition of dithiothreitol to a final concentration of 0.001 M. After 24 h at 4°C the protein was reconstituted with cyanoheme and native β-chains, prepared from carboxy-HbA by reaction with p-mercuribenzoate (10Bucci E. Fronticelli C. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). p-Mercuribenzoate was removed from the isolated β-chains as described by Geraci and Li (11Geraci, G., Li, T.-K., Biochemistry, 8, 1848–1854.Google Scholar). After 1 week the protein was concentrated and the heme converted to the CO derivative by addition of sodium dithionite under a stream of CO. The hemoglobin was purified on an affinity column of immobilized hemoglobin (12Rossi Fanelli M.R. Amiconi G. Antonini E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 92: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 13Chiancone E. Fronticelli C. Gattoni M. Urbaitis B.K. Bucci E. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 604: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The collected fractions were analyzed on paragon gel electrophoresis (Beckman Instruments). The α-globin was purified and reconstituted with cyanoheme as described. After 1 week at 4°C the protein was concentrated and the heme converted to the CO form followed by dialysis against 0.001 M NaCl saturated with CO. The αr were purified by preparative isoelectrofocusing (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The pH range of the ampholyte was 3-10. Screening of the fractions was carried out on paragon electrophoresis (Beckman). The ampholyte was removed by repetitive washing with water using a Centriprep concentrator (Amicon). The natural and recombinant α-globins were isolated from the respective hemoglobin using reverse phase HPLC and a Vydac C4 column (14Shelton J.B. Shelton J.R. Schroeder W.A. J. Liq. Chromatogr. 1981; 4: 1381-1392Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Prior to tryptic digestion, the isolated α-globins were S-pyridylethylated and desalted (15Bucci E. Fronticelli C. Gryczynski Z. Razynska A. Collins J.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3519-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). TPCK-treated trypsin (Sigma) was added to a ratio of 1:50 (w/w) and the solution let stand at room temperature for 20 h. The resulting clear solution was then injected into a 4.6 × 250 mm Vydac C18 column previously equilibrated with Buffer A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). The peptides were eluted using a gradient of 0-50% Buffer B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 9:1 (v/v) CH3CN:H2O) over 60 min. The absorbance was monitored at 220 nm. Sequences were determined using a Hewlett-Packard model G1005A protein sequencing system following the procedures standardized by the manufacturer. Oxygen equilibrium measurements were performed using the thin layer dilution technique of Dolman and Gill (16Dolman D. Gill S.J. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) with an Aviv 14DS spectrophotometer. In this technique the oxyhemoglobin is deoxygenated by stepwise dilution of the equilibrating gas with constant volumes of N2. Formation of methemoglobin as judged by spectral deconvolution of the initial and final spectra was less than 10%. Protein concentration was 1.5-2.0 mM in heme in 0.05 M HEPES buffer at 25°C. The experimental data were fitted to the Adair equation (17Adair G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 63: 529-545Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) using an iterative procedure incorporating the Marquardt algorithm, (Eq. 1) where Y is the fractional saturation with O2, pO2 is the partial pressure of oxygen in millimeters of mercury, and βi represents the overall Adair constants related to the intrinsic statistical affinity constant Ki of the subsequent steps of oxygenation by βi = πiKi. The value of the median ligand activity, Pm, was determinated using the relation Pm = β4−0.25 (18Wyman J. Gill S.J. Binding and Linkage. University Science Books, Mill Valley, CA1990Google Scholar). Flash photolysis was carried out on solutions containing 5 μM heme and 50 μM CO at 23°C in 0.1 M Bis-Tris (pH 7.0) containing 0.1 M KCl. Approximately 0.5 mg of sodium dithionite was added to reduce any ferric heme to the ferrous state. The instrumentation and experimental details for laser flash photolysis were essentially as described previously (19Markowitz A. Robinson R.C. Omata Y. Friedman F.K. Anal. Instrum. 1992; 20: 213-221Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). A pulse (0.6 μs) from a dye laser disrupted the photolabile heme Fe-CO bond, and the recombination of CO with the heme protein was then monitored by following the absorbance change at 436 nm. Data were transmitted to a microcomputer for processing and analysis. Standard multiexponential analysis of the kinetic data was performed according to, (Eq. 2) where ΔAt is the total absorbance change observed at time t, ai is the absorbance change for component i at t = 0, ki is the observed pseudo-first order rate constant for component i, and n is the number of independent components. Least square analysis was performed with RS/1 software (BBN Software Products, Cambridge, MA) on a Dell 450/ME microcomputer. Statistical significance (p < 0.05) was evaluated using Student's t test assuming equal variances. The CD spectra of the carboxyl derivatives were recorded in 0.05 M phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 using an Aviv CD 60 spectropolarimeter. Before recording the spectra hemoglobin was treated with dithionite under an atmosphere of CO and rapidly filtered through Sephadex G-25 resin. The optical spectra were deconvolved to verify that the heme was present only in the carboxyl form and to determine the exact protein concentration. The CD spectra, which are the average of three scans, were recorded every 0.3 nm using a bandwidth of 0.5 nm and a time constant of 1 s in a cuvette of 0.5 cm path length. Protein concentration was 0.2 mg/ml. The NMR experiments were carried out on a VXR-400/54 spectrometer operating at 9.4 tesla. All NMR spectra reported here were obtained at 29°C using the jump-and-return pulse sequence 90°(φ)-τ-90°(-φ) (20Plateau P. Gueron M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 7310-7311Crossref Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). The delay τ was adjusted for each experiment such that maximum excitation was obtained for the spectral region of interest. The relaxation delay between successive transients was 2.5 s. The proton chemical shifts are referenced to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate. 2In earlier NMR investigations of hemoglobin, proton chemical shifts have been referenced to the signal of water in each sample that is 4.73 ppm downfield from that of 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate at 29°C. For a detailed presentation of the conversion of the chemical shift scale in NMR spectra of hemoglobin, see Ho (22Ho C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1992; 43: 153-312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The samples of native HbA and αrHbA used for the NMR measurements were in 0.1 M Bis-Tris buffer, pH 6.85, in 90% H2O, 10% D2O. Hemoglobin concentration was between 7 and 9%, and methemoglobin content was 5% or less. Fig. 1 shows SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the total cell proteins before and after induction as well as the detergent-insoluble fusion protein. This figure illustrates the high expression level of NS1-FX-α-globin and shows that treatment of the insoluble fraction with detergent eliminates a large part of the contaminant proteins. The procedures for purification, cleavage, and reconstitution of the tetrameric hemoglobin were essentially the same as those used for βrHbA (6Fronticelli C. O'Donnell J.K. Brinigar W.S. J. Protein Chem. 1991; 10: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The pH values of the various reactions were increased due to the higher isoelectric point of the α-globin, which renders it less soluble than β-globin at pH 8.5. The yield of αrHbA was 15-20 mg/liter of cell culture. Cleavage of the fusion protein with Factor Xa was followed by reverse phase HPLC. Fig. 2A shows the elution pattern of the detergent-purified fusion protein, and Fig. 2B shows the elution pattern of the fusion protein following 20 h of digestion with Factor Xa. The major peak corresponds to α-globin with the correct amino-terminal end, whereas the smaller peak is a product of overdigestion, which occurs at Argα31(B12). Fig. 3, A and B, shows the tryptic peptide patterns obtained from normal and recombinant α-globins, respectively. The numbers above the peaks correspond to the tryptic fragments of the α-chain as listed in Table I. The HPLC profiles of tryptic digestion of the two α-globins are identical. Furthermore, five cycles of Edman sequential degradation on intact α-globins isolated from natural and recombinant HbA gave comparable yields of the expected 5 residues at the amino terminus. Sequence analysis of the peak eluting at 22 min identified an unresolved mixture of fragments 1 (residues 1-7) and 3 (residues 12-16). The peak eluting at 24 min contains fragment 1+2, a partial cleavage product (residues 1-11). The difference between peaks 12 and 13 eluting at 52 and 54 min is 1 Lys residue located at position α61(E10).Table ITryptic fragments of α-globins from native HbA and αrHbAFragmentResiduesSequence11-7VLSPADK28-11TNVK312-16AAWGK417-31VGAHAGEYGAEALER532-40MFLSFPTTK641-56TYFPHFDLSHGSAQVK757-60GHGK861K962-90VADALTNAVAHVDDMPNALSALSDLHAHK1091-92LR1193-99VDPVNFK12100-127LLSHCLLVTIAAHLPAEFTPAVHASLDK13128-139FLASVSTVLTSK14140-141YR Open table in a new tab -The spectrum in the Soret region is sensitive to the interaction of the heme with the surrounding aromatic residues (21Hsu M.-C. Woody R.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1971; 93: 3515-3525Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Fig. 4A shows the CD spectra of the carboxyl derivatives of HbA and αrHbA. Although these exhibit the same ellipticity at the peaks of their spectra, small differences are evident at lower wavelengths. Fig. 4B shows the CD spectra of native and recombinant α-chains. The recombinant α-chains have a lower ellipticity and a broader spectrum than the native α-chains. Fig. 5 shows the downfield region of the NMR spectra of αrHbA and HbA in the deoxy form. The resonances between 15 and 24 ppm originate from protons in the heme groups and/or from protons in amino acid residues located in the heme pockets. These resonances are shifted downfield by the hyperfine interactions between the corresponding protons and the unpaired electrons of the iron atoms. In deoxy-HbA, the hyperfine shifted resonances at 22.2 and 18.9 ppm have been assigned to the β-subunits, and those at 20.3 and 16.8 ppm have been assigned to the α-subunits (22Ho C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1992; 43: 153-312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Linstrom T.R. Ho C. Pisciotta A.V. Nature New Biol. 1972; 237: 263-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 24Takahashi S. Lin A.K.-L.C. Ho C. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5196-5202Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As shown in the figure, in deoxy-αrHbA the same hyperfine shifted resonances are observed, and their chemical shifts are, within experimental error, the same as in deoxy-HbA. The spectral region from 11 to 15 ppm in Fig. 5 contains several other hyperfine shifted resonances and four exchangeable proton resonances. The hyperfine shifted resonances are significantly broader than the exchangeable proton resonances (i.e. 350-500 versus 50-75 Hz). Due to these differences in the line widths and to the spectral overlap, only the exchangeable proton resonances in the spectral region 11-15 ppm in Fig. 5 can be observed accurately. In deoxy-HbA, these four exchangeable proton resonances have been assigned to specific hydrogen bonds in the Hb molecule as follows: the resonance at 14.1 ppm to the hydrogen bond between Tyrα42(C7) and Aspβ99(G1) at the α1β2 interface (25Fung L.W.-M. Ho C. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 2526-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 26Russu I.M. Ho N.T. Ho C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 914: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar); the resonance at 13.0 ppm to the hydrogen bond between Aspα126(H9) and Tyrβ35(C1) at the α1β1 interface; the resonance 12.2 ppm to the hydrogen bond between Hisα103(G10) and Asnβ108(G10) at the α1β1 interface (26Russu I.M. Ho N.T. Ho C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 914: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar); and the resonance at 11.1 ppm to the hydrogen bond between Aspα94(G1) and Trpβ37(C3) at the α1β2 interface (27Ishimori K. Imai K. Miyazaki G. Kitagawa T. Wada Y. Morimoto I. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3256-3264Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). 3The assignment of this resonance is currently tentative. For a detailed discussion of the possible origin of this resonance, see Ho (22Ho C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1992; 43: 153-312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in the figure, in deoxy-αrHbA these four exchangeable proton resonances are very close if not identical to those in deoxy-HbA. Our NMR results for αrHbA in the ligated state are shown in Fig. 6, Fig. 7. Fig. 6 shows the spectral region from 9.5-14.5 ppm. In carboxy-HbA, the resonances at 12.95, 12.1, and 10.2 ppm originate from exchangeable protons and have been assigned as follows: the resonance at 12.95 ppm to the hydrogen bond between Aspα126(H9) and Tyrβ35(C1) at the α1β1 interface (26Russu I.M. Ho N.T. Ho C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 914: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar); the resonance at 12.1 ppm to the hydrogen bond between Hisα103(G10) and Asnβ108(G10) at the α1β1 interface (26Russu I.M. Ho N.T. Ho C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 914: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar); and the resonance at 10.23 ppm to the hydrogen bond between Aspα94(G1) and Asnβ102(G4) at the α1β2 interface (25Fung L.W.-M. Ho C. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 2526-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In carboxy-αrHbA, these exchangeable proton resonances occur at the same spectral positions as those in carboxy-HbA.Fig. 7Ring-current shifted proton resonances of carbonmonoxy HbA (lower spectrum) and carbonmonoxy αrHbA (upper spectrum) in 0.1 M Bis-Tris buffer, pH 6.85, in 90% H2O, 10% D2O at 29°C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The spectra shown in Fig. 6 also contain several resonances from the heme groups. In carboxy-HbA these resonances are (28Dalvit C. Ho C. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3398-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 29Craescu C.T. Mispelter J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar): the resonance at 10.45 ppm (mesoproton γ of the heme in α-chains); the resonance at 10.1 ppm (mesoproton α of the heme in the β-chain); and the resonance at 9.7 ppm (mesoproton Δ of the hemes in α- and β-chains and mesoproton α of the heme in the α-chain). In carboxy-αrHbA, the latter two heme resonances occur at the same positions as in carboxy-HbA. However, the resonance of the mesoproton γ of the heme in α-chains (10.45 ppm) is missing from the spectrum. Fig. 7 shows the region from −2.2 to −0.4 ppm of the NMR spectra of carboxy-αrHbA and HbA. This region contains resonances from protons in the heme groups and/or amino acids in the heme pockets that are shifted upfield by the ring-current effect of the heme groups. In carboxy-HbA, the resonance at −1.77 ppm has been assigned to the γ2-CH3 protons of the distal Val residues in the α- and β-subunits, Valα62(E11) and Valβ67(E11) (28Dalvit C. Ho C. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3398-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7, the position of this resonance in carboxy-αrHbA is nearly identical to that in carboxy-HbA. The binding isotherms of HbA and αrHbA were measured using 1.5-2.0 mM heme, a concentration at which dimers and their associated complications are negligible. For these experiments, heme oxydation was below 5%, thus eliminating the need for adding the reducing system. The curves were analyzed according to the Adair equation (17Adair G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 63: 529-545Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and yielded the thermodynamic parameters listed in Table II. Although these parameters do not differ significantly within the 66.7% confidence limit, the cooperativity of αrHbA is decreased at all oxygen fractional saturations as shown in Fig. 8.Table II.Comparison of the oxygen binding parameters recovered for HbA and αrHbAHbAαrIIbAK1× 105 (mol−1)1.5 ± 0.31.9 ± 0.3K2× 105 (mol−1)0.9 ± 0.31.3 ± 0.2K3× 105 (mol−1)2.5 ± 1.50.8 ± 0.4K4× 105 (mol−1)33.0 ± 7.031.0 ± 6.0ΔGaCooperative free energy = −RT ln K4/K1.

https://openalex.org/W1970071018,"We have analyzed the structure of 18 S rRNA in native 40 S subunits using chemical modification followed by primer extension. The native subunits were modified using the single-stranded specific reagents dimethyl sulfate and 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbodiimide metho-p-toluenesulfonate. The modification pattern of the 18 S rRNA was compared to that obtained from derived 40 S subunits prepared by dissociation of unprogrammed 80 S ribosomes. Eighteen nucleotides showed different accessibility to the chemical probes in derived and native subunits. Half of these nucleotides were found in the central domain of the rRNA between the 1060 loop and the central pseudoknot. The remaining nucleotides were located in two clusters in the 5′- and 3′-domains of the 18 S rRNA. Derived 40 S subunits are free from non-ribosomal proteins. In contrast, native subunits are intermediates in protein synthesis initiation and contain stoichiometric amounts of initiation factor 3 (Sundkvist, I. C., and Staehelin, T. (1975) J. Mol. Biol. 99, 401-418). The possible role of this factor in altering the structure of 18 S rRNA in the native 40 S subunits is discussed.

Protein synthesis initiation in eukaryotes involves a number of different initiation factors (reviewed in Ref. 1Merrick W.C. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 291-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Initiation factor eIF-3 1The abbreviations used are: 40 SD and 40 SNderived and native 40 S subunits, respectivelyCMCT1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholino-ethyl)carbodiimide metho-p-toluenesulfonateDMSdimethyl sulfateeIF and IFeukaryotic and prokaryotic initiation factors, respectively. binds to 40 S subunits and prevents formation of unprogrammed 80 S ribosomes by inhibiting association of the 40 S and 60 S ribosomal subunits in the absence of mRNA. Initiation factor eIF-2 selects the specific initiator tRNA (Met-tRNAf) and brings it to the 40 S subunit. The resulting 43 S pre-initiation complex binds mRNA with the help of a series of initiation factors. The 60 S subunit now joins the mRNA containing 48 S initiation complex in a reaction that requires an additional initiation factor (eIF-5) and is associated with the hydrolysis of GTP. derived and native 40 S subunits, respectively 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholino-ethyl)carbodiimide metho-p-toluenesulfonate dimethyl sulfate eukaryotic and prokaryotic initiation factors, respectively. Several of the initiation factors are found to be associated with the so-called native 40 S ribosomal subunits (40 SN) in vivo (2Sundkvist I.C. Staehelin T. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 99: 401-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Most of these factors are present on the 40 SN particles in small quantities, but eIF-3 is present in stoichiometric amounts (2Sundkvist I.C. Staehelin T. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 99: 401-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Initiation factor 3 is a huge multisubunit protein with a total mass of approximately 0.7 MDa (3Nygård O. Westermann P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 697: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The factor displays RNA binding properties, and one of its subunits can be cross-linked to 18 S rRNA in the 40 S·eIF-3 complex (4Nygård O. Westermann P. Nucleic Acids. Res. 1982; 10: 1327-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This suggests that rRNA may, at least in part, be responsible for binding the factor to the small ribosomal subunit. However, the location of the eIF-3 interaction site in 18 S rRNA is not known. The ribosomal RNA is considered to be involved in various ribosomal functions such as A- and P-site-related activities and peptide bond formation (for a review see Ref. 5Noller H.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 191-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). In prokaryotes the rRNA is directly involved in the binding of initiation factors and mRNA during protein synthesis initiation (6Shine J. Dalgarno L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Less is known about the functional role of rRNA in the eukaryotic ribosome, but studies using chemical cross-linking and chemical and enzymatic footprinting have indicated that the rRNA is involved in mRNA binding, subunit interaction, and binding of elongation factors (10Graifer D.M.

In this report, we have compared the structures of 18 S rRNA in native and derived 40 S subunits using chemical modification. The two types of 18 S rRNAs showed distinct but limited structural differences. The role of the non-ribosomal proteins in altering the structure of the 18 S rRNA in the 40 SN particles is discussed. Dimethyl sulfate (DMS) and 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbodiimide metho-p-toluenesulfonate (CMCT) were from Aldrich Chemie (Germany).

EMBO J. 1982; 1: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Briefly, isolated monosomes (15Schreier M.H. Staehelin T. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 73: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) were suspended in 0.5 M KCl, 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 3 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. The material was layered onto continuous 10-40% (w/v) sucrose gradients containing 0.35 M KCl, 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 3 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. The derived 40 S subunits were separated from derived 60 S particles and undissociated 80 S ribosomes by centrifugation for 70 min at 50,000 rpm. Native 40 S subunits were prepared from rabbit reticulocytes as described by Sundkvist and Staehelin (2Sundkvist I.C. Staehelin T. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 99: 401-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The isolated subunits were suspended in Buffer A (0.25 M sucrose, 70 mM KCl, 30 mM Hepes/KOH, pH 7.6, and 5 mMβ-mercaptoethanol) containing 2 mM MgCl2. The subunits were stored at −80°C at a concentration of 6 μM. Chemical modification of the 18 S rRNA in derived or native 40 S subunits was performed as described previously using the single strand specific reagents DMS and CMCT (13Holmberg L. Melander Y. Nygård O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1374-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). DMS modifies single strand adenines and cytosines, whereas CMCT modifies unpaired uridines and guanines (16Ehresmann C. Baudin F. Mongel M. Romby P. Ebel J.P. Ehresmann B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 9109-9128Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). CMCT also modifies single strand cytosines at the pH used here (13Holmberg L. Melander Y. Nygård O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1374-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The ribosomal subunits were incubated for 5 min at 37°C in Buffer A containing 5 mM MgCl2 and modifying reagent (DMS or CMCT) as indicated. Control samples were treated identically with the exception that no modifying reagent was added. The 18 S rRNA was extracted from the derived and native 40 S subunits using phenol (17Brawerman G. Mendecki J. Lee S.Y. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The extracted RNA was precipitated with ethanol, collected by centrifugation, and dissolved in distilled water at a concentration of 1 pmol/μl. The material was stored in small aliquots at −80°C. End labeling of cDNA primers, primer extension, RNA sequencing, and gel electrophoresis were as described previously (18Holmberg L. Melander Y. Nygård O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21906-21910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gels were exposed to x-ray films, and the autoradiograms were analyzed using a microcomputer-assisted image analysis system (18Holmberg L. Melander Y. Nygård O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21906-21910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have used the two single strand specific reagents DMS and CMCT to study the structure of 18 S rRNA in native 40 S subunits. The footprinting pattern generated by the two reagents was compared to that of derived 40 S subunits prepared from isolated 80 S ribosomes. The native subunits are intermediates in protein synthesis initiation and contain additional non-ribosomal proteins (2Sundkvist I.C. Staehelin T. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 99: 401-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Due to these proteins, the 40 SN particles are unable to associate with 60 S subunits in the absence of proper initiation. The derived subunits lack the additional non-ribosomal proteins and can spontaneously form unprogrammed 80 S ribosomes in the presence of 60 S subunits. The 40 SD particles also have a tendency to dimerize. However, no such dimerization was found under the conditions used in these experiments (not shown). A comparison of the footprinting patterns obtained from the derived and native 40 S subunits showed that the reactivity of some of the bases in 18 S rRNA was different in the two types of particles (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). The affected nucleotides were concentrated in three regions. The first region, located in the 5′-domain, contained 3 bases that showed reduced accessibility to chemical modification in the native subunits. One of the bases, U44, was found in the interhelical sequence connecting helices 4 and 5. This was the only nucleotide in this part of the rRNA that was accessible to chemical modification in the derived 40 S subunits. The remaining 2 affected bases (U63 and U76) were located in hairpin 6. The latter base was only moderately exposed to chemical modification in the 40 SD particles.Fig. 2Autoradiograms showing the bases in 18 S rRNA that exhibit altered accessibility to chemical modification in native 40 S subunits relative to that in derived 40 S subunits. Native and derived 40 S ribsomal subunits were prepared as described under “Materials and Methods.” The subunits were incubated in the presence of 10 and 20 mM DMS or CMCT. The incubation was for 5 min (DMS) or 15 min (CMCT) at 37°C. Control samples were incubated in the absence of modifying reagent. CMCT modified bases in the sequences U36-A82 (A) and U1117-C1207 (C). DMS modified bases in the sequences A1036-C1065 (B), A1075-C1207 (D), and C1554-U1579 (E).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The second affected region was found in the central domain of the 18 S rRNA. Hairpin 25 contained four nucleotides that showed altered reactivity in the 40 SN particles. Two of the nucleotides, A1044 and A1060, became less exposed to chemical modification in the native particles. A1044 is involved in a canonic Watson-Crick base pair in the helical stem, while A1060 is found in the apical loop of hairpin 25. The apical loop also contained 2 bases, A1064 and A1065, that showed increased reactivity in the 40 SN particles. These were the only nucleotides in the 18 S rRNA that were more accessible to chemical modification in native than in derived subunits. The adjacent helix 27 contained 2 bases, U1117 and C1134, that were protected against modification in the 40 SN particles. These bases were located in the apical and internal loops of the helix, respectively. The internal loop also contained 1 base, G1133, that served as a natural stop for the reverse transcriptase in the derived subunits. This natural stop was almost absent in 18 S rRNA from the native subunits, indicating that this site was only available for limited nucleolytic attack in the derived 40 S subunits. The hinge region between the three domains in 18 S rRNA contained 2 bases U1195 and A1198 that were very exposed in 40 SD subunits but became almost completely inaccessible to modification in the 40 SN particles. One additional protected base, C1182, was found in the apical loop of the adjacent hairpin 29. The latter base was less exposed to chemical modification in the 40 SD particles than the previous 2 bases. However, this base was also almost completely protected against modification in the native particles. Our structural analysis also covered the whole 3′-domain with the exception of the 39 bases located at the 3′-end of the 18 S rRNA. The analysis showed that the domain contained a cluster of 6 bases that were less accessible for chemical modification in 40 SN particles than in derived subunits. The affected bases (C1554, A1557, C1563, C1569, C1573, and C1575) were located in hairpin 44, where 3 of these bases (A1557, C1563, and C1573) were involved in putative Watson-Crick base pairs. Most of the affected bases were only moderately accessible for chemical modification in the 40 SD particles. We have analyzed and compared the structure of 18 S rRNA in derived and native 40 S ribosomal subunits. Eighteen of the nucleotides in 18 S rRNA were found to react differently to the chemical probes CMCT and DMS in the two types of ribosomal subunits. As the 40 SN particles contain additional non-ribosomal proteins it seems reasonable to assume that these additional proteins cause the structural differences seen in the modification pattern of the 18 S rRNAs obtained from the derived and native subunits. The effect could be due to a direct interaction of these proteins with the rRNA or caused by indirect structural rearrangements induced by the extra proteins. The footprinting technique cannot distinguish between these two possibilities. The increased exposure of A1064 and C1065 must clearly depend on structural alterations in the rRNA, but the cause of the protections is less obvious. Data based on protein synthesis experiments show that the 40 SN particles contain initiation factors eIF-3, eIF-2, eIF-4A, eIF-4B, and eIF-5 (2Sundkvist I.C. Staehelin T. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 99: 401-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Most of these factors are present in less than stoichiometric amounts on the 40 SN particle, but eIF-3 is present in a close to 1:1 complex with the 40 S subunit. Furthermore, ribosome-bound eIF-3 can be cross-linked to 18 S rRNA (4Nygård O. Westermann P. Nucleic Acids. Res. 1982; 10: 1327-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems likely that the structural differences seen between 18 S rRNA in 40 SD and 40 SN are caused by the presence of eIF-3 on the native particles. The interaction between IF-3 (the prokaryotic homolog to eIF-3 (19Szekely M. From DNA to Protein; The Transfer of Genetic Information. The Macmillan Press Ltd., London1980: 239-278Google Scholar)) with 16 S rRNA in the 30 S subunit has been studied by site directed mutagenesis, footprinting, and direct cross-linking (7Ehresmann C. Moine H. Mougel M. Dondon J. Grunberg-Manago M. Ebel J.-P. Ehresmann B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4803-4821Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 8Muralikrishna P. Wickstrom E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7505-7510Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 9Moazed D. Samaha R.R. Gualerzi C. Noller H.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 207-210PubMed Google Scholar, 20Tapprich W.E. Goss D.J. Dahlberg A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4927-4931Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These techniques show the importance of the central domain for ribosomal binding of IF-3. Ribosome-bound IF-3 alters the accessibility of nucleotides in hairpins 23, 24, and 25 (mouse numbering) from modification by CMCT, kethoxal, and RNase V1 (8Muralikrishna P. Wickstrom E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7505-7510Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 9Moazed D. Samaha R.R. Gualerzi C. Noller H.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 207-210PubMed Google Scholar). The involvement of the latter loop in IF-3 binding was also shown by mutagenesis (20Tapprich W.E. Goss D.J. Dahlberg A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4927-4931Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Furthermore, nucleotides in the adjacent region between helices 25 and 20 have been directly cross-linked to IF-3, and the ribosome-bound factor increases the susceptibility of the phosphodiester bond in this region for attack by RNase V1 (7Ehresmann C. Moine H. Mougel M. Dondon J. Grunberg-Manago M. Ebel J.-P. Ehresmann B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4803-4821Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 8Muralikrishna P. Wickstrom E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7505-7510Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the footprinting pattern of the central domain differed in derived and native 40 S subunits. Nucleotides with altered reactivities were found in hairpin 25 and in the sequence between the helices 25 and 20. However, no footprints were detected in helices 23 and 24 from 40 SN particles. Instead, marked differences in the footprinting pattern between derived and native subunits were seen in the sequence preceding the central pseudoknot. Although the homologous region in prokaryotes has not been cross-linked or footprinted by components of the initiation machinery, the central pseudoknot region seems to be linked to the initiation process. The pseudoknot undergoes conformational changes during the transition from inactive to active 30 S subunits (21Ericson G. Wollenzien P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 540-545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a transition that can be induced by initiation factors (22Zamir A. Miskin R. Elson D. FEBS Lett. 1969; 3: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 23Zamir A. Miskin R. Elson D. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 60: 347-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Mutations that disturb the central pseudoknot prevent polysome formation presumably by interfering with the initiation process (24Brink M.F. Verbeet M.P. de Boer H.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3987-3996Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 25Brakier-Gingras L. Pinard R. Dragon F. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Two bases in the apical loop of hairpin 25 (A1064 and C1065) showed increased exposure to chemical modification in the native subunits. The homologous sites in 16 S rRNA interact with P-site-bound tRNA (26Moazed D. Noller H.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that this site is open for interaction with the initiator tRNA in the native particles. Half of the nucleotides that displayed different chemical reactivity in native and derived subunits were found outside of the central domain in regions that have not been linked to any initiation-dependent ribosomal function. Could these nucleotides be protected from chemical modification by ribosome-bound eIF-3? eIF-3 is considerably larger than IF-3, and although the two proteins are homologs, they have similar but not identical functions in protein synthesis (19Szekely M. From DNA to Protein; The Transfer of Genetic Information. The Macmillan Press Ltd., London1980: 239-278Google Scholar). The difference in size and function may suggest that the two proteins do not bind to the respective ribosomes at completely identical sites. One other explanation for the additional sites could be the differences in salt concentration used in the various footprinting studies. Here we have used a salt concentration optimal for in vitro protein synthesis (3Nygård O. Westermann P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 697: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 27Westermann P. Nygård O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 8887-8897Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) to avoid salt-induced destabilization of the native 40 S subunits during the modification experiments. Thus, the Mg2+ concentration used here is considerably lower than that used during the footprinting of IF-3 on the 16 S rRNA (8Muralikrishna P. Wickstrom E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7505-7510Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 9Moazed D. Samaha R.R. Gualerzi C. Noller H.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 207-210PubMed Google Scholar). Variations in the Mg2+ concentration affect the accessibility of the nucleotides in 18 S rRNA for chemical modification. Such effects are seen between helices 4 and 7. 2Y. Melander, L. Holmberg, and O. Nygård, manuscript in preparation. It is of course also possible, although less likely, that the additional reactivity changes were caused by the non-ribosomal proteins present in substoichiometric amounts on the 40 SN particles. Native subunits are prevented from premature association with the 60 S subunit by eIF-3 (1Merrick W.C. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 291-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Emanuilov et al. (28Emanuilov I. Sabatini D.D. Lake J.A. Freienstein C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 1389-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) found that the binding site of eIF-3 on 40 SN subunits was partly overlapping the interface region of the particle, suggesting that the ribosome-bound factor directly interferes with subunit joining. However, others have found that eIF-3 binds to the 40 S subunit without interfering with the interface (29Westermann P. Benndorf R. Lutsch G. Bielka H. Nygård O. Hardesty B. Kramer G. Structure, Function, and Genetics of Ribosomes. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1986: 642-657Google Scholar, 30Lutsch G. Stahl J. Kärgel H.-J. Noll K. Bielka H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 51: 140-150Google Scholar) (Fig. 3C). Cross-linking experiments have shown that eIF-3 can be cross-linked to a number of ribosomal proteins depending on the length of the reagent used (31Gross B. Westermann P. Bielka H. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 32Tolan D.R. Hershey J.W. Traut R.T. Biochimie (Paris). 1983; 65: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Some of these proteins are clearly interface proteins (14Nygård O. Nika H. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 33Uchiumi T. Kikuchi M. Ogata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9663-9667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that part of the binding site for eIF-3 overlaps the subunit interface. Where are the affected rRNA sites located on the native 40 S subunit? Unfortunately, nothing is known about the folding of 18 S rRNA in the small ribosomal subunit. However, Brimacombe (34Brimacombe R. Biochimie (Paris). 1992; 74: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 35Brimacombe R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 365-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) has suggested a model for the three-dimensional folding of 16 S rRNA in the prokaryotic 30 S subunit. The general structures of the 16 S-like rRNAs and the basic topology of the 30 S and 40 S subunits are similar (36Gutell R.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3502-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 37Neefs J.M. Van de Peer Y. Hendriks L. De Wachter R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2237-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 38Verschoor A. Srivastava S. Grassucci R. Frank J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems reasonable to assume that the homologous helices have the same location in the 30 S and 40 S particles. If so, the affected sites in the central domain would be located at the protuberance side of the 40 S subunit close to the rRNA sites affected by subunit-subunit interaction (11Holmberg L. Melander Y. Nygård O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2776-2783Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), while the affected sites in the 5′- and 3′-domains would be positioned in the middle of the body and in the head, respectively. The co-localization of rRNA structures involved in subunit-subunit interaction and in the binding of eIF-3 to the protuberance indicates that structural alterations in this region of the rRNA could be involved in preventing premature association of the 40 SN particle with the large ribosomal subunit."

This drug is known to induce a disassembly of the proximal part of the Golgi complex, resulting in a redistribution of cis-, medial-, and trans-Golgi resident enzymes back to the endoplasmic reticulum, and to block the anterograde transport of proteins to the trans-Golgi network. Although the total incorporation of [3H]glucosamine into glycosaminoglycan chains was reduced to about 25% in brefeldin A-treated cells compared to control cells, both control cells and cells treated with brefeldin A synthesized heparin as well as chondroitin sulfate chains. Therefore, enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of both types of glycosaminoglycan chains seem to be present proximal to the trans-Golgi network in these cells. Chondroitin sulfate and heparin synthesized in cells exposed to brefeldin A were undersulfated, as demonstrated by ion-exchange chromatography, compositional analyses of disaccharides, as well as by a lower [35S]sulfate/[3H]glucosamine ratio compared to controls. In heparin biosynthesis, both N- and O-sulfation reactions were impaired, with a larger relative decrease in 2-O-sulfation than in 6-O-sulfation. Despite undersulfation, the heparin chains synthesized in the presence of brefeldin A were larger (30 kDa) than the heparin synthesized by control cells (20 kDa). The reduced [3H]glucosamine incorporation in brefeldin A-treated cells was partly due to decreased number of glycosaminoglycan chains synthesized, but also to the biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate chains of smaller molecular size (8 versus 15 kDa in control cells). Brefeldin A had no effect on the glycosaminoglycan synthesis when used in a cell-free, microsomal fraction, indicating that brefeldin A does not interfere directly with the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans.

This is also the case in several strictly aerobic archaea, including Sulfolobus sp. strain 7, which contains nearly complete sets of the membrane-bound proteins for aerobic respiration (7Iwasaki T.

Matsuura K. Oshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30881-30892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar)). In earlier studies, Oesterhelt and co-workers (17Kerscher L. Oesterhelt D. FEBS Lett. 1977; 83: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 18Kerscher L. Nowitzki S. Oesterhelt D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 128: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) have established that ferredoxins from the aerobic, thermoacidophilic archaea function as an effective electron acceptor of the cognate coenzyme A-acylating 2-oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductases, the key enzymes of the archaeal oxidative tricarboxylic acid cycle and pyruvate oxidation (8Kerscher L. Oesterhelt D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1982; 7: 371-374Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Later, these ferredoxins were found to contain an unusually long N-terminal extension region of unknown function, which was not detected in the bacterial type ferredoxins from other sources (10Iwasaki T.

Tanaka, T. Oshima, and co-workers have determined the 2.0-Å resolution crystal structure of a dicluster type ferredoxin from Sulfolobus sp. strain 7 (optimal growth conditions, pH 2.5-3 and 80°C) (10Iwasaki T. Wakagi T. Isogai Y. Tanaka K. Iizuka T. Oshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29444-29450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wakagi T. Oshima T. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1986; 7: 342-345Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar) with the R-factor of 17.9% by multiple isomorphous replacement method (23Fujii T. Moriyama H. Takenaka A. Tanaka N. Wakagi T. Oshima T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 472-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). 1Fujii, T., Hata, Y., Wakagi, T., Tanaka, N., and Oshima, T. (1996) Nat. Struct. Biol. 3, 834-837. This led to an unexpected finding that, in addition to two FeS clusters, a tightly bound zinc atom is coordinated by His16, His19, His34, and Asp78 in a tetragonal fashion, in the boundary between the N-terminal extension region (containing three histidine ligand residues) and the pseudo-2-fold symmetrical “ferredoxin core-fold” portion (containing one aspartate ligand residue), fixing these together.1 Thus, the Sulfolobus sp. ferredoxin appears to be the first example that inherently contains an additional metal, i.e. Zn2+, besides the iron atoms. The tetragonal ligation of the novel zinc center in the Sulfolobus sp. ferredoxin is similar to those of other structurally unrelated zinc-containing proteins, e.g adenosine deaminase and carbonic anhydrase in which a zinc center is coordinated by three histidine residues and a water molecule (24Wilson D.K. Rudolph F.B. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1991; 252Google Scholar, 25Eriksson A.E. Liljas A. Proteins. 1993; 16: 29-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In order to investigate a possibility of the presence of an additional metal center in other ferredoxins containing the long N-terminal extension region, we have performed chemical and spectroscopic characterization of an another example of a bacterial type ferredoxin with a long N-terminal extension region from a thermoacidophilic archaeon, Thermoplasma acidophilum (optimal growth conditions, pH 1.8 and 56°C) (26Yasuda M. Oyaizu H. Yamagishi A. Oshima T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 3482-3485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we report that T. acidophilum ferredoxin (19Wakabayashi S. Fujimoto N. Wada K. Matsubara H. Kerscher L. Oesterhelt D. FEBS Lett. 1983; 162: 21-24Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar) is in fact a 7Fe ferredoxin containing a zinc center, as in the case of Sulfolobus sp. ferredoxin. In addition, the amino acid sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree analyses of several archaeal ferredoxins provide strong evidence that ferredoxins with a long N-terminal extension region derived from several thermoacidophilic archaea (10Iwasaki T.

The possible zinc-binding ligand residues are strictly conserved in the archaeal zinc-containing ferredoxins. DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow and Sephadex G-50 gels were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Water was purified by the Milli-Q purification system (Millipore). Other chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade. T. acidophilum strain HO-62 cells, originally isolated from hot sulfur springs at Owakudani solfataric field in Hakone, Japan, were cultivated at pH 1.8 and at 56°C as described by Yasuda et al (26Yasuda M. Oyaizu H. Yamagishi A. Oshima T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 3482-3485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Thermoplasma ferredoxin was purified essentially as outlined by Kerscher et al (18Kerscher L. Nowitzki S. Oesterhelt D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 128: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), using a DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Pharmacia) connected to a Pharmacia fast protein liquid chromatography and a Sephadex G-50 column chromatography. Purified ferredoxin had a purity index (A402/A280) of 0.53 (18Kerscher L. Nowitzki S. Oesterhelt D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 128: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and showed a single band on 20% analytical polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the absence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Sulfolobus sp. strain 7 cells, originally isolated from Beppu hot springs, Japan, were cultivated aerobically and chemoheterotrophically at pH 2.5-3 and 75-80°C, and the archaeal ferredoxin was routinely purified as described previously (10Iwasaki T.

J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 472-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The cognate 2-oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductase has been purified as described elsewhere (10Iwasaki T. Wakagi T. Isogai Y. Tanaka K. Iizuka T. Oshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29444-29450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Zhang Q. Iwasaki T. Wakagi T. Oshima T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 587-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Absorption spectra were recorded as described previously (10Iwasaki T. Wakagi T. Isogai Y. Tanaka K. Iizuka T. Oshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29444-29450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Electron paramagnetic resonance measurements were carried out using a JEOL JEX-RE1X spectrometer equipped with an Air Products model LTR-3 Heli-Tran cryostat system, in which temperature was monitored with a Scientific Instruments series 5500 temperature indicator/controller, or a JEOL JES-FE3XG spectrometer equipped with an Air Products model LTR-3-110 Heli-Tran cryostat system, in which temperature was monitored with a Scientific Instruments series 5500 temperature indicator/controller. Spin concentrations were estimated by double integration, with 0.1 and 1 mM Cu-EDTA as standards. Low temperature resonance Raman spectra were recorded at 77 K using 488.0 nm (500 mW) and 457.9 nm (200 mW) Ar+ laser excitation as described previously (28Imai T. Urushiyama A. Saito H. Sakamoto Y. Ota K. Ohmori D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The sample was immersed into a liquid nitrogen reservoir, and the scattered light near 45° to the incident beam was collected. The spectral slit width was 4 cm−1, and a multiscan averaging technique was employed. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry was performed by a Finnigan MAT VISION 2000 instrument at an accelerating potential of 5.0 kV, using 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid as a matrix. The average mass estimated by this method gave that of apoferredoxin when the analysis was performed either with a holo- or apoprotein preparation. Metal content analyses were carried out by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry with a Seiko SPS 1500 VR instrument at the Tokyo Institute of Technology and a Jobin-Yvon JY 38S instrument at Rigaku Ltd. The phylogenetic trees were constructed by the parsimony and neighbor-joining methods using the phylogenetic analysis program package, Phylip 3.5c (29Felsenstein J. Cladistics. 1989; 5: 164-166Google Scholar). All amino acid sequence data of archaeal and hyperthermophile ferredoxins used for phylogenetic calculations in this study were obtained from the PIR and EMBL data bank, except for that from Sulfolobus sp. strain 7 (accession no. D78179). 2Wakagi, T., Fujii, T., and Oshima, T. (1996) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 225, 489-493 (accession no. D78179). The distance matrix was estimated using the Dayhoff PAM matrix for the neighbor-joining method. Reliability of the phylogenetic trees thus constructed was estimated through the bootstrap analysis with 100 replicates. The x-ray crystal structure of the dicluster ferredoxin from Sulfolobus sp. strain 7 at 2.0-Å resolution has demonstrated the presence of a novel zinc center which is ligated by His16, His19, His34, and Asp78 in a tetragonal coordination, in the boundary between the N-terminal extension and the FeS cluster-binding core regions, fixing these together.1 The metal content analysis of the isolated Sulfolobus sp. ferredoxin in solution also showed the presence of a tightly bound zinc atom, in a ratio of ∼6.4-6.9 Fe/Zn (mol/mol; data not shown). The zinc atom could not be removed by dialysis against buffer containing 5 mM EDTA. These data suggest that the Sulfolobus sp. ferredoxin inherently contains an additional metal binding site specific to zinc atom, beside two FeS clusters. For comparison, we have also purified a 7Fe ferredoxin from a thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus strain HB8 (30Sato S.K. Nakazawa K. Hon-nami K. Oshima T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 668: 277-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) using the same buffer system: The purified ferredoxin gave an average mass (M + H)1+ of ∼8684 by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, being consistent with the value estimated from the primary structure (8687 Da) (30Sato S.K. Nakazawa K. Hon-nami K. Oshima T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 668: 277-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and contained no zinc atom. 3T. Iwasaki and T. Oshima, unpublished results. In order to investigate whether the zinc center is unique to the Sulfolobus sp. ferredoxin, another bacterial-type ferredoxin with a long N-terminal extension has been purified to an electrophoretically homogeneous state from a thermoacidophilic archaeon, T. acidophilum strain HO-62 (26Yasuda M. Oyaizu H. Yamagishi A. Oshima T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 3482-3485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), according to the guidelines of Kerscher et al (18Kerscher L. Nowitzki S. Oesterhelt D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 128: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The purified ferredoxin of T. acidophilum strain HO-62 had a purity index (A402/A280) of 0.53, and showed the optical properties identical to those reported previously by Kerscher et al (18Kerscher L. Nowitzki S. Oesterhelt D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 128: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The N-terminal 15 amino acid residues of the purified ferredoxin (VKLEELDFKPKPIDE) were completely identical to that reported previously by Wakabayashi et al. (19Wakabayashi S. Fujimoto N. Wada K. Matsubara H. Kerscher L. Oesterhelt D. FEBS Lett. 1983; 162: 21-24Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Moreover, the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry of the purified protein gave an average mass (M + H)1+ of ∼15960 (data not shown), which is significantly close to the value estimated from the primary structure of T. acidophilum apoferredoxin (15963 Da) (19Wakabayashi S. Fujimoto N. Wada K. Matsubara H. Kerscher L. Oesterhelt D. FEBS Lett. 1983; 162: 21-24Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the ferredoxin purified from T. acidophilum strain HO-62 is essentially identical to that previously reported by Kerscher and co-workers (18Kerscher L. Nowitzki S. Oesterhelt D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 128: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 19Wakabayashi S. Fujimoto N. Wada K. Matsubara H. Kerscher L. Oesterhelt D. FEBS Lett. 1983; 162: 21-24Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and contains a long N-terminal extension region. Metal content analysis by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry showed that the purified ferredoxin contained a tightly bound zinc atom (6.8 Fe/Zn (mol/mol)). The following metals were not detected: molybdenum, cobalt, nickel, and copper. In conjunction with the primary structural evidence suggesting two sets of FeS cluster-binding motifs (19Wakabayashi S. Fujimoto N. Wada K. Matsubara H. Kerscher L. Oesterhelt D. FEBS Lett. 1983; 162: 21-24Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar), this indicates that T. acidophilum ferredoxin contains a unique zinc center beside two FeS clusters (see below). The properties of the FeS clusters in T. acidophilum ferredoxin were investigated by X-band EPR spectroscopy (Fig. 1). The EPR spectrum at 8.2 K of the isolated T. acidophilum ferredoxin elicited a sharp g = 2.02 signal (∼1.1 spin/mol), whose EPR lineshape and temperature dependence (data not shown) are characteristic of a [3Fe-4S]1+ cluster (Fig. 1, trace A). Upon reduction by excess sodium dithionite at pH 6.8, the relative intensity of this EPR signal decreased by ∼85%, indicating the partial reduction of the [3Fe-4S] cluster, but no additional EPR signal could be detected (data not shown). Because the decrease of the A402 nm peak in the optical spectrum of the purified protein was ∼20% under the conditions, these data suggest the presence of a lower potential [4Fe-4S] cluster that is not readily reduced by dithionite, in addition to a [3Fe-4S] cluster. This was further supported by the EPR spectra at 8.2 K of T. acidophilum ferredoxin anaerobically reduced by excess dithionite at pH 9.3 (Fig. 1, traces B and C). The [3Fe-4S] cluster was fully reduced, thus giving rise to a very broad low field resonance at g ∼ 11, which is characteristic of the reduced S = 2 [3Fe-4S]0 cluster (Fig. 1, trace C). In addition, a rhombic EPR signal at gz,y,x = 2.06, 1.94, and 1.88 attributed to the reduced S = 1/2 [4Fe-4S]1+ cluster, was detected together with additional wings on the high and low filed sides of the main EPR signal (g = 2.13 and 1.78) which are due to the magnetic interactions with the reduced S = 2 [3Fe-4S]0 cluster (Fig. 1, trace B). These properties are characteristic of those of conventional reduced 7Fe ferredoxins. The properties of the oxidized FeS clusters of T. acidophilum ferredoxin were further investigated by the low temperature resonance Raman spectroscopy, which was performed at 77 K using 488.0 nm and 457.9 nm Ar+ ion laser excitation (Fig. 2, traces A and B). On the basis of extensive assignments by Johnson and co-workers (31Johnson M.K. Czernuszewicz R.C. Spiro T.G. Fee J.A. Sweeney W.V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1983; 105: 6671-6678Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 32Czernuszewicz R.S. Macor K.A. Johnson M.K. Gewirth A. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 7178-7187Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar), two weak bands at 334 cm−1 and ∼358 cm−1, whose signal relative intensities were enhanced upon 457.9 nm Ar+ ion laser excitation (Fig. 2, trace B), were assigned to be associated primarily with Fe-S bridging mode and Fe-S terminal mode, respectively, of a conventional biological [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster with the D2d structure. On the other hand, the [3Fe-4S]1+ cluster exhibited three bands associated primarily with Fe-S bridging modes at 265 cm−1, ∼288 cm−1, and 347 cm−1, and at least two bands associated primarily with Fe-S terminal modes at 369 cm−1 and 387 cm−1 (31Johnson M.K. Czernuszewicz R.C. Spiro T.G. Fee J.A. Sweeney W.V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1983; 105: 6671-6678Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 32Czernuszewicz R.S. Macor K.A. Johnson M.K. Gewirth A. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 7178-7187Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus, although 7Fe ferredoxin of T. acidophilum strain HO-62 contains a zinc center, the EPR and resonance Raman spectral properties are very similar to those of conventional 7Fe ferredoxins reported earlier (31Johnson M.K. Czernuszewicz R.C. Spiro T.G. Fee J.A. Sweeney W.V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1983; 105: 6671-6678Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar), clearly demonstrating the existence of common [3Fe-4S] and [4Fe-4S] core structures. As in the cases reported for the Sulfolobus and Desulfolofulbus 7Fe ferredoxins (10Iwasaki T. Wakagi T. Isogai Y. Tanaka K. Iizuka T. Oshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29444-29450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Teixeira M. Batista R. Campos A.P. Gomes C. Mendes J. Pacheco I. Anemüller S. Hagen W.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 322-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), anaerobic reduction of T. acidophilum ferredoxin with the purified Sulfolobus sp. 2-oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (27Zhang Q. Iwasaki T. Wakagi T. Oshima T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 587-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) suggested that, of two FeS clusters, only the higher potential [3Fe-4S] cluster was reduced enzymatically, while the lower potential [4Fe-4S] cluster was not (data not shown). 4The reduction level at A402 nm of T. acidophilum ferredoxin by the purified Sulfolobus 2-oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (27Zhang Q. Iwasaki T. Wakagi T. Oshima T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 587-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) was ∼20% under the steady-state conditions in the presence of 4 mM 2-oxoacid and 100 μM coenzyme A for 60 min at pH 6.8 and at 50°C. No EPR signal for the reduced [4Fe-4S]1+ cluster was detected under these conditions. The same results have been obtained with Sulfolobus sp. ferredoxin (10Iwasaki T. Wakagi T. Isogai Y. Tanaka K. Iizuka T. Oshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29444-29450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, the chemical and spectroscopic analyses suggest the presence of one zinc center, one higher potential [3Fe-4S] cluster, and one lower potential [4Fe-4S] cluster in T. acidophilum ferredoxin. For reasons discussed below, the zinc center probably represents an inherent metal rather than an adventitiously bound atom. Of all amino acid sequences of the bacterial type ferredoxins reported to date, only four ferredoxins, all of which have been derived from thermoacidophilic archaea, are known to possess a long N-terminal extension region (10Iwasaki T.

Fujimoto N. Wada K. Matsubara H. Kerscher L. Oesterhelt D. FEBS Lett. 1983; 162: 21-24Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We have found, however, by careful amino acid sequence alignment that all four ligand residues which have been identified as ligands to the tetragonal zinc center in Sulfolobus sp. ferredoxin (His16, His19, His34, and Asp78)1 are strictly conserved among these ferredoxins (Fig. 3). Thus, these archaeal ferredoxins show the overall amino acid sequence homology. Since both the purified Sulfolobus and Thermoplasma dicluster ferredoxins contained a stoichiometric amount of a zinc atom as mentioned in the preceding section, we suggest that a bacterial-type ferredoxin containing a long N-terminal extension region with the consensus three histidine motif (Fig. 3) would bind a zinc ion, beside one or two conventional FeS clusters. A tentative model of possible metal-binding ligand residues of T. acidophilum zinc-containing 7Fe ferredoxin is schematically presented in Fig. 4, in light of the three-dimensional structure of the Sulfolobus sp. ferredoxin.1 It should be remembered that this is a putative schematic drawing, and the detailed characterization of the coordination environments of the zinc center of T. acidophilum ferredoxin would require the extended x-ray absorption fine structure or the x-ray crystallography analyses. However, at this stage limited availability of the archaeal ferredoxin, due largely to extremely slow growth and poor yield of T. acidophilum strain HO-62 cells (26Yasuda M. Oyaizu H. Yamagishi A. Oshima T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 3482-3485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), has made such analyses practically difficult.Fig. 4A schematic model of possible ligand residues of a zinc-containing 7Fe ferredoxin from T. acidophilum strain HO-62. This putative model was deduced on the bases of the sequence alignments of the N-terminal extension regions (Fig. 3) and the three-dimensional structure of Sulfolobus sp. ferredoxin (accession no. 1XER).

Some of these ferredoxins have been shown to serve at least as an electron acceptor of the cognate 2-oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductases (10Iwasaki T. Wakagi T. Isogai Y. Tanaka K. Iizuka T. Oshima T.

The details of the amino acid sequence alignment of archaeal ferredoxins are available upon request. The three-dimensional structures of all bacterial-type ferredoxins so far determined exhibit a remarkable pseudo-2-fold symmetry, indicating that a putative initial gene duplication event might have taken place in the earliest stage of the molecular evolution of a primordial bacterial type ferredoxin (10Iwasaki T. Wakagi T. Isogai Y. Tanaka K. Iizuka T. Oshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29444-29450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Fukuyama K. Matsubara H. Tsukihara T. Katsube Y. J. Mol.

The basic concepts of this have been generally accepted, and the extreme cases may be emphasized for the unusual polyferredoxins typically found in certain methanogenic archaea (40Steigerwald V.J. Pihl T.D. Reeve J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6929-6933Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) (not considered in the phylogenetic tree shown in Fig. 5). The pseudo-2-fold symmetry of the three-dimensional structures of both the archaeal and bacterial ferredoxins suggests that a putative initial gene duplication event might have occurred long before the divergence of the Archaea and the Bacteria domains (1Woese C.R. Kandler O. Wheelis M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4576-4579Crossref PubMed Scopus (4535) Google Scholar, 2Olsen G.J. Woese C.R. Overbeek R. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). The archaeal ferredoxin tree shown in Fig. 5 clearly suggests their monophyletic origin, and, in a supposed first evolutionary event, divergence of the monocluster and dicluster ferredoxins occurred prior to the divergence of the archaeal genera. Intriguingly, the ferredoxins containing a long N-terminal extension region and a zinc center phylogenetically form a separate group, and they are supposed to be evolved from a common ancestor. Thus, the phylogenetic analysis clearly suggests that they can be classified as a novel, separate group, namely, the “zinc-containing ferredoxin” family. This is supported from our findings that the overall topologies of the calculated trees are essentially identical whether or not information of the long N-terminal extension and the central additional loop regions of the zinc-containing ferredoxins is taken into account for the analysis (data not shown). Another interesting feature of the archaeal ferredoxin tree (Fig. 5) is that it unexpectedly well reflects the differences in the growth conditions of the archaeal species, rather than their phylogenetic relationships based on the universal phylogenetic tree calculated on the basis of the 16 S rRNA base sequences (2Olsen G.J. Woese C.R. Overbeek R. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Thus, ferredoxins from hyperthermophiles, methanogens, and thermoacidophiles are clustered together in separate groups as the monocluster type, the dicluster type, and the novel zinc-containing dicluster type, respectively. Moreover, the zinc-containing ferredoxins have been found only in the “fast clock” archaea (such as Sulfolobales and Thermoplasma) (3Stetter K.O. ASM News. 1995; 61: 285-290Google Scholar), while ferredoxins from the “slow clock” hyperthermophilic archaea and bacteria (3Stetter K.O. ASM News. 1995; 61: 285-290Google Scholar) are primarily the monocluster ferredoxins. Given the physiological importance of ferredoxins in the archaeal central metabolisms (5Adams M.W.W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 15: 261-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 8Kerscher L. Oesterhelt D. Trends Biochem.

Biochem. 1982; 128: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), these observations seem to be somewhat meaningful (e.g see Darimont and Sterner (39Darimont B. Sterner R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1772-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar)), although further discussion should await comparison at the base sequence level in order to preclude a possibility of lateral gene transfer event. 6For instance, a putative lateral gene transfer event from halophilic cyanobacterial origin has been well documented for the case of Halobacterium salinarium [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin (43Pfeifer F. Griffig J. Oesterhelt D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 239: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). One possibility is that the molecular evolution of the archaeal ferredoxins might have largely been affected by environmental pressure which should have made considerable influences on the central and energy metabolisms as well as the growth of the cells. The closer relationship between the zinc-containing ferredoxins of thermoacidophilic archaea and the dicluster ferredoxins of methanogens in the archaeal ferredoxin tree also raises an interesting question of whether methanogens contain a putative zinc-binding polypeptide of ∼50-100 amino acids long, which could potentially interact with the cognate ferredoxin. However, preliminary search against the complete genome sequence of the methanogenic archaeon Methanococcus jannaschii (41Bult C.J. White O. Olsen G.J. Zhou L. Fleischmann R.D. Sutton G.G. Blake J.A. FitzGerald L.M. Clayton R.A. Gocayne J.D. Kerlavage A.R. Dougherty B.A. Tomb J.-F. Adams M.D. Reich C.I. Overbeek R. Kirkness E.F. Weinstock K.G. Merrick J.M. Glodek A. Scott J.L. Geoghagen N.S.M.

Woese C.R. Venter J.C. Science. 1996; 273: 1058-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2290) Google Scholar) failed to identify the presence of such a sequence.3 A specific role of the novel zinc center of the zinc-containing ferredoxin family is currently unclear, besides its obvious structural contribution. It is very unlikely that ferredoxin itself serves as a zinc sensor or a zinc storage protein in vivo, because the bound zinc center is not released upon dialysis against buffer containing 5 mM EDTA. Nevertheless, formation of a mature ferredoxin molecule should be correlated to intracellular levels of both Zn2+ and Fe2+ ions at least at the translation level, thus raising an interesting possibility that the ferredoxin-dependent central metabolism of the fast clock archaea (17Kerscher L. Oesterhelt D. FEBS Lett. 1977; 83: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 18Kerscher L. Nowitzki S. Oesterhelt D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 128: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) could be potentially regulated by the availability of zinc. In this connection, a zinc-containing ferredoxin identified in this study may be useful as a simple model for more complex, mixed-metal metalloenzymes, to investigate how different kinds of metal ions are inserted into distinct metal binding sites of the same apoprotein to give mature protein conformation. Moreover, since the redox partners of the zinc-containing ferredoxins are known (10Iwasaki T. Wakagi T. Isogai Y. Tanaka K. Iizuka T. Oshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29444-29450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Kerscher L. Nowitzki S. Oesterhelt D. Eur. J.

Biochem. 1995; 233: 937-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), it will be tempting to construct mutant proteins with modified N-terminal extension region by protein engineering and to determine the effects on the protein stability and redox activity. Since the first discovery of a bacterial type ferredoxin by Mortenson et al. in 1962 (42Mortenson L.E. Valentine R.C. Carnahan J.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1962; 7: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), we have recognized for the first time the existence of a novel ferredoxin family inherently containing a zinc center besides conventional FeS clusters, in several thermoacidophilic archaea. These ferredoxins, namely, zinc-containing ferredoxins, can be characterized by a long N-terminal extension region with a consensus of three histidine residues, which probably function as parts of ligands to a zinc center. Chemical and spectroscopic analyses of one such example from T. acidophilum have shown that the purified ferredoxin contains one zinc center, one [3Fe-4S] cluster, and one [4Fe-4S] cluster, as in the case of Sulfolobus sp. ferredoxin. 7T. Iwasaki, T. Imai, A. Urushiyama, D. Ohmori, and T. Oshima, manuscript in preparation. The presence of a unique zinc center in these ferredoxins might represent a unique evolutionary event in early thermoacidophilic archaea."

In an attempt to isolate and characterize the PGs that might be encountered by migrating neural crest cells in the axolotl embryo, a previous study (32Stigson M. Kjellén L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 290: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) took advantage of the possibility to utilize epidermal explants for the metabolic radiolabeling of PGs with [35S]sulfate. Dorsal trunk epidermis was explanted at a premigratory stage and was maintained in tissue culture together with radiolabel for a time period corresponding to the transition from a nonpermissive matrix to one that permits subepidermal migration of neural crest cells. It was found that the major PGs synthesized were large disulfide-stabilized PG complexes with monomer PGs in the size range of aggrecan or PG-M/versican but with unusually large (Mr≈150,000) chondroitin/dermatan sulfate (CS/DS) side chains. In the present work these complexes are further studied, and their PG component is purified, characterized, and identified. We report that the complexes contain PG-M/versican-like PG monomers in addition to some other component of low buoyant density. Furthermore, the PG-M/versican-like monomers of the complex are shown to be distinctly different from another CSPG that is present in small amounts in the epidermal extracts. Embryos of the Mexican axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum, Urodela, Amphibia) were obtained from the Indiana University Axolotl Colony, Bloomington, IN, and from the Department of Zoology, Uppsala University. Before manual decapsulation, eggs were sterilized in 70% ethanol and rinsed in modified Steinberg's solution (MS), composed of 58 mM NaCl, 0.67 mM KCl, 0.34 mM CaCl2, 0.83 mM MgSO4, 4.6 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 (33Zackson S.L. Steinberg M.S. Dev. Biol. 1986; 117: 342-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), supplemented with 0.05% penicillin/streptomycin. All storage, handling, and manipulations of embryos were done in sterile MS. Embryos were staged according to Bordzilovskaya et al. (34Bordzilovskaya N.P. Detlaff T.A. Duhon S.T. Malacinski G.M. Armstrong J.B. Malacinski G.M. Developmental Biology of the Axolotl. Oxford University Press, New York1989: 201-219Google Scholar). Using sharp tungsten needles, the epidermis was carefully removed from the dorsal trunk (the area between the levels of the gills and anus overlying the somites and neural tube/crest) of stage 30 embryos (around the onset of neural crest cell migration). The epidermal explants were incubated in MS containing 2.5 mCi/ml Na[35S]SO4 (carrier-free; DuPont NEN). After incubation for 20 h at 20°C, corresponding to the time between stages 30 to 35 (as determined by the parallel incubation of control embryos), the labeling medium was removed and the tissue was dissolved in extraction buffer (about 400 μl per 50 explants) containing 4 M guanidine HCl, 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.8, and 0.2% Triton X-100, together with 1 mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), 100 mMε-aminocaproic acid, 10 mM EDTA, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride as protease inhibitors (35HeinegÅrd D. Sommarin Y. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 144: 319-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). After end-over-end extraction for 24 h at 4°C, the radiolabeled macromolecules (≈5 × 106 cpm/100 epidermal explants) were recovered by extensive dialysis against extraction buffer. For immunoblotting, 400 epidermal explants were prepared as above but without radiolabeling. An aliquot of the 35S-labeled material was added to the unlabeled material to act as tracer during the purification steps. Extracted 35S-labeled PGs were separated by chromatography on 1.2 × 100-cm columns of Sepharose CL-2B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) eluted with extraction buffer at 4°C. An aliquot of each fraction was subjected to liquid scintillation analysis. The recovery of 35S radioactivity was about 65%. Size-fractionated PGs were pooled as indicated in Fig. 1A, and 0.48 g/ml CsCl was added to give an initial density of 1.42 g/ml before the samples were separated according to buoyant density in self-generated CsCl gradient by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 72 h. The specific gravity (ρ) of fractions collected from the bottom was determined by weighing, and the 35S radioactivity of each fraction was determined by liquid scintillation analysis of an aliquot. Recovery of 35S radioactivity was ≈70%. IMPGs, pooled as indicated in Fig. 1C, were diluted 40 times with a buffer containing 7 M urea, 10 mM Tris, pH 8, 0.1% Triton X-100, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mM NEM, 2 mM EDTA, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin), and applied to a DEAE-Sephacel (Pharmacia) ion exchange column, equilibrated with a buffer containing the same ingredients together with 150 mM NaCl. After washing with equilibration buffer and a buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Ac−, pH 4, 0.1% Triton X-100, and the mixture of protease inhibitors, the PGs were eluted with extraction buffer. For reduction of the HMPG complexes, samples were dialyzed into a buffer of 6 M guanidine HCl, 100 mM Tris, pH 8, 0.1% Triton X-100, and the mixture of protease inhibitors excluding NEM. Dithiothreitol was added to a final concentration of 50 mM, and the sample was incubated for 16 h at room temperature, after which reduced SH groups were alkylated by addition of iodoacetamide to a final concentration of 62.5 mM and incubated for another 1 h. Alkaline liberation of glycosaminoglycan side chains was achieved by adding 1 volume of 0.1 M NaOH, 0.6 M NaBH4 followed by incubation at room temperature for 24 h, after which the samples were acidified, neutralized, and dialyzed against water. The chain length of the glycosaminoglycans was assessed by chromatography on a calibrated Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia) column as described previously (32Stigson M. Kjellén L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 290: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Blue dextran (Pharmacia) and N-2,4-dinitrophenyl-β-alanine was used as void volume and total volume markers, respectively. 3H-Labeled hyaluronan fragments of Mr = 40,000, kindly provided by Dr. HÅkan Pertoft, Department of Medical Chemistry, Uppsala University, were used as an internal standard. To obtain large size hyaluronan, Healon™ (Pharmacia, Sweden) was chromatographed on Sepharose CL-2B and analyzed by the carbazole method (36Bitter T. Muir H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5205) Google Scholar), after which the void volume fraction was pooled and used for the aggregation experiment. Aggrecan from bovine nasal cartilage was kindly prepared by Dr. Erik Unger and quantitated by the carbazole method (36Bitter T. Muir H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5205) Google Scholar). 35S-Labeled HMPG complexes or IMPGs were mixed with 10 μg of hyaluronan and 1 mg of aggrecan in dissociative buffer. After dialysis into an associative buffer containing 0.5 M sodium acetate, pH 5.8, 0.1% Triton X-100, and the protease inhibitor mixture, samples were analyzed by CsCl gradient centrifugation or chromatography on 0.8 × 100-cm columns of Sepharose CL-2B in associative buffer. Samples without addition of carrier aggrecan-hyaluronan complexes were used as negative controls. As a positive control, 3H-labeled hyaluronan was centrifuged in associative CsCl gradients with and without added aggrecan. The 3H radioactivity was recovered at ρ >1.65 g/ml and ρ =1.57 g/ml, respectively (data not shown). Acid treatment was done by titrating the sample with acetic acid to pH 3.8, after which the samples were incubated for 1.5 h at +4°C. For digestion with collagenase (form III; Advanced Biofactures, Lynnbrook, NY), samples were dialyzed into a digestion buffer of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.36 mM CaCl2, and the mixture of protease inhibitors excluding EDTA. To test the effectiveness and specificity of the collagenase treatment, collagen and fibronectin (kindly provided by Dr. Staffan Johansson, Department of Medical Chemistry, Uppsala University) were treated in parallel under identical conditions as positive and negative controls, respectively, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Under these conditions, collagen was completely degraded while fibronectin was left intact (result not shown). Hyaluronidase (Seikagaku Co., Japan) treatment (5 turbidity reducing units/ml) was done in a buffer with 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.8, 0.1% Triton X-100, with protease inhibitors at 37°C for 3 h. As a positive control of enzyme activity, 3H-labeled hyaluronan was treated in parallel under identical conditions and analyzed by chromatography on a Superose 6 HPLC column. Before digestion with chondroitinase ABC (protease-free; Seikagaku Co., Japan), the purified PG samples were dialyzed into the appropriate buffer. Digestion with chondroitinase ABC (0.1 units/ml) was done at 37°C for 3 h in 50 mM Tris, pH 8, 30 mM NaAc, 0.1% Triton X-100, with the mixture of protease inhibitors. As a positive control of enzyme activity, aggrecan was digested under identical conditions and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. For slot blotting, the chondroitinase ABC-treated samples were diluted to <0.05% Triton X-100 in 4 M guanidine-HCl/TBS (10 mM Tris, pH 8, and 150 mM NaCl), serially diluted, and immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) using a Bio-Dot SF Microfiltration Apparatus (Bio-Rad). For Western blotting, samples were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, rinsed in ethanol:diethyl ether (1:1), briefly dried, and dissolved in sample buffer. Reduced and alkylated samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE in 7.5% homogeneous PhastGels for 130 V-h followed by semi-dry electrotransfer for 30 min onto nitrocellulose using a Pharmacia PhastSystem. Prestained SDS-PAGE Standards (high range; Bio-Rad) and laminin (detected by Coomassie staining of parallel gels) were used as molecular weight markers. Blots were blocked with 5% non-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween (TBS-T), washed, incubated with primary antibodies (see below) in TBS-T for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at +4°C, washed, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse Ig or anti-rabbit Ig (Amersham Corp.; secondary antibodies diluted 1:5000) for 30 min at room temperature, washed, reacted with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and detected by exposure to Fuji RX x-ray film. Mouse monoclonal antibodies 5D4 (ascites fluid; Seikagaku) against keratan sulfate were used diluted 1:200 in TBS-T. Mouse monoclonal antibodies 1B5, 2B6, and 3B3 (ascites fluid; ICN) against the unsulfated, 4-sulfated, and 6-sulfated, respectively, unsaturated “stubs” generated by chondroitinase ABC digestion of chondroitin sulfate (37Couchman J.R. Caterson B. Christner J.E. Baker J.E. Nature. 1984; 307: 650-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) were used as a mixture at a dilution of 1:200 in TBS-T with respect to each antibody. A portion of the CS attachment domain of a partially cloned axolotl PG-M/versican homologue 2Currently, an axolotl PG (AxPG) with homology to PG-M/versican is being cloned (M. Stigson and L. Kjellén, work in progress). Briefly, a cDNA probe corresponding to a portion of the conserved C-terminal domain of chicken PG-M (22Shinomura T. Nishida Y. Ito K. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14461-14469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) prepared from a partial cDNA clone generously provided by Drs. K. Kimata and T. Shinomura was used for the screening of an oligo(dT)-primed embryonic axolotl cDNA library. A 4.67-kilobase pair AxPG partial cDNA clone (the full transcript was estimated by Northern analysis to be around 12-13 kilobase pairs) was sequenced and found to consist of 3422 of coding and 1245 base pairs of 3′-untranslated sequence. The deduced amino acid sequence comprises the C-terminal 1140 amino acid residues of the core protein including 830 amino acid residues of the CS attachment domain and the complete conserved C-terminal end with two epidermal growth factor-like domains, a lectin-like domain, and a complement regulatory protein-like domain. The C-terminal domain of AxPG shows an extensive amino acid sequence identity to that of the published chicken (22Shinomura T. Nishida Y. Ito K. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14461-14469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mouse (24Ito K. Shinomura T. Zako M. Ujita M. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 958-965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and human (51Zimmermann D.R. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2975-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) PG-M/versican, i.e. 83% identity to the avian and 78% to the mammalian species, whereas the similarity to other large PGs is significantly lower, e.g. 58% identity to chicken aggrecan (52Li H. Schwartz N.B. Vertel B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23504-23511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 56% to rat neurocan (53Rauch U. Karthikeyan L. Maurel P. Margolis R.U. Margolis R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19536-19547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the CS attachment region apparently shows limited sequence conservation between the species and was chosen for expression as a fusion protein and generation of AxPG-specific antibodies (cf 54). was selected for expression as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase; the stretch of 80 amino acid residues (SAAEHAEGESDVTETKSPMTPLTAVETDEERQDVSTAYAELVSHSIRQSVTEIQDISQATYIESETAAKITPEDQTQKPS) lacks any apparent consensus signal for glycanation or N- and O-linked glycosylation and shares no apparent homology with other sequences obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (World Wide Web at URL http://www3.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The corresponding 240-base pair nucleotide sequence, to be cloned in the correct reading frame into the BamHI/EcoRI site of the pGEX-3 (Pharmacia) expression vector, was amplified from a partial cDNA clone2 of the axolotl PG (AxPG) by polymerase chain reaction. After ligation of the polymerase chain reaction product into pGEX-3 and transfection of Escherichia coli JM83, a recombinant clone with the correct insert was selected after sequencing. The recombinant plasmid was cultured in E. coli UT5600, and after induction with isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside, the bacteria were further cultured and lysed, after which the axolotl PG-glutathione S-transferase (AxPG-GST) fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography on a glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia) column. Rabbits were immunized intramuscularly with the purified AxPG fusion protein using standard procedures, and the production of antibodies was monitored by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Anti-AxPG-GST antibodies (0.3 mg/ml) were obtained by affinity chromatography on AxPG-GST-coupled Sepharose 4B. The antibodies were used in immunoblotting (30 μg/ml in TBS-T) and immunofluorescence (as described below). As a control, similarly prepared affinity-purified antibodies against GST were used under the same conditions as the anti-AxPG-GST antibodies. Axolotl embryos of stage 32 or epidermal explants of stage 30 embryos after 20 h incubation were fixed overnight (embryos) or 15 min (epidermal explants) in 3% paraformaldehyde, 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. For whole embryos, fixative penetrance was facilitated by cutting off the head and tail. The fixed embryos and epidermal explants were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), dehydrated, embedded in Paraplast, and sectioned transversely. Sections were dewaxed, rehydrated, washed in PBS, and subjected to chondroitinase ABC digestion (1 unit/ml) in 50 mM Tris, pH 8, 30 mM NaAc for 30 min at 37°C. The incubation with primary antibodies (10 μg/ml in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin) was performed overnight at 4°C. After washing in PBS, the sections were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (diluted 1:200 in PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin; Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature, after which the immunofluorescence was visualized in a fluorescence microscope. As control, anti-AxPG antibody binding was competitively blocked by the addition of a 5-fold molar excess of AxPG fusion protein to the primary antibody. Anti-GST antibodies were used as negative control. To further characterize the large PG complexes previously shown to be synthesized by the epidermis of the axolotl embryo (32Stigson M. Kjellén L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 290: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), explants of dorsal trunk epidermis from axolotl embryos were maintained in tissue culture for a time period corresponding to stages 30 to 35 in the presence of [35S]sulfate. After dissociative extraction and dialysis to recover macromolecular radiolabel, the 35S-labeled PGs were separated by size exclusion chromatography on Sepharose CL-2B under dissociative conditions (Fig. 1A). The high molecular weight PGs (HMPGs) eluting in the void volume fractions and PGs of intermediate molecular weight (IMPGs) eluting with Kav 0.2-0.3 were separately pooled and subjected to density equilibrium centrifugation in self-forming gradients of CsCl under dissociative conditions (ρo≈1.42 g/ml). The HMPGs were mostly found in mid-gradient fractions with ρ≈1.42 g/ml (Fig. 1B) which were pooled as indicated in the figure and used for further characterization. In contrast, the majority of IMPGs were recovered in fractions of significantly higher density (ρ≈1.55 g/ml; Fig. 1C). Evidently, the rather prominent second peak that appears at ρ≈1.42 g/ml in Fig. 1C represents contaminating HMPG which by its relative abundance is present in the IMPG pool after separation by Sepharose CL-2B chromatography. The IMPGs, pooled as indicated in the figure, were further purified from contaminating HMPG by ion exchange chromatography 3Introducing ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel as a first step before Sepharose CL-2B chromatography or CsCl gradient centrifugation was found to result in a significantly reduced recovery of HMPGs compared with IMPGs (M. Stigson, unpublished data). For unknown reasons, HMPGs appear to bind irreversibly to the ion exchange resin and are only partly eluted by increasing the salt concentration. This property of the HMPG was taken advantage of for purification of IMPGs, which were enriched after ion exchange chromatography of HMPG-contaminated IMPG preparations. before subsequent characterization. The HMPG fraction has previously been shown to contain PG complexes stabilized by intermolecular disulfide bonds (32Stigson M. Kjellén L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 290: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). After reduction, the monomers were found to elute at a Kav of 0.2 when analyzed by Sepharose CL-2B chromatography (32Stigson M. Kjellén L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 290: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To investigate if the HMPG monomers resemble the IMPGs, the HMPG fraction obtained after chromatography on Sepharose CL-2B was subjected to CsCl gradient centrifugation before and after reduction and alkylation (Fig. 2). The reduced PGs were found at a higher buoyant density (1.48 g/ml; Fig. 2B) than the unreduced HMPGs (1.42 g/ml; Fig. 2A), indicating that the complex in addition to the HMPG monomers contain other components with lower buoyant density. Since the significantly higher buoyant density of the IMPGs (1.55 g/ml; Fig. 1C) indicated that the HMPG monomers and the IMPGs are not identical, it was decided to further compare the two PG preparations. After alkaline liberation from the core protein, the glycosaminoglycan side chains of HMPG eluted significantly earlier"
https://openalex.org/W2089183713,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a highly dynamic organelle, continuously undergoing membrane fusion and fission. We have measured homotypic fusion between ER vesicles isolated from Chinese hamster ovary cells kinetically in vitro, using an assay based on the metabolic incorporation of pyrene-labeled fatty acids into the phospholipids of cellular membranes. An increase in pyrene-monomer fluorescence was observed after mixing labeled and unlabeled ER vesicles in the presence of ATP and GTP. The protein, temperature, and nucleotide dependence of the increase indicated that it was caused by membrane fusion rather than molecular transfer of labeled lipids to unlabeled membranes. This assay allowed the first kinetic measurements with virtually nonexchangeable probes of a homotypic membrane fusion event. At 37°C, fusion started off immediately at a rate of 1.14 ± 0.29%/min and reached a half-maximal level after 56 min. In the presence of guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPγS), or after treatment of the membranes with N-ethylmaleimide, fusion was reduced but not completely inhibited. Addition of GTP during a fusion reaction immediately accelerated, and GTPγS immediately slowed down the fusion reaction. Thus, these kinetic measurements indicate that G-proteins might act to rapidly enhance fusion beyond a basic level.

Thus, these kinetic measurements indicate that G-proteins might act to rapidly enhance fusion beyond a basic level. The molecular mechanism of membrane fusion is best known for fusion induced by the hemagglutinin protein of influenza virus. This is an exoplasmic fusion event, in which the initial contact takes place between membrane leaflets that face the extracellular environment of cells (1Silverstein, S. C., (ed) (1978) Transport of Macromolecules in Cellular Systems, Abakon Verlagsgesellschaft, Berlin.Google Scholar, 2Stegmann T. Doms R.W. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1989; 18: 187-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Endoplasmic fusion, with initial contact between cytoplasmic leaflets, differs from exoplasmic fusion, because it occurs in a controlled environment which contains factors that could be used to drive a fusion reaction (2Stegmann T. Doms R.W. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1989; 18: 187-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Thus, whereas exoplasmic fusion is mostly induced by a single integral membrane protein present on one of the membranes, like hemagglutinin, endoplasmic fusion was found to involve complexes of soluble, peripheral, and integral membrane proteins and requires factors such as ATP and GTP (3Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar, 4Pfeffer S.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In recent years, many proteins involved in endoplasmic fusion have been identified. With few exceptions (5Ikonen E. Tagaya M. Ullrich O. Montecucco C. Simons K. Cell. 1995; 81: 571-580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), heterotypic fusion, between vesicles derived from one organelle fusing with the next organelle on the endocytic or exocytic pathway, appears to involve proteins such as N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) 1The abbreviations used are: NEMN-ethylmaleimideNSFNEM-sensitive fusion proteinC12E8octaethylene glycol mono n-dodecyl etherCLAPchymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin AFBfusion bufferGTPγSguanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)SBsucrose bufferSNAPsoluble NSF attachment proteinSNARESNAP receptorDTTdithiothreitolCHOChinese hamster ovaryERendoplasmic reticulum.-sensitive fusion protein (NSF), soluble NSF attachment proteins (SNAPs), and SNAP receptors or SNAREs (3Rothman J.E.

Studies of the mechanism of hemagglutinin-induced fusion have been greatly facilitated by the development of quantitative and kinetic, fluorescence-based assays for fusion. The assays are mostly based on fluorescent phospholipid analogues present in artificial membranes. Fusion of these membranes with unlabeled viral membranes leads to a dilution of the probes in the membrane, resulting in a relief of fluorescence quenching or of self-quenching, and the resulting change in fluorescence can be directly correlated with fusion. Phospholipid analogues are reliable probes for the measurement of fusion, because the molecular exchange of phospholipids between labeled and unlabeled membranes, which would lead to a false-positive fusion signal, is unlikely (9Struck D.K. Hoekstra D. Pagano R.E. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar, 10Silvius J.R. Leventis R. Brown P.M. Zuckermann M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4279-4287Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, phospholipids are not easily taken up by biological membranes, limiting their use in the measurement of fusion between biological membranes. Here, we have studied homotypic fusion between vesicles produced from the ER. The ER is a highly dynamic organelle. Elongation, branching and fusion of ER tubules takes place continuously in vivo (11Lee C. Chen L.B. Cell. 1988; 54: 37-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 12Lee C. Ferguson M. Chen L.B. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2045-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and this process has been reconstituted in vitro (13Dabora S.L. Sheetz M.P. Cell. 1988; 54: 27-35Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Moreover, during mitosis, the ER fragments, and these fragments rapidly fuse to re-form a functional organelle in the daughter cells (14Warren G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 323–348Google Scholar, 15Warren G. Wickner W. Cell. 1996; 84: 395-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). We have isolated ER vesicles from CHO cells labeled with pyrene phospholipids through the metabolic incorporation of pyrene fatty acids. Fusion of these vesicles with unlabeled ER vesicles was measured by an assay based on the concentration-dependent formation of pyrene excimers. The assay, which was used previously to measure virus-induced membrane fusion (16Pal R. Barenholz Y. Wagner R.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 17Stegmann T. Schoen P. Bron R. Wey J. Bartoldus I. Ortiz A. Nieva J.L. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11330-11337Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), allowed fusion to be followed in real time. It was found that fusion was affected by a number of factors known to play a role in microsome fusion, such as GTP (18Paiement J. Beaufay H. Godelaine D. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 19Comerford J.G. Dawson A.P. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 20Watkins J.D.

Chem. 1993; 268: 5182-5192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and also by NEM. Addition of GTP or guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPγS) during the reaction had an immediate effect on the rate of fusion, indicating that a GTPase might act as a fusion switch. 1-Pyrene hexadecanoic acid was obtained from Molecular Probes (Junction City, OR) and octaethylene glycol mono n-dodecyl ether (C12E8) from Nikko Chemicals (Tokyo, Japan). ATP, GTP, GTPγS, creatine kinase, and creatine phosphate were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim (Rotkreuz, Switzerland). Xenopus p97 was kindly provided by Dr. J.-M. Peters. CHO K1 cells were grown in minimal essential medium-α (Life Technologies, Inc., Basel, Switzerland) supplemented with 7.5% fetal calf serum, 2 mML-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37°C and 5% CO2. Suspension-grown CHO K1 cells in log phase were harvested by centrifugation in the presence of 1 mM EDTA and washed with sucrose buffer (SB: 10 mM Hepes/KOH, 250 mM sucrose, pH 7.4). Cells were resuspended in a 4-fold volume of sucrose buffer containing 1 μg/ml each of chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin A (SB/CLAP) and homogenized by 11 passes through a “cell cracker” (21Balch W.E. Rothman J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 240: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) with a clearance of 18 μm. The homogenate was spun at 715 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was saved, and the pellet was washed once with SB/CLAP. The pooled supernatants were loaded on a two-step gradient (0.25 ml of 2 M sucrose and 2 ml of 0.63 M sucrose, both in 10 mM Hepes/KOH, pH 7.4) and centrifuged for 1 h at 225,000 × gav. Fractions were collected as follows: 0.5 ml from the top (fraction 1), the next 1.5 ml containing the uppermost interface (fraction 2), the following 1.7 ml until the second interface (fraction 3), and the material banding on the 2 M sucrose cushion (fraction 4). The protein concentration in the fractions was determined according to Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216391) Google Scholar). The activity of organelle-specific marker enzymes was measured to analyze the purification of the ER vesicles by this method. Alkaline phosphatase, a marker for plasma membranes, was assayed by measuring the dephosphorylation of 4-nitrophenyl phosphate according to Van Belle (23van Belle H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 289: 158-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), with minor changes. Briefly, samples were incubated for 60 min at 37°C in 50 mM N-ethylaminoethanol, 0.5 mM 4-nitrophenyl phosphate, and 0.3 mM MgCl2, pH 9.3, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of NaOH to 250 mM. The amount of Golgi membranes in the fraction was determined by measuring α-mannosidase II activity, using 4-methylumbelliferyl-α-D-mannopyranoside (Fluka Chemie AG, Buchs, Switzerland) as a substrate (24Storrie B. Madden E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 203-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). NADH-dehydrogenase, a marker for the ER, was measured as described by Wallach and Kamat (25Wallach D.F.H. Kamat V.B. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 164-172Crossref Scopus (202) Google Scholar). With these assays, fraction 4 was found to contain 79% of the ER marker activity recovered, was enriched 3-fold in ER marker with respect to total protein, and contained 6% of the Golgi and 13% of the plasma membrane marker (Fig. 1). Therefore, this fraction was used as a preparation of ER membranes. The isolation procedure was carried out at 4°C. ER vesicles were kept on ice and used for measurements within 12 h after isolation. Confluent monolayers of cells were trypsinized and plated at a dilution of 1:7 in medium containing 10 μg/ml 1-pyrenehexadecanoic acid. The cells were grown for 38 h, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and chased for 1 h in fresh medium without label. After trypsinization, cells (∼ 5 × 107) were taken up in phosphate-buffered saline, washed in SB, resuspended in 1 ml of SB/CLAP, and homogenized by 21 passes through the cell cracker. ER vesicles were isolated from the cracked material as described above. Lipids were extracted from the vesicles according to Folch (26Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and analyzed by TLC, using chloroform:methanol:water, 65:25:4 (v/v/v), as an eluant. To determine the intensity of fluorescent spots on the TLC plate, they were scraped off from the plate and extracted twice with chloroform. The pooled extracts were dried under a stream of nitrogen, dissolved in buffer containing the detergent C12E8 (12.2 mM), and the fluorescence intensity at 377 nm, with excitation at 330 nm, was measured to quantify the amount of fluorescent lipid. The monomer fluorescence of pyrene was measured at 377 nm, with excitation at 330 nm, on an SLM 8000 fluorimeter (SLM-Aminco, Urbana, IL) with thermostatted cuvette housing, in a continuously stirred volume of 1.4 ml of fusion buffer (FB: 10 mM Hepes/KOH, 145 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4) and additions as indicated in the text and figure legends. The fluorescence scale was calibrated by setting the fluorescence immediately after injection of labeled vesicles to 0%, and the fluorescence at infinite probe dilution, determined after the addition of 35 μl of a 0.5 M solution of C12E8 and correction for dilution, to 100% (17Stegmann T. Schoen P. Bron R. Wey J. Bartoldus I. Ortiz A. Nieva J.L. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11330-11337Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Initial rates of fusion were calculated from the slope of the steepest part of the fusion curves. Cytosolic proteins were isolated from CHO K1 cells grown in suspension. Cells were collected, washed with a buffer containing 25 mM Hepes, 125 mM KCl, pH 7.4, and resuspended with an equal volume of the same buffer, that for some isolations additionally contained 2 mM ATP and 2 mM DTT. The cells were homogenized by 21 passes through the cell cracker, and the postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged for 10 min at 513,000 × gav in a TL-120 rotor as described by Watkins et al. (20Watkins J.D. Hermanowski A.L. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5182-5192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lipid layer on the surface was discarded and the supernatant filtered through a 0.2-μm filter. The protein concentration was determined according to Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216391) Google Scholar), and aliquots containing 175 μg of protein were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70°C. For the preparation of liposomes, lipids from stock solutions of Folch-extracted ER vesicle lipids in chloroform/methanol, 2:1 (v/v), were dried exhaustively in vacuo, suspended in 2.5 mM Hepes, 145 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, and subjected to 5 freeze-thaw cycles. The resulting multilamellar vesicles were then extruded three times through a defined-pore filter (Nucleopore, Pleasanton, CA) with 400- and 100-nm diameter pores, respectively, producing large unilamellar vesicles (27Mayer L.D. Hope M.J. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 858: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar). Residual multilamellar vesicles were pelleted by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant containing the large unilamellar vesicles was stored at 4°C under argon. Phospholipid phosphate was determined according to Böttcher (28Böttcher C.J.F. Van Gent C.M. Fries C. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1961; 24: 203-204Crossref Scopus (851) Google Scholar). To measure membrane fusion kinetically in vitro, we adapted an assay based on the fluorescence of pyrene-labeled phospholipids (16Pal R. Barenholz Y. Wagner R.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 17Stegmann T. Schoen P. Bron R. Wey J. Bartoldus I. Ortiz A. Nieva J.L. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11330-11337Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Pyrene-labeled phospholipids can be used to measure fusion because excited pyrene molecules can form excimers (dimers) with pyrene molecules in the ground state in a concentration-dependent fashion. Excimers emit fluorescence at a higher wavelength than monomers, and therefore the ratio of excimer to monomer fluorescence is a measure of the probes' concentration. Dilution of pyrene-labeled phospholipids upon fusion of labeled with unlabeled membranes causes an increase in monomer fluorescence and a decrease in excimer fluorescence (16Pal R. Barenholz Y. Wagner R.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 17Stegmann T. Schoen P. Bron R. Wey J. Bartoldus I. Ortiz A. Nieva J.L. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11330-11337Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). CHO K1 cells were grown in the presence of the pyrene-labeled fatty acid 1-pyrenehexadecanoic acid, and after a 1-h chase in fresh medium without label to remove remaining free fatty acids, ER vesicles were isolated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The purity of the vesicles was assessed by the analysis of marker enzymes (Fig. 1). TLC analysis of lipids extracted from the vesicles showed that pyrene was incorporated efficiently into the phospholipids, similar to what was reported for enveloped viruses (16Pal R. Barenholz Y. Wagner R.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). 44.7 ± 4.0% of the pyrene was found in phosphatidylcholine and 34.0 ± 12.4% in phosphatidylethanolamine, whereas 11.9 ± 3.7% was still in fatty acids (averages of five labelings). A fluorescence emission spectrum of the vesicles, with excitation at 330 nm, showed two monomer peaks, at 377 and 397 nm, and a broad excimer peak around 475 nm (Fig. 2, spectrum a). The excimer to monomer ratio (measured at 475 and 377 nm, respectively) was always between 0.20 and 0.30, meaning that pyrene was present in the membranes at concentrations sufficient for fusion measurements. After incubation of labeled with unlabeled vesicles (1:10 ratio) in the presence of GTP, ATP, an ATP-regenerating system, and cytosol at 37°C for 30 min, a different spectrum was recorded (Fig. 2, spectrum b). The excimer peak had decreased by 23%, whereas the intensity of the monomer peak at 377 nm was 23% higher. These changes could be the result of dilution of the pyrene-labeled lipids into the unlabeled membranes after fusion between labeled and unlabeled vesicles. Addition of detergent lysed the membranes, dispersing individual probe molecules into separate micelles. As a result, the excimer peak disappeared and the monomer fluorescence increased considerably (Fig. 2, spectrum c). The monomer fluorescence after addition of detergent was used as a measure of the fluorescence at infinite dilution of the probe. To measure the kinetics of the interaction between labeled and unlabeled vesicles, the fluorescence at 377 nm was monitored continuously, with excitation at 330 nm. Upon the addition of a mixture of labeled and unlabeled ER vesicles (1:10 ratio) to a cuvette containing GTP, ATP, an ATP-regenerating system, and cytosol, at pH 7.4, 37°C, an increase in fluorescence was observed (Fig. 3, curve a). The initial rate of fluorescence increase, determined as described under “Experimental Procedures,” was 1.14 ± 0.29%/min (average of 23 preparations). The final level of fluorescence increase, measured after 11 h, was 40.7% and a half-maximal increase was obtained after 56 min. Cytosol could be omitted from the mixture without having an effect on the rate or efficiency of the reaction (not shown). In the absence of added GTP, ATP, ATP-regenerating system, and cytosol, an increase in fluorescence was observed with an initial rate of 0.43 ± 0.13% (Fig. 3, curve b), reaching a final level of 22.8%. The addition of cytosol alone did not affect the reaction (not shown). Incubation of labeled vesicles alone in the presence or absence of GTP, ATP, an ATP-regenerating system, and cytosol gave rise to a slight decrease in fluorescence, at least at protein concentrations of labeled vesicles at and above 57 μg/ml (Fig. 3, curve c). Below that concentration, the decrease in fluorescence was more pronounced. It was found that the decrease was not due to photobleaching or oxygen quenching of pyrenes (not shown), but probably involved adsorption of vesicles to the cuvette wall or the Teflon stirrer. Thus, all subsequent experiments were performed at labeled vesicle protein concentrations of 57 μg/ml. With this assay, an increase in fluorescence could be caused by membrane fusion or by the molecular transfer of pyrene-labeled free fatty acids or phospholipids from labeled to unlabeled membranes. Spontaneous exchange of phospholipids between membranes is not very efficient and was not seen using pyrene-labeled phospholipids in two other systems involving biological membranes (16Pal R. Barenholz Y. Wagner R.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 17Stegmann T. Schoen P. Bron R. Wey J. Bartoldus I. Ortiz A. Nieva J.L. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11330-11337Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Since fusion, but not necessarily molecular lipid transfer, most likely depends on specific proteins, the protein dependence and specificity of the reaction were tested. When increasing concentrations of a protease mix containing Pronase and subtilisin were added to the cuvette, the fluorescence increase in the presence of nucleotides and cytosol was reduced by 90-95% at the highest concentration (16.3 μg/ml each) (Fig. 4). To investigate whether the inhibition was caused by the proteolytic action of the proteases or resulted from other interactions (e.g. steric inhibition) between the preparation and the enzymes, the reaction between labeled and unlabeled vesicles was also measured in the presence of both trypsin and trypsin inhibitor. Inhibition was observed when the vesicles were digested with trypsin for 20 min on ice, followed by the addition of trypsin inhibitor (Fig. 4, curve d). However, if the vesicles were preincubated on ice with FB without trypsin, the presence of these reagents in the cuvette did not inhibit the increase in fluorescence (Fig. 4, curve c). If labeled membranes were mixed with liposomes, either prepared from commercially obtained pure lipids (not shown) or from lipids extracted from unlabeled ER vesicles (Fig. 4, curve e), only a slight increase in fluorescence was observed, which could be caused by some unspecific fusion or by lipid exchange. Thus, the increase in fluorescence seen upon mixing labeled and unlabeled ER vesicles is almost entirely protein-dependent, indicating that it is caused by fusion and not by the molecular transfer of lipids between the vesicles. Moreover, if the fluorescence increase would be caused by the transfer of individual probe molecules between the membranes, the initial rate of fluorescence increase should be rate-limited by diffusion and thus vary according to the absolute temperature. The temperature dependence of the initial rate of fluorescence increase, measured as the tangent to the steepest part of the curve as described under “Experimental Procedures,” is shown in Fig. 5. The initial rate of fluorescence increase was optimal at 37°C. At 10°C, the rate was reduced by 75% compared with 37°C, for an absolute temperature difference of 9%. Furthermore, although the initial rate at 10°C was 25% of that measured at 37°C, the fluorescence increase leveled off very fast at low temperatures, and the extent of fluorescence increase after 25 min at 10°C was only 14% of that seen at 37°C (not shown). Moreover, at 0°C no increase in fluorescence was observed. Taken together, the above data indicate that the increase in fluorescence is caused by membrane fusion. In mammalian cells, heterotypic endoplasmic fusion appears to almost universally involve the NEM-sensitive fusion protein NSF (3Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar), and other NEM-sensitive proteins were found to be involved in Golgi-Golgi homotypic fusion (6Acharya U. Jacobs R. Peters J.-M. Watson N. Farquhar M.G. Malhotra V. Cell. 1995; 82: 895-904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 7Rabouille C. Levine T.P. Peters J.-M. Warren G. Cell. 1995; 82: 905-914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the influence of NEM on fusion. Labeled and unlabeled ER vesicles were both treated separately with NEM at 0°C, the NEM activity was quenched with a 2-fold concentration of DTT, and fusion was measured. It was found that treatment with millimolar concentrations of NEM caused an inhibition of fusion. Preincubation of vesicles with 1 mM NEM affected fusion by about 55% (Fig. 6, curve a compared with curve c). After treatment with 2 or 5 mM NEM, fusion was reduced more (Fig. 6, curve b). These data suggest that a membrane-associated protein was inactivated by NEM. NSF could be membrane associated, but there is also a pool of NSF in the cytosol (3Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar). However, inhibition of fusion by NEM could not be overcome by the addition of a 4-fold concentration (500 μg/ml) of cytosol, nor by cytosol that had been isolated in the presence of 1 mM each of ATP and DTT in order to stabilize ATP-binding proteins like NSF (29Block M.R. Glick B.S. Wilcox C.A. Wieland F.T. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7852-7856Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) (not shown). These data suggest that cytosolic factors were not needed for fusion or, after NEM treatment of membranes, could not be supplied by cytosol. In fact, the addition or omission of cytosol did not affect any of the reactions shown in this paper. Recently, p97, an NEM-sensitive homologue of NSF, was reported to mediate homotypic fusion between Golgi membranes from mammalian cells (6Acharya U. Jacobs R. Peters J.-M. Watson N. Farquhar M.G. Malhotra V. Cell. 1995; 82: 895-904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 7Rabouille C. Levine T.P. Peters J.-M. Warren G. Cell. 1995; 82: 905-914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 30Peters J.-M. Walsh M.J. Franke W.W. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1757-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). We found that the addition of 20 μg/ml Xenopus p97 did not overcome the inhibition resulting from the treatment of membranes with NEM (not shown). It was reported that a 1 M KCl extract of Golgi membranes provided NSF and SNAPs for Golgi-Golgi fusion (6Acharya U. Jacobs R. Peters J.-M. Watson N. Farquhar M.G. Malhotra V. Cell. 1995; 82: 895-904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). When labeled and unlabeled vesicles were extracted separately with 1 M KCl and then incubated with nucleotides, cytosol, and an ATP-regenerating system, the initial rate of fusion was reduced to 56.2% compared with unextracted vesicles. In order to verify that the extraction did not just remove soluble proteins, fusion was measured with vesicles extracted with 0.25 M KCl. The initial rate of fusion in this case was reduced to 72,5 ± 3.8% (data from two preparations). Thus, extraction with higher salt concentrations inhibited fusion more strongly, indicating that peripheral membrane proteins were required for fusion. Adding back a 1 M KCl extract (made in the presence of 1 mM ATP to stabilize ATP-binding proteins) to the extracted vesicles partially restored fusion, indicating that a fusion-active compound(s) was contained in the extract. We then tested whether the 1 M KCl extract could provide factors that had been inactivated by NEM. However, addition of the extract to preparations containing NEM-treated vesicles, even in the presence of cytosol (isolated in the presence of ATP), nucleotides and p97 did not restore fusion. Together, these data suggest that additional NEM-sensitive factors, which cannot be extracted from ER membranes by high salt, are required for fusion between ER vesicles. In order to investigate whether fusion required ATP, ATP was omitted from an incubation which contained labeled and unlabeled vesicles, GTP, cytosol, and an ATP-regenerating system. For different preparations, the extent of fusion in the absence of ATP varied, but it was reduced by 10-40% compared with fusion in the presence of ATP (not shown). For a given preparation, the presence or absence of cytosol or a regenerating system di"

The mRNAs are expressed ubiquitously; however, the level of expression is tissue-dependent and is also up- or down-regulated under certain conditions, including growth stimulation, differentiation, and tumor metastasis. To address the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression for the rat NDP kinase major isoform α (an nm23-H2/PuF homologue), we identified the transcription initiation sites in detail by RNase protection and 5′-rapid amplification of DNA ends and located the core promoter region by chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay. The transcripts, initiated from an extraordinarily wide range of sites, were categorized into two groups; one transcribed from an upstream region was spliced in the untranslated region (group 1), whereas the other initiated in the downstream region was not (group 2). RNase protection demonstrated that the group 1 mRNA was the dominant form present in all tissues except heart and skeletal muscle. In situ hybridization revealed cell-specific expression of these mRNA species. Furthermore, they differed in the translational efficiency (the group 2 α > β > the group 1 α). These findings suggest that the regulation of the NDP kinase expression at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional steps could be fundamentally governed by the selection of transcription initiation sites.

However, recent studies have demonstrated that each of the two isoforms (α and β) may possess its own specific functions in addition to their common enzymatic properties: they are distinguished on the basis of one being a homologue to the transcription factor for the human c-myc gene (PuF/nm23-H2) and the other the candidate tumor metastasis suppressor (nm23-H1). nucleoside diphosphate chroramphenicol acetyltransferase rapid amplification of DNA ends polymerase chain reaction; bp. base pair, Fr, fragment. NDP kinase expression is reportedly increased at specific stages of life of several organisms and in various types of cells under certain circumstances; for example, during formation of the imaginal discs at the larval stage of Drosophila melanogaster (15Biggs J.

Decreased expression of NDP kinase has been reported also in the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum when aggregation and development of the multicellular organization was triggered by starvation (19Wallet V.

Beginning at the very early stage of the cloning and characterization of the rat NDP kinase mRNA, it was noticed that the quantities of mRNA are not directly related to those of the protein or to enzymatic activity: the NDP kinase mRNA levels vary more than 10-fold among different organs tested, whereas levels of the protein or enzymatic activity vary at most by 2-fold (20Kimura N.

Similar enigmatic phenomena were also observed with cell immortalization: the mRNA was increased severalfold, whereas the protein amount only increased at most 1.5-fold (18Ohneda K. Fukuda M. Shimada N. Ishikawa N. Ichou I. Kaji K. Toyota T. Kimura N. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These observations may suggest possible posttranscriptional regulations of the NDP kinase genes. Although several factors (or motifs) in mRNA have been reported as regulatory elements responsible for the posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression (reviewed in Refs. 21Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar and 22McCarthy J.E.G. Kollmus H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 191-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), such structural analyses of NDP kinase mRNA are totally lacking. Previously we reported genomic structure and transcription start sites for the major isoform (α isoform) of rat NDP kinase and assigned four exons (23Ishikawa N. Shimada N. Munakata Y. Watanabe K. Kimura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14366-14372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since then we have found another type of cDNA clone coding for the α isoform, which is composed of five exons, including an additional 5′-untranslated exon, and spliced differently, which we have termed the long form (now renamed as group 1 type) mRNA, and the previously reported type of the mRNA is termed the short form (now renamed as group 2 type) (13Shimada N. Ishikawa N. Munakata Y. Toda T. Watanabe K. Kimura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2583-2589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations have raised questions as to the relative abundance of the two types of α isoform transcripts, their exact transcription initiation sites, and regulatory mechanism of their expression. To address these questions we sought to identify the transcription start sites for rat NDP kinase α isoform mRNA in detail by RNase protection in combination with the 5′-RACE method, and have identified numerous initiation sites. Furthermore, RNase protection assay and in situ hybridization analyses have revealed the tissue- and cell-specific expression of these mRNA species. These data, together with CAT assay data, which show a core promoter region for the α gene (Fig. 1), may provide a perspective of the complicated transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of the NDP kinase genes. A possible mechanism of the posttranscriptional regulation for NDP kinase expression is discussed based on the finding that the rates at which the transcripts are translated under in vitro conditions are different among the heterogeneous forms. Systemic organs were harvested from Wistar rats aged between 12 and 16 weeks. Total RNA was isolated by the acid-phenol extraction method (24Chomczynski P. Sacci N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, samples were extracted twice in a premixed phenol and guanidinium isothiocyanate solution (ISOGEN; Nippon Gene Inc., Tokyo, Japan) and chloroform. Poly(A)+ RNA was further purified using an oligo(dT)-cellulose spin column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). RNase protection assays were performed as described previously with modifications (23Ishikawa N. Shimada N. Munakata Y. Watanabe K. Kimura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14366-14372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, four RNA probes were synthesized. To identify transcription initiation sites we made two probes; α-l and α-s, which correspond to the rat NDP kinase α gene from −209 to −453 and from −9 to −204, respectively (see Fig. 2). To quantify the two subtypes of the α mRNA, group 1 and group 2, two probes were generated from two RACE clones; α-1 is generated from clone 35A and complementary to the 39 nucleotides of the 3′-end of the first exon (−244 to −206) and 46 nucleotides of the 5′-end of the second exon (−4 to +42), and α-2 is generated from a group 2 type clone and corresponding to a fragment 70 nucleotides in length (−28 to +42) (see Fig. 4). The numbering system used in this study to identify the nucleotide location starts with the translation initiation site (23Ishikawa N. Shimada N. Munakata Y. Watanabe K. Kimura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14366-14372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length synthetic RNAs that represented group 1 and group 2 types of α and β mRNA were used as control samples. The processed materials were electrophoresed in denaturing gels supplemented with 40% formamide.Fig. 4Quantification of the two groups of the mRNA for the rat NDP kinase α isoform. A, top, autoradiogram displaying the protected fragments of an RNase protection assay performed with a probe (α-1) and 10 μg each of Wistar rat total RNA samples from various tissues: cerebrum (lane 5), spleen (lane 6), heart (lane 7), lung (lane 8), liver (lane 9), kidney (lane 10), small intestine (lane 11), testis (lane 12), skeletal muscle and (lane 13); and cell lines: UMR106 (lane 14), 3Y1 (lane 15), and 10 μg of tRNA for the negative control (lane 1).

Subjected samples and their alignment are the same as AView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To ensure the α isoform-specific cDNA synthesis, we used primer 4S (5′-CCGAAGGAACTTCATGG-3′, +126 to +110), corresponding to the 3′-terminal stretch of the second exon of the α gene, where the two homologous (α and β) genes denote the most divergent sequences between them. To obtain full-length cDNA in high efficiency, we applied the two-step reverse transcription reaction. Briefly, 2.5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA and 2 mM primer in water were heated at 85°C for 10 min and then annealed at 65°C for 15 min, followed by the addition of reverse transcription buffer and reverse transcriptase (SuperScript II; Life Technologies, Inc.) and ribonuclease inhibitor (RNasin, Promega), and then incubated at 50°C for 45 min. After heat denaturation at 85°C for 10 min, a second extension reaction was performed by further addition of fresh reverse transcriptase. Next, excess amounts of RNA and the single-stranded portion of RNA were eliminated by ribonuclease A and T1 (Ambion) digestion, and the resulting degraded RNA and excess amounts of primer were removed by an S-300 MicroSpin column (Pharmacia), which reportedly adsorbs single-stranded RNA and synthetic oligonucleotides (25Nehls M. Boehm T. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 336-337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The samples enriched with heteroduplex forms of RNA and cDNA were treated with ribonuclease H (Life Technologies), purified by a Sephadex G-50 spin column (Boehringer Manheim) and then ethanol precipitation. To make templates for PCR, we adopted the single strand ligation to single-stranded cDNA method (26Edwards M.J.B.D. Delort J. Mallet J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5227-5232Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) using a 5′-AmpliFINDER RACE kit (Clontech) following the manufacturer's instruction. The RACE methods (27Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4341) Google Scholar) were carried out with Taq and/or Pfu (Stratagene) polymerases. Representative conditions were as follows. The reaction mixture contained 2 mM each of an anchor-specific primer (5′-CCTCTGAAGGTTCCAGAATCGATAG-3′) and gene-specific primer 2 (5′-ATCTGGCTTGATGGCAATGAAGGTAC-3′, +42 to +17), or 6L (5′-AGAAGCAAGAAGTGTAGTCGATG-3′, −9 to −31), 10% Me2SO, 0.2 mM dNTP, and 2.5 units of Pfu polymerase in a low magnesium buffer (Idaho Technology). Ten μl of the mixture in a glass tube was incubated at 97°C for 60 s, 52°C for 10 s, 75°C for 120 s for 40 cycles, and additionally at 75°C for 10 min in an Idaho Technology 1605 air thermocycler. A 5-μl aliquot of each reaction was applied to a 2.5% agarose gel (see Fig. 3, A and B). The residual 1-μl aliquot was used as a template for a second PCR in the same reaction mixture described above but containing Taq instead of Pfu polymerase. The second reaction was carried out at 95°C for 60 s, 52°C for 10 s, 72°C for 120 s for 10 cycles, and additionally at 72°C for 10 min. The PCR products were subjected to direct subcloning using a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). The established clones were sequenced using a Sequenase sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The full-length cDNA clones were constructed with the 5′-RACE products described above and cDNA clones for the α isoform previously reported (20Kimura N. Shimada N. Nomura K. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15744-15749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We used two RACE clones, 50B and 28H, as representatives of group 1 type α and group 2 type α, respectively. They were cut out from the vectors by EcoRI and then digested with XhoI. The cap site to XhoI site fragments from the RACE products and the XhoI site to poly(A) fragments from cDNA were ligated. The reconstructed fragments were subcloned into pBluescripts (Stratagene) and/or pGEM (Promega) plasmids. A full-length cDNA for the β isoform was also constructed and used for a control (13; data not shown). Several expression plasmids were constructed in the CAT gene containing plasmid pKK232-8 (Pharmacia). Six sense primers, 239 (5′–GAAGGATCCGGGTACCCCAGAGCAGAGAGT-3′), 238 (5′-GAGAGGATCCCAGGGAAAGGTGAATGCAGATG-3′), 237 (5′-GAGAGGATCCTGCCTCACAGCCCTCCGT-3′), 227 (5′–GAGAGTCGATCGCTCTCCGCTGGCACCAGCC-3′), 236 (5′-CTCAGG(C → A)TCCCGCGGTCTCCTTTC-3′), and 228 (5′-AAA(T → G)ATCTGGAAAGCCACGTGTGTCCT-3′), and one antisense primer, 235 (5′–GAGAAGCTTGCAGAAGCAAGAAGTGTAGTCGA-3′), were used to amplify seven overlapping genomic fragments of the 5′-regulatory region for the α isoform. To subclone the PCR fragments into the BamHI-HindIII cloning site of the CAT vector, underlined sequences were added to or altered from gene-specific fragments to generate appropriate restriction enzyme sites denoted by boldface letters. Standard PCRs were performed to amplify the gene fragments, and then the products were digested with BamHI or Sau3AI or BglII and HindIII and then subcloned into pKK232-8. The constructs used in this study were made as follows: 1) prNDPKα(−116)CAT, 228 × 235/BglII and HindIII/−116 to −7; 2) prNDPKα(−158)CAT, 236 × 235/BamHI and HindIII/−158 to −7; 3) prNDPKα(−243)CAT, 227 × 235/Sau3AI and HindIII/−243 to −7; 4) prNDPKα(−366)CAT, 237 × 235/Sau3AI and HindIII/−366 to −7; 5) prNDPKα(−452)CAT, 237 × 235/BamHI and HindIII/−452 to −7; 6) prNDPKα(−568)CAT, 238 × 235/BamHI and HindIII/−566 to −7; and 7) prNDPKα(−606)CAT, 239 × 235/BamHI and HindIII/−606 to −7. Rat organ specimens embedded in Optimum Cutting Temperature compound (Miles Laboratories) were frozen in liquid nitrogen. In situ hybridization of frozen sections (8 μm) was performed following the procedure described elsewhere (28Carrasco D. Bravo R. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994: 466-476Google Scholar). We used three kinds of riboprobes labeled with digoxigenin-11-UTP (Boehringer Mannheim). They were complementary to: 1) the 5′-untranslated region of the group 1 type α mRNA (at position −206 to −384); 2) the 5′-untranslated region of the group 2 type α mRNA (at position −4 to −85); and 3) the 5′-untranslated region for β mRNA. The signals were detected using a digoxigenin detection kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Rat fibroblast cell line 3Y1 and an osteosarcoma cell line, UMR106, (29Partridge N.C. Alcorn D. Michelangeli V.P. Ryan G. Martin T.J. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 4308-4314PubMed Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfections were performed by the lipofection method using N-[1-(2,3-dioleoxyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate (Boehringer Manheim), following the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, cells at a 50-60% confluent state in a dish 10 cm in diameter were transfected with a total of 5 μg of DNA and incubated for 12 h, and then the medium was replaced with fresh medium and incubated for a further 48 h. Cells were harvested, the cell lysates were adjusted to equivalent protein concentrations, and CAT activity was measured following a standard method (30Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). The Rous sarcoma virus-CAT plasmid and purified CAT enzyme were used for positive controls. The conversion rate was calculated by using Quantityone software (PDI Imageware Systems, Huntington Station, NY). Synthetic RNAs were generated from the template plasmids containing either full-length cDNA described above. These synthetic RNAs were capped by using the mRNA capping kit (mCAP™; Stratagene), and then 1 μg of each synthetic RNA was subjected to an in vitro translation assay using the ECL in vitro translation system (Amersham Corp.). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis aliquots of the biotinylated translation products were electrophoretically blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) and detected using streptavidin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and an ECL reagent (Amersham). Densitometric quantification was carried out by using PDQuest software (PDI). Unless otherwise indicated, restriction enzymes and modified enzymes used in this study were purchased from Toyobo (Osaka, Japan). To determine the transcription initiation sites of the two types of α isoform mRNA, we performed RNase protection assays using two kinds of synthetic RNA probes, α-l and α-s When we used α-l, which is complementary to the first exon and a further upstream region of the rat NDP kinase α gene from −209 to −453, extraordinarily numerous protected bands were observed between the positions 185 and 30 judging from the DNA sequencing ladder (Fig. 2A). The major protected bands migrated between positions 185 and 150, 100 and 85, and 60 and 30. On the other hand, the α-s probe, which is complementary to the first intron of the gene from −9 to −204, again provided multiple protected bands between positions 100 and 40 (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, protected band patterns of the α-l probe by the total RNA from the liver and heart were essentially identical, although some subtle differences of the signal intensity were observed (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2). The probe α-s was also protected by the liver total RNA in the same way as observed for the heart RNA (Fig. 2B, lane 1) with a weaker intensity (data not shown). Under the reaction conditions used, the positive control had a single dominant band, and the negative control had no measurable background, leading to the conclusion that reaction conditions were optimized. However, there existed slight ambiguities in the data obtained; synthetic RNA samples used as positive controls provided longer protected fragments than expected by 6 bases. Such differences could be ascribed in part to the fact that each full-length synthetic RNA possessed an artificially added linker sequence at the 5′-end of the genuine sequence. In addition to that possibility, RNA reportedly has slightly slower mobility compared with a DNA molecule of similar size. Thus we tentatively speculate that the major transcription initiation sites are located between positions −50 and −105, −240 and −270, −295 and −315, and −365 and −390. To confirm the data, we used other methods as described below. To identify the transcription initiation site of the rat NDP kinase α isoform, the 5′-RACE method was performed. When we compared amplification efficiency of Pfu with the most conventional thermostable polymerase, Taq, under the same conditions, Pfu generated longer products with higher efficiency than Taq (Fig. 3A). Therefore, we performed PCR using Pfu under relatively high stringent conditions thereafter. Representative crude PCR products obtained with primer 2 and anchor primers are shown in Fig. 3B Considering the anchor primer size (25 mer), the PCR by primer 6L and the anchor primer generated a broad band ranging from 50 to 130 bp and around 200 bp in net length, and PCR by primer 2 and the anchor primer produced a broad band from around 100 to 250-bp. These profiles of the gross PCR products generated with Pfu polymerase agreed well with the gross pattern of the transcription start sites predicted by the RNase protection assays. A number of the PCR products generated with primer 2 were subcloned and verified by sequencing. All of the sequenced clones were found to code for the genuine NDP kinase gene segments without exception. Interestingly, most of the clones appeared to have an additional guanine nucleotide at their 5′-ends. Representative clones are shown in Fig. 3, C and D Recently, Hirzmann et al (31Hirzmann J. Luo D. Hahnen J. Hoborm G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3597-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) have reported that the reverse transcriptase can occasionally read the 5′-cap structure as G during cDNA synthesis, resulting in the addition of a G residue to about half of their RACE clones (31Hirzmann J. Luo D. Hahnen J. Hoborm G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3597-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In our study, 29 of 34 (85%) informative clones possessed a G residue at the 5′-end. Furthermore, 21 of the 29 clones had an unpaired G residue, suggesting that these clones are generated from the full-length RNA templates with the cap-G structure (summarized in Fig. 1). The higher incidence of the reverse transcription of the cap-G residue in our experiments reflects not only high integrity of our template mRNA but also reliability of the techniques we used. The location of the 5′-termini of the NDP kinase α mRNA identified by the RACE method agreed with most of the putative major transcription initiation sites suggested by the RNase protection assay within a couple of nucleotides (e.g. −50, −58, −78, −85, −250, −252, −257, −290, −299, −300, −366, −368, −380, and −384). Accumulated data of the RACE clones further verified the existence of the two different types of the transcripts for the NDP kinase α isoform. All the clones except one (clone 20H), which started further upstream than position −241 (total, 12 clones), were spliced at −206 and accepted at −4 and categorized as the group 1 type mRNA. On the contrary, all clones initiated at any points downstream from position −206 were not spliced and bore various sizes of the 5′-untranslated stretch continuing from the cap sites to the identical translation initiation site at position +1. These clones were categorized as the group 2 type. The splicing donor and acceptor sites do not merely obey the Chambon rule, but the adjacent sequence fits conservative consensus sequences (32Green M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 559-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The exceptional clone 20H could have been generated from a nascent unprocessed mRNA template. In the course of this study we could not find any typical TATA boxes but found heavily GC-rich stretches alongside of the expected binding sites of the basic transcriptional machinery. Considering the huge heterogeneity of the transcription initiation sites for both the group 1 and group 2 type α mRNA, it would be very difficult to quantify them as they are. Therefore, we tried to evaluate the two groups of α isoform transcripts by RNase protection assay using relatively short RNA probes, which were expected to cover most of the transcripts at their common trunks. The RNA probes α-1 and α-2, schematized in Fig. 4, were accordingly used. When the probe α-1 is used, the group 1 and group 2 type α mRNA are expected to produce 85-nucleotide (Fr 1) and 46-nucleotide (Fr 2) protected fragments, respectively. Synthetic standard RNA samples representing the group 1 and group 2 mRNA actually produced such protected fragments, although the protected sizes were somewhat longer than the expected ones, due to complementarity of the adjacent vector sequences to the probe. Total RNA samples extracted from adult rat tissues, including cerebrum, spleen, heart, lung, liver, kidney, small intestine, testis, and skeletal muscle, and two cell lines, UMR106 and 3Y1, were examined and found to produce two to three major protected bands that were concordant with the signals corresponding to the Fr 1 and Fr 2 of the standard samples. The Fr 1 signal"

Dalrymple M.A. Davison A.J. Dolan A. Frame M.C. McNab D. Perry L.J. Scott J.E. Taylor P. J. Gen. Virol. 1988; 69: 1531-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar). The complex array of activities possessed by the helicase-primases encoded by this group of viruses may be attractive targets for antiviral drug design. An understanding of the properties of the HSV-1 helicase-primase may lead to strategies for developing such compounds. In this work we further examine the interaction of the UL5/UL52 subassembly with various DNA coeffectors. Although the enzyme binds both double- and single-stranded DNA, double-stranded DNA fails to stimulate the NTPase activity of the enzyme to the same extent as does single-stranded DNA. Nucleotides are not required for DNA binding. Evidence is presented that shows that activation of NTPase activity varies with the length of the DNA coeffector and that the minimal DNA-binding site is about 12 nucleotides in length. The kinetic parameters for the ATPase activity of the subassembly are also affected by the length of the oligonucleotide coeffector and suggest that the full-length binding site is at least 20 nucleotides. Deoxythymidine oligonucleotides were obtained from U.S. Biochemical Corp. or Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX). The plasmid pVL941 (17Luckow V.A. Summers M.D. Virology. 1989; 170: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and M13mp18 single-stranded DNA were purified according to standard procedures (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Nucleotides for the NTPase assays were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Nucleotides for the filter-binding assays were from Sigma. Bovine serum albumin fraction V was from Sigma. Malachite green hydrochloride and ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate, used in the colorimetric DNA-dependent ATPase assay, were from Sigma and Aldrich, respectively. Buffers were from Sigma and U.S. Biochemical. DEAE and nitrocellulose membranes used for the filter binding assay were from Schleicher & Schuell. [γ-32P]ATP was from Amersham Corp. T4 polynucleotide kinase was from Life Technologies, Inc. Hydroxylapatite (Bio-Gel HTP) was from Bio-Rad. The UL5/UL52 subassembly was purified as described (12Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1105-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) except that hydroxylapatite fractionation was used in place of the gel filtration step. Pooled fractions containing the enzyme were loaded onto hydroxylapatite (1 mg of protein/ml of bed volume) and eluted with a 10-400 mM sodium phosphate buffer gradient, pH 7.5, containing 10% glycerol, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 4 μg/ml pepstatin, and 4 μg/ml leupeptin. Fractions containing the enzyme were pooled, diluted 4-fold in buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 4 μg/ml pepstatin, and 4 μg/ml leupeptin and applied to a 0.5-ml column of DEAE. The column was then washed, and the enzyme was step-eluted with equilibration buffer supplemented with 250 mM NaCl. NTPase assays were essentially performed as described (1Crute J.J. Mocarski E.S. Lehman I.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 6585-6596Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (25 μl) contained 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 3.5 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM ATP, 10% glycerol, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and the indicated amounts of DNA and the UL5/UL52 subassembly. For experiments in which the pH was varied, the following buffers were used in place of HEPES: PIPES, pH 6.5 and 7.0; EPPS, pH 8.0; TAPS, pH 8.5 and 9.0. Incubations were carried out at 37°C for 30 min and then terminated by the addition of 0.75 ml of acidic molybdenum. Five minutes after termination, the absorbance at 650 nm was determined. The amount of inorganic phosphate that was released was determined by comparison with a standard curve in which 1 nmol of phosphate had an absorbance of 0.1. The NTPase assay described above was used with the following modifications. Reaction mixtures contained 32 nM UL5/U52, 30 μM oligonucleotide, and varying concentrations of ATP. The mixtures were incubated for 12 min at 34°C and then terminated and developed as described above. The program DeltaGraph was used to calculate the Km and Vmax values from data that were directly fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation by nonlinear regression. Nitrocellulose filter binding was performed using the double filter method of Wong and Lohman (19Wong I. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The 9.8-kilobase plasmid pVL941 was cleaved into 10 blunt-ended fragments with HincII restriction enzyme. The fragments ranged in length from 27 to about 4,600 base pairs. The fragments were end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 kinase using standard procedures (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Oligo(dT) ranging in length from 8 to 20 nucleotides was end-labeled similarly. Single-stranded DNA was generated from the plasmid fragments by boiling the labeled DNA for 3 min followed by immersion in ice water. Binding reactions were set up by adding the indicated quantities of the UL5/UL52 subassembly to reaction mixtures (25 μl) containing 125 ng of end-labeled plasmid DNA, 3.5 mM MgCl2, 30 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 25 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.5. Reactions that used oligo(dT) contained 100 nM of the indicated oligonucleotide and 67 nM of the UL5/UL52 subassembly. Mixtures were assembled and incubated on ice for 1 h and then filtered through the nitrocellulose-DEAE double membrane using a Bio-Rad dot blot apparatus. The membranes had been conditioned as described (19Wong I. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) and equilibrated in the binding buffer before use. The filtered complexes were then washed with 200 μl of cold binding buffer. Filtered complexes that were formed in the presence of nucleotide were washed with buffer containing the same nucleotide at an equivalent concentration. Binding of DNA to the DEAE and nitrocellulose filters was quantitated simultaneously using a β-emission imaging apparatus. In order to examine the interaction of the UL5/UL52 subassembly with nucleic acids we first sought to identify pH and salt conditions that would yield maximal DNA-dependent ATPase activity. We also wanted to ascertain that conditions optimal for the ATPase activity of the subassembly are the same as those reported for the holoenzyme (20Crute J.J. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4484-4488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We assumed that conditions that are optimal for the DNA-dependent ATPase activity of the enzyme would be optimal for interactions with nucleic acids. The effect of pH on the DNA-dependent ATPase is shown in Fig. 1a The optimal pH was 7.5, and it dropped abruptly on either side of the optimum. This result is similar to that reported for the holoenzyme (20Crute J.J. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4484-4488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that the HSV-1 helicase-primase has two distinct NTPase sites (3Crute J.J. Bruckner R.C. Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21252-21256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One site hydrolyzes ATP only, and the other site hydrolyzes both GTP and ATP. We therefore also examined the effect of pH on the GTPase activity of the enzyme to determine if the two sites could be distinguished by differences in their pH optima (Fig. 1a). The pH profile for GTPase activity was the same as that for ATPase. Thus, if there are two NTPase sites, their pH profiles are similar. The effects of Mg2+ and various salts on the DNA-dependent ATPase activity of the UL5/UL52 subassembly were also examined. The optimal Mg2+ concentration for the DNA-dependent ATPase activity ranged from about 1 to 4 mM (Fig. 1b). These optimal Mg2+ concentrations are the same as those reported for the holoenzyme (20Crute J.J. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4484-4488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Different salts inhibited the DNA-dependent ATPase activity in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1c). Eighty percent of maximal activity was observed in the presence of 50 mM acetate and chloride salts. At higher salt concentrations the chloride ion was more inhibitory than was acetate. The sulfate ion abolished activity at a concentration of 50 mM. The DNA-dependent NTPase activity of most DNA helicases is stimulated by single-stranded DNA only. We sought to determine if this is also true for the DNA-dependent ATPase activity of the UL5/UL52 subassembly. We compared the effect of single-stranded DNA, double-stranded DNA, and single-stranded RNA on the ATPase activity of the enzyme. A 9.8-kb plasmid was cleaved into 10 blunt-ended fragments that ranged from 27 to 4,600 base pairs in length. Mixtures containing increasing amounts of the fragmented plasmid and a constant amount of the UL5/UL52 subassembly were assayed for ATPase activity (Fig. 2a). In the presence of these double-stranded DNA fragments, no activity was observed until the concentration of DNA in the reactions exceeded 5 μM in nucleotide. The fragments were next heat-denatured to yield single-stranded DNA and then tested for the ability to stimulate the ATPase activity of the enzyme. Activity was observed at all concentrations of single-stranded DNA that were tested, with saturation occurring between 5 and 10 μM in nucleotide. At a single-stranded DNA concentration of 5 μM, the ATPase activity was over 40-fold greater than that observed in mixtures containing the double-stranded fragments. A single-stranded homoribopolymer (poly(U)) failed to stimulate the ATPase activity of the enzyme (Fig. 2b). Thus, neither RNA nor double-stranded DNA serves as coeffector for the ATPase activity of the UL5/UL52 subassembly. We next compared the effects of homopolymeric and heteropolymeric single-stranded DNA on the ATPase activity of the UL5/UL52 subassembly. Heteropolymeric DNA is much less effective than homopolymeric DNA in stimulating the DNA-dependent ATPase activity of the HSV-1 origin-binding protein, which is also a DNA helicase and is encoded by the UL9 gene (21Olivo P.D. Nelson N.J. Challberg M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5414-5418Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 22Bruckner R.C. Crute J.J. Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2669-2674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1213-1219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both poly(dT) and poly(dC) effectively activated the ATPase activity of the UL5/UL52 subassembly (Fig. 2b). However, poly(dA) was about 4-fold less effective as an activator. Poly(dT) and single-stranded M13mp18 DNA were equally effective in supporting the ATPase activity of the enzyme (Fig. 2c). This result contrasts with that observed for the HSV-1 origin-binding protein. Some helicases, such as the gene 4 protein encoded by bacteriophage T7, must first bind to a specific nucleotide substrate before binding to DNA (24Matson S.W. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2281-2287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other helicases, such as the Escherichia coli Rep helicase, do not require a nucleotide cofactor for DNA binding (25Lohman T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2269-2272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We used nitrocellulose filter binding to assess the ability of the UL5/UL52 subassembly to bind to single-stranded and double-stranded plasmid DNA fragments in the absence or in the presence of nucleotide. In the absence of nucleotide, the subassembly bound both single- and double-stranded DNA (Fig. 3a). However, the enzyme bound single-stranded DNA about 5-fold more effectively than it did double-stranded DNA. The effect of nucleotides on DNA binding was examined next. To avoid complications of ATP hydrolysis on the binding assay, the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog AMPP(NH)P was used to examine the effect of ATP on DNA binding. Little effect on the binding of either single-stranded or double-stranded DNA was observed in the presence of 2 mM AMPP(NH)P (Fig. 3b). The addition of 2 mM ADP to the mixtures increased the extent of binding to single-stranded DNA but had little effect on binding to double-stranded DNA (Fig. 3c). These results partially resemble those observed for the effect of nucleotides on the binding of DNA by the E. coli Rep helicase (26Wong I. Lohman T.M. Science. 1992; 256: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Kinetic evidence suggests that the HSV-1 helicase-primase has two distinct DNA-binding sites that separately modulate the activity of the two putative NTPase sites (3Crute J.J. Bruckner R.C. Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21252-21256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We sought to determine if these two sites could be distinguished based on differences in the size of the DNA binding sites. We assumed that the size of the binding site(s) could be estimated by determining the minimal length of single-stranded DNA that activates the ATPase and GTPase of the UL5/UL52 subassembly. Deoxythymidine oligonucleotides ranging in length from 6 to over 1000 residues were tested for the ability to activate the DNA-dependent ATPase and GTPase activities of the enzyme (Fig. 4, top). The activation profile was similar for both ATPase and GTPase. Little activation of either ATPase or GTPase was observed for oligonucleotides less than 12 residues in length. Significant activation of both ATPase and GTPase was observed when oligo(dT)12 was used as the coeffector. The extent of activation continued to increase as the lengths of the oligo(dT) effector was increased and reached an apparent maximum for oligonucleotides between 36 and 60 residues in length for both the ATPase and GTPase activities. We also used nitrocellulose filter binding to estimate the minimal length of DNA that is bound by the UL5/UL52 subassembly (Fig. 4, bottom). The minimum length that was bound was 10-12 nucleotides. The extent of binding to (dT)16 and (dT)20 was severalfold higher. Identical results were obtained by gel mobility shift analysis (data not shown). Thus, the minimal length of DNA that is effectively bound and that elicits NTPase activity is about 10-12 nucleotides. We conclude that, if there are two separate DNA binding sites that modulate the activity of the two putative NTPase sites, the sizes of these DNA binding sites are similar. We next sought to determine under initial rate conditions whether the progressive increase in ATPase activity that occurred with longer DNA coeffectors is exerted through enhancement of the hydrolytic efficiency or through the enhanced binding of the ATP substrate by the enzyme. The ATPase activity of the UL5/UL52 subassembly was assayed in the presence of constant concentrations of oligo(dT)n of increasing lengths while the ATP concentration was varied. The Vmax and Km were then determined and plotted as a function of the length of the oligo(dT) activator (Fig. 5, a and b). Vmax appeared to increase in a roughly linear manner as the length of the oligonucleotide was increased (Fig. 5a). However, the Km for ATP was constant for oligo(dT) containing 20 or more residues (Fig. 5b). The Km for ATP was higher in the presence of oligo(dT) of lengths shorter than 20 nucleotides. The effect of the length of the DNA coeffector on the first order rate constants (Vmax/Km) showed a quasihyperbolic effect (Fig. 5c). The first order constant appeared to reach a maximum for DNA coeffectors between 20 and 30 nucleotides in length and could be extrapolated to a minimum of about 10 nucleotides in length. These results suggest that the affinity for ATP is progressively enhanced up to a critical length of the DNA coeffector and then remains constant while the efficiency of catalysis also increases and reaches a maximum once the DNA binding site is fully occupied. In this work we have characterized the interaction of an active subassembly of the HSV-1 helicase-primase with various DNA coeffectors and have assessed their capacity to activate the nucleoside triphosphatase activity of the enzyme. We initiated this study by establishing conditions that maximize the NTPase activity of the UL5/UL52 subassembly. We assume that the pH, Mg2+, and salt optima for NTPase activity are also optimal for the binding of DNA coeffectors by the enzyme. The pH and Mg2+ conditions that we identified as optimal for the DNA-dependent NTPase activity of UL5/UL52 subassembly were the same as those reported for the holoenzyme (20Crute J.J. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4484-4488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The range of pH that supports maximal DNA-dependent ATPase and GTPase is identical, with an optimum pH of 7.5. The pH optimum of the helicase-primase contrasts significantly with that of the UL9 protein, which is another HSV-1-encoded DNA helicase that is required for viral replication and has a pH optimum between 8.5 and 9.0 (23Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1213-1219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic evidence suggests that the HSV-1 helicase-primase has two sites that hydrolyze nucleoside triphosphates in a DNA-dependent manner. Both of these sites can apparently drive the unwinding of duplex DNA (3Crute J.J. Bruckner R.C. Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21252-21256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The UL5 gene product contains a consensus nucleotide binding site near its amino terminus (27Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Donchenko A.P. Blinov V.M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 235: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 28McGeoch D.J. Dalrymple M.A. Dolan A. McNab D. Perrly L.J. Taylor P. Challberg M.D. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 444-453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The location of the second putative NTP binding site on the enzyme is not known. It could reside either on the UL5 or the UL52 gene product. This second site would differ in structure from the consensus sequence at the UL5 N terminus and thus might have a different pH profile. Our failure to detect differences in the pH profiles for the DNA-dependent ATPase and GTPase activities of the enzyme suggests that there is either one DNA-dependent NTPase site, or, if there are two NTPase sites, their pH optima are similar. The effect of nucleic acid composition and structure on the NTPase activity of the UL5/UL52 subassembly also differs from that of the UL9 protein. Double-stranded DNA functions poorly as a coeffector for the UL5/UL52 subassembly. However, double-stranded DNA containing specific sequences from the HSV-1 origin of replication are capable of eliciting the ATPase activity of the UL9 gene product. 2M. S. Dodson and I. R. Lehman, unpublished results. Single-stranded DNA is much more efficient than double-stranded DNA in stimulating the ATPase activity of the UL5/UL52 subassembly. Our observation that homopolymeric RNA is essentially inert as a coeffector suggests that recognition of the sugar-phosphate backbone is crucial for binding or for translocation of the enzyme along the DNA. Single-stranded homopolymers containing pyrimidines function just as well as heteropolymeric single-stranded DNA in stimulating the ATPase activity of the UL5/UL52 subassembly. In contrast to the UL9 protein, the HSV-1 helicase-primase utilizes heteropolymeric and homopolymeric single-stranded DNA equally well for activation of ATPase activity. Presumably the UL9 gene product, which functions as an origin-binding protein, is far less effective than the helicase-primase at unwinding regions of secondary structure in single-stranded heteropolymeric DNA. Furthermore, the DNA-dependent ATPase activity of the UL9 gene product is much weaker than that of the HSV-1 helicase-primase regardless of the type of single-stranded coeffector that is used.2 These distinctions may reflect different mechanisms of DNA unwinding by these two helicases, both of which have a different role in viral DNA replication. The DNA binding properties of the UL5/UL52 subassembly differ from those of the helicase-primases encoded by the bacteriophages T4 and T7 (24Matson S.W. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2281-2287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the enzymes encoded by these phages, the binding of DNA by the herpes-encoded enzyme does not require prior binding of nucleotide. However, the affinity of the enzyme for DNA appears to be modulated by the presence of nucleotides in a manner that may be similar to that observed for the Rep helicase encoded by E. coli (26Wong I. Lohman T.M. Science. 1992; 256: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanism of DNA unwinding of the herpes enzyme may differ from the helicase-primases encoded by bacteriophages. Recent evidence suggests that there are two separate DNA-binding sites on the HSV-1 helicase-primase that activate NTPase activity of the enzyme (3Crute J.J. Bruckner R.C. Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21252-21256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One of these DNA-binding sites activates the NTPase site that hydrolyzes both GTP and ATP. The second DNA-binding site activates the site that hydrolyzes ATP only. We expected that the sizes of these two DNA-binding sites might differ and could be discriminated by differences in the lengths of poly(dT) that are required for NTPase activation. However, the minimal length of poly(dT) that stimulates the ATPase and GTPase activity of the UL5/UL52 subassembly is the same, about 12 nucleotides. The extent of stimulation for the ATPase and GTPase activities also appears to reach a maximum at about 36 nucleotides, which may reflect complete occupancy of the binding site. Tenney et al. (15Tenney D.J. Sheaffer A.K. Hurlburt W.W. Bifano M. Hamatake R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9129-9136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) have obtained similar results for the stimulation of ATPase activity with heteropolymeric oligonucleotides. Thus, if there are two DNA-binding sites, the sizes of the binding pockets are similar. The effect of the length of the DNA coeffector on the kinetic parameters for the ATPase activity of the UL5/UL52 subassembly is complex. The first order rate constant for the ATPase activity of the UL5/UL52 subassembly increases as the length of the DNA coeffector is increased and reaches a plateau for coeffectors of 20 nucleotides or longer, while the Km for ATP decreases and then remains constant for coeffectors of 20 nucleotides or longer. These observations could suggest that in the absence of DNA of a critical length the affinity of the helicase-primase for ATP is low. Upon binding DNA of a critical length, the enzyme shifts into a conformation that productively binds ATP. Further increases in the length of the DNA incrementally push the enzyme into a catalytically more efficient conformation until a maximum is reached at 20 nucleotides or longer. Young et al. (29Young M.C. Schultz D.E. Ring D. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1447-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) observed a somewhat similar phenomenon for the gene 41 helicase-primase encoded by bacteriophage T4. The extreme differences in the ability of poly(dT) versus poly(dA) to activate the ATPase activity of the helicase-primase suggests that steric variability in the nucleic acid sequence also affects the manner in which the DNA occupies the binding cleft. Consequently, the differences in catalytic efficiency with variable lengths and sequences of DNA may reflect a need for the binding site to be able to accommodate wide ranges of steric variability as the enzyme translocates along the DNA coeffector.
