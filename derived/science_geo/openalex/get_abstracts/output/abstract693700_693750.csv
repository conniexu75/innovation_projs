The HBV receptor has been identified as sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP), which interacts directly with the first 48 amino acid residues of the N-myristoylated N-terminal preS1 domain of the viral large protein3. Despite the pressing need for therapeutic agents to counter HBV, the structure of NTCP remains unsolved. This 349-residue protein is closely related to human apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT), another member of the solute carrier family SLC10. Crystal structures have been reported of similar bile acid transporters from bacteria4,5, and these models are believed to resemble closely both NTCP and ASBT. Here we have used cryo-electron microscopy to solve the structure of NTCP bound to an antibody, clearly showing that the transporter has no equivalent of the first transmembrane helix found in other SLC10 proteins, and that the N terminus is exposed on the extracellular face. Comparison of our structure with those of related proteins indicates a common mechanism of bile acid transport, but the NTCP structure displays an additional pocket formed by residues that are known to interact with preS1, presenting new opportunities for structure-based drug design."
https://openalex.org/W4280535485,"Purpose To analyze the cause of prolonged recovery from general anesthesia with remimazolam. Methods We studied 65 patients under general anesthesia with remimazolam. According to time to extubation, patients were divided into short period (SP) (n = 34, &lt; 15 min) and long period (LP) (n = 31, ≥ 15 min) groups. Variables affecting time to extubation such as age, sex, height, body weight, body mass index (BMI), plasma albumin concentration, ASA class, duration of surgery, and total duration of general anesthesia, and total dose of remimazolam were compared between SP and LP groups. At the end of remimazolam infusion and upon extubation, predictive remimazolam concentrations were calculated using pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic three compartment modeling. Results LP group showed significantly higher BMI, older age, and lower plasma albumin concentration compared with those of SP group. Logistic regression analysis showed that the probability of time to extubation of ≥ 15 min was higher in patients with BMI greater than 22.0 kg/m 2 (AUC 0.668, 95% CI 0.533‒0.803), ages older than 79.0 years (AUC 0.662, 95% CI 0.526‒0.798), and plasma albumin concentrations lower than 3.60 g/dl (AUC 0.720, 95% CI 0.593‒0.847). LP group showed significantly lower predicted remimazolam concentration than SP group upon extubation despite no difference in concentration between both groups at the end of infusion. Pharmacological analysis estimates that LP group is more sensitive to remimazolam than SP group through amplified responses. Conclusions Lower remimazolam doses should be considered for the overweight patients, elderly, and those with lower plasma albumin concentration."
https://openalex.org/W4280544256,"Rampant gender-based harassment and discrimination are recognized problems that negatively impact efforts to diversify science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. We explored the particularities of this phenomenon in the geosciences, via focus groups conducted at STEM professional society meetings, with the goal of informing interventions specific to the discipline. Using grounded theory analysis, two primary drivers for the persistence and perpetuation of gender-based harassment in the geosciences were identified: a particular history of power dynamics and maintenance of dominant stereotypes, and a pattern of ineffective responses to incidents of harassment and discrimination. Informed by intersectional feminist scholarship by women of color that illustrates how efforts to address the underrepresentation of women in STEM without attending to the overlapping impacts of racism, colonialism, ableism, and classism will not succeed, we view harassment and discrimination as structural problems that require collective solutions. Continuing to recruit individuals into a discipline without changing its fundamental nature can tokenize and isolate them or encourage assimilation and acceptance of deep-seated traditions no matter how damaging. It is the responsibility of those in power, and especially those who hold more privileged status due to their social identities, to contribute to the dismantling of current structures that reinforce inequity. By providing explanatory illustrative examples drawn from first-person accounts we aim to humanize the numbers reported in workplace climate surveys, address gaps in knowledge specific to the geosciences, and identify interventions aligned with an intersectional framework that aim to disrupt discriminatory practices endemic to the geosciences and larger STEM community."
https://openalex.org/W4280518716,"CARD8 is a pattern-recognition receptor that forms a caspase-1-activating inflammasome. CARD8 undergoes constitutive autoproteolysis, generating an N-terminal (NT) fragment with a disordered region and a ZU5 domain and a C-terminal (CT) fragment with UPA and CARD domains. Dipeptidyl peptidase 8 and dipeptidyl peptidase 9 inhibitors, including Val-boroPro, accelerate the degradation of the NT fragment via a poorly characterized proteasome-mediated pathway, thereby releasing the inflammatory CT fragment from autoinhibition. Here, we show that the core 20S proteasome, which degrades disordered and misfolded proteins independent of ubiquitin modification, controls activation of the CARD8 inflammasome. In unstressed cells, we discovered that the 20S proteasome degrades just the NT disordered region, leaving behind the folded ZU5, UPA, and CARD domains to act as an inhibitor of inflammasome assembly. However, in Val-boroPro-stressed cells, we show the 20S proteasome degrades the entire NT fragment, perhaps due to ZU5 domain unfolding, freeing the CT fragment from autoinhibition. Taken together, these results show that the susceptibility of the CARD8 NT domain to 20S proteasome-mediated degradation controls inflammasome activation."
https://openalex.org/W4280563031,"Nationwide research about the clinical and economic burden caused by anastomotic leakage (AL) has not been published yet in Korea. This study assessed the AL rate and quantified the economic burden using the nationwide database.This real world evidence study used health claims data provided by the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA, which showed that 156,545 patients underwent anterior resection (AR), low anterior resection (LAR), or ultra-low anterior resection (uLAR) for colorectal cancer (CRC) between January 1, 2007 and January 31, 2020. The incidence of AL was identified using a composite operational definition, a composite of imaging study, antibacterial drug use, reoperation, or image-guided percutaneous drainage. Total hospital costs and length of stay (LOS) were evaluated in patients with AL versus those without AL during index hospitalization and within 30 days after the surgery.Among 120,245 patients who met the eligibility criteria, 7,194 (5.98%) patients had AL within 30 days after surgery. Male gender, comorbidities (diabetes, metastatic disease, ischemic heart disease, ischemic stroke), protective ostomy, and multiple linear stapler use, blood transfusion, and urinary tract injury were associated with the higher odds of AL. Older age, rectosigmoid junction cancer, AR, LAR, and laparoscopic approach were related with the reduced odds of AL. Patients with AL incurred higher costs for index hospitalization compared to those without AL (8,991 vs. 7,153 USD; p<0.0001). Patients with AL also required longer LOS (16.78 vs. 14.22 days; p<0.0001) and readmissions (20.83 vs. 13.93 days; p<0.0001).Among patients requiring resection for CRC, the occurrence of AL was associated with significantly increased costs and LOS. Preventing AL could not only produce superior clinical outcomes, but also reduce the economic burden for patients and payers."
https://openalex.org/W4280652872,"Facial expressions are subtle cues, central for communication and conveying emotions in mammals. Traditionally, facial expressions have been classified as a whole (e.g. happy, angry, bared-teeth), due to automatic face processing in the human brain, i.e., humans categorise emotions globally, but are not aware of subtle or isolated cues such as an eyebrow raise. Moreover, the same facial configuration (e.g. lip corners pulled backwards exposing teeth) can convey widely different information depending on the species (e.g. humans: happiness; chimpanzees: fear). The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is considered the gold standard for investigating human facial behaviour and avoids subjective interpretations of meaning by objectively measuring independent movements linked to facial muscles, called Action Units (AUs). Following a similar methodology, we developed the CalliFACS for the common marmoset. First, we determined the facial muscular plan of the common marmoset by examining dissections from the literature. Second, we recorded common marmosets in a variety of contexts (e.g. grooming, feeding, play, human interaction, veterinary procedures), and selected clips from online databases (e.g. YouTube) to identify their facial movements. Individual facial movements were classified according to appearance changes produced by the corresponding underlying musculature. A diverse repertoire of 33 facial movements was identified in the common marmoset (15 Action Units, 15 Action Descriptors and 3 Ear Action Descriptors). Although we observed a reduced range of facial movement when compared to the HumanFACS, the common marmoset’s range of facial movements was larger than predicted according to their socio-ecology and facial morphology, which indicates their importance for social interactions. CalliFACS is a scientific tool to measure facial movements, and thus, allows us to better understand the common marmoset’s expressions and communication. As common marmosets have become increasingly popular laboratory animal models, from neuroscience to cognition, CalliFACS can be used as an important tool to evaluate their welfare, particularly in captivity."
https://openalex.org/W4280525363,"Starting from the second century BC, with the fast expansion of the Roman Empire, iron production and consumption developed exponentially in north-western Europe. This rapid growth naturally led to an increase in trade, that still remains to be studied encompassing a broad scope, so as to not neglect long-distance exchanges. This is today possible by taking advantage of the progress made in the past 40 years in archaeology and archaeometallurgy. Cargoes of iron bars recovered from a group of 23 wrecks located off the coast of Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer (Bouches-du-Rhône, France), opposite an old branch of the Rhône River, constitute a rich opportunity to examine this trade, by comparing the slag inclusions trapped in iron bars to primary slag from the six main ironmaking areas in Gaul. Based on a trace element analysis of these inclusions and this slag, we suggest that ships travelled down the Rhône carrying iron produced in Wallonia (Belgium), while others sailed up the Rhône transporting iron produced in Montagne Noire (Aude, France)."
https://openalex.org/W3130344179,"As 2021 dawns, the COVID-19 pandemic is still raging strongly as vaccines finally appear and hopes for a return to normalcy start to materialize. There is much to be learned from the pandemic's first year data that will likely remain applicable to future epidemics and possible pandemics. With only minor variants in virus strain, countries across the globe have suffered roughly the same pandemic by first glance, yet few locations exhibit the same patterns of viral spread, growth, and control as the state of Hawai'i. In this paper, we examine the data and compare the COVID-19 spread statistics between the counties of Hawai'i as well as examine several locations with similar properties to Hawai'i."
https://openalex.org/W4280620589,"Propolis is produced by honeybees and used to seal their hives for defensive purposes and has been used in ethnopharmacology since ancient times. It is a lipophilic material containing a large collection of naturally produced plant organic molecules, including flavonoids. The flavonoid galangin is consistently found in propolis, independent of the hive geographical location and its X-ray crystal and molecular structure is reported. The antioxidant scavenging of superoxide by galangin and propolis is here presented. Using a cyclic voltammetry technique developed in our lab, we show that galangin is an excellent scavenger of the superoxide radical, perhaps even better than quercetin. Our results show that galangin displays a Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) function. This is described experimentally and theoretically (DFT). Two modes of scavenging superoxide are seen for galangin: (1) superoxide radical extraction of H atom from the hydroxyl moieties located in position 3 and 5 of galangin, which are also associated with proton incorporation defining the SOD action; (2) π-π interaction among several superoxide radicals and the galangin polyphenol ring that evolve towards release of O 2 and H 2 O 2 . We describe these two actions separately as their relative sequence, and/or combination, cannot be defined; all these processes are thermodynamically spontaneous, or subjected to mild barriers."
https://openalex.org/W4280621316,"Stress is omnipresent in our everyday lives. It is therefore critical to identify potential stress-buffering behaviors that can help to prevent the negative effects of acute stress in daily life. Massages, a form of social touch, are an effective buffer against both the endocrinological and sympathetic stress response in women. However, for other forms of social touch, potential stress-buffering effects have not been investigated in detail. Furthermore, the possible stress-buffering effects of social touch on men have not been researched so far. The present study focused on embracing, one of the most common forms of social touch across many cultures. We used a short-term embrace between romantic partners as a social touch intervention prior to the induction of acute stress via the Socially Evaluated Cold Pressor Test. Women who embraced their partner prior to being stressed showed a reduced cortisol response compared to a control group in which no embrace occurred. No stress-buffering effect could be observed in men. No differences between the embrace and control group were observed regarding sympathetic nervous system activation measured via blood pressure or subjective affect ratings. These findings suggest that in women, short-term embraces prior to stressful social situations such as examinations or stressful interviews can reduce the cortisol response in that situation."
https://openalex.org/W4280625801,"Background HIV-related self-stigma is a significant barrier to HIV management. However, very little research has explored this phenomenon, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. This study explored the beliefs, experiences, and impacts of HIV self-stigma amongst adolescents and young adults (AYALHIV) in Harare, Zimbabwe to inform future interventions. It aimed to capture the lived experience of self-stigmatization among AYALHIV and its impact on their social context using Corrigan et al (2009) self-stigma framework of ‘awareness’, ‘agreement’, and ‘application’. Methods Virtual semi-structured key informant interviews were conducted between June and July 2020 with adolescents and young adults (Female = 8; Male = 8) living with HIV (18–24 years) in Harare, Zimbabwe. We conducted the interviews with a purposive sample of AYALHIV enrolled in Africaid’s ‘Zvandiri’ program which provides HIV support services. Interviews were mainly conducted in English and with three in Shona, the main indigenous language. Audio-recorded qualitative data were transcribed, translated into English (where necessary) and deductively coded using Corrigan et al.’s self-stigma framework. The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 coincided with the commencement of data collection activities, which impacted on both the sample size and a shift from in-person to virtual interviewing methods. Results Sixteen respondents (50% male) took part in the interviews. The mean age of respondents was 22 years. All respondents reported HIV-related self-stigma either occasionally or frequently. Three main themes of self-stigmatizing experiences emerged: disclosure, relationships, and isolation. These themes were then analyzed within the self-stigma development framework by Corrigan et al. (2009) known as ‘the three As’: awareness, agreement, and application of self-stigmatizing thoughts. Respondents’ experiences of self-stigma reportedly led to poor well-being and decreased mental and physical health. Gendered experiences and coping mechanisms of self-stigma were reported. Data suggested that context is key in the way that HIV is understood and how it then impacts the way people living with HIV (PLHIV) live with, and experience, HIV. Conclusions HIV-related negative self-perceptions were described by all respondents in this study, associated with self-stigmatizing beliefs that adversely affected respondents’ quality of life. Study findings supported Corrigan et al.’s framework on how to identify self-stigma and was a useful lens through which to understand HIV-related self-stigma among young people in Harare. Study findings highlight the need for interventions targeting PLHIV and AYALHIV to be context relevant if they are to build individual resilience, while working concurrently with socio-political and systemic approaches that challenge attitudes to HIV at the wider societal levels. Finally, the gendered experiences of self-stigma point to the intersecting layers of self-stigma that are likely to be felt by particularly marginalized populations living with HIV and should be further explored."
https://openalex.org/W4280632923,"Introduction During COVID-19 pandemic, Internal Medicine Units (IMUs) accounted for about 70% of patients hospitalized. Although a large body of data has been published regarding the so-called first wave of the pandemic, little is known about the characteristics and predictors of worse outcomes of patients managed in IMUs during the second wave. Methods We prospectively assessed demographics, comorbidities, treatment and outcomes, including ventilation support (VS) and death, in patients admitted to our IMU for SARS-CoV-2 between October 13th, 2020 and January 21st, 2021. Clinical evolution and biochemical testing 1, 7 and 14 days after COVID-19 diagnosis were recorded. Results We studied 120 patients (M/F 56/64, age 71±14.5 years) admitted to our IMU. Most of them had at least one comorbidity (80%). Patients who died were older, more frequently underweight, affected by malignant neoplasms and on statin therapy compared to patients eventually discharged. Both worse outcome groups (VS and death) presented higher neutrophils, ferritin, IL-6 and lower total proteins levels than controls. Age was significantly associated with mortality but not with VS need. The multivariate analysis showed age and gender independent association of mortality with underweight, malignancy and antibiotics use at the admission. With regard to biochemical parameters, both unfavourable outcomes were positively associated with high WBC count, neutrophils, blood urea nitrogen and low serum total proteins. Conclusions Our study identified inflammation, underweight, malignancy and a marked catabolic state as the main predictors for worse outcomes in COVID-19 patients admitted to IMU during the so-called second wave of the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4280511304,"The Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF) is aimed at measuring the three dimensions of mental health; emotional, social, and psychological well-being. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the MHC-SF within the context of Singapore and Australia. A total of 299 Singaporeans or permanent residents (59.2% female; mean age = 24.26, SD = 6.13) and 258 Australians or permanent residents (69% female; mean age = 23.95, SD = 8.66) completed the study. Confirmatory factor analyses were used to assess the structural validity of the MHC-SF. Internal consistency reliability was assessed via the Cronbach's α and MacDonald's ω reliability coefficients. Concurrent validity was examined against the World Health Organisation-Five Well-Being Index, discriminant validity using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and criterion validity using a self-rated question of ""Please rate your averaged level of mental health over the past month"", all via Pearson's correlations. A bifactor model of the MHC-SF, where each item loaded on a general factor and simultaneously on their respective uncorrelated group factors, yielded the best fit to the data across both samples. Further investigations demonstrated that the general well-being factor accounted for majority of variances of the MHC-SF. Internal consistency reliability, concurrent validity, discriminant validity, and criterion validity were all demonstrated. In conclusion, the current study provided support for the bifactor model of MHC-SF and demonstrated evidence of good psychometrics across both samples. The results highlighted the unidimensionality of the measure, suggesting that it is more informative to interpret the aggregated score than scores of independent factors standalone."
https://openalex.org/W4280511718,"Spermatogenesis is a highly coordinated and complex process, and is pivotal for transmitting genetic information between mammalian generations. In this study, we investigated the conservation, differences, and biological functions of homologous genes during spermatogenesis in Mongolia sheep, humans, cynomolgus monkey, and mice using single-cell RNA sequencing technology. We compared X chromosome meiotic inactivation events in Mongolia sheep, humans, cynomolgus monkey, and mice to uncover the concerted activity of X chromosome genes. Subsequently, we focused on the dynamics of gene expression, key biological functions, and signaling pathways at various stages of spermatogenesis in Mongolia sheep and humans. Additionally, the ligand-receptor networks of Mongolia sheep and humans in testicular somatic and germ cells at different developmental stages were mapped to reveal conserved germ cell-soma communication using single-cell resolution. These datasets provided novel information and insights to unravel the molecular regulatory mechanisms of Mongolia sheep spermatogenesis and highlight conservation in gene expression during spermatogenesis between Mongolia sheep and humans, providing a foundation for the establishment of a large mammalian disease model of male infertility."
https://openalex.org/W4280632918,"Athletes are currently fond of vibration foam rollers (VFRs) and commercial portable vibration percussion devices (PVPDs). It is still unknown whether using these devices during warm-up has an immediate impact on athletic performance. A randomized block design was used in this study. The acute effects of VFR and PVPD on tennis players' athletic performance during warm-up were compared. For the countermovement jump (CMJ), reactive strength index (RSI), and hexagon test (HT), the difference in performance between all interventions was significant (p = 0.007-0.034, η2p = 0.266-0.364). Only those who received VFR had significantly different CMJ and HT results when compared to the control group (CMJ height = 53.18 ±4.49 cm, p = 0.03, d = 1.26; HT time = 10.73 ±0.4 s, p = 0.03, d = 1.12). Participants' RSI values were significantly different after VFR (RSI = 2.01 ±0.11 cm·mm-1, p = 0.012, d = 1.76) and PVPD (RSI = 1.99 ±0.11 cm·mm-1, p = 0.025, d = 1.52) compared to the control group. Therefore, when using VFR and PVPD as part of warm-up protocols for tennis players of varying skill levels, VFR could have an immediate positive effect on power, reactive strength, and change of direction performance, while PVPD could immediately improve reactive strength performance."
https://openalex.org/W3201856297,"Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric condition affecting nearly a quarter of the United States war veterans who return from war zones. Treatment for PTSD typically consists of a combination of in-session therapy and medication. However; patients often experience their most severe PTSD symptoms outside of therapy sessions. Mobile health applications may address this gap, but their effectiveness is limited by the current gap in continuous monitoring and detection capabilities enabling timely intervention. The goal of this article is to develop a novel method to detect hyperarousal events using physiological and activity-based machine learning algorithms. Physiological data including heart rate and body acceleration as well as self-reported hyperarousal events were collected using a tool developed for commercial off-the-shelf wearable devices from 99 United States veterans diagnosed with PTSD over several days. The data were used to develop four machine learning algorithms: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression and XGBoost. The XGBoost model had the best performance in detecting onset of PTSD symptoms with over 83% accuracy and an AUC of 0.70. Post-hoc SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) additive explanation analysis showed that algorithm predictions were correlated with average heart rate, minimum heart rate and average body acceleration. Findings show promise in detecting onset of PTSD symptoms which could be the basis for developing remote and continuous monitoring systems for PTSD. Such systems may address a vital gap in just-in-time interventions for PTSD self-management outside of scheduled clinical appointments."
https://openalex.org/W4280507294,"Mycobacteriophages are phages that infect mycobacteria resulting in their killing. Although lysis is the primary mechanism by which mycobacteriophages cause cell death, others such as abortive infection may also be involved. We took recourse to perform immunofluorescence and electron microscopic studies using mycobacteriophage D29 infected Mycobacterium smegmatis cells to investigate this issue. We could observe the intricate details of the infection process using these techniques such as adsorption, the phage tail penetrating the thick mycolic acid layer, formation of membrane pores, membrane blebbing, and phage release. We observed a significant increase in DNA fragmentation and membrane depolarization using cell-biological techniques symptomatic of programmed cell death (PCD). As Toxin-Antitoxin (TA) systems mediate bacterial PCD, we measured their expression profiles with and without phage infection. Of the three TAs examined, MazEF, VapBC, and phd/doc, we found that in the case of VapBC, a significant decrease in the antitoxin (VapB): toxin (VapC) ratio was observed following phage infection, implying that high VapC may have a role to play in the induction of mycobacterial apoptotic cell death following phage infection. This study indicates that D29 infection causes mycobacteria to undergo morphological and molecular changes that are hallmarks of apoptotic cell death."
https://openalex.org/W4280517017,"Healthcare workers (HCWs) stand the risk of acquiring infection directly, while attending to patients or indirectly while handling and testing patient specimens. Considering this, the present study was planned to assess Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) breaches and exposures among HCWs working in COVID-19 wards/ screening areas and to evaluate their COVID-19 positivity rates post-exposure concerning the level of exposure, type of PPE breach, and the cadre of HCWs exposed in COVID-19 wards.This retrospective cross-sectional study involved the analysis of all instances of PPE breaches which occurred during a period of nine months from June 2020 to February 2021 at a tertiary care level hospital in Central India. The analysis included all exposures involving any cadre of HCWs that occurred while handling the patients or while doffing the contaminated PPE in COVID -19 wards.A total of 347 PPE breaches were analyzed from the available records of the Hospital Infection Control team repository. Amongst the 347 breaches, 268 (77.2%) were classified as low-risk exposures and 79 (22.8%) as high-risk exposures. Cadre wise distribution of high and low-risk exposures revealed that, PPE breaches occurred most commonly in the category of nursing officers (n = 174, 50.1%). Among all of the breaches, 15.2% of high-risk exposures and 2.6% of low-risk exposures resulted in COVID-19 positivity with a cumulative positivity of 5.4%. Collectively, non-mask related breaches accounted for the majority (63.2%) of the positive COVID-19 cases.Appropriate use of PPE by HCWs is vital for their protection. However, breaches in the use of PPE may occur while managing COVID-19 patients due to physical and mental exhaustion among HCWs resulting from work overload. Early identification and appropriate management of HCWs with high-risk exposures can help prevent transmission to other hospital staff and patients, thus preserving resources and workforce."
https://openalex.org/W4280520387,"Autoimmune hepatitis is an interface hepatitis characterized by the progressive destruction of the liver parenchyma, the cause of which is still obscure. Interleukin (IL)-17A is a major driver of autoimmunity, which can be produced by innate immune cells against several intracellular pathogens. Here, we investigated the involvement of IL-17A in a mice model of immune-mediated hepatitis with the intestine exposed to Salmonella typhimurium. Our results showed more severe Concanavalin (Con) A-induced liver injury and gut microbiome dysbiosis when the mice were treated with a gavage of S. typhimurium. Then, the natural killer (NK) T cells were overactivated by the accumulated IL-17A in the liver in the Con A and S. typhimurium administration group. IL-17A could activate NKT cells by inducing CD178 expression via IL-4/STAT6 signaling. Furthermore, via the portal tract, the laminae propria mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT)-cell-derived IL-17A could be the original driver of NKT cell overactivation in intragastric administration of S. typhimurium and Con A injection. In IL-17A-deficient mice, Con A-induced liver injury and NKT cell activation were alleviated. However, when AAV-sh-mIL-17a was used to specifically knock down IL-17A in liver, it seemed that hepatic IL-17a knock down did not significantly influence the liver injury. Our results suggested that, under Con A-induction, laminae propria MAIT-derived IL-17A activated hepatic NKT, and this axis could be a therapeutic target in autoimmune liver disease."
https://openalex.org/W4280552173,"This paper empirically tests the relationship between digital finance and income distribution of residents in 280 cities in China from 2011 to 2020 using linear and nonlinear models, respectively. Based on the Greenwood-Jovanovic (G-J) theory of output grow, the empirical study shows that there is a Kuznets effect of digital finance development on the income distribution of Chinese residents, and most regions have not yet crossed the inflection point of the bell-shaped curve, and the income gap within regions will continue to increase with the development of digital finance. Furthermore, the threshold model test shows that the positive effect of digital finance on the income disparity of residents may initially increase with the increase of regional economic level. However, when the regional economic development reaches a higher stage, the negative effect of digital finance development on the income distribution of residents will be significantly reduced."
https://openalex.org/W4280560695,"The aim of this paper is to study the association between childhood circumstances and loneliness in older adults in Europe. Based on rich information collected by the Survey on Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) on childhood characteristics and individual characteristics at age 50+, the study is able to control for personality traits, socioeconomic and demographic factors, social support and health in later life, and country-specific characteristics. The analyses show strong correlations between life circumstances in childhood and feeling lonely in older age; these correlations remain significant after adjusting for covariates. While ill health is the main factor correlated with loneliness at 50+, as expected, the analysis of the relative importance of the determinants reveals that personality traits account for more than 10% of the explained variance and that life circumstances during childhood account for 7%. Social support at older ages is the second highest category of factors, accounting for 27%—with, interestingly, support at home and social network characteristics contributing about 10% each, engaging in activities and computer skills accounting for 7% of the explained variance. Demographic and socioeconomic factors account for 6% and country-level characteristics contribute 5%. This paper points out the relevance of early life interventions to tackling loneliness in older age, and it shows that early interventions and interventions aiming at increasing social support in later life need to be adapted to all personality types. Thus, the role of childhood circumstances and the mechanisms explaining the association between loneliness in childhood and loneliness in later life deserve more attention in future research."
https://openalex.org/W4280588973,"Introduction Hypocalcaemia remains a prevalent laboratory finding in pregnancy, capable of inducing adverse maternofoetal outcomes. This study compares the prevalence of hypocalcaemia in apparently healthy pregnant women from the ionised, and total calcaemia viewpoints and further identifies factors associated with total crude and ionised hypocalcaemia in pregnancy. Methods A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted between November 2020 and September 2021, targeting apparently healthy pregnant women received in late pregnancy in four maternities in the Nkongsamba Health District, Cameroon. Blood samples were collected and analysed for serum ionised calcium concentrations and pH (by ion-selective electrode potentiometry), and for total calcium and albumin concentration (by atomic absorption spectrophotometry). Sociodemographic, obstetric and nutritional data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Results The average age of the 1074 participants included in the study was 28.20±6.08 years. The prevalence of total crude and total albumin-corrected hypocalcaemia in this study was 61.64 [58.69–64.50]% and 56.70 [53.72–59.64]%, respectively ( p -value = 0.000). The prevalence of ionised hypocalcaemia was very low (2.89 [2.04–4.07]%) compared with the prevalence of total hypocalcaemia ( p -value = 0.000). Monthly income below 100.000FCFA (179 USD) (AOR = 0.73, p -value = 0.024), taking more than 2 meals daily (AOR = 0.68, p -value = 0.006) and taking desserts (AOR = 0.73, p -value = 0.046) reduced the odds of total crude hypocalcaemia, while having banana/plantain and tubers as the content of their most consumed meal significantly increased the odds of total crude hypocalcaemia (AOR = 1.37, p -value = 0.012). Single women (AOR = 2.54, p -value = 0.021), with a higher education (AOR = 3.27, p -value = 0.017), who initiated antenatal care before 4 months (AOR = 2.47, p -value = 0.029), had their odds of ionised hypocalcaemia significantly increased. On the other hand, women below 30 years (AOR = 0.44, p -value = 0.039), with occupations other than housewife (AOR = 0.34, p -value = 0.027), and women who took desserts between meals (AOR = 0.45, p -value = 0.034) had their odds of ionised hypocalcaemia significantly reduced. Taking calcium supplements simultaneously with other supplements also significantly reduced the odds of total hypocalcaemia in pregnancy (OR = 0.69, p -value = 0.027). Conclusion Ionised hypocalcaemia in pregnancy is a rare finding. Only 2.89% of all apparently healthy pregnant women have ionised hypocalcaemia in late pregnancy, while 56.70% have total hypocalcaemia. Factors like the daily number of meals, taking of desserts, the content of the most consumed meal and monthly revenue significantly affect the prevalence of total hypocalcaemia in pregnancy. On the other hand, factors like age above 30 years, having a higher education, being single, having initiated antenatal care before 4 months of pregnancy, being a housewife and not taking desserts between meals have a significantly positive association with ionised hypocalcaemia."
https://openalex.org/W4280604439,"A model-based clustering method for compositional data is explored in this article. Most methods for compositional data analysis require some kind of transformation. The proposed method builds a mixture model using Dirichlet distribution which works with the unit sum constraint. The mixture model uses a hard EM algorithm with some modification to overcome the problem of fast convergence with empty clusters. This work includes a rigorous simulation study to evaluate the performance of the proposed method over varied dimensions, number of clusters, and overlap. The performance of the model is also compared with other popular clustering algorithms often used for compositional data analysis (e.g. KMeans, Gaussian mixture model (GMM) Gaussian Mixture Model with Hard EM (Hard GMM), partition around medoids (PAM), Clustering Large Applications based on Randomized Search (CLARANS), Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) etc.) for simulated data as well as two real data problems coming from the business and marketing domain and physical science domain, respectively. The study has shown promising results exploiting different distributional patterns of compositional data."
https://openalex.org/W4280610061,"Protoaurignacian foragers relied heavily on the production and use of bladelets. Techno-typological studies of these implements have provided insights into crucial aspects of cultural variability. However, new technologies have seldom been used to quantify patterns of stone tool design. Taking advantage of a new scanning protocol and open-source software, we conduct the first 3D analysis of a Protoaurignacian assemblage, focusing on the selection and modification of blades and bladelets. We study a large dataset of complete blanks and retouched tools from the early Protoaurignacian assemblage at Fumane Cave in northeastern Italy. Our main goal is to validate and refine previous techno-typological considerations employing a 3D geometric morphometrics approach complemented by 2D analysis of cross-section outlines and computation of retouch angle. The encouraging results show the merits of the proposed integrated approach and confirm that bladelets were the main focus of stone knapping at the site. Among modified bladelets, various retouching techniques were applied to achieve specific shape objectives. We suggest that the variability observed among retouched bladelets relates to the design of multi-part artifacts that need to be further explored via renewed experimental and functional studies."
https://openalex.org/W4280635355,"The connection between international trade and food systems (un)sustainability is both contentious and critical for policy work supporting progress towards achieving the twin goals of hunger alleviation and dietary health while improving the overall sustainability of development. We characterize the food system using a set of metrics based upon the EAT-Lancet commission dietary guidelines for both over- and under-consumption of different foods to assess country-level dietary health and sustainability in tandem. Using a partial equilibrium model of agricultural production and trade, we then project the functioning of the global agricultural system to 2050 and calculate the metrics for that year. For most regions we find increased overconsumption above the expert-defined healthy and sustainable diet thresholds, with more limited progress towards closing dietary health and sustainability gaps where they currently exist. Trade influences this dynamic into the future under certain socioeconomic conditions, and we find that under a “business as usual” trade environment, future agricultural import profiles continue to be misaligned with dietary health and sustainability outcomes, suggesting the potential for early intervention in trade policy as a means to positively influence food system outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4280654154,"A manatee’s primary modality to detect a vessel on a possible collision course is hearing as underwater visibility is limited in many manatee habitats and their visual acuity is poor. We estimate a Florida manatee’s ability to detect the sound of an approaching boat and vocalizations in four different soundscapes in Sarasota Bay, FL. Background noise samples were collected every 5 minutes for a two-week period during winter and summer at each location (2019 or 2020). Sound levels in third octave bands (0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 kHz) were measured and compared to manatee auditory hearing thresholds and to sound levels of an approaching boat traveling at a slow, medium, or fast speed. Background sound levels in a wider band (1–20 kHz) were calculated to model vocal communication space at each location. We found that a manatee’s estimated ability to detect an approaching boat differs greatly among locations, with time of day, and by season, and that fast boats are predicted to be detected later than slow boats. Latency of boat noise detection is estimated to sharply increase when considering unusually loud background noise levels. We suggest that such uncommonly loud conditions (e.g. 95 th percentile sound level), not just typical conditions (median sound level), are important to consider for understanding the problem of manatee-boat collisions. Additionally, background noise impacts estimated vocal communication space and may limit the ability of vocal-mediated mother-calf cohesion. Altogether, a manatee’s ability to detect acoustic signals of interest is expected to vary greatly spatially and temporally."
https://openalex.org/W3206878952,"Societal ideas and trends dictate media narratives and cinematic depictions which in turn influence people's beliefs and perceptions of the real world. Media portrayal of individuals and social institutions related to culture, education, government, religion, and family affect their function and evolution over time as people perceive and incorporate the representations from portrayals into their everyday lives. It is important to study media depictions of social structures so that they do not propagate or reinforce negative stereotypes, or discriminate against a particular section of the society. In this work, we examine media representation of different professions and provide computational insights into their incidence, and sentiment expressed, in entertainment media content. We create a searchable taxonomy of professional groups, synsets, and titles to facilitate their retrieval from short-context speaker-agnostic text passages like movie and television (TV) show subtitles. We leverage this taxonomy and relevant natural language processing models to create a corpus of professional mentions in media content, spanning more than 136,000 IMDb titles over seven decades (1950-2017). We analyze the frequency and sentiment trends of different occupations, study the effect of media attributes such as genre, country of production, and title type on these trends, and investigate whether the incidence of professions in media subtitles correlate with their real-world employment statistics. We observe increased media mentions over time of STEM, arts, sports, and entertainment occupations in the analyzed subtitles, and a decreased frequency of manual labor jobs and military occupations. The sentiment expressed toward lawyers, police, and doctors showed increasing negative trends over time, whereas the mentions about astronauts, musicians, singers, and engineers appear more favorably. We found that genre is a good predictor of the type of professions mentioned in movies and TV shows. Professions that employ more people showed increased media frequency."
https://openalex.org/W4280498267,"Sibling rivalry or brood reduction prevailing within bird nests is effectively avoided in solitary aculeate nests because the larvae of wasps and bees usually develop in each brood cell. However, a solitary wasp species, Isodontia harmandi , allows us to study brood reduction in a communal brood cell, where up to a dozen larvae develop in a group relying on prey provisioned by a female wasp. To demonstrate brood reduction in this species, we collected nests at various developmental brood stages from fields for five years (2010–2015). There was a significant decrease in the brood size between the nests sampled at the egg or hatchling stages and those at later stages when analyzing only data excluding nests that were parasitized, attacked by predators, or containing deteriorated prey. In whole brood-rearing experiments, we also confirmed that brood reduction occurred in 30 of 39 nests during larval stages and in 23 nests after cocoon stage. Larval survival was affected positively by total prey weight and negatively by brood size, though cocoon survival was not affected. A third-quarter (76%) of larval death was identified as sibling cannibalism through observation by time-lapse recording on multi-larvae rearing experiments. Therefore, we conclude that brood reduction routinely occurs as a result of sibling cannibalism in I . harmandi . Additionally, as we could not detect any positive effects of clutch size on the amount of provision, female wasps might overproduce offspring due to the unpredictability of available prey resources. Differences in brood size and reduction among sex categories were undetected, except for parental provisions. Thus, sibling cannibalism may efficiently regulate brood size in communal brood cells under prey shortage."
https://openalex.org/W4280505817,"Objectives This comparative study aimed to evaluate intraoral digital photography (IODP) as assessment-tool for DMFT and number of implants (IMPL) compared to clinical diagnosis (CLIN) in an elderly population with high restorative status. Secondary research questions were whether an additional evaluation of panoramic radiographs (PAN-X) or raters’ clinical experience influence the agreement. Methods Fifty patients (70.98±7.60 years) were enrolled for standardized CLIN and IODP. The clinical reference examiner and ten blinded raters evaluated the photographs without and with a PAN-X regarding DMFT and IMPL. CLIN were used as reference standard and differences to IODP and IODP-PAN-X findings were analysed descriptively. To assess intra-rater agreement, pairwise Gwet’s AC1s of the three diagnostic methods CLIN, IODP and IODP+PAN-X were calculated. Results Compared to a DMFT of 22.10±3.75 (CLIN), blinded raters evaluated a DMFT of 21.54±3.40 (IODP) and 22.12±3.45 (IODP+PAN-X). Mean values for “Decayed” were 0.18±0.52 (CLIN), 0.45±0.46 (IODP) and 0.48±0.47 (IODP-PAN-X), while 11.02±5.97 (CLIN), 10.66±5.78 (IODP) and 10.93±5.91 (IODP+PAN-X) were determined for “Missing” and 10.90±5.61 (CLIN), 10.43±4.85 (IODP) and 10.71±5.11 (IODP+PAN-X) for “Filled”. IMPL were 0.78±2.04 (CLIN), 0.58±1.43 (IODP), 0.78±2.04 (IODP+PAN-X). Gwet’s AC1 using the mode of the blinded raters’ assessment of ""Decayed"", ""Missing"" and IMPL compared to CLIN ranged from 0.81 to 0.89 (IODP) and 0.87 to 1.00 (IODP+PAN-X), while for ""Filled"" and DMFT they were 0.29 and 0.36 (IODP) as well as 0.33 and 0.36 (IODP+PAN-X), respectively. Clinical experience did not influence the agreement. Conclusions Assessment of “Decayed”, “Missing” and IMPL by IODP showed almost perfect agreement, whereas of “Filled” and DMFT revealed fair to moderate agreement with clinical findings. Additional PAN-X-evaluation increased agreement compared to IODP-diagnostics alone. IODP for the assessment of DMFT and IMPL might be a suitable method in large-scale epidemiological studies, considering high agreement in total values and miscellaneous agreement at patient-level."
https://openalex.org/W4280507284,"Acute gastrointestinal illness (AGI) is a prevalent public health concern worldwide. This study investigated the magnitude, distribution and burden of self-reported AGI among residents of Zhejiang Province, China. A face-to-face household survey was conducted using a multi-stage stratified random sampling method in 10 counties in Zhejiang Province between July 2018 and June 2019. In total, 12,021 participants were recruited. The prevalence of AGI 28 days after standardization was 1.8% (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.6–2.1), with an incidence rate of 0.24 episodes of AGI per person-year and an estimated 14 million cases of AGI in Zhejiang Province. Univariate and multivariable analyses showed a higher AGI prevalence among people who performed housework and were unemployed in summer and autumn among respondents living in western or northern cities ( p &lt; 0.05). More than 50% of AGI cases were attributed to the consumption of contaminated food. The disease burden caused by AGI in Zhejiang Province was approximately 975 million Chinses yuan (CNY). These results indicated that the disease burden of AGI in Zhejiang Province should be addressed and highlights the need for an improved active surveillance system of foodborne diseases to assess the impact of AGI on society and health."
https://openalex.org/W4280507439,"The archaeological site of Salorno—Dos de la Forca (Bozen, Alto Adige) provides one of the rarest and most significant documentations of cremated human remains preserved from an ancient cremation platform ( ustrinum ). The pyre area, located along the upper Adige valley, is dated to the Late Bronze Age ( ca . 1150–950 BCE) and has yielded an unprecedented quantity of cremated human remains (about 63.5 kg), along with burnt animal bone fragments, shards of pottery, and other grave goods made in bronze and animal bone/antler. This study focuses on the bioanthropological analysis of the human remains and discusses the formation of the unusual burnt deposits at Salorno through comparisons with modern practices and protohistoric and contemporaneous archaeological deposits. The patterning of bone fragmentation and commingling was investigated using spatial data recorded during excavation which, along with the bioanthropological and archaeological data, are used to model and test two hypotheses: Salorno—Dos de la Forca would be the result of A) repeated primary cremations left in situ ; or B) of residual material remaining after select elements were removed for internment in urns or burials to unknown depositional sites. By modelling bone weight and demographic data borrowed from regional affine contexts, the authors suggest that this cremation site may have been used over several generations by a small community–perhaps a local elite. With a quantity of human remains that exceeds that of any other coeval contexts interpreted as ustrina , Salorno may be the product of a complex series of rituals in which the human cremains did not receive individual burial, but were left in situ , in a collective/communal place of primary combustion, defining an area of repeated funeral ceremonies involving offerings and libations across a few generations. This would represent a new typological and functional category that adds to the variability of mortuary customs at the end of the Bronze Age in the Alpine are, at a time in which “globalising” social trends may have stimulated the definition of more private identities."
https://openalex.org/W4280524611,"Few studies have analysed the effect of HIV universal test and treat (UTT) on retention and mortality among people living with HIV (PLHIV) in routine care. We examined six-month retention and mortality at 11 health facilities (HFs) run by a large NGO, The AIDS Support Organisation (TASO), before and after UTT.We used a quasi-experimental study using patient data extracted from 11 TASO HFs. Two periods, one before UTT (2015-2016) and the other during UTT (2017-2018) were compared. The primary outcome was six-month retention defined as the proportion of PLHIV who were alive and in care at six months from enrolment. The secondary outcome was six-month mortality defined as the proportion of PLHIV who died within six months from enrolment. We performed an interrupted time series analysis using graphical aids to study trends in six-month retention and mortality and a segmented regression to evaluate the effect of UTT. We used a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) and generalized estimating equations (GEE) to account for facility-level clustering.Of the 20,171 PLHIV registered between 2015 and 2018 and included in the analysis, 12,757 (63.2%) were enrolled during the UTT period. 5256/7414 (70.9%) of the pre-UTT period compared to 12239/12757 (95.9%) of the UTT were initiated on ART treatment with 6 months from enrolment. The median time from enrolment to initiating ART was 14 (interquartile range (IQR): 0-31) days for the pre-UTT compared to 0 (IQR: 0-0) days for the UTT period. The median age at enrolment was 32.5 years for the pre-UTT and 35.0 years for the UTT period. Overall, the six-month retention just after scale-up of UTT, increased by 9.2 percentage points (p = 0.002) from the baseline value of 82.6% (95% CI: 77.6%-87.5%) but it eventually decreased at a rate 1.0 percentage point (p = 0.014) for cohorts recruited each month after UTT. The baseline six-month mortality was 3.3% (95% CI: 2.4%-4.2%) and this decreased by 1.6 percentage points (p = 0.003) immediately after UTT. The six-month mortality continued decreasing at a rate of 0.1 percentage points (p = 0.002) for cohorts enrolled each month after UTT. Retention differed between some health facilities with Rukungiri HF having the highest and Soroti the lowest retention. Retention was slightly higher among males and younger people. Mortality was highest among people aged 50 years and more. The effect of UTT on retention and mortality was similar across sex and age groups.Overall, UTT significantly led to an immediate increase in retention and decrease in mortality among PLHIV enrolled in HIV care from 11 HFs run by TASO in Uganda. However, retention (and mortality) significantly decreased for cohorts enrolled each month after UTT. Retention was highest in Rukungiri and lowest in Soroti HFs and slightly higher in males and younger people. Mortality was highest in older patients and lowest in adolescents. We recommend for innovative interventions to improve the overall retention particularly in facilities reporting low retention in order to achieve the UNAIDS 2030 target of 95-95-95."
https://openalex.org/W4280525535,"To examine differences in recidivism rates between different prisons using two designs-between-individual and within-individual-to account for confounding factors.We examined recidivism rates among 37,891 individuals released from 44 Swedish prisons in three security levels, and who were followed from 2006 to 2013. We used longitudinal data from nationwide registers, including all convictions from district courts. First, we applied a between-individual design (Cox proportional hazards regression), comparing reconviction rates between individuals released from prisons within the same security level, while adjusting for a range of individual-level covariates. Second, we applied a within-individual design (stratified Cox proportional hazards regression), comparing rates of reconviction within the same individuals, i.e., we compared rates after release from one prison to the rates in the same individual after release from another prison, thus adjusting for all time-invariant confounders within each individual (e.g. genetics and early environment). We also adjusted for a range of time-varying individual-level covariates.Results showed differences in the hazard of recidivism between different prisons in between-individual analyses, with hazards ranging from 1.22 (1.05-1.43) to 4.99 (2.44-10.21). Results from within-individual analyses, which further adjusted for all time-invariant confounders, showed minimal differences between prisons, with hazards ranging from 0.95 (0.87-1.05) to 1.05 (0.95-1.16). Only small differences were found when violent and non-violent crimes were analyzed separately.The study highlights the importance of research designs that more fully adjust for individual-level confounding factors to avoid over-interpretation of the variability in comparisons across prisons."
https://openalex.org/W4280531231,"In recent years, drug sensitivity prediction has garnered a great deal of attention due to the growing interest in precision medicine. Several computational methods have been developed for drug sensitivity prediction and the identification of related markers. However, most previous studies have ignored genetic interaction, although complex diseases (e.g., cancer) involve many genes intricately connected in a molecular network rather than the abnormality of a single gene. To effectively predict drug sensitivity and understand its mechanism, we propose a novel strategy for explainable drug sensitivity prediction based on sample-specific gene regulatory networks, designated Xprediction. Our strategy first estimates sample-specific gene regulatory networks that enable us to identify the molecular interplay underlying varying clinical characteristics of cell lines. We then, predict drug sensitivity based on the estimated sample-specific gene regulatory networks. The predictive models are based on machine learning approaches, i.e., random forest, kernel support vector machine, and deep neural network. Although the machine learning models provide remarkable results for prediction and classification, we cannot understand how the models reach their decisions. In other words, the methods suffer from the black box problem and thus, we cannot identify crucial molecular interactions that involve drug sensitivity-related mechanisms. To address this issue, we propose a method that describes the importance of each molecular interaction for the drug sensitivity prediction result. The proposed method enables us to identify crucial gene-gene interactions and thereby, interpret the prediction results based on the identified markers. To evaluate our strategy, we applied Xprediction to EGFR-TKIs prediction based on drug sensitivity specific gene regulatory networks and identified important molecular interactions for EGFR-TKIs prediction. Our strategy effectively performed drug sensitivity prediction compared with prediction based on the expression levels of genes. We also verified through literature, the EGFR-TKIs-related mechanisms of a majority of the identified markers. We expect our strategy to be a useful tool for predicting tasks and uncovering complex mechanisms related to pharmacological profiles, such as mechanisms of acquired drug resistance or sensitivity of cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W4280541389,"Xanthine oxidase (XO) is a key enzyme in the generation and development of hyperuricemia. Thiazolidine-2-thione, a typical heterocyclic compound, have been widely used in the field of drug synthesis. In this study, a series of novel thiazolidine-2-thione derivatives were synthesized as XO inhibitors, and the XO inhibitory potencies of obtained compounds were evaluated by in vitro enzyme catalysis. The result shown that compound 6k behaved the strongest XO inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 3.56 μmol/L, which was approximately 2.5-fold more potent than allopurinol. The structure-activity relationship revealed that the phenyl-sulfonamide group was indispensable for thiazolidine-2-thione derivatives to produce XO inhibitory activity. The enzyme inhibition kinetics analyses confirmed that compound 6k exerted a mixed-type XO inhibition. Additionally, the molecular docking results suggested that the 4-fluorophenyl-sulfonyl moiety could interact with Gly260 and Ile264 in the innermost part of the active pocket through 2 hydrogen bonds, while the thiazolidinethione moiety could form two hydrogen bonds with Glu263 and Ser347 in hydrophobic pockets. In summary, the results described above suggested that compound 6k could be a valuable lead compound for the treatment of hyperuricemia as a novel XO inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W4280650650,"The sedimentary history of two stromatoporoid accumulations ‒ an allobiostrome and a parabiostrome–are studied in the shallow water carbonates of the Middle to Upper Devonian Kowala Formation in the Ołowianka Quarry, Holy Cross Mountains, central Poland. Sedimentological and facies observations are accompanied by morphometrical and taphonomical analyses of redeposited stromatoporoid skeletons. Stromatoporoid features, including shape profile, latilaminae arrangement, surface character, dimensions, and preservation state, are interpreted in terms of their original growth habitats and susceptibility to exhumation and transport. Sedimentary features of the studied beds are interpreted with regards to the high-energy processes that lead to their deposition. In the allobiostrome, the original stromatoporoid habitat was located below storm wave base, in a calm setting characterised by a low and stable depositional rate and clear bottom waters. The large scale onshore redeposition of stromatoporoid skeletons from such a setting was only possible due to an extraordinary event causing erosion at considerable depths: a tsunami is the most probable explanation. The sedimentary and textural features of the allobiostromal accumulation, such as clast supported textures and lack of vertical sorting, point to a single act of deposition and high flow velocities, in agreement with the tsunami interpretation. In contrast, the parabiostromal stromatoporoid accumulation does not exhibit any features that would require a non-tempestitic explanation, the default and most probable interpretation of high energy facies interbedding shallow water lagoonal sediments. This comparison has shown that studies of variously developed stromatoporoid beds, and particularly the analysis of morphometric features of stromatoporoid skeletons, can provide a unique opportunity to identify palaeotsunamites, which commonly remain undetected in the sedimentary record, leading to underestimates of their abundance."
https://openalex.org/W4280504724,"Globally, migration phenologies of numerous avian species have shifted over the past half-century. Despite North American waterfowl being well researched, published data on shifts in waterfowl migration phenologies remain scarce. Understanding shifts in waterfowl migration phenologies along with potential drivers is critical for guiding future conservation efforts. Therefore, we utilized historical (1955-2008) nonbreeding waterfowl survey data collected at 21 National Wildlife Refuges in the mid- to lower portion of the Central Flyway to summarize changes in spring and autumn migration phenology. We examined changes in the timing of peak abundance from survey data at monthly intervals for each refuge and species (or species group; n = 22) by year and site-specific temperature for spring (Jan-Mar) and autumn (Oct-Dec) migration periods. For spring (n = 187) and autumn (n = 194) data sets, 13% and 9% exhibited statistically significant changes in the timing of peak migration across years, respectively, while the corresponding numbers for increasing temperatures were 4% and 9%. During spring migration, ≥80% of significant changes in the timing of spring peak indicated advancements, while 67% of significant changes in autumn peak timing indicated delays both across years and with increasing temperatures. Four refuges showed a consistent pattern across species of advancing spring migration peaks over time. Advancements in spring peak across years became proportionally less common among species with increasing latitude, while delays in autumn peak with increasing temperature became proportionally more common. Our study represents the first comprehensive summary of changes in spring and autumn migration phenology for Central Flyway waterfowl and demonstrates significant phenological changes during the latter part of the twentieth century."
https://openalex.org/W4280517537,"Physical activity is essential to maintain physical and mental well-being. During the COVID-19 pandemic, in-person physical activity opportunities were limited. This paper describes a telephone-based physical activity support strategy among racially/ethnically diverse patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Adult patients at a large, Federally Qualified Health Center with an on-site exercise facility referral were eligible to transition to telephone support with personal fitness advisors during the pandemic stay-at-home orders. Baseline surveys assessed physical activity and environmental characteristics; follow-up phone calls used motivational interviewing and physical activity goal setting strategies. From March 23-July 23, 2020, 72 patients participated in 270 phone calls, or 3.8 (±2.1) calls per participant. Participants were, on average, aged 51.3 (±11.6) years, 87.5% female, 31.9% Hispanic/Latino, and 47.2% non-Hispanic Black. Patients meeting physical activity guidelines pre-pandemic reported more planned exercise (100.0% vs. 55.3%; p&lt;0.001), exercise days at home (5.0 vs. 1.7; p&lt;0.001), and accomplishment of personal physical activity goals (57.0% vs. 39.7%; p = 0.11) than patients not meeting guidelines pre-pandemic. Patients with a home treadmill participated in twice the rate of calls compared to those without (RR = 2.22; 95%CI:1.35,3.64), but no other home environmental characteristics predicted participation rate. Pre-pandemic physical activity behavior appeared to predict pandemic physical activity and telephone-based physical activity support was effective for maintaining physical activity for some participants. Long term applications of this work will support continuity of clinic-community partnerships for health behavior change and provide a model for patient physical activity support by community health centers without on-site exercise facilities."
https://openalex.org/W4280519752,"Cortisol secretion has a fundamental role in human circadian regulation. The cortisol awakening response (CAR) can be observed as a daily recurring sharp increase in cortisol concentration within the first hour after awakening and is influenced by environmental light conditions. The current work provides the study protocol for an ongoing research project that is intended to explore the spectral dependencies and to discuss measures of emotional state and cognitive functioning potentially related to the CAR. Based on a controlled within-subjects sleep laboratory study, the impact of a two-hour, (quasi-)monochromatic, post-awakening light exposure of different peak wavelength (applied from 6:00 to 8:00 am) on resulting CAR levels should be investigated in a systematic manner to eventually derive a corresponding spectral sensitivity model. As a secondary outcome, it should be explored whether a potentially light-enhanced cortisol secretion might also impact different measures of sleepiness, mood, and vigilance for certain wavelengths. The study protocol described in the present work discusses the various protocol steps using pilot data collected for two different wavelength settings (i.e., short-wavelength blue-light at λmax = 476 nm and long-wavelength red-light at λmax = 649 nm) experienced by a group of four healthy male adults at an average ± SD age of 25.25 ± 3.59 years."

Descriptive and conditional logistical regression analysis techniques were used.61% of professionals in our sample choose informal sources of information, with only about 11% looking to formal peer reviewed evidence. The numbers of professionals turning to general internet searches is more than twice as high as any other information source other than professional colleagues. Dentists with advanced training and specialists are significantly more likely to consult peer-reviewed sources, and women in the sample were more likely than men to continue searching past a first source.Speed/availability of information may be just as, or in some cases, more important than credibility for professionals' search behavior. Additionally, our findings suggest that more insights are needed into how various categories of professionals within a profession seek information differently."
https://openalex.org/W4280554011,"Recent researches revealed object detection networks using the simple “classification loss + localization loss” training objective are not effectively optimized in many cases, while providing additional constraints on network features could effectively improve object detection quality. Specifically, some works used constraints on training sample relations to successfully learn discriminative network features. Based on these observations, we propose Structural Constraint for improving object detection quality. Structural constraint supervises feature learning in classification and localization network branches with Fisher Loss and Equi-proportion Loss respectively, by requiring feature similarities of training sample pairs to be consistent with corresponding ground truth label similarities. Structural constraint could be applied to all object detection network architectures with the assist of our Proxy Feature design. Our experiment results showed that structural constraint mechanism is able to optimize object class instances’ distribution in network feature space, and consequently detection results. Evaluations on MSCOCO2017 and KITTI datasets showed that our structural constraint mechanism is able to assist baseline networks to outperform modern counterpart detectors in terms of object detection quality."

This study examines variation between national and local CPGs, using the example of acute paediatric asthma guidance from the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Methods Fifteen British and Dutch local CPGs were collected with the matching national guidance for the management of acute asthma in children under 18 years old. The drug sequences, routes and methods of administration recommended for patients with severe asthma and the tone of recommendation across both types of CPGs were schematically represented. Deviations from national guidance were measured. Variation in recommended doses of intravenous salbutamol was examined. CPG quality was assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II. Results British and Dutch national CPGs differed in the recommended drug choices, sequences, routes and methods of administration for severe asthma. Dutch national guidance was more rigidly defined. Local British CPGs diverged from national guidance for 23% of their recommended interventions compared to 8% for Dutch local CPGs. Five British local guidelines and two Dutch local guidelines differed from national guidance for multiple treatment steps. Variation in second-line recommendations was greater than for first-line recommendations across local CPGs from both countries. Recommended starting doses for salbutamol infusions varied by more than tenfold. The quality of the sampled local CPGs was low across all AGREE II domains. Conclusions Local CPGs for the management of severe acute paediatric asthma featured substantial variation and frequently diverged from national guidance. Although limited to one condition, this study suggests that unmeasured variation across local CPGs may contribute to variation of care more broadly, with possible effects on healthcare quality."
https://openalex.org/W4280574388,"Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a staple food of Madagascar, where per capita rice consumption is among the highest worldwide. Rice in Madagascar is mainly grown on smallholder farms on soils with low fertility and in the absence of external inputs such as mineral fertilizers. Consequently, rice productivity remains low and the gap between rice production and consumption is widening at the national level. This study evaluates genetic resources imported from the IRRI rice gene bank to identify potential donors and loci associated with low soil fertility tolerance (LFT) that could be utilized in improving rice yield under local cultivation conditions. Accessions were grown on-farm without fertilizer inputs in the central highlands of Madagascar. A Genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) for total panicle weight per plant, straw weight, total plant biomass, heading date and plant height. We detected loci at locations of known major genes for heading date (hd1) and plant height (sd1), confirming the validity of GWAS procedures. Two QTLs for total panicle weight were detected on chromosomes 5 (qLFT5) and 11 (qLFT11) and superior panicle weight was conferred by minor alleles. Further phenotyping under P and N deficiency suggested qLFT11 to be related to preferential resource allocation to root growth under nutrient deficiency. A donor (IRIS 313-11949) carrying both minor advantageous alleles was identified and crossed to a local variety (X265) lacking these alleles to initiate variety development through a combination of marker-assisted selection with selection on-farm in the target environment rather than on-station as typically practiced."
https://openalex.org/W4280590539,"Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is an essential element of almost every brain MRI examination. The most widely applied DWI technique, a single-shot echo-planar imaging DWI (EPI-DWI) sequence, suffers from a high sensitivity to magnetic field inhomogeneities. As an alternative, a single-shot stimulated echo acquisition mode diffusion-weighted MRI (STEAM-DWI) has recently been re-introduced after it became significantly faster. The aim of the study was to investigate the applicability of STEAM-DWI as a substitute to EPI-DWI in a daily routine of pediatric radiology.Retrospectively, brain MRI examinations of 208 children with both EPI-DWI and STEAM-DWI were assessed. Visual resolution and diagnostic confidence were evaluated, the extent of susceptibility artifacts was quantified, and contrast-to-noise ratio was calculated in case of diffusion restriction. Furthermore, the correlation of apparent diffusion coefficient values between STEAM-DWI and EPI-DWI was tested.STEAM-DWI was inferior to EPI-DWI in visual resolution but with higher diagnostic confidence and lower artifact size. The apparent diffusion coefficient values of both sequences demonstrated excellent correlation. The contrast-to-noise ratio of STEAM-DWI was only half of that of EPI-DWI (58% resp. 112%).STEAM-DWI is a robust alternative to EPI-DWI when increased susceptibility artifacts are to be expected. Drawbacks are a lower contrast-to-noise ratio and poorer visual resolution."

Timely initiation of complementary foods during infancy is necessary for growth and development. The first two years of life are important period for rapid physical, cognitive and social development that requires optimal nutrition. Currently, there is no study done in this rural community about timely initiation of complementary feeding.The main aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of timely initiation of complementary feeding among mothers having children aged 6-24 months in Farta district, rural Ethiopia.A community-based cross-sectional study was employed from December 2020 to February 2021 among 570 mothers by using multi-stage sampling techniques. Data were collected using a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire and entered into Epi Data 4.6 then transferred to Statistical Package for Social Science version 25 for analysis. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis with a 95% confidence interval carried out to determine the association between explanatory and the outcome variables. A P-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.The prevalence of timely initiation of complementary feeding among mothers having children aged 6-24 months was 51.9%. Institutionaldelivery [(AOR = 2.10, 95% CI: (1.31-3.32)],Keeping livestock [(AOR = 2.21, 95% CI: (1.35, 3.65)], Postnatal follow up [(AOR = 0.60, 95% CI:(0.36, 0.77)],merchants [(AOR = 4.58; 95% CI:1.99, 10.55)], and daily labourer [(AOR = 2.88, 95% CI:(1.50-5.51)] were statistically associated with timely initiation of complementary feeding.This finding revealed that the prevalence of timely initiation of complementary feeding is still low. Factors affecting timely initiations of complementary feeding were home delivery, unable to attend postnatal care follow-up, being housewife and farmers. All health professionals including health extension workers should give special attention to advising and counseling for mothers and their husbands about timely initiation of complementary feeding."
https://openalex.org/W4280619327,"American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) youth are strong in culture and rich in heritage and experience unique strengths and challenges throughout adolescence. Documenting conditions that protect against risk factors associated with poor health outcomes are needed. We explored scales that measure self-esteem, culture, social support, and community from a sample of 1,456 youth involved in Native STAND, a culturally-relevant evidence-based sexual health intervention. We established content validity by reviewing existing literature and community feedback. Construct validity was examined using factor analysis. The final self-esteem model included seven items, factor loadings ranged from 0.47 to 0.63 for positive self-esteem and 0.77 to 0.81 for negative self-esteem. The final culture model included three items, factor loadings 0.73 to 0.89. The social support scale included four items, factor loadings ranged from 0.86 to 0.87 for family social support and 0.75 to 0.77 for friends social support. The community and community safety scale included three items; factor loadings ranged from 0.52 to 0.82. Coefficient alphas for scales ranged from α = 0.63 to α = 0.86. This study validated scales in a national sample of AI/AN youth-psychometric scales provide an essential tool for documenting the needs and strengths of AI/AN youth."
https://openalex.org/W4280624365,"The data related to many medical, environmental and ecological variables are often measured in terms of angles wherein its range is defined in [0, π ). This type of data is referred to as axial or half circular data. Modeling based on half circular data has not received its due share of attention in statistical literature. In this paper, we introduce a new half circular distribution based on inverse stereographic projection technique on modified Burr−III distribution, called the half circular modified Burr−III (hcMB−III) distribution. The basic properties of the proposed distribution are derived. It is common observation that while estimating the parameters of a model, one usually adopts maximum likelihood estimation method as the starting point. In this paper, we consider seven frequentist methods of estimation, besides using maximum likelihood method for estimating the parameters of the hcMB−III distribution. Monte Carlo simulations are performed for investigating the performances of the considered methods in terms of their biases and mean square errors using small, medium and large sample sizes. Finally, one data set related to posterior corneal curvature of the eyes of 23 patients, is analyzed to check potentiality of the newly proposed model."
https://openalex.org/W4280634161,"Background Screening standing and walking balance is useful for people suspected of having vestibular disorders, a variety of neurologic and musculoskeletal disorders, and for screening astronauts returning after exposure to microgravity. Visitors to a community science education center children and adults, aged 4 to 85, were tested on tandem walking with eyes closed and the modified Romberg test on compliant foam. They were then asked about their experience participating in research, many people for the first time. Methods Subjects performed 10 steps of tandem walking with eyes closed, and three trials of the modified Romberg, or Clinical Test of Sensory Integration and Balance, with eyes closed, standing on compliant memory foam, with a) head still, b) head shaking in yaw, and c) head nodding in pitch. Afterward, staff queried subjects about the experience of participating in science. Results Age-related changes across the life span occurred in both sets of tests. Therefore, look-up tables by age are provided. Body mass index significantly affected tandem walking. Some sex differences were found. The tests were easy to administer in a community setting. Most participants enjoyed the experience and reported that they learned about the process of scientific research. Discussion These data support and extend the evidence for age-related changes in balance performance across the lifespan and for an influence of body mass index on some balance skills. Clinicians and sports educators should be cognizant of these differences when they use these tests for screening. The community science education environment provided a useful laboratory in which to collect valid and reliable data, while simultaneously educating participants about the process of science."
https://openalex.org/W4280648303,"The NBA has undergone formative changes since commissioner David Stern began his tenure. Stern has endeavored to make the NBA a consumer-friendly and marketable league by implementing sanctions on physical violence. This study takes a closer look at Stern's efforts by examining the interplay between two forms of violence in NBA basketball players on the court: ""old fashioned"" physical violence (PV) and symbolic violence (SV). Of the 117 NBA finals broadcast for twenty years from 1998 to 2018, a stratified random sample (36 games or 30.8%) of the violations and commentators' comments were coded, providing a wide perspective on forms of violence over time. The findings reveal that although the number of PV incidents decreased, SV increased starting in 2014, to the extent that SV incidents were more frequent than PV. A thematic analysis of the commentators' remarks associated with these incidents showed that they support and encourage PV, whereas SV tends to be perceived as harmless and therefore permissible to ignore. Unlike PV, SV is not perceived to be as worthy of media coverage. The relative lack of commentator interest is indicative of the lack of ""glamour"" of SV in the NBA league. It is suggested that since viewers of professional sports often emulate the players, the increase of SV within the NBA is likely to be mirrored in fans in their everyday lives and in amateur basketball players. Although the rise in SV causes fewer physical injuries in professional basketball players, it nevertheless can cause psychological harm."
