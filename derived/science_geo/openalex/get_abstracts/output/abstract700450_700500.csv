https://openalex.org/W4295442856,"Abstract In an ongoing, open-label, single-arm phase II study ( NCT02927301 ), 181 patients with untreated, resectable, stage IB–IIIB non-small cell lung cancer received two doses of neoadjuvant atezolizumab monotherapy. The primary end point was major pathological response (MPR; ≤10% viable malignant cells) in resected tumors without EGFR or ALK alterations. Of the 143 patients in the primary end point analysis, the MPR was 20% (95% confidence interval, 14–28%). With a minimum duration of follow-up of 3 years, the 3-year survival rate of 80% was encouraging. The most common adverse events during the neoadjuvant phase were fatigue (39%, 71 of 181) and procedural pain (29%, 53 of 181), along with expected immune-related toxicities; there were no unexpected safety signals. In exploratory analyses, MPR was predicted using the pre-treatment peripheral blood immunophenotype based on 14 immune cell subsets. Immune cell subsets predictive of MPR in the peripheral blood were also identified in the tumor microenvironment and were associated with MPR. This study of neoadjuvant atezolizumab in a large cohort of patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer was safe and met its primary end point of MPR ≥ 15%. Data from this single-arm, non-randomized trial suggest that profiles of innate immune cells in pre-treatment peripheral blood may predict pathological response after neoadjuvant atezolizumab, but additional studies are needed to determine whether these profiles can inform patient selection and new therapeutic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W4295512323,"Approximately 60% of patients with large B cell lymphoma treated with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies targeting CD19 experience disease progression, and neurotoxicity remains a challenge. Biomarkers associated with resistance and toxicity are limited. In this study, single-cell proteomic profiling of circulating CAR T cells in 32 patients treated with CD19-CAR identified that CD4+Helios+ CAR T cells on day 7 after infusion are associated with progressive disease and less severe neurotoxicity. Deep profiling demonstrated that this population is non-clonal and manifests hallmark features of T regulatory (TReg) cells. Validation cohort analysis upheld the link between higher CAR TReg cells with clinical progression and less severe neurotoxicity. A model combining expansion of this subset with lactate dehydrogenase levels, as a surrogate for tumor burden, was superior for predicting durable clinical response compared to models relying on each feature alone. These data credential CAR TReg cell expansion as a novel biomarker of response and toxicity after CAR T cell therapy and raise the prospect that this subset may regulate CAR T cell responses in humans."
https://openalex.org/W4295454080,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has revolutionized the treatment of hematologic malignancies. Approximately half of patients with refractory large B cell lymphomas achieve durable responses from CD19-targeting CAR-T treatment; however, failure mechanisms are identified in only a fraction of cases. To gain new insights into the basis of clinical response, we performed single-cell transcriptome sequencing of 105 pretreatment and post-treatment peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples, and infusion products collected from 32 individuals with large B cell lymphoma treated with either of two CD19 CAR-T products: axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) or tisagenlecleucel (tisa-cel). Expansion of proliferative memory-like CD8 clones was a hallmark of tisa-cel response, whereas axi-cel responders displayed more heterogeneous populations. Elevations in CAR-T regulatory cells among nonresponders to axi-cel were detected, and these populations were capable of suppressing conventional CAR-T cell expansion and driving late relapses in an in vivo model. Our analyses reveal the temporal dynamics of effective responses to CAR-T therapy, the distinct molecular phenotypes of CAR-T cells with differing designs, and the capacity for even small increases in CAR-T regulatory cells to drive relapse."

https://openalex.org/W4295513184,"Anti-BRAF/EGFR therapy was recently approved for the treatment of metastatic BRAFV600E colorectal cancer (mCRCBRAF-V600E). However, a large fraction of patients do not respond, underscoring the need to identify molecular determinants of treatment response. Using whole-exome sequencing in a discovery cohort of patients with mCRCBRAF-V600E treated with anti-BRAF/EGFR therapy, we found that inactivating mutations in RNF43, a negative regulator of WNT, predict improved response rates and survival outcomes in patients with microsatellite-stable (MSS) tumors. Analysis of an independent validation cohort confirmed the relevance of RNF43 mutations to predicting clinical benefit (72.7% versus 30.8%; P = 0.03), as well as longer progression-free survival (hazard ratio (HR), 0.30; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.12-0.75; P = 0.01) and overall survival (HR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.10-0.71; P = 0.008), in patients with MSS-RNF43mutated versus MSS-RNF43wild-type tumors. Microsatellite-instable tumors invariably carried a wild-type-like RNF43 genotype encoding p.G659fs and presented an intermediate response profile. We found no association of RNF43 mutations with patient outcomes in a control cohort of patients with MSS-mCRCBRAF-V600E tumors not exposed to anti-BRAF targeted therapies. Overall, our findings suggest a cross-talk between the MAPK and WNT pathways that may modulate the antitumor activity of anti-BRAF/EGFR therapy and uncover predictive biomarkers to optimize the clinical management of these patients."

https://openalex.org/W4295441641,"Coming up with sustainable sources of electricity is one of the grand challenges of this century. The research field of materials for energy harvesting stems from this motivation, including thermoelectrics1, photovoltaics2 and thermophotovoltaics3. Pyroelectric materials, converting temperature periodic variations in electricity, have been considered as sensors4 and energy harvesters5-7, although we lack materials and devices able to harvest in the joule range. Here we develop a macroscopic thermal energy harvester made of 42 g of lead scandium tantalate in the form of multilayer capacitors that produces 11.2 J of electricity per thermodynamic cycle. Each pyroelectric module can generate up to 4.43 J cm-3 of electric energy density per cycle. We also show that two of these modules weighing 0.3 g are sufficient to sustainably supply an autonomous energy harvester embedding microcontrollers and temperature sensors. Finally, we show that for a 10 K temperature span these multilayer capacitors can reach 40% of Carnot efficiency. These performances stem from (1) a ferroelectric phase transition enabling large efficiency, (2) low leakage current preventing losses and (3) high breakdown voltage. These macroscopic, scalable and highly efficient pyroelectric energy harvesters enable the reconsideration of the production of electricity from heat."
https://openalex.org/W4295292877,"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), the most common form of kidney cancer, is typically initiated by inactivation of the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) gene, which results in the constitutive activation of the hypoxia inducible factors, HIF-1α and HIF-2α. Using a high throughput screen, we identify novel compounds that decrease HIF-1/2α levels and induce ferroptosis by targeting Iron Sulfur Cluster Assembly 2 (ISCA2), a component of the late mitochondrial Iron Sulfur Cluster (L-ISC) assembly complex. ISCA2 inhibition either pharmacologically or using siRNA decreases HIF-2α protein levels by blocking iron-responsive element (IRE)-dependent translation, and at higher concentrations, also decreases HIF-1α translation through unknown mechanisms. Additionally, ISCA2 inhibition triggers the iron starvation response, resulting in iron/metals overload and death via ferroptosis. ISCA2 levels are decreased in ccRCC compared to normal kidney, and decreased ISCA2 levels are associated with pVHL loss and with sensitivity to ferroptosis induced by ISCA2 inhibition. Strikingly, pharmacological inhibition of ISCA2 using an orally available ISCA2 inhibitor significantly reduced ccRCC xenograft growth in vivo, decreased HIF-α levels and increased lipid peroxidation, suggesting increased ferroptosis in vivo. Thus, the targeting of ISCA2 may be a promising therapeutic strategy to inhibit HIF-1/2α and to induce ferroptosis in pVHL deficient cells."
https://openalex.org/W4295511434,"The impact of genetic variation on overall disease burden has not been comprehensively evaluated. We introduce an approach to estimate the effect of genetic risk factors on disability-adjusted life years (DALYs; 'lost healthy life years'). We use genetic information from 735,748 individuals and consider 80 diseases. Rare variants had the highest effect on DALYs at the individual level. Among common variants, rs3798220 (LPA) had the strongest individual-level effect, with 1.18 DALYs from carrying 1 versus 0 copies. Being in the top 10% versus the bottom 90% of a polygenic score for multisite chronic pain had an effect of 3.63 DALYs. Some common variants had a population-level effect comparable to modifiable risk factors such as high sodium intake and low physical activity. Attributable DALYs vary between males and females for some genetic exposures. Genetic risk factors can explain a sizable number of healthy life years lost both at the individual and population level."
https://openalex.org/W4295428427,"Amino acid availability controls mTORC1 activity via a heterodimeric Rag GTPase complex that functions as a scaffold at the lysosomal surface, bringing together mTORC1 with its activators and effectors. Mammalian cells express four Rag proteins (RagA-D) that form dimers composed of RagA/B bound to RagC/D. Traditionally, the Rag paralogue pairs (RagA/B and RagC/D) are referred to as functionally redundant, with the four dimer combinations used interchangeably in most studies. Here, by using genetically modified cell lines that express single Rag heterodimers, we uncover a Rag dimer code that determines how amino acids regulate mTORC1. First, RagC/D differentially define the substrate specificity downstream of mTORC1, with RagD promoting phosphorylation of its lysosomal substrates TFEB/TFE3, while both Rags are involved in the phosphorylation of non-lysosomal substrates such as S6K. Mechanistically, RagD recruits mTORC1 more potently to lysosomes through increased affinity to the anchoring LAMTOR complex. Furthermore, RagA/B specify the signalling response to amino acid removal, with RagB-expressing cells maintaining lysosomal and active mTORC1 even upon starvation. Overall, our findings reveal key qualitative differences between Rag paralogues in the regulation of mTORC1, and underscore Rag gene duplication and diversification as a potentially impactful event in mammalian evolution."
https://openalex.org/W4295514438,"Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a relatively new class of antidiabetic drugs. Emerging findings from laboratory studies indicate that SGLT2 inhibitors can improve liver function and suppress the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors improves HCC prognosis in a human population.We used National Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked data in the United States to evaluate the role of SGLT2 inhibitor initiation on the survival of HCC patients. 3,185 HCC patients newly diagnosed between 2014 and 2017 aged 66 years or older with pre-existing type 2 diabetes were included and followed to the end of 2019. Information on SGLT2 inhibitor initiation was extracted from the Medicare Part D file.SGLT2 inhibitor initiation was associated with significantly lower mortality risk after adjusting for potential confounders (HR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.54-0.86) with stronger association for longer duration of use (HR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.41-0.88). Further, we found that SGLT2 inhibitor initiation was associated with a lower risk mortality risk ranging from 14% to 60% regardless of patient demographic variables, tumor characteristics, and cancer treatments.Our large SEER-Medicare linked data study indicates that SGLT2 inhibitor initiation was associated with improved overall survival of HCC patients with pre-existing type 2 diabetes compared with no SGLT2 inhibitor use. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings and elucidate the possible mechanisms behind the association."

https://openalex.org/W4295509638,"Abstract Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) senses nutrient availability to appropriately regulate cellular anabolism and catabolism. During nutrient restriction, different organs in an animal do not respond equally, with vital organs being relatively spared. This raises the possibility that mTORC1 is differentially regulated in different cell types, yet little is known about this mechanistically. The Rag GTPases, RagA or RagB bound to RagC or RagD, tether mTORC1 in a nutrient-dependent manner to lysosomes where mTORC1 becomes activated. Although the RagA and B paralogues were assumed to be functionally equivalent, we find here that the RagB isoforms, which are highly expressed in neurons, impart mTORC1 with resistance to nutrient starvation by inhibiting the RagA/B GTPase-activating protein GATOR1. We further show that high expression of RagB isoforms is observed in some tumours, revealing an alternative strategy by which cancer cells can retain elevated mTORC1 upon low nutrient availability."
https://openalex.org/W4295426738,"High rates of alcohol consumption by midlife women, despite the documented risks associated with breast cancer, varies according to social class. However, we know little about how to develop equitable messaging regarding breast cancer prevention that takes into consideration class differences in the receipt and use of such information.To explore the heuristics used by women with different (inequitable) life chances to determine the trustworthiness of information regarding alcohol as a modifiable risk factor for breast cancer risk.Interviews were conducted with 50 midlife (aged 45-64) women living in South Australia, diversified by self-reported alcohol consumption and social class. Women were asked to describe where they sought health information, how they accessed information specific to breast cancer risk as it relates to alcohol, and how they determined whether (or not) such information was trustworthy. De-identified transcripts were analysed following a three-step progressive method with the aim of identifying how women of varying life chances determine the trustworthiness of alcohol and breast cancer risk information. Three heuristics were used by women: (1) consideration of whose interests are being served; (2) engagement with 'common sense'; and (3) evaluating the credibility of the message and messenger. Embedded within each heuristic are notable class-based distinctions.More equitable provision of cancer prevention messaging might consider how social class shapes the reception and acceptance of risk information. Class should be considered in the development and tailoring of messages as the trustworthiness of organizations behind public health messaging cannot be assumed."
https://openalex.org/W4295138765,"The accumulation of misfolded proteins is a hallmark of aging and many neurodegenerative diseases, making it important to understand how the cellular machinery recognizes and processes such proteins. A key question in this respect is whether misfolded proteins are handled in a similar way regardless of their genetic origin. To approach this question, we compared how three different misfolded proteins, guk1-7, gus1-3, and pro3-1, are handled by the cell. We show that all three are nontoxic, even though highly overexpressed, highlighting their usefulness in analyzing the cellular response to misfolding in the absence of severe stress. We found significant differences between the aggregation and disaggregation behavior of the misfolded proteins. Specifically, gus1-3 formed some aggregates that did not efficiently recruit the protein disaggregase Hsp104 and did not colocalize with the other misfolded reporter proteins. Strikingly, while all three misfolded proteins generally coaggregated and colocalized to specific sites in the cell, disaggregation was notably different; the rate of aggregate clearance of pro3-1 was faster than that of the other misfolded proteins, and its clearance rate was not hindered when pro3-1 colocalized with a slowly resolved misfolded protein. Finally, we observed using super-resolution light microscopy as well as immunogold labeling EM in which both showed an even distribution of the different misfolded proteins within an inclusion, suggesting that misfolding characteristics and remodeling, rather than spatial compartmentalization, allows for differential clearance of these misfolding reporters residing in the same inclusion. Taken together, our results highlight how properties of misfolded proteins can significantly affect processing.

Maintenance of a functional proteome is crucial for longevity, reproductive capacity, and overall cellular fitness. An imbalance in protein homeostasis (proteostasis) is a hallmark of aging and linked to a number of age-related diseases (1Balch W.E. Morimoto R.I. Dillin A. Kelly J.W.

Proteostasis imbalance can result in aberrant proteins that disrupt cellular function by loss of function of the protein itself or by gain-of-toxic function, often associated with aberrant oligomers or aggregates that interfere with essential processes (6Balchin D. Hayer-Hartl M. Hartl F.U. In vivo aspects of protein folding and quality control.Science. 2016; 353: aac4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar, 7Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M.

A century-old debate on protein aggregation and neurodegeneration enters the clinic.Nature. 2006; 443: 774-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Therefore, cells rely on an intricate intracellular network of protein quality control (PQC) that maintains proteostasis and prevents proteotoxicity. The PQC system consists of two interrelated and evolutionary conserved systems, the temporal and the spatial PQC (10Hill S.M. Hanzén S. Nyström T. Restricted access: spatial sequestration of damaged proteins during stress and aging.EMBO Rep. 2017; 18: 377-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 11Josefson R. Andersson R. Nyström T. How and why do toxic conformers of aberrant proteins accumulate during ageing?.Essays Biochem. 2017; 61: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A large network of chaperones, cochaperones, and nucleotide exchange factors constitutes the temporal PQC involved in proper folding of nascent polypeptides, refolding of aberrant proteins, and degradation of proteins via the ubiquitin-proteasome and vacuole/autophagy pathways. In parallel, the spatial PQC recognizes oligomers/aggregates and mitigates their toxicity by sequestering them into larger protein inclusions and depositing them at distinct protective sites (12Escusa-Toret S.

To study the response of the spatial PQC pathways upon stress and aging, misfolded proteins need to be visualized and tracked in the cell. In S. cerevisiae, this typically involves the non-native expression of misfolding proteins tagged with a fluorophore to monitor aggregation and inclusion formation. A spectrum of reporters with different properties and genetic controls is available to test the responses of PQC pathways, as processing pathways can differ among reporters. In addition, investigating differences between reporters can reveal pathways active in specific cellular contexts or even uncover new pathways (10Hill S.M. Hanzén S. Nyström T.

A variety of reporters exists for S. cerevisiae, however, these reporters can harbor disadvantages for investigating PQC. They are often nonyeast proteins, may require additional treatments or changes in carbon sources for induction of expression which changes the physiology of the cell, they do not provide suitable nonmisfolding controls, or are toxic for the cells due to secondary effects of proteopathy (reviewed in (27Schneider K.L.

Temperature-sensitive (ts) alleles are especially convenient to use as misfolding reporters since aggregation is rapidly induced by temperature shift and it allows investigation of the response to unfolding proteins at or near physiological conditions. In this work, we used different ts alleles, with their corresponding WT alleles as controls, to establish nontoxic direct reporters for misfolding and aggregation that allow us to detect possible variations in the processing of misfolding proteins upon heat shock. We utilized three ts alleles, guk1-7, gus1-3, and pro3-1, whose mainly cytosolic protein products have reported differences in degradation behavior (34Comyn S.A. Young B.P. Loewen C.J. Mayor T.

We report on the behavior of the reporters with a focus on spatial PQC upon a mild heat shock and with differences especially in their clearance during both continuous heat shock as well as recovery at permissive temperature. Strikingly, we see that different reporter proteins are cleared at differential rates even when they are intermixed within the same aggregate/inclusion. The alleles of the three reporter genes are shown as domain representations in Figure 1A. Guk1 is a guanylate kinase that converts GMP to GDP (36Konrad M.

Gus1 is a well-conserved glutamyl-tRNA synthetase that forms a complex with Arc1 and Mes1 and is found in the cytoplasm but also in the nucleus and mitochondria (39Delarue M.

The intracellular location of two aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases depends on complex formation with Arc1p.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6889-6898Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Pro3 is a delta 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase involved in the proline biosynthesis pathway that is localized exclusively to the cytoplasm (42Brandriss M.C. Falvey D.A. Proline biosynthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: Analysis of the PRO3 gene, which encodes delta 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase.J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3782Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We integrated fluorescently tagged versions of these alleles all under the control of a strong GPD promoter, into the HIS3 locus, leaving the original WT loci intact (Fig. S1A). Thus, while the mutated reporters are ts, the strains are not with respect to growth. To demonstrate their suitability as misfolding reporter proteins, we determined whether our overexpressed constructs have any detectable toxic properties. We first tested whether overexpression of the fluorescently tagged proteins themselves cause dominant negative effects. We did not observe any differences in growth rate between the WT control BY4741, the overexpressed WT alleles GUK1-GFP, GUS1-GFP, PRO3-GFP, and the overexpressed ts alleles (Fig. S1B). Additionally, fitness was not affected at higher temperatures, where the ts alleles are induced to misfold (37 °C and 39 °C) (Fig. S1C). Even when inducing global protein misfolding using the proline analog azetidine-2-carboxylic acid (43Trotter E.W. Kao C.M.F. Berenfeld L. Botstein D. Petsko G.A. Gray J.V. Misfolded proteins are competent to mediate a subset of the responses to heat shock in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44817-44825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), overexpression of the misfolding reporters did not exhibit toxicity (Fig. S1D). We next examined whether any toxicity can be seen during replicative aging. Protein aggregates arise in old cells in many organisms and are connected to a decline in both temporal and spatial PQC in old cells (11Josefson R. Andersson R. Nyström T. How and why do toxic conformers of aberrant proteins accumulate during ageing?.Essays Biochem. 2017; 61: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 44Andersson V. Hanzén S. Liu B. Molin M.

Liu B. Nyström T. Spatial sequestration and detoxification of Huntingtin by the ribosome quality control complex.eLife. 2016; 5: 11792Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Overloading the PQC continuously with expression of the misfolding reporters could therefore negatively affect lifespan. However, strains carrying the ts alleles and the corresponding WT alleles did not produce fewer daughters in comparison to BY4741 (Fig. S1E). We also tested whether these aggregates are asymmetrically inherited (23Erjavec N. Larsson L. Grantham J. Nyström T. Accelerated aging and failure to segregate damaged proteins in Sir2 mutants can be suppressed by overproducing the protein aggregation-remodeling factor Hsp104p.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2410-2421Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) and observed a similar degree of aggregate asymmetry among the reporters, which was comparable to the well-established aggregate marker Hsp104-GFP (Fig. S1F). Taken together, the experiments show that these reporters are not toxic and have no noticeable effects on cellular functions, which makes them ideal to monitor PQC and makes them useful alternatives to the established ts model misfolding protein, Ubc9-ts, which can be severely toxic to the cell when continuously overexpressed (45Oling D. Eisele F. Kvint K. Nystrom T. Opposing roles of Ubp3-dependent deubiquitination regulate replicative life span and heat resistance.EMBO J. 2014; 33: 747-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The aggregation propensities and dynamics of the ts reporters were tested by subjecting them to continuous heat shock (38 °C). Aggregation was compared to that of nonheat shocked cells (30 °C) as well as to their corresponding WT reporters, Guk1-GFP, Gus1-GFP, and Pro3-GFP (Fig. 1B). During continuous heat shock, all three ts alleles formed a large number of aggregates at the initial time point (15 min) whereas the WT versions did not (Fig. 1, B and C). The numbers of aggregates diminished throughout the time course, indicating that aggregates are coalescing into larger inclusions and/or are disaggregated, degraded, or refolded. The pro3-1-GFP aggregates were most rapidly cleared out of cells and showed fewer inclusions per cell than the other misfolding proteins after 90 min (Fig. 1C). Overall, aggregates of guk1-7 and gus1-3 appeared more difficult to clear for the cell. Consistent with this observation, pro3-1-GFP was the only protein that showed an entirely diffuse and cytoplasmic signal at 30 °C with no evidence of aggregation, while guk1-7 and gus1-3 aggregated to a small degree, even at 30 °C. We wondered whether the differences in protein aggregation arise because the misfolded proteins are sequestered into different compartments throughout heat shock. To approach this possibility, we monitored their colocalization in pairwise combinations of GFP- and mCherry-tagged variants of the misfolding reporters. After 90 min of heat shock, we observed mostly strong colocalization between all of them, showing that these misfolding proteins are mainly deposited at common PQC sites (Figs. 1D and S1G). In line with this, we also observed a high level of colocalization of the three reporters with the established misfolding reporter Ubc9-ts (Fig. S1H). Interestingly, gus1-3 formed a fraction of “additional” aggregates, which did not colocalize with guk1-7 or pro3-1. This indicates that guk1-7 and pro3-1 are targeted by the same PQC machineries, while handling of gus1-3 likely involves additional pathways (Figs. 1E and S1I). Our observation that pro3-1 appeared to be handled most efficiently with respect to aggregate clearance (Fig. 1C) lead us to further investigate whether aggregates formed by guk1-7, gus1-3, and pro3-1 differ in their propensity to be disaggregated. We therefore determined their rates of clearance after induction of aggregation for 60 min followed by subsequent recovery at 30 °C. Strikingly, the aggregated reporter proteins were cleared with markedly different efficiencies. While aggregates of pro3-1-GFP were eliminated most rapidly (Fig. 2A), guk1-7-GFP and gus1-3-GFP were cleared much less efficiently, even at a slower rate than endogenous protein aggregates detected by Hsp104. The slower clearance rate of guk1-7 and gus1-3 most likely explains why so many aggregates of these misfolding reporters remain in the cell at later time points during continuous heat shock (Fig. 1C). The variation in aggregate clearance of the misfolding reporters made us question whether they are differentially handled by the 26S proteasome, which is part of the temporal PQC responsible for protein degradation. We first observed that guk1-7-GFP is degraded most rapidly out of the three reporters when translation is shut off using cycloheximide (Fig. 2B). In accordance with a previous study (35Khosrow-Khavar F. Fang N.N. Ng A.H.M. Winget J.M. Comyn S.A. Mayor T. The yeast ubr1 ubiquitin ligase participates in a prominent pathway that targets cytosolic thermosensitive mutants for degradation.G3 (Bethesda). 2012; 2: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), we see stabilization of guk1-7-GFP and pro3-1-GFP upon 26S proteasome inhibition with MG132 treatment, but not of gus1-3-GFP, indicating that proteasome activity is not mainly responsible for gus1-3-GFP turnover. To complement chemical inhibition of the proteasome, we proceeded with genetic manipulations of transcriptional control factors of proteasome levels to investigate proteasomal degradation of the misfolding reporters (48Kruegel U. Robison B. Dange T. Kahlert G. Delaney J.R. Kotireddy S. et al.Elevated proteasome capacity extends replicative lifespan in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.PLoS Genet. 2011; 7: 1002253Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The transcription factor Rpn4 positively regulates expression of UPS-related target genes. Deletion of RPN4 therefore reduces proteasome levels. In the absence of stress, the E3 ubiquitin ligase Ubr2 ubiquitylates Rpn4 for degradation. Depleting cells of Ubr2 thus leads to stabilization of Rpn4 and thereby higher proteasome levels and proteasome capacity (48Kruegel U. Robison B. Dange T. Kahlert G. Delaney J.R. Kotireddy S. et al.Elevated proteasome capacity extends replicative lifespan in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.PLoS Genet. 2011; 7: 1002253Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We verified these effects by monitoring Rpn5 (a proteasomal subunit component) levels (Fig. S2A). Using this genetic system for the misfolding reporters, we show that the increased proteasome capacity in the ubr2Δ mutant did not accelerate degradation of the misfolding reporters during heat shock (Fig. 2C). However, reduced proteasome capacity achieved by the rpn4Δ mutation stabilized all three misfolding reporters during heat shock, even gus1-3-GFP, which could not be stabilized by MG132. Stabilization of gus1-3-GFP was surprising and this prompted us to test whether gus1-3 as well as the other misfolding proteins were ubiquitylated. Indeed, all three misfolding reporter proteins were ubiquitylated, even the WT Gus1-GFP and Pro3-GFP constructs (Fig. S2B). We therefore conclude that all three misfolding proteins may be targets of the proteasome, albeit to different degrees. However, elevated proteasome capacity does not in itself improve degradation of the reporters used, suggesting a bottleneck in other processes required for proteasomal degradation, for example, ubiquitylation. After confirming that the guk1-7 and pro3-1 proteins are degraded by the proteasome, we tested whether the genetic manipulations causing alterations in proteasome levels/capacity would affect aggregate levels during continuous heat shock with ongoing translation since the results may explain the differences observed in clearance and spatial handling of such aggregates. Mutations in UBR2 and RPN4 have previously been shown to affect aggregation of other reporters during different stresses (44Andersson V. Hanzén S. Liu B. Molin M. Nyström T. Enhancing protein disaggregation restores proteasome activity in aged cells.Aging (Albany NY). 2013; 5: 802-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 48Kruegel U. Robison B. Dange T. Kahlert G. Delaney J.R. Kotireddy S. et al.Elevated proteasome capacity extends replicative lifespan in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.PLoS Genet. 2011; 7: 1002253Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). An increase in proteasome levels caused by loss of UBR2 was unable to decrease aggregation of guk1-7-GFP and gus1-3-GFP occurring at 30 °C (Fig. 2, D and E). Furthermore, gus1-3-GFP aggregation during heat shock was not influenced by the ubr2Δ mutation. In contrast, for guk1-7-GFP, and more so for pro3-1-GFP, we observed a fas"

According to the health care standard of informed decision-making, a comparison of the benefits and harms of (not) having the vaccination would be required to inform undecided and skeptical people. To test evidence-based fact boxes, an established risk communication format, and to inform their development, we investigated their contribution to knowledge and evaluations of COVID-19 vaccines.We conducted four studies (1, 2, and 4 were population-wide surveys with N = 1,942 to N = 6,056): Study 1 assessed the relationship between vaccination knowledge and intentions in Germany over three months. Study 2 assessed respective information gaps and needs of the population in Germany. In parallel, an experiment (Study 3) with a mixed design (presentation formats; pre-post-comparison) assessed the effect of fact boxes on risk perceptions and fear, using a convenience sample (N = 719). Study 4 examined how effective two fact box formats are for informing vaccination intentions, with a mixed experimental design: between-subjects (presentation formats) and within-subjects (pre-post-comparison).Study 1 showed that vaccination knowledge and vaccination intentions increased between November 2020 and February 2021. Study 2 revealed objective information requirements and subjective information needs. Study 3 showed that the fact box format is effective in adjusting risk perceptions concerning COVID-19. Based on those results, fact boxes were revised and implemented with the help of a national health authority in Germany. Study 4 showed that simple fact boxes increase vaccination knowledge and positive evaluations in skeptics and undecideds.Fact boxes can inform COVID-19 vaccination intentions of undecided and skeptical people without threatening societal vaccination goals of the population."

Using a custom-built flume tank that mimics the oscillatory fluid flow over a shallow coral reef, we show that millimeter-scale benthic topography increases the settlement of slow-swimming coral larvae by an order of magnitude relative to flat substrates. Particle tracking velocimetry of flow fields revealed that millimeter-scale ridges introduced regions of flow recirculation that redirected larvae toward the substrate surface and decreased the local fluid speed, effectively increasing the window of time for larvae to settle. In agreement with experiments, computational fluid dynamics modeling and agent-based larval simulations also showed significantly higher settlement on ridged substrates. These findings highlight how physics-based substrate design can create new opportunities to increase larval recruitment for ecosystem restoration."
https://openalex.org/W4295425581,"Detrimental to individuals and society, online hateful messages have recently become a major social issue. Among them, one new type of hateful message, ""hateful meme"", has emerged and brought difficulties in traditional deep learning-based detection. Because hateful memes were formatted with both text captions and images to express users' intents, they cannot be accurately identified by singularly analyzing embedded text captions or images. In order to effectively detect a hateful meme, the algorithm must possess strong vision and language fusion capability. In this study, we move closer to this goal by feeding a triplet by stacking the visual features, object tags, and text features of memes generated by the object detection model named Visual features in Vision-Language (VinVl) and the optical character recognition (OCR) technology into a Transformer-based Vision-Language Pre-Training Model (VL-PTM) OSCAR+ to perform the cross-modal learning of memes. After fine-tuning and connecting to a random forest (RF) classifier, our model (OSCAR+RF) achieved an average accuracy and AUROC of 0.684 and 0.768, respectively, on the hateful meme detection task in a public test set, which was higher than the other eleven (11) published baselines. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that VL-PTMs with the addition of anchor points can improve the performance of deep learning-based detection of hateful memes by involving a more substantial alignment between the text caption and visual information."

Modern oxidoreductase enzymes employ differential binding between reduced and oxidized forms of redox cofactors to alter cofactor reduction potential and enhance the enzyme's catalytic capabilities. The utility of differential affinity has been underexplored as a chemical strategy for RNA. Here we show an RNA aptamer that preferentially binds oxidized forms of flavin over reduced forms and markedly shifts flavin reduction potential by -40 mV, similar to shifts for oxidoreductases. Nuclear magnetic resonance structural analysis revealed π-π and donor atom-π interactions between the aptamer and flavin that cause unfavorable contacts with the electron-rich reduced form, suggesting a mechanism by which the local environment of the RNA-binding pocket drives the observed shift in cofactor reduction potential. It seems likely that primordial RNAs could have used similar strategies in RNA world metabolisms."
https://openalex.org/W4295494344,"Aspergillus oryzae is widely used in industrial applications, which always encounter changes within multiple environmental conditions during fermentation, such as temperature stress. However, the molecular mechanisms by which A . oryzae protects against temperature stress have not been elucidated. Therefore, this study aimed to characterize the fermentative behavior, transcriptomic profiles, and metabolic changes of A . oryzae in response to temperature stress. Both low and high temperatures inhibited mycelial growth and conidial formation of A . oryzae . Transcriptomic analysis revealed that most differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were involved in sugar metabolism and lipid metabolism under temperature stress. Specifically, the DEGs in trehalose synthesis and starch metabolism were upregulated under low-temperature stress, while high temperatures inhibited the expression of genes involved in fructose, galactose, and glucose metabolism. Quantitative analysis of intracellular sugar further revealed that low temperature increased trehalose accumulation, while high temperature increased the contents of intracellular trehalose, galactose, and glucose, consistent with transcriptome analysis. In addition, most DEGs involved in lipid metabolism were significantly downregulated under low-temperature stress. Furthermore, the metabolomic analysis revealed that linoleic acid, triacylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphoribosyl were significantly decreased in response to low-temperature stress. These results increase our understanding of the coping mechanisms of A . oryzae in response to temperature stress, which lays the foundation for future improvements through genetic modification to enhance A . oryzae against extreme temperature stress."
https://openalex.org/W4295511589,"The Trail-Making-Test (TMT) is one of the most widely used neuropsychological tests for assessing executive functions, the brain functions underlying cognitively controlled thought and action. Obtaining a number of test scores at once, the TMT allows to characterize an assortment of executive functions efficiently. Critically, however, as most test scores are derived from test completion times, the scores only provide a summary measure of various cognitive control processes. To address this problem, we extended the TMT in two ways. First, using a computerized eye-tracking version of the TMT, we added specific eye movement measures that deliver a richer set of data with a higher degree of cognitive process specificity. Second, we included an experimental manipulation of a fundamental executive function, namely participants’ ability to emphasize speed or accuracy in task performance. Our study of healthy participants showed that eye movement measures differed between TMT conditions that are usually compared to assess the cognitive control process of alternating between task sets for action control. This demonstrates that eye movement measures are indeed sensitive to executive functions implicated in the TMT. Crucially, comparing performance under cognitive control sets of speed vs. accuracy emphasis revealed which test scores primarily varied due to this manipulation (e.g., trial duration, number of fixations), and which were still more sensitive to other differences between individuals (e.g., fixation duration, saccade amplitude). This provided an experimental construct validation of the test scores by distinguishing scores primarily reflecting the executive function of emphasizing speed vs. accuracy and those independent from it. In sum, both the inclusion of eye movement measures and of the experimental manipulation of executive functions in the TMT enabled a more specific interpretation of the TMT in terms of cognitive functions and mechanisms, which offers more precise diagnoses in clinical applications and basic research."
https://openalex.org/W4295136963,"Ovarian cycle is controlled by circulating levels of the steroid hormone 17-β-estradiol, which is predominantly synthesized by the granulosa cells (GCs) of ovarian follicles. Our earlier studies showed that unsaturated fatty acids (USFs) downregulate and saturated fatty acids (SFAs) upregulate estradiol production in GCs. However, it was unclear whether pituitary gonadotropins induce accumulation of free fatty acids (FFAs) in the follicular fluid since follicle-stimulating hormone induces and luteinizing hormone inhibits estradiol production in the mammalian ovary. Interestingly, we show here the gas chromatography analysis of follicular fluid revealed no differential accumulation of FFAs between pre- and post-luteinizing hormone surge follicles. We therefore wondered how estradiol production is regulated in the physiological context, as USFs and SFAs are mutually present in the follicular fluid. We thus performed in vitro primary GC cultures with palmitate, palmitoleate, stearate, oleate, linoleate, and alpha-linolenate, representing >80% of the FFA fraction in the follicular fluid, and analyzed 62 different cell culture conditions to understand the regulation of estradiol biosynthesis under diverse FFA combinations. Our analyses showed co-supplementation of SFAs with USFs rescued estradiol production by restoring gonadotropin receptors and aromatase, antagonizing the inhibitory effects of USFs. Furthermore, transcriptome data of oleic acid-treated GCs indicated USFs induce the ERK and Akt signaling pathways. We show SFAs inhibit USF-induced ERK1/2 and Akt activation, wherein ERK1/2 acts as a negative regulator of estradiol synthesis. We propose SFAs are vital components of the follicular fluid, without which gonadotropin signaling and the ovarian cycle would probably be shattered by USFs."

NY-ESO-1-specific TCR-T cells could efficiently eliminate AML cell lines (including U937, HL60, and Kasumi-1cells) and primary AML blasts in vitro by targeting the DAC-induced NY-ESO-1 expression. Moreover, the incubation of T cells with DAC during TCR transduction (designated as dTCR-T cells) could further enhance the anti-leukemia efficacy of TCR-T cells and increase the generation of memory-like phenotype. The combination of DAC with NY-ESO-1-specific dTCR-T cells showed a superior anti-tumor efficacy in vivo and prolonged the survival of an AML xenograft mouse model, with three out of five mice showing complete elimination of AML cells over 90 days. This outcome was correlated with enhanced expressions of IFN-γ and TNF-α, and an increased proportion of central memory T cells (CD45RO+CD62L+ and CD45RO+CCR7+).

Whereas, the interaction between ADIPOQ polymorphisms and environmental factors on the susceptibility of hypertension remained unclear. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship of ADIPOQ polymorphisms with hypertension risk and their interaction with lipid levels in coal miners.A matched case-control study with 296 case-control pairs was performed in a large coal mining group located in North China. The participants were questioned by trained interviewers, and their ADIPOQ genotype and lipid levels were determined. Logistic regression, stratified analysis, and crossover analysis were applied to evaluate the effects of rs2241766, rs1501299, and rs266729 genotypes and gene-lipid interaction on hypertension risk.In this matched case-control study, the genotypes of rs2241766 TG+GG, rs1501299 GT+TT, and rs266729 CG+GG were marginally related to hypertension risk. Individuals with high total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level were susceptible to hypertension (TC: odds ratio [OR] = 1.807, 95% confidence intervals [95%CI] = 1.266-2.581; LDL-C: OR = 1.981, 95%CI = 1.400-2.803; HDL-C: OR = 1.559, 95%CI = 1.093-2.223). Antagonistic interactions were detected between rs2241766 and TC, rs1501299 and TC, rs2241766 and LDL-C, and rs1501299 and HDL-C (rs2241766 and TC: OR = 0.393, 95%CI = 0.191-0.806; rs1501299 and TC: OR = 0.445, 95%CI = 0.216-0.918; rs2241766 and LDL-C: OR = 0.440, 95%CI = 0.221-0.877; rs1501299 and HDL-C: OR = 0.479, 95%CI = 0.237-0.967).

At first, Pearson’s Chi-square test was conducted to measure the association between outcome and predictor variables. Multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify the factors associated with utilization of health services. Overall, about 59 percent of the mother received health services from unqualified doctors during their children’s illness and the rest of them (41.5%) seek care from the qualified doctors. Results of regression analysis revealed that long duration of illness (AOR = 2.338; CI: 1.175–4.649; p = 0.015), the severity of illness (AOR = 6.402; CI: 3.275–12.513; p &lt;0.001), and higher cost of treatment (AOR = 7.371; CI: 3.297–16.480; p &lt;0.001) were the significant predictors of utilization of health services from the qualified doctors for under-five children.

This study explored the acceptability and usefulness of a SAR caregiver respite program responsive to feedback from both young adults with IDD and their older family caregivers (age 55+).Young adults with IDD and caregiver dyads (N = 11) were recruited. A mixed methods research design was deployed in three phases: Phase I with four focus groups to inform the program design; Phase II for program demonstration and evaluation with pre- and post-surveys; and Phase III with post-program interviews for feedback and suggestions.Both young adults with IDD and their caregivers scored favorably the social presence of, social engagement, and satisfaction with robot Pepper. Though there was no significant improvement of caregiving burden/stress as well as well-being of the young adults with IDD based on surveys, results from interviews suggested that the SAR may offer physical/emotional respite to caregivers by providing companionship/friendship as well as promoting independence, safety/monitoring, and interactive engagement with children.SAR has potential in providing respite for older family caregivers. Future studies need a longer program design and larger sample size to develop a promising intervention and test its feasibility and efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W4295138798,"The WNT-β-catenin signaling pathway has a major role in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation. Aberrant activation of the pathway contributes to various human cancer types. Because casein kinase CK1α-initiated phosphorylation of β-catenin is a key first step to restrain WNT signaling, effective restoration of CK1α activity represents an innovative strategy to combat WNT-driven cancer. A recent study in JBC reveals the anthelmintic pyrvinium directly binds to CK1α as an activator and also stabilizes CK1α protein, doubling against WNT-driven cancer activity."
https://openalex.org/W4295338581,"Reproductive success in mice depends on sexually dimorphic major urinary proteins (Mup) that facilitate interactions between females and males. Deletion of cystathionine β-synthase (Cbs) gene, a metabolic gene important for homeostasis of one-carbon metabolism, impairs reproduction by causing female infertility in mice. Here, we examined Mup biogenesis and sexual signaling in Cbs-/- versus Cbs+/- mice. We found significantly reduced levels of total urinary Mup protein in male and female Cbs-/- versus Cbs+/- mice. SDS-PAGE/Western blot, ESI-MS, and RT-qPCR analyses of the liver, plasma, and urinary proteins identified a male-specific Mup20 in Cbs-/- , but not in Cbs+/- females. The 18 893 Da Mup20 became the most abundant in urine of Cbs-/- females and males. Effects of Cbs genotype on 18 645 Da, 18 693 Da, and 18 709 Da Mup species abundance were Mup- and sex-specific. Cbs genotype-dependent changes in hepatic Mups and Mup20 expression were similar at the protein and mRNA level. Changes in Mups, but not in Mup20, can be explained by downregulation of hepatic Zhx2 and Ghr receptors in Cbs-/- mice. Behavioral testing showed that Cbs+/- females ignored Cbs-/- male urine but were attracted to Cbs+/- male urine. Cbs+/- males ignored urine of Cbs-/- males but countermarked urine of other Cbs+/- males and were attracted to urines of Cbs-/- as well as Cbs+/- females. Cbs-/- males did not countermark urine of Cbs+/- males but were attracted to urines of Cbs+/- females. Taken together, these findings show that Cbs, a metabolic gene, interacts with the processes involved in Mup biogenesis that are essential for the maintenance of sexual dimorphism and signaling and suggest that dysregulation of these interactions impairs reproductive fitness in mice."
https://openalex.org/W4295366818,"Wnt11 regulates early cardiac development and left ventricular compaction in the heart, but it is not known how Wnt11 regulates postnatal cardiac maturation and response to cardiac stress in the adult heart. We studied cell proliferation/maturation in postnatal and adolescent Wnt11 deficient (Wnt11-/-) heart and subjected adult mice with partial (Wnt11+/-) and complete Wnt11 (Wnt11-/-) deficiency to cardiac pressure overload. In addition, we subjected primary cardiomyocytes to recombinant Wnt proteins to study their effect on cardiomyocyte growth. Wnt11 deficiency did not affect cardiomyocyte proliferation or maturation in the postnatal or adolescent heart. However, Wnt11 deficiency led to enlarged heart phenotype that was not accompanied by significant hypertrophy of individual cardiomyocytes. Analysis of stressed adult hearts from wild-type mice showed a progressive decrease in Wnt11 expression in response to pressure overload. When studied in experimental cardiac pressure overload, Wnt11 deficiency did not exacerbate cardiac hypertrophy or remodeling and cardiac function remained identical between the genotypes. When subjecting cardiomyocytes to hypertrophic stimulus, the presence of recombinant Wnt11 together with Wnt5a reduced protein synthesis. In conclusion, Wnt11 deficiency does not affect postnatal cardiomyocyte proliferation but leads to cardiac growth. Interestingly, Wnt11 deficiency alone does not substantially modulate hypertrophic response to pressure overload in vivo. Wnt11 may require cooperation with other noncanonical Wnt proteins to regulate hypertrophic response under stress."
https://openalex.org/W4295367038,"Clinical unpredictability and variability following fat grafting remain non-negligible problems due to the unknown mechanism of grafted fat retention. The role of the extracellular matrix (ECM), which renders cells with structural and biochemical support, has been ignored. This study aimed to clarify the ECM remodeling process, related cellular events, and the spatiotemporal relationship between ECM remodeling and adipocyte survival and adipogenesis after fat grafting. Labeled Coleman fat by the matrix-tracing technique was grafted in nude mice. The ECM remodeling process and cellular events were assessed in vivo. The related cytokines were evaluated by qRT-PCR. An in vitro cell migration assay was performed to verify the chemotactic effect of M2-like macrophages on fibroblasts. The results demonstrated that in the periphery, most of the adipocytes of the graft survived or regenerated, and the graft-derived ECM was gradually replaced by the newly-formed ECM. In the central parts, most adipocytes in the grafts died shortly after, and a small part of the graft-derived and newly-formed ECM was expressed with irregular morphology. Adipose ECM remodeling is associated with increased infiltration of macrophages and fibroblasts, as well as up-regulated expression of cytokines in the adipose tissue. To sum up, our results describe the various preservation mode of fat grafts after transplantation and underscore the importance of macrophage-mediated ECM remodeling in graft preservation after fat grafting. The appreciation and manipulation of underlying mechanisms that are operant in this setting stand to explore new therapeutic approaches and improve clinical outcomes of fat grafting."

Some studies have reported medicinal plants having antibacterial activity against pathogenic bacteria. However, antibacterial studies of medicinal plants against S . pneumoniae remains limited. Therefore, this study aims to describe the antibacterial activity of medicinal plants in Indonesia against S . pneumoniae . Medicinal plants were extracted by maceration with n-hexane, ethanol, ethyl acetate and water. Antibacterial activity was defined by inhibition zone and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Bactericidal activity was measured by culture and time-killing measurement. Methods used to describe the mechanism of action of the strongest extract were done by absorbance at 595 nm, broth culture combined with 1% crystal violet, qRT-PCR targeting lytA , peZT and peZA , and transmission electron microscope to measure bacterial lysis, antibiofilm, LytA and peZAT gene expression, and ultrastructure changes respectively. Among 13 medicinal plants, L . inermis Linn. ethyl acetate extract showed the strongest antibacterial activity against S . pneumoniae with an MIC value of 0,16 mg/ml. Bactericidal activity was observed at 0,16 mg/ml for 1 hour incubation. Lawsonia inermis extract showed some mechanism of actions including bacterial lysis, antibiofilm, and ultrastructure changes such as cell wall disruption, decreasing cell membrane integrity and morphological disorder. Increasing of lytA and decreasing of peZA and peZT expression were also observed after incubation with the extract. In addition, liquid chromatography mass spectrophotometer showed phenolic compounds as the commonest compound in L . inermis ethyl acetate extract. This study describes the strong antibacterial activity of L . inermis with various mechanism of action including ultrastructure changes."
https://openalex.org/W4295431585,"As a vital element of early shape exploration, divergence can be time-consuming and challenging, with iterative cycles where idea fixation and creative blocks must be overcome for fuzzy ideas to be fully expanded and understood. Despite interesting tools that have been developed for this purpose, some important challenges remain, as it appears that many designers still prefer simple freehand sketching and tend to defer the use of computational tools to later stages. This work presents an exploratory assessment of the perceived value of a new tool, Shapi, developed to assist early shape exploration by addressing some of the pitfalls reported in the literature. Shapi is envisioned as an autonomous assistant that provides local and global shape variations in the form of rough sketches based on an initial human sketch and interactive cycles. These shape variations are What-If scenarios and cognitive facilitators that may spark new ideas or enable a deeper understanding of the shape and the identification of interesting patterns. Shapi's capabilities are explored in a diverse set of case studies with different purposes: nine implementations in industrial design, three in graphic design, and five with open-ended artistic purposes. These implementations are then used in a survey about initial perceived value in which the majority gave high ratings in terms of exploration (75.5% ≥ 4 out of 5), interpretation (83.7% ≥ 4), adaptation (77.6% ≥ 4), value (73.5% ≥ 4), creativity (69.4% ≥ 4), and general interest in the tool (79.6% ≥ 4).

https://openalex.org/W4295459378,"Stigmatization of COVID-19 disease has been speculated due to misinformation about the disease, fearing of contracting the infection, absence of available cure, and holding responsibility for infecting others. We aimed to establish the prevalence of COVID-19 related stigma and its association with empathic responding, in addition to exploring predictors of stigma and testing intention among Jordanian people. A quantitative, descriptive and predictive design was used and data were collected using a web-based survey from 1074 adults. Findings showed that participants had high stigmatization against COVID-19 infection. Higher empathic responding (both cognitive and affective), being a female participant, and older age resulted in higher stigmatization. Only stigmatization of COVID-19 negatively predicted individuals' intention for testing. These findings warrant intensive efforts from the Jordanian government on a local and national level to provide ongoing public education related to several aspects of COVID-19 disease, in order to reduce or prevent the associated stigma and increase people's intention for testing."

Methods Nine 3 × 3 mm macular optical coherence tomography angiography images were acquired in patients with PPE and age-matched healthy participants. Multiple en face image averaging of the choriocapillaris was binarized for quantitative image analysis of the flow voids. In PPE eyes, we evaluated the presence of pachyvessels and the association between the location of the choriocapillaris flow deficit and pachyvessels. Results Thirty-two eyes with PPE and 30 eyes of healthy participants were included. In PPE eyes, the mean total area (1.16 ± 0.18 vs. 0.91 ± 0.16, p &lt; 0.001) and average size of the flow voids (790 ± 144 vs. 520 ± 138; p &lt; 0.001) were significantly larger than those in control eyes. Composite images of the choriocapillaris and choroid showed choriocapillaris flow deficits just above and outside the pachyvessels. The mean proportion of the flow void area overlying the pachyvessels against the whole flow void area of the choriocapillaris was 21.3% ± 10.2% (9.38%-44.42%) in PPE eyes. Conclusions In PPE eyes, the blood flow area of the choriocapillaris decreased diffusely within the macular area compared to control eyes, and the choriocapillaris flow deficit was not necessarily related to pachyvessel location."
https://openalex.org/W4295514441,"Nurses are the main caregivers of dying patients. Facing or dealing with death-related events is inevitable. Death-coping self-efficacy (DCS) is very important, as it can reduce the risk of nursing staff to adverse emotional distress, help them participate in end-of-life care and improve the quality of care of patients.Using the convenient sampling method, this study included a total of 572 nurses from a tertiary hospital in Hangzhou, China. The status and influencing factors of the DCS of nurses were explored using a general information questionnaire and DCS scale.The scores of each parameter, ranging from low to high, were in the order of coping with grief, preparation for death and hospice care. Factors influencing nurses' DCS included attendance in hospice care education courses within the previous year, experience of accompanying the family members of the deceased and attitude towards death.The overall self-efficacy of nurses in palliative care was at a medium level. Moreover, their self-efficacy in coping with grief and preparation for death should be strengthened. Managers of medical institutions can assess the death-coping ability of nurses, which helps provide corresponding support and training for nurses at an early stage. Nurses should receive guidance in grief adjustment and emotion regulation. Medical units should provide nurses with a platform for continuous training and education, use of death-related theoretical models and frameworks to guide nurses in dealing with death-related events, reduce nurses' negative mood and jointly promote their mental health."

https://openalex.org/W4295428420,"Background Routine laboratory investigations are not rapidly available to assist clinicians in the diagnosis of pediatric acute infections. Our objective was to evaluate some common blood parameters and use them for the differential diagnosis of childhood infections. Methods This retrospective study was conducted between October 2019 and September 2020 at Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center, China. We performed blood tests in patients infected with DNA viruses (n = 402), RNA viruses (n = 602), gram-positive organisms (G+; n = 421), gram-negative organisms (G−; n = 613), or Mycoplasma pneumoniae (n = 387), as well as in children without infection (n = 277). The diagnostic utility of blood parameters to diagnose various infections was evaluated by logistic regression analysis. Results The most common G+ organism, G− organism, and virus were Streptococcus pneumoniae (39.7%), Salmonella typhimurium (18.9%), and influenza A virus (40.2%), respectively. The value of logit ( P ) = 0.003 × C-reactive protein (CRP) − 0.011 × hemoglobin (HGB) + 0.001 × platelets (PLT) was significantly different between the control, RNA virus, DNA virus, M . pneumoniae , G− organism, and G+ organism groups (2.46 [95% CI, 2.41–2.52], 2.60 [2.58–2.62], 2.70 [2.67–2.72], 2.78 [2.76–2.81], 2.88 [2.85–2.91], and 2.97 [2.93–3.00], respectively; p = 0.00 for all). The logistic regression‐based model showed significantly greater accuracy than the best single discriminatory marker for each group (logit [ P infection ] vs. CRP, 0.90 vs. 0.84, respectively; logit [ P RNA ] vs. lymphocytes, 0.83 vs. 0.77, respectively; p = 0.00). The area under curve values were 0.72 (0.70–0.74) for HGB and 0.81 (0.79–0.82) for logit ( P virus/bacteria ) to diagnose bacterial infections, whereas they were 0.72 (0.68–0.74) for eosinophils and 0.80 (0.78–0.82) for logit ( P virus/bacteria ) to diagnose viral infections. Logit ( P virus/bacteria ) &lt; −0.45 discriminated bacterial from viral infection with 78.9% specificity and 70.7% sensitivity. Conclusions The combination of CRP, HGB, PLT, eosinophil, monocyte, and lymphocyte counts can distinguish between the infectious pathogens in children."
https://openalex.org/W4295429706,"Background Reliable physical activity measurements in community-dwelling older adults are important to determine effects of targeted health promotion interventions. Many exercise interventions aim to improve time spent sedentary (SED), in light-intensity-physical-activity (LPA) and moderate-to-vigorous-intensity-physical-activity (MVPA), since these parameters have independently proposed associations with health and longevity. However, many previous studies rely on self-reports which have lower validity compared to accelerometer measured physical activity patterns. In addition, separating intervention-effects from reactivity measurements requires sufficient test-retest reliability for accelerometer assessments, which is lacking in older adults. Objectives The study objective was to investigate the reliability of sensor-based PA-patterns in community-dwelling older adults. Furthermore, to investigate change over time of physical activity patterns and examine any compensatory-effect from the eight-week supervised exercise-intervention. Methods An exercise-group (n = 78, age-range:65-91yrs) performed two 1h-exercise sessions/week during eight-weeks. PA-pattern was assessed (using hip-worn accelerometers), twice before and once during the last-week of the intervention. A control-group (n = 43, age-range:65-88yrs) performed one pre-test and the end-test with no exercise-intervention. A dependent-t-test, mean-difference (95%-CI), limits-of-agreement and intraclass-correlation-coefficient-ICC were used between the two pre-tests. Repeated-measures-ANOVA were used to analyze any intervention-effects. Results The exercise-groups´ two pre-tests showed generally no systematic change in any PA- or SED-parameter (ICC ranged 0.75–0.90). Compared to the control group, the exercise intervention significantly (time x group-interaction, p&lt;0.05) increased total-PA-cpm (exercise-group/control-group +17%/+7%) and MVPA-min/week (+41/-2min) and decreased %-of-wear-time for SED-total (-4.7%/-2.7%) and SED-bouts (-5.7%/-1.8%), and SED-bouts min/d (-46/-16min). At baseline level, no significant differences were found between the two groups for any parameter. Conclusions The current study presents a good test-retest-reliability of sensor-based-one-week-assessed-PA-pattern in older-adults. Participating in an 8-week supervised exercise intervention improved some physical activity and sedentary parameters compared to the control group. No compensatory-effect was noted in the intervention-group i.e., no decrease in any PA-parameter or increase in SED at End-test (in %-of-wear-time, min/day or total-PA)."
https://openalex.org/W4295430127,"Diabetic kidney disease is one of the long-term microvascular complications of diabetes. Doubling of serum creatinine is an important biomarker and predictor of diabetic kidney disease for patients with diabetes. This study aimed to determine the time in which the serum creatinine level is doubled measured from the baseline in patients with diabetes in Ethiopian University Hospital.Analysis of the patients with diabetes medical records was employed retrospectively for five years from 2016 to 2020 in the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital. The Kaplan-Meier procedure was used to predict the time to which the serum creatinine level was doubled measured from the baseline value, while the Log-rank test and cox-proportional hazard regression models were employed to show significant serum creatinine (SCr) changes against the predictor variables.Among the total of 387 patients with diabetes, 54.5% were females with a mean age of 61.1±10.3 years. After 5-years of retrospective follow-up, 10.3% of patients with diabetes had doubled their serum creatinine level computed from the baseline values. The baseline and last SCr levels (measured in mg/dL) were 0.87 (±0.23) and 1.0(±0.37), respectively. This resulted in a mean SCr difference of 0.12±0.38 mg/dL. The SCr score was continuously increasing uninterruptedly for five years and measured as 0.94, 0.95, 0.94, 1 and 1.03 mg/dL, respectively. The average survival time taken for the serum creatinine to be doubled computed from baseline was 55.4 months (4.6 years). Patients treated with greater than or equal to 30 IU NPH were found 3.3 times more likely to have higher risks of doubling the serum creatinine level (DSC); with HR of 3.29 [(95%CI); 1.28-8.44: P = 0.013].Compared with the baseline level, a significant proportion of patients with diabetes were found to have doubling of serum creatinine DSC within less than five years around four and half years. A continuous increasing in the SCr level was noted when measured from the baseline scores. Therefore, to preserve the renal function of patients with diabetes, close SCr level monitoring and regular follow-up would be recommended in combined with effective therapeutic interventions."

Methods Research databases, including Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cochrane Public Health Register, PubMed/MEDLINE, SCOPUS, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of science, and Google Scholar, will be searched using a search strategy and keywords developed in collaboration with librarians. The review will include all field and community trials and observational studies in all population groups. Searching electronic databases, study selection, and data extraction will be conducted by two researchers independently. Four critical appraisal tools will be used to assess the quality of included studies according to the study design: The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Prevalence Critical Appraisal tool, the JBI critical appraisal checklist for randomized control/pseudo-randomized trial, descriptive/case series, and comparable cohort/case-control. These tools were initially designed for use in systematic reviews. A narrative synthesis will be implemented to summarize findings if meta-analyses are not appropriate. Discussion The current systematic review results can be used to predict the effect of COVID-19 on the individuals’ and households’ food security, especially in vulnerable populations, and develop effective interventions. This review can provide information for policymakers to better understand the factors influencing the implementation of these interventions and inform decision-making to improve food security.

https://openalex.org/W4295478657,"This study aimed to investigate the nature of a specific body manipulation named Suichoku-Ririku (SR) in Japanese martial arts. SR is regarded as a method to change the way of stance and to distort the balance control of the opponent, but its nature and mechanism are unknown. In the present study, we attempted to determine the effect of SR in the cases that a person stood alone (Expt. 1) and that two persons stood in contact (Expt. 2). We compared several center of pressure (COP) measures between the normal stance and SR stance conditions. When participants stood independently (Expt. 1), the COP path length, standard deviation of COP velocity and permutation entropy of the COP increased with the SR stance, which suggested that the SR maneuver destabilized a quiet stance. When two participants stood (with normal stance) in contact by wrist-holding or by a light touch (Expt. 2), their COP motions were correlated with each other, as previously reported. When one of the participants took the SR maneuver, their correlation and mutual information were maintained, denying the view that SR would diminish the interpersonal correlation of body sway. On the other hand, a fluctuation in the COP increased only for the participant taking the SR maneuver, and not for the other participant. This asymmetric effect of the SR maneuver between two participants, irrespective of maintained mutual correlation, suggest that the relationship between balance controls of two participants was partly disrupted. We discuss possible mechanisms for the present results."
https://openalex.org/W4295478816,"The average sowing date of crops in temperate climate zones has been shifted forwards by several days, resulting in a changed photoperiod regime at the emergence stage. In the present study, we performed a global transcriptome profiling of plant development genes in the seedling stage of root and shoot apical meristems of a photoperiod-sensitive species (barley) and a photoperiod insensitive species (tomato) in short-day conditions (8h). Variant expression indicated differences in physiological development under this short day-length regime between species and tissues. The barley tissue transcriptome revealed reduced differentiation compared to tomato. In addition, decreased photosynthetic activity was observed in barley transcriptome and leaf chlorophyll content under 8h conditions, indicating a slower physiological development of shoot meristems than in tomatoes. The photomorphogenesis controlling cryptochrome gene cry1 , with an effect on physiological differentiation, showed an underexpression in barley compared to tomato shoot meristems. This might lead to a cascade of suspended sink-source activities, which ultimately delay organ development and differentiation in barley shoot meristems under short photoperiods."
https://openalex.org/W4295501007,"The use of humanized mouse models for oncology is rapidly expanding. Autologous patient-derived systems are particularly attractive as they can model the human cancer’s heterogeneity and immune microenvironment. In this study, we developed an autologous humanized mouse cancer model by engrafting NSG mice with patient-derived xenografts and infused matched peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We first defined the time course of xenogeneic graft-versus-host-disease (xGVHD) and determined that only minimal xGVHD was observed for up to 8 weeks. Next, colorectal and pancreatic cancer patient-derived xenograft bearing NSG mice were infused with 5x10 6 human PBMCS for development of the humanized cancer models (iPDX). Early after infusion of human PBMCs, iPDX mice demonstrated engraftment of human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the blood of both colorectal and pancreatic cancer patient-derived models that persisted for up to 8 weeks. At the end of the experiment, iPDX xenografts maintained the features of the primary human tumor including tumor grade and cell type. The iPDX tumors demonstrated infiltration of human CD3+ cells with high PD-1 expression although we observed significant intra and inter- model variability. In summary, the iPDX models reproduced key features of the corresponding human tumor. The observed variability and high PD-1 expression are important considerations that need to be addressed in order to develop a reproducible model system."

Analyses were conducted on a 7-item version (PDI-J) and a 5-item (PDI-5-J version of the PDI). Using a web-based survey system, we recruited 300 individuals with chronic low back pain (lasting ≥3 months) and 300 individuals with chronic daily headache (lasting ≥15 days per month for 3 months) aged 20–64 years. Analyses revealed a one-factor with goodness-of-fit indices assessed by confirmatory factor analysis. For concurrent validity, we calculated Pearson’s correlation coefficients among the PDI-J, PDI-5-J, Pain Disability Assessment Scale, Pain numerical rating scale, and revised version of Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire. Internal consistency was evaluated by Cronbach’s α, and test–retest reliability was assessed with intraclass correlations (ICCs) in 100 of 600 participants a week after the first response. Both Japanese adaptations of the PDI demonstrated good concurrent validity and reliability (Cronbach’s α was 0.89 for PDI-J in chronic low back pain or chronic daily headache, and 0.94 and 0.93 for PDI-5-J in chronic low back pain and chronic daily headache, respectively). The PDI-J and PDI-5-J showed were highly correlated (r = 0.98). ICCs were 0.67 and 0.59 for the PDI-J and 0.59 and 0.63 for the PDI-5-J in chronic low back pain and chronic daily headache, respectively. In conclusion, these two PDI versions can be potentially used for evaluating pain-related interference with daily activities among the Japanese general population."

https://openalex.org/W4295517202,"In this paper, we explore the role of perceived emotions and crisis communication strategies via organizational computer-mediated communication in predicting public anxiety, the default crisis emotion. We use a machine-learning approach to detect and predict anxiety scores in organizational crisis announcements on social media and the public's responses to these posts. We also control for emotional and language tones in organizational crisis responses using a separate machine learning algorithm. Perceived organizational anxiety positively influences public anxiety, confirming the occurrence of emotional contagion from the organization to the public. Crisis response strategies moderated this relationship, so that responsibility acknowledgment lowered public anxiety the most. We argue that by accounting for emotions expressed in organizational crisis responses, organizations may be able to better predict and manage public emotions."
