The enhanced binding is associated with an increased number of receptor sites with no change in their affinity."

The physicochemical properties and species specificity of the stimulatory agent fall within the present definition of IF.

https://openalex.org/W2040309284,"The synthesis and secretion of plasminogen activator by cultured macrophages can be induced and stimulated by concanavalin A and by phorbol myristate acetate, and inhibited by such agents as glucocorticoids, mitotic inhibitors and compounds affecting cAMP metabolism. By the manipulation of stimulatory and inhibitory influences, enzyme production can be modulated continuously over a 200 fold range. In the same way, the proportion of cells that secrete detectable levels of enzyme can be varied from 1–90%. No comparable modulation of lysozyme or acid hydrolase production is observed under the same conditions. These results suggest that the physiological control of macrophage plasminogen activator production is achieved by the interacting effects of mutually antagonistic stimuli; this emphasizes the utility of this enzyme for the study of regulatory phenomena, including those relating to inflammation."

https://openalex.org/W2055850665,"Abstract RNA extracted from TMV assembly nucleation complexes, prepared as described in the accompanying paper (Zimmern and Butler, 1977), is found to consist of a population of fragments of between 50 and 550 nucleotides chain length, in varying yield, containing neither terminus of the RNA in detectable amounts. The shortest fragments define a core about 100 residues long common to all the fragments, while larger ones are covalently extended by up to 400 nucleotides in one direction and up to 30 in the other. The most probable interpretation is that assembly nucleates at a unique internal site on the RNA, growth following bidirectionally but at greatly unequal rates. A nucleotide sequence of 149 residues around the assembly origin, as defined by the minimal sequence protected from nuclease digestion by encapsidation, has been almost completely determined. This sequence overlaps that of a partial digestion fragment of TMV RNA isolated and sequenced by Jonard et al. 1977. The sequencing data are consistent only with a 3′ to 5′ major direction of growth, contrary to expectation. Unusual features occur both within the sequence of the first disk binding site and elsewhere in the nucleation region; these may be involved in directing the binding and/or dislocation of up to three coat protein disks. The nucleotide sequence around the assembly origin is homologous to, but distinct from, part of the nucleotide sequence from the TMV coat protein gene, which has previously been shown to have unusual binding affinity for the disk aggregate of the coat protein. The assembly origin may itself have a dual role as a coding region within another gene. There is striking clustering of nucleotide residues that show homology between the assembly origin and the coat protein gene in those regions coding (in the coat gene) for conserved amino acids, although the protein sequences that may be translated from the two genes are dissimilar."
https://openalex.org/W2068298729,"Hybridization of labeled RNA with excess amounts of DNA complementary to globin mRNA, in conjunction with a pulse-chase technique, were used to investigate the biosynthetic pathway of globin mRNA in erythroid cells. Three species of molecules sharing common sequences with globin mRNA were detected in the nuclei of these cells, two of which are larger than the cytoplasmic globin mRNA. One species was approximately 7 times larger than globin mRNA (“27S”), and the other (“15S”) was only about twice the size of cytoplasmic globin mRNA. The largest species lacked poly(A) sequences, while the others contained poly(A). After chase, the large RNA species gradually disappeared (), while the cytoplasmic 10S species accumulated. From these results, a model is proposed describing the biosynthetic pathway of globin RNA transcription; an early transcription product is the large molecule “27S” (∼5000 nucleotides long) which is then cleaved into a smaller species “15S” (∼1500 nucleotides). This intermediate precursor is then clipped, presumably at the 5′ end, and finally converted to the exported “10S” molecule (∼750 nucleotides) which accumulates in the cytoplasm."

https://openalex.org/W1487072100,"The amino acid sequence of the unique COOH-terminal region of the beta subunit of human choriogonadotropin has been reinvestigated. The desialylated subunit was digested with thermolysin and a 27-residue peptide from positions 115 through 141 isolated in a high yield. Quantitative Edman sequence degradation of this peptide, of another peptide produced by thermolysin digestion containing residues 142 to 145, and of two tryptic peptides (residues 123 to 145, 134 to 145) has established that the amino acid sequence of this region is: (formula: see text). In addition, the positions of attachment of the carbohydrate moieties to serine residues was established by a direct procedure using alkaline elimination and 35S-labeled sulfite addition, which yields [35S]-cysteic acid residues at the site of a substituted serine. Carbohydrate side chains in the COOH-terminal region have been shown to exist at residues 121, 127, 132, and 138. These studies have also resulted in the development of improved methods for the purification of COOH-terminal peptides of the human choriogonadotropin beta subunit."

https://openalex.org/W2016891566,"Previous studies ( Varshavsky et al., 1976a Varshavsky A.J. Bakayev V.V. Georgiev G.P. Heterogeneity of chromatin subunits in vitro and location of histone H1. Nucl. Acids Res. 1976; 3: 477-492 Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar ) have shown that chromatin subunits (mononucleosomes) and their oligomers in a mild staphylococcal nuclease digest of chromatin display a heterogeneous content of histone H1. We now report that a mild staphylococcal nuclease digest of either chromatin or nuclei from mouse Ehrlich tumor cells contains mononucleosomes of three discrete kinds. The smallest mononucleosome (MN1) contains all histones except H1 and a DNA fragment 140 base pairs (bp) long. The intermediate mononucleosome (MN2) contains all five histones and a DNA fragment 170 bp long. The third mononucleosome (MN3) also contains all five histones, but its DNA fragment is longer and more heterogeneous in size (180–200 bp). Most of the MN3 particles are rapidly converted by nuclease into mononucleosomes MN1 and MN2 There exists, however, a relatively nuclease-resistant subpopulation of the MN3 mononucleosomes. These 200 bp MN1 particles contain not only histones but also nonhistone proteins, and are significantly more resistant to nuclease than the bulk of MN3 particles and the smaller mononucleosomes MN1 and MN2. There are eight major kinds of staphylococcal nuclease-produced soluble subnucleosomes (SN). The SN1 is a set of naked double-stranded DNA fragments ∼20 bp long. The SN2 is a complex of a specific basic nonhistone protein (molecular weight ∼16,000 daltons) and a DNA fragment ∼27 bp long. The SN3 contains histone H4, the above-mentioned specific nonhistone protein and a DNA fragment ∼27 bp long. The SN4 contains histones H2a, H2b, H4 and a DNA fragment ∼45 bp long. The SN5 contains histones H2a, H2b, H3 and a DNA fragment ∼55 bp long. The SN6 is a complex of histone H1 and a DNA fragment ∼35 bp long. Subnucleosomes SN7 and SN8 each contain all the histones except H1, and DNA fragments ∼100 and ∼120 bp long, respectively. Nuclease digestion of isolated mono- or dinucleosomes does not produce some of the subnucleosomes. These and related findings indicate that the cleavage required to generate these subnucleosomes result from some aspect of chromatin structure which is lost upon digestion to mono- and dinucleosomes."

One of these tRNAs appears to be specific to the silk gland, where its accumulation is associated with the rapid production of fibroin. Both sequences are identical, with the exception of a single nucleotide in the anticodon stem. A striking feature of both alanine tRNAs is that loop IV contains sequences previously believed to be restricted to initiator tRNA."

A role for adipocyte size in fat storage regulation and food intake control is postulated."
https://openalex.org/W2022981142,"Upon mixing purified TMV RNA with limited amounts of viral coat protein in the form of the disk aggregate, a unique region of the whole RNA becomes protected from nuclease digestion. The protected RNA consists of fragments up to 500 nucleotides long in varying yields, which are found in nucleoprotein particles having a protein-nucleic acid ratio similar to the mature virus. The protected RNA, when reextracted, is able to rebind to coat protein disks rapidly, quantitatively and with high affinity, becoming once more RNAase-resistant in the process. Small aggregates of TMV protein (A protein) are inactive in formation of the nuclease-resistant complexes. On the basis of this evidence, we identify the isolated RNA fragments as portions of TMV RNA containing the origin or initiation site for in vitro reassembly, which have been protected from digestion by incorporation into assembly nucleation complexes. The yield, but not the length distribution, of the protected RNA pieces is found to double upon increasing the protein added from 1–2 disk-equivalents of protein per RNA molecule. This implies that the formation of the nucleation complexes may involve a highly cooperative initial addition of protein."

https://openalex.org/W1508434110,"The alpha-hydroxylation of fatty acids with various chain length by a rat brain postnuclear preparation was investigated. The maximum velocity of the alpha-hydroxylation were higher for lignoceric (tetracosanoic), tricosanoic, docosanoic, and heneicosanoic acids and lower for hexacosanoic, pentacosanoic, eicosanoic, and nonadecanoic acids. Stearic palmitic, and phytanic (3,7,11,15-tetramethylpalmitic) acids were not hydroxylated by this preparation. Apparent Km values were lower for fatty acids with the higher Vmax and higher for those with the lower Vmax values. The relative order of alpha-hydroxylation strongly resembles the relative distribution of these fatty acids in brain cerebrosides, and we suggest that alpha-hydroxylation plays an important role in determining this distribution. An improved synthesis of [U-14C]phytanic acid is described. The rate of alpha-hydroxylation with [2-2H2]lignoceric acid was one-fifth of nondeuterated lignoceric acid and one-third of [3-2H2]lignoceric acid, while apparent Km values for these acids were similar. The reduced rate with [2-2H2]lignoceric acid indicates that the cleavage of the C-H bond is the rate-limiting step of the alpha-hydroxylation."

Messenger RNA synthesized in the presence of L-histidinol associates with ribosomal subunits to form initiation complexes whose ability to commence elongation appears impaired. As a result of this mode of action, L-histidinol treatment results in a dramatic reduction of polyribosomes and a concomitant accumulation of 80 S ribosomes. The inhibition of both protein and ribosomal RNA synthesis mediated by L-histidinol is rapidly reversed by the addition of L-histidine to treated cultures."

Chem. 252, 5274-5279) we have devised a method that permits the isolation of the subunits of ovine lutropin (oLH) in their form. The hormone was dissociated by guanidine HCl, and the subunits separated by salt precipitation (Sairam, M. R., and Li, C. H. (1974) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 165, 709-714). The present method differs significantly from that of Sairam and Li in that all operations are carried out at pH 5.0 or higher, a condition we have shown to be crucial to maintain the integrity of the isolated subunits. The yield of subunits was 75 to 85%. The isolated subunits exceed 95% purity (i.e. contamination with the other subunit or intact lutropin is less than 5%), migrate as single bands in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, and show only the NH2-terminal heterogeneity expected from that of the native hormone. Recombination of the subunits can be accomplished with 75 to 85% yield (with respect to mass) and with full recovery of biological activity."

https://openalex.org/W1489941315,"Guanyl-5'-yl-(alpha,beta-methylene)di[gamma-32P]phosphonate (Gp-(CH2)pp) is not hydrolyzed by rat liver membranes under conditions in which GTP and guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p) are hydrolyzed. Gp(CH2)pp activates adenylate cyclase in hepatic membranes with characteristics similar to those of Gpp(NH)p activation but with lower potency and effectiveness. The analogs, although with lower potency than GTP, also share the ability to change the glucagon receptor from a high to a low affinity state. Both Gp(CH2)pp and Gpp(NH)p stimulate adenylate cyclase activity following a lag period of about 1 min addition of GTP after steady state rates are achieved results in reduction in the rate following a lag period of 6 min from the time of addition of GTP. Pretreatment of the enzyme with Gpp(NH)p or Gp(CH2)pp, followed by washing the membranes, leads to a high activity state of the enzyme which slowly decays in rate unless the analogs are continuously present in the medium. These data suggest that the guanosyl nucleotide analogs act on the enzyme system by a slowly reversible process that possibly reflects slow binding and dissociation from different transition states of the enzyme system and suggest that activation of adenylate cyclase by GTP, Gpp(NH)p, and Gp(CH2)pp does not involve covalent modification of the enzyme."
