https://openalex.org/W2029344803,"of the Act by well-intentioned government officials. The listing of certain species as endangered has encouraged an increase in investigation of these taxa, notably in molecular genetics and field ecology (1). In some cases the molecular genetic results contradicted previous ideas about species integrity or taxonomic distinctions that were based on phenotypic (morphological) descriptions. Unfortunately these traditional taxonomic designations have been and continue to be the bases for management and eligibility for protection. This is a significant problem because the Endangered Species Act not only protects listed taxa from hunting, habitat exploitation, and other perils associated with human coexistence, but also provides significant financial resources for the effort to protect these species and to stabilize their populations. To illustrate the problem we summarize the interpretive difficulties posed by molecular results for four endangered groups. The Florida panther. This is a small population of mountain lion (also called cougar or puma) that descended from the Felis concolor coryi subspecies that ranged throughout the southern United States in the 19th century (2). The few remaining panthers (c50) living in southern Florida show significant physiological and reproductive impairments that are likely the consequence of inbreeding depression. A recent allozyme and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) analysis of the population revealed that two very distinct genetic stocks were living in Florida (2), one that resembled other North American pumas and another that was more closely related to a puma subspecies that had evolved in South America. Apparently seven animals from a captive stock (that later turned out to be a mixture of authentic F. concolor coryi and South American founders) were released into the Everglades between 1957 and 1967 and promptly forgotten. Today the founder ecosystem contains a mixture of two subspecies. The genetic advantages of introducing some additional genetic material into a population suffering from inbreeding would have been comforting except for one detail. Three opinions from the Solicitor's Office of the Department of the Interior (which is the counsel of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) have ruled with the force of precedent that hybrids between endangered species, subspecies, or populations cannot be protected. Their opinions, referred to here as the Hybrid Policy, concluded that protection of hybrids would not serve to recover listed species and would likely jeopardize S.J.

https://openalex.org/W2059707874,"A general method of manipulating adsorbed atoms and molecules on room-temperature surfaces with the use of a scanning tunneling microscope is described. By applying an appropriate voltage pulse between the sample and probe tip, adsorbed atoms can be induced to diffuse into the region beneath the tip. The field-induced diffusion occurs preferentially toward the tip during the voltage pulse because of the local potential energy gradient arising from the interaction of the adsorbate dipole moment with the electric field gradient at the surface. Depending upon the surface and pulse parameters, cesium (Cs) structures from one nanometer to a few tens of nanometers across have been created in this way on the (110) surfaces of gallium arsenide (GaAs) and indium antimonide (InSb), including structures that do not naturally occur."

When the homogenates were cultured on media containing 0.3M sucrose, osmotically stabilized, it was demonstrated that bacteria were present in the ""protoplast"" form, and that this form persisted in the kidney for at least 13 weeks after therapy."

Silver granules were present in the axoplasm of some myelinated fibers and in some of the axon terminals.
https://openalex.org/W2058628576,"Rats trained in an avoidance response while under the influence of chlorpromazine and then tested after receiving an injection of saline, or trained after receiving injections of saline and tested after an injection of chlorpromazine, showed greater dissociation and less recovery of the avoidance response than animals that received only injections of saline, or only injections of chlorpromazine during both training and testing sessions."
https://openalex.org/W2035293222,"Wide differences from tree to tree were found in the monoterpene composition of the wood oleoresin of ponderosa pines located in the same geographic area in California. Differences attributable to variation within the tree, to the season of sampling, to the year of sampling, and to methods of analysis by gas chromatography were only slight. There may be an inverse relation between the amounts of Delta(3)(-) carene and beta-pinene in a given tree."
https://openalex.org/W1989478843,"Simultaneous recordings were taken from two widely separated branches of the olfactory nerve of the frog. Odors from a variety of chemical substances were blown into the nares, and each elicited a different response magnitude ratio between the two branches. In addition, the time lapse between the two nerve responses differed for different chemicals. This suggests a time-space encoding of the mucosal response to odors."
https://openalex.org/W2077559734,"Brucella-agglutinating antibodies from selected bovine blood serums and milk samples did not fix complement, and after treatment with 2-mercaptoethanol they lost agglutinating power. After infection of calves with Brucella abortus, strain 19, agglutinins for Brucella that were inactivated by mercaptoethanol appeared earlier than those stable to mercaptoethanol. Under the conditions of these experiments, the appearance and development of complement-fixing capacity coincided closely with the mercaptoethanol stability of the agglutinins for Brucella."
https://openalex.org/W2073834350,"The successful symbiosis of soybean with Bradyrhizobium japonicum depends on their complex interactions, culminating in the development and maintenance of root nodules. A B. japonicum mutant defective in heme synthesis in culture was able to produce heme as a result of its symbiotic association with the soybean host. The bacterial mutant was incapable of synthesizing the committed heme precursor δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), but nodule plant cells formed ALA from glutamate. In addition, exogenous ALA was taken up by isolated nodule bacteria of the parent strain and of the mutant. It is proposed that bacterial heme found in nodules can be synthesized from plant ALA, hence segments of a single metabolic pathway are spatially separated into two organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2058145046,"The olfactory mucosal slow potential decreased remarkably or disappeared when part of the mucus on the olfactory epithelium was removed with absorbent paper. In contrast, the neural response was not changed much, while unitary spikes in response to odor also appeared in the epithelium. The paper reduced the thicknèss of the mucus by about half, but olfactory cilia were still present. This evidence suggests that the slow potential is not the generator potential."
https://openalex.org/W1975169550,"By 1988, the Mexican-origin population of the United States had grown to 12.1 million, largely from recent, sharp increases in immigration. The policy concerns raised by this phenomenon have been influenced by some perceptions that available research contradicts. Today most Mexican immigrants come to stay, about half are female, and they have increasingly less schooling compared to the native-born population and other immigrants. Nationally, they do not cause adverse economic effects for native-born workers and, across generations, their language and political assimilation is proceeding well. They put greater demands on education than on other public services. However, the Mexican-origin population affects the economy and public services more and differently in the areas where it is concentrated, primarily in the western United States and large urban areas. Further, the recent legalization of 2.3 million Mexican immigrants can be expected to increase the demand on public services, especially in those areas."
https://openalex.org/W2021549221,"Angular distribution patterns of Auger electrons and of photoelectrons from a Cu (001) surface were measured at the same electron kinetic energy. These measurements reveal that the low kinetic energy angular distributions for Cu Auger electrons and Cu 3p(3/2) photoelectrons differ substantially. This direct comparison between the photoelectron and Auger electron angular distributions demonstrates that, in some circumstances, the Auger process produces a complicated source wave whose nature must be explored before Auger angular distributions can be used for surface structure analysis."

https://openalex.org/W1970527100,"When heterosexual pairs of gonads of fetal mice were homotransplanted in close contact with each other below the kidney capsule of castrated adult hosts, the testis developed normally for this environment, but the ovary became an ovotestis. The medulla of the ovotestis contained dilated seminiferous tubules in which spermatogenesis progressed to the point at which secondary spermatocytes were produced. Under these conditions, germ cells, genetically determined as ova, underwent differentiation toward spermatozoa. This is the second clear case of germ cell reversal by experimental means in a mammalian species."
https://openalex.org/W2057238954,"An antibody to nucleoprotein, which appears to be an autoantibody, occurs in the gamma-globulin fraction of serum from mice of the A/J strain. This antibody combines with nucleoprotein of several species but not with calf thymus DNA. The frequency of its occurrence increases with age and is greater in females. Serums that contain the antibody produce typical lupus erythematosus cells in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1969646959,"Antibody directed against a neutral hapten, p-amino-beta-phenyl lactoside, has been purified, and its amino acid composition has been determined. When the results were compared with the previous analyses of two rabbit antibodies, small but significant differences were found. The demonstration of a third unique antibody composition supports the hypothesis that the amino acid differences are related to specificity rather than to the heterogeneity of gamma-globulin."
https://openalex.org/W2061297553,"A transition from normal hadronic matter (such as protons and neutrons) to quark-gluon matter is expected at both high temperatures and densities. In physical situations, this transition may occur in heavy ion collisions, the early universe, and in the cores of neutron stars. Astrophysics and cosmology can be greatly affected by such a phase transition. With regard to the early universe, big bang nucleosynthesis, the theory describing the primordial origin of the light elements, can be affected by inhomogeneities produced during the transition. A transition to quark matter in the interior by neutron stars further enhances our uncertainties regarding the equation of state of dense nuclear matter and neutron star properties such as the maximum mass and rotation frequencies."

https://openalex.org/W1986540688,"This is the first report that a nematode causes plant tissues to produce starch. The formation of starch granules in the syncytial cells of several plant species is induced by Nacobbus batatiformis. The starch, which is associated with the feeding of the nematode, appears within a few days after the animal has become situated in the plant roots and diminishes in amount during nematode reproduction. The starch granules show the usual optical properties."

https://openalex.org/W2010328010,"A respiratory distress syndrome resembling that seen in human infants was encountered in 4 out of 90 rhesus monkey infants after uncomplicated births. These were nonviable immature infants weighing less than 350 grams. A much higher incidence of respiratory distress was observed in those whose births were complicated by experimental procedures, mainly asphyxiation. Thirty-four out of 68 infants developed the syndrome, the incidence being greatest among the least mature."
https://openalex.org/W2074157288,"Last spring human forecasters thought they saw signs of an imminent warming of the tropical Pacific, a classic El Nino, that could wreak havoc with weather around the globe. Researchers running computer models, on the other hand, saw a slight warming but not enough for an El Nino. The modelers were right. The season for El Ninos has ended and nothing happened. Since the models came online about 5 years ago, there have been two contests to predict El Ninos, which occur every 3 to 7 years, and the models have won both. The models are still experimental, but the general feeling is that they're indicating the right trends. The prospect of having reliable El Nino prediction models is good news beyond the small coterie of tropical Pacific specialists. Worldwide weather patterns are closely tied to El Nino cycles."
