https://openalex.org/W2008472315,"Few countries in the world are as dependent on water from a single source as Egypt. The natural Nile cycle of flow and sediment discharge has been disrupted by human intervention, including closure of the High Aswan Dam; this intervention has resulted in a series of responses that now threaten the northern Nile delta. Erosion, salinization, and pollution are inducing a marked decline in agricultural productivity and loss of land and coastal lagoons at a time when the population is expanding exponentially. Geological analyses of radiocarbon-dated cores across the northern delta are used to interpret the interaction of sea-level changes, climatic oscillations, subsidence, and transport processes during the past 35,000 years. Recognition of long-term trends of these natural factors provides a basis to evaluate the profound impact of human activity and to assess future changes in the Nile delta ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W2042874024,"In recent years, the view that Pleistocene climatic events played a major role in the evolution of the biotas of southern, primarily tropical continents has begun to displace the previously held conviction that these areas remained relatively stable during the Quaternary. Studies of speciation patterns of high Andean plant and avian taxa (7-14) have led to the conclusion that Pleistocene climatic events were the factors that ultimately shaped the patterns now observed in the paramo-puna and the related Patagonian flora and fauna. The final uplift of the Andes at the end of the Tertiary automatically limits the age of the high Andean habitats and their biotas to the Quaternary. Within this period, the number of ecological fluctuations caused by the glaciations could easily have provided the mechanism behind the patterns now present in these habitats (Appendix, 1; Figs. 1 and 2; Table 1). In glacial periods, when vegetation belts, were lowered, organisms in the paramo-puna habitat were allowed to expand their ranges. In interglacial periods, these taxa were isolated on disjunct peaks, where differentiation could occur. At times of ice expansion, glacial tongues and lakes provided local barriers to gene exchange, whereas in warm, interglacial times, dry river valleys were a major deterrent to the interbreeding of populations on different mountains (Fig. 2; Table 2). A preliminary analysis of about 10 to 12 percent of the total South American avifauna (14), subsequent to the study of the high Andean biota, suggested that the birds of all the major habitats of the continent possess, with about equal frequency, similar stages of speciation. This correspondence in levels of evolution indicated that the avifauna of vegetation zones which were thought to have been more stable (for example, tropical rainforests) are as actively speciating as are those of the more recent paramo-puna habitats. More intensive work on lowland tropical taxa (16, 19-21) and recent work on montane forest elements (40) now justify the conclusion that the floras and faunas of these areas were also greatly affected by Pleistocene climatic shifts. In the broad region of South America that lies within the tropics, a series of humid-arid cycles (Appendix, 6, 8-10) drastically and repeatedly altered vegetation patterns during the Quaternary. Both montane and lowland rainforests were fragmented during dry periods and were able to reexpand during humid phases. Speciation of forest elements was initiated-and sometimes completed-in isolated patches of the fragmented forest. Secondary contact, with hybridization or reunition of populations that did not become reproductively isolated, occurred in periods of reexpansion. These biological data, combined with supportive geological evidence (Appendix, 1-11), show that climatic events during the last million or so years have affected the biota of South America as much as the Pleistocene glacial changes affected the biotas of Eurasia and North America. Since most of South America lies within tropical latitudes, it is suggested here that part of the diversity of species in the tropical areas of this continent is due to two historical factors: the lack of wholesale elimination of species (compared with northern and high latitudes), and ample opportunity for speciation in successive periods of ecological isolation. The apparent paradox of the wealth of species in the ""stable tropics"" is partially explained by the fact that the tropics have probably been quite unstable, from the point of view of their biotas, during the Pleistocene and perhaps part of the Tertiary."
https://openalex.org/W2114330124,The male Anna Hummingbird accommodates seasonal changes in energy demands by varying its allocation of time and energy among different activities; total energy expenditures change relatively little. Augmented terrritorial defense during the breeding season is made possible by increased feeding efficiency due to the availability at this time of very nectar-rich flowers.
https://openalex.org/W2014008277,"13-Methylhentriacontane has been identified in the feces and larvae of the corn earworm, Heliothis zea (Boddie), as the major constituent that triggers the short-range host-seeking response of the parasite Microplitis croceipes (Cresson). This chemical, the first found that mediates the complex host-parasite relation, could upgrade present efforts to use parasites for insect control. Bioassay of closely related compounds indicated that the structural requirements for activity are remarkably specific."
https://openalex.org/W2007759990,"Thermal emission of electrons is ordinarily considered to be exclusively a property of macroscopic condensed matter. Slow electron emission occurs for certain small metal clusters as well as for silicon and carbon clusters, but the nature of this process has not been established. Electron emission rates have been obtained and analyzed from extensive real-time measurements on negatively charged fullerenes for several sizes and over a wide, continuous range of energies. These results confirm that delayed electron emission is a simple activated process that depends strongly on the internal energy and size of the cluster and that it has a common underlying mechanism, independent of size. However, the Arrhenius form deduced is inconsistent with the emission rate theory used for bulk surfaces. These results allow the question of the correct microscopic description of this newly observed electron emission process to be assessed."
https://openalex.org/W2091298180,"Paleomagnetic and micropaleontological studies of deep-sea sedimentary cores between Australia and Antarctica define an extensive area centered in the south Tasman Basin, where sediment as old as Early Pliocene has been systematically eroded by bottom currents. This major sedimentary disconformity has been produced by a substantial increase in velocity of Antarctic bottom water, possibly associated with late Cenozoic climatic cooling and corresponding increased glaciation of Antarctica."
https://openalex.org/W2003018591,"Lattice mismatch stresses, which severely restrict heteroepitaxial growth, are greatly minimized when thin alumina films are grown by means of van der Waals forces on inert mica substrates. A 10-nanometer-thick epitaxial film exhibits crystallographic sixfold symmetry, a lattice constant close to that of the basal plane [0001] of α-alumina (sapphire), and an aluminum:oxygen atomic ratio of 1:1.51 ± 0.02 (measured by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy), again the same as for bulk sapphire. The film is free of steps and grain boundaries over large areas and appears to be an ideal model system for studying adhesion, tribology, and other surface phenomena at atomic scales."

More stringent admission standards, quotas, reduced financial support, incentives, or other means of controlling the number of doctorates will challenge established values, frustrate many students and many professors, exacerbate tensions among established and emerging institutions, aggravate the uneasy relationships between universities and government, complicate faculty-administration problems, and accentuate differences between older and younger faculty members. Some academicians will no doubt be inclined to the view that difficulties in the job market for young doctorates created by a laissez-faire approach are moderate compared with the difficulties that will be generated by efforts to adjust supply and demand. We are of the opinion that these problems must be faced, and that the longrange imbalance, inequities, and strains arising from ignoring the problem will far outweigh the stresses generated by efforts to cope with it."
https://openalex.org/W2064158128,Adult sphinx moths lack external ocelli. In Manduca sexta and other anocellate moths structures homologous to ocelli have been observed. Histological examination of such a structure in Manduca sexta has shown structural similarities to ocelli of other insects. Electrophysiological studies revealed a response to light stimuli stimilar to the electroretinogram of external ocelli. The evidence strongly suggests that the structures are internal ocelli.

https://openalex.org/W2027503679,Analyses of molecular spectra and compression data from crystals show that a single function successfully describes the dependence on interatomic separation of both the potential energy of diatomic molecules and the cohesive binding energy of condensed matter. The empirical finding that one function describes interatomic energies for such diverse forms of matter and over a wide range of conditions can be used to extend condensed-matter equations of state but warrants further theoretical study.
https://openalex.org/W2066873264,"Recently completed high-resolution radar maps of the moon contain information on the decimeter-scale structure of the surface. When this information is combined with eclipse thermal-enhancement data and with high-resolution Lunar Orbiter photography, the surface morphology is revealed in some detail. A geological history for certain features and subareas can be developed, which provides one possible framework for the interpretation of the findings from the Apollo 15 landing. Frequency of decimeter-and meter-size blocks in and around lunar craters, given by the remote-sensed data, supports a multilayer structure in the Palus Putredinis mare region, as well as a great age for the bordering Apennine Mountains scarp."
https://openalex.org/W2119307558,"Because of the small size and irregular orbits of the seven outer satellites of Jupiter, it is often assumed that they were derived by capture. The conditions whereby Jupiter can capture satellites have therefore been examined. Relationships derived on the basis of the three-body problem for planets in elliptical orbits enable the dimensions of the capture orbits around Jupiter to be calculated. It is found that Jupiter may capture satellites through the inner Lagrangian point when at perihelion or at aphelion. Captures at perihelion should give rise to satellites in direct orbits of 11.48 x 10(6) kilometers and capture at aphelion to retrograde orbits of 21.7 x 10(6) kilometers. The correspondence with the seven outer satellites suggests that Jupiter VI, VIl, and X in direct orbits at 11.47, 11.74, and 11.85 x 10(6) kilometers were captured at Jupiter perihelion, whereas Jupiter VIII, IX, XI, and XII in retrograde orbits of 23.5, 23.7, 22.5, and 21.2 x 10(6) kilometers were captured when Jupiter was at aphelion. Examination of the precapture orbits indicates that the seven outer satellites were derived from the asteroid belt."

Numerical simulations are especially useful in the study of non-crystalline materials such as liquids, glasses, amorphous solids, and liquid crystals. Some applications of computer simulations to these materials are discussed."

These experiments are designed expressly to test one prediction of supersymmetry - that of an electric dipole in atoms of less than 10[sup [minus]27] cm. The researchers can presently detect an offset of less than 10[sup [minus]26] cm between an atom's positive and negative charge. Three groups are measuring the precession of atoms exposed to electric fields. They are studying atoms of cesium and mercury, and molecules of thallium fluoride."
