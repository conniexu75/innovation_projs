https://openalex.org/W2144856591,"A genome-scale metabolic model of the lactic acid bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 was constructed based on genomic content and experimental data. The complete model includes 721 genes, 643 reactions, and 531 metabolites. Different stoichiometric modeling techniques were used for interpretation of complex fermentation data, as L. plantarum is adapted to nutrient-rich environments and only grows in media supplemented with vitamins and amino acids. (i) Based on experimental input and output fluxes, maximal ATP production was estimated and related to growth rate. (ii) Optimization of ATP production further identified amino acid catabolic pathways that were not previously associated with free-energy metabolism. (iii) Genome-scale elementary flux mode analysis identified 28 potential futile cycles. (iv) Flux variability analysis supplemented the elementary mode analysis in identifying parallel pathways, e.g. pathways with identical end products but different co-factor usage. Strongly increased flexibility in the metabolic network was observed when strict coupling between catabolic ATP production and anabolic consumption was relaxed. These results illustrate how a genome-scale metabolic model and associated constraint-based modeling techniques can be used to analyze the physiology of growth on a complex medium rather than a minimal salts medium. However, optimization of biomass formation using the Flux Balance Analysis approach, reported to successfully predict growth rate and by product formation in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, predicted too high biomass yields that were incompatible with the observed lactate production. The reason is that this approach assumes optimal efficiency of substrate to biomass conversion, and can therefore not predict the metabolically inefficient lactate formation.

Genome-scale metabolic models have become available for an increasing number of organisms (1Reed J.L. Famili I. Thiele I. Palsson B.O. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 130-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). These models link genomic information to metabolic reaction networks and have gained considerable attention, not only within the context of metabolic engineering (2Price N.D. Reed J.L. Palsson B.O. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 886-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 3Patil K.R. Akesson M. Nielsen J. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2004; 15: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), but also from the bioinformatics field (4Kharchenko P. Vitkup D. Church G.M. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: I178-I185Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 5Patil K.R. Nielsen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2685-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). An increasing repertoire of modeling techniques is available for exploring the capabilities of the metabolic network, and for understanding genotype-phenotype relationships (2Price N.D. Reed J.L. Palsson B.O. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 886-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 6Teusink B. Smid E.J. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 4: 46-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These techniques are often referred to as constraint-based modeling techniques. So far, constraint-based modeling techniques have mainly been applied to microorganisms that grow on a minimal salt medium containing a single carbon source (1Reed J.L. Famili I. Thiele I. Palsson B.O. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 130-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). However, in many biological niches, as well as in multicellular organisms, cells encounter more complex nutritional environments. In analogy, in many industrial and biotechnological applications of microorganisms and cell lines, complex media are used, either because the cells are auxotrophic for nutrients or such media are cheaper. Multiple inputs for the metabolic network complicate constraint-based modeling approaches considerably. Moreover, one may expect quite different metabolic behavior in such a complex environment compared with that in minimal salts media. The question arises whether and to what extent constraint-based modeling is useful in such biotechnologically relevant cases. We used constraint-based modeling methods to explore the metabolism of Lactobacillus plantarum, a lactic acid bacterium (LAB) 2The abbreviations used are: LAB, lactic acid bacteria; FBA, flux balance analysis; FVA, flux variability analysis; EFM, elementary flux mode. used in a variety of industrial food fermentations, and marketed as a probiotic (6Teusink B. Smid E.J. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 4: 46-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). L. plantarum grows only in rich media, such as decomposed plant materials and meat, and consequently has become auxotrophic for many vitamins and amino acids. Hence, the chemically defined medium used in our laboratory contains glucose, citrate, acetate, nucleosides and nucleobases, vitamins, and 18 amino acids (7Teusink B. van Enckevort F.H. Francke C. Wiersma A. Wegkamp A. Smid E.J. Siezen R.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 7253-7262Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We have recently performed a metabolic reconstruction, based on a careful annotation of the genomic content (8Kleerebezem M. Boekhorst J. van Kranenburg R. Molenaar D. Kuipers O.P. Leer R. Tarchini R. Peters S.A. Sandbrink H.M. Fiers M.W. Stiekema W. Lankhorst R.M. Bron P.A. Hoffer S.M. Groot M.N. Kerkhoven R. de Vries M. Ursing B. de Vos W.M. Siezen R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1990-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar), combined with single omission experiments to infer functional pathways (7Teusink B. van Enckevort F.H. Francke C. Wiersma A. Wegkamp A. Smid E.J. Siezen R.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 7253-7262Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Here we report on the construction and analysis of a genome-scale metabolic model of L. plantarum, and the comparison with experimental fermentation data. We illustrate how different stoichiometric modeling approaches provide a detailed analysis of the metabolism in this lactic acid bacterium, and how it generates testable hypotheses. Unlike the apparent success to describe and predict metabolism in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, however, optimization of biomass formation using flux balance analysis failed to predict metabolism in L. plantarum. We will discuss this result in the light of microbial physiology. Fermentation and Growth Conditions—L. plantarum WCFS1 was grown at 37 °C in chemically defined medium (7Teusink B. van Enckevort F.H. Francke C. Wiersma A. Wegkamp A. Smid E.J. Siezen R.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 7253-7262Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) in a 10-ml tube, and used as inoculum of 500 ml of pH-controlled (pH 5.5) cultures in a 1.0-liter fermentor (Applikon Biotechnology BV, the Netherlands). The headspace was flushed with nitrogen at a stirring speed of 120 rpm. At A600 = 1, the medium pump was switched on at dilution rates 0.1-0.5 h-1, and steady state was achieved within 5 volume changes (as judged by constant A600). At steady state, 150-ml samples were taken and immediately spun down in a Megafuge 1.0R at 4 °C (Heraus Instruments, Germany). Cell pellet was used to measure biomass composition as detailed in supplementary Materials I. Supernatant was used to measure compound concentrations. Organic compounds were measured by high performance liquid chromatography as described previously (9Starrenburg M.J. Hugenholtz J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1991; 57: 3535-3540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Free amino acids were determined by Ansynth BV (Roosendaal, The Netherlands). At the time of harvest, samples from the feed stock were also taken and analyzed for organic compounds and amino acids, as described above. Fluxes qi (in mmol h-1 gDW-1) were calculated as: qi = D × (Ci,supernatant - Ci,feed)/Xbiomass, where C is the concentration of compound i (in mmol liter-1), Xbiomass is the biomass concentration (in gDW liter-1), and D is the dilution rate (in h-1). Construction of a Genome-scale Model and Constraint-based Modeling—The genome-scale metabolic model was based on a metabolic reconstruction that was described in detail elsewhere (7Teusink B. van Enckevort F.H. Francke C. Wiersma A. Wegkamp A. Smid E.J. Siezen R.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 7253-7262Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The model was developed within the Simpheny™ software environment (Genomatica Inc., San Diego, CA). Also the constraint-based modeling techniques, i.e. flux balance analyses (2Price N.D. Reed J.L. Palsson B.O. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 886-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 10Varma A. Palsson B.O. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 3724-3731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and flux variability analysis (11Mahadevan R. Schilling C.H. Metab. Eng. 2003; 5: 264-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar), were carried out within Simpheny™. FBA and FVA are based on linear programming as described (10Varma A. Palsson B.O. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 3724-3731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Mahadevan R. Schilling C.H. Metab. Eng. 2003; 5: 264-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). FBA finds a flux distribution that optimizes an objective function; FVA finds the flux value range (called the “span”) of each reaction by minimizing and maximizing the flux through that reaction, given a set of constraints. In Ref. 11Mahadevan R. Schilling C.H. Metab. Eng. 2003; 5: 264-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar the constraints were set by a FBA solution; here we used experimentally derived flux values (of uptake rates and secretion rates) to constrain the solution space. Blocked Reactions and Unbalanced Metabolites—To identify all blocked reactions that could not carry any flux (12Burgard A.P. Nikolaev E.V. Schilling C.H. Maranas C.D. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), FVA was carried out: blocked reactions are those reactions that have a minimal and maximal flux value of zero. Note that the results of FVA and hence, the number of blocked reactions, depend on the constraints of the system. Unbalanced metabolites are those metabolites (row-vectors in the stoichiometry matrix) that have only zero entries after deletion of the blocked reactions (columns) in the stoichiometry matrix. Elementary Flux Mode Analysis—For elementary flux mode (EFM) analysis, the reactions and metabolites from the Simpheny™ output files where parsed via Python scripts into a Meta-Tool (13Pfeiffer T. Sanchez-Valdenebro I. Nuno J.C. Montero F. Schuster S. Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) input file. Only ATP, ADP, phosphate, water and protons were set as external metabolites, i.e. as metabolites that can act as source or sink in an EFM. Because all reactions in the network are elementary balanced, only circulations and futile cycles can form EFMs under these conditions. Determination of Energy Parameters for Maintenance and Growth—To determine how much ATP is needed for biomass formation and maintenance, it is needed to estimate the total ATP production rate in the system at different growth rates. The slope of a plot of ATP production rate against growth rate gives the amount of ATP needed to form biomass YATP; the intercept is the maintenance requirement mATP, i.e. the ATP production rate at zero growth rate. It is important to note that the biomass equation used to simulate growth in the final model is: biomass components + y ATP + y H2O → biomass + y ADP + y Pi + y H. YATP, the total amount of ATP needed for growth, is actually the sum of the ATP needed to form the biomass components, and the amount of ATP to assemble the biomass components into biomass (y). The amount of ATP needed to make biomass components (defined as x), is explicitly accounted for by the model reactions and will be calculated below. We first seek to find y, which can be done with a genome-scale model by setting y = 0 in the biomass equation and instead introduce an ATP dissipation reaction, vATP (ATP + H2O → ADP + Pi + H). We use FBA to find the maximal vATP. The problem is defined as: maximize vATP subject to, S·v=0v¯i-SDi<vi<v¯i+SDi∀measuredfluxesvivj,min<vj<j,max∀fluxesvj(j≠i)μ=D(Eq. 1) where S is the stoichiometry matrix, v is the flux vector, SD standard deviation, μ is the growth rate (with y = 0), and D is the dilution rate of the chemostat. The result is the maximal rate of ATP production that the system can attain at the measured fluxes and at the growth rate. In steady state, under the assumption of full coupling, ATP production equals ATP consumption, so that vATP = mATP + y·μ. Hence, in a plot of vATP against the growth rate, y is the slope and mATP is the intercept (Fig. 1). To be able to compare total ATP production rates estimated by the traditional approach (see main text) and the genome-scale approach we compare: traditional, Vtotal,trad = vlactate + 2vacetate and genome-scale, Vtotal,GS = (x + y)·μ + mATP. Where vlactate and vacetate are the rates of lactate and acetate production, respectively. To compute Vtotal,GS we still need to estimate the amount of ATP required for precursor biosynthesis (x). For this, we can use the reduced cost of the biomass flux for ATP dissipation. The reduced cost ri of a flux vi is a sensitivity coefficient generated by the linear programming algorithm, indicating how much the objective function would change if the boundary constraint of that flux would be changed: ri = dvATP/dvi. Thus, for the biomass formation flux μ, its reduced cost for ATP dissipation indicates how much less ATP can be dissipated when biomass formation is increased. That reduced cost (given in Table 3) therefore represents x.TABLE 3Sensitivity analysis of ATP dissipation (= production in steady state) All exchange reactions with non-zero scaled reduced cost towards ATP dissipation are shown. Absolute reduced costs indicate the effect of an increase of a flux (in the direction indicated under “direction”) on the ATP production. Scaled reduced costs indicate the fractional change in ATP dissipation upon a fractional change of a flux. Average plus S.D. are shown for simulations of four different dilution rates (0.1—0.5 h—1, 25 mm glucose), taking measured fluxes as constraints in the simulation.ReactionDirectionAbsolute reduced costScaled reduced costaverage ± S.D.EX_glc(e)aThe abbreviations used are: EX_ indicates exchange reaction; EX_glc(e), glucose; EX_ac(e), acetate; EX_cit(e), citrate; EX_for(e), formate; EX_asp-L(e), aspartate; EX_ser-L(e) serine; EX_his-L(e), histidine; EX_glu-L(e), glutamate; EX_ade(e), adenine; EX_gua(e), guanine; EX_val-L(e), valine; EX_leu-L(e), leucine; EX_tyr-L(e), tyrosine; EX_ile-L(e), isoleucine; EX_ura(e), uracil; EX_met-L(e), methionine; EX_phe-L(e), phenylalanine; EX_ins(e), isosine; EX_ala-L(e), alanine; EX_gly(e), glycine; EX_pyr(e), pyruvate; EX_thr-L(e), threonine; EX_cys- L(e), cysteine; EX_succ(e), succinate; biomass_LPL6.0# biomass (version 6.0 without additional ATP requirement; exact stoichiometry in supplemental materials IV)Consumed2.000 ± 0.0000.862 ± 0.026EX_ac(e)Produced0.333 ± 0.0000.039 ± 0.006EX_cit(e)Consumed1.042 ± 0.4380.035 ± 0.012EX_for(e)Produced0.333 ± 0.0000.022 ± 0.008EX_asp-L(e)Consumed1.083 ± 0.5180.012 ± 0.005EX_ser-L(e)Consumed0.250 ± 0.1670.008 ± 0.008EX_his-L(e)Consumed0.417 ± 0.0960.007 ± 0.002EX_glu-L(e)Consumed0.625 ± 0.4790.005 ± 0.003EX_ade(e)Consumed3.125 ± 1.9780.004 ± 0.003EX_gua(e)Consumed3.250 ± 0.1670.004 ± 0.000EX_val-L(e)Consumed0.375 ± 0.1600.003 ± 0.001EX_leu-L(e)Consumed0.375 ± 0.1600.003 ± 0.001EX_tyr-L(e)Consumed0.375 ± 0.1600.002 ± 0.001EX_ile-L(e)Consumed0.375 ± 0.1600.002 ± 0.001EX_ura(e)Consumed0.958 ± 1.9170.001 ± 0.003EX_met-L(e)Consumed0.083 ± 0.0960.001 ± 0.001EX_phe-L(e)Consumed0.375 ± 0.1600.001 ± 0.000EX_ins(e)Consumed3.083 ± 2.0210.001 ± 0.001EX_ala-L(e)Consumed0.375 ± 0.1600.001 ± 0.000EX_gly(e)Consumed—0.542 ± 0.210—0.001 ± 0.001EX_pyr(e)Produced—0.333 ± 0.000—0.001 ± 0.000EX_thr-L(e)Consumed—0.208 ± 0.210—0.001 ± 0.001EX_cys- L(e)Consumed—3.583 ± 0.701—0.003 ± 0.000EX_succ(e)Produced—0.375 ± 0.438—0.015 ± 0.017Biomass_LPL6.0#Produced—29.912 ± 0.688—0.729 ± 0.162a The abbreviations used are: EX_ indicates exchange reaction; EX_glc(e), glucose; EX_ac(e), acetate; EX_cit(e), citrate; EX_for(e), formate; EX_asp-L(e), aspartate; EX_ser-L(e) serine; EX_his-L(e), histidine; EX_glu-L(e), glutamate; EX_ade(e), adenine; EX_gua(e), guanine; EX_val-L(e), valine; EX_leu-L(e), leucine; EX_tyr-L(e), tyrosine; EX_ile-L(e), isoleucine; EX_ura(e), uracil; EX_met-L(e), methionine; EX_phe-L(e), phenylalanine; EX_ins(e), isosine; EX_ala-L(e), alanine; EX_gly(e), glycine; EX_pyr(e), pyruvate; EX_thr-L(e), threonine; EX_cys- L(e), cysteine; EX_succ(e), succinate; biomass_LPL6.0# biomass (version 6.0 without additional ATP requirement; exact stoichiometry in supplemental materials IV) Open table in a new tab Flux Variability and Modeling of Uncoupling—A flux variability analysis is formulated: ∀viϵv, minimize and maximize vi subject to Equation 2.

Hence, coupling is modeled as vATP = max(vATP), where again y = 0 in the biomass equation. In the uncoupled case, the amount of ATP needed for maintenance and assembly is left open, i.e. vATP was allowed to vary between 0 and max(vATP). Genome-scale Metabolic Model: Features—We constructed a genome-scale model on the basis of the metabolic reconstruction reported previously (7Teusink B. van Enckevort F.H. Francke C. Wiersma A. Wegkamp A. Smid E.J. Siezen R.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 7253-7262Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Such a model defines all geneprotein reaction associations, which can be complex (6Teusink B. Smid E.J. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 4: 46-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 7Teusink B. van Enckevort F.H. Francke C. Wiersma A. Wegkamp A. Smid E.J. Siezen R.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 7253-7262Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The reactions form a metabolic network that needs to be carefully curated for the purpose of constraint-based modeling (see Refs. 1Reed J.L. Famili I. Thiele I. Palsson B.O. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 130-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar and 14Francke C. Siezen R.J. Teusink B. Trends Microbiol. 2005; 13: 550-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar for reviews on this process). In a metabolic reconstruction that aims merely at putting genes in a metabolic context, such as pathways, uncertainties and omissions are not essential; for a quantitative model, however, essential aspects are (i) definition of a quantitative biomass equation, involving macromolecular content and composition (see supplementary Material I), (ii) analysis and closing of network gaps, i.e. reactions in essential metabolic routes to which no gene could be assigned, (iii) choosing specific stoichiometry of reactions, such as cofactor usage and transport mechanisms, (iv) determination of ATP coefficients quantifying growth- and non-growth associated ATP consumption processes not explicitly accounted for in the model (1Reed J.L. Famili I. Thiele I. Palsson B.O. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 130-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 6Teusink B. Smid E.J. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 4: 46-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) (see below). Given the different perspectives of each network, it is difficult to directly compare the reconstruction of Ref. 7Teusink B. van Enckevort F.H. Francke C. Wiersma A. Wegkamp A. Smid E.J. Siezen R.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 7253-7262Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar with the current model. An indication of the extent of curation is the fact that the current model has 120 reactions that are not associated to genes (see below). The final model consisted of 721 genes (23.5% of the total number of genes) and 643 balanced reactions of which 120 (18.5%) were not associated with a gene but inferred from biochemical and physiological data (7Teusink B. van Enckevort F.H. Francke C. Wiersma A. Wegkamp A. Smid E.J. Siezen R.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 7253-7262Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The model had 531 balanced metabolites, 97 of which had an extracellular equivalent (see Table 1 for further details). When the genome is taken as the starting point in metabolic reconstruction, reactions may be included in the model that do not have a source and sink (e.g. isolated reactions). Such reactions cannot carry any flux at steady state. The number of reactions that participate in these so-called blocked reactions (12Burgard A.P. Nikolaev E.V. Schilling C.H. Maranas C.D. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), and the degrees of freedom of the network depend on the available compounds that can be exchanged with the environment (see Table 1).TABLE 1Main characteristics of the genome-scale model of L. plantarum WCFS1 Because the constraints on reactions are dependent on the growth conditions, we provide an analysis for the complete model without any flux constraints (complete network), and for the model used to simulate growth on chemically defined medium (CDM).Complete networkCDMTotal genes30643064 Included genes721 (23.5%)721 (23.5%)Total reactions762762 Blocked reactions119201 Balanced reactions643561Internal reactions546489Exchange reactions9772Total metabolites658658 Unbalanced metabolites127180 Balanced metabolites531478Internal metabolites434406External metabolites9772Linear dependencies of metabolitesaCaused by conserved compound moieties: 19 tRNAs, ACP (acyl carrier protein), thioredoxin, and MoaD (scaffold protein for molybdenum cofactor and thiamin biosynthesis (7)) for chemically defined medium, and additionally glutathione and menaquinone for the complete network2422Degrees of freedombCalculated as number of balanced reactions — (number of balanced metabolites — number of linear dependencies)136105a Caused by conserved compound moieties: 19 tRNAs, ACP (acyl carrier protein), thioredoxin, and MoaD (scaffold protein for molybdenum cofactor and thiamin biosynthesis (7Teusink B. van Enckevort F.H.

An important feature of the model is the balancing of protons. Proton gradients are essential for the overall energetics of bacteria (for review on this in LAB, see Ref. 15Konings W.N. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 2002; 82: 3-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Another feature of our model is the use of vitamins and cofactor pools in the biomass equation: new cells form the only sink for these compounds, and all reactions associated to the biosynthesis of these compounds would carry no flux without inclusion in the biomass equation. This feature was only recently introduced also in the S. cerevisae model, leading to improved predictability of lethality (16Kuepfer L. Sauer U. Blank L.M. Genome Res. 2005; 15: 1421-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Maintenance and Growth-associated Energy Coefficients— Essential parameters in a stoichiometric model are the energy requirement for maintenance, and for growth (17Nielsen J. Villadsen J. Chem. Eng. Sci. 1992; 47: 4225-4270Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The growth-associated energy requirement lumps (partly unknown) energy requirements for biomass precursor biosynthesis and for assembly of these biomass components into biomass. ATP parameters determine how much biomass can be made from the available amount of free energy. Assuming that the catabolic ATP production rate is balanced by the anabolic ATP consumption rate under energy limitation, the ATP parameters can be estimated from ATP production rates, calculated from physiological data, at different growth rates (18Tempest D.W. Neijssel O.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1984; 38: 459-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, L. plantarum was grown (anaerobically) in glucose-limited chemostats at different dilution rates, and product formation and substrate consumption rates were measured. Table 2 summarizes the results for the organic compounds; amino acid fluxes can be found in supplementary Material II. Because we found no differences in relative product formation and biomass composition over the dilution rates tested, data are presented as the average yield over the dilution range. Of all carbon taken up, 67 ± 1% (g/g) was converted into lactate (Table 2). For many amino acids, uptake rates were larger than required for biomass production (see supplementary Material II for details).TABLE 2Amount of substrates consumed and products formed per g of biomass in continuous fermentations on chemically defined medium (CDM) with low (25 mm) and high (100 mm) glucose concentrations Data presented are yield data averaged over the dilution rates indicated.

This condition is not corrected by maternal zinc supplementation, supporting the speculation that it results from an inherited genetic condition. We identified a family in which two exclusively breast-fed infants developed zinc deficiency that was associated with low milk zinc concentration in both women. Sequencing of genomic DNA detected a mis-sense mutation (Ade→Gua) that substitutes a conserved histidine at amino acid 54 with arginine (H54R) in SLC30A2 (ZnT-2) that is present in both affected subjects and several other siblings. Gene knockdown of SLC30A2 in mammary epithelial cells reduced zinc secretion, illustrating the role of ZnT-2 in zinc secretion from this cell type. Expression of the H54R mutant in human embryonic kidney-293 cells resulted in reduced zinc secretion as a consequence of perinuclear, aggresomal accumulation, whereas co-expression of the H54R mutant and wild-type ZnT-2 did not abrogate increased zinc secretion in cells overexpressing wild-type ZnT-2 alone. Together, these data provide evidence that low milk zinc concentration in some women is a consequence of a genetic disorder resulting from a mutation in SLC30A2 and can result in neonatal zinc deficiency if unrecognized. Further studies are needed to evaluate the incidence and penetrance of this mutation in the human population.

Further studies are needed to evaluate the incidence and penetrance of this mutation in the human population. Zinc is an essential trace mineral and zinc deficiency can lead to dermatitis, alopecia, decreased growth, and impaired immune function (1Aggett P.J. Harries J.T. Arch. Dis. Child. 1979; 54: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Infants are particularly vulnerable because of the large amount of zinc required for growth during this period. Breast milk normally contains adequate zinc to meet the requirement for infants up to 4-6 months of age (2Krebs N.F. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 358S-360SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, numerous reports have documented transient or acquired neonatal zinc deficiency in breast-fed infants (3Aggett P.J. Atherton D.J.

Genet. 2003; 113: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) as a consequence of low milk zinc concentration in their nursing mothers, which cannot be corrected by maternal zinc supplementation (4Parker P.H. Helinek G.L. Meneely R.L. Stroop S. Ghishan F.K. Greene H.L. Am. J. Dis. Child. 1982; 136: 77-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 5Weymouth R.D. Kelly R. Lansdell B.J. Aust. Paediatr. J. 1982; 18: 208-210PubMed Google Scholar). Although the etiology of this disorder is unknown, it is presumably the result of an inherited genetic condition (zinc in breast milk, reduced; OMIM 608118) and elegantly highlights the interplay between genetics and nutrition. Transient neonatal zinc deficiency resembles some aspects of two previously identified genetic defects in mammalian zinc metabolism, acrodermatitis enteropathica (AE 2The abbreviations used are: AE, acrodermatitis enteropathica; HA, hemagglutinin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; HEK, human embryonic kidney; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. ; Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) 201100) in humans and the lethal milk mutation (lm/lm; OMIM 602095) in mice. Acrodermatitis enteropathica is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder that results in severe zinc deficiency as a consequence of impaired intestinal zinc absorption (8Atherton D.J. Muller D.P. Aggett P.J. Harries J.T. Clin. Sci. (Lond.). 1979; 56: 505-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) due to mutations in SLC39A4, which encodes the zinc importer Zip4 (9Wang K. Zhou B. Kuo Y.M. Zemansky J. Gitschier J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 71: 66-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 10Kury S. Dreno B. Bezieau S. Giraudet S. Kharfi M. Kamoun R. Moisan J.P. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 239-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Lethal milk mice (lm-/lm-) have a mutation in SLC30A4 resulting in early translational termination and truncation of the zinc transporter ZnT-4 (11Huang L. Gitschier J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), which is associated with reduced milk zinc concentration and neonatal zinc deficiency in pups nursed from afflicted dams (12Piletz J.E. Ganschow R.E. Science. 1978; 199: 181-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, transient neonatal zinc deficiency in humans is different from both conditions. Unlike infants with AE, zinc absorption in infants with transient neonatal zinc deficiency is normal (3Aggett P.J. Atherton D.J. More J. Davey J. Delves H.T. Harries J.T. Arch. Dis. Child. 1980; 55: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and symptomatic zinc deficiency only exists during exclusive nursing, suggesting the genetic defect and corresponding phenotype is maternal in presentation. Thus, infants with transient neonatal zinc deficiency do not require zinc supplementation following weaning, whereas AE patients require lifelong zinc supplementation. Unfortunately, transient neonatal zinc deficiency is often misdiagnosed as AE, which can have severe health implications as zinc oversupplementation can induce copper deficiency and immune dysfunction (13Sandström B. Cederblad Å. Lindblad B.S. Lönnerdal B. Arch. Pediatr. Adolesc. Med. 1994; 148: 980-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), further highlighting the importance of adequately diagnosing and treating this disorder as early as possible. Transient neonatal zinc deficiency in humans is also clinically distinct from symptoms in lm-/lm- mice in that no maternal symptoms, other than low breast milk zinc concentration, have been reported in affected humans, whereas lm-/lm- mice develop zinc deficiency with age (14Erway L.C. Grider Jr., A J. Hered. 1984; 75: 480-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and lack utricular otoconia, resulting in abnormalities in the balance system (14Erway L.C. Grider Jr., A J. Hered. 1984; 75: 480-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Moreover, no mutations in SLC30A4 were found in two affected individuals by Michalczyk et al. (7Michalczyk A. Varigos G. Catto-Smith A. Blomeley R.C. Ackland M.L. Hum. Genet. 2003; 113: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), suggesting that the human homologue of SLC30A4 is not affected in mothers of infants with transient neonatal zinc deficiency. Consequently, we speculate that transient neonatal zinc deficiency in humans is unique from these two previously reported genetic disorders in mammalian zinc metabolism and results from a mutation in another zinc transporter with yet undefined function. Toward this end, we have previously documented SLC30A2 (ZnT-2) and SLC39A3 (Zip3) expression in the mammary gland of lactating rats and determined that changes in ZnT-2 and Zip3 protein abundance parallel changes in milk zinc concentration (15Kelleher S.L. Lönnerdal B. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 3378-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have characterized the reliance upon Zip3 for zinc uptake in mammary epithelial cells, which taken together suggests that these genes represent likely candidates for the defective allele. We therefore hypothesized that a mutation in one of these two genes is responsible for low breast milk zinc concentration in humans leading to transient neonatal zinc deficiency. Herein, we identified a missense mutation in SLC30A2 in affected members of a family with low milk zinc concentration and demonstrated that the mutation results in perinuclear, aggresomal accumulation of the mutated form of ZnT-2 and reduced zinc secretion from transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells, indicating that a mutation in SLC30A2 may be responsible for at least some cases of transient neonatal zinc deficiency in humans. Clinical Data of Subjects—Written consent was obtained from all subjects, and the study was approved by the University of California, Davis, Institutional Review Board. Serum and milk zinc concentration was determined by independent laboratory testing and obtained from patient medical records. Zinc deficiency was diagnosed by the infants' doctors based upon clinical symptoms and confirmed by serum zinc concentration when possible. Retrospective infant dietary and treatment records were obtained by questionnaire from each infant's mother. Dietary questions included length of breast-feeding, whether infant diet included formula feeding and how often and when it was initiated, and whether nutritional supplements were given. Infant photos were taken by the mother accompanied by the date the photos were taken and were not retouched. Sequence Analysis of SLC30A2, SLC39A3, and SLC30A4—Genomic DNA was isolated from the whole blood of two women with low milk zinc concentration (Paxgene Blood DNA Kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The coding regions (including splice sites), 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions and at least 1 kb upstream of the first exon of SLC30A2, SLC39A3, and SLC30A4 (to confirm previous reports), were amplified by PCR (Invitrogen Platinum Hi Fidelity Taq and Clontech GC genomic polymerase, BD Biosciences). PCR primer information is available upon request. Both splice variants of SLC39A3 were sequenced. PCR products were subcloned into TOPO XL Vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced by the University of California, Davis, Division of Biological Sciences Automated DNA Sequencing Facility (Davis, CA). Sequence translations and analyses were performed using Bioedit software (16Hall T.A. Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 1999; 41: 95-98Google Scholar), and sequence chromatograms were visually analyzed for mutations. The Ade→Gua substitution in SLC30A2 was confirmed in each sample with duplicate PCR reactions sequenced in both directions. Sequences for human (NCBI protein identification number NP_115902), rat (NP_037022), and mouse (XP_131731) SLC30A2; human (NP_003450) and mouse (NP_035903) SLC30A3; human (NP_776250) and mouse (NP_766404) SLC30A8; and human (NP_037441), mouse (NP_035904), frog (Xenopus, AAH82626), and zebrafish (Danio, NP_956937) SLC30A4 were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI; www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Amino acid sequences were aligned with ClustalW and Boxshade. Vector Construction and Site-directed Mutagenesis of SLC30A2—Human SLC30A2 cDNA was obtained from a cDNA clone (accession number CR592804; Invitrogen). The Ade→Gua substitution was introduced by PCR mutagenesis with the primers 5′-GCCCAGAGCAACCATCACTGCCGTGCTCAGAAGGGTCCTGACAGT-3′ and 5′-ACTGTCAGGACCCTTCTGAGCACGGCAGTGATGGTTGCTCTGGGC-3′ (mutation underlined; 25 cycles at 94 °C for 20 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 5 min with Invitrogen Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase) followed by digestion of the parental strand by DpnI. The entire coding region and the 5′-untranslated region of the wild-type and mutated forms of human SLC30A2 were amplified and tagged at the C terminus with two tandem hemagglutinin (HA) epitopes by PCR using primers 5′-GAGACACGGGAGCGCTTGGC-3′ and 5′-CATCAGGCGTAGTCGGGGACGTCGTAGGGGTAGGCGTAGTCGGGGACGTCGTAGGGGTAGTCTGAGGGGCCCTGGCATGC-3′ (containing epitope tags and a terminal stop codon; 25 cycles: 94 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 2.5 min) (BD Advantage-GC Genomic PCR; BD Biosystems) and inserted into pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The site-directed mutation, orientation and fidelity of the insert, and incorporation of the epitope tag were confirmed by directed sequencing (Univeristy of California, Davis, Division of Biological Sciences Automated DNA Sequencing Facility). Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—Mouse mammary epithelial cells (HC11) abundantly express ZnT-2 and thus were used for transient knockdown of ZnT-2 expression to determine endogenous ZnT-2 function. HC11 cells were a gift from Dr. Jeffery Rosen (Houston, Texas) and used with permission of Dr. Bernd Groner (Institute for Biomedical Research, Frankfurt, Germany). HC11 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, gentamycin (50 mg/liter; Sigma), insulin (5 mg/liter; Sigma), and epidermal growth factor (10 μg/liter; Sigma) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown experiments, HC11 cells were seeded in antibiotic-free growth medium in 24-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well) for zinc uptake and secretion studies and in 6-well plates (4 × 105 cells/well) for verification of reduced ZnT-2 mRNA and protein abundance and cultured overnight until ∼50% confluent. The cells were transfected with 50 pmol (24-well plates) or 100 pmol (6-well plates) of either SLC30A2-specific (sense, 5′-CCGAGCUGCCUUCAUUCAUGUGAUU-3′; antisense, 5′-AAUCACAUGAAUGAAGGCAGCUCGG-3′) or mismatch control siRNA (sense, 5′-CCGCGUCCUUCCUUAUGUAGGAAUU-3′; antisense, 5′-AAUUCCUACAUAAGGAAGGACGCGG-3′) (Invitrogen Stealth siRNA) in antibiotic-free growth medium using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) at an oligonuceotide:transfection reagent ratio of 25:1 (according to manufacturer's specifications) for 16 h prior to experiments. SLC30A2 knockdown was verified by reduction in ZnT-2 mRNA and protein abundance by real-time reverse transcription-PCR and immunoblotting, respectively, and effects on zinc secretion were measured using 65Zn as described below. HEK-293 cells lack detectable endogenous ZnT-2 expression and thus were used for determining the effects of the H54R mutated form of ZnT-2 on zinc uptake, zinc secretion, and subcellular localization. HEK-293 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/liter; Sigma) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The cells were seeded in antibiotic-free growth medium in 6-well plates (2.5 × 106 cells/well) for protein abundance or in 24-well plates (6 × 105 cells/well) for zinc secretion, zinc uptake, and subcellular localization studies and cultured overnight until ∼95% confluent. The cells were transfected with 1.6 μg (24-well plates) or 8 μg (6-well plates) of empty pcDNA3.1 plasmid or plasmid containing wild-type or H54R mutant SLC30A2 (or equal amounts of wild-type and mutant plasmid) in serum- and antibiotic-free growth medium using Lipofectamine 2000 at a DNA:transfection reagent ratio of 1:2.5 according to the manufacturer's specifications. Transfection medium was replaced 16 h later with antibiotic-free growth medium, and cells were cultured for an additional 24 h prior to experiments. Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HEK-293 cells were seeded onto sterile glass coverslips and transfected with plasmid containing wild-type or H54R mutant SLC30A2 fused to HA as described above. After 48 h (post-transfection), the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 30 min and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 6 min. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 4% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min, and transfected ZnT-2 protein was detected following incubation with mouse anti-HA antibody conjugated to Alexa 488 (Invitrogen; 1:250 in PBS with 4% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h. Cells were extensively washed, and nuclei were stained with TOPRO Nuclear Stain 647 (1 μm; Invitrogen) for 30 min. No staining was observed when anti-HA antibody was omitted during the staining process (data not shown). Coverslips were mounted in ProLong Gold (Invitrogen) and sealed with nail polish. Immunofluorescent imaging was performed using a Radiance 2100 Confocal System with an argon-red diode laser (Bio-Rad). An Olympus BX50WI microscope with a X100 UPlanApo oil immersion lens was used for visualization. Digital images were captured using LaserSharp2000, version 4.1 (Bio-Rad), and saved as RGB jpeg files to maintain image quality. Immunoblotting—HEK-293 cells were transfected with the empty pcDNA3.1 plasmid, plasmid containing wild-type or H54R mutant SLC30A2, or β-galactosidase (Clontech, to monitor transfection efficiency) as described above. The cells were scraped into ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4; 1 mm EDTA; 250 mm sucrose) containing protease inhibitors (0.2 mmol/liter 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mmol/liter EDTA, 13 μmol/liter bestatin, 1.4 μmol/liter ME-64, 0.1 μmol/liter leupeptin, and 0.03 μmol/liter aprotinin; Sigma) and sonicated twice for 10 s on ice. A slow-sedimenting, post-nuclear supernatant was isolated by centrifugation for 5 min at 2000 × g at 4 °C (to pellet nuclei, cell debris, and aggregated protein), and protein concentration in the resulting cell lysate was determined by Bradford assay. Alternatively, a low speed, post-nuclear supernatant was isolated by centrifugation for 5 min at 800 × g at 4 °C (to pellet nuclei and cell debris), and the crude membrane fraction was pelleted at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting crude membrane pellet was resuspended in SDS sample buffer containing dithiothreitol (100 mm). Total cell lysate or crude membrane protein (30 μg/well) was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (100 mm dithiothreitol) and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C in 5% nonfat milk in PBST (PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20), incubated with rabbit anti-HA (0.5 μg/ml; Sigma), affinity-purified rabbit anti-ZnT-2 (2 μg/ml), rabbit anti-β-galactosidase (0.4 μg/ml; Invitrogen), or mouse anti-β-actin (1:5000; Sigma) antibodies for 1 h at room temperature and detected with either donkey anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibody (both conjugated to horseradish peroxidase). The production of the anti-ZnT-2 antibody has been described previously (17Kelleher S.L. Lönnerdal B. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 3280-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This antibody detects both wild-type and mutant ZnT-2, and the C terminus location of the ZnT-2 sequence containing the immunizing peptide sequence is distinct from the N terminus location of the mutation. Bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal Femto, Pierce) and quantified by densitometry (Quantity One, Bio-Rad). Isolation of Aggresomes—Aggresomes were isolated following the detergent insolubility method of Matsumoto et al. (18Matsumoto G. Stojanovic A. Holmberg C.I. Kim S. Morimoto R.I. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK-293 cells transfected with equal quantities of empty plasmid or plasmid containing wild-type or H54R mutant SLC30A2 were washed with PBS, scraped, and harvested by centrifugation. The cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, containing 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), vortexed, and lysed by the freeze/thaw method. Total protein was measured by Bradford assay, and 100 μg of the protein was diluted with 1 ml of 1% SDS in PBS and then loaded under vacuum onto a cellulose acetate membrane. Membranes were washed with 3 ml of 1% SDS/PBS and slightly vacuum-dried and then immunoblotted using mouse anti-HA antibody (1 μg/ml) as described above. Zinc Uptake and Secretion—Zinc uptake was measured in transfected cells treated with serum-free RPMI 1640 (HC11 cells; to assess effects of SLC30A2 knockdown) or serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (HEK-293 cells; to assess effects of H54R mutation) containing 2 μm ZnSO4 and 0.1 μCi 65Zn (2.94 mCi/mg, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM) for 30 min at 37 °C. The medium was removed and cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS containing 1mm EDTA to remove exofacially bound 65Zn, and zinc uptake was measured in cells solubilized with 1 n NaOH. Conversely, cells were loaded with 65Zn diluted into serum-free medium containing 2 μm ZnSO4 and 65Zn (0.1 μCi) for 2.5 h. The medium was removed, and the cells were washed with prewarmed PBS and incubated with prewarmed medium without serum for up to 30 min at 37 °C. The radioactivity in the medium (zinc secretion) was measured in a γ scintillation counter (Packard Minaxi-γ; Meriden, CT). Quantification of SLC30A2 mRNA Levels by Real-time Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from HC11 cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and diluted to 1 μg/μl in RNase-free water. cDNA was generated from 1 μg of RNA by reverse transcription (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) performed at 48 °C for 30 min followed by 95 °C for 5 min. Real-time PCR was performed using the cDNA reaction mixture (1.5 μl) using the ABI 7900HT real-time thermocycler (Applied Biosystems) coupled with SYBR Green technology (Applied Biosystems) using gene-specific primers to either mouse SLC30A2 (forward, 5′-GCCCAGGAAGCCAAGTCA-3′; reverse, 5′-GAGAGCAAGA TCTAACTGGAATCTATCA-3′) or GAPDH (forward, 5′-CCACCCCAGCAAGGACACT-3′; reverse, 5′-GAAATTGTGAGGGAGATGCTCAGT-3′). Primers were designed by Primer Express (Applied Biosystems). The PCR cycling perameters were as follows: 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 1 min, followed by 95 °C for 15 s. The linearity of the dissociation curve was analyzed by ABI 7900HT software, and the mean cycle time of the linear part of the curve was designated Ct. Each sample was analyzed in duplicate and normalized to GAPDH using the equation ΔCtSLC30A2 = CtSLC30A2 - CtGAPDH. The fold change in the SLC30A2 expression of cells transfected with SLC30A2-specific siRNA relative to control siRNA was calculated using the following equation: 2(ΔΔCtSLC30A2), where ΔΔ CtSLC30A2 = mean δCtSLC30A2 of control - mean δCtSLC30A2 of SLC30A2-specific knockdown. Values represent mean fold change ± S.D., relative to control (set to 100%). Infants of subjects II:8 and III:3 (Fig. 1) were both delivered at term and exclusively breast-fed for five months. Both infants (subjects III:8 and IV:1) developed severe zinc deficiency (serum zinc concentration in infant III:8, 0.66 mg of zinc/liter at 24 weeks of age; normal range, 0.82 ± 0.03 mg of zinc/liter) (19Kasperek K. Feinendegen L.E. Lombeck I. Bremer H.J. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1977; 126: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Individuals II:8 and III:3 had low milk zinc concentration (II:8, 0.26 mg of zinc/liter, week 24 of lactation; III:3, 0.23 mg zinc/liter, week 15 of lactation; normal range, 1.0-1.5 mg of zinc/liter at 3-6 months of lactation (20Krebs N.F. Reidinger C.J. Hartley S. Robertson A.D. Hambidge K.M. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1995; 61: 1030-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar); however, serum zinc concentration in these women was normal (II:8, 1.0 mg of zinc/liter). Prior to zinc supplementation, alopecia and severe dermatitis were visible on the head, back, face (Fig. 2, A-C), and perigenital area (not shown) of infant III:8. Infant IV:1 presented with similar rashes starting at three months of age (images not shown). Dermatitis improved significantly in both affected infants within one week following the initiation of zinc supplementation (Fig. 2D), and the cessation of zinc supplementation following weaning did not lead to a relapse of zinc deficiency in either infant, excluding AE as a possible diagnosis. No consistent or remarkable symptoms other than neonatal zinc deficiency were reported in any other family member. These symptoms and clinical data are consistent with other reported cases of transient neonatal zinc deficiency due to low milk zinc concentration in exclusively breast-fed infants.FIGURE 2Photographs of an affected infant with transient neonatal zinc deficiency.

(7Michalczyk A. Varigos G. Catto-Smith A. Blomeley R.C. Ackland M.L. Hum. Genet. 2003; 113: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we found no mutations predicted to affect protein expression or function in SLC30A4 nor did we find any mutations in SLC39A3. However, sequence analysis of SLC30A2 in the two affected women (II:8 and III:3) determined that they were heterozygous for a missense mutation in exon 2 of SLC30A2, which substituted an adenine for guanine (Ade→Gua) and resulted in a change of histidine to arginine at amino acid position 54 (H54R) (Fig. 3A). Subsequent genomic analysis of subjects II:2 and II:6 identified them as heterozygotes as well, whereas subject II:4 was not examined, as she did not nurse her child, thus eliminating the possibility of examining her phenotype. The H54R mutation resides in a histidine-rich region conserved across human, mouse, and rat SLC30A2 and human and mouse SLC30A3 and SLC30A8 (Fig. 3B) and is not present in either the NCBI single nucleotide polymorphisms or expressed sequence tag data bases (data not shown). Topology prediction of ZnT-2 using the proteomic base server TopPred (21Claros M.G. von Heijne G. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 685-686PubMed Google Scholar) predicts that this mutation resides within the N-terminal region immediately upstream from the first transmembrane domain and is localized intracellularly (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4Predicted topology of ZnT-2 indicating the location of the H54R mutation.

Toward this end, HC11 cells were transiently transfected with SLC30A2-specific siRNA, which successfully reduced ZnT-2 mRNA and protein expression (Fig. 5, A and B) and resulted in decreased zinc efflux (Fig. 5C). No difference was observed in zinc uptake due to SLC30A2 knockdown (Fig. 5D), indicating that ZnT-2 mediates zinc secretion from the mammary epithelial cell and that abrogation of zinc secretion following ZnT-2 knockdown is not due to impaired zinc uptake. To determine the effects of the H54R mutation on zinc secretion, HEK-293 cells were transfected with empty pcDNA3.1 plasmid or plasmid containing wild-type or mutant SLC30A2. HEK-293 cells transfected with wild-type SLC30A2 secreted ∼30% more zinc relative to cells transfected with empty plasmid and cells transfected with the H54R mutant SLC30A2 (Fig. 6). There was no difference in zinc uptake (data not shown) in cells transfected with either wild-type or mutant SLC30A2 compared with cells transfected with empty plasmid, indicating that increased zinc secretion in cells transfected with wild-type SLC30A2 is not due to increased zinc uptake. To determine whether expression of the mutant allele is a dominant negative mutation that impairs expression or function of wild-type ZnT-2 protein, HEK-293 cells were co-transfected with plasmids containing the wild-type and H54R mutant SLC30A2, and effects on zinc secretion were determined. Our data document that co-expression of wild-type and H54R mutant ZnT-2 did not abrogate increased zinc secretion observed in cells overexpressing wild-type ZnT-2 alone (Fig. 7) and sug"
https://openalex.org/W1983873312,"Melanoma causes the greatest number of skin cancer-related deaths worldwide. Despite intensive research, prevention and early detection are the only effective measures against melanoma, so new therapeutic strategies are necessary for the management of this devastating disease. Here, we evaluated the efficacy of cannabinoid receptor agonists, a new family of potential antitumoral compounds, at skin melanoma. Human melanomas and melanoma cell lines express CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors. Activation of these receptors decreased growth, proliferation, angiogenesis and metastasis, and increased apoptosis, of melanomas in mice. Cannabinoid antimelanoma activity was independent of the immune status of the animal, could be achieved without overt psychoactive effects and was selective for melanoma cells vs. normal melanocytes. Cannabinoid antiproliferative action on melanoma cells was due, at least in part, to cell cycle arrest at the G1-S transition via inhibition of the prosurvival protein Akt and hypophosphorylation of the pRb retinoblastoma protein tumor suppressor. These findings may contribute to the design of new chemotherapeutic strategies for the management of melanoma."

https://openalex.org/W2002351008,"High mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) is a chromatin component leaked out by necrotic cells and actively secreted by activated myeloid cells. The extracellular protein is a potent mediator of tissue remodeling. We show here that human atherosclerotic plaques, but not normal arteries, produce extracellular HMGB1. Secreted HMGB1 originates from endothelial cells, by neointimal foam cells, and also smooth muscle cells (SMCs). SMCs are an unexpected source for secreted HMGB1, since they normally express much lower amounts of HMGB1 than other cells types, and they do not secrete it. However, cultured SMCs actively secrete HMGB1 after cholesterol loading. In turn, in response to HMGB1, SMCs proliferate, migrate, and secrete more HMGB1. Thus, SMCs are both a source and a target of HMGB1; blocking HMGB1 secretion by SMCs can be an important strategy for treatment of atherosclerotic disease and in particular restenosis."
https://openalex.org/W2040416423,"RuvBL1 is an evolutionarily highly conserved eukaryotic protein belonging to the AAA+-family of ATPases (ATPase associated with diverse cellular activities). It plays important roles in essential signaling pathways such as the c-Myc and Wnt pathways in chromatin remodeling, transcriptional and developmental regulation, and DNA repair and apoptosis. Herein we present the three-dimensional structure of the selenomethionine variant of human RuvBL1 refined using diffraction data to 2.2Å of resolution. The crystal structure of the hexamer is formed of ADP-bound RuvBL1 monomers. The monomers contain three domains, of which the first and the third are involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis. Although it has been shown that ATPase activity of RuvBL1 is needed for several in vivo functions, we could only detect a marginal activity with the purified protein. Structural homology and DNA binding studies demonstrate that the second domain, which is unique among AAA+ proteins and not present in the bacterial homolog RuvB, is a novel DNA/RNA-binding domain. We were able to demonstrate that RuvBL1 interacted with single-stranded DNA/RNA and double-stranded DNA. The structure of the RuvBL1·ADP complex, combined with our biochemical results, suggest that although RuvBL1 has all the structural characteristics of a molecular motor, even of an ATP-driven helicase, one or more as yet undetermined cofactors are needed for its enzymatic activity.

RuvBL1 is also an essential component of the human histone acetylase/chromatin-remodeling complex TIP60 (3Ikura T. Ogryzko V.V. Grigoriev M. Groisman R. Wang J. Horikoshi M. Scully R. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar), which consists of at least 14 distinct subunits and displays histone acetylase activity on chromatin, ATPase, DNA helicase, and structural DNA binding activities. Generally, chromatin-remodeling complexes regulate chromatin structure and are critical for DNA-based transactions in the cell (10Teixeira M.T. Dujon B. Fabre E. J. Mol.

Acetylation of nucleosomal histones leads to relaxation of chromatin structure, thus enabling various transcription factors to gain access to chromatin and to interact with DNA (12Stein G.S. Zaidi S.K. Braastad C.D. Montecino M. van Wijnen A.J. Choi J.Y. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. Javed A.

As part of a chromatin-remodeling complex, yeast Rvb1p regulates the transcription of more than 5% of yeast genes (5Jonsson Z.O. Dhar S.K. Narlikar G.J. Auty R. Wagle N. Pellman D. Pratt R.E.

The identification of RuvBL1 in the human RNA polymerase II holoenzyme complex (6Qiu X.B. Lin Y.L. Thome K.C. Pian P. Schlegel B.P. Weremowicz S. Parvin J.D. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27786-27793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) is an additional hint at a role in transcriptional processes. Two major oncogenic pathways in mammalian cells critically depend on RuvBL1, one involving c-Myc and another, β-catenin. RuvBL1 interacts with c-Myc and constitutes an essential cofactor for oncogenic transformation by c-Myc (14Wood M.A. McMahon S.B. Cole M.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 321-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) for c-Myc- and E2F1-dependent apoptosis (15Dugan K.A. Wood M.A. Cole M.D. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5835-5843Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and for E1A-dependent oncogenic transformation (9Fuchs M. Gerber J. Drapkin R. Sif S. Ikura T. Ogryzko V. Lane W.S. Nakatani Y. Livingston D.M. Cell. 2001; 106: 297-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). By binding to β-catenin, RuvBL1 regulates the Wnt signaling pathway and affects β-catenin/T-cell factor-controlled transcription (7Bauer A. Chauvet S. Huber O. Usseglio F. Rothbacher U. Aragnol D. Kemler R. Pradel J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6121-6130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RuvBL1 and the TIP60 histone acetyl transferase interact with sequences in the regulatory region of the ITF-2 gene, a T-cell factor downstream target. Stable expression of an ATPase-deficient RuvBL1 mutant (D302N) blocks expression of endogenous β-catenin/T-cell factor target genes, which was linked to inhibition of histone acetylation near β-catenin target gene sequences, suggesting that RuvBL1 mediates its transcriptional effects through local chromatin modifications (16Feng Y. Lee N. Fearon E.R. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8726-8734PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, RuvBL1 appears to be involved in small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein particle assembly, nucleolar localization, and trafficking (17Newman D.R. Kuhn J.F. Shanab G.M. Maxwell E.S. RNA. 2000; 6: 861-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 18King T.H. Decatur W.A. Bertrand E. Maxwell E.S. Fournier M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7731-7746Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The repertoire of RuvBL1 functions was furthermore extended by observations that RuvBL1 is associated with the mitotic spindle and the centrosomes via interactions with tubulin (19Gartner W. Rossbacher J. Zierhut B. Daneva T. Base W. Weissel M. Waldhausl W. Pasternack M.S. Wagner L. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2003; 56: 79-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These results suggest that RuvBL1 may play an important role in mitosis. RuvBL1 belongs to a large family of ATPases known as AAA+ proteins (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) (20Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) including nucleic acid-processing enzymes, chaperones, and proteases. AAA+ proteins generally form hexameric ring structures and contain conserved motifs for ATP binding and hydrolysis like the Walker A (P-loop) and Walker B box (21Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Donchenko A.P. Blinov V.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4713-4730Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 23Patel S. Latterich M. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 65-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the Arg finger, and sensor residues. All AAA+ proteins use ATP binding and/or hydrolysis to exert mechanical forces, but the details of how nucleotides trigger conformational changes within individual subunits are still not completely elucidated. RuvBL1 is the eukaryotic homologue of the bacterial DNA-dependent ATPase and helicase RuvB (24Putnam C.D. Clancy S.B. Tsuruta H. Gonzalez S. Wetmur J.G. Tainer J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 25Yamada K. Kunishima N. Mayanagi K. Ohnishi T. Nishino T. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Muller B. West S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1315-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In this work we have solved and refined the three-dimensional structure of the selenomethionine variant of human RuvBL1 co-purified with ADP using diffraction data to 2.2 Å of resolution. We furthermore carried out ATPase, helicase, and nucleic acid binding assays with purified RuvBL1. Protein Purification—The recombinant His-FLAG tagged RuvBL1 used for structure determination was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). This strain was used for production of both the native RuvBL1 and the selenomethionine-substituted RuvBL1. For biochemical studies we used both Hi5 insect cells and E. coli as hosts for protein expression after making sure by using mass spectrometry that no post-translational modifications occurred in the eukaryotic system. RuvBL1 was purified as previously described (27Gorynia S. Matias P.M. Gonçalves S. Coelho R. Thomaz M. Haendler B. Donner P. Carrondo M.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F. 2006; 62: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). To obtain the His-tagged domain II construct of RuvBL1, we cloned amino acids Leu-122 to Val-238 into the pET15b vector. The DII construct was purified with a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. Crystallization—Crystals of RuvBL1 were obtained at 20 °C within 2 days by the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique. Crystallization drops were mixed from equal volumes of protein solution (15 mg/ml selenomethionine RuvBL1, 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and reservoir solution (1.6 m sodium malonate, pH 6.0). Co-crystallization with Mg2+ or nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs as well as with DNA of different lengths was tried but was unsuccessful. Although RuvBL1 binds nucleic acids (see below), co-crystallization was not achieved, possibly due to the existence of a mixture of different states. Structure Determination of RuvBL1—A crystal of selenomethionine RuvBL1 was flash-frozen under a stream of nitrogen gas at 100 K using 2.0 m sodium malonate at pH 6.0 as a cryoprotecting buffer. Diffraction data were collected at European Synchrotron Radiation Facility beamline ID14-4 using an ADSC Quantum 4 detector at a wavelength corresponding to the maximal value of f″ from the selenium atoms near the x-ray absorption K-edge and were processed to 2.2 Å of resolution with XDS (28Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3243) Google Scholar). Final data scaling, merging, and intensity conversion to structure factor amplitudes were carried out with SCALA and TRUNCATE in the CCP4 program package (29Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The crystals were hexagonal and belonged to the space group P6 with unit-cell parameters a = b = 207.1 Å and c = 60.7 Å, with three molecules in the asymmetric unit. A summary of the data collection statistics is listed in Table 1. The structure was solved by using the Single-Wavelength Anomalous dispersion method as previously described (27Gorynia S. Matias P.M. Gonçalves S. Coelho R. Thomaz M. Haendler B. Donner P. Carrondo M.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F. 2006; 62: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The initial RuvBL1 model was built with O (30Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) and Turbo-FRODO (31Roussel A. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Cambillau C. XV IUCr Congress Abstracts. International Union of Crystallography Bordeaux, France1990: 66-67Google Scholar). Clear density was visible in the electron density maps for an ADP molecule per monomer. The structure was refined with REFMAC (32Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) using weak non-crystallographic symmetry restraints between the three independent monomers and Translation/Libration/Screw (TLS) rigid body refinement (33Schomaker V. Trueblood K.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B. 1968; 24: 63-76Crossref Google Scholar) before restrained refinement of atomic positions and thermal motion parameters. One rigid body was defined for each of the three domains in each independent monomer. In the final refinement, 158 water molecules, located with Arp/wArp (34Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1993; 49: 129-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were included in the model, individual restrained B-factors were refined for all non-hydrogen atoms, and hydrogen atoms were included in calculated positions. The final values of R and Rfree were 0.206 and 0.257, respectively. The maximum likelihood estimate of overall coordinate error was 0.15 Å. Because their electron density could not be seen, the following residues are absent from the final model: 1-8, 142-155, 248-276, and 450-456 in monomer A, 1-10, 142-154, 245-278, and 449-456 in monomer B, and 1-7, 129-230, 247-276, and 450-456 in monomer C. Also, zero occupancy was given to 26 atoms in monomer A, 48 in monomer B, and 75 in monomer C. The main refinement statistics are presented in Table 1. The structure was analyzed with PROCHECK (35Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), and its stereochemical quality parameters were within their respective confidence intervals. The number of protein residues outside the most favored regions for non-glycine and non-proline residues in a Ramachandran (36Ramachandran G.N. Sasisekharan V. Adv. Prot. Chem. 1968; 23: 283-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2770) Google Scholar) φ,Φ plot was 4 (Ala-217, Glu-218, Glu-342, Thr-401) in 349 for monomer A, 3 (Gln-34, Glu-342, and Thr-401) in 344 for monomer B, and 2 (Glu-342 and Thr-401) in 273 for monomer C. The unusual φ,Φ conformation of Thr-401 appears to be supported by its well defined electron density in the three independent monomers. However, the remaining outliers are located in regions with relatively poor electron density. The final coordinates have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (37Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z.

Molecular masses of 50 kDa (RuvBL1) and 90 kDa (SV40) were used to calculate moles of hydrolyzed ATP/mol of protein. Nucleic Acid Binding Assay—Diverse nucleotide oligomers (60-mer, 5′-CAGGCATGCAAGCTTGGCACTGGCCGTCGTTTTACAACGTCGTGACTGGGAAAACCCTGG-3′; 56-mer, 5′-TCCCAGTCACGACGTTGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTGCCAAGCTTGCATGCCTGAAATT-3′; 51-mer, 5′-AAAAAGTCGACTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGTACCGAGCTCGAATTCGAAAAAA-3′; 41-mer, 5′-AAAAAACAGUCACGACGUUGUAAAACGACGGCCAGAAAAUU-3′) labeled with 33P were used as ssDNA/RNA substrates. To generate a dsDNA substrate, the labeled 60-mer was annealed to its complementary oligonucleotide. Binding reactions were performed in a final volume of 15 μl. Nucleic acids (1 pmol) were incubated with 10 pmol of purified protein in binding buffer (15 mm HEPES, pH 6.7, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 500 μm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm MgCl2) for 30 min at room temperature. Hi-Density Tris borate EDTA (TBE) sample buffer (Invitrogen) was added to the reaction, and the sample was separated by a 6% PAGE with 0.5 × TBE buffer and visualized by autoradiography. BSA was used as the negative control. DNA Helicase Assay—Diverse dsDNA substrates and a DNA/RNA hybrid were generated to test helicase activities. To this effect, the ssDNA plasmid M13mp18 was annealed with diverse complementary oligonucleotides. Not only usual dsDNA substrates were tested but also substrates mimicking intermediates of DNA repair and transcription (a DNA/RNA hybrid and looped DNA). The M13mp18 substrates were labeled with the Klenow Enzyme using [α-33P]ATP. In addition a 60-mer oligonucleotide (see “Nucleic Acid Binding Assay” under “Experimental Procedures”) was labeled at the 3′ end and annealed with two different complementary 57-mer oligonucleotides (5′-TTTAAACCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGACGTTGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTGCCAAGCTT-3′ and 5′-TCCCAGTCACGACGTTGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTGCCAAGCTTGCATGCCTGAAATT-3′). One resulting partial duplex DNA had a 3′ overhang, and the other one a 5′ overhang. The DNA helicase assay was performed in a final volume of 20 μl. The reaction mixture, composed of purified protein and 0.1 pmol of dsDNA substrate in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 25 μg/ml BSA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP), was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 5 μl of sample buffer containing 1% SDS and 50 mm EDTA. Subsequently, the sample was separated by a 10% PAGE with 1 × Tris borate EDTA buffer and visualized by autoradiography. SV40 large tumor antigen helicase was used as a positive control. Structure of the RuvBL1 Monomer—The crystal structure of RuvBL1 was solved from the P6 crystal form described previously (27Gorynia S. Matias P.M. Gonçalves S. Coelho R. Thomaz M. Haendler B. Donner P. Carrondo M.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F. 2006; 62: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) with data at 2.2 Å of resolution, showing an overall hexameric molecule where each monomer appears complexed with one ADP unit. The RuvBL1 monomer has approximate dimensions of 75 × 55 × 45 Å and contains 14 α-helices, 16 β-strands, and two 310-helices (Fig. 1, A and B). These structural elements fold into three domains (DI, DII, and DIII; Fig. 1B). DI consists of amino acids 1-120 and 296-365 with DII inserted in between and contains 6 α-helices (α1-α4, α1′, α5′), 9 β-strands (β1-β5; β1′-β4′), and 2 very short 310-helices. This domain is a triangle-shaped nucleotide binding domain with a Rossmann-like α/β/α-fold composed of a core β-sheet consisting of five parallel β-strands with two flanking α-helices on each side (Fig. 1B). The loop between β1 and α2 is the conserved P-loop (Walker A motif), which functions to bind and orient the γ-phosphate of ATP for hydrolysis. In addition, the conserved Walker B motif as well as the sensor 1 and the arginine finger for the adjacent molecule in the hexamer are also present. A succinct structural comparison between the Rossmannfold (DI) of RuvBL1 and that of other AAA+ proteins is shown in Table 2. The core five-stranded β-sheet is similar to the AAA+ module of other AAA+ family members, such as RuvB (branch migration) (24Putnam C.D. Clancy S.B. Tsuruta H. Gonzalez S. Wetmur J.G. Tainer J.A. J.

A striking difference, however, is that in RuvBL1 the Walker A and Walker B motifs are separated by ∼170 amino acids, whereas in the other molecules they are closely spaced. The ∼170-amino acid residue insertion between α3 and β3 (Fig. 1, A and 1B) constitutes the novel domain, which appears to be unique to RuvBL1 by data base searches (24Putnam C.D. Clancy S.B. Tsuruta H. Gonzalez S. Wetmur J.G. Tainer J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). A three-dimensional structure search in the DALI server (44Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar) revealed that the spatial arrangement of the seven β-strands (β6-β12) resembles that of the DNA binding domains of different proteins involved in DNA metabolism, such as the highly conserved eukaryotic protein replication protein A (RPA, PDB 1JMC). The DALI Z-score was 4.9, with a 2.9-Å r.m.s. deviation for the 69 superimposed Cα atoms in the ∼170-residue-long RuvBL1 domain II and the 238-residue-long RPA. In the superposed regions the sequence identity was 19%. The structure of RPA (45Bochkarev A. Pfuetzner R.A. Edwards A.M. Frappier L. Nature. 1997; 385: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) is composed of two domains with a similar fold, each formed by seven β-strands. A ssDNA molecule is bound to this protein and makes contacts mainly through the phosphate backbone with both domains. The presumed DNA binding region in RuvBL1 DII (residues 127-233) was superimposed with the N-terminal (residues 183-298) domain of RPA. This procedure gave r.m.s. deviation values of 0.75 Å for 33 matched Cα atoms less than 1.5 Å apart. The Cα traces of the superimposed structures are represented in Fig. 2A. In addition, the surface charges in the DNA binding region of RuvBL1 DII resemble those of the N-terminal domain (Fig. 2, B and C) in RPA. Our DNA binding experiments confirm that DII represents a new functional domain of eukaryotic AAA+ motor proteins important for DNA/RNA binding.TABLE 2Superposition of Rossmann fold (DI) in RuvBL1 with that of other AAA+ proteinsMolecule namePDB codeQuaternary structure in crystalWalker A regionr.m.s. deviation CαNumber of Cα fit in DIRuvBL12C9OHexamerGPPGTGKTALAAA+ Domain PspF2C98MonomerGERGTGKELI0.8871RuvB1IN7MonomerGPPGTGKTTL0.7565NSF-D21D2NHexamerGPPHSGKTAL0.9547SV40 Ltag helicase1SVLHexamerGPIDSGKTTL0.9747E1 Papillomavirus2GXAHexamerGPPNTGKSML1.0042BΦ12 ATPase P41W44HexamerGKGNSGKTPL1.0848 Open table in a new tab The smaller third domain, DIII, is all α-helical (α5-α9). One remarkable feature of DIII is that four helices (α5-α8) form a bundle located near the “P-loop,” important for ATP binding, in which α5 and the beginning of α7 covers the ATP binding pocket at the interface of DI and DIII. This domain is similar to DII in RuvB (Fig. 1, B and C). The spatial arrangement of DI, DII, and DIII in RuvBL1 could allow motions between domains. Structure of the RuvBL1 Hexamer—RuvBL1 assembles into an hexameric structure with a central channel (Fig. 3, A and B). In the crystal structure there are three independent monomers (A, B, and C) and two crystallographically non-equivalent hexamers. One hexamer is centered on a crystallographic 6-fold axis and is formed by the 6-fold repetition of monomer A, whereas the other is centered on a crystallographic 3-fold axis and is formed by the 3-fold repetition of monomers B and C. The three independent monomers have very similar three-dimensional structures. Superposition calculations between the three monomers by least-squares fit between pairs of Cα atoms not more than 1.5 Å apart gave r.m.s. deviations between Cα atoms of 0.47 Å between monomers A and B, 0.58 Å between monomers A and C, and 0.43 Å between monomers B and C. The total number of matched pairs Cα atoms was 300, 303, and 290, respectively, and these were mostly located in DI and DIII. Domain II had a similar fold but different orientations in monomers A and B and was highly disordered in monomer C. Viewed from the top (Fig. 3B, with top and bottom as defined in Fig. 3A), the"
https://openalex.org/W2046990824,"The transcription factor complex hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) plays a crucial role in cellular adaptation to low oxygen availability. O2-dependent HIF prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) modify HIF-1α, which is sent to proteasomal degradation under normoxia. Reduced activity of PHDs under hypoxia allows stabilization of HIF-1α and induction of HIF-1 target gene expression. Like hypoxia, nitric oxide (NO) was found to inhibit normoxic PHD activity leading to HIF-1α accumulation. In contrast under hypoxia, NO reduced HIF-1α levels due to enhanced PHD activity. Herein, we studied the role of NO in regulating PHD expression and the consequences thereof for HIF-1α degradation. We report a biphasic response of HIF-1α and PHDs to NO treatment both under normoxia and hypoxia. In the early phase, NO inhibits PHD activity that leads to HIF-1α accumulation, whereas in the late phase, increased PHD levels reduce HIF-1α. NO induces expression of PHD2 and -3 mRNA and protein under normoxia and hypoxia in a strictly HIF-1-dependent manner. NO-treated cells with elevated PHD levels displayed delayed HIF-1α accumulation and accelerated degradation of HIF-1α upon reoxygenation. Subsequent suppression of PHD2 and -3 expression using small interfering RNA revealed that PHD2 was exclusively responsible for regulating HIF-1α degradation under NO treatment.

Shortage of oxygen, hypoxia, requires the initiation of adaptive mechanisms of cells to either improve transport of oxygen to tissues or to ensure sufficient ATP generation through glycolytic pathways (1Wenger R.H. Stiehl D.P. Camenisch G. Sci. STKE 2005. 2005; : re12Google Scholar). Central for the adaptation to hypoxia is the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), 2The abbreviations used are: HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; NO, nitric oxide; PHD, prolyl hydroxylase; GSNO, S-nitrosoglutathione; Hyp-564, hydroxylated proline 564 of HIF-1α; siRNA, short interfering RNA; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein. which up-regulates the expression of genes in control of angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, and glycolysis. HIF-1 is composed of an O2-regulated α-subunit (HIF-1α) and a constitutive β-subunit (HIF-1β). Two other orthologs of HIF-1α, termed HIF-2α and HIF-3α, as well as HIF-1β (identical to the previously described aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator Arnt) are members of the large family of basic helix-loop-helix-Per-Arnt-Sim transcription factors (2Wang G.L.

In addition to regulating HIF-1α protein stability, transcriptional activity of HIF-1α is regulated by hydroxylation of the Asn-803 residue within the C-terminal trans-activating domain of HIF-1α by the asparagyl hydroxylase named factor inhibiting HIF (FIH-1) (10Mahon P.C.

Recent studies indicate that under normoxic conditions, chemically diverse NO donors, enhanced NO formation from inducible NO-synthase, or NO formation in a coculture system induced HIF-1α stabilization and transcriptional activation of HIF-1 target gene expression (23Kimura H.

However, under hypoxic conditions, NO appears to have an opposite role in regulating HIF-1α, because several NO donors were found to decrease HIF-1α stabilization and HIF-1 transcriptional activation (29Liu Y.

It was reported that mitochondria play a role in NO regulation of HIF expression under hypoxia (32Agani F.H. Puchowicz M. Chavez J.C. Pichiule P. LaManna J. Am. J.

Science. 2003; 302: 1975-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar) proposed that mitochondrial oxygen consumption was reduced by NO inhibition of the cytochrome c oxidase. This would leave more oxygen for PHDs to regain activity and increase the degradation of HIF-1α. Alternatively, the inhibitory effect of NO on hypoxia-induced HIF-1α was explained by increased NO-derived species and/or reactive oxygen species that contribute to destabilization of HIF-1α by reactivation of PHD activity (36Wellman T.L. Jenkins J. Penar P.L. Tranmer B. Zahr R. Lounsbury K.M. FASEB J. 2003; 18: 379-381PubMed Google Scholar, 37Callapina M. Zhou J. Schnitzer S. Metzen E. Lohr C. Deitmer J.W. Brune B. Exp.

In addition, calcium and calpain were found to contribute to the degradation of HIF-1α by NO under hypoxia (39Zhou J. Kohl R. Herr B. Frank R. Brune B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1549-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Interestingly, NO increased the activity of PHDs that were inhibited by hypoxia-mimicking agents like CoCl2 (40Wang F. Sekine H. Kikuchi Y. Takasaki C. Miura C. Heiwa O. Shuin T. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Sogawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Herein we report a biphasic effect of NO on HIF-1α by (i) early induction through inhibition of PHD activity and (ii) later reduction by increased PHD2 protein amounts. Independently from other proposed mechanisms, we identified the induction of PHD2 as an underlying mechanism of NO-induced degradation of HIF-1α. Reagents—S-Nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) was synthesized as described previously (24Sandau K.B. Fandrey J. Brune B. Blood. 2001; 97: 1009-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—The human osteosarcoma cells (U2OS) were a kind gift from J. M. Gleadle and P. Ratcliffe (Oxford, UK). U2OS cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin in a normoxic atmosphere of 21% O2, 74% N2, and 5% CO2 (by volume). For cell culture experiments, cells were either exposed to normoxia or placed in a hypoxic incubator with 1% O2, 94% N2,5% CO2 (Heraeus incubator, Hanau, Germany) for variable periods of time. In case of experiments where GSNO or MG132 were added under hypoxic conditions (1% O2, 94% N2,5%CO2)a hypoxic work station (Invivo2 400, Ruskinn, Leicester, UK) was used. Western Blot Analysis—Whole cell protein extracts were prepared from 35-mm dishes of cells that were about 80% confluent. Cells were lysed in 50 μl of extraction buffer (300 mm sodium chloride, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1× protease inhibitor mixture) (Roche Applied Science) for 20 min on ice and centrifuged (3600 × g at 4 °C for 5 min). The supernatant was used as whole cell extract. The protein concentration was determined with a commercial protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). 70 μg of protein/lane were loaded onto a 7.5% or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and after electrophoresis blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. As primary antibodies, a mouse monoclonal anti-HIF-1α (diluted 1:750; Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA), a mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin (diluted 1:750; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany), a rabbit polyclonal anti-PHD2 (diluted 1:3000; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), and a rabbit polyclonal anti-PHD1 (diluted 1:1000; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) were used. The mouse monoclonal anti-PHD3 antibody (diluted 1:20) and the rabbit polyclonal antibody against hydroxylated proline 564 of HIF-1α (Hyp-564; diluted 1:1000) were a kind gift from P.

Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1,000,000 dilution; Sigma) were used as secondary antibodies. ECL Western blotting system (Amersham Biosciences) was used for detection. Reverse Transcription and Quantitative Real Time PCR— Total RNA was extracted using the guanidinium isothiocyanate method from 6-well dishes as described previously (43Stolze I. Berchner-Pfannschmidt U. Freitag P. Wotzlaw C. Rossler J. Frede S. Acker H. Fandrey J. Blood. 2002; 100: 2623-2628Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). 1 μg total RNA was reverse transcribed with oligo(dT) and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). Human PHD1, -2, and -3 cDNAs and the cDNA of the housekeeping gene 60 S acidic ribosomal protein was quantified by real time PCR using the qPCR™ master mix for SYBR Green I (Eurogentec, Verviers, Belgium) and the GeneAmp5700 sequence Detection System (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The PCRs were set up in a final volume of 25 μl with 0.5 μl of cDNA in 1× reaction buffer with SYBR Green I, 10 pmol of forward primer, and 10 pmol of reverse primer. The primers used were as follows: human PHD2, forward (5′-GCACGACACCGGGAAGTT-3′) and reverse (5′-CCAGCTTCCCGTTACAGT-3′); human PHD3, forward (5′-GGCCATCAGCTTCCTCCTG-3′) and reverse (5′-GGTGATGCAGCGACCATCA-3′); human PHD1, forward (5′-GGCGATCCCGCCGCGC-3′) and reverse (5′-CCTGGGTAACACGCCCCAGCTTCCCGTACAGT-3′), and human 60 S acidic ribosomal protein, forward (5′-ACGAGGTGTGCAAGGAGGGC-3′) and reverse (5′-GCAAGTCGTCTCCCATCTGC-3′). The PCR amplification profile was as follows: 10 min at 95 °C followed by 30 cycles 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C. Agarose gel electrophoresis, purification, and DNA sequencing confirmed the identity of the PCR products. 10-Fold dilutions of purified PCR products starting at 1 pg to 0.1 fg were used as standards. The quantified cDNA of the PHDs were normalized to cDNA of the 60 S acidic ribosomal protein and expressed as normalized PHD mRNA level. All reverse transcription-PCRs were done in triplicate from RNA from three separate culture dishes. Short Interfering RNA (siRNA) Treatment—For siRNA experiments, cells were 30–50% confluent and transfected with siRNAs using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. siRNA sequence targeting HIF-1α has been described previously (44Berchner-Pfannschmidt U.

Sequences designed to suppress expression of PHD2 (sense, 5′-CAAGGUAAGUGGAGGUAUAUU-3′; antisense, 5′-UAUACCUCCACUUACCUUGUU-3′, GenBank™ accession number, EGLN1 NM_022051), PHD3 (sense, 5′-GUACUUUGAUGCUGAAGAAUU-3′; antisense, 5′-UUCUUCAGCAUCAAAGUACUU-3′; GenBank™ accession number, EGLN3 NM_022073), and luciferase (siControl nontargeting siRNA) were purchased from Dharmacon. Cells were transfected once with siRNA directed against HIF-1α (100 nm) at 24 h or twice with siRNA directed against PHD2 (10 nm) or PHD3 (2.5 nm) at 24 and 48 h. Mock control cells were subjected to transfection procedure without oligonucleotides under the same conditions. After transfection, cells were grown for 24 h and then exposed to normoxic or hypoxic atmosphere for the indicated time. Cells were lysed, and whole cell lysates were extracted as described above. Immunofluorescence and Microscopy—U2OS cells were grown on poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips in 24-well dishes overnight. Subconfluent cells were transfected with siRNA as described above and subjected to hypoxia for 6 h, fixed by ice-cold methanol/acetone (1:1) for 10 min on ice, and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS. As primary antibody, the mouse monoclonal anti-HIF-1α (diluted 1:50; Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA), and as secondary antibody an Alexa-568-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:400, Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) antibody was used as described previously (44Berchner-Pfannschmidt U.

Coverslips were mounted on the slides with Mowiol (Calbiochem). Visualization was performed with a laser-scanning microscope (LSM 510, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with a helium/neon laser. Red fluorescence of Alexa-568 was collected through a 585-nm long pass filter. The objective lens was a ×63 numerical aperture 1.40 Plan-Apochromat. Fluorescence intensities were visualized in false colors as indicated by the color table. Cell Viability—Toxicity of GSNO was excluded for 250 μm GSNO as judged from the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (45Hansen M.B. Nielsen S.E. Berg K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 119: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar). NO Induces HIF-1α Accumulation and Expression of PHD2 and -3—Considerable cell-specific and NO donor-dependent differences have been reported with respect to the effects on HIF-1α accumulation and PHD activity. We therefore first determined how 250 μm GSNO affects HIF-1α and PHD protein levels in U2OS cells. NO maximally induced HIF-1α accumulation under normoxic or hypoxic conditions within 2 h (Fig. 1, A and B). This effect appeared to be transient, since HIF-1α returned to basal levels within 4 h (Fig. 1A, 4 h). HIF-1α was maximally induced by hypoxia alone after 4 h and remained elevated during the course of the experiment. The addition of NO led to a decrease of HIF-1α, most prominently after 6 h of incubation (Fig. 1B, 6 h). Thus, NO had a biphasic effect on HIF-1α induction, with an early increase of HIF-1α followed by a later inhibition of its accumulation. PHD1 and PHD2 protein were already found in substantial amounts under normoxia, whereas PHD3 was hardly detectable (Fig. 1, A and B, 0 h). PHD2 and PHD3 protein levels were induced by NO under normoxia, particularly at 4 and 6 h for PHD2 and at 4 h for PHD3 (Fig. 1A), respectively. Under hypoxia, NO induced PHD2 and PHD3 at 2, 4, and 6 h, whereas under hypoxia alone induction of PHD2 and PHD3 was observed at 6 and 8 h (Fig. 1B). PHD1 protein levels were unaffected both by NO or hypoxia (Fig. 1, A and B). Thus, the observed decrease in HIF-1α accumulation during the late phase of NO treatment was correlated with an induction of PHD2 and PHD3 levels (Fig. 1, A and B, 4–8 h). The same effects on HIF-1α and PHD2 levels were observed in a neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y (data not shown). In addition, similar effects were obtained with the NO donor spermine-NONOate and DETA-NO (data not shown) but with slightly slower kinetics according to the longer lasting release of NO (46Dehne N. Li T. Petrat F. Rauen U. de Groot H. Biol. Chem. 2004; 385: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). PHD2 and PHD3 are known HIF-1 target genes (16Metzen E. Stiehl D.P. Doege K. Marxsen J.H. Hellwig-Burgel T. Jelkmann W. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 17Pescador N. Cuevas Y. Naranjo S. Alcaide M. Villar D. Landazuri M.O. Del Peso L. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We therefore studied if the NO-dependent induction of HIF-1α in the early phase of NO treatment is reflected by corresponding changes of the PHD2 and -3 mRNA levels using quantitative real time PCR. Transcript levels of both genes were increased after 2 and 4 h of NO treatment under normoxia or in addition to hypoxia (Fig. 2, A–D). After 8 h of NO treatment, however, PHD2 and PHD3 mRNA levels returned to the levels of the normoxic or hypoxic controls. As with PHD1 protein, PHD1 mRNA levels were neither affected by NO nor by hypoxia. NO-induced PHD2 and -3 Expression Is Strictly HIF-1α-dependent—The early increase and late decrease in PHD2 and -3 mRNA levels reflect the time course of the HIF-1α regulation by NO (see Fig. 1). We therefore studied the role of HIF-1α in the induction of PHD2 and -3 under NO treatment by suppression of HIF-1α using siRNA. siRNA directed against HIF-1α completely prevented the induced accumulation of HIF-1α protein by NO or hypoxia (Fig. 3A), whereas both the nontarget control siRNA directed against luciferase and the mock control showed normal induction of HIF-1α. Suppression of HIF-1α by using siRNA abolished the induction of PHD2 and -3 protein by NO, which indicates that NO induced PHD2 and -3 expression, is strictly HIF-1α-dependent in U2OS cells (Fig. 3B). PHD Activity is Transiently Inhibited by NO—NO has been found to inhibit the activity of PHD enzymes in vitro (28Metzen E. Zhou J. Jelkmann W. Fandrey J. Brune B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3470-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Indeed, HIF-1α accumulated within the first 2 h of NO treatment, but this effect disappeared at 4 h under normoxia and hypoxia (Fig. 1, A and B). To prove a transient inhibition of PHD activity by NO, the hydroxylation status of HIF-1α was assessed by Western blot using an antibody against Hyp-564 (42Kageyama Y. Koshiji M. To K.K.W. Tian Y.M. Ratcliffe P.J. Huang L.E. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1028-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For that purpose, proteasomal degradation of hydroxylated HIF-1α was inhibited by MG132. Treatment with dimethyloxalylglycine, a well known inhibitor of PHD activity (4Jaakkola P. Mole D.R. Tian Y.M. Wilson M.I. Gielbert J. Gaskell S.J. Kriegsheim A. Hebestreit H.F. Mukherji M.

Cell. 2001; 107: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar), abolished accumulation of Hyp-564 under normoxia, as expected (Fig. 4A). Likewise, NO decreased Hyp-564 compared with untreated controls under normoxia (Fig. 4B) or inhibited hydroxylation of HIF-1α in addition to hypoxia (Fig. 4C) after 2 h of incubation. In contrast, after 4 h of incubation with NO, Hyp-564 levels were induced under normoxia or at least returned to control levels under hypoxic conditions. Thus, PHD activity had returned after 4 h of NO treatment, indicating that inhibition of PHDs was a transient process. Under normoxia, PHD activity was apparently higher after 4 h of NO treatment, as indicated by increased amounts of Hyp-564. The transient inhibition of PHDs reflects the release kinetics of NO from GSNO as previously reported (24Sandau K.B. Fandrey J. Brune B. Blood. 2001; 97: 1009-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). We assumed that inhibition of PHDs requires the presence of NO and that the return of PHD activity was most likely due to exhausted NO release from GSNO. To test this hypothesis, we preincubated GSNO in complete medium on cells for 2 h and applied this medium to fresh cells for a further 2-h incubation. In comparison with “fresh” GSNO (plus sign in Fig. 5A), preincubated medium (plus sign with asterisk in Fig. 5A) no longer induced HIF-1α, neither under normoxia nor under hypoxia. Likewise, HIF-1α was reinduced during NO treatment for 4 h (Fig. 5B, 4 h), when fresh GSNO was reapplied for the last 2 h (Fig. 5B, 2 + 2), both under normoxia and hypoxia. The by-products of the NO release from GSNO, GSH and GSSG, did not affect accumulation of HIF-1α, and the NO scavenger carboxyl-PTIO prevented the induction of HIF-1α by NO (data not shown). Thus, the NO-dependent inhibition of PHDs was limited to the time when NO was released from the donor. NO-induced PHD Protein Levels Promote HIF-1α Degradation—To address the functional consequences of NO-induced PHD2 and -3 expression on HIF-1α, U2OS cells were pretreated with NO for 6 h. At this time point, direct inhibition of PHD activity by NO has already ceased (see Figs. 4 and 5); thus, effects of increased PHD2 and PHD3 protein levels may be expected. Pretreatment with NO under normoxia increased PHD2 and -3 levels and led to delayed accumulation of HIF-1α during a subsequent 2-h hypoxic incubation (Fig. 6A). This effect of PHD2 and -3 induction can also be seen in Fig. 1B by comparing HIF-1α accumulation with or without NO treatment under hypoxia for 6 h. To analyze the effect of PHD2 and -3 induction on the degr"

The glycoprotein hCG is produced even before implantation by trophoblast in normal pregnancy. In this manuscript, we demonstrate an angiogenic effect of hCG in several in vivo (chick chorioallantoïc membrane, matrigel plug assay, aortic ring assay) and in vitro experimental models. In contrast, human placental lactogen (hPL) did not display angiogenic properties. LH/hCG receptor was detected in endothelial cells by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and by Western blotting. In mice aortic ring assay, angiostimulation by hCG was abrogated by deletion of LH/hCG receptor (LuRKO mice). Use of recombinant hCG and anti-hCG antibody (Ab) further confirmed the specificity of this angiogenic activity. By using dibutyryl cAMP, adenylate cyclase, or protein kinase A inhibitors, we demonstrate that hCG-mediated angiogenesis involves adenylyl-cyclase-protein kinase A activation. Addition of hCG to endometrial epithelial epithelial cells, but not to cultured endothelial cells, stimulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF and hCG also displayed additive activities. Altogether, these data demonstrate that peritrophoblastic angiostimulation may result from a paracrine dialogue between trophoblast, epithelial, and endothelial cells through hCG and VEGF."
https://openalex.org/W2157179314,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB), a selective barrier formed by endothelial cells and dependent on the presence of tight junctions, is compromised during neuroinflammation. A detailed study of tight junction dynamics during transendothelial migration of leukocytes has been lacking. Therefore, we retrovirally expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the N-terminus of the tight junction protein occludin in the rat brain endothelial cell line GP8/3.9. Confocal microscopy analyses revealed that GFP-occludin colocalized with the intracellular tight junction protein, ZO-1, localized at intercellular connections, and was absent at cell borders lacking apposing cells. Using live cell imaging we found that monocytes scroll over the brain endothelial cell surface toward cell-cell contacts, induce gap formation, which is associated with local disappearance of GFP-occludin, and subsequently traverse the endothelium paracellularly. Immunoblot analyses indicated that loss of occludin was due to protein degradation. The broad spectrum matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor BB-3103 significantly inhibited endothelial gap formation, occludin loss, and the ability of monocytes to pass the endothelium. Our results provide a novel insight into the mechanism by which leukocytes traverse the BBB and illustrate that therapeutics aimed at the stabilization of the tight junction may be beneficial to resist a neuroinflammatory attack."
https://openalex.org/W1995315763,"Leukocytes counteract inflammatory pain by releasing opioid peptides, which bind to opioid receptors on peripheral sensory neurons. In the early phase of inflammation, polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) are the major source of opioids. Their recruitment is governed by ligands at the chemokine receptor CXCR2. Here, we examined whether chemokines can also induce opioid peptide secretion from PMN and thus inhibit inflammatory pain. In rats with hindpaw inflammation, intraplantar injection of CXCL2/3, but not of the CXCR4 ligand CXCL12, elicited naloxone-reversible (i.e., opioid receptor mediated) mechanical and thermal analgesia, which was abolished by systemic PMN depletion. Both CXCR1/2- and CXCR4-ligands induced PMN chemotaxis, but only CXCR1/2 ligands triggered opioid release from human and rat PMN in vitro. This release was unaltered by extracellular Ca2+ chelation, was mimicked by thapsigargin and was blocked by inhibitors of the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP3) and by intracellular Ca2+ chelation, indicating that it required Ca2+ from intracellular but not extracellular sources. Furthermore, release was partially reduced by phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors. Adoptive transfer of allogenic PMN into PMN-depleted rats reconstituted CXCL2/3-induced analgesia, which was inhibited by prior ex vivo chelation of intracellular Ca2+. These findings demonstrate that, beyond cell recruitment, CXCR2 ligands induce Ca2+-regulated opioid release from PMN and thereby inhibit inflammatory pain in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2035467136,"Slit is a large secreted protein that provides important guidance cues in the developing nervous system and in other organs. Signaling by Slit requires two receptors, Robo transmembrane proteins and heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans. How HS controls Slit-Robo signaling is unclear.

They have well established and evolutionarily conserved functions as guidance cues in the developing nervous system (1Brose K. Tessier-Lavigne M. Curr. Opin.

The first indication that there might exist a second Slit receptor came from the observation that heparan sulfate (HS) was required for the repellent activity of Slit in vitro (9Hu H. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 695-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and in vivo (10Inatani M. Irie F. Plump A.S. Tessier-Lavigne M. Yamaguchi Y. Science. 2003; 302: 1044-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The identity of this receptor was revealed by recent genetic studies in invertebrates, which showed that Slit signaling requires Robo to be co-expressed on the same cell with the HS proteoglycan syndecan (11Steigemann P. Molitor A. Fellert S. Jackle H. Vorbruggen G. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 225-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Johnson K.G. Ghose A. Epstein E. Lincecum J. O'Connor M.B.

Biol. 2004; 14: 499-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) showed that both Slit and Robo can be co-immunoprecipitated with syndecan, suggesting the presence of a ternary (or higher order) complex at the neuronal cell membrane. However, the composition and functional relevance of this putative ternary complex was not established. Because the Slit distribution was found to be altered in syndecan-deficient embryos, HS may also be required for Slit localization rather than signaling (12Johnson K.G. Ghose A. Epstein E. Lincecum J. O'Connor M.B. Van Vactor D. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 499-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Here we provide direct biochemical and functional evidence for a ternary signaling complex composed of the second LRR domain of Slit, Robo, and heparin/HS. Other Slit domains are dispensable for signaling in an in vitro growth cone collapse assay, but heparin/HS is required absolutely. We conclude that heparin/HS is an integral component of the minimal Slit-Robo signaling complex.

A Robo IG1-5 Fc construct was made by replacing the C-terminal His tag with a human Fc sequence obtained by PCR amplification from the pFUSE-hFc1 vector (InvivoGen). Mutations in human Slit2 (hSlit2) D2 were introduced by strand overlap extension PCR. The insert sequences of all expression vectors were verified by DNA sequencing. The domain boundaries of the Slit LRR domains and the Robo D1-5 construct have been described previously (5Howitt J.A. Clout N.J. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4406-4412Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The new constructs have the following boundaries (sequence numbering includes the signal peptide): Slit EG1-5, NACFE... YPQTS (933-1137); Slit EG6-LG-EG7, QTSPC... TVTAA (1134-1430); Slit CT, QGEGS... TKKCY (1417-1504); Slit EG6-LG-EG7-CT, QTSPC... TKKCY (1134-1504); hSlit2 D2, SVLHC... FADLA (269-505); Robo D1-2, GQYQS... IVQVK (51-254); Robo D3-5, KPYFM... AADPS (254-546). The following vector-derived sequences are additionally present in the mature proteins: APLVHHHHHHALA and APLA, respectively, at the N terminus of all Slit and Robo constructs; AAAHHHHHH at the C terminus of His-tagged Robo constructs; and AAAVECPP... SLSPG at the C terminus of the Robo IG1-5 Fc construct. Protein Production—All proteins were purified from the conditioned medium of episomally transfected 293-EBNA cells as described (5Howitt J.A. Clout N.J. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4406-4412Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), transfected using FuGENE reagent (Roche Applied Science), and selected with 1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). His-tagged proteins were purified from serum-free conditioned medium using TALON affinity beads (BD Biosciences) or 5-ml HisTrap columns (GE Healthcare). The EG6-LG-EG7-CT construct was additionally purified by preparative heparin affinity chromatography. The Robo IG1-5 Fc protein was purified using protein A-Sepharose resin (Sigma). Purified proteins were dialyzed into TBS, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and quantified by measuring their absorption at 280 nm. Oligosaccharide Production—Defined heparin-derived oligosaccharides were prepared as described (15Skidmore M.A. Turnbull J.E. Garg H. Chemistry and Biology of Heparin and Heparan Sulfate. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam2005: 181-203Google Scholar, 16Guimond S.E. Turnbull J.E. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1343-1346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Briefly, bovine lung heparin (Calbiochem) was partially digested using heparinase I (IBEX Technologies, Inc.). Partial digests were fractionated by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 30 preparation grade column (3 × 200 cm) run at 0.5 ml/min in 0.5 m ammonium hydrogen carbonate. Size-defined fractions were further separated by strong anion exchange chromatography using a Propac PA1 column (0.9 × 25 cm; Dionex), eluting with a linear NaCl gradient (0-1 m). Pooled peak fractions were desalted and lyophilized. Purified oligosaccharides were analyzed by PAGE and quantified by weighing or by measuring their absorption at 232 nm. Solid-phase Protein Binding Assay—The solid-phase binding assay was carried out as described (5Howitt J.A. Clout N.J. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4406-4412Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, Slit D1-4 (100 μg/ml) was coated onto 96-well microtiter plates (NUNC Maxisorp). Wells were blocked with TBS/casein/Tween 20 and washed with TBS. Robo IG1-5 Fc protein was added for 1 h. After four washes, bound protein was detected by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-human Fc antibody (Sigma). In some experiments, heparin (Sigma, 10 μg/ml) was added together with Robo IG1-5 Fc. Chromatography—All chromatography experiments were done on an Äkta system (GE Healthcare). A 5-ml heparin HiTrap column equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, was used to determine heparin affinities; bound proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0-2 m for the EG6-LG-EG7-CT construct and 0-1 m for all other constructs). Gel filtration chromatography was carried out using a 24-ml Superdex 75 column run at 0.5 ml/min in 20 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl. Growth Cone Collapse Assay—The retinal growth cone collapse assay was performed as described (8Piper M. Anderson R. Dwivedy A. Weinl C. van Horck F. Leung K.M. Cogill E. Holt C. Neuron. 2006; 49: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Briefly, Xenopus eye primordia were dissected from stage 35/36 embryos and cultured at 20 °C on coverslips coated with 10 μg/ml poly-l-lysine (Sigma) and 10 μg/ml laminin (Sigma) for 24 h. hSlit2 D2 proteins (40 nm), hSlit2 conditioned medium (positive control), or TBS (negative control) were added directly to cultured explants for 10 min. Cultures were then fixed for 1 h in 2% paraformaldehyde + 7.5% sucrose and then mounted. The number of collapsed growth cones was counted in blind conditions. Heparin or HS (Sigma; 100 μg/ml) was added immediately prior to the addition of hSlit2 D2. For cultures treated with heparinase 1 (Sigma; 2.5 units/ml), the enzyme was added 3 h before the addition of hSlit2 D2. Each experiment was conducted independently a minimum of four times. Mapping of Heparin-binding Sites in Slit and Robo—To locate the heparin-binding site(s) within the large Drosophila Slit protein, we used a panel of recombinant proteins spanning the entire molecule. In a previous study we had shown that the LRR region of Slit consists of four distinct domains, D1-4, each comprising an array of LRRs flanked by cysteine-rich caps, and we mapped the Robo-binding site to a highly conserved region on the concave face of Slit D2 (5Howitt J.A. Clout N.J. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4406-4412Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In addition to the LRR domain constructs available from that study, we prepared several new constructs spanning the C-terminal portion of Slit (Fig. 1). The EG1-5 construct contains the five epidermal growth factor-like domains following the LRR region and terminates at a natural proteolytic cleavage site of Slit (1Brose K. Tessier-Lavigne M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The EG6-LG-EG7-CT construct contains the remainder of the Slit C-terminal region; a truncated version of this construct, EG6-LG-EG7, was used to assess the contribution to heparin binding of the C-terminal (CT) cystine knot domain. It was not possible to study heparin binding by the CT domain directly, as the isolated CT domain was not secreted by 293 cells transfected with the relevant expression vector. The recombinant Slit proteins were analyzed by heparin affinity chromatography. Several proteins did not bind to the heparin column; those that did eluted in single sharp peaks, and the NaCl concentration required for elution was taken as a measure of relative heparin affinity. We found that heparinbinding sites are located at either end of the Slit protein, whereas the central portion does not interact with heparin (Fig. 1A). These findings are in agreement with an earlier study on the two natural cleavage products of hSlit2 (17Ronca F. Andersen J.S. Paech V. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29141-29147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The CT domain of Drosophila Slit has the highest apparent affinity for heparin (compare EG6-LG-EG7-CT and EG6-LG-EG7), but the N-terminal LRR domains of Slit, D1 and D2, also bind to heparin, and their combined presence in D1-4 results in a substantial affinity for heparin. We also tested whether the Slit-binding ectodomain of Drosophila Robo displays affinity for heparin. Robo IG1-5 bound quite strongly to the heparin affinity column; further dissection of this region into IG1-2 and IG3-5 showed that the heparin binding activity is fully contained within IG1-2 (Fig. 1A). Formation of a Ternary Slit-Robo-Heparin Complex—The experiments described above demonstrate that both the Robo-binding domain of Slit (D2) (5Howitt J.A. Clout N.J. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4406-4412Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and the Slit-binding region of Robo (IG1-2) (6Liu Z. Patel K. Schmidt H. Andrews W. Pini A. Sundaresan V. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2004; 26: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) bind heparin, raising the intriguing possibility of a ternary Slit-Robo-heparin complex. To see whether heparin had an effect on the Slit-Robo interaction, we first carried out a solid-phase binding experiment (Fig. 2) in the absence and presence of soluble heparin. Addition of 10 μg/ml heparin resulted in a marked (greater than 10-fold) increase of the apparent affinity of Robo D1-5 Fc for Slit D1-4. Thus, heparin enhances the Slit-Robo interaction, most likely via the formation of a ternary Slit-Robo-heparin complex. To obtain direct evidence for ternary complex formation, we used analytical gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 3A). Drosophila Slit D2 (27.4 kDa + two N-linked glycans) behaved as a monomer, as reported previously (5Howitt J.A. Clout N.J. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4406-4412Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The elution volume of Drosophila Robo IG1-2 (24.1 kDa) is also most compatible with a monomer, considering that this construct is likely to adopt an extended conformation and will therefore elute earlier than a globular protein of the same mass. When Slit D2 and Robo IG1-2 were mixed in a 1:1 ratio, a single peak was observed that eluted ahead of the individual proteins, demonstrating formation of a binary complex. SDS-PAGE showed that the peak fractions contained Slit D2 and Robo IG1-2 in comparable amounts (Fig. 3B). The Slit D2-Robo IG1-2 complex must have 1:1 stoichiometry, given that its elution volume of 10.9 ml corresponds to an ∼55-kDa globular protein. The close correspondence to the calculated mass (51.5 kDa + two N-linked glycans) indicates a compact shape of the complex. The shoulder at a higher elution volume may result from partial dissociation of the complex on the column. We next tested whether addition of heparin to the minimal Slit-Robo complex results in the formation of a ternary complex. Because native heparin is too large and polydisperse to be used in these experiments, we used a purified heparin-derived decasaccharide composed of repeating trisulfated disaccharide units, which was expected to be long enough to span the minimal Slit-Robo complex. When Slit D2, Robo IG1-2, and the heparin decasaccharide were mixed in a 1:1:1 ratio, the resulting complex eluted even earlier than the binary Slit-Robo complex, indicating formation of a ternary Slit-Robo-heparin complex (Fig. 3A). SDS-PAGE of the peak fractions again demonstrated the presence of Slit and Robo in comparable amounts (Fig. 3B). Given that a heparin decasaccharide has a similar hydrodynamic radius as an ∼20-kDa globular protein (18Robinson C.J. Harmer N.J. Goodger S.J. Blundell T.L. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42274-42282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and that the elution volume of the ternary complex corresponds to an ∼70-kDa globular entity, the most likely stoichiometry of the ternary Slit-Robo-heparin complex is 1:1:1. Interestingly, when the heparin decasaccharide was added to the individual Slit D2 and Robo IG1-2 proteins, no interaction was detected by gel filtration chromatography (data not shown), suggesting that a high affinity binding site is only formed in the Slit-Robo complex. Heparin-dependent Biological Activity of Slit D2—Our biochemical observation of a minimal Slit-Robo-heparin complex suggests that an important function of heparin/HS in Slit-Robo signaling may be to strengthen the association of Slit domain D2 with Robo receptors. If this is indeed the case, one would expect Slit D2 to display a similar heparin/HS-dependent activity as full-length Slit, even though it is lacking the C-terminal high affinity heparin-binding site of the full-length molecule. In a previous study, we used an endothelial cell migration assay to demonstrate biological activity of Slit D2 (5Howitt J.A. Clout N.J. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4406-4412Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A drawback of this assay is that endothelial cells express a divergent member of the Robo family, Robo4, whose role as a Slit receptor is controversial (19Park K.W. Morrison C.M. Sorensen L.K. Jones C.A. Rao Y. Chien C.B. Wu J.Y. Urness L.D. Li D.Y. Dev. Biol. 2003; 261: 251-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 20Suchting S. Heal P. Tahtis K. Stewart L.M. Bicknell R.

Chem. 2006; 281: 11347-11356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In the absence of further studies, it is therefore difficult to attribute the effect of Slit on endothelial cells to a specific Robo receptor. Moreover, all studies into the HS requirement of Slit-Robo signaling so far have focused on (cells of) the nervous system (9Hu H. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 695-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 10Inatani M. Irie F. Plump A.S. Tessier-Lavigne M. Yamaguchi Y.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 6911-6923Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To facilitate comparison with these studies, we therefore decided to use a chemotropic collapse assay on cultured Xenopus retinal growth cones. In this assay, conditioned medium of cells expressing hSlit2 induces growth cone collapse in a Robo- and heparin/HS-dependent manner (8Piper M. Anderson R. Dwivedy A. Weinl C. van Horck F. Leung K.M. Cogill E. Holt C. Neuron. 2006; 49: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). We found that recombinant hSlit2 D2 protein (61.5 and 96.6% sequence identity to Drosophila and Xenopus Slit D2, respectively) applied at 40 nm (the optimal concentration determined in a dose-response experiment; data not shown) elicited a robust collapse response, comparable with that obtained with hSlit2 conditioned medium (Fig. 4, A-C and H). As expected from our previous analysis (5Howitt J.A. Clout N.J. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4406-4412Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), other Slit domains were inactive (data not shown). Addition of heparin or HS had no effect on the collapse-inducing activity of hSlit2 D2 (Fig. 4, D, E, and H). In sharp contrast, enzymatic removal of HS from the neurites by heparinase treatment abolished the response to hSlit2 D2, demonstrating that Slit-Robo signaling does not occur in the absence of HS chains at the cell surface. Remarkably, addition of heparin to heparinase-digested growth cones fully restored their sensitivity to hSlit2 D2 (Fig. 4, G and H), indicating that, in this assay format, exogenous soluble heparin/HS can substitute for endogenous HS proteoglycans to support productive signaling. Taken together, the results demonstrate that the D2 domain of Slit contains not only the unique Robo-binding site but also a functionally important heparin/HS-binding site. Location of the Heparin/HS-binding Site in Slit D2—We next wanted to determine which residues in Slit D2 contribute to heparin/HS binding. Because the role of HS in Slit-Robo signaling appears to be conserved between invertebrates and vertebrates (9Hu H. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 695-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 10Inatani M. Irie F. Plump A.S. Tessier-Lavigne M. Yamaguchi Y.

Neuron. 2004; 41: 723-736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), we looked for conserved basic residues that might be involved in HS binding. Because we wanted to test the mutants in the growth cone collapse assay, we chose hSlit2 D2 for mutagenesis. Using an alignment of invertebrate and vertebrate Slit sequences (Fig. 5A) and a molecular model of hSlit2 D2 (Fig. 5B), we selected a total of 12 basic residues for mutagenesis (Table 1). Mutants 1-4 target a basic patch in the N-terminal region of hSlit2 D2, and mutants 5-7 target a large concentration of basic charges in the C-terminal cap of the D2 domain (Fig. 5B). Both of these basic patches are adjacent to the Robo-binding site defined in our previous study (5Howitt J.A. Clout N.J. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4406-4412Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Heparin binding and growth cone collapse activity of hSlit2 D2 mutantsMutationsHeparin bindingPercent growth cone collapse ± S.E.TBS26.7 ± 1.5Wild type0.8560.2 ± 3.1Mutant 1R287A0.84NDMutant 2R306A0.86NDMutant 3K324A/K325A0.83NDMutant 4R327A/R328A0.85NDMutant 5R461A/R462A0.64NDMutant 6K466A/R467A0.69NDMutant 7K472A/K475A0.5826.8 ± 5.4Mutant 5 + 6R461A/R462A/K466A/R467A0.4835.0 ± 3.5 Open table in a new tab All hSlit2 D2 mutants were purified to homogeneity from the conditioned medium of episomally transfected 293 cells (data not shown). Heparin affinity chromatography unexpectedly revealed that hSlit2 D2 has considerably higher affinity for heparin than its Drosophila orthologue (0.85 m NaCl required for elution, compared with 0.28 m for Drosophila Slit D2); the biological relevance of this difference (if any) remains to be established. Mutation of basic residues in the N-terminal half of hSlit2 D2 (mutants 1-4) had no effect on heparin binding, whereas mutation of basic residues in the C-terminal region (mutants 5-7 and the quadruple mutant 5 + 6) resulted in a substantial decrease of heparin affinity (Table 1). Crucially, when we examined the biological activity of two mutants that showed the most reduced heparin binding (mutants 7 and 5 + 6), we found that both mutants had lost the ability to trigger growth cone collapse (Table 1). These results demonstrate that the C-terminal cap region of Slit D2 harbors a functionally critical binding site for heparin/HS. Several growth factors and cytokines require heparin/HS for productive signaling. The classic example is fibroblast growth factor (FGF), which requires HS as an obligatory co-receptor for signaling (25Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar, 26Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). HS also binds to the FGF receptor (FGFR) (27Kan M. Wang F. Xu J. Crabb J.W. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. Science. 1993; 259: 1918-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), and specific HS sequences support signaling (16Guimond S.E. Turnbull J.E. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1343-1346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Recent crystallographic studies have confirmed that a ternary complex is formed by these partners (28Pellegrini L. Burke D.F. von Delft F. Mulloy B. Blundell T.L. Nature. 2000; 407: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 29Schlessinger J. Plotnikov A.N. Ibrahimi O.A. Eliseenkova A.V. Yeh B.K. Yayon A. Linhardt R.J. Mohammadi M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 743-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). Although the structural details of the ternary signaling complex are still a matter of dispute, it is clear that an important role of heparin/HS is to stabilize the relatively weak binary interaction between FGF and FGFR. In previous studies, HS was shown to be required for Slit-Robo signaling in vitro (9Hu H. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 695-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and in vivo (10Inatani M. Irie F.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 6911-6923Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), but the molecular mechanism(s) involved remained unclear. Our previous results have shown that Robo binds to a highly conserved site on the concave face of Slit D2 (5Howitt J.A. Clout N.J. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4406-4412Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that heparin/HS binding to a conserved basic patch adjacent to the Robo-binding site is critical for the biological activity of Slit D2. Furthermore, we provide direct biochemical evidence for a ternary complex consisting of Slit D2, Robo, and heparin. We conclude that heparin/HS is an integral and essential component of the Slit-Robo signaling complex. Slit concentrations in vivo are likely to be much lower than the Slit D2 concentration required for growth cone collapse in vitro, and one function of the high affinity heparin-binding site in the C-terminal region of Slit may be to concentrate the Slit protein at the target cell surface or modulate its diffusion through extracellular matrix (12Johnson K.G. Ghose A. Epstein E. Lincecum J. O'Connor M.B. Van Vactor D. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 499-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). This interpretation could explain why excess heparin/HS abolishes growth cone collapse triggered by full-length Slit (8Piper M. Anderson R. Dwivedy A. Weinl C. van Horck F. Leung K.M. Cogill E. Holt C. Neuron. 2006; 49: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 9Hu H. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 695-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) but not by the isolated D2 domain (Fig. 4). We think that exogenous heparin/HS competes with cell surface HS for binding to the CT domain of the full-length protein, thereby preventing Slit recruitment to the growth cone surface. The D2 domain, in contrast, is present at 40 nm in our assay, and HS is no longer required for cell surface localization. Thus, we speculate that HS may play a dual role in Slit-Robo signaling, by acting both as a modulator of Slit distribution (12Johnson K.G. Ghose A. Epstein E. Lincecum J. O'Connor M.B. Van Vactor D. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 499-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and as an essential component of the signaling complex (this study). Slits are naturally processed by proteolytic cleavage within the EG5-EG6 linker (1Brose K. Tessier-Lavigne M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The functional relevance of Slit processing is currently not understood, but it is intriguing that cleavage results in the separation of the two heparin/HS-binding regions of Slit. A number of previous studies in vivo have provided evidence to suggest that specific HS structures are involved in retinal axon guidance and Slit-Robo signaling (22Lee J.S. von der Hardt S.

Because Slit contains multiple heparin/HS-binding sites (Fig. 1), it is difficult to assess whether the observed effects are due to an effect on Slit distribution (HS binding to the CT domain) or signaling (HS binding to the D2 domain), or both. By applying recombinant D2 domain (mutants) and exogenous heparin derivatives to growth cones lacking cell surface HS, we should be able to define precisely the HS sequence(s) required for Robo activation. In this regard, it is interesting to compare the impact of Slit D2 mutations on heparin binding and biological activity. Even though we failed to disrupt heparin binding completely, we were able to abrogate all activity in the growth cone collapse assay. Evidently, the requirements for Slit D2 binding to cell surface HS are more stringent than for binding to heparin-Sepharose. In conclusion, our results have revealed a specific role for heparin/HS in forming a ternary signaling complex with Slit D2 and Robo. At first glance, the parallels to the FGF-FGFR system are striking, but there are important differences that make it unlikely that the analogy extends to the mechanism of transmembrane signaling. First, Slits are large extracellular matrix proteins, whereas FGFs are small single-domain proteins. Second, Robos are cell adhesion molecules with no recognized catalytic activity in their cytosolic domains (7Guan K.L. Rao Y. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 941-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 31Hivert B. Liu Z. Chuang C.Y. Doherty P. Sundaresan V. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 21: 534-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), whereas FGFRs contain cytosolic tyrosine kinase domains. In the FGF-FGFR system, heparin/HS collaborates with FGF to promote receptor dimerization, which is required for FGFR autophosphorylation and downstream signaling (28Pellegrini L. Burke D.F. von Delft F. Mulloy B. Blundell T.L. Nature. 2000; 407: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 29Schlessinger J. Plotnikov A.N. Ibrahimi O.A. Eliseenkova A.V. Yeh B.K.

In the Slit-Robo system, the oligomerization state of Robo and the mechanism of transmembrane signaling remain to be established. Conceivably, multiple Slit-Robo signaling complexes could be assembled upon a single HS chain, but Slit and HS could also disrupt an inactive Robo oligomer to initiate signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1997484584,"Secreted lysosomal cysteine proteases (cathepsins) are involved in degradation and remodeling of the extracellular matrix, thus contributing to cell adhesion and migration. Among the eleven human lysosomal cysteine proteases, only procathepsin X contains an RGD motif located in a highly exposed region of the propeptide, which may allow binding of the proenzyme to RGD-recognizing integrins. Here, we have tested procathepsin X for cell-adhesive properties and found that it supports integrin αvβ3-dependent attachment and spreading of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Using site-directed mutants of procathepsin X, we proved that this effect is mediated by the RGD sequence within the proregion of the protease. Endogenous procathepsin X is transported to the plasma membrane, accumulates in vesicles at lamellipodia of the human umbilical vein endothelial cell, and is partly associated with the cell surface, as shown by immunofluorescence. In addition, procathepsin X is partly co-localized with integrin β3, as detected by immunogold electron microscopy. A direct interaction between endogenous procathepsin X and αvβ3 was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. Moreover, surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed significant and RGD-dependent binding of procathepsin X to integrin αvβ3. Our results provide for the first time evidence that the extracellular function of cathepsin X may include binding to integrins thereby modulating the attachment of migrating cells to ECM components.

Cellular migration through extracellular matrix (ECM) 2The abbreviations and trivial names used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; BSA, bovine serum albumin; cyclic RGD peptide, cyclo(-Arg-Gly-Asp-d-Phe-Val); cyclic RAD peptide, cyclo(-Arg-Gly-Ala-d-Phe-Val); DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 2The abbreviations and trivial names used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; BSA, bovine serum albumin; cyclic RGD peptide, cyclo(-Arg-Gly-Asp-d-Phe-Val); cyclic RAD peptide, cyclo(-Arg-Gly-Ala-d-Phe-Val); DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. requires both cell adhesion to and proteolysis of ECM components. A large number of proteases, including matrix metalloproteases, serine proteases, but also lysosomal cysteine proteases are known to be responsible for ECM breakdown, particularly during tumor invasion (1Buck M.R. Karustis D.G. Day N.A. Honn K.V. Sloane B.F. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 2Koblinski J.E. Ahram M. Sloane B.F. Clin. Chim.

Cell adhesion to ECM on the other hand is largely mediated by heterodimeric cell surface receptors of the integrin family. Integrins are composed of noncovalently associated α and β chains that form various heterodimers with distinct adhesive specificities (4Arnaout M.A. Goodman S.L. Xiong J.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 641-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 5Miranti C.K. Brugge J.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Several proteases have been shown to mediate adhesion and migration of cells through interaction with integrins. Thus, prothrombin, the zymogen of a multifunctional serine protease of the blood coagulation system, interacts directly with integrins via its RGD sequence, a motif involved in integrin binding (6Byzova T.V. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27183-27188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 7Byzova T.V. Plow E.F. J.

Although the RGD sequence is partly buried in the native conformation (9Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar), prothrombin can bind in an RGD-dependent fashion to integrins αIIbβ3 of platelets and αvβ3 of cultured human endothelial cells (10Bar-Shavit R.

Physiol. 2003; 285: C1330-C1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence that interactions between prothrombin and β3 integrins play important roles in the regulation of hemostatic and vascular functions. Furthermore, the urokinase-type plasminogen activator/urokinase receptor (uPA/uPAR) system not only plays a key role in fibrinolysis but also regulates cell adhesion, cell migration, and cell proliferation through interaction with integrins (for review, see Refs. 13Mondino A. Blasi F. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 450-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar and 14Chapman H.A. Wei Y. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In this case, it is not the protease but its receptor uPAR that binds to β1 integrins and localizes urokinase to sites of cell attachment to ECM. Besides serine proteases, lysosomal cysteine proteases are also secreted from cells, particularly during tumor invasion and are known to degrade ECM (for review, see Ref. 15Jedeszko C. Sloane B.F. Biol. Chem. 2004; 385: 1017-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). An essential requirement for efficient degradation of ECM is the endoproteolytic activity displayed by most of the lysosomal cathepsins. Cathepsin X, however, a cysteine protease highly expressed in prostate cancer and gastric cancer (intestinal type) is a strict carboxypeptidase and therefore unlikely to participate in ECM degradation to a significant extent (16Nägler D.K. Zhang R. Tam W. Sulea T. Purisima E.O. Ménard R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12648-12654Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 17Nägler D.K. Krüger S. Kellner A. Ziomek E. Ménard R. Buhtz P.

Kellner U. Malfertheiner P. Naumann M. Rocken C. Roessner A. J. Pathol. 2005; 207: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Indeed, the inhibition of cathepsin X activity with anti-catalytic antibodies did not result in impaired migration of breast cancer cells (19Kos J. Sekirnik A. Premzl A. Zavasnik Bergant V. Langerholc T. Turk B. Werle B. Golouh R. Repnik U. Jeras M. Turk V. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 306: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Yet, as we have recently shown, inhibition of cathepsin X at the mRNA level leads to decreased migration of gastric epithelial cancer cells (18Krueger S. Kalinski T. Hundertmark T. Wex T. Kuster D. Peitz U. Ebert M. Nägler D.K. Kellner U. Malfertheiner P. Naumann M. Rocken C. Roessner A. J. Pathol. 2005; 207: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This apparent contradiction led us to speculate that the enzyme may be involved in mechanisms of adhesion, migration, or invasion, which are not related to proteolysis. Interestingly, the crystal structure of procathepsin X reveals that the prosegment and its mode of inactivation of the protease are strikingly different when compared with the proforms of other cathepsins (20Sivaraman J. Nägler D.K. Zhang R. Ménard R. Cygler M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 939-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 21Groves M.R. Coulombe R. Jenkins J. Cygler M. Proteins. 1998; 32: 504-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The inhibition of the proteolytic activity of the enzyme by the proregion is achieved through a disulfide bond between the cysteine residue in the proregion and the active site cysteine residue. The RGD sequence in the proregion is unique among lysosomal cysteine proteases and forms a surface bulge with no contacts to the enzyme. Therefore, we hypothesized that this solvent-exposed motif may be important for the interaction of procathepsin X with cell-adhesion integrins. With respect to cathepsin X orthologs, the RGD motif is conserved in murine procathepsin X but not in the enzyme from lower animals such as nematodes. Because procathepsin X is released in large amounts into the circulation (22Nägler D.K. Lechner A.M. Oettl A. Kozaczynska K. Scheuber H.P. Gippner-Steppert C. Bogner V. Biberthaler P. Jochum M. J. Immunol. Methods. 2006; 308: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), it was tempting to speculate that procathepsin X can serve as an extracellular ligand for integrins. In the present study, we have demonstrated the ability of procathepsin X to interact with integrin αvβ3 through its RGD motif. To examine whether procathepsin X could modulate cell-adhesive properties, attachment assays were performed with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). These cells were chosen because they express a wide range of extracellular matrix receptors including integrin αvβ3. Our data show that specific binding to integrin αvβ3 via the RGD-containing propeptide of cathepsin X can indeed modulate adhesive properties of HUVECs. Moreover, procathepsin X accumulates at lamellipodia of endothelial cells and is partly co-localized with αvβ3. We also demonstrate a direct interaction between procathepsin X and integrin αvβ3 by co-immunoprecipitation of the endogenous proteins from HUVECs and by surface plasmon resonance. Thus, we provide first evidence that the extracellular function of cathepsin X may include modulation of cell attachment to ECM components through binding to integrins. Materials—Integrins αvβ3, α5β1, and monoclonal antibodies anti-αvβ3 (clone LM 609) and anti-α5β1 (clone JBS 5) were purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Integrin αIIbβ3 was obtained from Haemochrom Diagnostica (Essen, Germany). Human vitronectin was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI) and BSA from Sigma-Aldrich. The antibody against β3 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The two cyclic peptides Cyclo(-Arg-Gly-Asp-d-Phe-Val) (RGD peptide) and Cyclo(-Arg-Ala-Asp-d-Phe-Val) (RAD peptide) were from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland). The antibody against procathepsin X was produced as described previously (17Nägler D.K. Krüger S. Kellner A. Ziomek E. Ménard R. Buhtz P. Krams M. Roessner A. Kellner U. Prostate. 2004; 60: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Accutase was obtained from PAA Laboratories (Pasching, Austria). Further materials are mentioned in the following sections. Mutagenesis and Expression/Purification—Human procathepsin X was expressed and purified as described previously (20Sivaraman J. Nägler D.K. Zhang R. Ménard R. Cygler M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 939-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was carried out on the plasmid harboring the procathepsin X sequence. The primers for the RAD mutant and the AAA mutant of procathepsin X were 5′-CTA CCG GCC TCT GCG GGC AGA CGG GCT AGC TCC GCT GG-3′ and 5′-CTA CCG GCC TCT GGC TGC AGC CGG GCT AGC TCC GCT GG-3′, respectively. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing, and the mutants were expressed and purified as described for the wild type (20Sivaraman J. Nägler D.K. Zhang R. Ménard R. Cygler M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 939-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—HUVECs were purchased from Cambrex (East Rutherford, NJ). The cells were cultivated according to the supplier's recommendations in endothelial growth medium 2 (Cambrex) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Experiments were performed with cells in passage 3-7. All plastic flasks and well plates were from Nalge Nunc (Rochester, NY). Viable cells (as determined by trypan blue exclusion) were counted in a hemocytometer (Neubauer chamber). Attachment Assay—Attachment of HUVECs was assayed in flat-bottomed 96-well plates (MaxiSorp, Nalge Nunc, Rochester, NY) coated overnight at 4 °C with 50 μl/well of different proteins in PBS. These proteins were vitronectin (1 μg/ml), procathepsin X (wild type, RGD mutant, RAD mutant, 5 μg/ml) or BSA (5 μg/ml) as a control. The wells were blocked with 7.5% BSA for 4 h at 4 °C. Subconfluent HUVECs were detached from the culture flask with accutase, resuspended at 4 × 105 cells/ml in DMEM containing 1% BSA and 0.5 mm MnCl2, and 100 μl of cells were added to each well. Inhibition studies were performed by pre-incubating cells with various concentrations of cyclic RGD and RAD peptides (0.5, 1 and 10 μm) or 5-10 μg/ml of function-blocking antibodies against αvβ3 or α5β1 for 15 min at 25 °C before addition to the wells. The plates were incubated for 90 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After washing with DMEM containing 0.2 mm MnCl2 to remove the unattached cells, the attached cells were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 20 min, and washed with water. The cells were lysed with 0.5% Triton X-100 and the absorbance (595 nm) was measured in a multiwell plate reader (Tecan Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA). Furthermore, adherent cells were routinely examined microscopically to assess the extent of cell attachment and spreading. Mean and standard deviations of all cell-based experiments were determined. Each point represents the average of triplicate samples, and each experiment was performed at least three times yielding comparable results. Binding of Procathepsin X to the Surface of Endothelial Cells and Detection of Remaining Fraction by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Subconfluent HUVECs were starved in serum-free medium (DMEM) for 3 h at 37°C. After detachment with accutase, 1.5 × 105 cells in suspension were incubated in 125 μl of DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum and procathepsin X (450 ng/ml) at 25 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was removed and the concentration of unbound procathepsin X was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously (22Nägler D.K. Lechner A.M. Oettl A. Kozaczynska K. Scheuber H.P. Gippner-Steppert C. Bogner V. Biberthaler P. Jochum M. J. Immunol. Methods. 2006; 308: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The incubation of the procathepsin X-containing medium was performed in the presence or absence of cells as well as in the presence or absence of the function-blocking antibody against integrin αvβ3 (LM 609, 10 μg/ml). Immunofluorescence—HUVECs were isolated and cultivated as described previously (23Gonscherowski V. Becker B.F. Moroder L. Motrescu E. Gil-Parrado S. Gloe T. Keller M. Zahler S. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: H2035-H2042Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cultured on 8-chamber μ-slides (Ibidi, Munich, Germany). The freshly adherent cells were incubated for 1 h at 37°C (5% CO2) with primary antibodies against human procathepsin X (1:100, (17Nägler D.K. Krüger S. Kellner A. Ziomek E. Ménard R. Buhtz P. Krams M. Roessner A. Kellner U. Prostate. 2004; 60: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar)) and/or against integrin αvβ3 (1:100, monoclonal, Chemicon, clone LM 609). After washing with PBS (three times), cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde (3.7%), washed again with PBS, and incubated with secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit labeled with Alexa 488, or goat anti-mouse with Alexa 633, respectively, both from Invitrogen. This procedure was used to detect exclusively extracellular proteins. Alternatively, cells were fixed for 15 min with 3.7% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized for 2 min with 0.2% Triton X-100 followed by washing with PBS, incubation with primary antibodies, and subsequently with secondary antibodies. After the final washing, cells were covered with Permafluor mounting medium (Thermo Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA). Immunostained cells were viewed in a confocal microscope (LSM 510 invert, Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Immunoelectron Microscopy—Subconfluent HUVECs were detached from the culture flask with accutase (PAA Laboratories), resuspended at 4 × 105 cells/ml in endothelial growth medium 2 containing 0.5 mm MnCl2. The cell suspension was applied to polyvinyl formal carbon-coated nickel grids and allowed to adhere for 2 h. Immunogold labeling was performed essentially as described previously (24Stoeckelhuber M. Stumpf P. Hoefter E.A. Welsch U. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 118: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, the grids were passed over successive drops of the following solutions (50 μl for every incubation step). After washing with PBS (containing 0.5 mm MnCl2), the attached cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% glutaraldehyde in Soerensen buffer (0.1 m phosphate, pH 7.4) for 20 min and then washed again with PBS. After treatment with 50 mm glycine for 15 min and washing with PBS, the cells were blocked with PBS containing 2.5% BSA and 2.5% goat serum for 30 min. Double immunolabeling was carried out by incubating the cells simultaneously with antibodies against procathepsin X (1:10) and integrin β3 (1:5) for 1 h at room temperature, overnight at 4 °C, and again for 1 h at room temperature. It should be noted that the monoclonal antibody against αvβ3 (clone LM 609) was less suitable for electron microscopy and was therefore replaced by an antibody directed against the integrin β3 subunit. Grids were washed with PBS and incubated with the secondary gold-conjugated antibody (1:100, Aurion, Wageningen, The Netherlands) for 2 h at room temperature. Control samples were treated with PBS instead of primary antibodies. The gold particle size was 10 nm for detection of procathepsin X IgG and 6 nm for detection of integrin subunit β3 IgG. After washing with PBS for 4 × 5 min, cells were incubated in 2% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 5 min and washed again 5 × 1 min with distilled water. Cells were contrasted with uranyl acetate for 15 min and then examined in a transmission electron microscope (CM 10; Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting/Immunoprinting—To verify that endothelial procathepsin X exists as a complex with αvβ3, protein G microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) were used for co-immunoprecipitation of both proteins from HUVECs. Therefore, 1.6 × 107 cells were incubated in endothelial growth medium 2 (Cambrex) containing 0.5 mm MnCl2 for 30 min, washed with DMEM containing 0.2 mm MnCl2, detached with accutase (PAA Laboratories, Pasching, Austria), and resuspended at 8 × 106 cells/ml in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, 170 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.5 mm MnCl2, pH 7.4). The lysis buffer was supplemented with inhibitor mixture III (Merck Biosciences, Darmstadt, Germany). After 1 h at 4 °C with gentle shaking, the lysate was sonified (10 × 5s) and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 16000 × g. αvβ3-specific antibody LM 609 (1.5 μl) was added to the supernatant and the mixture incubated for 90 min at 4 °C. The addition of protein G microbeads (50 μl) was followed by incubation at 4 °C for 30 min. Washing steps and elution were performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer. In vitro binding of αvβ3 to wild-type procathepsin X and mutants lacking the RGD motif was also assessed by co-immunoprecipitation. Briefly, αvβ3 (10 nm) was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with procathepsin X (1 μm) in 50 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, 1 mm MnCl2, pH 7.4. The addition of αvβ3-specific antibody LM 609 (1 μg) and protein G microbeads (50 μl) were followed by incubation at 4 °C for 30 min, and the following steps were performed as described above. Western blotting and immunoprinting were carried out as described previously (17Nägler D.K. Krüger S. Kellner A. Ziomek E. Ménard R. Buhtz P. Krams M. Roessner A. Kellner U. Prostate. 2004; 60: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were used at dilutions of 1:3000 (anti-procathepsin X) and 1:100 (anti-β3). Peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies used for detection were anti-rabbit IgG (1:20000, New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) for procathepsin X and anti-goat IgG (1:20000, Sigma-Aldrich) for integrin β3. It should be noted that attempts to use plasma membrane preparations instead of total cell lysates for co-immunoprecipitation were not successful, presumably due to the instability of the integrin heterodimer and/or its complex with procathepsin X during the purification procedure. Surface Plasmon Resonance—A BIACORE 2000 surface plasmon resonance-based biosensor (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) was used to measure binding and kinetic parameters for the interaction between different integrins (analytes) and immobilized vitronectin, procathepsin X, or a mutant of procathepsin X with its RGD sequence exchanged to AAA (ligands). Each ligand was immobilized to the sensor chip (CM5) surface by the amine coupling method according to the manufacturer's suggestion. It should be noted that initial experiments with immobilized integrins coupled to the CM5 chip failed, most likely due to a strained (inactive) conformation of the integrin heterodimers on the chip surface. Integrin solutions were injected into the flow cells using the KINJECT command specifying a 40-μl analyte volume and a 600-s dissociation time. Each assay cycle was performed with a constant flow of 8 μl/min. All experiments were carried out in 25 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 0.5 mm MnCl2 at 25 °C. Analyte solutions were dialyzed against running buffer prior to injection. Between cycles, the immobilized ligands were regenerated by injecting 5 μl of 4 m guanidine hydrochloride. For each immobilized protein, a complete set of sensorgrams was recorded at five different analyte concentrations in the range between 50 and 500 nm. This set of sensorgrams was analyzed using the BIAevaluation version 4.1 software. For data analysis, a control sensorgram with BSA was subtracted from the experimental sensorgrams to eliminate nonspecific binding and refractive index changes due to buffers. Both an association rate constant ka (m-1 s-1) and a dissociation rate constant kd (s-1) were obtained from the entire data set (global fit). The overall affinity constant Kd was derived from kd/ka. All kinetic data were fit most adequately by assuming a bimolecular model for interaction between soluble analyte and immobilized ligand, equivalent to the Langmuir isotherm for adsorption to a surface. Structural Models—Coordinates obtained from the Protein Data Bank (1DEU and 1L5G) were overlaid and visualized using the free programs Deep View (25Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9561) Google Scholar) and ViewerLite (Accelrys). Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was assessed by comparing the mean values (±S.D.) using Student's t test for independent groups. Differences were scored as statistically significant for p < 0.05. All statistical analyses were carried out using the GraphPad Prism software. Adhesive Properties of Endothelial Cells Mediated by Integrin αvβ3 Interaction with Procathepsin X—To support our assumption that procathepsin X released into the circulation may serve as an extracellular ligand for integrins and to examine its adhesive properties, we performed attachment assays with HUVECs. Plates were coated overnight with procathepsin X, and cells were added to each well for 90 min. As shown in Fig. 1A, the cells readily attached to procathepsin X (control). This attachment could be blocked with a cyclic RGD peptide (commonly used as an antagonist), whereas the control cyclic RAD peptide had no effect at the same concentration (0.5 μm). Similar results were obtained with a monoclonal antibody against αvβ3 (clone LM 609), which selectively blocked binding to procathepsin X. Moreover, a function-blocking antibody against integrin α5β1 (clone JBS 5) did not inhibit the adhesive interaction, indicating that procathepsin X does not bind to integrin α5β1. This antibody, however, was able to prevent binding of HUVECs to fibronectin, a matrix protein commonly recognized by α5β1 (data not shown). To further exclude unspecific binding, plates were coated with procathepsin X mutants with the RGD motif mutated to RAD or AAA, processed cathepsin X (mature enzyme lacking the RGD containing propeptide), or BSA. None of these proteins mediated attachment of HUVECs (Fig. 1B). After removal of nonadherent cells, all plates were routinely observed microscopically to assess the extent of cell attachment and spreading. Following a 90-min incubation of HUVECs in plates coated with procathepsin X, most cells attached and started to spread (Fig. 1C), whereas only a few round cells were occasionally seen on plates coated with mutant procathepsin X lacking the RGD sequence (Fig. 1D). αvβ3-Dependent Binding of Procathepsin X to the Surface of Endothelial Cells—αvβ3-Dependent binding of procathepsin X to the surface of HUVECs was also shown with cells in suspension. Cells were incubated for 30 min in medium containing procathepsin X (450 ng/ml). The concentration of added procathepsin X was chosen to reflect pathophysiological concentrations. We have previously determined procathepsin X concentrations in plasma of healthy volunteers to be in the range of 31-165 ng/ml. During severe inflammation, however, the procathepsin X levels are significantly higher (increased up to 8-fold of normal, (22Nägler D.K. Lechner A.M. Oettl A. Kozaczynska K. Scheuber H.P. Gippner-Steppert C. Bogner V. Biberthaler P. Jochum M. J. Immunol. Methods. 2006; 308: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar)). After removal of cells by centrifugation, the unbound fraction of procathepsin X was assayed in the medium by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Fig. 2). In the presence of the function-blocking antibody against integrin αvβ3 (LM 609), the concentration of procathepsin X in the medium remained unchanged, whereas in the absence of the antibody, the concentration of procathepsin X was significantly reduced (p < 0.05). Subcellular Localization of procathepsin X and Integrin αvβ3—We also examined whether HUVECs themselves could be a source of procathepsin X, as we have previously detected the enzyme in adult vascular endothelial cells of different tissue samples. 3A. M. Lechner, I. Assfalg-Machleidt, S. Zahler, M. Stoeckelhuber, W. Machleidt, M. Jochum, and D. K. Nägler, unpublished observation. To determine the subcellular distribution of procathepsin X and a possible co-localization with integrin αvβ3, subconfluent HUVECs were stained for both procathepsin X and αvβ3 and examined by immunofluorescence. Membrane association of procathepsin X was clearly observed regardless of the labeling procedure. To detect exclusively extracellular proteins, cells were incubated with primary antibodies prior to fixation (Fig. 3A). Immunofluorescence was not detected on the abluminal side of nonpermeabilized cells, most likely because of inaccessibility for antibodies. Permeabilization of the cells with Triton X-100 again revealed membrane association of procathepsin X and partial co-localization with αvβ3, particularly at lamellipodia (Fig. 3, B and C). It should be noted that co-localization of procathepsin X and αvβ3 is restricted to vesicles associated with the plasma membrane, indicating that the intracellular transport does not occur within the same vesicles (Fig. 3C) (vesicles stained green do not co-localize with vesicles stained red, except for those associated with the plasma membrane). The nuclear staining observed with permeabilized cells appears to be due to an unspecific reaction observed quite often with secondary antibodies (data not show"
https://openalex.org/W2022111975,"TRPM (transient receptor potential melastatin-like) channels are distinct from many other members of the transient receptor potential family in regard to their overall size (>1000 amino acids), the lack of N-terminal ankyrin-like repeats, and hydrophobicity predictions that may allow for more than six transmembrane regions. Common to each TRPM member is a prominent C-terminal coiled coil region. Here we have shown that TRPM8 channels assemble as multimers using the putative coiled coil region within the intracellular C terminus and that this assembly can be disturbed by a single point mutation within the coiled coil region. This mutant neither gives rise to functional channels nor do its subunits interact or form protein complexes that correspond to a multimer. However, they are still transported to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, wild-type currents can be suppressed by expressing the membrane-attached C-terminal region of TRPM8. To separate assembly from trafficking, we investigated the maturation of TRPM8 protein by identifying and mutating the relevant N-linked glycosylation site and showing that glycosylation is neither essential for multimerization nor for transport to the plasma membrane per se but appears to facilitate efficient multimerization and transport.

Many members share only a very distant homology to the original TRP channel. Although members of one subfamily generally have certain structural motifs in common, e.g. six ankyrin repeat elements for the TRPV (transient receptor potential vanilloid) family (3Wissenbach U.

Binding of PIP2 to the TRP domain, for example, appears to inhibit TRPV1 channels (6Chuang H.H. Prescott E.D. Kong H. Shields S. Jordt S.E. Basbaum A.I. Chao M.V. Julius D.

Certain sensing modalities, such as thermosensation, are also not restricted to one subfamily. Altering activity depending on the temperature is utilized by TRPV1–4 but also by TRPM8, TRPA1, and TRPM2 (for reviews see Refs. 11Liman E.R. Science's STKE. 2006; 326: pe12Google Scholar, 13Togashi K. Hara Y. Tominaga T. Higashi T. Konishi Y. Mori Y. Tominaga M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1804-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Here, an interchangeable, specific region has been found within the intracellular C terminus that allows TRPV1 and TRPM8 to sense temperature (14Brauchi S. Orta G. Salazar M. Rosenmann E. Latorre R. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 4835-4840Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In analogy to voltage-gated potassium channels, it is thought that four subunits need to assemble to form a functional channel. Experimental evidence for tetramer formation exists for TRPV1, TRPV2, and TRPV5/6 (15Kedei N. Szabo T. Lile J.D. Treanor J.J. Olah Z. Iadarola M.J. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol.

Because there is hardly any structural motif besides the amino acids adjacent to the pore within TM5 and TM6 and the TRP domain shortly downstream of TM6 (19Montell C. Science's STKE. 2005; 272: re3Google Scholar) that is conserved among all members, it is unlikely that there is a general mechanism of ion channel assembly that will apply to all. Although TRPM channels generally have long N and C termini, they lack ankyrin repeat structures that have been implicated to play a role in ion channel assembly for TRPV5/6 and TRPV4 channels (18Erler I.

Common to all TRPM members is a prominent putative C-terminal coiled coil region (supplemental Fig. S1), but only in the case of TRPM8, this coiled coil region is at the very end of the protein. Tsuruda et al. (23Tsuruda P.R. Julius D. Minor Jr., D.L. Neuron. 2006; 51: 201-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) show, by circular dichroism spectra, that the secondary structure of a peptide encompassing the putative TRPM8 coiled coil region indeed forms a four-stranded coiled coil that is able to form tetramers. For TRPM4, an N-terminal truncation (Δ177aa) but not a C-terminal truncation (which deletes the coiled coil region) interacts with wild type and exerts a dominant negative effect on TRPM4 function (22Launay P. Cheng H. Srivatsan S. Penner R. Fleig A. Kinet J.P. Science. 2004; 306: 1374-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). We have analyzed the domains within TRPM8 that are involved in assembling functional ion channels and delineate the role of N-linked glycosylation for subunit trafficking. We find that the very C-terminal domain of TRPM8, which has a high probability of forming a coiled coil structure, is necessary for the interaction of subunits with each other and that oligomerization can be disturbed by a single point mutation within the coiled coil region. Moreover, a membrane-anchored C-terminal domain can exert a dominant negative effect on wild-type subunits. Largely similar results concerning the role of the coiled coil region in the assembly of TRPM8 channels were obtained by Tsuruda et al. (23Tsuruda P.R. Julius D. Minor Jr., D.L. Neuron. 2006; 51: 201-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) just prior to the submission of our results, although differences exist in the interpretation of trafficking events. To analyze trafficking and assembly mechanisms in more detail, we also analyzed the role of N-linked glycosylation for channel assembly and trafficking. We have identified Asn-934 as the only relevant attachment site for N-linked glycans and investigated in detail the effects of mutating this site. Recombinant Proteins and Site-directed Mutagenesis—All N-terminal EYFP-tagged or C-terminal superecliptic pHluorin (SpH) (24Miesenbock G. De Angelis D.A. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1998; 394: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar)-tagged constructs were obtained by inserting the appropriate Phusion polymerase (New England Biolabs)-amplified hTRPM8 (NM_024080) fragments either in-frame with the EYFP coding sequence (pEYFP-C1, Clontech) or containing the consensus sequence for the initiation of translation in vertebrates followed by a start ATG for cloning into a pCAGGS vector, modified to include an EcoRV site followed by the SpH coding sequence. Constructs containing an N-terminal SpH tag were cloned into a modified pCAGGS vector that contains an EcoRV restriction site in-frame and downstream of the SpH coding sequence lacking the stop codon. In some cases, transfer of restriction enzyme-digested DNA was used to transfer inserts from one vector into the other. The purity and identity of plasmid DNA were verified by dye terminator sequencing (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using either pBTL-CT or pEYFP-TRPM8 vector as the template and appropriate mutagenesis primers and PCR conditions according to the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). Electrophysiology—Patch-clamp recordings on single transfected (FuGENE; Roche Applied Science) HEK293 or modified human embryonic kidney cells (TSA201) were performed 48–72 or 72–96 h (HEK-TRPM8) after transfection as described previously (3Wissenbach U. Niemeyer B.A. Fixemer T. Schneidewind A. Trost C. Cavalie A. Reus K. Meese E. Bonkhoff H. Flockerzi V. J. Biol.

Pipette solution contained (mm) 140 aspartic acid, 10 EGTA, 10 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 Hepes (pH 7.2 with CsOH). Bath solution contained (mm) 140 NaCl, 10 CsCl, 2 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 10 glucose, 10 Hepes (pH 7,4 with NaOH). After break-in and 80% series resistance compensation, whole cell currents were recorded every second by applying 100-ms voltage-clamp ramps from –120 to +70 mV from a holding potential of –60 mV. Currents were analyzed at –101 mV and either at +31 or +51 mV ramp potential. When the bath solution alone or 100 μm menthol in standard bath solution was locally perfused over the recorded cell, only one cell/dish was measured to prevent desensitization of other cells. Currents (pA) were divided by the whole cell capacitance (pF). Data are given as mean ± S.E. Values were not corrected for liquid junction potentials. Co-transfections were performed with 0.8 μg of EYFP-TRPM8 mixed with 1.2 μg of C-terminal constructs or 1.8 μg of TRPM8-ΔCT, resulting in a ∼2.3-fold excess over wild type. Transfected cells were trypsinated and seeded at low density after 24 h. Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments—TRPM8-stable (TRPM8s) HEK293 cells were transfected with TRPM8-SpH expression constructs, cultured for 48 h, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, treated with trypsin for 1 min, pooled after adding medium, and centrifuged for 7 min at 1000 rpm (4 °C) and then washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged for 7 min at 1000 rpm, and resuspended, depending on the size of the cell pellets in 1–2 ml of ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, and 5 mm EDTA) with added protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm pepstatin A or 1 μg/ml antipain, 0.3 μm aprotinin, and 1 mm benzamidine). The cells were lysed by sequential pipetting through three different gauges of syringe needles (0.7, 0.55, and 0.4 inner diameter). After lysis, 50 μl of the lysate was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, washed with acetone, and resuspended in loading buffer; the remaining lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants containing ∼3 mg of total protein were incubated for 2 h with 6 μg of monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (Roche Applied Science) and then with added protein G-Sepharose beads at 4 °C overnight. After 5 washes with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, the beads were resuspended in loading buffer, treated for 3 min at 95 °C, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blot analysis. Cell Surface Biotinylation—Dishes with confluent, transfected HEK, TSA201 or COS cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, washed, and treated as described in Ref. 25Mery L. Strauss B. Dufour J.F. Krause K.H. Hoth M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3497-3508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. 900 μg of protein was used as input for the avidin-agarose beads. Controls included monitoring the input of TRPM8 protein as well as testing for the absence of calnexin (endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein) in the avidin-agarose precipitant. Western blots were either probed with anti-GFP (1:500) or anti-TRPM8 (1:200), and pictures were taken with an LAS3000 cooled CCD camera. Nonsaturated signals were quantitated using AIDA (Raytest) software, and the amount bound to avidin was divided by the total amount unbound. Sedimentation by Sucrose Gradient Centrifugation—TSA201 cells transfected with EYFP-TRPM8 or EYFP-TRPM8-L1089P were harvested, and microsomal proteins were isolated according to Ref. 26Lockwich T.P.

A parallel gradient was run with marker proteins thyroglobulin, ferritin, catalase, and β-glycosidase (Sigma), and fractions were resolved on appropriate SDS-polyacrylamide gels and stained with Coomassie Blue stain. Antibodies and Reagents—Polyclonal anti-TRPM8 antibodies were generated against the terminal 24 amino acids of hTRPM8 in our laboratory and affinity-purified and used at 1:200 or 1:150 for Western blots; monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (Roche Applied Science) was used at 1:500 for Western blots, and anti-IP3RIII antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at 1:100. Bacterial Two-hybrid Experiments—Experiments were performed using the Bacteriomatch® two-hybrid system II (Stratagene) with the following modifications. DNA encoding a bait or a target protein was cloned in-frame into pTRG or the modified pBT vector (pBTL) containing a (Gly4Ser)3 linker. All constructs were sequenced. Electrocompetent bacteria (Bacteriomatch® two-hybrid system reporter strain, Stratagene) were thawed on ice and electroporated in the presence of 50 ng of pTRG constructs and 50 ng of pBTL constructs (Bio-Rad 2.5 kV, 200 Ω, 25 μF). After adding 1 ml of SOC medium (2% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.005% NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2 10 mm MgSO4, 20 mm glucose), the cells were incubated at 37 °C under shaking (225 rpm) for 1.5 h, washed once with His dropout medium, and adapted for 2 h at 37°C under shaking in His dropout medium before plating. 200 μl of bacterial culture were plated on selection plates (Stratagene) with 12.5 μg/ml tetracycline, 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol, either with or without 5 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Interactions were detected by growth and number of colonies. Stable Cell Lines and Cell Culture Conditions—HEK293 (CRL-1573; American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained in minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum in a 37 °C/5% CO2 incubator and passaged by treatment with trypsin. hTRPM8 containing pCDNA3 vector was transfected into the cells by using the SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) and selected in the presence of 500 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). Surviving cells were isolated by cell sorting, subcloned, and tested by Western blot for the presence of TRPM8 transcript and protein. For this study, we used the clonal TRPM8 cell line M8A3 where indicated. Deglycosylation Experiments—50 μg of protein of a microsomal membrane preparation (26Lockwich T.P. Liu X. Singh B.B. Jadlowiec J. Weiland S. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11934-11942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) from HEK-TRPM8 cells were incubated for 2 h in the appropriate buffers following the instructions (New England Biolabs) either with or without EndoH or NGaseF. Identification of Self-interacting Sites—To identify interacting domains within the TRPM8 amino acid sequence, we analyzed protein-protein interactions within the presumed cytoplasmic tails using a bacterial two-hybrid system (Bacteriomatch® II; Stratagene). Using the secondary structure prediction algorithm coils by Lupas et al. (27Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3483) Google Scholar), we found three weak putative coiled coil domains within the N-terminal region, and one very strong prediction of a coiled coil domain at the very C-terminal region of the protein. As shown schematically in Fig. 1A, we divided the N-terminal region into three constructs that each contain one putative coiled coil domain and tested these as well as the range of short C-terminal domains for self-interaction with the two-hybrid system. Fig. 1B shows the results of the two-hybrid screen. Strong protein-protein interaction can be found both for a distal N-terminal region that encompasses the third putative coiled coil domain as well as for those C-terminal constructs that contain the complete C-terminal CC region (terminal 42 aa). Interestingly, a C-terminal construct that contains the full CC region but lacks 69 upstream amino acids (C2) is much less potent at initiating reporter gene activity than the full C-terminal region or the construct that lacks only 29 upstream amino acids (C4), which may point toward a role of the relatively hydrophobic region between amino acids 1007 and 1047 in stabilizing the interaction. To confirm protein interactions in a more native environment, we made use of a HEK cell line that stably expresses functional TRPM8. We transiently transfected either a full-length TRPM8 construct tagged with a C-terminal superecliptic pH-sensitive GFP (wt-SpH, (24Miesenbock G. De Angelis D.A. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1998; 394: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar)) or different deletion constructs into this cell line (Fig. 2A). Cell-lysates were harvested after 48 h and incubated with anti-GFP antibody. After precipitation of the GFP antibody, we checked for the presence of the untagged wild-type TRPM8 in the protein G-Sepharose-bound fraction. As seen in Fig. 2B, the GFP-tagged TRPM8 that is also detected by the anti-TRPM8 antibody (see double bands at ∼150 kDa, indicative of post-translational modification; see below) is able to co-immunoprecipitate the untagged wild-type protein (Fig. 2B, double bands at ∼120 kDa). However, neither a short N-terminal construct nor the full-length N-terminal region with its three putative weak coiled coil regions is able to co-precipitate wild-type TRPM8. A third construct that contains the entire N-terminal region in addition to the six putative transmembrane domains (but lacks the short intracellular C-terminal region) shows an extremely reduced interaction with TRPM8. Equal levels of bound fusion protein were checked by reprobing the Western blots with anti-GFP antibody and by checking the input for unbound, untagged TRPM8. We also tested a C-terminal deletion with an intact TRP box (Δ1007–1104), which is expressed, and found that it is also unable to interact (data not shown). These results, together with the results of the two-hybrid screen, point toward a dominant role of the very C-terminally located coiled coil domain in channel tetramerization. To test this directly, we both deleted the last 18 amino acids and obtained nonfunctional channels and mutated a single hydrophobic amino acid within the coiled coil region (supplemental Fig. S1A). Leucine 1089 is in a central a position of the heptahelical repeat region of a coiled coil structure, and replacing this leucine by a proline theoretically breaks the helical structure and almost completely reduces the probability of this region to form a coiled coil structure (27Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3483) Google Scholar). We initially tested the mutant in the two-hybrid screen and found that interaction is completely abolished (Fig. 2C). Introducing the mutation into full-length SpH-tagged TRPM8 also leads to a much-reduced ability to co-precipitate wild-type TRPM8 (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, the C-terminal SpH-tagged L1089P mutant (but not an N-terminal EYFP-tagged protein) (data not shown) is not recognized by our TRPM8 antibody, which might suggest that the mutation introduced a “kink” in the structure such that the epitope (aa 1081–1104) for the TRPM8 antibody is obscured by the C-terminal GFP. Nevertheless, the L1089P construct shows strong expression when detected by the anti-GFP antibody and is also efficiently precipitated by the GFP antibody (see input in Fig. 2D). In contrast to the wild-type SpH-tagged construct (M8-SpH), the deletion constructs and the point mutant only appear at one distinct molecular weight and apparently are not post-translationally modified (see also Figs. 3 and 4). Furthermore, neither the 18-amino-acid deletion mutant nor the EYFP-TRPM8 L1089P mutant were able to form functional menthol-inducible ion-conducting channels (for EYFP-TRPM8Δ1088–1104, 0/5 cells showed a change of >1 pA/pF in current after menthol perfusion (data not shown); for EYFP-TRPM8 L1089P, 0/6 cells responded (see also Fig. 2E)). To test whether this failure results from a lack of cell surface expression, we performed biotinylation experiments. Both the lower molecular and, to a much lower degree, the upper molecular weight form of wild-type TRPM8 can be precipitated from the cell surface (Fig. 2F). Interestingly, the L1089P mutant is also biotinylated and retained by avidin-agarose, indicating that it is trafficked to the plasma membrane despite the fact that its oligomerization is greatly reduced. Cell surface expression of the TRPM8 L1089P mutant is 3–4-fold reduced compared with that of wild-type control (n = 3 independent experiments). The ER resident protein calnexin could not be detected in the fraction of proteins retained by avidin, indicating that only proteins exposed to the cell surface were biotinylated (Fig. 2F). This data would argue for the ability of TRPM8 monomers to still reach the plasma membrane. However, are TRPM8 L1089P mutants really monomers and does the coiled coil region at the very C terminus of an ion channel indeed govern its subunit assembly and tetramerization? To test this directly, we separated channel complexes by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Fig. 3A shows that, although EYFP-TRPM8 protein shows a higher concentration in fractions resembling trimer (∼450 kDa), tetramer (∼600 kDa), and higher order complexes, the EYFP-TRPM8 L1089P mutant shows a clear shift to those fractions that concentrate proteins of molecular weights corresponding to the monomer (∼150 kDa), thus confirming the much-reduced ability of this mutant construct to interact with other monomers to form oligomeric channel complexes. The finding that some protein can be detected in each fraction is likely due to overloading of the gradient and disturbances during fractionation and is also seen for the marker proteins.FIGURE 3A, mutating the CC region alters the ability of EYFP-tagged TRPM8 to form multimers.

When we co-expressed an N-terminally EYFP-tagged TRPM8 C-terminal domain (amino acids 978–1104 (CT) together with the full-length channel, we saw a reduction in the menthol-inducible currents upon co-expression (p < 0.05 for outward currents) (Fig. 3B) compared with cells co-transfected with the EYFP vector alone. Because the coiled coil domain resides at the very C-terminal region of the protein and is not very distant from the last hydrophobic domain, we reasoned that a hydrophobic anchor may be necessary for an efficient interaction. We therefore extended the amino acid sequence to include the sixth predicted transmembrane domain of TRPM8. This N-terminally EYFP-tagged construct covered amino acids 921–1104 transmembrane (TM6-CT) and efficiently suppressed menthol-induced currents after co-expression with wild-type TRPM8 (Fig. 3B). This dominant negative effect was partly reversible when amino acids 1088–1104 were deleted (TM6-CTΔ1088–1104, Fig. 3B). Because the effects are not fully reversible, it is possible that there is an upstream interaction site that is still functional. However, we could not detect a dominant negative effect upon co-expression of wild-type with EYFP-TRPM8Δ921–1104 (Δ menthol, –99 ± 26 and 483 ± 114 pA/pF; n = 5) or upon co-expression with EYFP-TRPM8 L1089P (–85 ± 15 and 324 ± 62 pA/pF; n = 8). Because menthol-induced currents are quite variable and it is difficult to control for effective co-transformation, we also expressed potential dominant negative constructs in the stable TRPM8 cell line. Fig. 3C shows that expression of CT alone does not reduce menthol responses when compared with untransfected control (wt), but TM6-CT again is very ef"

Within the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family distinct preferences for collagen types are seen. The substrate determinants that may guide these specificities are unknown. In this study, we have utilized 12 triple-helical substrates in combination with 10 MMPs to better define the contributions of substrate sequence and thermal stability toward triple helicase activity and collagen specificity. In general, MMP-13 was found to be distinct from MMP-8 and MT1-MMP(Δ279–523), in that enhanced substrate thermal stability has only a modest effect on activity, regardless of sequence. This result correlates to the unique collagen specificity of MMP-13 compared with MMP-8 and MT1-MMP, in that MMP-13 hydrolyzes type II collagen efficiently, whereas MMP-8 and MT1-MMP are similar in their preference for type I collagen. In turn, MMP-1 was the least efficient of the collagenolytic MMPs at processing increasingly thermal stable triple helices and thus favors type III collagen, which has a relatively flexible cleavage site. Gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9(Δ444–707)) appear incapable of processing more stable helices and are thus mechanistically distinct from collagenolytic MMPs.

Current studies identify at least 25 different collagen types, each with a specific role in the extracellular matrix (1Kielty C.M. Grant M.E. Royce P.M. Steinmann B.

In vertebrates, enzymes capable of cleaving the triple-helical structure include cathepsin K and collagenolytic matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; APMA, 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; Dnp, 2,4-dinitrophenyl; EAB, enzyme assay buffer; Fmoc, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl; fTHP, fluorogenic triple-helical peptide; MALDI-TOF-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry; Mca, (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl; Mob, 4-methoxybenzyl; MT, membrane-type; Orn, ornithine; RP-HPLC, reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases; THP, triple-helical peptide; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. family members. One or more of the interstitial collagens (types I–III) are hydrolyzed within their triple-helical domain by MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-8, MMP-13, MMP-18, MT1-MMP (MMP-14), and MT2-MMP (MMP-15) (4McCawley L.J.

MMP-9 cleaves the triple helix of types V and XI collagen (6Niyibizi C. Chan R. Wu J.J. Eyre D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 328-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) but not of types I–III (7Sternlicht M.D. Werb Z. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 463-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (3250) Google Scholar). Types I–III collagen are all fibrillar interstitial collagens, but differences in their sequences, glycosylation patterns, and tissue distribution have long been documented (1Kielty C.M. Grant M.E. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders: Molecular, Genetic, and Medical Aspects. Wiley-Liss, New York2002: 159-221Google Scholar, 8Bornstein P. Traub W. The Proteins,5.

For example, type I collagen has a low level of glycosylation and is found in skin, bone, cornea, and tendon, whereas type II collagen has much higher levels of glycosylation and is found in cartilage (1Kielty C.M.

Reddi A.H. Extracellular Matrix Biochemistry. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1984: 41-81Google Scholar). In a similar fashion to type I collagen, type III collagen has low levels of glycosylation but has a much more restricted tissue distribution (skin, aorta, uterus, and intestine) than type I (1Kielty C.M. Grant M.E. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders: Molecular, Genetic, and Medical Aspects. Wiley-Liss, New York2002: 159-221Google Scholar, 9Miller E.J. Piez K.A. Reddi A.H. Extracellular Matrix Biochemistry. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1984: 41-81Google Scholar). Types V and XI collagen are also fibrillar collagens (1Kielty C.M. Grant M.E.

Cell Biology of Extracellular Matrix. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1991: 7-44Google Scholar). Within the MMP family distinct preferences for collagen types are seen (11Woessner J.F. Nagase H. Matrix Metalloproteinases and TIMPs. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000: 87-93Google Scholar). MMP-1 hydrolyzes type III collagen more rapidly than type I, whereas MMP-8 and MT1-MMP show a slight preference for type I collagen compared with type III (11Woessner J.F. Nagase H. Matrix Metalloproteinases and TIMPs. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000: 87-93Google Scholar, 12Ohuchi E. Imai K. Fujii Y. Sato H. Seiki M. Okada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2446-2451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Neither MMP-1 nor MMP-8 hydrolyze type II collagen efficiently (11Woessner J.F. Nagase H. Matrix Metalloproteinases and TIMPs. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000: 87-93Google Scholar). Conversely, MMP-13 prefers type II collagen and hydrolyzes this collagen much more rapidly than MMP-1 or MMP-8 (11Woessner J.F. Nagase H. Matrix Metalloproteinases and TIMPs. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000: 87-93Google Scholar). Type V collagen is hydrolyzed by MMP-2 and MMP-9 but not MMP-1, MMP-8, or MMP-13, whereas type XI collagen is cleaved by MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-9 but not MMP-13 (11Woessner J.F. Nagase H. Matrix Metalloproteinases and TIMPs. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000: 87-93Google Scholar). Traditionally, substrate sequence is viewed as the guiding principle for protease specificity. However, it has been demonstrated that the collagen specificity of MMPs is not guided by sequence alone (13Fields G.B. VanWart H.E. Birkedal-Hansen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6221-6226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Fields G.B. J. Theor. Biol. 1991; 153: 585-602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the substrate features that may guide these specificities, such as local triple helix instability, possibly in combination with subtle variations in sequence, are unknown. Whatever the collagen specificity determinants are, they must reflect differences in MMP collagen-binding and active sites. Although complex, several steps in collagenolysis have been defined. Collagen is first bound by the MMP via secondary substrate-binding sites, termed exosites (5Overall C.M. Mol. Biotech. 2002; 22: 51-86Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Dennis M.S. Eigenbrot C. Skelton N.J. Ultsch M.H. Santell L. Dwyer M.A. O'Connell M.P. Lazarus R.A. Nature. 2000; 404: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The initial binding event is responsible for proper orientation and destabilization of the collagen molecule (16Sun H.B. Smith Jr., G.N. Hasty K.A. Yokota H. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 283: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 18Saffarian S. Collier I.E. Marmer B.L. Elson E.L. Goldberg G. Science. 2004; 306: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The collagen triple helix is unwound, and individual α1 chains are bound by the active site and subsequently cleaved in rapid succession (17Chung L. Dinakarpandian D. Yoshida N. Lauer-Fields J.L. Fields G.B. Visse R. Nagase H. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3020-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Collagenolysis-related exosites have been identified within the MMP-1 catalytic domain (prepro-MMP-1 residue numbers 202–210) (19Chung L. Shimokawa K. Dinakarpandian D. Grams F. Fields G.B. Nagase H.

Unique interactions between the catalytic and hemopexin-like domains are found in pro-MMP-1 compared with MMP-1 (25Jozic D. Bourenkov G. Lim N.H. Visse R. Nagase H. Bode W. Maskos K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9578-9585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), suggesting that binding of substrate may result in considerable conformational changes within MMPs. Ultimately, dissecting out collagen specificity elements requires identification of specific MMP-binding sites and their roles in the steps of collagenolysis. To correlate collagen selectivity with MMP structural features, we need to examine the interactions occurring between MMPs and collagen on a molecular level. Triple-helical peptide (THP) substrate models of collagen have allowed for significant advancement in the understanding of collagenolysis. For example, we recently demonstrated that MT1-MMP is much more active than MMP-1 in cleaving triple-helical collagen models (26Minond D. Lauer-Fields J.L. Nagase H. Fields G.B. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11474-11481Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The same study indicated that increased thermal stability of substrates translated into decreased ability of enzymes to cleave such substrates. However, MMP-1 and MT1-MMP were affected to a different degree, as MT1-MMP was better able to hydrolyze more thermally stable substrates. Additionally, substitution of Leu by Cys(Mob) in the P1′ subsite of a consensus MMP substrate led to increased specificity toward MT1-MMP. These observations lead us to believe that by modifying substrate sequence and thermal stability, we can better rationalize the collagen specificities of MMPs. In this study we explore the effects of substitutions in the P2 and P1′ substrate subsites on MMP triple-helical specificity. Activity has also been examined herein as a function of triple-helical thermal stability. This has required the use of “peptide amphiphiles,” in which the thermal stability of the triple helix is modulated by pseudo-lipids attached to the N terminus of the peptide (26Minond D. Lauer-Fields J.L. Nagase H. Fields G.B. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11474-11481Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 27Yu Y.C. Tirrell M. Fields G.B. J. Am. Chem.

In tandem, MMP-8 mutant triple-helical peptidase activities have been quantified to evaluate the role of Tyr210 on substrate selectivity, as this residue in MMP-1 and MMP-8 had been shown previously to be an important participant in collagenolysis (19Chung L.

After activation, MMP-3(Δ248–460) was completely removed from MMP-1 by affinity chromatography using an anti-MMP-3 IgG Affi-Gel 10 column. Pro-MMP-3 was activated by reacting with 5 μg/ml chymotrypsin at 37 °C for 2 h. Chymotrypsin was inactivated with 2 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate. Pro-MMP-2 was purified from the culture medium of human uterine cervical fibroblasts (37Itoh Y. Binner S. Nagase H. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and activated by incubating with 1 mm APMA for 2 h at 37 °C. Pro-MMP-8 was expressed in CHO-K1 cells as described previously (28Pelman G.R. Morrison C.J. Overall C.M. J. Biol.

Recombinant MMP-9 with the linker and the C-terminal hemopexin-like domain deleted (residues 444–707; designated MMP-9(Δ444–707)) was expressed in E. coli in the active form with Phe107 at the N terminus as described elsewhere. 3S. Wei and K. Brew, manuscript in preparation. The resulting MMP-9(Δ444–707) was similar to that documented previously (38Elkins P.A. Ho S.H. Smith W.W. Janson C.A. D'Alessio K.J. McQueney M.S.

Pro-MMP-13 was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) and activated by incubating with 1 mm APMA for 2 h at 37°C. The concentrations of active MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-8, MMP-9(Δ444–707), and MMP-13 were determined by titration with recombinant TIMP-1 or N-TIMP-1 over a concentration range of 0.1–3 μg/ml (39Huang W.

Recombinant MT1-MMP with the linker and C-terminal hemopexin-like domains deleted (residues 279–523; designated MT1-MMP(Δ279–523)) was purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). MT1-MMP(Δ279–523) was expressed and activated, resulting in Tyr112 at the N terminus. MT1-MMP(Δ279–523), which, in contrast to MT1-MMP, does not undergo rapid autoproteolysis, was used in the present studies because of the relatively small differences in MT1-MMP(Δ279–523) and MT1-MMP triple-helical peptidase activities noted previously (40Hurst D.R.

Both zymogens were activated as described above for the full-length pro-MMP-1 and pro-MMP-3. Active site titrations utilized either Mca-Lys-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Lys(Dnp)-Ala-Arg-NH2 or NFF-3 as substrate (29Nagase H. Fields C.G. Fields G.B. J. Biol.

MMP assays were conducted in EAB buffer by incubating a range of substrate concentrations (1.9–11.4 μm) with 10 nm enzyme at 30 °C. Fluorescence was measured on a Molecular Devices SPECTRAmax Gemini EM dual scan microplate spectrofluorometer using λexcitation = 324 nm and λemission = 393 nm. Rates of hydrolysis were obtained from plots of fluorescence versus time, using data points from only the linear portion of the hydrolysis curve. The slope from these plots was divided by the fluorescence change corresponding to complete hydrolysis and then multiplied by the substrate concentration to obtain rates of hydrolysis in units of micromolar/s. Kinetic parameters were evaluated by Lineweaver-Burk, Eadie-Hofstee, and Hanes-Woolf analyses. In a few cases, KM values were found to be slightly greater than the maximum substrate concentrations utilized, because of limitations of substrate solubility. For these circumstances, data were additionally analyzed using nonlinear regression, one-site hyperbolic binding model with GraphPad Prism 4 software. The relationship between the rate of hydrolysis and substrate concentration (below KM) for MMP/fTHP pairs for which individual kinetic parameters were determined was found to be linear, with an overall R2 value of 0.9703 ± 0.0221. MMP substrate cleavage sites were established by MALDI-TOF MS. Inhibition Assay—Stock solutions of C10-fTHP-10 and fTHP-4 were prepared as above. The following concentrations of C10-fTHP-10 were prepared in EAB buffer: 5.0, 2.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.25, and 0.10 μm. Into a 384-well plate, 36 μl of 10 nm MMP-8 was added to 36 μl of each C10-fTHP-10 concentration and incubation proceeded for 1 h at 37 °C. After incubation, 8 μlof 40 nm fTHP-4 was added to the enzyme-inhibitor complex, and fluorescence was recorded for 15 min as described above. Rates of hydrolysis were obtained as described above. Ki was determined using Dixon analysis for competitive inhibition (48Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Systems.

For this study, THPs were designed to explore the roles of substrate as follows: (a) subsite substitutions and (b) thermal stabilities on collagenolytic activity. The triple-helical specificity of MMPs was examined via substitutions in the P2 and P1′ substrate subsites. Prior experimental and computational studies indicated that these subsites may be exploited to obtain selectivity between collagenolytic MMPs (51Terp G.E. Cruciani G. Christensen I.T. Jorgensen F.S.

https://openalex.org/W2069430143,"Acetylation of proteins by p300 histone acetyltransferase plays a critical role in the regulation of gene expression. The prior discovery of an autoacetylated regulatory loop in the p300 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain prompted us to further explore the mechanisms of p300 autoacetylation. Here we have described a kinetic and mass spectrometric analysis of p300 HAT autoacetylation. The rate of p300 HAT autoacetylation was approximately fourth order with respect to p300 HAT domain concentration and thus appeared to be a highly cooperative process. By showing that a catalytically defective p300 HAT domain could be efficiently acetylated by active p300 HAT, we deduced that autoacetylation occurs primarily by an intermolecular mechanism. This was further confirmed using a semisynthetic biotinylated p300 HAT domain that could be physically separated from the catalytically defective p300 HAT by avidin affinity chromatography. Autoacetylation catalyzed by p300 HAT was ∼1000-fold more efficient than PCAF (p300/CREB-binding protein-associated factor)-mediated acetylation of catalytically defective p300 HAT. Using a novel tandem mass spectrometric approach, it was found to be possible to observe up to 17 autoacetylation events within the intact p300 regulatory loop. Kinetic analysis of the site specificity of p300 autoacetylation reveals a class of rapid events followed by a slower set of modifications. Several of these rapid autoacetylation sites correlate with an acetyltransferase-activating function based on prior mutagenesis analysis.

Among the HAT families, p300 and its paralog, CREB-binding protein (CBP), have been identified as major enzymes in the acetylation of a myriad of protein targets with a range of biological functions (2Ogryzko V.V.

The detailed contributions of these enzymes to biological function remain poorly understood. One of the challenges in characterizing the enzymatic behavior of p300 HAT domain has been the difficulty in generating p300 HAT protein in bacteria due to host cell toxicity from promiscuous acetyltransferase hyperactivity. Moreover, recombinant protein prepared using standard expression methods has been complicated to study because of its tendency to undergo autoacetylation in vivo (24Thompson P.R. Kurooka H. Nakatani Y. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33721-33729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 25Thompson P.R. Wang D. Wang L. Fulco M. Pediconi N. Zhang D. An W.

These two obstacles have recently been largely overcome by using the technique of expressed protein ligation (26Muir T.W. Sondhi D. Cole P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6705-6710Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar, 27Evans Jr., T.C. Benner J. Xu M.Q. Protein Sci. 1998; 11: 2256-2264Crossref Scopus (334) Google Scholar). In this method, a recombinant N-terminal thioester fragment is produced by intein fusion, and it is ligated via a chemoselective reaction to a C-terminal peptide fragment to produce the semisynthetic p300 HAT protein (see Fig. 1). In this way, it was shown to be possible to generate milligram quantities of semisynthetic p300 HAT in a hypoacetylated form (less than three acetyl modifications) as opposed to 10-15 acetylations observed in protein generated in standard recombinant fashion (25Thompson P.R. Wang D. Wang L. Fulco M. Pediconi N. Zhang D. An W. Ge Q. Roeder R.G. Wong J. Levrero M. Sartorelli V. Cotter R.J. Cole P.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Careful comparison of the hypoacetylated and hyperacetylated forms reveals catalytic activation, primarily reflected in reduced Km of the substrates, upon autoacetylation. Using mass spectrometric methods involving post-source decay, 13 sites of autoacetylation have been mapped, and many of these were localized to a proteolytically sensitive loop (Fig. 1) (25Thompson P.R. Wang D. Wang L. Fulco M. Pediconi N. Zhang D. An W. Ge Q. Roeder R.G. Wong J. Levrero M. Sartorelli V. Cotter R.J. Cole P.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Contributions of individual lysines to activation were analyzed by site-directed mutagenesis and several residues appeared to be important in catalytic activation (25Thompson P.R. Wang D. Wang L. Fulco M. Pediconi N. Zhang D. An W. Ge Q. Roeder R.G. Wong J. Levrero M. Sartorelli V. Cotter R.J. Cole P.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). It also proved possible to generate a loop-deleted form, and this protein appeared to be constitutively activated, suggesting the loop behaves to limit acetyltransferase action in its hypoacetylated state (25Thompson P.R. Wang D. Wang L. Fulco M. Pediconi N. Zhang D. An W. Ge Q. Roeder R.G. Wong J. Levrero M. Sartorelli V. Cotter R.J. Cole P.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Evidence that this regulatory loop is relevant to an in vivo setting with full-length p300 protein was obtained by examining cellular acetylation and transcriptional regulation with wild-type and loop-deleted forms (25Thompson P.R. Wang D. Wang L. Fulco M. Pediconi N. Zhang D. An W. Ge Q. Roeder R.G. Wong J. Levrero M. Sartorelli V. Cotter R.J. Cole P.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). These studies suggest a potentially significant biological role for p300 loop acetylation. Nevertheless, several important unanswered questions remain regarding the nature of p300 HAT domain loop acetylation. Is the autoacetylation intermolecular, intramolecular, or both? If intermolecular, can the p300-associated HAT PCAF catalyze p300 acetylation? Are there preferences for the order of sites of autoacetylation, or is it purely stochastic? Here we have investigated the biochemistry of p300 HAT domain autoacetylation to attempt to address these issues. Chemicals—N-α-Fmoc-amino acids were purchased from Novabiochem (San Diego, CA), and 14C-labeled acetyl-CoA was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Acetylated bovine serum albumin, dithiothreitol, and biotin were from Sigma. Avidin monomer was obtained from Pierce. Phenol and trifluoroacetic acid were obtained from Fisher Scientific. 1,2 Ethanedithiol was purchased from Fluka Chemie, and thioanisole was obtained from Acros Organics. Peptide Synthesis—Peptides CMLVELHTQSQDRF and CMLVELHTQSQDRFK(ϵ-biotin)G were synthesized by solidphase peptide synthesis using the Fmoc strategy with Wang resin on a Rainin PS3 machine. Biotinylation of the ϵ-amino group of the Lys was carried out using orthogonal protection with dimethyldioxocyclohexylidene removal with 2% hydrazine, and coupling with N-hydroxysuccinimidyl-biotin. The peptides were cleaved and deblocked from the resin with Reagent K (trifluoroacetic acid/thioanisole/water/phenol/ethanedithiol 82.5:5:5:5:2.5 v/v) and subsequently precipitated with ice-cold diethyl ether. Precipitates were collected by centrifugation (3000 × g, 10 min), the supernatants discarded, and the pellets washed twice with cold diethyl ether (30 ml). Precipitated peptides were dissolved in 5 ml of double-distilled water, flash-frozen, and lyophilized. Peptides were purified (>95% homogeneity) by reversed phase (C-18) high performance liquid chromatography, as described previously, using a gradient of water-acetonitrile (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid). Electrospray mass spectrometry of each peptide confirmed the correct structure. Wild-type (wt) p300 HAT and wt p300 HAT-Btn—These semisynthetic proteins were prepared and purified following previously described procedures (25Thompson P.R. Wang D. Wang L. Fulco M. Pediconi N. Zhang D. An W. Ge Q. Roeder R.G. Wong J. Levrero M. Sartorelli V. Cotter R.J. Cole P.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Briefly, pTYB2 expression plasmid encoding p300 HAT protein (aa 1287-1652) containing an M1652G mutation fused to VMA intein-chitin binding domain was grown in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)-RIL cells to and A600 of 0.45, at which point, the incubator temperature was reduced to 16 °C and the medium allowed to cool. After 15 min, protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. Cells were then grown for 16 h at 16 °C, harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in intein lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9), 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm MgSO4, and 2mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and lysed by two passages through a French press cell. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation and applied to a 10-ml chitin column after extensive washing. Excess buffer was drained, and this immobilized fusion protein was treated with 200 mm mercaptoethane sulfonate to generate the thioester and ligated to synthetic peptide aa 1653-1666 (CMLVELHTQSQDRF) or CMLVELHTQSQDRFK(ϵ-biotin)G over 16 h at room temperature. Fractions containing semisynthetic p300 HAT were pooled and concentrated before being applied to a Mono-S HR5/5 (Amersham Biosciences) strong cation exchange column for further purification. Fractions containing purified protein (>90%), as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis, were pooled and concentrated to ∼5 mg/ml, as measured by Bradford assay. Following concentration, 10% glycerol was added before flash freezing in liquid N2, and samples were stored at -80 °C. Semisynthetic proteins showed the correct molecular weights as determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization. Preparation of p300 HAT-ΔC—C-terminally deleted p300 HAT domain (aa 1287-1652) containing the M1652G mutation fused to VMA intein-chitin binding domain was immobilized on chitin as described above. The reaction was incubated for 16 h at room temperature with 50 mm cysteine and 200 mm MESNA, at which point p300 HAT-ΔC protein was eluted from the column. Fractions containing p300 HAT-ΔC domain were pooled and concentrated before being applied to a Mono-S HR5/5 (Amersham Biosciences) strong cation exchange column for further purification. Fractions containing purified protein (>90%), as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis, were pooled and concentrated to ∼5 mg/ml, as measured by Bradford assay. Following concentration, 10% glycerol was added before flash freezing in liquid N2, and samples were stored at -80 °C. p300 HAT-ΔC protein showed the correct molecular weights as determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization. Autoacetylation Kinetic Assay—Autoacetylation assays of p300 HAT were carried out using 14C-acetyl-CoA, and the production of 14C-acetylated protein was quantified after separating the components of the reaction on SDS-PAGE. The p300 HAT domains were preincubated in assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 30-μl volumes) for 10 min at 30 °C prior to initiation of reaction by the addition of 14C-acetyl-CoA (20 μm, unless otherwise specified) for 0.5-60 min, whereupon the reaction was quenched with 6 μ l of 5× SDS gel loading buffer. After running out on 10% SDS-PAGE, the gels were dried and the radioactivity quantified by phosphorimage analysis (Molecular Dynamics) relative to a 14C-bovine serum albumin standard. Assays were performed in duplicates, and these generally agreed within 20%. For acetyl-CoA Km experiments, autoacetylation assays were performed at a fixed concentration of p300 HAT domain (40 nm) and varying acetyl-CoA concentrations (0-20 μm) for 30 s. The rates obtained from these assays were fit by nonlinear least fit squares to equation 1, using the Kaleidagraph version 3.5 software package. Vm=v*[acetyl-CoA]/(Km+[acetyl-CoA])(Eq. 1) For autoacetylation inhibition experiments, by Lys-CoA (28Lau O.D. Kundu T.K. Soccio R.E. Ait-Si-Ali S. Khalil E.M. Vassilev A. Wolffe A.P. Nakatani Y. Roeder R.G. Cole P.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 589-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), varying concentrations of Lys-CoA (0-2 μm) were used with fixed p300 HAT domain (40 nm) and acetyl-CoA (20 μm) for 30 s. In all cases, the concentration exceeded p300 HAT concentration by at least 4-fold. The inhibition constant Ki for Lys-CoA was estimated using equation 2. Ki=(IC50)/{1+[acetyl-CoA]/Kmacetyl-CoA}(Eq. 2) For the electrospray ionization quantitative-Fourier transform mass spectrometry (FTMS) mapping experiments, wt p300 HAT (50-58 μm) along with acetyl-CoA (1.6 or 6 mm) were incubated in reaction buffer (20 mm sodium HEPES, pH 7.9, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol) for the time indicated and quenched with 1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. Pulldown Assays with Biotinylated p300 HAT Domain—Autoacetylation reactions were performed as above, except instead of quenching with denaturant, p300 inhibitor Lys-CoA (40 μm final) was used (28Lau O.D. Kundu T.K. Soccio R.E. Ait-Si-Ali S. Khalil E.M. Vassilev A. Wolffe A.P. Nakatani Y. Roeder R.G. Cole P.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 589-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In control experiments, it was demonstrated that, in this way, auto-acetyltransferase activity could be blocked (>95%) within 30 s. Following Lys-CoA addition, 10 μl of monomeric avidin beads were added to the reaction mixtures at room temperature for 20 min (29Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. J. Chromatogr. 1990; 510: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 2100 revolutions/min for 40 s at 4 °C. The beads were washed twice with 0.5 ml of wash buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton-X, 1 m NaCl). Following washing, the supernatants and beads were treated separately with 5× SDS gel loading buffer and the fractions analyzed using 10% SDS-PAGE. The dried gels were analyzed by phosphorimage analysis (Molecular Dynamics). PCAF Acetylation of p300 HAT-ΔC—PCAF HAT was expressed and purified as described previously (30Lau O.D. Courtney A.D.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14366-14374Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). PCAF HAT-catalyzed acetylation of p300 HAT-ΔC was performed in the autoacetylation reaction buffer described above including 20 μm 14C-acetyl-CoA using 400 nm p300 HAT-ΔC and variable concentrations of PCAF HAT (0-2 μm) over 5 min at 30 °C. Quantitation of acetylation using autoradiography was carried out as described for autoacetylation reactions. Circular Dichroism—Circular dichroism spectra were recorded on wt p300 HAT and p300 HAT-ΔC using a JASCO J-810 circular dichroism spectropolarimeter instrument. The wt p300 HAT and p300 HAT-ΔC (∼1.37 μm and 1.66 μm individually) were dissolved in buffer containing 50 mm NaF, 50 mm sodium phosphate, and spectra were recorded over a range of 185-260 nm at 42 °C. For thermal stability studies, circular dichroism spectra were monitored at fixed wavelengths (210 or 220 nm) in the range of 20-80 °C at 0.2 °C intervals. In addition, full spectra (185-260 nm) were recorded every 10 °C in the range of 20-80 °C. CNBr Digestion—Protein samples from different time points were digested by incubating with 1 m CNBr in 15% trifluoroacetic acid at 4 °C for 12-18 h in the dark. After digestion, samples were flash frozen in liquid N2 and lyophilized. The lyophilized pellets were resuspended in 100 mm NH4OAc, pH 4, 6 m urea, 5 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine and 10% CH3CN for 1 h at room temperature prior to being injected onto a Jupiter C4 reverse-phase column (4.6 × 150 mm). The digestions were fractionated in a linear gradient of 30-70% CH3CN in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 40 min at 1 ml/min. 1-min fractions were collected, lyophilized, and stored at -20 °C before mass spectrometry analysis. Electrospray Ionization Quantitative-FTMS—The lyophilized fractions were resuspended in 20-40 μl of electrospray solvent (49% CH3CN, 50% water, 1% formic acid). The peptides were directly infused into a custom-built quadrupole-FTMS hybrid instrument through nanoelectrospray nozzles using an Advion nanospray robot. The resulting ions were passed through a resistively heated metal capillary and skimmer before being externally accumulated for a total of 2sinan accumulation octupole. After accumulation, the ions were shuttled to the ion cyclotron resonance cell through a quadrupole that functions either as a simple ion guide or as a selective filter (32Patrie S.M. Charlebois J.P. Whipple D. Kelleher N.L. Hendrickson C.L. Quinn J.P. Marshall A.G. Mukhopadhyay B. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2004; 15: 1099-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Individual acetylation forms were enhanced by selected ion accumulation and SWIFT isolation (33Guan S. Marshall A. Int. J. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 158: 5-37Crossref Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Each acetylation form was dissociated using electron capture dissociation (ECD) (34Zubarev R.A. Horn D.M. Fridriksson E.K. Kelleher N.L. Kruger N.A. Lewis M.A. Carpenter B.K. McLafferty F.W. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 563-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Electrons were introduced to the cell for 100-200 ms using a dispenser cathode 35 inches from the center of the magnet. The kinetic energy of the electrons was controlled by placing a 1-2-V bias potential on the filament of the dispenser cathode. Mass Spectrometric Data Analysis—Data were collected using the modular ion cyclotron resonance data acquisition system (MIDAS) (35Senko M. Hendrickson C. Pasa-Tolic L. Marto J. White F. Guan S. Marshall A. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 10: 1824-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The isotopic distributions of each ion were fit using a least squares algorithm provided by the FTMS data analysis program THRASH (36Horn D.M. Zubarev R.A. McLafferty F.W. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2000; 11: 320-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Upon comparing the least squares fit to a theoretical fit of the distribution, the m/z values of both the monoisotopic and the most abundant isotopic peaks of the ion were determined. The loop region peptide mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry data were analyzed by THRASH, resulting in a protein list and fragment ion list that were uploaded onto the Pro-Sight PTM web server for single protein mode (37Taylor G.K. Kim Y.B. Forbes A.J. Meng F. McCarthy R. Kelleher N.L. Anal Chem. 2003; 75: 4081-4086Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The mass difference between observed ion and theoretical ion indicates modifications on the observed ion. Effect of Varying Acetyl-CoA and Lys-CoA Concentration on p300 Autoacetylation—Previous studies revealed that p300-mediated acetylation of peptide substrates proceeds with apparent Km values for acetyl-CoA in the range of 1-30 μm (and depends on the enzyme form and peptide substrate concentration) and is effectively blocked by Lys-CoA with a Ki of 20 nm (24Thompson P.R. Kurooka H. Nakatani Y. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33721-33729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 25Thompson P.R. Wang D. Wang L. Fulco M. Pediconi N. Zhang D. An W. Ge Q. Roeder R.G. Wong J. Levrero M. Sartorelli V. Cotter R.J. Cole P.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). We thus investigated the Km of acetyl-CoA for the autoacetylation process. The Km for acetyl-CoA was measured to be 3.3 ± 0.8 μm, and the IC50 for Lys-CoA <100 nm (Fig. 2). These studies indicate that coenzyme A binding is likely to be similar for p300-mediated autoacetylation reactions compared with peptide and histone acetylation catalyzed by p300. p300 HAT Concentration Dependence of Autoacetylation—A classical method for analyzing the kinetic mechanism of selfcatalyzed chemical reactions is to examine their concentration dependence. If the self-catalyzed reaction rate is first order with respect to substrate concentration, it is consistent with an intramolecular process. A self-catalyzed reaction rate that is second order or higher with respect to substrate concentration would support an intermolecular mechanism. We thus measured the rate of autoacetylation as a function of time and p300 HAT concentration using a fixed and saturating concentration of acetyl-CoA (20 μm) (Fig. 3). As can be seen, autoacetylation shows a rapid burst phase followed by a slower accumulation of product formation (Fig. 3B). Because it was not possible to find a true initial rate, we used the shortest time point (30 s) that was within a near linear range for most of the concentrations investigated. Under these conditions, a plot of product (acetylated p300 HAT) versus p300 HAT concentration showed highly cooperative behavior (Fig. 3C). A logarithmic replot of this data shows a slope of ∼4 in the range of 10-80 nm (Fig. 3D). This suggests that the reaction mechanism is approximately fourth order with respect to p300 HAT concentration. There are at least two explanations for these results. The first is that oligomerization of p300 HAT is needed for autoacetylation. In this model, four or more molecules of p300 HAT come together to facilitate protein acetylation. A second potential explanation is that initial acetylation of p300 HAT molecules leads to the enhanced catalytic power of the modified enzyme and/or enhanced p300 HAT intermolecular interaction. This behavior would be consistent with observations previously obtained for activation of p300 HAT activity by loop autoacetylation (25Thompson P.R. Wang D. Wang L. Fulco M. Pediconi N. Zhang D. An W. Ge Q. Roeder R.G. Wong J. Levrero M. Sartorelli V. Cotter R.J. Cole P.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). However, these results do not resolve the issue of whether p300 autoacetylation is intra- or intermolecular. Acetylation of p300 C-terminally Truncated HAT Domain—To further investigate the possibility of intermolecular versus intramolecular acetylation, we examined the C-terminally deleted p300 HAT domain (p300 HAT-ΔC). As described above, p300 HAT-ΔC is highly defective as a catalyst but generates soluble protein. Using circular dichroism, we showed that p300 HAT-ΔC appears to be folded and has approximately the same temperature of denaturation (Fig. 4). These data suggest that the gross structure of p300 HAT is unaffected by C-terminal deletion and that the loop of p300 HAT-ΔCis three-dimensionally similar to wild type. We thus investigated the properties of p300 HAT-ΔC in autoacetylation. As expected, it was highly defective compared with wt p300-HAT (Fig. 5, A and B). As shown, the rate of autoacetylation was 150-fold lower when measured with 2.5 μm p300 HAT-ΔC compared with 40 nm wt p300 HAT (Fig. 5B). This shows that the catalytic defect of p300 HAT-ΔC extends beyond peptide substrates and also should allow for cleaner interpretation of intermolecular acetylation experiments. Using excess p300 HAT-ΔC (40-300 nm) in the presence of a low concentration (10 nm) of wt p300 HAT, efficient protein acetylation was observed, which rose with increasing concentrations of p300 HAT-ΔC, plateauing in the region of 300 nm (Fig. 5C).FIGURE 5Acetylation of p300 C-terminally truncated HAT (p300 HAT-ΔC).

Here we report kinetic analysis of guanine nucleotide binding to eRF3 performed by fluorescence stopped-flow technique using GTP/GDP derivatives carrying the fluorescent methylanthraniloyl (mant-) group, as well as thermodynamic analysis of eRF3 binding to unlabeled guanine nucleotides. Whereas the kinetics of eRF3 binding to mant-GDP is consistent with a one-step binding model, the double-exponential transients of eRF3 binding to mant-GTP indicate a two-step binding mechanism, in which the initial eRF3·mant-GTP complex undergoes subsequent conformational change. The affinity of eRF3 for GTP (Kd, ∼70 μm) is about 70-fold lower than for GDP (Kd, ∼ 1 μm) and both nucleotides dissociate rapidly from eRF3 ( k-1mant-GDP ∼ 2.4 s-1; k-2mant-GTP ∼ 3.3 s-1). Whereas not influencing eRF3 binding to GDP, association of eRF3 with eRF1 at physiological Mg2+ concentrations specifically changes the kinetics of eRF3/mant-GTP interaction and stabilizes eRF3·GTP binding by two orders of magnitude (Kd ∼ 0.7 μm) due to lowering of the dissociation rate constant ∼24-fold ( k-1mant-GTP∼0.14s-1 ∼ 0.14 s-1). Thus, eRF1 acts as a GTP dissociation inhibitor (TDI) for eRF3, promoting efficient ribosomal recruitment of its GTP-bound form. 80 S ribosomes did not influence guanine nucleotide binding/exchange on the eRF1·eRF3 complex.

In contrast to prokaryotic RF3, activation of eRF3 GTPase activity strictly requires both the 80 S ribosome and eRF1 (10Frolova L.Y. Merkulova T.I. Kisselev L.L.

A distinguishing feature of eukaryotic RFs is that eRF1 and eRF3 form a stable complex through interaction of their C-terminal domains (12Frolova L.Y. Simonsen J.L. Merkulova T.I. Litvinov D.Y.

RNA. 1998; 4: 958-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and this physical interaction is required for stimulation of eRF3 GTPase activity by eRF1 on the ribosome (10Frolova L.Y. Merkulova T.I. Kisselev L.L. RNA. 2000; 6: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).Prokaryotic RF3 mediates recycling of RF1/RF2 from posttermination complexes (6Zavialov A.V. Mora L. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 789-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 14Freistroffer D.V. Pavlov M.Y. MacDougall J. Buckingham R.H.

Cell. 2001; 107: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). According to the current model of termination in prokaryotes, RF1 and RF2 bind to pretermination complexes that contain peptidyl-tRNA in the P site and a stop codon in the A site, and stimulate hydrolysis of peptidyl-tRNA (15Zavialov A.V. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. Cell. 2001; 107: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The affinity of RF3 to GDP is three orders of magnitude higher than to GTP (15Zavialov A.V. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. Cell. 2001; 107: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and hence the majority of RF3 is expected to be in the GDP-bound form in which it initially binds to termination complexes. After hydrolysis of peptidyl-tRNA, GDP dissociates from RF3, which then rapidly binds GTP. Formation of a high affinity complex between the ribosome and RF3·GTP induces dissociation of RF1/RF2. Finally, RF3-bound GTP is hydrolyzed, and the low affinity RF3·GDP complex dissociates from the ribosome. This model implies that ribosomal post-termination complexes containing RF1 or RF2 act as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for RF3 (15Zavialov A.V. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. Cell. 2001; 107: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar).It was proposed that eRF3 might play a role similar to that of RF3 by promoting recycling of eRF1 (15Zavialov A.V. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. Cell. 2001; 107: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, recent data suggest that GTP hydrolysis by eRF3 instead couples stop codon recognition and peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis mediated by eRF1 (16Salas-Marco J. Bedwell D.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 7769-7778Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 17Alkalaeva E.Z. Pisarev A.V. Frolova L.Y. Kisselev L.L. Pestova T.V. Cell. 2006; 125: 1125-1136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). eRF3 strongly enhances peptide release by eRF1 in the presence of GTP, but not GDP, and abrogates peptide release in the presence of the non-hydrolyzable GTP analog GDPNP even when eRF1 is in large excess, i.e. recycling of eRF1 is not required (17Alkalaeva E.Z. Pisarev A.V. Frolova L.Y. Kisselev L.L. Pestova T.V. Cell. 2006; 125: 1125-1136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Thus, whereas RF3 increases the rate of RF1/RF2 release from the ribosome, eRF3 seems to ensure rapid and efficient hydrolysis of peptidyl-tRNA by eRF1. Apparently, binding of eRF1, eRF3, and GTP to pretermination ribosomes leads to a complex that is not active in peptide release, and further rearrangement, induced by GTP hydrolysis, is required for proper positioning of the GGQ loop of eRF1 in the peptidyl transferase center (17Alkalaeva E.Z. Pisarev A.V. Frolova L.Y. Kisselev L.L. Pestova T.V. Cell. 2006; 125: 1125-1136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Thus, an apparently important difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic termination mechanisms is that in prokaryotes peptide release precedes and is required for GTP hydrolysis by RF3, whereas in eukaryotes GTP hydrolysis by eRF3 is necessary for the hydrolysis of peptidyl-tRNA and peptide release. The difference in the roles of eukaryotic eRF3 and prokaryotic RF3 in termination suggests that their affinities to GTP and GDP and their mechanisms of GDP/GTP exchange may also differ.Although the thermodynamics of eRF3 interaction with guanine nucleotides was studied previously using isothermal titration calorimetry (18Kong C.

Cell. 2004; 14: 233-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and more recently, while this article was being reviewed, by non-equilibrium filter binding technique (19Hauryliuk V. Zavialov A. Kisselev L. Ehrenberg M. Biochimie (Paris). 2006; 88: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the kinetics of interaction of eRF3 with guanine nucleotides remained uninvestigated. Here we report a kinetic study of the interaction of guanine nucleotides with eRF3 alone and with the eRF3·eRF1 complex in the absence and in the presence of 80 S ribosomes. Guanine nucleotide binding and dissociation were studied by stopped flow and equilibrium fluorescence titration techniques using unlabeled GTP/GDP and their derivatives carrying the fluorescent methylanthraniloyl (mant-) group. Our studies revealed that mutual interdependence of eRF1 and eRF3 in the termination process involves not only stimulation of GTP hydrolysis by eRF3 on the ribosome and peptide release induced by eRF1, but also stimulation by eRF1 of guanine nucleotide binding to eRF3.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals—The fluorescent GDP/GTP derivatives mant-GDP and mant-GTP were from Jena Bioscience (Jena, Germany), a 100 mm GTP solution was from GE Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ) and a 100 mm GDP solution was from Roche Applied Science.

His6-tagged eIFs 1, 1A, 4A, 4B, and 5 were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and purified as described (20Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U.T. Shatsky I.N. Mol.

Nature. 2000; 403: 332-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Rabbit aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases were purified, and native total tRNA (Novagen) was aminoacylated with Met, Val, His, and [3H]Leu as described (24Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U.T. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The specific activity of [3H]Leu-tRNALeu was 160,000 cpm/pmol. His6-tagged eRF1, eRF1(NM), and eRF3aC were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and affinity-purified by chromatography on Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen). After elution from Ni2+-NTA-agarose, proteins were dialyzed overnight against buffer B (20 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol). eRF1 and eRF1(NM) were purified further by FPLC on a MonoQ HR5/5 column, from which they eluted at 250-270 mm KCl (buffer B). eRF3aC was further purified first by FPLC on a MonoQ HR5/5 column, from which it eluted at 250-270 mm KCl, and then by FPLC on a MonoS HR5/5 column, from which it eluted at 140-170 mm KCl. After all purification steps, proteins were dialyzed overnight against buffer B. The concentrations of factors were determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm. Extinction coefficients were calculated from the amino acid composition of the proteins (25Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5023) Google Scholar). The final preparation of eRF3 was free of guanine nucleotides as was determined by HPLC (26Hemsath L. Ahmadian M.R. Methods. 2005; 37: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Gel Filtration— 400 pmol of eRF3aC and 2000 pmol of eRF1 were incubated in 200 μl of buffer A (with or without 2.5 mm MgCl2) in the presence of 100 μm GTP or GDP, or in the absence of guanine nucleotides for 10 min at 37 °C. After incubation, reaction mixtures were loaded onto a FPLC Superdex 75 column equilibrated with buffer A, which either did not contain guanine nucleotides, or contained 100 μm GTP or GDP. Fractions that corresponded to peaks of optical density at 280 nm were loaded on to NuPAGE 4-12% Bis-Tris-Gel and after electrophoresis were stained with SimplyBlue/SafeStain (both Invitrogen).Pretermination Complex Assembly and Peptide Release Assay—Pretermination complexes were assembled on MVHL-STOP mRNA in the presence of [3H]Leu-tRNALeu essentially as described (17Alkalaeva E.Z. Pisarev A.V. Frolova L.Y. Kisselev L.L. Pestova T.V. Cell. 2006; 125: 1125-1136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). 48 S complexes were assembled by incubating 3 μg of MHVL-STOP mRNA in a 400-μl reaction mixture containing buffer A supplemented with 1 mm ATP and 0.2 mm GTP, 150 μg of total tRNA (aminoacylated with Val, His, Met, and 3H-labeled Leu), 30 pmol of 40 S subunits, 100 pmol of eIF2, 100 pmol of eIF3, 100 pmol of eIF4F, 120 pmol of eIF4A, 120 pmol of eIF4B, 300 pmol of eIF1, and 300 pmol of eIF1A for 15 min at 37 °C and then incubated for 15 min with 200 pmol of eIF5, 70 pmol of eIF5B, and 35 pmol of 60 S subunits to form 80 S initiation complexes. Pre-TCs were obtained by incubating 80 S complexes with 100 pmol of eEF1H and eEF2 for 15 min, and then purified by centrifugation in 10-30% sucrose density gradients prepared in buffer A. Fractions that corresponded to pre-TCs by optical density and the presence of [3H]Leu were combined, diluted 3-fold with buffer A and used to assay peptide release. For this pre-TCs (0.15 pmol per 50 μl probe) were preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min with either 100 μm of unlabeled GTP or mant-GTP, or in the absence of guanine nucleotides, after which peptide release was initiated by addition of 1 pmol of eRF1 and eRF3aC. Peptide release was assayed using trichloroacetic acid precipitation (15Zavialov A.V. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. Cell. 2001; 107: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar).Fluorescence Stopped-flow Kinetic Measurements—Fluorescence stopped-flow experiments were done using a SX-18MV spectrometer (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK). The fluorescence of mant-GTP, mant-GDP, and mant-dGTP was excited either directly at 349 nm or via FRET from tryptophan excited at 290 nm and was measured after passing a 400-nm cutoff filter (Schott, Duryea, PA). Experiments were performed in buffer A (except when buffer A did not contain Mg2+) at 25 °C by rapid mixing of equal volumes of reactants and monitoring the time course of the fluorescence change. In all experiments, after direct excitation at 349 nm, the fluorescence of mant-nucleotides increased within a range of 10-25%, whereas excitation at 290 nm via FRET resulted in 50-130% increase in fluorescence, depending on the nature of guanine nucleotide, and the concentrations of nucleotide and eRF3. Time courses shown represent the average of at least 7 individual transients. Primary analysis for the determination of kapp was done with the package provided by Applied Photophysics. Data were evaluated by fitting to exponential functions according to the following equations. For a single-exponential fit in Equation 1, F(t)=F∞+A1e-kappt(Eq. 1) where F(t) is the fluorescence of time t, kapp and A are respectively the apparent rate constant and amplitude, and F∞ is the final value of fluorescence. The values of the association (k+1) and dissociation (k-1) rate constants, and the standard deviations were estimated from the slope and Y-axis intercept, respectively, of the linear concentration dependence of kapp. For a double-exponential fit, the time courses were evaluated according to Equation 2, F(t)=F∞+A1e-kapp1t+A2e-kapp2t(Eq. 2) where F(t) is the fluorescence at time t, kapp1 and kapp2 and A1 and A2, respectively, are the apparent rate constants and amplitudes for the first and the second components, and F∞ represents the final fluorescence. The values of the individual rate constants, k1, k-1, k2, and k-2, were calculated from kapp1 and kapp2 either analytically by building the sum and the product of kapp and plotting their concentration dependences, as described (27Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science: A Guide to Enzyme Catalysis and Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1999: 151Google Scholar), or by global fitting using Scientist software (MicroMath). The reported values of the rate constants are the averages of values obtained by the two calculation methods. The standard deviations represent ranges of maximum deviation for a given constant from either the standard deviation of the analytical solution or the statistics of global fitting.Steady State Fluorescence Measurements and Chase Titration—Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded on a Fluoromax-3 spectrophotometer (Jobin Yvon Inc., Edison, NJ) in a 10 × 10 mm (i.d.) quartz cuvette (Bel-Art products, Pequannock, NJ) at 25 ± 1 °C. All measurements were done in buffer A with or without 2.5 mm Mg2+.Binding of mant-GTP to eRF3aC was monitored using an excitation wavelength of 290 nm and an emission wavelength of 350 nm. To estimate the equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd, of the mant-GTP·eRF3 complex, the fluorescence of 0.5 μm eRF3aC was measured alone and in the presence of increasing amounts of mant-GTP. Binding of mant-GTP to eRF3aC·eRF1 was monitored using an excitation wavelength of 290 nm and an emission wavelength of 440 nm. To estimate the equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd, of the mant-GTP·eRF3·eRF1 complex, the fluorescence of mant-GTP (increasing amounts) was measured alone and in the presence of 0.1 μm eRF3 and 2 μm eRF1. Dilution was less than 2% in all cases. For analysis of the titration data, the one-site binding model in Equation 3 was used, Y=Ymax×X/(Kd+X)(Eq. 3) where X is the concentration of mant-GTP in the reaction, Y is the difference in the fluorescence intensities either of eRF3aC in the presence and absence of mant-GTP (FRET) or of mant-GTP in the presence and absence of eRF3aC·eRF1. Ymax is the maximum value of FRET. Data were evaluated using GraphPad Prism 4 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA).The equilibrium dissociation constants of the unmodified guanine nucleotides were determined by chase titration of mant-guanine nucleotides from their complexes either with eRF3aC alone or with eRF3aC·eRF1, by increasing concentrations of unmodified nucleotides. The chase of mant-guanine nucleotides was monitored by the change in fluorescence of the mant-group after excitation at 349 or 297 nm. The chase of mant-GTP from eRF3aC by GTP was measured using 0.8 μm eRF3aC, 3 μm mant-GTP, and increasing concentrations of unlabeled GTP. The chase of mant-GTP from eRF3aC·eRF1 by GTP was measured using 0.8 μm eRF3aC, 8 μm eRF1, 3 μm mant-GTP, and increasing concentrations of unlabeled GTP. The chase of mant-GDP by GDP from eRF3aC in the presence of 2.5 mm Mg2+ was measured using 0.3 μm eRF3aC, 3 μm mant-GDP, and increasing concentrations of unlabeled GDP. The chase of mant-GDP by GDP from eRF3aC in the absence of Mg2+ was measured using 0.8 μm eRF3aC, 8 μm mant-GDP, and increasing concentrations of unlabeled GDP. The chase of mant-GTP by GDP from eRF3aC·eRF1 in the presence of 2.5 mm Mg2+ was measured using 0.8 μm eRF3aC, 8 μm eRF1, 3 μm mant-GTP, and increasing concentrations of unlabeled GDP. The chase of mant-GDP by GDP from eRF3aC·eRF1 in the absence of Mg2+ was measured using 0.8 μm eRF3aC, 8 μm eRF1, 3 μm mant-GDP, and increasing concentrations of unlabeled GDP. For analyzing the chase titration data, the following model in Equations 4 and 5 were used, P+A↔KAPA(Eq. 4) P+I↔KIPI(Eq. 5) where P is eRF3aC or the eRF3aC·eRF1 complex; A is mant-GTP or mant-GDP; I is GTP or GDP; KA and KI are equilibrium dissociation constants of A and I, respectively. In this case the fluorescence of a mant-guanine nucleotide observed in the presence of a competitor unlabeled guanine nucleotide, F(I), can be described by the following Equation 6, F(I)=Fmax×[A]/([A]+KA(1+[I]/KI))+Fmin(Eq. 6) where Fmax and Fmin represent fluorescence intensities of PA and A, respectively. The equilibrium dissociation constant of unmodified guanine nucleotide, KI, was calculated by fitting the above equation to the titration data using GraphPad Prism 4.GTP Hydrolysis—To measure eRF1- and ribosome-dependent multiple turnover GTP hydrolysis by eRF3, 0.4 μm eRF3, 1.4 μm eRF1, and 80 S ribosomes (increasing concentrations from 0.1 to 2 μm) were preincubated in buffer A at 25 °C, and hydrolysis was started by adding 10 μm [γ-32P]GTP. Aliquots (10 μl) were taken at the indicated times and manually quenched with 50 mm H2SO4/2 mm KH2PO4. [γ-32P]Pi release was analyzed by ammonium phosphomolybdate extraction. Measurements of GTP hydrolysis after periods of less than 1 min were performed using a quench-flow apparatus (KinTek, Austin, TX). Samples were quenched and analyzed as described above. Blank values resulting from the presence of 3.2% Pi in [γ-32P]GTP preparations were determined in the absence of eRF3 and subtracted from all measurements.RESULTSFluorescence Changes of mant-GTP/mant-GDP upon Binding to eRF3—The fluorescent GDP and GTP derivatives mant-GDP and mant-GTP contain a mant group attached to the ribose moiety and have been widely used to study nucleotide binding by proteins. To investigate guanine nucleotide binding to eRF3, we used recombinant human eRF3aC lacking the N-terminal 138 amino acids, which are dispensable for the eRF3 GTPase activity and for its stimulation of eRF1 release activity (12Frolova L.Y. Simonsen J.L. Merkulova T.I. Litvinov D.Y. Martensen P.M. Rechinsky V.O. Camonis J.H. Kisselev L.L. Justesen J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This polypeptide is referred to as eRF3 below. Fluorescence changes of the mant-nucleotide upon its binding to a protein can be monitored either upon direct excitation of the fluorophore or indirect excitation via FRET, in which tryptophan residues close to the nucleotide binding site serve as fluorescence donors and the mant-labeled nucleotide as acceptor (28John J. Sohmen R. Feuerstein J. Linke R. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6058-6065Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 29Rodnina M.V. Fricke R. Kuhn L. Wintermeyer W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2613-2619Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Upon direct excitation at 349 nm, the fluorescence of both mant-GTP and mant-GDP increased upon binding to eRF3 without a significant shift in the emission maximum (440 nm) (Fig. 1, A and B). Upon excitation at 290 nm, substantial energy transfer occurred between tryptophan residues of eRF3 and the mant-groups in both eRF3·mant-GTP and eRF3·mant-GDP complexes, manifested as a simultaneous decrease in tryptophan fluorescence and an increase in mant fluorescence compared with the protein alone and free mant-nucleotides, respectively (Fig. 1, C and D). The G domain of eRF3 contains four tryptophan residues within 25 Å of the nucleotide binding site (Trp250 and Trp254 in the switch I region, Trp358 and Trp407; Fig. 1E), which are all close enough to contribute to FRET.Mant-GTP was fully active in translation termination. Thus, eRF1-mediated peptide release from pretermination complexes assembled on a derivative of β-globin mRNA encoding a MVHL tetrapeptide followed by a UAA termination codon was stimulated equally by eRF3·mant-GTP and eRF3·GTP (Fig. 1F).Association of eRF3 with eRF1— eRF3 and eRF1 form a stable complex by interaction of their C-terminal domains (8Zhouravleva G.

https://openalex.org/W2095024601,"Cdc7 kinase promotes and regulates DNA replication in eukaryotic organisms. Multiple mechanisms modulating kinase activity in response to DNA replication stress have been reported, supporting the opposing notions that Cdc7 either plays an active role under these conditions or, conversely, is a final target inactivated by a checkpoint response. We have developed new immnunological reagents to study the properties of human Cdc7 kinase in cells challenged with the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor hydroxyurea or with the DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide. We show that Cdc7·Dbf4 and Cdc7·Drf1 complexes are stable and active in multiple cell lines upon drug treatment, with Cdc7·Dbf4 accumulating on chromatin-enriched fractions. Cdc7 depletion by small interfering RNA in hydroxyurea and etoposide impairs hyper-phosphorylation of Mcm2 at specific Cdc7-dependent phosphorylation sites and drug-induced hyper-phosphorylation of chromatin-bound Mcm4. Furthermore, sustained inhibition of Cdc7 in the presence of these drugs increases cell death supporting the notion that the Cdc7 kinase plays a role in maintaining cell viability during replication stress."
https://openalex.org/W1997257842,"Kainate receptors have been implicated in excitotoxic neuronal death induced by diseases such as epilepsy and stroke. Actinfilin, a synaptic member of the BTB-Kelch protein family, is known to bind to the actin cytoskeleton. However, little is understood about its function at the synapse. Here, we report that actinfilin is able to bind to GluR6, a kainate-type glutamate receptor subunit, and target GluR6 for degradation. Like many members of its protein family, actinfilin acts as a substrate adaptor, binding Cullin 3 (Cul3) and linking GluR6 to the E3 ubiquitin-ligase complex. We map this interaction to the Kelch repeat domain of actinfilin and the GluR6 C terminus. Co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies show that GluR6 is ubiquitinated, and that GluR6 levels are decreased by actinfilin overexpression but increased when actinfilin levels are reduced by specific RNA interference. Furthermore, actinfilin-Cul3 interactions appear to be important for regulating surface GluR6 expression. Synaptic GluR6 levels are elevated in mice with lowered neuronal Cul3 expression and when dominant-negative forms of Cul3 are transfected into hippocampal neurons.

Using KAR knock-out mice the metabotropic inhibition of IsAHP was found to be dependent on the KA2 subunit, which interacts with Gq/11 proteins known to be involved in this modulation (6Ruiz A. Sachidhanandam S. Utvik J.K. Coussen F. Mulle C. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 11710-11718Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). KAR degradation is known to involve activity-dependent endocytosis, in which GluR6-containing receptors are sorted for recycling or degradation (19Martin S. Henley J.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4749-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination plays an important role in regulating the abundance of many synaptic proteins and destabilizing receptors within the postsynaptic density (20Pak D.T. Sheng M. Science. 2003; 302: 1368-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 21Bingol B. Schuman E.M. Nature. 2006; 441: 1144-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 22Ehlers M.D. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). The selection of substrates for ubiquitination is accomplished by an E3 ligase that consists of a complex of proteins that act together to transfer ubiquitin to the substrate at specific lysine residues. This results in the attachment of a polyubiquitin tag that targets the substrate for proteasomal degradation (23Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar). Two major families of E3 ligases have been described: the HECT domain family and the RING family, which includes the closely related Cullin proteins, Cul1 and Cul3 (23Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar). Cullin-based E3 ligases function as large protein complexes. One of the best characterized is the Skp1-Cul1-F box-Roc1 complex, in which Cul1 binds an adaptor molecule, Skp1, via an N-terminal domain, and a small RING finger protein, RBX1/Roc1, via a C-terminal domain (23Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar). Through Skp1, Cul1 associates with an F-box protein that in turn binds a phosphorylated substrate to target it for degradation. Recent studies show that Cul3 associates with substrate-specific adaptors consisting of an N-terminal BTB motif (from bric a brac, tramtrack, and broad complex) and a series of C-terminal Kelch repeats (24Pintard L. Willems A. Peter M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1681-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 25van den Heuvel S. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R59-R61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Actinfilin, an actin-binding protein of unknown cellular function, contains a BTB domain, six Kelch domain repeats, and a C-terminal PDZ binding motif (26Chen Y. Derin R. Petralia R.S. Li M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30495-30501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 27Chen Y. Li M. Neuropharmacology. 2005; 49: 1026-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Using a yeast two-hybrid screen with the GluR6 C terminus as bait, we identified actinfilin as a potential binding partner. Here, we show that actinfilin specifically binds GluR6 and mediates its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Antibodies—The monoclonal anti-myc (9E10), anti-GFP (B2), and anti-SAP97 (hDlg) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA) and used at 1:200 for immunoblotting. The monoclonal anti-PSD-95, polyclonal anti-GluR6/7 (1:500 for immunoblotting), polyclonal anti-KA2, polyclonal anti-GluR5, polyclonal anti-NR2B, and mouse anti-Kv1.4 antibodies were from Upstate (Waltham, MA). The mouse anti-GluR2 and mouse anti-actin (1:5,000 for immunoblotting) antibodies were from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). The monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody was from Sigma. The monoclonal anti-NR1 antibody was from BD Biosciences. The monoclonal anti-HA antibody was from obtained from Covance (Princeton, NJ) and used at 1:1000. The rabbit anti-GluR6 antibody was generated using as an antigen a peptide (C-GAQDD-VNGQWWG) that was predicted, from crystallographic analyses, to form part of an exposed extracellular loop in the GluR6 S1 domain; the antibody was affinity purified and used at 1:50-1:200. The rabbit anti-actinfilin antibody (1:5000 for immunoblotting) is described in Ref. 26Chen Y. Derin R. Petralia R.S. Li M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30495-30501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar. The rabbit anti-Cul3 antibody was developed as previously described (40Brodsky J.L. McCracken A.A. Semin. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) and used at 1:500 for immunoblotting. For heterologous cell and neuronal immunostaining, mouse anti-AFP (1:500) was from Q-Biogene (Irvine, CA). The goat anti-myc antibody was from Santa Cruz. The fluorescent secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Yeast Two-hybrid—The Matchmaker yeast protocol (Clontech) was followed for proper transformation of plasmid DNA in the AH109 strain of yeast, made chemically competent with the lithium acetate method. The C terminus of GluR6 was subcloned into the pGBKT7 bait vector from amino acid 852-stop, fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. GluR6-Cterm/pGBKT7 transformants were selected on tryptophan-deficient (Trp-) medium and subsequently transformed with an oligo(dT)-primed hippocampal cDNA library subcloned into pGADT7. For medium stringency conditions, positive clones were selected on triple-deficient plates (His-, Leu-, and Trp-), and viable colonies then streaked onto higher stringency media plates (-Ade-Leu-His-Trp/X-α-galactosidase), and selected for growth and blue colonies. Plasmid DNA was isolated using the RPM Yeast Plasmid isolation kit (Bio 101, Vista, CA) and transformed into Top 10F′ Escherichia coli (Invitrogen). The complete rat actinfilin cDNA and truncations were subcloned into the pGADT7 prey vector. Two actinfilin truncations were subcloned from amino acids 1-344 and 279-stop. The relative levels of interaction with the GluR6 C terminus were assessed by determining the levels of dropout in selective media of increasing stringency. Molecular Biology of GluR6 Truncations and Mutations—GFP-GluR6 was obtained from Dr. Steve Heinemann (The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, CA); GFP was inserted after the signal sequence of pcDNA3-pGluR6(Q). The myc-tagged actinfilin and its two truncations are described in Ref. 26Chen Y. Derin R. Petralia R.S. Li M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30495-30501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar. nAchRγ-HA was received from Dr. Edward Hawrot (Brown University, Providence, RI). The HA-tagged GABA-B-R1 and -R2 constructs were gifts from Dr. Steve Moss (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). The eight full-length GluR6 constructs with progressively generated stop codons (GFP-GluR6-850, -854, -868, -874, -880, -887, -896, and -904) were gifts from Dr. Geoffrey Swanson (Northwestern University, Chicago, IL). The yeast two-hybrid constructs were produced by PCR amplification, digested with EcoRI and BamHI restriction enzymes, and ligated into the vectors PGBKT7 and pGADT7 (Clontech). Alanine scanning of the GFP-GluR6-887 construct was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing prior to transfection. Rat Cerebellar Extracts—Three cerebelli from adult Sprague-Dawley rats were dissected and placed in 10 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline. The tissue was mechanically homogenized with a Tissuemizer and spun at 1000 × g to pellet debris. The pellet was then solubilized in an equal amount of 0.6% CHAPS buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.6% CHAPS + protease inhibitors (1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture containing 2.08 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1.6 μm aprotinin, 0.04 mm leupeptin, 0.08 mm bestatin, 0.03 mm pepstatin A, 0.028 mm E-64)) by pulling through syringe needles of decreasing size. The solute was spun at 39,000 × g for 30 min and the supernatant removed as the final extract. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 and COS7 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were plated onto 60-mm cell culture dishes, and grown to 70% confluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media (high glucose with l-glutamine) (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bioproducts) and a 1% penicillin (10,000 units/ml) and streptomycin (10 mg/ml) mixture (Sigma). Hippocampal neurons were cultured from E18 rats and maintained in Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 and Glutamax (28Goslin K. Banker G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). For immunocytochemistry experiments, cells were plated onto 0.1 mg/ml poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips. HEK293 cell transfections were performed with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche) following the manufacturer's protocol for transient transfection of adhered cells. Hippocampal neurons and COS7 cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. For conditions including MG132 (Calbiochem) or leupeptin (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), cells were incubated with the drugs for 4 h prior to fixation or solubilization unless stated otherwise. HEK293 Extracts, Co-immunoprecipitations, and Western Blots—48 h after transfection, cells were washed once with cold Tris-buffered saline and harvested in 1 ml of 0.6% CHAPS buffer + protease inhibitors (as indicated above). The cells were homogenized by pipetting and rotated at 4 °C for 1 h to complete solubilization. Extracts were then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min to pellet debris, removing the supernatant for immunoprecipitations and immunoblotting. For co-immunoprecipitation, extracts were incubated with 4 μg of each antibody at 4 °C overnight. The solution was then incubated with 50 μl of 50% protein G-Sepharose/Tris-buffered saline slurry for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with 0.6% CHAPS buffer, and bound proteins were eluted by boiling in sample buffer. Samples were separated by 8 or 12% SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred, and immunostained. Expression levels in the total cell extracts (starting material, SM) were established by Western blot analyses. Protein bands were visualized using Super-signal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Band intensities were analyzed using Image J software (NIH), and graphs were developed with SigmaPlot 8.0 (Systat Software). Immunofluorescence—24-48 h after transfection, cells were fixed with 1.5% paraformaldehyde + 3% sucrose, washed, permeabilized with 0.01% Triton X-100, and nonspecific binding sites blocked with 4% goat or donkey serum (depending on the source of the secondary antibody). For detection of surface epitopes, the permeabilization step was omitted; for detecting both surface and intracellular epitopes, sequential labeling was employed. Briefly, cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the relevant primary antibody, washed to remove unbound primary antibody, and exposed to Cy5-, TRITC-, or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). Labeling was visualized under fluorescence optics using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M fluorescence microscope or a Leica TCS SP2 AOBS scanning laser confocal microscope. The sizes of GluR6 puncta and their percent colocalization of GluR6 with YFP-PSD-95 or synaptophysin was determined using Image J analysis software (NIH). Cul3 Heterozygous Knock-out Mice and Synaptosome Preparation—Mice heterozygous for the Cul3 gene were as described in Singer et al. (29Singer J.D. Gurian-West M. Clurman B. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2375-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). P14 mouse brains were dissected, weighed, equalized, and homogenized in a buffer containing 0.32 m sucrose and 4 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. This solution was centrifuged at 1,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. Another 500 μl of buffer was added to this pellet, which was again homogenized and centrifuged. The supernatant was taken, and an aliquot was removed for a whole cell brain fraction extract. The remaining supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g to pellet a crude synaptosomal fraction. For analysis, 10 μl of the whole cell extract was combined with 10 μl of sample buffer. The synaptosome pellet was solubilized in 200 μl of sample buffer, then resolved via 8 or 12% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted. GST Pulldowns of Polyubiquitinated Proteins—To assess GluR6 ubiquination in brain tissue, crude synaptosomes of wild-type (Cul3+/+) and heterozygous Cul3+/- P14 mice were solubilized and denatured in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.2% SDS at 70 °C for 10 min, then diluted into 1% Triton X-100 and 5% glycerol. To prevent deubiquitination in solution, samples were kept in 1 μm ubiquitin aldehyde and 50 μm MG132 throughout. GST-S5a beads (Biomol, Exeter, United Kingdom), which are composed of the proteasomal subunit S5a conjugated with agarose, or GST-agarose beads were added to the sample for 2 h at 4°C. The S5a beads are designed to bind ubiquitinated substrates in vitro. The beads were washed with Tris-buffered saline + 1% Triton X-100 + 5% glycerol and eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Equal levels of GluR6 were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted for the presence of ubiquitin. Actinfilin Binds GluR6—Using the GluR6 C terminus as bait for a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified several cDNA clones fragments whose open reading frames encode the BTB/Kelch domain protein, actinfilin. Actinfilin (AF) was previously shown to be largely localized to the brain, especially in the cerebrum and cerebellum and is present in the postsynaptic density (26Chen Y. Derin R. Petralia R.S. Li M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30495-30501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The AF protein contains a proline-rich N terminus, followed by a POZ/BTB domain, a BACK domain, six Kelch domain repeats, and a C-terminal PDZ binding motif. Recent evidence suggests that the role of several BTB domain-containing proteins is related to protein degradation, involving Cul3 and the E3 ubiquitin-ligase pathway (24Pintard L. Willems A. Peter M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1681-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 25van den Heuvel S. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R59-R61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The localization of actinfilin in postsynaptic areas of the cerebellum suggested that actinfilin may be involved in the degradation of key proteins involved in neuronal transmission. To assess specificity and determine whether the interaction between actinfilin and GluR6 could be detected in brain we performed a co-immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 1A, top panel). We found that actinfilin specifically binds GluR6 and GluR5 in the rat cerebellum, but does not interact with the potassium channel Kv1.4, AMPA receptor subunit GluR2, or the NMDA receptor subunits NR1 and NR2B. Controls indicate specificity that actinfilin does not recognize proteins immunoprecipitated by a nonspecific rabbit antibody (IgG) or proteins pulled down solely by Protein G-Sepharose beads without added antibody (beads alone). To characterize its specificity further, we carried out additional coimmunoprecipitation assays of transiently cotransfected plasmids expressing myc-tagged actinfilin with several postsynaptic receptors and scaffolding proteins in HEK293 cells. As shown in Fig. 1A (lower panel), actinfilin binds to GFP-tagged GluR6 and GFP-GluR5, but not to GFP-GluR1, HA-tagged nAchRγ, KA2, PSD-95/SAP90, SAP97, HA-GABA-B-R1, and HA-GABA-B-R2. Actinfilin Truncation Analysis—To determine the region of actinfilin responsible for the binding to GluR6, we utilized the yeast two-hybrid binding system. Actinfilin or one of the two truncations (Fig. 1B) fused to the yeast activation domain were co-transformed with the C terminus of the GluR6/GAL4 DNA-binding domain bait plasmid (Fig. 1B). We observed that actinfilin and the Kelch repeats bound the GluR6 C terminus, but the BTB/POZ domain failed to interact. However, full-length actinfilin gave many more transformants than the Kelch region alone on high stringency media, suggesting that it exhibits a higher affinity interaction. The binding data were confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation using myc-tagged truncation constructs identical to the yeast two-hybrid constructs (37Kato A. Rouach N. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5600-5605Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These experiments confirmed that the Kelch truncation is able to bind full-length GluR6, whereas the BTB/POZ truncation cannot (Fig. 1C). Actinfilin and Cul3 Interact—If actinfilin is a member of the BTB/POZ-Kelch protein family involved in protein degradation, it might be predicted to bind Cul3, the scaffold for the Cul3-based E3 ubiquitin-ligase complex (30Cullinan S.B. Gordan J.D. Jin J. Harper J.W. Diehl J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8477-8486Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 31Furukawa M. Xiong Y. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2004; 24: 7130-7139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar). In co-immunoprecipitation experiments, myc-tagged actinfilin pulled down FLAG-tagged Cul3 (Fig. 2A). A mutant Cul3 (L52A/E55A) (33Xu L. Wei Y. Reboul J. Vaglio P. Shin T.H. Vidal M. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Nature. 2003; 425: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), designed to prevent interaction with BTB proteins was unable to bind actinfilin (Fig. 2A). Additionally, a similar Cullin, Cul1, was also unable to bind actinfilin. Significantly, when actinfilin is coexpressed with wild-type Cul3, its expression is substantially lowered, whereas neither the mutant L52A/E55A Cul3 nor Cul1 exerted any substantial effect on actinfilin levels (Fig. 2B). This suggests that the Cul3 ubiquitin-ligase complex may also affect the adaptor protein actinfilin as well as the substrate. The actinfilin-Cul3 interaction, as expected for this protein family, occurs within the BTB/POZ domain. The FLAG-Cul3 immunoprecipitated the myc-tagged BTB/POZ actinfilin truncation, whereas the Kelch truncation (lacking the BTB domain) did not (Fig. 2C). Actinfilin Promotes GluR6 Degradation—To examine the effects of actinfilin on GluR6 abundance, localization, or sequestration in organelles, we co-transfected actinfilin and GFP-GluR6 into COS-7 cells. When expressed alone, GFP-GluR6 exhibited a punctate staining throughout the cell. However, upon introducing myc-tagged actinfilin, immunostaining for GluR6 was abrogated (Fig. 3A), suggesting that actinfilin promotes degradation of this kainate receptor subunit. This hypothesis was confirmed immunocytochemically by the use of proteasomal inhibitors and by co-expression of dominant-negative constructs to shift the equilibrium away from GluR6 degradation (Fig. 3A). The hypothesis was further substantiated by immunoblotting for total GluR6 levels (Fig. 3C). We found that the GFP-GluR6 signal is restored by treatment with the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 (25 μm) for 4 h prior to fixation (Fig. 3, A, third panel, and C, lane 4). The lysosomal inhibitor leupeptin (10 μg/ml, 4 h incubation) exerted a weaker effect (Fig. 3, A, fourth panel, and C, lane 5), suggesting that actinfilin promotes degradation primarily through proteasomal pathways. Consistent with these pharmacological results, we found that co-expression of the Cul3 mutant L52A/E55A that prevents interaction with BTB proteins, but not wild-type Cul3, blocked GluR6 degradation (Fig. 3, A, fifth versus sixth panels, and C, lane 6). Similarly, co-expression of HA-tagged ubiquitin K48R, which prevents the attachment of Lys48 branched ubiquitin chains, partially elevated GluR6 levels (Fig. 3, A, seventh panel, and C, lane 3). As a control, we tested if actinfilin affected the expression of the GFP; none was observed (Fig. 3A, eighth panel). GluR6 Is Ubiquitinated in Vitro—To determine whether GluR6 is ubiquitinated in cell culture, we co-transfected a myc-tagged GluR6 construct with an HA-tagged ubiquitin, immunoprecipitated the GluR6, and immunoprobed for the HA signal. The level of ubiquitinated GluR6 was low (Fig. 3B). However, treatment with the proteasomal inhibitor, MG132 (25 μm), for 4 h prior to extraction greatly enhanced the amount of ubiquitinated GluR6 in the cells (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, actinfilin can also be ubiquitinated (Fig. 3D). Based on all preceding data, we hypothesize that actinfilin is acting as an intermediary between GluR6 and Cul3, enabling the ubiquitination of GluR6 (Fig. 3E). Truncation and Mutational Analysis of the Actinfilin-GluR6 Interaction—To identify region(s) on GluR6 that are required for the actinfilin interaction, we utilized a series of C-terminal deletion constructs (Fig. 4A). Co-transfecting GluR6 truncations with myc-actinfilin in HEK293 cells suggested that only the GFP-G6-887 truncation and the full-length constructs can bind actinfilin (Fig. 4B). We conclude that a region encompassing amino acids 881-886, containing a unique hydrophobic sequence APVIV is critical for GluR6-actinfilin binding. It should be noted that total levels of these truncation constructs correspond with the amount of actinfilin binding, as both the GFP-G6-887 and full-length GluR6 exhibited lower total expression than the other truncation constructs. Thus, binding of actinfilin leads to receptor degradation. Immunocytochemical analyses confirmed these results (Fig. 4C). To map the residue(s) in the hydrophobic region that influence actinfilin binding, we performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis in the GFP-GluR6-887 construct, which was more resistant to degradation (Fig"

By microarray analysis of hepatic genes from female Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats treated with the FXR agonist GW4064, we have identified dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase-1 (DDAH1) as an FXR target gene. DDAH1 is a key catabolic enzyme of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), a major endogenous nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor. Sequence analysis of the DDAH1 gene reveals the presence of an FXR response element (FXRE) located 90 kb downstream of the transcription initiation site and within the first intron. Functional analysis of the putative FXRE demonstrated GW4064 dose-dependent transcriptional activation from the element, and we have demonstrated that the FXRE sequence binds the FXR-RXR heterodimer. In vivo administration of GW4064 to female ZDF rats promoted a dose-dependent and >6-fold increase in hepatic DDAH1 gene expression. The level of serum ADMA was reduced concomitantly. These findings provide a mechanism by which FXR may increase endothelium-derived nitric oxide levels through modulation of serum ADMA levels via direct regulation of hepatic DDAH1 gene expression. Thus, beneficial clinical outcomes of FXR agonist therapy may include prevention of atherosclerosis and improvement of the metabolic syndrome.

The global epidemic of obesity has led to an increasing prevalence of metabolic syndrome, a wide spectrum of metabolic risk factors characterized by abdominal obesity, low levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol, high triglycerides, hypertension, glucose intolerance, and a systemic proinflammatory state. These risk factors are closely associated with incidence of cardiovascular disease, a leading cause of mortality in industrialized nations (1Eckel R.H. Grundy S.M. Zimmet P.Z. Lancet. 2005; 365: 1415-1428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4851) Google Scholar, 2Grundy S.M. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 295-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In the last decade, several ligand-activated nuclear receptors, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, liver X receptors, and thyroid hormone receptors, have emerged as promising targets for pharmacological intervention in the treatment of metabolic syndrome (3Shulman A.I. Mangelsdorf D.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 353: 604-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Nuclear receptors are transcription factors that serve as intracellular sensors for endocrine hormones and lipid metabolites, such as bile acids, fatty acids, oxysterols, and xenobiotics. To control a variety of physiological processes, receptors bind to specific cis-acting DNA elements and regulate the expression of target genes by cofactor recruitment upon activation by ligands (4Kalaany N.Y. Mangelsdorf D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2006; 68: 159-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Based on their pharmacological and ligand-binding properties, the nuclear receptor superfamily can be divided into three groups (5Berkenstam A. Gustafsson J.A. Curr. Opin.

Because FXR has been identified as a modulator of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, development of a synthetic FXR agonist for treatment of dyslipidemia and diabetes, two important indicators of metabolic syndrome, appears to be an attractive therapeutic approach. The potent synthetic FXR agonist GW4064 reduces triglyceride and increases high density lipoprotein cholesterol when administrated to Fisher rats and improves insulin sensitization in genetically obese ob/ob mice and lowers blood glucose levels in diabetic db/db mice (25Zhang Y.

In the present study, we have shown that GW4064 increases hepatic expression of the dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase-1 (DDAH1) gene (but not DDAH2 gene) that is accompanied by a reduction in serum asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), a substrate of DDAH1 enzyme (28Ogawa T.

Because ADMA is a nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor and nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in protection against the onset and progression of cardiovascular disease, reduction of plasma ADMA levels through FXR activation may lead to overall improvement of vascular health. Animal Care and Treatment—Female ZDF rats were purchased from Charles River (Wilmington, MA). Animals were acclimated for one week prior to study initiation. Rats were individually housed in polycarbonate cages with filter tops. All animals received deionized water and 5008 Diet (PMI Nutrition International, Brentwood, MO) ad libitum and were maintained in accordance with the Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee of Eli Lilly and Company and the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Use and Care of Laboratory Animals. FXR agonist GW4064 was administered twice daily for nine days by oral gavage at the indicated doses (Figs. 1, 5, and 6). Animals were sacrificed, and serum and liver were collected and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for later use.FIGURE 5FXR regulates serum ADMA and arginine levels. A, serum ADMA levels in female ZDF rats treated orally with GW4064 for nine days. Average ADMA levels for each group are shown (n = 6, ±S.E.).

RNA was further purified using RNeasy™ columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Equal amounts of RNA from each animal within treatment groups were pooled (n = 6/group), and samples were prepared for GeneChip™ analysis according to the Affymetrix eukaryotic expression sample protocol revision 1 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Samples were then hybridized to RAE230A oligonucleotide arrays. Data analysis and mining were performed using the Affymetrix Microarray Suite (MAS version 4.0) and data mining tool (DMT version 2.0) software. Real-time PCR Analysis of Gene Expression—Real-time quantitative PCR was performed using the 5′ fluorogenic nuclease assay and an ABI 7900 Prism system (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) to determine the relative abundance of assayed mRNAs. Samples were normalized by determining the relative abundance as compared with 36B4 mRNA. Real-time quantitative PCR primer-probe sets for rat DDAH1 (Rn00574200_m1), rat SHP (Rn00589173_m1), rat PEPCK (Rn001529008_g1), rat glucose-6-phosphatase (Rn00565347_m1) and rat 36B4 (Rn00821065_g1) were obtained from Taqman Assays-on-demand Gene Expression Products (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). PCR reactions were run in quadruplicate 10-μl reactions in 384-well plates that contained Universal Master Mix (PE Applied Biosystems), 2 pmol of each forward and reverse primer, 1.5 pmol of probe, and cDNA. Data are shown as mean ± S.E. Reporter Constructs—A 470-bp DNA sequence (90 kb downstream from the transcription initiation site) containing the conserved FXRE in the DDAH1 intron 1 region was PCR-amplified from rat genomic DNA using primers 5′-CGCCGTGTACCCAGTTTTATGTCTA-3′ and 5′-CTTAATACCTCATGGATCCCGACCT-3′. The PCR product was subsequently cloned into the pGL3-tk-LUC, which contains the minimal thymidine kinase promoter (bases –105 to +51) linked to the luciferase gene. This construct was designated pGL3-tk-DDAH1 enhancer-luc. Point mutations were introduced in the FXRE using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The primers used were 5′-CACACTTATTCCGGAATCAATGATTAATTTTAAGGGAAAC-3′ and 5′-GTTTCCC TTAAAATTAATCATTGATTCCGGAATAAGTGTG-3′, where the mutated bases are indicated in bold. The presence of the mutation was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. Transient Transfections and Luciferase Assays—Human epithelial kidney cell line HEK293T was maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For transient transfection of HEK293 cells, 2 × 104 cells were seeded into 96-well plates and transfected using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each transfection contained 20 ng of luciferase reporter and 20 ng of each cytomegalovirus (CMV)-driven expression plasmid where indicated (pCMV6-FXR, pCMV6-RXR). FXR agonist GW4064 was added to the medium 24 h after transfection and incubated for another 24 h. Firefly luciferase activity in the cell extract was then measured using standard luciferase substrate reagents (BD Biosciences). All experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times. Data are shown as mean ± S.E. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—Oligonucleotides corresponding to the conserved FXRE in the DDAH1 promoter were synthesized (Operon, Huntsville, AL) as follows: wild type, 5′-ctagCTTATTCCGGGGTCAATGACCAATTTTAAGG-3′ and 5′-ctagCCTTAAAATTGGTCATTGACCCCGGAATAAG-3′; mutant, 5′-CTTATTCCGGAATCAATGATTAATTTTAAGG-3′ and 5′-CCTTAAAATTAATCATTGATTCCGGAATAAG-3′. The FXR/RXR binding sites are underlined and the mutations are designated in bold. Oligonucleotide pairs were resuspended in 100 mm NaCl solution, heated at 70 °C for 10 min, and annealed slowly, cooling to room temperature. Annealed oligonucleotides were radiolabeled by Klenow labeling using [α-32P]dCTP and purified using G-50 microcolumns (Amersham Biosciences). Nuclear extracts were prepared from cultured cells by the method of Dignam et al. (30Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9150) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by a modified Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). FXR and RXR proteins were translated in vitro with the TnT T7 quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega, Madison, WI), using full-length cDNA for FXR and RXR as DNA template. DNA-binding assays were performed as described previously (31Scott G.K. Daniel J.C. Xiong X. Maki R.A. Kabat D. Benz C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19848-19858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear protein was incubated with 15,000 cycles/min of probe in 1× EMSA buffer (final concentrations: 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 75 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC)) for 30 min on ice. For the competition assays, the nonradiolabeled DDAH1 or IR-1 from the phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) gene (5′-CTAGAAAACTGAGGGTCAGTGACCCAAGTGAAG-3′) double-stranded oligonucleotide was added simultaneously with the labeled probe. The resulting DNA-protein complexes were resolved using 6% polyacrylamide gels with 1× TBE electrophoresis buffer (89 mm Tris base, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA). Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. ADMA/NOS Pathway Metabolite Analysis—NG,NG-Dimethyl-l-arginine (ADMA) dihydrochloride, NG,NG′-dimethl-l-arginine (SDMA) dihydrochloride NG-monomethyl-l-arginine (MMR) monoacetate were purchased from Calbiochem. Arginine, homoarginine, citrulline, and ortho-phthaldehyde were purchased from Sigma. Methanol, ammonia, and acetonitrile were of high pressure liquid chromatography grade. ADMA was analyzed as previously described by Teerlink et al. (32Teerlink T. Nijveldt R.J. de Jong S. van Leeuwen P.A. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 303: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) with modifications. The method was cross-validated by direct quantitation using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Briefly 100–200 μl of EDTA plasma or serum was diluted in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen), treated with 8 μm MMR, mixed, and loaded onto 30-mg OASIS 30-mg MCX cation exchange columns in 96-well plate format without pretreatment of solid phase. Samples were washed one time with 1 ml of 100 mm HCl followed by a second wash with 1 ml of methanol. ADMA and NOS pathway analytes were eluted twice with 0.7 ml of ammonia:water:methanol (10: 40:50). The combined eluent was dried under N2 at 60 °C in a 96-well plate evaporator. Dried samples were reconstituted in 100 μl of water and transferred to a clean plate or vials for OPA derivatization. Cross-validation samples were reconstituted in 90% acetonitrile and injected onto a 2.1 × 150-mm 5-μ Atlantis HILIC column with a 20-mm guard column (Waters, Bedford, MA). Citrulline, Arg, homoarginine, SDMA, and ADMA were eluted upon a gradient from 90% acetonitrile in 10 mm ammonium formate, 0.4% formic acid to 50% acetonitrile in 10 mm ammonium formate, and 0.4% formic acid. Multiple reaction monitoring transitions were as follows: 203.1→172.1 SDMA, 203.1→115 ADMA, 189.1→158.1 MMR, 175.1→116 Arg, and 176.1→159.1 citrulline. Study samples were derivatized with ortho-phthaldehyde as previously described (32Teerlink T. Nijveldt R.J. de Jong S. van Leeuwen P.A. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 303: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), injected onto a 3.0 × 150-mm Luna C18 (2Grundy S.M. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 295-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) column equipped with a 4-mm precolumn (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA), and eluted under isocratic conditions (8.7% acetonitrile in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5). Detection was at excitation and emission wavelengths of 340 and 455 nm, respectively. Response factors generated from peak areas for ADMA, SDMA, homoarginine and citrulline relative to MMR were used to interpolate concentration from 8-point standard curves between 50 nm and 10 μm ADMA, ADMA, citrulline, and homoarginine and between 0.5 nm and 300 μm arginine. ADMA was expressed alone and also normalized to either SDMA or arginine. In the case of the latter, this was referred to as the NOS impairment index. In an attempt to study the hepatic pharmacology of FXR agonist GW4064, liver gene expression profiles from insulin-resistant female ZDF rats treated for 9 days with doses of GW4064 ranging from 10–100 mg/kg were analyzed. Pools of total RNA isolated from liver were hybridized to Affymetrix RAE230A oligonucleotide arrays representing 10,011 rat genes. An increase or decrease of 1.5-fold in mRNA levels was used as a threshold to define significant gene regulation. A total of 452 genes on the arrays exhibited significant expression changes in GW4064-treated rat livers, with the expression of 239 genes being increased and 213 genes being decreased. Identified genes displaying dose-dependent expression changes upon treatment include previously well characterized FXR target genes, such as small heterodimer partner (SHP) (10Goodwin B. Jones S.A.

Using quantitative real-time PCR (Q-RT-PCR), we confirmed GW4064 dose-dependent elevations of DDAH1 mRNA with a peak induction of >6-fold at the highest dose of 100 mg/kg (Fig. 1A). Similarly, the changes of gene expression in SHP, PEPCK, and glucose-6-phosphatase were also confirmed by Q-RT-PCR (Fig. 1, B–D). To determine whether DDAH1 is a direct target gene of FXR, we aligned rat and human genome sequences using the online whole-genome navigation tool ECR Browser and identified an evolutionarily conserved region (ECR) between rat and human DDAH1 genes. Because critical regulatory elements are most likely located in the regions conserved between rodent and human, the ECRs were then scanned by the rVISTA program for FXRE sequences that are typified by an inverted repeat of the AG(G/T)TCA hexad containing a single nucleotide spacer or IR-1 element. The human DDAH1 gene region that was scanned spanned >100 kb upstream of the transcription initiation site. Three putative FXREs in the 5′-flanking region and one putative FXRE in the 108-kb intron 1 region were identified. Within the 5′-flanking region, the sequence of the putative FXRE located ∼–108 kb upstream of the DDAH1 coding region is AGGTTAtAAATTC, the putative FXRE located approximately –81 kb upstream is AAGTCAaCAACCC, and the putative FXRE located approximately –19 kb upstream is ATGTTAtAAACCC. The half-sites within these putative elements resembled nuclear receptor binding sites, but they deviated from consensus core sequences. On the other hand, the intronic FXRE located 90 kb downstream of the transcription initiation site showed higher similarity to the consensus IR-1 element GGGTCAaTGACCA (Fig. 2). To generate a chimeric rat DDAH1-luciferase reporter construct, a 470-bp fragment encompassing the rat intron 1 FXRE was inserted upstream of the luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 3). The ability of FXR to transactivate luciferase expression was examined by transient transfection of this reporter construct into human epithelial kidney cell line HEK293T. In the presence of exogenously co-expressed FXR protein, the DDAH1-enhancer-luciferase reporter responded positively to GW4064 treatment in a dose-dependent manner, with a peak induction of 7-fold at the 1 μm concentration (Fig. 3A). When co-transfected with both FXR and RXR expression vectors, basal activation of the reporter was elevated by 4-fold, as compared with co-transfection with the FXR expression vector alone. GW4064 caused a dose-dependent elevation in reporter activity, resulting in 5.4-fold induction at the 1 μm concentration (Fig. 3A). This level of induction by GW4064 is consistent with the transcription induction potential that is promoted by a reporter construct containing two copies of the IR-1 sequence from the PLTP promoter linked to luciferase. This construct was activated by both FXR and RXR in a similar manner, although the maximal fold induction was 14-fold over basal (Fig. 3B). Mutation of the putative FXRE from the rat DDAH1 intron 1 reporter construct significantly reduced basal transcription levels and ablated the ability of GW4064 to induce reporter expression (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these data demonstrate that intron 1 of the rat DDAH1 genomic sequence contains a functional FXRE that has the potential to promote a transcriptional response to levels comparable with well characterized hepatic FXR target genes in the presence of an FXR agonist.FIGURE 3Activation of the rat DDAH1 intronic enhancer sequence by FXR through the FXR response element.

We found that gastrocnemius muscle from food-deprived rats shows acute rises in peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) gamma coactivator (PGC) -1alpha/PPAR delta nuclear protein and myosin heavy chain (MHC) Ib protein, while type I fibers accumulate and the muscle tissue appears redder. AMP levels, phosphorylation of both AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and its downstream target acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) are induced within 6 h. Rapidly increased MyoD mRNA levels are followed by an increase in uncoupling protein (UCP) 3 (UCP3) transcription. Increased serum fatty acid levels coincide with increases in mitochondrial UCP3 protein levels and fatty acid oxidation. Accompanying this is a decrease in AMPK phosphorylation, reversible upon nicotinic acid treatment, indicating that fatty acids may modulate this kinase's activity after the metabolic challenges posed by food deprivation."
https://openalex.org/W2071276787,"The macromolecular tRNA synthetase complex consists of nine different enzymes and three non-enzymatic factors. This complex was recently shown to be a novel signalosome, since many of its components are involved in signaling pathways in addition to their catalytic roles in protein synthesis. The structural organization and dynamic relationships of the components of the complex are not well understood. Here we performed a systematic depletion analysis to determine the effects of structural intimacy and the turnover of the components. The results showed that the stability of some components depended on their neighbors. Lysyl-tRNA synthetase was most independent of other components for its stability whereas it was most required for the stability of other components. Arginyl- and methionyl-tRNA synthetases had the opposite characteristics. Thus, the systematic depletion of the components revealed the functional reason for the complex formation and the assembly pattern of these multi-functional enzymes and their associated factors. The macromolecular tRNA synthetase complex consists of nine different enzymes and three non-enzymatic factors. This complex was recently shown to be a novel signalosome, since many of its components are involved in signaling pathways in addition to their catalytic roles in protein synthesis. The structural organization and dynamic relationships of the components of the complex are not well understood. Here we performed a systematic depletion analysis to determine the effects of structural intimacy and the turnover of the components. The results showed that the stability of some components depended on their neighbors. Lysyl-tRNA synthetase was most independent of other components for its stability whereas it was most required for the stability of other components. Arginyl- and methionyl-tRNA synthetases had the opposite characteristics. Thus, the systematic depletion of the components revealed the functional reason for the complex formation and the assembly pattern of these multi-functional enzymes and their associated factors. Since many cellular proteins exert their biological effects via the formation of macromolecular complexes, it is important to understand the pattern of assembly and dynamic relationships of the components of such complexes. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) 3The abbreviations used are: ARS, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase; AIMP, ARS-interacting multi-functional protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA; RNAi, RNA interference; EPRS, glutaminyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; IFN, interferon; QRS, glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase; MRS, methionyl-tRNA synthetase; KRS, lysyl-tRNA synthetase; DRS, aspartyl-tRNA synthetase; RRS, arginyl-tRNA synthetase; IRS, isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase; LRS, leucyl-tRNA synthetase; WRS, tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase; RT, reverse transcription. are essential enzymes catalyzing the ligation of their cognate amino acids and tRNAs in the process of translation. In higher eukaryotes, nine different enzymes form a macromolecular complex with three non-enzymatic factors (ARS-interacting multifunctional protein): AIMP1/p43, AIMP2/p38, and AIMP3/p18 (1Park S.G.

Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3725-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Although the existence of this complex has been known for many years, the reason for its formation and the connections between its components remain unclear. Many of the enzymes of the complex perform other roles in addition to their enzymatic functions. For instance, EPRS (glutaminyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase) forms a novel gene silencing complex with ribosomal subunit L13a and GAPDH (3Sampath P. Mazumder B. Seshadri V. Gerber C.A. Chavatte L.

QRS (glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase) and MRS (methionyl-tRNA synthetase) are involved in anti-apoptotic regulation and rRNA biogenesis, respectively (4Ko Y.G. Kim E.Y. Kim T. Park H. Park H.S. Choi E.J.

Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). KRS (lysyl-tRNA synthetase) has the most diverse activities of the complex-forming enzymes, activating mast cells by generating Ap4A as a secondary catalytic product (6Lee Y.N. Nechushtan H. Figov N. Razin E. Immunity. 2004; 20: 145-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), being involved in human immunodeficiency virus assembly via interaction with the viral Gag protein (7Halwani R. Cen S. Javanbakht H. Saadatmand J. Kim S. Shiba K. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 7553-7564Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and being secreted as a pro-inflammatory cytokine (8Park S.G.

In addition, the ARS-interacting factors AIMP1, -2, and -3 occupy individual niches in cell regulation. For instance, AIMP1 acts as a cytokine with diverse activities (9Park S.G. Shin H. Shin Y.K.

AIMP2 down-regulates c-Myc during lung cell differentiation (13Kim M.J. Park B.J. Kang Y.S. Kim H.J. Park J.H. Kang J.W. Lee S.W. Han J.M. Lee H.W. Kim S. Nat.

In view of the multifunctional nature of these essential enzymes and factors, understanding their assembly should provide important insight into the mechanism of protein synthesis and into cellular regulatory mechanisms. Several approaches have been used to probe the assembly of the complex (17Robinson J.C. Kerjan P. Mirande M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 24Norcum M.T. Warrington J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17921-17924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). One proposed model of its structural organization derived from these studies divides the complex into three subdomains (19Norcum M.T. Warrington J.A. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). DRS, MRS, and QRS are placed in one subdomain, the second is composed of KRS and RRS, and the third of the high molecular weight EPRS, IRS, and LRS. The three AIMPs, AIMP1/p43, AIMP2/p38, and AIMP3/p18, are thought to connect the subdomains and stabilize the overall structure. AIMP1 is located in the middle of the complex (24Norcum M.T. Warrington J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17921-17924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and associates with RRS (arginyl-tRNA synthetase) via its N-terminal region (25Park S.G. Jung K.H. Lee J.S. Jo Y.J. Motegi H. Kim S. Shiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16673-16676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). AIMP2 is linked to many components (17Robinson J.C. Kerjan P. Mirande M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 20Quevillon S. Robinson J.C. Berthonneau E. Siatecka M. Mirande M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and was shown to be critical for the assembly of the complex (26Kim J.Y. Kang Y.S. Lee J.W. Kim H.J. Ahn Y.H. Park H. Ko Y.G. Kim S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7912-7916Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The contribution of AIMP3 to complex formation is yet to be determined. To understand the structural significance of each component for complex formation and the reason for its formation, we systematically depleted each component by the siRNA technique and determined how this affected the stability of the other components, as well as protein synthesis. The results revealed that the stability of the components is affected by formation of the complex but that the extent of the dependence varies among the components. KRS was found to be the most independent of complex formation for its stability and at the same time the most important for the stability of the complex as a whole, whereas RRS and MRS had the opposite characteristics, suggesting some form of hierarchical arrangement of the complex. Cell Culture—HeLa cells derived from cervical cancer cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin in a 5% CO2 incubator. Western Blot Analysis—For Western blotting, HeLa cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 10 μm sodium fluoride, 10 μm β-glycerophosphate, 1 μm sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4), and protease inhibitors). Whole cell lysates were boiled in 5× sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 86 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 2% SDS) for 5 min. 40 μg of protein extract per lane was subjected to electrophoresis, transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore), and immunoblotted with antibodies specific to AIMP1, AIMP2, AIMP3, KRS, RRS, QRS, MRS, LRS, IRS, and EPRS. As a control, the same membrane was stripped and immunoblotted with anti-tubulin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The membrane was washed and treated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Pharmacia Corp.). RNA Interference (RNAi)—RNAi duplexes corresponding to AIMP1, AIMP2, AIMP3, KRS, RRS, QRS, MRS, LRS, IRS, and EPRS were synthesized (Invitrogen). For the siRNA experiment, 2 × 105 HeLa cells were plated in 6-well plates (dishes), and all transfections of siRNA (20 pm) were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested after 48 h. The effect of siRNA on the expression of ARS complex components was measured by Western blot analysis. As a control, we used Stealth RNAi Negative Control Duplexes (Invitrogen). Quantitative RT-PCR—The transcript levels of the components of the multi-tRNA synthetase complex were determined by quantitative RT-PCR. Total RNAs were isolated from siRNA-transfected cells and converted to cDNAs using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and an anchored oligo(dT) primer set. The resulting cDNAs were used as templates for PCR ampification with specific primer pairs. As a control, GAPDH was also quantified by RT-PCR from the same RNA samples. Gel Filtration Chromatography—The proteins extracted from cells were subjected to sizing chromatography using Sephacryl S-300 (separation range 10-1,500 kDa) in an AKTA FPLC system (Pharmacia Corp.), as described previously (8Park S.G. Kim H.J. Min Y.H. Choi E.C. Shin Y.K. Park B.J. Lee S.W. Kim S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6356-6361Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The separated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blotting with antibodies specific for each of the components. Systematic Depletion of Components of the Multi-ARS Complex—We depleted each component of the complex with siRNA. To determine the most effective siRNA for suppressing each of the components, we prepared three different siRNAs designed to target each transcript, tested their efficacy (data not shown), and selected the most effective siRNA (Table 1). Since four different siRNAs targeting the DRS transcript did not have sufficient suppressing effects, for unknown reasons (data not shown), we excluded DRS from the analysis. Apart from the siRNA that only suppressed the QRS transcript to about 55% of the control, all the other siRNAs silenced their target mRNAs adequately in HeLa cells, as demonstrated by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 1A) and real-ime RT-PCR (supplemental Table 1 and supplemental Fig. 1). Suppression of each transcript did not reduce expression of the other components (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. 1).TABLE 1siRNA sequences targeting each of the components of the multi-tRNA synthetase complexTargetsiRNA sequence (5′ to 3′)AIMP3CCA AGU CUA ACA GGA UUG ACU ACU AAIMP2ACA CCA GAU GCA GAC UUG GAU GUA AAIMP1GGA GCU GAA UCC UAA GAA GAA GAU UKRSGCU GUU UGU CAU GAA GAA AGA GAU ARRSGGC UGU UUA GGA GCU UCU CCA AAU UQRSGCC AUC AAU UUC AAC UUU GGC UAU GMRSCUA CCG CUG GUU UAA CAU UUC GUU ULRSCCU UGC AUG GAU CAU GAU AGA CAA AIRSGGA AGC CAG AUU GUC AGC CCU CUA UEPRSCCA GCA CUA CCA GGU UAA CUU UAA A Open table in a new tab The Effect of Depletion of AIMPs—AIMP2 has been shown by in vivo analysis (26Kim J.Y. Kang Y.S. Lee J.W. Kim H.J. Ahn Y.H. Park H. Ko Y.G. Kim S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7912-7916Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) to be critical for the integrity of the whole complex and the stability of its components. It interacts with AIMP1 via a coiled-coil interaction (27Ahn H.C. Kim S. Lee B.J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 542: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We found that depletion of any one of the three AIMPs greatly affected the levels of the others (Fig. 1B, supplemental Fig. 2, and Fig. 2, A and B) and also had a global effect on the stability of the enzymatic components apart from KRS, although the degree of disruption differed for the three factors (Fig. 1B, supplemental Fig. 2, and Fig. 2A). These results show that the three AIMPs are critical for the assembly and stability of the whole complex. The Effect of Depletion of ARSs—EPRS, IRS, and LRS are larger than the other complex-forming enzymes and are thought to form one subdomain. These three enzymes were also shown to be mutually dependent for their stability (Fig. 1B, supplemental Fig. 2, and Fig. 2A). IRS was most sensitive to depletion of the other two enzymes. These results could be due to differences in intrinsic stability. However, assuming that these three enzymes have similar intrinsic stabilities, this suggests that IRS is a linker connecting EPRS and LRS (Fig. 2C). The three AIMPs were also severely affected by depletion of these large enzymes, suggesting that the latter are also linked directly or indirectly to the AIMPs. Of the rest of the component enzymes, MRS and RRS appeared to be least necessary for the stability of the remaining components, but they themselves depended on the presence of the other components. However, RRS was required to stabilize AIMP1, its specific interacting partner (28Rho S.B. Lee J.S. Jeong E.J. Kim K.S. Kim Y.G. Kim S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11267-11273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), suggesting a functional explanation for their association (Figs. 1B and 2A). In contrast KRS was not affected by depletion of any other component but was required for the stability of the other components (Fig. 1B, supplemental Fig. 2, and Fig. 2A). Based on these results, the components of the multi-ARS complex appear to be associated in a hierarchical manner with KRS occupying the controlling position and enzymes such as RRS and MRS at the most dependent level (Fig. 2D). WRS, which is not a component of the complex, was not affected by the presence or absence of the complex-forming ARSs (data not shown), suggesting that the complex-forming characteristics of the ARSs are related to their intrinsic instability. The Effect of Component Depletion on Complex Formation— To determine how knock-down of its components affects complex formation, we assessed complex formation by sizing chromatography. Components bound to the intact ARS complex elute in the void volume of the gel filtration column, whereas dissociated components appear in later fractions, depending on their molecular weights. Since the three AIMPs are thought to be important for the integrity of the complex, we investigated how suppression of each AIMP affected complex formation. To avoid protein degradation, the cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal. All the components of the complex from control siRNA-transfected cells co-eluted in the void volume (Fig. 3). However, transfection of siRNAs specific for each AIMP resulted in the dissociation of several components, especially MRS, QRS, KRS, and RRS (Fig. 3), further suggesting the importance of these factors for the assembly of the complex. The Effect of Component Depletion on Protein Synthesis—To determine how knock-down of the components affected protein synthesis, we compared levels of [35S]methionine incorporation in control and ARS siRNA-transfected cells. Although knock-down of each component suppressed protein synthesis to different degrees in the range of 30-80% of the control cells, it did not completely block protein synthesis, even though each component was suppressed to levels almost undetectable by Western blotting (except for QRS) (supplemental Fig. 3). This result indicates that protein synthesis is quite resistant to variation of ARS levels. Linkage Patterns and Functional Implications for ARS Assembly—The results of the component depletion experiments suggest that the components of the multi-tRNA synthetase complex are heterogeneous in their linkage patterns and intrinsic cellular stability. Although depletion of each component affected the levels of other components to different degree depending on the cell type and growth condition, the depletion effects were consistent in different experiments (data not shown) and reflect the physical intimacy of the components. Among the components, AIMP1 and AIMP3 in addition to AIMP2 (26Kim J.Y. Kang Y.S. Lee J.W. Kim H.J. Ahn Y.H. Park H. Ko Y.G. Kim S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7912-7916Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) were found to be critical for the stability of the whole complex. However, their stability also depended on the presence of other enzymes in the complex. KRS differed from all the other components as it did not require the other components for its stability but was instead essential for formation of the complex. In contrast, the enzymes like RRS and MRS appear to be strongly dependent on complex formation for their stability. The middle-sized components such as MRS, QRS, KRS, and RRS appeared to be easily released from the complex. Interestingly, the dissociated forms of these enzymes have also been detected in physiological conditions (4Ko Y.G. Kim E.Y. Kim T. Park H. Park H.S. Choi E.J. Kim S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6030-6036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 5Ko Y.G. Kang Y.S. Kim E.K. Park S.G. Kim S. J.

Thus each component seems to be linked to the complex in a unique manner (supplemental Fig. 4). Perhaps, this unique linkage of each component is necessary to respond specifically to its cognate signal for dissociation from the complex. The intrinsic instability of the complex-forming ARSs and AIMPs could be the point at which post-translational modification acts. Although the artificial knock-down experiments revealed the structural interdependence of the components, depletion of components from the complex may also occur in physiological conditions due to dissociation as a result of post-translational modification. For instance, the level of EPRS is severely affected by the absence of its interacting partner, IRS, and of the AIMPs (Figs. 1 and 2), implying that it is intrinsically unstable in isolation. However, EPRS is dissociated from the complex upon treatment with IFN-γ and forms a new complex called GAIT (IFN-γ-activated inhibitor of translation) with ribosomal subunit L13 and GAPDH (3Sampath P. Mazumder B. Seshadri V. Gerber C.A. Chavatte L. Kinter M. Ting S.M. Dignam J.D. Kim S. Driscoll D.M. Fox P.L. Cell. 2004; 119: 195-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). This shuttling of EPRS between the two complexes is controlled by IFN-γ-dependent phosphorylation of EPRS. Thus, the multifunctionality of the complex-forming ARSs may be regulated by their post-translational modification, which controls their molecular interactions, intrinsic turnover rate, or even cellular localization. The components of functional macromolecular complexes can be grouped into several categories with respect to how their interactions affect their turnover rates. They can be mutually and equally dependent on each other. Alternatively, complex formation may not affect the stability of the components and be required only for their cellular localization. Third, the components may take up distinct positions in the complex, such as scaffold, master or subordinate, thereby forming a hierarchical network. Our results reveal that the multi-tRNA synthetase complex belongs to the latter category. More specifically, most of the complex-forming ARSs and AIMPs are intrinsically unstable in isolation and are assembled to increase their stability. Second, the components are distinct in terms of their stability. Third, KRS is the least dependent on the other enzymatic components but the most important for the integrity of the complex. Although it is not clear why most of the complex-forming ARSs and their cofactors are unstable in isolation, their instability may provide a “failsafe system” to prevent abortive protein synthesis or undesired or uncontrolled signal transduction. When one or more of the components are dissociated or depleted from the complex, the resulting subcomplex may be inactive in protein synthesis, or the rest of the components may disintegrate and trigger undesirable signaling unless they are destroyed. Thus, it may be safer to degrade the other components than to maintain the abortive subcomplex. The linkage patterns in this multifunctional complex may provide insight into the structural organization of other multiprotein complexes that act in various signaling pathways and regulatory processes.

At the same time, the nuclear receptors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are known for their critical role in the development of both the metabolic syndrome and various cancers. Here we demonstrate, in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells and in normal mouse liver, that IGFBP-1 mRNA expression is under the primary control of PPAR ligands. We applied an improved in silico screening approach for PPAR response elements (PPREs) and identified five candidate PPREs located within 10 kb of the transcription start site (TSS) of the IGFBP-1 gene. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that, in living cells, the genomic region containing the most proximal PPRE, at position -1200 (relative to the TSS), preferentially associates with multiple PPAR subtypes and various other components of the transcriptional apparatus, which include their heterodimerizing partner, retinoid X receptor, as well as phosphorylated RNA polymerase II, co-repressor, co-activator, and mediator proteins. Moreover, further chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that the TSS regions of the IGFBP-1 gene and those of the related IGFBP-2, -5, and -6, but not of IGFBP-3 and -4 genes, bind PPARs as well.

Chem. 2000; 43: 527-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar). However, PPARs also regulate cellular growth and differentiation and therefore have as well an impact on hyperproliferative diseases, such as cancer (5Michalik L. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). PPARγ is the best characterized member of the subfamily due to its prominent role in the regulation of differentiation of cell types with active lipid metabolism, such as adipocytes and macrophage foam cells (6Walczak R. Tontonoz P. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 177-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37731-37734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). The importance of this receptor in lipid homeostasis and energy balance is accentuated by the widespread use of synthetic PPARγ ligands, such as the thiazolidinediones rosiglitazone, troglitazone, and pioglitazone, as anti-diabetic drugs (8Lee C.H. Olson P. Evans R.M. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 2201-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). In rodents a large number of significantly inducible PPAR target genes have been identified (9Yamazaki K. Kuromitsu J. Tanaka I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 1114-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 10Frederiksen K.S. Wulff E.M. Sauerberg P. Mogensen J.P. Jeppesen L. Fleckner J. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 592-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), whereas in human cell lines only a few genes are activated more than 2-fold by PPAR ligands (11Vanden Heuvel J.P. Kreder D. Belda B. Hannon D.B. Nugent C.A. Burns K.A. Taylor M.J. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2003; 188: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). An essential prerequisite for the direct modulation of transcription by PPAR ligands is the location of at least one activated PPAR protein close to the transcription start site (TSS) of the respective primary PPAR target gene. This is commonly achieved through the specific binding of PPARs to a PPAR response element (PPRE) (12Kersten S. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Nature. 2000; 405: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). In detail, the DNA-binding domain of PPARs contact the major groove of a double-stranded hexameric DNA sequence with the optimal AGGTCA core binding sequence. PPARs bind to DNA as heterodimers with the nuclear receptor retinoid X receptor (RXR) (13Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Noonan D.J. Heyman R.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1992; 358: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar). PPREs are therefore formed by two hexameric core binding motifs in a direct repeat orientation with an optimal spacing of one nucleotide (DR1), where PPAR occupies the 5′ motif (14Jpenberg A. Jeannin E. Wahli W. Desvergne B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20108-20117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In the absence of ligand, co-repressor proteins, such as nuclear co-repressor (NCoR), link DNA-bound nuclear receptors to enzymes with histone deacetylase activity that cause chromatin condensation (15Krogsdam A.M. Nielsen C.A. Neve S. Holst D. Helledie T. Thomsen B. Bendixen C. Mandrup S. Kristiansen K. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Binding of a ligand with agonistic properties to the nuclear receptors causes a conformational change within their ligand-binding domain that results in the replacement of co-repressors by co-activator proteins, such as receptor-associated co-activator 3 (16Molnar F. Matilainen M. Carlberg C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26543-26556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) or PPARγ co-activator 1α (PGC-1α) (17Vega R.B. Huss J.M. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 1868-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). These co-activators link ligand-activated nuclear receptors to enzymes displaying histone acetyltransferase activity that cause chromatin relaxation and thereby reverse the action of unliganded nuclear receptors. In a subsequent step, ligand-activated nuclear receptors exchange rapidly co-activator proteins for components of mediator complexes, such as thyroid hormone receptor-associated protein (TRAP)220/Med1 (18Yuan C.-X. Ito M. Fondell J.D. Fu Z.-Y. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7939-7944Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), which act as a bridge from the activated nuclear receptors to the basal transcriptional machinery. In this way ligand-activated nuclear receptors execute two tasks, the modification of chromatin and the regulation of transcription. IGFBPs are a family of proteins that are multifunctional, having insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-independent actions as well as regulation of IGFs activity (19Firth S.M. Baxter R.C. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 824-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar). The primary endocrine roles of IGFBP-1 appear to be the inhibition of the availability of IGFs as well as their hypoglycemic effect (20Lewitt M.S. Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. 1994; 23: 3-15Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 21Mortensen D.L. Won W.B. Siu J. Reifsnyder D. Gironella M. Etcheverry T. Clark R.G. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2073-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, hepatic IGFBP-1 may play a paracrine role as a survival factor independently of IGFs, reducing the level of pro-apoptotic signals in liver (22Leu J.I. Crissey M.A. Taub R. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Recently, it was found that in the absence of insulin IGFBP-1 protein levels were induced 1.6-fold after the application of PPARγ ligands (23Seto-Young D. Paliou M. Schlosser J. Avtanski D. Park A. Patel P. Holcomb K. Chang P. Poretsky L. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2005; 90: 6099-6105Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The importance of nuclear receptors in the regulation of this gene is further supported by the fact that we have shown it to be a primary target of 1α, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and its nuclear receptor, the vitamin D receptor (VDR) (24Matilainen M. Malinen M. Saavalainen K. Carlberg C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 5521-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In addition, an up-regulation of the IGFBP-1 gene by troglitazone could also be mediated by another nuclear receptor, the pregnane X receptor (25Hilding A. Hall K. Skogsberg J. Ehrenborg E. Lewitt M.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 303: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that the IGFBP-1 gene is a primary PPAR target in HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells as well as in normal mouse liver. We applied an improved in silico screening approach for DR1-type response elements (REs) and identified five candidate PPREs within 10 kb of the IGFBP-1 gene TSS. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays showed that in living cells only the genomic region containing the most proximal PPRE (at position -1200) associated with PPARs as well as with their nuclear partners RXR, phosphorylated RNA polymerase II (pPol II), NCoR, receptor-associated co-activator 3, PGC-1α, and TRAP220. A second PPRE (at position -9400) showed also an association with PPARs and RXR. ChIP assays demonstrated that the PPARs are located on TSS regions of the IGFBP-1 gene and those of the related genes IGFBP-2, -5, and -6 but not on those of the genes IGFBP-3 and -4. The genes IGFBP-2, -5, and -6 each contain a number of candidate PPREs and responded in HepG2 and HEK293 human embryonal kidney cells to PPAR ligands. This suggests that they are also primary PPAR target genes. Cell Culture and in Vivo Experiments—The human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cell line HepG2 and the human embryonal kidney cell line HEK293 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mm l-glutamine, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin in a humidified 95% air/5% CO2 incubator. Before use, FBS was stripped of lipophilic compounds, such as endogenous nuclear receptor ligands, by stirring it with 5% activated charcoal (Sigma-Aldrich) for 3 h at room temperature. Charcoal was then removed by centrifugation and sterile filtration. Prior to mRNA or chromatin extraction, cells were grown overnight in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped FBS to reach a density of 50-60% confluency. Cells were then treated with either solvent (Me2SO, 0.1% final concentration) or 100 nm of the PPARα agonist GW7647, 100 nm of the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone or 100 nm of the PPARβ/δ agonist GW501516. GW7647 and GW501516 were purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA), whereas rosiglitazone was kindly provided by Dr. Mogens Madsen (Leo Pharma, Ballerup, Denmark). The ligands were dissolved in Me2SO. 8-Week-old male BALB/c × DAB2 mice (National Laboratory Animal Center, Kuopio, Finland) were housed in stainless steel metabolic cages under controlled temperature (21-23 °C) and light conditions (lights on 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.). Mice had free access to water and diet ad libitum (Altromin, Lage, Germany) for 14 days prior to initiation of treatment. All experiments were approved by the Committee for the Welfare of Laboratory Animals at the University of Kuopio and conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the European Community Council directives 86/609/EEC. GW501516 was administered in saline by intraperitoneal injection (1 μg/g body weight). After 3 and 6 h the animals were sacrificed, and their livers were removed and shock frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA Extraction and Real-time Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was extracted using the Mini RNA Isolation II kit (Zymo Research, HiSS Diagnostics, Freiburg, Germany). For tissues, the samples were pre-homogenized in lysing matrix A tubes (Bio 101, Vista, CA) using a Fast Prep FP120 machine (Savant Instruments, Holbrook, NY). Samples were processed twice for 40 s at setting 6.0 with a 10-min cooling interval on ice. Afterward, the samples were cooled on ice for 10 min, spun down for 1 min at 2000 rpm in a bench-top centrifuge, and 600 μl of the cleared supernatant was transferred to the Mini RNA isolation kit columns for RNA extraction. The RNA was subsequently purified and eluted according to the manufacturer's instructions (Zymo Research). From all RNA sources, cDNA synthesis was performed for 1 h at 37°C using 1 μg of total RNA as a template, 100 pmol of oligo(dT18) primer, and 40 units of reverse transcriptase (Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania) in a 40-μl volume. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed in an IQ-cycler (Bio-Rad) using the dye Sybr Green I (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands). Per reaction, 4 μl of the 1:10 dilution of the above cDNA, 1 unit of Hot Start Taq polymerase (Fermentas), and 3 mm MgCl2 were used, and the PCR cycling conditions were: 45 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 62 °C, and 40 s at 72 °C. The sequences of the gene-specific primer pairs for the human and mouse IGFBP genes, the reference gene carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT 1), and the internal control gene acidic riboprotein P0 (ARP0, Arbp in mouse) are listed in supplemental Tables S1 and S2. PCR product quality was monitored using post-PCR melt curve analysis. The -fold inductions (Figs. 1 and 6, C-E) were calculated using 2-(ΔΔCt), where ΔΔCt is the ΔCt(PPAR ligand)-ΔCtMe2SO), ΔCt is Ct(IGFBPn or CPT 1) - Ct(ARP0), and Ct is the cycle at which the threshold is crossed. Relative mRNA expression levels (Fig. 6, A and B) were calculated using 2-(ΔCt).FIGURE 6Expression profiling of the IGFBP gene family. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to determine the basal mRNA expression of the three PPAR genes and the six IGFBP genes, relative to the control gene ARP0, in HepG2 and HEK293 cells (A) and in mouse liver (B). A logarithmic scale is employed on the y-axis to better present the data. In the same two cell lines and in the mouse liver the inducibility of the genes IGFBP-2 to -6 was tested. The established PPAR target gene CPT 1 served as a positive control. HepG2 and HEK293 cells were stimulated for 2, 4, and 6 h with 100 nm GW7647 (α), 100 nm rosiglitazone (γ), or 100 nm GW501516 (β/δ). Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1 mg/kg (of body weight) GW501516 and livers were taken after 3- and 6-h exposures. Data points (A and B) and columns (C-E) represent the means of at least three independent treatments, and the bars represent standard deviations (in A and B they were too small to be displayed). Dashed lines indicate the threshold of 2-fold up- or down-regulation. Two-tailed Student's t tests were performed to determine the significance of the mRNA induction by PPAR agonists in reference to solvent controls (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; and ***, p < 0.001).

Nature. 1990; 345: 224-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar) were subcloned into the T7/SV40 promoter-driven pSG5 expression vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The same constructs were used for both T7 RNA polymerase-driven in vitro transcription/translation of the respective cDNAs and for viral promoter-driven overexpression in mammalian cells. Promoter regions of the IGFBP-1 gene (-9536 to -9253 and -1468 to -1002) and of the CPT 1 gene (-306 to -64) were cloned by PCR from human genomic DNA and were fused with the thymidine kinase promoter driving the firefly luciferase reporter gene. Point mutations to the PPREs within the promoter constructs were generated using the QuikChange sitedirected mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In REs 1 and 2 of the IGFBP-1 gene each sixth position was changed from A to G, whereas in the CPT 1 gene the seventh position of the PPRE was mutated from A to T. All constructs were verified by sequencing. Gel-shift Assays—In vitro translated PPAR subtype and RXRα proteins were generated by coupled in vitro transcription/translation using their respective pSG5-based full-length cDNA expression constructs and rabbit reticulocyte lysate as recommended by the supplier (Promega, Madison, WI). Protein batches were quantified by test-translations in the presence of [35S]methionine. Gel-shift assays were performed with 10 ng of the appropriate in vitro translated proteins. The proteins were incubated for 15 min in a total volume of 20 μl of binding buffer (150 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25 ng/ml herring sperm DNA, 5% glycerol, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9). Constant amounts (1 ng) of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides (50,000 cpm) containing one copy of the respective REs (Table 1 and supplemental Table S3) were then added, and incubation was continued for 20 min at room temperature. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis through 8% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels (mono- to bisacrylamide ratio 19:1) in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) for 90 min at 200 V and quantified on a FLA-3000 reader (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan) using ScienceLab99 software (Fuji).TABLE 1Candidate PPREs of the human IGFBP-1 geneResponse elementLocationaRelative to the TSS.SequenceClass variationPPARαPPARγPPARβ/δRE1−9446CAAGTTCAAAGTTTA1 × I, 2 × II2 × I, 1 × II2 × I, 1 × IIRE2−1178CCAGGTCAAAGTCAC2 × I, 2 × II4 × I1 × I, 3 × IIRE3+3601CAGGGTGAAAGGGAC1 × I, 2 × II3 × I3 × IIRE4+7059CAGGTCCAAAGGGCA3 × II2 × I, 1 × II1 × I, 2 × IIRE5+8574TTAGGGGAAAGGGAA1 × I, 2 × II3 × I1 × I, 2 × IIa Relative to the TSS. Open table in a new tab ChIP Assays—Nuclear proteins were cross-linked to genomic DNA by adding formaldehyde for 10 min directly to the medium to a final concentration of 1% at room temperature. Cross-linking was stopped by adding glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m and incubating for 5 min at room temperature on a rocking platform. The medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4·2H2O). The cells were collected by scraping into ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). After centrifugation the cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), and the lysates were sonicated to result in DNA fragments of 300-1000 bp in length. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation, and the lysates were diluted 1:10 in ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm NaCl, protease inhibitors, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1). The samples were centrifuged, and the recovered chromatin solutions were incubated with 5 μl of indicated antibodies and 20 μl of sonicated salmon sperm (0.1 mg/ml) to remove unspecific background overnight at 4 °C with rotation. The antibodies against PPARα (sc-9000), PPARγ (sc-7196), PPARβ/δ (sc-7197), RXRα (sc-553), NCoR (sc-8994), RAC-3 (sc-7216), PGC-1α (sc-13067), TRAP220 (sc-5334), phosphorylated RNA polymerase II (pPol II, sc-13583), and control IgGs (sc-2027) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Heidelberg, Germany). The immunocomplexes were collected with 60 μl of protein A-agarose slurry (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) for 1 h at 4°C with rotation. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation for 1 min at 4 °C at 100 × g and washed sequentially for 5 min by rotation with 1 ml of the following buffers: low salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), high salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), and LiCl wash buffer (0.25 mm LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1). Finally, the beads were washed twice with 1 ml of TE buffer (1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The immunocomplexes were then eluted by adding 250 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS, 100 mm NaHCO3) and incubated for 15 min at room temperature with rotation. After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected, and the elution was repeated. The supernatants were combined, and the cross-linking was reversed by adding NaCl to a final concentration of 200 mm and incubated overnight at 65 °C. The remaining proteins were digested by adding proteinase K (final concentration, 40 μg/ml) and incubation for 1 h at 45°C. Genomic DNA fragments were recovered by phenol-chloroform extraction, followed by a salt-ethanol precipitation and subsequent resuspension in sterile H2O. PCR of Chromatin Templates—For each of the five candidate RE-containing genomic regions and the control region of the IGFBP-1 gene as well as for the TSS of all six IGFBP genes, specific primer pairs were designed (Table 2), optimized, and controlled by running PCR reactions with 25 ng of genomic DNA (input) as a template. When running immunoprecipitated DNA (output) as a template, the following PCR profile was used: preincubation for 5 min at 95 °C, 50 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C and one final incubation for 10 min at 72 °C. The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis through 2% agarose gels. Gel images were scanned on a FLA3000 reader using ScienceLab99 software.TABLE 2Genomic PCR primersRegion (gene)LocationaRelative to the TSS.Primer sequences (5′-3′)1 (IGFBP-1)−9536 to −9253GAGCTGATGCTATTAGAAGCAGGAAGATGAGGGAAAGTTGAGAAC2 (IGFBP-1)−1197 to −1002GATCCACCGTTATAGCCTCTGCACCATCTTTGCCTCCCATTC3 (IGFBP-1)+3498 to +3691CACAGGAGACATCAGGAGAAGGTGGATCTGGCTCAATACAAC4 (IGFBP-1)+6997 to +7370CTCTTCTAGTATGCTGAGGCTCCAGGGAACATGTGTGGGAATTG5 (IGFBP-1)+8341 to +8690CTACTCATTGACTGAAGTGCTCAGATGGTGTTTGTTTACATGControl (IGFBP-1)−8869 to −8377CAATTAGGAACTGCCCTCATGGACGTTATCATGTTTGCAGATTCTSS (IGFBP-1)−100 to +153GAACACTCAGCTCCTAGCGTGCTGACATCTCCAGGCGCGAGTSS (IGFBP-2)−62 to +117GAAGGGAGTGGTCTCCAAAAGCACTCTCGGCAGCATGCTGTSS (IGFBP-3)−129 to +92GAGCAGCACCAGCAGAGTCCAGGGATGGGGCGACAGTACTSS (IGFBP-4)−41 to +118CACCTCTGGGAAGGCGCTGGTTAGCAGGCGTGCCGGAGTSS (IGFBP-5)−32 to +92GTTCTACGCGAAGTCCGGAGCTCCTTGGCATCCTTGCCTGTSS (IGFBP-6)−159 to +18CTGGAAAGGGAGAGGGAAAGCAGAGCAGTCGCAGCGCAGa Relative to the TSS. Open table in a new tab Transfection and Luciferase Reporter Gene Assays—HepG2 cells were seeded into 6-well plates (105 cells/ml) and grown overnight in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped FBS. Polyethyleneimine transfections were performed by incubating a reporter plasmid and the expression vector for human PPARα, PPARγ, or PPARβ/δ (each 1 μg) with 50 μl of 150 mm NaCl for 15 min at room temperature. Simultaneously, 10 μg of polyethyleneimine (Sigma-Aldrich) in 50 μl of 150 mm NaCl was incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The two solutions were then combined and incubated for additional 15 min at room temperature. After dilution with 900 μl of phenol red-free DMEM, the mixture was added to the cells. 500 μl of phenol red-free DMEM, supplemented with 15% charcoal-stripped FBS, and the ligands were added 4 h after transfection. The cells were lysed 16 h later using reporter gene lysis buffer (Roche Diagnostics). The constant light signal luciferase reporter gene assay was performed as recommended by the supplier (Canberra-Packard, Groningen, The Netherlands). Luciferase activities were normalized with respect to protein concentration, and induction factors were calculated as the ratio of luciferase activity of ligand-stimulated cells to that of solvent controls. IGFBP-1 Is a Primary PPAR Target Gene—RNA was extracted from HepG2 cells treated for 2, 4, and 6 h with 100 nm each of either the PPARα agonist GW7647, or the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone or the PPARβ/δ agonist GW501516. These early time points were chosen to detect primary effects of the PPAR ligands. The relative -fold induction of the mRNA amounts of the IGFBP-1 gene and of the known PPAR target gene CPT 1 were determined by real-time quantitative PCR (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, all three PPAR subtype-specific ligands were found to stimulate significantly IGFBP-1 mRNA expression. After 4 h the maximal mRNA induction factors were 2.1- to 2.9-fold. For the reference gene CPT 1 comparable stimulations of 1.6- to 2.8-fold were measured, but these maxima were reached 2 h later than with the IGFBP-1 gene. With the chosen ligand concentrations the pregnane X receptor was not activated (data not shown), and therefore we can exclude pregnane X receptor-dependent effects of rosiglitazone (25Hilding A. Hall K. Skogsberg J. Ehrenborg E. Lewitt M.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 303: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The most responsive PPAR ligand, GW501516, was chosen for an in vivo experiment, in which 1 mg/kg body weight of the compound was injected intraperitoneally into mice (Fig. 1B). Livers were taken 3 and 6 h after ligand application"
https://openalex.org/W1982996550,"Infection with Shiga toxin (Stx)-producing Escherichia coli O157:H7 causes bloody diarrhea and hemorrhagic colitis in humans, sometimes resulting in fatal systemic complications. Among the known Stx family members, Stx2 is responsible for the most severe forms of disease. Stx2 binds to target cells via multivalent interactions between its B-subunit pentamer and globotriaosyl ceramide. After binding, it is first retrogradely transported to the Golgi and then to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Using a multivalent peptide library approach, we identified a tetravalent peptide that exhibits a high affinity for the Stx2 B-subunit pentamer (KD = 0.13 microM) and markedly inhibits Stx2 cytotoxicity. The tetravalent peptide exerted its inhibitory effects by inducing aberrant cellular transport of Stx2. Although the tetravalent peptide/Stx2 complex was incorporated into cells and translocated to the Golgi, this process was followed by the effective degradation of Stx2 in an acidic compartment rather than by its transfer to the ER. This peptide thoroughly protected mice from a fatal dose of E. coli O157:H7 even when administered after an established infection. Thus, the multivalent peptide library approach enabled the identification of a peptide-based Stx2 inhibitor that has remarkable therapeutic potency and appears to function by inducing aberrant cellular transport and degradation of Stx2."
https://openalex.org/W1986993231,"Carnitine transporters have recently been implicated in susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Because carnitine is required for beta-oxidation, it was suggested that decreased carnitine transporters, and hence reduced carnitine uptake, could lead to impaired fatty acid oxidation in intestinal epithelial cells, and to cell injury. We investigated this issue by examining the expression of the carnitine transporters OCTN2 and ATB0+, and butyrate metabolism in colonocytes in a rat model of IBD induced by trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). We found that Octn2 and Atb0+ expression was decreased in inflammatory samples at translational and functional level. Butyrate oxidation, evaluated based on CO2 production and acetyl-coenzyme A synthesis, was deranged in colonocytes from TNBS-treated rats. Treatment with carnitine-loaded liposomes corrected the butyrate metabolic alterations in vitro and reduced the severity of colitis in vivo. These results suggest that carnitine depletion in colonocytes is associated with the inability of mitochondria to maintain normal butyrate beta-oxidation. Our data indicate that carnitine is a rate-limiting factor for the maintenance of physiological butyrate oxidation in colonic cells. This hypothesis could also explain the contradictory therapeutic efficacy of butyrate supplementation observed in clinical trials of IBD."

In this study we investigate Grx2 function by examining its potential peroxidase activity using lens epithelial cells (LEC). cDNA for human and mouse Grx2 was cloned into pET21d(+) vector and used to produce respective recombinant Grx2 for kinetic studies. cDNA for human Grx2 was transfected into human LEC and used for in vivo studies. Both human and mouse Grx2 showed glutathione (GSH)-dependent and thioredoxin reductase (TR)-dependent peroxidase activity. The catalytic efficiency of human and mouse Grx2 was lower than that of glutathione peroxidases (2.5 and 0.8x10(4) s(-1) M(-1), respectively), but comparable with TR-dependent peroxiredoxins (16.5 and 2.7x10(4) s(-1) M(-1), respectively). TR-dependent peroxidase activity increased 2-fold in the transfected cells and was completely abolished by addition of anti-Grx2 antibody (Ab). Flow cytometry (FACS) analysis and confocal microscopy revealed that cells preloaded with pure Grx2 detoxified peroxides more efficiently. Grx2 over-expression protected cells against H2O2-mediated disruption of mitochondrial transmembrane potential. These results suggest that Grx2 has a novel function as a peroxidase, accepting electrons both from GSH and TR. This unique property may play a role in protecting the mitochondria from oxidative damage."
https://openalex.org/W2136962441,"Bax is a proapoptotic protein implicated in cell death involved in several neurodegenerative diseases. Intracellularly expressed antibody (Ab) fragments (intrabodies) inhibiting Bax function would have potential for developing therapeutics for the aforementioned diseases and can serve as research tools. We report identification, cloning, and functional characterization of several Bax-specific single-domain antibodies (sdAbs). These minimal size Ab fragments, which were isolated from a llama V(H)H phage display library by panning, inhibited Bax function in in vitro assays. Importantly, as intrabodies, these sdAbs, which were stably expressed in mammalian cells, were nontoxic to their host cells and rendered them highly resistant to oxidative-stress-induced apoptosis. The intrabodies prevented mitochondrial membrane potential collapse and apoptosis after oxidative stress in the host cells. These anti-Bax V(H)Hs could be used as tools for studying the role of Bax in oxidative-stress-induced apoptosis and for developing novel therapeutics for the degenerative diseases involving oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2039786591,"Shigella invasion into the colonic epithelium involves many steps including the formation of large membrane protrusions by the epithelial cells that facilitate bacterial engulfment. IpaA, a Shigella protein secreted into target cells upon cell contact induces a loss of actin stress fibers in cells and promotes the reorganization of actin at the site of entry. The mechanism for this is not known but is thought to involve recruitment of the focal adhesion protein vinculin to IpaA. Here we have examined the mechanism for the effects of IpaA on the actin cytoskeleton. We show that IpaA-induced loss of actin stress fibers and cell rounding do not require vinculin expression or an intact vinculin binding site on IpaA. Rather, we find that cells expressing IpaA exhibited elevated Rho activity and increased myosin light chain phosphorylation. In addition, IpaA decreases integrin affinity for extracellular matrix ligands by interfering with talin recruitment to the integrin cytoplasmic tail. The combination of these two effects, namely weakened adhesion and increased contractility, account for the loss of actin stress fibers and cell rounding observed in cells exposed to IpaA.

The combination of these two effects, namely weakened adhesion and increased contractility, account for the loss of actin stress fibers and cell rounding observed in cells exposed to IpaA. Shigella, the causative agent of bacillary dysentery, is a Gramnegative bacterium that exerts its effects by invading the colonic mucosa. Upon entry into the epithelium of the colon, Shigella multiply, cause cell death, and spread laterally to infect and kill adjacent epithelial cells, inducing ulceration, inflammation, and bleeding. To facilitate entry, Shigella triggers de novo actin polymerization that drives the formation of large membrane protrusions that arise from the epithelium and evolve into a phagocytic-like cup that merges above the bacterium. These protrusions are rich in densely branched actin networks that are reorganized to allow for closure of the phagocytic cup and internalization of the bacterium. Elucidation of the molecular bases of these cytoskeletal rearrangements is essential for better understanding the mechanism of Shigella entry. To facilitate invasion, the Shigella type III secretion system is stimulated upon contact with host cells and delivers bacterial “effector” molecules into the surrounding bacterial space and/or host cell membrane (1Blocker A. Komoriya K. Aizawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3027-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). These invasins directly alter the host cell cytoskeleton and/or allow for the delivery of other type III effectors into the cytoplasm to promote invasion. For Shigella, these invasins include IpaA, IpaB, IpaC, IpaD, IpgD, IpgB, and VirA (2Ohya K. Handa Y. Ogawa M. Suzuki M. Sasakawa C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24022-24034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and are reviewed in Refs. 3Cossart P. Sansonetti P.J.

Microbiol. 1995; 16: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Shigella mutants unable to express IpaB, IpaC, or IpaD are not able to invade epithelial cells and IpaA mutants are impaired 10-fold (6Menard R. Sansonetti P.J. Parsot C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5899-5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 7Sasakawa C. Kamata K. Sakai T. Makino S. Yamada M. Okada N. Yoshikawa M. J.

Exploring the molecular basis for how Ipa proteins alter the host cell cytoskeleton revealed that IpaB, IpaC, and IpaD elicit actin rearrangements at the site of bacterial attachment that are required for entry, whereas IpaA may promote the reorganization of these actin-rich structures (8Tran Van Nhieu G. Ben-Ze'ev A. Sansonetti P.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2717-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). One target of the Ipa proteins are members of the Rho family of GTPases (9Adam T. Giry M. Boquet P. Sansonetti P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3315-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 10Watarai M. Kamata Y. Kozaki S. Sasakawa C. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Rho proteins act as molecular switches cycling between an active GTP-bound form and inactive GDP-bound state. Active Cdc42 and Rac trigger activation of the Arp2/3 complex and the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia, respectively (reviewed in Ref. 11DeMali K.A. Burridge K. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2389-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). IpaC induces changes in the actin cytoskeleton, characteristic of active Cdc42 and Rac, and this effect is blocked by dominant negative versions of Cdc42 or Rac, or the Cdc42-binding domain of WASP suggesting that IpaC may up-regulate the activity of these GTPases (12Tran Van Nhieu G. Caron E. Hall A. Sansonetti P.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3249-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The mechanism for this is likely to involve phosphorylation of Crk by Abl tyrosine kinases and the subsequent activation of PAK (13Burton E.A. Plattner R. Pendergast A.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5471-5479Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 14Abassi Y.A. Vuori K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4571-4582Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Like Cdc42 and Rac, Rho activity is required for Shigella entry (9Adam T. Giry M. Boquet P. Sansonetti P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3315-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 15Mounier J. Vasselon T. Hellio R. Lesourd M. Sansonetti P.J. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 237-248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Increases in Rho activity stimulate numerous Rho effectors that could potentially remodel the actin cytoskeleton and drive increased contractility. For example, the RhoA effector Rho kinase increases phosphorylation of the myosin II regulatory light chain both directly and indirectly by inhibition of the myosin phosphatase (16Amano M. Ito M. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Chihara K. Nakano T. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20246-20249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar, 17Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M.

The mechanism of Rho activation at the site of Shigella entry is unknown, but its activity is essential for the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and folding of membranes that occurs at the site of entry (9Adam T. Giry M. Boquet P. Sansonetti P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3315-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Another group of proteins that are localized to the site of bacterial entry and targeted by the Shigella effectors are adhesion receptors. IpaB binds to the extracellular domain of CD44, a transmembrane receptor that interacts with hyaluronic acid, and promotes Shigella entry (18Lafont F. Tran Van Nhieu G. Hanada K. Sansonetti P. van der Goot F.G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4449-4457Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 19Skoudy A. Mounier J. Aruffo A. Ohayon H. Gounon P. Sansonetti P. Tran Van Nhieu G. Cell Microbiol. 2000; 2: 19-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Integrins are transmembrane adhesion receptors consisting of α and β subunits that serve as links between the extracellular matrix on the outside and the cytoskeleton on the inside. They are highly enriched at sites of bacterial entry and their expression level positively correlates with Shigella invasiveness (20Watarai M. Funato S. Sasakawa C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 991-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). A complex of IpaB and IpaC bind to integrins (20Watarai M. Funato S. Sasakawa C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 991-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and may allow for transient adhesion of the bacterium with the cell surface to promote internalization (20Watarai M. Funato S. Sasakawa C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 991-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). IpaA binds to vinculin, a protein present at the cytoplasmic face of integrins (8Tran Van Nhieu G. Ben-Ze'ev A. Sansonetti P.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2717-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The interaction of IpaA with vinculin increases recruitment of F-actin to vinculin (21Bourdet-Sicard R. Rudiger M. Jockusch B.M. Gounon P. Sansonetti P.J. Nhieu G.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5853-5862Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 22Chen H. Cohen D.M. Choudhury D.M. Kioka N. Craig S.W. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 459-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). A complex of vinculin and IpaA was shown to reduce F-actin sedimentation and decrease filament assembly on an EM grid leading the authors to suggest that this complex is important for “depolymerization” of actin filaments at the site of Shigella entry (21Bourdet-Sicard R. Rudiger M. Jockusch B.M. Gounon P. Sansonetti P.J. Nhieu G.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5853-5862Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Here we explore how IpaA promotes the cytoskeletal rearrangements necessary for bacterial entry. We provide evidence that there is a loss of stress fibers in vinculin-null mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) 2The abbreviations used are: MEF, mouse embryo fibroblasts; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RBD, RhoA-binding domain; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter. expressing IpaA or in fibroblasts expressing a mutant of IpaA unable to bind vinculin. We find that cells expressing IpaA have elevated Rho activity and increased phosphorylation of myosin light chain resulting in increases in contractility that can be blocked by inhibitors of Rho kinase. Furthermore, we show that IpaA negatively regulates cell-matrix adhesion by interfering with recruitment of talin to the integrin cytoplasmic tail. The combination of IpaA-induced de-adhesion and increased contractility account for the loss of actin stress fibers and cell rounding observed in cells exposed to IpaA. Reagents and Cell Lines—The vinculin-null mouse embryo fibroblasts (Vin-/-; Ref. 23Xu W. Coll J.L. Adamson E.D. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1535-1544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were a generous gift of E. Adamson (Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA). Vin-/-, HeLa, and REF52s were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal bovine serum as previously described (24DeMali K.A. Barlow C.A. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 881-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Human fibronectin was prepared as previously described (25Ruoslahti E. Hayman E.G. Pierschbacher M. Engvall E. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 803-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). For the Rho kinase inhibitor studies, Y27632 (Calbiochem) was resuspended in Me2SO, diluted to a final concentration of 750 nm in growth media for 30 min prior to and during microinjection. Constructs—The GFP, Myc, and GST fusion proteins were constructed by PCR amplification of a cDNA of interest from pEC15 (26Venkatesan M.M. Buysse J.M. Kopecko D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9317-9321Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Full-length IpaA was cloned using GGATCCATGCATAATGTAATAATACTCAAGCGCCAACATTC as the upstream primer and GAATTCTTAATCCTTATTGATATTCTTTAATACTTTTGATAGGG as the downstream primer. IpaA-(1-500) was constructed using the full-length upstream primer and GAATTCGGAGTTTGTTACTTTTTTTGAAGC as the reverse primer and IpaA-(500-633) was constructed using GGATCCGGAACACAAGAACGAGAGTTACAGG as the forward primer and the full-length IpaA downstream primer. The resulting PCR products were cloned into the BglII-EcoRI sites of pEGFP-C1, or the BamHI-EcoRI sites of pGEX-T (Amersham Biosciences) or pCMV6, an amino-terminal Myc epitope-tagged eukaryotic expression vector (gift of Dr. Jonathan Chernoff, Fox Chase Cancer Center). Rho Activity—Rho activity assays were performed as previously described (27Arthur W.T. Petch L.A. Burridge K. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 719-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) using the RhoA-binding domain of Rhotekin expressed as a GST fusion protein. The cDNA of the RhoA-binding domain (RBD) of Rhotekin comprising amino acids 7-89 was cloned into the pGEX-2T vector and expressed as a GST fusion protein. REF52 cells expressing GFP, GFP-IpaA, GFP-IpaA-(1-500), or GFP-IpaA-(500-633) were washed twice in HEPES-buffered saline and lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, and 10 mm MgCl2. Thirty micrograms of GST-RBD attached to glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with clarified lysates for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times in lysis buffer and the resulting products were analyzed using SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were washed in HBS (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl + 2mm Na3VO4, and lysed in ice-cold EB (1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mm Na3VO4). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as previously described (24DeMali K.A. Barlow C.A. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 881-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) using the following commercially available anti-sera: GFP (Roche and Clontech), Rho (BD Transduction Labs), phospho-Ser19 myosin light chain (BIOSOURCE), and myosin light chain (My-21; Sigma). Vinculin (G989) or talin (N681) were immunoblotted and immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibodies raised against the full-length proteins as previously described (24DeMali K.A. Barlow C.A. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 881-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 28Rochlin M.W. Chen Q.M. Tobler M. Turner C.E. Burridge K. Peng H.B. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 92: 461-472PubMed Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence—Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100, and washed in TBS (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.1% NaN3). To visualize actin, cells were incubated with Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes) at 1:200 for 1 h at 37 °C, washed in universal buffer, and mounted on glass slides. Images were obtained as previously described using a Zeiss axiovert microscope. Images were acquired with a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER cooled charge-coupled device camera (Zeiss) and processed using Metamorph Image software (Universal Imaging). Vinculin was visualized using hVIN-1 (Sigma) at 1:400 followed by an anti-mouse Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody. Microinjection—Cells were seeded onto glass bottom dishes (MATEK) 24 h prior to microinjection in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal bovine serum. The dishes of cells were moved to a 37 °C incubation chamber for imaging. GST-IpaA was harvested from BL21(DE3) cells expressing a chaperone plasmid (Takara Mirus Bio) to facilitate recovery of soluble plasmid cultures induced with 0.33 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside overnight at room temperature. Bacterial cells were lysed, sonicated, and GST-IpaA was purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads. The purified products were concentrated using a microconcentrator and dialyzed into microinjection buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.3, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1mm EGTA), and injected at a concentration of 20 μg/ml. The cells were monitored for 30 min using Zeiss axiovert inverted microscope equipped with a heat and humidified chamber and a Hamamatsu ORCA ER camera. Images were acquired as described above. In Vitro Binding to Integrin Cytoplasmic Domain Constructs—The synthetic β1A integrin cytoplasmic binding was obtained from Mark Ginsberg and purified as previously described (29Pfaff M. Liu S. Erle D.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6104-6109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Platelet extracts were prepared as previously described (30Turner C.E. Burridge K. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 49: 202-206PubMed Google Scholar). The platelet extracts were passed over a DEAE-52 column and the five column fractions most enriched for talin were pooled. The pH of these samples was adjusted to 7.5 and the salt concentration was adjusted to 50 mm. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads containing 50 μg of purified β1a integrin cytoplasmic domain were incubated with 300 μl of talin-enriched platelet extracts in the presence of 0.2 or 2 μg of GST or GST-IpaA. The resulting beads were washed four times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline + 0.5% Triton X-100, reconstituted in sample buffer, and subjected to Western blot analysis. FACS Analysis—Subconfluent cultures of HeLa cells expressing Myc or Myc-IpaA were lifted from tissue culture dishes by incubation in phosphate-buffered saline + 0.6 mm EDTA for 15 min at 37 °C, washed, and stained with TS2/16 (American Type Tissue Culture Collection) or 12G10 (Chemicon) for 1 h at 4 °C. The cells were washed two times, stained with an anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated with fluorescein (Chemicon) for 30 min at 4 °C, and washed three additional times. The stained cells were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 0.2% fetal bovine serum, and analyzed in the University of North Carolina flow cytometry facility. For each wash step the cells were resuspended and pelleted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 0.2% fetal bovine serum. Upon contact with a host cell, Shigella triggers the formation of large membrane protrusions that arise from the host cell surface and engulf the bacterium. To form a structure that is productive for entry these densely packed actin-rich membrane protrusions reorganize. Both Rho and a complex of IpaA and vinculin have been implicated in the actin cytoskeletal rearrangements that occur during Shigella entry (9Adam T. Giry M. Boquet P. Sansonetti P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3315-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 21Bourdet-Sicard R. Rudiger M. Jockusch B.M. Gounon P. Sansonetti P.J. Nhieu G.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5853-5862Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms remain elusive. To investigate how IpaA affects the actin cytoskeleton, we cloned IpaA and studied the effects of recombinant IpaA expressed as a fusion with GFP in mammalian cells. We assessed whether our recombinant IpaA exhibited the same characteristics as IpaA purified from bacterial supernatants (21Bourdet-Sicard R. Rudiger M. Jockusch B.M. Gounon P. Sansonetti P.J. Nhieu G.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5853-5862Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). For this, we examined coprecipitation of vinculin with GFP or GFP-IpaA immunoprecipitated from HeLa cell lysates. Consistently we immunoprecipitated much more GFP than GFP-IpaA from cell lysates but always detected vinculin binding only to GFP-IpaA and not to GFP alone (Fig. 1A). Previous findings suggested that IpaA purified from bacterial supernatants induced a loss of stress fibers when microinjected into cells (21Bourdet-Sicard R. Rudiger M. Jockusch B.M. Gounon P. Sansonetti P.J. Nhieu G.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5853-5862Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We examined whether our GFP-IpaA was able to have a similar effect when transiently expressed. For these studies we utilized the REF52 cell line, which unlike HeLa cells, form robust actin stress fibers that are easily visualized. Under these conditions, 90 ± 5% of GFP-expressing cells formed large actin stress fibers that were easily visualized and indistinguishable from the untransfected cells (Fig. 1B). In contrast, 31 ± 7% of the cells expressing GFP-IpaA had no detectable stress fibers and 20 ± 9% of the cells showed a partial decrease in the number of actin stress fibers (Fig. 1C). It was a bit surprising that such a large number of cells (i.e. 49 ± 2%) would have relatively intact stress fibers. Sites where stress fibers terminate are known as focal adhesions. We considered whether disassembling the preexisting focal adhesions might allow IpaA to access these sites better and have a greater effect. To test this possibility, focal adhesions were disassembled by resuspending cells by trypsinization followed by replating on fibronectin-coated coverslips for 4 h. Under these conditions, the percentage of IpaA-expressing cells lacking stress fibers significantly increased to 93 ± 7%, whereas replating had relatively no effect on the stress fibers in GFP-expressing cells (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these results suggest that expression of recombinant IpaA induces a loss of actin stress fibers to a similar extent as microinjection of IpaA purified from bacterial supernatants. Vinculin Is Not Required for the Effects of IpaA on the Actin Cytoskeleton—Earlier work implicated vinculin recruitment to IpaA as key for the loss of stress fibers and cell rounding observed in cells exposed to IpaA (21Bourdet-Sicard R. Rudiger M. Jockusch B.M. Gounon P. Sansonetti P.J. Nhieu G.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5853-5862Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To test the requirement for vinculin, we assessed the morphology and the integrity of actin stress fibers in vinculin-null (Vin-/-) MEFs expressing GFP-IpaA or GFP alone (31Xu W. Baribault H. Adamson E.D. Development. 1998; 125: 327-337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the vinculin-null cells expressing GFP-IpaA showed a marked decrease in the number of stress fibers and were more rounded as compared with the GFP-expressing or untransfected control Vin-/- MEFs (Fig. 2A) suggesting that vinculin is not required for the effect on stress fibers by IpaA. IpaA had a slightly greater effect on stress fibers in the Vin-/- MEFs than in the REF52s, because 58 ± 13% of cells had no detectable actin stress fibers (Fig. 2B). These findings were not the result of prolonged exposure to IpaA because Vin-/- MEFs microinjected with GST-IpaA rounded very rapidly and did not appear to recover during the first 15 min of exposure (supplemental data). In contrast GST-injected cells were indistinguishable from the uninjected controls (supplemental data). It is possible that in the absence of vinculin, the MEFs up-regulate a compensatory pathway that allows IpaA to induce a loss of stress fibers. To further explore whether vinculin is required for the effect of IpaA, we considered generating a mutant of IpaA that could not bind vinculin. This would allow us to examine the phenotype of the mutant IpaA when expressed in the presence of vinculin in REF52 cells. We mapped the vinculin binding site on IpaA using IpaA fragments expressed as fusions with GFP (Fig. 3A). Several overlapping fragments co-precipitated vinculin from cell lysates and identified the C-terminal 134 amino acids (residues 500-633) as the critical domain (Fig. 3B). We next assessed the ability of GFP fusions with either one of these two IpaA fragments to induce a loss of stress fibers and cell rounding in REF52 cells (Fig. 3C) or Vin-/- MEFs (Fig. 2). In both cell lines, the fragment of IpaA that bound vinculin (IpaA-(500-633)) behaved similarly to GFP. Neither cell line exhibited a significant decrease in actin stress fibers (Figs. 2 and 3C). In some instances the number and intensity of stress fibers in the GFP-IpaA-(500-633) expressing cells appeared to be increased (Figs. 2A and 3C). In contrast, cells exposed to the fragment of IpaA lacking the vinculin binding site (GFP-IpaA-(1-500)) behaved similarly to full-length GFP-IpaA, and exhibited a noticeable decrease in the number of actin stress fibers (Figs. 2 and 3C). Taken together these results demonstrate that vinculin is not required for IpaA-induced cytoskeletal rearrangements. These findings led us to pursue alternative mechanisms for how IpaA induces a loss of actin stress fibers. The small GTPase Rho appeared as a likely candidate because inhibiting Rho leads to a loss of stress fibers and focal adhesions. We measured Rho activity in cells expressing GFP-IpaA. Contrary to what we expected, we found that cells expressing GFP-IpaA had elevated RhoGTP levels when compared with the GFP-expressing cells (Fig. 4A). This effect could be mapped to the first 500 amino acid residues of IpaA because cells expressing GFP-IpaA-(1-500), but not GFP-IpaA-(500-633), had high Rho activity (Fig. 4A). One downstream effector of Rho is Rho kinase, which promotes myosin light chain phosphorylation thereby stimulating actomyosin contractility (16Amano M. Ito M. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Chihara K. Nakano T. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20246-20249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar, 17Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2443) Google Scholar). To determine whether increased contractility is a consequence of increased Rho activity in cells expressing IpaA, we examined myosin light chain phosphorylation in lysates harvested from GFP or GFP-IpaA-expressing cells. In comparison to the GFP control cells, myosin light chain phosphorylation was increased in lysates harvested from GFP-IpaA or GFP-IpaA-(1-500) (Fig. 4B). The GFP-IpaA-(500-633) expressing cells showed no change in the levels of phosphorylated myosin light chain when compared with the GFP controls (Fig. 4B). Hence IpaA activates Rho and increases the phosphorylation of myosin light chain independently of binding to vinculin. If IpaA-induced cell rounding is the result of increased actomyosin contractility stimulated by elevated Rho activity, then inhibiting this pathway should prevent cell rounding. To test this, we incubated cells with a low dose of the Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 that inhibits Rho kinase activity without inducing gross structural changes in cell morphology. These cells were microinjected with GST or GST-IpaA. We found that cells preincubated with Y27632 and injected with GST-IpaA resembled the GST-injected cells, in that they did not round during the first 30 min of exposure (supplemental Data B). This confirmed that IpaA-dependent cell rounding is the result of Rho-mediated increased contractility. IpaA Induces the Disassembly of Focal Adhesions—Cells expressing GFP-IpaA appeared less well spread, consistent with the idea that IpaA may be decreasing integrin-mediated cell adhesion. To test this hypothesis, we used FACS analysis to determine whether IpaA affects the affinity or amount of β1 integrin on the cell surface using the monoclonal antibodies 12G10 and TS216 (32Mould A.P. Garratt A.N. Askari J.A. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Myc-IpaA-expressing cells showed a marked decrease in active integrins on the cell surface as compared with the Myc only expressing cells (Fig. 5A). The total levels of integrin on the cell surface were not altered in the two cell types (Fig. 5B) suggesting that IpaA induces de-adhesion by decreasing integrin affinity for its ligands. Control of integrin affinity for ligands is regulated by talin recruitment to the cytoplasmic domain (33Tadokoro S. Shattil S.J. Eto K. Tai V. Liddington R.C. de Pereda J.M. Ginsberg M.H. Calderwood D.A. Science. 2003; 302: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). This triggers conformational changes in the integrin associated with a conversion from a low to a high affinity for ligands (34Kim M. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Science. 2003; 301: 1720-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar) and the subsequent recruitment of other cytoskeletal proteins to this site. Because IpaA decreases integrin affinity for ligands, we assessed whether it perturbs talin binding to vinculin or the integrin cytoplasmic domain itself. We first explored coprecipitation of talin with vinculin in immunoprecipitates from cells expressing GFP or GFP-IpaA. In comparison with the talin recruitment to vinculin in the GFP-expressing cells, we noticed a slight decrease in the amount of talin recruited to vinculin in cells expressing GFP-IpaA 18 h post-transfection (Fig. 6A). In cells 30 h post-transfection, GFP-IpaA, but not GFP alone, resulted in a decrease in the level of talin coprecipitating with vinculin (Fig. 6A). We considered whether talin binding to the integrin cytoplasmic domain was affected under these conditions. Two possibilities exist. Talin recruitment to the intracellular domain of integrin β subunit is lost or talin remains bound. Because the affinity of integrins for talin is very low and hard to detect in conventional integrin immunoprecipitates, we took advantage of a recombinant integrin construct that mimics four clustered integrin cytoplasmic domains (29Pfaff M. Liu S. Erle D.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6104-6109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Histagged versions of these integrin cytoplasmic domain mimetics were produced in bacteria, purified and attached to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads. We found that this construct readily recovered talin from platelet extracts (data not shown) and addition of varying concentrations of GST or GST-IpaA-(500-633) to the platelet extracts did not interfere with talin binding (Fig. 6B). In contrast addition of even low amounts of GST-IpaA (0.2 μg) to the extracts decreased talin recruitment and high doses (2 μg) of GST-IpaA or GST-IpaA-(1-500) blocked binding of talin to the integrin cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 6B). These findings suggest that IpaA disrupts cell-matrix adhesions by interfering with the recruitment of talin to the integrin cytoplasmic domain. In this study we examined the mechanism for IpaA-induced cytoskeletal rearrangements. Earlier work suggested that IpaA binds to vinculin and induces increased recruitment of F-actin to vinculin and depolymerization of actin stress fibers (8Tran Van Nhieu G. Ben-Ze'ev A. Sansonetti P.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2717-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 21Bourdet-Sicard R. Rudiger M. Jockusch B.M. Gounon P. Sansonetti P.J. Nhieu G.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5853-5862Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Here we show that vinculin is not required for the effects of IpaA on the actin cytoskeleton. Our data do not suggest that the interaction of vinculin is unimportant for Shigella, but that it is not needed for the disruption of stress fibers or cell rounding that occur in response to IpaA. Rather we present evidence that IpaA activates the small GTPase Rho leading to elevated myosin light chain phosphorylation and increased contractility. Furthermore, we find that IpaA decreases cell-matrix adhesion and the mechanism for this involves preventing talin from binding to the integrin β1 cytoplasmic domain. Together these observations lead us to suggest that one way that IpaA induces cytoskeletal rearrangements necessary for Shigella entry is to coordinately regulate the activity of Rho and the disassembly of cell-matrix adhesions. Moreover, the result of these two effects, namely weakened adhesion and increased contractility account for the loss of actin stress fibers and cell rounding observed in cultured cells into which IpaA has been introduced. At the outset of this work we were motivated to determine how IpaA binding to vinculin induces a loss of stress fibers. Surprisingly, we found that the loss of stress fibers and cell rounding occur in mouse embryo fibroblasts that lack vinculin (Fig. 2), as well as in normal cells expressing a mutant of IpaA that is unable to bind vinculin (Fig. 3C and supplemental data). These findings differ from earlier work indicating that vinculin is required for the effects of IpaA (21Bourdet-Sicard R. Rudiger M. Jockusch B.M. Gounon P. Sansonetti P.J. Nhieu G.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5853-5862Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). One difference between our work and the earlier work is that the studies presented here were performed using vinculin-null mouse embryo fibroblasts and the earlier work utilized cancer cell lines that lack detectable levels of vinculin expression. It is possible that there are some compensatory pathways that are up-regulated in the vinculin-null mouse embryo fibroblasts that may account for some of the differences between our work and the earlier studies. However, our observation that IpaA exerts its effects on the actin cytoskeleton in the absence of an intact vinculin binding site when expressed in “normal” cell lines strongly argues against a major role for vinculin in the IpaA-mediated loss of actin stress fibers. These findings raise the question as to what is the relevance of IpaA binding to vinculin at the site of Shigella entry. Previous studies and our work here demonstrate that vinculin is readily recruited to IpaA (Refs. 8Tran Van Nhieu G. Ben-Ze'ev A. Sansonetti P.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2717-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar and 21Bourdet-Sicard R. Rudiger M. Jockusch B.M. Gounon P. Sansonetti P.J. Nhieu G.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5853-5862Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, and Fig. 1). We considered the possibility that vinculin might localize IpaA to the proper locale at the site of entry. However, this seems very unlikely because vinculin recruitment to the site of entry is both Rho- and IpaA-dependent (8Tran Van Nhieu G. Ben-Ze'ev A. Sansonetti P.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2717-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 10Watarai M. Kamata Y. Kozaki S. Sasakawa C. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Alternatively, vinculin binding may be needed for some as yet to be identified functions of IpaA. For example, IpaA shares some homology with the Salmonella entry effector SipA, which has several biological functions. It will be interesting to determine whether IpaA has similar activities to SipA and if these activities are affected by the interaction of IpaA with vinculin. It is also possible that recruitment of IpaA to vinculin affects a later step of bacterial invasion, such as the intercellular motility of Shigella. Vinculin has been shown to be cleaved upon Shigella entry exposing ActA homolog binding sites and increasing bacterial motility 3-fold (35Laine R.O. Zeile W. Kang F. Purich D.L. Southwick F.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1255-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Finally, there is some evidence that suggests that vinculin stabilizes the maturation of small integrin-talin complexes into more stable adhesions (36Papagrigoriou E. Gingras A.R. Barsukov I.L. Bate N. Fillingham I.J. Patel B. Frank R. Ziegler W.H. Roberts G.C. Critchley D.R. Emsley J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2942-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) raising the intriguing possibility that IpaA binds vinculin to sequester it away from an integrin-containing complex. If IpaA hijacks vinculin in this manner, IpaA would be expected to promote the turnover of the adhesion structure. This would confer upon IpaA an additional level with which it is able to regulate adhesion complexes and actin cytoskeletal rearrangements during Shigella invasion. Rather than vinculin mediating the effects of IpaA on the cytoskeleton, we found that IpaA activates Rho (Fig. 4). At first, high Rho activity seemed an unlikely candidate for mediating the effect of IpaA because elevated Rho activity triggers the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions. However, in situations when adhesion is weak, such as in IpaA-expressing cells (Figs. 5 and 6), the increased contractility from high Rho activity would lead to cell rounding and a loss of stress fibers. This is analogous to what happens to a cell that is rounded during mitosis (37Maddox A.S. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). How IpaA activates Rho is not known. It has no known sequence homology to guanine nucleotide exchange factors for members of the Rho family of GTPases or other bacterial proteins that serve as guanine nucleotide exchange factors suggesting that it is unlikely that IpaA acts alone as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor. The possibility that IpaA activates an endogenous guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rho or inhibits a Rho GTPase activating protein will be investigated in future studies. We also found that IpaA induces a loss of integrin-mediated adhesion. Cells expressing GFP-IpaA had a lower affinity for integrin ligands than GFP expressing cells and recruitment of talin to the integrin cytoplasmic domain was impaired. Unlike other bacteria, Shigella preferentially enters polarized epithelial cells at the basolateral pole, a region rich in α5β1 integrins (15Mounier J. Vasselon T. Hellio R. Lesourd M. Sansonetti P.J. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 237-248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and this effect is mimicked in cell culture where Shigella invade more efficiently at focal adhesions (20Watarai M. Funato S. Sasakawa C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 991-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Hence decreased adhesion at the site of Shigella entry is likely to be a late step in the invasion process and is consistent with the observation that IpaA facilitates entry but is not required (8Tran Van Nhieu G. Ben-Ze'ev A. Sansonetti P.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2717-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). It is striking that the Shigella Ipa proteins target both sides of integrin-type adhesions. Thus, IpaB and IpaC bind to the extracellular domain of integrins and have been implicated in attachment of the bacterium to host cells and subsequent internalization (20Watarai M. Funato S. Sasakawa C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 991-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). On the other hand, IpaA binds to vinculin (8Tran Van Nhieu G. Ben-Ze'ev A. Sansonetti P.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2717-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), a protein at the cytoplasmic face of integrin-mediated adhesions, and we show here that it blocks the interaction of talin with integrin cytoplasmic domains. The effects appear at first sight to be antagonistic, initially promoting adhesion and then disrupting it. This leads us to speculate that the bacterium may be exploiting host mechanisms for internalization of adhesion complexes. Recent evidence indicates that focal adhesions (sites of integrin engagement and clustering) are turned over by an endocytic mechanism (38Ezratty E.J. Partridge M.A. Gundersen G.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 581-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Little is known about how integrins are internalized, but it is likely that they must first be disengaged from their cytoskeletal attachments. This would be favored by dissociation of talin from the cytoplasmic domain. Consequently, it is possible that a complex of IpaB and IpaC initiate the internalization process and the inhibition of talin binding to integrins by IpaA may promote a later step in endocytosis and contribute to the uptake of bacteria. We thank Mark Ginsberg for the generous gift of the β1a recombinant integrin cytoplasmic domain construct, Malabi Ventakersan for the pEC15 plasmid encoding IpaA, and Eileen Adamson for the vinculin-null mouse embryo fibroblasts.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12334-12344Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In vivo the individual Eg5 motor domains probably do not function independently; therefore, analysis of a higher order oligomeric structure is necessitated. Indeed, previous analysis of dimeric Eg5, Eg5-513, has indicated that two conjoined motor domains exhibit cooperativity in vitro (34Krzysiak T.C. Wendt T. Sproul L.R. Tittmann P. Gross H. Gilbert S.P. Hoenger A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2263-2273Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 35Valentine M.T. Fordyce P.M. Krzysiak T.C. Gilbert S.P. Block S.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 470-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In comparison to a single Eg5 motor domain, the steady-state ATPase of Eg5-513 is reduced 10-fold suggesting the physical attachment of two motor domains causes a reciprocal modulation of each enzymatic cycle (34Krzysiak T.C. Wendt T. Sproul L.R. Tittmann P. Gross H. Gilbert S.P. Hoenger A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2263-2273Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Also, a His5-tagged form of Eg5-513 has displayed processivity in single molecule studies (35Valentine M.T. Fordyce P.M. Krzysiak T.C. Gilbert S.P. Block S.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 470-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), strongly suggesting that dimeric Eg5, like other kinetically characterized dimeric kinesins, is able to maintain the ATPase cycles of its motor domains out of phase to facilitate processive stepping. To begin to dissect the nature of these cooperative interactions, a mechanistic analysis of the individual steps in the ATPase cycle has been employed. Like conventional kinesin (36Hackney D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6865-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 37Gilbert S.P. Moyer M.L. Johnson K.A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 724-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), dimeric Eg5 alternates the catalysis of its motor domains to allow for processive movement along the MT. However, dimeric Eg5 is the first kinesin motor found to have its ATPase cycle limited by ATP hydrolysis during a processive run. Experimental Conditions—All experiments were performed in ATPase buffer: 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, with KOH, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 50 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol at room temperature (25 °C). The listed MT concentrations represent the concentration of αβ-tubulin heterodimer that has been polymerized. Paclitaxel (Taxol) in Me2SO was used throughout to stabilize the MT polymer. For experiments in which a MT·Eg5-513 complex was treated with apyrase, the complex was incubated with 0.02 unit/ml apyrase (Grade VII, Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 min. Apyrase treatment was performed for 1 h when Eg5-513 was free in solution, because ADP release is slowed significantly in the absence of MTs. Apyrase converts free ADP to AMP plus Pi. However, the affinity of Eg5-513 for AMP is so weak that apyrase treatment effectively generates a nucleotide-free state for Eg5 (data not shown). Apyrase-treated Eg5-513 was fully active based on MT binding (34Krzysiak T.C. Wendt T. Sproul L.R. Tittmann P. Gross H. Gilbert S.P. Hoenger A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2263-2273Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and steady-state ATP turnover (data not shown). Expression and Purification—Eg5-513 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by MT affinity as described previously (34Krzysiak T.C. Wendt T. Sproul L.R. Tittmann P. Gross H. Gilbert S.P. Hoenger A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2263-2273Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Concentrations for Eg5-513 are reported as single motor head concentrations. MantATP Binding—The MT·Eg5 complex was first treated with apyrase to produce the nucleotide-free state of the motor. After treatment the complex was rapidly mixed with racemic mantATP in the KinTek SF2003 stopped-flow (KinTek Corp., Austin, TX), and an increase in fluorescence was monitored (λex = 360 nm, λem = 460 nm, 400 nm long pass filter). The fluorescence enhancement was biphasic, and the data were best fit to two exponential functions. Experiments were also performed with 3′-mant-2′-dATP to determine whether the biphasic nature of the transients observed with racemic mantATP was due to the mixture of the 2′- and 3′-mantATP isomers. The kinetics of 3′-mant-2′-dATP binding were also biphasic and comparable to the kinetics with the racemic mant-ATP purchased from Invitrogen Molecular Probes (data not shown). The rate of the observed fluorescence enhancement for the initial exponential phase was dependent on the mantATP concentration. These data followed a hyperbolic function (Fig. 1B), which is indicative of two-step substrate binding with a rapid equilibrium to form the collision complex followed by an isomerization to the species that is competent for ATP hydrolysis. The data in Fig. 1B were fit to Equation 1, kobs=[K1k+1‘[ATP]/(K1[ATP]+1)]+k-1‘(Eq. 1) where K1 represents the equilibrium association constant for formation of the collision complex (Kd = 1/K1), and k+1′ is the maximum rate of the first-order isomerization. The second-order rate constant for mantATP binding is equal to K1k+1′, and the y-intercept defines the dissociation rate, k-1′. The second phase of the mantATP transients showed a linear increase in rate with an increase in mantATP concentration (Fig. 1C). These data were fit to the following function, kobs=kon*[ATP]+koff(Eq. 2) where kobs is the observed exponential rate of the fluorescence enhancement, kon is the second-order rate constant of nucleotide binding, and koff is the dissociation rate obtained from the y-intercept. Pulse-Chase Measurement of ATP Binding—Preformed MT·Eg5 complexes were rapidly mixed with MgATP plus trace [α-32P]ATP in the KinTek chemical quench-flow instrument for a set time and chased with an excess of nonradioactive MgATP (10 mm final). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 half-lives and quenched with formic acid. [α-32P]ADP and Pi were separated from ATP using thin layer chromatography and quantified using Image Gauge V4.0 software (Fuji Photo Film). The individual transients were fit to the burst equation, [ADP]=A*[1-exp(-kbt)]+kslowt(Eq. 3) where A is the amplitude of the initial burst of product formation on the active site during the first turnover, t is the time in seconds, kb is the rate constant of the exponential burst, and kslow is the rate of subsequent ATP-binding events. Acid-quench Experiments—A preformed MT·Eg5 complex was rapidly mixed with MgATP plus trace [α-32P]ATP in the quench-flow instrument. At varying times of incubation, reactions were quenched with 5 m formic acid, and product formation was both resolved and quantified in the same manner as described for the pulse-chase experiments. Single turnover experiments were performed with Eg5-513 active sites in excess of MgATP concentration. The data from these experiments were fit to a single exponential function. Phosphate Release—A solution containing a preformed MT·Eg5 complex and the MDCC-labeled phosphate-binding protein from E. coli (MDCC-PBP) (38Gilbert S.P. Webb M.R. Brune M. Johnson K.A. Nature. 1995; 373: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 40Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) was rapidly mixed with MgATP in the stopped-flow instrument (λex = 425 nm, λem = 466 nm, 450 nm long pass filter). Final concentrations were as follows: 0.5 μm Eg5-513, 4 μm MTs, 20 μm Taxol, 5 μm MDCC-PBP, and varying concentrations of MgATP. In this assay, Pi liberated from the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP·Pi will be rapidly and tightly bound by the MDCC-PBP, eliciting a fluorescence increase (40Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). To remove any Pi present in the buffer that is not a result of an enzymatic event, all solutions were supplemented with a “Pi Mop” (0.05 unit/ml bacterial purine nucleoside phosphorylase plus 0.5 mm 7-methylguanosine) and incubated at 25 °C for at least 30 min prior to experimentation. The fluorescence amplitude was converted to Pi concentration using a KH2PO4 standard curve generated on the day of the experiment (41Klumpp L.M. Hoenger A. Gilbert S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3444-3449Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Single turnover experiments were also performed with Eg5-513 active sites in excess of MgATP concentration. An MT·Eg5-513 complex (30 μm Eg5-513, 40 μm MTs, and 40 μm Taxol) was treated with apyrase, and the complex was sedimented (Beckman-Coulter Optima TLX Ultracentrifuge, TLA 100 rotor, 100 × g for 30 min) to remove the apyrase, AMP, and Pi that partitioned to the supernatant. The MT pellet was then resuspended in ATPase buffer supplemented with the Pi Mop and incubated at 25 °C for 20 min. The solution was adjusted to 40 μm MDCC-PBP and incubated at 25 °C for 1 h. During resuspension, recovery of the MT·Eg5-513 complex was assumed to be 100%. To determine the concentration of Eg5-513 present following centrifugation, SDS-PAGE was performed to compare the experimental sample with an Eg5-513 standard curve. Dissociation of the MT·Eg5-513 Complex—MT·Eg5-513 complex dissociation was observed by monitoring a decrease in turbidity (λ = 340 nm) in the stopped-flow instrument. A preformed MT·Eg5-513 complex was rapidly mixed with MgAXP (magnesium with ATP, ADP, ATPγS, or AMPPNP). Kinetic measurements of the rate of MT·Eg5 complex dissociation were performed as a function of MgATP. The observed exponential rates were plotted and hyperbolically fit. For dissociation experiments, an additional 200 mm KCl (100 mm final) was added to the nucleotide syringe to weaken and therefore slow motor rebinding to the MT. Dissociation of the MT·Eg5-513 complex was also evaluated by mixing motor with MTs plus MgATP without additional salt. Formation of the MT·Eg5-513 Complex—The pre-steadystate kinetics of MT·Eg5-513 association were determined by monitoring an increase in turbidity (λ = 340 nm) in the stopped-flow instrument. Apyrase-treated or untreated Eg5-513 was mixed with increasing MT concentrations. The rates of the exponential phase of each transient were plotted as a function of MT concentration and fit to the following linear equation, kobs=kassoc*[MT]+koff(Eq. 4) where kobs is the rate of the exponential change in turbidity, kassoc is the second-order rate constant of complex formation (k+4), and koff is defined by the y-intercept. MantADP Release—Measurements of the rate of ADP release from Eg5-513 triggered by the formation of the MT·Eg5-513 complex were performed by first incubating Eg5-513 with mantADP racemate at a 1:1 stoichiometry. The Eg5-513·mantADP complexes were subsequently mixed with increasing amounts of MTs plus 1 mm MgATP, and a decrease in mantADP fluorescence was monitored (λex = 360 nm, λem = 460 nm, 400 nm long pass filter). The observed exponential rate constants were then fit to a hyperbola. MantATP Binding—The rate of substrate binding by dimeric Eg5 was pursued by two methods: monitoring the fluorescence enhancement of mantATP binding to Eg5-513 (Fig. 1) and pulse-chase analysis (Fig. 2). A preformed MT·Eg5-513 complex was treated with apyrase to remove any ADP that accompanied Eg5-513 through purification, and the resultant nucleotide-free complex was rapidly mixed with mantATP in the stopped-flow instrument. A nucleotide-free MT·Eg5-513 complex was used in these experiments because ADP co-purified with Eg5-513 (34Krzysiak T.C. Wendt T. Sproul L.R. Tittmann P. Gross H. Gilbert S.P. Hoenger A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2263-2273Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The co-purifying ADP has been observed to cause Eg5-513 to partition off of the MT (34Krzysiak T.C. Wendt T. Sproul L.R. Tittmann P. Gross H. Gilbert S.P. Hoenger A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2263-2273Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C, inset) and in essence reduce the number of Eg5-513 active sites that participate in the first mantATP binding event. The transients in Fig. 1A reveal that the fluorescence enhancement promoted by mantATP binding was biphasic with an initial fast phase followed by a slower phase. Because the amplitudes of the first and second phases were approximately equal, the kinetics suggest that the biphasic transients represent mantATP binding to both active sites of dimeric Eg5-513. In contrast, the transients for monomeric Eg5-367 were monophasic and best fit to a single exponential function (30Cochran J.C. Sontag C.A. Maliga Z. Kapoor T.M. Correia J.J. Gilbert S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38861-38870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The mantATP binding transients for Eg5-513 were fit to two exponential functions, and both phases showed mantATP concentration dependence. For the initial fast phase, the observed rate of mantATP binding followed a hyperbolic dependence. Deviation from linearity for mantATP binding indicated at least a two-step process with the initial collision being a rapid equilibrium, followed by a rate-limiting conformational change (k+1′). The fit of the data to Equation 1 provided the second-order rate constant, K1k+1′ = 5.8 μm-1 s-1, k+1′ = 54 s-1, and apparent Kd,mantATP = 9.4 μm. The observed rates of mantATP binding obtained from the second, slower exponential phase were linear as a function of mantATP concentration from 0 to 50 μm mantATP (Fig. 1C). These data were fit to Equation 2, which provided the second-order rate constant of the second phase for mantATP binding at 0.14 μm-1 s-1. The concentration dependence of both phases suggests that this assay is monitoring two separate nucleotide binding events by two distinct populations, presumably head 1 versus head 2 of the dimeric molecule. ATP Binding by Pulse-Chase—To determine the kinetics of Eg5-513 binding the natural substrate MgATP, pulse-chase experiments were performed (Fig. 2). A preformed MT·Eg5-513 complex was rapidly mixed with MgATP plus a trace of [α-32P]ATP and chased with an excess of unlabeled MgATP. This experimental design ensures that any weakly bound radiolabeled substrate from collision complex formation will be effectively out-competed by cold substrate, and only the formation of an MT·Eg5-513·ATP complex that proceeds through ATP hydrolysis will be monitored. The individual transients (Fig. 2A) were fit to the burst equation (Equation 3). A plot of the observed rates of the exponential burst of product formation as a function of ATP concentration can be fit to a hyperbolic function providing k+1′ = 50 s-1 and the apparent Kd,ATP = 35 μm (Fig. 2D). At low ATP concentrations, where the data can be fit linearly, the slope of the line provides a second-order rate constant of ATP binding, k+1 = 1.2 μm-1 s-1 and an off-rate determined by the y-intercept of 1.4 s-1 (Fig. 2D, inset). As with the mant-ATP binding experiment, deviation from linearity indicates a two-step process with substrate binding limited by a conformational change. The observed rates from both the pulse-chase and mantATP experiments (50 s-1 and 54 s-1, respectively) are in good agreement with each other, suggesting that the experimental approaches were monitoring the same event. Furthermore, the fact that product formation during the first ATP turnover was visible as well as the k+1′ being 100-fold faster than steady-state ATP turnover (34Krzysiak T.C. Wendt T. Sproul L.R. Tittmann P. Gross H. Gilbert S.P. Hoenger A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2263-2273Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), indicates that ATP binding is a rapid event in the cycle. Additional information can also be gained from the amplitude of the transients as well as from the rate of the linear phase of the transients. From the burst amplitude data, the percentage of the motor population that is participating in the first ATP turnover can be determined. In these experiments, the effective motor population is represented only by motor bound to the MT. When Eg5 is free in solution, the ATPase cycle is limited by ADP release at 0.002 s-1 (34Krzysiak T.C. Wendt T. Sproul L.R. Tittmann P. Gross H. Gilbert S.P. Hoenger A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2263-2273Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and will not significantly contribute to the observed signal. As evidenced by the inset SDS-PAGE gel in Fig. 2C, not all motor is bound to the MT at the start of the experiment, and the effective motor population needs to be corrected for the motor that is free in solution. After normalizing for the percentage of the motor population that is bound to the MT and therefore able to bind and hydrolyze ATP at the MT-activated rate, 97 ± 5% of motor active sites were competent to bind and hydrolyze ATP during the first turnover. The apparent Kd,ATP determined from the burst amplitude data at 57 μm (Fig. 2F) was higher than the apparent Kd,ATP determined from the rate of the burst in Fig. 2D at 35 μm. The Kd,ATP difference is suggestive that the burst rate is monitoring predominantly head 1, whereas the burst amplitude data represent both head 1 and head 2. The rate of the linear phase of the transients represents subsequent ATP turnovers and is therefore enzyme concentration-dependent. The rate of the linear phase must also be corrected for the fraction of motor that is not bound to the MT at the start of the experiment. The observed rate of the linear phase approached kmax = 5.7 μm ADP·s-1 with the K½,ATP = 26.7 μm. Considering that only 85-90% of the motor (4.25-4.5 μm of 5 μm) was bound to the MT under the experimental conditions (Fig. 2C, inset), the predicted slow step governing subsequent ATP turnover events was 1.27-1.34 s-1 per μm Eg5-513. Acid-quench Analysis of ATP Hydrolysis—The kinetics of ATP hydrolysis were originally pursued by rapidly mixing a preformed MT·Eg5-513 complex (5 μm Eg5-513, 6 μm MTs) with Mg[α-32P]ATP in excess of enzyme concentration in the quench-flow instrument. Surprisingly, a burst of product formation during the first ATP turnover was not observed as compared with the pulse-chase transients at the same ATP concentration (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. S1A). There are several possibilities that can account for this result: (1) ATP binding is rate-limiti"

To elucidate the molecular basis of these anti-inflammatory effects, we analyzed the role of DSCR1 in the regulation of NF-κB transactivation using glioblastoma cells stably transfected with DSCR1.4 or its truncation mutants (DSCR1.4-(1–133) and DSCR1.4-(134–197)). Overexpression of DSCR1.4 significantly attenuated the induction of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) via a calcineurin-independent mechanism. Experiments using inhibitors of the signaling molecules for NF-κB activation showed that NF-κB is responsible for the induction of COX-2. Full-length and truncated DSCR1.4 decreased the steady-state activity of NF-κB as well as PMA-induced activation of NF-κB, which correlated with attenuation of COX-2 induction. DSCR1.4 did not affect the PMA-stimulated phosphorylation or degradation kinetics of IκBα; however, DSCR1.4 significantly decreased the basal turnover rate of IκBα and consequently up-regulated its steady-state level. In the same context, knockdown of endogenous DSCR1.4 increased the turnover rate of IκBα as well as COX-2 induction. These results suggest that DSCR1 attenuates NF-κB-mediated transcriptional activation by stabilizing its inhibitory protein, IκBα.

The human Down syndrome critical region 1 gene was isolated from chromosome 21q22, and it was thought to be located within a region that is involved in the expression of the Down syndrome phenotype (1Fuentes J.J.

DSCR1 encodes a protein that binds to the catalytic subunit of calcineurin, inhibiting its phosphatase activity (4Fuentes J.J. Genesca L. Kingsbury T.J. Cunningham K.W. Perez-Riba M. Estivill X. de la Luna S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, it is also called modulatory calcineurin-interacting protein 1 or calcipressin 1 to reflect this function (5Rothermel B.A. Vega R.B. Williams R.S. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2003; 13: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The DSCR1 gene consists of seven exons: exons 1–4 can be alternatively spliced, resulting in four different transcripts (denoted DSCR1.1 through DSCR1.4). DSCR1.1 and DSCR1.4 are widely expressed, particularly in the central nervous system, skeletal muscle, and heart. However, DSCR1.2 has been detected only in fetal liver and brain, and DSCR1.3 has not been detected in any tissue (5Rothermel B.A. Vega R.B. Williams R.S. Trends Cardiovasc.

Biophys. 1997; 342: 6-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), all of which are frequently implicated in the initiation and maintenance of the inflammatory process. Therefore, DSCR1 is likely to play a significant role as a negative regulatory element in the inflammatory reaction. Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) is a transcription factor involved in the regulation of many cellular target genes that play a central role in immune and inflammatory response (18Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3448) Google Scholar). In resting cells, most NF-κB dimers are sequestered in the cytoplasm through association with inhibitory proteins known as inhibitors of κB (IκB), of which IκBα is the best characterized. NF-κB-activating signals generated by stimulation with mitogens or cytokines result in rapid degradation of IκBα, allowing NF-κB to localize to the nucleus, where it acts on its target genes. This stimulation-induced IκBα degradation is initiated by phosphorylation of IκBα at serines 32 and 36 by a large IκB kinase (IKK) complex (IKKα·IKKβ·IKKγ·NEMO), which labels IκBα for degradation by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway (18Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3448) Google Scholar, 19Chen F.E. Ghosh G. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6845-6852Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 20DiDonato J. Mercurio F.

Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). On the other hand, phosphorylation of the C-terminal region of IκBα, which is rich in proline (P), glutamic acid (E), serine (S), and threonine (T) residues (called the PEST domain), has been implicated as the proteolytic signal that determines the basal turnover rate of IκBα in resting cells (23Lin R. Beauparlant P. Makris C. Meloche S. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1401-1409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24McElhinny J.A. Trushin S.A. Bren G.D. Chester N. Paya C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 899-906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the PEST domain is mediated by the constitutively active protein kinase casein kinase 2 (CK2) (25Schwarz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Verma I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3554-3559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Barroga C.F. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7637-7641Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of CK2 expression by transforming growth factor β1 increases the half-life of IκBα, which is followed by a decrease in constitutive NF-κB activity in murine hepatocyte cells (27Cavin L.G. Romieu-Mourez R. Panta G.R. Sun J. Factor V.M. Thorgeirsson S.S. Sonenshein G.E. Arsura M. Hepatology. 2003; 38: 1540-1551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, ultraviolet radiation increases CK2-mediated degradation of IκBα, resulting in activation of NF-κBin HeLa cells (28Kato Jr., T. Delhase M. Hoffmann A. Karin M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). These studies show that regulation of the basal turnover of IκBα is another potential means of controlling NF-κB activity. Here, we investigated the molecular basis of the mechanism by which DSCR1 inhibits the expression of genes associated with inflammation. This study shows for the first time that DSCR1.4 decreases the basal turnover rate of IκBα and consequently attenuates the steady-state and stimulus-induced transcriptional activity of NF-κB in human U87MG glioblastoma cells. In addition, we demonstrate that this inhibition of the NF-κB pathway by DSCR1.4 is functionally significant by showing that overexpression of DSCR1.4 reduced induction of the NF-κB target genes cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), which were induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or pro-inflammatory cytokines. Chemicals and Antibodies—Cyclosporin A, FK506, IL-1β, PD 98059, SB 203580, Ro-31-8220, calmodulin kinase IINtide, hypoestoxide, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were purchased from Calbiochem. PMA, A23187, and cycloheximide were purchased from Sigma. An antibody specific for COX-2 was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Antibodies for NF-κB (p65), protein kinase C (PKC), IκBα (clone C-20), and IL-1β were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies for IκBα, phospho-IκBα Ser-32, phospho-IκBα Thr-291, and phospho-ERK1/2 Thr-202/Tyr-204 were purchased from Cell Signaling Biotechnology (Beverly, MA). Cell Culture and Treatments—Human U87MG glioblastoma cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The cells were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate, and 10% fetal bovine serum under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For experiments, cells (5 × 105/well) were plated in a gelatin-coated 6-well culture dish and incubated for 20 h in complete medium and then for 4 h under serum-reduced conditions (minimal essential medium with 0.1% fetal bovine serum) prior to treatment. For COX-2 induction experiments, cultures were stimulated with PMA (25 ng/ml) plus A23187 (1 μm), PMA (25 ng/ml) alone, TNF-α (10 ng/ml), or IL-1β (5 ng/ml) for the times indicated in the figure legends. In some experiments, cells were pretreated with inhibitors of signaling molecules for 15 min before PMA stimulation. For IκBα turnover studies, quiescent cells were incubated for the indicated times in the presence of cycloheximide (20 μg/ml). At the ends of the experiments, whole cell extracts were prepared and subjected to immunoblot analysis as described below. Plasmid Construction—To construct plasmids encoding recombinant DSCR1.4 protein containing an N-terminal (ntDSCR1) or C-terminal (ctDSCR1) green fluorescent protein (GFP) tag, human wild-type DSCR1.4 cDNA was amplified by PCR and cloned in-frame into the pcDNA3.1/NT-GFP-TOPO or pcDNA3.1/CT-GFP-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), respectively. Primer sets for PCR were as follows: for ntDSCR1, 5′-GGATCCAAATGCATTTTAGAAACTTTAAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTCGAGTCAGCTGAGGTGGATCGGCGTGTA-3′ (reverse); and for ctDSCR1, 5′-GAAAGCAAGATGCATTTTAGAAACTTT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAGTCCAGCTGAGGTGGATCGGCGTGT-3′ (reverse). To construct plasmids for expression of proteins without GFP fusion tags, full-length or truncated DSCR1.4 cDNA fragments were subcloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the pIRES-hrGFP-2 vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Primer sets for PCR were as follows: for full-length DSCR1.4, 5′-CGGATCCAGCAAGATGCATTTTAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAATTCTCAGCTGAGGTGGATCGG-3′ (reverse); for the DSCR1.4 mutant with a C-terminal deletion up to amino acid 133 (DSCR1ΔC), 5′-CGGATCCAGCAAGATGCATTTTAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAATTCTCAATATAAGAGATCATA-3′ (reverse); and for the DSCR1.4 mutant with an N-terminal deletion up to amino acid 134 (DSCR1ΔN), 5′-GGATCCAATATGGCCATCTCCAAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAATTCTCAGCTGAGGTGGATCGG-3′ (reverse). The derivatives of IκBα containing alanine replacements at Ser-32 and Ser-36 (IκBα-mutN) or at Ser-283 and Thr-291 (IκBα-mutC) were generated by overlap extension PCR (29Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar). The PCR fragments were ligated in-frame into the pcDNA3.1D/V5-HisTOPO vector (Invitrogen) to generate vectors expressing V5-His-tagged mutant IκBα proteins. The overlapping primers used for the generation of IκBα-mutN and IκBα-mutC were 5′-CATGGCGTCCAGGCCGGCGTC-3′ and 5′-GGCGTCATAGCTCTCCTCATCCTCGGC-3′, respectively (with the mutation sites underlined). The N-terminal forward and C-terminal reverse primers for ligation into the expression vector were 5′-CACCCGCGCCATGTTCCAG-3′ and 5′-TCTAGATAACGTCAGACGCTGGCC-3′, respectively. To generate an expression construct for the glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged PEST domain of IκBα (GST-PEST), a truncated IκBα cDNA was PCR-amplified using primers 5′-GGATCCCAGCTGACACTAGAAAAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTCGAGCCATAACGTCAGACGCTG-3′ (reverse). The fragments were digested and then ligated into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). The insert sequences of all constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Creation of Stable Cell Lines—Parallel cultures of U87MG cells were transfected with vectors containing each of the DSCR1.4 constructs or with an empty vector using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After selection against 400 μg/ml G418 (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) for 3 weeks, GFP-positive populations were purified using a FACSCalibur machine (BD Biosciences). The selected cells were maintained in complete medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml G418. Transcripts of DSCR1.4 constructs in these cells were confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR amplification (data not shown). RNA Interference—The DSCR1.4 small interfering RNA (siRNA) used was 5′-CUGUGUGGCAAACAGUGAUdTdT-3′. The CK2α and negative control siRNAs were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. In experiments for COX-2 induction studies, cells (3 × 105/well in a 6-well culture dish) were transfected with the siRNA (100 pmol/well) using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. At 48 h after transfection, the cells were stimulated with PMA for 6 h and then harvested for immunoblot analysis. In experiments for mutant IκBα turnover studies, the cells were cotransfected with 100 pmol of siRNA and 1.5 μg of IκBα-mutN or IκBα-mutC. At 48 h after transfection, the cells were treated with cycloheximide as described for IκBα turnover experiments. Luciferase Assay—An NF-κB promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid (pNF-κB-Luc) was obtained from Stratagene, and a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase-Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid (pTK-Luc) from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). Cells (1 × 105/well) were plated in a 24-well culture dish and transfected with 0.5 μg of pNF-κB-Luc and 0.2 μg of pTK-Luc using Lipofectamine 2000. At 24 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with the indicated reagents for 6 h, after which luciferase activity was measured with a MiniLumat luminometer (Berthold Technologies GmbH, Bad Wildbad, Germany) using a Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activities were normalized on the basis of Renilla luciferase luminescence signals. Preparation of GST-PEST Protein and In Vitro Phosphorylation—Escherichia coli BL21 cells (Invitrogen) were transformed with the GST-PEST construct. The transformants were grown to early log phase, and then protein expression was induced for 3 h by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were harvested and disrupted in B-PER reagent (Pierce) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). After insoluble material had been removed by centrifugation, the proteins were recovered from the supernatant by incubation with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). For in vitro phosphorylation of the PEST domain of IκBα by CK2, whole cell extracts (0.5 mg/ml protein) were prepared in kinase buffer (40 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 130 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing protease inhibitor mixture. The assay was conducted in a reaction mixture containing 100 μm ATP with 1 μg of GST-PEST fusion protein as a substrate in a total volume of 30 μl of kinase buffer. The reactions were started by the addition of 10 μl of cell lysate and were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2× Laemmli sample buffer, and the samples were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Immunoblot Analysis—Immediately after the treatments were completed, cultures were lysed in an appropriate volume of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitor mixture). After insoluble material had been removed by centrifugation, the supernatants were mixed with 3× Laemmli sample buffer and denatured for 5 min at 90 °C. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (7 or 12%) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 1% (w/v) Hammerstengrade casein in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20. Immunoblotting was done with appropriate antibodies in 0.5% casein in phosphate-buffered saline. The blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG secondary antibody (Sigma), washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, and then visualized using the SuperSignal West Dura chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce). The band intensity was analyzed using an LAS-3000 image analyzer (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). DSCR1.4 Inhibits PMA-induced COX-2 Expression via a Calcineurin-independent Mechanism—To examine the effects of elevated DSCR1 levels on COX-2 induction, we generated derivatives of the U87MG cell line by transfection with expression vectors for recombinant DSCR1 proteins with GFP fusion tags at the N termini (ntDSCR1) or C termini (ctDSCR1) or with a vector expressing GFP alone as a control. The basal level of COX-2 expression in these cell lines was undetectable by Western blotting (data not shown). For induction of COX-2, cells were stimulated with PMA plus the calcium ionophore A23187 (PMA/A23187) for 8 h. In agreement with previous studies done in endothelial cell cultures (9Hesser B.A. Liang X.H. Camenisch G. Yang S. Lewin D.A. Scheller R. Ferrara N. Gerber H.P. Blood. 2004; 104: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 11Yao Y.G. Duh E.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 321: 648-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the induction of COX-2 was markedly attenuated in cells transfected with ntDSCR1 or ctDSCR1 compared with control cells. This induction of COX-2 expression was also inhibited by the calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporin A and FK506 (Fig. 1A, upper panel), suggesting that calcineurin inhibition by DSCR1 plays a role in this process. In contrast, when COX-2 was induced by PMA alone (no A23187), the induction was reduced only by ntDSCR1 and not by ctDSCR1 or by pretreatment with calcineurin inhibitors (Fig. 1A, lower panel). These results indicate that DSCR1 reduces PMA-induced COX-2 expression via a calcineurin-independent mechanism. To confirm these results, U87MG cells were stably transfected with an expression vector coding for DSCR1.4 without a fusion tag and then tested for stimulus-induced COX-2 expression. As shown in Fig. 1B, overexpression of DSCR1.4 attenuated both PMA/A23187- and PMA-induced COX-2 expression, whereas calcineurin inhibitors reduced only PMA/A23187-induced COX-2 expression. Knockdown of DSCR1.4 Promotes PMA-induced COX-2 Expression—Next, we conducted knockdown experiments with endogenous DSCR1.4. Cells were transfected with synthetic siRNA oligonucleotides targeted against sequences in a region of exon 4 (DSCR1.4 siRNA). We found a 75–80% reduction in DSCR1.4 mRNA levels using real-time PCR analysis (data not shown). We applied this condition to investigate the effects of decreased endogenous DSCR1.4 levels on COX-2 induction by PMA. As shown Fig. 2, knockdown of DSCR1.4 enhanced COX-2 induction, resulting in a 2–4-fold increase in its expression in cells transfected with DSCR1.4 siRNA compared with negative control siRNA. NF-κB Transactivation Is Attenuated by DSCR1.4—On the basis of the site of cleavage of DSCR1.4 by calpain (30Cho Y.-J. Abe M. Kim S.Y. Sato Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 439: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we generated plasmids encoding truncated forms of DSCR1.4 lacking a C-terminal region (amino acids 134–197) or an N-terminal region (amino acids 1–133), termed DSCR1ΔC and DSCR1ΔN, respectively. After stable transfection with DSCR1ΔC, DSCR1ΔN, or a vector coding for full-length DSCR1.4, U87MG cells were stimulated with PMA. As shown in Fig. 3A, full-length DSCR1.4, DSCR1ΔC, and DSCR1ΔN reduced COX-2 expression by 20, 77, and 80%, respectively. Overexpression of DSCR1 inhibits the expression of genes associated with cell adhesion or inflammation such as COX-2, IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), tissue factor 1, E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) (9Hesser B.A. Liang X.H.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 321: 648-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It is worth noting that transcription of these genes is regulated by NF-κB (18Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3448) Google Scholar). Therefore, we carried out a promoter assay to evaluate whether DSCR1.4 inhibits the transcriptional activity of NF-κB. Control and DSCR1-modified cell lines were transfected with an NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter plasmid (Fig. 3B). Stimulation with PMA increased luciferase activity to a similar extent in the control and DSCR1-modified cell lines (∼2.5-fold that of their respective non-stimulated controls). However, the luciferase activities of the DSCR1-modified cells were markedly compared with the control both at steady state and after stimulation with PMA. Because DSCR1ΔN strongly down-regulated NF-κB activity and because overexpression of full-length DSCR1 or DSCR1ΔC caused aggregate formation, 3K.-O. Cho, Y. S. Kim, H. J. Lee, S.-K. Kim, S. Y. Kim, and Y.-J. Cho, unpublished data. we used DSCR1ΔN in subsequent experiments. Moreover, DSCR1ΔN encodes a region that is common to all DSCR1 isoforms. Therefore, this fragment may be of use for elucidating the functions of other isoforms. Inhibitors of Molecules Upstream of NF-κB Activation Decrease COX-2 Induction—Next, we determined whether reduction of NF-κB activity by DSCR1.4 is responsible for the observed attenuation of COX-2 induction. We first investigated signal transduction pathways that could lead to induction of COX-2 expression after stimulation with PMA. Among the inhibitors of signal molecules reportedly involved in PMA-mediated COX-2 expression (31Chang M.S. Chen B.C. Yu M.T. Sheu J.R. Chen T.F. Lin C.H. Cell.

We then determined whether PKC and MEK1 are upstream signal transduction molecules of NF-κB activation. The final obligatory step for activation of NF-κB is the degradation of IκB. Among the different IκB proteins, IκBα plays a major role in PMA-induced activation of NF-κB (35Lallena M.J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Bren G. Paya C.V. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2180-2188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Li J. Peet G.W. Pullen S.S. Schembri-King J. Warren T.C. Marcu K.B. Kehry M.R. Barton R. Jakes S. J. Biol.

Therefore, we tested the effects of inhibitors of PKC and MEK1 on the degradation of IκBα after stimulation with PMA. Ro-31-8220 and PD 98059 significantly inhibited IκBα degradation (Fig. 4, B and C), indicating that PKC and ERK are upstream activators of NF-κB. Next, we examined whether PKC and ERK activation is inhibited by DSCR1ΔN. PMA-stimulated PKC degradation (Fig. 4A, middle panel, third lane) or phosphorylation of ERK (Fig. 4D) was not decreased in DSCR1ΔN-transfected cells. In addition, PMA-stimulated phosphorylation at Ser-32 of IκBα was not inhibited by DSCR1ΔN, suggesting that DSCR1 affects a step downstream of IκBα phosphorylation in NF-κB-activating signaling. DSCR1 Decreases the Basal Degradation and Increases the Steady-state Level of IκBα—Next, we investigated whether PMA-stimulated degradation of IκBα is inhibited by DSCR1ΔN. For this, the time course of IκBα degradation in DSCR1ΔN-transfected cells was compared with that in control cells following stimulation with PMA (Fig. 5, A and B). PMA stimulation resulted in a similar rapid reduction of IκBα in both control and DSCR1ΔN-transfected cells. However, the level of IκBα in DSCR1ΔN-transfected cells was higher than that in control cells throu"

We show here firstly that FoxO1 protein is expressed in both primary mouse islet α and β cells. Examined in clonal αTC1-9 cells, insulin caused endogenous FoxO1 to translocate from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Demonstrating the importance of nuclear exclusion of FoxO1 for the inhibition of preproglucagon gene expression, FoxO1 silencing by RNA interference reduced preproglucagon mRNA levels by >40% in the absence of insulin and abolished the decrease in mRNA levels elicited by the hormone. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed direct binding of FoxO1 to a forkhead consensus binding site, termed GL3, in the preproglucagon gene promoter region, localized –1798 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site. Deletion or mutation of this site diminished FoxO1 binding and eliminated transcriptional regulation by glucose or insulin. FoxO1 silencing also abolished the acute regulation by insulin, but not glucose, of glucagon secretion, demonstrating the importance of FoxO1 expression in maintaining the α-cell phenotype.

Protein kinase B-mediated phosphorylation at Ser-256 is crucial for the subsequent phosphorylation of Thr-24, which in turn allows nuclear export and sequestration of FoxO1 in the cytosol via binding to 14-3-3 proteins (8Rena G.

For example, the forkhead protein Foxa2 (formerly called hepatocyte nuclear factor-3β) regulates transcription of the pdx-1 (10Wu K.L. Gannon M. Peshavaria M. Offield M.F. Henderson E. Ray M.

Moreover, mice in which the expression of forkhead protein Foxa1 is disrupted are hypoglycemic and display low levels of circulating glucagon despite lowered levels of insulin and an increase in the levels of cortisol and growth hormone, and proglucagon mRNA levels are depressed in these mice (14Shih D.Q.

However, the precise role and targets of forkhead proteins within the pancreatic α-cell are at present only partly defined.There are at least four enhancer sites within the first 300 bp immediately upstream of the transcriptional start site of the proglucagon promoter, denoted G1-G4 (17Philippe J.

The G1 and G2 sites within the rat proglucagon gene bind Foxa proteins, predominantly Foxa2, which act as a repressor of preproglucagon gene expression (18Philippe J. Morel C. Prezioso V.R. Mol.

Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 170-183Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Foxa1 can also bind to G2 and, conversely, activate preproglucagon gene transcription (16Kaestner K.H. Katz J. Liu Y. Drucker D.J.

Biol. 1998; 18: 4245-4251Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Although it is has been documented that FoxO1 acts in β cells as a repressor of Foxa2-mediated Pdx1 expression (23Kitamura T. Nakae J. Kitamura Y. Kido Y. Biggs W.H. II I Wright C.V. White M.F. Arden K.C. Accili D. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1839-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), the interplay, if any, between FoxO1 and Foxa2 within α cells has not been explored.In the present study we used RNA silencing and overexpression approaches to determine the role of FoxO1 in the regulation of preproglucagon gene expression and glucagon secretion within clonal αTC1-9 cells. This line serves as a convenient glucose- and insulin-responsive model of the mature α-cell, although it also displays characteristics of less differentiated precursor cells, including a left-shifted dose response to glucose (24Ravier M.A. Rutter G.A. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 1789-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Importantly, the use of these cells allows the effects of glucose and insulin on PPG gene expression to be examined independently, a goal that is difficult to achieve using intact isolated islets. We show that (a) FoxO1 is abundantly expressed in mature primary α cells as well as β cells, and its localization is regulated by insulin, but not glucose, in the former, (b) FoxO1 is required for the effects of insulin on PPG gene expression, (c) FoxO1 binds directly to an upstream region within the preproglucagon promoter, whose elimination or mutation abolishes transcriptional regulation by insulin or glucose. Together these data implicate FoxO1 as an important mediator of the effects of insulin on PPG gene expression and as a critical regulator of α-cell phenotype. Inappropriate nuclear inclusion of FoxO1 may, thus, serve to elevate glucagon gene expression in certain forms of diabetes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsThe SilencerTM Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) 2The abbreviations used are: siRNA, silenced RNA duplex; scRNA, scrambled RNA duplex; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; mRFP, monomeric red fluorescent protein; PPG, preproglucagon; FKHR, Forkhead-related transcription factors; ChREBP, carbohydrate response element-binding protein; fwd, forward; rev, reverse; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; HEK cells, human embryonic kidney cells; USF, upstream stimulatory factor. construction kit was from Ambion (Austin, TX). siRNA oligonucleotides and all primers were from Alta Bioscience (University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK).

Infection of primary cells with adenoviral pPPG(1.6)-mRFP was by an overnight infection of intact islets at 100 plaque-forming units/cell (within 2 h of islet isolation).Measurement of Glucagon SecretionαTC1-9 cells were preincubated for 1 h at 37°C in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate medium containing 10 mmol/liter glucose (control medium). Cells were then incubated for 30 min in 700 μl of medium containing the test substances in a 12-well plate. At the end of the incubations, a 350-μl aliquot of medium was removed for measurement of secreted glucagon. To measure total cellular glucagon, cells were lysed in 500 μl of hydrochloric acid/ethanol (10 min room temperature) and passed through a 23-gauge needle three times.

Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline 4 times, and endogenous FoxO1 was probed overnight using a polyclonal rabbit anti-FKHR antibody (Cell Signaling; 1:50 dilution in blocking buffer). Cells were then washed 4 times using immunocytochemistry wash buffer (6.7% (v/v) glycerol, 0.4% (v/v) Tween 20, 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin) and revealed with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson; 1:200 in blocking buffer). Nuclear staining was achieved by incubating the cells in wash buffer containing DAPI (5 ng/μl) for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were washed a final time and mounted onto glass slides using VECTASHIELD® mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Peterborough, UK).

First, islet slices were studied (Fig. 1). Because of the incompatibility of primary antibodies, α cells were detected by the targeted expression of monomeric red fluorescent protein under control of the preproglucagon promoter (PPG-mRFP; Fig. 1, A and B). This strategy labels mouse islet cells with >93% specificity. 3M. A. Ravier and G. A. Rutter, unpublished data. β cells were detected by immunostaining with an anti-insulin antibody (data not shown). Overlay of images showed that FoxO1 immunoreactivity was apparent in both α and β cells from primary mouse islets. This was studied further using dissociated cells from adult mouse islets (Fig. 2). α cells were again identified by the expression of mRFP (Fig. 2, A and B), whereas β cells were revealed by immunostaining for insulin (Fig. 2, C and D). FoxO1 expression was detected using an anti-FoxO1 antibody (Fig. 2, A and C). Merging of the images showed that FoxO1 was again clearly present in both α and β cells (Fig. 2, A and C).FIGURE 2Detection of FoxO1 immunoreactivity within pancreatic α and β cells.

Cells were preincubated for 30 min in media containing 0.5 mmol/liter glucose before stimulation with either insulin or glucose as shown (Fig. 3). After treatment with either 1, 5, or 17 nmol/liter insulin for 1 h we observed a significant change in the ratio of immunoreactivity in the cytosolic and nuclear regions of the cell, as quantified by measuring the average intensities of individual pixels. For these measurements, both the total cellular area and nuclear areas were counted with the difference between these two values revealing the cytosolic component. Insulin increased the ratio of cytosolic:nuclear fluorescence from 15.79 ± 9.6 to 23.47 ± 10.45% and 75.59 ± 10.43% (Fig. 3, A, B, D, and I; p < 0.005 in each case; numbers of cells are given in the legend) at 1 and 17 nmol/liter, respectively. Incubation with 5 nmol/liter insulin led to an almost equal distribution in nuclear and cytosolic regions (Fig. 3C). Upon stimulation with either 10 or 30 mmol/liter glucose, no change in the ratio of the immunoreactivity in the cytosolic:nuclear compartments was apparent (Fig. 3, E, F, G, and J).FIGURE 3Effects of insulin on the subcellular distribution of endogenous FoxO1 within αTC1-9 cells. A, αTC1-9 cells were preincubated in 0.5 mmol/liter glucose for 6 h and then with 0.5 mmol/liter glucose for 1 h. Nuclear regions were stained with DAPI, and endogenous FoxO1 was detected using an anti-FoxO1 antibody and confocal microscopy. B-D, αTC1-9 cells were preincubated in 0.5 mmol/liter glucose for 6 h before treatment with either 1, 5, or 17 nmol/liter insulin for 1 h as shown. Nuclear regions and endogenous FoxO1 was then detected as above. E, F, and G, αTC1-9 cells were preincubated in 0.5 mmol/liter glucose for 6 h and then incubated in either 0.5, 10, or 30 mmol/liter glucose, respectively, for 1 h before FoxO1 was detected as before. H, cells were fixed in the absence of an anti-FoxO1 antibody (Ab). I, subcellular translocation of endogenous FoxO1 in response to insulin was quantified by Volocity™ software, comparing the nuclear (nu, open bars) and cytoplasmic (cy, closed bars) regions. J, movement of endogenous FoxO1 in response to glucose was quantified as above.

Immunocytochemistry was initially used to quantify FoxO1 levels in cells treated with either a scrambled (sc) or small interfering (si) RNA duplexes. To account for potential off-target effects, the impact of one scRNA and two siRNA duplexes, named si#1 and si#2, was examined (Fig. 4, A-C, respectively). For control purposes, incubations in the absence of primary antibody were also included (Fig. 4D), and nuclei were stained with DAPI. Immunoreactivity, quantified as above (Fig. 4E), was decreased by 74.3 ± 2.08% in si#1-transfected cells versus scRNA-transfected cells, whereas there was a 90 ± 2.4% decrease in si#2-transfected cells (p < 0.05, n = 3 separate experiments). The extent of silencing was further examined by Western (immuno-) blotting of cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts from transfected αTC1-9 cells (Fig. 4F). This approach further confirmed the decrease in FoxO1 protein levels in siRNA-transfected compared with scRNA-transfected cells. Demonstrating the likely selectivity for FoxO1 knockdown in each case, immunoreactivity of ERK1/2 was unaffected by any of the above siRNAs (data not shown).FIGURE 4Silencing of FoxO1 expression in αTC1-9 cells. Cells were transfected with either a scRNA or one of two siRNA duplexes, named si#1 and si#2, for 48 h before FoxO1 detection (see “Results”).

A, nuclear staining by DAPI of αTC1-9 cells transfected with a scrambled duplex and immunocytochemical analysis of FoxO1 levels visualized using an anti-FoxO1 antibody. B, DAPI and FoxO1 levels within αTC1-9 cells expressing an anti-FoxO1 siRNA duplex (si#1) were detected as before. C, DAPI nuclear staining and FoxO1 immunostaining of αTC1-9 cells transfected with an anti-FoxO1 siRNA (si#2) duplex. D, experiments in the absence of primary antibody (Ab) revealed that there was no leakage of fluorescence between excitation channels. E, ratio of mean pixel intensity quantification of αTC1-9 cells transfected with either a scrambled duplex or the anti-FoxO1 siRNA duplexes (si#1 and si#2, as stated).

https://openalex.org/W2085642863,"Brain capillary endothelial cells (BCECs) form the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which is essential for maintaining homeostasis of the brain. Net cellular turnover, which results from the balance between cell death and proliferation, is important in maintaining BBB homeostasis. Here we report a novel mechanism that underlies ATP-induced cell proliferation in t-BBEC 117, a cell line derived from bovine brain endothelial cells. Application of 0.1-30 μm ATP to t-BBEC 117 concentration-dependently increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in two phases: an initial transient phase and a later and smaller sustained one. These two phases of [Ca2+]i rise were mainly due to Ca2+ release and sustained Ca2+ influx, respectively. The pretreatment with apamin, a selective blocker of small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (SK), significantly reduced both the [Ca2+]i increase and K+ current induced by ATP. Transcripts corresponding to P2Yx, SK2, and transient receptor potential channels were detected in t-BBEC 117. Knock down of SK2 protein, which was the predominant Ca2+-activated K+ channel expressed in t-BBEC 117, by siRNA significantly reduced both the sustained phase of the [Ca2+]i rise and the K+ current induced by ATP. Cell proliferation was increased significantly by the presence of the stable ATP analogue ATPγS. This effect was blunted by UCL1684, a synthesized SK blocker. In conclusion, in brain endothelial cells ATP-induced [Ca2+]i rise activates SK2 current, and the subsequent membrane hyperpolarization enhances Ca2+ entry presumably through transient receptor potential channels. This positive feedback mechanism can account for the augmented cell proliferation by ATP. Brain capillary endothelial cells (BCECs) form the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which is essential for maintaining homeostasis of the brain. Net cellular turnover, which results from the balance between cell death and proliferation, is important in maintaining BBB homeostasis. Here we report a novel mechanism that underlies ATP-induced cell proliferation in t-BBEC 117, a cell line derived from bovine brain endothelial cells. Application of 0.1-30 μm ATP to t-BBEC 117 concentration-dependently increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in two phases: an initial transient phase and a later and smaller sustained one. These two phases of [Ca2+]i rise were mainly due to Ca2+ release and sustained Ca2+ influx, respectively. The pretreatment with apamin, a selective blocker of small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (SK), significantly reduced both the [Ca2+]i increase and K+ current induced by ATP. Transcripts corresponding to P2Yx, SK2, and transient receptor potential channels were detected in t-BBEC 117. Knock down of SK2 protein, which was the predominant Ca2+-activated K+ channel expressed in t-BBEC 117, by siRNA significantly reduced both the sustained phase of the [Ca2+]i rise and the K+ current induced by ATP. Cell proliferation was increased significantly by the presence of the stable ATP analogue ATPγS. This effect was blunted by UCL1684, a synthesized SK blocker. In conclusion, in brain endothelial cells ATP-induced [Ca2+]i rise activates SK2 current, and the subsequent membrane hyperpolarization enhances Ca2+ entry presumably through transient receptor potential channels. This positive feedback mechanism can account for the augmented cell proliferation by ATP.

Brain capillary endothelial cells (BCECs) form the BBB whose functional characteristics include the presence of intercellular tight junctions and a relating low transcellular vesicular transport induced by surrounding astrocytes (1Abbott N.J. J. Anat. 2002; 200: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). In the BBB cell homeostasis requires a delicate balance between formation of new cells by proliferation and their elimination by cell death. Cell proliferation is stimulated by ATP in a variety of cells (2Lee W.K. Choi S.W. Lee H.R. Lee E.J. Lee K.H. Kim H.O. J. Dermatol Sci. 2001; 25: 97-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 3Franke H. Illes P. Pharmacol. Ther. 2006; 109: 297-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). There is a line of evidence for a critical role of intracellular Ca2+ activity in the regulation of cell proliferation (4Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar, 6Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4396) Google Scholar). ATP is known to increase intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) via activation of metabotropic P2Y receptors (7King B.F. Townsend-Nicholson A. Burnstock G. Trends Pharmacol Sci. 1998; 19: 506-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), which in turn can trigger Ca2+ entry (8Bahra P. Mesher J. Li S. Poll C.T. Danahay H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 143: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A variety of K+ channels have also been implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation (9Lang F. Foller M. Lang K.S.

In peripheral endothelial cells, ion channels such as Ca2+-activaed K+ channels (KCa) (10Muraki K. Imaizumi Y. Ohya S. Sato K. Takii T. Onozaki K. Watanabe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 11Sollini M. Frieden M. Beny J.L. Br. J.

Physiol. 2001; 537: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 15Antoniotti S. Lovisolo D. Fiorio Pla A. Munaron L. FEBS Lett. 2002; 510: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) have been reported to be present, and some of their functions have been identified. In contrast, electrophysiological characteristics, including ion channel expression and their functions in BCECs, have not been studied extensively. Only the accumulation of information about transporters such as P-glycoprotein in BCECs has been recently well accelerated (16Hosoya K. Ohtsuki S. Terasaki T. Int. J. Pharm. 2002; 248: 15-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Experimental difficulties in preparing freshly isolated BCECs and identifying BCECs among various types of cell are major reasons why the electrophysiology of BCECs using single cell preparation and patch clamp methods has progressed rather slowly, despite its importance (17Abbott N.J. Ronnback L. Hansson E. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (3689) Google Scholar). In this study, we have used t-BBEC 117, an immortalized bovine BCEC line, which was established by transfection of SV40 large T antigen and then by isolating a single clone. In vitro culture of these cells has been accomplished, and the BBB phenotypes have been confirmed based on the following criteria: (i) spindle-shape morphology, (ii) rapid uptake of acetylated-LDL, (iii) formation of tight junction-like structures, (iv) high alkaline phosphatase activity, and (v) expression of multidrug resistance and glucose transporter-1 mRNA (18Sobue K. Yamamoto N. Yoneda K. Hodgson M.E. Yamashiro K. Tsuruoka N. Tsuda T. Katsuya H. Miura Y. Asai K. Kato T. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 35: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). We have analyzed the functional and molecular expression of ion channels and purinoceptors in t-BBEC 117. Our findings revealed a novel mechanism of positive feedback in the regulation of [Ca2+]i by ATP. This involves the activation of two types of ion channels, Ca2+-activated K+ channels (KCas) and Ca2+-permeable channels, which are, presumably, TRP channels. We therefore postulate that ATP, which is released into in the cleft between BCEC and astrocytes, regulates and sustains cell proliferation of BCECs by the positive feedback mechanism. Cell Cultures—An immortalized endothelial cell line, t-BBEC 117, was established from primary cultured bovine brain endothelial cells, using the transfection of SV40 large T antigen expressing vector as described previously (18Sobue K. Yamamoto N. Yoneda K. Hodgson M.E. Yamashiro K. Tsuruoka N. Tsuda T. Katsuya H. Miura Y. Asai K. Kato T. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 35: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). t-BBEC 117 were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in low glucose (1000 mg/liter) Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin (Meiji Seika Kaisha, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), and 0.2 mg/ml streptomycin (Meiji Seika Kaisha, Ltd.). RT-PCR—Total RNA was prepared using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription (RT) was carried out using random hexamers and SuperScript II RNase H- reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The resultant cDNA was subjected to PCR-based amplification. Our oligonucleotide primers for the K+ channels and β-actin, and for the purinoceptors, are shown in supplemental Tables S1 and S2, respectively. The reactions for K+ channels and β-actin contained 1 μl of RT reaction product as template DNA and were carried out for 35 cycles, using a 95 °C, 45-s denaturing step; a 56 °C, 30-s annealing step; and a 72 °C, 60-s extension step. The reaction for purinoceptors contained 1 μl of RT reaction product as template DNA and was carried out for 35 cycles, using a 95 °C, 15-s denaturing step and a 60 °C, 60-s annealing and extension step. The PCR products were visualized by ethydium bromide staining following separation on 2% agarose gels. Amplified products were sequenced using BigDye terminator v3 kit (Applied Biosystems) with an ABI PRIZM 3100 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Western Blot Analysis—Cells cultured under the specified conditions were harvested into Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged for 10 min at 800 × g at 4 °C. Cell pellets were suspended in 100 μl of Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl) containing 100 μm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm pepstatin A, 10 μm leupeptin, 2 mm EDTA. The quantity of protein was measured using a BCA protein assay regent kit (Pierce). 30-μg aliquots from protein sample were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a Clear Blot Membrane-P (ATTO, Tokyo, Japan). The membrane filters were blocked for 1 h with 5% skim milk in TBS-T (20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following antisera: SK1 (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), SK2 (1:500, Alomone Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel), or SK3 (1:200, Alomone Laboratories). After washing the membranes for 15 min with TBS-T, they were incubated for 1 h with anti-rabbit IgG (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp.,) or anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) coupled to horseradish peroxidase diluted 1:4000 in TBS-T. Bands were visualized using an ECL detection system (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp.). Measurement of [Ca2+]i—t-BBEC 117 was incubated with 10 μm fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (Fura-2 AM, Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) in normal HEPES solution for 30 min at room temperature. Fura-2 fluorescent signals was measured using the ARUGAS/HiSCA imaging system (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan). The frequency of image acquisition was selected to be one image every ∼1 s for [Ca2+]i measurement. In some experiments, the ratios of fluorescence intensity were transformed into [Ca2+]i using Equation 1, [Ca2+]i=224·B·((R-Rmin)/(Rmax-R)),(Eq. 1) where R is the fluorescence ratio 340 nm/380 nm, Rmin and Rmax are the fluorescence ratios determined by addition of 1 mm EGTA and 2.2 mm Ca2+, respectively, after the permeabilization of cells with 10 μm ionomycin, and B is the averaged fluorescence proportionality coefficients obtained at 380 nm under Rmin and Rmax conditions. Electrophysiological Recordings—Whole cell membrane currents were applied to single t-BBEC 117 with patch pipettes using a CEZ-2400 (Nihon Koden, Tokyo, Japan) amplifier. The resistance of microelectrodes filled with pipette solution was ∼3-5 MΩ. Membrane currents were stored and analyzed as described previously (10Muraki K. Imaizumi Y. Ohya S. Sato K. Takii T. Onozaki K. Watanabe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 19Imaizumi Y. Muraki K. Watanabe M. J. Physiol. 1989; 411: 131-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, membrane currents were monitored on a storage oscilloscope (VC-6041, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) and stored on videotape after being digitized by a PCM-recording system (modified to acquire a DC signal, PCM 501ES, SONY, Tokyo, Japan). The data on the tape were later loaded into a computer (IBM-AT compatible) through an analog-digital converter (DT2801A; Data Translation, Marlboro, MA). Data acquisition and analysis for whole cell current were carried out using AQ/Cell-soft, developed in the laboratory of Dr. Wayne Giles (University of Calgary). In some experiments, ramp waveforms were applied as a voltage clamp command using a multipulse generator (FS-1915, NF Electronics, Tokyo, Japan). All currents recorded were filtered at 3 kHz (four-pole Bessel filter, NF Electronics). Membrane Potential Measurements Using a Voltage-sensitive Fluorescent Dye—The measurement of membrane potential changes by DiBAC4(3), which is a bisbarbituric acid oxonol dye with excitation maximal at ∼490 nm, was performed as described previously (20Yamada A. Gaja N. Ohya S. Muraki K. Narita H. Ohwada T. Imaizumi Y. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 86: 342-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Before the fluorescence measurements, cells were incubated with 100 nm DiBAC4(3) in HEPES-buffered solution for 30 min at room temperature. Experiments were carried out in the constant presence of DiBAC4(3). Hyperpolarization results in the extrusion of the dye from cells and a subsequent decrease in fluorescence intensity. The decrease in fluorescence intensity by 1% corresponded to ∼0.5 mV hyperpolarization in the membrane potential range of 20 and 70 mV (20Yamada A. Gaja N. Ohya S. Muraki K. Narita H. Ohwada T. Imaizumi Y. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 86: 342-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Data collection and analyses were performed using ARGUS-HiSCA. The sampling interval of DiBAC4(3) fluorescence measurements was 5 s. Specific Knockdown of SK2 by RNA Interference—The sequences of short interference RNA (siRNA) used in this study, selected according to the criteria suggested previously (21Elbashi R.S.M. Harbort H.J. Webe R.K. Tusch L.T. Methods. 2002; 26: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar), were as follows: 5′-GGUACCAUGAUCAACAGGATT-3′ for sense strand, and 5′-GCAUACGACUUCAGAGGAATT-3′ for antisense strand. These oligonucleotides were annealed and labeled by Cy5. The siRNA target site for SK2 was 5′-GGUACCAUGAUCAACAGGA-3′ (nucleotides 1004-1022). The cells in a 35-mm dish were washed with 2 ml of the fresh culture medium 30 min prior to transfection. 25 μl of siRNA solution (1 μm) and 5 μl of LipofectAMINE2000 (Invitrogen) were each mixed with 250 μl of Opti-MEM. The two mixtures were combined and incubated for 20 min at room temperature for complex formation. The entire mixture was added to the cells, resulting in a final concentration of 10 nm for the siRNA. The cells were incubated for 5-8 h in a CO2 chamber, washed once, and supplied with 2 ml of the fresh culture medium. MTT Assay—Cell viability was monitored by the colorimetric 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT, Sigma) assay as described (22Hansen M.B. Nielsen S.E. Berg K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 119: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (3329) Google Scholar). MTT was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline at 5 mg/ml and filtered to sterilize and remove a small amount of insoluble residue present in some batches of MTT. Cells (4 × 103 cells/well) were seeded onto 96-well plates and incubated with test substances for a selected time at 37 °C in 5% CO2. At the time points indicated, stock MTT solution (10 μl per 100-μl medium) was added to all wells of an assay plate, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. After 4 h, 20% w/v SDS (50% N,N-dimethyl formamide and demineralized water) was added to all wells, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 6-8 h. These plates were then analyzed following absorption on a Multiscan JX (Ver1.1 system; Thermo Labsystems), using a test wavelength of 595 nm and a reference wavelength of 650 nm. Unless specified in the text, no mixing was performed, and no medium was removed prior to the addition of any ingredient. [3H]Thymidine Incorporation—Cells (5 × 103 cells/well) were seeded onto 96-well plates and incubated with test substances for a selected period at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were labeled with 20 nCi/well of [3H]thymidine (24 h, 37 °C) and then trypsinized for isolation after the washout of 3H. Cells were harvested on glass fiber filters by using a multiple cell harvester (Labo mash). Filters were air-dried and placed in scintillation vials containing 2 ml of ACSII (GE Healthcare Bioscience) scintillation fluid. The cell-associated 3H radioactivity was determined on a model 5801 liquid scintillation counter (Beckman). Solutions—For electrophysiology bath solutions, we used normal HEPES solution, of the following composition, in mm: NaCl 137, KCl 5.9, CaCl2 2.2, MgCl2 1.2, glucose 14, HEPES 10, NaOH to pH 7.4. For Ca2+ imaging, we used normal HEPES solution and Ca2+-free HEPES solution, of the following composition, in mm: NaCl 137, KCl 5.9, MgCl2 1.2, glucose 14, HEPES 10, EGTA 5, NaOH to pH 7.4. For DiBAC4(3) fluorescence imaging, we used 140 mm K+ solution, of the following composition, in mm: NaCl 2.9, KCl 140, CaCl2 2.2, MgCl2 1.2, glucose 14, HEPES 10, NaOH to pH 7.4. All whole cell patch clamp pipettes contained, in mm: KCl 140, MgCl2 4, ATP-Na2 5, EGTA 5, CaCl2 4.3, HEPES 10, KOH to pH7.2 (pCa 6.0) and KCl 22, potassium aspartate 118, MgCl2 4, ATP-Na2 5, EGTA 0.05, HEPES 10, KOH to pH 7.2. Statistics—Pooled data were expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was examined using the paired or unpaired Student's t test for two groups, respectively, and Scheffe's multiple comparisons for three groups. In all figures, * and #, and ** and ##, indicate statistical significance at p values of 0.05 and 0.01, respectively. Drugs and Chemical Agents—The following compounds were used in this study: apamin, ATP, UDP, ATPγS, thapsigargin, adenosine 3′-phosphate 5′-phosphosulfate (A3P5PS), UCL1684, U0126, Go6983, and PD98059 (Sigma); barium chloride (Ba2+) and lanthanum chloride (La3+) (Wako, Osaka, Japan); DCEBIO (Tocris); UTP (Yamasa shouyu, Chiba, Tokyo); ADP (Oriental Yeast Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan); SK&F 96365 (Funakoshi, Tokyo, Japan); and l-NAME (Dojindo, Osaka, Japan). The solvents (distilled water and Me2SO) had no effect on [Ca2+]i, membrane current, and membrane potential, when the corresponding amount was applied by superfusion. Identification of Purinoceptor Subtypes in t-BBEC 117—Application of 10 μm ATP to t-BBEC 117 consistently resulted in a marked rise of [Ca2+]i (Fig. 1A, panel a). This ATP-induced [Ca2+]i rise (805.0 ± 102.2 nm in the control) was almost abolished by pretreatment with 5 μm thapsigargin (TG) (33.8 ± 7.9 nm), suggesting that it is due to Ca2+ release from intracellular storage sites (Fig. 1A, panels a and b). To determine subtype of purinoceptor expressed in t-BBEC 117, RT-PCR analysis was performed using primers for 16 subtypes of P2XR and P2YR. Transcripts of P2X1, P2X4, P2X6, P2X7, P2Y1, P2Y2, and P2Y12 were detected (Fig. 1B). Based on these results, the purinoceptor subtypes functionally expressed in t-BBEC 117 are considered to be P2Y1, P2Y2, and/or P2Y12, because P2YRs are known to couple with Gq/11 proteins and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate signal transduction pathways to induce Ca2+ release from endoplasmic reticulum. β-actin primers were used to confirm that the products generated were representative of RNA (542 bp) and not contaminated with genomic DNA (intron containing 767-bp band), because these primers were designed to span an intron as well as three exons (data not shown). To examine further the subtypes of purinoceptor in t-BBEC 117, the potency of P2R agonists in eliciting these [Ca2+]i responses were compared. ATP, ADP, UTP, UDP, and ATPγS at concentrations from 0.1 to 100 μm were applied consecutively. The dose-response curves are shown in Fig. 1C. The 50% effective concentrations (EC50) were (in μm); ATP: 3.0 ± 0.7, ADP: 0.82 ± 0.03, UTP: 0.93 ± 0.05, UDP: 36.5 ± 1.67, and ATPγS: 6.2 ± 0.4. The order of the potency was: ADP = UTP > ATP > ATPγS > UDP. This pattern of results suggests the involvement of P2YR in this response (7King B.F. Townsend-Nicholson A. Burnstock G. Trends Pharmacol Sci. 1998; 19: 506-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The contribution of P2Y1 for this Ca2+ response was examined using ADP and A3P5PS, because these compounds are specific agonist and antagonist for P2Y1, respectively (23Takasaki J. Kamohara M. Saito T. Matsumoto M. Matsumoto S. Ohishi T. Soga T. Matsushime H. Furuichi K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 432-439PubMed Google Scholar). The ADP-induced Ca2+ response was markedly suppressed by 10 μm A3P5PS (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these results strongly suggested that P2Y1 is mainly responsible for the [Ca2+]i response to ATP in t-BBEC 117. Involvement of SK Channel Activation in Ca2+ Entry following ATP-evoked Ca2+ Release—It has been reported that a [Ca2+]i rise via metabotropic P2Y receptors can trigger additional Ca2+ entry in airway epithelium (8Bahra P. Mesher J. Li S. Poll C.T. Danahay H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 143: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We examined this possibility in t-BBEC 117. The ATP-induced [Ca2+]i rise occurred in two distinct phases, an initial transient phase and a smaller sustained phase (Fig. 2A, panel a). When Ca2+ was omitted from the extracellular solution, only the transient [Ca2+]i rise remained (Fig. 2A, panel b). Summarized data (Fig. 2A, panel c) are presented as the percentage of integrated [Ca2+]i rise in the second application of ATP versus that in the first one. Note that the second Ca2+ rise was significantly reduced from 58.5 ± 1.6% (n = 106) to 28.9 ± 1.1% (n = 86, p < 0.01), in Ca2+-free solution. Next, the susceptibility of the ATP-induced [Ca2+]i rise to blockers of cation channels was examined (Fig. 2B, panel a). The addition of 10 μm lanthanum (La3+) or 10 μm gadolinium (Gd3+) markedly reduced the integrated [Ca2+]i signal, but 10 μm SK&F96365 did not change this. These results suggest that [Ca2+]i rise triggered by stimulation of P2Y in t-BBEC 117 consists of two components, the Ca2+ release mainly in the initial transient phase and the Ca2+ entry mainly in the sustained phase. The Ca2+ entry through cation channels, presumably TRP channels, is often not voltage-dependent. Instead it is driven by membrane potential gradient (24Nilius B. Droogmans G. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1415-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Accordingly a membrane hyperpolarization by activation of K+ channel can enhance Ca2+ entry through non-voltage-dependent cation channels (24Nilius B. Droogmans G. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1415-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). To examine the possibility that the Ca2+ rise due to the initial release activates Ca2+-activated K+ (KCa) channels, these effects of specific blockers of KCa on the [Ca2+]i were examined. Iberiotoxin and TRAM-34, selective blockers of large and intermediate conductance KCa (BK and IK) channels, respectively, were not effective (not shown). In contrast apamin, a blocker of small conductance KCa (SK) channels significantly reduced the [Ca2+]i rise (Fig. 2C). Apamin significantly reduced the relative value of [Ca2+]i from 58.5 ± 1.6% to 31.0 ± 1.2%. These important new findings suggest the possibility that the activation of SK2 can enhance Ca2+ entry and form part of a positive feedback mechanism for the regulation of [Ca2+]i in t-BBEC 117. Activation of SK2 Current by Stimulation of P2YRs—To directly demonstrate that the [Ca2+]i rise can activate SK channels, ATP-induced membrane currents in t-BBEC 117 were analyzed under whole cell voltage clamp. Ramp voltage clamp waveform from -120 to +60 mV (0.72 V/s) were applied once every 10 s from a holding potential of -40 mV. Fig. 3A (panel a) shows the time course of changes in membrane current amplitude at -120 mV. Application of 10 μm ATP transiently increased the inward current at -120 mV, and pretreatment with 10 nm apamin strikingly reduced the amplitude of this ATP-induced current. Fig. 3A (panel b) shows current-voltage (I-V) relationships of ATP-activated current component. These were obtained by subtracting the I-V relationships before the application of ATP from those after ATP application, in the absence (gray) and presence of apamin (black), respectively. The reversal potentials of ATP-activated current in the absence and presence of apamin were -28.2 ± 4.3 and -3.6 ± 2.8 mV, respectively (n = 6, p < 0.01). It is notable that the addition of apamin shifted the apparent reversal potential to the positive direction by ∼25 mV. The relationship between current density and voltage of the current component, which was ATP-activated and apamin-sensitive, is shown in Fig. 3A (panel c). The reversal potential was -61.5 ± 9.2 mV (n = 6), indicating the component is K+ current. The activation of SK channels by an ATP-induced [Ca2+]i increase would be expected to result in membrane hyperpolarization. In the next series of experiments, membrane potential changes induced by ATP were measured from mass of t-BBEC 117 using voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, DiBAC4(3). In Fig. 3B (panel a) changes in fluorescence intensity ratio to that at time 0 in t-BBEC 117 are shown. Application of 10 μm ATP induced a decrease in the fluorescence ratio (F/F0), which corresponds to membrane hyperpolarization, and the addition of 100 nm apamin abolished the ATP-induced hyperpolarization. Fig. 3C shows the effect of DCEBIO, an opener of SK channels. Addition of 10 μm DCEBIO elicited membrane hyperpolarization, and this hyperpolarization was also blocked by 10 nm apamin. In combination, results clearly indicate that SK channels are functionally expressed in t-BBEC 117, and are activated by ATP-induced [Ca2+]i rise to elicit membrane hyperpolarization. Molecular Identification of SK2 Channel and Effects of SK2 Channel Knockdown by siRNA in t-BBEC 117—To identify the molecular basis of KCa channels in t-BBEC 117, mRNA expression of five types of KCa channel α-subunits; BK, SK1, SK2, SK3, and IK (SK4), were examined by RT-PCR. Expression of BK and IK were barely detectable (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the expression of SK1, SK2, and SK3 could be detected unambiguously. The sequence analysis of PCR products for SK1 and SK2 revealed that the sequences of bovine SK1 and SK2 are highly homologous to those of human and mouse, and variants with a 3-amino acid insertion were found both in SK1 and SK2 (data not shown). Those sequences were"

We previously showed that isoflurane, a commonly used anesthetic, enhanced the activity of EAAT3, a major neuronal EAAT. This effect required a protein kinase C (PKC) α-dependent EAAT3 redistribution to the plasma membrane. In this study, we prepared COS7 cells stably expressing EAAT3 with or without mutations of potential PKC phosphorylation sites in the putative intracellular domains. Here we report that mutation of threonine 5 or threonine 498 to alanine did not affect the isoflurane effects on EAAT3. However, the mutation of serine 465 to alanine abolished isoflurane-induced increase of EAAT3 activity and redistribution to the plasma membrane. The mutation of serine 465 to aspartic acid increased the expression of EAAT3 in the plasma membrane and also abolished the isoflurane effects on EAAT3. These results suggest an essential role of serine 465 in the isoflurane-increased EAAT3 activity and redistribution and a direct effect of PKC on EAAT3. Consistent with these results, isoflurane induced an increase in phosphorylation of wild type, T5A, and T498A EAAT3, and this increase was absent in S465A and S465D. Our current results, together with our previous data that showed the involvement of PKCα in the isoflurane effects on EAAT3, suggest that the phosphorylation of serine 465 in EAAT3 by PKCα mediates the increased EAAT3 activity and redistribution to plasma membrane after isoflurane exposure.

Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. Similar to the case with many other neurotransmitters, there is no extracellular enzyme known to metabolize glutamate. Glutamate transporters, also called excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs), 2The abbreviations used are: EAAT, excitatory amino acid transporter/glutamate transporter; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PKC, protein kinase C; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP. transport glutamate from extracellular space into cells (1Kanai Y. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar, 2Danbolt N.C. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 1-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3796) Google Scholar). Thus, EAATs play a critical role in securing a high signal-to-noise ratio in glutamate neurotransmission and in preventing harmful over-stimulation of glutamate receptors under physiological conditions (2Danbolt N.C. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 1-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3796) Google Scholar). Inhibition of EAATs has been shown to prolong the time course of glutamate neurotransmission (3Mennerick S. Zorumski C.F. Nature. 1994; 368: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), and decreased expression of EAATs is associated with neurodegeneration and increased infarct volume after brain ischemia (4Rothstein J.D. Dykes-Hoberg M. Pardo C.A. Bristol L.A. Jin L. Kuncl R.W. Kanai Y. Hediger M.A. Wang Y. Schielke J.P. Welty D.F. Neuron. 1996; 16: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2149) Google Scholar, 5Rao V.L. Dogan A. Todd K.G. Bowen K.K. Kim B.T. Rothstein J.D. Dempsey R.J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1876-1883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Five EAATs have been identified so far: EAAT1–5. They have about 520–580 amino acids. In rats, EAAT1 and EAAT2 are expressed in glial cells, EAAT3 and EAAT4 are found in neurons and EAAT5 is located in the neurons and glial cells of retina (2Danbolt N.C. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 1-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3796) Google Scholar). EAAT1, EAAT2, and EAAT3 are distributed in many brain regions including cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum, whereas EAAT4 is predominantly expressed in the cerebellum (6Danbolt N.C. Chaudhry F.A. Dehnes Y. Lehre K.P. Levy L.M. Ullensvang K. Storm-Mathisen J. Prog. Brain Res. 1998; 116: 23-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, EAAT3 is the major neuronal EAAT in the central nervous system. All five EAATs are sodium co-transporters and require potassium coupling to complete the transporting cycling (7Billups B. Rossi D. Oshima T. Warr O. Takahashi M. Sarantis M. Szatkowski M. Attwell D. Prog. Brain Res. 1998; 116: 45-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that isoflurane, a commonly used volatile anesthetic in clinical practice, increased EAAT3 activity (8Do S.H. Kamatchi G.L. Washington J.M. Zuo Z. Anesthesiology. 2002; 96: 1492-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 9Huang Y. Zuo Z. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1522-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This increased activity required EAAT3 redistribution to the plasma membrane. These isoflurane effects were protein kinase C (PKC) α-dependent. The phosphorylation of EAAT3 appeared to increase after being exposed to isoflurane (9Huang Y. Zuo Z. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1522-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesize that isoflurane-induced increase of EAAT3 activity and redistribution to the plasma membrane requires potential PKC phosphorylation sites in the EAAT3 molecule. To address this hypothesis, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of selective potential PKC phosphorylation sites and prepared cells stably expressing these mutants of EAAT3. Our results suggest that the serine 465 is essential for the isoflurane-increased EAAT3 activity and redistribution to the plasma membrane.

Preparation of COS7 Cells Stably Expressing EAAT3 or Its Mutants—As we described before (10Fang H. Huang Y. Zuo Z. Brain Res. 2002; 953: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), site-directed mutagenesis of EAAT3 was performed by using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit with a pair of 28-base primers containing the desired mutations. The mutations were confirmed by sequencing ∼500 bases that included the mutated sites. The wild type EAAT3 and EAAT3 mutants were inserted into the pIRES2-EGFP vector at the EcoRI and BamHI multiple cloning sites. This vector carries a kanamycin/neomycin resistance gene, a GFP gene and a cytomegalovirus promoter to control the expression of EAAT3. COS7 cells grown to 90% confluence in 6-well plates were transfected with 4 μg of vector containing EAAT3 DNA in the presence of 10 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 in 500 μl of Opti-MEM I medium for 24 h. Three days after the transfection, COS7 cells were incubated with G418 500 μg/ml for stringent selection. The surviving cells were subcultured in the presence of G418 500 μg/ml, and the expression of GFP in the cells was observed under a fluorescent microscope. The expression of GFP and EAAT3 in these cells was confirmed by Western analysis. Cell Culture—Rat C6 glioma cells that express endogenous EAAT3 were cultured in flasks in F-10 nutrient mixture (Ham's) containing 15% horse serum and 2.5% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a 95% air-5% CO2 incubator. When cells reached ∼80% confluence, the culture medium was replaced by a serum-free medium (F-10 mixture only) for 24 h before isoflurane incubation. COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. They were exposed to isoflurane when they were at ∼80% confluence and had been in the serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h. Isoflurane Incubation—C6 cells and COS7 cells were incubated with isoflurane in an open system as follows. Fresh serum-free medium (50–200 ml) that had been gassed with 95% air-5% CO2 through or not through an isoflurane vaporizer at a flow rate 3 liters/min for 20 min was added to the cells for 5 min at 37 °C. Preliminary experiments with gas chromatography showed that isoflurane concentrations in the medium reached equilibrium 5 min after the onset of gassing under the current experimental conditions. During the incubation the medium was continuously gassed with the carrier gases containing or not containing isoflurane to compensate for isoflurane loss from the solution to air. Biotinylation—Biotinylation of cell surface proteins was performed as we described previously (9Huang Y. Zuo Z. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1522-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). After incubation with or without isoflurane, cells that were grown in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks were rinsed twice with warm phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1 mm calcium and 1.0 mm magnesium (PBS-Ca/Mg). The cells were then incubated with 2 ml of biotin solution (sulfo-N-hydroxysulfosuccinimidobiotin, 1 mg/ml in PBS-Ca/Mg) for 20 min at 4 °C with gentle shaking. The biotinylation reaction was terminated by washing the cells three times with ice-cold PBS-Ca/Mg containing 100 mm glycine. After the cells were incubated in this wash solution for 45 min at 4 °C with gentle agitation, they were then lysed in 2 ml of lysis buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 250 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and 1 mm iodoacetamide for 1 h at 4°C with vigorous shaking. The total lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei and debris. The resulting supernatants were incubated with equal volumes of suspension of avidin-conjugated beads (600 μl of bead suspension to 600 μl of lysates) for 1 h at room temperature with occasional stirring. The mixture was then centrifuged at 16,500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. After being washed four times, each time with 1 ml of lysis buffer, the pellet that contained the biotinylated cell surface proteins was resuspended in 500 μl of Laemmli buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol for 30 min to dissolve the biotinylated proteins. The mixture was centrifuged at 16,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and this third supernatant was kept for Western blot as the biotinylated fraction. Western Blotting—After protein content in samples was quantitated by the Lowry assay using a protein assay kit, 25 μg of protein per lane were subjected to Western analysis as described before (11Zuo Z. Johns R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 12Huang Y. Zuo Z. Anesthesiology. 2003; 99: 1346-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins were separated with 10% SDS-PAGE and then were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The protein bands were probed with primary antibodies (polyclonal rabbit anti-EAAT3 at 0.5 μg/ml; polyclonal rabbit anti-GFP at 1:1000 dilution) and then a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:1000) and finally visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence method with multiple exposures of films due to the limited linear range of intensity produced by this method. Quantitative analysis of the protein bands was performed using an ImageQuant 5.0 GE Healthcare Densitometer (GE Healthcare, Sunnyvale, CA). The relationship between the protein band signal and exposure time of the heaviest band on the films was established. Protein bands on a film where the intensity of the heaviest band was still within the linear range were measured to generate the data reported here. Immunoprecipitation and Phosphoprotein Staining—As we described previously (9Huang Y. Zuo Z. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1522-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), C6 cells or COS7 cells cultured in 75-cm2 dishes were lysed in 2 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm NaCl, Halt phosphatase inhibitor mixture and complete protease inhibitors for 1 h at 4°C. The lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min to remove cell debris. The resulting supernatants were incubated overnight with 2 μg of affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit anti-EAAT3 antibody at 4 °C. The mixture was then incubated with 40 μl of protein A/G plus-agarose beads for 1 h at 4°C with gentle shaking. The sample was then centrifuged at 500 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. An aliquot of supernatant was saved for Western blot. The pellet containing bead-bound immune complexes was washed four times with the lysis buffer and the immune complexes were then eluted by incubation with 100 μl of Laemmli buffer at 90–95 °C for 5 min. Control experiments using beads alone or rabbit IgG to replace the rabbit anti-EAAT3 antibody were performed to show the specificity of the anti-EAAT3 antibody. The prepared immunoprecipitates were separated with 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were then stained with Pro-Q Diamond dye. The staining was visualized with a Typhoon 9400 Variable Mode Imager (Amersham Biosciences) at an excitation wavelength 546 nm and an emission wavelength 580 nm. This dye technology is very sensitive to stain phosphoserine-, phosphothreonine-, and phosphotyrosine-containing proteins. Glutamate Uptake Assay—As described before (12Huang Y. Zuo Z. Anesthesiology. 2003; 99: 1346-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 13Zuo Z. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 1077-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), C6 cells or COS7 cells grown in 25-cm2 flasks were washed twice with wash buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm Tris base, 2.5 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm K2HPO4, 10 mm dextrose, pH 7.2. They were then incubated with 10 μm l-[3H]glutamate in the wash buffer in the presence or absence of 2% isoflurane for 5 min at 37 °C. The incubation was terminated by removing the incubation buffer and washing the cells three times with ice-cold wash buffer. The cells were lysed with 0.2 m NaOH, and radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. Statistical Analysis—The intensity of EAAT3 protein bands in the isoflurane treatment groups and EAAT3 mutant groups was normalized to that of EAAT3 bands from cells expressing wild type EAAT3 under control condition. The band intensity of phosphoproteins corresponding to EAAT3 was first normalized to that of total EAAT3 bands on Western blot. The results were then normalized to that from cells expressing wild type EAAT3 under control condition. Results are means ± S.D. of the fold changes over the controls, with controls being set as 1. Results of glutamate uptake assay are means ± S.D. of the measured numbers in each sample. Statistical analysis was performed by unpaired t test or one-way analysis of variance followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls test for post hoc comparison as appropriate. A p < 0.05 was considered significant. As we reported before (9Huang Y. Zuo Z. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1522-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 12Huang Y. Zuo Z. Anesthesiology. 2003; 99: 1346-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the anti-EAAT3 antibody detected a protein band with a mobility corresponding to ∼60 kDa on SDS-PAGE in samples prepared from C6 cells and in COS7 cells transfected with EAAT3 DNA (Fig. 1). No protein band corresponding to EAAT3 was detected by the antibody in samples prepared from COS7 cells without transfection (data not shown). As predicted from the structure of the plasmid, the GFP and EAAT3 were not a fusion protein because no band was immunoreactive to both the anti-EAAT3 and anti-GFP antibodies in the Western analysis (data not shown). Consistent with our previous results (9Huang Y. Zuo Z. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1522-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), a 5-min exposure of C6 cells to 2% isoflurane induced EAAT3 redistribution to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1). This isoflurane-induced redistribution was reproducible with wild type EAAT3 transfected in COS7 cells. To determine the involvement of potential PKC phosphorylation sites in the isoflurane effects on EAAT3, we performed site-directed mutagenesis on selective residues. PKCs phosphorylate serine/threonine residues in motif having basic residues both N- and C-terminal to the phosphorylation sites (14Nishikawa K. Toker A. Johannes F.J. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 952-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). According to this principle, we identified the three best potential PKC phosphorylation sites in the putative cytoplasmic domains of rat EAAT3 based on the primary sequence (15Kanai Y. Bhide P.G. DiFiglia M. Hediger M.A. Neuroreport. 1995; 6: 2357-2362Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and potential secondary structure. These three sites were: threonine 5, serine 465, and threonine 498. We mutated these residues to alanine, which cannot be phosphorylated by PKC, or to aspartic acid, which mimics the acidic charge of a phosphate. The mutation of threonine 5 or threonine 498 to alanine did not affect the isoflurane-induced EAAT3 redistribution to the plasma membrane. However, the mutation of serine 465 to alanine abolished isoflurane-induced EAAT3 redistribution (Fig. 1). The mutation of serine 465 to aspartic acid increased the expression of EAAT3 in the plasma membrane, although the total amount of this EAAT3 mutant expressed in the COS7 cells was similar to that of wild type EAAT3 in the COS7 cells (Fig. 2). Isoflurane exposure did not induce a redistribution of S465D EAAT3 to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1). These results suggest that the phosphorylation of serine 465 is critical for the isoflurane-induced EAAT3 redistribution. We have shown previously that the isoflurane-induced increase in EAAT3 activity requires EAAT3 redistribution to the plasma membrane. Consistent with this notion, our glutamate transporter activity data from wild type and mutated EAAT3 (Fig. 3) mirrored the redistribution results, suggesting a critical role of serine 465 in isoflurane-induced increase of EAAT3 activity. Our previous results suggest that isoflurane increases EAAT3 phosphorylation (9Huang Y. Zuo Z. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1522-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, isoflurane increased the expression of phosphoproteins that had the same mobility as EAAT3 in the anti-EAAT3 antibody-prepared immunoprecipitates from C6 cells or COS7 cells transfected to express wild type EAAT3, T5A, and T498A EAAT3 (Fig. 4). However, this isoflurane-induced increase of phosphoprotein was attenuated when immunoprecipitates were prepared from COS7 cells transfected with S465A or S465D EAAT3 (Fig. 4). These results suggest that the phosphorylation of serine 465 contributes to the isoflurane-induced increase of EAAT3 phosphorylation. Some phosphorylation staining of EAAT3 in control cells was observed. The reasons for this staining are not known, but it may represent phosphorylation at sites other than threonine 5, threonine 498, and serine 465 by various protein kinases. Isoflurane has been a commonly used anesthetic for more than 20 years. However, its mechanism of action is not well defined. It has been proposed that anesthesia is induced by enhancing inhibitory neurotransmission and/or inhibiting excitatory neurotransmission (16Campagna J. Miller K. Forman S. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 2110-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Available data strongly support enhancement of the inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission in the anesthetic effects (17Mihic S.J. Ye Q. Wick M.J. Koltchine V.V. Krasowski M.D. Finn S.E. Mascia M.P. Valenzuela C.F. Hanson K.K. Greenblatt E.P. Harris R.A. Harrison N.L. Nature. 1997; 389: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar, 19Hodge C.W. Mehmert K.K. Kelley S.P. McMahon T. Haywood A. Olive M.F. Wang D. Sanchez-Perez A.M. Messing R.O. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 997-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). However, anesthetics also inhibit glutamate neurotransmission and inhibition of glutamate receptors reduces volatile anesthetic requirements to render animals immobile (16Campagna J. Miller K. Forman S. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 2110-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 20Sonner J.M. Antognini J.F. Dutton R.C. Flood P. Gray A.T. Harris R.A. Homanics G.E. Kendig J. Orser B. Raines D.E. Rampil I.J. Trudell J. Vissel B. Eger 2nd., E.I. Anesth. Analg. 2003; 97: 718-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Thus, the effect of anesthetics on glutamate neurotransmission also contributes to anesthesia mechanism. EAATs, via their glutamate transporting function, can regulate neurotransmission. Inhibition of EAAT activity prolonged glutamate-induced excitatory postsynaptic current (3Mennerick S. Zorumski C.F. Nature. 1994; 368: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Inhibition of neuronal EAAT also decreased the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic current via a reduced synthesis of GABA because glutamate taken up by EAATs is a substrate for GABA synthesis (21Matthews G. Diamond J.S. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2040-2048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Sepkuty J.P. Cohen A.S. Eccles C. Rafiq A. Behar K. Ganel R. Coulter D.A. Rothstein J.D. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6372-6379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous studies (8Do S.H. Kamatchi G.L. Washington J.M. Zuo Z. Anesthesiology. 2002; 96: 1492-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 9Huang Y. Zuo Z. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1522-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) showed that isoflurane as well as other volatile anesthetics halothane and sevoflurane increased activity of EAAT3, the major neuronal EAAT. Intrathecal injection of EAAT inhibitors in rats increased the concentration of isoflurane required to render immobility to these animals (23Cechova S. Zuo Z. Br. J. Anaesth. 2006; 97: 192-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, the effects of volatile anesthetics on EAAT activity may contribute to their anesthesia mechanisms. EAAT3 activity can be regulated by PKC. PKCα activation increased the EAAT3 activity and trafficking to the plasma membrane and PKCϵ activation increased EAAT3 activity without increased EAAT3 trafficking to the plasma membrane (24Gonzalez M.I. Kazanietz M.G. Robinson M.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Our previous study showed that the effects of isoflurane on EAAT3 were mediated by PKCα because isoflurane increased the EAAT3 activity and trafficking and PKCα down-regulation abolished the isoflurane-increased EAAT3 activity and trafficking (9Huang Y. Zuo Z. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1522-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To further understand the molecular basis for isoflurane regulation of EAAT3 activity, we mutated three potential PKC phosphorylation sites in EAAT3. Our results suggest that serine 465 plays a critical role in the isoflurane-induced increase in EAAT3 activity and in EAAT3 redistribution to the plasma membrane. These results, along with our previous results showing that the effects of isoflurane on EAAT3 activity and redistribution were PKCα-dependent (9Huang Y. Zuo Z. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1522-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), suggest that the phosphorylation of serine 465 by PKCα is essential for isoflurane to increase EAAT3 activity and redistribution to the plasma membrane. Since isoflurane was shown to increase the amount of PKCα in the EAAT3 complex (9Huang Y. Zuo Z. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1522-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), our results also suggest that the effects of PKCα on EAAT3 may be direct and not through other intermediate proteins. All mutants maintained glutamate transporting functions, suggesting that these mutations do not change the binding of EAAT3 to glutamate, sodium, or potassium. The increased membrane localization and basal transporting activity of S465D compared with wild type EAAT3 suggest that serine 465 plays an important role in controlling the distribution of EAAT3 between the plasma membrane and the intracellular space. A functional role of Ser-465 in EAAT3 has not been reported in the literature. However, a few studies have investigated other functional domains/sites in EAATs. Residues in C-terminal regions of EAATs contribute to substrate, inhibitor, and ion interactions (25Grunewald M. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9684-9689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 30Slotboom D.J. Sobczak I. Konings W.N. Lolkema J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14282-14287Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). For example, EAAT2 residues 396–400 are critical for its transporting function and are the primary sodium binding sites (28Zarbiv R. Grunewald M. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 273: 14231-14237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 29Zhang Y. Bendahan A. Zarbiv R. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The same residues are at positions 365–369 in EAAT3 (31Kanai Y. Hediger M.A. Bran D.W. Excitatory Amino Acids, Their Role in Neuroendocrine Function. CRC Press, New York1996: 102-131Google Scholar); however, the role of these residues in EAAT3 transporting functions has not been studied. It has been shown that arginine 445 controls the coupling between glutamate and cations in EAAT3 (32Borre L. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2513-2519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a PKC activator, has been shown to regulate the cell surface expression and activity of EAAT2 and EAAT3 but in apparent opposite directions: PMA increased the cell surface expression and activity of EAAT3 (8Do S.H. Kamatchi G.L. Washington J.M. Zuo Z. Anesthesiology. 2002; 96: 1492-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 9Huang Y. Zuo Z. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1522-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 33Davis K.E. Straff D.J. Weinstein E.A. Bannerman P.G. Correale D.M. Rothstein J.D. Robinson M.B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2475-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and decreased the cell surface expression and activity of EAAT2 (10Fang H. Huang Y. Zuo Z. Brain Res. 2002; 953: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 34Kalandadze A. Wu Y. Robinson M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45741-45750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The regulation of EAAT2 by PMA was mediated by a domain at residues 475–517. Mutation of all five serine residues simultaneously or Ser-486 singly to alanine in this domain partially reversed the PMA effect (34Kalandadze A. Wu Y. Robinson M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45741-45750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). A corresponding domain in EAAT3 at residues 444–486 differs from the EAAT2 domain in 24 out of 43 amino acids. However, the role of this corresponding domain in PKC activation-induced EAAT3 redistribution to the plasma membrane could not be studied because the specific chimeras were not functional (34Kalandadze A. Wu Y. Robinson M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45741-45750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis revealed that, except for Ser-465 that is found to mediate the isoflurane effects on EAAT3 in our study, the EAAT3 domain lacks the other 4 serine residues contained in the EAAT2 domain (15Kanai Y. Bhide P.G. DiFiglia M. Hediger M.A. Neuroreport. 1995; 6: 2357-2362Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 35Pines G. Danbolt N.C. Bjoras M. Zhang Y. Bendahan A. Eide L. Koepsell H. Storm-Mathisen J. Seeberg E. Kanner B.I. Nature. 1992; 360: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). A serine residue corresponding to the Ser-465 in EAAT3 exists in the other four EAATs as well. However, the Ser-465 in EAAT3 may be a better potential PKC phosphorylation site because it has a basic residue at both the N and C termini, and the serine residue in the other four EAATs has a basic residue only at the C terminus (15Kanai Y. Bhide P.G. DiFiglia M. Hediger M.A. Neuroreport. 1995; 6: 2357-2362Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 35Pines G. Danbolt N.C. Bjoras M. Zhang Y. Bendahan A. Eide L. Koepsell H. Storm-Mathisen J. Seeberg E. Kanner B.I. Nature. 1992; 360: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar, 39Fang H. Huang Y. Zuo Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: C1334-C1340Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Mutation of the corresponding serine residue in EAAT2 (Ser-496) to alanine did not change the PMA effect on EAAT2 (34Kalandadze A. Wu Y. Robinson M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45741-45750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We showed that isoflurane did not affect EAAT2 activity (10Fang H. Huang Y. Zuo Z. Brain Res. 2002; 953: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, phosphorylation of Ser-465 in EAAT3 may explain the specificity of isoflurane effects on this EAAT. In a recent study, a short EAAT3 motif, 502YVN504, was found to be necessary for platelet-derived growth factor-induced EAAT3 trafficking to the plasma membrane. This motif also contributed to PMA-induced EAAT3 trafficking. However, the Tyr residue in this motif was not phosphorylated under control and platelet-derived growth factor treatment conditions. Thus, the authors concluded that phosphorylation of Tyr in the motif was not a necessary step for EAAT3 trafficking induced by platelet-derived growth factor (40Sheldon A.L. Gonzalez M.I. Robinson M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4876-4886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The PMA-induced increase in EAAT3 surface expression may be mediated by increased delivery of EAAT3 and/or reduced internalization of EAAT3. Our results suggest that EAAT3 phosphorylation is involved in these processes. However, very little is known about the molecules involved in the cycling of neurotransmitter transporters and no study identifying the molecules required for EAAT cycling has been reported. Evidence has suggested that synataxin 1A may be required for delivery of the GABA transporter 1, serotonin transporters, and glycine transporters 1 and 2 to the plasma membrane (41Horton N. Quick M.W. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 43Geerlings A. Nunez E. Lopez-Corcuera B. Aragon C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17584-17590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and that clathrin may be involved in the internalization of GABA transporter 1 (44Deken S.L. Wang D. Quick M.W. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1563-1568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biogenic amine transporters can be phosphorylated and the phosphorylation of transporters can change the functions of transporters (45Law R.M. Stafford A. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23986-23991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 46Ramamoorthy S. Giovanetti E. Qian Y. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2458-2466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). For example, phosphorylation at tyrosine 5 increased the transport function of the GABA transporter GAT1 (45Law R.M. Stafford A. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23986-23991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Future studies could be designed to identify which molecules may be involved in the EAAT cycling and how the phosphorylation of EAAT3 changes the interaction of EAAT3 with these molecules to change the dynamics of EAAT3 cycling. Collectively, our studies suggest that isoflurane activates PKCα (9Huang Y. Zuo Z. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1522-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), which selectively phosphorylates EAAT3 at Ser-465 leading to EAAT3 translocation to the plasma membrane. PKCα also can induce AMPA receptor internalization (47Perez J. Khatri L. Chang C. Srivastava S. Osten P. Ziff E. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5417-5428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a process that is involved in synaptic plasticity (48Malinow R. Malenka R. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 25: 103-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (2076) Google Scholar). Since PKCα is implicated in the trafficking of both EAAT3 and AMPA receptors and isoflurane can affect synaptic plasticity (49Simon W. Hapfelmeier G. Kochs E. Zieglgansberger W. Rammes G. Anesthesiology. 2001; 94: 1058-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), it is possible that PKCα-mediated EAAT3 trafficking, too, have a role in synaptic plasticity. Consistent with this possibility, an earlier study showed that long term potentiation and contextual fear conditioning increased EAAT3 activity and trafficking to plasma membrane (50Levenson J. Weeber E. Selcher J.C. Kategaya L.S. Sweatt J.D. Eskin A. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Thus, our current results may be relevant to understanding the mechanisms of isoflurane-induced change of synaptic plasticity as well as isoflurane-induced anesthesia."
https://openalex.org/W2004715054,"Disabled1 (DAB1) is an intracellular mediator of the Reelin-signaling pathway and essential for correct neuronal positioning during brain development. So far, DAB1 has been considered a cytoplasmic protein. Here, we show that DAB1 is subject to nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. In its steady state, DAB1 is mainly located in the cytoplasm. However, treatment with leptomycine B, a specific inhibitor of the CRM1 (chromosomal region maintenance 1)-RanGTP-dependent nuclear export, resulted in nuclear accumulation of DAB1. By using deletion or substitutional mutants of DAB1 fused with enhanced green fluorescent protein, we have mapped a bipartite nuclear localization signal and two CRM1-dependent nuclear export signals. These targeting signals were functional in both Neuro2a cells and primary cerebral cortical neurons. Using purified recombinant proteins, we have shown that CRM1 binds to DAB1 directly in a RanGTP-dependent manner. We also show that tyrosine phosphorylation of DAB1, which is indispensable for the layer formation of the brain, by Fyn tyrosine kinase or Reelin stimulation did not affect the subcellular localization of DAB1 in vitro. These results suggest that DAB1 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein and raise the possibility that DAB1 plays a role in the nucleus as well as in the cytoplasm.

The mammalian cerebral cortex is composed of six layers of various types of neurons having different birth dates, and the layer structure is essential for correct functioning of the central nervous system. This laminar construction is achieved by orchestrated migration of an appropriate number and type of neurons at appropriate timing, because neurons are produced within places different from where they finally reside. The proper migration and positioning of neurons in the cerebral cortex depends on various signaling pathways (1Gupta A. Tsai L.H. Wynshaw-Boris A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 342-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 3Bielas S. Higginbotham H. Koizumi H. Tanaka T. Gleeson J.G. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 593-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Among them, the Reelin-signaling pathway is significantly important for neuronal positioning in the developing brain (4Rice D.S. Curran T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1005-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 5Tissir F. Goffinet A.M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 496-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Reelin is a large glycoprotein secreted by neuronal populations that occupy the most superficial layer of the brain, particularly Cajal-Retzius cells (6Ogawa M. Miyata T. Nakajima K. Yagyu K. Seike M. Ikenaka K. Yamamoto H. Mikoshiba K. Neuron. 1995; 14: 899-912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar, 7Nakajima K. Mikoshiba K. Miyata T. Kudo C. Ogawa M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8196-8201Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Mice with mutation in the reelin gene (reeler) show severe disruption of the laminar structure in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, and several subcortical structures (8D'Arcangelo G. Miao G.G. Chen S.C. Soares H.D. Morgan J.I. Curran T. Nature. 1995; 374: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar, 9Hirotsune S. Takahara T. Sasaki N. Hirose K. Yoshiki A. Ohashi T. Kusakabe M. Murakami Y. Muramatsu M. Watanabe S. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Transmission of the Reelin signal to the migrating neurons requires the binding of Reelin to the very low density lipoprotein receptor and apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (10Trommsdorff M. Gotthardt M. Hiesberger T. Shelton J. Stockinger W. Nimpf J. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Herz J. Cell. 1999; 97: 689-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar, 12Hiesberger T. Trommsdorff M. Howell B.W. Goffinet A. Mumby M.C. Cooper J.A. Herz J. Neuron. 1999; 24: 481-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Binding of Reelin to the receptors induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic protein DAB1 (Disabled1) (12Hiesberger T. Trommsdorff M. Howell B.W. Goffinet A. Mumby M.C. Cooper J.A. Herz J. Neuron. 1999; 24: 481-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 13Howell B.W. Herrick T.M. Cooper J.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). DAB1 contains a motif known as a protein interaction/phosphotyrosine-binding domain (14Howell B.W. Gertler F.B. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), which enables DAB1 to bind the cytoplasmic tail of both very low density lipoprotein receptor and apolipoprotein E receptor 2. dab1-deficient mice exhibit behavioral and anatomical abnormalities that are indistinguishable from those of reeler (15Sheldon M. Rice D.S. D'Arcangelo G. Yoneshima H. Nakajima K. Mikoshiba K. Howell B.W. Cooper J.A. Goldowitz D. Curran T. Nature. 1997; 389: 730-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 18Kojima T. Nakajima K. Mikoshiba K. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 75: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Moreover, dab1 knock-in mice, which have point mutations in DAB1 so that they cannot be phosphorylated by Reelin stimulation, show a very similar phenotype to that of dab1-null mice (19Howell B.W. Herrick T.M. Hildebrand J.D. Zhang Y. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 877-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is thought that the tyrosine phosphorylation of DAB1 is essential for the activation of the downstream cascade of Reelin signaling. In eukaryotic cells, the nuclear translocation of signal transduction proteins, such as transcription factors, is essential for cell processes, such as differentiation, transformation, and the control of gene expression (20Yoneda Y. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 21Poon I.K. Jans D.A. Traffic. 2005; 6: 173-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Transport across the nuclear envelope occurs through the nuclear pore complex (NPC). 2The abbreviations used are: NPC, nuclear pore complex; NLS, nuclear localization signal; NES, nuclear export signal; LMB, leptomycin B; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescence protein; pBS, pBluescript II; aa, amino acid(s); WGA, wheat germ agglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; En, embryonic day n; WT, wild type; CA, constitutively active; KD, kinase-dead; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; zz, two immunoglobulin G-binding domains of protein A. Although NPC contains pathway for small molecules (smaller than 40-60 kDa or 9 nm in diameter) by diffusion (22Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar), many cell proteins with nuclear function appear to be actively transported in and out of the nucleus through the NPC. Active nucleocytoplasmic transport is mostly mediated by a family of nuclear transport receptors belonging to the karyopherin family, also known as importins and exportins, by an energy-dependent mechanism (23Macara I.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 570-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar, 24Mosammaparast N. Pemberton L.F. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 547-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). A protein destined for the nucleus or cytoplasm contains a specific sequence that can be recognized by importin or exportin. The import sequence is provided by the nuclear localization signal (NLS), which interacts with the import receptor importin α and importin β complex (25Adam E.J. Adam S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 30Radu A. Blobel G. Moore M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1769-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). So far, two major types of NLSs have been identified for the nuclear import of proteins: classic NLS and bipartite NLS. The former was first found in the large T antigen of the SV40 virus and contains clusters of basic amino acids (31Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar). The bipartite NLS was first identified in Xenopus nucleoplasmin and is composed of the following characteristic pattern: two basic residues, ∼10-12-amino acid linker, and another basic region consisting of at least 3 basic residues of 5 residues (32Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the export sequence is provided by a leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) (33Fischer U. Huber J. Boelens W.C. Mattaj I.W. Luhrmann R. Cell. 1995; 82: 475-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar, 34Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar), which interacts directly with a class of exportins called exportin1 or CRM1 (chromosomal maintenance 1) in a RanGTP-dependent manner (35Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar, 39Stade K. Ford C.S. Guthrie C. Weis K. Cell. 1997; 90: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). Some proteins that contain both NLS and NES shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The steady state localization of such proteins is regulated by the relative rates of their export and import. Extracellular signals influence these rates, so the extracellular signals can control the gene expression by regulating bidirectional movements of the signal transducer proteins (40Xu L. Massague J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In this study, we report that the DAB1 protein is able to shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus. In the presence of leptomycin B (LMB), an inhibitor of CRM1 (41Wolff B. Sanglier J.J. Wang Y. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 139-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), DAB1 accumulates in the nucleus. Mutagenesis analysis revealed that DAB1 contains two leucine-rich NES sequences and a bipartite NLS sequence. Furthermore, we demonstrated that DAB1 protein does indeed directly interact with CRM1 in a RanGTP-dependent manner. Mice—The reeler mouse colony was originally derived from heterozygous B6C3Fe-a/a-rl adults (The Jackson Laboratory). Heterozygous reeler (+/rl) and homozygous reeler (rl/rl) mice were obtained by crossing rl/rl males with +/rl females. ICR mice were obtained from Japan SLC (Hamamatsu, Japan). The day on which a vaginal plug was detected was designated as embryonic day 0 (E0). All animal experiments were performed according to the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the Keio University School of Medicine. Plasmid Vectors—To construct the DAB1 expression vector (pCAGGS-DAB1), the EcoRI fragment of DAB1 was excised from the full-length mouse DAB1 cDNA construct pBluescript II (pBS)-mDab555 (14Howell B.W. Gertler F.B. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by J. Cooper, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA) and introduced into the EcoRI site of pCAGGS1, which has the modification in a multiple cloning site of a mammalian expression vector pCAGGS (42Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4619) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by J. Miyazaki, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). To prepare the enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) fusion protein expression vector, EGFP was amplified by PCR using specific primers EGFP-F3 (5′-gaattcctcgagagcaagggcgaggagctg-3′) and EGFP-R (5′-gcggccgctttacttgtacag-3′) with pEGFP-N1 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) as a template. The amplified fragment was inserted into pGEM-T easy (Promega, Madison, WI). The EGFP fragment was excised by EcoRI/NotI digestion and inserted into the EcoRI/NotI site of pCAGGS1. The resulting plasmid pCAGGS1-EGFP/f was used to create EGFP fusion proteins. An expression plasmid (pCAGGS-DAB1-EGFP) encoding full-length DAB1 and EGFP fusion proteins was constructed as follows. A DAB1 cDNA fragment was amplified by PCR using DAB1-8 (5′-cggaattcaggatgtcaactgagacagaacttcaag-3′) and DAB1-9 (5′-cccctcgaggctaccgtcttgtggac-3′) with pBS-mDab555 as a template. The PCR fragment was cloned into the EcoRV site of pBS, generating pBS-DAB1/f. The DAB1 cDNA fragment was excised with EcoRI/XhoI digestion and inserted in frame with EGFP into the EcoRI/XhoI site of pCAGGS1-EGFP/f. To generate a series of substitutional mutations in DAB1, site-directed mutagenesis was carried out as described by Zheng et al. (43Zheng L. Baumann U. Reymond J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e115Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). The NES1 of DAB1, 152LDLRDLFQL160, was changed to 152ADARDAAQA160. To make mutations L152A, L154A, L158A, F158A, and L160A, we first introduced mutations into Phe158 and Leu160 of pBS-DAB1/f using DAB1-NESmt10s (5′-tctcgctcaagccatctatgagctgaagcaaagag-3′) and DAB1-NESmt10a (5′-agatggcttgagcgagatctctcaagtccagg-3′). Further mutations were introduced into Leu152, Leu154, and Leu158 using DAB1-NESmt16s (5′-atcgcggacgcgagagatgccgctcaagccatctatgagc-3′) and DAB1-NESmt16a (5′-gcggcatctctcgcgtccgcgataacaggttcagc-3′), and the resulting plasmid was designated as pBS-DAB1NES1mt/f. NES2 of DAB1, 462FDIS-QLNL469, was also changed to 462ADASQANA469. To make mutations F462A, I464A, L467A, and L469A, we first introduced mutations into Leu467 and Leu469 of pBS-DAB1/f using DAB1-NESmt15s (5′-caagcgaacgcgacccctgtgacttctac-3′) and DAB1-NESmt15a (5′-gtcgcgttcgcttgggagatgtcaaagtcatc-3′). Further mutations were introduced into Phe462 and Ile464 using DAB1-NESmt18s (5′-gacgctgacgcctcccaagcgaacgcgacc-3′) and DAB1-NESmt18a (5′-gaggcgtcagcgtcatcacagtcgtctgtatcctgtgcc-3′), and the resulting plasmid was designated as pBS-DAB1NES2mt/f. To make mutations in both NES1 and NES2 of DAB1, we first introduced mutations into Leu467 and Leu469 of pBS-DAB1NES1mt/f using DAB1-NESmt15s and DAB1-NESmt15a. Further mutations were introduced into Phe462 and Ile464 using DAB1-NESmt18s and DAB1-NESmt18a, and the resulting plasmid was designated as pBS-DAB1NES1/2mt/f. Three types of DAB1 mutants, DAB1NES1mt, DAB1NES2mt, and DAB1NES1/2mt, were excised by EcoRI/XhoI digestion and introduced into the EcoRI/XhoI site of pCAGGS-EGFP/f to generate pCAGGS-DAB1NES1mt-EGFP, pCAGGSDAB1NES2mt-EGFP, and pCAGGS-DAB1NES1/2mt-EGFP, respectively. The bipartite NLS of DAB1, 20RKKGQDRSEATLIKRFK36, was changed to 20AAAGQDRSEATLIAAFA36. To make mutations R20A, K21A, K22A, K33A, R34A, and K36A, we first introduced mutations into Lys33 and Arg34 of pBS-DAB1/f using DAB1-NLSmt3s (5′-atagcggcgtttaaaggcgaaggggtccggtacaaagcc-3′) and DAB1-NESmt3a (5′-aacgccgctatcaaagtggcttcgctgcgatcctgac-3′). Further mutations were introduced into Lys36 using DAB1-NLSmt7s (5′-ggcgtttgcaggcgaaggggtccggtacaaagcc-3′) and DAB1-NESmt7a (5′-cgcctgcaaacgccgctatcaaagtggcttcgctgcgatc-3′), followed by additional mutations into Arg20, Lys21, and Lys22 using DAB1-NLSmt8s (5′-actccgcggcggcaggtcaggatcgcagcgaagcc-3′) and DAB1-NLSmt8a (5′-gacctgccgccgcggagtctttcttggcgctgg-3′). The cDNA fragment of DAB1NLSmt was excised by EcoRI/XhoI digestion and introduced into the EcoRI/XhoI site of pCAGGS-EGFP/f to generate pCAGGS-DAB1NLSmt-EGFP. An expression plasmid (pCAGGS-DAB1NES1/2mtΔN-EGFP) encoding DAB1 with N-terminal deletion and substitutional mutation in both NES1 and NES2 was constructed as follows. First, the sequence corresponding to amino acids 37-555 of DAB1NES1/2mt was amplified by PCR using specific primers DAB1-23 (5′-gaattcaccatgggcgaaggggtccggtac-3′) and DAB1-24 (5′-gcctcgaggctaccgtcttgtggacttatattatcacc-3′) with pBS-DAB1NES1/2mt/f as a template. The PCR product was inserted into the EcoRV site of pBS, followed by digestion with EcoRI/XhoI. The DAB1 N-terminal deletion mutant cDNA was inserted into the EcoRI/XhoI site of pCAGGS1-EGFP/f in frame with EGFP. An expression contract (pCAGGS-DAB1NLSmtNES1/2mt-EGFP) encoding a fusion protein between EGFP and full-length DAB1 containing site-directed mutations in NLS, NES1, and NES2 was constructed as follows. A ∼1-kb ApaI fragment containing DAB1 N-terminal cDNA derived from pCAGGS-DAB1NLSmt-EGFP was ligated into a ∼6-kb ApaI fragment containing DAB1 C-terminal cDNA derived from pCAGGS-DAB1NES1/2mt-EGFP. For the construction of the fusion protein between C-terminal deletion mutants of DAB1 and EGFP, the coding sequence of DAB1 proteins was amplified by PCR with pBS-mDab555 or pBS-DAB1NES1mt/f as a template. We used the following combinations of primers to produce cDNA fragments encoding the indicated amino acids of DAB1: DAB1-8 and DAB1-22 (5′-gcctcgagagatggtgtggtagaagtcacaggg-3′) for DAB1ΔC1 or DAB1NES1mtΔC1 (amino acids (aa) 1-478); DAB1-8 and DAB1-21 (5′-gcctcgagacagtcgtctgtatcctgtgccac-3′) for DAB1ΔC2 or DAB1NES1mtΔC2 (aa 1-459); DAB1-8 and DAB1-16 (5′-gcctcgagaaaggcatcacctggggttgcag-3′) for DAB1ΔC3 or DAB1NES1mtΔC3 (aa 1-271); DAB1-8 and DAB1-17 (5′-gcctcgagaacaccttccttcttttggctggtgg-3′) for DAB1ΔC4 or DAB1NES1mtΔC4 (aa 1-231); DAB1-8 and DAB1-18 (5′-gcctcgagagcttgttcacactgcttatccttttgtgc-3′) for DAB1ΔC5 or DAB1NES1mtΔC5 (aa 1-183); DAB1-8 and DAB1-19 (5′-gcctcgagagccgcctgggctgttttgatg-3′) for DAB1ΔC6 (aa 1-147); and DAB1-8 and DAB1-20 (5′-gcctcgagttctcccttggaacgtgcgcc3′) for DAB1ΔC7 (aa 1-80). These DAB1 C-terminal deletion mutant cDNAs were cloned into the EcoRV site of the pBS vector. The resulting plasmids were digested with EcoRI/XhoI and inserted into the same restriction site of pCAGGS1-EGFP/f in frame with EGFP to make pCAGGS-DAB1ΔC1-EGFP, pCAGGS-DAB1NES1mtΔC1-EGFP, pCAGGS-DAB1ΔC2-EGFP, pCAGGS-DAB1NES1mtΔC2-EGFP, pCAGGS-DAB1ΔC3-EGFP, pCAGGS-DAB1NES1mtΔC3-EGFP, pCAGGS-DAB1ΔC4-EGFP, pCAGGS-DAB1NES1mtΔC4-EGFP, pCAGGS-DAB1ΔC5-EGFP, pCAGGS-DAB1NES1mtΔC5-EGFP, pCAGGS-DAB1ΔC6-EGFP, and pCAGGS-DAB1DC7-EGFP, respectively. All of the mutations were verified by sequencing with an ABI PRISM 3700 sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and a Big Dye terminator cyclesequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). To create Fyn expression vectors (pCAGGS-Fyn WT, pCAGGS-Fyn CA, and pCAGGS-Fyn KD), human wild-type Fyn (Fyn WT), FynK299M (a kinase-dead form, Fyn KD), and FynY531F (a constitutively active form, Fyn CA) cDNAs (44Semba K. Nishizawa M. Miyajima N. Yoshida M.C. Sukegawa J. Yamanashi Y. Sasaki M. Yamamoto T. Toyoshima K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Yamamoto, Tokyo University, Tokyo, Japan) were excised by MluI, blunted with T4 DNA polymerase, and subcloned into the SmaI site of the pBS vector. Fyn cDNAs were excised by EcoRI/NotI and introduced into pCAGGS7, which contains a modification in multiple cloning site of pCAGGS. The GST-DAB1NLS-EGFP and GST-DAB1NLSmt-EGFP expression vectors were constructed as follows. A DAB1-EGFP fragment was excised with EcoRI/NotI from pCAGGS-DAB1-EGFP and introduced into pGEX-4T-1 (GE Healthcare) to generate pGEX4T1-DAB1-EGFP. The cDNA fragment of DAB1 was removed with EcoRI/XhoI, and an oligonucleotide fragment encoding DAB1 NLS (RKKGQDRSEATLIKRFK), which was created by annealing two oligonucleotides (5′-aattcatgaagaaaggtcaggatcgcagcgaagccactttgataaagaggtttaaac-3′ and 5′-tcgagtttaaacctctttatcaaagtggcttcgctgcgatcctgacctttcttcatg-3′), was inserted into the EcoRI/XhoI site. Likewise, the DAB1 NLS fragment with mutations in the basic amino acids (DAB1NLSmt; AAAGQDRSEATLIAAFA), which was created by annealing the two oligonucleotides 5′-aattcgccgccgccggtcaggatcgcagcgaagccactttgatagccgcctttgccc-3′ and 5′-tcgagggcaaaggcggctatcaaagtggcttcgctgcgatcctgaccggcggcggcg-3′ was ligated into the EcoRI/XhoI site. The resulting plasmids were designated pGEX4T1-DAB1NLS-EGFP and pGEX4T1-DAB1NLSmt-EGFP, respectively. The GST-DAB1NES1/2mt expression vector (pGEX4T1-DAB1NES1/2mt) was created as follows. First, a DAB1NES2mt cDNA fragment was amplified by PCR using DAB1-8 and DAB1-28 (5′-gcggccgctcagctaccgtcttgtggac-3′) with pBS-DAB1NES2mt and subcloned into the EcoRV site of the pBS vector. The DAB1NES2 cDNA fragment was excised with EcoRI/NotI digestion and inserted in frame with GST into the EcoRI/NotI site of pGEX-4T-1, and the resulting plasmid was designated pGEX4T1-DAB1NES2mt. Second, to construct the GST-DAB1NES1/2mt expression vector, the EcoRI/NcoI fragment of pGEX4T1-DAB1NES2mt was removed, and an EcoRI/NcoI fragment obtained from pBS-DAB1NES1mt containing DAB1 NES1 with mutations was then inserted into the EcoRI/NcoI site. The full-length Reelin expression vector pCrl (47D'Arcangelo G. Nakajima K. Miyata T. Ogawa M. Mikoshiba K. Curran T. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 23-31Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was kindly provided by T. Curran (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN). Culture and Transfection of Neuro2a Cells—For the subcellular localization studies of DAB1 or the various DAB1-EGFP fusion proteins, Neuro2a cells were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. Transient transfection of plasmid DNA into Neuro2a cells was performed using Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For experiments requiring inhibition of CRM1-dependent nuclear export, after 36 h in culture, transfected cells were treated with LMB (Sigma) at 10 ng/ml or the same volume of methanol as a vehicle control and incubated for another 1, 2, 3, 4, or 12 h. Ex Utero Electroporation—To introduce plasmid DNAs into cerebral cortical neurons, we carried out an ex utero electroporation using E14.5 ICR mice as described by Tabata and Nakajima (48Tabata H. Nakajima K. Neuroscience. 2001; 103: 865-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 49Tabata H. Nakajima K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 9996-10001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications for the ex utero experiment. Dissected brains were immersed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4), and plasmid DNA was injected into both lateral ventricles with a glass micropipette. The brain was placed between tweezer-type electrodes (CUY650P5; Nepa Gene Co., Chiba, Japan). Electric pulses (30 V, 50 ms) were charged eight times at 950-ms intervals for each hemisphere of the brain using a square pulse electroporator (CUY21EDIT; Nepa Gene Co.). After electroporation, brains were used for primary culture. Primary Culture of Cerebral Cortical Neurons—Primary cerebral cortical neurons were prepared from mouse brains as described by Goslin and Banker (50Goslin K. Asmussen H. Banker G. Culturing Nerve Cells, 2nd Ed. MIT Press, London1998: 339-370Google Scholar) with a slight modification at E14.5 for the ex utero electroporation experiment and for observation of endogenous DAB1 subcellular localization or at E16.5 for the Reelin stimulation experiment. The dorsolateral regions of the cerebral cortices were dissected out, the meninges were stripped away, and the isolated brain tissues were then treated with a trypsin (2.5%) and DNase (80 μg/ml) solution for 15 min at 37 °C. After washing three times with calcium- and magnesium-free Hanks' balanced salt solution, the brain tissues were triturated by pipetting to dissociate the cells. The cells were then plated at a cell density of 1 × 105 cells/cm2 on acidwashed and poly-l-lysine-treated glass coverslips in 6-well cluster dish for microscopic observation or poly-l-lysine-treated 6-cm plastic culture dishes for the Reelin stimulation experiment. The neurons were cultured in a neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen), 0.5 mm l-glutamine, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. For LMB treatment, after 36 h in culture, cells were treated with methanol (vehicle control) or 10 ng/ml LMB for another 12 h. Reelin-containing Medium and Reelin Stimulation—293T cells on a 10-cm culture dish were transfected with pCrl encoding full-length Reelin cDNA with Superfect transfection reagent. After 3 h of transfection, the transfection reagent was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. Two days later, mock- and Reelin-containing supernatants were collected and stored at 4 °C until use. The mock- or Reelin-containing medium was applied to mouse embryonic cortical neurons at 3 days in culture, and the neurons were stimulated for 10, 30, and 60 min. Immunoprecipitation—For immunoprecipitation, primary neurons on 6-cm culture dishes or Neuro2a cells on 35-mm culture dishes were collected, lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and clarified by centrifugation. The clarified lysates were reacted with a rabbit anti-DAB1 antibody (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) overnight at 4 °C on a rotator, and then protein G beads were added and incubated for an additional 1 h. The beads were precipitated, washed three times with lysis buffer, eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. After electroblotting onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA), tyrosine phosphorylation was detected with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated pY20 monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories, San Jose, CA). The blot was stripped with SDS and reprobed with the mouse anti-DAB1 monoclonal antibody D4, which was kindly provided by A. Goffinet (University of Louvain, Brussels, Belgium). Immunocytochemistry—For the immunocytochemical analysis, Neuro2a cells or primary neurons were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, washed, and permeabilized with an extraction solution (PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin and 1% Triton X-100) for 15 min. The cells were then incubated with primary antibodies against rabbit anti-DAB1 antibody, mouse monoclonal anti-Fyn antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), mouse monoclonal anti-histone antibody (Chemicon International), or mouse monoclonal anti-class III β-tubulin antibody (TuJ1; Babco, Richmond, CA) for 60 min, washed, and further incubated for 60 min with the goat anti-rabbit IgG TRITC (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA), goat anti-mouse IgG fluorescein isothiocyanate (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), and TO-PRO-3 iodide (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). For detection of endogenous DAB1 in the primary neurons, goat biotin-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was applied as the secondary antibody and visualized by reaction with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated streptavidin (Vector Laboratories). Criteria for Subcellular Distribution of Proteins—The following criteria were used to determine the subcellular distribution of DAB1 and DAB1-EGFP fusion proteins. For the cytoplasmic localization (C), the protein signal is more intense in the cytoplasm than the nucleus. For the nuclear localization (N), the protein signal is more intense in the nucleus than the cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic and nuclear localization (C = N) protein signal is equally distributed in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Subcellular Fractionation and Western Blot Analysis—Cerebral cortices were dissected out from E16.5 +/rl or rl/rl mouse brains and stored at -80 °C until use. After genotyping as described previously (51D'Arcangelo G. Miao G.G. Curran T. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 39: 234-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the +/rl or rl/rl cerebral cortices were homogenized in 100 μl of homogenization buffer (0.32 m sucrose, 25 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and protease inhibitor mixture) and centrifuged at 2300 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was stored as a cytosolic fraction. The pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of homogenization buffer and centrifuged at 2300 × g for 10 min. This step was repeated two times. The final nuclear pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of SDS-sample buffer and sonicated for 10 0.8-s sonications using a probe type sonicator (TOMY UD-201; Tomy, Tokyo, Ja"
https://openalex.org/W1970421017,"We report the cloning of a Trypanosoma cruzi gene encoding a solanesyl-diphosphate synthase, TcSPPS. The amino acid sequence (molecular mass ∼ 39 kDa) is homologous to polyprenyl-diphosphate synthases from different organisms, showing the seven conserved motifs and the typical hydrophobic profile. TcSPPS preferred geranylgeranyl diphosphate as the allylic substrate. The final product, as determined by TLC, had nine isoprene units. This suggests that the parasite synthesizes mainly ubiquinone-9 (UQ-9), as described for Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania major. In fact, that was the length of the ubiquinone extracted from epimastigotes, as determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Expression of TcSPPS was able to complement an Escherichia coli ispB mutant. A punctuated pattern in the cytoplasm of the parasite was detected by immunofluorescence analysis with a specific polyclonal antibody against TcSPPS. An overlapping fluorescence pattern was observed using an antibody directed against the glycosomal marker pyruvate phosphate dikinase, suggesting that this step of the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway is located in the glycosomes. Co-localization in glycosomes was confirmed by immunogold electron microscopy and subcellular fractionation. Because UQ has a central role in energy production and in reoxidation of reduction equivalents, TcSPPS is promising as a new chemotherapeutic target.

Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiological agent of Chagas disease or American trypanosomiasis, which is the leading cause of cardiac death in endemic areas throughout Latin America. More than 18 million people are infected with the parasite, and some 40 million more are at risk (1Urbina J.A. Docampo R. Trends Parasitol. 2003; 19: 495-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar).Chemotherapy of Chagas disease is unsatisfactory because of toxicity and lack of efficacy of existing drugs, and it is important to identify enzymes and metabolic processes in T. cruzi that might be potential targets for drug development. One pathway that has been particularly useful for the identification of new targets is the isoprenoid pathway. Enzymes studied so far involved in the synthesis of sterols (2Urbina J.A. Curr. Pharm.

Chem. 2001; 276: 33930-33937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), bear predicted targeting signals for the glycosomes. Glycosomes are specialized peroxisomes that, like them, contain several enzymes in pathways of ether lipid synthesis, fatty acid β-oxidation, and peroxide metabolism, and, in addition, contain the Embden-Meyerhof segment of glycolysis (19Michels P.A. Moyersoen J. Krazy H. Galland N. Herman M. Hannaert V. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2005; 22: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).In the present study, we report the cloning, sequencing, and heterologous expression of a T. cruzi gene designated TcSPPS that encodes a functional SPPS. The expressed TcSPPS gene could complement the function of the corresponding polyprenyl-diphosphate synthase of Escherichia coli, and the cells produced mainly UQ-9. The kinetic properties of the recombinant TcSPPS were analyzed, and the enzyme was shown to localize in the glycosomes, supporting the role of these organelles in isoprenoid synthesis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Newborn calf serum, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, protease inhibitor mixture, dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), geranyl diphosphate (GPP), FPP, geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP), and IPP were purchased from Sigma.

Am. 1976; 26: 10-19PubMed Google Scholar).DNA Sequencing and Bioinformatics—Sequencing grade DNA was obtained using a Qiagen kit. Sequencing was performed on an ABI 377 using a BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), or on a MegaBACE 1000 using the DYEnamic ET dye terminator kit (Amersham Biosciences). Vector primers and the following sequencing primers were used: Fwd (antisense), 5′-CACGTGCCACCATGGCAAAC-3′; Fwd2 (antisense), 5′-CAATGCCTTCTGCCATGTC-3′. Chromatograms were analyzed using Bio Edit software (24Hall T.A. Nucl. Acids Symp. Ser. 1999; 41: 95-98Google Scholar). Homology searches were performed at the NCBI Blast server (25Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69088) Google Scholar), and sequences were aligned using ClustalX VI 1.81. The theoretical molecular weight and isoelectric point were obtained from the ExPASy Server (cn.expasy.org). The superimposed hydrophobicity profiles were calculated using the Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy algorithm (26Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16999) Google Scholar) at bioinformatics.weizmann.ac.il/hydroph. The presence of a signal peptide was assessed by the SignalP 3.0 software (www.cbs.dtu.dk/) (27Bendtsen J.D. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (5608) Google Scholar).Hybridization to Cosmid Filters—Cosmid filters from a CL Brener cosmid library were used (28Hanke J. Sanchez D.O. Henriksson J. Åslund L.C. Pettersson U. Frasch A.C.C. Hoheisel J. BioTechniques. 1996; 21: 686-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The whole coding sequence of the gene was generated by PCR, purified from agarose gels using DEAE membranes (29Dretzen G. Bellard M. Sassone-Corsi P. Chambon P. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), and 30 ng was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming (Prime a Gene, Promega). Cosmid filters were prehybridized and hybridized as described (28Hanke J. Sanchez D.O. Henriksson J. Åslund L.C. Pettersson U. Frasch A.C.C. Hoheisel J. BioTechniques. 1996; 21: 686-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), using a Micro 4 oven (Hybaid, UK). Two of the positive clones (20i8 and 69i5) were further studied.Hybridization to Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis and Northern Filters—Chromosomes from the T. cruzi CL Brener clone were separated by pulsed field gel electrophoresis using different running conditions (30Búa J. Garcia G.A. Galindo M. Galanti N. Ruiz A.M. Medicina (B Aires). 1999; 59: 11-17PubMed Google Scholar) and transferred to nylon filters (kindly provided by Mario Galindo, Instituto de Ciencias Biomédicas, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Chile). Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosomes were used as markers (Bio-Rad). Total RNA from epimastigotes was isolated using an SV Prep Total RNA kit (Sigma), according to the manufacturer's instructions. For Northern blot analysis, epimastigotes total RNA was subjected to electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel containing 1× MOPS buffer and 6.29% (v/v) formaldehyde after boiling for 10 min in 50% (v/v) formamide, 1× MOPS buffer, and 5.9% (v/v) formaldehyde. The RNA was transferred to a Hybond-N filter. A T. cruzi probe encoding the 19-kDa cyclophilin, TcCyP19, was used as a positive control.RT-PCR—T. cruzi CL Brener epimastigote mRNA was isolated by using a QuickPrep Micro mRNA kit (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences), and RT-PCR was performed with the Access RT-PCR System (Promega) using the following primers at 1 μm final concentration: Miniexon (sense), 5′-AACGCTATTATTGATACAGTTTCTGTACTATATTG-3′, Fwd2 (antisense). As an internal positive control TcCyP19 was amplified.Southern Blot Analysis and Genome Organization—T. cruzi CL Brener genomic DNA (3 μg) was digested by NcoI and AatII (Fermentas), separated on a 1% agarose gel and transferred to Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Efficient transfer was confirmed by methylene blue staining (Sigma). Probe generation and target detection was performed using the Gene Images AlkPhos Direct Labeling & Detection system (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. Blast searches of the T. cruzi genome (www.genedb.org/genedb/tcruzi/) were performed with TcSPPS nucleotide sequence. In silico restriction analysis was performed at The Sequence Manipulation Suite web site (bioinformatics.org/sms/).Expression and Purification of TcSPPS from E. coli—For expression in E. coli, the entire coding sequence of the TcSPPS gene was amplified by PCR using primers (PS5, 5′-CCGGATCCATGCTGAAAACAGGCCTTT-3′; PS3, 5′-CCAAGCTTCATACTTGTCGCGTTAAAA-3′) that introduced BamHI and HindIII restriction sites for convenient cloning into the expression vector pET-28a+ to yield pET-TcSPPS. The joining region was sequenced for confirmation. E. coli BL21(DE3) bacterial cells transformed with pET-TcSPPS were induced, and the recombinant protein was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose, following the standard Qiagen procedure. The eluted fraction was desalted with a PD-10 desalting column. Proteins were quantified by the Bradford method (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard and the absence of protein contaminants was checked by SDS-PAGE.Measurement of Activity and Product Analysis—Enzyme activity was measured by determination of the amount of [4-14C]IPP incorporated into butanol-extractable polyprenyl diphosphates. Because removal of the polyhistidine tag resulted in complete loss of activity of other prenyltransferases from trypanosomatids (5Montalvetti A. Bailey B.N. Martin M.B. Severin G.W. Oldfield E. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33930-33937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 11Montalvetti A. Fernandez A. Sanders J.M. Ghosh S. Van Brussel E. Oldfield E. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17075-17083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), this was not done. The standard assay mixture contained, in a total volume of 100 μl, 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (at physiological pH 7.4), 1 mm MgCl2, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 100 μm [4-14C]IPP (1 μCi/μmol), allylic substrate (400 μm DMAPP, 400 μm GPP, 30 μm FPP, or 50 μm GGPP), and 0.5-3 μg of the purified protein. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and the reaction was stopped by chilling quickly in an ice bath. The reaction products were then extracted with 1 ml of 1-butanol saturated with water. The 1-butanol layer was washed with water saturated with NaCl, and radioactivity in the butanol extract was determined with a liquid scintillation counter. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the activity required to incorporate 1 nmol of [4-14C]IPP into extracted product in 1 min. To identify the reaction products after the enzymatic reaction, the radioactive prenyl diphosphates in the mixture were hydrolyzed to the corresponding alcohols with potato acid phosphatase as described before (32Koyama T. Fujii H. Ogura K. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 110: 153-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The alcohols were extracted with n-pentane and analyzed by TLC on a reversed-phase Adsorbosil HPTLC plate with a solvent system of acetone/water (12:1, v/v). The positions of authentic standards were visualized by iodine vapors. The radioactivity was visualized by autoradiography.Glycosome Enrichment—T. cruzi CL Brener epimastigotes (∼109 cells) were centrifuged for 10 min at 2,000 × g, and washed twice in TEDS buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing protease inhibitors (P8340, Sigma). After freezing at -80 °C for 20 min and thawing at 37 °C, cells were centrifuged and resuspended in homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% v/v ethanol, 5 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, and protease inhibitors). The parasites were grinded in a pre-chilled mortar with 1× wet weight silicon carbide until no intact cells were observed under the light microscope. The lysate was centrifuged at 100 × g for 10 min to remove the silicon carbide, which was washed in homogenization buffer, and both supernatants were combined (Fraction A). A centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 15 min was performed to remove the nuclei, and the supernatant (Fraction B) was centrifuged at 33,000 × g to enrich in glycosomes. The supernatant was Fraction C (cytoplasm) and the pellet (Fraction D) was the glycosomal enriched fraction. The whole procedure was performed twice. Protein concentration of each fractionation step was measured by a colorimetric assay (Protein Assay, Bio-Rad).Western Blot Analysis—To investigate for protein expression in the different stages, total trypanosome proteins (30 μg of protein/lane) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel (10%) and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were probed with 1:3,000 dilution of a rabbit anti-SPPS and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:10,000). Immunoblots were developed using the ECL™ chemiluminescent detection kit (Amersham Biosciences).For Western blot analysis of the different subcellular fractions, the blots were sequentially probed with a rabbit anti-TbgGAPDH antibody as a marker for glycosomes at a dilution of 1:3,000, and after a stripping step, with rabbit anti-TcSPPS antibody.Complementation Analysis—The TcSPPS was tested for its capacity to complement the ispB gene of E. coli. Strain KO229, whose essential ispB gene was disrupted and complemented by the ispB expression vector pKA3 (spectinomycin-resistant), was subjected to a plasmid-swapping experiment (33Okada K. Minehira M. Zhu X. Suzuki K. Nakagawa T. Matsuda H. Kawamukai M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3058-3060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the pET construct would not be inducible in strain KO229, the gene was subcloned into pQE30 vector (pQE-TcSPPS). After transformation with pQE-TcSPPS, the colonies were grown and passaged for several days in LB medium (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 1% sodium chloride, pH 7.5) supplemented with ampicillin (to select pQE-TcSPPS-carrying colonies) and isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (to induce expression of the His6-TcSPPS fusion protein). Isolated colonies were checked for ampicillin resistance and spectinomycin sensitivity.Ubiquinone Extraction and Measurement—Ubiquinone was extracted as previously described (34Okada K. Kainou T. Tanaka K. Nakagawa T. Matsuda H. Kawamukai M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The crude extract of UQ was analyzed by normal-phase TLC with authentic standard UQ-10. Normal-phase TLC was carried out on a Kieselgel 60 F254 plate (Merck) with benzene/acetone (93:7, v/v). The band containing UQ was collected from the TLC plate following UV visualization and extracted with chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v). Samples were dried and re-dissolved in ethanol. The purified UQ was further analyzed by HPLC with ethanol as the solvent.Fluorescence Microscopy—For co-localization with a glycosomal marker, T. cruzi Y strain epimastigotes slides were prepared as previously described (35Rohloff P. Montalvetti A. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52270-52281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Antibody concentrations were as follows: affinity-purified rabbit anti-TcSPPS antibody at 1:4,000; supernatant from an anti-TbPPDK producing mouse hybridoma culture at 1:10; anti-mouse Alexa 488 at 1:1,000; anti-rabbit Alexa 546 at 1:1,000. For co-localization studies with MitoTracker and the vacuolar pyrophosphatase, epimastigotes were fixed for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, washed twice in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, adhered to poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips, and permeabilized for 3 min with 0.3% Triton X-100. Cells were blocked for 30 min in 50 mm NH4Cl and 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 8.0, and incubated for 1 h with polyclonal primary antibodies raised against T. cruzi SPPS (1:1000), and monoclonal antibodies raised against T. brucei VP1 (1:200). For mitochondrial staining, cells were previously incubated for 30 min in culture medium containing 100 nm MitoTracker before fixation. Cells were then washed in 3% bovine serum albumin, incubated with secondary antibodies anti-mouse Alexa 488 (1:1,000), anti-rabbit Alexa 488, and anti-rabbit Alexa 546 (1:1,000) and mounted in prolong Antifade. Cells were observed in a Deltavision fluorescence microscope. Images were recorded with a Photometrics CoolSnap HQ camera and deconvolved for 15 cycles using Softwarx deconvolution software.Immunogold Electron Microscopy—Immunogold electron microscopy experiments were performed as described previously (35Rohloff P. Montalvetti A. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52270-52281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) using the rabbit anti-SPPS antibody (1:100) and a monoclonal antibody against T. brucei pyruvate-phosphate dikinase (1:10). After washing, the grids were incubated with 18 nm colloidal gold-AffiniPure-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) and 12 nm colloidal gold-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L). Images were acquired on a Phillips CM-200 transmission electron microscope operating at 120 kV.RESULTSIdentification of T. cruzi SPPS—We determined the complete sequence of the T. cruzi cDNA clone TENU4155 (accession number AW324852) (36Porcel B.M. Tran A.N. Tammi M. Nyarady Z. Rydaker M. Urmenyi T.P. Rondinelli E. Pettersson U. Andersson B. Aslund L. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1103-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), which showed similarities to polyprenyl synthases. The sequence surrounding the first ATG complied with the published rules for start codons in protozoa (37Yamauchi K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2715-2720Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To obtain further upstream sequences a cDNA probe was hybridized to high density cosmid filters, and the sequence obtained from two of the positive clones (20i8 and 69i5) with the forward primer displayed a stop codon in the same reading frame as the first putative ATG, confirming the protein coding region. This sequence has been submitted to the GenBank™ under the accession number AF282771.Translation of the open reading frame of 1092 bp yielded a polypeptide of 363 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 39 kDa and an isoelectric point of 6.01. A small residue (Ala) is found at position -5 before the first aspartate-rich motif. This position is diagnostic, determining the final product length (for a review, see Ref. 38Liang P.-H. Ko T.-P. Wang A.H.-J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3339-3354Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Bulky amino acids do not allow nascent long chains to extend further inside the hydrophobic cavity of the enzyme. A BLAST search of the protein data base showed that the amino acid sequence from T. cruzi shared up to 38% identity and up to 61% similarity with other polyprenyl synthases. Considering specifically the human homologue (accession number NP_055132), the identity reached 33%.The amino acid sequence from the T. cruzi enzyme was aligned with other representative polyprenyl synthases (Fig. 1A). All the conserved motifs involved in catalysis or binding (regions I-VII) identified in other polyprenyl synthases (39Koyama T. Biosci. Biotechnol.

https://openalex.org/W2087073885,"Cell wall hydrolases are well documented to be present on pollen, but their roles on the stigma during sexual reproduction have not been previously demonstrated. We explored the function of the tapetum-synthesized xylanase, ZmXYN1, on maize (Zea mays L.) pollen. Transgenic lines (xyl-less) containing little or no xylanase in the pollen coat were generated with use of an antisense construct of the xylanase gene-coding region driven by the XYN1 gene promoter. Xyl-less and wild-type plants had similar vegetative growth. Electron microscopy revealed no appreciable morphological difference in anther cells and pollen between xyl-less lines and the wild type, whereas immunofluorescence microscopy and biochemical analyses indicated an absence of xylanase on xyl-less pollen. Xyl-less pollen germinated as efficiently as wild-type pollen in vitro in a liquid medium but less so on gel media of increasing solidity or on silk, which is indicative of partial impaired water uptake. Once germinated in vitro or on silk, the xyl-less and wild-type pollen tubes elongated at comparable rates. Tubes of germinated xyl-less pollen on silk did not penetrate into the silk as efficiently as tubes of wild-type pollen, and this lower efficiency could be overcome by the addition of xylanase to the silk. For wild-type pollen, coat xylanase activity on oat spelled xylan in vitro and tube penetration into silk were inhibited by xylose but not glucose. The overall findings indicate that maize pollen coat xylanase facilitates pollen tube penetration into silk via enzymatic xylan hydrolysis.

Sexual reproduction in plants is the union of male gametes in pollen and eggs in the female carpel of flowers. A pollen grain lands and germinates on the carpel surface, termed the stigma, and produces a tube that penetrates the stigma into the carpel. The tube carrying male gametes elongates toward the ovary and discharges them to the ovule, where one of the two gametes fertilizes the egg (1Mascarenhas J.P. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1303-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 2Bewley J.D. Hempel F.D. McCormick S. Zambryski P. Buchanan B.B. Gruissem W. Jones R.L. Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Plants. American Society of Plant Physiologists, Rockville, MD2000: 988-1043Google Scholar, 3McCormick S. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: S142-S153Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Initial contact during sexual reproduction involves two successive steps, namely, germination of pollen on the stigma and penetration of the pollen tube through the stigma into the carpel. The former step is more critical in species with dry stigma, such as maize and those of Brassicaceae (4Edlund A.F. Swanson R. Preuss D. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: S84-S97Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Dry stigma discourages microbial infection, but the pollen has to draw water from the carpel interior for germination. The mechanism for pollen to absorb water from the carpel interior depends on the species. In self-incompatible species, such as those in the Brassica genus, water uptake from the carpel relies on a haplotype-specific signal transduction system, which permits water uptake into compatible pollen (5Kachroo A. Nasrallah M.E. Nasrallah J.B. Plant Cell. 2004; 14: S227-S238Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 6Kao T.H. Tsukamoto T. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: S72-S83Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In self-compatible species, such as maize and most Arabidopsis species, water uptake does not require this signal transduction system. Regardless, for pollen to obtain water from the carpel, its coat has to come into physical contact with the stigma to establish water flow (7Heslop-Harrison Y. Reger B.J. Heslop-Harrison J. Acta Bot. Neerl. 1984; 33: 205-227Crossref Google Scholar). In addition to its ability to absorb water and germinate on the stigma, pollen placed in a liquid or on a semisolid medium readily takes up water and germinate (8Saini J.P. Dube S.D. Maydica. 1986; 31: 227-232Google Scholar, 9Walden D.B. Freeling M. Walbot V. The Maize Handbook. Springer-Verlag, New York1994: 723-724Google Scholar). After the pollen tube has protruded from the grain, it needs to penetrate the stigma into the carpel. The mechanism of this step is unknown, in part, because of the difficulty in studying the in vivo process. The stigma wall is overlaid with an incomplete layer of cutin, and thus the crucial physical barrier is the wall alone (7Heslop-Harrison Y. Reger B.J. Heslop-Harrison J. Acta Bot. Neerl. 1984; 33: 205-227Crossref Google Scholar). Wall hydrolases and wall-modulating proteins are known to be present on or rapidly secreted from pollen. Their presence was observed by in situ staining (10Knox R.B. Johri B.M. Embryology of Angiosperms. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1984: 197-272Crossref Google Scholar) and by chemical analyses of extracts of pollen coat, subfractions of the pollen wall, or rapidly secreted materials from pollen (11Chay C.H.

These proteins could be remnants of lyzed tapetum cells stuck onto the pollen having no further function. Alternatively, they could be components specifically synthesized for hydrolysis of the stigma wall for tube entry or hydrolysis and modulation of the tube track wall inside the carpel for advancement of the pollen tube. Pollen wall hydrolases and wall-modulating proteins have been best studied with maize. Maize is monoecious and self-compatible, and its flowers are large and produce abundant pollen. Maize pollen surface crest (19Skvarla J.J. Larson D.A. Am. J. Bot. 1966; 53: 1112-1125Crossref Google Scholar) can be separated into two biochemically distinct, morphological parts: the wall and the coat external to it (17Suen D.F. Wu S.S. Chang H.C.

Maize pollen wall and its transiently associated proteins include wall hydrolases and modulating proteins (11Chay C.H. Buehler E.G. Thorn J.M. Whelan T.M. Bedinger P.A.

These proteins are synthesized in the pollen interior and secreted to the wall and exterior before, during, or immediately after germination. They include polygalacturonase and several wall-modulating proteins, which consist of expansin, profilin, cation-binding protein, pollen allergen (trypsin inhibitor), extensin, and other potential wall modulators. The mRNAs of these proteins in the microspores (immature pollen) and mature pollen appear late during anther development, and their levels persist or increase after germination (17Suen D.F. Wu S.S. Chang H.C. Dhugga K.S. Huang A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43672-43681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, these wall hydrolases and modulating proteins likely exert a role after the pollen tube has penetrated the stigma and may hydrolyze and modulate the cell wall of the cells forming the pollen tube track in the carpel for advancement of the pollen tube toward the ovary. Maize pollen coat, which is located on top of the pollen wall, contains proteins and lipids. These coat molecules are largely if not exclusively synthesized in the adjacent tapetum, which is a one-celled layer enclosing the anther locule where pollen mature (20Hesse M. Pacini E. Willemse M. Cytology, Function, Biochemistry and Evolution. Springer-Verlag Wien, New York1993Google Scholar). The coat proteins consist of only a few molecular species, the predominant one being a xylanase (EC 3.2.1.8) (14Bih F.Y. Wu S.S. Ratnayake C. Walling L.L. Nothnagel E.A. Huang A.H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 32: 22884-22894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Their mRNAs are present exclusively in the tapetum and appear earlier than those of the pollen-synthesized wall proteins (preceding paragraph) during anther development. The xylanase is synthesized as a larger precursor of 60 kDa in the tapetum and is processed at both the N and C termini to the active 35-kDa enzyme (21Wu S.S. Suen D.F. Chang H.C. Huang A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49055-49064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These coat proteins may be present fortuitously as remnants after death of the tapetum or, especially the predominant xylanase, play a vital and yet unknown physiological role in the initiation of sexual reproduction. Maize and other cereals have a Type II cell wall, which contains predominantly hemicellulose and cellulose (22Carpita N. McCann M. Buchanan B.B. Gruissem W. Jones R.L. Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Plants. American Society of Plant Physiologists, Rockville, MD2000: 52-108Google Scholar). The hemicellulose backbone consists of a polymer of xylose (xylan) with short branches of arabinose and glucuronic acid. The xylanase in the maize pollen coat has been purified to homogeneity, and its in vitro activity is that of an endoxylanase that can act specifically on xylan (14Bih F.Y. Wu S.S. Ratnayake C. Walling L.L. Nothnagel E.A. Huang A.H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 32: 22884-22894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 17Suen D.F. Wu S.S. Chang H.C. Dhugga K.S. Huang A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43672-43681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, the maize pollen coat xylanase may act on the hemicellulose in the stigma wall, generating an opening for entry of the pollen tube into the carpel. We explored this possible role of the maize pollen coat xylanase. We used an antisense approach to generate lines with normal vegetative growth but little or no xylanase on pollen. We then examined the ability of xylanase-less pollen to germinate in vitro and in vivo and their tubes to penetrate the stigma into the carpel. The overall results show that the coat xylanase facilitates pollen tube penetration into the carpel via enzymatic xylan hydrolysis. Plant Materials—Anthers and pollen were collected from maize (Zea mays L., B73) plants grown in a greenhouse at 28 °C with 14-h/10-h day/night cycle. Anthers of five developmental stages were selected on the basis of the following criteria (14Bih F.Y. Wu S.S. Ratnayake C. Walling L.L. Nothnagel E.A. Huang A.H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 32: 22884-22894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (57) Google Scholar). At stage 1, the tassel was still embedded in the shoot apex. The anthers filled up about one-third of each floret. Each microspore mother cell had undergone meiosis to produce a tetrad of microspores, which were still encased within a callose wall. At stage 2, the upper portion of the tassel had protruded from the shoot apex. The anthers filled up about one-half of the floret. Young microspores had been released from the dissolved callose wall, and the outer pollen wall (exine) had been synthesized. At stage 3, the tassel had protruded completely out of the top of the plant. The anthers filled up about two-thirds of the floret. The microspores had become larger and contained multiple small vacuoles. First mitosis had occurred, and the microspores were binucleate. At stage 4, the anthers filled up the floret completely. Second mitosis in the microspores had occurred, and the microspores were trinucleate. At stage 5, the tassel was yellow. Some of the florets on the tassel were open, and the pollen was ready to be released. Cloning and Sequencing of Xyl Antisense Construct—A 2.0-kb ZmXYN1 fragment was amplified from a genomic clone (14Bih F.Y. Wu S.S. Ratnayake C. Walling L.L. Nothnagel E.A. Huang A.H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 32: 22884-22894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (57) Google Scholar) by PCR with 5′(5′-GCGGCCGCTGAAGATAACATAATTAAGATATCG-3′) and 3′ (5′-GGATCCCTTGGTGACCGCGTTGCCG-3′) primers; the underlined sequences represent those recognized by the applied restriction enzymes. This fragment contains a 1.2-kb ZmXYN15′ promoter sequence plus the 5′-untranslated region and a 744-bp sequence (preXYN1) encoding the N-terminal 248 residues of the 60-kDa prexylanase; the 248-residue polypeptide encoded by the latter sequence would be removed in in vivo processing of the prexylanase to the mature 35-kDa xylanase. A 931-bp ORF 2The abbreviations used are: ORF, open reading frame; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin. encoding the mature 35-kDa xylanase was amplified from the same genomic clone by PCR with 5′ (5′-GGATCCCTCGGCCTCCCGGCATACG-3′) and 3′ (5′-GGATCCCTTACGGTGAACTTAAAGTCGC-3′) primers. The 2.0- and 931-bp fragments were cloned into pBluescript II SK(+) (pBSK) vector and pGEM-T, respectively. A 0.3-kb nopaline synthase terminator (NOS-ter) was cut from pBI 101.1 with use of SacI and EcoRI and then cloned into pUC19. The NOS-ter fragment was cut from this pU19 with BamHI and EcoRI and inserted into pBSK containing (ZmXYN1 promoter + N-preXYN). The ORF of ZmXYN1 encoding the 35-kDa xylanase was cut from pGEM-T containing the insert with use of BamHI and inserted into pBSK containing ZmXYN1 promoter + N-preXYN + NOS-ter at the position between the N-preXYN and NOS-ter sequences. The antisense orientation and the sequence of the ORF of ZmXYN1 were confirmed with results from restriction enzyme digestions and sequencing, respectively. Establishment of Xyl Antisense Transgenic Lines—Immature embryos of maize (Z. mays L., B73) were bombarded with the plasmid containing the above-mentioned antisense XYN1 construct and a plasmid containing a bar gene (23Gordon-Kamm W.J. Spencer T.M. Mangano M.L. Adams T.R. Daines R.J. Start W.G. O'Brien J.V. Chambers S.A. Adams Jr., W.R. Willetts N.G. Rice T.B. Mackey C.J. Krueger R.W. Kausch A.P. Lemaux P.G. Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 603-618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with use of a gene gun. After bombardment, calli were initiated from the embryos in a selection medium for bialaphos resistance. A portion of each selected callus was used to detect the inserted antisense XYN in the genome by PCR. Calli containing the proper antisense XYN1 construct were regenerated into plantlets on MSS media (MS medium plus vitamins, 3% sucrose, and 0.3% gelrite but minus hormones) in Petri dishes (25 × 100 mm) at 25 °C in 80-100 μE/m2/s light (16/8-h photoperiod). The bombardment and regeneration of plantlets were performed at the Plant Transformation Facility at Iowa State University. When the leaves and roots of a plantlet reached about 4-6 cm long, the plantlet was transferred to soil and grown in a greenhouse at 28 °C with a 14/10-h photoperiod. Regenerated transgenic plants (T0) were pollinated with wild-type (inbred B73) pollen, and the seeds so produced were termed T1.T1 plants grown from T1 seeds produced flowers, and the pollen was subjected to immunoblot analyses for XYN1 (a following section). Individual T1 plants that produced pollen with little or no XYN1 were retained and selfed, and the seeds produced were termed T2. Plants grown from T2 seeds were used for experiments. PCR Analysis of Transgenic Lines—Genomic DNA was extracted from transformed calli by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (24Suen D.F. Wang C.K. Lin R.F. Kao Y.Y. Lee F.M. Chen C.C. Theor. Appl. Genet. 1997; 94: 331-337Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). PCR analysis involved use of 5′ (5′-GCGGCCGCTGAAGATAACATAATTAAGATATCG-3′) and 3′ (5′-CGAGAACGAGATGAAGTGGTAC-3′) primers and yielded a 3.0-kb fragment, representing the promoter and the coding regions of XYN1 (shown in Fig. 1). The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel with ethidium bromide staining and photographed under UV. Calli whose DNA gave the 3.0-kb fragment represented transformed lines that had the correct inserted antisense XYN1 construct in the genome. These calli were regenerated into mature plants (T0). Genomic DNA Blot Hybridization of XYN1—Genomic DNA was extracted from leaves by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (24Suen D.F. Wang C.K. Lin R.F. Kao Y.Y. Lee F.M. Chen C.C. Theor. Appl. Genet. 1997; 94: 331-337Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Each hybridization reaction mixture contained 10 μg of gDNA and one restriction enzyme (EcoRI or HindIII). After digestion, the DNA fragments were separated with the use of a 0.8% agarose gel. The gel was placed in 0.25 m HCl for 20 min, rinsed with water twice, shaken in 1.5 m NaCl and 0.5 m NaOH for 1 h, and equilibrated in 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1.5 m NaCl for 1 h. The DNA fragments were blotted onto a Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was pretreated at 65 °C in 0.5 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 7% SDS, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 m EDTA for 4 h, hybridized with 32P-labeled gene-specific probe overnight, and then washed with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 20 min, 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 20 min, and 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 20 min, all at 65 °C. The 32P-labeled gene-specific probe was prepared as follows. The plasmid contained the antisense construct was digested with BamHI and EcoRI (Fig. 1A). After digestion, the reaction mixture was run on a 1% gel. The gel containing the expected 494-bp fragment was cut, and the fragment was extracted and purified with the use of QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and then 32P labeled with the use of Prime-a-Gene labeling system (Promega, Madison, WI). Un-incorporated, labeled nucleotide was removed with use of a Micro-Spin™ G-50 column (Amersham Biosciences). The purified probe was used in the hybridization reaction. Preparation of Total Pollen Protein and Pollen Coat Fraction—A total pollen-protein fraction was obtained as follows. A sample of 5.5 mg of mature pollen was ground in 100 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (1×: 0.0625 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.002% bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol) in a microcentrifuge tube with a mini-pestle, and the homogenate was boiled for 20 min. A pollen coat fraction was obtained as follows. One gram of pollen was mixed with 10 ml of diethyl ether for 3 min in a capped tube by repeated inversions. The tube was centrifuged for 10 min at 8,000 × g, and the ether layer was collected. The volume of the ether preparation was reduced to 500 μl under a stream of nitrogen. The ether preparation was used directly for lipid analyses by TLC or partitioned with 1 volume of 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0. The aqueous sodium acetate fraction (lower layer) was collected and used as the pollen coat protein fraction. Detection of Pollen Coat Xylanase and β-Glucanase by SDS-PAGE and Immunoblot Analyses and of Lipids by TLC—All procedures followed those described earlier (14Bih F.Y. Wu S.S. Ratnayake C. Walling L.L. Nothnagel E.A. Huang A.H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 32: 22884-22894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The total proteins of pollen from wild-type and transgenic plants were subjected to 12.5% (w/v) SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue and then destained or subjected to immunoblot analysis as follows. The proteins on the gel were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Rabbit antibodies were raised against the purified recombinant mature 35-kDa XYN1 (14Bih F.Y. Wu S.S. Ratnayake C. Walling L.L. Nothnagel E.A. Huang A.H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 32: 22884-22894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The antibody preparation recognized the pollen coat mature 35-kDa XYN1 and also a 55-kDa pollen interior protein, whose identity is unknown (21Wu S.S. Suen D.F. Chang H.C. Huang A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49055-49064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The latter immunodetected protein was used as a control of equal loading of total pollen proteins from different transgenic maize lines into a gel for comparison. Serial-diluted total pollen-protein fraction of the wild type (1×, 2×, 4×, and 8×) and serial-increased total pollen-protein fractions individual transgenic lines (1× and 2×) were used to estimate the loss of xylanase in the transgenic lines. Transgenic lines producing pollen coat xylanase with less than 20% of that in wild-type were used; they are called the xyl-less line or pollen. The above total pollen protein sample after SDS-PAGE was also used for immunoblot analyses of the coat β-glucanase. Rabbit antibodies were raised against a synthetic polypeptide of DKDDLAKSAEGYE, which was present in the maize pollen coat β-glucanase but absent in all other known maize β-glucanases (17Suen D.F. Wu S.S. Chang H.C. Dhugga K.S. Huang A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43672-43681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Coat lipids were applied to a TLC plate (silica gel 60 A, Whatman Inc., Clifton, NJ). The plate was developed in hexane:diethyl ether:acetic acid (95:5:2, v/v/v) and stained in an iodine chamber for 24 h. Reverse Transcriptase-PCR Analysis of Antisense Gene Expression—Total RNA was extracted from maize anthers, leaves, immature kernels, and roots as described earlier (25Kim H.U. Hsieh K. Ratnayake C. Huang A.H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22677-22684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). A sample of 1 μg of total RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase and then used to synthesize first-strand cDNA with an oligo(dT)12-18 primer (17Suen D.F. Wu S.S. Chang H.C. Dhugga K.S. Huang A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43672-43681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The cDNA was used as a template for reverse transcriptase-PCR with a pair of primers. For the sense transcript, the 5′ primer (5′-GGGAGGCATGACCGCTTACT-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-CGAGAACGAGATGAAGTGGTAC-3′) were used for a 0.13-kb fragment (shown in Fig. 1). For the antisense transcript, 5′ primer (5′-CGCGGCCACAACGTCTTCTG-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-CGAGAACGAGATGAAGTGGTAC-3′) were used for a 3-kb fragment. The PCR product was electrophoresed on a 1.2% agarose gel, which was stained with ethidium bromide and then observed under UV. Pollen Germination in Vitro—Old pollen and anthers on tassels of plants were removed in the afternoon a day before pollen collection. Fresh pollen was collected from each plant in the morning by shaking the tassel in a plastic bag. For in vitro germination, a sample of 5 mg of pollen was placed in 2 ml of liquid germination medium (100 ppm Ca(NO3)2, 10 ppm H3BO3, 37.5 ppm lysine, 5 ppm cysteine, 0.05 ppm glutamic acid, and 15% (w/v) sucrose (8Saini J.P. Dube S.D. Maydica. 1986; 31: 227-232Google Scholar)) or on solid germination media. Solid media had the same composition as that of the liquid medium but with the addition of 0.7, 1.4, or 2.1% (w/v) of phytagel (Sigma catalog number P-8169). Each gel medium was placed in a 100 × 15-mm Petri dish, which was then air-dried under a laminar hood for 2 h to remove water on the medium surface. The dish was sealed with a parafilm and stored at 4 °C. It was warmed to room temperature immediately before use. Pollen was spread on the gel, and the dish was covered to keep moisture. The pollen was allowed to germinate at 25 °C for periods of time described under “Results.” Germinated and non-germinated pollen grains were observed with a Leica DMLB microscope and counted. Pollen Germination on and Tube Penetration into Silk—Fresh silks on each wild-type plant were covered with a paper bag after the silks started to emerge. All silks used in one experiment were obtained from the same plant. When the silks that had emerged from the cob were 8 cm long, their tips turned slightly pink. These 8-cm silks were cut, and their lower ∼1-cm portions were placed in a cylindrical vial (5 cm tall and 1.3 cm internal diameter) containing 2 ml of water. Pollen grains were dusted onto the top ∼5-cm portions of 16 silks to saturation. The silks were then shaken gently to remove pollen grains that did not adhere tightly. The vial including silks was placed at the center of a 1000-ml beaker, which contained 100 ml of water. Prior to this placement, the beaker was sealed with a transparent plastic for 24 h to generate a relative humidity close to saturation (∼100%). Samples were quickly placed in and removed from the beaker, which was then resealed. At time intervals, silks were removed from the vial, and their upper portions were cut into three segments of 1 cm each and fixed on a microscopy glass slid with use of a fixation solution (2.5% glutaraldehyde and 0.05% Titon X-100 in PBS (10 mm phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 138 mm NaCl, and 2.7 mm KCl)) for 1 h. The fixed silk segments were observed directly or after treatment with 0.1% aniline blue for 1 h and photographed with a Leica DMLB microscope. All pollen grains (200∼400) from three silk segments on one slid at each time interval were observed and counted. Pollen tubes penetrated into or grew along the surface of the silks. These two types of pollen tubes were determined by observing their fluorescence (excitation at 530-560 nm and emission detected at 570-650 nm) with use of a microscope and continuous focus adjustments (shown in Fig. 6). The germination ratio of a pollen sample is the number of germinated pollen divided by the number of total pollen on three silk segments from one silk on a slid. The penetration efficiency of a pollen sample is the number of pollen with tubes penetrating into silks divided by the number of germinated pollen on the same slid. Experiments described in the preceding paragraph were also performed to test the effects of xylanase, BSA, xylose, and glucose on pollen germination and tube penetration. Viability of pollen grains was severely compromised after they had been treated with any tested solution for 5 min. Therefore, the silks were treated instead. The top 6- to 7-cm portions of the 8-cm silk segments (preceding paragraph) before being dusted with pollen were first immersed in a solution of 0.4 μg/μl of BSA, 0.4 μg/μl of a Thermomyces lanuginosus xylanase (Sigma catalog number X-2753), 0.1 m xylose or glucose, or a blank solution for 5 min and then dried in air for 10 min. The silk segments were then treated as described in the preceding paragraph. Measurement of Pollen Tube Length—Pollen was germinated in a liquid or 2.1% phytogel medium as described in the preceding paragraph. When the pollen germination ratio was about 10% (after 5 min in liquid and 20 min in gel medium), 10 or more germinated pollen grains were randomly chosen, and the lengths of tubes were estima"

There exist two structurally unrelated classes of Msrs, called MsrA and MsrB, specific for the S and the R epimer of the sulfoxide function of methionine sulfoxide, respectively.

In the present study, the amino acids involved in the catalysis of the reductase step of the Neisseria meningitidis MsrA have been characterized. The invariant Glu-94 and to a lesser extent Tyr-82 and Tyr-134 are shown to play a major role in the stabilization of the sulfurane transition state and indirectly in the decrease of the pKapp of the catalytic Cys-51. A scenario of the reductase step is proposed in which the substrate binds to the active site with its sulfoxide function largely polarized via interactions with Glu-94, Tyr-82, and Tyr-134 and participates via the positive or partially positive charge borne by the sulfur of the sulfoxide in the stabilization of the catalytic Cys.

Two structurally unrelated classes of Msrs have been described so far. MsrAs are stereo specific toward the S isomer on the sulfur of the sulfoxide function, whereas MsrBs are specific toward the R isomer. Both classes share a similar three-step catalytic mechanism (Scheme 1). First, the reductase step leads to formation of a sulfenic acid intermediate on the catalytic cysteine concomitantly with the release of one mole of Met/mole of Msr. Then, an intra-disulfide bond is formed via the attack of a second Cys (called the recycling Cys) on the sulfenic acid intermediate accompanied by release of a water molecule. Finally, the disulfide bond is reduced by thioredoxin (Trx) in the last step. Recently, the kinetics of the three steps have been investigated for MsrA and MsrB domains of the PilB protein of Neisseria meningitidis (1Antoine M. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11616-11622Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For both classes of Msrs, the rate-limiting step is associated with the Trx recycling process, whereas the rate of formation of the intra-disulfide bond is governed by that of formation of the sulfenic acid intermediate, the rate of which is fast.The three-dimensional structures of the MsrA from Escherichia coli, Bos taurus, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis have been recently solved by x-ray crystallography (3Taylor A.B.

The active site can be represented as an opened basin readily accessible to the MetSO substrate in which the catalytic Cys-51 is located at the entrance of the α 1 helix. In all the structures, the active site is occupied by a molecule that is covalently or non-covalently bound to the catalytic cysteine. In the case of E. coli MsrA, a dimethyl arsenate molecule is covalently bound, whereas it is a dithiothreitol molecule in B. taurus enzyme. In the case of M. tuberculosis MsrA, a methionine residue from a neighboring monomer occupies the active site. In all three structures, a water molecule is present, the position of which can mimic the oxygen atom of the sulfoxide function of MetSO. This water molecule is tightly H-bonded to three invariant amino acid residues, i.e. Tyr-82, Glu-94, and Tyr-134. All the three structures also support the involvement of invariant Phe-52 and Trp-53 in the substrate recognition via the formation of a hydrophobic pocket in which the ϵ methyl group of MetSO can bind.Study of the reduction mechanism of dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) by methanethiol in Me2SO solution has recently been investigated by quantum chemistry calculations (6Balta B. Monard G. Ruiz-Lopez M.F. Antoine M. Gand A. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. J. Phys. Chem. A. 2006; 110: 7628-7636Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It was shown that 1) a sulfurane species is formed prior to formation of either a sulfenic acid intermediate or a disulfide species and 2) the rate-limiting step is governed by proton transfer between the thiol and the sulfoxide functions prior to sulfurane formation. Although these conclusions are derived from studies based on a model in solution, they provide a framework for the study of the chemical reductase step occurring within the MsrA active site.In the present study, the role of Glu-94, Tyr-82, and Tyr-134 residues and how the catalytic Cys-51 is stabilized in the reductase step of the MsrA from N. meningitidis have been investigated. For that, the kinetic parameters and the pH dependence of the rate constant of the reductase step of mutated MsrAs at positions 82, 94, and 134 were determined and compared with those of the wild type. The pKapp of Cys-51 in the free enzyme was also determined. The results show that Cys-51 is activated upon substrate binding to the active site with a shift of its pKa from 9.5 to 5.7. Substitutions at positions 82, 94, and 134 do not modify the apparent affinity for the substrate in the reductase step. In contrast, drastic decrease of the reductase step rate is observed for the E94A and Y82F/Y134F MsrAs, whereas E94Q MsrA displays only a small decrease. Moreover, each mutated MsrA is characterized by a shift of the pKapp of its Cys-51 to higher values compared with wild type. Taking into account all the results, a scenario for the catalysis of the sulfoxide reductase step is proposed in which Glu-94, Tyr-82, and Tyr-134 stabilize the sulfurane transition state formed. In this scenario, the substrate binds to the active site with its sulfoxide function largely polarized via interactions with the side chains of Glu-94, Tyr-82, and Tyr-134 and plays a major role in stabilizing Cys-51 via the positive, or partially positive, charge borne by the sulfur of the sulfoxide function.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSite-directed Mutagenesis, Production, and Purification of Wild-type and Mutated N. meningitidis MsrAs—The E. coli strain used for all N. meningitidis MsrA productions was BE002 (MG1655 msrA::specΩ, msrB::α 3kana), transformed with the plasmidic construction pSKPILBMsrA containing only the coding sequence of msrA from pilB, under the lac promoter (7Olry A.

The BE002 strain was kindly provided by Dr. F. Barras. Its use prevented expression of endogenous wild-type MsrA and MsrB from E. coli and thus avoided any contamination of the activity of the N. meningitidis MsrA by the Msrs from E. coli. Site-directed mutageneses were performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene).Purifications were realized as previously described (1Antoine M. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45352-45357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutated MsrAs were pure, as checked by electrophoresis on 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining and by electrospray mass spectrometry analyses. Storage of the enzymes was done as previously described. The molecular concentration was determined spectrophotometrically, using extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 26,200 m–1·cm–1 for wild-type and mutated MsrAs. In this report, N. meningitidis MsrA amino acid numbering is based on E. coli MsrA sequence.Quantification of the Free Cysteine Content with 5,5′-Dithiobis(2-nitro)benzoate—Cysteine content of MsrA was routinely determined using 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitro)benzoate under non-denaturing conditions in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8) as previously described (8Boschi-Muller S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 35908-35913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar).pH Dependence of MsrA Thiol Reaction Rates with 2,2′-Dipyridyl Disulfide (2PDS)—Because of the high reactivity of Cys-51 and Cys-198 in MsrA, fast kinetic measurements were carried out on an Applied PhotoPhysics SX18MV-R stopped-flow apparatus. MsrA reactions with 2PDS were performed at 25 °C under pseudo-first-order conditions in 30 mm acetic acid, 30 mm imidazole, 120 mm Tris/HCl buffer at constant ionic strength of 0.15 m over a pH range of 6 to 10 (polybuffer B). MsrA and 2PDS concentrations after mixing were 6.2 and 310 μm, respectively. The pseudo-first-order rate constant kobs was determined at each pH by fitting the absorbance (A) at 343 nm versus time (t) to mono-exponential Equation 1, where a is the burst amplitude and c is the end point. The second-order rate constants k2 were calculated by dividing kobs by 2PDS concentration and then fitted to Equation 2, in which k2max represents the second rate constant for the thiolate form. A=a(1-e-kobs t)+c(Eq. 1) k2=k2max1+10(pKa-pH)(Eq. 2) Measurement of the Thiol Ionization by Ultraviolet Absorbance—Absorbance spectra were measured for all enzymes in 1.0-cm path length quartz cuvettes in a SAFAS UV-visible absorbance spectrophotometer. The protein samples were diluted to 23 μm in polybuffer B. Spectra were recorded at 25 °C in 0.5-nm steps from 300 to 200 nm over a pH range of 7 to 10. The buffer solution was scanned relative to air, followed by a protein solution in the same cuvette versus air. The two spectra were then subtracted and the difference converted to molar absorption coefficients at 240 nm (ϵ240 nm). Data were fitted to a model derived from the Henderson-Hasselbach equation as shown in Equation 3 for one apparent pKa. ϵ240nm=ϵSH+ϵS-1+10(pKa-pH)(Eq. 3) Steady-state MsrA Kinetics in the Presence of the Trx Recycling System—Steady-state kinetic parameters were determined with the Trx reductase recycling system (E. coli Trx (100 μm), E. coli Trx reductase (4.8 μm), NADPH (1.2 mm)) and by varying the concentrations of AcMetSONHMe. AcMetSONHMe was prepared and purified as previously described (2Olry A. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11616-11622Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Initial rate measurements were carried out at 25 °C in buffer A or polybuffer B on a Kontron Uvikon 933 spectrophotometer by following the decrease of the absorbance at 340 nm due to the oxidation of NADPH. Initial rate data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten relationship using least squares analysis to determine kcat and Km for AcMetSONHMe. E. coli Trx1 and Trx reductase were prepared following experimental procedures already published (7Olry A. Boschi-Muller S. Marraud M. Sanglier-Cianferani S. Van Dorsselear A. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12016-12022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).Preparation of MsrA under Oxidized Disulfide State—MsrA oxidation was achieved by mixing 100 μm MsrA with 100 mm MetSO in buffer A. The MetSO used was DL-Met-R,S-SO of which only the S isomer is a substrate for MsrA. After 10 min of incubation at room temperature, oxidized proteins were passed through an Econo-Pac 10 DG desalting column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with buffer A. Oxidation of MsrA in the disulfide state was checked by titration with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitro)benzoate.Fluorescence Properties of Wild-type and Mutated MsrAs—The fluorescence excitation and emission spectra of wild-type and mutated MsrAs in their reduced and Cys-51/Cys-198 disulfide state were recorded on a flx spectrofluorometer (SAFAS) thermostated at 25 °C in buffer A with 10 μm of each protein as previously described (1Antoine M. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45352-45357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).Determination of the Rate of Met Formation and of Thiol Loss by Single Turnover Quenched Flow Experiments—Quenched flow measurements were carried out at 25 °C on a SX18MV-R stopped-flow apparatus (Applied PhotoPhysics) fitted for double mixing and adapted to recover the quenched samples as previously described (1Antoine M. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45352-45357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The apparatus worked in a pulsed mode. Under the conditions used, a minimum aging time of ∼25–40 ms was determined. Equal volumes (57.5 μl) of a solution containing 550 μm Glu-94-mutated MsrA in buffer A and a solution containing AcMetSONHMe in buffer A were mixed in the aging loop. The mixture was then allowed to react for the desired time before being mixed with 115 μl of a quenched aqueous solution containing 2% of trifluoroacetic acid. Quenched samples were then collected in a 200-μl loop. For each aging time, four shots were done and the four corresponding quenched samples were pooled in a volume of 700 μl and then analyzed.After protein precipitation and centrifugation, Ac-l-MetNHMe (AcMetNHMe) quantification in the resulting supernatant was carried out by reverse phase chromatography as previously described (2Olry A. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11616-11622Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar): 100 μl were injected onto a 4.6 × 250-mm Atlantis dC18 reverse phase column (Waters) on an AKTA explorer system (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with H2O/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. AcMetNHMe was eluted after AcMetSONHMe with a linear gradient of acetonitrile.The other part of the quenched samples that was not treated with 100% of trifluoroacetic acid was used to 1) determine the protein concentration from the absorbance at 280 nm and 2) quantify the free cysteine content, using 2PDS as a thiol probe, in the presence of urea to avoid precipitation of the protein in the cuvette. Progress curves of pyridine-2-thione production were recorded at 343 nm in 1.1 m urea, buffer A. Enzyme concentration was 6.19 μm, and 2PDS concentration was 665 μm. The amount of pyridine-2-thione formed was calculated using an extinction coefficient at 343 nm of 8,080 m–1·cm–1.Data were plotted as mole of AcMetNHMe formed/mole of MsrA and as free remaining thiols/mole of MsrA, both as a function of time. The rate of Met formation was determined by fitting the curve to the monoexponential Equation 4 in which a represents the fraction of Met formed/mole of MsrA and kMet represents the rate constant. y=a(1-e-kMett)(Eq. 4) The rate of loss in free thiols was determined by fitting the curve to the monoexponential Equation 5 in which y0 represents the number of free remaining thiols, a the number of oxidized thiols, and kSS the rate constant. y=y0+ae-kSSt(Eq. 5) Kinetics of the Formation of the Cys-51/Cys-198 MsrA Disulfide Bond in the Absence of Reductant by Single Turnover Stopped-flow Experiment at pH 8—Kinetics of the Trp-53 fluorescence variation associated with the formation of the Cys-51/Cys-198 disulfide bond were measured for E94Q, Y82F, and Y134F MsrAs at 25 °C on a SX18MV-R stopped-flow apparatus (Applied PhotoPhysics) fitted for fluorescence measurements as described previously (1Antoine M. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45352-45357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The excitation wavelength was set at 284 nm, and the emitted light was collected using a 320-nm cutoff filter. One syringe contained MsrA in buffer A (10 μm final concentration after mixing), and the other one contained AcMetSONHMe at various concentrations in buffer A. An average of at least six runs was recorded for each AcMetSONHMe concentration. Rate constants, kobs, were obtained by fitting fluorescence traces with the monoexponential Equation 6 in which c represents the end point, a the amplitude of the fluorescence increase (<0), and kobs the rate constant. y=ae-kobst+c(Eq. 6) Data were fitted to Equation 7 using least square analysis to determine kmax and KS for AcMetSONHMe. S represents the AcMetSONHMe concentration and KS the apparent affinity constant. kobs=kmaxSKS+S(Eq. 7) Kinetics of the Trp-53 fluorescence variation associated with the formation of the Cys-51/Cys-198 disulfide bond were measured for Y82F/Y134F and Y82F/Y134F/E94Q MsrAs at 25 °C on a flx spectrofluorometer (SAFAS). The excitation wavelength was set at 284 nm, and the fluorescence emission at 340 nm was recorded versus time after enzyme addition. Data were then treated as described above to obtain kobs, kmax, and KS values.pH Dependence of the Reductase Step Rate Constant—Determination of kmax and KS as a function of pH was carried out for wild-type MsrA by single turnover pre-steady-state fluorescence stopped-flow spectroscopy, using the same procedure as described in the previous section but replacing buffer A with polybuffer B. kobs values for E94Q, Y82F, Y134F, Y82F/Y134F, and Y82F/Y134F/E94Q MsrAs were determined at saturating concentration of AcMetSONHMe as a function of pH. Kinetics of Trp-53 fluorescence variation were recorded either with the stopped-flow apparatus or the spectrofluorometer depending on the mutated MsrA, as described in the previous section. The pH dependence of the reductase step rate constant for E94A and E94D MsrAs was determined under steady-state conditions using the Trx recycling system. kmax (or kobs) values were plotted against pH and fitted to Equation 8, deriving from a one-pKa model, where kmax opt represents the maximum pH-independent rate constant. kmax=kmaxopt(1+10(pKa-pH))(Eq. 8) RESULTSDetermination of pKapp of the Cys ResiduesThe pKapp of both Cys-51 and Cys-198 were determined in the reduced free enzyme by two methods. The first one involved determining the second-order rate constant of the reaction with the Cys-specific reactivity probe 2-PDS as a function of pH. The second one took advantage of the variation of the thiolate UV absorbance as a function of pH.Kinetics of Reaction of Reduced Wild-type, C51S, and C198S MsrAs with 2PDS—Reaction of 2PDS with wild-type MsrA obeyed pseudo-first-order kinetics, with formation of 2 mol of pyridine-2-thione/mol of MsrA as determined from the absorbance change at 343 nm. This result was expected as two Cys are present in N. meningitidis MsrA at positions 51 and 198. For all pH used, stopped-flow traces fitted to monoexponential Equation 1, with amplitude corresponding to the release of 2 mol of pyridine-2-thione. pH-k2 profile fitted to monosigmoidal Equation 2 with a pKapp value of 9.7 and k2max value of (2.4 ± 0.3)·105 m–1 s–1 (Fig. 1A). The product of 2PDS reaction with wild-type MsrA is the disulfide-oxidized enzyme and not the thiopyridine adducts. Indeed, no release of pyridine-2-thione was observed when 10 mm dithiothreitol was added to the purified product (data not shown).FIGURE 1pH dependence of the second-order rate constant k2 for the reaction of the thiol group with 2PDS of wild-type (•, panel A), C51S (□, panel B) and C198S (Δ, panel B) MsrAs. Reaction kinetics were performed at 25 °C over a pH range of 5–9 or 10 in polybuffer B. The concentrations of enzymes and 2PDS were 6.2 and 310 μm, respectively. Values of kobs were determined using nonlinear regression analysis, and second-order rate constants k2 were fitted to Equation 2 (solid line) (see also “Experimental Procedures”). The plateau of the sigmoidal plot was not attained at the pH tested. Therefore, the pKapp values obtained by fitting could only be taken as estimates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)C51S and C198S MsrAs behaved similarly to wild-type MsrA, except that only 1 mol of pyridine-2-thione/mol of MsrA was formed. pKapp value of 9.3 ± 0.1 and a k2max value of (3.1 ± 0.7)·104 m–1 s–1 for Cys-51 and a pKapp of 9.8 ± 0.1 and a k2max value of (2.6 ± 0.6)·104 m–1 s–1 for Cys-198 were determined (Fig. 1B). Altogether, the data support a pKapp value of both Cys-51 and Cys-198 in the reduced free wild-type enzyme close to 9.5.Direct Thiolate UV Absorbance of Reduced Wild-type, C51S, and C198S MsrAs—The thiolate absorbance of wild-type, C51S, and C198S MsrAs was monitored between pH 6 and 10. Analysis of the spectra and of the ϵ240 nm as a function of pH yielded monosigmoidal plots for all three MsrAs. Data fitted to pK values of 9.7, 9.8, and 9.7, associated with Δϵ240 nm of 3.1·104, 2.3·104, and 2.6·104 m–1·cm–1 for wild-type, C51S, and C198S MsrAs, respectively (Fig. 2). These pKapp values of Cys-51 and Cys-198 in the reduced free enzyme are in good agreement with those obtained with 2PDS.FIGURE 2pH dependence of the Cys thiol group absorbance properties of wild-type (•), C51S (Δ), and C198S (□) MsrAs. Molecular absorption coefficients at 240 nm were calculated from the absorbance spectra from 300 to 200 nm performed over a pH range of 7 to 10 in polybuffer B.

Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45352-45357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). AcMetSONHMe was used instead of MetSO because MsrA displays a better affinity for AcMetSONHMe (9Boschi-Muller S. Olry A. Antoine M. Branlant G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1703: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). As shown in Table 1, Y82F, Y134F, and E94Q MsrAs exhibited slight modifications of kcat compared with wild-type MsrA, with kcat values from 0.9 to 2.2 s–1 and a Km increase from 0.8 to 25 mm. In contrast, E94A, E94D, Y82F/Y134F, and Y82F/Y134F/E94Q MsrAs showed strongly decreased kcat values, from 1·10–3 to 2.5·10–1 s–1 and increased Km from 24 to 161 mm.TABLE 1Steady-state and reductase step kinetic parameters of wild-type and mutated MsrAs, with associated pKappSteady-stateaSteady-state parameters were deduced from nonlinear regression of initial rates to the Michaelis-Menten relationship (see “Experimental Procedures”).Reductase stepkcatKmkmaxbKinetic parameters of the reductase step were obtained from nonlinear regression of kobs to Equation 7 (see “Experimental Procedures”), except for E94A and E94D MsrAs.

Open table in a new tab In the wild type, the rate of the reductase step is largely higher than the kcat value (1Antoine M. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45352-45357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Therefore, to interpret the eventual kinetic consequences of the substitutions at positions 82, 94, and 134 at the level of the reductase step, it was first necessary to attain this rate. This was determined for E94Q, Y82F, Y134F, Y82F/Y134F, and Y82F/Y134F/E94Q MsrAs by following the variation of the Trp-53 fluorescence intensity under single turnover conditions, i.e. in the absence of reductant (1Antoine M. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45352-45357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In that context, it was assumed that the reductase step of the mutated MsrAs is still rate-determining in the process leading to formation of the Msr disulfide bond, 4For each Glu-94-mutated MsrA, the rate constant of the reductase step was shown to be rate-determining in the two-step process leading to the formation of the disulfide bond by following the rate of AcMetNHMe and disulfide bond formation directly by acid-quenching of the reaction, followed by quantification of product and MsrA remaining free thiols (see “Results” for E94A and E94D MsrAs, data not shown for E94Q). For each Tyr-substituted MsrA, the rate of the reductase step was shown to be too fast at pH 8 to allow direct determination of the rate of AcMetNHMe and disulfide bond formation (data not shown). as previously shown for the wild type (1Antoine M. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45352-45357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the case of E94Q, Y82F, and Y134F MsrAs, formation of the disulfide bond led to an increase in the Trp-53 fluorescence emission similar to that described for the wild type, whereas a quenching of the fluorescence was observed for Y82F/Y134F and Y82F/Y134F/E94Q MsrAs.Structural factors responsible for this different behavior remain unknown. For all mutated MsrAs, the variation of the fluorescence signal in function of time is of monoexponential type whatever the AcMetSONHMe concentration. The kinetic parameter"
https://openalex.org/W2077155359,"The two known DP proteins, TFDP1 and -2, bind E2Fs to form heterodimers essential for high affinity DNA binding and efficient transcriptional activation/repression. Here we report the identification of a new member of the DP family, human TFDP3. Despite the high degree of sequence similarity, TFDP3 is apparently distinct from TFDP1 in function. Although TFDP3 retained the capacity to bind to E2F proteins, the resulting heterodimers failed to interact with the E2F consensus sequence. In contrast to the stimulatory effect of TFDP1, TFDP3 inhibited E2F-mediated transcriptional activation. Consistent with this observation, we found that ectopic expression of TFDP3 impaired cell cycle progression from G<sub>1</sub> to S phase instead of facilitating such a transition as TFDP1 does. Sequence substitution analysis indicated that the DNA binding domain of TFDP3 was primarily responsible for the lack of DNA binding ability of E2F-TFDP3 heterodimers and the inhibition of E2F-mediated transcriptional activation. Fine mapping further revealed four amino acids in this region, which were critical for the functional conversion from activation by TFDP1 to suppression by TFDP3. In conclusion, these studies identify a new DP protein and a novel mechanism whereby E2F function is regulated."
https://openalex.org/W2021663812,"The phosphoinositides have well-defined roles in the control of cellular functions, including cytoskeleton dynamics, membrane trafficking, and cell signaling. However, the interplay among the phosphoinositides and their diffusible derivatives that originate through phospholipase A2 action (the lysophosphoinositides and glycerophosphoinositols) remains to be fully elucidated. Here we demonstrate that in PCCl3 rat thyroid cells, the intracellular levels of glycerophosphoinositol are finely modulated by ATP and norepinephrine through the P2Y metabotropic and alpha-adrenergic receptors, respectively. The enzyme involved here is phospholipase A2 IValpha (PLA2 IValpha), which in these cells specifically hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol, forming lysophosphatidylinositol, glycerophosphoinositol, and arachidonic acid. This receptor-mediated activation of PLA2 IValpha leads to stimulation of PCCl3 cell growth. The involvement of a PLA2 IValpha-mediated pathway is demonstrated by inhibition of the increase in intracellular glycerophosphoinositol levels and cell proliferation by specific inhibitors, RNA interference, and overexpression of the dominant-negative PLA2 IValpha(1-522). Modulation of PCCl3 cell growth is not seen with inhibitors of arachidonic acid metabolism. In conclusion, these data characterize glycerophosphoinositol as a mediator of the purinergic and adrenergic regulation of PCCl3 cell proliferation, defining a novel regulatory cascade specifically involving this soluble phosphoinositide derivative and widening the involvement of the phosphoinositides in the regulation of cell function."

To investigate how the apelin gene is regulated transcriptionally, we cloned and characterized approximately 3000 and approximately 4000 bp 5'-upstream fragments of the rat and human apelin genes. Putative CAAT-like box, but not TATA-box sites were identified. The rat (-207/-1 bp) and human (-100/+74 bp) core promoter sequences contain putative binding sites for upstream stimulatory factor (USF)-1/-2. Mutagenesis and overexpression assays showed that USF up-regulates basal and inducible apelin transcription. EMSA and supershift experiments indicated binding of USF-1/-2 to the rat (-114/-109 bp) and human (-84/-79 bp) apelin promoters. ChIP experiments show that USF is recruited to the putative USF binding site in the human apelin promoter in cultured breast cells. In concert with increased breast apelin expression during pregnancy and lactation in rats, EMSAs demonstrate an elevated binding of pregnant and lactating rat breast nuclear proteins to a consensus USF oligonucleotide. In vivo ChIP assays verified increased USF binding to the apelin promoter in breast of lactating rats. Together, our findings show that USF exerts a stimulatory role in regulation of breast apelin expression during pregnancy and lactation."
https://openalex.org/W1981599615,"Adenosine is known to stimulate interleukin (IL)-6 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion from pituitary TtT/GF folliculostellate [corrected] (FS) cells indicating that it is an important paracrine regulator of anterior pituitary function. This study demonstrates that rodent anterior pituitary cell lines produce extracellular adenosine that is able to increase intercellular gap junction communication in FS cells. Ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73), the enzyme that generates adenosine from AMP, was demonstrated by immunocytochemistry in approximately 20% of anterior pituitary cells, and some of these cells colocalized with prolactin and growth hormone. CD73 mRNA and protein were detected in GH3 and MMQ (somatotroph-lactotroph lineages) and TtT/GF cells, and enzyme activity was demonstrated by the conversion of exogenously added fluorescent ethenoAMP to ethenoadenosine. Adenosine production, as measured by HPLC, was detected in GH3 (1 microM/h) and MMQ (3 microM/h) but not in TtT/GF cells. Adenosine (EC50: 0.5 microM) and NECA (universal adenosine receptor agonist; EC50 0.1 microM) stimulated connexin 43 (Cx43) mRNA and protein expression within 1-2 h in TtT/GF cells. Adenosine and NECA also stimulated gap junctional intercellular communication (as assessed by transmission of Alexa Fluor 488) by 6- to 8-fold in comparison with untreated TtT/GF cells. In cocultures of MMQ and TtT/GF cells, Cx43 expression in TtT/GF cells increased in proportion to the number of MMQ cells plated out. These data suggest that adenosine, formed locally in the anterior pituitary gland can stimulate gap junction communication in FS cells."
https://openalex.org/W1971011987,"Cross-linking of the B cell receptor (BCR) on the immature B lymphoma cell line BKS-2 induces growth inhibition and apoptosis accompanied by rapid down-regulation of the immediate-early gene egr-1. In these lymphoma cells, egr-1 is expressed constitutively and has a prosurvival role, as Egr-1-specific antisense oligonucleotides or expression of a dominant-negative inhibitor of Egr-1 also prevented the growth of BKS-2 cells. Moreover, enhancement of Egr-1 protein with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or an egr-1 expression vector rescued BKS-2 cells from BCR signal-induced growth inhibition. Nuclear run-on and mRNA stability assays indicated that BCR-derived signals act at the transcriptional level to reduce egr-1 expression. Inhibitors of ERK and JNK (but not of p38 MAPK) reduced egr-1 expression at the protein level. Transcriptional regulation appears to have a role because egr-1 promoter-driven luciferase expression was reduced by ERK and JNK inhibitors. Promoter truncation experiments suggested that several serum response elements are required for MAPK-mediated egr-1 expression. Our study suggests that BCR signals reduce egr-1 expression by inhibiting activation of ERK and JNK. Unlike ERK and JNK, p38 MAPK reduces constitutive expression of egr-1. Unlike the immature B lymphoma cells, normal immature B cells did not exhibit constitutive MAPK activation. BCR-induced MAPK activation was modest and transient with a small increase in egr-1 expression in normal immature B cells consistent with their inability to proliferate in response to BCR cross-linking.

The immediate-early gene egr-1 (also known as NGFI-A, krox24, zif268, and tis8) encodes a transcription factor containing three tandem zinc finger motifs that bind to GC-rich DNA elements in the promoters of a range of target genes to activate their transcription (1Gashler A.

Moreover, Egr-1 is shown to be important for production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β, interleukin-13, and tumor necrosis factor as well as chemokines (18Yan S.F. Fujita T.

Monroe J.G. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), but its importance for subsequent B cell activation and proliferation is unknown. In contrast, BCR engagement in immature B lymphoma cells fails to induce egr-1 expression, and the lymphoma cells undergo growth inhibition and apoptosis (21Seyfert V.L. Sukhatme V.P. Monroe J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2083-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, BCR-induced positive versus negative signals are reflected in the differential expression of egr-1. Interestingly, an immature B lymphoma cell line (BKS-2) constitutively expresses high levels of Egr-1, and antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) to Egr-1 inhibit BKS-2 cell growth (14Muthukkumar S. Han S.S. Rangnekar V.M. Bondada S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27987-27993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). BCR signaling, which causes growth arrest and apoptosis of BKS-2 cells, also down-regulates egr-1 (14Muthukkumar S. Han S.S. Rangnekar V.M. Bondada S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27987-27993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The down-regulation of Egr-1 and growth inhibition caused by anti-IgM antibody are reversed by CpG ODN (22Han S.S. Chung S.T. Robertson D.A. Chelvarajan R.L. Bondada S. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 871-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These data suggest a positive correlation between the levels of Egr-1 and growth of B lymphoma cells. An examination of the microarray data published by Alizadeh et al. (23Alizadeh A.A. Eisen M.B. Davis R.E. Ma C. Lossos I.S. Rosenwald A. Boldrick J.C. Sabet H. Tran T. Yu X. Powell J.I. Yang L.

Brown P.O. Staudt L.M. Nature. 2000; 403: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (7841) Google Scholar) revealed that egr-1 expression is elevated in ∼35% of human diffuse large B lymphoma cells, supporting the notion that Egr-1 is important for B lymphoma cell growth. Several studies in different cell lines have shown that the rapid induction of Egr-1 with various stimuli is mediated through ERK1/2. In cardiomyocytes, estrogen induces the rapid induction of Egr-1 mRNA through activation of ERK1/2 (24de Jager T. Pelzer T. Muller-Botz S. Imam A. Muck J. Neyses L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27873-27880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In human monocytes, the rapid induction of Egr-1 by lipopolysaccharide is dependent on the Ras/Raf-1/MEK/ERK pathway (19Guha M. O'Connell M.A. Pawlinski R. Hollis A. McGovern P. Yan S.F. Stern D. Mackman N. Blood. 2001; 98: 1429-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In erythroleukemia cells, the erythropoietin-induced expression of egr-1 is mediated through the ERK1/2 pathway (25Schaefer A. Kosa F. Bittorf T. Magocsi M. Rosche A. RamirezChavez Y. Marotzki S. Marquardt H. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In T cell hybridoma, ERK activation is required for induction of egr-1 promoter activity by T cell receptor stimulation (26Xi H. Kersh G.J. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In splenic B cells, the induction of Egr-1 in response to BCR signaling is also mediated through the Ras/Raf-1/MAPK pathway (27McMahon S.B. Monroe J.G. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, factors that govern the constitutive expression of egr-1 in certain lymphoma cells or mechanisms that result in BCR-mediated down-regulation of Egr-1 are not known. Here, we found that constitutive expression of egr-1 in B lymphoma cells is dependent on constitutively active ERK and JNK pathways. The growth of B lymphoma cells is inhibited by blocking the Egr-1 upstream pathways (ERK and JNK) or inhibiting Egr-1 directly by retrovirus-mediated expression of the dominant-negative construct WT1-EGR1 (28Madden S.L. Cook D.M. Morris J.F. Gashler A. Sukhatme V.P. Rauscher III, F.J. Science. 1991; 253: 1550-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we found that Egr-1 expression is regulated by MAPK at the level of transcription and that the down-regulation of Egr-1 by BCR is through down-regulation of ERK and JNK activities. Reagents—The MEK1/2 inhibitors PD98059 and U0126 and the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 were purchased from Calbiochem. SP600125, an anthrapyrazolone inhibitor of JNK, was obtained as a gift from Dr. B. Bennett (Celgene, San Diego, CA). All three inhibitors were dissolved in Me2SO to make a 20 mm stock solution and diluted in culture medium before use. Phospho-specific antibodies against JNKs (Thr183/Tyr185), ERKs (Thr202/Tyr204), and p38 (Thr180/Tyr182) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA).

To create the p242luc construct, the egr-1 promoter sequence from –242 to +65 was PCR-amplified from the pBL395 vector, and the PCR fragment was treated with XhoI and SalI and ligated into the XhoI-treated pGL3b vector. To create the actin promoter-driven Renilla luciferase construct (pActinRluc), the Renilla luciferase gene was excised from the pRL-SV40 vector (Promega) by HindIII and BamHI enzyme digestions and ligated into the pHβ-Apr1 plasmid (a gift from Dr. Daret St. Clair, University of Kentucky) that had been treated with the same two enzymes. All DNA clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing. In experiments aimed at blocking egr-1 expression, a phosphorothioate-capped antisense Egr-1 ODN (AS2AS295, 5′-CTTGGCCGCTGCCAT-3′), a control phosphorothioate-capped nonsense Egr-1 ODN (NS281, 5′-GAGCGACCAGGCCCTACCGT-3′), and a phosphorothioate-capped antisense ODN against ICAM-1 (ISIS3082, 5′-TGCATCCCCCAGGCCACCAT-3′) were used. The antisense ODNs for Egr-1 and ICAM-1 have been described previously (35Santiago F.S. Atkins D.G. Khachigian L.M. Am. J.

Mice, Cell Lines, and Cell Preparation—Neonatal (9–11 days old) and young adult (2–3 months old) BALB/c mice were purchased from Harlan Sprague Dawley, Inc. (Indianapolis, IN). Female CBA/N (Xid) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions in micro-isolator cages. B cells were purified by two methods. For MAPK experiments, splenic cells were pooled from at least one litter of neonatal mice and purified by negative selection using magnetic cell sorter (MACS®)B cell enrichment MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbachor, Germany). As previously found in our laboratory (37Chelvarajan R.L. Gilbert N.L. Bondada S. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3315-3324PubMed Google Scholar), the splenic B cells from neonatal mice were predominantly immature B cells. The purified B cells were ∼90% B220 and AA4.1 double positive as determined by flow cytometry. The purified B cells were rested in IF-12 medium (1:1 mixture of Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium and Ham's F-12 medium) in a 37 °C incubator at 5% CO2 for 1 h and then treated with or without 20 μg/ml anti-IgM antibody for different time periods. Cells were harvested and lysed for Western blot analysis as described below. For Egr-1 RNA analysis, immature and mature B cells from neonatal and young adult mice, respectively, were enriched by panning with goat anti-IgM antibody immobilized on tissue culture-treated dishes as described previously (37Chelvarajan R.L. Gilbert N.L. Bondada S. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3315-3324PubMed Google Scholar). Purified B cells were treated with anti-IgM antibody for different time periods and harvested for RNA extraction as described below. The isolation and characterization of the immature B lymphoma cell line BKS-2 has been described (38Udhayakumar V. Brodeur P.H. Rajagopalan M.S. Zimmer S. Pollok K.E. Subbarao B. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1989; 51: 240-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, BKS-2 cells were grown in female CBA/N (Xid) mice as splenic tumors by intravenous injection. These cells attained maximal growth (2–6 × 108 cells/mouse spleen) in ∼7–10 days and were collected for experimental use at this stage. Depletion of host residual T cells was performed using a mixture of anti-Thy1.2, anti-CD4 (L3T4), and anti-CD8 (Lyt2) antibodies, followed by rabbit complement treatment as described previously (39Muthukkumar S. Udhayakumar V. Bondada S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 2419-2426Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). BKS-2 cells were cultured in IF-12 medium and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA). CH12.Lx lymphoma cells were obtained from Dr. Gail Bishop (University of Iowa) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS. Proliferation Assay—BKS-2 cells (3 × 104/well) were cultured in 96-well flat-bottom microtiter plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) in 200 μl of IF-12 medium and 10% FCS. Cultures were treated with varying doses of SP600125, PD68059, or SB203580 or an equivalent concentration of Me2SO; incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for a total of 48 h; and pulsed with 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) during the last 4 h of the culture period. The cells were harvested onto filter mats using a cell harvester (Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, CT). The levels of radionucleotide incorporation were measured with a Matrix 96 β-radiation counter (Hewlett-Packard, Downers Grove, IL). Results are presented as the means ± S.E. of triplicate cultures. The percent control response is defined as (cpm in the treated group/cpm in the untreated group) × 100. Retroviral Transfection of B Lymphoma Cells and Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter (FACS) Analysis—Retroviral vectors were transiently transfected into Phoenix-E packaging cells using the Lipofectamine Plus transfection system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Virus-containing supernatants were harvested from transfected Phoenix-E cells for transfection of B lymphoma cells. B lymphoma cells were washed and resuspended in serum-free Opti-MEM I (low serum medium; Invitrogen), and single cell suspensions at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml were spin-infected for 2 h at 30 °C in 2 ml of Polybrene (Sigma)-treated virus-containing supernatant (40Carleton M. Haks M.C. Smeele S.A. Jones A. Belkowski S.M. Berger M.A. Linsley P. Kruisbeek A.M. Wiest D.L. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1649-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). At the end of the 2-h infection period, the virus-containing supernatant was discarded, and fresh medium was added to the B lymphoma cells. For Western analysis, 5 × 106 cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection, and cell pellets were lysed in 100 μl of cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, l mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm PMSF). For proliferation assay, GFP+ cells were sorted by a FACS MoFlo flow cytometer (DakoCytomation, Fort Collins, CO) 72 h post-transfection and used as described above. Nuclear Run-on Assay—Nuclei were isolated from BKS-2 cells treated with or without anti-IgM antibody for 1 h, and nuclear run-on assay was performed as described previously (41Peterson M.L. Bertolino S. Davis F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5606-5615Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The newly synthesized mRNA molecules were labeled by incubating nuclei with [32P]UTP. Labeled RNA was hybridized to filters that had been cross-linked with Egr-1, c-Myc, or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA or the BlueScript empty vector. The amounts of nascent Egr-1, c-Myc, and GAPDH mRNAs present in cells upon different treatments were analyzed by dot blot analysis. The amounts of Egr-1 and c-Myc mRNAs were normalized to that of GAPDH mRNA. Western Blot Analysis—After different treatments, BKS-2 cells (4 × 106) were cultured at 1 × 106/ml in 6-well plates (Costar). Cell pellets were lysed in 90 μl of cell lysis buffer on ice for 30 min, and Western blotting was performed as described (14Muthukkumar S. Han S.S. Rangnekar V.M. Bondada S. J. Biol.

Blood. 2005; 106: 1382-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The blots were developed with Pico chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce) and exposed to Kodak X-Omat films, which were scanned with a Hewlett-Packard ScanJet 6300C flat-bed scanner. Alternatively, the blots were scanned by a Eastman Kodak Image Station 2000RT. For reprobing, membranes were stripped using a solution containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 62 °C for 10 min. The relative integrated absorbance of the protein bands was estimated using Scion Image software. Band intensities were normalized by dividing the intensity of phosphorylated protein by that of total protein or by dividing the intensity of the protein of interest by that of β-actin. Quantitative RT-PCR—After various treatments, BKS-2 cells (5 × 106) were used for RNA extraction with the QIAamp RNA blood mini kit (Qiagen Inc.). 2 μg of total RNA was used to make cDNA with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Real-time PCR was performed on an ABI Prism 7000 system using TaqMan-based egr-1-specific primers and probe (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The GAPDH- or β-actin-specific primers and probe were used to control for loading (Applied Biosystems). Transfection of Lymphoma Cells and Luciferase Assay—The egr-1-encoding plasmid pBX-Egr1 or various egr-1 promoter-driven firefly luciferase constructs (p903luc, p395luc, p242luc, and LucA–D) were introduced into BKS-2 cells by electroporation. For electroporation, BKS-2 cells were washed and resuspended in cold Opti-MEM I. The cells were then mixed with the indicated amount of DNA and electroporated at 250 mV, 960 microfarads, and 200 ohms with a Gene Pulser electroporator (Bio-Rad). For ectopic Egr-1 expression experiments, 1 day post-electroporation, BKS-2 cells transfected with pBX-Egr1 or a control vector were counted, and an equal number of cells with the indicated treatment were used to set up the proliferation assay as described. For luciferase assay, BKS-2 cells were washed once and rested at 37 °C in IF-12 medium containing 10% FCS for 1 h post-electroporation. After that, BKS-2 cells were plated at ∼1 × 105/well into 96-well flat-bottom microtiter plates in 200 μl of IF-12 medium containing 10% FCS with various treatments added and incubated at 37 °C for 6 h. Cells were spun down and lysed in the plate with 20 μl of cell lysis buffer at room temperature for 5 min. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured on an LMax luminometer (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA) using a firefly and Renilla luciferase assay kit (Biotium Inc., Hayward, CA). Inhibition of Egr-1 by Antisense ODNs or Retrovirus-mediated Expression of WT1-EGR1 Inhibits B Lymphoma Cell Growth—A previous study showed that egr-1 is constitutively expressed in BKS-2 lymphoma cells and that inhibition of egr-1 by specific antisense ODNs causes growth inhibition and apoptosis of BKS-2 (14Muthukkumar S. Han S.S. Rangnekar V.M. Bondada S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27987-27993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Because the antisense ODNs used in this study contained tetra-G motifs (GGGG) that could form triple helical structures leading to sequence-independent inhibition (42Tam R.C. Phan U.T. Milovanovic T. Pai B. Lim C. Bard J. He L. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 200-208PubMed Google Scholar, 43Agrawal S. Kandimalla E.R. Mol. Med. Today. 2000; 6: 72-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we used two additional approaches to study the importance of Egr-1 for lymphoma cell growth. First, an egr-1-specific antisense ODN without the tetra-G motif was used. Western blot analysis showed that the Egr-1 antisense ODN caused a reduction in endogenous Egr-1 protein (Fig. 1A, inset). Cell proliferation measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation showed that this Egr-1 antisense ODN inhibited the growth of BKS-2 cells (Fig. 1A). Used as controls, both an Egr-1 nonsense ODN and an antisense ODN against ICAM-1 did not cause growth inhibition of BKS-2 cells. Second, retrovirus-mediated expression of WT1-EGR1, a dominant-negative inhibitor of Egr-1 containing the repressor domain from the Wilms tumor gene and the three zinc finger DNA-binding motifs from Egr-1 (28Madden S.L. Cook D.M. Morris J.F. Gashler A. Sukhatme V.P. Rauscher III, F.J. Science. 1991; 253: 1550-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), inhibited the basal proliferation of both BKS-2 (Fig. 1B) and CH12.Lx (Fig. 1C) lymphoma cells. Western blot analyses using an antibody against the N-terminal domain of WT1 protein detected the expression of a ∼45-kDa protein, corresponding to the molecular mass of WT1-EGR1, in both BKS-2 and CH12.Lx cell lines transfected with the WT1-EGR1-encoding retrovirus, but not with the GFP-only control vector (Fig. 1, B and C). Interestingly, irrespective of the WT1-EGR1 protein expression status, Egr-1 protein was expressed in both BKS-2 and CH12.Lx cells (Fig. 1, B and C). The level of Egr-1 was slightly reduced upon WT-EGR1 expression. Because WT1-EGR1 is a functional inhibitor of Egr-1 (inhibits the downstream targets of Egr-1), it may indirectly inhibit egr-1 expression. These two experiments firmly establish the importance of Egr-1 for B lymphoma cell growth. Up-regulation of Egr-1 by Phorbol 12-Myristate 13-Acetate (PMA) Rescues BCR-mediated Growth Inhibition of BKS-2 Cells—Anti-IgM antibody-mediated cross-linking of BCR induces growth arrest and apoptosis of several immature B lymphoma cells, including BKS-2 (38Udhayakumar V.

The amino-terminal domain of collagen type XI α1 chain is a noncollagenous structure that has been identified on the surface of cartilage collagen fibrils. The biochemical composition of the amino-terminal domain varies due to alternative splicing of the primary transcript. Recombinantly expressed α1(XI) aminoterminal domain isoforms were used in this study to investigate potential interactions. Purified products were analyzed for heparan sulfate binding properties. The results demonstrated that two additional binding sites exist within the α1(XI) aminoterminal domain, one within the amino propeptide and one within the variable region of the amino-terminal domain. Analysis of relative affinities indicated that the site located within the amino propeptide (site 1) was of similar affinity to sites that exist within the major triple helix of collagen type XI. Substitution of amino acid residues 147 to 152 within the amino propeptide by site-directed mutagenesis resulted in altered affinity for heparan sulfate. The binding site located within the variable region (site 2) demonstrated significantly higher affinity than other sites within the molecule. Displacement of collagen type XI within the pericellular matrix was observed in cell culture in the presence of excess heparan sulfate and by treatment with heparinase. These studies suggest two additional binding sites located within the noncollagenous amino-terminal domain that may play a role in the function of collagen type XI. The localization of collagen type XI within the pericellular matrix may be dependent upon interactions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and these are likely to take place in an isoform-specfic manner.

Collagens represent an extensive family of proteins that are found in the extracellular matrix. Collagens are assembled from α chains of which there have been reported at least 41 genetically distinct proteins comprising 28 different collagen types (1Boot-Handford R.P. Tuckwell D.S. Plumb D.A.

All collagen family members are modular proteins characterized by regions of triple helix yet differ with respect to the combination and location of the nontriple helical domains present. Collagen type XI, composed of α1, α2, and α3 chains, appears to be concentrated pericellularly and plays a role in the regulation of fibrillogenesis (4Li Y. Laccerda D.A. Warman M.L. Beier D.R. Yoshioka H. Ninomiya Y. Oxford J.T. Morris N.P. Andrikopoulos K. Ramirez F. Wardell B.B. Lifferth G.D. Teuscher C. Woodward S.R. Taylor B.A. Seegmiller R.E. Olsen B.R.

The presence of collagen type XI correlates to the location of thin collagen fibrils within the pericellular matrix (6Smith Jr., G.N. Hasty K.A. Brandt K.D. Matrix. 1989; 9: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The α1 and α2 chains of collagen type XI each contain homologous noncollagenous amino-terminal structures that comprise two separate regions: an amino propeptide (Npp) 2The abbreviations used are: Npp, amino propeptide; VR, variable region; NTD, amino-terminal domain; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HS, horse serum; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; TX, Triton X-100; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. 2The abbreviations used are: Npp, amino propeptide; VR, variable region; NTD, amino-terminal domain; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HS, horse serum; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; TX, Triton X-100; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. and a variable region (VR). Together, the Npp and the variable region make up the amino-terminal domain (NTD) of the collagen α1(XI) chain. The α3 chain of collagen type XI is the gene product of Col2a1 and contains an amino-terminal domain that is distinct from the α1 and α2 chains (7Ryan M.C. Sieraski M. Sandell L.J. Genomics. 1990; 8: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Within the NTD portion of α1 and α2, the Npp domain demonstrates similarity to a domain found in laminin, neurexin, and sex hormone binding globulin (the LNS family members) and originally identified as the Thsp1 or TSPN domain of thrombospondin (8Bork P.

Although the Npp domain shares features with other modular extracellular proteins, an understanding of the function of this domain is still incomplete. The VR connects the Npp domain to the minor triple helix (13Oxford J.T. Doege K.J. Morris N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9478-9485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The VR of the α1 and α2 chains possesses unique biochemical characteristics determined by alternative splicing of the mRNA (14Zhidkova N.I. Justice S.K. Mayne R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9486-9493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). While the Col2a1 mRNA undergoes alternative splicing which results in two splice variants, the alternative splicing of three exons in Col11a1 is predicted to generate eight splice variants (7Ryan M.C. Sieraski M. Sandell L.J. Genomics. 1990; 8: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 13Oxford J.T. Doege K.J. Morris N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9478-9485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The individual splice variants are expressed during development and growth with unique tissue, temporal, and spatial specificities (16Morris N.P. Oxford J.T. Davies G.B.M. Smoody B.F. Keene D.R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 48: 725-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Of the eight potential isoforms, three are most prevalent within cartilage tissue during fetal development and growth (17Davies G.B.M. Oxford J.T. Hausafus L.C. Smoody B.F. Morris N.P. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 213: 12-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In contrast, the splice variants of the α2 chain are present very early in differentiation but rapidly converge to a single splice variant that persists in developing cartilage (18Tsumaki N. Kimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2372-2378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Isoform-specific functions may result from the differences in size and electrostatic characteristics of the individual splice variants during skeletal development, particularly in the case of the α1 chain that demonstrates sustained expression of several variants throughout development and growth. After biosynthesis and secretion to the extracellular environment, the Npp of the α1 and α2 chains may be proteolytically processed. The Npp of the α2 chain is removed rapidly and completely after synthesis while the Npp of the α1 chain is processed more slowly (19Thom J.R. Morris N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7262-7269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro processing takes place at an isoform-specific rate and to different extents (20Medeck R.J. Sosa S. Morris N. Oxford J.T. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 361-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The collagen α1(XI) Npp may still be detected on the surface of thin collagen fibrils of cartilage extracellular matrix by immuno-TEM (21Keene D.R. Oxford J.T. Morris N.P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1995; 43: 967-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and on intact collagen molecules by immunoblot (17Davies G.B.M. Oxford J.T. Hausafus L.C. Smoody B.F. Morris N.P. Dev.

Collagen type XI, as well as the closely related collagen type V, have been implicated in the regulation of collagen fibril growth. This activity may be mechanistically linked to the NTD, primarily by steric hindrance, although this domain may also be the site of interaction with other constituents of the extracellular matrix. The location of the NTD of collagen α1(XI) on the surface of thin heterotypic cartilage collagen fibrils (21Keene D.R. Oxford J.T. Morris N.P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1995; 43: 967-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) makes this domain a candidate binding site for such interactions. In vitro studies have established that glycosaminoglycans, particularly heparan sulfate, interact with the major triple helix of collagen type XI (22Smith G Jr N. Brandt K.D. Collagen Rel. Res. 1987; 7: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The interaction of pepsinized collagen type XI with heparan sulfate and/or other glycosaminoglycans has been shown to involve more than one site within the major triple helix (23Vaughan-Thomas A. Young R.D. Phillips A.C. Duance V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5303-5309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Heparin binding activity has also been described for the amino-terminal domain of the closely related α3 and α4 chains of collagen type V (24Chernousov M.A. Rothblum K. Tyler W.A. Stahl R.C.

Yoshioka H. Matrix Biol. 2005; 24: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the present work, we describe the production and purification of recombinant isoforms of the NTD of collagen α1(XI) and identification of two additional heparan sulfate binding sites within the noncollagenous region. We also describe the individual substitution of four lysine residues by site-directed mutagenesis and the resulting changes in binding affinity for heparan sulfate. Furthermore, isoform-specific interaction properties determined by the nature of the variable region are presented. The NTD of α1(XI) may mediate interactions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans of the extracellular matrix or the cell surface contributing to the regulation of extracellular matrix organization and collagen fibrillogenesis. Construction and Expression of the NTD α1(XI) Collagen Expression Vector—The NTD α1(XI) collagen sequences from rat were amplified and cloned as previously described (20Medeck R.J. Sosa S. Morris N. Oxford J.T. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 361-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant isoforms were expressed in BL21 (DE3) Escherichia coli cells (Novagen, Madison, WI) using the pET11a bacterial expression vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The cells were grown in either small batch of one liter or in large batches in a 100-liter fermentor (Biostat 100D, Sartorius BBI, Bethlehem, PA). Expression was induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at an A600 of 0.05 to 1.0. Two hours after induction, the cells were collected in a Sorvall high speed centrifuge or, in the case of large scale batches, a continuous flow centrifuge (Sharples AS-14, Alfa Laval, Richmond, VA). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Residues Lys-147, Lys-148, Lys-149, and Lys-152 were altered to alanine using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). The expression vector, pET11aVO, was mutagenized using two complimentary oligonucleotide primers that introduced the desired mutations by changing the codons for lysine to alanine (Table 1). PfuTurbo DNA polymerase was used to generate the mutated plasmid, followed by DpnI treatment to digest the parental template and select mutation-containing DNA. Following transformation of E. coli XL1-Blue supercompetent cells and clonal selection, clones were amplified, purified (Novagen Mobius1000), and sequenced in both directions to confirm the desired mutation and the absence of unwanted mutations. Sequencing reactions were performed at the Molecular Research Core Facility, Idaho State University (Pocatello, ID). The mutagenized plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells containing the T7 RNA polymerase gene under the control of the lac promoter/operator for expression. The recombinant proteins were collected after the induction of the promoter by 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Nomenclature for the mutated recombinant plasmids and proteins follows standard guidelines, e.g. pET11aVOK147A and α1(XI)VOK147A.TABLE 1Mutagenic primer pairsWild typepET11aVO5′-GACAATGATTGTCGATTGTAAGAAGAAAATCACAAAGCCCCTCGATAGAAG-3′Mutagenic primer pair K147ACMB226S5′-GACAATGATTGTCGATTGTGCGAAGAAAATCACAAAGCCCCTCGATAGAAG-3′CMB227A5′-CTTCTATCGAGGGGCTTTGTGATTTTCTTCGCACAATCGACAATCATTGTC-3′Mutagenic primer pair K148ACMB228S5′-GACAATGATTGTCGATTGTAAGGCGAAAATCACAAAGCCCCTCGATAGAAG-3′CMB229A5′-CTTCTATCGAGGGGCTTTGTGATTTTCGCCTTACAATCGACAATCATTGTC-3′Mutagenic primer pair K149ACMB230S5′-GACAATGATTGTCGATTGTAAGAAGGCAATCACAAAGCCCCTCGATAGAAG-3′CMB231A5′-CTTCTATCGAGGGGCTTTGTGATTGCCTTCTTACAATCGACAATCATTGTC-3′Mutagenic primer pair K152ACMB232S5′-GACAATGATTGTCGATTGTAAGAAGAAAATCACAGCGCCCCTCGATAGAAG-3′CMB233A5′-CTTCTATCGAGGGGCGCTGTGATTTTCTTCTTACAATCGACAATCATTGTC-3′ Open table in a new tab Purification and Refolding of NTD α1(XI) Collagen Recombinant Proteins—Cells were lysed by resuspension in a hypotonic detergent solution (B-PER, Pierce). Inclusion bodies were separated from soluble proteins by differential centrifugation and washed in 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.6. Inclusion body proteins were solubilized in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.6, containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and 80 mm NaCl. Solubilized proteins were clarified by centrifugation at 18,000 × g, 4 °C for 30 min and applied to a nickelnitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) column at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Absorbance at 280 nm and conductivity were monitored throughout purification. Bound protein was eluted using 250 mm imidazole. Protein in each fraction was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining. Proteins were purified to 97% homogeneity. After refolding as previously described (26Gregory K.E. Oxford J.T. Chen Y. Gambee J.E. Gygi S.P. Aebersold R. Neame P.J. Mechling D.E. Bachinger H.P. Morris N.P. J. Biol.

Purification of α1(XI) Collagen Triple Helical Domain—Collagen type XI was extracted and purified from the hyaline cartilage harvested from the ends of long bones of fetal bovine hind and forelimbs (Gem Meat, Garden City, ID) as described previously (27Mayne R. van der Rest M. Bruckner P. Schmid T. Haralson M.A. Hassell J.R. Extracellular Matrix: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 73-97Google Scholar). Briefly, collagen types II, IX, and XI were selectively precipitated from the homogenate by differential salt precipitation using 0.5 m CH3COOH, containing 0.9, 1.2, and 2.0 m NaCl, respectively. Only collagen type XI was used in this study. Heparin Affinity Chromatography—Recombinant splice variants and pepsinized type XI collagen major triple helix were dialyzed against 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl. Samples were applied to a heparin-agarose (Sigma) column. Protein was eluted from the column during a linear concentration gradient of NaCl. Absorbance at 280 nm and conductivity were monitored continuously throughout the experiment. Fractions were collected and protein composition was monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining to determine the concentration of NaCl required for displacement of the protein. Circular Dichroism—Purified recombinant isoforms were dialyzed extensively against 0.02 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, with 0.1 m NaF. Each sample was analyzed in the far-UV range (260-178 nm) at 4 °C by CD spectroscopy on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter. Protein samples were examined in a circular demountable 0.01-mm path length Supracil cell with a total volume of 18 μl (catalog number 124-QS 0.01 mm, Hellma, Plainview, NY). Three spectra and three base lines were collected at 1-nm intervals over the wavelength range from 270 to 178 nm at 4 °C. The high tension never exceeded 500 V. For these experiments, the concentration of each sample was determined in triplicate by amino acid analysis. Samples were gas-phase-hydrolyzed using 300 μ l of 6 n HCl, 2% phenol at 110 °C for 22 h, and the hydrolysates were analyzed on a Beckman 6300 amino acid analyzer using sodium citrate buffers (AAA Services Laboratory, Boring, OR). As an alternative method, protein concentration was also determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm in 6 m guanidinium HCl with molar extinction coefficients calculated using ProtParam (28Gasteiger E.

Heparan sulfate was diluted to a 10 mg/ml stock in 18 mΩ water. The instrument was calibrated using d(+)-camphor sulfonic acid (Sigma) at 192 and 290 nm. CD Spectral Analysis—CD spectra were processed using CDtool software (29Lees J.G. Smith B.R. Wien F. Miles A.J. Wallace B.A. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 332: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The spectra were averaged and base lines subtracted and smoothed with a Savitsky-Golay filter (30Savitsky A. Golay M.J.E. Anal. Chem. 1964; 36: 1627-1639Crossref Scopus (14337) Google Scholar) with a smoothing window of seven. The calculated Δϵ values were determined using the mean residue weight value calculated from its sequence and calibrated to d(+)-camphor sulfonic acid.

Heparan Sulfate Activation—Heparan sulfate (Sigma) was diluted to 0.5 mg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0. Sodium periodate was added to a final concentration of 3 mg/ml. The solution was allowed to react for 30 min at room temperate in the absence of light with gentle agitation. Conjugation of Heparan Sulfate to Hydrazide-modified Surface—The activated heparan sulfate was diluted to 20 μg/ml in 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, and 100 μl added to each well of a 96-well Carbo-BIND plate (Corning). The plate was incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the absence of light. Plates were rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (PBST). Blocking and deactivation of any nonreacted hydrazide groups was accomplished with 1% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.2. Plates were rinsed once with PBS. Protein solution was diluted to 1 mg/ml in PBS, 10% horse serum. Serial dilutions of the protein of interest were performed to cover a range from 1 to 0.02 mg/ml. Aliquots of 100 μl per well were added and allowed to incubate for 30 min at 37 °C. Wells were rinsed three times with PBS prior to the addition of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-horseradish peroxidase conjugate in PBS with 10% horse serum to each well. After an overnight incubation at 4 °C, the wells were rinsed three times with PBS and incubated for 40 min with the horseradish peroxidase substrate 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine. To stop the reaction, 0.3 m sulfuric acid was added, and absorbance was measured at 450 nm. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad software, San Diego, CA) with a user-specifid equation. The Hill equation, Y = ((Bmax)*(Xn))/((Kd,n) + (Xn)), was used to fit the fractional binding saturation data, where n is a measure for the extent of cooperativity, with n > 1 indicative of positive cooperativity. Cell Culture Conditions—A cell line was derived in our laboratory from the Swarm rat chondrosarcoma (39Choi H.U. Meyer K. Swarm R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To allow the observation of newly synthesized pericellular matrix, cells were treated with 0.02% (w/v) collagenase 1A (Sigma) for 8 min followed by 0.25% trypsin/EDTA for 5 min immediately before plating. Cells were plated at 3.5 × 104 cells/cm2 onto poly-dlysine/laminin-coated chamber slides (BD Biosciences) and incubated in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 μg/ml ascorbate 2-phosphate, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Accumulated pericellular matrix was analyzed 48 h after plating by indirect immunofluorescence. Cells were grown in the presence of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1 unit/ml heparinase III to determine optimum concentration by monitoring the depletion of heparan sulfate by indirect immunofluorescence using a heparan sulfate-specific monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Charlottesville, VA). Experiments were carried out with 1 unit/ml heparinase III or 100 μg/ml heparan sulfate as indicated in the figure legends of Figs. 7 and 8.FIGURE 8Diminished pericellular p6b staining upon heparinase III treatment. Cells were maintained in culture for 48 h during which pericellular matrix was allowed to assemble in the absence or presence of heparinase III. In the presence of 1 unit/ml heparinase III, mAbp6b showed a decreased level of staining in the pericellular matrix. No alteration was observed in the staining pattern of the major triple helix or Npp of collagen type XI. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue).

The slides were rinsed in 50 mm Tris-buffered saline (TBS) and then permeabilized in TBS-0.5% Triton X-100 (TX) for 10 min. The slides were washed three times for 5 min in TBS-0.1% TX, followed by blocking in TBS-0.1% TX, 2% bovine serum albumin for 10 min. After incubation with the primary antibody, cells were washed five times for 5 min in TBS-0.1% TX. Secondary antibody, rhodamine (TRITC)-conjugated AffiniPure donkey anti-rabbit IgG or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA), diluted 1:100 in TBST, was applied to slides and incubated for 1 h in a humidified chamber at 37 °C. The slides were then washed three times for 5 min in TBS-0.1% TX and incubated in 3.0 μg/ml of DAPI for 10 min (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The slides were washed three times 5 min in TBS-0.1% TX, rinsed in TBS, drained, mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and sealed. For microscopic observation and photomicrography of the fluorescently labeled cells, an Olympus BX60 fluorescence microscope equipped with a PM-10AD system was used. The fluorescent molecules were excited with a 100-watt mercury lamp. TRITC- or fluorescein isothiocyanatelabeled molecules were detected with a filter set having 510-560 nm wavelength bandpass, 565 nm dichroic beamsplitter, and 575-645-nm emission filters. Collagens are modular proteins, comprising distinct domains in addition to the collagenous major triple helix. The α1 chain within the collagen type XI triple helical molecule is shown schematically in Fig. 1 as a linear array of domains. The Npp of the α2 chain is rapidly removed after synthesis while the α3 chain (primarily type IIB) is very short and does not undergo further processing (7Ryan M.C. Sieraski M. Sandell L.J.

To investigate the pathophysiology of cancer cachexia and pursue treatment options, we developed an in vitro assay of the effects of cancer cell-produced cytokines on primary muscle cells derived from murine skeletal muscle. These studies led to the novel observation that factors secreted by cell lines from prostate cancer and melanoma significantly inhibit differentiation of primary mouse muscle cells. The expression of interleukin (IL) -1beta, TNF-alpha, and proteolysis-inducing factor (PIF) by cancer cells used in this study suggested their role in preventing myogenic differentiation. Both NF-kappaB binding and transcriptional activity were enhanced in muscle cells treated with conditioned media from cancer cells or with proinflammatory cytokines. Stable expression of IKBSR, a known repressor of NF-kappaB activation, and cellular caspase-8-like inhibitory protein (cFLIP) inhibited activation of NF-kappaB in cancer cell media-treated muscle cells with an accompanying enhancement of myogenic protein expression and differentiation. In contrast, overexpression of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL did not protect myoblast cells exposed to the same treatment. Instead, we observed enhanced activation of NF-kappaB in Bcl-xL overexpressing cells. These studies show that the in vitro system recapitulates some of the molecular events causing muscle cachexia and provides the basis for new treatment approaches."

GPCRs possess a characteristic seven transmembrane domains linked by three extracellular and three intracellular loops. Interaction of agonist with the receptor initiates conformational changes within the receptor that are propagated to intracellular domains of the receptor, resulting in G protein activation and initiation of intracellular events. A long-term objective of our research effort is to define factors that influence the specificity and efficiency of signal propagation from GPCRs to G protein and perhaps function in the context of a larger signal transduction complex. Such proteins may influence receptor targeting to specific subcellular compartments, assembly of the receptor into functional complexes (i.e. receptosomes), and receptor trafficking to and from the plasma membrane as well as effector activation (1Sato M. Blumer J.B. Simon V. Lanier S.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2006; 46: 151-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 2Bockaert J. Fagni L. Dumuis A. Marin P. Pharmacol. Ther. 2004; 103: 203-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar).The third intracellular loop (i3 loop) and the carboxyl terminus tail of the receptor are key sites for signal initiation and termination for most members of GPCRs. These regions can be of considerable size and represent potential sites for protein interaction.Carboxyl-terminal domains of GPCRs contain discrete motifs that efficiently interact with cellular proteins such as the PDZ (PSD95-disc large-Zonula occludens) recognition motif (3Bockaert J. Marin P. Dumuis A. Fagni L. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar).

The binding of Gβγ to the i3 loop results in formation of a ternary complex consisting of the i3 loop, Gβγ, and G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2, postulated to position the enzyme on its substrate. In addition to its role in receptor regulation, the interaction of Gβγ or arrestin with the i3 loop may also facilitate the interface of GPCRs to diverse signaling pathways via complex formation with additional Gβγ- and arrestin-binding proteins. Other proteins including calmodulin, RGS2, and casein kinase 1α also interact with the M2-i3 and/or M3-i3 loops (9Bernstein L.S. Ramineni S. Hague C. Cladman W. Chidiac P. Levey A.I. Hepler J.R. J.

Casein kinase 1α phosphorylates the M3-MR controlling the magnitude of M3 muscarinic signaling.The i3 loop does not generally contain obvious predicted binding motifs or structural properties other than the two α helixes located at the juxtamembrane regions of the i3 loop. The small number of proteins interacting with the i3 loop relative to the carboxyl-terminal tail of GPCRs may be due to the weakness of the interaction itself and/or limited sensitivity of techniques used to isolate binding proteins.As part of a broader effort to define protein complexes with the i3 loop, we initially used the i3 loop of the M2-MR, which is characterized by a larger i3 loop (180 amino acids), as a GST fusion protein to isolate binding partners from brain lysates. We took advantage of recent technologies that enhance sensitivity for detecting specific interactions utilizing fluorescent protein labeling and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Using this approach we report the identification of the protein SET as a surprising binding partner with the i3 loop of M2-MR. SET, also called template-activating factor I, was first identified as a partner of the SET-CAN fusion gene, a putative oncogene associated with an acute undifferentiated leukemia (12von Lindern M. van Baal S. Wiegant J. Raap A. Hagemeijer A. Grosveld G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3346-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). SET is reported to regulate transcription and inhibit protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) (13Li M. Makkinje A. Damuni Z. J. Biol.

Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), which may be of particular interest for receptor regulation and signaling. In this study we report that SET directly interacts with the i3 loop of the M2- and M3-MRs, co-immunoprecipitates with intact receptor expressed in cells and specifically inhibits M3-MR-dependent signaling. These data suggest that SET/i3 loop interaction within the M3-MR leads to reduced signaling capacity for the receptor, providing an unexpected mode of regulation for GPCR coupling to downstream signaling pathways.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRecombinant Protein Preparations—The cDNAs encoding the i3 loop of the human M2- and rat M3-MRs (His208-Arg387 and Arg252-Gln490, respectively) were subcloned into pGEX-2T or pGEX-4T-1 vectors, respectively (4Wu G.

Immobilized fusion proteins were stored at 4 °C, and each batch of fusion proteins used for experiments was first analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The full-length encoding sequence of human SET cloned into the pQE30 vector was kindly provided by Dr. R. Z. Qi (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology). The His-tagged SET protein was expressed in M15 bacteria and purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Protein Interaction Assays—Rat brains were homogenized on ice with a Dounce homogenizer in 3 ml of hypotonic lysis buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA)/g of tissue. All buffers contained a protease inhibitor mixture (1 tablet/10 ml, Complete Mini, EDTA-free, Roche Diagnostics). The tissue homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to generate a cytosolic fraction. To reduce nonspecific interactions with GST alone or glutathione resin, brain cytosol was pre-cleared by successive incubations with GST bound to the glutathione-Sepharose 4B matrix followed by an incubation with the glutathione-Sepharose 4B matrix alone (Fig. 1A). Pre-cleared brain cytosol (20 mg) was diluted 5 times (4 mg/ml) in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with GST or GST-M2-i3 (∼400 nm) pre-complexed with the glutathione-Sepharose 4B matrix (40 μl). Resins were then washed 2 times with 5 ml of buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl followed by 2 washes in the same buffer without NaCl. Bound proteins were eluted with 35 μl of 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, and 4% CHAPS by rotation for 2 h at 4°C.Two-dimensional Fluorescence Difference Gel Electrophoresis—Brain cytosol proteins eluted from GST or GST-M2-i3 resins were labeled with 400 pmol of the CyDye fluorochromes Cy2 or Cy5, respectively (GE Healthcare), by coupling of the dye to ϵNH2 group of lysine residues in a volume of 35 μl. The stoichiometry of CyDye labeling is specifically intended to achieve a minimal labeling of lysines (1-2% of all proteins). As an additional control, proteins eluted from GST-M2-i3 resin alone were labeled with Cy3. Labeling was performed on ice in the dark at pH 8.5 for 30 min incubation, after which the reaction was quenched by the addition of 1 μl of 10 mm lysine for 10 min. An equal volume of rehydration buffer (30 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 130 mm dithiothreitol) containing 2% Bio-Lyte 3/10 ampholytes (Bio-Rad) was added, and samples were incubated at 24 °C for 10 min. The three samples labeled with Cy2, Cy3, or Cy5 were combined in the presence of an equal volume of DeStreak (GE Healthcare), and proteins were separated on first and second dimensions.Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—Proteins were first separated according to their isoelectric point along a linear immobilized pH-gradient strip (pH 3-10, 24 cm long) using the PROTEAN IEF cell (Bio-Rad). Sample loading was performed by active in-gel re-swelling (50 V), and protein separated by applying the following parameters: 200 V for 3 h and 1000 V for 4 h gradient; 8000 V for 8 h gradient; 8000 V for 4 h; 200 V for 48 h. After the first dimension the immobilized pH-gradient strips were equilibrated for 15 min in a buffer containing 6 m urea, 0.375 mm Tris, pH 8.8, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, 2% dithiothreitol, and then for 15 min in the same buffer containing 2.5% iodoacetamide in place of dithiothreitol. For the second dimension, the strips were loaded onto manual cast 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide DALT gels (GE Healthcare). Proteins were separated using the following parameters: 30 min at 5 watts/gel and 4 h at 17 watts/gel. After electrophoresis gels were fixed in a solution of 7% acetic acid and 10% methanol for 30 min.Image Acquisition and Two-dimensional Gel Spot Pattern Analysis—Fluorophore-labeled protein gels were scanned using a Typhoon 9400 Variable Mode Imager at 100 μm resolution, with the photomultiplier tube set in the 425-500 V range (GE Healthcare). CyDyes are optimally detected using the following wavelength settings: Cy2, excitation 488 nm, emission 520 nm; Cy3, excitation 532 nm, emission 580 nm; Cy5, excitation 633 nm, emission 670 nm. Spot detection and quantification were performed using the DeCyder differential analysis software DIA, Version 5.0 (GE Healthcare). Gels were then post-stained with Sypro Ruby, and images were captured again using a Typhoon 9400 Variable Mode Imager. Protein spots of interest were excised using the Ettan Spot Handling Work station with a 2-mm diameter spot-picking head (GE Healthcare).Protein Identification by Matrix-assisted Laser-desorption Ionization Time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) Mass Spectrometry—Gel plugs were destained by incubation in 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 50% acetonitrile (3 times, 30 min each) followed by dehydration with 100% acetonitrile (20 min). Dehydrated gel plugs were automatically digested via the Spot Handling Work station (GE Healthcare) in-gel with 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate solution containing 20 ng/ml porcine modified trypsin protease (Promega). The tryptic peptide mixtures were extracted from the gel plugs in 2 cycles of 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and dried by evaporation. Peptides were reconstituted in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and mixed with an equal volume of 10 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid for spotting in duplicate onto a MALDI plate.MALDI-TOF-mass spectrometry and tandem TOF/TOF mass spectrometry were performed on a Voyager 4700 (Applied BioSystems). Ions specific for each sample (discrete from background and trypsin-derived ions) were then used to interrogate sequences entered in the SWISS-PROT and NCBI non-redundant databases using MASCOT. Tandem mass spectrometry was used to generate limited amino acid sequence information on selected ions if additional confirmation was required. Searches were performed without constraining protein molecular weight or isoelectric point and allowed for carbamidomethylation of cysteine, partial oxidation of methionine residues, and one missed trypsin cleavage. Highest confidence identifications have a statistically significant search score(s) and are consistent with the gel region from which the protein was excised (Mr and pI).GST Pulldown Assay with Purified SET—Human recombinant His-tagged SET protein (30 nm) was gently mixed for 1 h at 4 °C with GST-M2-i3, GST-M3-i3 (full-length or truncated fragments), or GST fusion proteins (∼300 nm) bound to the glutathione-Sepharose 4B (12.5 μl) in 750 μl of buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors). Resins were washed 3 times with 500 μl of buffer B. The retained proteins were eluted from the resin with 25 μl of 5× loading buffer, placed in a boiling water bath for 5 min, and applied to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Separated proteins were then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and process for immunoblotting with a polyclonal anti-SET antibody (1:1000) kindly provided by Dr. T. D. Copeland (15Adachi Y. Pavlakis G.N. Copeland T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2258-2262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (NCI-Frederick, National Institutes of Health). Membranes were systematically re-probed with an anti-GST antibody (1:5000, GE Healthcare) to confirm equal amounts of GST fusion proteins and to control for protein loading.Immunoprecipitation—100-mm dishes of COS-7 cells were transfected with 12 μg of empty vector (pcDNA3) or 12 μg of pcDNA3::M3MR with Lipofectamine 2000 according to manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). After 72 h cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and incubated on ice for 1 h. The lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and precleared with Gamma-Bind Sepharose (GE Healthcare). The precleared lysates (5 mg of protein in 1 ml of lysis buffer) were incubated with 25 μl of monoclonal M3-MR antibody overnight at 4 °C. Gamma-Bind G-Sepharose (12.5 μl) was added, and incubation was continued for 1 h. The resin was pelleted, washed 3 times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, resuspended in 2× protein sample buffer, and incubated at room temperature for 30 min followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with polyclonal anti-M3MR antibody (provided by Dr. Jurgen Wess, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda) (16Zeng F.Y. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19487-19497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and SET antibody. Confluent 100-mm plates of CHO cells stably expressing the M3-MR (CHO-M3, ∼400 fmol/mg protein) and control CHO cells were lysed and processed for M3-MR immunoprecipitation as described above.The mouse monoclonal M3-MR antibody was generated against the mouse M3-MR third intracellular loop (Arg252-Thr491) purified as a GST fusion protein (17Tobin A.B. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9817-9823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and prepared by Harlan Sera Labs (United Kingdom). The antibody recognizes the rat, mouse, and human M3-MR. siRNA-mediated Gene Silencing of SET—siRNA duplexes 5′-CCAUCCACAAGUGUCUGCACUGCUU (bp 327-351) and 5′-CCGAAAUCAAAUGGAAAUCUGGAAA (bp 530-554) targeted to the human SET mRNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number D45198) were selected based upon optimal sequences as predicted by computational programs provided by Invitrogen. Control CHO cells and CHO-M3 cells at 30-40% confluency were transfected with a combination of SET siRNA duplexes (bp 327-351 and 530-554) using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). In control experiments cells were transfected with the corresponding predicted oligonucleotide control for the siRNA duplex bp 327-351 (5′-CCAACACGUGAGUCUUCACGCUCUU) together with a random low GC oligonucleotide control provided by Invitrogen. The transfection mixture was removed 5 h later and replaced by F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen).To assess SET siRNA knockdown, cells were homogenized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40) and incubated for 1 h on ice. Cell homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C, and 12.5 μg of the supernatant were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Expression of SET was assessed by immunoblotting with a polyclonal anti-SET antibody. The specificity of the knockdown for SET was validated by reprobing blots with antisera to α-actin (Chemicon international) and Gq.The Gq antibody was generated against the carboxyl-terminal 10 amino acids of Gq (QLNLKEYNLV) cross-linked to KLH via a cysteine added to the amino terminus when the peptide was synthesized. Rabbits were immunized with the conjugate, and the antibody was purified on a protein A-Sepharose resin (GE Healthcare) (18Arthur J.M. Collinsworth G.P. Gettys T.W. Quarles L.D. Raymond J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F129-F135PubMed Google Scholar).Measurement of Cell Calcium Content—To evaluate receptor-effector coupling, we determined the ability of agonist to increase intracellular calcium in CHO control and CHO-M3 cells using a fluorometric imaging plate reader system (Molecular Devices Corp.). Seventy-two hours after siRNA transfection, CHO-M3 cells were seeded in F-12 medium containing 2% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (35,000 cell/100 μl/well) in 96-well clear-bottomed black microplates (Corning Costar Corp.) precoated with 100 μg/ml poly-d-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich). Four hours later cells were dye-loaded (FLIPR calcium 3 assay kit, Molecular Devices) with 100 μl of the dyeloading buffer containing 2.5 mm probenecid for 1 h at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator. During a data run cells in different wells were exposed to different concentrations of drugs, and the system recorded fluorescent signals for all 96 wells simultaneously every 5 s for 5 min. Increases in intracellular calcium were observed as sharp peaks above the basal fluorescent levels typically 10 s after drug addition. The increases in intracellular calcium levels were determined by subtracting the base-line to the peak values (heights). Data were plotted, and t½ to peak values and for signal decay were determined using Graphpad Prism (version 4.0). Data are representative of 4-7 independent experiments; the data point for any drug concentration is an average from 3 to 4 wells.Quantification of Cell Surface M3-muscarinic Receptor—Cell surface receptor number in CHO-M3 transfectants was determined by radioligand binding using [3H]NMS as described previously (5Wu G. Bogatkevich G.S. Mukhin Y.V. Benovic J.L. Hildebrandt J.D. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9026-9034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Seventy-two hours after siRNA transfection, ∼500,000 cells from one 100-mm plate were plated in a 12-well plate. Parallel immunoblots indicated effective knockdown of SET as described above. Four hours later cells were placed on ice and washed 3 times with 1 ml of ice-cold cell washing solution (137 mm NaCl, 2.6 mm KCl, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm Na2HPO4) and incubated with the muscarinic plasma membrane-impermeable antagonist [3H]NMS (2 nm) in the presence or absence of atropine (10 μm) at 4 °C for 4 h. Cells were then washed 3 times with 1 ml of ice-cold cell washing solution, and 0.5 ml of cell washing solution containing 1% Triton X-100 was added to each well. Cells were scraped and transferred to vials containing 3.5 ml of Ecoscint A (National Diagnostics) for analysis by scintillation spectrometry. Under these experimental conditions, total [3H]NMS binding in intact cells ranged from 20,000 to 30,000 disintegrations/min, and nonspecific [3H]NMS binding was <3% of the total binding.RESULTSIsolation of Proteins Interacting with the i3 Loop of M2-muscarinic Receptor—As part of a broader effort to identify components of a GPCR signaling complex, we focused on the subgroup of GPCRs possessing a larger i3 loop such as found in the muscarinic receptors. We constructed a GST fusion protein containing the i3 loop of the M2-MR (180 amino acids, GST-M2-i3) and used it as an affinity matrix to pull down proteins from rat brain cytosol (Fig. 1A). GST-M2-i3 or GST fusion proteins were expressed in BL21 bacteria and purified by binding to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Fig. 1A). We took advantage of recent technologies that enhance the sensitivity for detecting specific interactions and which involve fluorescent protein labeling and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1B). We labeled proteins bound to the GST control or to the GST-M2-i3 affinity resins with different CyDye fluorochromes. We labeled proteins bound to GST-M2-i3 with Cy5 and proteins bound to the GST control with Cy2 (Fig. 1B). As an additional control, we used Cy3 to label the GST-M2-i3 fusion protein itself without preincubation with brain cytosol. The three sets of labeled proteins were then mixed and separated on a single two-dimensional gel to eliminate intergel variability often encountered by processing individual samples on different gels. This strategy allowed us to clearly identify proteins that interact specifically with the M2-i3 loop with a high degree of sensitivity by virtue of the CyDye fluorescent tags.Fig. 1C presents the results of a representative CyDye labeling experiment with the two-dimensional gel pattern obtained for each set of labeled proteins. Each spot corresponds to a protein separated according to its apparent molecular weight and its isoelectric point (pI). The green and red signals with Mr ∼ 56,000 correspond to the GST-M2-i3 fusion protein (Cy3 and Cy5 pictures). The green spots below the Mr ∼ 56,000 likely correspond to fragments of the Mr ∼ 56,000 species, GST-M2-i3 fusion protein (Cy3 picture). The blue signal with an Mr ∼ 29,000 in the Cy2 picture corresponds to the GST fusion protein. All these three fluorescent pictures derive from the same single two-dimensional gel.On the overlay picture containing the three fluorescent signals (Fig. 2, left panel), the merged colors yellow and purple (i.e. spots a and b) correspond to proteins present not only in the sample labeled with Cy5 but also in the sample labeled with Cy3 or Cy2. This is illustrated on the right panel of Fig. 2 where enlarged areas of the two-dimensional gel containing the Cy5 nonspecific spots a and b are shown in the three channels, Cy5, Cy3, and Cy2. The corresponding quantification of each spot in all three channels is represented by the histograms. Spot a is present in the Cy5 and Cy3 channels and relates to the GST-M2-i3 fusion protein itself, whereas spot b present in the Cy5 and Cy2 channels relates to a brain protein that interacts with the GST fusion protein (control). We identified two red spots, spots c and d, present only in the Cy5 channel (Fig. 2, right panel, Cy5-specific spots). These spots correspond to two proteins that bind specifically the M2-i3 loop. To identify these tw"

ERK2 then acts back on MOS to enhance its expression and amplify the kinase signaling cascade. To date, little is known regarding other factors that regulate this powerful positive feedback kinase cascade. Here we present the scaffold molecule Paxillin as a newly recognized essential regulator of meiosis in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Reduction of Paxillin expression using RNA interference or antisense oligonucleotides completely abrogates steroid-triggered meiotic resumption. Detailed signaling studies reveal that Paxillin is acting early in the kinase cascade, because it is required for accumulation of MOS protein and complete activation of downstream kinase signaling in response to steroids. Surprisingly, full Paxillin activity also requires serine phosphorylation by a kinase downstream of MOS and MEK1, possibly ERK2. Together, these data suggest that Paxillin is an important regulator of the positive feedback effects of MEK/ERK signaling on MOS protein expression. These experiments reveal a novel and critical function for Paxillin in meiosis and support the notion that Paxillin may be a general modulator of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling.

Female fertility relies on precise regulation of oocyte meiosis. Immature oocytes are arrested at prophase I of meiosis until just prior to ovulation, when gonadotropin-induced signals within the ovary trigger them to re-enter the meiotic cycle. Oocytes progress through meiosis until metaphase II, at which point meiotic progression is again arrested, and mature oocytes are competent for ovulation and fertilization (1Albertini D.F. Carabatsos M.J. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 795-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 2Maller J.L. Krebs E.G. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1980; 16: 271-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Xenopus laevis oocytes have long served as a model for studying the molecular signals that regulate meiosis, and many of these pathways now appear to be conserved in mammalian oocyte maturation as well (3Gill A. Jamnongjit M. Hammes S.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 4Jamnongjit M. Gill A. Hammes S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16257-16261Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Although many steroids promote Xenopus oocyte maturation in vitro, androgens likely serve as the physiological trigger in vivo, signaling through classic androgen receptors in a transcription-independent (nongenomic) fashion (5Lutz L.B. Cole L.M. Gupta M.K. Kwist K.W. Auchus R.J. Hammes S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13728-13733Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 6Lutz L.B. Jamnongjit M. Yang W.H. Jahani D.

Thus, Xenopus oocytes not only serve as a superb model for studying the general principles of meiosis, but also as one of the few well accepted, biologically relevant examples of nongenomic steroid-mediated signaling. What transcription-independent signals are modulated by androgens during meiosis? Steroids appear to trigger maturation in a “release of inhibition” fashion whereby oocytes are held in meiotic arrest by constitutive G protein signals that stimulate adenylyl cyclase to elevate intracellular cAMP (7Lutz L.B.

Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). By mechanisms still not understood, cAMP inhibits kinase signaling cascades that are critical for meiotic progression (10Sadler S.E. Maller J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6368-6373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Conti M. Andersen C.B. Richard F. Mehats C. Chun S.Y. Horner K. Jin C. Tsafriri A. Mol. Cell.

Differentiation. 1977; 8: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). During ovulation, gonadotropins stimulate ovarian androgen production in Xenopus, leading to activation of androgen receptors, attenuation of the constitutive G protein signaling (and possibly activation of phosphodiesterases), and a drop in intracellular cAMP. Once cAMP is reduced, the downstream kinases are activated, leading to germinal vesicle breakdown (2Maller J.L. Krebs E.G. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1980; 16: 271-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 13Ferrell Junior, J.E. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Another fascinating feature of this steroid-activated kinase cascade is that it constitutes a powerful, all-or-none positive feedback loop that amplifies small, reversible early signals into large, irreversible late effects (14Ferrell Junior, J.E. Machleder E.M. Science. 1998; 280: 895-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). At the top of the cascade is MOS, an oocyte-specific mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) 4The abbreviations used are: MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; UTR, untranslated region; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase. 4The abbreviations used are: MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; UTR, untranslated region; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase. similar to Raf (Fig. 7). Interestingly, Mos mRNA is present in immature oocytes, but virtually none is translated into stable MOS protein. Steroids trigger increased polyadenylation of Mos mRNA in a process that involves interactions of regulatory proteins EG2 and cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein with the 3′-untranslated region of Mos mRNA (15Gebauer F.

Cell. 2005; 16: 1152-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Increased polyadenylation of Mos mRNA leads to increased MOS protein expression. MOS then activates MEK1 (21Resing K.A.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2610-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), which in turn activates extracellular signaling-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2, or p42), and finally cyclin-dependent kinase 1. Activated ERK2 then further increases MOS protein expression and activity, thus markedly enhancing the signaling cascade (22Howard E.L. Charlesworth A. Welk J. MacNicol A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1990-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 23Nebreda A.R. Gannon J.V. Hunt T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5597-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 24Castro A. Peter M.

Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2203-2211PubMed Google Scholar), little progress has been made in identifying factors that regulate its activity. To address the control of MAPK signaling in oocytes, we focused on the adapter protein, Paxillin. Interestingly, in growth factor-stimulated mammalian somatic cells, Paxillin interacts with and regulates the activity of several components of the MAPK signaling cascade, including Raf, MEK, and ERK (28Ishibe S. Joly D. Zhu X. Cantley L.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1275-1285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 29Liu Z.X. Yu C.F. Nickel C. Thomas S. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10452-10458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Paxillin also modulates many other physiological pathways, including matrix organization, cytoskeletal regulation, and focal adhesion turnover (30Brown M.C. Turner C.E. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 1315-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Notably, Paxillin is an ideal candidate for a regulator of intracellular signaling, because it contains several protein binding domains, including many N-terminal leucine-rich LD motifs and C-terminal double zinc finger LIM domains (31Tumbarello D.A. Brown M.C. Turner C.E. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 32Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J.

Furthermore, multiple phosphorylation sites have been identified, and phosphorylation appears to regulate both localization and function of Paxillin (34Webb D.J. Schroeder M.J. Brame C.J. Whitmore L. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Horwitz A.R. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4925-4929Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 35Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1803-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Because Paxillin has been implicated as a regulator of MAPK signaling, we wished to determine whether it might be mediating the unusual steroid-triggered kinase feedback loop in oocytes. We detected Paxillin expression in Xenopus oocytes, and, through knockdown experiments, showed that Paxillin is required for oocyte maturation. Signaling studies revealed that Paxillin functions downstream of Mos mRNA polyadenylation but upstream of MOS protein expression. However, Paxillin is also phosphorylated downstream of MOS in a MEK-dependent manner, and this phosphorylation is necessary for full Paxillin function. Thus, Paxillin is a critical regulator of meiosis and plays an important role in the positive effects of MEK/ERK signaling on MOS protein expression and activity. Antibodies—Anti-Mos (sc-86) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), anti-HA (PRB-101) from Covance (Princeton, NJ), anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (#9101) and anti-total p44/42 MAPK (#9102) from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). Polyclonal antibodies directed to XePaxillin amino acids 468-484 were generated by Biosynthesis Inc. (Lewisville, TX). Plasmid Construction—cDNAs encoding XePaxillin, XeMOS, and the 3′UTR of Mos mRNA were cloned into pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) for eukaryotic expression and pGEM HE (from L. Jan, University of California, San Francisco, CA) for Xenopus oocyte expression. Primers used to clone XePaxillin and XeMOS included sequence to incorporate an N-terminal HA tag. Serine-mutated versions of Paxillin were cloned using site-directed mutagenesis to convert serine residues to alanine. Oocyte Preparation—Oocytes were harvested from female X. laevis (NASCO) and treated as described (Lutz et al. (7Lutz L.B. Kim B. Jahani D. Hammes S.R. J. Biol.

Briefly, follicular cells were removed by incubation of ovaries in 0.8 mg/ml collagenase A (Roche Applied Science) in modified Barth's solution without Ca2+ for 3-4 h. Oocytes were then washed and incubated overnight at 16 °C in modified Barth's solution containing 1 mg/ml Ficoll, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. Testosterone-induced maturation assays were performed on stage V/VI oocytes from each preparation to determine sensitivity to steroid. Maturation was scored as germinal vesicle breakdown, which was visualized as a white spot on the animal pole of the oocyte. Twenty oocytes were used for each data point in all experiments. RNA Synthesis and Injections—The pGEM HE constructs were linearized with NheI, except for the Mos 3′UTR reporter, which was linearized with XbaI. Capped cRNA was transcribed in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). RNA was suspended in injection buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), and Stage V/VI oocytes were injected with 20 ng of cRNA using a Drummond automatic injector. For double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) injections, equal concentrations of forward and reverse XePaxillin cRNA were mixed, heated to 90 °C, and allowed to slowly cool to 30 °C. Oocytes were then injected with 40 ng of dsRNA. The sequences of the sense and antisense Paxillin oligonucleotides were C*T*A*GAGGCGACATGGATGATCT*G*G*A and T*C*C*AGATCATCCATGTCGCCTC*T*A*G, respectively, with phosphorothioated bonds indicated by asterisks. Oocytes were injected with 25 ng of oligonucleotides in each experiment. For the rescue studies, XePaxillin was recloned so that nucleotides at wobble positions in the first six codons were changed, preserving the amino acid sequence but preventing antisense oligonucleotides from binding. In each rescue experiment, oocytes were co-injected with 25 ng of oligonucleotide and 20 ng of rescue cRNA. After all injections, oocytes were incubated at least 36-48 h before beginning any assay. Steroid Maturation Assays—Maturation assays were conducted by incubating 20 oocytes per condition with the indicated concentration of testosterone (Steraloids) or ethanol in modified Barth's solution for 12-16 h, at which time oocytes were scored for germinal vesicle breakdown (visualization of a white spot on the animal pole). Dilutions were performed such that ethanol concentration was held at 0.1%. In experiments with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (Calbiochem), oocytes were pretreated with 50 μm PD98059 or 0.1% Me2SO for 1 h. Oocytes were then incubated with the indicated concentration of testosterone and either PD98059 or Me2SO. Western Blots—Oocytes were incubated with steroid or vehicle, permeabilized in 20 μl/oocyte lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm NaF, 0.5 mm sodium vanadate, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and microcentrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min to remove yolk and other debris. The cleared supernatants were then mixed 1:1 with 2× SDS buffer. The equivalent of 0.5 oocyte was loaded in each lane for SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore), blocked in 5% TBST-milk for 1 h, then incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C (1:5000 for anti-HA, 1:5000 for pre-immune and immune sera, 1:1000 for α-MOS, 1:2000 for α-phospho-p42 ERK2). Membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h, and signal detected by ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences). Total ERK blots were generated by stripping phospho-ERK blots, then incubating with 1:1000 α-total p42 ERK2 antibody. For phosphatase assays, oocytes were permeabilized in oocyte lysis buffer without sodium vanadate, then 30 μl was treated with 10 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs) for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were then mixed with an equal volume of 2× SDS buffer and immunoblotted. Mos Polyadenylation Assays and Northern Blots—Polyadenylation of Mos RNA was determined as described (22Howard E.L. Charlesworth A. Welk J. MacNicol A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1990-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Briefly, 36 h after dsPax or AS injections, each oocyte was injected with 10 ng of cRNA encoding the terminal 280 nucleotides of the 3′UTR of Mos mRNA, and oocytes were allowed to recover for 2 h. Oocytes were then stimulated with testosterone and permeabilized every 4 h. RNA was extracted using 1 ml of TRIzol (Invitrogen), and 20 μg of total RNA was run on a 2.2% agarose formaldehyde gel in 1× MOPS buffer for ∼10 h at 60 V. RNA was transferred to a Nytran SuPerCharge nylon membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) by downward transfer in 20× SSC (Schleicher & Schuell) and UV cross-linked. Membranes were pre-hybridized in ExpressHyb (Clontech) at 68 °C for 30 min, then probed with [32P]dCTP-labeled Mos 3′UTR DNA (Rediprime II, Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h, washed 2× in 2× SSC, 0.05% SDS, 2× in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS, then subjected to autoradiography. To confirm knockdown of Paxillin mRNA by Northern analysis, 20 μg of total RNA from sense and antisense injected oocytes were treated as in the polyadenylation assay with the following changes. Samples were run on a 1% agarose formaldehyde gel for 3 h at 90 V. The membrane was probed with [32P]dCTP-labeled Paxillin DNA encoding nucleotides 585-858. The membrane was stripped by adding to boiling 0.1% SDS, allowed to cool for 15 min, and then repeated. The membrane was pre-hybridized again, then probed with a [32P]dCTP-labeled Xenopus glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase DNA probe encoding nucleotides 171-471. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 cells (ATCC) were maintained at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Fisher Scientific) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Transfections were performed in 6-well plates using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). Each well was transfected with 1 μg of total DNA as indicated. After overnight incubation in 10% serum, cells were serum-starved for 24 h. Cells were then treated with either 50 μm PD98059 or 0.1% Me2SO in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 2 h. Cells were washed 2× with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), and permeabilized in 300 μl of oocyte lysis buffer. Wells were scraped, cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the cleared lysates were mixed 1:1 with 2× SDS buffer and immunoblotted as described. GST Proteins and in Vitro Kinase Assays—XePaxillin was cloned into pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) and transformed into BL21. Transformed bacteria were then induced with 100 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h and permeabilized in phosphate-buffered saline including 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride using an Emmulsiflex C5. The cleared lysate was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads and protein eluted with 10 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA. One microgram of GST protein was incubated in MAPK buffer with either 100 ng of inactive ERK (Cell Signaling Technologies) or active ERK (New England Biolabs) per the manufacturer's protocol. 10 μCi of γ-ATP was added to each reaction, and the kinase reaction incubated at 30 °C for 1 h followed by mixing with an equal volume of 2× SDS buffer. Samples were run on 10% gels by SDS-PAGE, dried, then analyzed by autoradiography. To confirm equal loading, reactions were run in duplicate without radioactive ATP, and samples were analyzed by Western blot using 1:1000 anti-Paxillin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies). Immunohistochemistry—Oocytes were injected with either vehicle, 40 ng of dsXePax RNA, or 25 ng of the indicated oligonucleotides. After 48 h, the oocytes were fixed in paraffin, sectioned, and mounted on slides (Molecular Pathology Core Facility, University of Texas Southwestern). After blocking with horse serum, slides were incubated overnight with a 1:500 dilution of rabbit serum containing an anti-XePaxillin antibody directed against residues 468-484 or its corresponding preimmune serum from the same rabbit. XePaxillin was then detected using the Vectastain ABC kit per the manufacturer's protocol and viewed and photographed using a Nikon microscope and digital camera. Paxillin Is Expressed in X. laevis Oocytes and Is Required For Steroid-triggered Maturation—A cDNA encoding a 539-amino acid isoform of X. laevis Paxillin (XePaxillin) protein (BAA96456) was cloned from oocyte mRNA using reverse-transcription-PCR (36Ogawa M. Hiraoka Y. Taniguchi K. Sakai Y. Aiso S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1519: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). XePaxillin shares ∼80% overall identity with human Paxillin, with 100% identity in two SH2 binding sites, five LD motifs, and four LIM domains (Fig. 1). Northern blot analysis confirmed the presence of Paxillin mRNA, with two isoforms detected (Fig. 2E), and Paxillin mRNA expression was unaffected by steroid treatment (data not shown). Immunohistochemistry using antibodies against XePaxillin revealed specific staining throughout the oocyte, including both nuclear and cytoplasmic regions (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, the nuclear staining of XePaxillin was the strongest, consistent with some subcellular localization studies in mammalian somatic cells. Notably, the signal using the anti-XePaxillin serum was considerably stronger than that seen using the corresponding preimmune serum (Fig. 2C), illustrating the specificity of the immunohistochemistry. Finally, the anti-Paxillin serum (but not the corresponding pre-immune serum) recognized the overexpressed C-terminal half of XePaxillin, by Western blot (Fig. 2D), further confirming the specificity of the antibody. Unfortunately, although it specifically detected endogenous Paxillin by immunohistochemistry, our antibody was not sensitive enough to detect endogenous Paxillin protein by Western blot.FIGURE 2Paxillin is required for steroid-induced oocyte maturation. A, oocytes were injected with HA-tagged XePaxillin cRNA (XePax) to increase XePaxillin expression, double-stranded XePaxillin cRNA (ds XePax) to decrease XePaxillin expression, or 10 mm Hepes (Mock). After 48 h, oocytes were incubated with the indicated concentrations of testosterone and maturation (germinal vesicle breakdown) was scored after 16 h. B, oocytes were injected with either sense or antisense oligonucleotides without and with HA-XePaxillin cRNA and then treated as in A. Rescued oocytes contained HA-XePaxillin as measured by Western blot using an anti-HA antibody (inset). Results of dsRNA and antisense knockdown studies are representative of at least five experiments each. C, immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin-embedded sections of mock, XePaxillin dsRNA, XePaxillin sense oligonucleotide, or XePaxillin antisense oligonucleotide injected oocytes. Sections were incubated with equal concentrations of rabbit anti-Paxillin antisera or the corresponding preimmune serum. These are representative photos of multiple slides. D, the anti-Paxillin, but not the corresponding pre-immune, serum recognizes the C-terminal half of XePaxillin when overexpressed in oocytes. Oocytes were injected with cRNAs encoding the indicated proteins and Western blots performed after 48 h. E, XePaxillin mRNA is present in sense-injected oocytes but disappears in oocytes injected with XePaxillin antisense oligonucleotides, as detected by Northern blot (upper panel). Northern blots correspond to the mRNA prepared for Fig. 2D. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA levels were unchanged (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether Paxillin was required for steroid-induced oocyte maturation, overexpression and depletion studies were performed. Overexpression of Paxillin by cRNA injection had no effect on testosterone-induced maturation as compared with mock injected control oocytes. In contrast, knock-down of endogenous Paxillin expression by injection of full-length double-stranded XePaxillin RNA (dsRNA) dramatically inhibited oocyte maturation in response to testosterone (Fig. 2A). Significant reduction in Paxillin expression was confirmed by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2C, left). Injection of nonspecific dsRNAs did not affect maturation (data not shown), confirming the specificity of the XePaxillin dsRNA injections. Of note, RNA interference in Xenopus and mouse oocytes has been used by us and others with excellent success, and with an absence of nonspecific effects (6Lutz L.B. Jamnongjit M. Yang W.H. Jahani D.

The inhibitory effect of reducing Paxillin expression by dsRNA injection was confirmed by knocking down Paxillin expression using antisense phosphorothioated oligonucleotides directed against the start codon of the XePaxillin mRNA. This technique has been used extensively to reduce mRNA and protein expression in X. laevis oocytes (42Torpey N. Wylie C.C. Heasman J.

Injection of the XePaxillin antisense, but not sense, oligonucleotides markedly reduced XePaxillin mRNA expression by Northern blot but did not affect mRNA expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA (Fig. 2E). As with the dsRNA injections, injection of the XePaxillin antisense oligonucleotides reduced endogenous Paxillin expression by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2C, right) and inhibited steroid-induced oocyte maturation when compared with oocytes injected with the respective sense oligonucleotides (Fig. 2B). Importantly, the inhibitory effect of the antisense oligonucleotide injections on maturation were rescued by overexpression of XePaxillin from injected cRNA that contained alternative DNA sequences at the region recognized by the antisense oligonucleotides (Fig. 2B). XePaxillin expression was confirmed by Western blot (inset to Fig. 2B). The ability of overexpressed XePaxillin to rescue maturation in antisense-injected oocytes confirmed that inhibition of maturation was a specific effect due to reduced expression of Paxillin protein in oocytes. Paxillin Functions Late in the Maturation Signaling Pathway—As mentioned, androgen-induced maturation occurs through a nongenomic androgen receptor-mediated mechanism that leads to increased Mos mRNA polyadenylation and subsequent MOS protein expression. MOS then activates MEK1, which activates ERK2. ERK2 then further stimulates MOS protein expression and activity, resulting in a potent positive feedback loop that ultimately activates maturation promoting factor, a complex of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 and cyclin B, to trigger oocyte maturation (13Ferrell Junior,"

Ribosomes are RNA-protein complexes that perform protein synthesis in all living organisms. In eubacteria, the ribosome consists of three RNA chains and of more than 50 different proteins. Although the major steps of protein synthesis have been known for a long time, the detailed picture of how the ribosome structure forms and how it functions is still to be drawn.

Now, structure-function relationships can be analyzed for any region of the ribosome taken within its natural context. Of a special interest are those elements of the ribosome structure that have very similar, almost identical conformations and thus constitute recurrent motifs. Due to the similarity, recurrent motifs could play similar roles in the formation of the ribosome structure and, potentially, in the ribosome function. Recently, we described a new, so-called along-groove packing motif (AGPM) 4The abbreviations used are: AGPM, along-groove packing motif; WC, Watson-Crick; wt, wild-type; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein. found in a dozen places in the RNA of both ribosomal subunits (7Gagnon M.G. Steinberg S.V. RNA (N. Y.). 2002; 8: 873-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). AGPM consists of two double helices closely packed via their minor grooves in the way that the sugarphosphate backbone of one chain of each helix goes along the minor groove of the other helix (see Fig. 1). In each helix, the chain that is packed in the minor groove of the opposite helix is positioned closer to the center of the arrangement and is thus called internal, contrary to the other chain that is called external. The interaction between the two base pairs at the center of the inter-helix contact zone is responsible for about one-half of the inter-helix atom-atom contacts, including a framework of five H-bonds (see Fig. 2, A and B). Henceforth, we call these base pairs central. The whole arrangement is characterized by a quasi-reciprocity, which is limited by the fact that the close packing of the two helices requires that one of the central base pairs be GU, while the other one must be Watson-Crick (WC). The GU base pair should be oriented in the way that G and U belong to the external and internal strand, respectively (henceforth, the first nucleotide in each base pair corresponds to the external position). A violation of this requirement would result in a loss of the close packing of the helices and may ruin the whole arrangement (see Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2Juxtaposition of different central base pairs within AGPM. Dashed lines stand for inter-nucleotide H-bonds. The co-existence of GU and a WC base pair in motifs SU296 (A) and LU554 (B) introduces an asymmetry between the helices that allows their close packing. The deviation from the GU-WC pattern in motif LC2291 results in a crack between the two helices marked by the arrow (C). The crack will remain if a central GC base pair is replaced by CG (D), which happens in clone A12. Motif SU296 was extracted from 16 S rRNA (PDB code 2AVY) (6Schuwirth B.S. Borovinskaya M.A. Hau C.W. Zhang W. Vila-Sanjurjo A. Holton J.M. Cate J.H. Science. 2005; 310: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar), whereas motifs LU554 and LC2291 were extracted from 23 S rRNA (PDB code 1JJ2) (1Ban N. Nissen P. Hansen J. Moore P.B.

For all juxtapositions, the E. coli nucleotide numbering is used.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) An essential feature of AGPM is that it is able to bring together elements distant from each other in the secondary structure. This ability and the fact that AGPM has been found in many parts of the ribosome structure make this motif an essential element of the ribosome architecture. Therefore, the elucidation of the general requirements for the formation of AGPM is important for understanding how the whole ribosome structure forms and how it functions. In this report, we explored a possibility of alternative nucleotide arrangements in AGPM SU296 (see Fig. 3), which is formed between helices 3 and 12 of 16 S rRNA. Within this motif, the central base pairs occupy positions G301-U296 and G27-C556. SU296 is positioned close to the root of the central pseudoknot at the region where three domains of the 30 S subunit the shoulder, the platform, and the neck come together. Each of two fragments 28-295 and 302-555 of 16 S rRNA starts at SU296 and, after making a large loop, comes back to SU296 as a part of the other helix. Therefore, the formation of SU296 would strongly affect the set of possible conformations for each of the two fragments. Given that regions 28-295 and 302-555 form together the body and the shoulder of 30 S, SU296 is expected to play a major role in the formation of the tertiary structure of these two domains of the small ribosomal subunit. Thus, the closeness to several major domains and a probable involvement in the formation of their structures would make SU296 crucial for the integrity of the whole 30 S subunit. Unlike most AGPMs, SU296 is not immediately involved in any interaction either with another part of rRNA or with a ribosomal protein (3Wimberly B.T. Brodersen D.E. Clemons Jr., W.M.

Vila-Sanjurjo A. Holton J.M. Cate J.H. Science. 2005; 310: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar), which makes it a perfect candidate for studying the properties of AGPM within its natural structural context without a necessity of taking into consideration a potential role of neighboring regions. Using in vivo instant evolution approach applied to a combinatorial gene library of 16 S rRNA, we selected fourteen functional variants in which the identities of the nucleotides composing the two central base pairs of motif SU296 were different from those found in the wild-type (wt) Escherichia coli 16 S rRNA. Only in a few variants the efficiency was close to wt. Analysis of the nucleotide sequences of these variants helped us to identify the limits within which the wt sequence can be modified to preserve the ribosome function. In two variants, the GU and WC base pairs stayed as in wt, which made the close helix packing undisturbed. In two more variants, GU was replaced by WC, while WC was replaced by GU. Individually, each of two replacements GU → WC and WC → GU would result in a loss of the close packing between the helices. However, when both replacements occur simultaneously, the quality of the helix packing is not affected. In other clones, the nucleotide sequences do not allow the close packing of the two helices; correspondingly, the efficiency of such ribosomes is severely damaged. Based on these results, we can conclude that the close packing of the helices within SU296 is a major aspect of the ribosome functionality. Bacterial Strains and Media—For cloning and selection, we used the E. coli strain DH5α. Cultures were grown in the LB medium (8Luria S.E. Burrous J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1957; 74: 461-476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or in the LB medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin (LB-Amp-100) and with 50 μg/ml kanamycin, when appropriate (Sigma-Aldrich). Plasmids—For cloning of combinatorial 16 S rRNA gene libraries and for selection of functional clones, plasmid pAMMG carrying the specialized ribosome system was constructed. This plasmid is analogous to the ones described elsewhere (9Lee K. Varma S. SantaLucia Jr., J. Cunningham P.R. J. Mol.

It also contains two genes with modified Shine-Dalgarno sequences, of a chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase (CAT) and of a green fluorescent protein (GFP), which were used, respectively, for selection and for quantifying the efficiency of the selected clones (supplemental “Methods”). To measure the level of miscoding of the selected clones, seven variants of plasmid pLuc were constructed (supplemental “Methods”). Construction of the Combinatorial Gene Library and Selection of Functional Clones—To randomize the four nucleotides comprising the two central base pairs of the SU296 motif (Fig. 3C), we used an overlapping extension PCR procedure (19Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar). In this way, the entire region comprising the SU296 motif (902 bp) was amplified by consecutive multistep PCR. The sequences of the primers used for different steps of PCR are given in supplemental “Methods.” Prior to selection, the transformants were grown for 1 h in the LB medium. The synthesis of the plasmid-encoded ribosomes was induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Bioshop Canada Inc.) to a final concentration of 1 mm. After incubation for 3.5 h, the library was plated on the selection plates containing 200 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The minimal inhibitory concentration of chloramphenicol for the cells expressing pAMMG-encoded rRNA was ∼500 μg/ml. Out of a pool of 1.4 × 105 transformants, 50 survivors were obtained as chloramphenicol-resistant and taken for further analysis. GFPuv3 Assay—For quantifying the efficiency of the selected clones, the GFPuv3 variant (20Ito Y. Suzuki M. Husimi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 556-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) of the GFPuv gene (BD Biosciences) was incorporated into pAMMG under the control of a synthetic lactococcal strong constitutive CP25 promoter (21Jensen P.R. Hammer K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 82-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Compared with GFPuv, the GFPuv3 variant provided for a higher sensitivity of measuring the fluorescence. Freshly transformed colonies of the selected clones were inoculated into 1 ml of the LB-Amp-100 medium containing 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and incubated at 37 °C with shaking for 16 h. After the incubation, the cells were harvested, washed twice in 1 ml of the HN buffer (20 mm Hepes, 0.85% NaCl, pH 7.4), and re-suspended in 1 ml of the HN buffer. The cell density (A600) and the fluorescence (excitation = 497 nm, emission = 511 nm) of each clone was determined using a Packard Fusion α-FP plate reader. For each clone, the fluorescence was divided by A600 and presented as a percentage of wt. Firefly Luciferase Assay—Each of the seven miscoding variants of plasmid pLuc (supplemental Tables S3 and S4) was cotransformed together with pAMMG-wt or with a mutant derivative of it into DH5α cells and plated on the LB agar containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml kanamycin. To induce the specialized ribosome system, we proceeded as described above. To measure the level of miscoding, the luciferase assay was performed as described in the supplemental “Methods.” Subunit Association Assay—Cells containing pAMMG or a mutant derivative of it were induced and grown in 500 ml of the LB-Amp-100 media. The ribosomal particles were isolated from the cellular lysates prepared by freezing and thawing method (22Ron E.Z. Kohler R.E. Davis B.D. Science. 1966; 153: 1119-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The lysates were applied onto a 15-40% (w/v) linear sucrose gradient in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NH4Cl, and 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol, followed by centrifugation at 20,000 rpm for 20 h in a Beckman rotor SW28 at 4 °C. Fractions containing the 30 S subunits and the 70 S ribosomes were collected using an ISCO gradient fractionator. RNA was extracted from the appropriate fractions with phenol. The proportion of the plasmid-encoded and host-encoded 16 S rRNA was determined by the primer extension method (12Belanger F. Gagnon M.G. Steinberg S.V. Cunningham P.R. Brakier-Gingras L. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 23Sigmund C.D. Ettayebi M. Borden A. Morgan E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 673-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) (supplemental “Methods”). Sequencing—Sequencing of the selected clones was performed on the LI-COR DNA sequencing system (Département de Biochimie, Université de Montréal) using primer 5′-AATTTATCAGACAATCTGTGTGGGCACTCG-3′ for reading positions 27, 296, and 301 and primer 5′-GTAGGTGGGGTAACGGCTCACCTAGGCGAC-3′ for reading position 556. These primers were labeled at the 5′-end with IRDye-800 (LI-COR Biosciences). Computer Modeling—The models were based on the crystal structure of the E. coli 30 S subunit (6Schuwirth B.S. Borovinskaya M.A. Hau C.W. Zhang W. Vila-Sanjurjo A. Holton J.M. Cate J.H. Science. 2005; 310: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar) (PDB code 2AVY). Fragments 26-30 and 553-558 of helix 3 and 293-304 of helix 12 were taken from the x-ray structure and were used as a starting conformation into which the nucleotide replacements corresponding to a particular selected clone were introduced. Modeling was done interactively, using the InsightII/Discover package (version 2000, Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA). Each model was submitted to a restrained energy minimization using the AMBER force field (amber.ch.ic.ac.uk/amber). During the minimization, bp 30-553 and 26-558 of helix 3, bp 293-304 of helix 12, as well as nucleotides 298 and 299 of the tetraloop capping helix 12 were immobilized. Visualization was done on a Silicon Graphics Fuel computer. Experimental System and Library Design—To study structure-function characteristics of SU296 within the 30 S subunit, we used the instant evolution approach that consisted in selection of functionally active ribosomes from a combinatorial library in which several nucleotides of 16 S rRNA were randomized. The selection was done in vivo with use of a specialized ribosome system pAMMG analogous to the ones previously described (9Lee K. Varma S. SantaLucia Jr., J. Cunningham P.R. J. Mol.

The system contained genes of rRNA and of two reporter proteins, the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) and the green fluorescent protein (GFPuv3) (20Ito Y. Suzuki M. Husimi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 556-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The rRNA gene was needed for incorporation and expression of the designed combinatorial library, while CAT and GFPuv3 were used, respectively, for selection of active clones in the presence of chloramphenicol and for measurement of the ribosome activity. In the 16 S rRNA gene, the anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequence was modified as suggested (14Rackham O. Chin J.W. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 24Lee K. Holland-Staley C.A. Cunningham P.R. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 1270-1285PubMed Google Scholar), and the corresponding modification of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence was introduced into the genes of both reporter proteins. In the cell, this system co-exists without interference with the normal cellular protein-synthesis machinery (14Rackham O. Chin J.W. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In the combinatorial library, all four positions composing the two central base pairs (Figs. 1 and 2A) were fully randomized (Fig. 3), which provided for 256 possible variants. Cloning and Selection of Functional Clones—After cloning the library, a pool of ∼1.4 × 105 transformants was obtained. A random sequencing of 12 transformants showed that all four positions of the central base pairs in the SU296 motif were reasonably randomized, except that there was some bias toward cytosines and against adenines, accounting for 38 and 7% of the identities of randomized nucleotides, respectively (data not shown). Out of 50 clones that were selected as survivors in the presence of 200 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 25 had the wt sequence, most probably, due to an incomplete digestion of plasmid pAMMG during the cloning of the library. The other 25 clones contained 14 unique sequences (Table 1), which demonstrated a mild level of redundancy. In no case did mutations touch non-randomized nucleotides.TABLE 1Nucleotide sequences and characteristics of the selected clonesCloneNaN is the number of times each clone has been isolatedRandomized positionsGFPuv3bThe ribosome activity was calculated as the mean ± S.D. of five to eight independent experimentsPlasmid-encoded 16 S rRNAcThe proportion of the plasmid-encoded 16 S rRNA in the 30 S and 70 S fractions was calculated as the mean ± S.D. of experiments performed with three independent RNA preparations.

The selected clones were further characterized as to their capacity for the normal protein synthesis. First, for each clone, we determined the proportion of the plasmid-encoded 16 S rRNA in the population of 30 S subunits (column 30 S). This proportion mostly depends on the relation between the rates of formation and degradation of the specialized 30 S subunit and indirectly characterizes the stability of its structure. Second, we determined the proportion of the specialized ribosomes within the total 70 S ribosome population (column 70 S). This proportion depends on several factors, including some not related to the mutated ribosomes, like the availability of mRNAs carrying the specialized Shine-Dalgarno sequence. However, if the general conditions are maintained and if the number in column 30 S is comparable to that of wt, a low number in column 70 S will suggest a damaged initiation of translation. Next, for each clone, the accuracy control was performed. Using previously reported techniques (12Belanger F. Gagnon M.G. Steinberg S.V. Cunningham P.R. Brakier-Gingras L. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 25Dyer B.W. Ferrer F.A. Klinedinst D.K. Rodriguez R. Anal.

Photobiol. 2002; 76: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we measured the efficiency of seven different miscoding events, of the opal, ochre, and amber stop codon read-through, of the -1 and +1 frameshift, as well as of two types of amino acid misincorporation. Each time, the particular miscoding event was required for the expression of the reporting protein firefly luciferase from the specially constructed derivative of its gene, and the activity of this protein was taken as a measure of the efficiency of the miscoding. For each clone, the average and the highest levels of the seven measured miscoding events are given in Table 1 (three last columns). The complete set of data on translational fidelity of the mutated ribosomes is presented in the supplemental Table S1. Potentially Negative Role of Uridine 1192—When this work was in progress, Rodriguez-Correa and Dahlberg (27Rodriguez-Correa D. Dahlberg A.E. RNA (N. Y.). 2004; 10: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) demonstrated that mutation C1192U, which is also present in the 16 S rRNA encoded in pAMMG, can show synthetic lethality with some other mutations in 16 S rRNA. To test a potentially damaging role of U1192 in the selected clones, we created six additional mutants through introduction of the reverse mutation U1192C into six clones with varying activities. The activities of all new mutants are presented in the supplemental Table S5. They were within the same ranges of activities as of their U1192-containing analogs, being, on average, 7% higher. These results demonstrate that the observed phenotypes are essentially independent of the C1192U mutation. These results also show that mutation C1192U provides a mild negative effect on the ribosome function, which is independent of the packing between helices 3 and 12. Analysis of the Selected Clones—Although the activity of all selected clones was sufficient for survival in the presence of chloramphenicol, the efficiency of the protein synthesis varied substantially among the clones. Based on the characteristics studied, we divided all clones in three groups seen in Table 1. Group I consists of clone A1 with the wt sequence and of three more clones whose functional characteristics are comparable to those of wt. Group II consists of only one clone, A2, which in all aspects is as good as the Group I clones, except for a slightly elevated miscoding level. All other clones form Group III; in each clone of this group, some functional aspects are essentially damaged compared with those in Group I and II clones. Analysis of the selected clones demonstrates that the ribosome efficiency strongly depends on the identity of the central base pairs of SU296. Thus, we have noticed that in all Group I and Group II clones"
