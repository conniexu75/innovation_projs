https://openalex.org/W116814209,"In the absence of hormone, the avian progesterone receptor exists in a large multiprotein complex that is inactive but able to bind and respond to progestins. This inactive complex can be reconstituted in vitro by incubation of receptor monomer in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of ATP and magnesium. This results in receptor binding to the two heat shock proteins, hsp90 and hsp70, the FK506 binding-proteins, FKBP54 and FKBP52, the cyclosporin A-binding protein, cyclophilin-40, and the recently characterized protein p23. Immune isolation of p23 from rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the absence of receptor reveals an ATP-dependent complex containing the major proteins associated with steroid receptors. Depletion of p23 from lysate prevents the assembly of progesterone receptor complexes, and the addition of purified p23 restores this activity, indicating that the p23 protein complex is an essential precursor to the formation of progesterone receptor complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1507115449,"A novel hepatoma-derived growth factor was purified from the conditioned medium of human hepatoma-derived cell line, HuH-7, by the assay of [3H]thymidine incorporation into Swiss 3T3 cells. Molecular cloning of a complementary DNA from the cDNA library of HuH-7 cells was done on the basis of the N-terminal amino acid sequence. This protein was acid- and heat-labile heparin-binding protein and inactivated by reducing condition. The cDNA is 2.4 kilobase pairs long, and the deduced amino acid sequence from cDNA contained 240 amino acids without a signal peptide-like N-terminal hydrophobic sequence. Heparin column-eluted fraction of the conditioned medium of Cos-7 cells transfected by the cDNA stimulated the DNA synthesis. Northern blot analysis revealed its ubiquitous expression in several tumor-derived cell lines, as well as in normal tissues. The primary sequence shares homology with the high mobility group (HMG)-1 protein (23.4% amino acid identity and 35.6% similarity). However, its hydrophobic profile was distinct from that of HMG-1 except for the C-terminal acidic region, and it contained no apparent HMG box motif. Immunofluorescence study showed that it is localized in the cytoplasma of hepatoma cells. These findings suggest that this factor is a novel heparin-binding protein, with mitogenic activity for fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1579598940,"Endothelial-monocyte activating polypeptide II (EMAP II) was initially identified in the supernatant of murine methylcholanthrene A-induced fibrosarcomas (Meth A) by its capacity to activate host effector cells (Kao, J., Ryan, J., Brett, J., Chen, J., Shen, H., Fan, Y-G., Godman, G., Familletti, P., Wang, F., Pan, Y-C., Stern, D., and Clauss, M. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 20239-20247). Based on the NH2-terminal protein sequence, a full-length cDNA has been cloned which indicates that the precursor of EMAP II is a unique, leaderless, single polypeptide chain with predicted molecular mass approximately 34 kDa and that the mature form released by Meth A cells corresponds to approximately 20 kDa. Purified recombinant mature EMAP II (EMAP II, approximately 20 kDa form) activated endothelial cells with resulting elevation of cytosolic free calcium concentration, release of von Willebrand factor, induction of tissue factor, and expression of the adhesion molecules E-selectin and P-selectin. Neutrophils exposed to EMAP II demonstrated elevated cytosolic free calcium concentration, peroxidase generation, and chemotaxis. EMAP II also activated mononuclear phagocytes elevating cytosolic free calcium concentration, inducing tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) and tissue factor, and stimulating chemotaxis. Systemic infusion of EMAP II into C3H/HeJ or Balb/c mice was associated with systemic toxicity, pulmonary congestion, and the appearance of TNF, interleukin-1 and -6 in the plasma. A single intra-tumor injection of EMAP II into Meth A sarcomas induced acute thrombohemorrhage and partial tumor regression. Local injection of EMAP II into a tumor resistant to the effects of TNF, murine mammary carcinoma, rendered it sensitive to subsequently administered TNF, which resulted in acute thrombohemorrhage and partial regression. These data suggest that recombinant EMAP II, a tumor-derived cytokine, has properties of a proinflammatory mediator with the capacity to prime the tumor vasculature for a locally destructive process."
https://openalex.org/W1569658633,"DNA copies of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) genome integrate nonrandomly into the chromosomal DNA of the host cell. In this report, we investigate the molecular basis of this selectivity using the virus-encoded HIV integrase to direct integration of a synthetic HIV long terminal repeat substrate into either DNA molecules of known structure or previously defined nucleosomal complexes. We find that the structure of the target greatly influences the site of integration, and, moreover, DNA curvature, flexibility, and rigidity in solution all influence the frequency of integration. Importantly, for DNA with all of these properties, the distortion of the double helix directed by association with the histone proteins promotes the integration reaction and alters the distribution of sites that are selected for integration. We suggest that both intrinsic DNA structure and the folding of DNA into chromosomal structures will exert a major influence on target site selection for integration of the viral genome."
https://openalex.org/W1497947681,"Chemical oxidants can induce the covalent binding of low molecular weight thiols to reactive sulfhydryls on proteins (S-thiolation). We found that stimulation of the respiratory burst of human blood monocytes resulted in S-thiolation of several proteins, most prominently one of 38 kDa. This purified protein was identified as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) by enzyme activity, immunoblotting, and amino acid analysis. After stimulation of the respiratory burst, S-thiolation of GAPDH gradually increased, and cytosol GAPDH activity decreased; so that at 60 min, GAPDH activity was reduced by approximately 40%. Activity was restored by the addition of the sulfhydryl-reducing agent dithioerythritol. H2O2 appeared to be particularly important in mediating S-thiolation during the respiratory burst. Exposure of monocytes to H2O2 induced concentration-dependent S-thiolation of GAPDH and a concomitant decrease in enzyme activity. The addition of respiratory burst stimuli to lymphocytes, which lack a full respiratory burst, had no effect on GAPDH S-thiolation or activity; but H2O2 induced S-thiolation of lymphocyte GAPDH and inhibition of enzyme activity. Stimulation of monocytes from three patients with chronic granulomatous disease resulted in no respiratory burst, S-thiolation of GAPDH, or inactivation of GAPDH activity. The thiols covalently bound to purified S-thiolated GAPDH were removed by dithioerythritol and were identified as glutathione and cysteine; glutathione was predominant. These results indicate that during the respiratory burst in monocytes, low molecular weight thiols can bind to specific cytosolic proteins, including GAPDH. It is possible that S-thiolation of cytosolic proteins serves to modulate cellular metabolic events during phagocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1580193095,"In higher eukaryotic cells, the Hsp90 chaperone protein is found in complexes with other proteins, in addition to the substrate protein. These other proteins include Hsp70, p60, and several peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (immunophilins). We utilized affinity chromatography to investigate whether Hsp82, the Hsp90 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is found in similar complexes in that organism. Six histidine residues were fused to the N terminus of Hsp82 to yield a fusion protein (Hsp82FP) with affinity for a nickel-ion matrix. Hsp82FP was shown to have wild-type function. In addition, when mammalian substrates of Hsp90 (glucocorticoid receptor and p60v-src) were expressed in yeast cells, these proteins bound to the affinity matrix only when isolated from cells containing Hsp82FP. Yeast homologs of Hsp70 (in particular, members of the Ssa subfamily), p60 (Sti1), and a 45-kDa immunophilin homolog were also isolated in this manner, by virtue of their specific, stable association with Hsp82. Thus, Hsp90 functions as part of a highly conserved macromolecular complex in eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W1593863412,"Crystallographic and spectroscopic studies on galactose oxidase have shown that the active site involves a free radical on tyrosine 272, one of the ligands coordinated to the Cu2+ cofactor. A novel thioether bond between tyrosine 272 and cysteine 228, and a stacking tryptophan 290, over this bond, are features of the crystal structure. The present study describes the development of a high level heterologous expression system for galactose oxidase and the construction of mutational variants at these key active site residues. The expressed wild-type enzyme and mutational variants (W290H and C228G) have been characterized by x-ray crystallography, visible spectroscopy, and catalytic activity measurements. A further variant protein, Y272F, could not be purified. The data establish that the thioether bond and stacking tryptophan are essential for activity and further support a role for tryptophan 290 as a component of the free radical site."
https://openalex.org/W1479700122,"The low M(r) phosphotyrosine protein phosphatase (PTPase) and Yersinia enterocolitica PTPase are inactivated by nitric oxide-generating compounds. Inorganic phosphate, a competitive inhibitor, protects the enzymes from inactivation, suggesting that the action of NO is directed to the active sites. Low M(r) PTPase from bovine liver lost two out of eight thiol groups present in the molecule during the inactivation with sodium nitroprusside and with other NO-producing compounds. The mass spectrometric analyses of tryptic fragments of the enzyme, performed after chemical modification of the NO-unreacted thiol groups, demonstrated that NO caused the oxidation of Cys-12 and Cys-17 to form an S-S bond. A similar reaction was described previously for the reaction of NO with N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor. The NO-inactivated low M(r) PTPase was reactivated by treating the inactive enzyme with thiol-containing reagents. Since all members of the PTPase family have the same reaction mechanism and possess a conserved active site motif that contains an essential cysteine residue, the findings on low M(r) and Yersinia PTPases are potentially interesting for all PTPases, an enzyme class that is involved in a number of important biological processes."
https://openalex.org/W1489079707,"A 268-base pair 5' distal fragment, SX2, which mediates basal level and inducer-dependent activation of the mouse heme oxygenase-1 gene, contains two activator protein-1 (AP-1) binding sites (Alam, J., and Zhining, D. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 21894-21900). Mutation of both AP-1 binding elements diminishes (by 50-70%), but does not abolish, the enhancer activity of SX2 in transient expression assays, suggesting that other sequences contribute to enhancer function. Directly upstream of the AP-1 binding sites are two copies of a sequence motif, TGAGGAAAT, which resemble elements found in cellular and viral genes that are known to interact with the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family of transcription factors. These SX2 sequences bind specifically to liver-enriched, heat-stable nuclear proteins and confer C/EBP alpha-dependent transactivation of the heterologous chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. Site-directed mutagenesis of these 9-base pair elements abolishes protein binding and transactivation, establishing these sequences as functional C/EBP binding sites. Stably transfected SX2/CAT fusion genes are induced between 37- and 44-fold in mouse hepatoma, Hepa, cells and between 52- and 111-fold in mouse fibroblast L929 cells in response to CdCl2 treatment. Subfragments of SX2 lacking the AP-1 binding elements do not mediate cadmium-dependent activation of the CAT gene, whereas subfragments containing the AP-1 binding elements, but lacking the C/EBP binding sites, exhibit only partial transcriptional activity. Site-directed mutagenesis of one or more of the C/EBP and AP-1 binding sites indicates that each of these elements is required for optimal activity of the SX2 enhancer fragment. The AP-1 binding elements, however, appear to be more important for induction as constructs containing multiple copies of either of the AP-1 binding elements, but not the C/EBP binding sequences, are readily activated by CdCl2. Treatment of Hepa cells with cadmium or heme does not alter the nuclear concentration of AP-1 or C/EBP binding activity."
https://openalex.org/W1490235594,"Cell-free hemoglobin (Hb) is a purified preparation of human hemoglobin that is being developed as a resuscitation fluid. In vivo administration of hemoglobin has resulted in significant toxicity, due in part to contamination with bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)). To better understand this toxicity, we have studied the interaction between Hb and LPS. Mixtures of each of three different Hb preparations (cross-linked alpha alpha Hb, cross-linked carbon monoxy-alpha alpha HbCO, and non-cross-linked (native) HbAo) and LPS (Escherichia coli O26:B6 or Proteus mirabilis S1959) were examined by several independent methods for evidence of Hb.LPS complex formation. Binding assays in microtiter plates demonstrated saturable binding of LPS to immobilized Hb, with a kD of 3.1 x 10(-8) M. Binding of LPS to Hb also was demonstrated wiht a radiolabeled LPS photoaffinity probe. Ultrafiltration of Hb/LPS mixtures by 300- and 100-kDa cut-off membranes showed that the majority of LPS in these mixtures (87-97 and 64-72%, respectively) was detected in the filtrates, in contrast to the lack of filterability of LPS in the absence of Hb. Density centrifugation demonstrated that LPS co-migrated with each of the three Hbs, whereas unbound LPS had a distinctly greater sedimentation velocity than Hb or Hb.LPS complexes. Nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated that in the presence of Hb, LPS migrated into the gel and co-electrophoresed with Hb, whereas LPS alone did not appreciably enter the gel. Finally, precipitation by ethanol of each of the three Hb preparations was increased in the presence of LPS compared with precipitation in the absence of LPS. Interaction of LPS with each of the three Hb preparations was also associated with altered biological activity of LPS, as shown by enhancement of LPS activation of Limulus amebocyte lysate. Therefore, our data provide several lines of independent evidence for Hb-LPS complex formation and indicated that LPS exhibited altered physical characteristics and enhanced biological activity in the presence of Hb."
https://openalex.org/W1561106276,"Endocytosis of cell surface receptors requires sequence consisting of tight turn structures with an essential Tyr or Phe residue. To determine mechanisms through which cells recognize this information, we utilized exon 16 of the human insulin receptor in the two-hybrid system to isolate a novel 455-amino acid cytoplasmic protein that contains two LIM domains within its carboxyl terminus. Mutational analyses indicate that one of the Cys-rich Zn2+ binding LIM domains specifically recognizes active but not inactive endocytic codes contained in exon 16. These findings suggest that LIM domain structures in proteins provide molecular recognition of Tyr-containing tight turn structures."
https://openalex.org/W1504647035,"Plant starch synthesis can be distinguished from those of bacterial, fungal, and animal glycogen by the presence of multiple elongation (starch synthases) and branching enzymes. This complexity has precluded genetic assignment of functions to the various soluble starch synthases in the building of amylopectin. In Chlamydomonas, we have recently shown that defects in the major soluble starch synthase lead to a specific decrease in the amount of a subset of amylopectin chains whose length ranges between 8 and 40 glucose residues (Fontaine, T., D'Hulst, C., Maddelein, M.-L., Routier, F., Marianne-Pepin, T., Decq, A., Wieruszeski, J. M., Delrue, B., Van Den Koornhuyse, N., Bossu, J.-P., Fournet, B., and Ball, S. G. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 16223-16230). We now demonstrate that granule-bound starch synthase, the enzyme that was thought to be solely responsible for amylose synthesis, is involved in amylopectin synthesis. Disruption of the Chlamydomonas granule-bound starch synthase structural gene establishes that synthesis of long chains by this enzyme can become an absolute requirement for amylopectin synthesis in particular mutant backgrounds. In the sole presence of soluble starch synthase I, Chlamydomonas directs the synthesis of a major water-soluble polysaccharide fraction and minute amounts of a new type of highly branched granular material, whose structure is intermediate between those of glycogen and amylopectin. These results lead us to propose that the nature of the elongation enzyme conditions the synthesis of distinct size classes of glucans in all starch fractions."
https://openalex.org/W1563802951,"Six open reading frames (ORFs) were identified by DNA sequencing of 5.7 kilobase pairs at the left end of the act cluster (the so-called region), in the order: ORFB, ORFA, ORF1, ORF2, ORF3, ORF4. ORF1-4 are transcribed rightward and in the same direction as the ORFs of the actVA region which lies to the right of the actVI region, whereas ORFA and ORFB run in the opposite direction. By complementation of mutants and gene disruption of the wild type strain, the two previously genetically characterized actVI mutations were assigned to ORF1. Although disruption of ORFB and ORF4, using phi C31 derivatives, did not cause any obvious change in actinorhodin production, defects in actinorhodin synthesis were obtained by insertional inactivation of ORFA, ORF1, ORF2, or ORF3. RNA analysis within the ORF1/ORFA intergenic region showed overlapping divergent promoters, at least one of which is under the control of the actII-ORF4 gene product, the transcriptional activator of the act cluster. Data base searches with the deduced products of ORFB and ORF3 failed to show any significant similarities with other known proteins. The deduced product of ORFA strongly resembles those of genes of unknown function from Saccharopolyspora hirsuta and Streptomyces roseofulvus, located within polyketide synthase clusters. The ORF1 product strongly resembles beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenases of bacteria and mammals and the ORF2 and ORF4 products resemble each other and enoyl reductases from bacteria, animals, and plants, with a highly conserved cofactor-binding domain. These findings strongly suggest that the actVI region is involved in catalyzing reduction processes that determine the two stereochemical configurations at C-3/C-15 during actinorhodin biosynthesis. A scheme is proposed for the middle steps of the biosynthesis, that is formation of the pyran ring, leading to the benzoisochromanequinone structure."
https://openalex.org/W1558769296,"A pair of polyclonal antibodies have been produced in rabbits which recognize two phosphorylated forms of cardiac muscle protein, phospholamban. The two sites of phosphorylation of this protein are situated on neighboring residues and yet one antibody, PS-16, recognizes Ser16 phosphoprotein, while other, PT-17, recognizes Thr17 phosphoprotein. Neither antibody recognizes phospholamban phosphorylated at the other site, nor do they recognize free phosphoamino acids or dephosphorylated protein. This represents most demanding test of technique of phosphorylation site-specific antibody production to date, which these antibodies have satisfied without ambiguity. These antibodies remain specific for phospholamban in company of other muscle phosphoproteins and will be invaluable in determining role of each phosphorylation site in biology of heart. They also demonstrate absolute specificity of phosphorylation site-specific antibodies and augur well for use of this approach in study of other phosphoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1543482838,"The two major glycoforms of full-length human thrombomodulin (TM), one with (TM(CS+)) and one without (TM(CS-)) chondroitin sulfate (CS) were analyzed on Western blots of primary and transformed cells and in cells expressing recombinant TM. TM on the surface of Chinese hamster ovary and COS-7 cells is solely TM(CS-). Primary arterial endothelial cells (HAEC and HPAEC) express a greater fraction of TM with CS attached than venous cells (HUVEC). Human lung carcinoma cells (A549) express more TM(CS+) than primary cells and recombinant TM on human melanoma cells (CHL-1) occurs in two very high molecular weight forms of TM(CS+). We explored this variation in TM(CS+) with soluble recombinant TM in several cell lines and analyzed the ambiguous CS addition site in human TM by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutation of Ser474 to Ala blocks CS addition in Chinese hamster ovary and COS-7 cells but not CHL-1 cells which add CS to Ser472 and Ser474. Structure of the O-link domain affects partitioning into TM(CS+) since substituting with the decorin CS addition sequence, substituting all Ser and Thr except Ser474 with Ala, and deleting around the potential beta-turn all increase the ratio of TM(CS+) to TM(CS-). A combination of the decorin substitution and deletion of the remaining O-link domain yields the most TM(CS+)."
https://openalex.org/W1585892031,"A vacuolar-type proton-translocating ATPase was extracted from ruffled membranes of chicken osteoclasts with 1% polyoxyethylene 9-lauryl ether (C12E9) and was purified 13-fold by glycerol gradient centrifugation. The isolated pump appears by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to have a subunit composition similar to that of the clathrin-coated vesicle proton pump, in that subunits of apparent molecular masses of 116, 71, 57, 40, 39, 33, and 17 kDa are present in the osteoclast pump preparation. In addition, the 116-, 71-, 57-, and 40-kDa components were shown to cross-react with specific antisera generated against the homologous subunits of the clathrin-coated vesicle proton pump. The isolated osteoclast H(+)-ATPase was reconstituted into liposomes prepared from purified lipids (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and cholesterol) by a cholate-dilution, freeze-thaw method. Proton transport catalyzed by the reconstituted pump was inhibited by bafilomycin A1 (10 nM) and N-ethylmaleimide (1 mM) but was insensitive to vanadate. We propose that osteoclast-mediated bone resorption is effected by a vacuolar-type proton pump with functional and structural similarities to that isolated from clathrin-coated vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W2402218965,"L cells and endothelial cells synthesize a heparan sulfate (HS) subpopulation, HSact, that exhibits anticoagulant activity due to a specific monosaccharide sequence; the remaining heparan sulfate, HSinact, lacks this region of defined structure and is anticoagulantly inactive. HSact biosynthesis was examined in these two cell types by stably expressing epitope-tagged rat ryudocan (ryudocan12CA5), which possesses three glycosaminoglycan (GAG) acceptor sites. Both HSact and HSinact were present on ryudocan12CA5 isolated from L cells and endothelial cells; thus, a core protein with a unique primary sequence initiates the synthesis of both GAGs. The expression in L cells of ryudocan12CA5 variants containing a single functional GAG acceptor site demonstrated that each of the three acceptor regions initiates the synthesis of both types of GAGs to a similar extent. Most importantly, in both cell types total HSact generation declined as a function of ryudocan12CA5 overexpression even though HSinact production increased linearly as a function of this variable. This discordant relationship is a general property of the biosynthetic machinery since in both cell types HSact production was reduced to an equal extent on protein cores of either exogenous or endogenous origins. The suppression of HSact generation was also observed with a secreted form of core protein lacking transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains or by a GAG acceptor site mutated form of core protein incapable of augmenting GAG synthesis. These results suggest that elevated intracellular levels of core protein saturate the capacity of a critical component of the HSact biosynthetic machinery. This critical component is not a member of the common set of biosynthetic enzymes involved in the production of HSact and HSinact since no structural changes were observed in either GAG during overexpression of core protein. Based upon the above data, we conclude that increased intracellular levels of ryudocan probably act by saturating the capacity of components which regulate HSact production by coordinating the function of biosynthetic enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1602685818,"The autoxidation of hemoglobin as a function of oxygen pressure and the effect of added nitroblue tetrazolium have been studied. It has been shown that the enhanced autoxidation at intermediate oxygen pressures can only be partially explained by the outer-sphere reaction of oxygen with deoxygenated chains. An additional enhancement associated with the properties of partially oxygenated hemoglobins has been attributed to the mobility on the distal side of the heme which facilitates the nucleophilic displacement of bound oxygen by the distal histidine. Nitroblue tetrazolium, in addition to reacting with the superoxide formed during autoxidation, is shown to oxidize directly both deoxygenated and oxygenated hemoglobin in two steps, proceeding through the one-electron reduced intermediate, a tetrazolinyl radical. Even though the oxygenated chains are oxidized by nitroblue tetrazolium, much less overall reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium is observed at high oxygen pressures. This phenomenon is attributed to the reoxidation by oxygen of both the tetrazolinyl radical and the formazan. The reaction with nitroblue tetrazolium is also found to contribute to enhanced oxidation at intermediate oxygen pressures. This behavior is explained by the two-electron reaction with nitroblue tetrazolium and the oxygen dependence of the various processes involved in the reaction of nitroblue tetrazolium."
https://openalex.org/W1535745656,"Although transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) is widely distributed in transformed cells and in some normal cells and much is known about its structure and metabolism, there is little information about its physiological actions. TGF-alpha is not thought to be synthesized by nontransformed fibroblasts, but it is thought to be a mitogen for these and epithelial cells (Derynck, R. (1986) J. Cell. Biochem. 32, 293-304). We report here that fibroblasts obtained from hamsters with oxidant-induced lung injury release TGF-alpha at levels comparable with those reported for transformed cells. In conditioned media, one isoform of 18 kDa was recognized by a monoclonal antibody to mature TGF-alpha; five isoforms ranging from 18 to 42 kDa were recognized in cell lysates. Conditioned media from these fibroblasts stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF)/TGF-alpha receptor, competed with radioactive EGF for binding sites on A431 cells, and were mitogenic for mesenchymal and epithelial cells. This mitogenic activity could be almost completely blocked by anti-TGF-alpha. Conditioned media from normal lung fibroblasts exhibited none of these activities. Using normal lung fibroblasts, we found that TGF-alpha synthesis could be induced in vitro with 25 nmol/ml EGF, suggesting that the induction in vivo may have been due, in part, to a stimulation by EGF (or TGF-alpha) released by other cell types such as alveolar macrophages recruited to the injury site. TGF-alpha is, in general, a mitogen for epithelial cells (Derynck, 1986); more specific to acute injury in the lung, it may affect the proliferation (Ryan, R. M., Mineo-Kuhn, M. M., Kromer, C. M., and Finkelstein, J. N. (1994) Am. J. Physiol. 266, L17-L23) and metabolic activities (Whitsett, J. A., Weaver, T. E., Lieberman, M. A., Clark, J. G., and Daugherty, C. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 7908-7913) of alveolar epithelial type II cells. This is, we believe, the first report of a fibroblast-derived TGF-alpha induced with oxidant injury. If this response was ubiquitously manifested in other tissues, then fibroblast-derived TGF-alpha might be an important determinant of the epithelial and mesenchymal hyperplasia commonly observed in tissue repair."
https://openalex.org/W1967572224,"Calpain, a calcium-dependent intracellular protease, was identified in Drosophila melanogaster. Drosophila calpain has an amino acid sequence highly homologous to those of mammalian calpains and exhibits a distinct domain structure consisting of cysteine protease and calcium-binding domains. Specific antibodies raised against a recombinant calpain fragment were used to identify the localization of calpain in developing Drosophila embryos. Calpain was first detected near the anterior pole and in posterior region of the embryo just after fertilization. The anterior calpain disappeared during the cleavage cycles. On the other hand, the posterior calpain moved to the posterior pole when polar buds were formed, and condensed just below the pole cells. At cleavage cycles 8 and 9, when nuclei reached the egg surface, calpain was localized between the nuclei at the surface beneath the precleavage furrows. Co-staining experiments with anti-actin antibody revealed that calpain condenses specifically at the edge of and between actin caps that underlie the plasma membrane immediately above each nucleus. These results indicate that calpain is involved in the dynamic changes in the embryonic cytoskeleton, especially actin-related structures, during early embryogenesis prior to cellularization."
https://openalex.org/W1556787189,"Three double cysteine mutants, each possessing a disulfide bond in its pore-forming domain, were used to study the translocation of colicin A through the Escherichia coli envelope. These mutated colicins were able to exert their in vivo channel activity only after their disulfide bonds had been reduced by dithiothreitol. In solution, the reduction of the disulfide bonds by dithiothreitol was a slow process whose kinetics depended on the position of the disulfide bond (t1/2 varying between 35 and 100 s). This t1/2 was strongly decreased (t1/2 = 8-9 s) upon predenaturation of the mutated colicins with urea. The t1/2 values of reduction of the mutants bound to E. coli-sensitive cells were similar to those of predenatured colicins. This suggested that the interaction of the oxidized double cysteine mutants with the E. coli envelope triggered their unfolding. The disulfide bonds did not prevent but delayed the translocation of the colicins. The amplitude of the delay and the time at which it occurred during translocation depended on the position of the disulfide bond. We could discriminate between the delays accumulated during binding to the receptor and those during the translocation via OmpF and the Tol proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1932647015,"We have evaluated the elongation rates, processivities, and abortive transcription characteristics of a set of T7 RNA polymerase mutants that map to the polymerase active site. The effects of these mutations on transcription are complex: they cause decreases in activity and processivity during both the processive and abortive phases of transcription and exhibit disproportionate decreases in activity and processivity on poly(dA).poly(dT) or poly(dT) versus poly(dG).poly(dC) templates. They also exhibit an increase in the proportion of slippage dependent poly(G) transcript synthesis during the initial stages of transcription. It is shown that these multiple, distinct effects on transcription can be attributed to decreases in the mutant enzymes' phosphodiester bond formation rates. Estimates of the decreases in these rates are derived from the measured transcript elongation rates and processivities of the mutant enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1598268803,"The role of protein phosphorylation in the formation of secretory vesicles from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and in the regulation of this process by TGN-associated trimeric G-proteins was investigated, using a previously established and a novel cell-free system derived from the neuroendocrine cell line PC12. In the absence of exogenous activators of trimeric G-proteins, okadaic acid, an inhibitor of protein serine/threonine phosphatase types 1, 2A, and PPX, had no significant effect on secretory vesicle formation as reconstituted in a postnuclear supernatant. However, okadaic acid antagonized the inhibition of secretory vesicle formation which occurred upon activation of trimeric G-proteins by either aluminum fluoride or guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)-triphosphate (GTP gamma S). Microcystin-LR, a protein phosphatase inhibitor structurally distinct from okadaic acid, also antagonized the trimeric G-protein-mediated inhibition of secretory vesicle formation but, in contrast to okadaic acid, alone was sufficient to stimulate this process. The antagonistic effect of the phosphatase inhibitors was abolished by a broad spectrum protein kinase inhibitor, staurosporine, which alone, however, did not affect vesicle formation. The effect of okadaic acid was promoted by activators of protein kinase C (phorbol myristate acetate) and protein kinase A (cyclic AMP). To investigate the subcellular localization of the phosphoprotein that is involved in the antagonistic effect of protein phosphatase inhibitors, a novel cell-free system was established which reconstitutes the formation of secretory vesicles from TGN membranes supplemented with cytosol. Using this cell-free system, the relevant phosphoprotein was found to reside in the cytosol. In conclusion, our results suggest that serine/threonine protein phosphorylation is not required for secretory vesicle formation from the TGN but modulates, via a cytosolic phosphoprotein, the regulation of this process by TGN-associated trimeric G-proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1533967094,"The protein sequence of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-2 beta (CTLA-2 beta) is 36% identical to the proregion of mouse cathepsin L (Denizot, F., Brunet, J.F., Roustan, P., Harper, K., Suzan, M., Luciani, M. F., Mattei, M. G., and Goldstein, P. (1989) Eur. J. Immunol. 19, 631-635). Here we report the expression, purification, and characterization of recombinant murine CTLA-2 beta. The protein was purified by consecutive gel-filtration, anion-exchange, and reverse-phase (C4) chromatography. Purified CTLA-2 beta exists in solution primarily as a dimer but also as a disulfide-linked tetramer as judged by size exclusion chromatography. Circular dichroism studies suggest that the dimeric form of the protein contains 8% alpha-helix, 67% beta-sheet, and 21% random coil and also indicates that there is a conformational change upon formation of the tetramer. The protein is a competitive inhibitor of certain cysteine proteases including papain (Ki = 25 nM), cathepsins L (Ki = 24 nM) and H (IC50 = 67 nM) but not cathepsin B. CTLA-2 beta forms a noncovalent complex with cathepsin L and has a stoichiometry of binding to papain of 1 mol of CTLA-2 beta/mol of papain. There is no homology between CTLA-2 beta and any of the known cysteine protease inhibitors, including the kininogens and cystatins. Therefore, CTLA-2 beta represents a novel class of cysteine protease inhibitor that is specific for the cathepsin L family of proteases."
https://openalex.org/W1595563379,"In murine somatic cells, transcription of the single gene encoding beta 4-galactosyltransferase results in two transcripts of 4.1 and 3.9 kilobases (kb), as a consequence of the use of two transcriptional start sites that are located on exon one separated by 200 base pairs (bp). In early male germ cell development, spermatogonia use only the 4.1-kb start site to yield a transcript that is identical to its somatic cell counterpart. As these cells enter meiosis, there is a switch from the use of this somatic cell start site to the exclusive use, beginning in pachytene spermatocytes, of a male germ cell-specific start site. Germ cell-specific transcripts are distinguished from their somatic counterparts by an additional approximately 560 nucleotides of 5'-untranslated sequence that is located immediately upstream and contiguous with the transcriptional start site defined for the 4.1-kb mRNA (Harduin-Lepers, A., Shaper, N.L., Mahoney, J.A., and Shaper, J.H. (1992) Glycobiology 2, 361-368). This observation predicts the use of a different upstream male germ cell-specific promoter. In this study we show that a 796-bp fragment containing 543 bp of genomic sequence upstream of the germ cell specific transcriptional start site and 253 bp of flanking downstream sequence, directs expression of the reporter gene, beta-galactosidase, exclusively to the pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids of transgenic mice. This pattern of cell type-specific expression of the transgene is comparable with that of the endogenous beta 4-galactosyltransferase gene."
https://openalex.org/W1580670703,"RecA protein-mediated DNA strand exchange between circular single-stranded DNA and linear duplex DNA readily bypasses short (up to 100 base pairs) heterologous inserts in one of the DNA substrates. Larger heterologous inserts are bypassed with decreasing efficiency, and inserts larger than 200 base pairs substantially block RecA-mediated DNA strand exchange. The RuvA and RuvB proteins dramatically facilitate the bypass of larger heterologous inserts. When the RuvA and RuvB proteins are added to an ongoing RecA protein-mediated strand exchange reaction, interior heterologous inserts of 1 kilobase pair are bypassed at significant frequencies. The RuvA, RuvB, and RecA proteins are all required for this activity. Bypass occurs only when homologous sequences are present on both sides of the insert. When the heterologous insert is positioned at either end of the linear duplex substrate, the RuvA and RuvB proteins do not significantly increase product formation in RecA protein-mediated DNA strand exchange reactions. The results suggest an important role for RuvA and RuvB in the bypass of DNA structural barriers during recombinational DNA repair."
https://openalex.org/W1614079693,"Bowman's membrane is an acellular matrix of the cornea which lies between the epithelial basal lamina and the corneal stroma. By immunoelectron microscopy, we have determined that types I and V collagen are components of the collagen fibrils in Bowman's membrane of the chick cornea. Although these same components are found in the fibrils of the stroma, the fibrils of Bowman's membrane are smaller in diameter and less uniform than those of the stroma. At early stages of development, the corneal epithelium synthesizes the types I and II collagen of the primary stroma. We therefore asked whether it might also be capable of synthesizing the type V collagen found in Bowman's membrane at later stages of development. Our results, using competitive polymerase chain reaction to quantitate mRNA from avian corneal cells, indicate that the amount of alpha 1(V) collagen mRNA present in epithelia, relative to alpha 2(I) collagen mRNA, is greater than that in stromal fibroblasts. We postulate that this enables the epithelium to synthesize a higher ratio of type V to type I collagen than the stroma and that this proportionally higher amount of type V might account for the ultrastructural appearance of the fibrils in Bowman's membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1526027182,"Abstract The suggestion that acidic residues in the hydrophobic NH2-terminal domains of Mel permease (Asp-31 in helix I, Asp-51 and Asp-55 in helix II, Asp-120 in helix IV) may be essential components of a coordination network involved in cation recognition (Pourcher, T., Zani, M.L., and Leblanc, G. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 3209-3215) is further analyzed using site-directed mutagenesis. To study whether nearby polar residues also contribute to the cation recognition process, Tyr-24, Tyr-27 and Tyr-28 (aligned with Asp-31) and Tyr-109 and Tyr-116 (aligned with Asp-120) were individually converted into a phenylalanine. The effect of replacing Arg-48 (aligned with Asp-51 and Asp-55) or Asn-83 (in the middle of helix III) by an alanine was also studied. The importance of the position of the carboxylate of the residue at position 31, 51, 55, or 120 was next examined by replacing each Asp by a Glu residue. Sugar binding and/or transport activity measurements indicate that all polar-->apolar or Asp-->Glu mutants use Na+ or Li+ for active sugar transport. Moreover, two groups of mutants could be distinguished. One group, composed of Y27F, Y28F, D31E, and Y109F mutants, retains wild type permease properties. A second group (Y24F, N83A, and Y116F and also D51E, D55E, and D120E) exhibits concomitant reduction of affinity for sodium and sugars and altered sugar specificity but conserves wild type cation selectivity profile. The data reinforce the notion that Asp-51, Asp-55, and Asp-120 residues and the position of their carboxyl side chains are of primary importance for cation recognition. Finally, since Mel permease properties are predominantly modified by mutagenizing residues located in the cytoplasmic half of the permease, we propose that Mel permease has a well-like shape opened toward the periplasmic space and is closed at its cytoplasmic extremity by a gate."
https://openalex.org/W1557401207,"Abstract The structure of the human leukocyte-common antigen-related molecule (LAR) protein tyrosine phosphatase gene was elucidated using phage and cosmid genomic DNA clones. The LAR gene is composed of 33 exons spanning over 85 kilobase pairs. Exon 2 encodes the signal sequence and the first four amino acids in the mature LAR protein. The three immunoglobulin-like domains are encoded by exons 3-7, and the eight fibronectin type III (Fn-III) domains by exons 8-17. Exons 18-22 encode the juxta-membrane and transmembrane domains, and exons 23-33 encode the two conserved tyrosine phosphatase domains and the entire 3'-untranslated region. Exon 1, which presumably encodes the 5'-untranslated sequence, has not been identified. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed the alternative splicing of a mini-exon (exon 13) in the Fn-III domain 5 of human LAR and other related genes (rat LAR, rat PTP sigma, and human PTP delta). RNase protection analysis showed that the human LAR mRNA in which exon 13 is spliced-out is the major mRNA species in all cell lines examined. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed further alternative splicing of LAR mRNA involving the Fn-III domains 4, 5, 6, and 7 in various combinations. These findings will facilitate the understanding of the physiological functions of the LAR extracellular domain."
https://openalex.org/W1504457564,"Abstract Adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose phosphate (Appr > p) is produced as a result of transfer RNA (tRNA) splicing in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and probably in other eukaryotes. Endonucleolytic cleavage and ligation result in a mature length tRNA with a 2'-phosphate at the splice junction. This 2'-phosphate is transferred to NAD to produce Appr > p. Metabolism of Appr > p requires hydrolysis of the phosphate linkage. We show here that yeast has a unique cyclic phosphodiesterase that can hydrolyze Appr > p, ribose 1,2-cyclic phosphate, and ribose 1,3-cyclic phosphate to the corresponding ribose 1-phosphate derivatives. The cyclic phosphodiesterase is highly specific for Appr > p; there is 20-fold less activity on ribose 1,3-cyclic phosphate and no detectable activity on nucleoside 2',3'-cyclic phosphates. A similar cyclic phosphodiesterase is present in wheat germ. The wheat germ cyclic phosphodiesterase activity co-chromatographs with a 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase that was previously identified and purified. The purified wheat germ enzyme has a distinct preference for Appr > p and ribose cyclic phosphate compared to guanosine 2',3'-cyclic phosphate and shares other biochemical characteristics with the yeast enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1560112362,"We have investigated the characteristics of clonal L cell mutant VI-7 that has previously been demonstrated to exhibit reduced levels of cell surface proteoglycans containing heparan sulfate (HS) with regions of defined monosaccharide sequence that interact with antithrombin (HSact) (de Agostini, A. L., Lau, H. K., Leone, C., Youssoufian, H., and Rosenberg, R. D. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87, 9784-9788). Pulse labeling revealed that the synthesis of HSact in mutant cells, as compared to wild-type cells, was reduced by 5-7-fold, which is identical to the previously observed reduction in cell surface-bound antithrombin. This alteration is independent of growth state since production of HSact by mutant cells, as compared to wild-type cells, is decreased to a similar extent in exponentially growing and post-confluent cultures. The synthetic defect was specific for HSact since production of total HS and chondroitin sulfate by mutant cells, as compared to wild-type cells, was identical in magnitude. The synthetic abnormality is not due to an alteration in core protein since complementation was not observed when mutant cells were stably transfected with the epitope-tagged ryudocan cDNA which can initiate HSact production. Structural analyses revealed that HS from mutant cells, as compared to wild-type cells, exhibited normal molecular weight, extent and distribution of sulfate, and disaccharide composition, which indicate that the mutation did not affect HS biosynthetic enzymes. Together, the data suggest that mutant VI-7 is defective in a regulatory component which directly or indirectly coordinates HS biosynthetic enzymes to specifically generate the defined monosaccharide sequence of HSact."
https://openalex.org/W1606541230,"We report a direct square-wave voltammetric study of the iron-sulfur enzyme, aconitase, at the pyrolytic graphite edge electrode. New and established redox driven reactions were observed and the equilibrium reduction potential for each couple was determined: E0'[3Fe-4S]1+/0 = -268 mV, E0'[4Fe-4S]2+/1+ = -450 mV, E0'[4Fe-4S]3+/2+ = +100 mV, E0'Linear Form = -281 mV, and putatively, E0'[3Fe-4S]0/2- congruent to -1000 mV, all versus normal hydrogen electrode. Most importantly we have directly observed the superoxidized [4Fe-4S]3+ form of aconitase (originally proposed by Emptage, M. H., Dreyer, J.-L., Kennedy, M. C., and Beinert, H. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 11106-11111) and directly followed its conversion to the [3Fe-4S]1+ form; this intermediate is required for the deactivation of aconitase. Without exogenous ferrous iron, [3Fe-4S]0 aconitase is apparently super-reduced at very negative potentials to the [3Fe-4S]2- form and the concomitant formation of [4Fe-4S]2+ aconitase was followed over time. It is the apparent decomposition of super-reduced [3Fe-4S]2- aconitase that provides the source of ferrous iron for the interconversion of [3Fe-4S]0 aconitase to the [4Fe-4S]2+ form. Voltammetry of free and substrate bound [4Fe-4S]2+ aconitase showed that the latter is less susceptible to oxidation but, surprisingly, has the same E0'[4Fe-4S]3+/2+."
https://openalex.org/W1537536797,"We have previously shown that the rat osteoblastic cell line UMR 106-01 responds to parathyroid hormone treatment by secreting interstitial collagenase. Secreted collagenase reaches a maximal concentration 12-24 h after parathyroid hormone stimulation, but then declines to undetectable levels by 96 h. Neither spontaneous nor cell-mediated extracellular degradation could account for this disappearance, since the enzyme maintained stability in both fresh and conditioned media. Instead, a cell-mediated binding mechanism was suggested by the rapid and saturable removal of exogenous purified rat collagenase at 37 degrees C. Binding studies using 125I-collagenase at 4 degrees C indicated a saturable receptor of a single class and 12,000 receptors per cell (Kd = 5 x 10(-9) M). A time course revealed specific receptor-mediated binding within 10 min and equilibrium by 60 min, while dissociation experiments further demonstrated reversibility. The kinetics of 125I-collagenase binding are characterized by the association (k1 = 4 x 10(6) M-1 min-1) and dissociation (k-1 = 2 x 10(-3) min-1) rate constants. The receptor was shown to be specific for rat collagenase since a host of related and unrelated proteins failed to compete for binding. Internalization studies revealed maximal intracellular accumulation at 30 min and complete degradation by 90 min, suggesting this receptor functions in these osteoblastic cells to eliminate extracellular collagenase."
https://openalex.org/W122230716,"Streptonigrin stimulated unique intensity patterns of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage in agarose and sequencing gels with no similarity to those of doxorubicin, VM-26,4'(9-acridinylamino)-methanesulfon-m-anisidide, genistein, and mitoxantrone. Surprisingly, a statistical analysis of 60 sites stimulated by streptonigrin in SV40 and pBR322 DNAs showed that the drug required the dinucleotide 5'-TA-3' from 2- to 3-positions at the DNA cleavage site. Streptonigrin did not intercalate into the double helix; however, a positive value of the reduced linear dichroism indicated that indeed the drug interacted with the DNA. An angle of 45 degrees was found between the major drug and local DNA axes, suggesting a minor groove binding mode. Moreover, a DNA winding assay showed that streptonigrin may tighten the helical twist of DNA, similar to the known minor groove binder distamycin. Drug competition for receptor site binding was then evaluated by drug combination in the cleavage reaction. DNA cleavage intensity patterns were altered only with the streptonigrin/mitoxantrone combination, suggesting that the two compounds may compete for ternary complex formation. The results indicate that streptonigrin may bind to the DNA in a manner similar to that of minor groove binders and that its pharmacophore, possibly different from other topoisomerase II inhibitors, may be an important determinant of its unique sequence position specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1520106746,"The regulatory (p85 alpha) and catalytic (p110 alpha) subunits of the mammalian phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase have been expressed in insect cells using the baculovirus sytem. The free catalytic subunit p110 alpha and the coexpressed heterodimeric complex of p85 alpha and p110 alpha were purified and their enzymological properties compared. While many kinetic parameters were similar, the coexpressed complex was found to have a 20-fold higher Km for ATP in comparison with the free catalytic subunit p110 alpha using phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate as a substrate; no significant difference was detectable when phosphatidylinositol was used. Reconstitution of the p110 alpha.p85 alpha complex in vitro showed that it had the properties of the free p110 alpha and not the p110 alpha.p85 alpha in vivo complex. Therefore, a post-translational modification dependent upon the presence of the regulatory subunit p85 alpha rather than the physical subunit interaction itself is responsible for the observed properties of the lipid kinase activity of the p110 alpha.p85 alpha complex. Phosphatase treatment of the purified lipid kinase complex reduced the high Km for ATP, suggesting that a phosphorylation of the heterodimeric complex (p85 alpha.p110 alpha) caused this effect. This mode of regulation is discussed in the context of lipid kinase activation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1656287364,"The effects of the histone-like proteins, HU, IHF, and Fis on DNA replication have been examined in vitro using the oriC and pBR322 DNA replication systems. In the oriC system, although low concentrations of HU and IHF stimulated DNA replication, no stimulation was observed upon the addition of Fis. On the contrary, high concentrations of Fis inhibited oriC DNA replication completely. The inhibitory effect of Fis could be overcome when HU, IHF, or RNA polymerase were also present in the reaction mixtures. Unwinding of duplex DNA at the origin correlated with the elevated level of DNA replication. In contrast, only inhibition, rather than stimulation, was observed when these proteins were added to the pBR322 DNA replication system. Thus, the observed dependence on Fis of oriC DNA replication in vivo cannot be attributed to a positive effect on localized DNA unwinding."
https://openalex.org/W1514715971,"Plasmolipin is an 18-kDa proteolipid protein found in kidney and brain, where it is restricted to the apical surface of tubular epithelial cells and to mammalian myelinated tracts, respectively (Sapirstein, V.S., Nolan, C. E., Stadler, I.I., and Fischer, I. (1992) J. Neurosci. Res. 31, 96-102; Cochary, E. F., Bizzozero, O. A., Sapirstein, V. S., Nolan, C. E., and Fischer, I. (1990) J. Neurochem. 55, 602-610). Addition of plasmolipin to lipid bilayers induces the formation of ion channels, which are voltage-dependent and K(+)-selective (Tosteson, M. T., and Sapirstein, V. S. (1981) J. Membr. Biol 63, 77-84). The present study describes the isolation and cloning of plasmolipin cDNA that includes the sequence of the complete coding region of the protein, the analysis of plasmolipin mRNA expression and a proposed model for its membrane structure. Northern blot analysis 1) shows that plasmolipin is encoded by a 1.7-kilobase mRNA, 2) confirms that the distribution of plasmolipin is restricted to kidney and brain, and 3) indicates that the expression of plasmolipin mRNA in cultured oligodendrocytes increases with cell maturation consistent with changes in the level of the protein. Restriction enzyme digestion of DNA followed by Southern blot analysis indicates that plasmolipin is encoded by a single gene. Sequence analysis of plasmolipin cDNA shows an open reading frame encoding a 157-amino acid protein of 17.4 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence confirms the hydrophobic nature and high helical content of the protein and predicts a structure with four transmembrane domains similar to several other small hydrophobic proteins implicated in ion movement. The proposed model for membrane topology shows an enrichment of hydroxyl groups within two of the transmembrane domains and places cysteine residues near the extracellular membrane surface. Examination of protein sequence data bases reveals little overall homology with other proteins including proteolipids; however, three of the four transmembrane segments of plasmolipin show strong similarity with known membrane transport proteins. These results indicate that plasmolipin is an unique proteolipid protein that may participate in ion transport events specific to select membrane domains."
https://openalex.org/W1651792810,"Different elements of voltage-gated Ca2+ influx and their role for cytosolic-free Ca2+, [Ca2+]i, were studied in cells of the pituitary line GH3B6. Single cell monitoring of [Ca2+]i with the fluorescent probe indo-1, as well as fast on-line ratio [Ca2+]i imaging with fura-2, were combined with electrophysiological recordings using the perforated patch configuration of the patch clamp technique. [Ca2+]i signals are generated by Ca2+ influx both during action potentials and in between. Steady state Ca2+ influx at resting potentials (-60 to -40 mV) was voltage-gated and sensitive to the dihydropyridine antagonist PN 200-110. Ca2+ influx could be demonstrated in physiological conditions as inward Ca2+ currents of maximally 10 pA, which were triggered when stepping up the holding voltage beyond a narrow threshold around -50 mV. Inward currents were well correlated with [Ca2+]i elevations (R = -0.8; p < 0.001). It is concluded that dihydropyridine-sensitive, low threshold voltage-gated steady state Ca2+ currents, which may be tonically activated at resting potentials, provide for [Ca2+]i signaling in excitable endocrine cells in a mode that parallels the modulation of Ca2+ influx during action potentials."
https://openalex.org/W101723827,"In an attempt to isolate new G protein-coupled receptors from turkey erythrocytes, reverse transcribed polymerase chain reaction was performed on fetal turkey blood RNA using degenerate primers based on conserved sequences present in seven transmembrane receptors. An open reading frame in one of the clones, designated 4C (497 base pairs), displayed approximately 50-60% identity to all of the previously cloned beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-ARs). A lambda-DASH turkey genomic library was screened with a probe generated from the partial 4C cDNA, and the gene encoding this receptor was localized to a 3.5-kilobase pair HindIII fragment. Ribonuclease protection analysis of turkey lung mRNA indicated that the 3‘ end of the coding sequence of the 4C gene, like beta 3-AR, was interrupted by an intron. To obtain the cDNA sequence of 4C, RNA-polymerase chain reaction was performed using primers complementary to regions identified by ribonuclease protection analysis to be present in 4C mRNA. Comparison of the genomic and cDNA sequences of 4C indicated that the first exon encodes 414 amino acids of the protein, the second exon (68 base pairs) encodes an additional 12 residues followed by a stop codon, and the third exon is composed of 3‘-untranslated sequence. The 4C receptor was transiently expressed in COS-1 cells, and the apparent affinities of a series of beta-AR agonists and antagonists were determined using [125I]iodocyanopindolol. As implicated by its amino acid sequence, 4C displayed a pharmacological selectivity that was consistent with that of a beta-AR but distinct from other cloned beta-ARs. Isoproterenol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner in mouse L cells stably expressing the 4C receptor. No effect on phospholipase C activity was observed. Ribonuclease protection assays indicated that 4C mRNA exhibits a broad tissue distribution, which suggests that it may play an important role in avian physiology."
https://openalex.org/W1495242750,"Expression of hst (k-FGF, FGF-4), a member of the fibroblast growth factor gene family, is restricted to early stages of developing embryos and to embryonal carcinoma cells. In F9, which is a prototype of embryonal carcinoma cells expressing hst, the expression of hst gene is positively regulated by a downstream octamer motif that functions as an enhancer. We have investigated, by chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter fusion gene analysis in F9, the cis-acting regulatory element within the hst promoter region that interacts with this enhancer. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and methylation interference analysis showed that the hst promoter contains, in a segment termed Y, the sequence 5'-CTGATTGGCA-3', which closely resembles the consensus binding motif for the CCAAT-binding factor NF-Y. Deletions or mutations in this element substantially reduced expression of hst-CAT constructs. The nuclear factor binding to the Y segment of the hst promoter was indistinguishable from NF-Y, as inferred from interactions with specific anti-NF-Y monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. We conclude that the expression of the hst gene in F9 is positively regulated by the coordinated interaction between an NF-Y-binding site and an octamer motif."
https://openalex.org/W1542511706,"Ribonuclease H activities present in fully grown Xenopus oocytes were investigated by using either liquid assays or renaturation gel assays. Whereas the test in solution detected an apparently unique class I ribonuclease H activity, the activity gels did not detect this enzyme but another one with the molecular weight expected for a class II ribonuclease H. The ribonuclease HI was found to be primarily concentrated in the germinal vesicle, but around 5% of this activity was detectged in the cytoplasm and may correspond to the activity involved in antisense oligonucleotide-mediated destruction of messenger RNAs. The concentration of this class I ribonuclease H in oocytes is similar to that in somatic cells. The class II ribonuclease H remained undetectable by the test in solution because its activity was cryptic. On activity gel, a polypeptide with the apparent molecular mass of 32 kDa, expected for a ribonuclease HII, was found to be concentrated in mitochondria although no RNase H activity could be detected by using the liquid assay. Based on sedimentation studies, we hypothesize that the apparent absence of RNase H activity in solution could be the result of the association of this 32-kDa polypeptide with other polypeptides, or possibly nucleic acids, to form a multimer of, until now, unknown function."
https://openalex.org/W1595639762,"The interferons-tau (IFN-tau) are Type I IFN, 172 amino acids in length, which are produced by the trophoblast of ruminant ungulate species and whose only known function is in triggering maternal responses to pregnancy. These IFN have the normal antiviral and antiproliferative activities exhibited by other Type I IFN, such as IFN-alpha and -beta, and are predicted to have similar structures based on five alpha-helices (A-E). A series of ovine IFN-tau variants was prepared with alterations in the carboxyl-terminal region in residues not expected to interact directly with the Type I receptor. Replacement of Ile143 with Thr in helix E significantly lowered receptor binding affinity to about 5% of control values, reduced antiviral activity to about 13% of control values, and abolished antiproliferative activity completely. Deletion of the terminal 11 residues from the carboxyl termini of these 172 amino acid IFN also reduced antiviral activities (approximately 5% of control) and antiproliferative proteins (1-2% of control), but had only slight negative influence on receptor binding. Deletion of Lys160, but not its replacement with Ala, had similar consequences to deleting the entire 11-amino acid carboxyl terminus. These studies show that mutations can be introduced into IFN-tau that influence antiviral and antiproliferative activities differentially and that the carboxyl tail of the molecule is important for signal transduction but not for primary receptor binding."
https://openalex.org/W1515568468,"Asialoglycoproteins (ASG) are internalized by hepatocytes by ASG receptor (ASGR)-mediated endocytosis. We have shown previously that when a plasmid DNA, pAlb(9-12)CAT (expressing chloramphenicol acetyltransferase driven by an albumin promoter enhancer), was complexed with an ASG-polylysine conjugate and injected intravenously in rats, 80% of the DNA was internalized by the liver. In normal recipient rats, over 95% of the internalized DNA was degraded in 4 h; the plasmid was undetectable after 48 h. In contrast, when 66% hepatectomy was performed 20 min after DNA administration, the internalized DNA persisted for several weeks in cytoplasmic vesicles (Chowdhury, N. R., Wu, C. H., Wu, B. Y., Yerneni, P. C., Bommineni, V. R., and Chowdhury, J. R. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 11265-11271). Since microtubules are required for the translocation of ligand-containing endosomes to lysosomes, the site of ligand degradation, we hypothesized that persistence of the endocytosed DNA might be related to changes in microtubular structure and function. To test this hypothesis, we examined hepatocellular microtubules by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. Liver from untreated rats or sham-operated controls showed a network of fibrillar microtubules throughout the cytoplasm. The extent of the microtubular network was substantially reduced 3-6 h after 66% hepatectomy. By 24 h, microtubules had regenerated. Intraportal infusion of cycloheximide (250 mg/kg body weight) 15 min before 66% hepatectomy, prevented microtubular disruption, indicating that protein synthesis is required for this process. Immunotransblot analysis showed that hepatic alpha-tubulin concentration remained unchanged through microtubular disassembly and subsequent reassembly, which is consistent with conservation and reutilization of tubulin released by depolymerization of microtubules."
https://openalex.org/W1573614693,"We describe a procedure to separate stacked and unstacked membranes from the prochlorophyte Prochlorothrix hollandica that is based on methods used for the separation of grana and stroma thylakoids from chloroplasts. Stacked membranes were isolated from Triton X-100-treated whole thylakoid preparations, unstacked membranes from French press disrupted cells. Membrane fractions were isolated by differential centrifugation. The stacked membranes were enriched in photosystem (PS) II and a chlorophyll a/b-binding antenna complex, whereas the unstacked membranes contained PS I and the ATP synthase. No evidence for a PS I-associated chlorophyll a/b antenna system was obtained. The PS II-associated chlorophyll a/b antenna complex is composed of several apoproteins in the molecular mass range from 32 to 38 kDa. The 38-kDa protein of this complex becomes phosphorylated on its stromal surface by a light-activated kinase, but, unlike the light-harvesting II complex of chloroplasts, it does not migrate from grana to stroma membrane regions. Overall, the thylakoid membranes of Prochlorothrix exhibit a remarkably similar organization to those of chloroplasts, especially in terms of the non-random distribution of protein complexes between grana and stroma thylakoid membranes. However, in contrast to the rapidly reversible phosphorylation-dependent state 1-state 2 response of light-harvesting complex associated with PS II in chloroplasts, the slowly reversible phosphorylation in Prochlorothrix leads only to a functional uncoupling from PS II but not to its redistribution between stacked and unstacked membrane regions."
https://openalex.org/W1548506121,"Abstract Fluorescence spectroscopy has been used to study the interaction of Tb3+ (as a Ca2+ analog) with the purified ryanodine receptor (RyR)/Ca2+ release channel of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum. Tb3+ replaces Ca2+ in both the high- and the low-affinity sites. Occupation of the low-affinity site (inhibitory), but not of the high-affinity Ca2+ binding site (activating), by Tb3+ results in a strong enhanced green fluorescence (at 543 nm) and in an inhibition of ryanodine binding. The Tb3+ concentrations required for half-maximal enhanced fluorescence and inhibition of ryanodine binding were: 22.5 +/- 2.5 microM (n = 4) and 22.3 +/- 3.1 microM (n = 2), respectively. Tb3+ appears to bind to the protein at two or more cooperative sites (nH = 2.4) and to dissociate from these sites with three different rate constants (K-1,1 = 361 +/- 250 min-1 (n = 6); K-1,2 = 0.45 +/- 0.22 min-1 (n = 11); K-1,3 = 0.011 +/- 0.013 min-1 (n = 7). The enhancement in Tb3+ fluorescence is very fast (K1 > 5 x 10(5) M-1.min-1), and it is quenched by EGTA, La3+, or Ca2+ addition. About 20% of the bound Tb3+ was not displaced by EGTA or Ca2+; suggesting its occlusion in the RyR. This is also reflected in the partially irreversible inhibition of ryanodine binding by Tb3+. Reconstitution of sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles into a planar bilayer lipid membrane showed that the Ca2+ release channel was activated by submicromolar and inhibited by micromolar concentrations of Tb3+ and La3+. The Tb(3+)-activated channel showed an enhancement of the open dwell time of the channel. The results suggest that RyR/Ca2+ release channel undergoes conformational changes due to Tb3+ binding to the low-affinity Ca2+ binding site, and this binding results in the closing of the Ca2+ release channel."
https://openalex.org/W1551874129,"The peroxisomal membrane appears to play a crucial role in transporting proteins into the organelle. Some human genetic disorders involving peroxisome biogenesis, such as Zellweger syndrome, may be caused by genetic defects of the import machinery located in the peroxisomal membrane. In order to characterize the proteins of the human peroxisomal membrane, we isolated peroxisomes from human liver. We obtained their membranes using various procedures and analyzed their proteins by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining. We compared the protein composition of peroxisomal membranes with membranes derived from mitochondria and microsomes. The main peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) have apparent molecular masses of 147, 112, 95, 87, 81, 79, 74, 69(70), 53-52 (double band), 47, 45, 43, 37, 31, 28, 22, and 17 kDa. The following PMPs of 147, 112, 79, 69(70), 53-52 (double band), 47, 43, 31, 28, 22, and 17 kDa fit the criteria for integral membrane proteins. We then produced rabbit polyclonal and mouse monoclonal antibodies that recognized some human PMPs. One of these antibodies detected mainly PMP43. We used this antiserum to evaluate the presence and subcellular distribution of the PMP43 in fibroblasts derived from patients affected by Zellweger syndrome. These results represent new information about the protein composition of the human peroxisomal membrane and provide biological tools for further characterization of the human PMPs and their genes in normal and pathological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1493806471,"Peptides derived from various regions of type V adenylyl cyclase (AC) were studied to determine their effect on AC catalytic activity. Out of 10 examined, only one peptide, peptide 2 (Lys425-Cys444), significantly inhibited both basal and stimulated (forskolin or GTP gamma S (guanosine 5'-O-thiotriphosphate)) type V AC catalytic activity overexpressed in CMT cells. The sequence of this peptide was taken from the first cytoplasmic domain of type V AC, which has a high sequence homology to other AC isoforms. Competition studies performed between the peptide and the substrate ATP showed that the inhibition was noncompetitive. Mutation or truncation of the peptide designed to destroy its secondary structure totally negated the inhibitory effect. This peptide also inhibited the catalytic activity of purified types II and V AC, as well as that of various cells, including S49 cyc- cells. Our data indicate that the peptide directly interacts with AC to inhibit catalytic activity; this provides new information regarding regions of the enzyme involved in its catalytic activation."
https://openalex.org/W1555737956,"Phosphorous, primarily in the form of phosphate, is a critical nutrient for the life of a cell. We have previously determined the 1.7-A resolution structure of the phosphate-binding protein, an initial receptor for the high-affinity phosphate active transport system or permease in Escherichia coli (Luecke, H., and Quiocho, F.A. (1990) Nature 347, 402-406). This structure is the first to reveal the key role of hydrogen bonding interactions in conferring the high specificity of the permease, a specificity also shared by other phosphate transport systems. Both monobasic and dibasic phosphates are recognized by the phosphate-binding protein with Asp56 playing a key role. Here we report site-directed mutagenesis, ligand binding, and crystallographic studies of the binding protein which show that introduction of one additional Asp by mutagenesis of the Thr141 in the ligand-binding site restricts binding to only the monobasic phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1606298745,"Forskolin is a potent inhibitor of mammalian passive glucose transporters. Here we show that forskolin is a remarkably specific inhibitor of energized D-galactose transport by the GalP sugar-H+ symport protein of Escherichia coli. Surprisingly, it does not inhibit transport of L-arabinose or D-xylose by the related E. coli AraE and XylE transporters, even though the amino acid sequences of their proteins are 30-64% identical to GalP and to the mammalian GLUT family. However, unlike GLUT1, photoactivation of the [3H]forskolin-GalP complex fails to incorporate radioactivity covalently into the protein, in contrast to the effective incorporation of radioactivity from [3H]cytochalasin B into both proteins. However, 3-[125I]iodo-4-azidophenethylamido-7-O-succinyldesacetylforskol in ([125I]APS-forskolin), which labels GLUT1, is a potent labeling reagent for GalP and, to a lesser extent, for AraE. The appropriate sugar substrates of each transporter protect it against the [125I]APS-forskolin. Equilibrium binding studies using membranes from an E. coli strain that overexpresses GalP reveal a single set of high affinity binding sites for [3H]forskolin with a Kd of 1.3-1.4 microM, probably forming a 1:1 complex, compared with a value of 7.5 microM for GLUT1. Sugar substrates of GalP and cytochalasin B displace forskolin from the protein. The nonhomologous sugar-H+ symporters for L-rhamnose (RhaT), L-fucose (FucP) and lactose (LacY) in E. coli are insensitive to forskolin. Forskolin and [125I]APS-forskolin, therefore, constitute novel probes for exploring the structure-activity relationship of the bacterial GalP protein. GalP will provide an excellent model for the human glucose transporters and for elucidating the molecular basis of subtle differences in substrate and inhibitor recognition by individual members of this widespread family of transport proteins."
https://openalex.org/W58638391,"A cell extract from human erythrocytes promoted the growth of a wide variety of cell types, namely human and mouse myeloid cells, human and mouse T cells, human B cells, human melanoma cells, mouse transformed fibroblast cells, mouse mastocytoma cells, human lung fibroblast cells, and mouse bone marrow fibroblast/stroma-like cells. The growth-promoting activity was acid- and heat-labile and sensitive to proteases, indicating the proteinaceous nature of the molecule. The activity was also lost upon exposure to 2-mercaptoethanol. The novel growth-promoting factor, termed basic growth factor because of its fundamental effect and a wide target cell spectrum, was purified by sequential anion-exchange, hydrophobic, gel filtration, hydroxylapatite, and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatographies. The purified factor has an apparent molecular mass of 53 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing and nonreducing conditions. The factor migrated at 270 kDa on native gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Therefore, the factor consists of a homopolymer of a single polypeptide chain. The purified factor promoted the growth of the same cell types as the cell extract, except for bone marrow cells."
