https://openalex.org/W3110278238,"Introduction Cancer care is significantly impacted by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Our objective was to evaluate the early effects of the pandemic on the emotional well-being of oncology providers across the United States and explore factors associated with anxiety and depression symptoms. Materials and methods A cross-sectional survey was administered to United States cancer-care physicians recruited over a two-week period (3/27/2020–4/10/2020) using snowball-convenience sampling through social media. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4). Results Of 486 participants, 374 (77.0%) completed the PHQ-4: median age was 43 years; 63.2% female; all oncologic specialties were represented. The rates of anxiety and depression symptoms were 62.0% and 23.5%, respectively. Demographic factors associated with anxiety included female sex, younger age, and less time in clinical practice. Perception of inadequate personal protective equipment (68.6% vs. 57.4%, p = 0.03) and practicing in a state with more COVID-19 cases (65.8% vs. 51.1%, p = 0.01) were associated with anxiety symptoms. Factors significantly associated with both anxiety and depression included the degree to which COVID-19 has interfered with the ability to provide treatment to cancer patients and concern that patients will not receive the level of care needed for non-COVID-19 illness (all p-values &lt;0.01). Conclusion The perceived degree of interference with clinical practice along with personal concerns about COVID-19 were significantly associated with both anxiety and depression among oncology physicians in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings highlight factors associated with and sources of psychological distress to be addressed to protect the well-being of oncology physicians."
https://openalex.org/W3106719120,"Burnout as a concept indicative of a work-related state of mental exhaustion is recognized around the globe. Numerous studies showed that burnout has negative consequences for both individuals and organizations but also for society at large, especially in welfare states where sickness absence and work incapacitation are covered by social funds. This underlines the importance of a valid and reliable tool that can be used to assess employee burnout levels. Although the Maslach Burnout Inventory is by far the most frequently used questionnaire for assessing burnout, it is associated with several shortcomings and has been criticized on theoretical as well as empirical grounds. Thus, there is a need for an alternative questionnaire with a strong conceptual basis and proper psychometric qualities. This challenge has been taken up by introducing the Burnout Assessment Tool (BAT), according to which burnout is conceived as a work-related state of exhaustion among employees, characterized by extreme tiredness, reduced ability to regulate cognitive and emotional processes, and mental distancing. Given that the BAT is a new measure of burnout, its psychometric properties need to be evaluated. This paper focuses on an evaluation of the internal construct validity of the BAT using Rasch analysis in two random samples (n = 800, each) drawn from larger representative samples of the working population of the Netherlands and Flanders (Belgium). The BAT has sound psychometric properties and fulfils the measurement criteria according to the Rasch model. The BAT score reflects the scoring structure indicated by the developers of the scale and the BAT’s four subscales can be summarized into a single burnout score. The BAT score also works invariantly for women and men, younger and older respondents, and across both countries. Hence, the BAT can be used in organizations for screening and identifying employees who are at risk of burnout."
https://openalex.org/W3109303908,"The escalating rate at which coral communities are declining globally requires urgent intervention and new approaches to reef management to reduce and halt further coral loss. For reef systems with limited natural larval supply, the introduction of large numbers of competent coral larvae directly to natural reef substrata provides a potentially useful approach to replenish adult coral populations. While few experiments have tested this approach, only one experiment has demonstrated its long-term success to date. Given the differences in life-history traits among corals, and different sensitivities of larvae to abiotic and biotic factors, coupled with the dynamic nature of post-settlement survivorship and recruitment processes, trials of the larval enhancement technique with larvae of different coral species are needed to test the broader applicability and viability of this approach. Accordingly, in this paper we examine the applicability of the larval enhancement technique to restore a population of Acropora loripes in the Bolinao-Anda Reef Complex, Pangasinan, northwestern Philippines. Larvae were cultured ex situ following spawning of collected A . loripes colonies in June 2014. Competent larvae were transported to degraded reef areas and approximately 300,000 larvae were introduced in each of three 6 × 4 m plots directly on the reef. Fine mesh enclosures retained the larvae inside each treatment plot for five days. Three adjacent 6 × 4 m plots that served as controls were also covered with mesh enclosures, but no larvae were introduced. Each plot contained ten 10 × 10 cm conditioned settlement tiles cut from dead tabulate Acropora that were used to quantify initial larval settlement. After allowing larval settlement for five days, mean settlement on tiles from the larval enhancement plots that were monitored under stereomicroscopes was significantly higher (27.8 ± 6.7 spat per tile) than in control plots, in which not a single recruit was recorded. Post-settlement survivorship and growth of spat and coral recruits on tiles and reef substrata inside the experimental plots were monitored periodically for 35 months. After 35 months, the mean size of each of the remaining 47 A . loripes coral colonies surviving on the reef substrata was 438.1 ± 5.4 cm 3 , with a mean diameter of 7.9 ± 0.6 cm. The average production cost for each of the surviving A . loripes colonies at 35 months was USD 35.20. These colonies are expected to spawn and contribute to the natural larval pool when they become reproductively mature, thereby enhancing natural coral recovery in the area. This study demonstrates that mass coral larval enhancement can be successfully used for restoring populations of coral species with different life-history traits, and the techniques can rapidly increase larval recruitment rates on degraded reef areas, hence catalysing the regeneration of declining coral populations."
https://openalex.org/W3108020098,"The ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor is one of the most destructive pests of the honey bee ( Apis mellifera ) and the primary biotic cause of colony collapse in many regions of the world. These mites inflict physical injury on their honey bee hosts from feeding on host hemolymph and fat body cells/cellular components, and serve as the vector for deadly honey bee viruses, including Deformed wing virus (DWV) and the related Varroa destructor virus-1 (VDV-1) ( i . e ., DWV-like viruses). Studies focused on elucidating the dynamics of Varroa -mediated vectoring and transmission of DWV-like viruses may be confounded by viruses present in ingested host tissues or the mites themselves. Here we describe a system that includes an artificial diet free of insect tissue-derived components for maintaining Varroa mites for in vitro experimentation. Using this system, together with the novel engineered cDNA clone-derived genetically tagged VDV-1 and wild-type DWV, we demonstrated for the first time that Varroa mites provided an artificial diet supplemented with engineered viruses for 36 hours could acquire and transmit sufficient numbers of virus particles to establish an infection in virus-naïve hosts. While the in vitro system described herein provides for only up to five days of mite survival, precluding study of the long-term impacts of viruses on mite health, the system allows for extensive insights into the dynamics of Varroa -mediated vectoring and transmission of honey bee viruses."
https://openalex.org/W3108907509,"Background J wave syndromes (JWS), including Brugada (BrS) and early repolarization syndromes (ERS), are associated with increased risk for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Pharmacologic approaches to therapy are currently very limited. Here, we evaluate the effects of the natural flavone acacetin. Methods The effects of acacetin on action potential (AP) morphology and transient outward current (I to ) were first studied in isolated canine RV epicardial myocytes using whole-cell patch clamp techniques. Acacetin’s effects on transmembrane APs, unipolar electrograms and transmural ECGs were then studied in isolated coronary-perfused canine RV and LV wedge preparations as well as in whole-heart, Langendorff-perfused preparations from which we recorded a 12 lead ECG and unipolar electrograms. Using floating glass microelectrodes we also recorded transmembrane APs from the RVOT of the whole-heart model. The I to agonist NS5806, sodium channel blocker ajmaline, calcium channel blocker verapamil or hypothermia (32°C) were used to pharmacologically mimic the genetic defects and conditions associated with JWS, thus eliciting prominent J waves and provoking VT/VF. Results Acacetin (5–10 μM) reduced I to density, AP notch and J wave area and totally suppressed the electrocardiographic and arrhythmic manifestation of both BrS and ERS, regardless of the experimental model used. In wedge and whole-heart models of JWS, increasing I to with NS5806, decreasing I Na or I Ca (with ajmaline or verapamil) or hypothermia all resulted in accentuation of epicardial AP notch and ECG J waves, resulting in characteristic BrS and ERS phenotypes. Phase 2-reentrant extrasystoles originating from the RVOT triggered VT/VF. The J waves in leads V1 and V2 were never associated with a delay of RVOT activation and always coincided with the appearance of the AP notch recorded from RVOT epicardium. All repolarization defects giving rise to VT/VF in the BrS and ERS models were reversed by acacetin, resulting in total suppression of VT/VF. Conclusions We present experimental models of BrS and ERS capable of recapitulating all of the ECG and arrhythmic manifestations of the JWS. Our findings provide definitive support for the repolarization but not the depolarization hypothesis proposed to underlie BrS and point to acacetin as a promising new pharmacologic treatment for JWS."
https://openalex.org/W3110417286,"Purpose Cisplatin resistance is still a serious problem in the clinic. However, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In our study, we investigated cisplatin resistance by using the cisplatin-resistant cell line HCT116R. Methods The HCT116 cell line, a colon cancer cell line, was purchased. Cell viability was determined using CCK-8 Assay Kit. The gene expression levels of MIR4435-2HG, Nrf2, and HO-1, and caspase activity were determined using qRT-PCR and Caspase 3 Assay Kit, respectively. Results In this study, we found that the levels of the lncRNA MIR4435-2HG were dramatically increased in the cisplatin-resistant cell line HCT116R. Knockdown of MIR4435-2HG in HCT116R cells significantly restored the sensitivity to cisplatin, inhibited cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis. Furthermore, Nrf2 and HO-1 mRNA levels, as critical molecules in the oxidative stress pathway, were inhibited by siRNAs targeting MIR4435-2HG, suggesting that MIR4435-2HG-mediated cisplatin resistance occurs through the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. Conclusion Our findings demonstrate that the lncRNA MIR4435-2HG is a main factor driving the cisplatin resistance of HCT116 cells."
https://openalex.org/W3108585924,"Antigen cross presentation, whereby exogenous antigens are presented by MHC class I molecules to CD8+ T cells, is essential for generating adaptive immunity to pathogens and tumor cells. Following endocytosis, it is widely understood that protein antigens must be transferred from endosomes to the cytosol where they are subject to ubiquitination and proteasome degradation prior to being translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), or possibly endosomes, via the TAP1/TAP2 complex. Revealing how antigens egress from endocytic organelles (endosome-to-cytosol transfer, ECT), however, has proved vexing. Here, we used two independent screens to identify the hydrogen peroxide-transporting channel aquaporin-3 (AQP3) as a regulator of ECT. AQP3 overexpression increased ECT, whereas AQP3 knockout or knockdown decreased ECT. Mechanistically, AQP3 appears to be important for hydrogen peroxide entry into the endosomal lumen where it affects lipid peroxidation and subsequent antigen release. AQP3-mediated regulation of ECT was functionally significant, as AQP3 modulation had a direct impact on the efficiency of antigen cross presentation in vitro. Finally, AQP3-/- mice exhibited a reduced ability to mount an anti-viral response and cross present exogenous extended peptide. Together, these results indicate that the AQP3-mediated transport of hydrogen peroxide can regulate endosomal lipid peroxidation and suggest that compromised membrane integrity and coordinated release of endosomal cargo is a likely mechanism for ECT."
https://openalex.org/W3106929859,"Background Clinical factors may influence endometrial cancer survival outcomes. We examined the prognostic significance of age, body mass index (BMI), and type 2 diabetes among molecular subgroups of endometrial cancer. Methods This was a single institution retrospective study of patients who underwent surgery for endometrial carcinoma between January 2007 and December 2012. Tumors were classified into four molecular subgroups by immunohistochemistry of mismatch repair (MMR) proteins and p53, and sequencing of polymerase-ϵ ( POLE ). Overall, cancer-related, and non-cancer-related mortality were estimated using univariable and multivariable survival analyses. Results Age &gt;65 years was associated with increased mortality rates in the whole cohort (n = 515) and in the “no specific molecular profile” (NSMP) (n = 218) and MMR deficient (MMR-D) (n = 191) subgroups during a median follow-up time of 81 months (range 1‒136). However, hazard ratios for cancer-related mortality were non-significant for NSMP and MMR-D. Diabetes was associated with increased overall and non-cancer-related mortality in the whole cohort and MMR-D subgroup. Overweight/obesity had no effect on outcomes in the whole cohort, but was associated with decreased overall and cancer-related mortality in the NSMP subgroup, and increased overall and non-cancer-related mortality in the MMR-D subgroup. Overweight/obesity effect on cancer-related mortality in the NSMP subgroup remained unchanged after controlling for confounders. High-risk uterine factors were more common, and estrogen and progesterone receptor expression less common in NSMP subtype cancers of normal-weight patients compared with overweight/obese patients. No clinical factors were associated with outcomes in p53 aberrant (n = 69) and POLE mutant (n = 37) subgroups. No cancer-related deaths occurred in the POLE mutant subgroup. Conclusions The prognostic effects of age, BMI, and type 2 diabetes do not appear to be uniform for the molecular subgroups of endometrial cancer. Our data support further evaluation of BMI combined with genomics-based risk-assessment."
https://openalex.org/W3108465278,"Several bacterial species belonging to the Bacillus cereus group are known to be causative agents of food poisoning and severe human diseases. Bacteriophages and their lytic enzymes called endolysins have been widely shown to provide for a supplemental or primary means of treating bacterial infections. In this work we present a new broad-host-range phage Izhevsk, which infects the members of the Bacillus cereus group. Transmission electron microscopy, genome sequencing and comparative analyses revealed that Izhevsk is a temperate phage with Siphoviridae morphology and belongs to the same genus as the previously described but taxonomically unclassified bacteriophages Tsamsa and Diildio. The Ply57 endolysin of Izhevsk phage has broad-spectrum activity against B . cereus sensu lato . The thermolability of Ply57 is higher than that of the PlyG of Wβ phage. This work contributes to our current understanding of phage biodiversity and may be useful for further development of efficient antimicrobials aimed at diagnosing and treating infectious diseases and food contaminations caused by the Bacillus cereus group of bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W3107654913,"Background Excessive alcohol intake has been associated with poor adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). The impact of alcohol on viral suppression is particularly important among groups at high risk of HIV transmission, such as female sex workers (FSWs). Few studies have directly evaluated the association between alcohol use and HIV viral load. We hypothesized that hazardous or harmful alcohol use is associated with detectable plasma viral load among HIV-positive FSWs. Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted among HIV-positive FSWs in Mombasa, Kenya. Hazardous or harmful alcohol use was assessed yearly and defined as an Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) score ≥7. Detectable viral load was assessed every six months and defined as ≥180 c/mL. Adherence measures were collected monthly and included late ART refill (&gt;48 hours) and self-reported adherence, using both a validated self-rating scale of ability to take medication and visual analog scale (VAS) of ART use in the last month. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate adjusted relative risks (aRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results This analysis included 366 participants followed monthly between October 2012 and March 2018. At baseline, AUDIT scores indicated hazardous alcohol use (AUDIT 7–15) in 14.3%, harmful alcohol use (AUDIT 16–19) in 1.4%, and alcohol dependency (AUDIT ≥20) in 1.4% of participants. After adjusting for potential confounders, a combined exposure including hazardous, harmful, and dependent alcohol use was not associated with detectable viral load (aRR 1.10, 95%CI 0.63–1.92) or late ART refill (aRR 1.13, 95%CI 0.82–1.56), but was associated with lower self-rated ability to take medication (aRR 2.38, 95%CI 1.42–3.99) and a lower rate of self-reported perfect ART adherence by VAS (aRR 2.62, 95%CI 1.84–3.71). Conclusions In this FSW cohort, while participants reporting hazardous, harmful, or dependent alcohol use were not more likely to have a detectable viral load, they were more likely to report lower ART adherence. These results suggest that interventions targeting alcohol use among this population of FSWs may not have a large impact on viral suppression."
https://openalex.org/W3107927059,"In coastal aquatic ecosystems, prokaryotic communities play an important role in regulating the cycling of nutrients and greenhouse gases. In the coastal zone, estuaries are complex and delicately balanced systems containing a multitude of specific ecological niches for resident microbes. Anthropogenic influences (i.e. urban, industrial and agricultural land uses) along the estuarine continuum can invoke physical and biochemical changes that impact these niches. In this study, we investigate the relative abundance of methanogenic archaea and other prokaryotic communities, distributed along a land use gradient in the subtropical Burnett River Estuary, situated within the Great Barrier Reef catchment, Australia. Microbiological assemblages were compared to physicochemical, nutrient and greenhouse gas distributions in both pore and surface water. Pore water samples from within the most urbanised site showed a high relative abundance of methanogenic Euryarchaeota (7.8% of all detected prokaryotes), which coincided with elevated methane concentrations in the water column, ranging from 0.51 to 0.68 μM at the urban and sewage treatment plant (STP) sites, respectively. These sites also featured elevated dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations (0.66 to 1.16 mM), potentially fuelling methanogenesis. At the upstream freshwater site, both methane and DOC concentrations were considerably higher (2.68 μM and 1.8 mM respectively) than at the estuarine sites (0.02 to 0.66 μM and 0.39 to 1.16 mM respectively) and corresponded to the highest relative abundance of methanotrophic bacteria. The proportion of sulfate reducing bacteria in the prokaryotic community was elevated within the urban and STP sites (relative abundances of 8.0%– 10.5%), consistent with electron acceptors with higher redox potentials (e.g. O 2 , NO 3 - ) being scarce. Overall, this study showed that ecological niches in anthropogenically altered environments appear to give an advantage to specialized prokaryotes invoking a potential change in the thermodynamic landscape of the ecosystem and in turn facilitating the generation of methane–a potent greenhouse gas."
https://openalex.org/W3107108481,"Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is characterized by abnormal maternal D-glucose metabolism and altered insulin signaling. Dysregulation of thyroid hormones (TH) tri-iodethyronine (T 3 ) and L-thyroxine (T 4 ) Hormones had been associated with GDM, but the physiopathological meaning of these alterations is still unclear. Maternal TH cross the placenta through TH Transporters and their Deiodinases metabolize them to regulate fetal TH levels. Currently, the metabolism of TH in placentas with GDM is unknown, and there are no other studies that evaluate the fetal TH from pregnancies with GDM. Therefore, we evaluated the levels of maternal TH during pregnancy, and fetal TH at delivery, and the expression and activity of placental deiodinases from GDM pregnancies. Pregnant women were followed through pregnancy until delivery. We collected blood samples during 10–14, 24–28, and 36–40 weeks of gestation for measure Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), Free T 4 (FT 4 ), Total T 4 (TT 4 ), and Total T 3 (TT 3 ) concentrations from Normal Glucose Tolerance (NGT) and GDM mothers. Moreover, we measure fetal TSH, FT 4 , TT 4 , and TT 3 in total blood cord at the delivery. Also, we measured the placental expression of Deiodinases by RT-PCR, western-blotting, and immunohistochemistry. The activity of Deiodinases was estimated quantified rT 3 and T 3 using T 4 as a substrate. Mothers with GDM showed higher levels of TT 3 during all pregnancy, and an increased in TSH during second and third trimester, while lower concentrations of neonatal TT 4 , FT 4 , and TT 3 ; and an increased TSH level in umbilical cord blood from GDM. Placentae from GDM mothers have a higher expression and activity of Deiodinase 3, but lower Deiodinase 2, than NGT mothers. In conclusion, GDM favors high levels of TT3 during all gestation in the mother, low levels in TT4, FT4 and TT3 at the delivery in neonates, and increases deiodinase 3, but reduce deiodinase 2 expression and activity in the placenta."
https://openalex.org/W3107686882,"Anthropogenic change has been associated with population growth, land use change, and changing economies. However, internal migration patterns and armed conflicts are also key drivers of anthropogenic and demographic processes. To better understand the processes associated with this change, we explore the spatial relationship between forced migration due to armed conflict and changing socioeconomic factors in Colombia, a country which has a recent history of 7 million internal migrants. In addition, we use remote sensing, Google Earth Engine, as well as spatial statistical analyses of demographic data in order to measure anthropogenic change between 1984 and 2013—a socio-politically important period in Colombia’s armed conflict. We also analyze spatiotemporal relationships between socioeconomic and anthropogenic changes, which are caused by forced migration. We found that forced migration is significantly and positively related to an increasing rural-urban type of migration which results from armed conflict. Results also show that it is negatively related to interregional displacement. Indeed, anthropogenic change pertaining to different regions have had different correlations with forced migration, and across different time periods. Findings are used to discuss how socioeconomic and political phenomena such as armed conflict can have complex effects on the dynamics of anthropogenic and ecological change as well as movement of humans in countries like Colombia."
https://openalex.org/W3107727741,"Given that all in-situ analytical techniques have a non-zero beam size, all measured profiles, resulting from diffusion or otherwise, will be artefactually elongated to some degree. Profiles where the total length over which the concentration changes approaches the resolution of the analytical technique likely suffer from serious convolution; the measured profiles may be considerably elongated relative to the true profile. Resolving this effect is non-trivial, except for some specific combinations of profile type and beam geometry. In this study, a versatile method for numerically deconvoluting diffusion profiles acquired using techniques with Gaussian, Lorentzian, (pseudo-)Voigt, circular/elliptical or square/rectangular interaction volumes, is presented. A MATLAB code, including a user-friendly interface (PACE-the Program for Assessing Convolution Effects in diffusion studies), is also provided, and applied to several experimental and natural profiles interpreted as resulting from diffusion, showing various degrees of convolution."
https://openalex.org/W3107797914,"Grassland biodiversity is vulnerable to land use change. How to best manage semi-natural grasslands for maintaining biodiversity is still unclear in many cases because land-use processes may depend on environmental conditions and the indirect effects of land-use on biodiversity mediated by altered abiotic and biotic factors are rarely considered. Here we evaluate the relative importance of the direct and indirect effects of grazing intensity on plant communities along an elevational gradient on a large topographic scale in the Eastern Carpathians in Ukraine. We sampled for two years 31 semi-natural grasslands exposed to cattle grazing. Within each grassland site we measured plant community properties such as the number of species, functional groups, and the proportion of species undesirable for grazing. In addition, we recorded cattle density (as a proxy for grazing intensity), soil properties (bare soil exposure, soil organic carbon, and soil pH) and densities of soil decomposers (earthworms and soil microorganisms). We used structural equation modelling to explore the direct and indirect effects of grazing intensity on plant communities along the elevation gradient. We found that cattle density decreased plant species and functional diversity but increased the proportion of undesirable species. Some of these effects were directly linked to grazing intensity (i.e., species richness), while others (i.e., functional diversity and proportion of undesirable species) were mediated via bare soil exposure. Although grazing intensity decreased with elevation, the effects of grazing on the plant community did not change along the elevation gradient. Generally, elevation had a strong positive direct effect on plant species richness as well as a negative indirect effect, mediated via altered soil acidity and decreased decomposer density. Our results indicate that plant diversity and composition are controlled by the complex interplay among grazing intensity and changing environmental conditions along an elevation gradient. Furthermore, we found lower soil pH, organic carbon and decomposer density with elevation, indicating that the effects of grazing on soil and related ecosystem functions and services in semi-natural grasslands may be more pronounced with elevation. This demonstrates that we need to account for environmental gradients when attempting to generalize effects of land-use intensity on biodiversity."
https://openalex.org/W3108633780,"People encounter intertemporal decisions every day and often engage in behaviors that are not good for their future. One factor that may explain these decisions is the perception of their distal future self. An emerging body of research suggests that individuals vary in how they perceive their future self and many perceive their future self as a different person. The present research aimed to (1) build on and extend Hershfield’s et al. (2011) review of the existing literature and advance the conceptualization of the relationship between the current and future self, (2) extend and develop measures of this relationship, and (3) examine whether and how this relationship predicts intrapsychic and achievement outcomes. The results of the literature review suggested that prior research mostly focused on one or two of the following components: (a) perceived relatedness between the current and future self in terms of similarity and connectedness, (b) vividness in imagining the future self, and (c) degree of positivity felt toward the future self. Additionally, differences in how researchers have labeled the overall construct lead us to propose future self-identification as a new label for the three-component construct. Our research built on existing measures to test the validity of a three-component model of future self-identification. Across three samples of first-year undergraduates, this research established the psychometric properties of the measure, and then examined the relationships between the components and four outcome domains of interest: (1) psychological well-being (self-esteem, hope), (2) imagination of the future (visual imagery of future events, perceived temporal distance), (3) self-control, and (4) academic performance. We demonstrated that the three components of future self-identification were correlated but independent factors. Additionally, the three components differed in their unique relationships with the outcome domains, demonstrating the utility of measuring all three components of future self-identification when seeking to predict important psychological and behavioral outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3110406679,"Structural brain alterations have been repeatedly reported in schizophrenia; however, the pathophysiology of its alterations remains unclear. Multivariate pattern recognition analysis such as support vector machines can classify patients and healthy controls by detecting subtle and spatially distributed patterns of structural alterations. We aimed to use a support vector machine to distinguish patients with schizophrenia from control participants on the basis of structural magnetic resonance imaging data and delineate the patterns of structural alterations that significantly contributed to the classification performance. We used independent datasets from different sites with different magnetic resonance imaging scanners, protocols and clinical characteristics of the patient group to achieve a more accurate estimate of the classification performance of support vector machines. We developed a support vector machine classifier using the dataset from one site (101 participants) and evaluated the performance of the trained support vector machine using a dataset from the other site (97 participants) and vice versa. We assessed the performance of the trained support vector machines in each support vector machine classifier. Both support vector machine classifiers attained a classification accuracy of &gt;70% with two independent datasets indicating a consistently high performance of support vector machines even when used to classify data from different sites, scanners and different acquisition protocols. The regions contributing to the classification accuracy included the bilateral medial frontal cortex, superior temporal cortex, insula, occipital cortex, cerebellum, and thalamus, which have been reported to be related to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. These results indicated that the support vector machine could detect subtle structural brain alterations and might aid our understanding of the pathophysiology of these changes in schizophrenia, which could be one of the diagnostic findings of schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W3106758827,"Background Three-dimensional (3D) scanning is an established method of breast volume estimation. However, this method can never be entirely precise, since the thoracic wall cannot be imaged by the surface scanner. Current methods rely on interpolation of the posterior breast border from the surrounding thoracic wall. Here, we present a novel method to calculate the posterior border and increase the accuracy of the measurement. Methods Using principal component analysis, computed tomography images were used to build a statistical shape model (SSM) of the thoracic wall. The model was fitted to 3D images and the missing thoracic wall curvature interpolated (indirect volumetry). The calculations were evaluated by ordinary least squares regression between the preoperative and postoperative volume differences and the resection weights in breast reduction surgery (N = 36). Also, an SSM of the breast was developed, allowing direct volumetry. Magnetic-resonance images (MRI) and 3D scans were acquired from 5 patients in order to validate the direct 3D volumetry. Results Volumetry based on a SSM exhibited a higher determination coefficient (R 2 = 0,737) than the interpolation method (R 2 = 0,404). The methods were not equivalent (p = 0.75), suggesting that the methods significantly differ. There was no influence of BMI on the correlation in either method. The MRI volumetry had a strong correlation with the 3D volumetry (R 2 = 0,978). Conclusion The SSM-based method of posterior breast border calculation is reliable and superior to the currently used method of interpolation. It should serve as a basis of software applications aiming at calculation of breast volume from 3D surface scanning data."
https://openalex.org/W3108480198,"Natural α-tocopherol (α-TCP), but not tocotrienol, is preferentially retained in the human body. α-Tocopherol transfer protein (α-TTP) is responsible for binding α-TCP for cellular uptake and has high affinity and specificity for α-TCP but not α-tocotrienol. The purpose of this study was to examine the modification of α-TTP together with other related vitamin E-binding genes (i.e., TTPA , SEC14L2 , and PI-TPNA ) in regulating vitamin E uptake in neuronal cells at rest and under oxidative stress. Oxidative stress was induced with H 2 O 2 for an hour which was followed by supplementation with different ratios of α-TCP and tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF) for four hours. The cellular levels of vitamin E were quantified to determine bioavailability at cellular levels. The expression levels of TTPA , SEC14L2 , and PI-TPNA genes in 0% α-TCP were found to be positively correlated with the levels of vitamin E in resting neuronal cells. In addition, the regulation of all the above-mentioned genes affect the distribution of vitamin E in the neuronal cells. It was observed that, increased levels of α-TCP secretion occur under oxidative stress. Thus, our results showed that in conclusion vitamin E-binding proteins may be modified in the absence of α-TCP to produce tocotrienols (TCT), as a source of vitamin E. The current study suggests that the expression levels of vitamin E transport proteins may influence the cellular concentrations of vitamin E levels in the neuronal cells."
https://openalex.org/W3108960400,"Managing water (e.g., catchments) to increase the abundance and distribution of game is popular in arid regions, especially throughout the southwest United States, where biologists often manage water year-round for desert bighorn sheep ( Ovis canadensis nelsoni ). Bighorn may visit water when predators (e.g., mountain lions [ Puma concolor ], coyotes [ Canis latrans ]) do not, suggesting that differences in species ecology or their surface water requirements influence visit timing. Alternatively, visits by desert bighorn sheep and predators may align. The former outcome identifies opportunities to improve water management by providing water when desert bighorn sheep visit most, which hypothetically may reduce predator presence, range expansion and predation, thereby supporting objectives to increase sheep abundances. Since advancing water management hinges on understanding the patterns of species visits, we identified when these three species and mule deer ( Odocoileus hemionus ) visited managed waters in three North American deserts (Chihuahuan, Sonoran, Mojave). We unraveled the ecological basis describing why visits occurred by associating species visits with four weather variables using multi-site, multi-species models within a Bayesian hierarchical framework (3.4 million images; 105 locations; 7/2009-12/2016). Desert bighorn sheep concentrated visits to water within 4–5 contiguous months. Mountain lions visited water essentially year-round within all deserts. Higher maximum temperature influenced visits to water, especially for desert bighorn sheep. Less long-term precipitation (prior 6-week total) raised visits for all species, and influenced mountain lion visits 3–20 times more than mule deer and 3–37 times more than sheep visits. Visits to water by prey were inconsistent predictors of visits to water by mountain lions. Our results suggest improvements to water management by aligning water provision with the patterns and ecological explanations of desert bighorn sheep visits. We exemplify a scientific approach to water management for enhancing stewardship of desert mammals, be it the southwest United States or arid regions elsewhere."
https://openalex.org/W3109636999,"Bryophytes (liverworts, mosses and hornworts) are one of the most diverse plant groups worldwide but one of the least studied in temperate forests from an ecological perspective. In comparison to vascular plants, bryophytes have a broader distribution and a longer altitudinal gradient, and their influence on the landscape is poorly understood. The objective was to evaluate environmental drivers that can influence bryophyte cover, richness, diversity, and nestedness in different forest canopy compositions in two typical landscapes across the natural distribution of bryophytes in Tierra del Fuego (Argentina). Three natural Nothofagus forest types (pure deciduous, pure evergreen, and mixed deciduous-evergreen) in two landscapes (coasts &lt; 100 m.a.s.l. and mountains &gt; 400 m.a.s.l.) were selected (N = 60 plots). In each plot, we established one transect (10 m length) to measure bryophyte cover (point-intercept method). Data were evaluated using generalized linear mixed models and multivariate analyses. The studied environmental drivers were mainly explained by the microclimate, with higher effective annual precipitation and relative air humidity in the coastal forests and higher soil moisture in the mountain forests. Greater liverwort richness was found in evergreen forests at the mountain (9 species) than at the coastal, while mosses showed higher richness in mixed deciduous-evergreen forests at the coastal (11 species) than at the mountain. However, the expected richness according to the rarefaction/extrapolation curves suggested that it is possible to record additional species, except for liverworts in pure deciduous forests on the coasts. Similarities and differences among the studied forest types and among plots of the same forest type and landscape were detected. These differences in the studied indexes (similarity that varied between 0 and 1) ranged from 0.09–0.48 for liverworts and 0.05–0.65 for mosses. Moreover, these results indicated that pure evergreen and mixed deciduous-evergreen forests presented higher moss cover (10.7% and 10.0%, respectively), mainly in the mountains than on the coast. These outputs highlight the need to explore differences at greater altitudinal ranges to achieve sustainability objectives conservation planning for bryophytes in southernmost forests."
https://openalex.org/W3109762036,"The negative air ion (NAI) concentration is an essential indicator of air quality and atmospheric pollution. The NAI concentration can be used to monitor air quality on a regional scale and is commonly determined using field measurements. However, obtaining these measurements is time-consuming. In this paper, the relationship between remotely sensed surface parameters (such as land surface temperature, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and leaf area index) obtained from MODIS data products and the measured NAI concentration using a stepwise regression method was analyzed to estimate the spatial distribution of the NAI concentration and verify the precision. The results indicated that the NAI concentration had a negative correlation with temperature, leaf area index (LAI), and gross primary production while it exhibited a positive correlation with the NDVI. The relationship between land surface temperature and the NAI concentration in the Daxing’anling region is expressed by the regression equation of y = -35.51x 1 + 11206.813 (R 2 = 0.6123). Additionally, the NAI concentration in northwest regions with high forest coverage was higher than that in southeast regions with low forest coverage, suggesting that forests influence the air quality and reduce the impact of environmental pollution. The proposed inversion model is suitable for evaluating the air quality in Daxing’anling and provides a reference for air quality evaluation in other areas. In the future, we will expand the quantity and distribution range of sampling points, conduct continuous observations of NAI concentrations and environmental parameters in the research areas with different land-use types, and further improve the accuracy of inversion results to analyze the spatiotemporal dynamic changes in NAI concentration and explore the possibility of expanding the application areas of NAI monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W3107336567,"Background In South Africa, large increases in early adult mortality during the 1990s and early 2000s have reversed since public HIV treatment rollout in 2004. In a rural population in KwaZulu-Natal, we investigate trends in parental mortality and orphanhood from 2000–2014. Methods Using longitudinal demographic surveillance data for a population of approximately 90,000, we calculated annual incidence and prevalence of maternal, paternal and double orphanhood in children and adolescents (&lt;20 years) and, overall and cause-specific mortality of parents by age. Results The proportion of children and adolescents (&lt;20 years) for whom one or both parents had died rose from 26% in 2000 to peak at 36% in 2010, followed by a decline to 32% in 2014. The burden of orphanhood remains high especially in the oldest age group: in 2014, 53% of adolescents 15–19 years had experienced the death of one or both parents. In all age groups and years, paternal orphan prevalence was three-five times higher than maternal orphan prevalence. Maternal and paternal orphan incidence peaked in 2005 at 17 and 27 per 1,000 person years respectively (&lt;20 years) before declining by half through 2014. The leading cause of parental death throughout the period, HIV/AIDS and TB cause-specific mortality rates declined substantially in mothers and fathers from 2007 and 2009 respectively. Conclusions The survival of parents with children and adolescents &lt;20 years has improved in tandem with earlier initiation and higher coverage of HIV treatment. However, comparatively high levels of parental deaths persist in this rural population in KwaZulu-Natal, particularly among fathers. Community-level surveillance to estimate levels of orphanhood remains important for monitoring and evaluation of targeted state welfare support for orphans and their guardians."
https://openalex.org/W3107933186,"Distributions of riparian species will likely shift due to climate change induced alterations in temperature and rainfall patterns, which alter stream habitat. Spatial forecasting of suitable habitat in projected climatic conditions will inform management interventions that support wildlife. Challenges in developing forecasts include the need to consider the large number of riparian species that might respond differently to changing conditions and the need to evaluate the many different characteristics of streamflow and stream temperature that drive species-specific habitat suitability. In particular, in dynamic environments like streams, the short-term temporal resolution of species occurrence and streamflow need to be considered to identify the types of conditions that support various species. To address these challenges, we cluster species based on habitat characteristics to select habitat representatives and we evaluate regional changes in habitat suitability using short-term, temporally explicit metrics that describe the streamflow and stream temperature regime. We use stream-specific environmental predictors rather than climatic variables. Unlike other studies, the stream-specific environmental predictors are generated from the time that species were observed in a particular reach, in addition to long term trends, to evaluate habitat preferences. With species occurrence data from local monitoring surveys and streamflow and stream temperature modeled from downscaled Coupled Model Intercomparison Project ‐ Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate projections, we predict change in habitat suitability at the end-of-century. The relative importance of hydrology and stream temperature varied by cluster. High altitudinal, cold water species’ distributions contracted, while lower elevation, warm water species distributions expanded. Modeling with short-term temporally explicit environmental metrics did produce different end-of-century projections than using long-term averages for some of the representative species. These findings can help wildlife managers prioritize conservation efforts, manage streamflow, initiate monitoring of species in vulnerable clusters, and address stressors, such as passage barriers, in areas projected to be suitable in future climate conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3109524385,This article introduces Interdisciplinary Research Maps as a novel visualization technique to assist with interdisciplinary research analytics and to map common (and distinct) topics across publications from different disciplines. We detail the method for this technique which is based on entity linking and illustrate its application to a sample of articles sourced from the top business/management and environmental sciences journals. Both fields have separately been criticized for a lack of interdisciplinary research to co-create insights for tackling pressing environmental issues such as climate change. Our mapping approach provides a starting point for exploring similarities and differences in research topics across these fields. The mapping technique introduced here has broader applicability to facilitate the creation and exchange of knowledge across fields. We discuss avenues for visualization techniques to bridge the different fields by focusing on identifying common concepts to provide a basis for future analysis.
https://openalex.org/W3109967202,"Background Non-adherence to anti-retroviral therapy (ART) is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality among people living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (PLHIV). Community-based ART delivery model offers a decentralized and patient-centered approach to care for PLHIV, with the advantage of improved adherence to ART hence good treatment outcomes. However, data are limited on the magnitude of non-adherence to ART among PLHIV enrolled to the community-based ART model of care. In this study, we determined the frequency of non-adherence to ART and the associated factors among PLHIV enrolled to the community-based ART delivery model in a large health facility in rural northern Uganda. Methods This analytic cross-sectional study randomly sampled participants from 21 community drug distribution points at the AIDS Support Organization (TASO) in Gulu district, northern Uganda. Data were collected using a standardized and pre-tested questionnaire, entered in Epi-Data and analyzed in Stata at univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses levels. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors independently associated with non-adherence to ART, reported using odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence level (CI). The level of statistical significance was 5%. Results Of 381 participants, 25 (6.6%) were non-adherent to ART and this was significantly associated with alcohol consumption (Adjusted (aOR), 3.24; 95% CI, 1.24–8.34). Other factors namely being single/or never married (aOR, 1.97; 95% CI, 0.62–6.25), monthly income exceeding 27 dollars (aOR, 1.36; 95% CI, 0.52–3.55), being on ART for more than 5 years (aOR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.23–1.59), receipt of health education on ART side effects (aOR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.12–1.05), and disclosure of HIV status (aOR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.04–3.20) were not associated with non-adherence in this setting. Conclusion Non-adherence to ART was low among PLHIV enrolled to community-based ART delivery model but increases with alcohol consumption. Accordingly, psychosocial support programs should focus on alcohol consumption."
https://openalex.org/W3107537921,"The potential hazard to human health from exposure to heavy metals in surface soil was assessed using 66 soil samples collected from Ahvaz oil field. To this end, the contents of heavy metals were measured by the inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Mean levels of As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, V, and Zn were 5.9, 0.4, 7.1, 36.5, 41.2, 39.8, 67.4, 31.5, and 77.6 mg/kg, respectively. Contents of all studied heavy metals, with the exception of Co, Cr, and V, were several times higher than that of baselines. Correlation coefficients and principal component analysis (PCA) identified two main groups as sources of heavy metals in the surface soil of Ahvaz oil-field. Metals such as Co, Cr, and V were observed to originate from natural sources and As, Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn originated from anthropogenic sources such as petroleum leakage and the pollution caused by drilling mud from oil wells. Pb and Zn were of significantly high EF mean enrichment value, and Co, Cu, Cd, and As had high enrichment in surface soil. Pb, Cr, V, Zn, Co, Cu, Ni, and As had a low potential ecological risk (PER) whereas Cd had a moderate PER. The risk of carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic diseases was detected to be higher in children than in adults. The carcinogenic risk (Cr) calculation was more than 1 × 10 -6 for children and adults. Additionally, the CR of Cr for both children and adults indicated risk under control conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3108101264,"Objective To evaluate the availability, prices, and affordability of essential medicines in Zhejiang Province, China. Methods The survey was carried out in Zhejiang Province in 2018 following the methodology of the World Health Organization (WHO) and Health Action International (HAI). This method is an international standard method.Data on 50 medicines were collected from public health facilities and private pharmacies. Medication prices were compared with international reference prices to obtain a median price ratio. The affordability of medicines was measured based on the daily wage of the lowest-paid unskilled government worker. In private pharmacies, the mean availability of Originator Brands (OBs) and Lowest-priced Generics (LPGs) was 36.7% and 40.3%, respectively. Findings The effects of the mean availability of OBs and LPGs were seen in private pharmacies. Correspondingly, the average availability of OBs and LPGs was 41.8% and 35.1% in the public sector, respectively. In the public sector, the median price ratios (MPRs) were 5.21 for generics and 13.49 for OBs. In the private sector, the MPRs were 4.94 for generics and 14.75 for OBs. Treating common diseases with LPGs was generally affordable, while treatment with OBs was less affordable. Conclusions In Zhejiang Province, low availability was observed for medicines surveyed in the public and private sectors. Price differences between originator brands and generics in both sectors are apparent. OBs were more expensive than LPGs in both the public and private sectors. Low availability affects access to essential medicines. Policy measures should be taken to improve the availability of essential medicines."

Abnormal birth weight, classified into low birth weight and high birth weight, is often associated with adverse health outcomes and a leading risk for neonatal morbidity and mortality. The study used datasets from the birth recode file of 2013 and 2018 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS); a weighted sample of pooled 9,244 live births by 7,951 mothers within ten years (2008–2018) in urban Nigeria. The effects of individual, healthcare utilization and community-level variables on the two abnormal birth weight categories were explored with a multinomial logistic regression models using normal birth weight as a reference group. In urban Nigeria, the overall prevalence of ABW was 18.3%; high birth weight accounted for the majority (10.7%) of infants who were outside the normal birth weight range. Predictors of LBW were community (region), child characteristic (the type of birth) and household (wealth index) while that of HBW were community (regions), child characteristics (birth intervals and sex), maternal characteristic (education) and healthcare utilization (ANC registration). LBW was significantly more prevalent in the northern part while HBW was more common in the southern part of urban Nigeria. This pattern conforms to the expected north-south dichotomy in health indicators and outcomes. These differences can be linked to suggested variation in regional exposure to urbanization in Nigeria."
https://openalex.org/W3110439655,"Coenzyme Q (CoQ, ubiquinone) is an essential component of the electron transport system in aerobic organisms. Human type CoQ 10 , which has 10 units of isoprene in its quinone structure, is especially valuable as a food supplement. Therefore, studying the biosynthesis of CoQ 10 is important not only for increasing metabolic knowledge, but also for improving biotechnological production. Herein, we show that Schizosaccharomyces pombe utilizes p -aminobenzoate (PABA) in addition to p -hydroxybenzoate (PHB) as a precursor for CoQ 10 synthesis. We explored compounds that affect the synthesis of CoQ 10 and found benzoic acid (Bz) at &gt;5 μg/mL inhibited CoQ biosynthesis without accumulation of apparent CoQ intermediates. This inhibition was counteracted by incubation with a 10-fold lower amount of PABA or PHB. Overexpression of PHB-polyprenyl transferase encoded by ppt1 ( coq2 ) also overcame the inhibition of CoQ biosynthesis by Bz. Inhibition by Bz was efficient in S . pombe and Schizosaccharomyces japonicus , but less so in Saccharomyces cerevisiae , Aureobasidium pullulans , and Escherichia coli . Bz also inhibited a S . pombe ppt1 ( coq2 ) deletion strain expressing human COQ2 , and this strain also utilized PABA as a precursor of CoQ 10 . Thus, Bz is likely to inhibit prenylation reactions involving PHB or PABA catalyzed by Coq2."
https://openalex.org/W3107103550,"As the genomic profile across cancers varies from person to person, patient prognosis and treatment may differ based on the mutational signature of each tumour. Thus, it is critical to understand genomic drivers of cancer and identify potential mutational commonalities across tumors originating at diverse anatomical sites. Large-scale cancer genomics initiatives, such as TCGA, ICGC and GENIE have enabled the analysis of thousands of tumour genomes. Our goal was to identify new cancer-causing mutations that may be common across tumour sites using mutational and gene expression profiles. Genomic and transcriptomic data from breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers were aggregated and analysed using differential gene expression methods to identify the effect of specific mutations on the expression of multiple genes. Mutated genes associated with the most differentially expressed genes were considered to be novel candidates for driver mutations, and were validated through literature mining, pathway analysis and clinical data investigation. Our driver selection method successfully identified 116 probable novel cancer-causing genes, with 4 discovered in patients having no alterations in any known driver genes: MXRA5, OBSCN, RYR1, and TG. The candidate genes previously not officially classified as cancer-causing showed enrichment in cancer pathways and in cancer diseases. They also matched expectations pertaining to properties of cancer genes, for instance, showing larger gene and protein lengths, and having mutation patterns suggesting oncogenic or tumor suppressor properties. Our approach allows for the identification of novel putative driver genes that are common across cancer sites using an unbiased approach without any a priori knowledge on pathways or gene interactions and is therefore an agnostic approach to the identification of putative common driver genes acting at multiple cancer sites."

Alterations in sulfhydryl status, regulated by either reversible redox reactions or by permanent covalent capping, may be challenging to identify. To advance the detection of protein sulfhydryl groups, we describe the production of new Rabbit monoclonal antibodies that react with carbamidomethyl-cysteine (CAM-cys), a product of iodoacetamide (IAM) labeling of protein sulfhydryl residues. These antibodies bind to proteins labeled with IAM (but not N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) or acrylamide) and identify multiple protein bands when applied to Western blots of cell lysates treated with IAM. The monoclonal antibodies label a subset of CAM-cys modified peptide sequences and purified proteins (human von Willebrand Factor (gene:vWF), Jagged 1 (gene:JAG1), Laminin subunit alpha 2 (gene:LAMA2), Thrombospondin-2 (gene:TSP2), and Collagen IV (gene:COL4)) but do not recognize specific proteins such as Bovine serum albumin (gene:BSA) and human Thrombospondin-1 (gene:TSP1), Biglycan (gene:BGN) and Decorin (gene:DCN). Scanning mutants of the peptide sequence used to generate the CAM-cys antibodies elucidated residues required for context dependent reactivity. In addition to recognition of in vitro labeled proteins, the antibodies were used to identify selected sulfhydryl-containing proteins from living cells that were pulse labeled with IAM. Further development of novel CAM-cys monoclonal antibodies in conjunction with other biochemical tools may complement current methods for sulfhydryl detection within specific proteins. Moreover, CAM-cys reactive reagents may be useful when there is a need to label subpopulations of proteins."
https://openalex.org/W3107931923,"Plant grafting is a sequential wound healing process. However, whether wounding induces a different jasmonic acid (JA) response within half a day (12 h) after grafting or non-grafting remains unclear. Using the tomato hypocotyl grafting method, we show that grafting alleviates the asymmetrical accumulation of JA and jasmonic acid isoleucine conjugate (JA-Ile) in scion and rootstock caused by wounding, and from 2 h after tomato micrografting, grafting obviously restored the level of JA-Ile in the scion and rootstock. Meanwhile, five JA-related genes, SlLOX11 , SlAOS , SlCOI1 , SlLAPA and SlJA2L , are detected and show significant changes in transcriptional expression patterns within 12 h of grafting, from asymmetrical to symmetrical, when the expression of 30 JA- and defense-related genes were analyzed. The results indicated that grafting alleviates the asymmetrical JA and defense response between scion and rootstock of the tomato hypocotyl within 12 h as induced by wounding. Moreover, we demonstrate that in the very early hours after grafting, JA-related genes may be involved in a molecular mechanism that changes asymmetrical expression as induced by wounding between scion and rootstock, thereby promoting wound healing and grafting success."
https://openalex.org/W3109028678,"Protein-based drugs often require targeted drug delivery for optimal therapy. A successful strategy to increase the circulation time of the protein in the blood is to link the therapeutic protein with an albumin-binding domain. In this work, we characterized such a protein-based drug, GA-Z. Using asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation coupled with multi-angle light scattering (AF4-MALS) we investigated the GA-Z monomer-dimer equilibrium as well as the molar binding ratio of GA-Z to HSA. Using small angle X-ray scattering, we studied the structure of GA-Z as well as the complex between GA-Z and HSA. The results show that GA-Z is predominantly dimeric in solution at pH 7 and that it binds to monomeric as well as dimeric HSA. Furthermore, GA-Z binds to HSA both as a monomer and a dimer, and thus, it can be expected to stay bound also upon dilution following injection in the blood stream. The results from SAXS and binding studies indicate that the GA-Z dimer is formed between two target domains (Z-domains). The results also indicate that the binding of GA-Z to HSA does not affect the ratio between HSA dimers and monomers, and that no higher order oligomers of the complex are seen other than those containing dimers of GA-Z and dimers of HSA."

We performed ocular surface tests with impression cytology to assess the expression levels of mucin-related genes on the ocular surface in healthy eyes. In addition, we investigated alterations in mucin-related gene expression secondary to treatment with rebamipide ophthalmic suspension in patients with Sjögren’s syndrome-associated dry eyes (SS-DE). Thirty-three healthy individuals (control group) and 13 patients from our hospital with SS-DE were enrolled. Impression cytology was performed using Schirmer’s test paper for RNA sampling. The mRNA levels of SAM-pointed domain-containing ETS-like factor ( SPDEF ), mucin 5AC ( MUC5AC ), and mucin 16 ( MUC16 ) were determined using a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The ocular surface test was performed once for the control group, and at baseline as well as 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after treatment in the Sjögren’s syndrome-associated dry eyes group. mRNA levels of SPDEF , MUC5AC , and MUC16 were not significantly different between the control and SS-DE groups before rebamipide ophthalmic suspension treatment. SPDEF mRNA levels in control subjects were significantly correlated with levels of MUC5AC . Among SS-DE patients, SPDEF mRNA levels were significantly increased at 2, 4, and 8 weeks after treatment compared with baseline levels. MUC16 mRNA levels were significantly decreased from baseline levels at 4 and 8 weeks post-treatment.

In addition, the emergence of community support options via information and communication technologies such as Skype and Facetime, social media (e.g., Facebook), and telelactation providers are providing mothers with a new range of support options that can help bridge geographic barriers to traditional community support. However, telelactation services that use information and communication technologies to connect breastfeeding mothers to remotely located breastfeeding experts require reliable, affordable, high-quality broadband connections to facilitate interaction between mothers and their support resources. The purpose of this paper is to explore the complex spatial landscape of virtual and face-to-face breastfeeding support options for mothers in the state of Ohio (U.S.), identifying barriers to support. Using a range of spatial and network analytics, the results suggest that a divide is emerging. While urban areas in Ohio benefit from both a density of face-to-face breastfeeding support resources and robust broadband options for engaging in telelactation, many rural areas of the state are lacking access to both. Policy implications and several potential strategies for mitigating these inequities are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3106723221,"Following injury to the peripheral and central nervous systems, tissue levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 often increase, which is key for wound healing and scarring. However, active wound regions and scars appear to inhibit process outgrowth by regenerating neurons. We recently showed that corneal wound myofibroblasts block corneal nerve regeneration in vivo , and sensory neurite outgrowth in vitro in a manner that relies critically on TGF-β1. In turn, delayed, abnormal re-innervation contributes to long-term sensory dysfunctions of the ocular surface. Here, we exposed morphologically and biochemically-differentiated sensory neurons from the ND7/23 cell line to TGF-β1 to identify the intracellular signals regulating these anti-neuritogenic effects, contrasting them with those of Semaphorin(Sema)3A, a known inhibitor of neurite outgrowth. Neuronal morphology was quantified using phase-contrast imaging. Western blotting and specific inhibitors were then used to identify key molecular mediators. Differentiated ND7/23 cells expressed neuron-specific markers, including those involved in neurite extension and polarization. TGF-β1 increased phosphorylation of collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP2), a molecule that is key for neurite extension. We now show that both glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β and Smad3 modulate phosphorylation of CRMP2 after treatment with TGF-β1. GSK-3β appeared to exert a particularly strong effect, which could be explained by its ability to phosphorylate not only CRMP2, but also Smad3. In conclusion, TGF-β1’s inhibition of neurite outgrowth in sensory neurons appears to be regulated through a highly-conserved signaling pathway, which involves the GSK-3β/CRMP-2 loop via both canonical and non-canonical mechanisms. It is hoped that by defining the signaling pathways that control neurite outgrowth in wound environments, it will become possible to identify optimal molecular targets to promote re-innervation following injury."

It is estimated that more than 1 million people are infected by Leptospira each year, and the death toll is about 60,000. Some studies showed that delayed immune response was associated with severe leptospirosis, and TLR4 was very important in the control of leptospirosis. In this study, we aimed to explore the effect of the classical activator (LPS) of TLR4 on leptospirosis in susceptible and resistant hosts. The results showed that LPS pretreatment increased the survival rate of hamsters to 80%. And LPS pre-treatment also significantly reduced the leptospiral load and alleviated the pathological injury in organs of hamsters and mice. The result detected by ELISA in mice showed that the levels of TNF-α and IL-1β were increased in the LPS-treated group compared to the control group before infection. However, two days after infection, the level of cytokines in LPS group was down-regulated compared with that in control group. In addition, in vitro results showed that LPS pre-treatment enhanced the phagocytosis and bactericidal ability of macrophages on Leptospira . Collectively, our results indicated that the pre-activated immune response induced by LPS enhanced the ability of host against leptospirosis."
https://openalex.org/W3107238589,"Background There is ongoing debate about whether friends’ greater similarity in Body Mass Index (BMI) than non-friends is due to friend selection, shared environments, or peer influence. Methods First-year college students (n = 104) from a southwestern U.S. university were randomly assigned roommates during the university’s housing process, effectively removing friend selection effects. Participant BMI was measured up to four times (T1-T4) across 2015–2016. The influence of roommate baseline BMI (T1) on change in participant BMI over time (T2-T4) was analyzed using a linear mixed effects model adjusted for individual socio-demographics, linear time trends, baseline BMI, and physical clustering of students. A sensitivity analysis examining floormates was also conducted. Results Consistent with roommate influence, participants randomized to roommates with a higher BMI gained more weight between times T2 and T4 (β = 0.06; 95% CI = 0.02, 0.10). No shared environment effects (shared campus or floor) were found. Conclusions Randomly assigned roommates influenced each other's weight trajectories. This clarifies that BMI convergence can occur outside of friend selection or shared environments mechanisms."

The purpose of this ancillary study is to (i) describe the caregivers’ perceptions of addictions and their management concurrently with cancer treatment, (ii) explore the role that Motivational Interviewing techniques can play. Methods 15 individual semi-structured interviews of caregivers were performed, using the Theoretical Domains Framework for the interview guide. Qualitative data were analyzed inductively, in a thematic analysis. The COREQ guided the reporting of this qualitative study. Results Views on addictions influence the way caregivers manage patients suffering from unresolved issues of addiction. Care is mainly focused on the pathology (cancer-centered) and strictly curative. When practiced, Motivational Interviewing is patient-centered, fostering the patient’s empowerment on the cancer care pathway. Conclusions The dissemination of Motivational Interviewing techniques in current practices in oncology, both in terms of doctors and nursing teams, would enable improvement to the management of addictions on the cancer care pathway, by deploying a patient-centered approach. This new paradigm of care would support the empowerment of patients enrolled in the cancer care pathway and promote better communication between caregivers and patients. Hence, a paradigm shift is essential. Motivational Interviewing techniques could provide a caring approach that promotes communication between the patient and the caregiver and also supports the former’s empowerment. This research suggests the need to adapt the cancer care pathway in order to integrate the necessary care for patients who concomitantly suffer from unresolved addictive disorders.

https://openalex.org/W3108933068,"Background Lead is a common environmental hazard because of its past use as an additive to gasoline and household paint. Some evidence suggests that children with histories of child abuse and neglect are at elevated risk for residence in communities and households with less desirable characteristics and high levels of exposure to environmental hazards and toxins. Objectives To understand whether childhood maltreatment leads to higher levels of household dust lead and blood lead in adulthood and the extent to which characteristics of a person’s physical environment or individual level socio-economic status (SES) (based on unemployment, poverty, and receipt of public assistance) contribute to understanding the relationship. Methods A large prospective cohort design study in which abused and neglected children (ages 0–11) were matched with non-maltreated children and assessed in adulthood. Objective and subjective neighborhood characteristics were assessed at approximate age 40 and household dust lead (cleaned and less often cleaned) and blood lead levels were measured at age 41. Blood was collected through venipuncture by a registered nurse as part of a medical status exam. Results Childhood maltreatment predicted higher levels of dust lead in less often cleaned household places, residence in worse neighborhoods defined by objective (census tract data) and subjective (reports of physical disorder and lack of social cohesion and control), and higher levels of poverty, receiving public assistance, and unemployment. Only objective neighborhood characteristics mediated the relationship between childhood maltreatment and dust lead level in adulthood. There were also significant paths from objective neighborhood disadvantage and individual level SES to higher levels of blood lead. Discussion Thirty years after their childhood experiences, individuals with documented histories of childhood maltreatment are at higher risk for living in environments as adults with elevated lead levels that may impact other aspects of their lives and compromise their health."
https://openalex.org/W3109210476,"By considering the role of site-level factors and dispersal, metacommunity concepts have advanced our understanding of the processes that structure ecological communities. In dendritic systems, like streams and rivers, these processes may be impacted by network connectivity and unidirectional current. Streams and rivers are central to the dispersal of many pathogens, including parasites with complex, multi-host life cycles. Patterns in parasite distribution and diversity are often driven by host dispersal. We conducted two studies at different spatial scales (within and across stream networks) to investigate the importance of local and regional processes that structure trematode (parasitic flatworms) communities in streams. First, we examined trematode communities in first-intermediate host snails ( Elimia proxima ) in a survey of Appalachian headwater streams within the Upper New River Basin to assess regional turnover in community structure. We analyzed trematode communities based on both morphotype (visual identification) and haplotype (molecular identification), as cryptic diversity in larval trematodes could mask important community-level variation. Second, we examined communities at multiple sites (headwaters and main stem) within a stream network to assess potential roles of network position and downstream drift. Across stream networks, we found a broad scale spatial pattern in morphotype- and haplotype-defined communities due to regional turnover in the dominant parasite type. This pattern was correlated with elevation, but not with any other environmental factors. Additionally, we found evidence of multiple species within morphotypes, and greater genetic diversity in parasites with hosts limited to in-stream dispersal. Within network parasite prevalence, for at least some parasite taxa, was related to several site-level factors (elevation, snail density and stream depth), and total prevalence decreased from headwaters to main stem. Variation in the distribution and diversity of parasites at the regional scale may reflect differences in the abilities of hosts to disperse across the landscape. Within a stream network, species-environment relationships may counter the effects of downstream dispersal on community structure."
https://openalex.org/W3107929125,"Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), caused by JC polyomavirus, is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that primarily affects oligodendrocytes. It can cause significant morbidity and mortality. An early diagnosis is of high relevance as timely immune reconstitution is essential. However, diagnosis can be challenging if virus detection via cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) PCR remains negative. Hence, identifying CSF biomarkers for this disease is of crucial importance. We applied a targeted metabolomic screen to CSF from 23 PML patients and eight normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) patients as controls. Out of 188 potentially detectable metabolites, 48 (13 amino acids, 4 biogenic amines, 1 acylcarnitine, 21 phosphatidylcholines, 8 sphingolipids, and the sum of hexoses) passed the quality screen and were included in the analyses. Even though there was a tendency towards lower concentrations in PML (mostly of phosphatidylcholines and sphingomyelins), none of the differences between PML and controls in individual metabolite concentrations reached statistical significance (lowest p = 0.104) and there were no potential diagnostic biomarkers (highest area under the ROC curve 0.68). Thus, CSF metabolite changes in PML are likely subtle and possibly larger group sizes and broader metabolite screens are needed to identify potential CSF metabolite biomarkers for PML."
https://openalex.org/W3109057778,"Purpose The 14-item Resilience Scale (RS14) is a tool designed to measure psychological resilience. It has been used effectively in diverse populations. However, its applicability is largely unknown for Sub-Saharan adolescent populations and completely unknown for orphaned and separated adolescents and youths (OSAY), a highly vulnerable population for whom resilience may be critical. This study assesses the RS14’s psychometric properties for OSAY in Uasin Gishu County, Kenya. Methods Survey responses from a representative sample of 1016 OSAY (51.3% female) aged 10–25 (mean = 16; SD = 3.5) living in institutional and home-based environments in Uasin Gishu County were analyzed. The RS14’s psychometric properties were assessed by examining internal consistency reliability, confirmatory factor analyses, and convergent validity using correlations between resilience and each of social support and depression. Sub-analyses were conducted by age and sex. Results Resilience scores ranged from 14–98 (mean = 66; SD = 19) with no sex-based significant difference. Resilience was higher for those aged ≥18 (mean = 69; range = 14–98) versus age &lt;18 (mean = 65; range = 14–98). Internal consistency was good (Cronbach’s α = .90). Confirmatory factor analysis indicated a 1-factor solution, though the model fit was only moderate. Resilience was positively correlated with social support in all ages (.22; p &lt; .001) and negatively correlated with depression in individuals age &lt;18 (-.22; p &lt; .001). The relationship between resilience and depression in individuals age ≥18 was statistically significant only in females (-.17; p = .026). Conclusion This study demonstrates reasonable evidence that the RS14 is both valid and reliable for measuring psychological resilience in the population of OSAY in western Kenya."
https://openalex.org/W3110376374,"Notch signaling is essential for multicellular life, regulating core functions such as cellular identity, differentiation, and fate. These processes require highly sensitive systems to avoid going awry, and one such regulatory mechanism is through Notch intracellular domain dimerization. Select Notch target genes contain sequence-paired sites (SPS); motifs in which two Notch transcriptional activation complexes can bind and interact through Notch’s ankyrin domain, resulting in enhanced transcriptional activation. This mechanism has been mostly studied through Notch1, and to date, the abilities of the other Notch family members have been left unexplored. Through the utilization of minimalized, SPS-driven luciferase assays, we were able to test the functional capacity of Notch dimers. Here we show that the Notch 2 and 3 NICDs also exhibit dimerization-induced signaling, following the same stringent requirements as seen with Notch1. Furthermore, our data suggested that Notch4 may also exhibit dimerization-induced signaling, although the amino acids required for Notch4 NICD dimerization appear to be different than those required for Notch 1, 2, and 3 NICD dimerization. Interestingly, we identified a mechanical difference between canonical and cryptic SPSs, leading to differences in their dimerization-induced regulation. Finally, we profiled the Notch family members’ SPS gap distance preferences and found that they all prefer a 16-nucleotide gap, with little room for variation. In summary, this work highlights the potent and highly specific nature of Notch dimerization and refines the scope of this regulatory function."
https://openalex.org/W3109036477,"Background The presence of a radiopaque or digital anatomical side marker (ASM) is an important diagnostic feature on radiographs and should be a routine feature on every radiographic image. Despite its importance, research has indicated numerous instances where ASMs were absent which have the potential to lead to adverse events. To date, few studies have systematically examined the use of ASMs in clinical practice and explored medical imaging professionals’ perspectives on ASM use. This research aimed to address this knowledge gap. Methods This investigation was conducted in two stages. Stage 1 involved a retrospective clinical audit of 421 randomly selected radiographs within 12-months at a pediatric medical imaging department. The data were analyzed for overall presence and type of marker use. Stage 2 comprised of semi-structured interviews with 11 radiographers to garner their perspectives on ASM use, and barriers and enablers to their use in clinical practice. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and thematically analyzed. Results The overall presence of ASMs (radiopaque and digital) was observed on 99 per cent of radiographs. There was a noticeable shift towards the use of digital (78.8 per cent) compared to radiopaque ASMs (20.2 per cent), highlighting the growing trend towards using ASM in post-processing. A handful of images ( N = 4) did not include any ASMs. Semi-structured interviews revealed multifaceted barriers (time, infection precautions, and patient factors) and few enablers (professionalism, legal requirement) for ASM use. Conclusion This investigation, informed by quantitative and qualitative research paradigms, has shed new light on an important area of radiography practice. While missing ASMs were a small feature, there continue to remain opportunities where best practice standards can be improved. The increasing use of digital ASMs potentially highlights a shift in clinical practice standards."
https://openalex.org/W3109815568,"There is large interest in networked social science experiments for understanding human behavior at-scale. Significant effort is required to perform data analytics on experimental outputs and for computational modeling of custom experiments. Moreover, experiments and modeling are often performed in a cycle, enabling iterative experimental refinement and data modeling to uncover interesting insights and to generate/refute hypotheses about social behaviors. The current practice for social analysts is to develop tailor-made computer programs and analytical scripts for experiments and modeling. This often leads to inefficiencies and duplication of effort. In this work, we propose a pipeline framework to take a significant step towards overcoming these challenges. Our contribution is to describe the design and implementation of a software system to automate many of the steps involved in analyzing social science experimental data, building models to capture the behavior of human subjects, and providing data to test hypotheses. The proposed pipeline framework consists of formal models, formal algorithms, and theoretical models as the basis for the design and implementation. We propose a formal data model, such that if an experiment can be described in terms of this model, then our pipeline software can be used to analyze data efficiently. The merits of the proposed pipeline framework is elaborated by several case studies of networked social science experiments."
https://openalex.org/W3110545379,"Background Spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) is among the nonpharmacologic interventions that has been recommended in clinical guidelines for patients with low back pain, however, some patients appear to benefit substantially more from SMT than others. Several investigations have examined potential factors to modify patients’ responses prior to SMT application. The objective of this study was to determine if the baseline prediction of SMT responders can be improved through the use of a restricted, non-pragmatic methodology, established variables of responder status, and newly developed physical measures observed to change with SMT. Materials and methods We conducted a secondary analysis of a prior study that provided two applications of standardized SMT over a period of 1 week. After initial exploratory analysis, principal component analysis and optimal scaling analysis were used to reduce multicollinearity among predictors. A multiple logistic regression model was built using a forward Wald procedure to explore those baseline variables that could predict response status at 1-week reassessment. Results Two hundred and thirty-eight participants completed the 1-week reassessment (age 40.0± 11.8 years; 59.7% female). Response to treatment was predicted by a model containing the following 8 variables: height, gender, neck or upper back pain, pain frequency in the past 6 months, the STarT Back Tool, patients’ expectations about medication and strengthening exercises, and extension status. Our model had a sensitivity of 72.2% (95% CI, 58.1–83.1), specificity of 84.2% (95% CI, 78.0–89.0), a positive likelihood ratio of 4.6 (CI, 3.2–6.7), a negative likelihood ratio of 0.3 (CI, 0.2–0.5), and area under ROC curve, 0.79. Conclusion It is possible to predict response to treatment before application of SMT in low back pain patients. Our model may benefit both patients and clinicians by reducing the time needed to re-evaluate an initial trial of care."
https://openalex.org/W3108599388,"In recent years, sentinel lymph node excision and ultrastaging have been performed in endometrial carcinomas to obtain information about lymph node status, avoiding unnecessary complete pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy. The purpose of this retrospective study was to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the pathological features of endometrial carcinomas and their significance in association with sentinel lymph node involvement.Patients with endometrial carcinomas, preceded by sentinel lymph node mapping, were classified into Group-I and Group-II with negative and positive involvement, respectively. The pathological features, associated with sentinel lymph node involvement, were statistically analyzed, including determination of test performance parameters.Among 70 patients who had undergone hysterectomy and sentinel lymph node excision, 61 had carcinoma and 9 had atypical hyperplasia. There were 50 patients in Group-I and 10 in Group-II. In Group-II, the significant pathological features were: 1) lower uterine segment involvement (100%), 2) an average tumor size of ≥5 CM, 3) lymphovascular invasion (50%), 4) cervical stromal invasion (40%), and 5) depth of myometrial invasion of ≥50% (50%). The incidences of these pathological features were significantly less in Group-I. Statistical analyses singled out ""lower uterine segment involvement"" as the most important feature.We have identified five pathological features which are associated with sentinel lymph node involvement. Since lower uterine segment involvement has occurred in all cases of the Group-II cohort, we recommend FIGO and other organizations that determine staging rules should consider whether tumors that involve the lower uterine segment should be staged as higher than ""1a"", if the findings in this small series are confirmed by other studies. The results of this study may guide pathologists and oncologists in the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to management of endometrial carcinomas."
