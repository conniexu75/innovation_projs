This “Ca2+ receptor” (CaR) serves as the primary physiological regulator of parathyroid hormone secretion. Alterations in the CaR have been proposed to underlie the increases in Ca2+ set-point seen in primary hyperparathyroidism due to parathyroid adenoma. We have isolated human CaR cDNAs from an adenomatous parathyroid gland. The cloned receptor, expressed in Xenopus oocytes, responds to extracellular application of physiologically relevant concentrations of Ca2+ and other CaR agonists. The rank order of potency of CaR agonists displayed by the native receptor (Gd3+ > neomycin B > Ca2+ > Mg2+) is maintained by the expressed receptor. The nucleotide sequence of the human CaR cDNA predicts a protein of 1078 amino acids with high sequence similarity to a bovine CaR, and displays seven putative membrane-spanning regions common to G protein-coupled receptors. The deduced protein sequence shows potential sites for N-linked glycosylation and phosphorylation by protein kinase C and has a low level of sequence similarity to the metabotropic glutamate receptors. Comparison of the cDNA sequence to that of the normal human CaR gene showed no alteration in the coding region sequence of the CaR in this particular instance of parathyroid adenoma. Human cDNA clones with differing 5′-untranslated regions were isolated, suggesting alternative splicing of the parathyroid CaR mRNA. A rare variant cDNA clone representing a 10 amino acid insertion into the extracellular domain was also isolated. Northern blot analysis of normal and adenomatous parathyroid gland mRNA identified a predominant transcript of ∼5.4 kilobases, and less abundant transcripts of ∼10, 4.8 and 4.2 kilobases in RNA from the adenoma. While there is no evidence for alteration of the primary amino acid sequence of the CaR in this adenoma, modulation of CaR biosynthesis through alternative RNA processing may play a role in set-point alterations.

The secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH)1( 1The abbreviations used are: PTHparathyroid hormoneCaRcalcium receptorGPRG protein-coupled receptormGluRmetabotropic glutamate receptor1° HPTprimary hyperparathyroidismUTRuntranslated regionkbpkilobase pair(s)FHHfamilial hypocalciuric hypercalcemiabpbase pair(s)PBPperiplasmic amino acid-binding protein.) by the parathyroid gland is regulated by the circulating level of Ca2+, with elevation of the serum Ca2+ concentration leading to an inhibition of PTH secretion. Functional studies of parathyroid cells have suggested the presence of a cell surface, G protein-coupled “Ca2+ receptor” (CaR) capable of detecting physiological changes in the concentration of extracellular Ca2+ and modulating PTH secretion (1Nemeth E.F.

Increases in the concentration of extracellular Ca2+ lead to increased formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (3Brown E.M. Enyedi P. LeBoff M.S. Rotberg J. Preston J. Chen C.J. FEBS Lett. 1987; 218: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and diacylglycerol (4Kifor O. Brown E.M. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 2723-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and a rapid elevation in levels of cytosolic Ca2+ which results from both the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ and influx of extracellular Ca2+(1Nemeth E.F.

Sci. 1994; 10: 1-5Google Scholar). In addition, parathyroid cells exposed to high extracellular Ca2+ show an inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity, and this inhibition can be blocked by pretreatment with pertussis toxin (6Chen C.J. Barnett J.V. Congo D.A. Brown E.M. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that either a single CaR is capable of effecting both mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ and inhibition of adenylate cyclase, or that isoforms of the CaR, coupled to differing G protein-mediated signaling pathways, exist. Although Ca2+ is the endogenous ligand for the CaR, in vitro a variety of di-, tri-, and polyvalent cations (neomycin, spermine, protamine, La3+, Gd3+, Ba2+, Sr2+, Mg2+) have been shown to activate this receptor (7Nemeth E.F.

Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 3047-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Studies on cultured bovine parathyroid cells suggest that the CaR is a cell surface glycoprotein (9Fuleihan G.E.-H.

Alterations in parathyroid cell CaR function have been implicated in at least two different human disease states. In primary hyperparathyroidism (1o HPT), parathyroid cells show an elevated Ca2+“set-point” for PTH suppression (12Brown E.M. LeBoff M.S. Prog. Surg. 1986; 18: 13-22Crossref Google Scholar), possibly reflecting an alteration in CaR function. Recently, mutations in the CaR gene were identified in kindreds with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) (13Pollak M.R. Brown E.M. Chou Y-H.W. Hebert S.C. Marx S.J. Steinmann B. Levi T. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Cell. 1993; 75: 1297-1303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar), an inherited syndrome in which affected individuals display an elevated Ca2+ set-point (14Khosla S. Ebeling P.R. Firek A.F. Burritt M.M. Kao P.C. Heath III, H. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metabol. 1993; 76: 715-720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A CaR-specific agonist, NPS R-568, has been shown to reduce serum PTH levels in vivo(15Fox J. Hadfield S. Petty B.A. Nemeth E.F. J. Bone. Miner. Res. 1993; 8 (abstr.): S181Google Scholar), further demonstrating the role of the CaR in modulating PTH secretion. Altogether, there is compelling evidence that the parathyroid CaR serves a central role in maintaining bodily Ca2+ homeostasis. Cell types in addition to the parathyroid cell are responsive to changes in extracellular Ca2+, suggesting that the same or a related CaR may modulate the function of a variety of cells. Calcitonin secretion by thyroid C cells (16Fried R.M. Tashjian Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7669-7674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and renin secretion by juxtaglomerular cells (17Kurtz A. Penner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3423-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) are well documented examples in which hormone secretion is modulated by extracellular Ca2+. To facilitate the study of human CaR function in normal and disease states and aid in the identification of novel cell types expressing the CaR, we undertook the isolation of human CaR cDNA clones from an adenomatous parathyroid gland. A bovine parathyroid cell CaR cDNA was recently isolated by expression cloning in Xenopus oocytes (18Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M.A. Lytton J. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar). This clone encoded a novel receptor protein with limited sequence homology to the family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPRs). We have used this bovine clone to demonstrate the presence of CaR-related transcripts in a human adenomatous parathyroid gland removed from an individual diagnosed with primary hyperparathyroidism. Full-length CaR cDNA clones were isolated from a cDNA library prepared from this adenoma, the sequence of the CaR obtained from the adenomatous gland was compared to the sequence of the normal human CaR gene, and the function of the encoded CaR has been examined by expression in Xenopus oocytes. The human parathyroid adenoma CaR cDNA clones encode a CaR, coupled to the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+, with a pharmacological profile similar to that seen with normal parathyroid cells. Human tissue samples were frozen on dry ice and stored at −90° C. Total RNA was prepared by the guanidinium thiocyanate/acid phenol extraction procedure (19Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was obtained by oligo-(dT) cellulose affinity chromatography. RNA was size fractionated on 1.2% agarose/formaldehyde gels and transferred to nylon membranes. The 5.3-kbp cDNA insert of a bovine CaR cDNA clone (pBoPCaR1) was excised from the pSport vector by SalI + NotI digestion, gel-purified, and labeled by random-primed synthesis with [32P]dCTP (20Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (5190) Google Scholar) to a specific activity of >109 counts/min/μg. Nylon membranes were hybridized in a solution consisting of 5 × SSC (1 × SSC = 0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M sodium citrate, pH 7.2), 400 mM NaPO4, 5% SDS, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 μg/ml sonicated salmon testis DNA, and 35% formamide at 42°C, with BoPCaR1 insert probe at a concentration of 2 × 106 counts/min/ml. Following hybridization, blots were washed in 2 × SSC, 0.5% SDS at 50° (moderate stringency) or 0.1 × SSC, 65°C (high stringency). Human adenomatous parathyroid mRNA was used in cDNA synthesis (21Gubler U. Hoffman B.J. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 25: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (3077) Google Scholar) using Superscript (Life Technologies, Inc.) reverse transcriptase. cDNA was synthesized with a NotI/dT primer at the 3′ end and a EcoRI adaptor at the 5′ end. cDNA in the 3-6 kbp size range was gel-isolated and ligated into EcoRI/NotI digested λZap II cloning vector. In vitro packaged phage were plated (440,000 primary recombinants) and screened by standard plaque hybridization techniques (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), using full-length BoPCaR1 insert probe under the hybridization and moderate stringency wash conditions listed for Northern blot analysis. The same filters were stripped and hybridized with a 780-bp EcoRI fragment probe from the 5′ end of the bovine cDNA, to identify human clones with long inserts. Selected hybridizing plaques were taken through secondary and tertiary rounds of purification, and isolated phage clones were used for in vivo rescue of cDNA inserts in the pBluescript SK− plasmid vector (23Short J.M. Fernandez J.M. Sorge J.A. Huse W.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7583-7600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). Preliminary restriction mapping of cDNA inserts indicated that two classes of inserts were represented, sharing a common central region and differing at the ends. Two cDNA clones, with inserts of ∼4 and ∼5 kbp, were selected for sequencing. DNA sequencing was performed on double-stranded plasmid DNA using the chain termination method (24Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) with Sequenase enzyme (United States Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH). Much of the sequencing was done using ordered deletions across the cDNA inserts (25Henikoff S. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 28: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (2832) Google Scholar), with remaining regions sequenced using specific oligonucleotide primers. All regions were sequenced on both strands. Nucleotide sequences were analyzed with the MacVector (IBI-Kodak, Inc.) package of software, including the most recent release (June, 1994) of the NCBI sequence data bases. The pBluescript vector bearing the CaR insert was linearized by NotI digestion, and capped, sense-strand cRNA was synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase transcription (26Melton D.A. Krieg P.A. Rebagliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar). In vitro transcribed RNA was concentrated by ethanol precipitation, and the size and integrity of the RNA were assessed on denaturing agarose gels. CaR cRNA was injected into Xenopus oocytes (typically 12 ng/oocyte), and oocytes were maintained for 3-5 days prior to assay of CaR function. Two-electrode voltage clamp recording was used to monitor the endogenous Ca2+-dependent Cl− current in response to extracellular application of CaR agonists. Details of oocyte manipulations and electrophysiological procedures were as described previously (27Racke F.R. Hammerland L.G. Dubyak G.R. Nemeth E.F. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). An adenomatous parathyroid gland was removed from a 39-year-old male diagnosed with primary hyperparathyroidism. Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+ RNA prepared from the adenoma, utilizing the bovine CaR cDNA as hybridization probe, identified a prominent transcript of ∼5.4 kb and more faintly hybridizing bands at ∼10, 4.8, and 4.2 kb (Fig. 1). All of these hybridizing bands persisted after high stringency washes. Normal parathyroid gland mRNA was prepared from tissue obtained at autopsy from a 65-year-old female. Although the RNA prepared from this post-mortem tissue was somewhat degraded, Northern blot analysis identified a faint CaR transcript at 5.4 kb (Fig. 1), suggesting that this is the primary size of the human CaR transcript in both normal and adenomatous parathyroid glands. Xenopus oocytes expressing the human adenoma mRNA responded to extracellular application of CaR agonists with oscillatory inward Cl− currents, indicating that the adenoma RNA encoded a functional CaR (data not shown). The human adenoma mRNA was used to construct a cDNA library enriched for inserts in the 3-6 kbp size range. This library (440,000 clones) was screened at moderate stringency using the full-length bovine CaR cDNA as hybridization probe. Approximately 600 plaques (0.14%) in this size-selected library were hybridization-positive. Eighteen clones that hybridized with a probe derived from the 5′ end of the bovine CaR clone were plaque-purified and characterized by restriction mapping. Clones could be separated into two classes, with inserts in one class of ∼4 kbp and in the other ∼5 kbp. Restriction mapping showed both classes to share a similar central region, with differences at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the inserts. Clones representing the ∼4 kbp insert size (phPCaR-4.0) and the ∼5 kbp insert size (phPCaR-5.2) were completely sequenced. The sequence of the phPCaR-4.0 clone has a large open reading frame encoding a protein of 1078 amino acids (Fig. 2), with 93% identity to the CaR protein predicted by the bovine CaR cDNA. The sequence surrounding the initiation codon of this open reading frame is a good match to the Kozak consensus sequence for translational initiation (28Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the 5′ sequence preceding this start codon contains stop codons in all frames. Hydrophobicity analysis of the predicted human CaR protein shows a cluster of seven hydrophobic regions 20-25 amino acids in length, reminiscent of the seven membrane-spanning regions displayed by all known GPRs. By analogy with the general structure of the GPR superfamily, the human CaR can be proposed to consist of a very large amino-terminal extracellular domain (amino acids 1-612), a central membrane spanning region (amino acids 613-862), and a relatively long carboxyl-terminal intracellular domain (amino acids 863-1078). The extracellular domain contains 11 potential sites of N-linked glycosylation, 10 of which are conserved in the bovine CaR. The bovine CaR contains highly acidic regions in the NH2-terminal extracellular domain (amino acids 216-251 and 557-611) and in the second extracellular loop. These clusters of acidic residues have been proposed to serve as sites of low affinity interaction with cationic ligands (18Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M.A. Lytton J. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar). All of these acidic amino acids are conserved between the human and bovine CaR proteins. There are five potential sites for protein kinase C phosphorylation located in the intracellular loop regions and the COOH-terminal intracellular domain of the human CaR. Four of these sites are present in the bovine CaR. The human CaR has two potential sites for cAMP-dependent phosphorylation (Ser-899 and Ser-900). Neither of these protein kinase A phosphorylation sites is present in the bovine CaR. In general, there is a high level of sequence conservation between the bovine and human CaR proteins (Fig. 3). The only region displaying extensive sequence divergence is the COOH-terminal end of the intracellular domain. Of the 74 amino acid differences found between the two species, 43 are located in the region from amino acids 920 to 1078. The few other differences are distributed throughout the remainder of the protein, and many are conservative amino acid substitutions. The CaR shows limited, but significant homology to the metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). An alignment of human and bovine parathyroid CaRs to the rat mGluR1 protein is presented (Fig. 3). The proposed structure of the CaR, with large extracellular and intracellular domains and relatively short intracellular loops, is very similar to that proposed for the mGluRs, although overall the human CaR shows only 18-24% identity to the various rat mGluR proteins. Similarity between the CaR and mGluR sequences is maintained throughout the NH2-terminal extracellular and membrane-spanning domains, with little conservation seen in the COOH-terminal intracellular domain. A hydrophobic region in the extracellular domain (amino acids 137-160), as well as the first and third intracellular loops, show particularly strong conservation (46, 50, and 75% identities, respectively) between the human CaR and rat mGluR1. Within the extracellular and membrane-spanning domains, the relative positions of 20 cysteine residues are maintained between the mGluRs and both the human and bovine CaRs (Fig. 2, and 3), suggesting conservation of structural conformation. Searches of a protein data base identified a low level of sequence similarity between amino acids 150-430 of the CaR and amino acids 110-370 of mouse and rat N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunits (data not shown). Similarity between the corresponding region of rat mGluR1 and the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate/kainate receptor subunits has been noted previously (29Masu M. Tanabe Y. Tsuchida K. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Nature. 1991; 349: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). A second cDNA clone with an insert of ∼5 kbp (phPCaR-5.2) was sequenced and shown to have several differences from the phPCaR-4.0 clone. In the 5′-untranslated region (UTR), both clones show identical sequence from the start codon to −242 bp, at which point the sequences completely diverge (Fig. 1). The 4.0 sequence extends 132 bp 5′ of this point, while the 5.2 sequence extends another 198 bp. In comparing these two human 5′-UTRs to the 5′-UTR of the bovine CaR cDNA, the human and bovine clones show related sequence from the initiation codon to the point at −242 bp after which the bovine clone shows no relationship to either of the two human cDNA sequences. It appears that alternative 5′-UTR exons have been spliced onto a common coding region in the human CaR message. Of 16 full-length cDNA clones analyzed, nine corresponded to the 4.0 clone 5′ end and seven to the 5.2 clone 5′ end. None of these additional clones had 5′ sequence extending significantly further than that presented in Fig. 1. The 5.2 and 4.0 clones also differ at the 3′ ends of the cDNA inserts, again in non-coding sequence. The 4.0 clone terminates in a run of A residues, but this is not preceded by a typical poly(A) addition sequence. The 5.2 clone is identical in sequence with the 4.0 clone at its 3′ end, but extends beyond the 4.0 clone 3′ terminus another 1138 bp. This extension corresponds to the long 3′-UTR on the bovine CaR cDNA clone. The 5.2 cDNA terminates in a poly(A) tail at its 3′ end, and this is preceded by a polyadenylation signal. The 5.2 sequence shows a cluster of A residues at the point where the 4.0 clone terminates. The cDNA synthesis was primed with oligo(dT), and it is possible that the 4.0 poly(A) tail represents priming at this internal cluster of A residues rather than at a true poly(A) tail on a mRNA; the absence of a polyadenylation signal preceding the end of the 4.0 clone would support this conclusion. Of 16 clones analyzed, five had 3′ ends corresponding to the 5.2 clone, 10 had 3′ ends corresponding to the 4.0 clone, and a single clone had a poly(A) tail beginning at 4001 bp on the 5.2 sequence (Fig. 2). There is a close approximation of the consensus polyadenylation sequence preceding the poly(A) tail on this latter clone, and it would appear that it is a polyadenylation site that is infrequently utilized. Within the coding sequence the two human clones show three differences. Between amino acids 536 and 537 on the 4.0 sequence, the 5.2 sequence has an insertion of 10 amino acids (30 bp) (Fig. 1). In comparing the human to the bovine CaR in this region, the bovine CaR protein is an exact match to the 4.0 sequence. None of the other cDNA clones analyzed have this 30 bp insertion, and the significance of this cDNA variant remains unknown. Comparison of the 4.0 and 5.2 sequences show two single base pair differences, with each resulting in an amino acid difference. At amino acid 926, the 4.0 cDNA encodes Gln and the 5.2 cDNA encodes Arg; the bovine cDNA encodes Gln at this position. At amino acid 990, the 4.0 cDNA encodes Gly and the 5.2 cDNA encodes Arg; the bovine cDNA encodes Arg at this position. This latter variant has been shown to be a benign polymorphism present in the human population.2( 2J. E. Garrett and H. Heath, III, unpublished observations.) The former single base pair variant is most likely an error introduced during cDNA synthesis or cloning procedures. The two cDNAs both give rise to functionally similar proteins following expression in oocytes (see following data), and it appears that these amino acid variations in the phPCaR-5.2 clone have no discernible functional consequence. The functional properties of exogenously expressed Ca2+ mobilizing receptors in Xenopus oocytes can be monitored through the activity of an endogenous Ca2+-dependent Cl− current. Oocytes injected with in vitro transcribed human CaR cRNA respond to extracellular application of Ca2+ (3-10 mM) with large inward Cl− currents (Fig. 4A), while water-injected control oocytes show no such response. Although in vitro transcribed RNA from both clones phPCaR-4.0 and 5.2 gave a CaR response following 2-4 days incubation in the oocyte, both human clones routinely gave smaller responses than an equivalent amount of CaR cRNA transcribed from the bovine clone. Deleting the 5′-UTR up to a point 26 bp 5′ of the initiation codon gave much stronger (5-10-fold larger Cl− current amplitudes) functional responses for the human CaR cRNA (data not shown). Human CaR clones phPCaR-4.0 or 5.2 expressed in oocytes respond to extracellular Ca2+ with half-maximal effective concentrations (EC50) of 7.05 ± 0.19 and 7.51 ± 0.12 mM, respectively (Fig. 4B), somewhat elevated from the Ca2+ set point measured in vitro on human parathyroid cells. The bovine CaR, expressed in oocytes under identical conditions, also had a somewhat elevated EC50 for Ca2+ of ∼4.5 mM. The EC50 values of the CaR agonists Gd3+, neomycin, and Mg2+ determined for the human CaR expressed in oocytes (∼50 μM, ∼100 μM, and ∼12 mM, respectively) are similar to those seen with bovine parathyroid cells (7Nemeth E.F. Scarpa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5188-5196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Brown E.M. Butters R. Katz C. Kifor O. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 3047-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). All of these CaR agonists elicit a response in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, indicating that the activation of the Ca2+-dependent Cl− current is due to release of intracellular Ca2+ stores and not influx of extracellular Ca2+. We have cloned human parathyroid CaR cDNAs from an adenomatous gland. The encoded CaR protein displays several of the features predicted by functional studies of this novel extracellular cation receptor. When expressed in oocytes, the CaR is activated by known CaR agonists with the same rank order of potency seen in parathyroid cells and is coupled to the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+. The recent findings that mutations in the CaR gene result in FHH and neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism (13Pollak M.R. Brown E.M. Chou Y-H.W. Hebert S.C. Marx S.J. Steinmann B. Levi T. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Cell. 1993; 75: 1297-1303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar), and that pharmacological activation of this receptor elicits hypocalcemia (15Fox J. Hadfield S. Petty B.A. Nemeth E.F. J. Bone. Miner. Res. 1993; 8 (abstr.): S181Google Scholar), provides further evidence that this cloned CaR protein plays a central role in modulating parathyroid gland function and bodily Ca2+ homeostasis. The CaR sequence predicts a cluster of seven hydrophobic segments, a feature common to all known GPRs. Based on this feature, the structure of the CaR is proposed to consist of an unusually large NH2-terminal extracellular domain, a membrane-spanning domain with seven transmembrane regions, and a relatively large COOH-terminal intracellular domain. Searches of protein and nucleic acid sequence data bases show the CaR to share sequence similarity with the rat mGluRs, but no other known GPRs. Together, the CaR and mGluRs define a novel subfamily within the large group of GPRs. The overall domain structure of the CaR and mGluRs, with large NH2-terminal extracellular regions and membrane-spanning domains with relatively short extracellular and intracellular loops, is nearly identical (the proteins can be aligned with very few gaps introduced). Although the sequence similarity between the CaR and mGluRs is low (18-24% identity overall), it extends throughout the extracellular and membrane-spanning domains, with localized regions of identity that are quite high. The putative extracellular domains of both human and bovine CaR contain nine conserved sites for N-linked glycosylation, supporting the extracellular assignment of this region and consistent with previous findings suggesting that the CaR is a glycoprotein (9Fuleihan G.E.-H. Katz C. Kifor O. Gleason R. Brown E.M. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 2931-2936Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Both the human and bovine CaR proteins contain 20 cysteine residues, located in the NH2-terminal extracellular domain and extracellular loops, whose positions are conserved between the CaRs and mGluRs. This observation, coupled with the extensive sequence homology throughout the extracellular domains, suggests that the CaR and mGluRs may share a common structural conformation in this region. NH2-terminal extracellular domain of mGluR1 has been shown to function in ligand selectivity (30Takahashi K. Tsuchida K. Tanabe Y. Masu M. Nakanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19341-19345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extracellular domains of the mGluRs and ionotropic GluRs (iGluRs) share low level sequence homology with each other, and with bacterial periplasmic amino acid-binding proteins (PBPs). The conformation of the ligand-binding sites of mGluRs and iGluRs have been modeled on the known structures of the homologous bacterial PBPs, with the suggestion that the sequence conservation reflects a relationship to a common ancestral amino acid-binding structure (31O'Hara P.J. Sheppard P.O. Thogersen H. Venenzia D. Haldeman B.A. McGrane V. Houamed K.M. Thomsen C. Gilbert T.L. Mulvihill E.R.

Neuron. 1994; 12: 1291-1300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). In addition to the homology to mGluRs, the extracellular domain of the CaR protein shows a low level of sequence similarity to an extracellular domain of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (an iGluR). This sequence conservation suggests that the CaR extracellular domain may serve as a ligand interaction site, with structural homology to the ligand-binding domains of the glutamate receptors and PBPs. The ligand for the CaR is not an amino acid, but Ca2+, and glutamate receptor agonists do not activate the CaR when expressed in oocytes (18Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M.A. Lytton J. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar). The CaR functions in ambient Ca2+ concentrations in the low millimolar range, and consistent with this the CaR protein does not contain any of the consensus sequences proposed for high affinity Ca2+ binding (33Smith V.L. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Low affinity Ca2+ binding has been associated with stretches of acidic residues (34Fliegel L. Ohnishi M. Carpenter M.R. Khanna V.K. Reithmeier R.A.F. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1167-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and the CaR does contain acidic regions in the NH2-terminal extracellular domain (amino acids 215-251 and 556-610) and second extracellular loop (ELEDE). These acidic regions are conserved between the human and bovine CaRs, but not in the mGluRs. The CaR extracellular region may represent a ligand-binding domain with a conformation structurally homologous to that of the PBPs/GluRs, but modified for low affinity interaction with cationic compounds. Activation of protein kinase C decreases the sensitivity of parathyroid cells to regulation by extracellular Ca2+, and it has been suggested that this effect may result from direct phosphorylation of the CaR (10Racke F.K. Nemeth E.F. J. Physiol. 1993; 468: 141-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 11Racke F.K. Nemeth E.F. J. Physiol. 1993; 468: 163-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The bovine and human CaRs show potential sites for protein kinase C phosphorylation in the first and third intracellular loops and in the intracellular C-terminal domain, thus providing sites on the CaR consistent with this view. The COOH-terminal intracellular domain is the only region displaying extensive sequence divergence between the human and bovine CaRs, and the human protein has one additional protein kinase C site in this region, as well as potential sites for protein kinase A phosphorylation. The intracellular regions of GPRs are known to function in modulating receptor interactions with cellular signal transduction pathways, and variations in this region raise the possibility of species differences in the coupling of CaR activation to intracellular signaling pathways. The human CaR cDNA clones were isolated from an adenomatous parathyroid gland removed from a patient with 1° HPT. In 1° HPT, parathyroid cells show an elevation in the Ca2+ concentration at which PTH secretion is half-maximally suppressed (the Ca2+ set-point), and alterations in the CaR have been proposed to underlie this set-point increase (12Brown E.M. LeBoff M.S. Prog. Surg. 1986; 18: 13-22Crossref Google Scholar), just as a mutation in the CaR has been shown to account for the decreased sensitivity to extracellular Ca2+ seen in one instance of FHH (13Pollak M.R. Brown E.M. Chou Y-H.W. Hebert S.C. Marx S.J. Steinmann B. Levi T. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Cell. 1993; 75: 1297-1303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Somatic mutation leading to alteration of the CaR protein sequence expressed in the adenomatous gland is a possibility, but it is unlikely to be the case in the particular tumor under study. The phPCaR-4.0 and 5.2 clones do have three sequence differences in the coding region, yet extracellular Ca2+ is equipotent in activating either receptor. The EC50 for Ca2+ activation of both CaR clones expressed in the oocyte is elevated relative to that seen in parathyroid cells, but that is likely a function of expression in the Xenopus system. Elevated EC50 values for Ca2+ activation of the CaR were seen in oocytes expressing either bovine parathyroid gland mRNA (27Racke F.R. Hammerland L.G. Dubyak G.R. Nemeth E.F. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) or the pBoPCaR1 cRNA, suggesting that the apparent elevation of the CaR set-point is inherent in this exogenous expression system. One of the differences between the two cDNA clones sequenced, a 10 amino acid insertion in the NH2-terminal extracellular domain of the phPCaR-5.2 clone, arises from alternative splice site selection, and is a rare occurrence in parathyroid mRNA.3( 3J. E. Garrett, unpublished observations.) The phPCaR-4.0 coding region sequence is an exact match to the normal human CaR gene, except for the change at amino acid 990, and this change is a polymorphism present in the human population and is not associated with parathyroid disease.2 The sequence difference at amino acid 926 in the phPCaR-5.2 clone is likely due to a cloning artifact, and this clone does give rise to a functional receptor. Thus, two independent CaR cDNA clones from the adenomatous gland do not appear to bear coding region mutations that could account for a set-point increase. A survey of CaR sequences from a collection of adenomatous parathyroid glands will be required to rigorously exclude the occurrence of CaR mutations leading to 1° HPT. It is possible that the set-point increase characteristic of 1° HPT is not due to an alteration of the primary sequence of the receptor, but reflects a change in the amount of receptor protein relative to the increased mass of the hypercellular adenoma. The severe impairment of parathyroid function in neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism, the homozygous form of FHH, suggests that the levels of functional CaR protein are an important determinant of proper extracellular Ca2+ sensing (13Pollak M.R. Brown E.M. Chou Y-H.W. Hebert S.C. Marx S.J. Steinmann B. Levi T. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Cell. 1993; 75: 1297-1303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar, 30Takahashi K. Tsuchida K. Tanabe Y. Masu M. Nakanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19341-19345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A decrease in CaR levels in parathyroid adenomas could account for the observed set-point increases. The parathyroid adenoma examined in this study shows multiple CaR transcripts by Northern blot analysis, and cDNA clones reveal alternative RNA processing of 5′- and 3′-UTRs. The use of alternative promoters, or alternative processing to RNA species that may differ in their stability or the efficiency with which they are translated, are all events which could alter the levels of functional CaR protein expressed in the disease tissue. A third possibility is that CaR levels remain normal in a parathyroid adenoma, but secondary modifications of the receptor protein, or an alteration in the signaling pathways downstream of the receptor, results in the observed set-point increase. For example, increased activity of protein kinase C could result in a decreased sensitivity of the CaR to extracellular Ca2+. The isolation of these human CaR cDNA clones will facilitate studies aimed at addressing these questions of the involvement of the CaR in the etiology of 1° HPT."

MAPKK and MAPK are thought to form a linear pathway called the MAPKK/MAPK cascade, which has been shown to play a pivotal role in diverse biological processes including fibroblastic cell proliferation and transformation (7Pages G.

Raf-1 is a proto-oncogene product and is one of targets of p21ras (for review, see Ref. 19Avruch J. Zhang X-f. Kyriakis J.M. Trends Biochem.

These kinases are distantly related to classical MAPKs, and may have separate and/or overlapping functions.To see possible functional separation or redundancy of these members of the MAPK superfamily, identification of extracellular signals that elicit activation of these kinases and dissection of their signaling pathways are needed. As a first step to approach these problems, we surveyed conditions that lead to activation of both classical and novel members of the MAPK superfamily, and found that osmotic shock induces marked activation of both MAPKs and SAPKs in fibroblastic cells. Interestingly, both Raf-1 and MEKK have been found to be activated markedly also by osmotic shock. In addition, we have found that XMEK2 (35Yasher B.M. Kelley C. Yee K. Errede B. Zon L.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5738-5748Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), which is distantly related to MAPKK, can function as a SAPK kinase and can be activated directly by MEKK.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibodiesAnti-MEKK antibody (=antibody against both N- and C-terminal fragments of MEKK) was purchased from UBI.

Nishida E. Yamashita T. Hoshi M. Kawakami M. Sakai H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, after electrophoresis, SDS was removed by washing the gel with 20% 2-propanol. Then, after denaturation with 6 M guanidine HCl and renaturation in a 0.04% Tween 40-containing buffer, the gel was incubated at 22°C for 1 h with 10 ml of a reaction buffer consisting of 40 mM Hepes, pH 8.0, 0.1 mM EGTA, 20 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol, and 25 μM [γ-32P]ATP (25 μCi). Myelin basic protein (MBP, 0.5 mg/ml), microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2, 0.1 mg/ml), or c-Jun (0.05 mg/ml) was used as a substrate in gels. These substrate proteins were added to the separation gel prior to polymerization of acrylamide. MBP was purchased from Sigma. MAP2 was purified from porcine brain (39Nishida E. Hoshi M. Miyata Y.

The proteins were purified by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography (for glutathione S-transferase fusion protein) or by amylose resin (for maltose-binding protein fusion protein) followed by phenyl-Sepharose column chromatography. The purified proteins were dialyzed against a buffer consisting of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mM EGTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% aprotinin and stored at −80°C. No difference was observed between both types of recombinant XMEK2 in any of the experiments presented here. The kinase-negative XMEK2 was obtained by a lysine-to-arginine mutation in the presumptive ATP-binding site as described (35Yasher B.M. Kelley C. Yee K. Errede B. Zon L.I. Mol. Cell.

Rat PC12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.35% glucose, 5% heat-inactivated horse serum, and 10% fetal calf serum. Confluent cultures of rat 3Y1 cells were exposed to various concentrations of NaCl. Semiconfluent cultures of rat PC12 cells were exposed to various concentrations of NaCl or 30 nM EGF. Various times after the exposure, cells were lysed in a buffer consisting of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM EGTA, 60 mM β-glycerophosphate, 10 mM MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM vanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1% aprotinin and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 2°C. The supernatant (approximately 0.1 mg/ml cellular proteins) was subjected to in-gel kinase assays or immune complex kinase assays.Immunoprecipitation and Immune Complex Kinase AssaysFor immunoprecipitation, 5 μg of the appropriate antibody was added to 400-μl aliquots of lysate (approximately 40 μg of cellular proteins) and incubated for 4 h at 4°C. 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose was added to the tubes, and incubation continued for a further 1 h. The precipitates were washed three times with the buffer containing 0.5 M NaCl. To assay for MAPKK1, the immunocomplex with anti-MAPKK1 antibody, bound to 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose, was suspended in 15 μl of a buffer consisting of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mM EGTA, 10 mM MgCl2, and 100 μM ATP (referred to as kinase buffer) containing 5 μg of Xenopus recombinant MAPK (40Gotoh Y.

After addition of 10 μg of MBP and [γ-32P]ATP (1 μCi), the reaction mixture was incubated for a further 15 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of Laemmli's sample buffer. Phosphorylated MBP was resolved by SDS-PAGE and quantified by an image analyzer (FUJIX BAS 2000). To assay for MAPKK activating activity (=MAPKK-K activity), the immunocomplex with anti-MEKK antibody or anti-Raf-1 antibody, bound to 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose, was suspended in 15 μl of the kinase buffer containing 5 μg of Xenopus recombinant MAPKK (42Kosako H.

The reaction mixture was incubated for 1 h at 30°C. The reaction was stopped by addition of Laemmli's sample buffer. Phosphorylated glutathione S-transferase kinase-negative MAPK was resolved by SDS-PAGE and quantified by an image analyzer.

The reaction was stopped by addition of Laemmli's sample buffer. Phosphorylated XMEK2 was resolved by SDS-PAGE and autoradiographed. To assay for XMEK2 activating activity, the MEKK immunoprecipitate was suspended in 15 μl of the kinase buffer containing 5 μg of recombinant wild-type XMEK2 and 10 μg of recombinant SAPKα, and incubated for 1 h at 30°C. The reaction mixture was then subjected to Jun in-gel kinase assay to detect enhanced activity of recombinant SAPKα.Measurement of Protein Kinases in VitroTo measure the activity of XMEK2 to activate SAPKα, either 2 or 4 μg of recombinant SAPKα was mixed with 5 μg of recombinant XMEK2 in a final volume of 15 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 μg of Jun and [γ-32P]ATP (1 μCi). The reaction mixture was incubated for the indicated times at 20°C. The reaction was stopped by addition of Laemmli's sample buffer. Phosphorylated Jun was resolved by SDS-PAGE and quantified by an image analyzer.

The reaction mixture was incubated at 30°C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of Laemmli's sample buffer. To assay for MAPK activating activity, 5 μg of recombinant MAPK was mixed with either 2 μg of recombinant MAPKK or 5 μg of recombinant XMEK2 in a final volume of 15 μl of kinase buffer. The reaction mixture was incubated at 30°C for 30 min. Then, 10 μg of MBP and [γ-32P]ATP (1 μCi) were added to the reaction mixture and incubated for a further 30 min.

Cytol. 1992; 138: 211-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Rat 3Y1 cells were exposed to various extracellular stimuli such as growth factors, phorbol esters, heat shock, and osmotic shock, and extracts from these cells were analyzed by in-gel kinase assays containing MBP, microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), c-Jun (Jun), histone, or casein.3( 3H. Kawasaki, Y. Gotoh, and E. Nishida, unpublished results.) Among these stimuli, hyper-osmolar media (with NaCl) were found to induce activation of both MAPKs and SAPKs markedly (see Fig. 1). MBP is a good substrate for MAPKs (38Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Yamashita T. Hoshi M. Kawakami M. Sakai H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 43Nishida E.

Chem. 1991; 266: 15277-15285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Both p43MAPK (ERK1) and p41MAPK (ERK2) were activated in a time-dependent manner when 3Y1 cells were exposed to hyper-osmolar media (Fig. 1A, MBP, arrows). The activation was detected within 3 min of exposure of the cells to 0.5 M NaCl and peaked about 30-60 min after the exposure (Fig. 1A, MBP). At the maximum, almost full activation occurred, as almost full conversion to the electrophoretically retarded band was observed in the immunoblotting with anti-MAPK antibody (data not shown). Concomitant with the activation of MAPKs, p54SAPK and p46SAPK were activated by the osmotic shock; the time course of their activation was similar to that of MAPK activation (Fig. 1A, Jun and MAP2, arrowheads). Identification of these two polypeptides as SAPK was shown by their substrate specificity in in-gel kinase assays; their ability to phosphorylate Jun and MAP2 and their inability to phosphorylate MBP, histone, or casein (Fig. 1A and data not shown) and reactivity to anti-SAPK antibody that had been produced by immunizing rabbits with recombinant rat SAPKα (data not shown). Activation of about half of the molecules was achieved at the maximum, as revealed by the mobility shift in immunoblotting (data not shown). The activation was dependent on the concentration of NaCl; the maximum activation was observed at 0.7 M NaCl (Fig. 1B). The activation was reversible. When the cells were exposed to 0.7 M NaCl for 5 min and then returned to normal medium, inactivation of SAPKs occurred rapidly (Fig. 1C), suggesting that mechanisms inactivating SAPKs may be operating constitutively under normal conditions. Activation of MAPKs and SAPKs in 3Y1 cells could be induced by hyper-osmolar media with sorbitol as well as with NaCl (data not shown).Activation of MAPKK activity also occurred when cells were exposed to hyper-osmolar media with NaCl. Various times after the exposure of the cells to 0.7 M NaCl, MAPKK1 was immunoprecipitated from the cell extracts and assayed for MAPKK activity (=MAPK activating activity). MAPKK1 was activated in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2). This time course was similar to that of MAPK activation (Fig. 1A, MBP).Figure 2:Activation of MAPKK1 in response to osmotic shock. 3Y1 cells were exposed to 0.7 M NaCl and cell lysates were prepared at the indicated times. A 400-μl aliquot of cell lysates was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-MAPKK1 antibody and the immunoprecipitate was assayed for MAPKK1 activity as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Since previous studies have shown that Raf-1 and MEKK can work as a MAPKK kinase that phosphorylates and activates MAPKK, we followed their activity in rat 3Y1 cells after osmotic shock. Extracts were obtained from the cells that had been exposed to 0.7 M NaCl for 0, 20, and 50 min, and were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Raf-1 antibody or anti-MEKK antibody, and each immunoprecipitate was assayed for the MAPKK activating activity. Both Raf-1 and MEKK were found to be activated by the exposure of the cells to hyper-osmolar media (Fig. 3). These activations were quite striking and reproducibly observed.Figure 3:Activation of MEKK and Raf-1 in response to osmotic shock. Rat 3Y1 cells were exposed to 0.7 M NaCl and cell lysates were prepared at 0, 20, and 50 min after the exposure. A 400-μl aliquot of cell lysates was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-MEKK antibody (left) or anti-Raf-1 antibody (right) immobilized on protein A-Sepharose, and assayed for MAPKK activating activity as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The activation of both Raf-1 and MEKK in response to high NaCl concentrations was observed also in rat PC12 cells (Fig. 4A). It was reproducibly observed that MEKK activation by osmotic shock (NaCl) was much stronger than that by EGF while Raf-1 activation by both stimuli was comparable (Fig. 4A). Both p54SAPK and p46SAPK were activated markedly by the osmotic shock in PC12 cells (Fig. 4B), while they were activated very weakly by EGF (Fig. 4B). Thus, SAPK activation correlated apparently with MEKK activation and MEKK might function upstream of SAPK. If so, it is reasonable to assume that MEKK may phosphorylate and activate a presumptive SAPK-activating kinase which should be distantly related to MAPKK, because MAPKK is shown to be incapable of activating SAPK in vitro (Ref. 28, data not shown). Then, we hypothesized that XMEK2 (35Yasher B.M. Kelley C. Yee K. Errede B. Zon L.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5738-5748Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), which encodes a member of the MAPKK superfamily and is distantly related to MAPKK in structure, might be a SAPK kinase and serve as a substrate for MEKK. Consistent with this hypothesis, bacterially-produced XMEK2 was phosphorylated by the anti-MEKK immunoprecipitate obtained from rat 3Y1 cells (see Fig. 6A). In addition, the ability of MEKK to phosphorylate XMEK2 was activated by the osmotic shock and EGF, like the MAPKK activating activity (data not shown), supporting that MEKK phosphorylates XMEK2.Figure 4:Activation of MEKK, Raf-1, and SAPK in PC12 cells. A, cell lysates were prepared from PC12 cells treated with none, 0.7 M NaCl for 15 min, or 30 nM EGF for 3 min. A 400-μl aliquot of cell lysates was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-MEKK antibody (left) or anti-Raf-1 antibody (right) immobilized on protein A-Sepharose, and the immunoprecipitate was assayed for the activity as in Fig. 3. B, PC12 cells were exposed to 0.4 or 0.8 M NaCl for 60 min or 30 nM EGF for 3 min. Each lysate was subjected to in-gel kinase assay containing Jun.

In this study, we have examined the role of heterotrimeric G-proteins in mastoparan-induced insulin secretion from the insulin-secreting β-cell line β-TC3. Mastoparan stimulated insulin secretion in a dose-dependent manner from digitonin-permeabilized β-TC3 cells. Active mastoparan analogues mastoparan 7, mastoparan 8, and mastoparan X also stimulated secretion. Mastoparan 17, an inactive analogue of mastoparan, did not increase insulin secretion from permeabilized β-TC3 cells. Mastoparan-induced insulin secretion from permeabilized β-TC3 cells was inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin, suggesting that mastoparan-induced insulin secretion is mediated through a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein present distally in exocytosis. Enriched insulin secretory granules (ISG) were prepared by sucrose/nycodenz ultracentrifugation. Western immunoblotting performed on β-TC3 homogenate and ISG demonstrated that Gαi was dramatically enriched in ISG. Levels of Gαo and Gαq were comparable in homogenate and ISG. Mastoparan stimulated ISG GTPase activity in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner. Mastoparan 7 and mastoparan 8 also stimulated GTPase activity in the ISG, while the inactive analogue mastoparan 17 had no effect. Selective localization of Gαi to ISG was confirmed with electron microscopic immunocytochemistry in β-TC3 cells and β-cells from rat pancreas. In contrast to Gαo and Gαq, Gαi was clearly localized to the ISG. Together, these data suggest that mastoparan may act through the heterotrimeric G-protein Gαi located in the ISG of β-cells to stimulate insulin secretion.

Insulin secretion from β-cells can be stimulated by different types of secretagogues (1Ashcroft S.J. Diabetologia. 1980; 18: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). D-Glucose, a fuel secretagogue, is the major physiological stimulus (2Hedeskov C.J. Physiol. Rev. 1980; 60: 442-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 3Malaisse W.J. Sener A. Herchuelz A. Hutton J.C. Metabolism. 1979; 28: 373-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which glucose-induced insulin release occurs is not completely elucidated, although glucose oxidation is essential (3Malaisse W.J. Sener A. Herchuelz A. Hutton J.C. Metabolism. 1979; 28: 373-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 4Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 647-652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Meglasson M.D. Matschinsky F.M.

Glucokinase is believed to act as a glucose sensor, with phosphorylation of glucose to glucose 6-phosphate serving as the rate-limiting step in glucose oxidation (7Matschinsky F. Liang Y. Kesavan P. Wang L. Froguel P. Velho G. Cohen D. Permutt M.A. Tanizawa Y. Jetton T.L. Niswender K. Magnuson M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2092-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). While inhibition of glucose oxidation inhibits insulin release, the details of the mechanism coupling glucose oxidation to insulin secretion are less clear. It is currently believed that oxidation of fuel secretagogues increases intracellular levels of ATP (8Rajan A.S. Aguilar-Bryan L. Nelson D.A. Yaney G.C. Hsu W.H. Kunze D.L. Boyd A.E. Diabetes Care. 1990; 13: 340-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), although this view has been challenged by some groups (9MacDonald M.J. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 1461-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). An increased ATP/ADP ratio is believed to close KATP+ channels at the plasma membrane, resulting in decreased K+ efflux and subsequent depolarization of the β-cell (10Misler S. Falke L.C. Gillis K. McDaniel M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7119-7123Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 11Dunne M.J. Petersen O.H. Biochim. Biophys.

Depolarization then activates voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, causing an influx of extracellular Ca2+ into the β-cell and an increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels (6Wollheim C.B. Sharp G.W. Physiol. Rev. 1981; 61: 914-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 13Prentki M. Matschinsky F.M. Physiol. Rev. 1987; 67: 1185-1248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it has recently been shown that nutrient secretagogues increase β-cell malonyl-CoA levels, which leads to increased cytosolic long-chain acyl-CoA esters that positively modulate insulin secretion (14Corkey B.E.

While increased intracellular Ca2+ activates protein kinases such as the Ca2+- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (17Turk J. Wolf B.A. McDaniel M.L. Prog.

Easom R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4947-4952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the mechanism by which insulin exocytosis occurs is not completely elucidated. Over the past few years, factors other than calcium have been proposed to be involved, including GTP and small monomeric GTP-binding proteins such as Rab3A (22Olszewski S. Deeney J.T. Schuppin G.T. Williams K.P. Corkey B.E. Rhodes C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27987-27991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to small GTP-binding proteins, heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins have also been implicated in regulating insulin secretion by pancreatic β-cells (23Robertson R.P. Seaquist E.R. Walseth T.F. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 24Hsu W.H. Xiang H.D. Rajan A.S. Kunze D.L. Boyd III, A.E. J. Biol.

Epinephrine is an adrenergic agonist that inhibits insulin secretion by acting through a heterotrimeric G-protein (23Robertson R.P. Seaquist E.R. Walseth T.F. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 26Seaquist E.R. Neal A.R. Shoger K.D. Walseth T.F. Robertson R.P.

Although epinephrine acts through a G-protein-coupled adrenergic receptor located on the plasma membrane of the β-cell to decrease cAMP accumulation, this is not thought to account entirely for its inhibition of insulin secretion (26Seaquist E.R. Neal A.R. Shoger K.D. Walseth T.F. Robertson R.P. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 1390-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The ability of epinephrine to inhibit insulin secretion is believed to be due to its action on the distal portion of the insulin exocytotic pathway, since epinephrine is capable of inhibiting calcium-induced insulin secretion from permeabilized β-cells (27Ullrich S.

Epinephrine is thought to inhibit insulin release by acting through a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein. Epinephrine inhibition of insulin secretion is itself inhibited by pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin, which ADP ribosylates pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein α subunits at a cysteine residue located four amino acids from the carboxyl terminus (26Seaquist E.R. Neal A.R. Shoger K.D. Walseth T.F. Robertson R.P. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 1390-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This ADP ribosylation renders the G-protein α subunit incapable of interacting with its receptor. In addition to epinephrine, a variety of other compounds are thought to modulate insulin secretion by acting through heterotrimeric G-proteins (23Robertson R.P. Seaquist E.R. Walseth T.F. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). One class of such compounds consists of amphiphilic peptides. A well known member of this class is mastoparan, a tetradecapeptide found in wasp venom. Mastoparan stimulates insulin secretion from β-cells (28Jones P.M. Mann F.M. Persaud S.J. Wheeler-Jones C.P.D.

Chem. 1992; 267: 21421-21424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mastoparan is thought to stimulate these G-proteins by inserting itself into the membrane adjacent to G-proteins and mimicking the normal interaction that occurs between G-protein-coupled receptors and their respective G-proteins (37Mousli M. Bueb J.L. Bronner C. Rouot B. Landry Y. Trends. Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 358-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 38Mousli M. Bronner C. Landry Y. Bockaert J. Rouot B. FEBS Lett. 1990; 259: 260-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Mastoparan is believed to bind to the carboxyl terminus of the G-protein α subunit, resulting in βγ and GDP dissociation from the α subunit, causing the α subunit to assume the active configuration (39Weingarten R. Ransnas L. Mueller H. Sklar L.A. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11044-11049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Tomita U. Inanobe A. Kobayashi I. Takahashi K. Ui M. Katada T. J. Biochem.(Tokyo). 1991; 109: 184-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Mastoparan, however, unlike epinephrine, stimulates insulin secretion from β-cells, suggesting that G-proteins, in addition to having a role in negatively modulating insulin secretion, may also positively modulate insulin secretion (28Jones P.M. Mann F.M. Persaud S.J. Wheeler-Jones C.P.D. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 94: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 29Komatsu M. McDermott A.M. Gillison S.L. Sharp G.W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23297-23306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The identity of the G-protein through which mastoparan stimulates insulin secretion from the β-cell is unknown. To better understand if mastoparan stimulates insulin secretion from the β-cell by acting distally in exocytosis, we have examined the effects of mastoparan and its analogues on insulin secretion from digitonin-permeabilized β-cells. We have also examined the effects of various mastoparan analogues on GTPase activity of insulin secretory granules (ISG)1( 1The abbreviations used are: ISGinsulin secretory granuleTES2-([2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino)ethanesulfonic acidPBSphosphate-buffered salineMES2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acidGTPγSguanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate).) prepared from β-cells and have shown that the ability of mastoparan analogues to stimulate ISG GTPase activity correlates with their ability to stimulate insulin secretion. Finally, we have used G-protein antisera for Western blotting and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry in order to determine which G-protein is localized to the ISG of β-cells and is a target for mastoparan. insulin secretory granule 2-([2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino)ethanesulfonic acid phosphate-buffered saline 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). Tissue culture medium (CMRL-1066) and 1 M HEPES were from Life Technologies, Inc. Newborn bovine serum was from Hazleton Biologics (Lenexa, KS). β-TC3 cells (passage 34) were obtained through the University of Pennsylvania Diabetes Center from Dr. D. Hanahan (University of California, San Francisco). The following compounds were purchased from Sigma: D-glucose, carbachol, Hanks' balanced salt solution, penicillin, streptomycin, glutamine, Ficoll, bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, ATP, GTP, NAD, thymidine, and creatine phosphate. Pertussis toxin was purchased from List Biological Laboratories (Campbell, CA). Mastoparan; its active analogues mastoparan 7, mastoparan 8, and mastoparan X; and its inactive analogue mastoparan 17 were purchased from Peninsula Laboratories (Belmont, CA).

Antisera to selected G-proteins were raised by injecting New Zealand White rabbits with synthetic decapeptides corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal amino acid sequences of the respective G-proteins as described previously (41Williams A.G.

In this study, the following antisera were used for Western blotting and electron microscopic immunocytochemical analysis of rat pancreas: anti-Gi 8730 (immunogen (KLH)KNNLKDCGLF), anti-Go 9072 (immunogen (KLH)ANNLRGCGLY), and anti-Gq 946 (immunogen (KLH)QLNLKEYNLV). These same antisera, along with anti-Gi/Go 5296 (immunogen bovine brain Go) were used for electron microscopic immunocytochemical analysis of β-TC3 cells. β-TC3 cells were cultured in 6-well plates or 15-cm dishes in the presence of RPMI 1640 (11 mM glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (75 μg/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), and 2 mML-glutamine. Cells were trypsinized and subcloned weekly. Medium was changed twice weekly and the day prior to an experiment. Insulin secretory capacity of the β-TC3 cells in response to glucose and carbachol was monitored regularly. Cells were used between passages 40 and 55. Approximately 24 h prior to the experiment, β-TC3 cells in either 6-well plates or 15-cm dishes were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 50 ng/ml pertussis toxin. β-TC3 cells in 6-well plates were washed 3 times with 2 ml of Krebs-HEPES buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.40, 115 mM NaCl, 24 mM NaHCO3, 5 mM KCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin). Cells in monolayers were permeabilized in the same media supplemented with 20 μg/ml digitonin for 10 min at 37°C under an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2(44Wolf B.A. Florholmen J. Turk J. McDaniel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3565-3575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using this method, greater than 99% permeabilization of β-TC3 cells was achieved as assessed by trypan blue exclusion. Lactate dehydrogenase release into the permeabilization medium was found to become maximal at a digitonin concentration of 20 μg/ml. Permeabilized cells were washed 3 times with 2 ml of TES buffer (50 mM TES, pH 7.40, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgCl2, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin). Cells were incubated for 60 min at 37°C under an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 with fresh buffer supplemented with 1 mM ATP and the appropriate secretagogue. In selected experiments, an ATP regenerating system consisting of 5 mM creatine phosphate and 0.2 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase was included. At the end of the incubation period, a sample of the supernatant was removed for insulin measurement by radioimmunoassay (45Konrad R.J. Jolly Y.C. Major C. Wolf B.A. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). β-TC3 cells were fractionated by sequential centrifugation using a sucrose/nycodenz gradient as described previously (46Hutton J.C. Penn E.J. Peshavaria M. Diabetologia. 1982; 23: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). 10-20 confluent 15-cm dishes of β-TC3 cells were washed 3 times with ice-cold 50 mM MES, pH 7.20, containing 0.25 M sucrose and 1 mM EGTA. Cells were scraped and resuspended in 1 ml of the same buffer. Cells were then mechanically homogenized with 10 strokes of a motor-driven Teflon pestle in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizing tube. The homogenate was centrifuged (600 × g, 5 min) to remove intact cells and nuclear debris. The supernatant was saved, and the pellet was homogenized twice more as above. Supernatants were combined and transferred to a 13-ml Beckman ultracentrifuge tube already underlaid with stepwise gradients (4 ml) of nycodenz stock/homogenization buffer in the following ratios: 16:84, 32:68, 64:36. Tubes were centrifuged at 100,000 × g (SW-40 rotor, Beckman TL-100 centrifuge) for 60 min to yield a band at the lower interface corresponding to ISG. Granules were harvested, resuspended in a 15-ml Corex tube in 14 ml of 10 mM MES, pH 6.50 containing 0.25 M sucrose, and centrifuged at 27,000 × g (Beckman J2-21 centrifuge, JA-20 rotor) for 20 min. ISG were resuspended in 100-200 μl of 10 mM MES, pH 7.40, supplemented with 1 mM EDTA. Insulin enrichment of the ISG relative to the respective homogenate was systematically checked. Enzyme marker studies were performed as described previously (47McDaniel M.L. Colca J.R. Kotagal N. Lacy P.E. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 182-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). For these experiments, 2-25 μg of protein in 20 μl of loading buffer (70 mM Tris, pH 6.7, 16 M urea, 6.0% SDS, 100 mM dithiothreitol, 0.005% bromphenol blue) were loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels. Colored rainbow molecular weight markers (Amersham Corp.) were also run on each gel. Proteins were separated for 1 h at 175 V at room temperature using a Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN II dual slab cell. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose paper (Hybond C, Amersham Corp.) for 1.5 h at 100 V at 4°C using a Bio-Rad mini Trans-Blot electrophoretic transfer cell. Nitrocellulose blots were blocked overnight in blocking buffer (1% ovalbumin, 3% bovine serum albumin, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.40, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% sodium azide) at 4°C. The next day, blots were probed with appropriate antisera at a dilution of 1:100 in blocking buffer for 3 h at room temperature. Blots were washed twice with 10 mM Tris, pH 7.40, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% sodium azide (TNA) for 10 min, once with TNA supplemented with 0.05% Nonidet P-40 for 5 min, and twice more with TNA for 10 min. Blots were incubated with 5 μCi of 125I-protein A in 10 ml of blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were washed again as above, air dried, and exposed on a PhosphorImager cassette (Molecular Dynamics) overnight at room temperature. The following day, radioactivity bound to the blot was quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 μg of sample protein to 100 μl of 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.20, supplemented with 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EGTA, 20 μM MgCl2, 1 mM ATP, 1 mM adenylyl imidodiphosphate, 5 mM creatine phosphate, 0.2 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 100 nM [γ-32P]GTP, and varying concentrations of mastoparan or mastoparan analogues in a 1.5-ml snap-top Eppendorf tube. Tubes were incubated at 30°C in a shaking water bath for 5 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 900 μl of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid, pH 2.0, supplemented with 5% charcoal by weight, which was kept continuously stirring on ice. Tubes were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C, and 32Pi in the supernatant was quantitated by liquid scintillation spectrophotometry. Blanks determined in the presence of 50 μM GTP were routinely subtracted, and GTPase activity was calculated as pmol of GTP hydrolyzed per mg of protein/min. Under these conditions, GTPase activity was linear at 30 min. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 μg of protein to 100 μl of 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.20, supplemented with 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM ATP, 0.1 mM GTP, 0.1% Lubrol, 0.02% bovine serum albumin, 10 mM thymidine, 10 μM [32P]NAD, and 5 μg/ml activated pertussis toxin. Tubes were incubated at 30°C in a shaking water bath for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 900 μl of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, pH 2.0. Tubes were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C, and membrane pellets were washed once with 1 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid, pH 2.0. Membrane pellets were then suspended in 1 ml of ice-cold diethyl ether. Ether was evaporated in a Savant concentrator connected to a −90°C cold trap, and membrane pellets were resuspended in 30 μl of loading buffer supplemented with 15 mg/ml dithiothreitol. Samples were then run on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described above. Gels were dried and exposed on a PhosphorImager cassette overnight. The following day, radioactivity bound to the blot was quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software. β-TC3 cells were plated on Costar Transwell cell culture inserts 5 days before use and cultured as described above. Medium was changed the day prior to fixation. On the day of fixation, the medium was aspirated, and 2 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.40, was added to wash the cells. Inserts were removed and transferred to a culture plate containing PBS for 1-2 min. PBS was aspirated, and 2 ml of GPA fixative containing 1% glutaraldehyde and 0.2% picric acid in pH 7.40 PBS at 4°C was added. Inserts were transferred to culture plates containing fixative. The cells were allowed to fix for 2-18 h at 4°C. Cells were dehydrated with 70, 80, and 90% ethanol at 4°C for 30 min. Cells were stained with 1% eosin B (to permit visualization of the cells) in 100% ethanol for 8 min at 24°C and washed in 100% ethanol 3-4 times. Inserts were transferred to LR White, 100% ethanol (1:1) for 2 h and through three changes of 100% LR White (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA) for 1 h, overnight, and for 1 h the next morning. The membrane on which the cells were attached was removed from the plastic insert with a scalpel. The membrane was gently rolled, with cells on the inside, into a roll approximately 2 mm in diameter. The membrane was secured in two places by tying a short length of hair around the roll. The roll was cut between the two ties and excess membrane on the outer side of the ties was removed and discarded. Membranes were placed in gelatin capsules partially filled with LR White resin with the cut end oriented toward the bottom of the capsule. Capsules were filled with resin, capped, and cured for 18 h at 60°C. Thin sections (600-700 Å thick) were cut perpendicular to the plane of the membrane and mounted on nickel grids. Pancreata were excised from male Sprague-Dawley rats and minced in the GPA fixative. Tissue was fixed 2-18 h, dehydrated, infiltrated, and embedded in LR White resin as described above. Thick sections were cut from randomly selected tissue blocks and stained with 1% toluidine blue in 1% sodium borate to select blocks with islets. Thin sections (600-700 Å thick) were cut from the selected blocks and mounted on nickel grids. Thin sections of β-TC3 cells and rat pancreas were floated section-side down on small drops of 1% ovalbumin, 0.2% cold water fish skin gelatin in PBS for 1 h at 24°C to reduce nonspecific immunoglobulin absorption. Sections of β-TC3 cells were incubated with G-protein antisera diluted one-tenth to one-thousandth with PBS overnight at 4°C in a humidified chamber. Sections were washed by transferring the grids through small drops of 20 mM Tris-HCl-buffered saline with 0.02% Tween-20, pH 7.40, (TBST) four times for 5 min, each at 24°C. β-TC3 cells were incubated with 15-nm diameter gold-labeled protein A prepared as described (48Horisberger M.

Two staining procedures were used to identify α-cells and β-cells and, by deduction, δ-cells, in islets. In the first, serial sections were cut, and different sections were stained with anti-insulin, anti-glucagon, or anti-G-protein antisera, and the antibodies were detected with gold-labeled protein A as described above. Alternatively, sections were co-incubated overnight at 4°C with anti-G-protein Ig complexed to 18-nm diameter colloidal gold and anti-insulin or anti-glucagon Ig complexed to 8-nm diameter colloidal gold. All gold-labeled immunoglobulins were prepared as described previously (49Soler A.P. Thompson K.A. Smith R.M. Jarett L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

All sections were washed twice with TBST, twice with deionized water, and then stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate for 3 min. Insulin radioimmunoassay was performed by the University of Pennsylvania Diabetes Endocrine Research Center. Protein concentrations of β-TC3 cell granule fractions and homogenates were calculated using a bicinchoninic acid microassay with bovine serum albumin as the standard (51Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provemano M.A. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1973466083,"Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) has been shown to play a key role in growth factor signaling pathways, although its signaling mechanism has not been fully elucidated. Using the yeast interaction trap system, we have identified Grb2 as a PI 3-kinase interacting protein. Our experiments demonstrate that p85, the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase, interacts with Grb2 <i>in vivo</i>, and this interaction is independent of growth factor stimulation. The direct association between Grb2 and p85 was reconstituted <i>in vitro</i> with glutathione <i>S</i>-transferase fusion proteins. Domain analyses and peptide competition indicate that the association is mediated by the SH3 domains of Grb2 and the proline-rich motifs of p85 and that only one SH3 domain is required for minimal binding. The interaction does not displace the catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase but is exclusive of Sos. Signaling through PI 3-kinase, therefore, may involve the ubiquitous adapter Grb2, which serves as a convergence point for multiple pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2064087386,"The human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) is the causative agent of an aggressive T-cell malignancy in humans. While the virus appears to maintain a state of latency in most infected cells, high level virion production is an essential step in the HTLV-I life cycle. The virally-encoded Tax protein, a potent activator of gene expression, is believed to control the switch from latency to replication. Tax stimulation of HTLV-I transcription is mediated through cellular activating transcription factor/cAMP response element binding proteins, which bind the three 21-base pair (bp) repeat viral enhancer elements. In this report, we show that viral latency may result from a highly unstable interaction between CREB and the HTLV-I 21-bp repeats, resulting in rapid dissociation of CREB from the viral promoter. In the presence Tax, the dissociation rate of CREB from a 21-bp repeat element is decreased. This stabilization is highly specific, requiring the amino-terminal region of CREB and appropriate 21-bp repeat sequences. We suggest that Tax stabilization of CREB binding to the viral promoter leads to an increase in gene expression, possibly providing the switch from latency to high level replication of the virus.

https://openalex.org/W2064464645,"Abstract Human replication protein A (RPA) is a three subunit protein complex involved in DNA replication, repair, and recombination. We investigated the role of the 34-kDa subunit (p34) of RPA in DNA replication by generating a series of p34 mutants. While deletion of the N-terminal domain of p34 prevented its phosphorylation by both cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) and DNA-dependent kinase, a double point mutant that lacks the major phosphorylation sites for Cdk could be phosphorylated by DNA-dependent kinase. In simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA replication, RPA containing either of these mutants functioned as efficiently as wild-type RPA. However, mutant RPA containing C-terminally deleted p34 was only marginally active. This indicates that the C-terminal region, but not the phosphorylation domain of p34, is necessary for RPA function in DNA replication. Furthermore, RPA containing the C-terminally deleted p34 mutant could stimulate DNA polymerase α, and bind to single-stranded DNAs but was limited in its ability to unwind DNA or interact with SV40 large T antigen (T Ag). These results suggest that RPA p34 interacts with SV40 T Ag during the initiation of SV40 DNA replication and may be necessary for DNA unwinding."

In mouse mammary tissue a subset of the Wnts have a function in the normal development of the gland, and abberant expression of Wnts normally silent in this tissue causes mammary carcinomas. We have previously shown that Wnt5a expression is elevated in the epithelial component of proliferative lesions of human breast and have therefore examined the regulation of Wnt5a mRNA expression in the human mammary epithelial cell line HB2, which has a luminal phenotype and thus represents the most commonly transformed cell type in human breast cancer. Wnt5a was up-regulated 30-fold at confluence. This up-regulation was induced specifically by confluence and not by the growth arrest that accompanied it. In addition, Wnt5a was down-regulated 3-fold by changes in cell shape associated with the transition from growth on a two-dimensional surface (flat cell morphology) to growth in three-dimensional gels (spherical cell morphology). Cytoskeletal disruption with non-toxic doses of colchicine also induced a spherical morphology and brought about a dose-dependent down-regulation of Wnt5a. Wnt5a was also down-regulated 10-fold during the hepatocyte growth factor-induced branching of HB2 cell aggregates in collagen gels. The down-regulation of Wnt5a preceded the branching process. A similar result was obtained with primary human breast epithelial populations and the breast cancer cell line MDA468. We conclude that regulation of Wnt5a expression is a downstream effect of signaling by hepatocyte growth factor. These results are consistent with a role for Wnt5a in mammary epithelial cell motility and are in accord with Xwnt5a's function in embryonal cell migration. If Wnt5a's function in human mammary epithelial cells is similar to that of Xwnt5a, its up-regulation at confluence may be a mechanism for inhibition of cell migration beyond confluence.

The Wnts are a large family of homologous but distinct genes, which have been highly conserved across species in evolution (1Sidow A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5098-5102Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The genes code for 45-kDa secreted cysteine-rich proteins. While soluble Wnt1 is present in the conditioned medium of Drosophila imaginal disc cells (2Vannleeuven F. Samos C.H. Nusse R. Nature. 1994; 368: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), the proteins are generally tightly associated with the cell surface (3Smolich B.D. McMahon J.A. McMahon A.P. Papkoff J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1267-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The Wnts are present in the embryonic and adult tissues of many species where their importance in morphological development and cell fate (4Nusse R. Varmus H.E. Cell. 1992; 69: 1073-1087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar) is reflected by the severity of the abnormalities (5Rijsewijk F. Schuermann M. Wagenaar E. Parren P. Weigel D.

Interest in the role of Wnts in breast tissue stems from studies in the mouse. The development of the murine mammary gland is associated with differential regulation of some of the Wnts (9Gavin B.J. McMahon A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2418-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 10Weberhall S.J. Phippard D.J. Niemeyer C.C. Dale T.C. Differentiation. 1994; 57: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and aberrant expression of those Wnts which are normally absent in the gland produces mammary hyperplasia and carcinomas (11Nusse R. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vitro, the murine mammary epithelial cell line C57MG is transformed by Wnts 1, 2, 3a, 5b, 7a, and 7b but not by Wnts 5a and 4 (12Wong G.T. Gavin B.J. McMahon A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6278-6286Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In addition, a subset of the Wnts are expressed in human breast, and quantitative differences exist in the Wnt expression profiles of normal mammary tissue and proliferative lesions of the breast (13Huguet E.L. McMahon J.A. McMahon A.P. Bicknell R. Harris A.L. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2615-2621PubMed Google Scholar). These data implicate Wnt genes in the biology of human breast tissue and possibly in human breast pathology. In keeping with this, we have shown that Wnt5a is up-regulated 10- and 4-fold in benign and malignant human breast lesions, respectively, and that the overexpression of the gene is localized to the mammary epithelium (14Lejeune S. Huguet E.L. Hanby A. Poulsom R. Harris A.L. Clin. Can. Res. 1995; 1: 215-222PubMed Google Scholar). Despite our and others' observation of differential expression of Wnts in human and murine systems respectively, the factors that control Wnt gene expression are poorly understood. We have therefore investigated what factors regulate Wnt5a gene expression in a human mammary epithelial cell line (HB2) (15Berdichevski F. Alford D. D'Souza B. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. J. Cell. Sci. 1994; 107: 3557-3568PubMed Google Scholar). This cell line has a luminal phenotype and thus represents the most commonly transformed cell type in human ductal breast cancer. Wnt5a mRNA expression was also investigated in primary human breast epithelial cells in order to assess the suitability of the HB2 cell line as a model of primary cell populations. All laboratory reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Mycoplasma-free HB2 cells (a subclone of the MTSV1-7 line (15Berdichevski F. Alford D. D'Souza B. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. J. Cell. Sci. 1994; 107: 3557-3568PubMed Google Scholar) obtained from Dr. Joyce Taylor-Papadimitriou, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, Lincoln's Inn Fields) were grown on Beckton-Dickinson tissue culture plates, in RPMI medium (Clare hall Laboratories, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, United Kingdom) with 10% fetal calf serum (Globepharm), 10 μg/ml bovine insulin, and 5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, in a 95% air, 5% carbon dioxide atmosphere, at 37°C. Collagen matrix (Vitrogen-100, Celtrix) was prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. Matrigel was from Beckton-Dickinson. Fibrin matrix was prepared by polymerization of fibrinogen (3 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) with thrombin (2 units/ml final concentration). When using the above matrices as growth substrates, HB2 cells were grown either as a monolayer on a matrix-coated tissue culture plate or in three-dimensional matrix gels. The medium of cells growing on or in fibrin and of control cells was supplemented with ϵ-aminocaproic acid (300 mg/ml) to prevent fibrinolysis. Matrices were digested before RNA extraction as follows: collagen gels were digested with 1 mg/ml collagenase (crude type1a) in phosphate-buffered saline, matrigel was digested with 50 units/ml dispase (Collaborative Biomedical Products), and fibrin was digested with plasminogen. In all experiments, cells grown on plastic were subjected to the same digestion as those grown on or in a matrix. In the experiments investigating the effect of colchicine on Wnt5a expression, subconfluent HB2 cells were exposed for 24 h to medium containing colchicine at 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.5 μg/ml. Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion. HB2 cells were synchronized using the method of the double thymidine block described by Johnson et al.(16Johnson R.T. Downes C.S. Meyn R.E. Fantes P. Brooks R. The Cell Cycle: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1993: 1-24Google Scholar). After synchronization cells were harvested at 4 h time points over 24 h. At each time point, cells were aliquoted into two fractions. One fraction was used for FACS1( 1The abbreviations used are: FACSfluorescence-activated cell sortingGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseHGFhepatocyte growth factor.) analysis, while RNA was prepared from the remaining cells. fluorescence-activated cell sorting glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase hepatocyte growth factor. To examine cell branching, cells were seeded into two separate three-dimensional collagen gels (104 cells/ml of gel) and grown with daily medium changes for 1 week to form spheres. The following week, cells in the control gel were fed control medium (RPMI, 10% fetal calf serum, insulin, and hydrocortisone), while cells in the experimental gel were fed with either MRC5-conditioned RPMI (obtained from Clare Hall Laboratories) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, insulin, and hydrocortisone, or with control medium supplemented with recombinant HGF at a final concentration of 10 ng/ml (obtained from R&, UK). MRC5 cells (17Holliday R. Tarrant G.M. Nature. 1972; 238: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) were obtained from the European Culture Collection. In experiments investigating the effects of confluence and growth arrest on Wnt5a expression, HB2 cells were grown under conditions which achieved growth arrest either by supplement deprivation or by allowing the cells to reach confluence. Thus, four plates containing equal numbers of subconfluent HB2 cells were prepared (105 cells/dish) and grown for 2 days with daily medium changes. For the following 48 h, cells in plate 1 were fed only RPMI, while those in plates 2-4 were fed RPMI with fetal calf serum, insulin, and hydrocortisone. RNA was harvested from the cells in plates 1 and 2 at the end of the 48-h period, when both sets of cells were still subconfluent. The cells in plates 3 and 4 were grown to confluence. At confluence, cells in plate 3 were fed only RPMI for a period of 48 h, while those in plate 4 continued to be fed their full medium. RNA was harvested from plates 3 and 4 at the end this 48-h period. Antisense [α-32P]CTP- (Amersham) labeled transcripts of Wnt5a were generated from a 384-base pair fragment of the gene cloned in the plasmid bluescript KS (Stratagene) (14Lejeune S. Huguet E.L. Hanby A. Poulsom R. Harris A.L. Clin. Can. Res. 1995; 1: 215-222PubMed Google Scholar). A construct containing a 180-base pair fragment of the gene glyceraldehyde-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cloned in the plasmid pBluescript KS+ was used to generate antisense GAPDH transcripts (18McCarthy S. Bicknell R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21617-21622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RNase protection assays were performed as described by Ausubel et al.(19Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Green Publishing Associates and Wiley Interscience, New York1991Google Scholar). In all assays the GAPDH signal was used as a loading control. HB2 cells were seeded either onto plastic culture dishes or in three-dimensional collagen gels. Cells seeded on plastic formed a dense monolayer (Fig. 1, a1) while those in collagen formed spheres (Fig. 1, a2) which branched when exposed to MRC5-conditioned medium (Fig. 1, a3). Wnt gene expression was studied under these different growth conditions. Wnts 2, 3, 3a, 4, and 7a were not expressed in this cell line whether cells were grown on plastic or in collagen in the presence of MRC5-conditioned medium (Fig. 1c), but Wnt5a and Wnt7b were detected. Wnt7b message was constant under all conditions (Fig. 1b). In contrast, Wnt5a was differentially expressed under the different growth conditions: Wnt5a message was highest in cells on plastic (Fig. 1, b lane 1) but showed a primary 10-fold down-regulation in cells in collagen (Fig. 1, b, lane 2), and a secondary 10-fold down-regulation associated with sphere branching (Fig. 1, b, lane 3). The primary and secondary down-regulations of Wnt5a expression in this system were further investigated to identify the regulatory factors. To examine whether the down-regulation of Wnt5a was brought about by the presence of collagen, cells were grown either 1) on plastic, 2) on a surface of collagen, or 3) in three-dimensional collagen gels. Fig. 2a shows that cells on plastic (lane 1) and on collagen (lane 2) have equal levels of Wnt5a and that Wnt5a is down-regulated only in cells seeded in three-dimensional collagen gels (lane 3). Similar experiments were repeated using matrigel and fibrin as different matrices. In each case the result shown in Fig. 2a for collagen was duplicated: Wnt5a expression is equal in cells grown on plastic and ona matrix, but is down-regulated in cells grown ina matrix (data not shown). We next investigated whether the down-regulation of Wnt5a was dependent on cell-cell interactions within the spheres. HB2 cells were seeded on plastic, on collagen, and in collagen, and RNA harvested 24 h later, i.e. before sphere formation. Fig. 2b shows that the down-regulation of Wnt5a is apparent at 24 h after seeding (Fig. 2b, compare lanes 1 and 2 to lane 3), confirming that regulation of the gene is not dependent on sphere formation. The appearance of HB2 cells on plastic or on a matrix is different from that of cells in a three-dimensional matrix. When growing in two dimensions the cells have a flattened morphology, whereas they are rounded in three dimensions. It was possible that the down-regulation of Wnt5a seen in the transition from two dimensions to three dimensions may be related to cell shape changes during the transition from a flattened to a rounded morphology. Thus, we examined whether a cytoskeletal-disrupting drug, colchicine, might reproduce the down-regulation of Wnt5a in monolayers of cells. On exposure to colchicine the cells rounded up, acquiring a morphology similar to that of cells in collagen. Concurrent with this change in morphology we observed a dose-dependent down-regulation of Wnt5a in response to colchicine (Fig. 3, a and b). Trypan blue exclusion confirmed that the cellular morphological change and down-regulation of Wnt5a occurred at nontoxic concentrations of colchicine. Because colchicine arrests cells in mitosis, it was unclear whether the down-regulation of Wnt5a was related to cell cycle events, or to the disrupting effects of colchicine on the cytoskeleton. To investigate this, HB2 cells were synchronized by double thymidine block and the expression of Wnt5a analyzed at defined time points after release from cell cycle control. Despite synchronization of the cells as confirmed by FACS analysis, no regulation of Wnt5a could be demonstrated as the cells subsequently cycled (data not shown). In experiments comparing Wnt5a expression in cells on plastic to that in cells in collagen, we observed that in the time taken for sphere formation in collagen, cells seeded on plastic had grown to confluence (Fig. 1, a1). Thus it was uncertain whether the down-regulation of Wnt5a in the transition from growth on plastic to growth in collagen was related to the change from confluence to subconfluence, or to the transition from two-dimensional growth to three-dimensional growth. We investigated these two factors individually and found that Wnt5a was regulated independently by both confluence and the transition from two-dimensional to three-dimensional growth. To investigate the effect of confluence alone on Wnt5a expression, HB2 cells were seeded on plastic and RNA harvested either before or after they reached confluence. Fig. 4 shows that confluent cells (lane 1) express a higher level of Wnt5a than subconfluent cells (lane 3). It was uncertain from this result whether Wnt5a was regulated by confluence or proliferation since densely grown cells are not only confluent, but also growth-arrested. To determine whether Wnt5a up-regulation in dense cells was related either to confluence or quiescence, Wnt5a expression on plastic was compared in the following four conditions: 1) confluent HB2 s in full medium (cells were confluent and quiescent); 2) confluent HB2s starved for 48 h of fetal calf serum, hydrocortisone, and insulin (cells were confluent and quiescent and provided a control for the effect of serum, insulin, and hydrocortisone deprivation also found in condition 4); 3) subconfluent HB2s in full medium (cells were subconfluent and proliferating); and 4) subconfluent HB2s starved for 48 h of fetal calf serum, insulin, and hydrocortisone (cells were subconfluent and quiescent). Growth curves (Fig. 4c) demonstrated that serum, insulin, and hydrocortisone deprivation for 48 h induced HB2 quiescence (without killing them) and that HB2 cells did undergo growth arrest at confluence. Of the above, condition 4 determines whether Wnt5a expression is controlled by confluence or by quiescence. If confluence up-regulates Wnt5a, then subconfluent growth arrested cells in condition 4 should express low levels of Wnt5a. However, if quiescence up-regulates Wnt5a, these cells should express high levels of Wnt5a. Fig. 4, a and b, shows that confluent quiescent cells (lane 2) express 30-fold higher levels of Wnt5a than subconfluent quiescent cells (lane 4). This shows that confluence, rather than quiescence, is the major up-regulating factor of Wnt5a. To further investigate the effect of the transition from growth in two dimensions to three dimensions independently of confluence, HB2 cells were seeded either on plastic, on collagen, or in collagen, and RNA harvested after 24 h when cells were still subconfluent. Fig. 2b shows that in conditions under which the effect of confluence is abolished in this way, a 2-3-fold down-regulation of Wnt5a is still observed. To further demonstrate the two independent regulating factors, we investigated whether they might act in an additive fashion. Wnt5a expression was compared in the following three conditions: 1) HB2s grown to confluence on collagen; 2) subconfluent HB2s on collagen; and 3) HB2s grown in collagen. Fig. 5 shows that Wnt5a is elevated in confluent cells on collagen (lane 1) and low in subconfluent cells on collagen (lane 2). However, in comparison to subconfluent cells on collagen (lane 2), cells in collagen (lane 3) express still lower levels of Wnt5a. Thus, in the absence of the effect of confluence, a down-regulation of Wnt5a was demonstrated during the transition from two-dimensional to three-dimensional growth. Upon exposure to MRC5-conditioned medium, the spherical HB2 cell aggregates branch (Fig. 1, a3). Branching occurs approximately 48 h after exposure to the conditioned medium. In association with this branching, Wnt5a is down-regulated 10-fold (Fig. 1b). Fig. 6a shows that Wnt5a down-regulation occurred within 12 h of exposure to MRC5-conditioned medium, and therefore preceded the branching process. Hepatocyte growth factor is present in the medium of MRC5 cells, and recombinant hepatocyte growth factor reproduced both branching and the down-regulation of Wnt5a (Fig. 6b). Thus, Wnt5a is downstream of hepatocyte growth factor. The branching assay was repeated using both primary human mammary luminal and myoepithelial cells (supplied by Dr M. O'Hare, Ludwig Institute, University College London, London, UK) and a breast carcinoma cell line (MDA468). Like the HB2 cell line, spheres of MDA468 and primary human mammary epithelial cells branch under the influence of MRC5-conditioned medium, and the branching is associated with down-regulation of Wnt5a. The branching structures formed by the MDA468 were less well defined than those formed by the primary epithelial cells and the HB2 cells. The magnitude of the Wnt5a down-regulation appeared to correlate with the degree of branching. Thus, the Wnt5a down-regulation observed in the HB2 cells (10-fold) was similar to that seen in the primary luminal epithelial cells (6-fold) (Fig. 6c), but greater than that seen in the MDA468 cells (approximately 3-fold. Fig. 6d). The same RNA samples showed that Wnt7b expression was constant in both the primary human mamary epithelial cells and the MDA468 cells (Fig. 6, c and d, respectively). When seeded in a three-dimensional gel, HB2 cells initially form a single cell suspension within the matrix but then give rise to expanding spheres as the cells start to divide. The observation that Wnt5a is expressed at a similar level when HB2 cells are cultured on plastic or on a matrix, but that it is down-regulated when the cells are cultured in the matrix suggest that the important regulating factor is the transition from two dimensions to three dimensions, rather than the presence or absence of a matrix component. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the result is reproducible with different matrices. The down-regulation of Wnt5a in the transition from two to three dimensions is observed if RNA is harvested before spheres have formed, when the HB2 s are still a single cell suspension. Thus the effect is produced in individual cells and is independent of cell to cell contacts inherent in sphere formation. The transition from two to three dimensions is associated with a change in cellular morphology, in that cells grown in two dimensions have a flatened morphology, whereas those grown in three-dimensional gels are rounded. The down-regulation of Wnt5a in the transition from two to three dimensions may be related to cell shape changes since altering cell shape with the microtubule-disrupting drug colchicine reproduces the down-regulation of Wnt5a. The influence of cell shape on gene regulation is a well recognized phenomenon (for a review, see Ref. 20Ben-Ze'ev A. Bioessays. 1991; 13: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), which has been demonstrated in many cell types (21Spiegelman B.M. Ginty C.A.

Closest to our model is the work of Streuli and Bissel (24Streuli C.H. Bissell M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1405-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) with mouse mammary epithelial cells. Streuli and Bissel observe that murine mammary epithelial cells cultured on plastic or on a layer of collagen have a flattened morphology and fail to express milk proteins. Altering the physical properties of the gel produces cell shape changes associated with differentiation and secretion of milk proteins. Furthermore, Roskelley at al. (25Roskelley C.D. Desprez P.Y.

Furthermore, cytoskeletal elements other than microtubules may be disrupted to produce similar effects.

Chem. 1987; 262: 5366-5376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported gene regulation in synovial fibroblasts, limb mesenchymal cells, and granulosa cells, respectively. The mechanisms of cytoskeletal gene regulation are only partially understood. It is known that the cytoskeleton interacts with elements of 2° messenger pathways. These interactions control 2° messenger function firstly by altering the activity of some of its proteins (32Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Macheski L.M. Baldassare J.J. Pollard T.D. Science. 1990; 247: 1575-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 33Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van de Geer P.

Adv. Cancer Res. 1990; 55: 271-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The cytoskeleton may also influence gene expression by similar interactions with transcription factors (35Gilmore T.D. Cell. 1990; 62: 841-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and mRNA species (36Yisraeli J.K. Sokol S. Melton D.A. Development. 1990; 108: 289-298PubMed Google Scholar). In endothelium many genes regulated by shear stress are known (37Malek A.M. Izumo S. J. Hyperten. 1994; 12: 989-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and putative shear response elements have been identified in the 5′-flanking regions of these genes. One such sequence, GAGACC (38Resnick N. Collins T. Atkinson W. Bonthron D.T. Dewey C.F.J. Gimbrone M.A.J. Proc Natl Acad Sci U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4591-4595Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), is present in the 5′ region of Wnt5a published by Clark et al.(39Clark C.C. Cohen I. Eichstetter I. Cannizzaro L.A. McPherson J.D. Wasmuth J.J. Iozzo R.V. Genomics. 1993; 18: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and it is possible that this sequence may contribute to Wnt5a regulation by mechanophysical events. Our results show that Wnt5a is up-regulated 30-fold when HB2 cells reach confluence. Cell surface molecules known to be up-regulated by cell confluence are few, but include DEP-1 (40Ostman A. Yang Q. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9680-9684Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and CD31 (52Fawcett J. Molecular Aspects of Angiogenesis and Metastasis, Ph.D. thesis, University of Oxford. 1994; Google Scholar). The function of Wnt5a up-regulation at confluence is unclear, but studies in Xenopus suggest a role in cell motility control. Moon et al.(41Moon R.T. Campbell R.M. Christian J.L. McGrew L.L. Shih J. Fraser S. Development. 1993; 119: 97-111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that overexpression of Wnt5a abolishes the migrational properties of Xenopus embryonal blastula cap cells. Thus, if Wnt5a has a similar function in human cells, its elevation at confluence may represent a mechanism of inhibiting migration beyond confluence by decreasing cell motility. The molecules which mediate contact controlled migration in normal breast tissue and contact inhibition in vitro are unknown, but the Wnts may be a candidate group as they are cell surface molecules involved in the control of cell proliferation and morphological development. The mechanism by which Xwnt5a decreases cell motility in Xenopus is not understood, but circumstantial evidence suggests that modulation of cell adhesion molecules may be involved. First, exogenous overexpression of N-cadherin in Xenopus blastula cap cells produces a phenotype identical to that engendered by Xwnt5a overexpression (42Detrik R.J. Dickey D. Kintner C.R. Neuron. 1990; 4: 493-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Second, the signaling pathway of Drosophila Wnt1 is known to involve both the cadherins and catenins (43Bradley R.S. Cowin P. Brown A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1857-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). However, it should not be assumed that Wnt5a will have the same signaling pathway as Wingless since Wnt5a and Wnt1 fall into two different subgroups on the basis of their transforming ability (Wnt1 is transforming, Wnt5a is not (12Wong G.T. Gavin B.J. McMahon A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6278-6286Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar)) and their effect on gap junctions (Wnt1 enhances gap junctional permeability (44Olson D.J. Moon R.T. Dev. Biol. 1992; 151: 204-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), Wnt5a does not (45Moon R.T. Demarais A. Olson D.J. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 17: 183-188Crossref Google Scholar)) Hepatocyte growth factor induces both mitogenic and cell motility responses in many cell types including HB2 (see below). The HGF-induced branching of HB2 spheres in collagen gels probably represents at least in part a cell motility response, since proliferation alone would lead to more rapidly expanding spheres rather than branching structures. The fact that Wnt5a is down-regulated in association with cell motility during branching is, again, consistent with the work of Moon in Xenopus. Taken together, Moon's findings and ours suggest a general function for Wnt5a in the control of cell movements: motility is decreased by elevated levels of Xwnt5a, and conversely in this system, low levels of Wnt5a are observed during cell migration. In the HB2 system, however, the correlation between Wnt5a down-regulation and cell motility events does not prove that the former induces the latter. Our findings place human Wnt5a downstream of hepatocyte growth factor signaling and suggest one link in the mechanism of cell motility control by this growth factor. Hepatocyte growth factor (or scatter factor) is a 82-kDa disulfide-linked heterodimeric protein, which acts via a 180-kDa receptor tyrosine kinase encoded by the proto-oncogene c-met. Although HGF was originally isolated as a hepatotropic factor, it is now clear that HGF and c-met have much wider roles in the development of a variety of embryonic and adult tissues (46Furlong R.A. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 613-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The mitogenic and cell motility promoting functions of HGF are exemplified in numerous in vitro systems (47Montesano R. Schaller G. Orci L. Cell. 1991; 66: 697-711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 48Morimoto A. Okamura K. Hamanaka R. Sato Y. Shima N. Higashio K. Kuwano M. Biochem. Biophys.

Science. 1992; 257: 1258-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The HGF-c-met axis also has oncogenic potential since NIH3T3 cells co-expressing HGF and c-met are transformed and tumorigenic (50Rong S. Bodescof M. Blair D. Dunn J. Nakamura T. Mizuno K. Park M. Chan N. Aaronson N. Vande-Wonde G.F. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 5152-5158Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In relation to human breast cancer, Yamashita et al.(51Yamashita J. Ogawa M. Yamashita S. Nomura K. Kuramoto M. Saishoji T. Shin S. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1630-1633PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that the expression of HGF in breast carcinomas correlates with poor prognosis. Although the association between HGF expression and poor prognosis has not yet been shown to be causal, HGF may produce a more malignant phenotype in part by increasing cellular motility and invasiveness. Berdichevsky et al. (15Berdichevski F. Alford D. D'Souza B. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. J. Cell. Sci. 1994; 107: 3557-3568PubMed Google Scholar) showed in HB2 cells that HGF down-regulated α2β1 integrin raising the possibility that Wnt5a also interacts with this system of cell adhesion. We have previously shown that the epithelia of benign and malignant human breast lesions express, respectively, 10- and 4-fold higher levels of Wnt5a than does that of normal breast tissue (14Lejeune S. Huguet E.L. Hanby A. Poulsom R. Harris A.L. Clin. Can. Res. 1995; 1: 215-222PubMed Google Scholar). This expression profile of Wnt5a may be explained in different ways. The higher level of Wnt5a observed in both benign and malignant proliferative lesions may be brought about by the increased cell density within these lesions, in a manner similar to the effect of confluence in vitro. The fact that malignant tumors have lower levels of Wnt5a than the benign lesions may be related to the production of factors that decrease Wnt5a expression, such as hepatocyte growth factor. Also, it is known from studies in the mouse that Wnt5a is differentially regulated during morphological development of the mammary gland (9Gavin B.J. McMahon A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2418-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). If similar regulation occurs in the human, it is possible that the levels of Wnt5a seen in abnormally differentiated lesions could occur if their constituent cells were arrested in a particular state of differentiation associated with elevated Wnt5a. In summary, our results show that in human mammary epithelial cells, Wnt5a is regulated by cell shape, by confluence, and by hepatocyte growth factor. These results have implications for the role of Wnt genes in mammary epithelial cell biology. We thank Dr. Joyce Taylor-Papadimitriou for giving us the HB2 cell line, Dr. Michael O'Hare for supplying primary human mammary epithelial cells, and Dr. Trevor Dale for useful discussions during this study."

Cell. 1988; 52: 635-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). EBV persists in lymphoid cells, such as the Raji cell line derived from an African Burkitt's lymphoma, in a tightly latent state as a circular plasmid in multiple copies (Adams and Lindahl, 1975Adams A. Lindahl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 1477-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar; Lindahl et al., 1976Lindahl T. Adams A. Bjursell G. Bornkamm G.W. Kaschka-Dierich C. Jehn U.

Like cellular chromosomes, each viral plasmid is replicated once per cell cycle in the early synthesis (S) phase (Adams, 1987Adams A. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 1743-1746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Gussander and Adams, 1984Gussander E. Adams A. J. Virol. 1984; 52: 549-556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Hampar et al., 1974Hampar B.

Virol. 1991; 65: 483-488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The replication of EBV-derived plasmids is dependent on oriP, the viral protein EBNA1, and on a set of mostly unknown cellular proteins (Lupton and Levine, 1985Lupton S. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell.

OriP consists of two sequence elements, the family of repeat element (FR) and the dyad symmetry element (DS), separated by a stretch of about 960 base pairs of unique DNA dispensable for ori function (Lupton and Levine, 1985Lupton S. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2533-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar; Reisman et al., 1985Reisman D. Yates J. Sugden B. Mol. Cell.

DS contains four EBNA1 binding sites and a region of dyad symmetry encompassing EBNA1 binding sites four and three (Hsieh et al., 1993Hsieh D.-J. Camiolo S.M. Yates J.L.

Since initiation of DNA replication from oriP is a strictly regulated and dynamic event, we asked if there are variations in the proteins associated with the initiator element of oriP in vivo before and after S phase. Therefore, we decided to examine the state of in vivo protein-DNA interactions at the initiator element of oriP in synchronously before and after S phase growth-arrested Raji cells. Methylation protected and sensitive nucleotides were visualized using the technique of ligation mediated polymerase chain reaction (LMPCR) (Mueller and Wold, 1989Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). The exact physical initiation points or areas of EBV plasmid replication are not yet known at nucleotide resolution. Therefore, we decided to use the same method to visualize 5′-ends of viral DNA within the initiator element of oriP.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESTissue CultureRaji cells were maintained in suspension cultures of RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 50 units of penicillin/ml, and 50 μg of streptomycin/ml under 5% CO2 and 37°C.Flow Cytometric AnalysisFor flow cytometric analysis cells were harvested, fixed with 70% methanol for at least 1 h, resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Saluz and Jost, 1990Saluz H.P.

A. 1992; 89: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar with some modifications. The following sets of oligonucleotides i, ii, and iii for the LMPCR assay of both strands were used, 5′ to 3′: lower strand (i) 8927-GGTTCACTACCCTCGTGGAATCCTG-8951, (ii) 8931-CACTACCCTCGTGGAATCCTGACCC-8955, (iii) 8969-CCGTGACAGCTCATGGGGTGGGAGATATC-8997; upper strand (i) 9229-GGCTACACCAACGTCAATCAGAGGG-9205, (ii) 9205-GGCCTGTGTAGCTACCGATAAGCGG-9181, (iii) 9195-GCTACCGATAAGCGGACCCTCAAGAGG-9169. The first strand primer extension reaction was done in 10 mM KCl, 10 mM (NH4)2SO4, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 2 mM MgSO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 8.8, 25°C (Vent buffer, New England Biolabs), containing 0.3 pmol of primer i, 240 μM each dNTP, and 1 unit of Vent (exo-) DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) for 5 min at 94°C, 30 min at 60°C, and 10 min at 72°C. For ligation of the common linker, the sample was transferred to ice and 5 μl of PCR linker mixture as in Mueller and Wold, 1989Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 2 μl of ligation buffer (660 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithioerythritol, 10 mM ATP, pH 7.5, 20°C, Boehringer Mannheim), 1 μl of T4 DNA-ligase (5 units/μl, Boehringer Mannheim), and 12 μl of water were added. After an overnight incubation at 4°C the DNA was ethanol precipitated, washed once with 75% ethanol, dried, and then resuspended in water. The PCR amplification was done in 100 μl of Vent buffer containing 10 pmol each of primer ii and the longer linker primer, 240 μM each dNTP, and 3 units of Vent (exo-) DNA polymerase for 20 cycles using 1 min at 94°C, 1.5 min at 60°C, and 3 min at 72°C. For labeling, the sample was transferred to ice, 5 pmol of T4 kinase [γ-32P]ATP labeled primer iii, 2.5 nmol each dNTP, and 0.5 units of Vent (exo-) DNA polymerase in a volume of Vent buffer not exceeding 15 μl were added. Then the sample was heated to 94°C for 1.5 min, subjected to 5 cycles of 2 min at 94°C, 2 min at 62°C, and 5 min at 72°C, and kept at 72°C for 5 more minutes. Samples were transferred to ice, phenol/chloroform extracted, ethanol precipitated, and resuspended in loading dye. One-fifth of each sample was separated on a standard 6% sequencing gel (Sambrook et al., 1989Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and the gels were dried and autoradiographed for 15 h at room temperature with Kodak X-Omat LS film.Visualization of 5′-EndsGenomic DNA was harvested from unsynchronized Raji cells, and from Raji cells treated with 30 μM aphidicolin for up to 24 h (Saluz and Jost, 1990Saluz H.P. Jost J.P. A Laboratory Guide for in Vivo Studies of DNA Methylation and Protein/DNA Interactions. Birkhäuser, Basel1990Crossref Google Scholar). 5′-Ends of DNA were visualized by LMPCR on 2 μg of genomic DNA using the same reaction conditions and primer sets as for the in vivo footprints.RESULTSSynchronous Growth Arrest of Raji CellsInitial efforts were focussed on the synchronization of Raji cells. The cells used in our experiments were growing fast, having a doubling time of about 24 h under standard cell culture conditions. For the purpose of arresting cells before and after S phase, we used the drugs mimosine and colchicine, respectively. Colchicine arrests mitotic cells in the metaphase by blocking the spindle apparatus for the separation of the chromosomes (Inoué, 1981Inoué S. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 131s-147sCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mimosine, a plant amino acid, has the potential to reversibly block the mammalian cell cycle close to the G1/S boundary (Lalande, 1990Lalande M. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 186: 332-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The cell cycle block by mimosine may be due to the inhibition of initiation of DNA replication (Mosca et al., 1992Mosca P.J. Dijkwel P.A. Hamlin J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4375-4383Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Drugs were added to exponentially growing cells. The flow cytometric analysis of untreated, propidium iodide-stained cells showed a relatively high DNA synthesis rate and a relatively large fraction of the cells in G2/M (Fig. 1A). 14 h later, when the cells were harvested for the footprints, a control sample analyzed by flow cytometry showed essentially the same pattern (Fig. 1b). Cells treated with 400 μM mimosine or with 1 μM colchicine for 14 h, respectively, showed a rather different distribution over the cell cycle (Fig. 1, C and D). In the mimosine-treated sample, S phase cells and G2/M cells were strongly depleted and a large majority of the cells were in G1 (Fig. 1C). In the colchicine-treated sample, G1 cells and S phase cells were strongly depleted and the vast majority of the cells were in G2/M (Fig. 1D). These two cell cycle arrests seemed sufficiently quantitative for our intended studies of protein-DNA interactions at DS of oriP before and after S phase.EBNA1 Binding to DS Throughout the Cell CycleCells treated with mimosine and colchicine were harvested and genomic DMS footprints on the initiator element (DS) of oriP of EBV were performed (Fig. 2). The footprinting was done on both strands of DS according to standard methods (Garrity and Wold, 1992Garrity P.A. Wold B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar; Maxam and Gilbert, 1980Maxam A.M. Gilbert W.

The pattern of guanines protected from methylation and nucleotides hypersensitive to methylation is summarized in Fig. 4. The footprint patterns for mimosine-treated cells and colchicine-treated cells were similar, in general, and consistent with the concept of EBNA1 binding to its four in vitro binding sites (Rawlins et al., 1985Rawlins D.R. Milman G. Hayward S.D. Hayward G.S. Cell. 1985; 42: 859-868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) within DS also in vivo (Hsieh et al., 1993Hsieh D.-J. Camiolo S.M. Yates J.L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4933-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Nuclear proteins other than EBNA1 might also cause the in vivo footprints on the EBNA1 binding sites at some phase of the cell cycle (Oh et al., 1991Oh S.-J. Chittenden T. Levine A.J. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 514-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Wen et al., 1990Wen L.-T. Lai P.K. Bradley G. Tanaka A. Nonoyama M. Virology. 1990; 178: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However, since the footprints spanning the EBNA1 binding sites of DS were the same in mimosine- and colchicine-treated cells and also in nontreated, exponentially growing cells (data not shown), we concluded that EBNA1 binding to DS is unchanged throughout the cell cycle (Hsieh et al., 1993Hsieh D.-J. Camiolo S.M. Yates J.L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4933-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Since EBNA1 binds on only one face of the double helix within DS (Frappier and O'Donnell, 1992Frappier L. O'Donnell M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1786-1790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Kimball et al., 1989Kimball A.S. Milman G. Tullius T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2738-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), the protections of guanines 9037, 9044, 9065, and 9119 are not readily explained solely by the binding of EBNA1. These protections may be caused by structural alterations of the DNA induced by the binding of EBNA1 (Frappier and O'Donnell, 1992Frappier L. O'Donnell M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1786-1790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or also by the presence of nuclear proteins other than EBNA1 in the nucleoprotein complexes on DS (Oh et al., 1991Oh S.-J. Chittenden T. Levine A.J. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 514-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Wen et al., 1990Wen L.-T. Lai P.K. Bradley G. Tanaka A. Nonoyama M.

Camiolo S.M. Yates J.L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4933-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and this data. First, there was a guanine instead of an adenine at position 9062 in oriP of our Raji cells, that was methylation protected. This transitional point mutation is unlikely to have any effects on the function of oriP (Ambinder et al., 1990Ambinder R.F. Shah W.A. Rawlins D.R. Hayward G.S. Hayward S.D. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2369-2379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, the adenine at position 9051 was strongly DMS reactive. This difference may be due to variations in technical procedures. The methylation sensitive adenine at 9051 has also been observed in in vitro methylation studies on the distortion of oriP by EBNA1 (Frappier and O'Donnell, 1992Frappier L. O'Donnell M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1786-1790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Third, and more important, we observed a novel pattern of DMS reactivity within DS that was not reported by the earlier paper (Hsieh et al., 1993Hsieh D.-J. Camiolo S.M. Yates J.L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4933-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This discrepancy may be explained by variations in technical procedures or also by differences between Raji cells that have been passaged for many years.Cell Cycle DependenceThe novel pattern was observed in nonsynchronized cells (data not shown) in a way similar to mimosine-treated cells. However, the pattern was different between mimosine- and colchicine-treated cells. The pattern was found at each nonamer, 5′-TTAGGGTTA-3′, repeated three times within DS. The nonamers are located at 9021 to 9029 (A), 9073 to 9081 (B) and 9127 to 9135 (C), each location being outside of the EBNA1 sites. Nonamer A points to one direction, nonamers B and C point to the other direction. The first guanine of each nonamer was protected stronger in mimosine than in colchicine-treated cells. The third guanine each was slightly stronger methylation sensitive in mimosine- than in colchicine-treated cells. These differences in the footprint patterns between mimosine- and colchicine-treated cells most likely reflect the differential interaction of the nonamer with nuclear protein or, alternatively, a more general change of the nucleoprotein complex on DS. An earlier experimental hint for protein binding to the nonamer sequence came from in vitro footprints on DS. Nuclear proteins from HeLa cells yielded distinct DNase I protected areas within DS that spanned the nonamers (Oh et al., 1991Oh S.-J. Chittenden T. Levine A.J. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 514-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, distinct nucleoprotein complexes on DS probably exist in Raji cells in vivo.DNA 5′-Ends at the NonamersIn order to correlate more the protein binding data at DS with initiation function, we tried to locate the initiation points of DNA replication within DS at nucleotide resolution. Therefore, we performed LMPCR on purified genomic DNA from untreated Raji cells to visualize DNA 5′-ends. Exponentially growing Raji cells were harvested, genomic DNA was purified, and LMPCR was performed using the same sets of primers as for the genomic footprints. On the lower strand 5′-ends were found mainly at nonamers B and C, on the upper strand mainly at nonamers A and B (Fig. 3, lanes N). The pattern of 5′-ends at the nonamers in untreated DNA is also summarized in Fig. 4. In addition to 5′-ends at the nonamers, 5′-ends were also found upstream of nonamer C for the lower strand (horizontal arrow above C in Fig. 3a) and upstream of nonamer A for the upper strand (two horizontal arrows above A in Fig. 3b) These upstream 5′-ends are less abundant than 5′-ends at the nonamers. They occur at pyrimidine-rich stretches of the respective strands. Since aphidicolin blocks DNA chain elongation (Huberman, 1981Huberman J.A. Cell. 1981; 23: 647-648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), we did the same experiment on genomic DNA from Raji cells treated with aphidicolin. In this experiment the signal for 5′-ends at the nonamers increased strongly in a time dependent fashion (Fig. 3, lanes 24) (only data for 24 h shown). In addition to this strong signal increase at the nonamers, there was also an increased background and an increased abundance of 5′-ends downstream of nonamer C on the upper strand (nicked arrow below nucleotide 9118 in Fig. 3b). These 5′-ends cannot be readily explained by some mechanism, but they may correspond to damaged DNA, resulting from the prolonged treatment of cells with aphidicolin. The increased background of lanes 24 may also result from DNA damage.Figure 3:Visualization of 5′-ends on both strands of DS in genomic DNA from Raji cells by LMPCR.

We have now demonstrated that a second SSE-like element in the 5′-untranslated region of the γ-gene also contributes to this competitive silencing of the β-gene. Utilizing transient transfection assays in the fetal erythroid cell line, K562, we have shown that the core enhancer of hypersensitivity site 2 can preferentially interact with the proximal γ-promoter in the absence of the SSE, completely silencing a linked β-promoter. Mutation of a 20-base pair sequence of the γ-gene 5′-untranslated region (UTR) led to derepression of β-promoter activity. A marked activation of γ-promoter activity was also observed with this mutation, suggesting the presence of a repressor. Fine mutagenesis dissected these activities to different regions of the 5′-UTR. The stage selector activity was localized to a region centered on nucleotides +13 to +15. Electromobility shift assays utilizing this sequence demonstrated binding of a fetal and erythroid-specific protein. The repressor activity of the 5′-UTR was localized to tandem GATA-like sites, which appear to bind a complex of two proteins, one of which is the erythroid transcription factor GATA-1.

https://openalex.org/W1501220712,"Abstract The rod substructures of the Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 phycobilisome contain the light harvesting proteins C-phycocyanin and phycoerythrocyanin (PEC). Even at low light intensities, PEC represents no more than 5% of the phycobilisome protein. The β subunits of both proteins carry thioether-linked phycocyanobilin (PCB) at β-Cys-82 and β-Cys-155; however, C-phycocyanin has PCB at α-Cys-84 whereas PEC α subunit carries phycobiliviolin at this position. The Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 pec operon is made up of five genes. PecB and pecA encode the β and α subunits of PEC, pecC encodes a linker polypeptide associated with PEC in the rod substructure, and pecE and pecF are genes of unknown function that show a high degree of homology to cpcE and cpcF, that encode a C-phycocyanin α subunit PCB lyase (Fairchild, C. D., Zhao, J., Zhou, J., Colson, S. E., Bryant, D. A., and Glazer, A. N.(1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 89, 7017-7021). Insertional mutants in pecE and pecF, and an interposon mutant in which a portion of both pecE and pecF was deleted, were constructed. All three types of mutants grew 1.3 times slower than wild-type under limiting light conditions and showed a 20% reduction in the PCB content of whole cells relative to chlorophyll a. Holo-PEC was missing from the phycobilisomes of all three types of mutants and the level of the PEC linker polypeptide was reduced relative to the wild-type. However, ∼30% of the wild-type level of the PEC β subunit was present in all of these phycobilisomes. In contrast, the PEC α subunit was barely detectable in the pecE and pecF mutants, but was present in the pecEF deletion mutant as a PCB-adduct in a 1:1 ratio with the PEC β subunit. The identity of this “unnatural” adduct was confirmed by isolation of the subunit and amino-terminal sequencing. These biochemical results support the inference that pecE and pecF encode a PEC α subunit phycobiliviolin lyase, and, in conjunction with earlier findings, demonstrate that phycobiliprotein bilin lyases show high selectivity (rather than absolute specificity) for both the bilin and the polypeptide substrate."

The sequences of the mRNA analogues were described earlier (Stade, K., Rinke-Appel, J., and Brimacombe, R.(1989) Nucleic Acids Res. 17, 9889-9908; Rinke-Appel, J., Stade, K., and Brimacombe, R.(1991) EMBO J. 10, 2195-2202). Under equilibrium conditions, both of these mRNA analogues bind and cross-link to 70 S ribosomes without the presence of tRNAThr; however, there are significant increases both in binding and particularly in cross-linking in the presence of the tRNAThr. Four regions contain cross-linking sites that increase in the presence of tRNA, C1395, A532, A1196 (and minor sites around these three positions), and C1533/U1532. Three other cross-linking sites, U723, A845, and U1381, show very little change in extent of cross-linking when tRNA is present. A conformational change in the 30 S subunit allowing additional accessibility to the 16 S rRNA by the mRNA analogues upon tRNA binding best explains the behavior of the tRNA-dependent and tRNA-independent mRNA-16 S rRNA cross-linking sites. The interaction between mRNA and Escherichia coli ribosomes has been studied by photochemical cross-linking using mRNA analogues that contain 4-thiouridine (s4U) or s4U modified with azidophenylacyl bromide (APAB), either two nucleotides upstream or eight nucleotides downstream from the nucleotide sequence ACC, the codon for tRNAThr. The sequences of the mRNA analogues were described earlier (Stade, K., Rinke-Appel, J., and Brimacombe, R.(1989) Nucleic Acids Res. 17, 9889-9908; Rinke-Appel, J., Stade, K., and Brimacombe, R.(1991) EMBO J. 10, 2195-2202). Under equilibrium conditions, both of these mRNA analogues bind and cross-link to 70 S ribosomes without the presence of tRNAThr; however, there are significant increases both in binding and particularly in cross-linking in the presence of the tRNAThr. Four regions contain cross-linking sites that increase in the presence of tRNA, C1395, A532, A1196 (and minor sites around these three positions), and C1533/U1532. Three other cross-linking sites, U723, A845, and U1381, show very little change in extent of cross-linking when tRNA is present. A conformational change in the 30 S subunit allowing additional accessibility to the 16 S rRNA by the mRNA analogues upon tRNA binding best explains the behavior of the tRNA-dependent and tRNA-independent mRNA-16 S rRNA cross-linking sites. Photoaffinity experiments with suitably derivatized mRNA and tRNA substrates offer an attractive strategy to determine the location and properties of the functional sites on the Escherichia coli ribosome. Photo and photochemical cross-links have been made to the ribosome from the acceptor end (1Barta A. Steiner G. Brosius J. Noller H.F. Kuechler E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochimie (Paris). 1992; 74: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The general location of the mRNA track has also been elucidated by photoaffinity experiments (7Cooperman B.S.

These experiments are consistent with an mRNA track extending around the middle part of the 30 S subunit, with the sites for the codon-anticodon interactions determined by the 30 S subunit and with the aminoacyl ends of the tRNAs extending toward the peptidyltransferase center of the 50 S subunit (see Refs. 2Wower J.

Cross-links to four sites in the 16 S rRNA have been reported: A532, C1395 (and residues G1392 and A1398 in its close vicinity), U1052, and the 3′-terminal region. Several specific correspondences between the location of the photoreactive moiety in the mRNA analogue and the position of cross-linking in the 16 S rRNA have been drawn. If the numbering of positions in the mRNA analogue are made from “+1” being the first nucleotide of the triplet used in the P-site, these are +6 in the mRNA to U1052 in the 16 S rRNA, +7 in the mRNA to C1395 in the 16 S rRNA, and +11 in the mRNA to A532 in the 16 S rRNA (15Dontsova O. Kopylov A. Brimacombe R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2613-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In subsequent reports using additional mRNA analogues, cross-links were detected from +4 in the mRNA to nucleotides in the interval 1402-1415 in the 16 S rRNA, from +6 to +10 in the mRNA to C1395 in the 16 S rRNA, and from +10 to +13 in the mRNA to A532 in the 16 S rRNA (14Rinke-Appel J. Junke N. Brimacombe R. Dokudovskaya S. Dontsova O. Bogdanov A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2853-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These cross-links were strongly tRNA-dependent; in all experiments, complexes of 70 S ribosomes, mRNA, and tRNA were isolated by sedimentation or gel filtration to ensure that the most stable complexes were examined. 4-thiouridine azidophenylacyl bromide [(N-acryloylamino)phenyl]mercuric chloride double-stranded DNA nucleotide(s) 89 mM Tris, 89 mM boric acid, 10 mM EDTA. We reported experiments that used RNA analogues 51 nt in length with clusters of s4U in different areas from −20 to +26 from the first nucleotide of the codon (17Bhangu R. Juzumiene D. Wollenzien P. Biochemistry. 1993; 33: 3063-3070Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These experiments were done by forming complexes between 70 S ribosomes and mRNA analogues without or with cognate tRNA and irradiating these complexes without further purification. Ten cross-links between the mRNA analogues and 16 S rRNA were detected by primer extension assay. With the mRNA analogues that were used, only two of the sites (C1395 and A1196) showed strong tRNA dependence and the site A532 showed a weaker tRNA dependence on cross-linking for some of the mRNA analogues. The behavior of this set of mRNA analogues led us to question why there was not tRNA dependence for a larger number of the rRNA sites. In the present experiments, the pattern of cross-linking made by mRNA analogues with single s4U residues and the response of the sites with respect to tRNA binding has been investigated. mRNA analogues with s4U either at position −2 or +11 (12Stade K. Rinke-Appel J. Brimacombe R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9889-9908Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 13Rinke-Appel J. Junke N. Stade K. Brimacombe R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2195-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) were used because these were shown to exhibit strong tRNA dependence in binding and cross-linking. Under equilibrium binding conditions, the pattern of cross-linking can be separated into tRNA-dependent and tRNA-independent classes. A proposal for a conformation change in the 30 S subunit upon tRNA binding is made to explain the behavior of the mRNA analogues with the tRNA-dependent 16 S rRNA cross-linking sites. dsDNA for in vitro transcription was prepared with Taq DNA polymerase. Single-stranded DNA template containing the T7 promoter sequence and the sequence for the mRNA analogue were synthesized, and only left (5′) primers were used since both molecules contain redundant sequences at their 3′ ends. dsDNA was purified on nondenaturing 8% polyacrylamide gels. In vitro transcription of RNA was done with RiboMax protocols described by Promega and included 1 mM GMP for partial substitution of GMP for GTP at the 5′ end. In vitro transcription of RNA containing s4U was done with 0.25 mM s4UTP (18Tanner N.K. Hanna M.M. Abelson J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8852-8861Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and 3 mM concentration each of GTP, ATP, and CTP. 32P-Labeled RNA was made by including 20 μCi of [α-32P]GTP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham) in a reaction that had 0.5 mM cold GTP. Usual yields were 40-60 μg of RNA/100 μl transcription. Transcription mixtures were purified on Qiagen tips, and RNA was checked on 8% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea gels. When unlabeled RNA was transcribed, 50 pmol was used in exchange reaction with [γ-32P]ATP (19Bhangu R. Wollenzien P.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5937-5944Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). RNAs containing s4U were used for APAB reaction as described (12Stade K. Rinke-Appel J. Brimacombe R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9889-9908Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). APAB-substituted mRNAs were checked on 8% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea gels containing 0.003% APM (20Igloi G.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3842-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) in which s4U-containing RNA is retarded, but s4U-containing RNA substituted with APAB migrates at the same position as RNA with uridine. Complexes between activated 70 S ribosomes and mRNA analogues were made in 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mM KCl, and 10 mM MgCl2(21Katunin V.I. Semenkov Yu.P. Makhno V.I. Kirillov S.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 403-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). 10 pmol of 70 S ribosomes in 100 μl were incubated for 30 min at 37°C with a 5-fold molar excess of mRNA analogue without or with a 5-fold molar excess of tRNAThr. mRNA binding was determined by nitrocellulose filter binding as described (17Bhangu R. Juzumiene D. Wollenzien P. Biochemistry. 1993; 33: 3063-3070Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The extent of tRNA binding was determined by footprinting reactions (22Stern S. Moazed D. Noller H.F. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 23Moazed D. Noller H.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 21: 135-145Crossref Scopus (250) Google Scholar) comparing the degree of protection conferred by tRNAThr to that conferred by a known amount of binding of tRNAPhe (directed by poly(U)). Cross-linking was carried out for 10 min at 4°C in an irradiator producing 320-365 nm light (24Isaacs S.T. Shen C.J. Hearst J.E. Rapoport H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1058-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Irradiated samples were digested with proteinase K, phenol-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and redissolved in water. Samples were denatured with formamide before electrophoresis on agarose gels. Primer extension analysis of the mRNA-rRNA cross-links using reverse transcriptase and 10 DNA oligonucleotide primers was done as described previously (17Bhangu R. Juzumiene D. Wollenzien P. Biochemistry. 1993; 33: 3063-3070Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 25Wollenzien P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Reverse transcripts were analyzed on 8% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea gels. To determine the extent of cross-linking to 32P-labeled mRNA at the 3′ end of 16 S RNA, 16 S-sized RNA was purified on 1% agarose gels before use for RNase H reactions. The oligomer UACTCCUUUGG, complementary to 1426-1437, consisting of 2′-methyl ribonucleosides and deoxynucleotides (underlined) was used to cleave after position 1435 (26Inoue H. Hayase Y. Iwai S. Ohtsuka E. FEBS Lett. 1987; 215: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Reactions contained 40 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 4 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.003% bovine serum albumin, 4% glycerol, 1 μg of 16 S rRNA, and 50 pmol of oligomer in 6 μl. Reactions were done by incubating the mixture for 2 min at 55°C, slowly cooling to 37°C, and then adding 2.5 units of RNase H (Fermentas) and incubating for 10 min at 37°C. After phenol extraction and precipitation, RNA was electrophoresed on composite 4%-12% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea gels. For sequencing, the 3′ ends of cross-linked and control 16 S rRNA were labeled with [5′-32P]pCp and T4 RNA ligase (27England T.E. Bruce A.G. Uhlenbeck O.C. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) according to Krzyzosiak et al.(28Krzyzosiak W. Denman R. Nurse K. Hellmann W. Boublik M. Gehrke C.W. Agris P.F. Ofengand J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2353-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). RNase H was used to remove the label from the mRNA with additional DNA oligonucleotides complementary to the mRNA. Partial alkaline hydrolysis was done in 50 mM NaCO3, pH 9.0, 1 mM EDTA in the presence of 0.25 μg/μl tRNA and 3′-labeled 16 S RNA fragment (0.1 μg) in 6 μl for 10 min at 90°C, then 4.3 mg of urea were added, and samples were electrophoresed on 8% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea gels. For sequencing, samples were digested with RNase T1 and RNase U2(29Donis-Keller H. Maxam A. Gilbert W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1977; 4: 2527-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). The sequences of the two mRNA analogues used in this study are shown in Table I. The stoichiometries of binding to ribosomes under the conditions used for cross-linking were determined by nitrocellulose filter binding and are summarized in Table II. In all cases, more than one mRNA binds per ribosome at saturation. Binding isotherms were examined to estimate dissociation constants assuming independent sites. For the mRNA analogue with s4U at position −2 with respect to the sequence ACC (designated s4U(−2)), KD values of 86 nM (for both sites) without tRNAThr and 19 nM and 77 nM with tRNAThr were determined. For the mRNA analogue with s4U at position +11 (designated s4U(+11)), KD values of 104 nM and 178 nM without and 28 nM and 93 nM with tRNAThr were determined. To test if the presence of the two types of mRNA binding sites reflected ribosome heterogeneity, tRNA binding was measured at an mRNA analogue concentration that resulted in an average of 1 mRNA analogue/ribosome. tRNA binding was found to be at least 0.85 tRNA/ribosome, all confined to the P-site (results not shown). Thus, all ribosomes contain a strong binding site for these mRNA analogues.Table I:Sequences of the mRNA analogues s4U(−2) and s4U(+11) Open table in a new tab Table II:Stoichiometry of binding mRNA s4U(−2) and s4U(+11) to 70 S ribosomes without and with cognate tRNA Open table in a new tab Complexes of ribosomes and s4U-containing mRNA or s4U-containing mRNA derivatized with APAB were irradiated with 320-365 nm wavelength light. Complexes with mRNA analogues containing uridine were irradiated as control samples. Electrophoresis of purified RNA from these samples revealed that mRNA becomes extensively cross-linked to 16 S rRNA with smaller cross-linking to 23 S rRNA (Fig. 1 and Table III). The presence of tRNA increases cross-linking from 3- to nearly 5-fold in 16 S rRNA for both the(−2) and (+11) mRNA analogues. Cross-linking to 23 S rRNA is independent of the presence of tRNA. Binding and cross-linking of s4U-containing mRNA analogues can be competed by uridine-containing mRNA analogues (results not shown).Table III:Extent of cross-linking mRNA analogues s4U(−2) and s4U(+11) to 70 S ribosomes without and with tRNAThr Open table in a new tab Reverse transcription experiments were done to determine the location of the mRNA cross-links in the 16 S rRNA. The mRNA analogue s4U(+11) cross-links in the interval 1389 to 1393 to C1395 (the predominant site) and to C1397 (Fig. 2). The frequencies of all of these increase significantly when tRNA is present as measured as the ratio of the band intensity in the cross-linked sample over that in the control sample (Table IV). When s4U(+11)-APAB is used in the cross-linking reaction, C1395 and C1397 are still present as prominent cross-linking sites and there is a new site at A1398. The presence of tRNA slightly decreases the extent of cross-linking by s4U(+11)-APAB, except at A1398 where there is a large increase. For mRNA analogue s4U(−2), one cross-linking site at U1381 is seen in this region, and this does not change significantly in extent when tRNA is present (Fig. 2 and Table IV). Reactions with the mRNA analogue s4U(−2)-APAB show lower amounts of cross-linking at U1381, presumably because the azidophenylacyl moiety interferes with the mRNA-rRNA interaction at this site, and the appearance of a new cross-link at U1378. Because the stoichiometry of the mRNA binding exceeded 1 mol/mol 70 S, the experiments were also done with lower mRNA input levels; this reduces the amount of covalent cross-linking but does not change the pattern (results not shown).Table IV:Summary of the 16 S rRNA cross-linking sites and relative extent of cross-linking Open table in a new tab mRNA analogue s4U(+11) cross-links to sites in the 16 S rRNA at A532 and U531 with lower intensity sites at A535, U534, and A533 (Fig. 3). All of these show increases when tRNA is present. Cross-linking in this region is somewhat greater with mRNA analogue s4U(+11)-APAB but, in this case, increases in cross-linking upon tRNA addition are smaller. Three additional regions around A845, U723, and A1196 contain cross-linking sites (Fig. 4). The sites A845 and U723 occur with mRNA analogue s4U(−2) and s4U(−2)-APAB. All of these show little change in extent when tRNA is present. Finally, a cross-linking site at A1196 occurs in mRNA analogue s4U(+11) (Fig. 4C). This site shows the same behavior with respect to tRNA dependence as the sites at C1389-A1398 and around A532. With mRNA analogue s4U(+11)-APAB, three additional sites C1195, U1194, and G1193 are also seen and these also increase when tRNA is present. The experiments involving mRNA s4U(−2) have also been performed by isolating stable complexes by sedimentation before cross-linking. This decreases the amount of mRNA bound to the 70 S ribosomes particularly in the absence of tRNA as described before (13Rinke-Appel J. Junke N. Stade K. Brimacombe R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2195-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, it was still possible to detect all cross-links including the tRNA independent sites (U1381, A845, and U723) without tRNA although there are much lower levels of cross-linking in those complexes, reflecting the lower levels of bound mRNA in the absence of tRNA (data not shown). The terminal 30 nucleotides of the 16 S rRNA cannot be examined by reverse transcription because of m26A at positions 1518 and A1519. Since Rinke-Appel et al.(13Rinke-Appel J. Junke N. Stade K. Brimacombe R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2195-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) reported cross-linking to this region with mRNA analogue s4U(−2), levels of cross-linking were determined using RNase H cleavage with an oligonucleotide complementary to 1426-1437. If the 16 S rRNA were cross-linked to 32P-labeled mRNA, a fragment longer than expected would be released and it would be radioactive. This is the case and levels of cross-linking were determined from an autoradiogram of a polyacrylamide gel (results not shown). Cross-linking in the terminal 107 nt occurred only with mRNA analogue s4U(−2); in cross-linking reactions without tRNA, the extent was 4%, and, in reactions with tRNA, the extent was 39% (Table I). RNA sequencing was done to determine the cross-linking site. After cross-linking to nonradioactive s4U(−2) and purification of 16 S-sized RNA, RNA was 3′-end-labeled. RNase H cleavage at position 1435 of 16 S-sized RNA from cross-linking reactions releases two prominent products, one of which has the same gel mobility as the 16 S rRNA terminal 107 nt, and the other has a significantly slower mobility (Fig. 5, lane 5). When an oligonucleotide complementary to the mRNA was included in the RNase H digestion to reduce the size of the mRNA and remove its 3′ end label, the slower product increases in mobility but still is different from the terminal 107 nt of the 16 S rRNA (Fig. 5, lane 6). The control fragment containing the terminal 107 nt and the fragment containing the cross-linked RNA were isolated and subjected to partial hydrolysis and RNase T1 and RNase U2 digestion to find the site of the cross-link. In this comparison, the cross-linked sample and control sample should show the same pattern up to the last nucleotide before the cross-linking site. The patterns are very similar to position C1533 and then the pattern in the cross-linked sample contains a gap (Fig. 6). The intensity of the partial hydrolysis product at C1533 is significantly less than expected indicating a cross-link at C1533 and the band expected at U1532 is completely absent. Given the sequence of the residual mRNA fragment still attached to the terminal 107 nt of the 16 S rRNA, the patterns of partial RNase T1 and RNase U2 digestion are consistent with the assignment. Densitometry was done to estimate the amount of cross-linking at each of these sites (Table IV). The location of these and the other cross-linking sites are indicated in the 16 S rRNA secondary structure in Fig. 7.Figure 6:Partial hydrolysis reaction on the 3′-terminal region of 16 S rRNA to determine the point of mRNA cross-linking. The control RNA fragment and RNA fragment containing the mRNA cross-link were subjected to partial hydrolysis (H+), partial digestion with RNase T1 (T1), or RNase U2 (U2) as indicated. The band that corresponds to the fragment whose 5′-nucleotide is C1533 is indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 7:Location of mRNA cross-linking sites in the 16 S rRNA secondary structure (49Gutell R.R.

The mRNA cross-linking sites that change in frequency by more than 50% in the presence of tRNA are shown by solid dots, and those that are independent of tRNA are indicated by open dots.

Rinke-Appel J. Brimacombe R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9889-9908Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and Rinke-Appel et al.(13Rinke-Appel J. Junke N. Stade K. Brimacombe R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2195-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) for cross-linking by these two mRNA analogues to E. coli rRNA have been confirmed, including the strong tRNA dependence for cross-linking, cross-linking to C1395 and A532 by the mRNA analogue s4U(+11), and cross-linking to the 3′-terminal region by mRNA analogue s4U(−2). There are additional cross-linking sites in the neighborhoods of these prominent cross-links detected by reverse transcription (Table IV, Fig. 7). Subsequently, a cross-link at U1052 was reported from position +6 in another mRNA analogue (14Rinke-Appel J. Junke N. Brimacombe R. Dokudovskaya S. Dontsova O. Bogdanov A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2853-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We do not detect U1052 but instead detect A1196 (this report and Ref. 17Bhangu R. Juzumiene D. Wollenzien P. Biochemistry. 1993; 33: 3063-3070Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar) which is very close to U1052 in the secondary structure; these probably represent the same mRNA-16 S rRNA interaction region. Three cross-linking sites in the 16 S rRNA at U1381, U723, and A845 are also detected. All of these sites are made by mRNA analogue s4U(−2) and its APAB derivative and are nearly tRNA independent. These sites as well as the tRNA-dependent cross-linking sites have also been detected using other mRNA analogues (17Bhangu R. Juzumiene D. Wollenzien P. Biochemistry. 1993; 33: 3063-3070Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar) which were both longer and lower in purine base composition than the molecules s4U(−2) and s4U(+11). An apparent positional ambiguity of the mRNA analogues in the mRNA track was determined in our previous experiments due to the possibility of conformational flexibility in the 30 S subunit (17Bhangu R. Juzumiene D. Wollenzien P. Biochemistry. 1993; 33: 3063-3070Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The same phenomenon may occur with these two mRNA analogues; thus, although the mRNA analogue s4U(+11) makes cross-links with A1196, A532, and C1395, this does not necessarily mean these sites are direct neighbors of one another. An important consideration involves the strategy of performing these experiments. The Brimacombe and Brimacombe/Bogdanov groups used sedimentation or gel filtration to first purify mRNA⋅ribosome complexes before cross-linking, and this decreases the amount of bound mRNA particularly in those complexes formed without tRNA. In our case, ribosomes in equilibrium with unbound mRNA and tRNA typically were irradiated, allowing a larger extent of mRNA binding and cross-linking both with and without tRNA. This has allowed the recognition of both tRNA-dependent and tRNA-independent cross-linking sites. The dependence of mRNA binding on tRNA is consistent with the behavior of poly(U) and tRNAPhe under subsaturation conditions observed by Katunin et al.(21Katunin V.I. Semenkov Yu.P. Makhno V.I. Kirillov S.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 403-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Weller and Hill (30Weller J. Hill W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19369-19374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown recently that competition between oligo(U) and a DNA oligonucleotide complementary to 16 S rRNA interval 1396-1403 occurs only if tRNAPhe is present, again indicating a cooperativity between mRNA and tRNA binding. The location of the mRNA cross-linking sites in the 30 S subunit can be estimated from available structural information. The site A532 has been associated with protein S4 by a number of experiments (31Greur B. Osswald M. Brimacombe R. Stoeffler G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 3241-3255Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 32Stern S. Weiser B. Noller H.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 447-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 33Vartikar J.V. Draper D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and S4, in turn, has been located in the indentation between the head and body of the 30 S subunit on the side away from the platform region (34Capel M.S. Kjeldgaard M. Engelman D.M. Moore P.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 65-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Sites close to A1196 have been associated with protein S5 (see Ref. 35Ramakrishnan V. White S.W. Nature. 1992; 358: 768-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). S5 has been located in the middle of the subunit on the cytoplasmic side, close to S4 (34Capel M.S. Kjeldgaard M. Engelman D.M. Moore P.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 65-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The sites at U1390 to C1398 are in the vicinity of the codon-anticodon interaction in the cleft region evidenced by the anticodon-rRNA cross-link at C1400 in the 16 S rRNA (5Prince J.B. Taylor B.H. Thurlow D.L. Ofengand J. Zimmermann R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5450-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and the determination of this site by electron microscopy (36Gornicki P. Nurse K. Hellmann W. Boublik M. Ofengand J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10493-10498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, the site at C1533/U1532 is in the vicinity of the codon/anticodon interaction because of cross-links between this region and proteins S7, S18, and S21 (32Stern S. Weiser B. Noller H.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 447-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and the locations of these proteins (34Capel M.S. Kjeldgaard M. Engelman D.M. Moore P.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 65-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus, the four tRNA-dependent sites break down into two groups: the 532 and 1196 regions in the S4 subdomain and the 1395 and 1533 regions close to the P-site codon/anticodon interaction. There has been some differing information about the closeness of these two regions. On the one hand, a large distance between protein S4 and S7 has been determined by neutron scattering (34Capel M.S. Kjeldgaard M. Engelman D.M. Moore P.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 65-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and electron microscopy (37Stoeffler G. Stoeffler-Meilicke M. Hardesty B. Kramer G. Structure, Function and Genetics of Ribosomes. Springer-Verlag, New York1984: 28-46Google Scholar). On the other hand, there is evidence intimately linking the 530 region with the decoding process including evidence that tRNA in both the A-site and P-site produces footprints in the interval 529-532 (23Moazed D. Noller H.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 21: 135-145Crossref Scopus (250) Google Scholar), that nucleotide changes in the 523 to 530 region strongly affect translational proofreading and ribosome function (38Melancon P. Lemieux C. Brakier-Gingras L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9631-9639Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 39Gauthier A. Turmel M. Lemieux C. Mol. & Gen.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5539-5547Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and that the 530 region is involved in EF-Tu function (43Powers T. Noller H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, Alexander et al.(45Alexander R.W. Muralikrishna P. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12109-12118Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) have recently shown that protein S7 and the 3′-terminal region of the 16 S rRNA can be labeled by a photoaffinity probe annealed to the 16 S rRNA in the interval 518-526, indicating a distance of no greater than 24 Å between C526 and the 16 S terminal region and protein S7. The tRNA independent mRNA cross-linking sites can also be placed in approximate locations in the 30 S subunit. The cross-linking site U1381 is in the region associated with protein S7 (32Stern S. Weiser B. Noller H.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 447-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 46Dragon F. Brakier-Gingras L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1199-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) the location of which has been determined on the side of the head of the subunit facing the cleft region. The cross-linking sites U723 and A845 are in the rRNA regions associated with S6, S18, S15, and S8 (32Stern S. Weiser B. Noller H.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 447-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), and these have been located in the side of the body next to the decoding region (34Capel M.S. Kjeldgaard M. Engelman D.M. Moore P.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 65-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). There are large distances between S7 and the other group of proteins suggesting that this part of the mRNA track is quite wide. The properties of the tRNA-independent and tRNA-dependent cross-linking indicate a change in the 30 S mRNA analogue interaction upon tRNA binding. First, under the experimental conditions, mRNA binds with reasonable stoichiometry to 70 S ribosomes whether tRNA is present or not. However, there is a large increase in the amount of covalent cross-linking to the 16 S rRNA upon inclusion of tRNA, much larger than the binding stoichiometry differences. As an internal control, there is no significant difference in the amount of cross-linking to 23 S rRNA. Second, the mRNA bound to the 70 S ribosomes is bound in approximately the correct location without tRNA, and cross-links occur to all of the rRNA sites (see Table IV). The Shine-Dalgarno sequence homologies in the mRNA analogues probably are responsible for the correct alignment of the mRNA analogues in the ribosome. There are several ways to account for the large increase in cross-linking efficiency upon tRNA binding. One possibility would be an increase in mRNA flexibility upon tRNA binding since s4U cross-linking efficiency is greater at interactions that have structural mobility (47Lemaigre-Dubreuil Y. Expert-Bezancon A. Favre A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3653-3660Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), but this would be contrary to the increase in mRNA binding strength and the fact that the mRNA derivatized with APA behaves in a similar manner. Another possibility is that tRNA binding subtly alters the orientation of the mRNA analogue on the subunit. A specific change in the arrangement of s4U at −2 with respect to the U1532/C1533 site may occur because tRNA binding, together with the Shine-Dalgarno interaction, would constrain the mRNA. However, a constraint imposed by tRNA binding is unlikely to account for the behavior of s4U(+11) because of the distance between s4U at position +11 and the ACC codon. The last possibility is that there is a conformational change in the 30 S subunit upon tRNA binding that results in greater exposure of the reactive 16 S rRNA sites. This would account for the increase in cross-linking of s4U at position +11 as well as at position −2 and would also be consistent with the increase in mRNA binding strength, if there is an associated increase in favorable mRNA-30 S subunit interactions. Since the tRNA-dependent mRNA cross-links are located at the interface between the body and head of the 30 S subunit, some movement of the head of the 30 S subunit may be involved in this change to alter the accessibility of these rRNA sites. Huttenhofer and Noller (48Huttenhofer A. Noller H.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3892-3901Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) recently determined the protection of mRNA analogues on the 30 S subunit from hydroxyl radical cleavage and found that the protection increased from about 40 nt to 54 nt when tRNA was present. Their interpretation was that the codon-anticodon interaction influenced the mRNA pathway, particularly past position +6 from the codon. Their observation is also consistent with a tRNA-dependent strengthening and alteration in the mRNA-30 S subunit interaction indicated by the present cross-linking results.

The HER3/p180erbB3 receptor, another member of this family, has also been reported to be a receptor for HRGs (16Carraway III, K.L. Sliwkowski M.X. Akita R. Platko J.V. Guy P.M. Nuijens A.

However, it appears that HER2/p185erbB2 indirectly participates in HRG-mediated signaling through transphosphorylation or receptor heterodimerization with HER4 and/or HER3 (15Plowman G.D. Green J.M.

The biological effects of HRGs are mediated through receptors that possess an intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity and are autophosphorylated upon HRG binding (15Plowman G.D. Green J.M. Culouscou J.-M. Carlton G.W. Rothwell V.M. Buckley S. Nature. 1993; 366: 473-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Studies on receptor tyrosine kinases such as the epidermal growth factor receptor, the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and the insulin receptor have demonstrated a crucial role for receptor autophosphorylation in intracellular signal transduction following ligand binding (18Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4619) Google Scholar, 19White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that specific autophosphorylation sites on receptor tyrosine kinases serve as recognition structures for target molecules containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains. SH2 domains are conserved noncatalytic sequences of ~100 amino acids found in various signaling molecules and oncogenic proteins (20Koch C.A. Anderson D. Moran M.F. Ellis C. Pawson T. Science. 1991; 252: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar, 21Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J.

SH2 domain-containing proteins bind with high affinity to phosphotyrosine residues in the context of specific flanking amino acids. For example, the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase, the p21ras GTPase-activating protein, and phospholipase C-γ have been shown to contain SH2 domains. More recently, SH2 domain-containing proteins that lack an apparent catalytic domain and that seem to function as adaptors linking proteins involved in signal transduction have been described (22-27). One of them, Shc, was identified and cloned based on its homology to SH2 sequences from the human c-fes gene (23Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Grignani F. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 93-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). The Shc cDNA is predicted to encode two proteins of 46 and 52 kDa that contain a single C-terminal SH2 domain and a collagen homologous region that is rich in glycine and proline. No catalytic domain was identified in Shc. Anti-Shc antibodies have been shown to recognize three proteins of 46, 52, and 66 kDa in a wide range of mammalian cells. A variety of growth factors and cytokines have been shown to induce the phosphorylation of Shc proteins (28Pronk G.J. McGlade J. Pelicci G. Pawson T. Bos J.L. J. Biol.

Furthermore, overexpression of Shc proteins is associated with a transformed phenotype in fibroblasts (23Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Grignani F.

The recombinant fusion proteins generated, referred to as rHRGs-T-Fc, were used either as chimeric proteins or as EGF-like domains (reHRGs) after thrombin cleavage and removal of the Fc portion of the molecule. Herein, we demonstrate that recombinant HRGs, in either form, bind to and activate the HER4 receptor and show that the Shc proteins are tyrosine-phosphorylated following HRG stimulation. RC20 recombinant anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Transduction Laboratories) and PY20 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (ICN Biomedicals, Inc.) were used in Western blotting studies. Polyclonal anti-Shc antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., and the monoclonal anti-Shc antibody was from Transduction Laboratories. BBA 3, an anti-human ICAM-1 monoclonal antibody, was from R& Systems. MDA-MB-453 human breast cancer cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. CHO/EGFR cells were generated by Dr. B. Thorne (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Seattle, WA) as follows. The complete recombinant human EGF receptor coding sequence was inserted into a CDM8 expression vector containing the neomycin resistance gene. The resulting construct was transfected into CHO-K1 cells. G418-resistant clones were analyzed for EGFR expression. Levels of expression of functional EGFR in CHO/EGFR stable cells were assessed by stimulating the cells with EGF, immunoprecipitating the EGFR, and determining its phosphorylation level by phosphotyrosine Western blotting as reported (13Plowman G.D.

CHO/HER4 cells expressing high levels of recombinant human HER4 have previously been described (13Plowman G.D. Culouscou J.-M. Whitney G.S. Green J.M. Carlton G.W. Foy L. Neubauer M.G. Shoyab M.

DNA fragments encoding part of the spacer domain of human HRGs, the EGF-like domains, the transmembrane domain, and a few residues of the cytoplasmic domain were amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from total RNA isolated from HepG2 cells. The oligonucleotide primers were designed based on the sequence of human HRG-β (1Holmes W.E. Sliwkowski M.X. Akita R.W. Henzel W.J. Lee J. Park J.W. Yansura D. Abadi N. Raab H. Lewis G.D. Shepard H.M. Kuang W.-J. Wood W.I. Goeddel D.V. Vandlen R.L. Science. 1992; 256: 1205-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). The PCR primers used were 5′-GTGTCTTCAGAGTCTCCCATTAGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTTGGTTTTGCAGTAGGCCAC-3′ (reverse). Amplification was performed with Taq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) using 35 cycles, with each cycle being composed of a denaturing step for 1 min at 95°C, an annealing step for 1 min at 65°C, and an extension step for 30 s at 72°C. The PCR products were blunt-ended using the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I and subcloned into an SmaI-digested pBluescript II vector (Stratagene), and the nucleotide sequences of individual clones were determined by the dideoxy-mediated chain termination reaction. The EGF-like domains of HRG-α, -β2, and -β3 were generated by PCR using HRG-α or -β2 template plasmids generated as described above. The oligonucleotide primers described below were designed to place an SpeI site at the 5′-end and a BamHI site at the 3′-end of the amplified products for cloning purposes. The epidermal growth factor-like domain of human HRG-α was amplified using the following primers: 5′-GAGACTAGTAGCCATCTTGTAAAATGTGCG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCGTGGATCCTTCTGGTACAGCTCCTCCGC-3′ (reverse). PCR conditions consisted of 40 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 1 min at 55°C, and 2 min at 72°C using Pfu polymerase and reagents recommended by the vendor (Stratagene). The PCR product encoded complementary sequences corresponding to residues 177-241 of HRG-α. The epidermal growth factor-like domains of human HRG-β2 and -β3 were amplified using an HRG-β2 clone as a template. The forward primer was described above. The HRG-β2 reverse primer had the sequence 5′-CCGTGGATCCTTCTGGTACAGCTCCTCCGCCTT-3′. Amplification was performed with Pfu polymerase using the same temperature program as that used for HRG-α. This PCR product encoded sequences corresponding to residues 177-238 of HRG-β2. The HRG-β3 reverse primer contained a silent point mutation introducing a HindIII site for diagnostic purposes and had the following sequence: 5′-CCGTGGATCCTCAGGCAAGCTTAGAAAGGGAGTGGACGTACTGTAGAAGC-TGGCCATTAC-3′. PCR conditions consisted of 40 cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 2 min at 50°C, and 3 min at 72°C using Pfu polymerase. The PCR product encoded sequences corresponding to residues 177-241 of HRG-β3. All PCR products were digested with BamHI and SpeI and ligated to a BamHI-SpeI-cut CDM7-derived vector containing cDNA sequences coding for the CD5 signal peptide 5′ of the cloning site for proper secretion of the expressed proteins as well as cDNA sequences encoding a thrombin cleavage site (amino acid sequence: DPGGGGGRLVPRGFGTG) and cDNA sequences encoding the hinge and constant regions of a human IgG1 3′ of the cloning site.2( 2A. Aruffo and D. Hollenbaugh, unpublished data.) All constructs were sequenced by the dideoxy-mediated chain termination reaction to confirm the sequence of the EGF-like domains as well as to verify that their sequences were in frame with the thrombin and Fc coding sequences. Constructs were transfected into COS cells as described previously (35Seed B. Aruffo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 87: 3365-3369Crossref Scopus (789) Google Scholar), and the resulting fusion proteins were recovered from culture supernatants using protein A-Sepharose (Repligen). Purified proteins were visualized on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing and nonreducing conditions. Protein concentrations were determined using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Fusion proteins were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with human thrombin (Sigma) at a 1:50 (w/w) thrombin/fusion protein ratio. Cleaved proteins were then loaded on a protein A-Sepharose column. Column flow-through fractions containing the recombinant EGF-like domains of HRGs were stored at −20°C until further use. CHO/HER4 cells (5 × 104), CHO/EGFR cells (2 × 104), and MDA-MB-453 cells (4 × 105) were seeded in 48-well plates. 24 h later, cells were serum-starved for 8 h and then stimulated with various samples for 10 min at 37°C. Supernatants were discarded, and cells were lysed by adding boiling electrophoresis sample buffer. Lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 8% polyacrylamide gels (Novex) and then electroblotted onto nitrocellulose. PY20 monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab')2 (Cappel) were used as primary and secondary probing reagents, respectively. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.). CHO/HER4 cells were seeded in 100-mm dishes. 80-90% confluent monolayers were washed and incubated with various recombinant HRGs for 10 min at 37°C. Monolayers were washed with ice-cold PBS and solubilized for 10 min on ice in PBSTDS lysis buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM Na3VO4, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20 μg/ml pepstatin. The protein concentrations of the clarified extracts were determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce). Lysates (1 mg/immunoprecipitation) were incubated overnight at 4°C with a rabbit anti-Shc antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Immune complexes were precipitated by adding protein G Plus-/protein A-agarose (Oncogene Science Inc.) to the suspensions. After 1 h of incubation at 4°C, the immunoprecipitates were washed three times with PBSTDS lysis buffer and then resolved on 8% polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions. Proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose and probed with RC20 recombinant anti-phosphotyrosine antibody or a monoclonal anti-Shc antibody. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence. MDA-MB-453 cells were plated on 8-well borosilicate-chambered slides (Lab-Tek, Nunc). For receptor binding visualization, after a 48-h culture period, the cells were placed on ice for 10 min, washed twice with ice-cold binding buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 44 mM sodium bicarbonate, 50 mM Bes, pH 7.0, 0.1% bovine serum albumin), and then incubated on ice for 2 h with rHRG-α-T-Fc or, as a negative control, an irrelevant fusion protein consisting of the extracellular domain of the Tek receptor (36Dumont D.J. Gradwohl G.J. Fong G.-H. Auerbach R. Breiman M.L. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1293-1301PubMed Google Scholar) fused to the thrombin cleavage site followed by the Fc region of an IgG1, as in rHRGs-T-Fc.3( 3J.-M. Culouscou, unpublished data.) The reagents, cloning vector, and mammalian cells used to construct and to generate the Tek-Fc fusion protein were identical to the ones used to make rHRGs-T-Fc. The cells were washed twice and incubated for 45 min on ice with a fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-human IgG F(ab‘)2 fragment (Tago, Inc.). The cells were rinsed twice with PBS and fixed for 20 min in PBS, 2% formaldehyde. For ICAM-1 expression studies, after a 24-h culture period, the cells were incubated for 3 days with 50 ng/ml rHRG-α-T-Fc, p45 (14Culouscou J.-M. Plowman G.D. Carlton G.W. Green J.M. Shoyab M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18407-18410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Tek-Fc fusion protein as a negative control, or culture medium alone. Staining was then performed on live cells. The cells were washed and incubated for 1 h on ice with an anti-ICAM-1 antibody diluted 1:500 in binding buffer. The cells were washed and incubated for 45 min on ice with a fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab‘)2 fragment (Tago, Inc.). The cells were rinsed and fixed as described above. The levels of receptor staining and ICAM-1 expression were analyzed using a Leica confocal microscope. Our objective was to generate versatile recombinant HRGs to study various aspects of the biology of the HER4/HRG receptor/ligand pair. Because the EGF-like domain of HRG-β1 had previously been shown to be sufficient for receptor binding (1Holmes W.E. Sliwkowski M.X. Akita R.W. Henzel W.J. Lee J. Park J.W. Yansura D. Abadi N. Raab H. Lewis G.D. Shepard H.M. Kuang W.-J. Wood W.I. Goeddel D.V. Vandlen R.L. Science. 1992; 256: 1205-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar), we constructed three chimeric genes that encode soluble proteins consisting of the EGF-like domain of HRG-α, -β2, or -β3 linked to a thrombin cleavage site followed by the hinge, CH2, and CH3 regions of a human IgG1 antibody, with secretion of the proteins directed by the signal sequence of CD5 (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The EGF-like domain of HRG-α corresponded to residues 177-241 of the mature protein, while those of HRG-β2 and -β3 corresponded to residues 177-238 and residues 177-241, respectively. The three fusion proteins (rHRGs-T-Fc) were prepared by transient expression in COS cells, purified from culture supernatants on protein A-Sepharose, and gave yields in the range of 350-1900 μg/liter. The CD5 signal peptide allowed efficient processing and secretion of rHRGs-T-Fc. All three fusion proteins were secreted as disulfide-linked homodimers similar to immunoglobulins and therefore were each capable of presenting two HRG EGF-like domains. To establish that rHRGs-T-Fc were able to bind and to activate the HER4 receptor, we examined their potential to induce the phosphorylation of HER4 as well as morphological changes and up-regulation of ICAM-1 expression. For these experiments, we used CHO/HER4 cells, which express high levels of recombinant human HER4/p180erbB4 and have previously been shown to respond to HRG (13Plowman G.D. Culouscou J.-M. Whitney G.S. Green J.M. Carlton G.W. Foy L. Neubauer M.G. Shoyab M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1746-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar, 14Culouscou J.-M. Plowman G.D. Carlton G.W. Green J.M. Shoyab M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18407-18410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). rHRG-α-T-Fc, -β2-T-Fc, and -β3-T-Fc were added to CHO/HER4 cells at 50 and 200 ng/ml for 10 min at 37°C. Cells were lysed, and then the pattern of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins was analyzed by anti-phosphotyrosine Western blotting as compared with untreated cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, all three rHRGs-T-Fc induced the hyperphosphorylation of the HER4 receptor. Ligand activation not only resulted in receptor autophosphorylation, but also in the tyrosine phosphorylation of several substrates, including an Mr 100,000 band, yet to be identified (Fig. 1A). When tested on CHO/EGFR cells, which express high levels of recombinant human EGFR, rHRGs-T-Fc (200 ng/ml) failed to activate the EGFR (Fig. 1B). As expected, EGF (200 ng/ml) markedly induced the phosphorylation of the EGFR in CHO/EGFR cells (Fig. 1B, lane 2). These experiments indicate that rHRGs-T-Fc are active molecules and are able to specifically induce HER4 tyrosine phosphorylation. After demonstrating that the three fusion proteins are activators of HER4, we further characterized rHRG-α-T-Fc and checked its ability to bind to HER4-expressing cells. MDA-MB-453 cells, which are known to express the HER4 receptor (13Plowman G.D. Culouscou J.-M. Whitney G.S. Green J.M. Carlton G.W. Foy L. Neubauer M.G. Shoyab M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bound fusion proteins were detected by adding fluorescein-conjugated anti-human IgG antibodies, which recognized the human Fc portion of rHRG-α-T-Fc. As shown in Fig. 2, rHRG-α-T-Fc bound to MDA-MB-453 cells (Fig. 2, B, 10 μg/ml; and D, 1 μg/ml). Fluorescence, as analyzed by confocal micro"
